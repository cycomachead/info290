"O: I find this style refreshing and a good one to revisit from time to time. Good representation here and I would try it again. Nothing to scream about but just a solid, well made beer!"

"Overall, this is a pleasant, refreshing beer. Even for a Czech pils, the flavor is still a bit thin. In particular, I expect a bit more malt complexity, which this is lacking. Still, it is very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Won't get this again. Just not that good. I'd choose it over Miller/Bud/etc. But not over any other Southern Tier products."

"O: This beer has done little to convince me that American craft brewers handle European lagers well. Compared to many of the Czech classics, this lager is sorely lacking. Everything about it is just a little off. Although it is not bad really, the aromas and flavors displayed by this beer are too simple and too straight-forward and the carbonation is far too forceful. There is not a lot of depth, complexity, or subtlety here and the whole package is a bit too unrefined for my liking. Again, it is not really that bad, but it does seem a bit dumbed down compared to the beers it tries to emulate."

"Hardly anything extraordinary. A mundane pils that slights the style a bit. Drinks fine, but it's passable. 3.5"

"O-would be a great summer beer. perfect for grilling and mowing the lawn. several could go down easily. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but liked this more than I expected. and lets be honest the name is pretty cool!"
""
""
"The taste has a bit of the toasted biscuit malt character with a clean, crisp hop finale. The taste is a slight improvement over the nose but it is generally pretty average. Oh well, today got up to 55 degrees so it hit the spot."
""
""
"Mouth was fairly bland. Thin and drinkable, a good summer beer if we can ditch the skunk. Better than most light beers."

"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of grassy hops and bready malt. Body is light and slightly crisp. Taste is of grassy, herbal hops and bready malt. Finish is medium and dry. Very tasty, session brew."
""
"Hits the palate very nice, and tastes great with a good aftertaste. Overall I enjoyed, wish the weather was warmer and I'm sure I'd enjoy it even more!"

"This beer is all right, no thrills as one would normally expect for the style and Eurotrash is no exception."
""
""
""

"O - Not a bad pilsener, sans the aftertaste. The taste isn't bad at all, but the aftertaste isn't pleseant. Overall not a bad beer, just kind of bland. I know it's a lager, but they can still be full of flavor, this one isn't. I'd drink again, but wouldn't buy again."

"This is an easy, relaxing, lawnmower beer, but not very exciting."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 1/2/2013. Pours slightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with plenty of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast esters; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice Czech pilsner. Good balance of malt, hop, and yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall, a pleasant suprise here. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Reasonable fluffy white head that lingered for a very short time (beer was extra cold). Had a great Pilsner aroma, my first thought was ""good German beer"". Taste was bright, and smooth with just the right lingering bittterness at the finish. Was a tad light on the carbonation, though. A good example of the style."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tall pilsner glass. Nice foamy head, but not especially thick. Nice golden oilsner color with champagne bubbles in abundance. Most grassy and herbal nose. Enjoyable, easy drinking beer. Quite sessionable, yet nothing extraordinary. Slightly crisp, clean and refreshing, but could be much better if the hops were a little bigger. True to type, but seems more like a PU of today than the old beloved style."

"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It's your basic Czech pilsner scent; pilsner malts and Czech hops. It's light and crisp with a refreshing character to it. The taste is decent as well. Again, it's easy drinking with not a ton of character. It light and quaffable with a crisp, clean finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good example of an European pilsner. It's true to character and highly drinkable."

"O- I don't really have anything negative to say about this offering, but there isn't much good to say either."
""
""
""
"O: A solid American-style Czech pils with a good amount of flavor that borders on being sessionable. A nice spring seasonal"
""
""
"Overall – A decently easy drinking and refreshing brew. Nothing too flavorful or special, but good for what it is meant for; a somewhat crisper, easy drinking, and refreshing brew to drink while sitting and conversing with friends."
""
""
""
"O: Merely an average pilsner; the vegetal character really hurts it. Not bad, but there are much better lagers out there."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkable beer. I'm going straight from the bottle so I can't tell you what it looks like. Smells like a euro pilsner, very clean one too. Tastes clean and crisp and a mild sweetness of malt with a nice little hop flowering. Feels a bit dusty in the aftertaste. Overall a respectable, clean, session worthy brew. Can't say I really love the whole name and labeling going on. Trash doesn't make me want to drink... makes me want to shower. I guess this brew showers your mouth?"
""
"Very good pilsner here. Nice amount of bittering hops, mellow yeast, and a sweet and soft malt base. A bright and refreshing beer."
""
"Eh, this is drinkable but hardly impressive or worth a repeat attempt."

"Hayward Abbey Rating: 77"

"Overall, a good thirst quencher but somewhat lacking for a Pilsner. Doesn't stand up well to many of its European counterparts."

"Eurotrash Pilz pours a clear gold color with a tiny head. Overall, this was a pretty surprising beer from Southern Tier. The aroma is light, with noble hops and light malts. The taste has a light dose of noble hops over a light malt base. A wet dog sensation comes through halfway in - it's been a while since I've had a macro-styled beer so it's almost novel. The mouthfeel is light and crisp, and the drinkability is great. It's a pretty much pitch perfect take on the Euro Lager style, but more drinkable and flavorful. I like it."
""
""
"D - This is a reasonable example of the style, though it is lacking some of the intensity of the better European examples. The hops are present, but a bit subdued and the pilsner malt character never quite comes out in its full glory. Nevertheless, it is quite drinkable and better than the average Euro-style lager."

"O: Perfect for this sunny mid-80s day. A decent take on the style, but just a tad imbalanced towards hops."
""
"This is a really decent pilsner. Something light, refreshing, and genuinely flavorful."
""
"It poured a nice bright straw yellow colored body with a very little fizzy head that quickly vanished. The smell is and citrusy with some hop notes. The taste is crisp with some nice citrus notes and is well balanced with the malt. The mouth feel is nice and dry but a nice easy drinking beer. Overall not a huge flavor here but very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"In my opinion the only thing bad about this thing is the name. The beer is quite good. Though I think it drinks more towards a kolsch."
"A good choice for a hot day, and it’s supposed to reach 97 degrees today. As I stated above, it’s not a flavor bomb, but pilsners aren’t supposed to be. I would definitely drink this again."
"Pours a two-finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Crystal clear straw color - think urine. Light carbonation and light body. Nose is hay/grassy and flavor is grainy hay with a hoppy aftertaste. $2.10 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
""
"Medium bodied but a touch fuller than expected with a delicate, crisp hop bite up front that lingers into a slightly dry finish.  Pale pilsner malt along with bready yeast, apple, pear and earthy hop notes.  Well balanced and refreshing but nothing out of the ordinary."
"Pours a mostly clear golden straw color, thin cap of bubbles gone quickly. First whiffs brings notes of mineral water combined with grassy and lightly spicy hops. Not overly complex in taste either, strong mineral water notes bring damp earthyness and some metallic flavor, hops are grassy, earthy and lightly spicy. Suprisingly hefty for a pilsener, maybe a splash too much. Decent flavor, although not best to style."
""
""
""
"I got a finger-and-a-half of rocky, bone-white head from my aggro pour which evidenced low retention due to the humidity of the day. Color was a pale lemon-yellow with NE-quality clarity and lots of carbonation in evidence. This sissy was looking forward to this fizzy yellow beer. Ya heard, Greg Koch? Nose had a very pleasant lemon-citrusiness and my mouth was watering at the prospect. Mouthfeel was thinner than all of the carbonation had led me to expect, but the taste was like a lemon tart/muffin/biscuit as the hops really interacted well with the malt in the mouth. Finish was semi-dry and not just refreshing but welcomed in the increasing humidity of this summer afternoon. Quite good and worth having again."

"O - Clean and crisp with great drinkability. Done well to style."
"Mouthfeel: Light to medium body. Soft carbonation kind of dulls it down but it's easily drinkable. and the flavors work well together. Finish is sweet dry biscuit."
"O: Overall not very tasty, a bit of funky moldy hops, low carbonation and unclean malt profile leaves much to be desired. A shame because I usually like a lot of southern tiers beers, just goes to show you the real craftmenship is in brewing the lighter bodied beers where flaws cannot hide. Blah not even close."
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this Czech Pilsner from Southern Tier quite a bit. I'll definitely have more this summer."
""
""
""
"O - A pleasant but not earth-shattering pils. I much prefer Victory Prima Pils."
""
""
"This one's right in the wheelhouse. Nothing too spectacular about it, but solid & without any real flaws."
""
"Pours a nice clear light gold with lots of visible carbonation. Medium white head. Smell is big herbal and floral noble hops. Lots of light sweet malt. Sharp hop bitterness in the middle. Good herbal hop flavors. There's a momentary a cake-like sweetness in the finish before fading to a lingering sharp bitterness. Pretty full bodied for a pils and well carbonated. Overall this is a really solid beer for its style and I'm not sure what else you want from a Czech style pils."
""
"I was actually drinking Heineken the night before at a party, so the taste was fresh in my mind. Kind of what put me in the mood. Again, this is not a big-ass Victory IPA or Dales Pale Ale, and it's not supposed to be. Is it as good as Pilsner Urquell? I can't say, as I haven't had one in a long time, but it's as good or better than Heineken, and tastes great with burgers on the grill."
""
"Husky and grainy nose with restrained floral and spicy hops in the background. An oddly boozy beer at such a modest ABV, but the alcohol does seem to accentuate the spiciness of the hops. Lingering semisweet doughiness, a thicker than necessary body and booze; this beer is anything but light and refreshing. Rough around the edges, almost like a malt liquor or a Euro strong lager. It's interesting, but I'm glad I only have a single to deal with instead of a sixer."
"Southern Tier Eurotrash Pilz is a super clear, pale golden lager with a white head that quickly fades to a bubbly film. There's not much aroma. It smells a little sweet, grainy and maybe lemony. It's very light bodied and pretty smooth with a dry finish. It tastes a little sweet up front, then a sort of chemical taste comes in with a little bitterness toward the finish. Yeah, I think this was appropriately named. There's not much going on here. I find myself drinking it faster to wash the aftertaste out of my mouth."
"Poured into pint glass. Apperance is incredibly pale with a thin layer of white head which leaves decent lacing behind. The nose features grassy hops typical of a Pilsener with vague hints at skunk character. Sweet corn notes come through along with some grainy quality as well. The taste is absent of the hop character that I detected on the nose. Lots of malt character with a tinge of corn sweetness. Not a lot of flavor here. The mouthfeel is feather light with high carbonation. Overall, I am not a huge fan of this Pils. The nose is a bit off putting and the malt character is a little too sweet for the style."
""
"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a light golden straw. Minimal head dissipates quickly to a ring around the glass, no lacing. Light aroma of bready malt, hint of wheat and sulfur. Flavor is very light, bready malt, a hint of hops. Finish is more flavorful bready malt and a light floral and fruit taste that leaves a pleasant aftertaste. Light bodied, but decent carbonation despite the lack of a head. A somewhat lackluster pilsner redeemed by the quite nice finish. Refreshing."
""
"O -- A pretty nice drinker with a good balance between malts and hops. Not at all in-your-face and easy to drink on the patio. Gives SN Summerfest a run for the money."
""
""
""
"O-never had a bad beer from ST, until my next review"
""
"Pale straw yellow color with a fleeting white head that settles as a bubbly ring. Slightly doughy pilsner malt sweetness in the nose along with a floral/herbal hoppiness and a flash of sulfur. Simple, light flavors...cereal grain, grass, and a spicy hop bitterness. Clean, light, crisp, and suck-down-able, but ultimately too watery and plain to bother drinking more than one."
"I prefer their regular pils (a little more hopped up) but this is a really nice 'to the style' brew, I was afraid they were going to kill this with high alpha hops but no... this is just what it says it is and done well, tasty stuff."
""
""
""
"Nice pilsner but the flavor was just a little off so it fell well short of the great Czech pils."
""
""
"Overall an easy going summer beer. Was better on tap but I chalk that up to the bottle being a little old. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a pilsner or is seeking an alternative to the macro brews out there."
""
""
"The flavor is a bit off for a pils. It has some unwanted yeasty notes and too much candied orange (misuse of noble hops)"
" The taste is very mild with malt up front and light hop spice, there is a gentle pilsner malt flavor under the slight acidic bite of the moderately high carbonation level. The mild touch of sweetness is pleasant with light bitterness and floral hop flavor recurring. The cracker-like dry edge of the yeast and toasted malt is appealing> overall a good pilsner. I would enjoy this at a cookout or with some barbecue anytime a refreshing and quaffable brew with very minimal off flavors"
"Highly drinkable, and good. Seems like an ok beer for a hot day."
""

"I like this pilsener a lot and will buy again."

"355ml bottle.Pilsner glass.Enjoyed on mar´12. Pale yellow color,clear appearance.White,small bubbled,froth forms a close crown with fairly good retention.Floral notes from German hops dominate aromas.Clean bitterness,slightly malty.Smooth mouthfeel. Light body,soft carbonation. Refreshing.Easy drinkability. I´ve had many Original German Pilsner so I could confirm that I prefer this NY Pilsner better than many of them."
"Poured on-tap and served in a stemmed pilsner glass, the beer is a heavily carbonated, light, vibrant honey-gold coloring with a thick, dense, big bubbled, white head. Aromas are subtle and clean, with a toasty backbone and some light floral highlights. Flavors are a little more biscuit and toast, with a creamy butter overtone and some tangy, resiny hops at the end of the profile. Decent lacing that clings to the glass. The aftertaste is more heavy on the hops, both floral and bitter, leading to a clean, slightly dry finish. With the constant flow of carbonation, the beer has a surprisingly smooth, full body. Tasty beer."
""
""
"Light bodied, more carbonation than it appears. Drinks easy. Definition of session ale."
""
""
""
"O- More interesting than most examples I've had of this style, the 5.2% ABV is well suited to this as an easy drinking summer style."
""
"Overall, more character is present than some examples of the style. Very sessionable beer."
"M: Light-bodied with a wet mouthfeel. I could have done with a bit more carbonation, but the mouthfeel suits the flavors well enough."
"Mouthfeel: Light body with a soda-like crispness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" Good session."
"Poured into a pilsner a light lemony color with a very thin head wich left me a bit dissapointed.Wet grainy aromas with some underlying iron/metallic notes along with mild toastiness.Firm toastiness on the palate with real restrained sweetness,a decent shot of sharp peppery hops in the finish.To me this is more of a north German style pilsner with its dryness and healthy dose of hops in the finish,still I have had much better pilsners,I still love ST though."
"Serving type: bottle"
"It's as light as I'd expect, though a far cry from the thin feel of some efforts, pretty well verging into medium. It's got a constant crispness as well as carbonation, and it's clean."
"Overall: An above average no frills pilsner that leans slightly to the bitter side. Not a bad beer, but nothing I will revisit soon."
"Overall, I am impressed with the quality of this czech pils. I willbe buying it again. Too bad its a seasonal though."
""
"The flavor is an improvement, mostly from the strong hop bitterness. There's a grainy/grassy base to the taste. Relatively rich body, particularly for the style."
""
"This is brewed to style so there's really no surprises. It's smooth, flavorful, refreshing, and very drinkable. This is a really solid beer to have around as the weather warms."
"A nice Czech pils. Wanted something a little lighter and it delivered. Not complex, but nice and crisp."
""
"Pours light yellow with a finger of fine, white foam and plenty of resonance. Pretty beer. Earthy hops with a slight, but subtle sweetness in the malts. Simply nose, nothing special. Flavor is bitter with a dry, crispy grain flavor. Body is thin, even for the style with reserved carb and a semi dry finish. Overall, this would be an average pilsner IMO, a little too bitter, with a shy grain character and a little hard in the mouthfeel."
"Overall this is an easy-drinking light beer, and a decent pilsner."
"Overall: not a terrible beer, but there are flavor flaws here past which I just can't get."
"Good looking clear pale straw color, but this beer can't seem to hold onto its head very well, and certainly doesn't leave any behind as lace. Noble hops and not a whole lot else on the nose. Smell reminds me of big green bottle euro beers, and while it is a scent I personally don't mind, it still isn't really what I want or expect out of what should, by all accounts, be a fresh pils. Hop bitterness is there for taste and that's great, but what this beer really needs is to dry out on the finish; it is tasty but too sweet for what it is. It is fine through the mouthfeel in a sort of oh-hello-didn't-notice-you kind of way. It isn't thin or undercarbornated or viscous or anything, but it doesn't really perk up the tongue like some pilseners I've had. All in all, this is a tasty, drinkable, refreshing beer, but it does more to stand behind than in front of comparable brews. Not bad, but not great, has some flaws, but the overall balance keeps this as an average beer. If someone gave me a six, I'd work my way through it before to long and be grateful, but as it stands I'm not about to go get myself this beer again."
""
"Overall - A decent pilsner with plenty of flavor yet light for a hot day. Enjoy."
""
"12oz bottle, pours golden with nice clarity and an off-white head that dissipates rather quickly and leaves little lacing on the glass. Aromas are pilsner malt, grassy, reminds me of a hot summer day for some reason. Lawnmower beer, perhaps? Tastes are a little bland with piilnser malt, grain, sour grape, and apple juice with a hop bite on the finish that is a little harsh with some metallic notes lingering. Mouth-feel is rather thin, but carbonation is appropriate. Overall, I'm not wowed by this one at all. Pretty average for the style, hence the 3's across the board."
"The palate opens with a rather metallic character along with sulfur and a definite plsaticy/medicinal character. Chlorophenols? Fermentation too warm? There is some hop flavor and some malt flavor as well, but the flaws here really get in the way of my evaluating them. Fairly neutral malts, with a mild earthy bitterness and a nice hop flavor, this actually has a nice, rounded hop character. The flaws, though ruin it. On the bright side, some of the off flavors do dissipate as I let the beer sit, but this isn't a style that should require decanting. Carbonation is high, probably appropriately enough, but I doubt my drain is going to care if it weren't."
""
"Crystal-clear gold with an average white head. Odd aroma - like beets. Light grainy nose predominant. Taste is much better. Bready with some with some funky, slightly sour floral bitterness balancing. The taste is very solid - starts pretty normal - sunflower oil upfront with funky herbal light bitterness. The finish is very smooth and clean. Body is thick for a pilsner: feels more like an imperial. Lightly carbonated but crisp. Sessionable. I liked it a lot. Refreshing and light without being boring."
""
""
"Crystal clear light golden color with a trace white head, no lace or retention. Very grassy and bready aroma, light fruit in the background. Bready and biscuit malt body with a strong grassy hops finish. A very bland, overly bitter pilsner."
"O: Not Southern Tier's most inspired offering. I hate the term lawnmower beer, but if I had to put that name tag on a craft beer, this one fits well enough. Which reminds me of this beer's offensive name! Really? A ""z" in Pils? You're better than that, Southern Tier."
""
""
"This poured out as a clear yellow color with a fizzy white head on top. The smell of the beer was lightly hopped with some earthy and grassy grains on the nose. The taste of the beer was light and crisp, it had some grainy flavors with the bitter hops finishing it off. The mouthfeel was very light and highly carbonated. Overall it's a pretty good drinkable brew. Nothing too special about it but I think it's alright."
"O: Not complex but very refreshing and easy drinking. Nicely balanced with a slight bitterness. A very nice Czech Pils!"
"Overall - Aside from feeling refreshing, this is a very average Pilsner. It's good for knocking back with a snack or outside on a hot day, but this Pilsner leaves something more to be desired"
""
"Paired well with cured pork loin."
""
"Overall, this was a decent pils. A little too malty though. I could have used a little more floral hops. Still, pretty drinkable."
""
"o: nice pilsner, will buy again and also recommend to others. just a nice clean refreshing beer."
""
"O-probably one of my least favorite ST beers. it really does have that trashy taste to it that i dislike about a lot of the pale european lagers. there are just so many other good pilsners that i'd recommend. doesn't stand up to Farmers Tan or Krampus."
"The body is light with good crisp carbonation. Overall not a bad beer but not a great one either. There's other stuff I'll always grab. File this under average."
"The beer was crisp and refreshing, and was easy to drink."
"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow color with a skim head that leaves lines of lace on the glass at some points. The aroma is of grains and a sweet malt. The taste follows close suit with a grainy taste with hints of grassiness and a touch of citrus. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and crisp and clean. Overall it was a decent pils, a nice flavor with a good pils mouthfeel profile."
"O-At first I was not pleased with this beer, but as it warmed more flavors came out and it became nicely balanced."
""
""
""
"Overall pretty good, the hops may get a bit too much for what it is considering they seem more American style hops that get a bit spicy and earthy rather than noble hops, which might be the only downfall of the beer. Otherwise nice malts, drinkable, tasty, no real off flavors except perhaps a bit of the yeast flavor coming through (and the hops a bit much). I'm surprised this has such a low rating, although not too surprised considering the typical American palate is not a huge fan of the lighter but still tasty beers, especially pilsners and lagers overall."
"Notes: Nice and drinkable good crispness. Cheers."
""
""
"Overall, an unimpressive pils, stick to the likes of Victory or Stoudts."
"A clean, crisp tribute to excellent european pilseners."
"I really thought that Eurotrash was close to the trash European pilsners than the quality Czech and German versions that I have tried. It is by no means terrible, but I doubt I will be in a hurry to try"
"If not for being Southern Tier and the funny name, I would never pick up a Czech Pilsner. Eurotrash Pilz is a translucent light gold that shimmers with the rising bubbles from the laser etching that continues to build the head. Light floral spicey hop over a corn and light malt. Hoppiness is clean and pleasant on the tongue, slight carbonic bite and a sweet apple and malt body that's light but not overly thin. A good representation of the style and fun to drink for what it's supposed to be. If you like Czech Pilz or funny names, pick one up for fun."

"It's tasty but isn't one of ST's top beers. Would be nice in cans for fishin' though."
"O: A decent pils, probably not one I would go back to. Certainly others I would prefer over it."
""
"Poured a Bright Clear yellow, with a small fluffy white as snow head. Smells skunky, but it was fresh. Taste is Light hops, Grainy, fizzy....I don't know, There are better Pilz brews out there (Victory,Lagunitas,Sam Adams,great lakes...) I ""May"" try again 1 day, to see if I had a bad bottle, but this was not very good."
""
""
"O-Very refreshing, good session beer."
""
"Overall, I good pilsner that has the added advantage of being fresh, although if I am in the mood for this style, I would reach for others. That includes some better imports, as well."
""

"Pours pale gold with a pillowy pure white head. Some scarce bubbles climbing up the center of the glass. Nose is mostly malt with some herbal hop character. Taste is crisp malt, peppery hops, some vague piney character, and a little bit of diacetyl. The mouthfeel is damn near perfect--light on the tongue, a little buttery, and a crisp finish. Overall, a very solid take on a traditional German pils, but nothing to go nuts over--there are better for the money you'll spend on this."

"Overall: Crisp, clean, and refreshing. I'll probably grab a six-er or two once the sweltering spring and summer hit in Georgia."
"Poured a golden yellow color, crystal clear, moderately carbonated, with a small white head that fizzled out pretty quickly. Aroma was light and bready with a light, crisp hoppiness. Biscuity taste, pale malts, light hops...pretty simple. Light mouthfeel, and pretty easily drinkable, just not really my style."
""
"it pours a very clear very golden. the head went away as fast as it came. the smell is that of a rather cheap lager such as bud. it starts with the crisp punch of noble hops but quickly fleets to a rather dissappointing metalic taste. the mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. i was was expecting more out of this one."
"Overall this is the best pils/pilz ever, as far as what I've sampled. Beats Prima, Czechvar, and any German Pils."
"Light mouthfeel and a crisp finish. I don't normally mention other beers in reviews but I would put this beer just slightly behind SA Noble Pils and Victory Prima Pils. Solid effort."
""
"Overall I don't think I will see this much around here but it's another great beer from Southern Tier. Glad to have ordered this."
"While this beer won't have me jumping off the German pils bandwagon any time soon, I thought this a well made beer, especially for a brewery that seems to generally focus on ales."
""
"Overall - Very tasty, smooth and easy to drink. Has alot of flavor and low alcohol. apretty good example for the style. Could use a little more hop kick to it but overall is worth the drink."
"Taste is slight lemon zest up front mingled with the sting of carbonation, which is lively. Then some bread notes are noticed with bit of biscuity sweetness, but they fade as fast as they came into a dry herbal bitter finish. This is a good highly drinkable beer with some good flavor. Yet, the flavors are faint leaving it very mild and unexciting."
"Overall (3.5): This is a good beer. It’s not outstanding, but if you’re looking for a good pils then this is a good bet. Nice addition to the lineup for this brewery, which most people look to for sweet imperials and a couple of hoppy 12oz’ers. But, for $10/ sixer, unless you’re looking for a specifically Czech-style pilsner (in which case, buy this), go with Prima Pils (an excellent example of the German-style pilsner). All in all, a good beer."

"DOB on these bottles are 1/18/12 it's hard to get a fresher pilz then that around this area of Ohio. Dropped off at my local store today by Premium Beverage outside of Columbus. Pours a pale fizzy yellow hue with a large white head, fine even speckled lacing is left behind with eadh sip. A slight haze appears in the extremely pale yellow golden body, that fits well to the style. Label says it's brewed with two varieties of hops and two varieites of malts, so it's a pretty basic pilsner. Aroma has pale biscuit malt with upfront hints of herbal/herbaceous hop content. Citrus notes of lemon and lime also jump out within the hop profile. Flavors, come of crisp with ample bitterness upfront biscuit malt sweetness with more than enough hops thrown in to leave their mark finish nice and dry with citric herbal notes and a touch of Euro pils skunk character, but not bad compared to most of the green bottled versions out there. Mouthfeel is light bodied finishes dry and crisp with each sip, leaves a nice lingering bitterness but is balanced between sips as well. Not abrasive just a well made Southern Tier pilz, not like their original pilsner they used to bottle I used to love that beer. This one has an A with a circle around it a Craft Revolution!, and a Punk Rock Skull...did I mention the color scheme is black, gray, pink, white and pink. Those pinkie bastards brew some damn good pilz."
"Overall: A pretty solid take on the Classic Czech Pils."
"Flavor is light, barely sweet, with a grainy edge of 2-row. Subtle (low-IBU) Saaziness. Not nearly as bold as a real Czech Pilz but a decent execution nonetheless. Hard to love, but might be more impressed come July."
""
"D: all czech pils have a high drinkability factor to them. this one is no different. good nose, good flavor, good beer."
""

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely several other beers in the style that I would choose before this one."
"O: Not something I would try again; although, I am curious as to if I received a skunked bottle."
"A very drinkable Pilsner for novice drinkers and coniseurs alike."
"I like it. Would be great with some peppery salads and spicy noodles, BBQ, other summery foods on a nice warm summer day...ahh looking forward to some warm weather, wont be too long now...get some of this and enjoy"
""
"pretty packaging a hit my wife says"
""
"4.0 D: Super clean and tasty. What more could you want in the style? This would be a good choice for a party."
""
""
""
"Overall, an o.k. offering, but there are much better Czech pilsners out there."
"O: This beer has a great name and unfortunately did not fulfill the greatness expected. Crisp and easy to drink, one could easily have a couple of these in a sitting, but would one want to with the many other superior pils available."
""
""
"Overall, this beer scores an ""A" for drinkability, and has plenty of flavor as well."
"O: The beer is crisp and has some refreshing properties but I’m not sure if I would have more than one of these in a sitting as there are better pilsners out there."
"It has a bit of a hoppy flavor that reminds me of the other Southern Tier brews. This seems to give it a little unique character, but for the most part, this is a simple but good pils. Tasty, and I wish I had a few more but I just bought a single."
"Pours a nice golde with a thin white head. Not much retention, and not laceing.Aroma is of bready malts, and grassy hops. Body is light and carbonated. Taste is malty with a nice tang to the finish. Decent version of the style, but the are better out there. Still very worth a try."
"O: Not exactly a super-complex brew, but enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Which reminds me - this is NOT a Czech Pilsener - neither in appearance nor in flavor - but much more like a German Pils. Nowhere on the bottle or in the description posted on the Southern Tier web sight does it say this is a Czech style Pilsener."
""
"O- A decent pilsner but nothing far and away better than most craft pilsners."
"Pours a straw yellow with a 1 1/2 finger head. Smells of egg yolk, boiled corn water, buttery malts and faint hops. Extremely grainy on the taste, all corn water, this is not what i expected at all. Light in body and feel. Overall, not much to say about this beer. It tastes like a Budwieser with a little more of a buttery feel. Save your cash and buy a case of Genny for the same price of a 6'r of this, this beer was terrible from start to finish."

"o- what a change up from the cold weather. certainly this isnt the prima of pils. it was enjoyable"

"This beer pours a clear pale gold color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is vaguely malty with very faint bread and caramel, but it is mostly air. The taste is a lot fuller than the aroma. There is a nice balance of bready malt with and spicy hops. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a decent beer, but there are better pilsensers out there."
"This is good beer i wouold suggest slight more carbonation with minimizing the diacetyl to a more of a trace. Mostly adding the bitting hops a bit earlier would milded them out to help with the transition from the malt better."

"Perfect clarity on this pale straw beer with a thin white head. Moderate activity on this one. Smells of simple pilsen malt and noble hops. Grainy taste with a noble, leafy taste on the exhalation. Really good beer, really easy to drink. My problem with this beer is that it's a winter seasonal and not a summer seasonal."
"Overall-I was reluctant to buy this beer due to the fact that I am not crazy about Pilsner's. Southern Tier is basically in my back yard and I have been to there brewery several times and generally like the beers so I gave it a shot. For a Pilsner this is pretty good. It tastes a lot better than the average mass produced American Pilsner you would get and I have to admit I liked it better than some of the European Pilsner's. I see this as there go to beer for someone that come's to the Brewery or in the market for that manner and says""Ah I don't really like ""dark beers"" do you have anything I might like. Good beer for the non craft obsessed masses."
"Eurotrash Pilz pours into the glass a straw yellow shade with a hint of light gold towards the edge. Barely a cap to speak of, no lace. Smell is straight up pilsner malt, very bold as this bottle is only a month out. Besides some grassy scents, nothing else to sniff. Taste is a bold C. Pilsner assertive with pilsner malt and minimal hop evasion. Very light earthy arraingement under the pilsner malt. Finishes very clean and the body is light. Carb is kinda lacking in this department, not as crisp as actual German styles. Clean tasting beer though, glad I found this fresh. Drinkable for one or two, but why would Southern Tier put this out as a seasonal in the dead of winter? It does stand out from everything else on the shelf this time of year, and Eurotrash will be able to avoid the rat race of 100 different pilsners on the shelf in summertime. Hopefully this sells. Good thing it has been a mild one thus far."
"Bottle. Pours a crystal clear light golden yellow color with a slight white head. Clean aroma of a slightly floral hop with some notes of wheaty bread. Light/medium mouthfeel. Slightly weet start with a floral hop that adds some nice bitterness components. Drinkable."
"Started off like a wet fart but picked it up somewhat with the flavor and feel. Not bad but nothing above average."
"Notes: Light to moderate in body with a very clean mouthfeel. Quite easy to drink, and a good offering for the Summer. I don't know why this one hit our shelves in early January. A solid beer, nonetheless."
""
"A good lager, and its dated right on the bottle. More craft breweries should take notice of the quality and date coding."
"O - a good example of the style and a nice break in the winter months."
""
"O- a good pils and drinkable but there are many better than this, that i would buy first this 1 is just slightly above average"
"Took a tour of the brewery last saturday and this beer was served directly out of the fermenter. I was amazed at the clean,fresh, citrus flavor. I am a huge fan of the Imperial Stouts and my wife drinks Michelob Ultra, but, we both agreed this was a very nice beer to drink and we look forward to having it out on the market."
"Pours a clear light straw, small white head forms and recedes to nothing, no lace. Light aroma, grainy mostly with a hint of flowery noble hops. In the flavor, more grainy flavor, pale malt, very mild bitterness and almost no hop profile. Mouthfeel is good, crisp carbonation, a bit of a grainy bite. Overall, this is a very average pils."
"Overall a tasty summer selection. A nice run at the style."
"Growler from Village Beer Merchant. Terrribly named, this was a great summer beer and kept its carbonation overnight, excellent drinakbility I was able to finish 80% of it myself and it went well with a weekend of meals. Generous retained head, a nice moderate bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel. Really good for what it is."
"Pours a clean pale yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, just like the name, just like a Euro pils. In the taste, a small Saaz hop and a clean standard pils taste. A small bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry and clean aftertaste. A clean European pils, nothing exciting, but clean and fresh."
"great session beer, a growler is an easy kill. if your into pilsners, drink this if you can get it."
"Drinkability is damn good on this one and lovely to throw back love it.."
"The mouthfeel is light and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is decent, it's an easy drinking lighter beer. It was consistent with the style, but not something that really stood out within the style. Overall a drinkable beer but nothing to it that really stands out. It served it's purpose on this hot day though."
"D: Very good. Goes down easy and the flavors aren't overwhelming. Could use a touch more crispness, but not a bad beer at all."
"D: This one was just not quite there for me. It did get better as the pint went on but it was just a touch off. It was an easy drinker but the nose really did hurt it a little bit."
