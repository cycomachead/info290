"Very approachable beer. Nice example of the style, minus that slightly tangy note."

"Bottle: Poured a yellow color pilsner with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and some light lacing. Aroma of grainy notes is not the most pleasant. Taste is also dominated by some grainy notes with a dry finish with light spicy finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. Not sure if I got a bad bottle here but this was not the most pleasant and I had hard time finishing a single bottle which is not what I was expecting considering the style."

"O: Well, the mouthfeel certainly makes this pretty pedestrian beer something special and unique, at least from what I've had of pilsners. I don't know if this is something I'm really going to want to drink often, but it at least takes risks and is memorable in a style where being forgettable seems acceptable."

"O - All i tasted was hops, which can be a positive feature in a beer when partnered along other features. This is a quality beer and I was hoping for more flavor from this beer."
""

"Overall: simple but very drinkable. A few features which make this one interesting but definitely hop deficient even for the style."

"12oz bottle, pours pale straw yellow with excellent clarity and a frothy white head. Not much for lace, but that's ok. Aromas are sharp pilsner malt, grassy hop. Tastes are pilsner malt, grass, prickly hop presence, some bitterness, but nice balance. Body is thin-to-medium, crisp, finishes dry that warrants another sip. Drinks well. Overall, excellent representation of the style. One of the best offerings I've had from the Saint Louis Brewery."

"A great fresh pilsner. Light and refreshing while still tasting good. This would be a great beer to put a few back while doing anything outside."

"O: This is a quality Czech-style pilsner made by a very reliable brewery. I could see this being an excellent transition from macro lagers to both craft beers and some of the classic European styles. This is very much worth trying."
""
"O: Nice Pilsner, not bad for the style. Worth a try."
"It's drinkable, but has more after taste, is a little more sour, and is not as light bodied as I'd like to have in a good German or Czech style pilsner. I prefer Schlafly's Kolsch over this any day."

"light pale golden color with a big white head and a nice streaming carbonation from the bottom. Smell was very yeasty, with the classic lager smell. Hints of a slight hoppiness could be detected. First impression of the taste was light, crisp, clean and refreshing. Flavors are atypical of the style and nothing exceptional."
"Poured this German Pilsner from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The pilsener poured a clear golden color, produced a average white head and it had good retention. Lacing was nice. The aroma of the pilsner had a nice malt base, notes of bread, and a surprisingly strong hop presence for a pilsner. One of the finest smelling pilsner's that this nose has come across. The taste of this beer is light in body, very crisp, excellent mouthfeel. There is a very strong malt base that lays the foundation to herbal notes, grain and hops. Possibly the best American brewed Pilsener that I have tried to this point- very well balanced, great session beer- Nice to see a craft brewer produce a decent Pilsner. Budweiser may be king in St.Louis...but ""The King"" doesn't have anything on this beer!"
"Overall//notes - Pilsners have been growing on me over the last few months. This and Polestar both have made me re-evaluate my mum opinion on them, and with the weather consistently hitting the 90s, might I say that my adjustment is right on time! Very good pilsner that'd be great for a barbeque."
"Flavor is surprisingly crisp, with a definite hop bitterness. I expected an overly-malted adjunct-style lager, but this one impressed me. A refreshing and delicious lighter beer, and one of the best non-German pilsners I've had in some time. Refreshing!"
"Drinkability: Pretty sessionable, with no significant flaws. I tend to like pilsners that showcase more noble hop aroma, or a touch of sweetness from the malt, though, and this one is a little bit lacking in substance. I think it leans more toward being an American pilsner with it's grainy aroma & flavor. Give it a try, though!"
"Being that I live 20 minutes from St. Louis, and Schlafly is everywhere, this may be one of my choice ""BBQ beers"" this summer. It's also nice because it's good and it doesn't hit the wallet hard like a lot of beers."
"Drinkability - This brew would be outstanding during the Summer months while at a cookout. Very easy drinking. Not overly complex. Just a good, solid, enjoyable beer. Worth a try just for the fun of drinking it."
"I could drink this all day long; naturally easy to put back, but an incredibly refreshing and wonderfully tasty. With the temperature uncommonly high at the moment, this hit the spot!"
"A decent thin crispness and leaves the palate moist. Makes for a decent pils, but it seems more of a Czech style to me."
"Standard Pilsner....give it to me baby!!! Schlafly didnt get crazy with this beer....nor did it have to! Golden clear color, thin white foam head. Not much to smell. Light lemon flare gives this pilsner a nice taste. SESSION!?!?!? No Questions...give it to me all night long!!!!"
"D- This beer is good. Damn good. I was very surprised with this one as not only is it flavorful but the ABV is so low you can drink it all night long. Schlafly made a great tasting and drinking beer with this one."
"What you get here is a very nice, easy drinking brew that's refreshing and satisfying. An excellent example of the pilsner style."
"Hazy pale yellow with a quickly diminishing fluffy white head. A few minuscule spots of lace stick to the pils glass. Sweet malts, lemon, lemon peel, citrus hops and slight meringue to the nose. Malty on the tongue, with a slight grain edge and furtive hop finish. Some more lemon and distant light fruits. Light and crisp with a small creamy middle. Truly digging this one, and look forward to more Schlafly goodness."
"Overall, a solid pilsner beer. Nice to see this style from a craft brewery. Crisp and refreshing. Good stuff!"
"Overall- A solid example of a pilsner. Really enjoyed the beer and wish Schlafly would ship to where I live."
"Very pale yellow. Small white head recedes quickly but clings to the glass. Wonderfull hop aroma is grassy and citrusy. Initial taste is all hop bitterness, but a sweet malt flavor comes out as the beer warms. Lots of citrusy hop flavor as well. A nice take on the German style pilsner with more hop flavor and less malt flavor then most."
"All in all, a superb Pilsner, fresh and clean all over. The balance is there without a doubt; and a modest level of alcohol is great, considering how drinkable it is. What could go better with this than grilled brats, kraut and baked beans?"
"Very enjoyable. Overall a nice Pilsener. Though I have had better. Still something that is worth a try."
"Good choice for a summer day."
"D - This is a decent German-style pilsner. It's very clean and has a lot of hop flavor. However, the bitterness falls a bit short of what I would typically expect of the style - which is more in line with a Helles - but the hop flavor itself is a bit strong for a Helles. Nonetheless, I'd drink another if I had one as it is an enjoyable beer, especially on a hot day like this."
"Taste, almost no taste, very subtle, lots of water. Minimal noble hops maybe. Very little. Lots of bubbles, doesn't evolve or denigrate, just a beer that is light all the way around. Couldn't differentiate between this pilsner and a light beer."
"D: Goes down very easy, not filling, not much of a kick, but a nice representation of a style. This really just hit the spot on a hot, humid St. Louis day."
"Somewhat dry but crisp palate that is easy to drink, but pretty run-of-the-mill."
"Mouthfeel was ok, drinkability was still good."
"After drinking Noble Pils serveral times and going back to this one, the Schlafly actually held up pretty well. Good Pils."
"drinkability - love the taste - i am glad i picked this up"
"Poured 12oz Bottle in a pint glass: Slightly hazy light straw body with a fizzy, white head 2 fingers quickly reducing. Bready malt aroma with hints of toasted grain, grass and lemon. Moderately sweet and lightly bitter flavor that finishes moderately bitter and a bit acidic - slightly dry. Good balance, very enjoyable lager."
"this is one of the easiest drinking pilsners i have ever had. the hops are perfect and there but not overpowering. this is light and most likely has a lower ABV. i plan on killing this growler fairly quickly and i will enjoy the hell out of it."
"great fresh mouthfeel and great drinkability."
"D - Absolutely drinkable."
"Easy to drink I could session this A good Pills better than the other one that comes from that town ;-)"
"Pours a clear, pale straw with a lingering foamy white head. Nose of toasted grains and bright, clean citrus hops. Orange and grapefruit zest flavors on top of a strong grainy bread backbone. Light bodied and crisp, with a short, clean finish. Ever-so-slightly round on the palate, but pleasantly crisp on the whole. I'm quite impressed."
"This is difficult. I don't often drink lagers. But then I view reviewing as part of my beer-learning-experience. Thick white foamy head that recedes to an 1/8th inch cap, virtually no lacing. I see a golden-yellow, crystal clear body with tiny bubbles slowly making their way to the surface. The nose is not forward at all. It takes some concentration from me to sniff up some subtle breadiness, and an herbal hop aroma. Flavorwise, Schlafly Pilsner is quite enjoyable for it's crisp, slightly sharp, yet balanced flavors. I find a slight grainy sweetness in the mid palate that works nicely with the sharpness that is probably contributed by the hops. I am left with a nice, quiet bitterness. I find the mouthfeel to be light and lively, contributing to an ease in drinking."
"Strictly average. There are the barest hints of flavor that differentiate this clearly from something golden & tasteless, but there's nothing here to write home about."
"Pours a clear light golden color with moderate white head. Slight hop aroma of citrus and hay. Well balanced, kind of dry with dry, crisp finish. Decent offering but in a blind taste test would not alter much from a Miller Lite, Coors Original or Budweiser. There is some body, but not much. Pretty light and grainy to me - not a classic pilsener, average."
"Pours a pale straw yellow color with a small white head. Reading through other reviews some people say it has a grassy aroma and I can see that. The only way I can describe the smell is a macro mixed with Heineken heh. Taste, the taste is pretty refreshing. Very similar to the smell and I really can't put my finger on what the exact taste is however it isn't bad at all. I'm not familiar with many pilsners so I'm not sure what they are supposed to taste like and what not but I'm going to say this is at least a decent pilsner based upon other reviews and from what I've tasted."
"I will begin by saying that I usually shy away from pilsners, but was pleasantly surprised by this offering. The color was a pale gold and very clear. After being poured into a pint glass there was a light froth head. The nose was grain heavy with a little wheat type characteristics. Just a faint bit of hops on the nose. The flavor was pretty consistent with the nose as the grain dominated the flavor, but a subtle touch of hops carried throughout. It was a pretty ordinary beer, but the little bit of bite that the grains and hops provided kept it ""micro"" appropriate."
"D: Easily drinkable. I won't be rushing back to this anytime soon unless I find it on tap somewhere. Good example of the style, just not great."
"D: For sure this is a solid example of the style. The flavor is full and features many subtleties and is deftly balanced. Very well made indeed."
"D - This is probably my least favorite brew from a brewer that I normally hold in very high regard. Oh well not everyone is at the top of their game all of the time! It's not terrible, it's just not as good as I expected from a brewery that specializes in all things German."
"O - I'm a bit disappointed in this. While it tastes very good, it's not as true to the style as I had hoped."
"Easy, drinker not a bad Pils, more malt depth & or hops would've helped the cause"
"Its not my favorite by my local brewery, but its a good alternative if I'm not in the mood for a lot of hops in my beer. Give it a try."
"Sample at the Bottleworks location while in St. Louis. Pours a slightly hazy, pale yellow color. Short, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves thin lace rings. Bready malt aroma mixed with some light hops. Taste of grassy hops and grain, well balanced. Light yet clean mouthfeel. Good, as expected, but there are better."
"Pours a clear yellow color body, with a small white head. Very clear. Has a malty pilsenery aroma, nutty. Some maltiness and fruitiness. Watery wheaty taste. Malty nutty. Soft mouthfeel. Fruity taste too. Has a light grainy aftertaste. Okay. A light tasting grainy beer."
"Sample at the brewpub. Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a medium thin ivory white head that dissipates slowly. Thin rings of lacing. Mild hops and bready malt in the nose. Light-bodied and clean with grassy hops and grainy malt flavors with a touch of fruit in the background. The finish is lightly bitter hops with a short hops aftertaste. Fairly uninteresting overall."
"D-very good representation of the style. No off flavors"
"D- Seems like a great drink on a warm day, a very refreshing clean taste. Would go well with brats. Also would be a good beer for a BMC lover."
"Perfectly clear, golden body with a light head but good retention. Very strong, fresh, grainy aroma. Flavor isn't as strong as the aroma, but still solid. Mostly grainy, with some minimal hops in the background and mild malts. Drier mouthfeel, fairly light and drinkable. Solid beer, even though pilsners aren't my favorite."
"Drinkability is fairly high. It's a decent pils and certainly easy to consume."
"drinkability is nice. this is a simple lager without anything that stands out, but nicely proportioned with a solid profile."
"The last beer I sampled at their tap room with my woman in July, '08. Poured out of the tap a crystal clear golden yellow. White head one finger thick dissipated after a minute to a thin ring. Moderate lacing. The aromas were vaguely floral and grainy. Ill defined but appealing. Flavors began with some malt, then a German yeast flavor with understated hops at the end. Light carbonation and a watery, light body. Smooth to the point of being boring. A good, non-thinking brew, sessionable but not much to write home about."
"Pours very clear with a small head. Smells of sweet malt and some grains. True to its style it was crisp and light; it tastes of the sweet malts that I smelled and had a light hop finish. This was a pretty good beer. Very light and refreshing, which makes it great for warmer days."
"I have, however decided that german beers are not my cup of tea, and this is by far one of my least favorite styles."
"D - This is a nice pils. It makes for a nice session brew. Great after yet another loss in softball."
"M/D: Light, and refreshing. Low ABV makes this a great session beer. Had 4 or 5 of these while eating dinner at the Bottleworks."
"Though nothing that will blow you away, this is a very solid beer and would probably be a good one to introduce to your macro-drinking friends."
"This is immensely quaffable and with a low ABV, this will be a staple for the summer months."
"My friend got one of their three gallon kegs (you can get one in any of their styles) and I had about for or five pints, easy to drink and quite refreshing."
"Thanks, xmarcnolanx, for the opportunity"
"Light to medium gold pour with a bubbly body to it and a nice white head in a Pilsner glass. Spicy malt smell, and mild earthiness. Taste is hearty malt, very low yeast flavor, not much in the way of hops or bite, but very nice flavor. Very drinkable and almost with notes of wheat/corn at times. I like this one."
"D. It's almost like Schafly was trying too hard, if ya know what I mean. All the elements of a good pilsner are here, but it's too in your face and the hop bitterness too much for me. Not a bad beer, and to be fair, this is a tough style to do well. But it won't be replacing Trumer Pils in my fridge."
"On tap at the St Louis Taproom location. Arrives a clear light golden body topped by a small white head. Some creamy lacing is left on the glass. Aroma of peppery and earthy hops with a floral component. Light medium body is well carbonated. Taste is dry and crisp, biscuity malts providing an understated sweetness to support the dominant earthy and floral hop bitterness. Very nicely done. This one is quite sessionable."
"12 ounce bottle served in a Sam Adams BL glass. Bottled on 9/26/2006, I didn't notice that until after I bought it. Luckily it was just a single bottle I picked up. It pours a hazy gold color with an inch white head. Lacing and head retention are both OK. It smells like honey, lemon and some herbal hops. It tastes pretty much the same way it smells, except there's also some bread/grain noticable in the taste too. Slight bitter/acidic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium, with there being a good bit of carbonation in the beer. Drinkability is good, it's nice and crisp. Overall I think it's a pretty decent beer, next time I'll have to try it when it's much fresher."
"Lemony yellow, clear, clean, with a frothy, cobweb-lace, eggshell white head. Nose shows off pungent sea air and spicy herbal hops over a background of honey malt and faint cardboard. Nice. Herbal hop bitterness up front. Peppery, vegetal hop flavors follow. Clean, biscuity honey malt backbone throughout. Finish is crisp, dry and refreshingly bitter, with lingering honey. Moderate body with a snappy feel. Nice, humid-weather thirst quencher/session beer. I really like the snappy, hoppy edge."
"Overall this pilsner has alot of flavor, some people have described it as boring, but I have found it has good balance and is a pleasent beer."
"mouthfeel is crisp, good. definitely drinkable, but a little boring. refreshing and solid but schlafly can do better."
"D: An ideal, easy drinking pilsner. The guys across town at A-B should take notes on what the style COULD taste like. A likable beer, balanced and flavorful, with a moderate ABV. Certainly one I'd have again. Thanks, James."
"Drinkability: Another ordinary pilsner, with nothing to help it really stand out among the crowd."
"As you'd expect with the style, the mouthfeel is fairly light. Not my first choice, but it's appropriate and it works in context. Drinkability is high, although the bitterness might be too much for the macro-lager crowd. Even so, it's easy to knock back a few."
"The beer pours a nice straw yellow color with fantastic clarity. There is a 2 finger frothy foam over top. There is a great bubble of carbonation coming up through the body of the beer. This is a nice looking brew. The aroma is a little faint. I get a honey-kissed pilsner sweetness with just a hint of grassy hop. I could use a little stronger aroma. The flavor is much the same as teh aroma. Lots of sweetness with just a mild grassyness. It hits lightly bitter on the finish as well. Mouthfeel is moderate with a lighter carbonation, as it seems all the bubble has worked out of solution. Overall, this is a refreshing beer and not a bad rendition. It is a bit astringet on the finish even. I would have it again."
"Pours a nice clean golden color with a monstrous, tight white head that persists. Carbonation bubbles are alive in the tall pilsner glass. The nose is of floral hops, offset by a nice semi-sweet maltiness. No skunky nose here in this Pilsner. The palate is floral and herbal up front, with a nice smooth malt background, creating a very good balance in this beer. The flavors are subtle, but they are there ... unlike the ""pilsner-esque"" beers you find so often from the macro brewers. The taste is unchallenging, but full and smooth. The mouthfeel is light, carbonation active, and the beer finishes refreshingly dry - not overly bitter. This is a very, very drinkable pilsner. I think one of the better domestic examples of the German style. This beer has become one of my ""staple"" beers as of late. I try to keep it around at all times since it is so user-friendly and versatile. This is the kind of beer you grab when you just want a beer ... kind of a ""table beer"" if you will. Coming from me, this is a hell of an endorsement, as the pilsner style is not one that gets me too excited. Well done, Mr. Schlafly!"
"Good body, and ample carbontaion. Pretty refreshing. Could use a bit more hop aroma, and flavor, but pretty drinkable."
"Cant believe this is the first pilsner from them, but Im also going for other brews from the stouts to the seasonals. Dont turn away from this one if you like pilsners. German, that is. Great brew."
"Bottled with love on Dec. 7 2006, or about a month ago. ABV. of 4.8% according to the Schlafly website. Pours a very nice clear golden yellow with a nice white head that has pretty good retention. Aroma is of piney hops and a little fruit. Taste is very pleasant. A nice malty sweetness along with a little fruit, and lemon hoppiness. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a slightly dry finish. Drinkability is great. I could throw this back all night."
"This beer had a medium to average head. Head was offwhite and last for a decent amount of time. The beer poured amber. A freash smelling beer, both light and crisp. The taste is a little bitter hoppytaste. Is a very good full flavored beer. I really enjoyed this one. Also had hints of apple. Had good carbonation. and felt kind of foamy(which i liked). The drinkabillity was good and i would drink this one again."
"Pours a two finger head that fades slowly to thin layer leaving some lace. Almost cloudy light amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Starts balanced, hops are right there, pine cone flavor, hoppy finish. 12 oz bottle part of mixed 6-pak for $7.99 from Friar Tuck's Peoria, Il."
"Nice to see a pilsener with some hops. I love 'em, but this was almost a bit hoppy for the style. Plenty of malt, a bit heavy on the tongue - overall this was a bit pale ale-like. Nice flavor, clean finish although wanted to wander a bit in the direction of sweet."
"Schlafly Pilsner is a good Americanized version of the pilsener style that helps itself by having a generous amount ingredients and a more than satisfactory amount of noble hoppy bitterness. While it may not satisfy those would put style adherence at the top of their list of gotta haves, it's more than satisfying to those of us who just like good beer, no matter how that goal is reached."
"Impressive pilsner. Not really knowing what to expect from this brewery, I was surprised with the quality of the brew. Very firm pilsner malt base that shows much more maltiness than graininess. The malts remain consistent and substantiated from beginning to end. Sweetness tempered with earthy, pungent German hops (Saaz) for a lightly spicy, rounded brew. Firm and smooth body without grain astringency or thinning. Finishes very clean with a minty alcoholic note in the aftertaste. Thanks Beer Dave."
"This is fine example of a pilsner. I consider this a great session beer - I just wish Schlaflys brewery was closer to me!"
"This is a fine beer. The appearance is like a typical pilsner but with a slightly golden hue. There was a thick head and some lacing. The smell is a little like a wheat and had me concerned but it is good for the style. The taste is among the best pilsners I have had. There is no harsh corny taste. This beer is a must try for the lighter beer drinker. The mouthfeel is very smooth. I could session this beer for sure. Too bad it is nat marketed here. I may have to obtain more of this."
"A mild pils that is a great summertime quaffer."
"Mouthfeel was smooth. Medium body. Quite drinkable."
"Poured into a pilsner glass. Large frothy head with nice retention. When the head finally did decide to lay down, it left only a moderate lace. Color is a bright, clear golden yellow. Smell is a little weak, hard to pick up anything really noticable. There is some malt and yeast notes. taste is a pleasant lemony flavor. Not very complex. A little bit pepper. Mouthfeel was light and watery, not a lot of carbonation on the tongue compared to the initial head. Not bad over all, but doesn't really keep my attention."
"Easily one of the best pils I've had. The balance is outstanding, in a very good way. A beer can be called balanced when nothing really shines through. This one is balanced because you taste everything in equal proportions. I'm glad to have them distributed here, so I can pick up more of this wonderful brew."
"Good easy drinking beer as a pils should be."
"Probably the best pilsner I have ever had. This is truely a super beer. In my experience pilsners are usually not very exciting with slight but insignificant variations of flavor. The desired end result of pilsners most often leans to drinkability, but this one is different. It fires on all fronts, starting with the pour which is golden and bright, but hazy with a lingering head. Great bread aroma. Man this is good; it's teeming with enormous grainy flavors, and the thick malty bread continues along with faint organic seasonings and spice all the way through the bottom of my glass. Finishes with a slight hop and citrus twinge. An awesome medium-bodied, refreshing brew which will have permanent spot in my fridge from now on."
"Light/medium body, refreshing and very drinkable. Above average pilsner, well worth a try."
"What a great fucking beer!"
"Doesn't go down by the tanker-truck full like some better pilsners do, but props to this brewery putting out a damned fine example of a style that doesn't get enough respect."
"Perfectly dry with an excellent balance between sweet grain and bitter hops, this is a grand example of its style. Easily one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had, too."
"I hate to be so redundant on my numerical ratings, but that is pretty much how I feel about the beer. I have had this beer on numerous occasions in bottle form and twice on tap and have never been disappointed. The appearance was the appropriate pale golden color for the style. I found the body to be light but not watery and it finished with a nice hoppy note. It also had a good amount of carbonation, but not excessive. My only criticisms of the beer would be what I have seen in some of the other reviews for this beer: that it could use a little more hops in the finish and just a tad more body. But, I tend to drink more ales than lagers. Great summer beer and it doesn't get that excessivly skunky taste you get with the imports that come in those damn green bottles. I live in St Louis and it surprises me that Schlafly doesn't market this beer more agressively in local supermarkets during the summer. I am always surprised at how many in the local area have their rasberry hefe and their american pale but not the pilsner."
"Other than the Victory Prima Pils, this is the best of its style that i've tried in six months. Very crisp and clean, easy to drink all day, and nice appearance. Golden colored with a nice balance of malt and hops. After a few disappointing ones form Schlafly, this one hits the spot."
"This beer is often sited as being the best of the regular taps at Schlafly. The newer APA has become a favorite of mine, but this is still a strong offering. It poured from the growler a nice straw colored gold topped by a creamy white head. The head receded slowly and left a nice light lace on the side of the glass. Light aroma of hoe flower and citrus, possibly a little mown hay. The flavor has a mild bitterness early in the flavor with some rich apple/pear character mid-drink. The finish has a lingering bitterness. Mildly slick mouth feel. Nice drinkability."
"Overall, very nice pilsener. Won't get much imported that's this tasty (well, at least that makes the long boat ride). Love it."
"Good mouthfeel that tends more towards the dryness of a German pils than the softness of Czech examples. No beer has benefitted more from Schlafly's increased capacity and ability to bottle beers that it brews, rather than contracting them out. This beer has gone from very ordinary, to one of the better examples made in this country."
"Clear, gold in hue, it is on the pale side of things, there is a steady stream of animation that lazily dances to the fluffy white head. At the apex the foam reached about two fingers in height. The head retention was excellent and the subsequent lacing was webby, clumpy and widespread. Overall, this beer looks fairly normal but there is nothing wrong with that. The nose really lacks in potency, it says something to the effect of, Im a Pils. There is a rounded breadiness and soft spicy, herbal hops with a kiss of lemon & lime. Saaz? It is a shame it is not more articulate. I cant call in inviting; lethargic is a more fitting description. The palate really isnt much better then the nose. Sure it is tasty but it is too weak. The best micro Pils Ive had was New Glarus Edel-Pils. There was some assertiveness to that beer, not so much with this one. Minimal bitterness, the hop flavors are herbal, rounded with kisses of spiciness. Too bad it is far to weak to be relevant. The malt offers itself in a bready, lightly toasty fashion. Again the flavors are too subtle to make a point. This is a facsimile of a good Pils. What a shame. This is a drinker, not a thinker. Give me this beer and a cold cut sandwich and Im good to go. About medium in body, moderately low carbonation, very fitting for the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is pleasant. It is easy to drink but its not tasty enough for me to really care. I dont see the need to drink the one again. This was purchased at the Tap Room as part of a mixed six-pack."
"Pours a faintly cloudy golden-staw in color with a thin white head and intricate lacing. Aroma is citric and grassy. Flavor is pleasantly bitter with a rich malt backbone (perhaps a little bready) and some spicy hops. Medium bodied (but wonderfly full for the style) with moderate carbonation. A very nice pilsner that I intend to drink regularly."
"Simply a lovely, underrated pilsener."
"Aroma is crisp grassy hops and a mix of toffee and caramel. First sip is thin yet not watery with gentle rolling carbonation. Some lager malt up front then a sharp bitey hop finish dries my mouth a little making me thirsty for more. A very nice brew that is extremely drinkable for a hot summer day."
"Poured a boisterous and billowing clear yellow in color. White, sticky head is all over the place and makes a nice patchwork quilt on the glass. Aromas are definitely on the sweet side. Slight scents of hoppyness. Flavor was really different. I swear I taste...asparagus. Yep. Asparagus. Not something one looks for in a beer. Malty sweet after the asparagus goes away. Finishes with a snappy briskness that dries out the palate. Nothing too spectacular with this one."
"Slightly cloudy gold hue, thin head, but sheets of lacing throughout the glass, and noticeable the next morning holding tightly to the glass! A nice aroma of hops, as well as some fresh fruit on the nose. Crisp, noble hops noted up front, very smooth, quite clean and oh-so-refreshing! The hops dominated palate is coupled with a decent malty backbone, some fresh fruit also noticeable on the palate. Just a bit dry and at the same time some bitterness. The ideal session, any-time, any-place brew - a superior pils!"
"This beer had a medium sized white head when it was poured with fine-large sized bubbles that was mostly diminishing.The body was clear with a golden hue.The nose was moderately malty and hoppy with a moderate bitter flavor that left a lingering aftertaste.The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth, watery and medium bodied.This beer had good lacing."
"A light nose gives a small hop sense and portrays the nice malt base. The hops are very mild in the flavor, taking a back seat to the malt. This very drinkable Pilsener with a nice medium body a delightfully crisp finish. Another good one from Schlafly."
"Brewed and bottled in St. Louis at the new facility ( much better than the contract ones). Pours a golden-straw color, nice fizzy foamy white head that sticks to my glass, light grainy-grassy flowery aroma. Grainy and mild sweetness turns to a hoppy and bitter yet smooth dryness in the finish. Light bodied with a crisp carbonated mouthfeel, very clean and crisp, this is a very good pils."
"Drinkability: Good stuff."
"Pilsners are probably my least favorite style, but here is one that I could drink more than a few of. It lacks that sharp Saaz hops bite many pure Pilsner enthusiasts would enjoy but it has a real good drinkability and a nice maltiness for a Pilsner....It is relatively clear light golden in color.....Nose is grassy amd semi sweet....taste is definitely pretty sweet for a Pilsner...I like it but others may not if you are after a textbook Pilsner...Mouthfeel is about right..on the lighter side of medium...I rate the drinkability high because I think this is a solid, easy drinking beer..Bottom Line....is this 100% true to style??? Probably not..It's really more of a high quality American Lager...and at that it is very good...These are hard for me to rate because for the stye it may not be real good, but some American Pilsners blend into the Lager category rather easily...I'm putting these numbers down for an American Lager which I feel it best fits...and in that category it is really outstanding...a great every day beer...(As a Pilsner I would go 3.5/3.5/3/3.5/3)"
"The Pilsner poured to give an unassuming, yet pleasant golden colored beverage with a very good, creamy head that was very long lasting, and left a lot of lace. The aroma was strong and fragrant of hops. The taste was dominated by floral bitterness of hops, and was surprisingly good. The mouthfeel was very pleasant and smooth, and I found this pilsner very drinkable! The quality of this pilsner among a sea of ales surprised me."
"pours out a slightly hazy straw yellow color. little head and lace. muted aroma of pale malts and a bit of hops. tastes very malty, with a good dose of noble hops in the taste, providing a hefty hop bite in the finish. a full bodied pilsener with heavy amounts of malt and bitter hops. seems a bit heavy-handed, as i prefer my pilseners more aromatic and refreshing. certainly better renditions of the style to try out there."
"Light golden color with a good thick foamy white head.  The aroma is fruity with a sharp bitter hint.  The fruit character carries through into the flavor and contrasts an aggressive bitterness that finishes the brew off."
