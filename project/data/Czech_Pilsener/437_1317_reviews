"Unimpressed with this one.  Sigh..."
""
"Just a great pilsner. Malty and ripe."
""
"I'm backed up on entering my bottle caps into Beeradvocate so I do not remember the specifics on why I put Staropramen in my 1/10. I do recall generally disliking it and finding essentially no redeeming factors."

"I was pleasantly surprised - unpretentious but very good beer, very easy to drink."

"Good looking appearance nice head some lace. Smell had a light whiff of skunk that left quickly. Taste is malty with less sharpness from the herbal hops than many others of this style but well balanced. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a semi dry finish. Carbonation is just enough.  Overall an easy drinking Lager that would be good with almost any type of meal. I enjoyed it very much."
"I tend to enjoy Czech beers.  Perhaps its the smell - fresh and outdoorsy.  There's a little bitterness to it, which I like.  This is beer as beer should be, not that watery American adjunct lagers that we all have to drink from time to time.   Having said that, I would not drink this as my lawnmower beer.  This would be for after dinner, sitting on the veranda listening to the crickets on a Spring evening, after the first mow of the lawn."
"I will not drink this beer unless there are no other choices."

"Overall (3.08) : Yeah, I wouldn't buy this again. But it was a nice chance to try an import lager. These are for sure different than your run of the mill American lagers."

"Delicious Prague-water"

"Budweiser Budvar Is a better beer."

"Mouthfeel: Nothing significant to report. A very refreshing beer that goes down easy."

"I was expecting more skunk flavor based on the smell, however it is actually not that high.  A pretty balanced and very light flavor profile, which is typical for the style.  I've got a great local option of Czech pilsner from raleigh brewing, and when I saw this one at the store I figured why not give it a try.  Not bad, could be better, and I expect it would be if it were fresher (aka in Prague instead of being shipped here).  I think I'll stick with my local option, but a good try."

"Pours a golden-yellow in color with about a 1/2 finger of a white head that settles to a thin layer on top and sides. LOTS of lacing is seen with each sip, close to rings actually. Very surprised! The aroma is mostly of malts with a hint of floral. Not 'skunky' really as most of the brews that come in a green bottle for some reason. Perfect carbonation. More going on with the taste with the malts, grains, breaddy yeast with a sweet crisp dry finish. More drinking of the brew brings out a light floral taste mixed in there as well. Overall, a decent brew."
""
""

"Golden yellow in color with an amber hue. Poured with a short fizzy foam that quickly dissipated. Bready and caramel malt aromas are dominant with faint herbal hop and buttery notes. Medium bodied with a slightly oily feel up front followed by a light tangy feel through the middle. Burnt caramel and bready malt flavors up front followed by light herbal hop flavors that try very hard to produce a crisp snap that this style is known for, but it falls a bit short. Finishes with bready, caramel malt aftertaste."
"I really like it."

"There's actually a little harshness I wasn't expecting that kind of builds up at the back of the throat. It's not astringent, exactly, it just bites a little. Surprisingly, though, it doesn't detract too much from the mouthfeel of an otherwise nice, crisp, light-bodied brew."
""

"Overall: an absolutely delicious beer. Smells and taste great. A pleasure to drink. Will definitely be trying this one again."

"Overall, not a bad beer, but nothing special either."

"Rather straight forward and simple. Won't Stand out. Also was rather surprising how easy to drink and enjoy it was. While I may never seek it out again for me. May make a great 'gateway' beer for an adjunct drinker. I have I thing great to say about it and nothing bad~"
""
""
""

"A very good, malt-forward pilsner. Easy to drink with good balance and decent complexity. There is a brightness and crispness to the beer, overall, along with a gentle warmth yet still remains light and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouth: Heavily carbonated as most pilsners. Light and effervescent on the tongue. Lighter in terms of body."

"I think the elements of this beverage which make it a beer are fighting to the death with carbonated water for dominance over the flavour instead of working together; right now the water has the upper hand. It's not bad, but strikes me as nothing more than the export-quality macro brew one would expect to find among the foreign beers in Bulgaria these days. I really would have liked it more if there were more hops; for me, it would have gone from ""okay"" to ""nice."""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this isn’t a bad beer. But there are others that are certainly better representatives of the Czech Republic and its important heritage. For these reasons, I cannot rate this one much better than average overall."
""
"On tap here in BRU in Phily, enjoyable, and reminiscent of a fabulous trip through Central Europe."
""
"O: Decent beer, reminds me more of a Euro Lager with a bit of character."
""
""
"Overall- a good if not great pilsner, certainly enjoyable, but nothing stands out to separate from others."
""
""
""
"T- Wheaty, light hops. Clean and soapy. Good carbonation, turned out to be a decent lager. Doesn’t blow me away, but it would be fine as a session beer."

""
"This was an okay beer but I think the hop profile could more pronounced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: Probably my favorite lager, with Summerfest close behind. Basically, it's a Macro made the way it should be, with some actual flavor characteristics. Very smooth and refreshing, also if you are ever in Prague, visit the brewery and try this on draft, it's amazing."

"O: Overall a decent beer with a solid backbone. Well worth the money."

""

" The Pils has a taste that is mineral and toasted with slight creamy element from yeast and possibly carbonation with subtle yeast dryness after the swallow with some spiciness from the hops in the finish. Overall I was bit underwhelmed as the beer was overwhelmed by the skunkiness it suffers a lot as a result of this and is marginally drinkable as a result. I would pass unless I saw it on tap somewhere."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's not the worst thing I've ever had, but it's certainly nowhere near the best, even for a Czech beer. Fairly easy to drink if you can get past the smell and lack of flavor."
""
""
""
"Not amazing but worth a drink or two."
""
"O: I should have stopped drinking this after a couple of sips – but I hoped it would get better – it didn’t."

""
""
""
""
"I would love to try this on tap."
""
""
""
"Overall- I'm a little out of my element, I would imagine this is a descent pilsner. I would enjoy it as such. My BMC frame of reference would tell me that it is better than all of those. Its like a light lager with a better hop character and a better mouthfeel. it is definitely less filling than a lot of things i have been drinking lately. I would in fact have another. i would drink it as a lawnmower beer or i could se myself ordering it in an airport leaving Prague."

"Pours a clear, pale orange with some light red at the light. One finger of off-white head lingers for a few seconds and clears off, leaving a thin line of lace around the circumference of the glass. Aroma consists of caramel, lemon, orange and a hint of dry grass, and is quite robust for a lager. There's no skunk-funk to speak of. Very dry and crisp with a splash of lemon on top of some grain. Some orange peel is also noticed. Add to all that a little sweet mixed with a little bitter and easy as Sunday morning all the way to the finish."

""
"O: Not very pilsner like to me... A little more Euro lager for my taste. Not bad if you a thirsty."
""
"Malt forward. Bready, pale malts, grassy. Light-medium bitterness, mostly herbal, a little lemony. Finish off dry bitter. Body is light, creamy texture, a little dry aftertaste, soft carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden color with a foamy bone colored head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and a sweetened corn flake aroma. Taste is much the same with a mild grassy bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is drinkable but not very exciting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Czech Pilsners are among my favorite styles of beer. I wish that more of ones that are available in my area did justice to the style."
""
""
""
"As Pilsner Urquell is one of my favorites; I thought I would give this Czech beer a try. It has a brassy body, lots of carbonation and a big pure white head. The aroma and flavor is in line with a Bud or PBR, but a bit more upscale. The malts have more interesting layering and likewise the hop finish is more complex. If you are in the mood for something along the lines of a PBR, but with some more sophistication, this is a good option."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a below average pilsner. Not a lot going on here and has some of that sweet corn and vegetable notes that reminds me of an adjunct lager. Body is thin; you could have a few of them but I wouldn't want to. Wouldn't seek it out again."
""
""
"Cheers!!"
""
""
""
"Overall: a decent if unremarkable Pilsner. I bet this would taste great on vacation in Prague."
""
""
""
""
"Pours avery run of th emill golden pilsner color, with nice head, and typical pilsner aromas...nothing special here. Taste is very nice, crisp, maybe even slight sweetness going on here. But its a czech pils...a good one, but still lack luster in personality. Nice brew with some noodles, and worth the $5 relatively ""low"" cost for a Stockholm restaurant."
"A pretty standard lager - taste and aroma are OK but don't stand out from the crowd. The dryness is quite pleasing. Not the greatest Czech pilsner, but drinkable enough - grab some for a warm day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing special. An ordinary beer for ordinary people."
""
"I would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I expected more, but this is your typically skunky green-bottled pilsner (i.e. Pilsner Urquell)."
""
"Great on a warm summer day, not too different from many other pilseners, doesn't really stand out from the NA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's simple, sure, but it really is a beer that must be taken for what it is. There are more ""complex"" beers out there, but this is perfectly refreshing on its own or accompanied with any meal. A great beer, proving the saying that ""less is more."""
""
"This poured a crystal golden color. Light aroma, some grassy hops. Has a clear, crisp flavor. The Czech saaz hops are bright and noticible, and it finishes clean and crisp. This is not a bad pils in the least—more like, ok. In the time it took from writing this review to posting it I forgot all about it, if that’s any indication of its staying power."
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a clear yellow color with a foamy white head on top. There wasn't much lacing or retention on this one. The smell was earthy with some hints of cut grass on the nose. The taste of the beer had a decent malt base with a light bitter finish. The mouthfeel was light, nicely carbonated and crisp. Overall this beer wasn't too bad. I liked it more than some of the others in the style. Still not one I'd buy a case of or anything, but glad I tried it."
""
""
"O - Actually enjoyable. The skunk aspect really isn't all too bad. There was enough going on in the beer to keep me interested and my mind off the skunk. One of the better usual suspects."
""
""
"A fairly non-descript brew, but easily drinkable and sessionable. Would be refreshing on a hot day."
""
"Taste-Pilsner malt, muted hop note more evident in the finish. A bit of a letdown for a Czech pilsener, seems more in the American pilsner type. If Saaz hops are in use here they don't make their presence known. Overall, quaffable on a hot day, but average at best."
""
""
""
""
""
"o: enjoyable, a solid pilsener, pretty simple which sometimes is exactly what you want."
"O -- Everything you could want in a Czech Pils, aside from the green bottle curse."
""
""
""
""
"nothing special here, a slightly sweet malty aroma after a golden flat color with almost no head. flavor is straw, grassy hop and a wole bunch of czech malt flavors. mouthfeel is smooth and clean, not as crisp as some, and totally sucks when it warms. this beer doesnt do it for me, easy drinking, but enexciting. weak as the czechs go. i dont know, better than a heineken, but thats about all i can say here"
"Label says best before end of Nov 9 2012, wow that's a shelf life for a green bottled Euro pils I don't wanna drink this same bottle next fall. Bright golden crystal clear color with an eggshell white head forming thick and billowing above the sides of my glass, visually very appealling so far. Aroma has some sweet bready grains with herbal slightly skunked hops, pleasant lime/grassy notes from the noble Saaz. Flavor has a muted malt sweetness with a tart/bitter zing from the hops almost with a lime zest note to it. Mouthfeel is crsip finishes nice and dry with residual bready malts left on the palate not a bad beer whatsoever. Not the best pils I have ever had but up there with some of the imported versions very drinkable the 16.9 ounce bottles don't last very long the type of beer that I'm sure appeals to the masses in Praha. Staropramen, I'm guessing ""star of Prague""."
""
""
""
"O- A classic that hits all the classic bohemian pils flavors, but overall there is nothing special. Still, an old reliable."
"I love a good Czech pils, and when I see them on-tap I almost always order them. This one, however, had something wrong with it."
""
"O: A good pilsner that of course would be better fresh from the source--but still it's nice to drink a true pilsner every once in a while"
""
""
"Pale golden colour, just over one finger of white sticky-fluffy head, lots of lace left behind, honestly one of the best looking beers in recent memory. Smell is grainy and malty, grassy with some floral scents, lightly bitter hop and lemon rind. Taste is malty and grassy, lightly bitter, mild hop bite, lemon, good balance, clean finish, grainy aftertaste. Medium carbonation, light body and fairly thin feel leaves a bit to be desired. Nice and easy drinking, refreshing and enjoyable even if it is a little one dimensional and simple but sometimes that is all you are looking for."

"Overall - It's a pretty average Pilsner that tastes better than it smells and it's fairly easy to drink. There are better Pilsners out there, but it's a clean yet unremarkable Pilsner."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It is not going to blow one away with its complexity, but it is a very tasty pilsner that, as far as my experience goes, exemplifies the style."
"Malt over hops (until it loses quite a lot of chill) which is not to style for Czech pils. I wonder if that has to do with the maltose syrup I see in the ingredient list. But the body is right there and it's not unpleasant. Quality lager, at least."
"I'll admit that I often finds pilsners to be rather blah. But this one stands out from the pack in being especially dull. It doesn't taste bad, but I have few positive things to say about it."
"O - Tastes like a typical mass produced pilsener. Nothing particularly interesting about this one."
"O: A pretty good Czech pilsner and I'm sure it's better in Prague. Stop with the green bottles please, it stopped me from buying this for years until I finally found a single."
"O: Being a self admitted pilsener lover, I have to wonder if I'm running into a wall of taste here. It's my favorite beer, but it seems as though it's a tad one dimensional. You could line 5 of them up at varying price points and I'd be hard pressed to name two of the five blind. Time to switch it up, I suppose."
"I don't even see the word lager on this beer."
"O- This was underwhelming. I didn't particularly care for this beer. The staleness and low carbonation just don't do it for me."
"D: Reasonably priced for an imported beer, but not one I'd go out of my way to buy."
"Overall, there isn't much to say about Staropramen other than ""classic"". I rank this up there with Pilsner Urquell and Golden Pheasant. I will definitely buy again."
"A solid, nonjudgmental beer"
"Dark gold with a light copper glow lets me know there is more than pils malt in this one. Big whiff of skunk overwhelms all else. Grass clipping hoppiness peaks through but malt is thin and can't stand up to the green bottle curse. Even if this had been deskunked it wouldn't have been close to the Czech pilsener style. More in line with the average Euro pale lager. I would take semi-fresh Urquell over this, which isn't saying much."
"Staropramen pours a totally clear straw-gold hue and is topped with a small but sudsy cap of froth. The nose is lightly spicy and somehow suggests an intangible mealy essence. The flavor is quite nice, offering very crisp and clean mineral notes, husky grain, a light floral nuance and a herbal-earthy bitterness upon the finish. The feel is quite nice as well; very refreshing. Overall, this is a damn solid Pils."
"Very clear golden body that exhibits little effervescence gets topped by mid-sized, lasting dense white head. Aroma is rich malted barley and floral-spicy noble hops with traces of diacetyl. The malt-aroma is somewhat biscuity, toast-like, with almost melanoidin qualities which probably results from decoction mashing. The beer is crispy yet smooth on the palate, medium bodied with tongue-coating diacetyl that enhances the perception of body giving it additional fullness. The complex pale malt is counterbalanced by prominent yet soft, well rounded, non-lingering bitterness brought in by spicy noble hops. Good one - my impression is that the Czech beers brewed for domestic consumption always differ from their export versions and Staropramen is no exception with its fuller palate and richer mat-character. (500 ml, BB date reads March 2012, into the mug.)"
"Definitely a great example of Czech brewmanship."
"Final Grade: 3.29, a C+. Staropramen Lager is a decent pilsener, but I certainly wouldn't consider it an especially memorable example of the style. I've had this many times before, and will probably return to it again at some point - but if push came to shove, there are several other Czech-style beers (Pilsner Urquell, Golden Pheasant, etc.) that I'd definitely pick first. If you're just a fan of Euro lagers and are looking for a cheap, passable pilsener to slug back, this stuff will get the job done, but serious lager fans will probably find Staropramen to be a fairly forgettable offering. A serviceable, boring lager that is worth at least one try, if only because of the price point."
"Overall: Nice balanced pilsner"
"A smooth tasting lager, slightly hoppy but not overpowering. Sharp start, smooth finish, average mouthfeel, good drinkability. Wouldn't be my first choice to have again."
"Overall: Not the most interesting beer. Light, refreshing, a little weak in taste and aroma, though."
"Wish these were a little more available, they aren't bad in July/August, but they are a little pricey for what you get."
"O-Very good authentic Pilsner. It remind me on best Helles lagers i tried,or is it opposite."
"Overall this is an unbelievable beer. Yes it is much better on tap but the 500ml bottle is also excellent. I reckon this is the best of the three main Czech pilsners."
"O-Nothing special, and not a particularly good example of the style."
"Cheers!"
"Half litre bottle, not too much of a head. Very nice colour, looks almost like a belgian pale ale. Smells of saaz, also got hints of red cabbage. Sweeter than other czech beers, probably because of the syrup. Hints of flowers, not much bitterness. Nice mouthfull for a lager. This was my go-to before I really got into exploring different beers and I still drink it on occasions."
"Picked up a single at EuroMarket. The beer is immediately hoppy, but true to style, it's a soft bite with herbal lemon hops. There's an unfortunate cheap lager note, maybe fusels, mixed without an otherwise pleasant floral note. The aroma is disappointingly bland, but the flavor has that classic mellow bread and earthy hops. Not a bad hot-weather beer."
"Overall – One of the better euro-beers available in my area. It's very drinkable and has a nice malty and mildly hoppy taste. I'd drink it again."
"An OK runner up if you need a Bitburger and their isn't a German Pils in sight."
"330 ml. bottle, pours a deep clean golden colour. Head dooeosn't hlod too long, though there's always a ring arouond. Smell of herbs, flowers, but nothing really special. Malty flavour, medium body, and tastes of malts, although there's dome hops bitterness, flowery, and a hint of honey. It's not bad, but it's not much interesting either, and of course, not the best of the Czech beers."
"Pale golden in color with a foamy white on top and loads of sticky and trailing lacing. A clean fresh-mowed lawn smell mingles with dried spicy Saaz hops. A mild malt aroma is in the background throughout. A very lightly roasted slightly sweet maltiness gives way to sharp, edgy metallic and resinous hop bitterness. Very drinkable brew!"
"Staropramen Premium Lager is sparkling, clear and golden with a thin, creamy, blotchy white head that leaves outstanding lacing. It has a funky aroma, fruity and grassy. It's pretty light bodied and quite smooth with a little grit in the finish. There's not much flavor at all-- just a touch of funk and a lightly bitter finish. It has a lingering herbal bitterness. This doesn't taste that great, but it goes down smoothly. The lingering bitterness lets me know I'm drinking beer."
"D- this is very easy to drink and a pure crisp czech pils..not bad"
"D - Quite high but after one or two I'd probably lose interest and move on to something more exciting. That said, a very drinkable, refreshing, little pilz."
"Served into a Lowenbrau pint glass from a 500 ml can. Gives a small white foamy head with some mild lacing. It is a medium golden color. Smells slightly sweet, a little metallic and malty. Taste is somewhat bitter and malty. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied and carbonated. Drinkability is fine, probably even better ice cold on the beach but I'll have to wait a few more months for that."
"overall, this is a decent beer but i will not be buying it again"
"d- okay drinkability here, although this is a one and done beer, glad to have tried it, but won't be trying it again."
"Good two finger head of moderate size bubbles, lace like snowflakes and clings. Color is a 7 on the SRM beer color chart, and just a bit cloudy. Smells of mild wet wheat, and malt. I detect flavors of wheat, hops, malt. Nothing special here, but not a real bad taste. Has some body as it flows over my tongue. I don't think I will have another one of these, but it was worth the experience of tasting it."
"Visit http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com for more beer reviews"
"A very drinkable, simple beer here. Hops are well done in this pils. Pretty cheap for an imported, quality brew as well."
"D: The beer goes down very easy and is quite drinkable."
"Drinkability: I'd certainly have it again. I've seen some pubs here in Galway (The Cellar) that have it on tap; I'm going to give it a try. I've always enjoyed pilseners, and this one is a treat especially at this price range."
"Reminds me of Pilsner Urquell, but seemed a little less smooth to me, although it had more interesting flavors. Left me with an exceptional aftertaste which made me want another sip after I finished my last."
"D - Decent beer but for me it doesn't stand out from the pack."
"Drinkability: These go down way too easy. The smooth, toasted grain finish makes it 	hard to set this down."
"It's quite drinkable, without having any rich, complex flavours to speak about. Good, but only if your primary objective is to urgently quench your thirst."
"D: Very drinkable, but forgettable. Not a lot of depth here. Not a bad Czech beer, just not one of the greats."
"Drinkability is good. Nothing special, but easy to drink. Would be refreshing on a hot day."
"Not a bad beer for the type, but not one of the top lagers to come from this area. Much better varieties I'd look for first."
"D: A fairly decent pils, but nothing to write home about. I would probably go with the original over this one, but it is still worth trying just to see what's out there."
"Medium body. Medium/low carbonation could be a bit higher to make up for the lack of malt richness and severe lack of hops for the style. Not particularly drinkable, though on a hot day (like today) I'd have no trouble finishing one."
"Gold colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is grainy with a hint of skunkiness.Taste is grainy and sweet with a tad of butter.Overall pretty bland and boring not horrible but not great either.I don't think you'll be missing much if you never try this.This is my last one for sure."
"D - In a style that excels here, this definitely disappoints. It doesn't have the body or flavor that makes pilsners so good."
"This seems like a decent Czech pilsner, but nothing out of the ordinary. Simple and refreshing with all of the usual going on. A decent intro into the style, but not a standout."
"Pours a clear bright pale straw with a solid two fingers of white frothy head that leaves some good lacing behind. The nose is singed rice and wheat, with a dark bit of funk, very much like the colorsake (...sure, it's a word...trust me...) feed doused with water and left to malinger in the sun. The taste follows, but with an added dose of negativity, as though this brew were fighting your tongue for no apparent reason, and not showering for a week beforehand. Yes, that kind of salty musk is involved here. The body, to its credit, is nicely light with moderate carbonation and a watery texture, helping to salvage the drinkability from the absolute abyss. Ed Harris came down just in time, but..."
"It is a shame it is an AB product, but it is one of my favorite Czech pilseners."
"D: very drinkable beer. At 5% a pint was a bit much for lunch. Made me sleepy walking around the museum afterwards, hehe."
"D: Good drinkability. Classic Pilsener."
"This is a solid choice almost every time. Well balanced and extremely drinkable. A good session, especially here in BG."
"In all a very decent Czech lager."
"Poured from a green 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit skunky. Taste is crisp, some sweetness, finishing a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a pretty good beer."
"Pours a dark golden lager with a bubbly head that dissipates immediately. Medium carbonation. Smells of hay and straw, your typical Euro pils/lager. Tastes a like a pils with a little zesty spring flavor. A little of that heinekin style skunk flavor. Heavier than average carbonation, light crisp mouthfeel. This is what I would consider a session beer. Worth a try? Well I'll try any beer... once in this case."
"Some Christmas presents to uncork, so let's give it a whirl. Upon popping the cap there is a distinctly European lager smell, extremely sweet and dry. Pours into a pint with a nice 1-1/2 finger macro-bubble head topping a very bubbly bright orangish yellow brew. Taste is most definitely characteristic of a European pilsener. Almost a straight barley and corn-like taste comes through the beer which a has good body and slight bitterness. Then all of a sudden the the whole taste disappears, leaving a dry and clean aftertaste. This is a great beer to sit in the warm SoFla winter sun and knock back. However since it's nightfall and a little chilly this beer is a little too light for the bonfire."
"All and all, this is a fairly good pilsner, and for the cost, it's not bad having one or two on hand (just make sure you get to them!). I prefer Urquell, but it's not bad to pick this one up. Not bad, but it won't blow you away."
"The mouthfeel is thin but very, very well carbonated, and although there's nothing all that special about it, it's definitely a very smooth and drinkable beer."
"D - Easy drinking. ABV is on target with easy sessioning. Flavors are well integrated. ""Less Filling"". Good overall."
"Poured into a tumbler it forms a 1 inch head that leaves fair lacing. The appearance is crystal clear and light amber. The aroma is of light malts and hops. The taste is moderately malty with some hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a bit of a yeasty finish. This is a very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Not altogether terrible for a mass-produced brew from the Czech Republic's second largest brewery. A little malty, a little bitter, a little skunky, and you're done!"
"Drinkability: Easy drinking lager that is better than most of the international lagers it competes against, but probably only average in terms of Czech Pilsners."
"This is very drinkable, actually. I'm surprised. Quite refreshing."
"Exceptionally picturesque, brilliant, frosty pale pilsner gold with a surge bubbles coalescing into a perfect, puffy, ivory-white head. Mild aroma of sweet bread and aromatic, strikingly basil-like herbal hops with a touch of pine. Crisp, citric hops clench the dry, balanced flavor, full of honey, lemon, and wet grains. Carbonation is spritzy and light, appropriately fizzy but not rough. Very refreshing and robust - I like this one."
"Floral hops and kind, light malt profile. It seems like they only used one kind of hop, as this beer lacks complexity. That being said, its really robust and the mouthfeel is just thin enough. Its traditional and also very drinkable. This is how I imagined beer as a kid, the look, the taste and the smell. Still, its very humble and traditional and also tasty."
"D: A very nice Czech Pilsener - this is a must!"
"very drinkable. easy but flavorful quaffing."
"D- Drinks quite well with clean, pretty characteristics."
"I'll be honest and admit that I only really bought this because it was from Prague and I once had a wonderful trip there many years ago. It turns out to be an enjoyable beer."
"Don't get why this is a B- beer, I'm drinking it in Ireland though, maybe it doesn't handle its journey to America well. Tastes very much like Budweiser Budvar, not as hoppy as Pilsner Urquell, but as clean. It's got a great golden, triple decocted taste like a real czech pilsner should have. It smells great, no skunk, and tastes very refreshing and clean. I'm really enjoying this after a 9 to 9 day. Well done. Now to find it in America."
"Staropramen poured a full gold, with a small white head, and good lacing. The smell was faint with hints of hops and malt. Taste had nice sweet malt up front, followed by some nice bitter hop notes. Mouthfeel was good for the style. Drinkability was good as well. Overall I found this to be a nice beer for the style. Crisp, dry and refreshing, very palate cleansing beer. Would purchase again."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hop notes, slightly yeasty, with some spicyness. The taste is malty, sweet, hoppy, yeasty, with some spice notes. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad pilsener, tasty."
"Overall I'd call it average. Not quite enough taste character, but not bad, either."
"D: Very mild and drinkable, I would love to taste this side by side with it's draft version (if there is one) to see if it is skunked. I need to conduct an experiment and intentionally skunk a beer to get a handle on the flavor. This would go well with a mild fish, or anything that wouldnt crush the flavor."
"Mouthfeel: Pretty thin and carbonation is medium and sharp."
""
"Fours across the board, overall good."
"uh, PS.- The label is much cooler than the one shown here!"
"Drinkability - not a bad brew, decent flavouring and character. Not my first choice of a Czech Pilsner, but nothing wrong with having a few of these."
"Overall - An excellent introduction to the world of Czech pilseners, which might encourage drinkers to try Pilsner Urquell and other strong pilseners. I find it hard to imagine how anyone could not like this beer."
"This Staropramen edition comes in a green bottle, about 8 months fresh. Appearance is dark amber. Smell is maybe just above average, with a semi-skunky aroma at first. Taste is good, I can taste the hops and it seems very fresh. Mouthfeel is a disappointment, I still have that skunky taste, but it goes down fairly smooth. Drinkability is overall good. Good as far as Czech pilsners but not superior to my favorites of the German variety. A fairly good brew."
"My experience having lagers in Poland, Weißbier in Germany, and fresh hop Harvest ales in California has also taught me that beers can be unfathomably better when served as fresh and as close to the source as possible. By my own admission, I've yet to have a *real* Czech Pilsner at its best. I'll have to stop wasting money on these crappy cans and start saving up!"
"Poured a golden colour with a small head that disappeared almost instantaneously. It smelled very hoppy, sweet and fruity. Has a sweet citrussy flavour with a bit of bite at the end. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy. Very drinkable especially on a hot summer day. I should have bought more!"
"D: This one goes down easy enough. A great summer day beer. Not a bad pilsener. I'd rather have it in a brown bottle though to see what a non-light struck beer would be like."
"M and D - Slight carbonation, which I like. Too much carbonation spoils the experience for me. Not too much of an alcohol taste, a nice smooth lager. Very drinkable, especially at backyard BBQ's."
"Aroma is crisp, fairly strong, and malty, typical of a lager. Color is a nice orangy-gold amber with a very thick but none too persistent white head. Flavor is typically lagerish, mainly malty with a little hop bitterness and just a hint of fruit. Texture is smooth and thick, almost syrupy, happily different from so many lagers that come across as thin and watery."
"Light amber and strong hay colored brew. Great column of bubling. Just lacking in th head and foam department. Crisp grass and pilsner malt aroma. Super crisp hops and super dry pilsner malts make this Czech beers. Crisp and somewhat bitter palate, make this one sessionable beer."
"The mouthfeel is sharp and tart, and the drinkability is good, though I am not a huge fan of this flavor structure. There is nothing wrong with the recipe or execution, it's just not one of my favorite combinations."
"Certainly a far stride away from the better Czech pilsners. This one seemed more like a slighly hoppy Euro Pale Lager."
"Drank alright, would only try again if I knew it was FRESH, I had my doubts about this one"
"Poured into my souvenir Staropramen 50cl mug, from a pub in the backstreets of Prague whose name I don't remember, this pilsener is a very nice light golden colour, with a copious amount of light, white head, which disappears quickly, leaving lace all over the place. The smell takes me back to those dark, cool pubs near the Strahov Stadium, taking refuge in wonderful 50 cent frosty beer, no-English environments. It's all bready, biscuity malt and grassy green hops on the nose, and crisp hops and white crackers in the taste, very easy to drink, moderately carbonated, with a clean finish. I'm not saying this can is as good as a pint in a Prague pub, but that was a long time ago, so this will have to do, and do nicely."
"I loved in Czech for 6 months and I would have to say this was one of my favorites.I worked in a bar and we served it. Great example of a fine Pilsner. I tried back in the US and I would have to say it's not the same. But, still a great beer. It's my favorite of all the czech pilsners."
"Deep gold to amber, clear and bubbly with a nice head that dissipated quickly but left a bit of foam lace on the glass. A subtle hint of hops (skunk too, but only fleeting). Taste is malty sweet, a bit grassy with a nice fruity hops flavor that comes through in the aftertaste. A decent balance and not bad for the style."
"Mouthfeel felt a little deadpan,could have done with more carbonation given the style. However in saying that I found the drinkability to be easy...like your run of the mill mainstream import, safe enough to want more...& that lingering bitterness was inviting!"
"This is a good, solid, easy drinking beer. The flavors of hops and malt are in good balance. A slightly darker golden color than one expects from a pils. Pours with a finger or two of head and leaves a farily delicate lace. The mouthfeel is smooth and very drinkable. Staropramen is a great choice for beer that can be enjoyed by those who appreciate quality beer and those who are happy with whatever is cold."
"Drinkability is poor. This is what I get for going for exotic European beers without investigating first. Maybe I was expecting a 150 year old recipe?"
"While it is not a beer to hunt down feavourishly in expectation of lager revelation, it is a decent pint with the lads on a Friday afternoon."
"Overall not a bad choice, but probably better on-tap in Germany or better yet, the Czech Republic.To me, Pilsner Urquell is a better experience if we're talking bottles. Need to find out what it's like fresh from the barrel."
"D - This beer definitely grows on you, Definitely good for a pilsener."
"D: Not impressed overall here, at times was a turnoff and at others though it had some good crispness to it but still I struggled to find a reason to finish this and have to give this a pass and don't bother."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Nice and smooth on the palate, crisp, clean, and light as well. This is an easy drinking beer, very nice on a hot day, I can see it complimenting a wide variety of foods. This is one I'll probably not buy again any time soon...I know that there are much better out there. I am, however, glad to have tried this brew. Overall this is just run of the mill average."
"D: Very easy to drink. A little fullness from carbonation, but good enough taste, I'd deal with it."
"Crystal clear amber body, with average head, which quickly dissipates but leaves solid lacing. Very strong, skunky aroma, with some graininess in the background. Taste switches those; more graininess, with a slightly skunky finish. Light mouthfeel, with relatively high carbonation. Drinkable, but I'm personally not a big fan of the skunkiness."
"11.2oz green bottle served in a pilsner glass. Poured a brilliant, pale gold with a couple of fingers of fine white bubbled head. Noble hop aroma with a slight metallic hint. Light bodied, very easy drinking. Clean flavor, some malt there, but not as much as I remember from drinking it before. Decent hop bite. Solid pilsner, good summertime drinking."
"pours a darker gold color than your average pilsener with a short bubbly white head and thin sheets of lace. fresh malt and hop aromas. nice balance of malt and hops taste is slightly bitter and spiced. smooth on the palate and nicely carbonated. very easy drinking beer."
"500 mL can with best before date stamped on bottom. Pours a clear golden yellow. Large white head, dissipates in a short time, leaving gobs of lacing around the glass. Smells strongly of bread: grainy, yeast, sweet with faint floral hop notes. Smooth sweetness up front, light sourness like green apple, spicy and bitter hop finish with some light fruit notes. Carbonation is nicely crisp, light body, but never watery. Somewhat refreshing, but not quite so much as some other Czech Pilsners."
"m/d is quite fizzy and light, one step above water. much less there than I would hope for. seems much more like a stereotypical cheap american macro lager than anything self-respecting pilsner should be. although it's light and crispy, leaves a bitter stickiness on the finish."
"Overall impression: Drinkable and interesting, a nice example of an often overlooked style."
"I find these Czech pilseners to be more and more of the same..."
"Mouthfeel is a bit light for my preferance. Drinkability is very easy to swallow."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a 1/2"" white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a pilsner malt scent along with a slight breadlike aroma. It appears to be all malt and has a light Czech hop presence. The taste is decent. It has a very plain/bland pilsner malt flavor. The hops are there, but don't stand out; only in the finish. It's clean with a bit of malty sweetness. It goes down easy and finishes dry with a breadlike character and some mild hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good drinker, although I find it a bit heavy for a Czech pils. It should be lighter with a more pronounced hop character. All in all, not bad."
"Drinkable. Probably better with food than to sit down and sip it. Nothing too special here though."
"Simple, clean, and refreshing. No skunk to worry about here knowing it's from a keg. Sweeter than I was expecting. Much of the taste was like bittersweet (more sweet than bitter) honey and a light dose of hops. On-tap, it makes a grrr-eeeat session beer at a restaurant while chatting with friends."
"D: Not bad at all... but the carbonation kind of gets in the way of prolonged consumption"
"D - Pretty good, actually. I was impressed with this one, and it certainly has some refining characteristics to it. Although the abv is low, I can't see making this a bbq beer or anything, but one or two with dinner would probably work very well. Worth a try."
"A nice hoppy lager, clean and flavorful."
"Final Statement: Not a mindblowing beer, but very drinkable, nothing wrong with it at all. A decent czech pilsner."
"Not a bad lager, but, not near the best."
"pours a pretty gold color with an average head, has a decent amount of carbonation as well. has a strong skunk smell to it, with corn in the aromas as well. no hop or malt smell that really stands out. taste is average, another boring lager really, little body to it or unique taste. seems hard to make a lager stand out. mouthfeel is watery, its an average beer i suppose"
"Drinkability- I thought it was very bland and cheaply made."
"Fields of golden barley gold. No head. My fault. Aroma of wide open fields of wheat and barley as experienced on many a rural European beer hike. Tastes like good clean pilsner malt - soft, fresh bread, slightly toasty. There is a little hop bite on the finish, which by the way tastes like more of those damp, grainy fields of beer-soaked country hikes in obscure locales. If I had weened myself on Imperial Stouts, Barleywines, and Double IPA's, then I suppose I too would find regular workhorse lagers to be bland and boring. But I would also be a lot younger, less experienced, and well...narrow minded. Fellows, when you go from Bud light to Olympia to German Pils, and then Czech pils, you just don't forget it. You can take all the next ten years to get into Belgian Tripels, Quadrupels, Lambics and West Coast IPA's, but you will never forget that first girl you fell in love with."
"Decent lager, nuttin outstanding, but still quite quaffable, except the import costs puts this out of the everyday drinking beer."
"This beer pours a clear golden-straw color. The head is one inch in height and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of biscuits with a touch of spicy hops, but it is quite faint. The taste is even more faint than the aroma, with only a slight hint of bready malt. The mouthfeel is light bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is nothing really bad about this beer, but there is nothing good about it either. I cannot see myself drinking this again."
"Medium-gold colour but see through. Light head, some lacing, but none of it lasted very long. Lightly carbonated. When first poured, there was an aroma of apple / spice, a hint of cinammon that made me think this could be interesting. Carbonated mouthfeel, dry with a bitter sharp taste, some hops, malt but not in great tandem. The finish drops off quickly and I found it a little harsh and rough on the palate. The ingredients listed on the side of the can include mollose syrup and hop extract, at least they're up front about that, it looked and smelled better than it was."
"Pours a clear golden color, about 2 shades darker than a macro. The head was average and not much lacing was detected. The smell is faint, some bready malt was picked up. The taste is of biscuit like malt with some honey flavor. Servicable grassy peppery hops to round out the flavor. The feel is light with some tight carbonation, finishes a bit peppery on the palate. My first impression of this beer was that it wasn't a Czech Pils. It is a bit more malty and not as dry as the others. Definitely worth a try, just not what I expected."
"Pours a deep golden color with a decent amount of white creamy head that fades away pretty quickly. Smells floral and a little citrusy, not bad. Tastes a little light struck (damn you, green bottles!) and sweet with a lot of hop bitterness that I can't place, possibly saaz. It's a bit grassy and a bit citrusy. It's really tasty. Finishes a little sour. Mouthfeel is heavy with some tingling from the carbonation, but not much. Not really creamy, just heavy. Overall, it's a very drinkable beer, I just wish it was cheaper or didn't come in green bottles, as I can't afford a case of the stuff."
"Overall not a top tier Czech Pils. A servicable beer for sure, but there are much better out there."
"I tried this beer on August 10, 2007 at the Esplanade Biermarket in Toronto. The beer was a deep translucent gold in colour with a very white small head that lasted mere seconds. The aroma on the other was quite foul with some soapy hints. The mouthfeel was thin-bodied and very crisp with a high level of carbonation. The taste was slightly malty with a strong presence of wheat."
"(8/7/2007)Wasnt too impressed with this one. Metallic taste, very pedestrian. No aroma to speak of,except maybe for a bit of skunk, mouthfeel was ok but nothing special, kind of watery. I would neither seek this out nor recommend. I cant believe this is rated as high as it is."
"D - top notch, for anybody who loves a beer that reminds them of a good bread."
"Overall: A competent Czech pilsner, but nothing remarkable."
"D: Nothing special. It is not a very refreshing."
"I had this one on tap, during a recent trip to Italy. It was served during a a nice dinner. I was a little dissapointed. The brew is unremarkably ordinary. It's a light yellow color with a slight white head. Nice and soapy lace, but not much else. The aroma is faint, with a hint of grain and a touch of malt. It's a very fleeting and light smell. It's not a good characteristic to have to search for an aroma. The taste is a little sweeter than an American lager, but it's very subdued. The beer is light, lightly carbonated, and simple. The finish is a little watery. It's an everyday drinking beer...a worthy lawnmower beer, but nothing more."
"It goes down well with meat and potatoes. Can be filling over long sessions, but it's a decent session beer. It's better than American macro brews, but there are better pilsners out there."
"Overall not my favorite example of the style(way too skunky), but compliments grilled chicken with vegetable dishes quite nicely."
"D- Not a true genuine classic pilsner to me, but a fantastic alternative to British lagers which many of leave you feeling rather sick, bloated, and give horrible syrupy sweet aftertastes. A nice beer."
"I must say that I enjoyed this beer. A great traditional ""middle of the road"" Czech pilsner."
"If you could get a sample when looking up beer in a dictionary, this is probably how it would taste."
"This is a fine Pilsener, from the very Land that gave us this golden joy."
"It's a refreshing enough, easy ""sessionable"". Fits much better in the category of EPL rather than Czech Pilsener. Not a bad choice at all for a ""no-brainer"" session lager, with enough dryness grab another."
"Staropramen Lager is the only beer from this brewery that I've ever had. Looking at the number of reviews for the rest of their lineup, I might never run across another one. That's okay, there's nothing here to make me the least bit curious about what else these guys have up their sleeves. If you give this one a shot, don't expect rabbits. Skunks are a distinct possibility though."
"Pours clear and light gold (two shades away from yellow), with a pretty short head for the style. Aromas of sea-fresh saaz hops and lightly breaded malts, but it's a quick and shallow nose, albeit with some pleasing sharpness. On the palate, medium bodied with concentrated, fizzy carbonation. Hop bitterness is right out front, and is just about the only flavor going on (the malts have zero presence here). Like the nose, it's truncated, with simple flavors and no depth. Overall, this is a simple beer, certainly very drinkable, with little special character to recommend it. Still, I do imagine it would be a good substitute for Coors Light on a hot summer day. And I mean that in a positive way."
"Clear, tawny copper, bordering on a crystal clear golden hue. Thin, dusty white head that is quick to dissolve. Sweet grains, husky malts, a near-Euro skunking aroma that does not detract from the quality. Crisp grassy hops, medium carbonation. Not much going on here. Turns a bit dry; light bodied. Musk like malts and a lingering dry hops felt towards the end. Simple. Too simple."
"Faint aroma is mostly sweet pale malt with fistful of spring flowers. Tall, light, bright white head held for a while leaving some random patches of lace. Transparent, pale golden beer holds a few streams of tiny bubbles. Tastes like sweet dandelions. Instead of a hop bite in the finish there is a faint twang. Just a strange pils. It's good for another 7 months so that shouldn't be a problem. I'd like some more grassy/spicy hops, a bit of bite in the finish, and a crisp drinking beer."
"Medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation makes for a great party beer if you are having more closed-minded guests over."
"However, this one drinks pretty smoothly, and there's few actual flaws in the flavour. It does end up tasting rather dull though..."
"Poured a deep golden color with imprerssive white puffy head. Virtually no lacing. Smell is sweet and citrus-like with some strong lemon notes Taste is extremely crisp and almost austerely dry, yet very thirst-quenching. Finishes with a strong dryness that beckons for another taste. Very drinkable. Nice example of the style."
"Nothing wrong with this beer, but it is a long way from being interesting lager in my opinion."
"Finishes crisply, with good aftertastes. Still a hint of wild vegetation in there... may appeal to some."
"Taste was a little more malty, a slight bitter and a pretty full body, I think I taste some vanilla. Overall lack of smell and taste, I am not too pleased with this beer."
"Taste is grassy, nice noble hops in the finish. Not very complicated. Just the tiniest hint of skunk. Pretty tasty, just a bit watery. Could be a bit more crisp but overall a decent pilsener. Good fo the Atlanta summer."
"Just a ppleasant but un exciting Lager"
"Staropramen Lager pours a light orange with a fluffy white head from a green eleven point two ounce bottle. Aroma is on the skunky side, which I suspect is intentional rather than being light damage. Skunky hops and medicinal herb flavors predominate. Not my cup of tea, or beer as the case may be. Makes you wonder how it tastes fresh from the brewery (like I said though, I think the skunk may be an intentional part of the beer profile), but as sampled I cannot recommend trying this beer."
"Raspy, mouth-filling texture. Good representation."
"The best thing about this beer was the color and that first impression. But the aroma and flavor was much different than my memory of the first times I had it on tap in Prague. Perhaps it doesn't travel well, or they've tailored it to a different market? Or perhaps it was the fact that we could buy a round for the whole table for about a buck. Whatever the reason, this was a disappointment."
"Had a 12 oz. bottle at a Greek restaurant. Actually went pretty well with the olive and spice-based appetizers. Of course, the food probably hid some of the aroma and taste of the beer, but all and all, not a bad Pilsner. Will have to try again sometime when other factors arent present"
"Not a problem ordering another one of these."
"Recommended!"
"Mouthfeel is nice. Not the tongue-searing extreme carbonation that the looks of it implied. Drinkability is fine as well. Really a solid import beer here, a lot better than other green bottle pilseners from overseas."
" This is a classic Czech pilsner with a good taste and finish that doesn't leave your throat tasting like sawdust after multiple drafts, as you occassionally get with the style."
"D: Better than American lagers, but nt much more to say"
"Moderately drinkable, but just flat out disappointing. Was hoping for more, being that I'm drinking this here in its home city."
"Overall: Very clean and quite even throughout the experience. A winner! Between this beer and Pilsner Urquell (the other Czech lager available at the local liquor store), it is pretty much sixes."
"12oz. bottle pours out a golden, yellow color with minimal head. No lacing. It smelled of grain and spice. Surprisingly there was no skunky smell. I could taste some hop flavor and a little spice. It was relatively crisp and smooth. I found it quite drinkable. It is a pretty descent European lager."
"Overall, I won't buy this again, but as a Czech Pilsener this is quite a good one. Fans of the style might like it."
"D - Overall, quite good. Not my favorite style, but one of the better pilseners I've had."
"Picked this bitch up for $2.99 a sixer at bevmo on sale. Best before date is a couple months past due. I tend to not shy away from beers past their supposed prime and have had nothing but success to this point. I couldn't pass up the price and it turns out the beer was fine."
"very drinkable and kind of weather but hot days they would go down fast."
"Yes, it tastes a bit light but I am not reviewing this expecting a strong beer. I would highly recommend this beer out of most East European Lagers."
"As the beer is poured from the bottle, a good golden color emerges. There is a sizeable frothy head that holds quite well. The beer smells of bitterness from hops and perhaps a slight skunk smell. This beer has a good level of hoppy bitterness but there are better pilsners out there. The beer has a strong body with good carbonation. This is quite drinkable but as said before if you want a pilsner, there are better pilsners out there."
"Dark gold in colour with lots of carbonation. Grassy hop aroma with a touch of grainy malt. Upon drinking, more honey flavored malt flavors with a decent enough contribution of herbal and grassy hop notes. Medium bitterness. A basic Czech pils, which is still a pretty drinkable thing in my book."
"D: much better than my last experience of this beer on tap in St. Albans, nr. London, where I encountered the worst Staropramen I'd ever experienced. (Perhaps because that one was brewed under license and this one authentic?) Yet for my taste this beer is not so pronounced as many Pils or Pilsners I tried on tap during my trip in the Czech Republic; it's rather like a more vaguely-defined/generic Euro Pale Lager, as the characters are not as focused as a Pils should be. Having said that, nothing's wrong with it being a easy-drinking lager."
"Light body, malty, clean and refreshing."
"(Unless that indicates a cross between redemption and temptation?)"
"Pours a crystal clear gold, so clear that you could watch TV (or whatever) through your glass of beer. Basically exactly how you expect a pils to look. Grainy, grassy aroma. Full and clean malt/grain flavor... I hate to say it, but the grainy character is somewhat similar to PBR. Not that this is cheap or cruddy at all, because it's actually a tasty and extremely drinkable pilsner. Pretty good beer."
"All-in-all, a reasonable brew and I preferred it to Budvar. Not a beer style I would drink regularly"
"An average beer per style and region. Colors and textures appear as expected: Clear, straw, high co2, fizzy head, little lacing. The aromas could be better: Light barley, corn, cereal grains, and light struck against Saaz hops. Flavors fare better than aromas: Lightly malty. Has flavors and textures of light cereal grains. Hopped for balance only. Lightly grapefruity. Has a bitter bite in the back of the throat in the finish and aftertaste. Light body-no creaminess and a bit harsh. Crisp and moderately dry finish."
"Pours a clear golden, big fluffy white head, no lacing that I can see. Smells malty, a little skunky, some hops are hidden, kind of honeyish. Taste is malty, sweet, some hop presence is detectable in the finish. Clean mouthfeel, medium carbonation and very smooth, good beer for a hot day, and the price is right."
"Bottle: Poured a golden color pils with a bubbly extra white head with average retention. Aroma of fresh crisp hops with floral malt. Taste is quite refreshing with again the crisp hops and floral malt making a good impression. Carbonation is great for the style and no skunkyness is a bonus for those imported bottles."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and lacks the malty roundness of top examples of this style. Easily drinkable, but not particularly interesting or complex. A fine match with an excellent Italian sandwich outside on a sunny, breezy spring day, however. Best before January 16, 2006 on this bottle."
"500 mL green bottle, best before date printed on the rear label."
"I found this Pilsner OK, it does it job but not much more. Can I have some more bitter hops, please?"
"the 7th tasting in the 10 LCBO lackluster Slavic lagers. This one is the best of the lot... fairly well charactered as a medium bodied bohemian lager in the pilsner style. Poured a pleasant rich gold, nice fluffy white cap that maintains, good lace, medium carbonation. Nice sweet biscuit malt and floral saaz hop notes in the Aroma. Medium bodied...slick mouthfeel, good malt delivery in balance with herbal hops...finish is clean with tart drying from more hop pronouncement. A nice Bohemian lager."
"very drinkable, I would like to have that beer in the summer not in January when its -50 outside."
"Smooth and creamy. Drinkable, which is above average for pils I've had. Beats Urquel. Clean, decent malts. Slight citrus in saaz hops. Good carbonation in finish. Balanced but on sweetish side.Another average LCBO lager import, but fresh. Thanks Paul."
"Very drinkable. After reading the other reviews, I'll keep away from the scary green bottle, though."
"Another euro lager in appearance. Crystal clear gold color, almost no head, just a few wisps of bubbles on the top of the beer. Smells of grassy malts, more skunky than most EL's, but other than that, mostly the same experience as any beer from that style, only worse. I will never buy this again, there are too many better beers out there."
"Sweet honey up front, turning to lightly toasted malt. Wave of floral, sea air, spicy hops crests. Adequately bitter into the finish. Refreshing, spritzy carbonation. Light to medium body. A little bit more of a hop bite would do this brew some good."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and velvet like, and I would say carbonation is just right. Crisp and refreshing, I'm about to pour my third one and I'm still looking forward to it."
"Rather non-descript Eurolager...nothing standout here. Easy to drink, but not something I would seek out."
"Overall a decent beer. However, the hop bite is just too much for my liking."
"Overall a nice beer and a good representitive of its class."
"Pours a nice deeper golden with a thinner then expected head even with a rough pour very clean no lacing at all,aroma was a little skunky (green bottle)with a hint of sweet grain.Noticed a little smokiness in flavor off the bat with a touch of toasted grain and iron not much hop presence though for a Czech lager/pilsner just light zip in the finish.Taste is on the drier side and goes down well in the summer here,I would drink this over any domestic or Canadian macro when I want a easy drinking lager but those green bottles scare me."
"More euro trash beer. Staropramen is a light cold colour. Pours with a nice head, but the foam quickly recedes to film. Not much lace to speak of. Just a few whiffs sporatically placed around the glass. Makes the glass look broken, actually. Wet cardboard smell. Reminds me when I once helped a friend move in the rain. Bit skunky as well. Green bottle/lightstruck, or purpusely done? You decide. It's not an overwhelming skunk, so I'm leaning towards the latter. Starts out bland, like soggy cereal. Not much of anything expected in a beer, like hops, malt, or even adjuncts. Aftertaste is a bit skunky sour. I'm not sure what it is, but I hate the mouthfeel. It's dry, oily and leaves an unpleasant sensation on the side of the tongues. Not something I would drink again. I could state that if offered for free, I might take it. But that only means it wasn't truly horrible. I'd take Bud Light if offered for free, I might even take Colt 45 if offered for free. Don't get this beer."
"A dark gold body topped by a decent white head. The nose is mostly of the Saaz hops with the taste a typical Czech pilsner. There is the nice floral side and just a small bit of snap in the finish. Drinkability is top-notch on a warm summer day. Just a small bit on the cloudy side for a pilsner."
"Not a bad pilsner"
"A decent beer for this style."
"Appearance is a clear golden with a large white foamy head. Aroma is the tell tale signature of Czech Pilsner, the saaz is very apparent and inviting. Taste is crisp and refreshing, the hops deliver a flowery aftertaste. Clean, light body and easy drinkability. A good summer beer. Not the best of the style but a solidly enjoyable brew."
"My green bottle looks slightly different than the one pictured. It pours a clear pale yellow with a two inch offwhite head. Head collapses quickly into patchy lacing. Aroma has some Euro skunked cardboard which masks some hints of lemon. Mouthfeel is light bodied and fizzy with carbonation. Taste is mostly hop bitterness, just a hint of sweet malt. Very one dimensional with this lack of malt balance. Finishes bitter, and astringency detracts greatly from drinkability."
"This poured a crystal clear gold color with a nice one inch head. Light lacing developed through the drink. The aroma is average, as some malt and hops are detectable. The flavor was typical Czech Pilsner, malt with a biting bitterness and a hint of lemon. The mouthfeel was clean and crisp, and the bitterness lasted on the tongue for a minute after swallowing. Nice carbonation levels. A refreshing beer."
"Nevertheless, it was a perfectly acceptable lager, and had the virtue of being very crisp, and a little lemony, which in this case was a good thing."
"Sinkability  This one didnt cut the mustard."
"This is trying really hard to be average. As you drink it, it doesn't even try to flatter itself. Tastes too unbalanced for me. Don't think I'll have another."
"Pours crystal clear and golden hued with tiny bubbles and minimal head and lace. Aroma is mild malt, stomach acids and light citrus Saaz hop aroma. Flavors are pale malt, mild bitterings and a very light sweet nees to the aftertaste. Relatively complex lager and very classic to style in my opinion. (ed. note - I've had this beer in Prague on the square and it so much better its not even comparable to the stuff out of the bottle, every who likes beer should drink the Czech beers locally. They just do them justice by sticking them in green bottles and shipping them to the US.)"
"Had this at a hole in the wall in a fancy part of downtown Moscow. It was clearly fresher than the last time I tried it (previous review). Came out a deep solid gold under a substantial white head that showed some staying power and generated excellent lace. The nose was mild, with flowery hops. The mouth was prickly and light. The hops kick in from the start, not overwhelming, but ensuring a mildly bitter experience throughout. Malts are there to provide balance up front, but the overall experience is hoppiness, particularly as the malt fades in the finish leaving the aftertaste completely to the hoppy forces. Good stuff, the dry bitterness only makes you want more. And more. And more...!"
"Had my first sample today - this is definitely going to be one of my favourite pilseners in the future (whenever I can afford it, or get it abroad). I guess the Czechs won't call it a pilsener as it's not being brewed in Plzen, but to me it's a pils good enough. Good lasting head, delicious Saaz aroma, pleasant flavour, very well balanced, better aftertaste than most pilseners."
"I was a bit surprised by the nice light gold glow of this one, but maybe just because my last two lagers were Miller Lite and Coors Light. The head is nice and white and slightly soupy, but no bigger than middling. The aroma is mildly hoppy, maybe a little skunked. The flavor is more malt than hops. It has that bone-dry straw malt flavor that a pilsner is supposed to have, but there's something slightly unpleasant going on. Fairly drinkable but there's something I don't like about it. It does have that nice slightly creamy mouthfeel that Bitburger and a few other quality pils have."
"Better than a plain Jane macro, but not real special."
"This beer is Czech in nature - it has that slightly creamy feel to it, and just an edge of hops - but nothing dramatic. If it was ever produced as a high-quality beer, it isn't now. OK, it's a genuine Pilsner, and it's not made from rice, but the rest of the large box of it I bought last week is now taunting me from my garage - I' m afraid I'll have to use it up my less-choosy beer-drinking visitors."
"Pours a light, golden/yellow colour like many, many other beers. Has a thin, snow white head that is rather quick to dissipate. The smell is actually, as strange as it may sound, quite close to fresh cut green apples. The taste, too, reminds me faintly of apples. Leaves a very light lacing on ones glass with each drink. The mouth feel is nice and light-weight with light to moderate carbonation....leaning more towards light. This is a surprisingly easy to drink beer. I will most certainly spend money on this Czech again."
"Medium gold color, small foamy head. Yeasty and fruity aroma. Mild light bodied pilsner. A little malty, some flavor. Smooth taste, but a little artificial tasting. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is neutral. Some green bottle skunkyness. Really why bother drinking this stuff. Average beer at best."
"This brew poured a medium head of small to large white bubbles that mostly diminished and left a fair lacing. The body was a transparent light golden color. It had a mild hop aroma. It was initially bitter with a mild hop flavor. The inital bite smoothened in in the finish and left a slightly tingly lingering mouthfeel."
"Appearance of an average lager in color and head. Skunky aroma which I kind of like in my pilsners, I don't know why but I do. Taste did not have as much skunkiness but still had a little. Very light in body. Not much malt here, mostly hops. Slightly bitter, but no overpowering flavor. Finishes crisp and clean. Good for a cheap import."
"Thx"
"This beer pours a normal yellow color with medium white head and minimal lacing on the glass. The aroma is very malty and almost a little sour. The flavor is dry with very apparent hops and a lot of carbonation. Sourness is detectable in the sides of the mouth, but not too much. Very reminiscent of a better Heineken. The finish is moderately dry. I'd have this again probably since it is not very expensive, but it wasn't anything wonderful."
"Drinkablility: I would only drink this beer again if there was nothing else available. Probably wouldn't buy this one again."
"Flavor is largely honey and grain with a bit of skunk oil rolling on the tongue. The malt quickly drops to a dry crisp hoppy finish."
"I agree with the Pilsner Urquell comparison with this one.. This one competes with the world class pils. Staropramen is a clear golden beer with a very small and fast disappearing head. The aroma is very inviting with sweet and hoppy tones. And the flavor is just like a czech pilsener should be very easily drinkable with a faint sweetness to start with but then dominated by the very nice hoppy bitterness. 5% ABV."
"The taste begins with a malty sweet assault and lingers. however it finishes with a slight hoppy bitterness."
"Nice hop finish, I have a feeling a fresh one of these on tap would kick ass."
"Deep reddish-golden color, quite clear with lots of fine bubbles and a small off-white head. Rich aroma of sweet and bready malts with noble hops and - miraculously - no skunk aroma. Taste begins with rather sweet malts and slight carbonation, midway through the taste; spicy hops ride atop the malts. By the end of the taste, the hops leave a harsh and metallic bitterness at the back of the mouth. The mouth feel is smooth and pleasant. Overall, a good lager that might benefit from some tweaking of its hop profile, the aftertaste is excessively bitter."
"Compared to others I must have not bought a old or skunked bottle. Mine was actually quite fresh tasting. Wonderful fresh and clear Saaz-type hop aroma that faded some with time. Bright, clear and dark gold with full head, good retention and nice lacing. Nicely balanced beer with a little less bitterness that other Czech beers of similar ilk, but enough to make presence known. Hop bite lasts throughout with medium long finish. Good malt backing, providing nice body and some richness. Light to medium body, flatter feel, but adequate carbonation. Good all around and balanced beer."
"Taste = light, crisp mouthfeel. Bitter as sin from plenty of hops that hang right in there on the long aftertaste. Quaffable. I'll admit that I'd buy Pilsner Urquell and Czechvar first, but this is pretty good beer and running third place to those two is nothin to be ashamed of."
"the beer is extremely smooth with an almost unnoticeable carbonation. the malts dominate the flavor with a little bit of hops in the finish. it has a medium-light body and it is very easy to drink. i would not say it is a remarkable beer, but it is certainly better than average."
"Clear pale gold color, big-bubbled white head of 1/2 an inch.  Slightly skunked aroma.  Sweet malty flavor with a decided wet canvas impression that's re-inforced by the aroma.  Slight watery sense before a mild hoppy finish mid-mouth.  Carbonation is medium, perhaps this beer's best quality.  OK in drinkability but nothing special is going on in this brew, some similarities to Heineken et al...."
"Crystal clear dark straw hue topped by a fluffy porcelin - white head.  Skunky mercaptans, sulfur, and rough grain huskiness in aroma.  The sharp, astringent graininess coupled w/ the rough bitterness make this quite rough for a pilsner. Sulfur persists in the flavor and is a bit offputting... All around this beer almost abrasive on the palette. The body is weak and watery, while the malt backbone is seriously lacking.  Finishes w/ an unpleasant tannic astringent note.  I most likely got a poorly handled bottle, but I just don't see myself ever having this again."
"i really like it, soft maltiness, with a icely bitter finish, very elegant, subtle and just plain good, very good for session drinking aswell."
"hazy golden color with a thin head that dies quickly.  saaz hop aroma quickly asserts itself but doesn't overwhelm.  sort of a cross between heineken and pilsener urquell. nothing really great, a little thin in the mouth and little carbonation...seems ""dead"".  maybe i got an old bottle."
"Deepstraw gold with a slight clinging lace. Mildly malty grainy, low-key hop aroma. Starts thin to bitter, ending lingering oily hop. Meager malt profile causing balance to tip too far to the hop end. It's drinkable but not worth a search."
"Seems to be similar to a Pilsner Urquell, also in a green bottle.  This is from a large brewer and is better than the majors over here, the ABV is 5.2%."
"The initial aroma from the 12 oz. bottle was extremely skunky. After pouring, the skunk dissipated a bit. I could then detect some of the beer's true characteristics. Perfect light, effervescent mouthfeel. Nice semi-sweet malt and herbly, spiced hop finish. Unfortunately, some skunk essence still remained. I'll have to seek this one out on tap."
"The largest brewer in The Czech Republic..why can't A-B or Miller make beer this good...Only average for Czech Rep. but much better than the swill we're used to here...I'm not sure where exactly the old spring that gives the beer its name is."
"Very clean and crisp, with moderate hops.  Not bad from the bottle, but on tap is vastly superior.  In the tap version, I sometimes get just the barest hint of spearmint in the finish.  Of course, the pink elephants show up a little while after that."
