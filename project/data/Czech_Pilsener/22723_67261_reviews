"Overall I am not terribly impressed with this Pils. It tastes like a Pils, kind of what I would describe as ""table beer"" - something you can drink with meals and in volume. But I have had better PIls. This one was a bit flat."

"Super drinkable. Super clean. Awesome for a $9 six pack"

"I love that it's unfiltered, and it tastes that way ... In a good way!"

"Notch Pilsner very effectively provides a clean, crisp extremely flavorful, satisfying Pilsner with only 4ABV. Nothing against the wonderful varieties of heavier microbrews out there however Notch should be praised for their tasty , refreshing products contributions to the American beer scene."

"Not the absolute best example of the style, but not at all a bad beer."

"Yikes, I love this beer!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Well, they got the mouthfeel right, but I am afraid the unusual malt and hop flavors here make this beer rather hard to enjoy"
""
""
""
"This is light bodied and highly drinkable. I recommend this one for people who like balanced and drinkable hop flavor. I would prefer this to a light IPA for example."

"o - Overall a pretty nice pilsner; exactly what I wanted with lunch outside on a nice day. Easy to drink and some nice floral and citrus notes in the taste, would have it again."

"O - I don't see myself having this one again, but elements of this brew encourage me to try other offerings from Notch."

"O: This beer was refreshing, paired great with food, and was extremely easy to drink - I think I could have literally drank this beer all day long (though I am guessing that is the point of creating these session style beers from Notch)."
""
""
""
""
"Eh."
""
""
""
"The taste tends to downplay the sweet malts and biscuit in favor of a notable clean and crisp hop feel coming up the backside. Pretty drinkable and refreshing."
""
"Tip of the hat to the guys in Ipswich...Thank you!"
"O: Goes down very easy, rather tasty, not filling, no kick, nice representation of style. This is a great beer that falls more under the true definition of a ""session"" beer. It will definitely be a staple come summer time."
"O: Went in with low expectations but found myself pleasantly surprised by this one. Would probably purchase again when looking for a low abv sessioner. Stuff goes down really easy. Based on the reviews it has, I'd say this one is a bit underrated imo."

"The beer pours like crisp watery gold, and sits in the mug like light grapefruit juice and piss with a slight ambering. This beer is only slightly hazy and opaque due to it being unfiltered, and has a great torrent of bubbles rushing to the surface to replenish the head which is a pure white, eggshell made of nice little smooth bubbles that settle at about a fingers width and seem like their staying for a drink. The beer smells wet and spicy with a juicy linger of the almost-apple that I’ve come to associate with pilsners. The hops are nicely spicy though, with hints of fluffy, buttered biscuit pulling through in the back and edges of the glass. The beer tastes much like any other pilsner. There is the slightly-stale-bread taste of the malts that runs strongly through the sip and lingers in the mouth for awhile, and there are nice slight spices from the hops and fruity juicy feel reminiscent of apples as the beer initially crosses the tip of the tongue. Mouthfeel is quite tart with a little too much carbonation assaulting the tongue and leaving it tingling with a slight sheen of saliva and dry bread feel in the rest of the mouth. The beer is very crisp and watery, making it very drinkable, and it does not sit heavy in the stomach, but I suspect that the pilsner style is just not my favorite, as I am just not impressed with this beer. Overall I call this beer a meh."

"O) Overall an average pilsner, just a bit more bitter than the norm."
""
"O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style since it seems a bit on the sweet and citrusy but this still a good beer to pound down for a while."
""

"Pours a five+ finger white head that fades quickly to a ring leaving some lace. Almost clear pale amber color. Good carbonation and light bodied. Light grassy nose and flavor is hoppy, grassy with a bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste. Good lawnmower beer. $1.99 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a crystal-clear, pale, golden-yellow coloring with a very slow, steady stream of carbonation bubbling. Thin covering of white film that leaves a slick coating along the glass. Aromas are light and effervescent, with a floral boquet along the top of a toasted cereal backbone. Flavors are light, with the toasty backbone and a slightly sour malt highlight, with a bitter, resiny hopping to clean it all up nicely. The aftertaste is minimal, with a hint of roast and char. The finish is quick and clean, leaving the palate with only a touch of the tangy sweetness."
"A clear miss on this batch. Perhaps I'll try this again and see if I happened upon a mistake this time."

"O: With work, this could be excellent. I wish we had easy-drinking session ales like this in CA."
"O: Good flavors and low ABV make this a good candidate for an every night Pilsener if that's what you're looking for. It was interesting drinking a 4% beer that had this much flavor."
"The feel of this beer is highly drinkable with no alcohol detectable. There is a smooth but light feel that makes this beer go down quicker then it seams at first. A really good session beer."
"its not bad, but not something I could drink all day, either, which was the intent, so it misses its mark. though its a decent beer, it misses its intent."
"Solid light Pils. Nice hops but I would like it to be a bit more hoppy instead of grainy."
"Overall I was a fan of this beer, and the low ABV is icing on the cake. It’s not quite as clean as the world-class pilsners, but it’s still well worth a shot."
"This is a very easy-drinking summer beer, but I could never see myself picking up a sixer given the number of better beers at this ABV and price point. A fine, if unremarkable, pils."
"Aiming for the Old World rustic version of the Czech lager. Mild haze, but golden color still shines bright in the light. Enough froth for a Pils to be proud of. Fresh-cut crabgrass, wild herbal hop and a dusting of biscuity malt in the nose. Smooth, with a snap of crispness on the backside of the light body. Malt comes forth on the light side with a sticky, biscuity, almost husky flavor throughout. Hops are slightly oily with spicy, herbal undertones; bitterness balances. Biscuity, husky tone lingers. Finish lands dry. Some fine tuning and softening would do this lager great. Hard pressed to put back more than one."
"O/D-Just bland. I can see why they named it Session Pils, but I'd prefer both my session beer and my Pilsener to have a bit more personality."
"Not clean enough of a beer for the style. I will pass on this the next time I see it."
"Overall pretty good, the nose is a bit too light, but taste is good for a 4% very sessionable light summer clean and crisp beer."
"Overall this beer was a pleasant surprise. Clean, crisp, well balanced and extremely quaffable. I could see myself drinking several of these in a sitting and would probably buy this regularly if I had access."
"Drinkability is high of course because of the ABV, BUT, the taste plays into the drinkability well too. Just because a beer sports a low ABV doesn't mean it's tasty enough to warrant a few. This satisfies both needs and is worth picking up again for the right occasion...though there are better pilsners...especially if you prefer yours with some snappy crispness."
"Overall: I wanted to like this beer, but the flavors just did not come together for me. There is an odd sweetness that I associate with Leinenkugels. While it works there in some instances, the sweetness here is a bit out of place. I want to drink this and with some small modifications, I could see this being a regular beer in my rotation...but for now a pass."
"This is a very easy drinking tasty beer. Well balanced and with the lower abv you can enjoy several at one sitting."
"Always on the lookout for tasty, full-bodied, low-ABV beer, I recently dragged home a bottle of Notch's session ale and this bottle of their pils. After trying the ale and being totally underwhelmed by it, I was prepared for more of same from the pils but was happily surprised. This was not the hop-heavy swipe that I expected but instead was quite tasty and balanced. The aroma is a bit light, but it still emitted a good handful of flowers and a lemon peel or two. Light and flavorful, this is definitely a beer for the summer. I'm not one to drink beer and then operate machinery of any kind, especially the kind with whirring blades, but if I had to choose a lawnmower beer this would rate at the top of the safety list."
"Overall, a good beer. Will buy again."
"Pretty clean for a contract brew. Shouldn't be surprised, because Ipswich makes good beer."
