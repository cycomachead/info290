I always make a question to order either this or Trumer Pils whenever I'm in a bar that offers them in Berkeley - it keeps things simple, and yet, shows the vibrant qualities that a homemade lager can bring to the table.","magictacosinus","Mar 06, 2014"

My first thought is that this is just an old keg or maybe it hadn't been poured in a while and was sitting in the lines, but at a place like the Toronado I wouldn't expect this. At any rate, the diacetyl was overpowering and really killed my enjoyment level on this.

Mouthfeel is light, clean and crisp. Drinkability at this ABV is extremely high. A bit hoppy for the style and a little on the sweet side but that just adds to the allure of this fine offering from Moonlight.

One of the better pils I've had from a US brewery, solid all around. It just didn't blow me away like I expected it to. Hype? Maybe.

I started to get into the style while I was on the east coast, and this definitely hangs with the top American stuff. Pours a clear gold with a fluffy white head. Bread and spicy noble hop aroma. The flavor is quite hoppy but with a nice fresh bread malt body to balance. The hops are pretty spicy and finish with a medium bitterness. There is a light mineral quality as well, the malt is very evocative of grain and fresh bread. Light bodied but not thin in the mouth. Very solid pilsener overall.","bulletrain76","May 11, 2009"

Spot-on crispy hop bitterness in the flavor, with a touch of bitterness in the mouthfeel. Picked up more of the perfume up front in the body.

It's a shame that they don't put out greater volume and some bottling would certainly be nice. Reality Czeck is an excellent beer and a bit of a surprise for someone who hasn't had many good lagers, like me. The beer is golden in color with a white head that leaves decent lacing. The aroma is very cleanly hoppy and crisp with freshness. There is some excellent pale malt balancing things out. The beer has wonderful grain flavors, almost the opposite of normal, stale macro pilseners. There are light hop notes, mostly pine and grass, with a slightly bitter finish of lemons. The malt and grain flavors are just right and so much better than cheap lagers that it's like night and day. You taste the fresh grains that go into this beer, and they're crisp and bready. The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, just right for a pilsener. It's a very easy beer to drink, one of the most sessionable beers that I've tried.","popery","Jan 05, 2009"

The taste is similar with a nice crispness, especially fresh and spicy hops for the style, and a long yeasty finish. Full and rounded, with the trademark softness of the Czech Pilsner style, but a bit spicier and tangier than Czech versions while not approaching the earthy bitterness and uber crispness of the German style. A bit spritzy on the moiuthfeel, not necessarily a bad thing. just a fine beer all around.","Georgiabeer","Sep 05, 2008"

Taste is better, some sweet maltiness, biscuit/toast in the middle, grass, floral, totally ripping herbal bitterness in the finish, along with a light salty/mineral character I was digging.

This is one of those beers where I can actually picture the hops and barley when I smell it. The flavor has good bitterness; actually a bit more than I expected for a light pilsener. Behind the bitterness is that same strong malt backbone that was in the aroma. Hop flavor is not very strong at all. The body is not quite as light as I would have expected, but still fairly light.

The taste closely mirrors the smell - bready pale malts and a surprisingly strong hop kick at the end that lingers on the palate for quite a while.

Some slight deviations and variations from the better home-spun Czech Pils style that those anal nit-pickers revel in, I ignore them all, for the simple reason that my first taste of this literally reminded and mentally transported me back to my first trip to (the then) Czechoslovakia. It had me eulogizing about those first half-litres of Pilsner Urquell, StaroBrno, Gambrinus and Budvar that I tried way back in 1991. In that respect, this is where the Reality Czeck wins hands down.

4.83,12.9,5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"22 oz bottle. Hand bottled via counter pressure filler. The beer is a brilliant straw yellow color with absolutely no haze at all. A massive carbonation is seen maintaining a finger of head over top of the brew. Very good looking beer. The nose brings a mild honey-kissed pilsener malt sweetness, a mild grainyness, and a solid herbal and spicy noble hop that really entices me to drink this one. As I sip it, I find this one brings an excellent herbal noble hop that moves to a moderate to strong bitterness. Behind this is a mild grainy character and a very subtle sweetness. The bitter lingers really nicely into the finish, drawing me back for more and more of this one. The balance here is fantastic. Definitely one of the best pilsener beers ever to grace my glass. After letting my palate sit for a minute after a drink, there is a sweetness that sticks to my tongue and works really well against the bitterness that clings. Mouthfeel is moderate with a very solid carbonation that breaks it up and keeps it feeling really light and smooth. Drinkability is top notch on this one. This is a beer I would love to see on tap so I could belly up and drink it till the keg was done. It is big in flavor, balance, and clarity. I really enjoy this beer. I believe the hype, and will be looking for this one when I hit California early next year. This is a great Czech pilsener.","kmpitz2","Nov 14, 2006"

4.73,10.5,4.5,4,5,5,5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" bright white head over the clear light golden brew. Head lasts very well, with ample artful delicate lacing. Aroma is pale grain sweetness upfront, giving way to Saaz crispness. Flavor is also light malts and crisp hoppiness, but I'm kind of at a loss to put into words how well everything melds together. Nary even an aftertaste, which often dooms some in the style. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, extra smooth, and drinkability is superb as well. If this is better on tap, I can't wait to make sure.","ppoitras","Nov 05, 2006"
4.33,1.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Reality Czech is my first Moonlight brew and I have to say that I'm impressed, especially with its balance and its drinkability. Not that I needed any more impetus, but savoring the final few ounces of this incredible beer leads me to cast my mind back to that too-long-delayed trip to Santa Rosa. In addition to wallowing in great food and great beer, I'd love to be able to thank RedwoodGeorge in person.","BuckeyeNation","Nov 02, 2006"
4.57,6.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is the ultimate session beer. Certainly, the best pilsner I've ever tried. The 22 oz. bottle provided by George filled two tall pils glasses which emptied in what seemed to be record time. Damn! This stuff is off the scale in drinkability.","merlin48","Oct 31, 2006"
4.5,5.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,5,"the things that makes this beer the stuff of legends are not excessively creative flavor blends or double extreme anything. it's the presentation of a fresh, flavorful session beer that incorporates massive amounts of taste, practically nothing off-kilter, and the ability to session the hell out of it. i would drink the shit out of this beer if it was available to me locally. a true treat and an excellent, green west coaster.","goodbyeohio","Oct 30, 2006"
4.64,8.4,4,5,5,4,4,"Drinkability will be questionable for lots of people. This is a VERY aggressive Pilsner, if you loved Sam Adams imperial Pilsner you will love this. If you like regular type lagers and try this as just a little stronger you will get shocked. This is A LOT stronger than most any lager you could name. Like a big hop smack you will love it; if you don't you will be over powered.","Zorro","Oct 27, 2006"
4.65,8.6,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"It poured hazy straw gold with lots of champagne bubbles. Light aroma of saaz hops. It had an earthy character. Mushrooms? Possibly a little green apple. . Taste is crisp clean. Very sparse. I detect that earthiness again in the flavor. Light, crisp and clean. With a biting tartness from the hops used. Extremely drinkable, this would be an unbelievable warm weather beer. It was worth the wait.","carln26","Apr 07, 2006"
4.5,5.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability Â– I ordered a round of three and somehow got four beers out of it. I bogarted the extra one and had no problem finishing it. Really, you canÂ’t stop at Flavor Bistro without ordering at least two of these Moonlight Brewing specials; one to down in three gulps out of sheer decadence and the other to drink like a gentleman.","RoyalT","Mar 26, 2006"
4.97,16.1,4.5,5,5,5,5,"[EDIT] I have since learned that no Saaz is used in this beer, rather an unlikely combination of American hops. It's still the best beer I have had to date, and I wish it were more accessible.","MaltyGoodness","Mar 07, 2006"

4.97,16.1,4.5,5,5,5,5,"I have been a fan of Moonlight since I randomly ordered a Death and Taxes during my first trip to Toronado about two years ago. When I order a moonlight, I expect a beer that is completely unorthodox with no definable style. The devil may care vibe of Moonlight always made it an interesting choice, and never a disappointment. But, unlike I am used to, Reality Czeck is a completely different. This is not a ""take"" on the pilsner style, it is not an americanized variation or a stylistic homage. It is a straight up Czeck pilsner, just the pinnacle of craft (that I have had so far). There is a refinement to a style I had passed on that makes this beer so damn enjoyable. Extremely versatile, damn delicious, world class.","axisjones","Aug 13, 2005"

This is probably the second best pilsner I have had, behind only Prima Pils. I wish it had been more carbonated, but it was still a good craft brewed pilsner.","OldSock","Jul 27, 2005"
4.85,13.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"As for drinkability - there's no real question. This pilsner may be difficult to find but it's worth the trip. Lunch at Flavor is quite affordable and I've already made a date to go back there in a week (for more Pils)","RedwoodGeorge","Jun 24, 2005"

5,16.8,5,5,5,5,5,"Fresh keg, tapped at Zeitgeist in the mission. Bright gold. Goldy gold, the most gold that fucking gold can get in a beer. Perfectly sized and contained head of thick egg cream white foam. Aromas are al that a pils should be, and nothing that a pils shouldn't be. Floral German/US hop varities lend this brew a great aroma of lemon, lime, bread dough, flowers, oranges, and more. The taste is a combination of the aromas but intensified, unified, and perfected. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to light with an intense small bubbled carbonation that never let's up lending this brew a perfect drinkability. Insanely drinkable. Refreshing and subtle, yet horribly complex and thought provoking. This is beer.","francisweizen","May 03, 2005"
