"Poured into a 16 oz. goblet. A gorgeous, deep golden color. Very little head, and what there was didn’t last long. Very little visual evidence of carbonation. An unusually strong smell of malted barley and Saaz hops. I could actually smell it at arms length in the bottle before I poured it! Taste is very sweet with a hint of sour after the swallow. I kept waiting for that strong hop bitterness that my nose detected earlier, but it was subtle and came on gradually. More complex than the better-known Czech pilsners that I’m used to drinking. Soft carbonation. Smooth, with a heavier body than I expected. Not very bitter, but what there is stays with you a long time. There’s a thick, buttery feel on the tongue long after the glass is empty. I’ve always loved Czech pilsners and I think I’ll be calling this one my favorite, at least for now. Easy drinking but with some complexity as well!"

"overall - 4/5 - Not a bad pilsener that is well supported by it's hops. Not the best Czech beer I've had and not the worst."
"O: Easy to drink and quite sessionable, I enjoyed this one and will likely have it again. It paired very nicely with some spicy food (hot wings) because of the resfreshing flavor."
""
"Overall a somewhat lackluster example of a czech pils. I doubt I will get it again."
""
"Overall - I like this beer. It's nothing out of the ordinary but it tastes good."
"Same ol' green bottle beer, I go get something in a brown bottle if you don't mind."
"A fairly satisfying Pilsener, fairly true to the style, but with a few rough edges remaining. Still, quite drinkable and sessionable, could be good for summer."
"This beer is drinkable but not more than that. The used hops are not the hops we like in Europe. The Germans do a better job."
"D - I hated drinking this. It didn't taste terrible, didn't smell very bad, but the ridiculous chunks and globs of yeast and whatever else that were floating around in this beer make thinking about drinking it very unpleasant and the actual act of drinking it even worse. Every time I would take a sip, I would close my lips around the glass as much as possible and cringe when a chunk would meet my lips. As reasonable as this beer may have been, I hated every second of drinking it."
"Tastes a bit bitter and lagery. There is some real yeastiness to it that overpowers everything. The malt profile is subtle and heavily sweet. Caramel and maybe some hints of crystal. Not bad overall taste. The mouthfeel is okay but the chunks are gross... Overall... okay but not good"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and quite sessionable - although it's very malty the beer isn't overly filling. I would definitely try this again because of its strong malty flavor."
"There are better czech pils."
"D: This is a nice and light beer that suits the warm night I drank it on. It's well balanced and offers some nice subtleties that emerge over time. A very nice Pils."
"D - Although this isn't going to set my world on fire, it's pretty drinkable. It would be a good pairing for a BBQ and some warm weather."
"Overall, not bad, but there are far better versions out there. It went down ok."
"Notes: I think I'm giving this beer a high score because it's over 100 degrees right now hahaha. But it's a good flavorful pilsner, and it is easy to drink."
"Poured from a green 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a golden color with a small head. Smell is a bit skunky. Taste is crisp, malats, finishing bitter, not a whole lot of flavor. Feels light in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fairly mediocre beer."
"It is an average beer."
"D - While this beer is far from fantastic, its drinkability is not so. Basically, this is a great contender for das boot, or any vessel over one liter."
"It's no wonder that A-B has fought with this brewery for decades over trademark issues. I can see that A-B likely fears a beer that seems more drinkable than the American Budweiser."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Average at best, the carbonation feels right at first... but a half hour into this tasting it begins to really flatten out. Flabby for the style, it doesn't qualify for me as a worthwhile food beer either. Again, I have no way of knowing the bottling date."
"B.B. Burgerbrau pours an orange color with a white head from a green 11.1 ounce bottle. The aroma is a mostly spicy hops and surprisingly doesn't seem to be skunky. Spicy hops are also noticeable in the flavor and the malt flavor is solid if mostly in the background. A nice light pils. Worth a try."
"Thanks"
"B.B. Bürgerbräu is a crystal clear golden lager with a small white head that dissipates. It has a soft, grassy, fruity aroma that's slightly sweet. It's light and very smooth and the finish is clean and crisp. It's has a very light sweetness and very light bitterness with a grassy, grainy flavor that leaves no aftertaste. It's a real quaffer."
"T- Kind of a fruity pilsner. I'm not sure, but there's like an appleish taste in there. I would not prefer this over most Czech Pilsners, but this is definitely quality."
"Poured a clear golden color with a generous head, minimal lacing. Smelled of pilsner malt and hops. Taste was clean and refreshing, but somewhat sweet for a pilsner I thought. Not as dry a finish as some. Mouthfeel was average for this style, and drinkablity was good, very smooth and easy to drink."
"On-tap at Tap and Table for $5/pint. This is a tasty and fresh Czech pilsener - something that's hard to some by. A lot of alleged Czech pils are really just bland macro lagers. There's a smooth, dry bready malt taste and the pils finishes with a mildly bitter spicy hop taste. Very nice and very refreshing. Pils-lovers should seek this out."
"There was barely any smell at all. The taste is smooth and lightly fruity, no hop taste at all. Smooth feel goes down real easy. This is a very easy drinking beer. It gets better the more you drink."
"A rather dry Pils...not much of a hop profile, predominantly dry and even a bit straw like. Head retention and lace are favorable but smell is a bit sour for the style, under my understanding. Keg code is current (July 11th 2009 expiration). An in code Pils should not have sour notes. But, in this case its actually quite refreshing. Its hot and muggy outside. It fits. But, if I were more objective, I would see this flaw in a more negative sense. Clean finishing makes it a great summer thirst quencher."
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a dry, pilsner malt scent with little hop aroma. It has an all malt scent. The taste is decent. It has a smooth, pilsner malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with next to no bitterness. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with a little less than adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good drinking lager. It was hoping for more hop character, but all in all, not bad."
"Overall - The bottle I have may be old? I cannot find a 'best by' or production date on it. It seems flat to me. I will try another in the future."
"The taste has a very light, but clean, consistent bready grain-malt backbone with a persistent hint of apple peels, but the herbal-grassy hop flavour and bitterness, clearly dominates without being overly strong. It has a lingering, engaging, lightly bitter herbal finish and aftertaste. It's crisp and lively, lacking the lightly oily, thicker quality of some like Budweiser Budvar."
"Prost!"
"D - Nearly perfect. On a warm late summer afternoon like this one, this hits the spot like no other. This one has session written all over it. I'm just pissed that I only have one bottle!"
"Bright yellow with a light island of foam after the pour and a uniform column of bubbles rising to the top. The aroma is good, clean pilsner malt with just a touch of lemony hops. Very even malts and a lightly inserted hop. A but watery tasting though. The water used was a bit too soft. I think just a touch of mineral dryness would make this pisner much more refreshing. Just the thing after a hard das work on a warm day."
"D: par excellence!"
"BB Burgerbrau is a great name, but a pretty good beer, a solid example of a Czech pilsner."
" D: Overall a decent, clean macro style lager with ok drinkability worthy of a moderate rating."
"Pours a mostly clear, golden body with a small offwhite head that leaves some sparse lacing. Aroma is enticing, but simple, with spicy and earthy hops and bready malts. Medium body is bolstered by the malt presence and carbonation is moderate. Sweet bready malts dominate the taste with a subdued hops bittering that is spicy and herbal. Very interesting for a pilsner. Very drinkable, even sessionable."
"Drinkability--Personally, I could drink this for hours, with or without food (not that I drink more than a glass often, but were I to...). It's a beautifully crafted beer. It's complex without being extreme or challenging, in the manner of good English pale to golden ales. It's definitely not an American beer, at either extreme--the big, brash, bold craft beers (hooray!) or the sweet mass-produced pap of Budweiser/Coors/etc (boo!). If drinking with food, I would have it with sourdough and a hard sheep's cheese."
"All in all a well-made pilsener whose strong point is the nice bitter finish. Lack of complexity will keep me from going out of my way to drink more."
"D: A good pils, probably won't buy again, but I liked it and glad I tried it. Would be an easy drinker on a hot summer day."
"Nothing very special about this beer, but very refreshing and a good crisp thirst quencher."
"D. Light and easy to drink."
"A bad looking pour, but a quaffable drinking lager. Id have another"
"OK, it's malty, but in line with Urquell and Budvar (as well as what I remember about Kumburak). Huge head, nice lace, hops are there, and leave almost a hint of peppery spiciness, but not overly floral. A great start to what looks to be a great rest of the day... :)"
"B.B. Burgerbrau was a good drinkable beer. It is a smooth beer with a mild hop taste and is nice for a summer day. Mild wheat taste to it, really refreshing. Overall, what one might expect for a basic Czech Pilsner. I'd buy it again. It reminds me of different German Pilsners that I have had before."
"Just an average beer here. Very mild grainy aroma that was difficult to really get a sense of as it seemed so faint. Not very crisp, hops are not really present, they seem to show up about half way through the bottle. But still faint. Color is a pale golden color typical of many beers of this style. Very average. I would not shell out import prices for this beer, if it were being served as the only beer at a party or on sale I would give it a go, but I would not go in search of it."
"Not bad, but I wouldn't seek this one out."
"Overall, it's decent enough, but pretty unremarkable. I think the delicate malty has probably declined in storage."
"A nice one for an easy ""sessionable"" - A classic example of a Czech pils. It would be nice if Bud tasted were like this."
"12 oz. bottle- color of golden yellow, with a quickly dissipating thin off-white head - nose of grass, skunk , slight skunk , slight oats , metallic , and melon soft taste of grass , lemon , some metal , and oats - body is soft , watery , slight acidity , and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of grass , lime zest , and metallic"
"Notes: Overall it was worthy of the purchase and I'll be happy to finish the entire sixer and enjoy every one. That being said it is slightly below average in my overall thoughts."
"Steve"
"Oh well."
"Drinkability: Drinkable, but nothing special to speak of. Drinks easy, but with such a lack of flavor, why bother?"
"D - I was surprised at how good this was. The sweetness was quite good."
"Aroma was strongly of sweet corn, and not beer. Flavor was a sweet maltiness that seemed artificial, and I did not care for it. Mouthfeel was a bit heavy and I didn't care for it. I did not find this beer to be fairly drinkable. I'd pick a Pilsner Urquell over this every day of the week and twice on Sunday."
"Overall flavor is a bit flat, despite being a clean and somewhat hoppy beer. Nothing really wrong with it, but lacked a certain umph. Also, my bottle said 4.7% rather than 5.0% ABV."
"Drinkability is OK but this is by no means a ""must try it"" beer. This is a good bitter Pilsner like I like them but it doesn't bring any spiciness to the party. Probably this is a FAR better beer in Europe but by the time it spends six weeks on a boat and who knows how long in a warehouse this is just a little better than average beer."
"Burgerbrau pours a crystal-clear golden robe beneath a short head of creamy bright-white foam. The head steadily settles into a wide, foamy collar that leaves only average lacing behind. The nose is grassy and floral over a bready malt... basic, clean, concise. The flavor offers a little more oomph with a wider, but still very straight-forward, maltiness and even stronger hop flavors. A bold bitterness balances it, and it finishes quite dry with a lingering bitterness that's strewn with grassy and spicy hop flavors. Although it might not turn heads, Burgerbrau is a solidly-made, very drinkable Czech pils that can't be argued with as an everyday pour. Nicely done!"
"I am always hopeful but wary when I reach for a European lager with a shiny, shiny label in green glass bottles. I am hopeful because fine and delicious brew is often found therein. Wary because as often as not, the beer has been treated to sub-optimum conditions and has become skunky. Sure this could happen to virtually any beer, but it is more common in central and eastern European lagers, because they have to travel so far, they use a lot of green glass, and a lot of hops. So I opened my B.B. Bürgerbräu with tempered expectations. What I got was just a very faint hint of the feared skunkiness, which I was willing to bear if the reward was good enough. Aside from the mild skunk, I found the aroma to be pleasantly perfumey-floral-hoppy. The flavor had a nicely full malty sweetness well countered by a healthy dose of hop bitterness, leaving a crisp, dry finish. It's not quite as rich as Czechvar (Budvar) or as spicy-hoppy as Pilsener-Urquell, but very easy to drink to be sure. Another solid Czech lager that I would happily drink again...if it's fresh."
"Served in a pilsner glass, the beer pours a golden/light amber color with a small white head. The aroma is grainy, biscuity, grassy hops and honey. First it tastes like grain and sweet malt, and then has a grassy hops aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and with moderate carbonation, and it is crisp and easy to drink. I think this is an OK beer overall."
"Drink-Ability: Not bad at all. Im a sucker for any Czech beer but what can I say Im Czech. Overall not the best Czech beer Ive had but still good."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Mouthfeel was somewhat zesty but the body was thin. I wanted to like this pilsner but it fell short."
"Drinkability is tops. The Czech, like the Germans, know how to brew a highly quaffable Pils. Great stuff!"
"Appearance & smell are typical of the style, bright gold with sudsy white flecks of foam, with a slight grassy hop smell that differentiates it a little. Taste is crisp and smooth, some hearty grain, floral hops, with a residual herbal note, and an impression of mineral water. Very easy to drink, truly a quintessential session pilsner..."
"A deep golden color, with an eighth of an inch head, that quickly fades away. The scent of roasted barley and malt are very dominant with a touch hop spiciness at the end. A very mild flavor at first, mostly of the barley and malt, then strong bite of biterness comes in right at the end and hits the palate. Very watery in the mouth, though a strong tingle from carbonation does hit the back of the throat. Fairly easy to drink and somewhat refreshing, but a lack flavor pulls this beer down."
"Pours a clear, golden yellow with a thin white head that retains ok. The aroma is grassy and grainy with a touch of biscuit, floral hops and some metallic notes. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with grass and grain notes upfront, along with some mild floral hops, corn, biscuit and some metallicity. The mouthfeel is light with moderate carbonation and drinkability is descent. An ok czech pilsner, not as brisk and hoppy as id hoped, but drinkable nonetheless."
"Overall, a slighty above average Czech Pilsner and quite drinkable, but was hoping for for a tad more."
"Drinkability: No real reason to get this over many of the others in the style."
" Not wonderful, but a capable example of the style. This is original enough to be interesting, although somewhat similar to Budvar, obviously."
"I was hoping for a beer of Budweiser Budvar (Czechvar) or Pilsner Urquell's elegance. But still this is a drinkabel pilsner."
"Pretty middle-of-the-road for it's style. Sure it has nice pilsner maltiness, noble hops, and quite clean, but it has no ass. Simply safe and simple. Medium on all aroma, taste, and texture profiles. Lightly grainy and nicely malty, spiced nicely with Saaz hops. It's a fine beer, but I would expect to be challenged with any of this beer's experiences."
"D: Not bad...not great. Fairly average, but better than American Budejovicer."
"Smooth, mild, aromatic and malty Czech lager. I prefer it to much more famous Budvar/Czechvar, for it's more complex and delicate. Lots of hoppy-flowery aroma with a subtle note of yeast. Round, a bit sweetish taste with merry hoppy aftertaste. The only really bad thing about it is the supply - can't find this beer when I really want it :("
"Overall: Simple and lacking in flavor and depth."
"A pretty simple beer made for easy drinking with a pretty good flavor."
"Overall a very drinkable pils. Typical of the style."
"Pours a watery, pale straw yellow with a minimal coating of white bubbles. Nose is stale malt and musty grass. Taste is more of the same, grassy and musty malt, a hint of bitter hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp. Skunky, bland Euro-lager. Not a fan at all. Must be too 'subtle' for my American tastes."
"500 ml brown bottle, bought in Denmark. ABV there is 4.7%. Golden colour, moderate head. Moderate aroma - some grass, flowers and honey. Flavour is fairly clean with a moderately hoppy finish, aftertaste does not last forever. An average drinkable pilsener, but not much more than that."
"B.B. Burgerbrau is supposed to be the forerunner of the modern day Budweiser (the American one). I'm not sure that's something to be proud of given how the 'King of Beers' tastes, but facts is facts and if the brewery wants to trumpet that particular fact from the highest mountaintop, more power to 'em. Frankly, neither one of them is worth a damn."
"Opinion: I was a little disappointed in this beer. It is really clean, and would show even the slightest flaw...so in that respect it is a good beer. The balance is really weak for even a lighter style of beer. I believe that it should start with a lot more depth in the malt to help round out the beer. It is an OK beer, but not one that I will be seeking out any time soon."
"This is a bad beer."
"Well, this beer is very easy to drink. It would make a nice session beer in the summer but as a Czech Pils worth going back for, I think not. Still, I wont turn one down. I purchased my bottle in Council Bluffs, IA. It is worth a try but it fails to represent its style to the fullest."
"The flavors in this brew fall on the borderline of subtle and bland. A bit more ""watery"" than I would expect from the Czechs, arguably the best pils brewers in the world. This is easy to drink, and the flavors that are here aren't bad, but it just seems that there isn't enough of them in this brew."
"D - Good drinkability / sessionability. Nice pilsner."
"Pours with a one-finger white head that goes quickly leaving no lace. Light carbonation and light bodied. Chrystal clear amber color. Grassy/skunky nose. Starts on the sweet side but then the grassy/skunkiness/hops kick in, typical euro pilsner and in a green bottle. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Mediocre, macro tasting, skunk fest, with a nice noble hop finish not too unlike Becks. Very good head for the style. Slow rising and steady carbonation. Slightly tart, metallic, medium bodied mouthfeel. Tastes likebeer. There seems to be real potential here but unfortunately this one falls ill to the European green bottle flu. Ill try it next time Im over there and see if there is any difference but for now this one is just average. Drank several bottles at a bar over a long period of time with the same result."
"The color is golden with a nice level of carbonation. Head is creamy and of medium height. Retention is okay. The aroma is clean, I was expecting skunk from the green bottle. Sweet, grainy smells dominate. The taste is dominated by sweet malts with an undercurrent of grainy, grassy flavor. Hop flavor most noticed at the beginning of a sip, other than that hop presence is much less than expected from a pils. A creamy mouthfeel is a plus and the drinkability is excellent."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce green glass Euro-style longneck with a pop-off crown, served in a Pilsner glass."
"This came fresh on tap at the Scottish Arms. It poured deep straw gold and was topped with a thick white champagne head. The aroma is dominated by noble hops, all flower, with just a touch of citrus. Taste is a wonderful hop punch, not overly bitter, just a nice fresh hop character. More orange citrus. Light slick mouth feel very quenching. This was the 2nd time Id enjoyed this beer this week. This time from proper glassware (nice fluted mug rather than thick glass one it came in last time). Really is nice to enjoy fresh draft pilsner."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a medium body. Really easy to drink and quite tasty. Definetly one of the better examples of the style I have yet to try. I could see this going nicely on a hot summer day out by the pool. Well worth looking into!"
"Overall Impression: Very drinkable, but green bottles must die."
"This is a quaffable import lager. Poured out to a rich golden color with a nice white foamy head and medium high carbonation. Some traces of lace in the glass. Aromas were weak, but notes of hops and grain were noted. Taste was simple yet enjoyable. Flavors of hops and grain are accented by the mild malt that is not too thick or overpowering. Mouthfeel is nice; crisp and light while still maintaining a good level of refreshing depth. Decent drinkability. This brew would be best consumed with some chicken or pizza, or as a summer brew. I think I may find myself back with this beer toward the warmer months of the year. Recommended."
"Mouthfeel is light and smooth. I like this specifically because it is not too sweet, a curse of too many standard lagers. Yeah, I'd put this into the lager category rather than a pilsner. I could definitely session this."
"So I learned more than I ever though about Burgerbrau yesterday. Gregg Glaser, the news editor of All About Beer magazine, asked me to pick up a six pack of this for his discussion at the World Beer Festival since his topic was beers in the news. After talking to the Southeast US representative for the brewery, he seemed surprisingly hesitant to offer his brew up. After talking to Greg, he explained why it was in the news -- apparently AB is suing them out in Europe for their use of the word Budweiser as one of the B's. He seemed cool after talking to Greg and the beer actually was very good. Much better than Pilsner Urquell. Beautifully light golden with excellent carbonation and very easy to drink. Seemed to be a positive experience with most everyone sitting through the discussion."
"Pours golden in color with a short white head that soon fades into a wispy lace. Nose is fresh grains with a bit of floral hops. A mild mustiness and earthiness is in the background. Fairly light in body though not too thin. Taste begins with lightly sweet malts followed by grassy hops that become more bitter towards the end of the taste. A pretty nice pilsner to be had here."
"Drinkability was pretty good. This would be a good session beer, if I liked lagers more. It was still pretty OK."
"The Demand. The people of the Czech Republic drink more beer per person than any other country in the world by far and beer is an integral part of their culture. They continuously set the highest standards for the quality of their national drink."
"The mouth is weak, just a hair above water. Drinkable, I could see this pairing well with a lot of different dishes, but overall its boring and I would rather try something else."
"The taste is great. A nice and pleasant floral, herbal, spicy hop with very little bitterness accompanied by a delightful sweetness. Very crisp and clean, and insanely drinkable. I will definitely buy more of this, particularly when in the company of swill-drinking friends."
"This beer is hard to find on BA, because as others have noted, the US import bottles list a diferent brewery all together. Thank god for the picture of the bottle! Anyway, the beer is a darn nice looking very gold (like a shiny coin). Since I poured it, I had a lovely inch of creamy white foam, but alas where did it go? Aroma is probably its bext feature: rich, bready, perfumey. Tastewise, it is not bad, maltyness tingued with some perfumey hops. The sweetness in the finish was a bit noticeable...perhaps a touch more sharp carbonation would have evened that out."
"An unexceptional beer, resembling pilsners from the Netherlands or Denmark more than a hoppy Czech pils."
"Pours a brilliantly clear gold color with copper highlights. The head is fairly thin, frothy and a pale off white color. The aroma is ever so slightly skunked and has notes of toasted malt and lightly spicy hops. The taste is fairly thin, with a bit of malty sweetness to it and a finish that spicy, herbal and a bit bitter. There is a certain bready, toasted maltiness here though it is competing with the thin wateriness of the body. There is a bit of light struck character in this beer as well, though it is not all that strong, thankfully. This is actually not too bad, not nearly as good as I was hopping for a Czech beer."
"Nice!"
"Pours a clear orange gold under a thin white head that fades quickly. The nose is nice - good malt and flowery hops mix. The mouth is light and prickly. There's a good malt opening, followed by a mild and somewhat metallic hoppiness. Mixed in here is more sweet than I would have expected. The aftertaste retains some of the mild bitterness, but fades quickly. This is an uninspired brew.."
