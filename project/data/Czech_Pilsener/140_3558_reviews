"Not up to Sierra Nevada's standard."
"Very refreshing. I like it more than helles because it's got more hop forward aroma and flavour. Too bad it's much more expensive and rarely available in Croatia compared to German and Czech lagers, because for surely I'd buy it often, especially in summer."
""
""
"Crisp summer lager a step above the popular macro beers. Not enough edge for a really high rating."

"Overall a tasty pilsner. Very light, good to drink with food or in the early afternoon.nice carbonation and no offensive flavors. If you can get Nooner, though, I suggest you get it instead"
"I honestly can't remember when I last had a pilsner, and I tried this after an afternoon of stouts and black IPAS, so...prolly not the best time to have had it. All I can say is that the taste is better than your average pilsner, and it was refreshing enough. Not sure if I would purchase again, but definitely not a bad beer by any means."

"drainpour....for me"
""
""
""
""
"It's been a while since I've had this, but I remember it being crisp like a summer beer should be, and just bitter enough that it had some unique character to it to set it apart from other summer brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A better example than most American breweries make as far as pilsners go. I would like to have a drier example with less honey sweetness. I wouldn't hesitate to buy again, but I know now that it is not going to satisfy my thirst for a good dry, hoppy pils."

"Tastes like a summer beer, a good and citrusy one at that."

"Pours a light yellow with a thin fizzy head that leaves trails down the glass. The smell is light but with scents of orange peel and a very dry hop scent. The taste was exceptionally clean and refreshing. Would definitely recommend getting."
""
""
""
"Another quality beer from Sierra Nevada!"

"O. This is a good rendition of its stile. However, it is a little light in flavor for me. I would recommend it though. Good buzz for 5.0%"

"Taste: A bit of hop assertiveness for the style which gives it some upside for the style but really you could do just as well saving yourself a few bucks and buy a 12 pack or even a case of Yuengling and save yourself some money. Now to drink all these ""summer"" beers before the end of the weekend. Challenge excepted. Now to find a bag of ice! It has to be served ice cold!"

"Light, crisp, clean body with nice sweetness on the back end"
""
""
"Crisp, clean, and dry. Very enjoyable, I can't believe it took me so long to finally try this beer. I can definatly see myself having one of these outside on a hot day."
"Overall- One of the best pilsners I've had so far.  Great balance and flavor between pilsner malts and the nice kick of floral hops at the end.  Perfect beer for the summer that's light, yet load with flavor. (92/100)"

"This is a light and fun beer overall, very fresh and crisp and it goes down well on a hot day."

"Pours a clear light golden color with a thin head and spotty lace.. the smell is grass, cracker, funky yeast.. the taste is sweet pale malt, corn, light hop.. light body.. this is a nice crisp beer but really only slightly more flavor then budweiser.. im a huge fan of the pilsner style and this isnt a great one.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours from the bottle a pale gold with a bubbly white head that leaves quickly. It smells of hay, grain and spice. This carries over to the taste, along with a light bit of citrus. Some sweet notes, too. It's fairly light on the tongue, with a pleasing amount of carbonation. It's not quite as substantial as a traditional pils, but is nearly perfect for a summer lager."

"Overall this is a good Pilsner, I would call it another winner from Sierra Nevada. It lacks the gritty, grainy, grassy taste you get at the finish of most Pilsners but that might be a positive for you; I, however, took off a few points for that. Nonetheless, I think you would find this refreshing on a hot summer day; I do."

"D - The appearance and aroma components are average at best, but the flavor and mouthfeel components are really really good... The end result is a very enjoyable summer offering in the form of a Czech Pilsner... Sierra Nevada turns out solid beer after solid beer and this one is no exception... Worthy of a six pack each and every summer..."
""
""
"M - Medium to high carbonation expected from this style. Finishes very crisp but starts very dry."

""
"Overall: Not as flavorful as Mama's Little Yella Pils, but certainly better than Heineken. Above-average pilsner, though I think it should be rated as an American pilsner, not Czech. Honestly, for the need this fulfills, a part of me would rather just by a less expensive AAL."

"I am from Germany, and I love German beers - this one for me is probably the closest US-brewed beer I have found to a good Bavarian beer. I love it, just wish they'd switch from those tiny bottles to regular 0.5l ones!!! Too bad it's neither easy to find here in MD nor particularly cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for :-)"

"Bright straw colored beer with soapy head. Really bready smell, some caramel and malts. Taste is light and crisp with tones of biscuit and black pepper spice. Mouthfeel is refreshing, creamy, buttery. I actually prefer this beer to any of the classic czech pilners and look for it every year, one of my favorite summer seasonals."
""
""
""
"Overall, this one is going in my bar as my Lager, so long as Sierra keeps brewing it, I will support them. If we ever want to challenge the InBev's of the world, we have to support the smaller breweries when they roll out a Lager."

"Overall, a very good summertime beer, crisp and refreshing."
"O - A decent choice for a lawnmower brew, especially since it now comes in cans. However, not one of my favorite Sierra Nevada beers or pilseners. I'll take the Kellerweis over this for a yard work libation any day of the week!"

" Overall a greatly earned 3.5 for Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager from Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. This is one the easiest drinking non-macro lagers I've ever had. Which is certainly not to say this brew is void of character. Quite the contrary. This is gonna be a staple in my fridge the rest of this seasom"

"This is a good beer, I would get it for a hot day as it is better than other similar summer beers I have had."
"As far as pale lagers go, this beer's got it all -- it's crisp, dry, chalky, lemony, with hints of grass. There's even some tangelo mid palate. Perfect balance of sweetness and noble hops, both of which are lightly done. Delicious and refreshing."
""
"O: a nice summer beer; it'll go down fast; not complex, but it's not intended to be; a nice hot weather beer;"
""
"O- Surprised how pleasant this beer is, most American attempts at a Czech pilsner that I've had has always had an off flavor but this is clean and very similar to Pilsner Urquell. Forget your American wheats, and fruit flavor extract beers, this is what I'd like to have in the ridge at all times during the summer. Wish I could find it in cans."
""
""
""
"O- Eh. Very unoffensive which wins it points in my book since a lot of the Czech pilsners I've had in the past have rubbed me the wrong way. While this one certainly isn't super satisfying, at least there's nothing there to turn me off from drinking the whole thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was expecting more from this brew, thus the lower scores. As a fan of Sierra Nevada's IPA styles I think I will stick to those from now on. But, this is a good summer beer after a long day's work. I guess one could call it a ""starter"" beer for someone looking to get into microbrews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice well balanced lager. Flavorful but not with the skunkynes or bitter that you expect from a classic Czech lager. Hints of citric add a nice touch of summer. Not a lot of co2 but on a hot day you would drink it right down before it went flat. Actually pretty jazzed ab out this beer and will make it my summer session beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A clean, refreshing beer with all the right pilsner elements."
"Awesome beer!"

"This is a great beer for the hot weather. It's 90 degrees out today and this sure hit the spot. This has always been a goodie from Sierra Nevada."
""
""
""
"Pours a medium straw color wit a decent sized white head that dissipates to wisps of foam on the top. spicy floral hop aroma with a light biscuity malt base. the flavor is crisp crackery bready malts with plenty of spicy hops to counter. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation. Nice hoppy light pilsener beer I quite enjoyed this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sierra Nevada Summerfest - another offering from this brewer that everybody seems to like but I just haven't found that beer they make that tingles my toes. For this one I found it run-of-the-mill when it came to its appearance, although it did pour a nice head with lacing. The odor was okay as well as the mouthfeel having a decent crispness about it. The taste was definitely the best part of the beer and at least that left me thinking there's probably an offering to look forward too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beautiful golden straw color on the pour. Wispy white finger of head. Nose is grassy, lemony, somewhat herbal but I'm not getting much spice. Taste is crisp and refreshing, just the right amount of hop bite to balance out the bready malt. A refreshing American lager."
""
"A well made lager with great characteristics of a European lager. If you enjoy beers like Stella Artois , Heineken try out this great beer . I highly recommend it !"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-easy drinking summer beer, a solid draft lager choice"
""
""
""
"Not my favorite beer. I like bitter beers as much as the next person, but this one (for me, anyway) is bitter without having enough flavor. The smell is nice, looks nice, but is just too bitter for me. I love dark beers and I love a deep, dark flavor, but I found this to be just bitter without too much taste. I definitely wouldn't want to drink this poolside in summer!"
""
""
""
"O: A great Czech pilsner. Incredibly drinkable and well balanced. Would love to see more pilsners from Sierra Nevada. Spot on."
""
""
"Bright yellow in color with good clarity. Poured with a dense white foam that reduced to a creamy cap. Fresh floral hop, grass, and light lemon zest aromas with a definitive biscuity malt backbone. Medium bodied with assertive, refreshing, palate cleansing carbonation. Fresh, light citrus hop flavor up front that quickly transitioned to floral and tangy, lightly spicy hops through the middle. Strong biscuity malt backbone throughout. Spicy hop flavors quickly subsided at the end as this finished crisply and dryly with a lingering biscuity malt and hop bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I could see myself drinking quite a lot of these. I normally drink IPA's and Belgian styles but I do like to have a good lager on hand, and this one fits the bill quite nicely. Win."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Wow, this is such a great freakin' beer, and what makes it (like so many other great beers) is it's sublime balance between the hop bite, malt sweetness, and creamy feel. No, it's flavor isn't incredibly complex: it's strength is in it's subtlety and harmony. This one is so easy to knock back it's ridiculous; perfect for a summer day or hell, any day. SN killed it with this one and I'll definitely be bummed when it's gone for the year."

"Overall: This beer is an extremely underrated offering from Sierra Nevada, primarily due to the style. The Czech pils style, like other light lager styles, showcases subtleties in the malts and hops and this brew does just that. You're not browbeaten with hops but the beer isn't thin and bland like macro lagers. This is an extremely well-crafted summer beer which is refreshing and flavorful. The perfect beer for grilling. Would highly recommend, especially for fans of Czech and German pils."

"Overall: most excellent. Compares equally with Czech Pilsners."
""

""
"Overall, this beer screams Summer. One can't beat the price so every year I've been nabbing at least a sixer of it for a good long time of my beer drinking life."
""
"Overall- I love this beer on a hot day. Perfect beer for those long summer days spent out in the sun. Very approachable and sessionable. Will be a standby for me this summer."
""

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Packaged 4/10/14. 5.0% ABV"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a bright yellow color. Minimal head retention. I expected it to taste a bit better, but definitely good for a lager. I was expecting more citrus notes but I can't detect any, it's a tad bit watery but I guess that is to be expected of this style. Found at Trader Joe's for 7.99 a 6 pack so a fair price. A good beer but don't think I would get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a pale clear gold with a fizzy white head. Minor retention a small amount of lacing. The aroma is equally mild, with light notes of bread and cut grass. The taste is also mild, but not lacking in any way. Nice bread with a mild light fruit and earthy hops. It has a light body and a crisp finish. A nice light-bodied full-flavored lager."
""
"Overall: A highly-recommended U.S.-based lager that is widely available. I look forward to its release each year and can’t wait for the canned version to hit my market. Slowly becoming a can’t-miss classic in my book."
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear very light amber (yellow) with a reasonable head. Laces well with poor retention. The nose is almost nonexistent, just a slight yeast fragrance. Light bodied with an above average carbonation level. The flavor profile is nice, but not complex. Against a very light biscuit background sweetness, the Saaz hop is noticeable but muted. The finish is clean and crisp with a nice effervescence that flows into a slight bitterness that lingers. A very good Pilsener, but not in the same league as Pilsner Urquell."
"12oz bottle from a sixer that cost $8.99. Light yellow color, fizzy, decent head. Aroma of lager yeast, bit of cracker. Flavor is lager yeast, malts, not much hoppiness that my amateur palate can detect. This is pretty crisp and refreshing though with a decent ABV so you can have a couple without getting throwed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice pilsner. Refreshing, no overwhelming or out of balance in any way. Still enough oomph to stand out from the BMCs, yet light enough to fit in perfectly well at a barbecue or poolside (hooray, cans!). I've a feeling I'll be drinking plenty of this all summer when not enjoying home brew."
""
"O) Uncharacteristic of Sierra, would not buy again, but overall a typical pilsner"
""
""
"O - Sierra Nevada nails the style. I could drink these all day. Well done!"
""
""
""
""
""
"o. Disappointed with the brand. There is nothing to really set this lager apart."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D very dirnkalbe, have lots."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer has a lot working for it, yet like many people in this world, the nose needs a little work. Perhaps it was this certain bottle but the scent was not very appealing, but the other characteristics certainly made up for this minor issue. It is good knowing you will have at least one good friend to spend a sunny afternoon with."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good American pilsner. The hop profile is not very German tasting, but this beer gets the spirit of the style correct regardless. This is because the mouthfeel is spot-on and the hops function in the same way as a traditional pilsner-- balancing the grassy malts with a spicy but never overpowering bitterness. Another good offering from one of the greatest and most reliable breweries in the States."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A refreshing highly drinkable lager. Probably more suited for an outside summer activity quencher than a sitting on the couch evening beer review."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M- As mentioned before, starts sweet but quickly becomes dry and crisp. At the finish, the hops provide a subtle bitterness that is easy to not notice since the beer is so easy to sip without putting much thought towards the taste."
""
"O: Yeah, this is really darned good. Every part of this contributes to a whole that is more than the sum. A very good expression of the light Czech/lager style."

"Overall/Comments: A truly refreshing and drinkable session beer that would go down easy on a hot summer day. Very tasty and well put together. Try it. Classified as a Czech Pilsner @ 5% ABV. Consumed 10/14/13."
""
"O - Sierra Nevada's nod to the Bohemian Pilsener is damn near spot-on with an overall crisp, clean drinkability and classic, simplistic flavor of honey-kissed malt and floral, lightly spicy hops balanced to perfection!"
""
"Seems like this would be a pretty good beer to have on the beach on a hot summers day, to bad it's in a bottle and that would be a very irresponsible thing to do."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 4/4/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, cracker, bread, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, pear, apple, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruits, cracker, bread, floral, grass, light pepper, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with good robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good pilsner style. All around well balanced flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"This may not be the beer geeks dream but it's a good sessionable beer."
""
"overall; not a drain pour but not a great beer, i think they were going for a unique, complex lager but the flavors just weren't great. not terrible for the summer but i wouldn't buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Very drinkable, hits the spot as most decent/good pilsners are. Flavor profile was nothing to beat home about, but definitely a beer I'd bring over as a gateway for those among us who are a little less adventurous."

"O - Solid Pilsener that is great to have around during the summer. Inexpensive, available in cans, clean taste. What more do you want?"
""
"Wonderful."
""
""
""
"Usually I'm a pretty big Sierra Nevada guy...but they could've been more imaginative here for a summer. The pilsner is good as far as pilsner are concerned. Straw golden color, goes down very easy, no frills. There is a very clean finish that is nice and makes it easy to have with food. Just somewhat boring."

""
"O - This is a good Summer drink, but I can't see preferring it over a Hefe (for my palate). It just strikes me as a little off: not a normal lager, some ale-like flavorings, but a pilsner format. It's a good combination, but not my favorite."

"O – This summer seasonal goes down easy. My number one beer so far in my quest for the Ultimate Summer Beer of 2013. This is what all those American adjunct lagers masquerading as pilsners wish they could one day grow up to be. I know this beer is listed as a Czech pilsner, but, in my mind, it is a classic American summer in a bottle."
""
""
""
""
"O: Im not a huge fan of the style, but this one was an enjoyable drink. Light enough to be refreshing, but flavorful enough to make it actually worth drinking. Nothing spectacular but worth a try."
""
""
""
"Overall a solid if unremarkable lager, great for a warm summer afternoon."
""
"O: Easy to drink and refreshing, a very enjoyable beer for the summer - I'm enjoying this one while I'm making and grilling up some burgers."
""

"Overall - Little low in the taste area but a great, drinkable summer beer."

"O-This is a pretty good slam-by-the-pool type beer and a wonderful choice for those who think they like macro or AAL and are scared by craft. My complaints include a lackluster appearance (where is the head?) and a bit too much sweetness for my preference in a pils."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a crisp beer with subtle hops with a good amount of drying on the end. Unfortunately, not much flavor in this one. It’s a bit toned down, even for a pilsner. I do prefer the true German or Czech versions of this beer, but still decent."
""
"overall, i guess i just cant see the good side of any lager... unless its a doppelbock or something. but this one was better than BMC, and I'd rather have had this than a glass of water."

"Light bodied with average carbonation. Crisp, smooth, and clean. An above average Pilsener, which I am glad I had a chance to try. I'm not sure if I would seek this out again, but I wouldn't refuse it either."
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest to lively amount of carbonation. This brew is light, crisp, refreshing and overall clean and enjoyable. Certainly a summertime offering worth checking out that is fitting and quite enjoyable."

"Overall - This is a good beer that fits perfectly with its summertime label. Smooth, clean, crisp, refreshing, all good qualities in the Midwestern summer heat. You could take this fishing, session it, very versatile. Not an outstanding beer, but good."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice beer. I might buy it again at some point, although I usually go for something a little darker or with more of a kick. But this was refreshing and a fitting compliment to my hot, humid apartment."

"S/T/M - Just a solid example of the style. Bright grassy, herbal hops backed up by a bready malt backbone and finishing crisp and clean with a bit of spice. Light to medium body, lively carbonation, smooth and easy drinking with plenty of flavor."
""
""
"I will continue my search for my summer beer"
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. As advertised, it is a crisp summer lager, but there's not much more to it than that. It does have the signature Sierra Nevada quality, but lacks the great flavor of many of their brews. In this one case I prefer winter over summer- their Celebration IPA is worth waiting for every winter."

"of all the summer pilsener/kolsch options here in texas, i'm not sure where this one ranks. but it's a can't-go-wrong choice because it's mighty good."

""

"Overall: there's no denying that this is a good-quality Czech pilsner, as one would expectr from Sierra Nevada. I would imagine it would probably be worth-while in the U.S. too, but at over AU$85 a case of 24, the price is completely unreasonable."
""
""
""
"O - A decent pilsener that I will certainly sample again on tap. Probably won't buy this in a 6'er, but will certainly enjoy in the future. Great summer beer that isn't gimmicky. A crisp and refreshing pilsener."

"I really like Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale and it is my go to beer when I want something with a little bite and bitterness. I think they should stick with what they know how to brew and stay away from doing a Lager in the future. I am still perplexed though at what so many people find appealing about this lager."
""
""
"It is a lot more consistent in taste than that of the bottle. You can definitely experience more of a full flavor, whereas the bottled version is a lot more mellow. I've had this beer on draft as well, and being that I am not a fan of lagers, I was also not a fan of this beer in any of its forms. I find that the taste is too bitter, as if licking a mahogany wood post. I just can't grasp the bitterness and wish that there was more to offer in terms of its flavor."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – On a hot day, this would be tough to beat. Overall though, it is pretty standard for the style. Has some light lemon and citrus notes that deviate it from the rest of the pack. But overall it is a nice, clean, refreshing pilsner. Perhaps greater than the sum of it's parts."

"It appears a golden yellow. Carbonation is good. Smells a of cereal and barley with a hint of citrus background. The flavor follows the nose with regards to cereal like quality. The finish is slightly sweet with a balanced bitter finish. A nicely balanced lager on the palate and a light body characteristic to lagers. Being the third year I've had this beer in a row, I feel as though this year's batch is a little more bitter than before, but the balance is there, it lacks complexity. A fine lager nonetheless."

"A damn good pilsner. I am not a to big a fan of Czech pilsners and have always shyed away from them. This one is an exception though. I will drink these over any mainstream brew any day of the week. Flavor,crisp, and satisfying."

"I give this beer a good grade because I think they capture the style well, without going totally overboard with the hops."
"O - I happened to have this beer on a relatively cool night while grilling up some BBQ chicken, but I've also had it playing lawn games on a hot afternoon. I find it to be a refreshing break from my IPAs and always look forward to this one, despite my hangups on the style."
""
"-Overall 3.50: One of the better lagers I have had in a long time. I like lagers but am certainly not enamored with the style. However, this beer is thirst-quenching and a delicious representation of what a lager can be."
""

""

"This is a go-to for the warmer months. A beer interesting enough to enjoy, yet simple enough to have more than one in a session."

"overall , im liking it a lot. pick it up at your local grocer for 13.99 a twelve I you can!"

"O: a crisp, refreshing offering from sierra nevada. doesn't blow my mind, but it's a very well done summer lager/pilsener. excellent to drink with food. good day-drinking session beer."
""
"Not my favorite from Sierra Nevada, but appropriate for the summer."
""
""
""
"Overall: A decent pils, but to be honest they all taste the same to me. If you want a great czech pilsener, nothing will beat a Staropramen, straight from Prague. I would buy one of those of this or any other light lager/pilsener anyday. With that said, this is a well balanced brew that I would drink after mowing the lawn."
""
"Overall a tasty pilsner that is as the name suggests perfect for the summer. A lot more spice than I had anticipated, seems to come from both the yeast and the hop."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nothing special to speak about. A sub-par Czech Pils."
""
""
"Best way I can describe this is as lemony (hops) corn Pops (subtle grains). I mean this in the best way possible. A good refresher and a good alternative to a thicker Sam Summer, or something else with too much hoppy dryness making the refreshment just out of reach."
""
"Overall, this is a great lawnmower beer. Perfect for those hot days out in the sun. If your looking for something that is going to be brimming with taste, this one is a little subdued. Can't wait to try it again though."
""
""
""
""
""
"[edit] had a few more since the review. It's growing on me. The Summerfest is pretty good; but I've found, that like a fine wine, you need to let it ""breathe," so the yeast oxigenates and mixes. It's lightly carbonated, but as the yeast dissolves when opened, it maintains the bubblieness and stays sharp."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is damn near perfect and is just a fine example of a proper Pils. It's drinking very fresh right now and for 6.99 a sixer it is unbeatable. Way underrated in my opinion."

"Pours a hazy golden yellow with a good medium fluffy lasting white head. Aroma and Taste of biscuit malt, grass and grains, some yeast and lemon citrus flavors with some mild bitter and tangy notes. Palate is medium crisp body with moderate carbonation. Finish is biscuit malt, grassy and grains, yeast with some lemon citrus flavors. Overall a good crisp and refreshing summer crew"

"Overall this is one of the few summer style beers that I still enjoy and will revisit year to year (along with Anchor Summer and Harpoon Summer). It is the perfect pairing for anything from a backyward BBQ to a nice dinner of Asian or Spanish cuisine. Not overly complex but above average flavor wise for the style."
"O: Not a bad summer brew at all. Def noticeable skunk, typical of the czech pilsner, but with a slight addition of citrus. Would def get this again."
"O: A great summer beer from Sierra Nevada. Crisp, light, flavorful, and highly drinkable. A perfect beer for a hot day."
""
"o- this is a very fine beer for a weekend afternoon, preferable with 90+ degrees temperatures."
""
""
""
"Tasty - a quality lager. The flavour/aroma is subtle but nicely balanced and drinkable. Good malt, and the hop aroma has a citrus edge to it. An unmistakeable 'SN' aroma lurks in the background - perhaps the yeast strain? At any rate, worthy of your time. Grab one if you see it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours a light straw with a massive 4 finger soapy head that never quite goes away. Substantial lacing is left on the glass. Smell is very subtle, but I picked up apples, fruits, and a floral aroma. Mouthfeel is excellent with lots of carbonation. Taste is malt and fruit, well balanced with nice hops on the finish. I recommend this one."
""

"This is one of the best pilsner style lagers I have ever had from an American brewery. I wish that it was a year round offering. The ""kick back on a summer night"" thing I think is more about marketing than anything. It is easy drinking but still quite complex. If you are accustomed to huge IPA's or stouts this may seem like a beginner beer. However, This can stand next to any pilsner in the world and command respect. This is no adjunct lager."
""
"O: Very drinkable but complex, just like Sierras Nevada does it. I like the style as well as their other brews. Too bad I took so long to try this, would have been a session beer for me. A very unique summer ale for those trying to deviate from the norm!"
""
""
""
""
"Delicate, quietly complex - not outstanding, but a decent and refreshing rendition."
""
"O - Sierra Nevada Summerfest is an enjoyable summer lager that will quench your thirst. Nothing outstanding, but solidly put together."
""
""
""
"O: A solid beer to stock your fridge with in the summertime; its refreshing quality and low ABV mean even a 12-pack of this wouldn't stick around too long."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a decent overall Lager. Sure there are many lagers I would rather have but this beats the big american beers any day. It is light and refreshing to drink on a summer day if you had them lying around."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I can't wait until summer comes to an end and breweries start pushing their fall and winter seasonals. That being said, this was a very interesting take on the pilsener style. In fact, it almost tastes like more of a 'Summer Ale' which is definitely what they were going for."
""
""
""
"Poured this into a tall pilsner glass – it’s a very clear gold with a very white head that settles down into a cap over a couple minutes. Carbonation is relatively sedate. Nose contains the usual suspects - faint lemon, honey, grass. For a pilsner the nose isn’t so spicy. The taste is great – floral and crisp and it has a nice bitter-sweet balance like any good summertime lager. Very crisp and leaves me wanting another sip. Given the right setting (hangin out on the roof with some friends and lawn chairs on a sunny day for instance) this beer would be absolutely perfect."
""
""
""
""
""
"Love this beer in the summer time. Golden color, light & crisp hoppy aroma - nothing special upfront - but a true delight to drink. It's got a mild hop kick to save it from being an ordinary pilsener and goes down nice and easy. A fantastic session beer for those summer nights with friends."
"This is an underrated beer and an underrated style."

"The beer is ""crisp"" as described, and it has just enough citrus to make it interesting. This beer does not make the common seasonal mistake of overpowering the drinker with gimmicky flavors. Overall it is a light and refreshing brew, that has good carbonation and is extremely smooth and drinkable. This is a great summer beer that you can drink during your BBQ or on your pool deck and not get sick of it. In a marketplace full of crappy breweries looking to make a buck during the summer, Sierra Nevada comes through with an offering that is different, refreshing and never lets you forget that you are drinking a ""beer."""
""
""
""
"O: Not impressed with this, it is refreshing though. It delivers on the promise printed on the label ""crisp summer lager."" Good thing the label doesn't say ""outstanding pilsner flavor, like you have never seen before!"" because then it would be lying. It tastes fine but isn't anything special. Easily sessionable and if I went to a friends house and they offered me one I wouldn't turn it down."
""
"O: this is a good beer and I would have this again"
"O=I will definitely try this again, as this is now the leading candidate for my summer seasonal beer--light but flavorful."
""
""
""
""

"O: Good summer beer, goes well with everything."

"O - This is a really nice pilsner and a great summer beer. Very drinkable and sessionable. Does Sierra Nevada really make anything less than good beers?"
""
"O - I had initially gotten bad macro lager taste and cardboard out of this. But later in the pack I got a pretty good flavor, a sweetish kind of malt and overall was just pretty tasty. I wonder what the difference was. The first four or five were just nothing beers but now I'm on board. Weird."
""
"Great for the heat wave we are currently stuck in. As this is refreshing, yet full flavored."
""
""

"O: I love this beer and buy it by the case in summer. You owe it to yourself to grab some. Even my Sierra Nevada hating friends like this one. This is a beer for everyone, even BMC folk will enjoy"
""
"O-nice, clean, well balanced pilsner. Go to beer for the summer time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- not quite up to par with the European Pilseners but a good effort."
""
"O: Disappointing translation of the style. The hops really don't push through enough to give this beer that nice crisp edge that really defines the Czech Pilsners."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't see how this beer gets low scores when comparing it to other beers of the style, or even comparing it to other related styles. It's a very good example of the style."
""
""
"Awesome smell, awesome taste. Just great all around. I do have one MAJOR problem with it though... The head is horrible. Almost as bad as Corona! UGH... It is only about 1/4inch and dies after one sip. I am pretty unfamiliar with beer, but I've been doing the 45 degree pour and keep getting horrible foam. The foam is one of the things I love about beer and it's not there! Sad because their pale ale has an excellent head and is my favorite beer. I don't know if pilseners require a special pour or what. But this is still a favorite."
""
""
""
"Slightly above average. An easy drinker that has some amount of flavor to it but nothing to write home about."
""
""
""
""
"Very good beer when you want a quality pils. No part is a standout, but together they all mix to become a somewhat unique beer. It's like Voltron for your mouth."
""
""
"Sierra Nevada Summerfest is a perfect pick for those who seek out a refreshing lager that is balanced. No frills, no thrills, just a clean lager with a nice dry spicy finish."
""
""
""
"O- Meh. I wouldn't buy it, but wouldn't turn it down. Certainly many other pilsners out there I would rather have. One of the few efforts from SN that underwhelms."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O--Not as good as some other summer beers I've had, but as a refrigerator staple for hot summer days it's hard to beat. It drinks like water (in a good way) and really hits the spot."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very easy to drink, escpecially on a 88 degree night like tonight. It's crisp, clean and refreshing. Has plenty of taste that a lot of summer seasonal beers lack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not offensive, but with significantly less character than other craft summer seasonals. After trying other ""summer beers"" this is not particularly compelling. Probably the first SN beer I haven't been impressed with."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good for cutting the grass or some outdoor activity and for the style."
"O - Couldn't tell any significant difference between having it from a fresh bottle on 2012-06-15 and on-tap 6 days earlier. It's a very refreshing and thirst quenching pils. Thumbs up although for the calories and flavor, I'd rather have a Troegs Sunshine Pils or a Pilsner Urquell."
"(originally reviewed: 06-20-2011)"
"O: Excellent summer beer. Perfect for the beach and BBQ. Sierra Nevada is always a solid choice."
"O - As usual, Sierra Nevada does not disappoint; nicely balanced and very refreshing on a hot day."
""
"Overall, the Sierra Nevada Summerfest is a great beer for the summertime. It's light enough in body to be refreshing during the hot summer months. The taste with the light and spicy floral hops reminds you that you're not drinking a macro lager!"

"O- This beer appeared flat, but it was just purchased yesterday. Other then that it wasn't bad. It had a nice crisp refreshing taste perfect for a summer beer. Light lemony/citrusy taste that was decently balanced with the hops. Nice beer for the summer, I definitely like it a little bit better then the Sam's Summer Ale. I wouldn't pay a lot at a bar for this beer, but it's decent to pick up for it's price. Not something I'd drink everyday, but maybe occasionally during the summers."

"Hayward Abbey Rating: 72"
"I find this year's edition (2014) to be a little bit lighter in flavor and mouthfeel than previous years. Maybe it's just me, but that's how it seems."

"O: I really can't get over how much better this beer is than I thought. This might become a summer regular for me. Deliciously well balanced and simple."
"Overall: actually a very satisfying pilsner. I would gladly have this again, especially on tap like this."
""
"Drink- I can see how people like this. Pretty crisp and clean. Step up from an AAL. Just not for me."
"Ov: Evaluating as a pilsner, it fails. It tastes very little like a pilsner. As a beer on its own, it is ok until you factor in the price. There are many other beers that can give you a similar experience. Not Sierra Nevada's best. But I can drink more than one. Cheers!"

"O: It isn't bad for what it is, but it isn't very good either. I like a good pilsner every now and then, but I prefer them with less dank earthiness and more zesty tartness. Still, it's quite drinkable, refreshing, and it hits the spot on a hot summer day...then again, so does SN's Kellerweis, which is 100x better in my opinion."
"O: SN does it again. This is an extremely flavorful and easy drinking pilsner, and one I could drink all the time. Cheers."
""
""
"O: Overall a good brew."
""
"O – Just too light, grainy, and watery for my tastes, although admittedly I may just not be the biggest fan of this style. At least you can taste the quality of the ingredients used; this is what BMC wishes it could taste like."
"O: A decent-tasting lager; nice pils, but nothing more. I’d be excited to see Sierra Nevada try something thicker in the lager department."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer pours clear yellow with a nice tall amount of white head. The smell and the taste match quite well. This beer is very grainy and crisp with an undeniable character from the lager yeast. It also has a light but present hop character which helps set this apart. Its easy drinking but it is to be expected. A nice summer beer."
"O- An extremely good summer beer, perfect for a hot summer day. Great beer for BBQs and another great beer from SN!"

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours pale straw with a large, frothy white head. There are lots of tiny bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates quickly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. There is pale roasted barley malt as well as some cracker in the aroma. There are some hops in the smell as well. The taste is bready from the malts and the hop flavor is not strong. There is some mild citrus from the hops, but this is not very noticeable. Overall, this is pretty basic, but still good. The body is light and the carbonation is abundant. The finish is crisp and dry. The drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very good beer. It is very drinkable and refreshing after a long, hot day. Have a few bottles of these chilled for your summer cookout or ready for you after you mowed your lawn."

"Taste follows the nose; it’s simple and seems almost underhopped for the style; a bit bland; some grassiness but feels like it needs a sharper hop definition and bite. Light breadiness; some floral and citrus, again plainer and less interesting than I’d like. Body was light and carbonation medium; I feel like this might be one of those beers I’d like more from a bottle than on-tap, as it felt smoother and less bubbly than I’d like for the style, taking away from the crispness and refreshing aspect of the beer."

"A well done Czech pilsener. Subtle, but clean crisp flavors. Easy drinking."
"O-This brew is perfect for summer days. I drank this after a long run. Great thirst quencher. It is what the macrobrews wish they were. Refreshing beer to have at a bbq. Some brews need to be consumed from the proper glasssware. However, this brew can be enjoyed right out of the bottle or a glass! Really drinkable. This beer is excellent. Cheers!"

"Notes: …good to push macro drinkers to a quality crisp offering. Not my thing per se, but it has a nice profile and feels rather good."

"Happy Mothers Day!"

"This is definitely my favorite summer session beer, and for good reason. It's not likely to wow or amaze, but you'd be hard-pressed to beat it in quality and drinkability."
""
"o: Not bad...seems more of an American version of a czech pils (ie. appears to be domestic malts). I prefer the continental malts with this style."
""
"After smelling the beer I almost threw the bottle against the wall, embarrased that I'm such a big Sierra man. The taste changed my mind. This is a light and easy beer to drink that lets me enjoy the hops, beer after beer."

"Pours an effervescent dark yellow, bubbles continually rising to the surface, with a thumbs width white head that sticks around for just a little while. Got the earthy, hay-like lager aroma with just a touch of sweetness from the malt. Interesting flavor to this, very drinkable. A nice dose of malty sweetness that has me thinking of the sugar from fruit, some hay, and little cereal. A creamy, active and crisp mouthfeel. Overall, alright beer but not one I need to drink again."
""
"Im glad I came back to this after my infatuation with extreme beers ended. its a nice American Session beer."
""
"Bottle in a pint glass. This is a light golden color and fizzy. Smells are light cereal grains and light white grape juice. The taste has a nice balance between sweet grains and crisp hops, but leans toward the sweet end. This is extremely drinkable and achieves what it set out to do. I would've liked a little more hop flavor, however."
""
""
"Pours a clear yellow with a 1/2 inch foamy off-white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots and streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, slight vegetal notes, and a subdued hop presence. Taste is of sweet malt and some herbal and earthy hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate that lingers after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good lager that is nice and refreshing for the hot Summer months."
"Overall I thought that this was a decent beer and a slightly above average example of the style, it had some good Pilsener like qualities but I could have gone without the lemon zest but I could see why that flavor would be in their summer beer. This beer had pretty good drinkability, it went down pretty smooth, and was crisp and refreshing, but it's a little to bitter for me to want to drink more then two in a row. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both very true to style and pretty well done. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma, the skunky aroma just seemed out of place and wasn't needed. This would be the kind of beer that I would order in a restaurant because it seems like it would go good with food, but it isn't something that I would need to buy another six pack of, but good when I want a crisp and refreshing brew, I recommend giving it a shot but the lemon zest might not be for everyone and I wasn't that thrilled about it. As far as Sierra Nevada beers go I would say that this one falls in the middle of the pack, not a bad beer by any means, but not that interesting even though it has some additional nontraditional flavors to it. In the end I think I prefer the more traditional Czech Pilsener's, but I am glad I gave this beer a shot, this was pretty different from the Pale Wheat Ales that most brewery's market as their Summer beer, keep up the good work guys."

"O- This tastes like what I wish Corona or other macro lagers would taste like. So refreshing, nice pilsner malt character, lemon, and spice notes. Very drinkable summer beer."
"O - Overall a refreshing beer for those summer days when you want to have some good brews but not overdo it. These would pair well with your typical BBQ fare, chicken, ribs, etc. To me this is what the macro's would brew if they actually cared. Or better yet, what most American's would want from their beers if *THEY* actually cared and the Pilsener style really was the beer of choice. Maybe in 100 years everybody will be drinking pale ales or something."
""
""
""
""
"This is what I would consider an epic fail on Sierra Nevada’s part. If they were looking for a way to make a more expensive version of Budweiser, then they have succeeded."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very tasty pilsner from a brewery known more for their hoppy ales. A great hot weather brew that is super refreshing and low on the ABV. Give one of these to your macro drinking friends, and show them the light! Cheers!"
"Cheers!!"
""
"Overall: A very nice lager, something to pull out on a 100 degree day with some real flavor. Just another fine beer from the guys at Sierra Nevada, nothing ground breaking, but always well above average."
""

""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, bottled date of 2087 (I guess sometime in March). This pours a light yellow color with a short lived white head. The smell is of grain and grass, slight hop. Feel is medium to light. Taste is good enough, grain, some grass hops."
""
"On tap. Pours a clear light amber with a small white head that has good lacing and retention. The aroma is biscuit, bread, a light mineral note, some grassy hops, and a bit of earthiness. The initial taste has a light sweetness. It is bready with earthy notes as well as some light floral hops. The finish is a bit doughy, but clean and dry. Light bodied. Medium-high carbonation."
""
""
"O: An easy drinking beer but not much more. Good for a party perhaps."
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Very light and definitely pretty drinkable. A touch of spicy hops followed by a lot of malt and grain flavor with a touch of breadiness. Luckily, the breadiness never overwhelmes the lighter flavors of this beer and it remains easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Now this is a lager. Not my favorite style of beer, but beers of this style don't get much better."
"I poured from a twelve ounce bottle into a glass and received a nice two finger thick white head of foam. The head faded quick, but left some decent lacing. The color was a nice clear golden tint. The aroma to me starts off with citrus and grass notes from the hops fading to some sweet malt. The taste is crisp with the bready malt and citrus and grass of the malt taking equal share of the flavor. There was no discernible metallic notes like on euro pilsners or lagers. The mouthfeel was nicely carbonated and light as to be expected from a pilsner. Over all this seasonal is a very drinkable beer. While it isn't outstanding... It is very solid, very crisp, and very refreshing. Too bad this one isn't a year round brew"
""
""
""
"I always look forward to this offering. It's a very clean and refined beer."
""
"O: Nice refreshing pilsener. Above average."
""
"O: A good, drinkable pilsner, there are definitely worse examples of this. Not incredibly interesting, but very easy to go through a six of this on a hot day. Very nice taste as well."
""
""
""
"a very refreshing summer beer with a little more flavor than its peers. pours a see through blonde color with a very prominent thick foaming white head into a pilsner glass. smells like a traditional pils, bready malts and balanced earthy hops. this one has a little bit of fruit in the nose and in the taste too, but without being sweet or even distracting. its almost like lemongrass in it, but its not quite strong enough to place exactly. love the malt profile on this one, its got plenty of flavor, some zest, and gives a medium body to an otherwise very light beer. great carbonation makes it down easy. a great summer session beer for those who need a bit more happening."
""
""
"Not bad at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet pale malt and earthy hops. Neither is overpowering and flavors balance out very well. The beer is light bodied and refreshing and finishes semi-dry. It's a great beer for a warm summer's day."

"2011 Summerfest. Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass, the beer is an insanely light, pale, bright yellow coloring that is slightly hazed, and the beer doesn't have a lick of head whatsoever. The nose is toasty, with some citrus and honey highlights. The beer's flavors are toasty, with lemon zest highlights and a very light spicing of clove. Decent flavors riding a light, crisp body. The aftertaste is more of the citrus and spice, with an effervescent feel to it. The beer has a clean, crisp finish. Great, light beer for hot days, with decent flavors compared to most of the style."

"The taste and mouth feel has nice carbonation, more malt in the profile now, hint of citrus very refreshing, clean, crisp finish and very easy to drink. A nice lawn mower/session beer during those summer months. Sierra Nevada definitely hit the target on this one."
"Pours a golden-yellow color with fingers width of head. Smells of lemon citrus and hops. This beer is very crisp and delicious. citrusy, spicy, with a bready malt character. Lots of carbonation. Good summer session beer. Very refreshing."
"O - Versatile beer that goes good for many occasions. Good hop presence to make it stand out from other lagers. Great for those who want flavor but find Sierra Nevada Pale Ale too agressive."
"D: Judging by the other reviews, this one almost certainly went bad..."
"An excellent lager with plenty of crisp, refreshing bitterness and a nice malt-hop balance. Very good."
"I would like to try this brewery fresh. Think it might be a bit delicate to handle the trans Pacific voyage."
"O: Great beer, never dissapointed by Sierra Nevada. Will buy again next year."
"O-- Knew this was a bit old when I bought this. Kind of a shame as even old it has flashes of being quite good. Very drinkable even with the age on this."
"O- I know what would be my first choice on a hot Summer's day, definitely could enjoy a few of these."
"Served this Pilsner on tap in a pint glass. Poured a nice gold clear color, nice thick white head, poor retention, decent lacing. Aroma smells of fresh cut grass, nice amount of piney hops! The taste of this pilsener is light in body, smooth, malty, dry, has a nice amount of piney hops. Surprise for a Summer Brew. Overall, awesome session beer, high marks for drinkability, great gateway beer, very nice on a hot summer day. Crisp, finish's dry."
"O: All in all, I'll start by saying, I'm not the best for judging these styles. I'm just not used to hunting for the subtle flavors that are characteristic of this type of style. I love bold flavors, so these subtle flavors kid of throw me off. I'm sure, according to stylistic standard, this is a great pilsner. However, according to my standards, I'm not really impressed. If you like lighter beers, you will enjoy this. You can pound this beer!"
"I bought this beer on sale for $7.99 for a 12 pack. This is my last beer and I'm sad to see it go. First off because it was such a bargain, and second of all because it's just a nice beer to drink. Can easily put back a 6 pack with no fatigue."
"Overall a nice summer lager."
"Overall, i do not like pilseners, however I really enjoyed this."
"O - The perfect thing for a hot summer day. Very light, refreshing and overall a pretty nice beer."
"Perhaps not as fresh as it could be, but still a very refreshing, flavoursome Pilsner, particularly suited to summer drinking."
"o: a great summer beer. I love pilsners and this was definitely a winner again this year."
"Light bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer is as drinkable as a Czech Pilsener should be. The carbonation is a little fizzy when the beer is held in the mouth, but does not take away from the flavors."
"Notes: My first SN beer and I am quite surprised at how modestly hopped this beer is. This doesn't fit my imagination of what West Coast beer is (but then again Anchor Steam surprised me too.). I guess my first reaction is disappointment, expecting more with bolder hoppiness. However I next am in awe of the sheer drinkability and balance of this beer. Not as bold as Troegs or Brooklyn, this beer is utterly and seductively sessionable. At 5% abv this is a beer that one could down bottle after bottle on a Summer day and all through the evening. What a pleasure to drink."
"O- Very refreshing, my favorite summer seasonal lager that I've had, more flavorful than Brooklyn and Sam Adams summer beers."
"O - I like the beer, and think it has refreshing summer beer qualities, but I find the dry bitterness in the finish to offset those thirst quenching properties. It's more of a beer to have with a meal than just to drink by the pool on a hot summer's day."
"When i poured this beer into a perfect pint glass, it has a wonderful golden body with a nice 2 finger white head, that last a long time. The smell is crisp and grassy. The taste is very inviting, of hops and some citrus, some malt too. The mouth feel is great, easy to drink and crisp with a little after taste on the back of the tongue. Overall this is a good, drinkable beer."
"O: Not overly complex but enjoyable and easy drinking."
"This is a pretty standard pilsner. Just another light summer offering."
"Clear gold with one finger of white head. Very dense tiny bubble lacing. Head recedes to a ring of white at the halfway point. Smell is grainy, grassy, and a hint of earthy hops. Taste is malty with a quick response of bitter hops. A bit of lemon and spice on the back of the tongue. Mouthfeel is good with plenty of carbonation for the style. Finish is medium dry with a lingering bitterness. Overall a nice West Coast take on a classic Pilsener. Very drinkable in the warmer weather. Good job SN!"
"Overall: A very solid summer lager from Sierra Nevada. It carries some of the trademark Sierra Nevada aggressive hopping, but like all their beer, it works. It's never overbearing and super refreshing. Lawnmower beer for sure."
"O-Overall this is very good beer. This is a beer i could drink multiples of, not to filling. Very smooth. Sort of leaves me wanting another one. I highly recommend this over any commercial lager.This is a very nice beer, especially to introduce someone to better beer with. Extremely refreshing."
"Overall: Good beer that is easy to drink. The taste is not too strong and allows for the flavors to reveal themselves. I enjoy the clean/crispness which would make it a good summer time beer."
"Poured a 2"" white head. Clear pale lemon yellow color. Really not much of a smell at all at first and as it warmed all I got was grass. Fairly standard BMC taste. In fact I don't even detect any of those common attributes of spice or citrus so often worked into summer brews, this really is just typical BMC. Crisp finish but not a standout. I expected more from Sierra Nevada."
"O- I come from the camp that pilasters are the best summer beers, Sierra Nevada's confirms my belief."
"Overall, this is a good summer lager. The nose could be a more complex, but the flavors are refreshing and well balanced."
"I opened this bottle on a day just like the label,and let me tell you it dont disappoint!Wonderful blonde/orange clear pilsner style that bubbles a frothy lacey head,you can already smell before it reaches your face. Detected a floral,malty odor with some sweetness and spice and blended together perfectly for a crisp taste that didnt leave me wanting a glass of water afterwards....,instead another not to tackle my thirst but for the pure enjoyment! Cant wait to mow the grass again next weekend."
"Overall: This is the first lager I've ever tried from Sierra Nevada, but it's not really thrilling me as much as their classic ale recipes. Still, it's a good American-made Czech pilsener style and would take this any day over any generic American lager macros that I've seen at countless parties and social events."
"O: This may be the most complex czech pilsener i've ever had."
"Overall- Give me another."
"Pours a golden yellow with lots of carbonation and minimal lacing and retention. The nose consists of lemon peel, biscuit, hay and sweet malts. The taste starts out with a lemon flavor that has floral hops, spices and sweetness mixed in. The mouthfeel is fresh, crisp and smooth and overall a good beer from Sierra Nevada if you are in the mood for a lighter drinking beer from them."
"O- A nice beer for the style, just maybe not my favorite hop/style. Still, this is a good beer to pick up for those hot summer months."
"Overall. A pretty decent summer lager. This would be a good one after some hardcore outdoor activities."
"Great mouthfeel in the end and overall this is one fine quencher!"
"Overall: An easy, refreshing summer beer. Nothing above and beyond here but definitely a beer I'd drink time and time again."
"This is what an American macro brew should taste like. Would I accept one if offered on a hot summer day? Gladly. Would I happily pluck one out of a cooler otherwise filled with Buds and Millers and Coors. Indeed, I would. Would I pay a premium micro brew price for this beer again? No, I would not."
"Frankly I can't get enough of this beer in the summer time and is my go-to summer quencher."
"O - Refreshing, good for a summer sipper."
"O: decent beer, refreshing, crisp"
"Overall - Refreshing for a summer evening but not all that tasty leaves me wanting more. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
" The flavor is smooth and malty up front, but mid-taste the flavor of the herbal hop emerges with some nice gentle grassy and tea like flavor, somewhat floral but not too much to be enjoyable with some citrus elements. The taste of the malt is gentle and slightly sweet with a mild yeast that adds some character to the brew and perhaps a tinge of mineral. The overall impression I get from this is it is a great beer, an all around flavorful and quaffable lager which is saying something because there aren't enough of its ilk out there these days."
"Overall: the sour and dryness takes away from the refreshing aspect most summer ales have. Not one of sierras best in my opinion."
"The beer is pale golden and crystal clear with a soapy white head. It smells of lemony/ grassy hops with grains and salt. It tastes bitter with the same lemon and grassy hops a smotth pilsner malt flavor washes over and there is a bitter finish. The beer is light and crisp with lots of carbonation and a dry finish. Excellent summer beer, excellent pilsner all around."
"O: Nice hot weather beer, refreshing."
"Overall: A very nice surprise. I'd drink more of this summer pilsner. Really enjoyed the little explosions of flavors."
"I'm an ale drinker -- lagers are not my style. That said I feel compelled to sample different lager/pilsners every summer. SummerFest is a must sample for me (as Sierra Nevada is my favorite brewery). The beer has a slightly deeper color than most lagers/pilsners and a reasonable amount of head for the style. I pick up grassy like aromas and hops in the scent. It’s a smooth beer with more pilsner characteristics than lager. It’s very smooth and very little aftertaste. Again, it’s not my style, but one of the better products in its class."
"Overall: They've made a consistent, highly drinkable pils for the right time of year. Sure, it's not breaking ground, but what it does, it does well. Excellent summer beer, but certainly not the best summer seasonal or even SN's best seasonal. Take it for what it is: Simple, clean, refreshing, and tasty."
"Overall: A tasty seasonal that I will look forward too next year."
"Overall - this is one of my favorite czech pilsners to date. For pilsner lovers, I highly recommend this one."
"A good, light summer beer. A decent pilsner, but you can definitely get some more flavorful beers for the price. Good for what it's going for, though."
"Pours a crystal clear yellow with a thin head that didn't stick around. Floral hops and definite note of honey on the nose, not fancy artisanal wildflower honey, honey from the plastic bear. Nice hop bitterness and flavor that I associate with Saaz hops, clean finish and nicely carbonated. This is a beer that I wasn't crazy about on the first sip but as it warmed a bit and I got to the end of the glass, I liked it more and more. Not the best summer seasonal on the planet, but especially if you are at a regular supermarket, you could do a lot worse than to pick up a six pack of this beer."
"Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager has a very thick, egg shell-colored head, and a hazy, yellow appearance with lots of bubbles and fine particulate matter floating about. The aroma is faint, but some slight breadiness is picked up. Taste is, at first, white bread, but hops explode in the mouth at the mid sip. It’s hard to distinguish the various hop varieties here, but the smooth bitterness is delicious. Mouthfeel is light, and Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager finishes crisp, refreshing, and semi-dry. I really liked it. RJT"
"O: A good pilsner, overall. Not the best in the world, but tasty and refreshing nonetheless."
"Clear, golden yellow with only a ring of tiny bubbles around the edges. Aroma contains lemon and grassy hops with a light freshly ground grain body. Flavor is crisp upfront with a strong carbonation tingle all the way to the finish. Hop character is dominant throughout. Sweet lemon upfront transitioning to grassy and finishing very dry and crisp. Malts are balanced and provide a solid sweetness to back the bold hop character. Overall a solid and bigger than expected malt body with a large hop character, for a lager. Big hop flavor for a crisp beer on a hot day."
"This summer lager pours a clear golden color topped by a thcik bright-white head that holds well and leaves a bit of lace. The aroma is both hoppy and malty, spicy and citrusy hops with some cracker like malts, very nice. The flavor is much the nose, soft, bready malt balanced by moderate hop bitterness and moderate spicy hop flavor. The beer finishes nicely balanced and just dry enough to make you want more immediately. The carbonation is moderate and body medium. Overall a very well crafted, one of the best summer offerings IMO."
"O: Tasty and east drinking, can't ask for much more, especially in the summer on a hot day. Probably wouldn't stock it in my fridge, but would gladly drink again."
"An all-around delicious beer; and, at 5% ABV, one that you won't feel guilty drinking from noon to midnight on these long summer days. It's nothing fancy, but it really hits the spot."
"It's a good summer refresher with enough flavor to satisfy one who's looking for it. It won't blow your socks off but it does it's job well. It would pair fantastically with a back porch fish fry."
"O: This could be a go to beer during a hot summer day at the beach or cookout. I wouldn't really go for it otherwise."
"Pours a light golden color. Nice head that dissipates quickly. Nice lacing. Smell is underpowering...clean, grassy, some hay. Taste is clean, with hops & floral notes...a little pine. Overall, a nice refreshing beer. It is very similar to their pale ale, only lighter and not as intense of a smell or taste. Perfect for hot weather when you want less intensity. Enjoyable. Would buy again."
"I love Sierra nevada Beers but this one kind of disappoint me. A nice crisp clear lager. Nice session beer. Barely any head. Perfect on a hot summer day. I believe this beer would grow on me but I remember having this beer last year and loving it. I am thinking they change it every year. Is this true?"
"This is a good, refreshing summer beer. It isn't super hoppy like most of SN's beers, but the hops are certainly there. If you need an easy drinking beer for your cookout, it's had to go wrong with this selection."
"Overall: This is a fantastic drinkable lager. I wish Sierra Nevada made this beer year round."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. It's one of my favorite Pilseners thus far. At right at 5% alcohol, this qualifies as a great summer session lager."
"O: Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It is perfect for the summer when it's hot outside. The balanced flavor combined with the crisp finish allow this beer to be equally refreshing and flavorful."
"If you’re in the mood for something light and crisp in the summer time, you might as well buy any American adjunct in your local gas station. There’s not much else that sets this apart. But they still have a lot of other great beers."
"O: This is a great example of the style. Having just been to the Czech Beer festival in Berlin, I would argue this competes with the originals."
"Poured a bright yet cloudy golden, little head. Smelled of hops, but just barely perceptible, not a huge scent. Tasted like a summer, czech pils should, dry, crisp, with some bitterness, mouthfeel was spot on. This was a really enjoyable quaff after a hot summer day. Nice job SN."
"Overall Impression- With Sierra Nevada being one of my favorite breweries, I knew this would be a great beer from the start! Clean, refreshing, and could enjoy this anytime! Decent drinkability and am glad I picked this up! Will be enjoying again when available."
"Overall – Probably one of the best 'summer beers' that I have had to date. It reminded me of a slightly toned down version of their Pale Ale. It's highly drinkable and the flavours are well balanced. I'd buy it again. Thanks for the bottle Swedes21"
"This is a classic summer beer. Not too challenging, and highly drinkable. I'm never necessarily looking forward to this beer, but I end up picking up a case every year just because it's so refreshing."
"Taste again more bread, taste of sour doe, must be the yeast. Grassy notes again with a little hop bitterness reminiscent of the grapefruit flavor hops SNB is famous for. Drinkable, refreshing yes. Out of this world brew that I'd go for every summer not so much."
"M: Not overly carbonated, and it isnt a palate spoiler. Would be nice in a backyard barbecue."
"the summerfest from sierra nevada is very mild and drinkable, like a good summer ale should be. The color is a golden straw. The smell is slightly citrus and mellow. I really like how mild the flavor is. compaired to the rest of sierra nevada's beers summerfest is very smooth. I like the mild alternative for a summer ale. Their ipas are nice but I like those more in the cooler months. I really like this beer."
"The body was a bit fuller than typical for the style. Drinkability was pretty good, the beer went down smooth and easy. Overall, this was a pretty good brew, although I would tend to grab a local version if I was in the mood for this style. A decent brew that's worth grabbing a sixer when you're in the mood."
"overall, while i wasn't overly impressed here i do think the summerfest is essentially what it should be: a light, crisp, refreshing, and relatively tasty summery beer."
"Notes: What a solid Czech Pilsner crisp well made and the dry finish is great. Cheers."
"Ho-hum at least it's better than a macro lager, nothing offensive, well balanced but for a craft lager is very raw and you can taste the adjunct grain in places. Hop character and feel are redeeming qualities."
"O: Crisp clean lager that would probably impress your macro-drinking friends. That being said, slightly too much residual sweetness for me. But if you bought me one, I wouldn't say no."
"Appearance is a clear golden straw with a billowy pale white head atop. Scents of fresh cut hay and some citrus make for an enjoyable smell. The taste is quite enjoyable as well - some lemon/lime flavors are noticeable, with a slight piney bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Very crisp and refreshing, very drinkable. The perfect beer for a cook out on a hot summer day. I'm generally not a big fan of pilseners, but I enjoyed this one."
"Overall- Wouldn't be one of my first summer beer choices and not on the top of my favorites from Sierra, but still a decent beer."
"Enjoyable enough to crack open a second."
"I haven't drank too many Czech Pilsners, but it seems to be a good example. I couldn't help but think this was an interpretation of an American adjunct lager. Then again, I'm not a huge fan of Pilseners and don't have much experience with the Czech style."
"Overall, not a great summer, but okay."
"Overall, a nice summer beer. Definitely could knock back a few of these while doing yard work."
"A good crisp clean lager for hot summer days. A nice spicy hoppiness is complimented well by a maltiness that is not over powering. A good, clean brew"
"This brew pours a clear golden color crested with a tiny head. The aroma is nice zesty hops and bready malts. The taste here is quite simply that of a solid Czech pilsner. Substantial noble hops and some slightly breadier malts than is typical for the style. The mouthfeel is well-carbonated and with a decent amount of thickness. The drinkability is very good. Overall, this is a solid and inexpensive Czech Pilsner. Nothing remarkable, but it won't let you down."
"Overall - pretty good ale, but again, I would suggest just getting their pale ale if you are new to the fold. However, if you have some experience with this brewer, then by all means, shake things up. It surely made my Thursday watching NBA finals quite exciting."
"Overall an average offering from SN."
"O - I picked this up as a requiem after another 100+ degree day. And ya know what? It works pretty well! Clean, crisp and very tasty."
"O-Good beer for a hot summer day, just nothing to thrilling. Would drink it again for a barbecue or something like that but something i will be excited to drink again."
"This beer pours a beautiful golden orange with a 1/2 inch foamy off-white head that dissipates only slightly as you finish. The smell is very impressive -- hoppy with a very slight hint of fruit. The taste is crisp with the perfect amount of carbonation; a great beer for the summer. Very easy to drink. Pick this up if you're looking for something refreshing."
"O-not a bad beer, there are no negative qualities, but it isn't too memorable. its a fairly boring beer. this would probably be best served along with a meal or something, but if you're going to just be drinking a beer, than this probably won't satisfy you. but as long as you do have something else to go along with this beer than i'd say you could probably drink a lot of them with out getting tired of it. compared to other pilsners, its just average."
"12 oz into a snifter...heck of a clean pour, golden and with a big billowy head that retains well. Looks like many classics of the style. Smell is well balanced in favor of the malt. Quite clean. Wish it had a little more yeast character, but otherwise it's quite solid. Taste is quite clean and sweet but well-balanced. Definitely a good one here. Mouthfeel is as advertised: crisp, clean, refreshing. Sierra Nevada almost never disappoints, and this is a highly recommended pilsener. Good for them, I know that lagering is not one of their specialties, so this is even more impressive for that reason."
"Overall-Very refreshing. Awesome summer beer. Extremely soothing after a long day of work."
"Overall a damn fine summer beer and it wont be my last time drinking it this summer."
"Taste is crips and smooth, citrussy. Has that element of pilsner, a little carbonation, but the added hops make it a more complex lager."
"Nice moderate carbonation, perhaps could be a bit higher?"
"D – I'm not a big Pilsner fan but this is a decent enough beer. Light, crisp, refreshing – good for a hot summer day, taking a break after mowing the lawn – a passable afternoon session beer."
"Not too bad, but not too gravitated towards it much either. It would do in a pinch on a hot day for sure."
"Crisp and clean carbonation and a light body makes this beer ideal for summer even if it lacks complexity or character."
"Mouthfeel is crisp with a lively carbonation a slightly drying finish. Overall, a very enjoyable and refreshing beer, ideal for a hot summers day but nothing really mind blowing about it either."
"A well crafted and enjoyable pilsner for the summertime. I'm always happy to pick these up for summer barbeques and it's a very easy beer to introduce to non-craft drinkers."
"O: The beer is easy to drink, but the taste would have been more interesting if it wasn’t dominated by the spiciness of the hops and there were some more malty flavors."
"clear golden color with a big pillowy white head that doesnt last long. smells of mild spice and grass. taste has a little spice up front with maybe a little lemon in there, cant really tell. good carbonation and very smooth. very enjoyable, cant believe it took me so long to finally buy a case of this."
"O: This beer drinks very easily and is perfect for the season. If you don't like most brewery's summer seasonals that, to be perfectly honest, seem to be geared towards females, give this one a shot."
"O-a good offering from SN, just not all that memorable..."
"M/D: Extremely drinkable light bodied pilsner with some style - well carbonated with a clean finish. For sure an all-day drinker for the warm summer months."
"The taste is very light and crisp. I get a very noticable spice taste on the tounge. The hop flavor is present but not overpowering. This beer has a bite to it that leaves as fast as it comes on. One of my favorite summer beers, I could drink this all day."
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied but pretty smooth drinking. High carbonation, but not too high. Overall a drinkable, non-offensive pilsner, but nothing outstanding."
"Enjoyable pilsner that I would buy again next summer."
"2011 Summerfest pours golden color with medium head. Smells of pines and tastes some hops. Very refreshing and seems like a typical Sierra Nevada beer, very simple yet refreshing. Summerfest is especially suited for the season it is named after. Unfortunately I don't get any other aromas than pine and hops. I would love to have a lager go to but all lagers taste the same to me."
"Pours out a straw yellow color. It has a definite grain smell to it, as well as a definite note of the hops. Has the familiar pilsner sting to the taste, and this does stay with you like it does most pilsners. For a cross between a pilsner and a lager, it isn't bad though I think I would go with one or the other. Still, for what it is, it's not bad, and something I would drink again."
"Overall: A good take on a summer lager from SN."
"O) I could see myself enjoying this one on the patio all summer."
"Delicious and enjoyable. This is damned-near the ideal summer lager."
"2011. Pours a clear, bright golden color with a large white head that goes down quite quickly. Scent is grainy with some hints of lemon, grass, and hops. A very subtle and inviting lager. Taste is initially a bit on the floral side with some nice hints of grain and lemon. Then I get some hop flavors and nice grassy notes. This beer is very well-balanced with its flavors. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a very crisp finish. Extremely refreshing. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is an OUTSTANDING beer for summer heat and just a great representation of the style."
"O: A very drinkable “summer” lager - this one tops Sam Adams Noble Pils in my book... a great, clean pilsner with an impressive amount of flavor. Tasty."
"Overall: Not the best beer on earth, but a truly remarkable example of a Czech Pils. Sierra Nevada continues their tradition of tasty brews."
"Taste is crisp and clean with some good good light malts. It's super drinkable and tasty. Very solid summer beer."
"A good lager. I would purchase this one again."
"O - I can't really knock this brew for any specific element, because it is pretty good. That said, I am not crazy about it."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, easy on the tongue. Drinks okay, but pretty boring flavor and forgettable overall."
"Overall - I thought this beer was quite good. Nothing over the top or fantastic, but a great beer on a hot, summer-like day"
"O - I've been drinking too many IPA's, DIPA's, and Barley Wines, so it took this review to remind me that I do actually enjoy Lagers. Sierra Nevada always seems a little 'hoppier' than most in all their offerings...it's what I love about them. This Lager is very refreshing, and has a nice, well balanced taste. A great choice after mowing my yard."
"Overall this beer is nice and refreshing, however I personally enjoy a little bit more bitter hop characteristic in a Pilsner than this has to offer, but I after buying a six-pack I wont be disappointed to have this again on a hot summer day."
"O: Great summer beer. By definition, I think summer beers should be on the lighter side in terms of flavor, body, and abv - nobody wants drinking beer(s) to become a chore in the heat. If you like their pale ale, you will love this seasonal. Could/will definitely session these. The best thing about this beer is that literally everyone i know loves it! Can't go wrong keeping these in the fridge or bringing them to a bbq/party. Newbies, girls, the seasoned beer drinker, and everyone in between has given this the best acclaim anyone can give a beer: they always ask for another."
"O (D) - This could be a go-to summer beer. Tasty, interesting, hoppy, not too expensive. GOod beer."
"O - Sierra Nevada creates another well rounded brew. Nothing earth shattering but a good session brew and despite its name, one for year round."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Bright yellow appearance with a subtle head that fades quickly. Slight hint of hops in the scent along with a barely noticeable spiciness. Tasted like a weak Czech Pilsener. Didn't have the hop profile I would expect from a beer of this style. Had a very light mouthfeel and was an easy drinker. I felt like I could drink several of these in one sitting and not get filled up."
"Pours a macrolager-like yellow/green straw color with a thin sudsy head. Nose of straw and light citrus hops. Richer flavor than the color would suggest, nicely malty, medium bodied lager. Front porch beer, refreshing with good flavor. Nothing earthshattering here but a perfectly good summer session beer."
"O: It's good. a real palate cleanser. Got better as it warmed. nice for a warm evening like tonight."
"O: All the flavors are right, but the volume is down too low. Underwhelming, but still decent. Would probably go best on a day when it's hot and you need something cold-- this would fill the bill. Goes down smoothly and easily."
"Overall: A very good pilsner, though I have certainly have better. A little too malty vs hoppy. Would recommend to a friend."
"A crisp and refreshing lager, if not a bit mundane."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pale yellow color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, a touch sweet. Taste is crisp, very refreshing, a bit of sweetness with a tad bit of bitterness at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"SN's summer offering's best quality is that it doesn't try to be too complex, but at the same time it's a lager that even a beer geek will find himself never getting bored with. It's drinkability is exceptional, and it therefore always has a place in my fridge during the warm months of the year. Only problem is...I wish this was a year-round offering."
"Overall I was surprised how low the bitterness of the hops were but how they stuck on the back of your tongue for a minute after sipping. Certainly one of the better tasting pilsners I have had!"
"This is very crisp and smooth upfront giving way to a bitter finish in the back. Whole grain buttery bread up front, followed by bitter greens. a delightful brew."
"It honestly reminds me too much of a BMC, just a few notches above in the hop profile. I'm conflicted - it's a solid beer, but it's got lawnmower overtones and for the price, I'd rather just have a BMC...I can't believe I just wrote that."
"The aftertaste is satisfyingly bitter, with an oily hoppiness that lasts for a good while."
"On tap. Pours a translucent staw color with an inch of head. Good amount of lacing. Aroma is of lemon, earthy, and grains. Tastes like a pilsener but with a bit more hops and some lemon. Nice bitter finish. Earthy flavor as well as some cut grass. Smooth, crisp and easy to drink pilsener with a good amount of flavor. Perfect for summer, obviously. Overall, I dig it and look forward to having some more."
"Taste is more complex than your normal pilsener or lager with a small hoppy bitterness that balances out a fun little maltiness. both flavors are pretty subtle but create a really solid and refreshing beer on a hot summer day. With a perfect crisp and totatlly refreshing mouthfeel, this beer becomes one of my favorites to simply enjoy when I'm relaxing in the summer. It's fairly simple and concise, leaving me to enjoy a decent beer that's also refreshing."
"Overall I can't say I'm that impressed. I've had other 5% ABV pilseners that blow this one out of the water. Might even be too bitter/sour for non-craft drinkers."
"Sierra Nevada Brewing Company 2011 Summerfest Lager. 4 oz. Taster @ Fremont, Seattle Hop Scotch Beer & Scotch Festival on 4/1/2011. 5.00% ABV. 28 IBU's. Very thin white head. Clear bright thin yellow gold color. Crisp Saaz hop aroma. Thin textured mild sweet zesty all malt body. Crisp balanced smooth mild hop spice end. Nice Pale Lager. (3.5 / 5.0)"
"A very nice and delicate spicy nose with hints of grassy and floral hops I also get that European Pilsner grainy smell. Taste is so refreshing with that spicy hop in the beginning and a nice tangy bitterness to go along with that bready almost wheat like pilsner malt. The best thing about this is the mouthfeel in my opinion. Its been lagered for a while and you can tell. It almost gives off that creamy Samuel Adams Boston Lager type body which I think a lot of Pilsners are missing. This long lagering period that they speak of is really the highlight of this beer when compared to the other amazing Pilsners like Noble Pils and Prima Pils. This is one of my favorite summer beers of all time. So crisp refreshing and such a nice herbal bitterness for a low IBU. Top notch beer from Sierra Nevada."
"D/O: Very easy to drink, and quite quaffable to boot. I am normally not a huge lager fan, but I can make an exception for this"
"Morey's Bottom Line: I would definitely consider picking up a sixer of this if I was having a BBQ."
"Beer poured a crystal clear pale yellow with a small head that quickly disapeared. Smell was buscuit malt with a hint of herbal and grassy hops. Taste was a nice balance of hops and sweet malt nothing over the top. Mouthfeel was clean and crisp, dry yet very refreshing. Very light body and good level carbonation. Overall a very nice go to lager could perhaps be a bit bolder but is a great summer refreshing beer, complimented my waffle fries and brats nicely."
"Nice light summer time beer. Nothing over the top. Nicely balanced. A clear pale colored beer with a nice creamy head and nice retention and lacing. Faint smell. Be careful not to snort it up your nose trying to smell. Biscuits and earthy, grassy notes. Some floral notes. The taste is pretty average pale ale with a bit more citrus notes than most. Faintly bitter, biscuity and grassy with some earthy notes. Pretty average, but refreshing. light and easy to drink."
"As I said, straight-forward. SN should do some more bottled lagers. Nicely done."
"O: This is a very drinkable lager. I could easily see myself downing a 6 pack of these on a hot summer day. Very drinkable and very refreshing. I definitely will buy more of this if I can find it."
"Overall: A nice summer session beer. Perfect for putting away several or just taking a break from the heavier offerings out there."
"Overall- A nice refreshing lager, excellent beer after a hard days work in the summer heat. Would recommend and and purchase this beer time and again."
"D- Its a good drinkable pilsner, these are great refreshing beers and sierra nevada knocked this one out of the park."
"O - This has pretty good drinkability. It goes down easy and tastes pretty good. It's a pretty standard pilsner. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting. I think they would be great on a hot sunny day. Not the best I've had of the style, but I'd try it again."
"What a bummer, I was so pumped to try this beer when I show it on the shelves at my local shop. Got it home and gave it go after it was chilled. I found myself asking if this was really a Sierra Nevada product. I understand the beer is supposed to be light and refreshing for the time of year but, This was really light and along the weak side for me. There really wasn't a whole lot of hops in this from what I could get from it. The Color was a light yellow and very clean looking. Thin head. I know the style of beer is supposed to be like this but I thought SN would have amped something up just a little to give it a bit more of a punch."
"Overall, Summerfest is an average, but not exceptional, pilsener. It goes down easily, with a dry, crisp finish. As the name suggests, this is a good choice for the summer, but there are better alternatives out there, as this is slightly better than average."
"Poured a clear pale yellow in color with a nice frothy head that dissapated slowly.The aroma was that of grass and citrus. The flavor was mildly bitter with a nice hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel was creamy and refreshing. Overall a nice summer brew but nothing special. Would be good on a hot day!!"
"Highly drinkable. has a different taste then most pilsners styles out there. this is something i would love to drink at a party or anywhere for that matter. I like it."
"D: I didn't think this was all that amazing. Great for the summer time and one could definitely drink a lot of these. However, it just seems like an amp up version of a BMC."
"Fuller bodied than expected with a nice crisp hop bite up front that lingers throughout over the sweet malt body into a slightly dry, refreshing finish. Dry bitter hops up front countered by sweet pale malts and crisp light fruit notes, especially apple and pear. Slight bready yeast with faint grassy straw notes. Very quaffable especially in hot summer weather."
"Drinkability - without a doubt very drinkable."
"Just near the end the hops seem to go a bit piney. Its very interesting the range of flavors that are present in the beer from only two hop varietals. They're bold, but not overpowering, striking an excellent balance. The finish is clean and very refreshing. This is an excellent Summer drinking beer."
"SN is a great brewery, but stay the hell away from this one!"
"12 oz bottle. Pours straw color with a huge white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is of hay, herbal hops and some malt. Light, crisp body. Floral hops dominate the flavor with malt provide good balance. Long, hoppy finish. Nice summer session brew."
"Big grassy aroma on the pour. Color is clear straw and head unremarkable. Second whiff gives up light malty goodness with a tinge of lemon. Sweet, grainy, bready, herbal hop with a good bitter bite. Light, smooth body without being watery. Very drinkable, light brew with a decent flavour."
"Pours a clear straw color with plenty of visible carbonation and a nice white head. Some decent lacing on the way down. The nose brings a good dose of Noble hops as well as some fresh grain. The hops are key here and add a real zest to this. Nice floral characteristics. A bit of straw and grain in the background. Nice and crisp, this is a really easy-drinking brew."
"Not a bad summer lager. Everything is good except the finish."
"Fresh, bright, and flavorful, with a super easy body and overall drinkibility going for it, this was a pleasant quaff. Another sturdy entry from Sierra Nevada."
"Notes - Good thin to medium mouthfeel and good carbonation."
"Medium body, with moderate-to-high carbonation. Certainly effervescent, and quite crisp. This one is a quick drinker, and as the label suggests, ideal for summer."
"A very tasty summer lager. I could definitely drink a few of these on a hot day. Would go great with some bbq."
"It finishes with a slight bitterness."
"The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of grassy hops and pilsener malt. The flavor is more of the same. I get some grassy and earthy hops as well as some biscuit malt. Low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Easy drinking and would be nice on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability is good, I'd definitely have a few more of these. A pretty tasty first foray into Czech pilseners for me. Almost like a light version of an IPA, at least in my humble opinion."
"Atmosphere is pretty nice. Giant foamy head, and a nice light sweet floral nose. Flavor is not complicated, but nicely done combination of subtle bitter and grain components. Overall, this is a really nice quaff."
"Notes: Very good price for a well crafted beer!"
"D-check, great summer beer"
"This brew pours a pale golden straw hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a one finger head with a rim of lacing,the smell is a mix of lemon/citrus and sweet malts,it has a nice light very sessionable mouthfeel to it with tastes of lemon zest,orange,spicy herbal hops and is rounded out with a sweet biscuty malt finish,overall even though there is nothing wrong with this brew they definately have better beers and if this was abit cheaper i could see this as a nice session beer especially for the summer."
"This is a very good summer refresher. Flavorful, crisp and delicious. Definitely great when ice cold."
"D - Very. Easy easy easy."
"Note: From some other reviews, I see this previously was labeled a pale lager, not a Czech Pilsener. I'd give it half a point in taste if it's measured against that style."
"D-Pretty easy to drink could have a couple."
"No, but it's more of a style prejudice."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is good and thick but is easily swallowed (making this a great lawnmower beer) and very drinkable. However, unless you're trying to make a statement unless a far less expensive macro, I would just purchase those instead of this."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being high. Drinkability is pretty decent, it has a very nice balance of flavors working in it's favor. Pretty good version of the style and a easy drinking beer overall."
"A decent quaff, but kind of heavy, and not quite as refreshing as one would expect from a Czech Pilsener."
"The bottle claims that this lager is crisp and refreshing.... it is. Nice job SN!"
"Served in a pint glass. I like a good pilsner and this one is. Hops are balanced well against a malty dry taste. The color is slightly deeper yellow other pilsners. This beer is very refreshing, though I have a difficult time justifying paying mirco-brew prices for a pilsner. Nevertheless, this one is just as good as any of the quality German imports, such as Spaten."
"Ah, the Whole Foods bargain area. Delightful. This guy pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger or so of white micro-foam. The nose comprises light wheat, flowers, corn, grass, and a touch of sugar. The taste is similar, with the floral hops really coming through nicely, along with a hint of oatmeal. The body is pretty light, with a very light carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, a solid pils, but missing a small something in the taste department to really kick it up a peg."
"D: Good beer."
"I don't think I'd buy this again, not with better cheaper pilsners out there (Sam Adams Noble Pils, I'm looking at you). In fact, I didn't buy it the first time. I swapped one bottle of my Sierra Nevada Kellerweis Hefeweizen at a party with a guy who brought Summerfest. Alright pilsner, but buy on sale if you can."
"Quite a refreshing beer. Pours a clear golden colored with an active, pocket-filled head. Smells florally fragrant and lightly hoppy when cold and then a sweet grainy aroma comes through once it picks up in temperature. It's got a nice sweetness with just a touch of bitter hops. Very active carbonation to this light-bodied beer and it's quite gassy, so I pace myself with these. Very enjoyable."
"D: A very good representation of the style... I'd like to see a bit of a thicker and longer-lasting head, but otherwise it's quite spot-on."
"Clear, golden yellow, fluffy white head, some retention & lace. Acidic, soapy/floral hops. Slightly sweet, slight soapy/floral hop flavour. Needs some more bready maltyness and bitterness. It's just too light for a Pils. Light to moderate body, moderate carbonation. Approachable & quite quaffable, but it doesn't bring me back for more."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch and a half of white head. The beer is a nice golden color. The smell has that ""European"" pilsner smell to it. It is grassy and grainy. The taste definately reminds me of Bavarian beer. It is crisp and clean with some grassy flavor. It is an ok beer. It's just not a style that I seek or crave."
"I think this one earned its pretty high marks from me."
"I bought this as an experimental sixer from Hy-Vee, and I wish I had read the label first. I'm not a huge fan of pilsners to begin with, and this is an explosion of the classic pilsner taste. There's some hops and grain and that's about it. It actually seemed a bit sour. Call me a hater if you want, but this is NOT going to be in my fridge ever again."
"From a 12 oz bottle into my Sam Adams glass (thanks, guys!). Pale yellow color with minor head of tan foam. Nose of bready malt and a touch of crisp hops. In the mouth, a bit more bready than expected along with subdued hops yields ho-hum flavor. Crisp and quenching but nothing special. Drinkable? Sure, but after one there's little to bring me back for more. Discovering that this is a ""Czech Pilsner"" is even more off-putting; it's a rather weak interpretation of the style."
"Billowing white rocky head, pretty quick dissipation with minimal lacing. Clear light gold body, several streams of rising carbonation. Nose is fairly sweet balanced by floral hops. Taste mirrors nose, a slight bit of bitterness but certainly on the sweet side. Light mouthfeel with not a lot of effervescence. Certainly drinkable, but there are a lot of better Pilseners to be had."
"D: Really good, one of the better ""summer"" labeled beers out there, definitely worth a shot."
"I enjoyed a sixteen ounce glass of this beer at the Amsterdam Ale House on Manhattan's Upper West Side. I am surprised to learn that this is a czech style pilsner and am weary of anyone outside of pilsen attempting this style. In general I liked it a lot. Very light and refreshing. A little cloudy in color with a great smell. Very good summer beer but not my favorite. I generally like german pilsners better."
"Overall, this is not SN's best beer, but, as always, they do a good job with it."
"D: A nice, crisp lager but nothing to write home about."
"This beer has no redeeming qualities and is Sierra Nevada's worst effort I've seen so far."
"d-Very drinkable. I had bought this in the past and wasn't too impressed. I'm glad I gave it a chance in 2010."
"Hoppy, zestful, refreshing, quaffable pilsners like this seem to me as essential to hot summer days as sun screen, sandals and a pool or lake. Ignore food pairings (although just about anything done on a BBQ seems a safe bet) and just pair this with friends and a beach. This beer is as agreeable as the summer season itself and, like it, I find myself sorrowfully missing it the other months of the year."
"The taste instantly reminds me of fresh biscuits. Slightly sweet, but mostly tasting of cereal grains. The bitterness is subtle with just the hint of spicy noble hops. Very well-balanced and palatable. The body is medium with a grainy mouthfeel. Prickly carbonation and an overall dry texture. Drinkability is excellent."
"This is and would be a very good session beer. At 5% ABV it's not overwhelming and I could recommend it to anyone, even those that can't seem to crack away from the large-scale brewers. It's got a nice hay color, maybe a little more golden, and had a pretty good head poured from the 12 oz bottle around 40-45 degrees. To me it had a citrus aroma, more like a red grapefruit. First drink was slightly bitter, but overall very smooth. As I stated in the beginning the drinkability of this beer is exceptional and I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a good session brew."
"I love this beer and often drink it straight out of the bottle (I know its a sin). Its a great summer beer with its delicious crisp pilsner taste. Immensely quaffable, this is my go to summer seasonal. I love SN and this one is def. not an exception."
"Always dreamed of the day I would taste a Sierra Nevada selection that didn't seems overpowered or based on a palate of their signature cascade hops. Well, I finally got it and I wasn't all that impressed. I beautiful appearance and crisp, clean smell waters the mouth but only for slight disappointment. Don't get it twisted, this is a good beer, but it loses for me on the terms of being a summer selection. Few breweries master the summer seasonal, as it seems that most just offer a watered down selection of their flagship brew - and Sierra Nevada nearly falls into that category. It falls short in taste while simultaneously lacking in the ""refreshment"" category, and that for me is a big no-no. If you sacrifice one, you better compensate in the other. Good beer, descent summer seasonal."
"Picked up a 12 pack of this for 11.99. A great deal! Decent head retention and carbonation. True to the lager style, but not watery or transparent like some. It is light and refreshing and reminds me of a Euro lager, but a better aftertaste than most of them. There is enough hop that lingers on the tongue, but it is not too much hop. This is great for a pint or a long session. Another great beer from a great brewery."
"Beer poured super clear golden yellow. The smell is of grain maybe a bit of lemon zest. The taste is very crisp and bit of lemon as I warms up. Mouthfeel is nicely carbed which is expected of the style. All and all a good solid beer I could enjoy on a day which is what SN was going for."
"Drinkability: Not a bad beer, but is fairly bland compared to ""real"" Czech pilsners. I would be willing to have this again, though not if, say, Pilsner Urquell were another option. Good summer refresher, though."
"d-not a big pilsner fan in general. this one is pretty good. wouldn't probably buy it again, mostly since i don't typically choose pilsners. sn does good work none the less."
"D: This was a very enjoyable but not entirely memorable effort from SN. This is a great food beer, but not one I would seek out if I were just drinking."
"MF/D: very thin, carbonation may be one of the only noticable traits of this beer."
"D: Perfect for porch (stoopsitting in baltimore) sitting in the summer on relaxing moderate afternoons and evenings. First experience was a on a roof deck with a friend and we both enjoyed it (but not overly) and eventually returned to the store for a second six pack. I would certainly buy this again however would try somthing new instead givin the opertunity."
"A lovely brew indeed."
"Pours a clear gold with a short-lived white head. Has aromas predominately of grains, with notes similar to pinot grigio dancing in the distance. Grains and grass feature loudly on the front palate, with a freshly cut grass-like bitterness that grows in intensity on the finish. Hint of lemon zest is in there, as well. Overall not bad but not great."
"A decent summer pilsener, I really enjoyed the spicy hop character but the bittering was a little too tannic for me. Easy drinking to be sure and it sure looked like simmer in a glass."
"This is a very drinkable beer, and nice summer seasonal."
"Drinkability - Sierra Nevalda makes some fine, flavorful beers. This one is no exception. Nice beer for a summer day without being insipid."
"Overall just a good, thirst-quenching and drinkable beer. Excellent on a summer night!"
"Overall, great summer beer, decent for the style. Very drinkable, but nothing earth-shattering. A good standard pils."
"I'm not usually a huge advocate of light summer beers, but for a lager I found this was a very interesting beer. More depth than most lagers I've drank, and surprisingly sweet for a Sierra Nevada. My customers find it equally delightful. I formidable lager!"
"D - Drinkable though not a lot on a hot summer day. Just a little bit too heavy for a casual beer but well balanced and flavorful."
"This is a clean and refreshing beer--great for summer."
"Solid summer session beer, a little lacking in complexity but it is refreshing."
"Solid tasting beer. I need to try more pilsners but this and Sam Adams Noble are very similar, probably give the edge to SN, just seemed to have more substance but both are solid summer drinkers."
"pretty drinkable and pretty nice for the style"
"So, I started writing a pretty standard issue ASTMD review, but realized this beer would be ill-suited for such a review. For me, this is a quintessential American summer brew. Light, crisp, and refreshing. While highly drinkable for any grilling session, this lager holds enough malt backbone, hop bite, and yeast spice to satisfy every BAs discerning tastes. Pretty herbaceous lager here that strikes a perfect balance on a hot summer afternoon."
"Very nice for a hot day."
"After the pour this beer is a transparent golden color with about a one inch head that quickly subsided. Smells refreshing with a little bit of grain. (I don't have a great nose) Tastes bitter on the front of the tongue but not in the after taste. It is crisp and refreshing for a hot day, but not spectacular. I doubt that I will buy it again after I finish this 6 pack."
"D - Six pack on a hot summer day? Yes please."
"Pours a clear, pale gold color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Great retention and decent lacing. Smells of pale malt, sweet malt, hops, hint of citrus, and a hint of wheat. Fits the style of a Czech Pilsner. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong pale malt, slight citrus, hint of hops, slight sweet malt, and a hint of wheat. Overall, decent aroma, good blend, and good body."
"Without going into the normal details, this is absolutely, hands-down, the most refreshing beer I have ever had. It is so hot where I am and this cools me right down. Its too bad this isn't out all year long. Drinkability is VERY high and mouthfeel is exceptional"
"D: the fact that i have gotten multiple sixers is proof this is not only good but very easy to drink."
"drinkability ok. though lacking in flavor for the most part, it tastes fresh at least and is easy to drink. this is the type of beer i would give to somebody who doesn't normally drink craft... while i sip a torpedo."
"perhaps it was just where i had this beer but it was disgusting. it tasted lile bud light with lemon. this was straight up awful and makes me want to hurl. there was little to no flavor and I saw almost now carbonation. The after taste was like urine and cake. I cannot exactly figure out what they were going for with this but I am thouroiughly disappointed. The absence of flavor saddened me because of SN's standard of quality but two of us ordered pints and were subject to this. I was told it is supposed to be better but I am not convinced"
"This is basically a SN Pale Ale with a nice sweetness and less hops, a beer which a non-hop head could enjoy. Light and drinkable, nothing that will blow your socks off."
"I doubt it's different than 2009's, but I'm much more impressed this time. It really does have a substantial amount of bitterness for a pils. Light and clean make this a great summer beer. I'll definitely buy more, though I still wish it were a bit cheaper. I've adjusted the scores from my previous review."
" This is your typical true pilsner"
"Served in a frosty mug... This beer tasted of noble hops and 2 row barley, which gives it a pretty good bitterness compared to other pilsners. There was some floral esters and lemon there too. I would say it is along the same lines as the Sam Adams Noble Pils. Overall a pretty good beer that I would buy again."
"D: Nice and crisp, fairly light body. Goes down real easy -- a nice drinker on a hot summer day."
"D- Very drinkable. A great beer to have when sitting out by the pool or doing some outdoor activities."
"Overall I was a bit disappointed in this beer. I thought it just lacked any excitement or any remembering qualities. Is it drinkable? Sure, but it can't hold a candle to any PA pils nor even the new Noble Pils by SA. I see people rating this beer a 4 or better and I just don't get it, it's an average beer and a below average pils. PS, tap is a bit better."
"D - Probably one of the best lawnmower beers out there, but nothing more than that"
"D: Very drinkable brew here.... Hell Sierra Nevada really cannot not go wrong... Very much to still, good flavors and not Corning like most of the other out there. Good Pils."
"D - Very good, and much more flavorful than I was expecting. Recommended."
"Poured a clear straw color with soft white head that quickly faded into so pretty nice lacing. Smells like summer, fresh cut hay with a nice hoppy smell. Think I picked up a little citrus mixed in there too. The taste is very impressive. Spicy with a hint of citrus. The malt compliments the hops perfectly. Mouthfeel was a solid medium. Drinkability was awesome. Had this sitting on the patio of the local bar. Found it be extremely refreshing and plan on picking some up for a cookout coming up this weekend."
"2010. Crystal clear and bright gold with a thin white cap of fine bubbles. The modest collar produced some sticky, spotty lace and even though it didn't start with much foam, what was there lasted for a long time. The aroma was full of spicy and lemony hops, mild malt, and some corn sweetness. Moderate bitterness and fruity sweetness up front. It finished with a combination of spicy hops, sweet malt, and crisp carbonation. Light bodied without feeling thin, dry without being harsh. Quite refreshing and easy drinking, very enjoyable."
"D: Drinkable as a lager should be, but with more character. Another success from Sierra Nevada."
"D - not looking forward to the other 5 bottles."
"- Overall doesn't stand out too much... and there are a lot of golden ales and pilsners out there... this one sits near the middle with the lot of them... but is good, and is spot on for the style."
"but one of the most enjoyable pils I have drank. I dig this 'for a Pils'..."
"D-I've had better Czech Pilsener's but this is a very solid effort and I surely won't mind finishing off the six pack in the coming weeks."
"Golden yellow pour. Light, clean and crisp. Lemon zest and wheat flavors predominately as well as hints of light malt round out the flavor profile . Well balanced all together. Quenching and drinkable, but light on flavor. A well defined summer seasonal beer."
"Cheers!!"
"Eminently drinkable!!!"
"D- It drinks like water. I guess if I wanted to drink a very light craft brew I would think about grabbin one. There are just so many others that I would go for before this. Honestly, I don't see myself revisiting this one. With all the good reviews that this beer has I guess it's possible that I just got a bad batch. Maybe I will pick up another bottle next time I hit up a shop where I can buy a single."
"D -- Who couldn't love drinking this? The right amount of hop bitterness and good flavor character for those who think Pilsners are lame. The dryness of this beer leans it to a German Pils, and the hop character bears that out. Hard to believe such a big ale brewer can nail the Pilsner style so well."
"D: A pretty refreshing and good tasting lager. But, I don't really ever worry about Sierra Nevada when it comes to making a good beer. Good for a hot summer day."
"SN has yet to let me down as a brewery, i will try another batch of this, just incase I got a pack of duds."
"This is a really good, perhaps underrated pils that's great to have around in the summer. Great lawnmower/grilling beer."
"Drinkability - Crisp, clean, and refreshing. A great warm weather lager backed up by the perect amount of hop bitterness. Extremely drinkable and delicious!"
"Mouthfeel is very light and sits at about an average level of carbonation. Very easy to drink and very sessionable. Picked up a 6 pack to start off vacation and it works great at the end of a hot day on the beach."
"Impression: Lager fans, you need to try this if you haven't. Those who don't care for lagers may be surprised to like this one. A must try."
"Judging from the good reviews, I'm pretty certain my Summerfest must have been skunked. The beer I taste here can't hold a candle to Pilsner Urquell."
"Sierra Nevada is always impressive and once again they don't dissapoint. Treat yourself this summer, and tap a Summerfest"
"pours a light yellow color with a 1 finger head that recedes to a very white ring..smell is a floral citrus bouquet of hops and malts and a hint of spice,,taste is the same its a floral hop taste off set with some bready malts..it tastes good its crisp and clean..the mouth feel is medium/light crisp and refreshing..this is a good pils/lager..but will choose prima,noble pils and czechvar b4 this one for the style..SN makes great brews at affordable prices and this one is no exception to that"
"Drink well my friend."
"Drinkability: A great pilsner and a superb summer seasonal. I could see myself easily drinking several of these on a warm day. While it reminds me a lot of the pilsners I used to drink in Europe, SN has added enough of its own touch to make this a unique and highly enjoyable beer."
"I could drink this beer all day. Goes down smooth, especially on a warm muggy, June night. Nothing special from Sierra Nevada but hit the mark for a good quality, easy drinking summer lager with enough hops to keep you interested."
"M/D - Flavor lingers and its good. A little bit of grainy flour type feel as well as some slightly spicy hops. Overall a really clean beer that a newcomer can drink and not thing about it and an advocate can dissect and find impressive."
"Overall, a very nice example of the style. I just can't figure out why it scores so low."
"D- GREAT summer beer and an excellent example of a pilsner!"
"Had this beer on a warm spring night after a softball game. The beer poured clear and golden with crisp carbonation bubbling up. A nice crisp head lasted for the first few minutes and then disappeared. Very little aroma coming from the beer. The beer was crisp with slightly spicy hops. A decent beer for my palate."
"Mouthfeel was nice, best mouthfeel I've had for a glass of water. And, sure drinkability was good. After all, we're like 60-70% made up of this stuff."
"Sierra Nevada did a good job with Summerfest, in my opinion. This is an incredibly easy drinking beer. Recommended."
"light body with a crisp finnish , it not that bad of a beer after mowing the lawn or enjoying a bbq."
"Drinkability - Defenitely a summer session beer to be paired with light seafood or salad. Better for the end of the day beer drink than the ""just got done mowing the lawn"" beer in the early afternoon."
"this one drinks really good, good session beer, exspecailly on the hot summer days, but due to the lack of flavor, ill prolly avoid this in the future and i wouldnt really recommend this."
"Highly drinkable and very enjoyable, will seek this out again as this is an excellent summer beer that went down very easy. It flows down so nicely and I've had several today and this beer was consistently good all day and into the night. Another fine Sierra Nevada product that I highly recommend."
"Light body with smooth mouthfeel. Overall a clean, balanced beer. Very drinkable. Perhaps a bit light on the hop flavor."
"D- perfect for that trip to the rope swing, day at the lake or beach, bbq's, sporting events, etc."
"A very nice example of the style and always something to look forward to in the summer."
"Drinkability is stellar. Perfectly balanced, no real flaws at all, just a great example. Top notch."
"Light grainy aroma with just a touch of lemon. Moderate carbonation and a nice light mouthfeel. Very smooth, crisp flavor with a further hint of lemon and a slightly sweet caramel malt profile. Very tasty, easy-drinking summer pilsner."
"D - Goes down very nicely. 2 of these after a nice run is perfect. A light 5 percent makes them very east to put down."
"D- Super easy to drink. I have some yard work to do so over the course of the day I dont think I will have any problem finishing the 6 of them."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a light straw color with a clean one finger white head. The aroma is full of malt, some breadiness, and slight floral hops. The taste is crisp and fresh. It is a hot day and as suggested this brew is fresh, crisp, and clean. Not too bold and there is a moderate bitter after taste but the overall feel is light and refreshing. I think there are better beers when needing your thirst quenched (as the bitter after taste leaves you needing to take another drink) but all in all a well balanced brew."
"i like this beer, had it at the beach the other day and it was quite the compliment to a sunny day and some burgers fresh off the grill."
"Drinkability - Relatively so. Not a beer that you would get ""excited"" about however. I don't think I will be getting this again however."
"Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager poured a bright yellow color, with almost no head to speak of. It smelt of a bit of hops, and lemon. It had a light but full flavor, it was a little bit hoppy, and there was alot of lemon flavors as well. It was easy to drink, and very enjoyable. Overall a great summer beer, worth a try."
"D: Again, a pretty refreshing beer. It's not going to challenge your palate in many ways, but it's far superior to any macro lager in terms of quality and taste. I could definitely kick back a few of these by the pool or at a cookout."
"From appearances and smell, could be great. The taste is very good and close to the standard for a good pilsner, but is ever so slightly imbalanced, overly bitter and lacks the mellow hoppiness of the very best pilsners. This is a good fallback option but a step below the leaders in this style."
"In terms of drinkability I'm feeling just ok about it. Although the ABV is low and the brew is definitely lively enough to keep my attention, I feel like the very mellow, buttery feel may get monotonous after a couple. In this case I think a more assertive carbonation level would help the drinkability. Still a great summer brew that I enjoy often."
"Overall, what a great couple they make...I was quite impressed with how well the crisp and mild bodied brew cut right through the spiciness after every bite and left a clean and refreshing finish with a pleasant low bitterness. The malt and hop aromas aren't very appealing to me but I do appreciate the smooth, full flavor, and aftertaste that Summerfest grants the palate."
"Beer has a grainy taste to it but it finishes nicely. Overall just a plain, blank slate, almost a palate cleanser. There is nothing special or interesting about this beer. Its bland. Easy to drink though."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall impression: This is definitely a beer that should be popping up in those ""how do I convert my BMC-loving friends?"" threads. Nice backyard brew."
"D - Excellent, I could drink this all summer long."
"Bottle. A pleasant golden yellow with relatively thin head. Light citrus and hop aroma. Crisp, clean, balanced flavor with somewhat subtle citurs/hop taste perfect for summer time drinking. Refreshing on the palate. Not built to be a BIG beer... it is what it is, and it is a fine summer pilsener."
"Noting special but a decent offering. Other than the Saaz this doesn't seem at all a Bohemian Pilsner to my palate."
"Poured into my Duvel tulip. Pours a beautiful clear pale yellow, with an initially good sized creamy head that is too brief and doesn't leave behind much lacing. The smell is largely of bready malts, with a hint of spiciness from the Saaz in the background. Summerfest tries to walk the line between lightly hopped and under hopped, and just misses the mark for me. The nose hinted at it, but a few sips confirm that this beer is a little bit lacking in the hops department. Yes it's supposed to be subtle and an easy drinking summer brew, but I'm not asking for a hop bomb here, I'm just asking that I not have to strain to notice the spicey Saaz flavor. It's a shame too, because this beer is incredibly drinkable, not too carbonated and not too heavy, I found it disappearing from my glass rather quickly. If Summerfest had a little more hop presence it might be one of my go to summer beers, but I doubt I'll be revisiting it again as is."
"Overall - Not bad for the style, but not my favorite. Would be a nice picnic beer that I wouldn't mind sharing. I won't search it out, but if I stumble on some I wouldn't turn it down."
"Good mouthfeel and very easy drinking. A very good summer beer."
"Mouthfeel is light and a bit slick. Drinkability is high, as it should be for this type of beer. This is fine for the style, but its a style I'm not too crazy about. Still...I'll give it its due because it fits the stylistic characteristics."
"Immensely quaffable, this is the ideal summer lager. I noticed that only the smell dropped from my previous review in 2008. As they say, the olfactory suffers with age."
"A VERY light lager here. Has a pale color reminiscent of a domestic banquet beer. However, the taste is much more developed; Light, citrus, and full. There is a slight taste of the lager yeast in the brew which, while not unfavorable, is unexpected. This is a hot weather beer, one to be enjoyed while sitting in the shade at midday, or around the bbq. Another plus to this beer is the decent price and its wide availability (anywhere one can find regular Sierra Nevada)."
"D - A tasty, sessionable brew that will definitely go well with summer weather. Thirst-quenching and light, but has enough flavor to maintain an interesting profile."
"d - a good pilsener, it doesn't stand out much but i'm not sure it's supposed to."
"Not a terribly exciting beer by any stretch, though not flawed in any way. Still trying to figure out why this is the style target of hundreds upon hundreds of breweries..."
"Drinkability: Works well on a hot summer day, which is the main point of this beer. So it accomplishes what it's set out to be. Overall I'll pick up a six or two every year."
"Even during the hottest of summer days, Summerfest, a ""crisp summer lager," is a bit too light for my taste, and the flavors too unpronounced. However, this kind of inoffensiveness and neutrality is perfect for friends and visitors just looking for something pleasantly drinkable and refreshing."
"drinkability - easy drinking, light on flavor, pretty to look at"
"Slainte."
"D- Good beer for a hot summer day on the porch, would prefer this out of the bottle at home versus on tap at a restaurant. I think that setting is what is going to make this beer more drinkable."
"Drinkability: Oh yeah, a nice change from all the BIG American beers I had over the winter. It's friendly and refreshing."
"Body & mouthfeel were good. Full body for style, presumably b/c there are no adjuncts in here. Well carbonated. This beer is exactly what standard American lagers should taste like! It's a straightahead lager but with full flavors."
"D- Oh yeah, its drinkable. Because of how light and rather flavorless this is, it goes down real smooth and you don't even blink. I could easily pound back a few of these in a night...if I was into drinking beer like this on the regular."
"Pours a bubbly clear golden yellow. Thin white head with clingy lace. Smell is very clean and dry. Grassy, a little bit of lemon. Not a huge nose. Very clean and crisp. Sharp carbonation. Fantastic tasting pilsener. Perfect amount of refreshing bitterness. Finishes ultra clean with no aftertaste what so ever. I could literally drink gallons of this stuff regardless of the weather. This is a great summer beer, but I don't think they should limit it to a seasonal. Just call it Sierra Nevada Pilsener and make it every day. In my opinion SN is the best brewery in the country. They are great at every thing they do regardless of the style. Great beer."
"D - This is up there with the other summer beers I have had, super refreshing, crisp and clean with a lingering lemon candy flavor. Good stuff"
"D: I could drink this beer all day. In my opinion this is a great, affordable pilsener. It may not be the most complex beer but it has everything I look for in a pilsner: a showcase of noble hops, a nice solid, slightly sweet malt backbone, and amazing drinkability."
"D- No real reason I would drink this beer again. Boring and faceless with a weird mustiness to it. Not the biggest hit with me, but I wouldn't complain if it was at a BBQ. Can go down without noticing it's lesser qualities."
"Very good beer."
"Taste, lemon, astringent suprisingly. Light bodied, hops stick out more, more of the Euro style hops, not traditional SN type. Resonates moreso downbottle, a good hot weather beer at a legit price."
"But it's better than Bud."
"Bready malts and lemony and herbal hops seem very well balanced. Some grainyness and finishes dry. Tastes very clean and crisp. Medium/light bodied and well carbinated. Very easy to drink and refreshing. Great summer beer"
"Overall: The label says ""lager", but style indicated is Czech Pilsener. Hmmm. A bit of a toss-up. Not really a hop prescence that a Czech pilsener would have. However, a nice refeshing, drinkable summer offering."
"Beer has a nice refreshing balance of sweetness and crispness. The lemon adds a light tartness to the slightly sweet malts and toasted grains. It is flavorful while still remaining light and bright. Decent carbonation without being fizzy or bubbly. Crazy high drinkability, and it's definitely a great summer beer."
"D- Overall, this is a very drinkable summertime brew. Sierra Nevada provides a light combination of malt and spiced hops to create the pefect brew to mow the lawn to (yup, I mowed to a couple of these). You can definitly have several of these while embracing the omcoming heat!"
"D) A new brew for a warm day. I'd have another ... as long as the weather cooperates."
"Pours a super clear light golden yellow. A frothy white head laces the glass. I see many trails of carbonation. Smell is sugary sweet, with a whole lotta light biscuit. Taste is pleasantly bitter upfront, with a good dash of hops and more biscuit to back it up. Spicy finish, but very smooth. A bit of complexity for a pilsner, and it goes appreciated. ""Crisp"" as the label says, it is, and this would be a great session beer for a warm evening. Very good. I don't regret purchasing a sixer, and I'm sure a few more will follow.."
"Easy drinker. Great for a summer day."
"The best American brewed Pilsener I've encountered. The Saaz hops really sing, yet balance is maintained throughout."
"A quality take on the style, although I found the malt flavors a bit harsh in the finish. Absolutely drinkable, I'm glad I can get them in the 12-pack at a slightly better price."
"Would recommend."
"D: I could have quite a few of these. not too carbonated, not to hoppy, not too citrusy (though i'm not sure that's a word)"
"Could consume seven seas worth of this beer. Amazing."
"I just bought my first case of the year (2010) tonight. I was very impressed with it. Not your typical SN offering, because the hops are a bit muted. To be honest, this reminds me of what a good, every day American beer should be like. Unfortunately, here in PA (with tax), it costs $36 a case. So, not the best choice for an ""every day"" beer. Color is a lovely golden hue. Nice head on it, although not nearly as thick as their standard pale ale. Smelll is light, crisp, sharp. Taste is a very good balance of hops and malt. Really smooth. Grainy is a good word to use to describe the taste. Mouthfeel is fine, just right. This is an almost perfect beer for those warm-weather days. A reasonable ABV (5%), so you can drink a few and still maintain a coherent conversation with your buddies."
" This is good tasting beer. I think this is what a regular beer should taste like.Hot summer day beer and a good session beer."
"taste features an upfront hop-sweetness with nice malt mellowing. not too dry. light bitterness lingers a bit. mouthfeel is crisp and effervescent as expected but seems to block some flavor i suspect is there more than it seems. more lively than some of the czech pils i've have before, but this is still more american than euro. a nice effort. quite drinkable. i might slalom between the anchor summer wheat and this one hot day next month."
"Drinkability is very good. Another good summer beer, that goes down easily."
"Simple lager done well fills that nice niche where you want a light beer for the patio that still has the right flavours. Kinda tastes like a kolsch with that very pale colour coupled with pleasant hops on the nose. Slightly dry finish and solid midbody make this a winner. Not as hoppy as Prima Pils but still more European in attitude than some US lagers"
"Light in body without being thin, the carb is nice and packing a punch without numbing the tip of the tounge. Goes down all to easy. Quite a drinker."
"F: Semi bitter, little lager sweet malt taste but dries a bit. Toasty malts, light malts. Slight lingering sweetness, crisp and refreshing, nice hop characters but maybe a bit heavy in the overall hop profile for a summer beer and Czech pilsner."
"Had on-tap. Probably would not have considered trying but it was on special for happy hour. Pilsner type taste and feel. Straw, yellow in appearance. Clean, crisp smell and taste. Excellent mouthfeel. Some carbonation but goes down incredibly smooth. Very drinkable would definitely try again, especially on a hot day. Great session beer."
"Drinkability: A decent Czech pilsner. I could have a couple of these, but nothing I would go out of my way for."
"A: 4 S: 4 T: 4.5 M: 4 O: 4.5"
"I enjoy this beer but its a bit expensive."
" I usually will have 3-4 beers a night when I drink, but I am done after one of these and don't want anymore. I am going to try another one tomorrow and see if I come to the same conclusion. I may have gotten an old/bad batch as this is definitely not 'crisp' or 'refreshing.'"
"Overall: Like a Stella without the bite. Nothing too exciting going on here..."
"Its a no frills easy to drink beer; I could pound these all-night."
"D= very drinkable, would be a great session beer regardless of season, and with any meal style that I can think of. Probably great with baked or grilled fish."
"D- Pretty drinkable, not my favorite of the style, seems to me a good summer pilsner option though. Light & refreshing, enough body to keep my taste buds interested, and certainly refreshing enough for a hot day. I plan to buy a sixer of it, and probably go through a few on a nice day for sure."
"When I had picked this up, it had just been delivered, so was very fresh. Had a great hop aroma; the typical pilsner/saaz hop notes were there along with some definite light citrus. Went down super smooth, was able to taste the Pils malts and again with the American hops. Was foruntate to have the sixer all to myself that evening as everyone else was into their macro-brews. Having this beer in hand while playing bags and eating good food on a warm night is what summer is all about."
"I definitely need to get this when it's in season. I can see the potential now, because it isn't a horrible beer right now even when it's a bit skunky. I'll give it another shot and re-review later."
"This one was likely a little old when I got it (I have my comments in a notebook). Pours a yellowish color. Aroma was rather skunky, so I am guessing light got to it. The flavor was much like the smell. Caramel malts within the brew are a little heavy, but I have come to expect that of many micros."
"D- Good beer for in between styles as it is not a palate wrecker. This beer would be a good start for BMC people looking to go into the craft world."
"Drinkability: Ok summer beer, does not fit my choice in So Cal. Probably works in Chico, I am good for one of SN Summerfest."
"Drinkability: As mentioned before this beer exceptionally refreshing and would definitely see drinking this on a nice summer day."
"Pretty drinkable, would be great at lunch outdoors on a sunny summer day."
"The first hit is a slight grassy bitterness that ends with a light cereal grains flavor. The flavor is that of a pretty good lager. It feel like some Saaz hops, or something similar are used, giving a pretty solid traditional flavor IMO. The mouth feel is frothy and solid, no problems here. Overall and especially for the price I got this, SN summerfest is a solid lager, if that's what cha looking for."
"big creamy white head, bright golden body. nose is predominantly hops with a touch of malts. the taste is quite refreshing: crisp and cool, the carbonation is abundant and refreshing. not too much taste going on, but then again, it is a summer lager, so I'm not expecting much more than the hop and malt combination they are giving me."
"Great drinkablity could see drinkin a couple of these. Just not SN best beer seems like it is missing something, nothing real great or standout from this beer."
"Drinkability: If it werent for the high carbonation it would be a good alternative to the SA summer beer but its not very drinkable to me."
"This feels prickly and coarse, and is cleansing to the palate. Overall a great example of the Czech Pilsner style from a great brewing company."
"Poured into an American pint glass, very yellow/gold, with good carbonation, but a thin white head and no lacing. The smell was lackluster, with just a subtle hint of lemon, and some herbal/grassy notes. The taste was the same, with a slightly more pronounced herbal presence rather than citrus. The mouthfeel was a pleasantly thin, carbonated brew; certainly refreshing for a 'lawnmower' beer, and definitely sessionable. However, it does need some more flavor."
"M/D: Definitely a quaffer on a hot summer day. Some graininess and hints of corn come out at the end when it warms up, so its best to drink this quick & on the colder side."
"Mouthfeel is very crisp with the right amount of carbonation. At first glance, this really looked like a typical macro to me and that would really be my only complaint. Not sure why it tasted so off at first, but the more I drank, the more I enjoyed it. It just took some time for me to notice the hop presence which usually isn't an issue with SN. Overall this was very refreshing and I can see this as a good thing to have on a hot day. The main thing that would hinder me from picking this up again is that when I think of SN, this isn't anywhere near the top of my list. Still this is a great example of the style so I have to give credit to SN for another quality brew."
"D - Refreshing and drinkable, but still there are better out there."
"A pretty good beer. Nothing all that special. Though it is a really good beer for the summer. Obviously that is the goal here, but other than at a BBQ for the summer I probably won't get this again."
"It poured crisp and clean not much of a head but a nice clean golden yellow color. It had what I usually associate with the ""lager"" smell, very nice even had a clean lager smell not too danky. It is very light it was like drinking a commercial style pilsner but obviously better. The mouthfeel is drier with a bit of bitter hop aftertaste. I would love having this on a hot day after work after you've been running around all day just sit in the lawn chair or if you really got style the daven-porch and relax with one of these."
"Drinkability: Please mass produce this beer! Great break from my usual big beer sessions."
"M/D: a slight dryness and lots of carbonation tingle. Definitely drinkable and works very well as a summertime brew. I would recommend this one but not over their wheat ale"
"Drinkability is high. This is a slightly above average, easy to drink pils. Definitely no frills, but solid."
"Drinkability- Great, wishing I had picked up some more. I was pissed initially when I arrived at home and noticed this was the 08 vintage. All it took was one sip to change my mind."
"D - Very drinkable just like you want a lager to be, but still flavorful enough to be enjoyed as more than just a lawnmower beer."
"Poured into a glass. Had a very pale yellow color with a white head that fades pretty quickly. Some lacing, kind of sticky. Smell of some slight hops, not very strong. Had some after tastes of wheat, maybe some hay. Taste was very mediocre at best. Some wheat to it with a slight hop finish, again not a strong flavor. Mouthfeel was pretty decent, had a nice crisp feel to it, finishes a little dry at the end. A pretty drinkable beer, quite refreshing overall, despite the lack of flavor. If you know somebody who is trying to get into more quality breweries and can't seem to find any they like, this may be worth a shot. I really wouldn't go out of my way to ever try it again though."
"Personally: I really love this stuff, one of the best pilsners made in the US."
"Drinks very easily. I might just drink the whole six tonight."
"Overall this is a good refreshing lawnmower type beer, nothing particularly special about it, but a good solid brew that I wouldn't turn down none-the-less."
"Easy drinker, especially with the 101 degree day we had today!"
"Great clean and crisp taste, perfect for summer. Slightly dry, but refreshing. Although this is lighter beer, it has a good amount of flavor. Very drinkable, I wish I had gotten this earlier in the summer."
"This is a great summer beer. Nice golden color with a slight head. I was not getting much in the way of aroma, just a light sweet smell. The taste is dry and crisp with a nice hop bite at the end. Very nice on a hot St Louis summer day. Easy to drink and goes nice with light summer foods."
"D - a very solid, refreshing beer. Perfect for a summer day."
"Drinkable all day long, a very good beer for this time of year."
"D- Definitely drinkable in large quantities... although very light in flavor and body, it is very crisp and clean. If American Adjunct Lagers and Light Lagers had any knowledge of how to make a good beer, this would be the model."
"Like a lot of the other reviews, I don't find this to be a good Czech Pils, but it is a very refreshing summer beer that I could easily drink for an afternoon. A good overall beer."
"This a pretty drinkable summer beer. Not really the best czech I've had but I looked on the bottle, it doesn't really have that word anyway, just ""lager", so ya know why not give em a break. Not quite low enough ABV for session but close em to drink a bunch of em on a hot day."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a shaker pint. It pours a pale fizzy yellow with a moderate white head. The aroma is a bit grassy, light. The brew is slightly bitter and has a lingering finish, very clean flavors. The beer is light bodied, and easy drinking. A solid Czech pilsner but it is far from the top of the class."
"Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager was a pale golden color with good clarity. It had a thick white head with decent retention and lacing. The aroma had some grassy and spicy hops. The taste was well balanced between light malt and bitter hops with a dry lightly bitter finish. It was fairly light bodied with medium carbonation. Drinkability was good. It was crisp and refreshing. This is a good summertime beer."
"Overall - It's a very basic pilsener beer. It's definitely still more substantial and satisfying than BMC light beers, but it's definitely a summer thirst quencher rather than a complex sipper."
"MF and drink-Very very light and an incredibly crisp finish leaving me very refreshed on this hot july day drinks very well and should be consumed 2 or 3 at a time in my opinion."
"Notes: I would like to see a classification of ""American Pilsner""... this brew just doesn't conjure-up the thoughts of a European beer for me..."
"D- refreshing...a good summer beer"
"D: No bones about it - this is a very tasty summer lager. As I've come to expect from SN, a finely-tuned and refreshing brew that should have wide appeal across the board."
"Overall I was pretty disappointed with this beer... id much rather grab the SNPA."
"Notes: A solid beer from a solid brewery! ""Everybody fest"""
"Taste: Very refreshing, with a modest bitterness. A little bit of lemon from otherwise spicy hops."
" As for the flavor, the hop bitterness is a bit underdone as well as the flavor. The malt flavor is lingering as well. The bitterness is quite a bit lower than what I have had in many other Bohemian Pils, but it is there and it does not linger into the finish. I do like the beer's finish and it does leave you wanting more, the malt is just slightly sweet and finishes clean. Stylistically the beer misses the mark a bit for a claim as a Bohemian Pils, but it does deliver as a good easy drinking summer beer. I guess it all depends on what the main goal of this beer was, if it was to nail a Bohemian Pilsner style or be a mass market craft beer perfect for summer events. I would put my money on the latter. But this beer still could benefit from a boost in the Saaz hops additions even if it was just a little."
"Overall: a six-pack session beer for the summer, as advertised... not as big (Bigfoot), professional (pale ale) or awesome (Wet Hop) as their more memorable offerings, but smooth and agreeable..."
"Overall, I'm not very impressed. I'd rather have one of the other many fine Sierra Nevada beers. Perhaps I should give this one another try in the bottle as I was a bit surprised."
"Pours a brilliantly clear pale gold in color with about a half finger of white head. Aroma is quite clean. A bit grainy with a biscuit-like aroma. Low hop aroma. Taste is pretty good. Very clean, lightly malty, touch of honey, some spicy hop flavor and a nice balancing bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty good with light-medium body and moderate-high carbonation. Drinkaiblity is pretty good as well. A nice easy drinker that is fairly flavorful and well balanced."
"Overall a tasty and refreshing pilsner."
"D- Amazing, perfect in my opinion. Would love to see this sold by he case in my area."
"This beer isn't spectacular, but I'm digging it, and pilseners don't rank too highly on my list of favorite styles. Another good one from Sierra Nevada."
"D- drinkability is huge. could EASILY go through a 12 pack of these."
"crispy mouthfeel and drinkable. this is where this beer comes in play. summer time fun. it has a decent backbone but it goes down well and would pair well with a lawnmower session."
"c'mon guys! what happened? i tried two bottles of this from the sixer, and i had to go back and return it. i might as well have been drinking soda water..."
"Aside from that it feels good. Carbonated well. And drinkable."
"D: Easily crushable and definitely on style, save the Saaz, but I just can't see myself reaching for one of these over so many other personal favorite summer time beers."
"D-This would be a perfect beer to sit back on a patio on a hot Saturday afternoon; I guess its merits lie in its refreshing quality and less in its depth of character. Still, the beer shouldn't be shortchanged, as it's a pleasant representation of the style."
"looks light, lighter than it tastes which is good. i like how the sweet notes help balance the hops in this. its also nice that it doesn't hit you all at once giving it more complexity. as a summer beer should be this is crisp and drinkable but without being boring."
"I enjoy most SN beers, but this beer is average all around. Probably would not but another 6 pack, even though it was only $6.99."
"Drinkability: Excellent. A fantastic summer session beer."
"overall better than most pilsners."
"D- Lots of drinkability in this one. Wouldn't want too many myself. But would probably satisfy your ""average"" beer drinker in the summer time."
"Crystal clear and light yellow with plenty of carbonation and a small white head. Pleasant malt aroma with a hint of hops. Light mouthfeel with a somewhat bitter middle and finish. An excellent very drinkable beer when you have to live through a Texas summer that has already been too long."
"Smells like hay and fresh, chilled wort. Tastes crisp, clean and...inoffensive? Nothing outstanding but so perfectly rounded. Lightly grainy, this is what I think of when I hear the word ""beer."""
"Not the most amazing beer ever, but definitely a decent light summer beer from SN."
"SN doesn't do anything badly, and this is no exception. It just doesn't ""wow"" me."
"Drinkability: I love the bottled version of this beer, but this tap version (could just be the place I was getting it from) was a little disappointing. The flavors and aromas felt a bit worn down, and there was a particularly strong bite at the end of each sip. I'll have to revisit this one - most likely at the brewery. EDIT (06-30-09): Went great with that swordfish tonight. I would've had another, but I decided it would be better to hold back. That's the Summerfest I remember! Will definitely order again."
"I liked this beer quite a bit. Easy drinking, I could have several of these easily on these hot summer days."
"D: I think I'll get something else for a summer brew."
"Its clean, its drinkable, its from a well reknowned brewery. Its just not great."
"Very good with aged Cheddar and Gouda and amazing with Shropshire Blue. Not so much with Camembert."
"Conclusion: Meh...I've had much better Czech Pils...there's nothing WRONG with this per se...it's just very plain and honestly pretty boring."
"D-easy beer to drink. perfect for a hot summer day tailgating at the ballpark."
"Just a bit boring - but then what are pilsners most of the time anyway."
"Just tried the 2009 version. There is a very strong lager yeast aroma. The color is light golden. The mouthfeel is light which is typical for the style. The taste is much bolder than I expected. There is a mild malty sweetness in the beginning that gets progressively hoppy through the mid taste and finish. The beer is fairly refreshing, but the after taste is too strong and musty for me."
"Drinkability: Quite high -- not something I would choose to drink a lot of but all in all, it's not an awful choice that is refreshing enough and would be easy to session."
"D - Low abv and a wonderful crispness make this a great session beer. However, the dryness seems a bit out of place. I've had pilsners that were more balanced and more enjoyable. Still a very worthy buy if you're a fan of lagers."
"D: Yep, goes down easy. Good summer beer."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer, but hardly an outstanding one."
"This beer is full of some clean flavors. With a nice after taste. Not a real powerful beer but still very tasty. I have to say its in my top three favorite Sierra Nevada beers. I Love the Torpedo and the Pale Ale is also delicious. Great for a grilling companion. Time to go throw a steak on the BBQ."
"drinkability: there's better pilsners out there. worst SN beer in the lineup"
"D - I would definitely buy/drink this again."
"12 oz bottle in Denver, Colorado"
"Overall a great refreshing summer beer. Good for a hot day. A much better alternative to macros at a BBQ."
"D: What you'd drink while lounging about outside on a hot summer day. As I'm doing this currently, I think I'll have another."
"Drinkability: Almost a 5, as it's clean and awesome for a burger pairing and I sessioned nicely with it, I just wish it were a little more complex in the flavor. It's pretty straightforward, and that works to both its advantage and disadvantage."
"This is one hell of a Czech Pils, easily one of the best that I've had. Probably doesn't hurt that it's fresher than any of the imported Czech ones available here."
"Pours a crystal clear straw color with a good finger of bubbly foam that quickly dissolves and leave a fine ring around the glass. The aroma has sweet nutty malts and some earthy, grassy hops. The flavor is sweet caramel malt upfront that is supported with some bitter hops towards the end. Its a light bodied beer with lots of carbonation. Summerfest is a very easy drinking beer but I'm still trying to work into the lager thing so I probably won't be grabbing more of this soon."
"this is a great summer beer, light, crisp and refreshing but also flavorful. i would drink this all summer if my wallet would permit but i guess il have to suppliment with some homebrew which is not such a bad alternative. the only imperfection is the head retention which is lacking quite a bit."
"Drinkability- pretty drinkable, a good summer beer, I would definitely drink it again.Good for working outside on a hot day"
"4.5 still one of my favorite summer beers. drawbacks are the quality of co2 and it's a bit too filling to really be ""refreshing"""
"Right on the money for the style, crisp and refreshing."
"D: Refreshing, a very sessionable summer beer."
"At 5% ABV, I could session this all day long. Truely a fantastic summer beer."
"D- Easy drinking summer brew with enough taste to remind you that it is a Sierra Nevada. Overall a great Pils/Lager"
"Sparkling yellow hue with large marshmallow head. Light hops, corn, alcohol, grass in the nose. Grass notes, bready, soapy hops in the finish. Smooth but slick in mouthfeel. Highly drinkable and enjoyable. Sierra Nevada is still the kings of hops even though this beer is a more average brew for them."
"D: A very good summer lager. Easy to put down a few of these on a hot day."
"Pours a crystal clear straw color with beautiful bubbles and a thin foamy white head. Smells of citrus, malts, bready biscuity yeast. Taste is crisp and bitter, hints of the breadiness and citrus flavors are there. Not much to the taste, but I didn't want any more. A straightforward tasty full lager. Mouthfeel was nice and clean, not thick or soupy. Drinkability is huge."
"D - Nicely refreshing"
"Light body but this beer is not without substance. A well made beer in my opinion, and though I am not real familiar with the style this seems to be a good example."
"Cheers!!"
"I'll give it another shot cold from a bottle. I have no problem with this beer."
"D: Smooth and sessionable pils."
"I cant find a freshness date on the bottle and I suspect that to be a possible culprit for a fine pilsner with quality ingredients. This reminds me more of a typical North German pilsner than anything czech but that might be my own subjectivity."
"T/M - A pretty decent, medium body. The taste is mainly malts and vague hops. But it is very mild and enjoyable. A decent summer brew."
"D: I won't be getting this again. For the price of $8.50 for a six pack, it's not worth it. Beer pong beer is only $0.50/beer, not $1.42."
"Nothing too complex, but it's a refreshing lager that hits the spot. Very good in the summer. Recommended."
"decent on the palate. good mouthfeel with plenty of character. Slightly malty, with not niticable in the hops, except for a mildly bitter end."
"D - A solid cookout beer. Might get a little too sour for the occasion if I tried to session them. But standard cookout procedure is to go with 2-3 tasty beers up front and switch over to the lighter side so no harm there."
"Appearances can be deceiving, as I thought this beer would feel lighter on the tongue but it actually has a nice body, and a complimentary amount of carbonation. Fresh and delicious, great summer beer. Whoda thunk?"
"Poured into a pokal glass at 42 degrees. Appearance: A one finger foamy and creamy white head that has some retention. The body of the beer is a medium gold color. There is a lot of effervescence in the beer. The clarity of the beer is clear and brilliant. Nose: A malty goodness with a sublte sweetness. There is a little bit of spiciness with floral and citrus and a touch of wood. Taste: A decent maltiness with a sublte sweetness. There is a light hoppiness that is spicy, floral esters and a touch of wood. Overall: There is a creamy carbonated mouth feel. The body of the beer is light and the finish is light. This is not a great beer but it is decent. I really didn't care for it."
"-Prost!"
"Thin and crisp overall, goes down very easily. Absolutely a beer for chugging on a hot summer day. Will not fill you up, will not coat your tongue, will not warm you up. Easy-drinking, cooling, liquid refreshment."
"Pours a transparent golden color with a small but strong white head. Clean, crisp lager nose with a healthy dosage of hops. Good balance achieved here in flavor semi-sweet, semi-grainy cereal malts with a fresh, bitter hop blast. Crisp and refreshing with a dry finish. Very sessionable, a damn good summer option."
"Very refreshing, I could session this beer all night long."
"Drinkability: This brew can be very dangerous on a hot summer day. This very easy to drink and a great session brew."
"Overall: Really drinkable, nice crisp refreshing flavor and mouthfeel. This is the kind of beer you just drink and enjoy on a hot day, not much to really admire in the appearance or smell."
"Easy to drink, not a whole lot of flavor like i usually expect from SN, but its a good beer to refresh you on a hot summer day."
"Update 4/2011: I decided to try this one again, since I have been into lagers lately and it appears that the one that I had originally reviewed may not have been a good bottle. The most significant changes come in taste and overall. The appearance, smell and mouthfeel are consistent with the prior review. The beer did not have the same metallic taste to it, so that dramatically improved the taste and overall score of the beer. Overall, a very enjoyable lager and if they are consistent with this 6-pack, I could see buying this brew more often."
"This is a really good example of a style that's begining to grow on me lately. Maybe I DIPA'd myself out over the winter but I'm starting to enjoy these ""summer"" type beers for what they are. Refreshing and easy to drink."
"Overall - When in the mood for something lighter with distinct lager characteristics, this is your beer. Much more flavor than the macros."
"Drinkability is good. Clocking in at 5% ABV. makes this a huge session brew."
"Drinkability: smooth an refreshing, fits the summer vibe with its citrus notes. A nice smooth, somewhat light easy to drink beer for those hot summer nights. However this beer easily surpasses many other beers in quality and taste."
"drinkability is strong - sure i would like more hops (prima pils) but this light drinking pils is perfect for summer"
"D - The alcohol content makes it seem drinkable but for me its not light enough. Again its too heavy without the hops to balance it out, the sweet malty bread flavor with the carbonation keeps me from enjoying more than one or two."
"Pours out a nice gold color with a decent amount of head. Smell is definitely hoppy. Nice crisp taste, with some sweetness and some hoppyness. Smooth overall. Something I would definitely drink while sitting out on a patio (which is what I am doing with it now)"
"-RR"
"Avoid."
"Leave it to SN to brew a refreshing summer lager with a bunch of hops...go figure. Lots of saaz flavor and maybe some other floral varietal as well. Malts could use a bit more presence here, but other than that it is a nice pilsner offering from an American brewer. The Prima Pils is still my favorite, but this is not too far behind."
"Poured a nice fizzy, pale yellow beer with some nice initial head, but almost no lacing. Decent malty scent and decent malty taste, although I would have classified this as a macro lager, as there was very little hop presence and there was a bit of a skunky/adjunct flavor and aroma. It went down smooth, but this is by far my least favorite SN beer to date."
"A nice ""plain vanilla"" lager made by a microbrew...nothing too special but a good alternative to a refreshing summer beer."
"Overall this is a pretty good lager great for a nice hot summer day."
"For me as a summer beer I don't think this quite cut the mustard. I think the SA mentioned and Anchor Steam summer or Bell's Oberon would do better. In fact I would pick a Corona and lime over this. To be fair though you should try it on a hot summer day. Might improve then."
"This is an all around good Czech style Pilsener. Superior to the macro American lager styles with a fruity, citrusy taste and dry finish. The aroma is a little lacking compared to say a Staropramen but clean and effective nonetheless. The color is a rich gold compared to the straw gold macro lagers."
"Pale gold with a rocky white, fluffy head that sticks some lace on the glass. Saaz hops and munich malt with doughy grain and lemon rounding out the smell. Tastes of toasted grain with a fresh dose of euro hoppiness in the mostly clean finish. This tastes like what I would imagine a really fresh, real czech pils would taste like. Smooth with a light mildly creamy body and seltzery carbonation. A really nice beer and an underappreciated style."
"Very nice summer lager! Very good gateway into the craft world."
"But, to be honest, it was alright. I didn't find the lemon flavors too strong. But there are much better pilsners out there, esp. in the Philly area."
"D - I'll get it while I can. This is a great brew to enjoy after mowing the yard while the burgers/steaks are cooking. I almost wish my family reunions were held where alcoholic beverages could be distributed. Great summertime beer."
"D - Crisp summer beer perfect for a summer day."
"D - Decent light alcohol hot weather beer that is good for new craft beer recruits"
"A very good beer, great on a hot day, better than any adjunct beer. A little weak though, i would love some more flavor."
"Zesty mouthfeel."
"2009 vintage served in a pilsener glass. Poured a bright, golden yellow with a one inch frothy, bright white head that sizzled and popped as it quickly receded; only a few specks of lacing present during the session. Copious tiny bubbles present in solution. Nose suggests citrus, cereal grains and a whiff of skunk. Taste follows nose, but citrus quality is enhanced at the front and a biscuity character come out at the finish. Mouthfeel is light-bodied and sparklingly effervescent. Goes down easy, but not really digging the whole package hear. Much better summer offerings are out there."
"Pours a bright, clear straw sunshine yellow. Very quick, spongey head and one string of bubbles. Crisp pilsner malt and cracked grain with some clean hops. The taste is very crisp clean malt, and lightly astringent hops. Great clean, smooth palate that wips the palat clean every sip. Ready for more sips of this awesome pils."
"Tasted next to Pilsner Urquell, this beer is slightly lighter in appearance, more aromatic, and more character all around."
"Drinkability - Love this beer. I'll buy more and then look forward to next summer's seasonal brew."
"Pours a clear bright golden yellow color with a small head. There is no lacing to note on the glass. A malty sweetness dominates the smell. I can also pick up some orange, grapefruit, and some herbal notes in the background. The Summerfest Lager tastes similar to the smell, except the citrus notes I picked up seem to be more like lemons. There is also a slight bitterness to the beer, but not too strong. The body of the beer is nice, but the carbonation is too much--almost makes the beer unpleasant. Overall it's a decent brew from Sierra Nevada. There was just something a little off in the aftertaste of this beer. It was nice to try, but it won't make it into the rotation."
"D - this is a great summer beer for those that want to bake in the sun and enjoy a cold one. one of my favorite summer beers."
"Feels ok in the mouth. Carbonation is good medium, but finish is a tad dry and unfulfilling."
"A 12 ounce bottle purchased at the Beer Stop for $1.75. Poured into me shaker glass, this pils appears a hazed muted straw color with about a finger of bone white foam. Flavor and aroma are of lightly toasted grains, lemon, grassy hops. Just about medium in both body and carbonation. A decent warm weather lager."
"Overall, this is by far my least favorite offering from Sierra Nevada. I don't plan on ever buying this, but maybe on a HOT summer day I could try it again."
"Pours a clear yellow with a medium pure white head. Nice lacing all the way down the glass. Smell is faintly of grain and citrus. Taste is light, refreshing malty, a hint of lemon. The finish is dry, with a big cracker malt flavor. Nice bitterness from the hops, but not as high as many Czech Pilsners I have had. Mouthfeel is average, high carbonation. Drinkability is fantastic, it is quite easy to drink many of these. A very good beer to convert BMC lovers with."
"Final Thoughts: Not a bad beer, it's just far too weak on the smell and the taste. Simply put, there's just not enough going on."
"This is a great summer brew. Nothing more, nothing less, and one that can be enjoyed throughout the day."
"D: Tastes exactly like it should, and refreshes in the same way. I can go through a 6er on a hot Cali day."
"Taste was the same as the smell. A good light lager that as another reviewer said is a great substitute for coors lite, etc. Crisp and refreshing but I would be drinking something else on a hot summer day. Not my favorite style."
"This beer is just fine for what it strives to be. A drinkable pale yellow fizzy summer beer. It is a much more tasty and flavorful substitute for a Budweiser or a Miller Lite. Plenty of Pilsner flavor and smell, a bready bitterness that comes through. Nothing spectacular as none of the flavors jump out at the drinker, but it is solid in every respect and I recommend it as a summer beer to drank outside in the hot weather."
"D- Give one of these to a macro drinking friend and see what happens. I could easily go through a few on a hot summer day."
"Overall an average beer. Poured nicely with a light, thin frosting that disappered rather rapidly. Aroma nice, althhough. I was overwhelmed with a bit of wheat. Taste was average, for some reason I was expecting a blonde ale. Good beer to go along with a fried seafood dish. Not a sesion beer. Stick with the pale ale. I am still searching for that perfect summer ale."
"The beer is nice and smooth, has a bit of a buttery feel that seems to just slight down after every sip. One of the better Summer beers out there."
"Overall this is a solid selection for hot weather - it's got enough flavor to enjoy while not going overboard. Worth a shot."
"I got this years Summerfest at MarCellar's in Idaho Falls, Idaho. It's a really great brew with nice smooth overtones. Yum yum. Some hints of banana. This brew is very clear and doesn't have much head to stick around. It's really really good beer. Go get some! Cheers! PlS. I'll have to add a pic later - saving bottle;)"
"I guess I just don't like this style at all because it was one of the worst beers I have ever gotten from sierra nevada and I'm not a fan of there flagship apa either. The best way I could describe this brew is imagine an ideal coors. The color was pale yellow. The smell reminded me of olive oil and the taste was rice cake like blandness. The mouth feel was slick and oily. I could not drink more then one of these. Drinking it ice cold out of the bottle only barely made it drinkable."
"D- This beer drinks astonishingly quick!"
"Edit: 4/27/14 : I've come along with this beer. Better than I remembered and quite enjoyable session-wise."
"D - This was a very easy drinking beer, my idea of a real pilsener the goes great on those hot southern days"
"This beer poured a clear yellow color with a this frothy head. not much lacing, but the head lingers for a while. Smells of crisp hops with a slight hop balance. And the taste! so crisp! So refreshing! a bit more on the hops side. Goes down oh so easily, making it great as a session brew. Highly recommended on a hot day. The perfect summer afternoon beer."
"Pours a straw yellow with thick fluffy white head. Good carbonation can be seen in the glass. Good clean crisp hop and malt aroma. Nice crisp malt backbone with a large earthy hop flavor and bitterness. The malt flavor ends and only the bitterness remains in the finish. Good mouthfell and drinkability."
"D- Pretty drinkable, especially on a warm summer day. A decent session beer too."
"D- An enjoyable session beer and a nice take on the style. This goes down easy and is smooth."
"Other comments: A very clean lager with a gentle, summery personality. If it was a woman, it would be a quietly beautiful girl-next-door that you would frollick through a field of flowers with (but not one you marry)."
"I'm starting to get quite partial to Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. I have yet to try one that I didn't like and this one was no exception, even though I'm usually not too much on lagers. This one poured a standard golden color, and what scent it had was malty with a touch of citrus. I was thinking at the time, well here goes Sierra's perfect run with me. I'm not going to like this one. The taste really caught me off guard though. It was a really nice citrus flavor, with quite a lot more hoppiness than I expected from a lighter beer. It was carbonated more than I typically like... but it was still quite drinkable. Good on a hot day when you're really thirsty. All in all, if I want a lager, I'll definitely get it again."
" D: This is a very drinkable summer beer with a good taste that i would buy agian and i could see me taking this out on the golf course for sure."
"Drinkability: Fairly mild and balanced Pilsner. Easy drinking."
"D: I wish this was a year-round offering. It's not jaw-droppingly good, but it'd be nice to have more quality pilsners widely available."
"12oz bottle. Pours clear straw yellow with a small white head that disappears quickly--a bit like a macro. Smells lightly of citrus initially, followed by sweet graininess and some grassy hop notes. The hop character is stronger in the flavor, giving it a mild bitterness overall, with the grainy malt bill in the background. Light body with medium-high carbonation. Pleasant overall."
"D: summery in the sense of a ""super good"" lawnmower beer"
"This is nothing fancy or spectacular. It's just a good beer."
"Pale gold with a rocky white, fluffy head that sticks some lace on the glass. Saaz hops and munich malt with doughy grain and lemon rounding out the smell. Tastes of toasted grain with a fresh dose of euro hoppiness in the mostly clean finish. This tastes like what I would imagine a really fresh, real czech pils would taste like. Smooth with a light mildly creamy body and seltzery carbonation. A really nice beer and an underappreciated style."
"All in all, I wouldn't turn this one away. There's a time and a place for a good lager, and I guess this comes close to fitting the bill. Sits ahead of many euro pils out there in my mind, but i still can't quite call it impressive, as it just leaves me feeling like I missed something. Drinkable, sure. but there are other more striking pilseners out there."
"Mouthfeel: Good amount of carbonation which I like in lagers. Not heavy at all, but there is a chewiness to it."
"It's called summerfest and that's when you'd drink it. Otherwise, it's kind of average. More of a mood beer."
"This beer pours a nice clear golden color with a nice white head. It has a grainy aroma with a bit of citrus hop presence in the nose. Its taste again has a nice citrus hop bite to go along with the clean malt character. It has a light, crisp and clean mouthfeel and this beer is wonderful for a hot summer day. I dig everything that SN does, even their light beers are great!"
"Drinkability: Goes down very smooth, and very easy to drink. As its name would suggest, this is a great summer beer. It's not the best pilsner I've ever had, but it's a solid beer."
"Mouthfeel is light and a bit creamy. As for drinkability, I had a bit of trouble with it. A little to ""robust"" of a pilsner for my tastes.. would have enjoyed something dryer."
"Easy to drink, light summer fare. Great for a hot day in the yard or a barbecue."
"Sierra Nevada Summerfest Lager pours a crystal clear yellow with a thin head and light to moderate carbonation. The aroma is light dry grainy malt with a vague whiff of herbal hops. The flavor is crisp and dry with some light pilsner malt upfront followed by light spicy hop flavor. There is just a bit of lingering bitterness in the finish. Overall this is a very crisp, drinkable summer beer, but it just didn't have quite enough flavor for me."
"very crisp..very tasty...definetly reccomend this for anyone.."
"D - not the best beer SN makes, but a flavorful lager, with a refreshing crispness to it; perfect for summer cookouts and for dispensing to unsuspecting macro drinkers"
"D: Super drinkable, I could drink Summerfest all day long."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I could definitely enjoy 2-3 pints of this on a warm day, so crisp & refreshing, so balanced & hopy! I absolutely love this beer, and everything about it, I really enjoyed the toasted hop bitterness coupled with the lite citrus orange peel and grapefruit flavors. Thirst quenching, and highly drinkable! This is a very nice summer lager, and I recommend everybody give it a try when they can. Cheers!"
"Verdict: Summerfest is just a solid, tasty American version of the classic Czech Pilsener. I'd love to slip one of these to one of my macro drinking buddies and see what they thought of it."
"Looked pale yellow in color, small white head lacing the glass. Smelled of Pilsner malt, and citrusy hints. Taste of strong pilsner as expected and nice citrus notes. I thought the play of the citrus and Pilsner flavors had a light licorice like taste when together. Medium bodied - definitely not your average pilsner lager , nice thickness to it. Had one with dinner and then off to a comedy show, but I would have had another."
"The pour was a good solid gold color with a small lacing up top. Both the smell and taste were light and not imposing. Good beer but overall did not provide enough depth for me to choose it over other summer lagers in the future."
"Overall, a very good beer - great for a hot summer day."
"Picked up a six pack to drink with friends on their deck on a hot Sunday afternoon. Poured mine into a standard pint glass. Bright yellow color. Lots of carbonation. Fairly large head, but that went away fast. Pilsener clarity to the body. A nice looking beer to say the least. Smell was OK, got some hops in the nose. Taste was pretty good but not too strong, which how a summer beer should be I guess. Nice balance of malt and hops, but I did get a bit of a corn-like flavor on the first few sips. Also, I though the aftertaste was a bit sticky at the finish. This beer was not as crisp as I had hoped for. But, it was light, flavorful, and not too high in abv. Pretty refreshing on a warm day. I'd buy this again over some locally marketed summer beers."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served a nice crisp golden yellow with a nice frothy off-white head. Aroma is a some sweet malts with a mild citrus hop presence. The taste is a smooth subtle blend of sweet malts and crisp citrus hops, not overpowering at all and certainly in tune for summer. The beer is very light and crisp and would make a great lawnmower beer. This one is certainly enjoyable for the style."
"Light, clear, yellow and bubbly. This is what pilseners should aspire to be: light, crisp, clean, thirst-quenching, palate-cleansing, with enough alcohol to let you know you're drinking, and enough taste to let you know you're drinking beer. I chose this to go with Mexican food and, as it turns out, it is well-suited for that. I recommend serving this at summer parties or barbecues to friends who normally drink macro lagers--they should clearly notice the difference in quality."
"Drinkability: Summer beers can be hard to like, everybody loves a bigger beer but when it's 90 degrees and sunny you need something to quench your thirst and at the same time keep your interest. This beer does it. SN provides all the drinkable characterisitcs to make this a go-to summer beer for the craft beer drinker or the BMC head. I can see lounging on the shore with a few of these or even cracking one open after a long day of work in the sun. Very drinkable and refreshing. Well done!"
"The mouthfeel is light, crisp, and refreshing, very nice for a summer beer. This leads to a very drinkable package."
"Overall: If you are expecting a hopped up pilsner, this is not for you. This is a very well done lager by a brewery that is known for Ales."
"D - Not bad overall, glad to know SN doesn't have to overkill a beer with hops to make it drinkable."
"D- Pretty high. This is a light beer, and great on a summer day. One of the bros. said this was a good beer to show to a macro drinking buddy and I couldn't agree more."
"Worth a try, don't get your hopes up."
"The pour is a very clear gold. There's a pretty clean fruity hop smell up front. It tastes great-very crisp and simple up front witg citrus hops lingering on the back of the tongue well after the fact. Altogether its very clean up front with a light mouthfeel-this is a very drinkable summer brew."
"This beer pours a clear golden color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes into moderate lacing. The aroma is full of loads of spicy noble hops with bready malt underneath. The taste is just as spicy and crisp as the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is one easy drinking pilsener. I will certainly drink this again."
"Mf/D - Complex and drinkable? Holy cow."
"The beer pours a pale yellow/straw colour with a great big fluffy white heat. Lots of carbonation. Looks great. The nose on the beer is grainy/bready with a spiciness from the saaz hops; it smells great. The beer has a spiciness from the saaz and a nice grainy/bready flavour to come through. The beer is quite bitter and spicy. I love it. The only thing from keeping this from a 5 on the taste is that it's not a completely clean lager. The mouthfeel is aqueous, thin and watery, but in a great way. This beer is incredibly drinkable."
"If it was a warm day, and wanted something to quench my thirst, I can see grabbing one of these. Other than that, it doesnt seem to give off much flavor."
"This is very drinkable."
"Overall very refreshing and nicely made Pilsener."
"Taste is good and a sweetness is what comes to mind first, more than I was expecting, almost honey-like. Macro lagers taste nothing like this beer that for sure. Mouthfeel is soft and somewhere in the middle but leaning light. This is a good lager that is definitely worth a spin."
"Pours a golden yellow colored body, clear & fizzy. With a huge head, white, and slowly diminishing. Has a strong aroma of malts, and sweetness. An aroma balanced by some hops. Also a very malty taste, and somewhat dry."
"Cheers!"
"Won't be trying this again."
"3.0/5"
"(rated May 30, 2007)"
"Tasted on 7/24/08."
"The taste is mostly herbal with a hint of pine and some bread and grain. It has light sweetness and crisp, slightly dominant bitterness. Overall, it's pleasant and clean, very drinkable, and with moderately full body and flavour. It's a lot more flavourful, full bodied, and balanced than Sierra Nevada's omnipresent pale ale, which I find practically tasteless except for bitter grapefruit."
"D: Taste is better than a lot of pilseners I've had."
"One word for this beer: crisp. It has a nice snap to it as you sip and its very refreshing. It may not be as extreme as other beer styles out there but this one is great to have on a nice, hot day. I have yet to be let down from this brewery and they seem to tackle all assortments of styles with ease."
"Drinkability- A great beer to sit back with and have a hearty meal, it begs for a steak."
"Zesty lager that has a lot more going for it than a lot I've reviewed, not bad at all."
"Summerfest is a well crafted beer that fits the season well with its supremely easy drinkability and quenching qualities. I could drink this all day long on a hot one, and I'm not much of a lager fan except when very well done. A solid brew from a solid brewery. Cheers Sierra Nevada!"
"pours light golden, good clarity and nice white head. Nose- very grassy . Taste- grassy, herbal and spicy hops with light toasty malts. Medium mouthfeel for a lager of this style, but finishes clean. Dry finish with crisp carbonation. Good summer time quaffer."
"D: Taste is a bit better than last year but still not one I recommend."
"D - A nice simple light lager with some grassy flavors. This is one of the better pilsners I've had so far and I hope to find some better and more complex ones in the future. Very drinkable and great to quench a summer thurst, but for the price (Like $8.00 a six), I'd rather get twice as much bitburger."
"Delicious grassy and spicy use of the Saaz hops. A nice bite on the end. Somewhat creamy body, but not what I would describe as full. Very drinkable in either a hot summer day or the current cooler version as we head towards fall. Clean and well done."
"Poured out of the bottle a light amber color with one finger of tan head. Poor retention and laced sparingly. The aroma was odd at first, concentrated lager. But after it was allowed to breathe a bit the malt was pleasant coupled with some floral hops. The flavors were also distinctly lager-esque, bready malts and a very crisp hop bite. I found it more hoppy than anything else though. Heavy to medium carbonation in the lighter bodied liquid gave the beer a fizzy mouthfeel. Lighter than most lagers as one would expect of a summer style but a little misbalanced and lacking depth."
"As with alot of Sierra Nevada products, I can't see myself drinking this too often. They just seem to be a brewery that doesn't quite hit the balance point often enough."
"The beer poured a pale yellow with an average head. The scent left a bit to be desired as I found it to be rather bland. There was a slight metallic-ness taste to it. Overall mouth feel wasn't bad. This is an ok beer, I certainly wouldn't turn it down...though for 9.00 I wouldn't purchase it myself again."
"Drinkability: For a summer lager, it seems to be a bit too full-bodied. Not quite sure if I would drink a bunch of these during the summer months. Not great, but not too bad either."
"My first reaction to this was that it tasted like a Lager. Then I realized that they made it like that. Bright golden color topped with a medium foam head that fades away quite quickly. Aroma was a little malty with some lemon. I noticed the citrus a little more in the taste along with a malty, grassy flavor. I don't really see what makes this so good for the summer but it was a decent beer."
"not overly carbonated, which is nice, but a good refreshing fizz. pretty light and beautiful summer beer, good for pounding on a hot summer day."
"Overall, not a beer that I'd try again. The label didn't specify the style and I mostly like SA beers so I thought I'd give it a try in my mixed 6ixer. Just another one to mark of the list."
"I suggest you seek it out on tap and get yourself a pint or two."
"Note: I reviewed this as a pale lager, not a ""czech pilsner", although I could see that it may be more appropriate to label it so with its slightly more noticeable hop presence, I find it doesn't have some of the characteristics I dislike in czech pilsners."
"Clear golden in color. Aroma is somewhat hoppy. Nothing in particular stands out. Mouthfeel is thin and crisp. Very dry, saltine cracker-like in taste initially. The hop bitterness is the main focus of the flavor here. Hoppy, crisp and bland describes Sierra Nevada's Summerfest. This beer lacks character. This is a summer offering not worth you time. It's not quenching or refreshing IMO."
"Overall, a nice drinkable czech pils"
"M&D: lively but still smooth on the mouthfeel, with a medium-plus hoppiness in support of the overall malty flavour upfront, although in the end a slightly sticky mouthfeel gradually prevails. This is a decent lager overall."
"D: Nice combination of mouthfeel and taste made this beer a fairly drinkable one. Definitely a nice summer beer."
"I picked this up really cheap on sale, for less than six bucks. At that price, combined with the easy-drinking tastiness, makes for a pretty drinkable brew in my book. At that price though, SN Pale Ale seemed a better deal, like I was getting more flavor and enjoyment for my money. This beer is good, but I wouldn't mind if everything was notched up just a little bit."
"D - Easy drinking, if bland. This might not be a bad brew for hanging with friends outside, but overall it's kinda boring."
"What more can I say, the beer is fairly tasteless, and I drink beer in park for taste. If I was at a bar and it was either this or macro lagers, I'd probably take the macro lager because the price doesn't add up to the taste. Very disappointing."
"Drinkability- Had a very good drinkability. It was light and refreshing like a summer beer should be. You could easily have many of these. This is where the main appeal of this type of beer comes from, and it was good here. I didn't love the beer itself but after one I immediately opened another because it was very drinkable."
"Great summer beer. Only 5.0% ABV means downing a few with barbeque wouldn't be a bad idea. If you want a refreshing summer beer with more flavor and extras, this isn't for you."
"Nice golden color, very light aromas of a vaguely malty honey, and light orange citrus. But, what you taste is just damn good beer. Hops arrive on the tongue after the swallow with no bitterness, but the classic lager malt flavor is not compromised. Very clean and nearly ""light," except for the more medium body, and fine, smooth carbonation. The head remained 1/2"" high down to the bottom of the glass. Truly enjoyable, and ridiculously drinkable. Seems like the perfect beer for seafood in the summer."
"Clear yellow lager with a 1-inch foam cushion that recedes to lace glass. Smells initially of honey, floral nectar and spicy hops. Malt contributes to initial sweet taste sensations but the beer finishes with a crisp dry bitterness. Sierra Nevada shows some versatility, branching out from their cascade-hopped ales to nail down a pilsner!"
"Overall a nice light beer with enough flavor to put it well up above average. Great summer brew."
"I look forward to this beer again in the coming years. Excellent find."
"The color is amber (sort of a cross between yellow and orange), with a minimal head. It smells good enough; but the catch is the easy drinkability and clean, pure taste."
"D - Great on a hot Sunday afternoon for sure."
"3.0/2.5/2.5/3.0/3.0"
"Pours a very, very pale yellow in color with only a little froth of a head forming on the pour. Very lagerish on the smell and nothing else to note. It looks very BMC'ish. Taste is prickly and very BMC'ish. I was expecting at least some West Coast hops, but nothing. Really disappointed. Don't waste your time."
"i am the first to admit i don't have the pallate of some peope, i did smoke for years, but i don't get this beer, i tastes like a macro, a good macro, very good and i would drink it again, but its not what i expect from a pilsner."
"Pours a clear gold with fast fading fluffy white head. Smell: grassy, spicy, somewhat muted bready malt smell. Taste: salty wheat cracker malt, spicy, grassy hops, hint of lemon. Mouthfeel: fairly standard, sort of a salty drying finish. Fairly refreshing."
"D: This drinks well, but it's not too good on its own. Have it with a meal for sure."
"D-As a general rule im not the biggest fan of lagers but this one is an exception ill grab it again before the summer is out but its not gonna be something i always have"
"Drinkability of Summerfest is high especially on humid days or during stints of physical exertion. To be safe, have at least a case available in anticipation of friends stopping by..."
"Pours an appetizing, semi-transparent honey-golden with a little white head. Aroma is fairly strong, malty, wheaty and inviting. Flavor is mainly malty and wheaty with a hint of hops and a whisper of fruit, not too complex but still pleasing and refreshing. Texture is smooth so it goes ""down the hatch"" easily."
"It would be my perfect lawnmower beer if I only had a lawn."
"D: I have yet to be disappointed by a SN beer. Nice summer session beer alone or with food."
"From the bottle into a stange, it's frothy white head floats on top the clear straw colored body. Aroma is grassy. In taste, it's more of a helles lager than a pilsner to me, as there isn't much hop profile, which is surprising given this is a Sierra Nevada brew. Somewhat like drinking saltine crackers with grassy notes to it. It's still a pretty good hot weather beer."
"I found this to be incredibly drinkable. It just isn't too much of any one thing - just light and refreshing with just the right amount of flavor for the recipe. By the time I got to the bottom of the glass, I was really digging this brew."
"An all-around good lager. Nothing over-the-top special in appearance (standard straw-yellow) or aroma, the standard grainy, husky malts and a minute amount of hop character reminiscent of their Pale Ale, only in much smaller amounts. Exceptionally refreshing and very easy to drink. A fantastic session beer for the summer months."
"D- A nice little Czech pils that is nice and refreshing on this hot and humid PA day. It's not going to blow your mind, but it's worth a try if you haven't tried it yet. Cheers!"
"Taste is citrusy (like the smell would suggest) and finishes like a mild IPA. I was surprised by this beer. I am not normally a fan of Sierra Nevada."
"This is a great little lager though I think it's a bit over priced. It is a golden straw typical lager, but it is much more aromatic. It has a full flavored nice pine needle like hop kind of characteristic of the brewery. This is a great beer that is widely available. Not quite the level of victory or anchor steam, but it is worth a try and good in its own right."
"I met the Sierra Nevada guys at the Beerfest in Boston, and they indicated that this would all be gone shortly after the 4th of July. Glad I got myself a six pack to enjoy over the next couple of weeks."
"Drinkability is pretty good, for the style it's well made and very clean. I'd prefer a bit more character, it's not really my style, but well done."
"Mouthfeel is a bit of a disappointment for me. Generally I like a lager to be pretty crisp and clean with the carbonation, and this is almost flat. It is still pretty drinkable, I was able to put three down without noticing much. I just had higher expectations."
"Dark yellow in appearance, with mild carbonation, and very little head. Has a light grainy smell and is sweet to taste with a slight bitterness and citrus to it's aftertaste. A pretty watery and light beer. I would say it's very drinkable though not overly impressive."
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts- This has got to be the most disappointed I've been with a beer in a while. I guess I just took it for granted that all Sierra Nevada products were worth the price and a good representation of the style as well. Honestly, I wouldn't have minded the lack of flavor and character so much if it weren't for the off flavors. I'm sorry for such a negative review SN, but after paying $9.75 retail for a sixer of this, I must say I would have rather spent a couple more bucks and got a 30 rack of PBR. At least that I can say I actually enjoy every once in a while on a hot day."
"Poured a light copper, mostly clear, and slightly bubbly. Smell was nothing out of the ordinary and the taste was only slightly less boring. Nothing partiularly distinct about this one, but not bad. Drinkable but extremely average. I'd much rather celebrate summer with some flavor."
"This is a great session beer, good mouthfeel. Crisp stuff, but I'd rather have another lager over this."
"Drinkability is high, I drank these all night along at a recent concert (The National @ SD HOB), there is something about the grain and citrus intermix that really does it for me, even though this is a simple and straightforward beer, I love this for my summer session needs, pleasantly surprised here"
"D: A nice summertime quencher really, crisp and clean and will keep you coming back for more. Enjoyable in multiples."
"d- not something I'd have again, but I'm not going to throw it away either."
"Light refreshing lager. High carbonation with lots of flavor and lightly hopped at least for a Sierra Nevada beer anyway. Good BBQ beer where you want a good beer but it does not need to be the center piece."
"Overall average, I wanted to try something different. Pours a pale yellow/brown with a small head. Taste is crisp and carbonated, but refreshing. Up front you can definitly taste the malt and a slight bit of hops (i was surprised there weren't more hops from SN!). Not a very complex taste going on here, but there's nothing really bad about it. Aftertaste is a pleasant bread / yeast flavor. I think I'm a little biased because I'm such a fan of Pale Ale and this one is quite different. I probably won't buy this again, in favor of new excursions and old favorites (pale ale!!!) thanks for reading."
"D- Summerfest is a fairly light beer, with a refreshing crispness to it. It could have a slightly bold flavor profile subtle is the name of the game here. Something you could have on you porch our at a bbq."
"A rather understated lager with a slight lemon essence in the mouth. Prepared more as a summer special brew, the light body and underweight taste and mouthfeel make for decent quaffing but is perhaps a bit lithe for my taste. I have had this brew over the last three seasons and must say that I seem to dislike it more as time goes on. The 2007 ""vintage"" was the most un-enjoyable while the 2006 was the most satisfying thus placing the 2008 in between. Effusing wallpaper paste like nose from the light malts unfortunately reminds me of some of the abysmal beers from Saranac, but nevertheless this is many notches better than that. A good summer brew that will find comfort with those who prefer a softer easygoing style."
"D: Not crazy about the style but this one has the hops I expected with the subtle flavors. Breadiness was the best aspect and still remains refreshing."
"This is a rather average pilsner, and I was expecting a tad better. The beer pours a very pale yellow with a decent white head that doesn't last that long. Some retention though. The smell is Saaz hops, corn husk, maybe some cooked veggies, very pilsner-esque. The taste is light, moderate to low carbonation, very crisp, peppery, a tad bit of tangyness, some lemon hints as well. The peppery tang is a bit of a turn off and lasts too far into the finish. The beer is light, refreshing, uncomplicated, and altogether pretty average."
"Overall it wasn't bad or difficult to finish, just nothing special."
"Picked a six while vacationing in Myrtle Beach, SC. Pours a golden yellow color with a big billowy white head that clings nicely to the glass after every sip. Aroma is of sweet malt with that great Sierra Nevada hop aroma.The taste is very clean and refreshing, sweet toasted malts with nice bitter hop finish. This beer goes down almost too easy. Can't wait to get some for my next cookout."
"Poured into a pint glass. Gold color with a white head that leaves no lace. Saaz aroma is immediately apparent. Pale malt comes through in the nose too. Flavor is mildly tangy, with lemon and a touch of spice atop a sweetish malt base. Refreshing and drinkable."
"Overall, this is a very light, clean, drinkable beer that is a bit rough-around-the-edges. The flavor is lackluster and honestly rather bland with no standout qualities. It would be alright on a hot summer day to quench your thirst, but probably not one I'd choose to re-visit."
"Eric"
"Very refreshing and not one I would turn down if offered, but as for buying, there a lot better examples of the style."
"MF&D - A good summer choice. Light, crisp and refreshing."
"Pours a bright but pale gold, crystal clear with lots of bubblies and a solid whitish head with nice stringy chunks of lacing. The Saaz aroma hops come out and shake your hand, some nice citrus and grainy malts in there. The taste is refreshing as can be, with crispy clean herbal and citrus hop giving it a good start with a backbone of slightly sweet malts. The body is a just-right medium, good carbonation, its a thoroughly drinkable beer, an excellent session buddy to pair with a beautiful summer day. I'm not sure this reminds me of 'Vienna lager', its more like SNPA's kid brother."
"Perfect hot weather brew."
"D: I could drink these all night, and they are almost dangerously difficult. A great session beer."
"poured a golden yellow color with just a good amount of faint white soapy head that fades away shortly after it was poured. Smell is heavy with the corn, and grain aromas. Taste is somewhat like a hefe with a little banana and clove tastes. The mouth feel was a little light, but that was to be expected for this style. I definitely had this as a session beer."
"12 oz bottle. Pours golden with 2 cm of off white head, mostly diminishing. Aroma of lemony hops. Malty start, slight hop finish, balanced and light in the middle. Some lacing, light carbonation, light body, and light on alcohol. Overall drinkable as a summer beer, if you need something light and like the style."
"Pours a very light color, almost like an american macro..but that is par for this style. Foamy head, disappates quickly. Smells of some fruit, like lemon zest. Easy to drink, nothing offensive..a bit of hoppy twinge on the sip. Not much on the nose. A bit watery, not sierra's best. I will get it again, a nice lawnmower beer, but I've had better."
"Immensely drinkable, refreshing, and certainly better than the imported Czech lagers on most of our shelves."
"This is the type of beer that you can drink just one and be completely satisfied, much like Sierra Nevada's other brews. The summerfest here is not only just a beer, but a great creation and wonderful thing to experience as well."
"Worth trying, and one I'd recommend. It is not, however, to summer brews as Bigfoot is to Barleywine."
"2011 release- Upgrade!"
"Poured from bottle to a pilsner glass, a clear yellow with a white bubbly head and moderate lacing. Smelled like corn, lawn clippings and lemons. Tasted bland with a trace of lemons. Not much flavor in this one at all. Goes down easy with light body and crisp nothingness. I could drink a bunch of these but there are lots of better choices out there."
"Drinkability & Notes: Not a huge fan of summer seasonal beers but this is one of my favorites. Very drinkable, very tasty, and easy to find in stores!"
"12oz bottle with 2008 date poured into a pint glass. Crystal clear golden color with 2 fingers of white lacing which quickly dissipates leaving minimal lacing. Smell is earthy and somewhat sweet with a hint of lemon. Taste is light and delicate. Very clean with a bright floral beginning, balanced middle and a dry crisp finish. Mouthfeel is light and very smooth. Quite refreshing and highly drinkable on a hot summer day. Great example of an American (i.e. hoppy) version of the style."
"Pours a clear golden, medium white head forms, quickly settles down to a thin ring, not really any lacing. Smell is sweet and grassy, some honey, biscuit, lemon, very clean herbal/floral aroma. Taste is lightly bready/biscuits, citrus, some grassy hops, quite a dry grainy finish, balanced, not a whole lot of flavour but solidly drinkable. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, very refreshing. I could keep this around for the summer indeed."
"I think I have enjoyed past summerfests by Sierra Nevada but if they are chamging the recipe each year like their Celebration Ale I certainly do not like this summer's recipe. It had it chilled in a pint glass. Poured a nice bright, lucid golden color with a decent head and hardly any carbonation. The smell was okay with some some malt sweetness and pilsner notes. The taste was of a typical lager but not much complexity. Reminded me too much of a Corona which turned me off because I certainly don't want to put a lime in my Sierra Nevada. I guess I could do a side by side comparison but I'm just not feeling the macro lager taste. I stick to the pale and Celebration ales."
"This is a good beer-- who cares if it's a seasonal or how it compares to other sierra nevada offerings. This is a real lager, and you could probably convert several bud/coors/miller/pbr drinkers with this brew. Pours a rich gold, with a good size head. Smells crisp and somewhat hoppy-- tastes hoppier than expected. Mouthfeel is good-- light but you know its there, and it forces you to really taste rather than swill. This beer redeems the american lager category."
"Server up a deep gold in color with a nice head. Has a touch of hop aroma, slightly herbal or grassy. The taste was better than most for the style. Reminded me much more of an ale than an Pilsner. The hop profile was citricy and slightly spicy. A great gateway beer, refreshing and would have worked in a session."
"Good crisp mouthfeel, not too much carbonation. Tremendously drinkable -- the ultimate lawnmower beer. Amazingly refreshing -- what a Bud or even a Pilsner Urquell could never hope to be. I could drink these all day in the summertime. In fact, this is what I would probably stock up on for a cookout. Interesting and well-crafted enough to please my beer geek friends, even the ones who crave a cellar-temperature Russian Imperial Stout on an 85-degree day, but accessible enough to please those who usually shy away from anything more complex than Bud or MGD."
"The carbonation level seemed rather low in this, but it was otherwise a well balanced beer."
"Overall, this is a fine session lager and a good summer beer."
"Also, going back for smoe more SN styles. Not sure why they haven't found thier way into my cart, but, thats not a problem now!"
"D = Fair drinkability, the taste is decent but otherwise relatively uninspiring. I got almost no smell and the mouthfeel was not that great."
"Notes: I paired this with some Gouda cheese I picked up at Whole foods and it was perfect. I could have a few of these on a hot summer day or just about any day with some cheese. Maybe this is not the greatest beer for the style,but it is a good example of a fine summer brew."
"D - Classic, no-frills lager that's certainly quaffable. Nothing special, though."
"Nice looking lager with a good bit of head and carbonation. Faint hoppy aroma that's nice but not pronounced. A very nice mixture of hops and malt for the taste, and a decent level of carbonation. Definitely a thirst quencher, thanks for the beer WesWes."
"D: Fine, enjoyable and drinkable."
"The bottle has changed for 2008, so the photo needs updating. The appearance of the Summerfest is typical pilsener--light gold with some cloudiness and a thick white head. The smell is very subtle; there's a hint of floral hops with wheat. The taste is clean, hops with some bitterness. Not much aftertaste. Mouthfeel is crisp, not too much acidity. This is a very drinkable lager from Sierra Nevada, which as a brewery, never disappoints. A perfect refreshing beer on a hot summer day."
"Not a huge pilsner fan, so this one doesn't excite me that much, and probably my least fav I've tried from SN."
"D: This is a great easy drinking Czech pils. I am glad I grab a sixer of this even with the great pilsners in the area."
"I had gotten away from lagers, prefering the various ales instead. I can definitely say I will be haviing more of these though! The drinkability is right through the roof! Cool, refreshing, light, with temperatures already in the nineties here in Florida this will be a welcome summer beer."
"This beer lives up to it's advertising. Nice hot weather quaffer. Medium brown color. Very clean taste. This is what I think of when I here Bohemian style beer. Sierra Nevada seldom dissapoints. This beer will be going to Bear games this fall in a cooler full of ice. This is what American mass produced lager used to be ."
"An excellent summer brew that you can easily session. As a summer offering this is vastly superior to the Sam Adams summer beer. Another excellent product from SN."
"D: Can't think of a better summer beer at the moment. Nothing to strong or complex, but you can put em back and not have a heavy feel. Very nice brew."
"mouthfeel has good texture from the carbonation, malts play nice, anyone could enjoy this brew :D"
"D- A great summer beer. Incredibly refreshing, I had my first on my first visit to Santa Monica. After being exhausted from walking around I stepped into a pub and had this wonderful brew. Very easy drinking beer, good summer beer."
"D - An all-around well crafted lager from Sierra. Easy drinking and the perfect compliment to a sunny summer day."
"Drinkability is fairly high. Low alcohol is really sessionable, pils flavor is pretty classic but not really my style."
"A pretty pils style beer, pours clear golden with a lively though short-lived head. Lacing is poor, but the beer has a nice carbonation. I don't find the aroma particular appealing - thin and a little bit astringent. But the flavor is quite good - malty and tongue-grabbing, with a pleasant little whiff of noble hops and a satisfying cereal finish. Mouthfeel is good, though not as all encompassing as smaller rivals like Victory's Prima Pils or Troegs Sunshine Pils. While not the best Plisner on the market, this is a solid, drinkable entry that trumps most of its competitors, particularly any of the mass market versions."
"Never thought I'd rate a lager this high. Even though it's not my favorite style, beers like this have a definite time and place (post-lawn mow would be good, if I had, you know, a lawn), and this is one I wouldn't mind having in that time or in that place."
"I prefer a sunshine pils for a summer pils, but this is still a good choice."
"Pours a crystal clear yellow with somewhat fizzy white head. 2 finger head with ok retention and good lacing. Smell is a bit bland compared to other SN products but then again I guess this is a style totally different from what they're use to. Some citrus, some bitterness to the nose. Taste is good, a bit of stray/grass as expected from this style and then at the end a slight bitterness from those good ol' SN hops. Again, very light touch but good. Very light and crisp, higher carbonation. Overall not a bad beer and good for the style, but I think they should focus more on their hoppy beers. Thats what they do best."
"M / D: A sharp zest of carbonation, refreshing and crisp. Unfortunately, not too impressive in either taste or aroma. Otherwise, this could do alright. It's not bad, by any means... it's just not very intriguing to my palate. Might have it from time to time, but it's nothing to actively seek out. SN has far better offerings than this - the standard pale ale being one of them."
"Sierra Nevada Summerfest pours a crystal clear yellow with a fluffy, white head. The smell has a lot of sour/spicy hop notes, lemon, and a bit of sulfur. A light malt sweetness up front leads to some sour and bitter tanginess on the end of the swallow. The bitterness sticks around, but it's astringent and not pleasant like the bitterness that comes from Sierra Nevada's Ales. The mouthfeel is what you would expect from the style; medium-thin and fizzy. Not a bad American Lager, but probably my least favorite beer I've had from SN."
"Drinkability is great. I would hunt down this beer every summer but then again, most Sierra Nevada limited edition / seasonals are excellent to hunt down. If I missed out on this beer, I'd be sad but not enough to rend life and limb to get this year's edition of Summerfest."
"D - While it isn't the most flavorful beer, the light body and nice earthy hop finish bolster its drinkability. Definitely a crisp and refreshing summer brew."
"I'm a little disappointed with this one: I was expecting a typical 4+ offering from SN. The skunk part aside, this would likely be a run-of-the-mill pils. I could not find the typical fresh hop smells or flavors."
"It's a good beverage and I could enjoy a few here or there."
"D: Extremely sessionable beer. I'm going to have a hard time convincing myself not to finish this six pack."
"D - A nice easy drinking summer refresher."
"Must thank my sister for bring this when she visited this past week. First time giving this brew a try and needless to say I was not disappointed. The brew poured to a somewhat deep golden color with some amber like highlights. Fair sized white head that has nice retention leaving good retention. The aroma is a nice mix of malt (sweet, slight grass like, fresh feel) and Hops (spice like feel in the nose when taking a deep smell). The flavors are nice, again malt comes to mind first but not as sweet as the nose would lead you to believe. The malt flavor quickly breaks to the hop which dominates the back half but not in an over powering way, saaz is clear in the flavor. Has a medium dry finish. Overall I like this brew, nice character, satisfying although not overly rememberable. I would get this again, but it will not stick in my mind to run out and get again."
"Classic pilsner appearance and aroma. Very light golden with a fairly decent head. Aroma of malt with that slight hoppiness zing in the background. Very clean tasting brew, nice and sharp and crisp. Was hoping for a tad more hoppiness coming from SN but its still a very good, very drinkable brew. Good grill beer..."
"Overall impression: Very drinkable - nice pilsner flavors - I can certainly see my self going through quite a bit of this over the summer."
"A reasonable stab at the style from a great brewery. Good start but tapered off and became a little less enjoyable late."
"Pretty good overall, but not my favorite beer. Probably my new favorite Czech Pilsener though. Refreshing on a nice day. I think this could have been a little cleaner and the appearance is nothing to grovel over."
"Light golden color with a thin white head. Aromas of fresh hay and sulfur. The flavor was the same with the addition of a crisp hop middle and finish. Clean and snappy. A great lager from an American craft ale giant. It would really make a perfect year-round beer - a natural lager companion to their pale ale."
"Overall, a tasty crisp and hoppy pilsner. Very thirst quenching and enjoyable."
"I had a second one with dinner.The lemony zest went well with the crab cakes my wife made."
"Overall-a finely constructed lawnmower beer, nothing too fancy or deep, but it tastes good and is well made, thumbs up from me."
"D: It's decently drinkable because it's so crisp, but it's a little to bitter and devoid of character to be a top-level session beer. For a pilsener, this is a really good beer. I haven't met a pils I really liked yet, but this one is the best I've had so far. It's a fairly sessionable brew, but the pils style probably wouldn't be my first choice for a session beer."
"d - easy drinking session beer, nothing to write home about but solid beer on a hot day."
"This is definitely not a style that I go out of my way for, but this is a refreshing summertime brew. Would be a good session/BBQ beer."
"D - Nice easily sessionable beer, and a fine offering from Sierra Nevada. Not their best (Celebration IMO) but certainly a nicely crafted beer."
"Pours morning after color, foamy egg white head with decent bubbles. Smells very fresh, lively, and malt dominated. On the very background, a subtlety of hops arise. To start off, a very RS dominated palate, that subsides everything. Only a slight bit of grass taste, followed completely by sweet malts pertaining to cheerio/honey flavors. Refreshing, and a good pool-side brew is the best way to look at it."
"Nicely carbonated, smooth and very drinkable."
"D - A pilsner with substance. Great beer that I can't wait to enjoy out in the Texas heat."
"I could drink buckets of these.. the problem is, I never gave it too much play until this year. I've had my fair share of Summerfest over the years and never put too much thought into it... this year, with the label change, I did a little research and decided to give it a proper go around. Really, it is a damn good pilsner .. I now am very interested in picking up the other locally available Czech Pils and trying in a row... I would bet this plays ball well with its European brothers."
"It's refreshing to see a West Coast brewery (other than Trumer) attack the classic pilsner style and do it well. This is also one of the more balanced beers put out by Sierra Nevada."
"Light fruity aroma, but mostly grainy and sweet. Grainy malt punch ends with a wheaty finish and crisp hops. Medium bodied, finishing crisp and dry, adding to its drinkability. Would be an awesome addition to the boat for fishing this summer."
"Drinkability: High drinkability. This beer is very well crafted, with no apparent flaws, it just might not be everyone's favorite style. Well suited for warm weather."
"Worth a shot..."
"Poured a clear as hell golden color with a decent head that quickly dissipated. The aroma is slightly grainy and hoppy. Kinda smells like a heinie but not skunked! This is one crispy clean tasting brew. The hops are quite present and the malt balances it out nicely. There is a slight citric flavor to it that is nice. The feel is crisp. I am usually not a fan of pilseners but this is the best one i have had to date! This is one refreshing and crisp as fuck brew. I wasn't crazy about it the first few bottles i have had the last few nights but I finally get it!"
"M/D - Very crisp and clean mouthfeel. Great summertime beer."
"D: Highly drinkable and I'll try it again when summer really hits. A good lager with a lot of bite but not a lot of smoothness."
"D- Quite refreshing with a light flavor that goes well with many food combonations"
"Pours a golden yellow color with a tall and medium bodied white head that sticks to the glass very well all the way down. Sweet malty aromas along with the famous hoppy aroma associated with the sierra nevada beers. The taste is very nice for this beer - nice sweetly toasted malts and a very refreshing bitter hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is alot like the other Sierra Nevada beers which are very crisp, fresh, and refreshing. This is a pretty drinkable beer."
"D - Easy and pleasant beer."
"Good beer, good times."
"O- It certainly isn't my favorite of the Sierra Nevada line, but that being said, it's still an ok beer."
"Pale golden, sunshiny color that maintains little to no head. Aromas of lemon, grass, and bread are evident. Taste is heavy on citrus with some nice crispness as well. Mouthfeel is fine - could use more carbonation. Not a bad summer beer - easy drinking nothing challenging here. Recommended."
"Not SN's best seasonal efforts, but I enjoyed this beer and would recommend it to a beer buddy."
"D: High. Very easy to throw back a few of these on a hot day or a typical Mississippi evening. Did note that taste sweetens a bit (malt comes to the front) as the beer warms. Very good brew and I am very happy to see this new entry to the MS market."
"Other than the lackluster appearance I enjoyed this beer. It didn't have that typical SN piney-ness about it, and is one of the few SN beers I probably couldn't identify as a SN beer just by the smell. Nicely done, and a beer I will probably return to again a few more times during the summer."
"I tasted the 2008 version of the summerfest lager. I poured the beer into my Michael Jackson summer glass. The beer is a golden yellow with a lace head which sticks around for a while. The nose is hay with some slight spiciness (cinnamon) in the background like the bottle says, it smells crisp and clean. The taste is wonderfully balanced light unobtrusive, but the zesty crisp clean taste with hints of citrus. The mouthfeel is quick clean and dry with a very short finish. This is the epitome of a great summer beer, light refreshing, but taste great and is well balanced. It paired great with spicy Mexican food, I may have found my summer go to beer."
"Overall, not bad, but not a pils that I'd crave regularly."
"I applaud anyone making respectable lagers, but there are a few craft brewers out there making a better version that Sierra Nevada. Victory and Brooklyn come to mind. This one isn't bad, but I would pick the others I mentioned over this one next time."
"The aroma is malty and the taste is crisp and clean. It has a malty backbone with a spicy finish. In the mouth is leaves some of peppery spice on the tongue. Overall this would be a wicked session beer if it was August or September."
"A one-finger off-white head sits atop this almost clear golden brew. Smells of very light lager/skunk up front, but nothing to fret about. Some grass, subtle malts and hops, and distant sweetness also come forth. Tastes crisp and a bit bitter. Very light bodied and drinkable, but not overly interesting. Carbonation is fairly active. Not much else to say."
"D - Decent I suppose, but don't let this one warm up at all, it turns to funk. I would've been happy with the ESB for a few more months, but whatever. Not bad overall."
"A very refreshing and drinkable lager. This beer is a staple in the my fridge over the summer months; I just wish Sierra Nevada had waited a little closer to summer to release it. Highly recommended."
"Brew up Summerfest all year long. America needs a Czech Pilsener like this all of the time."
"Great summer/BBQ/party beer."
"Drinkability: A nice little surprise. It's quafftastic!"
"The color of this brew was golden and copper, with a white head. The smell was grainy and spicy, a nice burst of hops as well. The taste was clean and crisp as others have said. A hint of citrus, maybe lemon in the background, but predominantly spicy hops up front. Mouthfeel was pleasant, good amount of carbonation made it great to drink during the winter and gave me hope of the warm summer! A very drinkable beer, would go great with a rack of ribs or some BBQ chicken."
"On draft at the Gingerman. Poured a medium gold with good lacing and with a lightly almost wheaty, malty smell with a touch of hops and sweetness. Very nicely balanced, yet simple and subtle smell. Taste at first is a nice crisp lightly bitter hop bite, followed by a smooth honey malt taste in the finish. Very refreshing and perfect for a summer day. Nicely carbonated and just what a crisp refreshing summer beer should be. Simple, but done very well."
"d: umm....i am pretty dissapointed with Sierra Nevada on this one. it may be the most flavorless beer i have ever had. drink it only if it is super hot and there is no other macrobrewed doody beer there."
"The drinkability is seasonal at best, good summer brew, MK"
"D- sierra nevada always pulls a high score somewhere, and for this baby it's in the D zone. light, refreshing, it's like budweiser x1000."
"M/D: Medium bodied, mild carbonation finishes very dry with bitter aftertaste. Nothing too spectacular, nothing bad. Nice summer beer but coming from SN slightly disappointing compared to some of their other seasonals."
"A very good pilsener, one of the best i've had. Pale yellow color, not much in the nose beyond a typical all malt pilsener. You can very much tell it's all malt and with more hops than many pilseners, really smooth, light but not too light taste. Goes down easy but with a lot of flavor, definitely a good summer beer; too bad I got it in November! (It was on sale for 9.99 for 24, too good a deal to pass up for anything Sierra Nevada)"
"Drinkability - Easy drinking beer. Another great from from Sierra Nevada"
"M/D: Pretty well carbonated. Light bodied. Drinkability is pretty high on this one and is one that could be enjoyed in quantity. Other than that, it's not that much to write home about. There are a lot of Czech style Pilseners out there that offer much more than this one."
"Not a bad beer but not an impressive one either. This beer is light and mild and great if you want to take a step up from cheap stuff. It has a weak head when poured and doesn't have any flavors that really stand out. This is a good beer to have during dinner when you really want to tase your food and don't want your beer to overpower the meal. This beer does have good light hop after taste but if your looking for a beer to knock your socks off this is not the one. Try it, but get one of your friends to buy the six pack and have them give you one."
"Looks like a pretty standard pils, clear straw yellow with an active carbonation that is hard pressed to maintain any sort of head. First whiff says american macro-lager, but then a hoppy aroma lingers that sets it apart from that ilk. It lacks, though, the decoction-built malt body that would put in the same league as the czech lagers. This is a solid effort, and certainly worthy of lawnmower-class refreshment. This is what the big three (or is it two, now?) would be making if they had respect for their customers. If one of the big US macros had brewed this, I'd be quite pleased at their progress, but that's the glory of low expectations. I had higher hopes for SN."
"This one threw me off, not really crazy about it. Summer refresher?,,,not me so much."
"Mouthfeel is kind of light with a slight buzz of carbonation. The finish is fairly dry and crisp. Very thirst quenching - a great summertime beer."
"Summerfest pours a clear yellow gold with a thin but lasting white head. Surprisingly, it has moderate carbonation. It has an aroma of malt and grass. It has a very interesting taste, and its got the lager body and malt profile with a nice gentle fruity hop. Summerfest has a mild bitter finish and has a nice balance of lager and floral hop."
"A nice, easy to drink Pilsener that, while very easy to consume, wasn't incredibly refreshing like other summer style beers I've had. That said, with its slightly bitter aspects it would be fantasic with food. Dry white cheddar, whitefish, a simple salad, lobster, simply prepared shellfish, chicken, even zesty (not spicy) fare, etc. Definitely worth checking out, especially with food."
"Overall: you know, a pretty good lighter lager. Light refreshing, great for a hot summer day (or a little bit cooler day when they are on fire sale in the fall.) I really like the lemony aftertaste it leaves."
"A solid drinking beer that you could serve to your Bud Lite drinking buddies and maybe convert a few from the Dark Side."
"Sierra Nevada rarely does bold beers. But they are well-crafted and consistantly tasty. This one falls in nicely in their catalog, but i wouldnt get it again."
"Poured a clear golden color with a white head that didnt last too long. Light hoppy aroma that is a bit citrusy. Kind of disappointing for a Sierra Nevada beer. My brother made the remark that this would have been better as an ale. Taste was ok with a bit of hop character and fruitiness, but something just wasnt quite right. Decent, but thats about it."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear golden-yellow color, with a thin bubbly head. The smell is rather non-distinct like most pilsners, but there is hints of pale malts and a slight hoppiness to it. The taste is rather bitter, only a slight graininess otherwise, could be much better balanced and overall not that enjoyable. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a bubbly carbonation comprised of many fine bubbles. Drinkability suffers due to the fact that this beer just doesn't taste very good. All around ""average"" describes this beer at best."
"Pours a very pale golden yellow with a small, fizzy white head that lasts only 30 seconds. No lacing. Aroma is very subtle with hints of corn and a very slight fruitiness. No hop aroma at all. Taste is true to style, but rather lacking. Again, fruitiness noted and grassy herabal hops in the background. Mouthfeel is thin and goes down smooth.Overall, I think Sierra Nevada should stick to top-fermeting ales. A great beer to drink during these hot summer days in SoCal."
"Mouthfeel is very average, and this beer is decent to drink as there isn't much to it, but I'll pass for better pilsners."
"Reminds me of Budvar and a really good example of the style."
"2007 Edition According to the Label"
"Grab some of these before they are all gone if you would like to try them"
"Drinkability - This is well made and a good summer beer to down during the ""dog days"". I could very much keep this in my ""beer fridge"" during the summer months."
"D - Overall very easy drinking, taste is nicely balanced and has a good bit of hops in it. Worth a try."
"overall, i really enjoyed this, had a 12oz bottle by a bonfire very refreshing"
"Had on tap at taco Mac. Poured to a medium yellow color with decent carbonation and a medium off-white head that lasted well and left okay lacing. Light hoppy aroma and a flavor that followed suit, with some citrus and dough in both the nose and taste. This all led to a mildly thirst-quencing beer. Not great, but a decent summer beer."
"Sierra Nevada never disappoints though not their best by any means."
"Pours a small head that disapates quickly. Appearance is a clear straw color. Not much for aroma except for some light malt. The taste reminds me of a Witbier but more subtle. Nice light mouthfeel for a warm summer evening. A beer to be drunk in large quantities if you want something better than Bud."
"drinkability is great. this is a light and crisp lager that is refreshing, and does not fill up the stomach. cheers!"
"A light summer beer for hopheads!!! Had a couple of drafts with dinner. No real head to speak of. Light to moderate lacing and pours a fairly clear orange color. Smell gives a hint of hoppiness but nothing outstanding. Tastes like a good lager, done California style. Flavor is hoppy ( not as hoppy as SNPA but still a nice little bite). There is a spiciness (pepper?) here as well and just a hint of citrus. Mouthfeel is a hair thin, but that is probably right for a summer beer. The hops flavor takes care of the mouthfeel after the first one, coating the tongue with hoppy goodness. Drinkability is excellent!!! This is not a beer to slowly savor, it is a session beer best served in mass quantities (pitchers) on a hot day with good company. A nice beer."
"Nice, refreshing taste. Sweet malt grain is dominant, but finished with a slight hop bitterness. Crisp, sharp mouthfeel. Refreshing, very good summer brew."
"I like this beer and could session it for a good time. Very crisp and assertive. Perfect amount of taste bud enticing toungue tingling carbonation. Cereal grains are slightly sweet with a hint of caramel. Mid palate is full and creamy with a good amount of bittering hops. A grassy spicey finish rounds things out well with this lager."
"Pours a clear yellow color with a nice head at first that fades. Aroma is nice and malty with some fruitiness. Taste is malty, though it leaves a weird aftertaste that's somewhat reminiscent of lemon and spice. I also detect some sort of biscuity flavor in the middle. Light, smooth and refreshing. I like this."
"The taste is definately a summer ale blend: wheat, light malts, and a touch of hops. Some floral notes, too, but nothing really shines through. Feels crisp and very refreshing on the palate, smooth throughout. Light body and a light citrus aftertaste. I'd say this is a very friendly beer, a good introductory one as well. It's not one I'd seek out, but I couldn't say no to one on a hot summer day."
"Pours a clear straw yellow with a thick creamy head the dissapates moderately quickly. Nice crisp aroma of light malt and noble hops, however the aroma isn't as powerful as some of the better pilsners. Taste is similarly malty with a nice hop bite on the end that lingers on the palate. The mouthfell is nice and light with moderate carbonatoin that support the crisp bitterness from the hops. Truly a great summer beer, very refreshing, very drinkable. This beer doesn't inspire deep thought by any means which is why I think the overal score is a little low, but I think it accomplishes what is sets out to do in creating a great refreshing beer for those hot summer days."
"This is a very light, sessionable summer lager that isn't overly complex, but doesn't have to be. There is a pleasant balance of grassy hops and a grain malt profile. Summerfest is they type of beer you don't really need to over analyze, but rather just drink and enjoy."
"Good drinkability, but there are better examples of this style."
"Overall- It was a decent summer brew. It was lighter than many of the typical Craft Lagers, but a good alternative to the usual suspects from the macros. I'd drink it again, but it isn't something I'm going to seek out."
"D: A good summer quencher, a great example of an American lager."
"Pours a clear golden color with an average white head that dissipated fairly quick leaving no lacing. The smell is very faint, very light malt and hop. The taste has a light hop bitterness and a slightly dry malt presence. The feel is crisp and light, finishing a bit bitter. A very nice summer brew, different than a majority of the other summer brews as it seems to have more of a hop presence."
"A light yellow golden brew with a nice head and well laced. Smells crisp and bready with an apple highlight. An interesting blend of creaminess and more peppery tones. There is a wheat taste that becomes more evident as you go, and it is very smooth with a fine carbonation. Pretty drinkable stuff, should be a popular choice for those looking for a pleasant summer time refreshment. I would drink it again for sure even though this is not my favorite style."
"Appearance is a light golden with a crisp head that laces nicely. Aroma is crisp and clean with light malt. Taste is bready with simple malts and the hops that leave a cloying bitter aftertaste. mouthfeel is light - medium and the body is not too bad, but I wouldn't pay the price I paid again for it."
"Notes: A simple, sessionable lager. Nothing particularly special about it, but quite good for what it is."
"Color was a nice gold, the smell was not very impressive and the taste was not what i was expecting from Sierra Nevada. When i took the first smell and taste of Summerfest it reminded me more of my freshmen year and going to busch light kegs, easy to drink but not an impressive tase. The after taste that is left is a bit bitter for the flavor that the beer does have. Like i said not really what i was expecting coming from Sierra Nevada which i tend to enjoy most of their other beers."
"It's good beer. I would definitely have another and would not turn one down when offered."
"Pours clear gold with some blonde and light orange tones. Fat, foamy, white head with huge bubbles making their way to the surface; dies down quickly and leaves very light lacing. Aroma is light and grainy  sweet and sour malts dominate over a grassy base with distant floral hops accenting. Very pastoral. Mouthfeel is mildly fizzy and light-bodied. Flavor matches aroma but with stronger buttery and cookie dough malts. Grain notes blend perfectly into a restrained, smooth hop bitterness. Notes of honey, lemon, spice, and hard candy here and there. Light soapiness and nuttiness in the finish; aftertaste is mild and sour-bitter."
"D - Great. I could quaff the hell out of this stuff in the summer. I'll celebrate Summerfest (whatever the hell that is...maybe like Festivus) with this brew!"
"A decent summertime pils."
"I think I picked the perfect beer for the occasion; it was quite drinkable, but displayed some complexity. I didn't write down any notes on this beer, but I recall some distinctive toasted malt, some spicy hops and a fairly dry and bitter enough finish. Maybe even a touch of a mineral quality; bordering on tartness. The mouthfeel was a touch light, enhancing quaffability. A really great summertime beer."
"Drinkability is very smooth as well."
" Overall this was an exellent choice for the summer-time. Light and clean flavors true to the Pils style are represented in this offering."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, good representation of style, this is a beer that I wouldn’t buy in a six-pack unless my options were severely limited, but on-tap it’s worth drinking over many of the usual suspects (macros, Sam Adams, Guinness et. al.) that most places carry."
"Overall excellent. This is a great pils, one I will buy again, and one any fan of the style should check out."
"Nice clear gold with and decent white head. Leaves some lacing on the surface. Aroma is light malt sweetness and a touch of floral hops. Malty with some spicy floral hops with a nice light bitterness in the finish. Very crisp and clean taste. Mouthfeel is light to medium and nicely carbonated. Very drinkable and refreshing. Overall a very nice pils from Sierra Nevada and a great summer beer."
"Overall, this a great summer beer with a perfect bitter and sour bite. Kind of like a mix between a czech pilsner and a witbier. Very interesting and relaxing summer brew."
"Light in body, and sadly in flavor as well. Herbaceous grassy notes dominate throughout, with just a touch of malt sweetness for balance. Easy to drink, but ridiculously overpriced to have on a regular basis."
"D - Definitely a beer I could drink, especially for a cookout. It was nice and wet, but not a watered-down taste. I could drink 2 or 3 without any trouble, especially on a hot day."
"ill buy this one again.good sound choice."
"I think this beer will be most liked by those who like hoppy, light-bodied Czech. Pilseners (of which I am one). I believe it is a beer that tastes better as you drink it. It starts off lightly (almost like a macro) but finishes with a firm yet restrained hoppy finish. I did not notice any fruit or wheat aspects and its certainly not full-flavored like a Belgian or German wheat beer. I think its a good beer, great for drinking on the deck at a summer barbecue, but a tad overpriced (I'm glad I bought it on sale)."
"Drinkabilty is easy going."
"D: Overall this is the worst Sierra Nevada beer that I have had and was shocked, honestly at how low quality this is."
"On the bottle it just says its a 'traditional lager'. Here its categorized as a pils. I think its a combo of the two, and not necessarily in a good way. I expect better from SN."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied and very easy to drink. Not too bad for a hot day. Definitely something I could drink a lot of on a hot day. But, there are much better summer beers out there. Overall, it's a decent beer. Probably one of my least favorite Sierra Nevada offerings, but it's still okay."
"I bought this as a mix 6 of summer beers, not ever looking at the label to check the style. Appearance is a clean light yellow that is typical of american light beers. Very little head even with an aggresive pour. A bit of lemon and whole lot of wheat apparent in the nose. One sip and you can tell they nailed the pilsner style. Usually I am not a giant fan of pilsners but this is probably the best pilsner I can remember having. Mouthfeel is light with some carbonation and a dry finish."
"Feels light and a bit watery. The wheat leaves a slight dryness. Overall it is a very light and refreshing brew. It's got slightly more bitter malt than a regular wit (which may turn off some novices) but overall pretty nice."
"A very nice summer beer. Throw those wanna-be macros down the drain."
"D: I'll get this again if my friends want something light. It's appealing to me in a way that most pilseners aren't."
"I know that all my qualms are with the style of the beer and that's why I weighted my grades a little, to try and see this brew through someone else's eyes. I could probably drink a six pack of these and walk off whistling."
"Appearance is a coper color with two fingers of head that dissolves pretty slowly. Not bad appearance. Nose is a little spicy on top of more average lager scent (grain and some sweet malt). A touch of sour apple in there as well. Taste is okay. Lots of fairly smooth graininess. A little apple. Overall it's mainly your standard lager taste. This one's alright, although I liked the smell more than the taste. Definitely better ones out there by SN."
"pours a blonde lager color with a decent amount of carbonation, smells like water and corn, not much else, some slight hopiness tastes a bit better, more taste, has a slight spicy hopness to. average beer overall nothing that makes it stand out but still a tasty beer"
"Very good beer to have with pepper jack cheese"
"D - The perfect lawnmower / grilling beer."
"Beef Notes: Another good year for Sierra. I've been getting this every summer since I've known it existed and I don't see myself stopping any time soon."
"Luminescent blonde with a generous head and visible carbonation. Smell is typical lager, but with a metallic edge. This unfortunate aspect isn't as noticeable in the taste, oddly enough. Nice light malt with a noble hop finish. Mouthfeel does the job of a summery lager very nicely, and as a result the drinkability is superb."
"It is certainly not my favorite offering from Sierra Nevada, but I would have it again."
"Overall, not recommended. Tough going to this after having had a Reality Czeck."
"This bottle is from the 2007 batch. I've had this beer on tap in the past and I remember it being much better."
"The hops are the first thing to hit your tongue, and they hang around. This is great for a beer like this that is so light in your mouth, as it adds a complexity to this beer that (in my opinion) takes it from good to very good."
"Not being a fan of pilsners, I've tried to review this against the style, not against my taste preferences, so I've intentionally been a bit generous with my numbers. It's a fine example of the style, but I won't buy any more of it. Pilsner lovers should really love this."
"There's not too much I can say about this beer, but I definately prefer it straight from the bottle (its tighter and crisper this way than when poured into a glass or from a tap)... highly drinkable on a hot day."
"Overall a very good beer, one of my favorites from a great brewery."
"Pours out a light brass with the occasional bubble making its way through the body. Thin head settles quickly to a ring of foam. Leaves some spots of lace. Nose is a lot of saaz with some breadiness from the malts and a whiff of toasted grain. Flavor gets a start with the malts, bringing a honey sweetness and some faint fruitiness to my mouth. I get some pear and apple. The saaz hops then come in and tear it up with big spice, herbs, grass, and hay. Finishes dry with a solid bitterness some honey that stays on the palate. Mouthfeel is light but has substantial body and very lively carbonation. Very delicious and fresh domestic pilsner that's almost on the level with Prima Pils or Live Oak Pilz. Highly drinkable."
"Light mouthfeel,juicy,nice tangyness,slightly watery makes for great drinkability on a hot summer day. A very good summer beer would definately drink this one again. Would like to try the draft version if I could. Worth a try !"
"D - a good summer beer, at the beach, at the park, or in your own backyard, good tasting and highly drinkable."
"A 2007 offering served up on tap. Much better then last years offering. This poured a nice pale golden color with a nice white frothy head. Smell was pretty hoppy, especially compared to last year. Lots of citrus and pine hops were evedent in the flavor. Fine crisp clean finish with lots of carbonation. An awesome session beer or a barbecue beer, really very nice overall, and a wonderful addition to my summer beer lineup."
"While this beer will not blow you away, it is one of the easiest beers to drink that I have come across in a long time. I could session these at a barbeque- a hot summer night- or while watching a baseball game."
"Drinks very easy, but not as tasty as last years"
"note: this would be a great gateway beer for a macro-drinker"
"Light and refreshing. I could almost chain-drink these."
"Drinkability is very good, easy to drink but with lots of flavor. A perfect example of a pilsner."
"Nice pour yields a good white head atop a crystal clear golden beer. The aroma is a little grainy, a little grassy, not much to distinguish it but clean like a lager should be. The flavor is nice, starts with a gentle breadiness followed by a good burst of hop flavor (maybe a little cinnamon in tone) and a good clean bitterness. Finishes a tad soft. This is a good beer, not great or classic but well made and tasty."
"Note: Sorry Jason A. I just noticed that you wrote much the same thing about introducing macro-loving friends to this beer."
"Pours a brilliant pale golden in color, with a solid, tight off-white head. Excellent lacing. Nose is pungent noble hops and a dusting of pale malt; fairly convincing. Sharp hop bite is the first impression on the palate, with a light scrubbing carbonation on the tongue. Dry, biscuity, bready malt qualities are very ably balanced by the hops. Notes of golden pear and grape skin, and light honey are all punctuated by the hops, which themselves add a gentle floral touch to the aromatic qualities. Dry overall, but fairly juicy and creamy on the tongue, really goes a long way for such a light-bodied beer. Truly exceptional drinkability. For years this was the one Sierra Nevada seasonal I had trouble selling-through, and I always felt it a shame as it's so well-done, and is probably my favorite Sierra Nevada offering. Would that this could be my daily beer I'd be a very happy man indeed. I'd put it up there with Prima Pils as one of my favorites of the domestic craft renditions."
"Taste is pretty citrusy up front along with some spice in the form of clove i think and just a touch of sweetness and banana are present also. Lemon lingers on the palate afterwords Mouthfeel is medium bodied, pretty smooth and nicely carbonated. This is a nice easy drinker for the summer."
"Oh man, I remembered this just being a light lager, but I've since gotten into pilsners and this one impresses me. The aroma got me first, it's pretty spot-on with the imported pilsner's like Jever or Budvar - slightly sour with a bland grain element. The flavor is surprisingly strong with a burst of citris and grassy hop flavors. It tastes like American hops might be in there. There's a nice white head and lacing to complete the appearance, and like all good pilsners, its quite drinkable."
"This is your answer for a summer BBQ with people who have macro-lager pallates. To tell you the truth I could drink this all year long; it's hard to find an imported Pils that is as fresh tasting and flavorful as this."
"Poured a very clear straw amber color with quickly reducing head. This is a very crisp refreshing beer. First taste is malt and a bit of straw/ grass, nose is the same. The taste is very dry and after swallowing the beer the aftertaste becomes more complex, Seems to cover pney hops, then citrus hops and finally a nice hop bitterness. Refreshing, but oddly does not remind me of German pils much. A fine quaffable simple beer."
"All in all quite drinkable. Summerfest could be a year-round offering, so long as they change the name."
"Nothing sharp, nothing fancy, and utterly quaffable."
"First time tasting an american version of my favorite style, cant say I'm too impressed, especially because its Sierra Nevada. The appearance is a lil' bit paler than the czech beers, the smell is more malt than hops with very clean sierra water underneath it all.The taste is average, no real hop bit compared to say Pilsner Urquell, which is suprising because SN is ""micro"". The mouthfeel is pretty heavy for a pilsner, I'll give it that however and I could drink these all day. Whats funny is I quafed all these down on all cloudy days...but a damn good beach beer! Something to give to the BMC drinkers, see what they think. Not as good as the European examples, but still a good-average beer."
"Very disappointing effort from SN. Calling this a summer beer is no excuse for making something this flavorless."
"This is a good summer beer, and i enjoy drinking it, from what i recall from last summer its better on tap, but i enjoy it in a bottle just the same"
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle. The beer pours a light hazy gold. 1/4 inch head that faded quickly, with light spots of lace. The aroma is light hops and grain. The taste is light hops, a hint of malt thickness, and a slight grassy finish. Light mouthfeel and smooth finish. Overall, this is a very easy crisp pilsner. High drinkability. I'm looking forward to having a few of these on one of those hot Texas summer days."
"Highly recommended."
"D- A good beer for the upcoming warm weather."
"Notes: The best American made Czech Pils I've had to date."
"This one could easily be served to any American lager fan without any trouble. Not too complex, slightly sweet, and light of body. Good accompaniment to potluck-type dishes and fruit salad."
"Pours a golden yellow. Lots of carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Smell is very malty and sweet, not the usual Sierra Nevada hop smell I expected. Reminds me of their Pale Bock. Sweet taste with some bitterness initially, which leads to a very strong yeast-like bread taste, and then finishes bitter. Very carbonated, which is a good thing to me. Very clean and enjoyable, although not something I would buy frequently. The easiest drinking SN product I've had...just not my favorite."
"2006 bottle getting on the old side. Pours a golden color with little head and active carbonation. Smell is sweet malts, some fruit, and yeast. Taste is a nice grainy malty sweetness with some citrus and floral hops. Gets better around 45 degrees as bitterness dies down a little bit. Refreshing, crisp finish. Nice summer beer, very drinkable and sessionable."
"this summer offer presents a nice hazy yellow color, there was a foamy head that died right away, not much lacing. nice clean taste, not much inital flavor but finishes with a light hoppy floral taste, good summer beer for those hot days, not to carbonated good mix. i would drink again"
"Paid $.99 for 1 bottle at the Liquor Barn Hurstbourne"
"Not bad, but fairly non-descript."
"Drinkability is good. Plenty of flavor in this Pils. Its not my style, but could be a welcome treat to those that do like em."
"poured a slightly opaque straw yellow color with a head equal to your pour style and leaving fair lacing on the glass. spicy hop smell. taste slight bread, spice hop. mouthfeel medium, smooth, very well balanced. very easy beer to drink very enjoyable put it on your list."
"D- sessionable, good pilsner, a good alternative for the summer especially for macro drinkers. good brew but not my favorite"
"Overall a very drinkable beer if you aren't looking to challenge your tastebuds and just want some cool refreshment."
"D: A nice surprise, a refreshing ""lawnmower"" beer in the waning days of autumn. Sessionable with its low abv...good clean flavors. Pilsener is not my style of choice, but I'd get this one again."
"cereal , grass , slight hopps"
"Easily the best pils I think I have ever had. Thank you, Sierra Nevada. Now... if only I can wait another 9 months for when the 2007 batch comes out."
"The carbonation was appropriate and the overall drinkability was above average. Summary: good summer brew"
"Mouthfeel was coarse and raspy, just as I like in a Czech Pilsner. Medium bodied. I will return again, and again."
"For the style, probably a decent beer, but I really can't stand lagers or pilseners much at all. They are practically flavorless and very bland. If I was forced to drink from this style, though, this would be one of my choices."
"I like lagers and this is a well made one. Nice flavors and good drinking qualitites. Many west coast breweries don't make that many lagers, but the ones that do I appreciate the quality of the effort. I like how close it is to Pilsner Urquell."
"Believe it or not, this is the most I've enjoyed a Sierra Nevada Summerfest and if you come across a 2002, I recommend you buy it and try it. I'll keep an eye out for it myself...cheers."
"Overall: I'm not a pilsner expert, but I like this. The hops were a welcome treat. I guess I haven't had too many Czech Pilsners. This is also a VERY drinkable beer. The rest of this six pack could easily be gone soon, but I'll get into trouble if I do that. Nice effort from Sierra Nevada."
"12oz. bottle. Poured a clear straw yellow with a medium size white head. Aroma was hoppy and of the grass variety. Malt was AWOL, but a tiny bit showed up as the beer warmed. Flavor was mainly hops - citrus. Some malt contribution as sweetness in the middle. Aftertaste was a little unpleasant, but only started to show about 1/2 way through the beer. Body was light, with medium carbonation and slightly drying. A hoppy pilsener, refreshing and a good summer beer. Only complaint is the aftertaste, because of which I wouldn't drink this again."
"12oz bottle purchased from Charles Street liquors in Boston. Pours light straw with little head or carbonation. Hardly any aroma. First taste fills the mouth nicely, but unfortunately not the throat. Goes down too easily without enough flavour. Little aftertaste. Not much to enjoy or offend. This one will be offered to non-beer-geek guests."
"Drinkability--Pretty good, I could definitely have a few."
" Of course, it's a relatively light bodied beer and it has substantial carbonation It's as drinkable as can be and very thirst quenching but it is just missing ""something."""
"All in all a fair beer, not my favorite from Sierra Nevada. But as for it being a Pilsner not bad."
"In a craft beer world dominated by big hoppy ales, Pilsners sometimes don't get the respect that they deserve. It's nice to see Sierra Nevada give this style some props. One of my favorite hot Summer day beers."
"This is a solid lager that screams drinkability. It is smooth, crisp with enough body to distinguish itself from most lagers. The beer pours a light golden color with good carbonation, head and light lacing. Aroma is mainly grain with light hopped finsh. Taste is smooth and understated but not wimpy. This is a lager that packs some substantial beer taste. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both high and I wouldn't mind to session this beer anytime of year, but it is perfectly suited for the summer. Another nice job by Sierra Nevada."
"Drinkability: Summerfest isn't bad for a summer thirst quencher. Nothing really stands out, not all that hoppy for Pils, in fact its rather innocuous. Would be a good crossover beer for your BMC drinking buddies. Not bad, but there are better summer Pilsners out there. Worth a try but I'll stick with Troegs Sunshine Pils or Tuppers Hop Pocket Pils for my summer time Pilsners."
"A pretty decent lager, tastewise, not too heavy on the malts, and with a decent, but not overwhelming amount of hops. A tad astringent on the mouthfeel, but not enough to keep it from being quite drinkable. Not astonishing, but a solid, drinkable, uncomplicated lager. Worth a try."
"Overall it's a nice American-brewed pilsner that's commonly available (when in season). There's nothing spectacular here (it's hardly my favorite Sierra Nevada beer), but it's certainly worth trying."
"D: Approachable & quite quaffable, but it doesn't bring me back for more."
"Golden yellow crystal clear color. Big white foamy head that drops to a thin film. Smell of light floral hops and a crisp maltyness. Taste of sweet maltyness with just the faintest of a bitter finish. Very typical pilsner taste. The smooth crisp finish puts the final note on this nice summer brew. A really good summertime beer."
"Overall - A very good pilsener.. very drinkable. Definitely worth a try..."
"Very drinkable, I look forward drinking more or tasting it on tap somewhere."
"overall- refreshing and very easy to drink. great for the summer."
"12 ouncer, twist top, no freshness/dating info given. Pours light golden and clear, near white head and just a tad o' fine lacing left behind. Spicy nose of lemony, grassy hops. Crisp, flavorful lager, subtle notes of light lemon/lime/gin. Grassy and floral hops. Fine warm weather brew. Underated member of the SN line up"
"This is certainly a good beer. But I have always been a bit more partial to the ""Sierra Nevada Pilsner"" which is only available in select locations on draft. But... when it is a warm Northern California day, an ice cold Sierra Nevada Summerfest is certainly a good choice."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good and absolutely refreshing beer. The beer is balanced to not overwhelm your palate so that it remains drinkable. I wouldn't put it in the Czech Pils category, but I am not sure where it would fit better. It is definitely a Pilsner style beer, but the hops are out of place for that style too. Suffice it to say that this beer doesnt fit a category well, but it is undeniable a drinkable beer and one that I am sure that I will partake on again in the future."
"Flavor lingers on for a while but the mouthfeel is still leaning a bit towards the thinner side of things. Decent carbonation. Overall drinkable enough, its just a lighter beer than what most of us BAs usually shoot for. But regardless its good overall, could be one for the masses"
"SN's only attempt that I know of into pale lagerland is a bust. This thin watery gruel is going into the fish bowl. At least my goldfish will be happy. Very disappointed in SN. the question I have: why bother?"
"Smell is of citrus, grass and grain. Quite earthy and clean. This brew has a medium body with a slightly slippery presence on the palate. Very quenching and drinkable as a summer beer should be I suspect. Taste is very clean with a crisp hop flavor. This brew serves it's purpose well as a drinkable, summer time lager."
"Quite the nice pilsner here and a great summer seasonal. Crisp, clean, and refreshing."
"D: I think this is the first good american lager I've had! I'll make sure to have a few on hand the next time friends visit."
"Nothing special about this beer, but it isn't bad. I'd have it again. It's refreshing if nothing else."
"Drinkability: I really like this, though not for any summery quality - it's heavy for both a summer beer and a pilsner. But this is what I imagine a SN take on a summer beer would be, and it's a reminder of how much nicer a good craft brew can be. The bolder edges of this beer don't affect the overall flavor, though it lacks the sweeter grainier qualities of other pilsner."
"Pale gold body with a 1 finger white head. Smells like corn mostly. Not very pleasant. Corn, hops and grassiness is all I taste. But overall, the flavor is better than most standard lagers. Highly carbonated to the point where it interfered with my enjoyment. I don't like belching a lot. Slightly below average drinkability for me, again cuz I'm not a big fan of the style. But I can see other's digging this one, especially at a summer bbq with some chicken wings...mmm."
" This one is much more delicate, less lager more pils. a perfect balance with very subtle but highly effective flavor's that are much more gentle than i remember it being in 2006."
"D - It is drinkable, especially on a hot day. I'd say it is fairly typical of a Czech Pilsner. Good but not my favorite style of beer."
"Very drinkable, but not terribly interesting."
"Tastes hoppy floral with minimal dark tettnanger qualities. Nice honey sweetness could be malt or hallertauer hops. Lemony with a touch of gingerbread. Sweet and sticky while in the mouth. Biscuit (and maybe vienna) malt is late and the aftertaste is a touch tin-like...but mostly wiped clean by the strong carbonation. Mouthfeel is md-light and the beer leaves quickly due to the carbonation. Leaves a touch of sour and I get some heartburn by the bottom of the glass. Nicely done summer beer. Light and refreshing. Quite hoppy. I never would have purchased this one myself as I would have expected it to be a wheat beer. But it turned out to be a hop-bomb of a german-ish summer quencher. This is a beer that I recommend. Review scores are to style, not personal preferences."
"Drinkability/Notes - This is an easy drink, not a big beer but still a good beer. Interesting different choice for a summer seasonal when so many breweries go with wheat beers, saisons or big hops. Not fancy but a good clean beer."
"Pours pale gold with decent clarity. Two and a half finger rocky head that holds well and leaves sticky patterns of lace. Pilsner malt and prevelant saaz hop aromas. The pilsner malt is actually sweet upfront, with a crisp dry tone coming on in the aftertaste. Full palate of saaz flavor, and thankfully not overdone bitterness. Medium body with a medium level of carbonation; but in conjuction with the malt and drying hops, this finishes clean and soft. Highly drinkable with a excellent balance of flavor and great example of the style."
"Everything is well balanced, it is good tasting and easy to drink. A very nice summer brew - well carbonated, crisp, clean and refreshing. A good thirst quenching beer for the hot days."
"Pours a dark straw color with a light white head. It has an oak aged smell with some sweet tones, a bit of citrus in there. Taste is very similar with a light mouthfeel and a small almost scotch flavor with hints of honey and clove. This beer finishes smooth with a sweet aftertaste almost like raisins. It has a good balance, bitter beginning but a great end. It is a good summer beer that I could always enjoy on a summer day."
"Pours pale straw color, good carbonation, not a lot of head. Slight creaminess which gives a slight lacing. Nose is very floral, dry malts and hops noticeable, some light citrus notes, and smells refreshing. Taste follows well, again with some nice hoppiness, dry malts, and light lemoniness that is quite balanced and very enjoyable. Pretty good mouthfeel, could have had a bunch of extra ones."
"This is a very drinkable beer and an excellent one for a hot summer afternoon, such as this one. Its a light yet flavorful thirst quencher."
"yummy pils for the sun."
"Not much to this beer. Typical pilsner with not overwhelming qualities."
"Pours a golden straw color with a thin, bone-white head. Smells cool and floral, with a slight metallic twinge. Actually very flowery, the more I smell it. First sip is very crisp, dryly malty; floral hops make a huge appearance here, too, with a prominent bitterness. Body is rather thin, and the alcohol kind of shines through, surprisingly. The taste kind of reminds me of a so-so champagne, honestly - floral and bitey in that way. I'm not sure how ""Czech style"" this pilsner really is, and I probably won't seek it out when I'm in the mood for that kind of beer."
"Pours golden, with a nice white head. Good retention and lace.Aroma is of grassy hops, and bready malts. Body is light and carbionated. Taste is light refreshing.Malty up front,with a bit of hops in the finish. Bready notes as well. Nice version of this style."
"This is a nice change from SN. The yellow beer has a nice, hefty head. The nose is filled with grass and citrus. Taste is a full-bodied lager with lots of malts pushing through. Mouthfeel is great for a summer pale lager. Drinkability is good too. This makes for a nice summer session lager."
"This is an awesome lawnmower beer for the summer."
"Pours an enticing golden color with moderate carbonation. Thick sticky head subsides to a thin lace in a few minutes. Crisp smell of grain/hops. Mouthfeel is somewhat astringent - crisp malt feel with the hops making their presence known in the background. Quite a pleasant beer on a hot summer day. I plan on serving some of this to my macro drinking brother in law on 4th of July weekend to see what he thinks. Overall a refreshing brew and a bit of a different flavor than most lagers I've had."
"Overall, I will be drinking this steadily throughout the summer."
"Overall, a decent drink, but as seasonals go, it is unmemorable."
"Going to get this again most definately. Price is a little high but the quality makes up for it."
"Dits ok as far as the flavor goes, mildit would be a good yard work beerwhich I suppose makes it good for the summerwhich is what they were looking forsoyes, its drinkable."
"Comments: I found this an enjoyable American pils in the German/Czech style, but nothing out of the ordinary. Good when looking for something light & easy drinking while staying with the domestic craft brewers."
"Drinkability - This goes down easy, especially on a hot day, and is good. Very sessionable."
"M&D: Very smooth, refreshing taste. Perfect for a hot summer day, too bad I drank it on a cool summer evening! I only bought a single of this brew to try, but I would love another one."
"Summerfest 2006 by Sierra Nevada pours a golden yellow with a thick fluffy head that leaves a nice lace as it settles from a brown twelve ounce twist off bottle. Aroma is nice, on the hoppy side with hints of malt. Nice balance of malt at the beginning and end with a hop bite in the middle. Pretty nice beer for a lager. Huge improvement over the big three. I may just down a few this summer."
"Once poured into a glass a nice white head forms on top of a golden straw pale yellow brew. The head remains briefly but has some nice lacing. The nose has a very slight hint of malt underneath a strong Saazy hop aroma. And I detect something that twinges a bit like parmesan cheese or feet, which might be the hops. It has a good earthy and grassy taste I usually taste in this style of beer. Very clean and very crisp. The carbonation in this bottle is a bit low for me, I think if it had more it would be a little more refreshing. Overall it's a pretty good beer. It is Sierra Nevada so it's definitly worth trying. Finishing the 6er I bought probably won't be a problem."
"A light and refreshing lager that's not too heavy, it's a good one for hot summer days."
"Its decent, nothing incredible to speak of, no hidden undertones or flashy flavors but thats ok sometimes. A good beer to hang out with. I could bring it to a barbeque and not be embarrassed."
"Good refreshing summer beer for those into Pils."
"Anyone turned off by this style's rape and ruin by the big big brewers ought to reacquaint themselves with the style via this very nice offering."
"Another good beer from the folks at Sierra Nevada."
"In the mouth this beer flaunts its light-medium mouthfeel. Tiny and delicate carbonation dances on the tongue as it sits in the mouth, the level of carbonation is low, as to not interfere with the taste of the beer, just a spritz on the tongue. Better than average mouthfeel, but nothing outstanding. Each time I pulled one of these bottles out of the six pack I have thoroughly enjoyed it. This is a beer that I will definitely buy again. I can't say that this is my Pilsner, because I haven't had that many, I will definitely try some more before I come back to this one. It's too bad that it is only available during the summer, but then again its realease is something to look forward to."
"A tossable, refreshing summertime outdoors kinda picnic beer. Very drinkable. Perhaps give a try to your swill drinking friends?"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Supple and well balanced in the mouth... a very solid, drinkable beer on its own or with food. A welcome guest to this year's cooler."
"Pours a crystal-clear pale gold, with swirling, effervescent bubbles and a fine, frothy white head. Pleasant flowery, citrusy aroma. Light malt flavor, slightly biscuity, with a good level of hoppy bitterness and nice grassy hop flavor. Clean, dry finish. Light bodied, easy drinking beer."
"Looks like it should- golden, clear, decent head. Minimal lacing. Smell is faintly hoppy and floral. Nothing superbly special. Taste reminds me a lot of Becks- pilsnery, German, grassy and hoppy. Nothing too strong or overwhelming. Becks, definitely. Mouthfeel is slightly sudsy and very very light. Overall quite drinkable, crisp and refreshing, light. Sierra + Becks."
"This years 2006 has a light white head on the pour. Tangy honey and young dandelion green taste that pops quick in the mouth and fades into a mild hop. Sweet yet bitter, this pils makes me want to reach for a brat and top it off with some good ol' fashioned home made kraut and strong mustard all on a rye bun, with pickles of course."
"I think this is a pretty drinkable beer. This beer would be a great stepping stone for macro drinkers who want to broaden their horizons."
"Nicely carbonated, medium bodied  very crisp and tart. A very good example of what US brewers can do with the pilsner style when they try. This would drink easily in the STL summer heat."
"Very refreshing beer. Light on the palate, clean finish, no bad aftertaste. This could easily be used as a crossover beer. It had a solid malty backbone, but still had an ever so slight tinge of the hops. I could seriously sip a few of these after a hard days work outside, which is something I'll be doing plenty of this summer."
"As usual, Sierra Nevada continues to impress with solid beers sold at fair prices. This beer may never crack your top 100 list, but it's hugely drinkable and quite refreshing. Beers like this make the South Carolina summer a little more bearable. In the words of our immortal president, I declare to Sierra Nevada: ""Mission accomplished!"""
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this lager for what it was, a nice summer seasonal. Good for a hot summer day although it may become too bold after just a couple of beers. I would probably have this one again but would not go out of my way to hunt for it. Just a nice average summer lager."
"D - Nothing special here. I could drink again, I'd rather not though. It is basically an above above macro lager mixed with a pils. Not my thing."
"Pours up like a pils, nice and gold with a totally white head that rises and falls quickly. The smell is relatively attractive. A nice sweet tone that inturrupts the grains in the back and a bit of herbal hoppiness. The taste is lacking very sweet and grainy up front, slgihtly bitter and grassy in the finish. The mouthfeel is largely watery and unimpressive. A quite drinkable beer but not for me."
"2005 vintage, btw"
"Pours a pale orange lager hue with a nice rocky head, too bad it doesn't last. Some light lacing along the way, but the color tone works. Smell is biting floral hops and breadiness with some malt sweetness, spot on for the style. Taste is about the same, but with a nice tea and honey aftertaste that sits on the tongue. Subtlety works. Biting hops in the start balance with the mild carbonation in the finish. Can be a little thick at times, but I could easily take down a 6 and be ready for more."
"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow with a few fingers of white foam that melt to a light skim.and spotty lacing. Nose is a bit off-puttingly musty/skunky/adjuncty with a hint of light fruit in the background. Taste starts of with the musty malt husk, a hint of skunk and spicy ""fruit"" bringing up the rear. Mouthgfeel is crisp and smooth, with a summer-like drinkability one might say. Nothing special here, a slightly above average micro/macro lager."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a thin white effervescent cap. Cap gone in a few seconds. Aroma is lite with light sweet malt, floral, and hint of lemon. Light grain and yeast in nose. Flavor is sweet grain, lime, mild hops, and yeast. Body is light, with very crisp carbonation. I could drink a six pack of these in a sitting. Not very complex, but very refreshing and tasty for the style. Good Job!"
"A fantastic summer beer, very refreshing and light will definately drink again."
"D- this is an excellent summer beer. Very clean and very refreshing. An easy drinker on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability & Notes: I feel as if this is a beer that I could drink a bunch of on a nice lazy day in the summer. However, its not one that I would jump to for its taste. Certainly no where near Sierra Nevada's other masterpieces."
"What a nice, refreshing beer. I don't remember it being this tasty and pleasing. I think it serves it's purpose nicely. Very easy to drink. I would also consider this a ""cross over"" beer for some people."
"Pours a light straw color. Crystal clear and bubbly producing a half inch head that sticks around well, though tracing is somewhat poor. Aromas of hay, citrus, wheat, and that trademark lager yeast smell. Light bodied, and flavors are citrusy, a mild hop bitterness followed by a little biscuity finish. This is a supremely drinkable lager, one I've really enjoyed. Very refreshing, clean and smooth though with a noticeable bitterness and a good malty background. Would go well with any lighter or greasy summer fair and perfect for a picnic or beach. I'd purchase again but the $8 price tag is rather steep for a SN seasonal."
" I know everyone loves Sierra Nevada but I think this is sub par at best. I won't look for this one again, especially not for nine bones plus tax and deposit for a sixer. There are many better summer beers for my cash."
"Clear shiny gold, with not a whole lot of head retention after an initially foamy pour. Has that semi-skunked lager aroma, with a good mix of light graininess and hops. Very crisp and refreshing. Clean thru the middle, ending with minimal hop spiciness. Makes a great hot weather alternative to the ever present wheat beers. Nothing earth-shattering here, just another great brew in Sierra Nevada's already stellar lineup."
"This beer pours a highly transparent golden color with very visible carbonation rising to the head. It smells and tastes a little bad-beery. However, the taste cleans up, and a nice, although subtle, hop bit rolls over the back of the toungue. Overall, this is a pretty decent and simple beer. It is pretty good for the style, but I would grab a Harpoon Summer before I grabbed this one."
"Pours a transparent golden color with a small head and no lacing. Smells like a lager. Grainy tones dominate with a small hoppy and roated aroma. Tastes pretty damn good. Roasted malts and a better than average hop bit. Mouthfeel is a bit thing and watery. Nothing to write home about in that department. Drinkability, however is good. Very easy drinker and a good warm weather brew."
"Certainly a good warm weather beer or a good session beer. This is a craft brew you can give to the uninitiated without them balking."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer was medium bodied. There was plenty of carbonation to go around. This was a very satisfying and highly quaffable beer treat."
"Taste was very crisp with a smack of hoppy bitterness and dryness on the first taste. Very citrusy with a smoothing malt flavor in there. A slight sweetnees helps take the edge off the initial bitterness. Slightly dry finish and lots of carbonation gives it quite a bit of body in the mouth. A very busy lager."
"Bottom line: This is first time I've seen this beer in Casper and I think it'll make an excellant thirst quencher on a hot summer day. I recommend it."
"M/D- A couple summers ago a friend brought a six pack of this over my house...I really did not know much about beer then, and this is the first time that I have had it since. This lager has wonderful flavor...the hops are not too overwhelming, and I think that a macro drinker would probably be able to get into this beer....mostly because of its overall smoothness. It kinda coats the tongue as it goes down, and that is not a bad thing. Once again I am impressed with SN, but surprised that I cannot detect those cascade hops...they don't appear to be present. This will provide some good drinking this weekend in the hot SC heat."
"The nose shows lots of sweet grain, a light hoppiness, and some grassiness. The flavor is crisp, clean, and dry with a refreshing hop kick in the finish. Very refreshing and an excellent brew to enjoy in the season for which it is named (as the thermometer climbs to the 90 mark here in sunny Florida...)."
"I'll try it again when it's 30 degrees warmer."
"Mouth feel is light in body with ample carbonation."
"Notes: Def a step up from the mass produced pils/euro plaes such as Labatt's or Heineken. I'm not really a fan of the style but this goes down easy. I drank it a little warmer than optimal temp for this style because my beer fridge is kept as cellar/cool temp and lagers generally go better on a summer day served colder."
"I rarely have more than 2 beers in any 24-hour period but if for some reason I decide to drink beer all day and night I will consider this one as the brew of choice."
"This pours a clear golden yellow with a large white foamy head. The smell has a grassy,floral,and malt sweetness to it. It's not too strong,but it's nice for a summer beer. The taste has some hop bitterness to it with floral and malt sweetness. This is a refreshing and tasty brew with a light m/f and a good mixture of flavors. This could an everyday beer in the summer."
"Looks like a nice golden lager with decent carbonation and a thick white head; I poured this into a pilsner glass. The aroma is nothing to write home about, there is some malt and a little floral aroma (very faint). The taste is a crisp body that has a slight bit of malty sweetness in the finish. The body is balanced well and quite enjoyable. A good lager that reminds me a German brew."
"Musings: Keep it around for the dog days. The taste is all about spices and lemons and will keep your thirst in check."
"Fest pours a crystal clear gold with a foamy white head. Dissipation is immediate and nearly complete. Clean and crisp hops and lager aromas with a touch of lemon. Primary component of MF and taste is the snapping turtle hop bite. Pretty darn drinkable."
"D - Easy to get one down pretty quick, but I didn't want another. Some people will love this beer, some not so much. It is important to remeber that this coming from the brewer of SNPA and Bigfoot is that this is a lager and to judge it as such."
"D - moderate, easily downed, another great SN brew"
"Cheers!"
"This is what the macro breweries could do if they added flavor to their beers. Great beer to introduce your macro loving friends to craft beer. Also would be a good pool beer and maybe a bbq beer. Still not warm enough to fully enjoy in NC. This is a decent beer that serves it's purpose."
"This beer is typical for the style. Yellow, fizzy and generally bland. but when reveiwed within the style it is a little above the norm. The taste is little smoother than is typical. It doesn't seem to have the harshness that is so typical. This would be a very easy drinking brew for those hot summer days. I would take one of these over mass produced beer any day."
"cheers"
"One of my local good brew dealers had 3 sixers of this stuff sitting in their cooler for months, so I decided to give it a shot. 2005 Summerfest. Pours a pale yellow goldish color, similar to a lot of macros but damn I wish macros would taste like this. Sweet smell gives way to a real nice taste of sweet malt, hops, citrusy flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but you can sit there and drink this all day. I like it a lot. The store has 2 more sixers in the cooler, I think I'll pick 'em up later on!!"
"Poured a semi-cloudy, yellow color with a soft head that dissipated quickly and left behind no lacing. Aromas of hops, grains, and yeast. The taste was a very mild with only a bit of hop bitterness and even less sweet malt. The carbonation added some texture, but otherwise there really was nothing special about this beer. Hardly any flavors came out and not much going on in the aftertaste. Overall, this was a below-average beer lacking flavor and texture."
"05 edition Pours a clear yellow color, some carbonation, small head, nice lacing afterwards. Scents of malt, lemon grassy, and kinda sweet. Very nice taste of .light malty and sweet. Light body. Very drinkable lager from SN. Another very nice brew from SN."
"Mouthfeel is thin and soft, not real complex but very quaffable. I could definitely session this one, especially in the heat of summer."
"This should be very nice on a hot summer day to accompany mowing the grass or barbecue."
"I don't usually like Sierra Nevada brews, but this was certainly an exception. Nice flavor, not too strong or too weak. A bit of carbonation and definite drinkability. Can polish off a sixpack in an evening and still feel up for more the next day."
"Bottle: Poured a clear golden color lager with a medium creamy white head with great retention. Aroma of medium sweet floral malt is quite enjoyable. Taste is very refreshing with a nice dose of sweet malt with some crisp floral hops. Body is a bit too thin to make this truly special but still very enjoyable."
"Think of this a Sierra Pale Ale's slightly ugly cousin, It's Sierra in lager form, but that just doesn't work out."
"A beer with little strength or depth. Its not at all bad, and I wouldnt avoid it, but I dont think Id go out of my way to buy it."
"Refreshing to the palate and pleasing to the eye, Sierra Nevada Summerfest 2005 is holding up the tradition of good beer coming this way from Sierra Nevada."
"Clear straw color with a fine white head. Mild grainy aroma with grassy hops. Smooth, good lager mouthfeel, with a lively, creamy malt nose. Some grassy hops clean up the finish, which is fresh and crisp, with a nice pale malt aftertaste. Highly quaffable, with very nice flavors. An all around good summer lager."
"This beer poured a nice pale yellow color with a finger of white head. It smelled very good, a nice sweet flowery hops smell. It tasted a bit sweet, with some bitterness from the hops. This beer has a lot of flavor, it seems to light up all my taste buds at once, in a good way. Nice and crisp mouthfeel, very enjoyable. This is a pretty drinkable beer, I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like hops though."
"Not sure how to score this one. For cold, go half a point lower, for cool, half a point higher."
"Upon its release from the bottle it entered the glass a s a clear golden beverage with an abundant white head that left nice lingering bits on the side of the glass as it fell. Aroma is slightly sweet with a bit of malt detected. Flavor is malty with some lemon detected and has a nice dryness as the flavor matures in the mouth. Finished very light and refreshing with the dryness lingering. A very nice drinking beer. Wasn't exactly what I was expecting but very enjoyable."
"Light golden body with a decent white head of short duration. A ring of suds nearly encompasses the entire rim of the glass as ample carbonation continues to feed it. Random incidents of lace break out from time to time. The nose delivers a light hop plume on top of malt breadiness. Smells refreshing and crisp. The taste is light and smooth with a fairly hefty degree of bitterness in the finish. Quite dry, but a slight sourness balances things out in the end to keep this feeling a bit more summer like and satisfying. Easy to drink and enjoyable to boot. Laga!"
"Bright clear golden hue is covered by an unfortunately very evanescent white head. Floral saaz nose with plenty of toasted malt flavors. If you thought that was enough, have a sip because they come with a vengeance, even bigger, toastier, loafy than before. Floral/minty fresh hops build up a fine aftertaste. Delicate and refreshing. Crisp bodied. Very satisfying."
"It seems to me that Sierra Nevada Summerfest would also be a great ""conversion"" beer, meaning that I would highly recommend it if you are trying to get a friend or loved one (who normally drinks macro filth) into craft beer."
"I was very let down by this on tap. I liked it much better out of the bottle. It smelled summery, for sure, with a bit of citrus and spice with a little wheat. The head was decent and a straw color in it. The hops were there but just a bit too bitter. The bite in my mouth made it not too enjoyable and I was ready for something else when I was done. A letdown for a Sierra Nevada brew."
"A good beer for the summer, would be great after a long hot day working in the yard."
"A freshly tapped pint sits in front of me, capped by a medium sized white head over clear yellowy liquid. A good dose of sharp grassy hops dominates the nose with some sweet malt backing. Very lively on the palate with crisp carbonation/mouthfeel. Flavors of faintly sweet and doughy malt gives way to the ample hopping here...goes down easy. Finishes clean and crisp, a nice session lager, I enjoyed this much more than the bottled version I tried some years back."
"This better than average beer poured a golden color with a little bit of head retention. Nose was grassy and grainy. Taste is biscuity with a very slight hop finish. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full and decently carbonated. Overall drinkability is good. This is a nice session beer after golfing in 110 degree weather!"
"The 2005 Summerfest: Pours a wedding-ring gold. Light white head dies down fast. Sweet nose, tempered with a healthy dose of American hops. I am always pleased when American brewerys make a good larger. Sometimes I feel like we are to focused on ales in the US (even though I do prefer the top fermenters to the bottom fermenters). On a warm summers day, or at the base ball game, a nice cool, well balanced larger hits the spot. The sweet malt (I presume two-row) is tasty and the crips hop makes me thursty for another."
"12 oz. bottle with no freshness date - served chilled in a pilsner glass. It pours a nice golden hue with a half inch off-white head that never goes away and leaves spots of lace. There's lots of streams of carbonation rising quickly through the body. It has a nice toasty malt aroma with a hop background. There is a nice hoppiness on the palate from floral/spicy (Saaz?) hops along with toasty malts and a bit of caramel. The body is light and kinda dry but it is quite refreshing. I wish more lagers tasted like this."
"D- This is a beer with a lot of character for this style. Nice complexity yet very good for quafting in the heat of the summer. The carbonation is strong but it doesn't really work with the slippery mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: A very different idea for a summer beer; light and lemony"
"Crisp mouthfeel is fairly light and refreshing with stable carbonation. This one is an easy drinker that would go down like water at a backyard barbecue. Worth seeking out if you're looking for an easy drinking, tasty lager."
"This is the summer beer to end all summer beers. Bottom fermented, consumed on a wonderfully beautiful Cape Cod afternoon. This beer seems to be a bit more edgy than other summer, has the lemon zest but is also a little bitter, with a Pils undertone. This is an amazing example of this style."
"Drinkability: Refreshing but not very interesting. Nothing is really all that special here, which was a big disappointment coming from Sierra Nevada. Not bad, but not worth seeking out."
"Another average, boring, but decent tasting summer lager. This is one of those beers that make you understand how only (for the most part) big beers get the really high ratings. There is not too much to be excited about in this beer. Pours out a golden, cider, straw yellow color with a sticky head that clings randomly to the glass. The aroma is heavy with earthy, hay-like, maltiness. The taste and mouthfeel is very doughy with a hop finish. The beer is pretty smooth, but maybe a bit too dry for this style. Again, there is nothing wrong with this beer, I just need more excitement from a seasonal brew. I will stick to the summer wits."
" VH"
"Gold color filled my glass. Nice white frothy head that dissipates into lacing. Good hop presence, grain, grass taste. Dry bitter finish. Soft carbonation, medium body. I wish I would of bought more than one. Easy drinking without sacrificing flavor."
"I choked this one down, but it got difficult toward the end and I don't want another. I don't think the beer was old or gone bad in anyway, but it kind of tastes like a skunked beer or a bad adjuncty macro in a lot of ways. If you are into lagers or kolsches, you might like it."
"This was a nice suprise from the gang at Sierra Nevada. Poured out to a medium golden color, with nice carbonation. Lace was noted around the glass, with a white foamy head that had good staying power. Odors of hops and barley were noted. Taste was pretty good, with flavors of hops grain and malt. Quite refreshing. Not too heavy, this could be a nice session beer. Recommended for lager lovers."
"Overall: A fairly bland offering from a brewer I expect more from. Worth a try but I personally will not be back."
"A very drinkable lager, made for hot days"
"This poured a clear medium golden, white foam head, that left broken lace all the way through, taste was nice, rather bold hops, up front, then mellows, to a bit of a sweet aftertaste, citrusy notes, fruit and hop nose, bit of apple, and lemon. mouthfeel was a little chewy, but fairly rich and full, drinkability is very good, nice summer brew!"
"overall: i served this refrigerator cold, but liked it much more by the end. this is a lager, right? this does aid in the summer drinkability, however. not terrible, but not the best either."
"Nice mouthfeel, and on a hot day, I think I could enjoy this one as a decent yard beer substitute."
"The mouthfeel was light to medium, and carbonation was high. Was intendend to be a volume beer, and although drinkable, the last time I ever try this one on-tap."
"Pours a medium golden with minimal head, good retention, minimal carbonation (which is good). Aroma is light cirtus hop with a bit of gristy maltiness. For a brief moment, you have a light body crisp mouthfeel but almost immediately the fuller citrus hop flavor and body comes through, not like its big brother SNPA, but in a similar slightly more sublte way. This is a tough beer. There are not a lot of flavors that jump out at you but rather begin to blend to form a very well balanced fuller bodied beer. It's a APA lover's summer brew. The taste is very good but not exceptional. I toyed with giving it a 5 in drinkability. If it finished a bit cleaner, I would."
"Nice gold color with a fluffy white head that dies down while drinking and had lacing down the glass. Fragrant hoppy aroma, crisp balanced flavor with adequate hoppiness in the back. Very refreshing. As the name implies it is an ideal beer for the summer heat especially here in the Southeast. Another winner from Sierra Nevada!"
"I consider this an above average summer seasonal and would recommend this to friends and will drink this again."
"Mouthfeel is nice and crisp and clean. Good carbonation keeps this drinking easy. Drinkability is nice as well. This is a nice summer session lager. Good for sitting on the porch and shooting the breeze while grilling."
"Drinkability: Very high, which is important for a summer seasonal beer IMO. This must be lighter, easy-to-drink, and refreshing. In this, this beer succeeds, and it has flavor! I'd recommend this on a hot summer's day."
"This might be a ""Good in the right time and moment beer."" Pours very pale with a fuzzy head on top. Nose is all bu non-existent. Flavor is more of the same. Malts are there at first, but vanaish quickly and are replaced with a slight hop bite. But not much a mutuality between the two in this beer. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. Also, very drinkable because there is not much ""Bam"" to the taste buds. Just smooth drinking."
"Light-bodied, packed with carbonation that stings the tongue. Super refreshing, highly drinkable, summertime stuff."
"Drinkability is rarely matched."
"A good beer of a benal style by a great brewery. Looks medium straw in color with a stark white head that falls to a trace, but laces nicely. Smells of faint vegetables, mild sourness, yeasty, bready, and earthy. Light hops on the nose. Tastes like corn, cereal grains, hops for bittering, bread, wheat, and yeasty. Slight souring on the side of lemons. Body is better than most lagers, adds creaminess, and better coats the mouth. Finishes clean and powdery. Leaving subtle bittering. If you want a Euro Lager, then this is a good rendition. But if you want a good Sierra Nevada brew, then get any other of their beers."
"This is easily the worst of the SN line, but it's still not half bad. I can't tell you to avoid it but can't really recommend it either, as there are a plethora of better summer brews out there. At best, it's a decent fallback option if available and the pickings are slim."
"This poured with a decent white head, but it just evaporated to wispiness. I had a light malt smell, but even that was tough to discern. It had a nice tang in the mouth, but no taste that really jumped out. The finish was lightly grainy, not so much of malt, but more like wheat, or (heaven forbid) corn. It just reminded me of being out in the fields behind my maternal grandparents' house as a kid. It was a decent beer, but I'd like something with a bit more flavor, even in the summer."
"Went down clean and hit the spot in the heat, but not something I would buy again."
"Creamy, big head, wheat and alcohol aroma. Light colour, no lace, drying aftertaste.More bitter than malty, undetstated carbonation. Some hops. Needed it after summer day thirst, but only marginally satisfying. Medium-light mouthfeel. Very average beer overall."
"A decent thirst quencher but not a staple brew... Preferred the hoppier bottled version."
"Pours a very transparent golden yellow color with a little bit of airy white fizz, but not much. Smells delicious. Aromas of sweet sweet malts cover hints of floral hops. The taste is slightly tart at first as I expected, but finishes clean. Great job on finishing smooth and clean. Floral hop flavors are noticeable throughout the taste. The mouthfeel is slick and smooth and has a nice full feel to it. This texture demands respect. I'm sure I could drink a few of these, but all I bought was a single."
"Sierra Nevada can do no wrong. This is as perfect an example of a Euro Pilsner as I can imagine."
"Pours a clear golden with a persistent 1/2 inch white head. There is a steady trail of bubbles tracing up the glass. Aroma is a mix of bready malts and spicy noble hops with a touch of citrus. Flavor begins with slightly sweet biscuit, then becomes spicy with a healthy dose of hops. Finishes with a refreshing bitterness. All of the flavors are in excellent balance. Mouthfeel is crisp and light, with appropriate carbonation for the style. This is a very tasty pils/light lager, and a wonderfully refreshing summer beer."
"Pours a pale golden yellow with a thin fizzy white head. Nose is malty and almost breadlike. Taste is very smooth and malty, rich honeylike flavor and a sharp hop finish, very nice. Full-bodied and properly carbonated, this feels good in your mouth. I'm pretty impressed with this lager. Another good offering from Sierra Nevada."
"Overall a refreshing and solid lager that leans a bit to the sweeter side but has enough dryness to keep a nice balance. Flavors are somewhat attenuated but are still evident. A good (not great) lager."
"Entry is silky with just the right touch of carbonation. Midtaste features malt on the front side and a honey-like smoothness leading headlong into the finish...a crisp hop-snap accompanied by a long malt fade."
"Clear golden 12. oz pour, 1 hand Tall white foamy head filling the 0.5L. + pils glass to the top and providing persistant lacing for the duration of the glass. Wonderful Hallertauer hop aroma and a taste lightly malty, fruity, understated bitter hops and hinted of a sourish saison. Mouthfeel aided by good carbonation ( saw beading until the end). Refreashing bitterness. Hopping alone makes it a must try lager."
"Very satisfying and drinkable beer. A good Pilsner when you can't find a Pilsner."
"The best compliment I can pay this beer is that immediately after bringing these home from the store, I popped one open and drank it down, cooling off from the hot weather outside. Then I had a second one, even though it was only three or four o'clock in the afternoon. Good, but not great."
"A clean light yellow beer. Has a small bright white head. Which dissapears quite quickly. There is a light grainy biscuty aroma with a hint of skunk in the background. The bitterness starts off the flavor sharply. Then the grainy biscut character takes over at the end."
"Let's call it Grolsch/Heineken/Stella/Carling with a soul, and fresh, unskunked ingredients. Maybe they should put this one in green bottles for the fuck of it."
"I'm not a lager man, but I really enjoyed this brew. It has a rich, fruity start which reminds me of grapes, but with less of an acidic twang. This is followed up with a reassuring rather than potent hop backing. Couple this delightful taste with a little creaminess and good carbonation and you have a very drinkable number."
"It was off to a good start with it's appearance and aroma, but didn't quite hold up. Oh well."
"Drinkability- Wish I had this brew first so I could make a more accurate judgement. The one thing I will give it is refreshing. It was nice and hot outside by the pool and it did the job."
"Really a very simple beer. Crisp, grainy but clean and quite tasty. The big bitterness and mild hop taste remind me a lot of a mexican lager mixed with SNPA. A nice refreshing summer brew, but from my memory not nearly as good as years past."
"-Oelergud"
"Still a nice pils. Considered lowering everything to a 4.0, but resisted."
"Without the strong carbonation this would have been a common sight in my fridge, but as it is Sieraa Nevada Summerfest will only make occassional appearences."
"Crystal clear bright gold in color. Fluffy white head settles in nicely and remains for the bulk of the beer. Light citrus in the nose and also some floral hops. Taste is excellent. Hops are bold and spicy, malt is full yet smooth. This is a great summer beer with hints of citrus (lemon and grapefruit). Excellent, I will definitely enjoy more of these this summer."
"The color is a healthy shade of yellow and the head is average-sized. Carbonation is very good. The aroma is fairly clean with just a mild spicy hop smell. The taste is strongly (for a lager) of spicy hops with a tasty light malt body. A light citrus bite is also noted. This is very different and much more interesting than expected. Mouthfeel is appropriately crisp and drinkability is great. This is a choice summer seasonal beer, light enough to quench thirst, but still very flavorful."
"Pours a clear, golden yellow color with a frothy white head that leaves nice lacing. Smell is pale malts and a graininess with a hint of spices. Taste is a grainy malt flavor with a hint of fruity esters, and a clean dry finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth and drinkability is high."
"Pours a nice golden color with a decent head and very good lacing. Smell s of a rich malt with just a faint hint of hops. Full bodied as ""summer"" beers go. A rich malt flavor with and nice hop bitternes and flavor - not IPA or even APA hoppines but it is very detectable. Smooth and crisp. High carbonation. A nice summer beer. Not a lawnmower beer, but a sitting on the porch type."
"Bright golden clear beer, with a foamy head that left a little lace on the glass. Mild nose with just a hint of floral hops. Bitterness is barely present in the taste. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, my basic complaint is that this beers simply isn't crispy enough. I want a little dryness in the finish. This finishes...wet. An easy drinker, a nice alternative, but there are better selections."
"Drinkability: This would be a beer I'd bring to a grill out for someone who'd usually be drinking light swill; if it were ice cold I couldn't find many people who aren't even remotely adventurous drinkers finding a difference (though this may be a bad thing I suppose and I should probably give them some other better craft beers to try possibly). That's not saying it's a bad beer, it's just not one of SN's best by any stretch."
"The taste is also very similar to a wine, yet it has that cold and crisp carbonated mouthfeel I'd expect from a lager. Only a tiny taste of the hops, and the malts don't seem to be too ""malty"" tasting either, yet it is a good refreshing drink. I would rate this much higher on the drinkability scale, but after one or two the tartness begins to overwhelm my palate."
"Medium mouthfeel that goes down easy. Pairs well with grilled meats. This one did a good job of washing down braised short ribs and bbq pork tenderloin this evening."
"This is definitly a pilsner-style lager: pours very light and has a nice refreshing aroma with a hint of hoppiness. If I tasted this blind, I would say it tastes like Pilsner Urquell, one of the best lagers out there. I want to taste the two side-by-side because the similarities are many. Summerfest has a fresher, cleaner taste however, probably because it IS fresher than the imported PU. I thought this was a great brew. Lagers are never really high on my list because they are all so similar, but given the choice I'd take this anyday over most other lagers."
"Pours out a nice golden. not much head in this one, but good lacing. this one is, like other sierra navadas, bitter and hoppy. The mouthfeel is good, nice carbonation, maybe a little oily. Its a decent beer, and tastes like it would be nice on a hot summer day, but its not great. honestly if you miss this one, you wont be missing much."
"Its good for a summer day but not one I would buy again."
"Pours clear, straw-colored with very little head. Smells surprisingly malty, but clean. Taste is crisp, carbonated and a bit astringent at first, giving way to a fair amount of hops. I'm not a huge lager fan, but even so I would have expected a little more out of Sierra Nevada, which I'm a big fan of in general. If you like hoppy lagers or pilsners, this one might be worth a try. This wouldn't be a bad barbecue beer and would pair well with some grilled chicken and veggies."
"Gold orange pour with a medium sized white head. Hoppy scent that you'd expect from these guys with a little bit of gruit and grass. Flavor is okay, but nothing to write home about. It's got a light hop profile, and the malt comes to the surface with some real sweetness and a little bit of a crisp finish. This one's okay, but I thought it was a bit overpriced and not quite there to be a nice refreshing lager. But Bigfoot was good."
"Drinkability depends on how much you actually enjoy the beer (obviously) . I didn't enjoy the flavor, so drinkability wasn't good for me."
"cheers."
"Taste: Most definately grassy, with the aftertaste of baby radish shoots, or maybe those wheatgrass shots you can get in those yuppie juice bars. Ok maltyness, aftertaste lasts long, and sticks to your tongue, I like that."
"Notes: Another good beer from Sierra Nevada. This beer seems to have a lot more hops, but I like it."
"Pours a clear golden color with a small white head that leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is malty and has some hints of grassy hops. The flavor is much the same. Quite a bit of graininess, and a little hops. Something about this one just didn't sit right with me. It's just ok for a summer lager. The drinkability was ok, and the body was moderate."
"Taste, too, was full of wheat and cream--with ample sweetness. Soft medium carbonation went nicely and helped to give this beer a real light feel despite the obvious body. A great after-the-fact sharp bitterness keeps things interesting. Very much drinkable with an excellent feel."
"I think I'd enjoy this beer more if it has a better dosing of hops. It seems a bit dumbed down to me, but, as the style goes, it works, just my preference. Still, it's nice an refreshing and quite easy to put back."
"Summerfest is a pretty good Saaz-hopped pale lager, even if my lack of affinity for that particular hop variety keeps me from loving it. That said, this Yankee Pale Lager kicks the crap out of the vast majority of its Euro counterparts."
"I would recommend this ale to someone who would be classified as an ""extreme hops addict"" (not just a fan of hoppy beers), or if you've never had a bad Sierra Nevada product. Otherwise, I'd make another selection at the liquor store."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale malts and lager yeast. It has a dry aroma. The taste is decent. It has a crisp pale malt flavor with a slight hop bitterness and a very dry lager yeast finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent lager. It has excellent aroma and smooth flavor; a good drinker."
"Light, tight head at start. Clear, light gold hue with bubbles buzzing about as if in a pinball machine, or perhaps more descriptively, a pachinko machine, only balls were ascending, not descending. Wheat, white wine bouquet, and slightly sour on the nose. Some hoppiness, which was surprising, and for me it almost beat out the wheat base. Quite astringent to taste, yet also oddly smooth and clinging. Overall, a shochu-like acidity to the offering."
"Very tasty and light, a combination that lends itself to drinkability."
"Summerfest pours (a colorful descriptive) with a (descriptive) head. The (fancy word for smell) is all fruity cereal flakes, matchsticks and dead lawn. Summerfest inspires me about as much as the tumbler I'm gulping it from. It's really a decent brew though. I imagine if I lived in a house and mowed my own lawn I would drink water afterward, but after the water and maybe a sandwich or something this might be good. It seems a bit heavy grain on the attack but a nice bunch of herbal greens takes over quickly enough. I like it better really cold."
"The one thing this beer has going for it is that is very refreshing. I had this beer after a walk with a sausage and it did the job just fine. This is easily the lightest and most uninteresting of the SN line, this beer is just plain and uninspired. The taste hardly goes beyond simple hops and a light body."
"This is a very drinkable beer, good for consumption at the end of a hot day. This is the first lager I've had from Sierra Nevada. Not bad."
"Clear amber/gold color, with a big head of really large bubbles that disappears quickly. Not a huge smell, mostly sweet malt, with a touch of grassy hops. Taste is really interesting, some sweet malt, but also with a lot of spicy, but certainly not overpowering, hops and a slightly bitter finish. Nice crisp, clean mouthfeel, good hop presence balanced with good carbonation. Real easy drinkability. I'm impressed, a great, crisp, light summer brew."
"The mouthfeel is crisp as the carbonation is strong. The finish is a little crisp and dry. This is a lighter bodied brew. Extremely drinkable for a hot summer day and the flavor is just strong enough to excite some tastebuds without sending them into overload."
"This beer really doesn't bring to mind the dog days of summer. For me, it is just a hopped up fizzy yellow brew. I think SN's Wheat Beer was more interesting than this, and that one previously held the title for my least favorite SN brew. This is still a well-made brew, no doubt about it, but there isn't enough here to keep my interest."
"A rather average offering that pours a light goden and does proffer up a bit of head and some splotchy lace. Some freshness is noted on the nose, featuring citrus hop, and sweet malt, all way in the background. The mouthfeel is light and mildly brisk, yet not really that refreshing going down. Flavors mimic the aromas with lemony hop notes and a kiss of sweet malt. Not a bad beer at all, but I don't find it too Summery personally."
"A good beer, nice summer time brew."
"Very good summer beer for kicking back and putting a few away. Tast is crisp and refreshing with a light maltiness and touch of spicy hops. Mouthfeel is a perfect balance, light enough to remain drinkable without feeling heavy on a hot day. First beer I actually liked from Sierra Nevada, good job."
"The smell was nice and crisp, hop and malt pretty equally balanced and a bit of a light grassy note as well. The taste was pretty complex for a pilsner, many echoes of fruit and a rather sweet note with a very light hop finish. It was light on the tongue, leaving a clean palate for the next drink though as a pilsner I would have expected a bit more fine carbonation leaving a bit of tingle on the tongue to go with a nice hop finish - here it's quite a bit more muted. Pilsner or what, this is a very tasty brew and it's a good light beer for summertime sipping..."
"Overall, this is yet another good beer from sierra nevada, not my favorite from them, but definately a good lager."
"A summer keeper for sure."
"Pours a bright, golden yellow with a medium-sized pure white head which leaves some fine lacing on the glass. Smell is lightly malty with some grassy hops. Taste is grain and a little sweet malt at first, followed by grassy, maybe a bit piney hops. Crisp, refreshing finish with very good balance. Medium to light mouthfeel with a good amount of carbonation. Very, very drinkable... this is a beer for drinking in large gulps on a very hot day!"
"There's a real nice balance between hops and malt in the nose, but not too aggressive on either front. That impression continues to the palate. An initial burst of sweetness gives way to more dominant malty characteristics, almost grainy, but certainly not in a bad way- almost like a German Pils. The finish is dry and lingering. This beer definitely benefits from a vigorous pour as its aroma is its best quality. It has a nice balance about it as well, though I would wish for a touch more personality."
"I had the Summerfest with a salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Both worked very well together...nice pairing."
"Summerfest is Sierra Nevada's only lager, I believe. It pours a clear, light, golden color with small bubbles and a thin white head that fades to a mere coating on the surface of the beer. Smell is bready and with a hint of spicey hops. Taste is very light, with some wheat flavors and a slightly tart and dry finish with a very small hop bite. Mouthfeel is also light making this an extremely refreshing and incredibly drinkable beer. A very well-crafted lawnmower beer."
"As soon as I opened the bottle, foam came frothing out all over, so I expected to have trouble with the pour. When I did start pouring into the pint though, there was no trouble. Tons of carbination rising throught the golden lager leading up to a small amount of tiny bubbles at the top where it stayed as mostly a light, white layer. Scents of hay, fresh and light. Very balanced. Crisp tasting, medium bodied with alot of carbination that holds well throughout. The finish is dry and leaves a very nice bitterness with you. Good drinkability. I am usually not one for lagers but will drink them if they are there- just not my first choice. But this one is nice."
"Poured out a golden color with a nice amount of carbonation that was visible and left lacing around the glass. Hop aromas hit the nose with some slight malts left in the background for good measure. Some grassy aroma can also be detected. Spicy hops hit the palate first and then combine with some malts towards the end. Some grainy flavors are in the aftertaste along with those spicy hops that seem to last forever. It's not over the top but it sure does last a while. Overall this isn't a bad choice for a summer cookout. Goes down easy, that's for sure."
"Poured a sparkling clear yellow-golden in color with not a bit of head. Miniscule white head does a nice attempt at lacing the glass, but with token success. Aromas are quite clean brisk. Hoppy, but not overly so. There is a hint of malts there as well. Flavor is more of the same. An interesting mix of hops and that ""lager"" flavor. Not quite macro, but more mainstream than I'd expected. Maybe that's why it was so popular with the crowd at CAH. Brisk and snappy flavor, starting with a mildly bitter front, fleeting sweetness in the middle, and dry/acidic on the tail end. Moderate carbonation and decent mouthfeel. A good beer for the summer, no doubt, but I think I'll stick to my hefe's to quench the Richmond heat."
"Pours a clean, super clear looking golden color...big fluffy head....nose is grassy with some lemon grass notes...taste is grainy and spicy with noble hops present in bunches...some spritzy lemon notes too...lighter side of medium bodied....finishes dry and crisp....almost a slight bitter finish...feels like a Pilsner...not bad but not one I would personally seek out...One of bigHugey's pool party's featured a keg of this and after awhile (say after 12 or so) it was hard to drink for me....I think Summer beers should be easy drinking up to 30 or so...."
"The taste was of bittering hops on the foretaste, with hints of pine and minimal citrus. Possibly coriander as well. It was about average, IMO."
"Meh, not a fan of the hype. Medium gold in color, some head, and moe then enough lace. smells is so so, something didn't seem right, dunno. This isn't overly malty, like most lagers, but something didn't seem right. I mean the hops were adding a pecular taste. It's mouthfeel is OK, but all in all, this isn't very special IMO"
"One of my favorite domestic lagers. Pours to a generous white head and clear golden color. Aroma is very hoppy--like smelling hops freshly added to the brewpot. Malty sweetness is apparent in the aroma. Flavor is dry, pleasantly bitter/hoppy and good malt backup. Finishes dry and refreshing. A fine beer that deserves year-round production."
"D&N: A supremely drinkable beer. Tasty, not too strong, this one has me wishing I had bought a few more. If the smells were a bit better, this would be a five. Highly recommended."
"This is a good beer and is nice on a hot day. I would buy this again, but not likely as a first choice."
"Sierra Nevada never fails to dissapoint. The 2004 edition of summerfest is excellent. The beer pours a dark/yellow with a white head that is very impressive, lacing is also great. The smell is rather clean with grain upfront, other than traces of floral it is very clean to the nose. The taste is excellent, light bodied, refreshing and crisp. Floral hops are the first thing you notice in the taste, some sweetness from the malts, slight melon tastes as well. A perfect summer beer. I highly recommend for camping trips, get togethers, BBQ's etc."
"The only beer in Sierra Nevada's lineup where I've come away disappointed. Not a bad beer, and certainly an interesting change from the normal summer hefe/wheat options, but the flavor is ultimately a bit of a let down. I'll enjoy the rest of my six pack, but this isn't a beer I'll be coming back to."
"Crisp and refreshing, overall. A very drinkable example of a well done American effort at a German pale lager or Pils."
"As a rule i'm not impressed with lagers. This one is not really an exception. There is hops there, there is malt there, but the overall flavor profile is just like a macro. Only more forceful. As a lawnmower, i'd say its passable, but has too much hops for a thirstquencher, which is what i want in a summerbrew."
"crystal clear golden with a white head that sticks around for a bit. smells floral and citrusy with a eurohop backbone. fresh hops and fruit dominate the taste along with a light malty balance. not at all watery, with an appropriate amount of carbonation. a good drink for a hot day, but nothing really special for sierra nevada"
"Pours light amber with compact white head that leaves nice lace in a clean glass. Faint hop aroma and smooth mouthfeel. Very light hop flavor and little bitterness from Saaz and Perle hops. Sweet malt flavor is balanced to the hops. Quite good for a pilsner style light lager. Not a favorite style for me and I would stick to the ORIGINAL pilsner if I were going to drink more. It does a good job of quenching thirst which is important in a summer beer. It will not take the Pale Ale's place in my summer line-up."
"Like any good summer beer, this goes down smooth and easy. Very thirst-quenching. Might rotate this one around at poolside with a few other good summer beers. Light enough to drink a few and good enough to want to."
"Not a bad take in the pilsner style. Nothing to get overly excited about, but a solid effort overall. A fine lawnmower beer."
"Light, crisp and smooth."
"It's easy to envision a split camp on this beer. The aroma promises big things, but the flavor comes off a bit diluted, and, well, fluffy. Still, enough of the elements poke their head through the clouds that the palate note an occasional poignancy, and those distinctions are real positives. It's light, and very refreshing, and that along with the flavor pretty much defines drinkable. In spite of some minor palatal ennui, I'm looking forward to drinking the four I have left. So, it's maybe not stellar, but it shines a bit in the vast Atlantic shore sky."
"Overall- a decent summer beer. I tend to find must summer beers watery and weak. If Sierra Nevada tryed to pass this beer off as anything but a summer beer it wouldn't fly."
"2004 Edition. From the bottle pours a crystal clear golden liquid with a white foamy head. The head stayed for a little while. There was not much lace left on the glass. Smell is slightly grassy. Taste is a good combo of pale sweet malt and a fair amount of grassy/herbal hop flavor with a dry finish. Light bodied, but not watery and the carbonation level was where it should be for this style. Overall, not bad. Lagers like this typicall do not appeal to me, but this could be a good thirst quencher. It was pretty crisp and clean, with a nice balance. I would probably be willing to have another one. Could make a good backyard session brew this summer."
"There is a dry/sugary aftertaste that begs for more. I had this for Preakness last weekend. This mixes up quite well with other summer beers and pilsners. Summerfest, burgers, and warm weather is a good time."
"Bought a six of 2003 yesterday. I remember I had this last summer and wanted to try it again. Clever label with a twist-off cap. Golden color in my class with a thick head that rose to the top. Nice lacing as it settles. Hoppy aroma like most Sierra Nevada beers. Tastes bitter and hoppy and is very enjoyable. The wheat\grain has a noticeable taste which adds to the pleasure of drinking this beer. Very drinkable IMO!! A good buy."
"ng"
"All together, this one is redeeming to the style in my opinion. When compared to the swillish brethren available in abundance it is a shining star. Still not my favorite style, but a solid contender none-the-less."
"Pours a pale golden hue with a sizeable foamy white head. Nice nose of yeast and light hops. Palate begins with a light floral hoppiness that builds to a slightly bitter finish. Nice, clean, light body. Could be balanced a little better, but overall still a very nice summer ale."
"Pours a very clear yellow, with a tinge of orange. Aroma hits you with some grainyness, and a subtle scent of citrous hops. Taste is clean and refreshing. There is a good laid back maltiness, much like a budweiser, but a slight dose of flavoring hops spices this up a bit. Fruity, yet still very light. this is not cascade crazy like many SN products. Just hopped well enough to balance and add some taste to a clean lager. Clean mouthfeel, good dry finish, with a refeshing aftertaste. This is a great lighter offering - the perfect summer - or session - brew"
"I really enjoyed this beer and will make it a regular this summer when we are hanging out in the backyard."
"Decent summer lager, I'm sure it's refreshing, but I'd rather not spend my beer money on this."
"This beer poured a golden yellow color, with a thick white head. Smell is faintly hoppy, with a grainy undertone. For me, the taste was dominated by the grainy flavor. The mouthfeel was fine, but nothing spectacular. I could drink these all day, and it is certainly a fine summer brew. However, all in all I would say it is a disappointment, I just expected something more complex and exotic. Reminds me too much of Pilsner Urquell."
"Nice deep golden color-minimal head,decent carbonation level.Aroma quite floral and hoppy.Being a Sierra product goes without saying.Malty flavor with an upfront hoppiness.Quite bitter actually.Almost a grain flavor lingering.Nice full mouthfeel-again bitter but also quite smooth overall.A good effort from Sierra considering they dont do lagers-dont know if id call it a pils,kolsch or what but nice none the less."
"Comment: I am going to email SN to beg them to make this a year around brew"
"At very least, it's in the discussion. Consummately refreshing, and the perfect follow up to a round of golf."
"Overall: A fine session, and if I'm going to drink a watery, low flavor beer, this would make a fine one. That's probably a bit harsh, and I acknowledge this isn't a prefered style, so I won't slam the ratings. This was quite drinkable, and beats the snot out of BMC, but just not a thriller."
"Pours a pale amber with a nice off white head. Lace is nice all the way to the bottom of the glass. Smell is abundantly hoppy and very pleasant. Mouthfeel is excellent with carbonation. One of the better of the brews by Sierra. Definitely will buy as long as in season, a good beer."
"Mouthfeel is a little chewy, nice and dry at the finish, and perfect for hot-weather quaffing. Drinkability is high, and I may just have to have this on hand for the 4th this year."
"This is a great tasting lager. Moderately hopped with herbal and fruity notes. Malty flavor really shows up as the beer warms. Great grainy/bready aftertaste but still with a crisp finish. Makes you want another sip. Far better than the other common summer brews out there (samuel adams, petes). A great tasting lager in my opinion. Very easy drinking. I was pleasantly surprised by this brew and will probably pick them up again this summer."
"Nevermind. I (think I) know the answer."
"I tried this same six-pack a few moths ago and really did not like it. It seemed overwhelmingly imbalanced. It seems to have mellowed well."
"A good summer brew to be had and a good smooth bud convert tool."
"This lager poured a light amber yellow color with creamy, white foam that coated the glass well. There was nice, persistent bubbling. The smell had notes of citrus and floral hops on top of light lager malt. The taste was mild : malty and hoppy. There was a hint of floral hops and a touch of citrus. The finish was nicely hoppy. The mouthfeel was crisp with medium body and good carbonation. There was a touch of sweetness in the aftertaste, along with some hops. This was a light, refreshing pilsner."
"Update: 4 Months later I had a Stone IPA and never looked back. After following the path to hop-enlightenment, this beer is now merely a great pilsner."
"Local retailer must be trying to get rid of these as they were in the single bottle area. It poured a nice golden color, had a light fruity hop aroma , had a clean light taste, nicely bubbley and refreshing, flavors were bold and complex. Hope to get this sooner next year. A couple of these on the beach, hey where am I going?"
"Transparent golden hue, large rocky head, awesome lacing throughout. Nice aroma of hops, appears to be thin yet crisp off the cuff. Tingy hop taste throughout, some spice and lemon peel with a decent light malty backbone. Grainy flavoring pushes through; highly quaffable, for a summer session brew, this one is off the charts!"
"It has a definate carbonation bite in the mouthfeel. Crisp and refreshing it will quech a persons thirst on a hot day. A very easy drinking beer. Overall it is pretty good. Not great. The tangy taste and after taste left me with a sour overall finish which I particularily did not like."
"Light gold color, large white foamy head. Aroma is grassy, grainy and sweet. A medium bodied light and refreshing summer beer.Mildly hopped, slightly malty. A mild flavored beer, slightly spicy. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is mild. Aftertaste is slightly bitter and mild."
"This beer is a bright clear gold color with a nice white head. There is a nice hop aroma accompanied by a slight lemon aroma and some floral grassy notes. There is a sharp carbonation which gives a sense of acidity up front. Nice and clean tasting with a hop bite finish. This lager has a very clean bitterness from the hops. There is a nice amount of body, but it is still quite quenching. This clean beer is a vehicle for the hop aroma and bitterness that the brewers have seen fit to add."
"Great session beer, probably better suited for relaxing after the participatory event, not during. Solid beer, to be enjoyed in multiple bottle quantities."
"Comments  I have to part with the (current) 3.62 rating of by BA Buds (on average). This offering from SN nailed the style, IMO."
"Crystal clear and golden in appearance, with a very thin head. The aroma is led by a lovely graininess, and a clean, lager-like hoppiness. Deliciously tasty, too. A bit spicy, with a lightly bready malt body, a husky grain flavor mid-palate, and a snappy, floral/lemon peel hop finish. Light and crisp in body and eminently drinkable. Good stuff!"
"Beautiful golden appearance with a monumental head. Smell was light as to be expected in a summer offering. Tatse was smooth, with very little aftertaste. Mouthfeel was medium and somewhat smooth, but not overly so. Drinkability ws good, with very little bite back."
"Pours to a brilliant clear golden color with a thick white head. The aroma is grainy, crisp, with a light hoppiness. The flavor is clean, with a nice light maltiness and hoppiness. It has a very light bitterness in the finish. It is light in bodied and easy drinking. A very clean, smooth beer."
"Notes: Easy to drink beer. Nice summertime thirst quencher. Much better than most breweries summer seasonal offerings."
"This is a pleasing, simple, easy drinkin' beer. Perfect for a summer refresher."
"This wasn't a bad brew, but the flavor wasn't quite as clean as I like my pilsners to be."
"Not a bad choice for a hot summer day."
"It looked bright and golden, with a nice, tight head. The aroma was of slight malt and somewhat more pronounced hops, but it didn't stand out as much as advertised. The taste was a crisp mix of mild old-world hops and standard pale malts. A simple mixture that left a good, solid, pilsner with a clean finish."
"This beer is a nice crisp, clear-golden color, looks very refreshing. Theres a big white head on top, with lots of lacing down the sides. Also present are lots of little bubbles rising to the top. This is a very crisp tasting lager, with a nice bitter hop character present as well. Not the best beer in the world, but damn fine for a nice hot day."
"Pours a clear golden yellow, with a big, wet, white head. I'm picking up graham cracker sweet malts, and slight hops. The taste is buttery smooth and apple-y sweet malts, with a quenchingly crisp bittersweet finish. Pretty refreshing summer brew. Not my favorite SN product."
"I was really not too impressed with this one. Pours a rich golden color with a medium and fizzy off-white head. Very bubbly with thin lacing. Aroma is mild hops with a pinch of citrus. Light and crisp but ultimately uninspiring in the flavor department. It tasted about a 1/2 step better than the rest of the bland Lagers out there. The finish is decent but I honestly found my interest waning way before the end of the glass."
"Pours out a pale golden/orangish type color with a medium white head that vanishes completely. Aroma is that of citrus and grassy hops some malt but not that noticeable. I enjoyed this summer brew, citrus hops and sweet malt taste a slight lemon flavor also. Had a little bit of carbonation giving it a slight crisp mouthfeel, but it was rather smooth. Very good, easily drinkable definetly a beer to enjoy while outdoors relaxing by a pool or at the beach."
"This beer poured out a pale golden yellow color with a decent amount of carbonation. The white head quickly dissipated. The pleasing aroma is strong on grains with a citrus hop tang. The taste is very dry and has little aftertaste, even after the beer warmed up. Hop aroma and bitterness is there but does not overwhelm. A very light and drinkable beer. I would like to have more of this."
"Deep golden color shows great clarity. The beer pours with a tight, white head that displays excellent retention. A mild peppery aroma with a hint of sweetness greets the nose. Also a touch of grassiness in there as well. The taste is crisp and clean, with a lingering bitterness on the finish. The slightly sweet malt up front is swept away nicely by the hops. The mouthfeel is very rewarding for this mildly flavored beer. Drinkability is also good. You wanna talk crossover beer? This is a good candidate to serve at your next summer party. Just a well done lager."
"Drinkability: I was well beyond halfway done before I realized it. A real good session beer for those days by the pool, standing over the grill, etc."
"Overall: Why doesnt SN call this a Lager I wonder? An extremely pleasant surprise anyways. Exactly why I expected a bland offering I do not know, but I did. My prejudice was unfounded, and I was quite simply knocked sideways by the quality of this Lager (oops there I said it). A fantastic beer for a hot So. Cal. night!"
"A very credible lager coming from the aleheads at SN. Pale gold, crystal-clear with wispy, lacey head. Gentle aroma of musty yeasts and flowery hops. Malts are light, sweet and bolstered by big hop quality that lets you know this beer was brewed on the left coast! Otherwise a note-perfect European lager that goes down easy, refreshes the palate, quenches the thirst. The tempered but defiant hop kick is flowery, sweet, and really creates a summer feeling. Drinkability is beyond the pale. This is a unique beer and an excellent one. It's one of the best summer seasonals I can think of, and I enjoy it more than the overplayed currently-shadow-of-its-former-self SN Pale Ale. This beer should be a no-brainer for a BBQ, it's light enough for daytime drinking and should stand up to spicy meats and sauces. Furthermore, everyone will be pleased with it; the more adventurous drinkers have some toothsome hops to wrap their tastebuds around, while the quivering timid masses have a light, pale, cleansing lager that is very non-threatening. Pour it into a tall pilsner glass with a huge head."
"Tastes great, drinks great, …yeah, this'll do."
"I liked this beer. I had it with my pizza tonight, and it came across as a mildly bitter, refreshing pils. A nice dry hoppiness, clean and refreshing. Tastier than a lot of pilsners, with an interesting balance between the usual micro bitterness and a typical lager smoothness."
"12oz. bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada pint glass. It pours a very clear, very pale gold color with 2 fingers of head and some lacing. The smell is a mix of grass and hops, crisp smell. The taste is very light with a faint bit of grassy malt and a good hops balance. Just a little short on taste for me. The mouthfeel is a little light and oily, but the drinkability is superb. Great on a hot summer night."
"Ahhh."
"Another very good beer from a very competent brewery!"
"Pours a crystal clear golden hue with a white frothy head, leavs a nice collar of lace that lasts throughout the session with this beer. Aroma is slightly sweet of lemongrass notes mixed with the graininess and nice touch of delicate hop bitterness to complete the aroma. Taste is a refreshing well made crisp clean lager predominantly sweet grassy notes balance out with a light hopping and full bready tone which is very pleasing in the heat great summer beer in all regards. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied but by no means thin or watery one smoothly textured drinkable true lager. I could go fishing with a six pack of this beer any day, truely great for beating the heat."
"PS - This is a freaking addictive session brew (e.g. fruit lambics). Remember, there's water too."
"This is a nice golden colored beer. It gave off a frothy whitehead and left a patchy sticky lace to the end of my beer. The aroma was light and refreshing. Hints of pepper and citrus are noted with a light malt aroma left behind. The taste is refreshing; mainly malt to start with a nice flavor of the hops coming in at the end for the finish. Another beer that I will keep on hand and another r fine brew form the folks from Sierra Nevada. Thanks to Scooter77 for dropping this one off while taking my old beer bottles to his house for his oatmeal stout."
"Pours a pale gold with a slightly hoppy aroma. There is a nice, slightly spicy, hoppy bitterness in the flavor followed by a dry maltiness. Slightly citric. Not a bad beer actually. A lighter lager that actually has a little flavor. I'm kind of surprised that a brewery that's known for it's big in your face ales could make such a delicate lager (although it is hoppier than the typical lager.)"
"What the hell is this? I was shocked by this unimaginably unexciting beer. Sure I could taste a mild yet full golden malt flavor. It was lightly wrapped in a floral hop blanket, and this was not a displeasure, but from Sierra Nevada, I expect excitment. I expect to be put in the drivers seat in motor cross. This was lame, like the Porter. If the hops were more pumped up and balanced with the chew (not really the right ward there) malt, this would be a decent beer. should I beer warned and no to stray far from their PA?"
"Looks real nice. Thick, creamy, bubbley, white head. Settles to a moderate size. Provides very good lacing. The beer itself is colored a plain yellow. Smells a little spicy. Also a little chemical. Similar taste. Feels a bit unpleasant on the mouth, but not too bad. A little chewy. Not the worst beer. Very mediocre."
"This beer was just brutal. I bought a six pack and tried three days in a row to ""give it another chance"". Nothing doing. A yellow colur, I could taste a bit of hops. But it is just harsh, and I mean harsh. Every sip is a challange. It grinds down your throat. This is not a summer beer. I don't know what it is."
"nice hop characteristic for a lager... head dissappears pretty quickly when poured from the bottle, but that can be forgiven. some ""herbal"" / grassy notes in the flavor profile. Drinkable and just the right level of alcohol. Actually it's a good Spring beer if you live in California. But it should hit the spot when the weather gets hotter, too."
"Well, not sure about this one; not what I would produce as a summer beer myself, but then again I am not in charge here. I will have to sample this one again at a later date to reconfirm how it tasted to me on this one, as it fell on me taste quite harshly. Draft beer poured golden-light with puddles of thin foam, esp. around the edges of the glass. Somewhat fragrant smell of hops. Taste was quite tart and hoppy, but I would have liked this one better with balancing malt profile. I never had this beer before but am familiar with their pale ale and use of hops, so I was rather expecting a fair amount, but overall the taste did not hit me right (this time). My non-affection for this one surprised me: I love their other beers I have tried."
"It's about 90 degrees today, so I decided to test the Summerfest. It pours a clear yellow with a nice foamy white head that's very inviting. The smell is surprisingly nice for a summer lager: floral hops and a very nice hop smell that has undercurrents of bread/biscuit. The malt smell is more than backed up by the flavor and the hops lend a slight bite while contributing a nice tropical flower taste. Drinkability? I'm still trying to figure out where it went."
"While not a juggernaut of pils flavor, it is enjoyable and worthwhile."
"This is a great warm weather brew from Sierra Nevada. If you are kicking back on a hot summer day, this is definantly a great choice. It poured a clear golden color with a nice white head that lasted awhile, leaving a decent lace down till the end. The malty characteristics really stood out in the smell, with some grassy and hoppy smells as well. The taste was a great summer balance between malt and hops, with the malt being the dominant flavor. As the beer warms a bit, the hops come through a bit more, and it tasted more balanced. All in all a great summer brew."
"Clear golden color with a big white foamy head that lasts for awhile, earthy and flowery aromas, light malt with a heavy dose of hops in the flavor, light bodied with a crisp carbonated mouthfeel, a great light summer beer, easy to knock back a few in the sun."
"Summerfest"
"This was a dissappointment since sierra nevada is such a respected brewery for me. I appreciate them trying to make a lager, but this just doesn't live up to their ales. It pours clear golden with no head at all. The hop character is the one redeeming quality. It's slightly spicy with a citrusy aroma and taste similar to their pale ale. It's nice and light for a apertif though. It left me craving something bigger. Luckily I have a bigfoot ready to drink."
"Not the most complex of beers, but I don't think that is what Sierra Nevada is aiming for here. It's a thirst quencher on a hot day, and it fits that role well. The malt character of the beer is pretty high, and thus the full malty finish is its defining characteristic. Mild citrus flavors are also detectable. Mouthfeel is carbonated and bubbly, but does not detract from the drinkability. Worth a try, and I can see myself drinking more of this when the weather gets hot."
"This is one of those products that your favorite brewer puts out that you just wish they hadn't. SN has some of my favorite brews and is the beer I buy most consistently, but this lager should be left out of the lineup. It is pale and somewhat carbonated and has little to offer in the smell department other than hops and some sweet smells. The taste is hoppy but there are malt hints as well. Not nearly as hoppy as I have come to expect from SN, maybe due to the style. It is drinkable. Its not that it is a bad beer, just that I have come expect alot from the brewery."
"Pours golden amber in color with a massive rocky white head that leaves thick sheets of lace on the sides of the glass as it slowly dissipates. Nose is dominated by floral hops and perfume with some additional grassy herbal notes. Light to medium in body with a moderate amount of active carbonation. Taste is lightly spicy hops and bitter grain husks up front followed by just a touch of sweet malts and then some lemony notes and citrusy hops. A very refreshing beer and one of the best summer brews on the market."
"Overall a good beer. Summerfest is quite fitting as this would make a great lawnmower beer."
"This one pours a clear golden that is pleasant and has a short yet thick head. The nose is sweet malt with a refreshing scent that is highlighted by almost minty hops. The flavor is a rich and malty body with a crisp hoppy finish that is enlivening. The aftertaste is nearly non-existent and pleasant hops. Overall a very satisfying beer that is very drinkable"
"This brew has long been my lawnmower beer of choice; just perfect for slaking your thirst on a hot summer day. It pours a solid 14k gold with a voluminous frothy white head. The aroma is of lightly kilned malt, herbal/grassy hops and just a hint of lemon. This brew is nicely balanced. I taste light malt which has, if only for an instant, a vanilla-like sweetness. Herbal hops and some cereal-tasting grain are also present as well as just a slight citrusy twist on the finish. Not overly complex, but it shouldn't be. Recommend this one to your macro-swilling friends. You just might convert them."
"-F"
"A most drinkable summer beer..will have more than once this coming summer."
"Ok, it's warmed up a little... hops are sitting down more, malt comes through a little better (less metallic caramel, more body). Taste is still just a little soapy. Overall, this is quite good: a nice appetizer beer."
"The beer pours a crystal clear bright gold color, the head pertinent in size, frothy texture that leaves lots of lace to coat the glass. Fruit sweet aromas, over lying the malt, citrus crisp and fresh, quite sniffable with sweet malt front. Top is middling in mouth feel, the finish bitingly acidic, meaningful hop spicy bite, the aftertaste dry."
"After pouring this beer and seeing the medium yellow color. I tried to pick up the aroma, but could'nt find any. Don't know if this was a bad bottle, but, this was a no nothing beer. Maybe a slight citrus feel in the mouth, but that was it! Save this brew for a junkyard dog! Not for me!"
"Ill be looking forward to drinking more of this next summer."
"Clear (filtered) golden body topped by a big, creamy, bright-white head that holds well and leaves some limited lace. Nice aroma of malt and hops with some fruitiness and a bright lemony note that I assume comes from citrusy hops. The body is medium-light with a very fine & slightly effervescent carbonation, making it very silky in the mouth. The flavor is lightly hoppy and citrusy up-front, warming into a lightly sweet maltiness as it crosses the palate, and drying out just before the swallow with some more light hop flavor and bitterness. All of these flavors are carried over, to some extent, into the aftertaste. A really refreshing and interesting change of pace that really does make a great summer beer. Not complicated, but with alot of finesse. Somewhat lighter in flavor and easy to drink, but with some distinct hop character and bitterness. Very nice, fairly unique, and well brewed."
"2002 release. Golden with a big white head that leaves a patchy lace, but doesn't stay for long. Subtle aromas in the nose, some hop aroma that's a bit plant-like and citrus-like. Hop bitterness plays a big role in the flavor, with grain right behind it. Once again, a bit plant-like with citrus. Smoothness in the mouthfeel is interrupted by the hops. I didn't find this as refreshingly satisfying as this type of lager should be. Hops take over where they shouldn't. Not too bad, but there are many in this style that I'd put above this one."
"Hazy medium gold color with a stunningly thick off-white head that lasts.  Lots of thick, sticky lace with modest carbonation.  Aroma consists of grassy notes and grain.  Pronounced hops assert themselves from the beginning of the taste, towards the middle, mildly sweet malts dominate, finishes with bitter citrus notes.  As others have noted, this beer improves as it warms up a bit from typical refrigerator temperature.  Remarkably refreshing, a quintessential summer beer that beats its competitors hands down."
"BRIGHT yellow-gold body, lively carbonation, foamy, lively white head that reaches above glass. Looks classic. Real good looking lace. Lot of grain in aroma.  Very clean taste, with a nice hop zing balancing a good malt backbone. Nice medium mouthfeel, not too fizzy, not too heavy. Excellent summer refreshment. The subtle member of the SN  family, It took me a couple of summers to really appreciate this beer."
"Clear golden color with minimal head and large amounts of carbonation.  There was a very hoppy aroma which carried through into the flavor.  There was a very slight malty aftertaste that increases as it warms, but not enough for me as the hops overpowers it.  It was very smooth, but full of flavor without detectable grain or other add-ons that can take away from the flavor.  An excellent lager."
"Golden yellow, with a thick white head that reduces to a fine layer on top of the beer. Never really goes away. Smells a bit grassy, bready, lemon zest. Taste is full and rich and lager-like (though you'd never confuse this with a typical American macro lager, that's for sure). Bitter herbal hops hit you up front, again lemon zest, grassy. Just a trace of malty sweetness, more so after the beer warms a bit. I'd like a bit more, but oh well. Bitter finish, but refreshing, especially on such a perfect sunshiny day as today."
"Bright luminous yellow, head is a mixture of bubble sizes and holds some shapes in the middle.  A bit of unraised bread to the aroma.  Nice crisp hops in this brew, touch of a bitter green olive tang.  Malt is secondary but adds a little maple sweetness and character to the body. Overall, light in impression, but this beer is satisfying as well as refreshing.  To me, one of the better Sierra Nevada products, I've been underwelmed by some of their Ales."
"Summerfest: a clear, golden lager.  Thick head with nice lace.  Light macro-lager aroma.  Thin body, flat taste, little hop zest, lingering malty aftertaste.  I am at a loss to understand this beer, it seems like a good macro-lager, but at its price, I’d give it a pass."
"Straw/yellow color. Light toasted bread and spicy/fruity hop aroma and flavor. A delicious, crisp, clean, hoppy, thirst quenching lager. Can't remember the last time I thought in terms of ""pounding"" beer, but with this one it's tempting. Cheers to summer!"
"clean, clear, crisp.  citrus and spice and everything nice.  for a seasonal summer pilsener...pretty good.  for a sierra nevada product, pretty tame.  a solid summer seasonal that has an excellent thirst quenching quality to it.  no negative comments here.  would have loved to imbibed a keg of this poolside down in mpls-st.paul like ZAP and Bighuge did.  lucky dogs!"
"Pours an extremely clear golden color with a 2 finger slightly off-white head.  The smell is a very familiar hoppy smell that Sierra Nevada is notorious for with a lemony smell as well.  The taste is slightly hoppy with  a grass/lemon taste.  Fairly refreshing, but below Sierra Nevada's normal standard.  Cheers!"
"Clear golden yellow pour...fizzy white head, faded fast. Noticable hop aromas, combined with traditional beer smells of a pilsener. Taste was a little thin, and overly bitter hop wise on the finish. Not much malt or anything like it. Somewhat flat tasting at the bottom of the glass. Although it was crisp and light, it lacked the balanced flavor of the other SN products I have sampled. IMO, Prima Pils is much better in this class."
"Good carbonation and head.  Citrusy overtone, clearly a light body, crisp, clean summer lager.  Some hops on the finish but they don't rip your face off."
"A crisp and clean lager with a focus on citrusy, spicy hop flavors.  Quite enjoyable when someone else brings it to your party, but not a ""hunt and seek"" beer."
"light, crisp, and a good tasting summer brew. it has that little citrus hint to it and leaves a spicy aftertaste. this beer did its job being very refreshing on a hot summer day. not as smooth as you could wish for, but overall it was enjoyable"
"Golden in color with a slight haze.  Very fine bubble action in the glass. and a fluffy white head which lasts as a continuous sheen on the brew.  Malt nose with crisp hops.  Very fresh smelling.  The original taste is one of malt and slight bitterness on the tongue.  Then your tongue is left with citrus (lemon) and hints of pepper.  The finish is also quite smooth.  This is not the best SN product, but it beats most summer seasonal brews that are out there."
"Disregarding weizen style beers,because there are a lot of great summer weizen beers, this is one of the 2 elite summer brews that I have tried.  (The other is Goose Island Summertime Kolsch.)"
"This 2002 version poured out a dark straw colored.  Formed a nice white head, that left some lace as it subsided.  Slight citrus and hops aroma to it.  Taste had citrus elements and gave it a slight tang.  Okay, for a summer beer, but there are better ones."
"This brew deserves more recognition than it's overall rating portrays.  SN Summerfest easily would be my first choice in choosing the perfect pilsner."
"Nice for the style,not to hoppy good malt-accented beer.Light color with a decent head.Would try again,Iam not into summer accrnted lighter beers.Bring on Oktoberfest!"
"Clear with a medium white head with muted aroma.  Not as hoppy as I expected.  Still, this beer has a lingering bitterness that I enjoyed.  Seems to be very ""polite"" for a Sierra Nevada product.  Very well made, and very enjoyable."
"A very tasty summer pilsener, with a good balance of malt and somewhat restrained by adequate hopping.  In thinking back to last year's edition, this seems a little softer and less distinct than last year, which I recall as a little crisper and more hoppy.  Still, Summerfest '02 looks like it will be one of my BBQ grilling companions this year."
"Pours a bright straw color with a thin white head that sank quickly.  Smell is slightly hoppy.  Taste s a bit more subtle than I would like it to be.  Nice malt backbone, but comes up a little short on the hops.  I would like them a little spicier.  Nice smooth body and very drinkable.  Not a bad beer but like I said, I like my pilsners to have a really spicy hop value to them.  Great summer session brew.  It is nice to see a brewery that doesn't feel the need to make there summer offering a fake hefe."
"Light gold in hue w/ a sticky, billowy white head.  Very bubbly and effervescent.  Soft, yet spicy, green chlorophyll - like Hallertauer hop nose. Not much else there in aroma.  The hop bitterness is mild, and a subtle floral noble hop flavor is there as well.  Malt flavors are light and are comprised of non - descript graininess.  Although there aren't any outstanding flavors for this brew, it's certainly a thirst quencher.  A bit more hop bitterness and flavor as well as malt backbone would've made this an excellent pils. Good drinkability, but a bit lacking in flavor."
"good refreshing beer and really the only beer from s/n i will regularly purchase.  very smooth"
