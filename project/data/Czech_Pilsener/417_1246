Pleasant grassy hop aroma, not a lot of maltiness on the nose. Flavor is very good, with more hop bitterness than expected. Good balance and a nice dry finish. Mouthfeel is great for the style: carbonation is perfect, appropriate viscosity, leaves a very nice flavor in the mouth. Overall this is a pretty great domestic pils. Very drinkable, free of off flavors. I would definitely get this one again.","TCbrewz","Mar 31, 2012"
3.41,-5.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D/O: This Bavarian-style pilsner is a rare flower bomb. Although it isn't a beer that seems likely to shock, it manages to catch the palate completely off-guard with the emphasis it places upon floral tincture. The quality is nothing like the airy and dilute floral of Cascade hops, yet it stops short of tasting artificial. It is hard to predict how such a beer would be received by drinkers.","beagle75","Mar 30, 2012"

4.52,24.9,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Straw yellow color with a touch of gold, but the appearance is about the only thing average about this beer. Smells clean and fresh with light lemony hops and rich biscuity notes. Tastes exceptionally good. My favorite US produced Pils is generally Trumer Pils, and I give Schell's a better score. Trumer seems a bit thin and weak in comparison. This is rich with great grain flavors, lemony biscuit flavors, minty, with (what should be if it's not...) an award winning clean dry hops finish which is why I like Pilsner beer so much in the first place. The 5.0 score goes to the mouthfeel: just incredible carbonation; spiky at first and expanding until it thins on the swallow. Perfect weight for this style, not too thin or thick. I can't see any lover of great Pilsner beer not going absolutely crazy for this beer.","MNJR","Dec 29, 2011"

3.28,-9.4,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,""Schell's Pils" says the bottle. Clear, pale yellow, with a bumpy head that dissipates into a thin bubbly islands. Smells of cereal grains and noble hops hit me on the first pour, which kind of got me excited about drinking this beer, but as I dig into it, I have trouble finding that floral-cracker connection again. Not a ton going on in the glass. I could tell this is a bit high abv for the style. Not that I am a stickler for such guidelines, but the higher abv does nothing for the beer other than to mask the delicate pilsner malt. I can taste the hops just fine, a nice clean bitterness to go with the warm alcohol. I still get some floral notes from the post-sip lingerings. Not a bad drinker overall.","dnrobert24","Jul 21, 2011"

Also notes of lemon or citrus. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was right. I didnt care for the bitter aftertaste.

A big head of white quickly faded but was replaced by a broken crown that clung to the sides of the glass. Aroma is light grain and hay, a touch of light piney hops as it warms, but nothing really bowling me over here. As you take a sip, it is very clean, very crisp, but does not have a terribly great depth of flavor. Light grain note, light bittering hops in the finish, but the flavor is fleeting and leaves the mouth dry and looking for a sip of something else very quickly. Most likely the reason this one went by soo quickly.","mikesgroove","Apr 22, 2011"

Forms fine speckled lacing down the sides of my glass. Aroma has a bit of sulfur going on with, lemongrss/herbal and a bready pale malt breadiness with hints of mineral water. Flavor citric/lemongrass hops actually not bad at all, not strictly German style but it's got a craft brewing approach. Harsh bitterness is a bit lingering, compared to a classic clean pils.

3.76,3.9,4,3,4,3,4.5,"Measured pour into a antique 7 oz pilsener glass produces a white, fairly rocky head of medium duration. Lacing is minimal. Color is a pale golden/straw, and clear to brilliant. Nose is straightforward, dominated by pale and pilsener malts, dry, and fairly non-expressive. Dry and crisp from the outset, with a mildly fruity middle and a bitter/astringent finish. Malty yet anything but sweet, as theres a great balance here thanks to ample hop bitterness. Not sour, but has notes of a sour fruit (rhubarb) in addition to very minor hints of green apple or crap apple. Mouthfeel is rather full but not heavy, and it is certainly not full-bodied but moderate. Drinks lighter than 5.5%, seems about 4.5%, so it might be worth keeping in mind while sessioning this - it's quite sessionable! I know that the recipe was tweaked about a year back, supposedly to yield a drier rendition of a Pils, and in this respect I think theyve succeeded without sacrificing any of the brews original character or drinkability. Some honey notes in the aromatics, and some great malt character overall, along with a notable degree of lingering bitterness. Sampled from a fresh bottle, just over a month old.","Chaz","Jan 18, 2007"

I'm guessing that the beer they serve there is at the perfect maturation stage ane well cared for - the sterling hops were just amazingly fresh, and the malt was crisp with a light sweet distinct graininess. I could have sipped this beer all day.","pweis909","Feb 10, 2006"
3.51,-3,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"This pilsner pours a light golden to dark straw color with a minimal amount of foam. I think I can detect a faint flowery, hoppy aroma. The sweet malt flavor is up front with a sort of bubble gum-fruity middle and a light bitterness in the finish. I first tried this beer about a dozen years ago and I remember it as a spicier (hoppy) pilsner. This is still a decent pilsner, but its doesn't seem as magical as I remmeber it being. Perhaps my palate has changed, but maybe the beer has changed, too. It's still a pretty refreshing pilsner and worth trying, but as a German pilsner it comes up a bit short.","marcobrau","Feb 07, 2006"

Bready, floral aroma. Mouthfeel is substantial, and helps define the sharp, tangy bite; hoppy and crisp like the springy pep of fresh salad greens. Sort of a gluey finish to an otherwise grand experience.","hylton44","Jan 29, 2006"

Poured out to a slightly cloudy golden color with medium low carbonation. Nice head, came down to about 1/8 of an inch. No lacing noted in the glass. Odors of citrus and hops are well balanced. Taste is direct and straightforward. Hops, malt, some citrus acidity, and a good smooth bitterness. Finished crisp with some minor malt aftertaste. High drinkability. If this was readily available, i'd keep some on hand. Recommended.","Frozensoul327","Sep 11, 2005"
2.05,-43.4,2,2,2.5,1.5,1.5,"Pours a cloudy pale straw color with no head. Last time I checked pilsners weren't supposed to be cloudy. I have a felling this might foreshadow whats to come. The aroma is exacly like that of every other Schell product. Thin and vaguely sweet. The taste is as thin as the smell. It is much too sweet for a pilsner. The mouthfeel lacks any sort of crispness. Overall, beer is a big disappointment. For a brewery that prides itself on its German heritage, I would think that making a quality pilsner would be a must. I guess not.","KarlHungus","Aug 17, 2005"

3.99,10.2,3,4,4,4.5,4,"This beer is hazy gold with lots of carbonation and a medium-sized, white, foamy, most-diminishing head. The smell is that of citrus, malts, butter, grass and grain. The taste is more malty than expected, but still nicely balanced. Theres a nice mild initial bitterness that gives way to the malt sweetness before switching back to a dry bitterness on the finish. It has a thin-medium body, watery texture, and lively carbonation. This one was very nicely done. Nothing spectacular here, but a good well-rounded pilsner.","ski271","Apr 17, 2005"

It had weird aromas that one might expect from a adjunct lager. That sickly corn smell. I did not expect that from a so-called German Pilsener. The flavor was even worse IMHO... It reminds me more of a can of beast that a glass of Pilsener.","RushLimbmalt","Feb 20, 2005"

Nice easy going mixture of hops and grains provide a smoothness in the beer. Unfortunately, it wasn't too crisp, likely from the lack of carbonation.

I really like the balance of dryness and malt smoothness in the flavor, and that it's there from front to back, then leaving a gradually fading dry finish. The mouthfeel may be too much for some, I describe it as a rich beer, but its of no bother to me. A good beer for virtually anytime, as well as a nice beer to start novices into the world of interesting beers.","garymuchow","Feb 02, 2002"
