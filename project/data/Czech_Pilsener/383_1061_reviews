"O:  very nice.  Sharp corners on a true Old World style in that it isn't overly Americanized.  the sweetness is not full on bread malt, but the grassy hop bite is also restrained nicely, so it's really solid.  Live Oak is becoming world-craftbeer-wide famous for it's hefeweizen, but this pils is no slouch at all.  fantastic beer."

"I'll dispense with formal descriptions of the perfect colored hay. This is really is an outstanding pilsner, perfect for the horrible heat in Austin. Great hops, smooth with no drops or interruptions to the grassy undertones. It is worth chasing down, really."

"This is quite easy drinking, before I know it the beer is gone; this is an awesome Pilsener that I would love to drink a lot of. It might even be better than HefeWeizen from the same brewery, though I would need to be in right mood to consume this beer (though I don’t see that of being much of an issue)."

"This is excellent. Imagine if this was your first exposure to a pilsner and then you tried the BMC versions of it… instead, for me at least, my experience has been the opposite: drinking the fizzy swill then finding out that beer has flavor. More, more, more please."

"Taste shows plenty of bitterness. Not an abundance of hop flavor and it does have a decent malt backing. Its kind of an earthy pilsner with the malts not just grainy and all two-row. Nice and fresh with a full body. Good brew, one of the best pilsners in Texas."
"Growler shared at the July Santa Cruz tasting. Pours clear light gold with a puffy white head. Pale malts and a light Saaz hoppiness in the nose. Flavor is fresh grains with a crackery finish and a substantial bitterness that lingers in the finish. Dry and refreshing."
"Overall: This is a great interpretation of a German style pils, in fact better than many of the German pils I’ve had in the past in Germany. It’s clean and refreshing and perfect for the summer. Easily in my top two for the style."
"The beer is light orange, with 1/2"" head and lasting retention. The aroma is really nice, bringing a healthy dose of pils malt. The flavor is malt forward, and lacks the Noble hop presence of a beer like Prima Pils. I actually prefer less of a hop presence / finish in a pilsener. The carbonation level is spot on. The growler packaging job was superb, and this was fresh tasting and full of zesty carbonation. The finish was quite dry, which I rather liked. Overall, a solid example of the style. I am very glad to have tried this, and I would certainly enjoy having it again."
"o - Overall a pretty nice pils from Live Oak. Worth checking out if you like pilseners."
"Beer is thin, bright and wet with an oddly bitter finish. The bitterness tastes like it comes from some noble hop variety but it is hard to pin down. The overall beer is quite good, very refreshing and a great pilsner. I'd have it again."
"Pours a clear gold color with a fizzy white head that leaves behind some average spotty lacing. The nose carries a heavy malt presence comprised of straw and grain. Also some light herbal and floral hops. The flavor is quite grainy and straw-like without much hop presence. There's also just a touch of sweetness. Light bitterness on a light body with average carbonation. Somewhat-dry finish. A solid beer, but a bit too grainy and not complex enough for my tastes. Would like to have seen a bit more noble hop character."
"This is a great casual drinking beer and another victory for Live Oak."
"Clear gold with a shirt white cap. Nice lacing and good head retention. Intense noble hop aroma, grassy, floral, and spicy, with a little bit of grainy malt in the background. Solid bitterness from start to finish, mild cereal sweetness with plen more floral and spicy hop character. It had more body than I expected for a pils, a little more richness, but the texture was smooth and carbonation was soft, making for a very easy to drink beer. I quite enjoyed this beer and could see it becoming a staple if it was available in my area."
"Clear gold body half finger white head full pour, multiple streams of lazy rising carbonation. Classic pilsener nose, quite floral, some breadiness and noble hops, not much sweetness. Taste mirrors nose, though once again not very sweet. Medium mouthfeel, clean, with little effervescence. Drinkable but hardly memorable. While it has a similar grade, not in the same league of Moonlight or Victory. Worth a try, however."
"On tap, the beer is a clear darkish golden color with a white sticky head. Pale bready malt and grassy hops emerge from the aroma. A dash of spice is mixed in. The flavors are similar to aroma. The pale malt is nicely balanced by the grassy hops at the end. The beer is smooth as it goes down and very thirst quenching. I really enjoyed this brew."
"A good domestic take on a Bohemian Pilsner, though not in the same league as Moonlight's Reality Czeck, for example."
"On-tap at the Gingerman. The body is just a touch thicker than most of the Czech pilsners but this lager does a great job of amplifying the Nobel hops without going over the top. There's a tasty lemon-herb hop character backed by mellow white bread malt to make this both satisfying."
"FourthBeer potential: BELOW AVERAGE. I wasn't quite a fan of this one, but I guess it's because non-IPA bitter beers seem a little off to me. Still a decent, drinkable brew, but too much kick relative to other pilsners."
"D - a little strong, and not real easy to drink, I won't be seeking this one out again in the future."
"M/D - medium light body. Exceptionally drinkable and flavorful. Excellent pilsner beer."
"On tap at the Ginger Man in Austin. Slightly cloudy, flavor is a nice combination of malt, hop spice, and the mineral flavors I enjoy from a pilsner. highly drinkable, I could definitely enjoy several of these. Medium bodied, with a smell that reminds me of noble hops."
"Overall I thought this was a crisp and well done beverage. Worth a shot if you see it on."
"Drinkability: A great example of a Czech Pilz here in the states. If you are ready to graduate to a full-flavored beer from the hum-drum american macro brews, this is a good place to start. I know the Live Oak guys really pride themselves on this brew."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma is pilsner malt with some spicy hop character. The flavor is more of the pilsner malt as well as grassy and peppery/spicy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D - Over all this is a pretty good pilsener didn't quite live up to the local hype but its still a good beer for hot Texas days if you like pilseners its worth a try"
"A good finger's worth of bone-white head with excellent retention. Nose was pungent with fresh-mown grass (read Saaz hops). Color was a medium-amber with NE-quality clarity. Mouthfeel was medium with a solid Saaz bite on the tongue. Finish was light, dry, satisfying. Pilsner as pilsner should be! 5's!"
"this was on mishap of the bar i had it at. when fresh this beer is quite nice. crisp with a good refreshing hop... not as hoppy as some americans and not as floral... but quite a nice mint... grass. peppermint crisp and a poor protein starch malt. but absolutely not in the foreground to the malt character. just one dimensional finish... not much fruit. straw bitter. hay."
"Another great beer from Live Oak and an awesome Pilz. A near perfect example of a lager. One of my favorites, not just in Texas, but anywhere."
"D: Pretty solid session beer, I really enjoyed it and will have to keep an eye out for it from now on."
"D: Very much so. This, if you are into such a thing, is a beer worth pounding."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" white head over the slightly cloudy golden brew. Head recedes gradually, with a solid coating of lace. Aroma is spicy hops. Taste is pale sweet upfront, lots of spicy Saaz in the middle, which just keeps on keeping on through the close. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, with the biting hops keeping it interesting, and drinkability is great. Go find some, you won't be sorry."
"Very drinkable and definitely a session beer. A nice pilsner, but not on par with Victory Prima or Stoudts."
"Very good. This Live Oak place seems like quite the joint."
"I've been searching high and low lo 10+ years to find a replacement for my favorite, and now defunct, Pils and I've found a worthy substitute. And, in all places, Texas! I'd written off anything brewed in Tejas until I had this beer. Here's to hoping my second encounter will equal the first! Truly a World Class Pilsener! Bob SNOB from Washington / Portland"
"Wonderful golden yellow colour with a strong head that's leaving not just lacing but a coat of head on the inside of the glass. The nose is a bit doughy but don't let that deter you - this is a crisp, hoppy, refreshing pilsener. Good body and carbonation. Very dry, bitter finish. A fine beer."
"Pours a clear yellow colored body, with a white colored head, lastingish. Has some aroma, but not very much. Some grain maybe, it's hard to tell. Bitter taste, with some malt, watery palate."
"A quiet shining star from the live oak brewery..."
"Had this pilsner on tap at Live Oak Brewery in East Austin. Served in a plastic pint glass. Has a golden appearance with a frothy white head. Smells like hop heaven with an abundance of floral notes. Made with mostly czech ingredients -- Hops from bohemia, barley from moravia -- this is as czech as you can get in Texas. Hop bitterness up front balances well with the bready finish, a very straightforward lager. This is my idea of a czech pilsner: slightly malty, very bitter."
"Had this on tap at Opal Divines in Austin along with Sunday brunch. Pours almost pure gold with a pure white head. Had a very thick lacing which stayed throughout the life of the drink. Tasted of big hops and spice with a perfect unmistakable pis crispness. Was really surprised at the hop bite on this one. Behind all of that there was some grain, yeasts, spice and grass. The lacing was thick throughout. There was a quick burst of bubbles on a shake, displaying the high carbonation of the beer. Excellent and tasty pils, and like no other I've had before."
"D - this is a highly drinkable beer as most of the Live Oak offerings tend to be."
"Pretty nice golden color with a smallish white head on tap. Heavy, doughy, musty yeasty smelling It smells strongly of mushy yeast and dough which isn't my favorite as the style goes, but still okay. As far as the taste, it is a lightly bitter bite, with a smooth finish. I didn't find this refreshing like some pilsners but rather, gooey and thicker from the heavily yeasty smell present in the nose, and also somewhat present in the taste. If you like heavy yeast flavor this is a great pilsner for you. I still prefer Live Oak's other beers to this, I'd say."
"Not a whole lot going on, but really good."
"D - Good drinkability, very refreshing and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Eminently drinkable - one of the better domestic pilsners I have tasted; not as big and bitter as Victory but easier to drink because of the floral elements"
"This is my second favorite LO beer and probably one of my favorite Pilseners of all time (better than any bottled import I've tried; not as hoppy as a Victory Prima, but still a real craft beer). Can drink this stuff like it was made from water!"
"Hands down my favorite pilsner. While I am a fan of the ""big beers," this is the pilsner with the most taste I've ever had. Has some that green bottle skunky taste like a true Czech pilsner but much more more fresh and tasty (only coming from a few miles away). Grassy, floral, some peppered grain, slightly hoppier than most, authentic ingredients...I could easily drink 2 pitchers of this in a night. Highly recommended to get a keg of. If you're ever in Austin or Texas, definitely try all of the Live Oaks. If only they bottled and had greater marketing and distribution..."
"As I said above, this is a great Czech Pilsner. If you like a highly hopped brew with some good balance, this is your brew. One of my faves brewed right here in Austin!"
"Pours a pale golden amber color with a bright white head that has a nice retention. Nose is dominated by floral grassy hops but some fruity malt is detectable in the background. Taste mimics the aroma with spicy citrusy hops being the key players while kept in check by a solid malt backbone. A very hearty and thoroughly enjoyable Pils."
"A very solid Pilsner."
"A solid mouth with great carbonation make this one an easy drinker. Nice beer here folks!"
"Draft at the Flying Saucer in San Antonio. They were out of the O'fest so I opted for the Pilz."
"I wouldnt classify this as a session lager but is good for when you want to slow things down a bit."
"Live Oak Pilz is a very good beer, but not something that gets me really excited. I'm pretty sure this is my first Czech pilsener, so I can't compare to anything. Appearance is a nice golden color, maybe a little hazy. Head is an average one-finger. Smell is a mix of mild piney hops and citrus. Wasn't quite expecting the pineyness. Taste is much like the smell, starts with mild pine hops and ends with a lemony zing. Fairly complex, but not too exciting. I usually like beers a little more malty. Drinkability is pretty good, this seems like the kind of beer that gets better after you get used to it after a couple pints. By the way, Live Oak beers are only available on-tap in central Texas, and in a few places in Houston."
"Notes: This is one tasty brew that will slap you silly (in a good way) when you expect the traditional style. If I had a way to get growlers of this and/or their hefe, it would be a staple in my fridge! Cheers!"
"Overall Impression: A very solid brew. If I hadn’t been traveling I could see making a session of it. Very happy to see a Texas brewery putting out such a fine product. If you are in the area, do try a sample."
"MJ brought along a of keg of this for his tasting at the 3-22-03 event. Sweet musty nose. Not much of a persistant head.. slight white ring of fine foam in the glass. Gold color to the brew in the glass. Upon first sample you really note the balenced bitterness. The bitterness is there but the malt spine really stands up to it. Smooth mouth with a medium body. Crisp, bitter hop finish to the taste and tongue. Quite drinkable. There is also a very slight smoke (oak?) finish to the beer as well. A nice pilzzzzzzz."
