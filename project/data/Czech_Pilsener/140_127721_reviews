"Overall: Better as it warms.  Extremely light & floral.  Would not buy a sixer of this."

"3.71/5.00"
"I Pop!ped the cap and commenced a slow, steady pour so as to not rouse any lees that may have settled onto the punt during my bottle's stint in my reefer. Naturally, this did not allow for the formation of any head, so I again employed the bartender's trick and wound up with a finger of foamy, bone-white head that quickly fell, leaving some nice lacing in its wake. Color was Yellow (SRM = 4) with NE-quality clarity. Nose reminded me more of a German Pilsner with its biscuity malt presence alongside of the  hops. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was definitely hop-forward with a grassy, lemony flavor accompanied by the biscuit maltiness to add up to something that reminded me of lemon biscotti. Mmmm. I had one of these on draft this past summer and I remember it being highly refreshing. I really enjoy crisp, clean Czech Pilsners on hot summer days and this really fit the bill that time. Finish was dry, clean and highly refreshing. Last pour: cloudy, malt more pronounced, still quite dry."
"This is one of the very finest Czech style pilseners I've ever had.  It's an exceptional example of the style, up there with my other favorite pils (Mama's Little Yella, Lagunitas, Blue paddle, Summit).  I would buy cases and cases of this and have it as a staple in my fridge if it were available in my area."
"Good collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Firestone. Taste crisp and fresh."
""
""
"Pours a straw yellow character with some tiny suspended particles present. Bottle conditioned? Smells of floral hops with nice sweet grainy pils malt. Some underlying fruitiness like strawberries. Clean Pilsner tastes with crisp bitter finish. Very clean tasting. Light and very drinkable. Nicely done beer. Not a standout in last summer's beer camp variety case, but a very well executed beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
"Wasn't enough flavor in it for me."
"Taste-Crisp, pale malt, floral fruity hops, hint of lemon. Overall nice hop bite, crisp and refreshing."
"I expected a more hoppy beer. Still a good beer."
""
"This is interesting.  It smells like heaven, but it's really hoppy and bitter.  Not a great take on a Pils, but an interesting experience."
"Carries the touch of both breweries. It's easy drinking and subtle. Hops give it a little life and work well with the yeast."
"Tastes of a wheat bread kind of sweetness up front, with lemon, flowers, dry grass, hay, cracked wheat, pine cone, tea leaf, earthy notes, metallic hints like copper, and hoppy spices that produce a mild bitterness and dry your mouth. It seems very grainy at moments but then cuts back to citrus or grassy spices and is quite easy to drink with a lot of muted flavors that seem so interconnected that you can’t differentiate them. Easy to drink, it was light and crisp but not as hoppy as I expected yet still a real nice pilsner with above average flavor for the style."
""
"Figures. This is probably the all-around best thing I've had from the Beer Camp mix pack. Hoppy lagers are becoming quite popular (which is a fun trend), but hoppy iterations of Czech pils have not caught on. Yet."
""
""
"Pretty good... very light in color almost like a white ale... good smell, it's a hoppy pilsner... interesting spin and not bad."

"11/23...BCAA 6/12...pours bright gold, see through, foamy layer atop. Fruity citrus nose, floral too. Clean hop forward flavor, good body, earthy bitter hop back. Bright and gritty together. Lemon pops out. Very good."
"O - The pilsner style is pretty low on my beer pecking order, but add some tasty floral hops into the equation and I dig it.  Very good"
""
"O:  My last of the Beer Camp box.  I was a bit hesitant to try this for the hop content.  But it was pleasantly tasty.  A great summer beer that can be enjoyed any time."

"O- Nearly right on for all attributes for a Czech Pils"
""

"Just very meh. It's very average, nothing great, nothing terrible. I would expect much more from a Firestone Walker/SN beer."

"Enjoyable."
"Poured into a pint glass. Hazy straw color, with one finger of fluffy white head. Aroma was grassy, with a bit of grainy, wheaty smell. Taste was light malt up front with a nice noble hop bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel was light, with some nice carbonation that combined with the hop bitterness to give it a really nice mouthfeel. Overall, a nice pilsner."
""
""
""
"3.79 | 85 | B+"
""
"Overall, a very good pils."
""
""
""
"Overall not bad actually, better than I expected, especially from the average. Nice pilsner with good hoppy notes, mostly noble like, but not much for New Zealand. Then again kiwi hops started from German/Euro noble hops that did their own awesome thing in New Zealand, so I could see all the noble characters in there. Pretty enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Long dry mildly bitter finish. Crisp and refreshing. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Well done American West Coast Pils. Some fruitiness in the hop finish."
""
"Overall:  Pretty solid pilsner.   Traditional to the style with a little NZ hop twist.  Very enjoyable and I wish there was more.  This beer should be year round too or St least during the warmer months."
""
""
""
"O- The collaborators did a great job at not diluting the style too much. Just a change in hops, and there is a different character. But still, the flavor and overall beer comes out to be a nice pilsner."
""
""
""
""
"The nose starts with light grain seasoned with spicy hops and made more interesting with suggestions of white wine. It pours bright straw under a 2” bone white head that dissipates to a thick film. Some hop spice on the nose and some suggestions of white wine. The pilsner grainy palate shows off the hop artistry with light tropical fruit, faint white wine, and a very pleasant hop bitterness especially in the finish. Torpedo pilsner is a very well rounded beer with no rough edges that finishes crisp and lightly malty with subtle tropical fruit aftertaste."
"Pours a golden yellow with a medium lasting white fluffy head, moderate lacing. Aroma is sweet fruity, citrus and mild floral notes, grains. Taste same as aroma with some notes of yeast and mild hops bitterness. a medium bodied brew with moderate carbonation, fairly smooth going down. Finish is mildly dry, sweet fruity notes of citrus mild lemon, grains, yeast and mild bitterness. Overall a good summer time brew, refreshing and good."

"A bit late on these... I know. 1 and 1/2 fingers of white head with decent retention. Beautiful golden hue. Very light on the nose. Maybe a slightly grassy hop note in there. Nice balance to the taste, but it was definitely super light on big craft flavor. Maybe it's a pilsner thing... light, refreshing on the palate. Overall, this was clean and light. Obviously would have liked one SUPER fresh, but these are the cards we are dealt in b:@# f$%^ Pennsylvania. I really do get some damn fresh Great Lakes and Fat Heads around here so no complaints! I have a very limited FW experience, and this will not sour it at all. Looking forward to (maybe fresher) Beer Camp 2015!"

"Overall it was a delicious brew.  Not sure where the spice was coming from but made it interesting!"

""
""
""
""
"O: a little too sulfuric for me;"
""
""
"O - Pretty solid, but nothing spectacular. Interesting mix of an IPA and a Pilsner.  If you like grassy beers, this might be the beer for you."
""

""
""
"O:  I'm not a huge pilsner drinker, but after this, I should reconsider.  Perfectly balanced.  Great beer."
""
""
""
"O: It might not be one of my favorite styles, but a well done brew none the less."
""
""
""
"D:   A really great Pils that is super hoppy and crisply refreshing but not all that much of a deviation from the regular Pivo Pils in my opinion.  I think the regular Pivo is a touch more refined and I would likely lean that way but this is still great.  Just would have liked to have seen a Double Torpedo or Blindfolded Wookey here perhaps."

"pours a slightly cloudy pale yellow color, with big rocky bright white colored head.  good lacing.  aroma is not so much hoppy, but earthy, a little grassy.  clean taste - just a touch of grainy malt and mild hop aftertaste.  good balance, easy drinking.  medium body, medium to high carbonation, appropriate for the style."
""
""
"Pale golden body with a finger of white head. Bready aroma, yeast, pils malt, floral notes, a touch of citrus, pepper. Average flavor, following the aroma. A bit unbalanced. Lacking the drinkability and ease of the upper tier pilsners."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I'm not a consumer of many pilsners but this one was quite good and fit the style well. Definitely expected more hop character. Though the slight hop bite made this beer jump up from ""Meh"" to ""Decent""."

"O-nice crisp summer pilsener, easy drinking"

""

""

"was hoping for more of a hop palate, but over all it was good. more citrusy then expected"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hmm, I really wish I knew which NZ hop varietals were used in this brew. I get a lot of grassy, spicy hop notes and substantial bitterness but not much fruity and floral notes mentioned on the bottle. Overall it is a well made Pilsner but perhaps I had too many expectations from the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear bright yellow color pilsner with a nice white foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light citrus hops with some pungent notes is refreshing. Taste is dominated by some refreshing pungent hops with some light citrus notes with clean cereal notes from the malt backbone. Body is about average with good carbonation. Interesting take on the pilsner style but hops presence is not as dominant as advertised."
"This was good, but I don't think I would want it again.  A bit too tanic for it to be a go to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, not the best but not the worst.  Given the mildness of the smell, taste, and ABV...I could probably crush a six pack and not even notice."
""
"Overall: Solid beer overall. Not as good as I expected from Firestone Walker and Sierra Nevada, but still worth trying."
"Overall: Interesting.  That is Minnesotan for I didn't like it, but am too nice to say so outright.  The sulfur and bitterness is just too much for me.  Not well balanced for a pilsner and not crisp enough.  The worst of the Beer Camp box so far."
""
"Crisp from start to finish and very refreshing. Very easy to consume."
"i think it is a good pilsner"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A very nice pilsener, hoppy and thus fruity as advertised.  Could easily pass for someone's exceptional Summer brew,  This is the third or fourth collab I have tried from the BCAA pack so far and they have all been good if a bit unusual."
"A very nice malty Pilsner (45 IBU) that has a bright start on the tongue and as the name suggest a blast of hops just as it begins to finish.  The hops do not linger to long giving this wonderful offering the job of thirst quencher to bad there's only two of them in my case because this would be a great beer for summer fun."

"I thought this one was pretty good, not sure why so many low reviews. Its not as good as an authentic pilsner but its close. Beer is extremely clear and light with a nice Czech hoppiness to it. Finish is a little harsh but not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pilsner generally gets a bad wrap as a craft beer style and certainly isn't my favorite but the guys at Sierra really hit this one on the head. That funky smell you get from a fresh traditional German pils is apparent. Great balance even for being classified as a ""hoppy"" Pilsner by the brewers. Clean and refreshing; sessionable. That said, there's a level of excellence this one doesn't rise to. Maybe it's the stigma of the style but this one gets only a B+ from me. Decidedly above average but no real wow factor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent Bohemian pilsner. Wonderful body and mouthfeel. Hops were so spot on. Felt like I was back Europe drinking glasses of fresh hoppy bitter Pils. Agree with DIM. Stand out Beer Camp beer. This needs to be made again as a regular beer. Very well done!"

"Hoppy aromas of pithy citrus, wet hay, and a touch of something floral. Big hop presence. Crackers and biscuits shined through as well. Tastes every bit as good as it smells. Slightly resinous, bitter citrus punctuated by earthy grass and flowers. Malt balance in the form of mineral-y biscuits and oyster crackers. Bone dry bitter finish. We ith 3 to go this is the best of Beer Camp so far."
""
"Taste is brightly carbonated and clean yet thin in body.  Perhaps over attenuated in nature.  Warming reveals more lemony hops and a touch of spice on the aroma yet misses the mark a bit as for flavor.  Intriguing and hoppy nonetheless.  Spicy feel is okay but drinkability is questionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Cool take on the style, new world hops worked really well with this new world style. (4.15)"
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is snappy and crisp with a light yet firm hop bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste. Crackery malt, light grassy hop taste. Light feel, easy drinking. Overall well put together, something I'd drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really enjoy a west coast style pilsner, so I was excited to sample this.  Overall, I enjoyed it.  Nice combo of pilsner body with aroma and flavor hops turned up to 11.  My favorite from the Beer Camp collection."
"A decent and refreshing beer, but among the least impressive, to me, from the Beer Camp series."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Probably decent for the style, but again not my favorite style and I don't care for the funk"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very enjoyable.  It's extremely hoppy for a Czech Pilsner up front, but I appreciate that it retains the characteristics of the style in the finish."
""
"This is a light bodied offering that is modestly carbonated. It is crisp and easy drinking. I would have liked to felt more of that notorious new zealond hop profile in this...but even without it, this was quite enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A fairly nice tasting pale ale that had a good hop blend and a more moderate dryness and drinkability. In my opinion, a higher carbonation would have really heightened the beer overall and would have made it much more appropriate for style, but overall this is a rather nice pale ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty good twist on a Pilsner. Good upfront kick of floral and juicy hops with a solid Pils malt backing."

"O - nice take on a classic style. Nothing extraordinary here, but it is well crafted. Happy to try it."
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice pilsner base that incorporates the extra hops nicely. Doesn't go overboard on the bitterness, which makes it very easy to drink. Solid part of the 12-pack"
""
""
""
"Pours a light straw yellow, white soapy head laces the glass well. The aroma is hoppy, with wet, noble style hops coming off very tea like, pungent and herbal. In the taste, bread, cracker and high alpha, zesty New Zealand hops, giving of distinct flavor just like the aroma. Fair bitterness but just very fresh tasting. Clean and crisp, lighter body with high carbonation. Overall, a pretty good Pils with distinct hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The hops are a nice addition to an otherwise well-made pilsner"
"O. Solid, nothing more. It's stymied by a slightly honey sweet feel, when I really like more of a floral, dry, bitterness to my pilsners. Still, it's fairly good, if unremarkable."
""
"This beer wasn't at all what I expected it to be. Its still solid. However, it isn't exactly my style. I get notes of floral hops and a sweet malty taste with very slight notes of citrus and pepper. The balance of this beer confuses me a little because I feel like I am hit with flavors randomly instead of it having an overall structure. All together, its still a good beer. I almost wish I had another one just to take more time to understand it more."
""
""
""
"Taste is classic pilsner only in your face and intense like Billy Mays, however not annoying. A crisp hop floral bite gives way to clean grain biscuity malt flavor with a dry herbal bitter finish. This is a seriously pumped pilsner."

"Served in a Pilsner glass"

"This torpedo pilsner has followed the general suit of the rest of the beers in the beer camp set. As I have found these are all solid beers, this hoppy pilsner is as exactly as described. The nose has some medium floral notes not much of malt can be found here. Appearance was of a clear dark golden color, and was consumed directly from the bottle so lacing and finer details were lost upon me. Mouth feel was excellent and light with plenty of carbonation. The taste of this beer came with a nice bite up front from the generous hops, and faded quickly to a light sweet malty note that failed to linger long enough for my tastes. Overall this a good beer and if offered in six packs I would happily take upon the chance to partake."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A hoppy Pilsner that is easily drinkable and quite flavorful."

"The body was mostly crisp, but did have a slightly sticky-sweet finish. Drinkability was very good, the bottle was gone in a few quick gulps. Overall, while a very nice brew, it's not one I would grab over the multitude of other fine Pilseners out there these days. Certainly worth trying though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the simpler additions to the Beer Camp 12-pack. But it proves that simplicity goes a long way. I'd love to sit on a porch and crush four or five of these while the sun sets."
""
"The flavor is very mild up front with slight spice and mild grass with light herbal and lemony hop flavors with secondary malt in the taste addinga bit of sweetness to create a near perfect level of balance with light yeast in the semi-dry and gently bitter finish. This is a top notch pilsner ...it seems more German than Czech based on the hop flavors which are less spicy-an excellent first taste from the Beer Camp case and enjoyable lager"
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was zesty with plenty of carbonation. Medium bodied."
"Overall, a good beer, but not one I would likely seek out again. I have to be honest, when it comes to beers in the pils style, I'd just assume go a bit more traditional, where that clean and crisp malt profile can shine. If I want lots of hops, I'm more than happy to reach for an IPA or similar beer."
""
"D: I think this is another solid brew from the variety pack. really hoppy, yet remaining a true pils. a sort of American/new Zealand pils, but I still like it. not sure where this will end up in my final rankings, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were up there."
"Overall, really nice beer, with some really great flavors! Haven't had many pilsners, but this one makes me eager to try more!"
"D - A very respectable lager and introduction to this year's Beer Camp Across America, but nothing remarkable either... A unique color and assertive aroma highlight this offering... The flavor profile and mouthfeel are average to solidly above average... The end result is an enjoyable offering, though I'm hoping for a bit more for the rest of the beers in the collection..."

"Pours slightly yellow/golden color with half finger width foamy head. Head retention is mild. There is very little to no lacing on the side of the glass. Has an apple aroma with a funky, lager malt I usually get from lagers. Malty taste up front with a grassy hop bitterness to follow. Slightly bitter aftertaste - slightly funky. Difficult to discern any particular flavors to the malt. Overall it is a good beer for a lager, it is just not my style."
""
""
"A pretty good Pilsner. Not a style I would pick for a collaboration between Firestone-Walker and Sierra Nevada, but not a bad beer either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as hopped up as promised but still a very enjoyable Pilsner."
""
""
""
"O - really like this style of hopped up pilsner. easy drinking but with some more flavor than most pilsners. reminds me of prima pils from victory. i like this hoppy pils much more than firestones pivo pils."
""
""
""
""
"O: a good enough beer, but not maybe as good a pilsener - lacked some of the crisp lean tightness, the brisk quality that I've found in other pilseners"
""
"Shared with my buddy out of a sierra mascara and a fw tulip. brew pours a murky golden with streaky lacing. Nose is a hoppy pilsner, really nice. Taste to match. Super easy drinking and well executed. Really wish I could've tried this one fresher, but really dug it."
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed the aromas and flavors of grassy hops in this pilsener. The dominance of the hops is similar to what you see in IPLs."

""
""
""

""

""

"O - Overall, not bad but I would challenge the hoppy pilsner description a bit. Hops are there for sure, but this even pales in comparison to a good German pilsner for hop character. Misses the really crisp hop bitterness of a pilsner. Mouthfeel is pretty much right on though for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is sharp and with a definite hop snap, with the New Zealand hops taking this one into a new realm of extra hoppy lagers. A delicious brew, and one I wish I could revisit!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. A good, well balanced, hoppy pilsner, very similar to FW’s Pivo Pils. The New Zealand hops give it a different flavor, in a good way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall this is another solid pilsner for us to enjoy, but for my personal tastes it is just a bit to unbalanced being so hop dominated."
""
""
"Overall, not that great. Would not have this again."
""
""
"This is very well done. So many classic qualities for style and then perfectly hopped. Very impressive."
""
""
""

""
""
"There seem to be 2 entries for this. Hopefully they get merged soon."
"An interesting and well-made light brew that captures the essence of a Pilsner-- unfortunately is goes above and beyond in the West Coast style of too much hops is better. From the 12 oz bottle in the 2014 Beer Camp twelve-pack purchased at Liticker's in Ocean Beach."
"O: a fine Pilsner that excels in many criteria and is a fine brew."
""
""
"O- Of the 4 I've had so far from the 12-pack (Ballast Point, New Glarus, FFF), this is easily the leading contender. Essentially, it's a Czech Pilsner with just a little bit extra kick that is very well-executed and remarkably easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Pours a golden hue that eagerly catches the light in my kitchen. Thick swirls of lace cling to my glass, minimal sleepy head that's easily awakened with a swirl. Lots of bread and citrus in the nose, wonderfully grassy with a thin oily mouthfeel. I'm enjoying watching the bubbles escape from the bottom of my tulip glass. I think folks are missing it on this brew - it's a damn good pils that I'd like to have again."
""
"O: Refreshing, enjoyable, and easy to drink - a really nice Pilsner with a touch of hoppiness. Definitely one that I hope gets brought back again. A big hit with most of the family at dinner tonight."
""
""
"I was expecting a strong hopping, but it isn't the full force I anticipated. A more straightforward pilsner than I would expect as a collaboration brew, but it is still very good."
""
"O: Very well done. To begin with it's a very clean, technically sound pilsner. The New Zealand hops bring some exotic flair, but don't steal the show. Hop flavor and aroma go deeper and get more complex than the average pilsner, but only a little bolder. A great take on a classic style, accented by some exotic hops and Sierra's patented hop torpedo."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was off to a good start, but in the end, it kinda let me down. Still, it was pretty good."
"o: its a hoppy pils, nothing I be seeking out even if it as made again."

"Pours out a rich golden body with a thin head. Smells strongly of herbal, floral hops and crackery, grainy malts. Flavor is very malty: bready, crackery, and honeyed. Hops don't offer excessive bitterness, but they provide lots of floral flavor. Light bitterness and dryness in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. The carbonation is moderate. A great pilsner. Unsurprising as both SN and FW put out great examples. This one is more Summerfest than Pivo."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This really seems to be missing the noble angle, and on top of it the so called fruity and floral New Zealand oomph is nowhere to be found."
""
"Part of the Beer Camp compilation. Collaboration between Sierra Nevada and Firestone Walker. This guy pours light, light, light! This is the needle in the haystack because it would blend perfect with some hay. Not the biggest nose here but those classic pilsner malts come through. After taking a sip, the flavor makes up for the mediocre nose. Crisp, clean pilsner just as it should be, lots of dry hops on the back end. Really tasty, I thoroughly enjoyed this one out of the Beer Camp, maybe the best of the lagers. The fruity New Zealand hops pair so well with that pale lager flavor, a little citrus, a little yeasty, just really well balanced. I would def buy a six pack of this if I could!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is an interesting beer. But while the floral/soapy element isn't necessarily objectively bad, it just doesn't float my particular boat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Easy drinking."
""

"Overall - Nice beer. Nothing to complicated, just a style done really well, that's smooth, low alcohol and easy to enjoy. I would have no problem buying this beer for the summertime when I want a little more kick then a pilsner, but not a ibu monster ipa."

"Overall a decent well crafted beer, the hopping choices really make this beer stand out. They did a great job selecting NZ hops to get a spicey profile in line with noble hops."

"O-My first beer of the variety pack and this one was a hit with me. It's very hoppy but I still equate it to a Pilsner as opposed to the new, trendy India Pale Lager. Firestone nailed their Pivo Pils, so I shouldn't be surprised."

"Sierra Nevada Beer Camp Across America Torpedo Pilsner ---3.5/5"
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent straw color with half an inch of head. Fair amount of lacing. The aroma is grassy and floral hops with some grains and a slight funk. The taste is bready upfront with some funk. Tastes almost like sourdough bread. Floral hops and cut grass. Hints of citrus peel towards the end. Nice amount of bitterness mixed with the crisp malt flavor. Finishes with some floral bitterness. Crisp and easy to drink. Overall, one of the stand outs from the mix pack so far."

"Poured on-tap at a Beer Camp tap takeover, the beer was served in a shaker pint. The beer is a bright, slightly hazed, golden coloring, with a fluffy, clingy, white head. Nose of floral hops, cotton candy, and pine notes. Flavors are extremely fruity, with berry and juniper notes forward, and a grainy backbone. Citrus and resinous hops abound. Light and smooth in mouth, with a fruity, super sweet aftertaste. The finish is smooth and crisp. Solid, easy drinker."

"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Pours a light golden with a translucent clarity and a sizzling, one inch bright white head. Nose is grassy with a suggestion of noble hops. Taste consistent with nose the addition of a sweet and slightly bready quality towards the back. Mouthfeel is light in body with a carbonation that falls just shy of crisp. Overall, a good pils albeit a bit sweet. I'm also not getting much ""intense fruity ... notes"" from the New Zealand hops."

"Finishing crisp, clean and highly refreshed, its bitterness is a welcome reprieve from its floral upstart. A mild detergent-like taste is peculiar but never really interferes with the balance. Its light body is effortless, especially after contending with such relative complexity."

"O - This is a nice hoppy pilsner. Crisp and easy drinking, but nothing mind blowing."
""
"The beer pours a very bubbly white head that dissipates quickly but still leaves a lot of lacing. The beer itself a clear straw yellowish gold. The beer smell is a bit sweet and hoppy. The sweet is more of a sweet and bready malt smell while the hop is a grassy and floral smell. The taste is similar to the smell. Floral notes with a sweet and bready backbone to take a little of the hop edge off. Other than that the beer is not overly complex and a little bit more hop forward than the average pilsner. The mouthfeel is crisp and light bodied but on the heavy side. The beer has biting carbonation but a little heavy when compared to the average pilsner. Overall ,the beer is decent. Firestone's original Pils is much better and just adding hops to something you already feels like they just phoned it in. I'm not saying it's bad but I'm saying that Firestone probably missed a good opportunity to get a little creative."

"o: one of the sweeter pilsner's i've had. its a got a creamy mouthfeel that i'm actually digging. bottle says its hoppy, but i didn't pick up much hops. its an easy drinker that tastes good, but nothing mind-blowing"

"Overall: I love this and expected this to be one of my favorites out of the variety pack. I just wish Sierra Nevada would produce something like this year round. It would be my go to."

"Very light straw, brilliant, lighter than expected. Very floral aroma, and the hop flavoring character comes across more minerally than expected, but hop bitterness definitely dominates. The crackery pilsner malt is light. It's a bit more bitter than I'd prefer."
"O) I'm not a pils guy, but I would drink this again. A nice summer drink and a definite step up from the ones I've tried. A good start to the 12 pack (I've arranged them by ABV)."
""
"A nice easy drinking beer. The appearance was a nice pale orange. The smell was full of hops with floral and grapefruit scents. The taste had all those great hop flavors which were nice and complex, but also had a nice bit of toast and herb to it. The mouthfeel was light but still had a good body to it. I liked it a lot."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 5/29/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of bright lemon zest, mango, white grape, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bright fruity/earthy hops, pale malt, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of bright lemon zest, mango, white grape, peach, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, mango, white grape, pear, apple, cracker, biscuit, light honey, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of bright fruity/earthy hops, pale malt, and yeast ester notes; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Czech pilsner style. Around good balance and robustness of bright fruity/earthy hops, pale malt, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Pours mostly clear, straw color with a very thin, fast dissipating, bright white line of foam. Has both a grassy nose and taste. Mild on most counts with a light floral fragrance and common pils palate of flavor. Good, not great. A lot of friends around the country are all about firestone walker so I haven't given up on my first try. Maybe me and my boy will update after we get through the 2nd 12pk of the beer camp"
""
""
"This beer has not been getting much love, but really for the style, which I had little interest in to begin with. Its not a bad beer. Its good, its not worth the price, if broken down into a 12 pack, but for something different in a mixed 12 pack this beer is not bad. I did enjoy it. I know there are haters out there, but for a style that isn't all that great to begin with this one is better than most."
""
""
""
"Looks like a pilsner. Basically a clear gold. A bit thicker than I would expect for the style. Bready and thick yeast tones with a mildly inky thing in there. Feel is a bit thicker also. Feels like it could use some filtration. Regardless; still a pretty nice pils."

"A - A thoroughly enjoyable pilsner. The West Coast hops are fantastic here - they retain some of the spiciness of a traditional Bohemian pilsner while also adding in some mild citrus and melon notes."
"White foam head over a very pale gold beer. Decent lacing. Good retention. Smell is faintly of biscuit and crackers. There really isn't much there. Taste is mildlybearthy, hay, biscuit and cracker. Decent pilsner. Not really getting the 'intense' New Zealand hops. Body is medium with good carbonation. Quaffable beer. Clean finish. Nothing exciting here."
""
""
"O: This is a great beer and my first out of the Beer Camp Across America pack. I'm following SNBill's drinking order for it. I've heard this is one of the better from the pack, and so far it is a nice little hoppy pilsner, but I wish it was a bit more hop-forward. I guess this might be the closest I get to trying FW's Pivo Pils anytime soon, but I can't wait to try that."
""
""
""
""
"O - If this was a regular, I would drink it frequently. This is on the same plane as Prima Pils and The Crisp. It's hard to call it a german or czech style due to the prominence of both the hops and the malt. It's very well balanced and goes down so, so easily. Very. very well done."
"Overall (4.25): I feel like this beer would be dynamite when it’s fresh. But, eight weeks is about as young as I could have hoped to have tried it, so I’ll take it for what it is—and that’s still pretty damn awesome. I would drink beer like this all the time, if it were more readily available. Crisp, lean, complex, punchy but not aggressive, balanced—it’s just all there. Excellent, and it’d be awesome if this got brewed again and distributed fresh."
""
""
"O: I'll admit I was expecting a pilsner hopped in the American style, but in actuality this is a beer that is more like an over-hopped ""traditional"" pilsner. Not bad, just not what I was expecting."
""

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a light to medium straw amber with a one finger white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma of grassy European hops with floral notes, biscuit malt. Flavor begins with biscuit malt and light floral hops, developing drier, crackery malt with more grassy and floral hops, finishing semi dry with a nice balance of biscuit and grassy, floral hop bitterness. Medium bodied with active carbonation. A very nice take on the pilsner style, covering all the classic flavor notes, but tasting fresher and brighter with the interesting fragrent hop elements. Very nice pilsner."
"O - This is very enjoyable! There is more to the beer than what you get from the nose and first sip. It gets better as you drink it. I could drink this all day while at the beach or on a boat."

"Poured a beautiful cloudy rich golden yellow with two fingers of fluffy white head. A gorgeous looking pilsner. Scents of floral, jasmine, perfume-like hops, a faint touch of tropical fruit and a honey/graham cracker character from the Pils malt. A crisp, clean appealing aroma profile most similar to a German Pilsner, with a bit more fruit character than is common for the style. Flavor begins nicely bitter, with crisp floral hop flavors and a low, yet present, Pils malt sweetness and an extremely faint hint of citrus peel. The middle is dominated by floral hop flavors with a moderate bitterness level and a slight presence of Pils malt sweetness. Finish is dry with floral hop flavors most reminiscent of jasmine with some slight herbal hop character in the background. Aftertaste is floral hops with notes of jasmine with moderate bitterness and a slight hint of graininess. A good German Pilsner flavor, very much balanced towards floral hops with malt present, but not overwhelming at any point in the sip. Mouthfeel is light bodied with moderate-high carbonation and a crisp, drying mouthfeel. Easy to drink. Overall this is a good, easy drinking German Pilsner that brings a well rounded, reasonably dry floral flavor balanced against just enough Pils malt in the flavor combining with a nice aroma and mouthfeel. Not the most daring experiment, but quite good regardless."

"not that different from any other good well hopped pilsener out there, but a very well mad beer, super tasty this one, refreshing, it needs to come in a six pack. for firestone walker, im not all that impressed, its better than pivo i think, but awfully similar in terms of the base and the intensity of the hops, the only real distinction for me was a little more grain sweetness in the middle, and some different hop varietals in the recipe, but other than that, its real close to pivo we all thought. that said, pivo is a remarkable brew, one of the better always available examples of the style, so not complaining here, just a little samey for me. very light body on this one, with very active carbonation, the right feel for this seasonally appropriate brew. hops are more grassy and fresh veggies than they are bitter, but its a nice complexion on the end to balance the pils malt out. nothing special, as with some others in the box, but nothing wrong with it either, not by a mile. this is great pilsener."

"Crystal clear pale gold beer with a big airy head. The nose is ... kinda overthetop hoppiness for a pils. I guess that's the point by naming it ""torpedo"". They tend fresh pineneedle scent. Flavor though, is dead-on pils, though on the far bitter side. Clean malt, and the hops flavor here is about what you expect--floral, maybe just a tad piney. Very dry finish. Interesting, though it wears on you through the whole glass, the bitterness. I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these. Fortunately, this is the only one in the case!"
"Overall - not much of a pilsner fan but like this one better than of course those horrible domestics. This would be a beer that would be good for drinking on hot days."

"Pours a hazy light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, grass, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is refreshing, tasty, and easy to drink."

"O- This pilsner has big hop character but it reminded me very much of a traditional czech pilsner hop character and not what I was expecting from New Zealand hops. Easy drinking summer pilsner but I actually prefer Firestone Walker's Pivo Pils and Sierra Nevada's Summerfest to this joint effort."

"Pours a light golden straw color, tranparent with lots of effervescing and a thin white head. Smell is hay, hops an citrus, light and mild. Taste shares a lot in common with some of the American Adjunct pilsners, lots of hay and mild maltiness but with some citrusy and piney hops on top. Dry with some subtle black pepper spice. Feel is light, refreshing and lively. Moderate to high carbonation. Overall, good, refreshing, easy drinker."
""
""
"O- I didn't know this was a Czech Pilsner going into this. I was initially excited to try a hoppy pilsner that Firestone Walker had a hand in making because I've heard so many good things about Pivo Pils. But if Pivo tastes anything like this, I'm personally not missing out on anything."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle, part of the Beer Camp Across America 12-pack. Served in a pilsener glass, the beer pours a slightly hazy straw gold color with about an inch frothy white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like grassy and citrusy hops (lemon peel), grainy/bready malt and a bit of white grapes. It tastes pretty much just like the aroma, but with the addition of some tropical fruit and light piney hops. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick but also refreshing and easy to drink with good carbonation. I thought it was a good pilsener, I'd like to try this one again."

"Overall- A solid, good beer that is a fair representation of the style. Definitely worth a try, especially if you are a fan of pilsners."
"12oz bottle from the new mixed twelve that just came out. Yellow color, slight hazy, good head. Aroma was a hoppy pilsner. Flavor was good, crisp, definitely had a nice citrus like hop aspect to it. I would actually probably buy this if it came in sixers."
""
"Overall: Nice take on a Pilsner. Despite the unique hops, it is very balanced and refreshing overall. Ultimately, not that different from other very solid Czech Pils. This may disappoint some, but I am fine with that."
"Clear straw colored pour with a white one-finger head. Grainy aroma and initial taste. The light to medium body has a solid grass flavor with a mild hop presence at the end. Drinks easy and is very refreshing. Good but a bit average was kind of expecting a stronger hop flavor."
"I want to drink about six of these, but alas, I have only two of the beer camp 12s and I will share."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Quite reminiscent of the FW Pivo Pils (in fact I'd love to do a side by side), neither of which delivered on the hop promise of their labels. Solid beer regardless, but nothing I'll miss too terribly once this 12 pack is no longer available."
"Pours a somewhat pale gold. It appears to have a touch of haze, but it's bright and shiny in the light. Medium-sized head of fine foam. Good retention, moderate lacing. Good looking beer. The aroma has lager sulfur, fruity hops, fresh pale grain and a little bit of that lager-y yeastiness. Hops are a nice mix of light stone fruit, tropical notes and grapes. Some mint in there, as well. That said, hops are more restrained than expected. The underlying pils seems solid. Relatively dry. Moderate bitterness, probably would seem stronger with a drier, crisper pils base. Fresh sugary malt. Good lager yeast flavor. Prickly carbonation recedes relatively quickly. Fair bit of hop oiliness for a pils, which kinda throws things off for me. I like this beer, but I think the thought was a bit better than the execution. I'd love to see how these hops would fare in a crisp, bright Bohemian-style pils."
""
""
"O: A solid pilsner, overall. I would like a little more hop presence beyond a lingering bitterness."
"O- High IBU (45) for a pils and the hops are not the normal Noble types. It provides a nice change for the pils style and is a enjoyable beer. It comes across like a pale ale in a pils."
""
"Pours a clear light golden color with big soapy white head, settles to a thin cap, spray of lace on the glass. Smell: white grape, unripe mango, lime, floral. Taste: light grape sweetness, then big spicy hit with grapefruit peel, lime zest. Light bodied, hop oiled finish."

"Overall 3.75: I am normally not a big fan of the ""pale yellows," but this brew is certainly more interesting than most. Its greatest asset is something that might not appeal to everyone: its bitterness. I think that what happened was SN used their ""Torpedo"" hop rocket using noble hops and the result was more straight-up hop bitterness than people are accustomed to. I like it; it reminds me of the highly rated Victory Prima Pils (without the metallic taste). Great beer for sessioning and would be excellent with food, especially a great, big, charbroiled bacon cheeseburger."
"O- More bitterness than I care for in a pils, I'd say. Not much in the way of hop flavor either. I was hopping for something Pivo Pils-like but even better considering the collaboration. In the end, it's good, but not great."

Medium carbonation. A solid pilsner."

Opens with light passion fruit, husked grain, and light lemon zest. Lightly sweet malt combined with floral accents, edible orchids. Finishes clean with mixed fresh mild herbs and mild lime zest bitterness. Light bodied, high level of carbonation, crisp and slick mouthfeel. Really wonderful brew. Recommended."
