"Overall:  Nicely hopped, but a little sweeter than I would otherwise expect; nevertheless, I really enjoy this beer and have had it many times as it is often on the menu at local restaurants - surprised I haven't rated it before"

"Pours a slightly cloudy golden color. Head is a bout a finger and a half and lacing is nice and slow. Aroma is of a fine pilsner. Taste has a nice amount of hops balanced with a touch of lemon and citrus. Bitterness balances well and presents a very nice, top of the line pilsner...."

"Poured a slightly cloudy deep gold. The foamy white head has good retention and lasts well into the beer. A decent amount of lacing comes with it. Mild biscuit aroma and the taste adds just a hint of grassy hops."

"This was a refreshing pilsner. It was different from a lot of pilsners I have tried, which is a good thing. Foothills is a great beer maker. They have a good variety of styles, and the Torch goes well with their lineup. This beer complimented my dinner well. I had a great burger, and homemade chips."

"O: One of my very favorites recently, this is a go-to for me. It may be obvioius that I'm a pilsner guy but this is extraordinary IMO. And when it's on sale for $8/6 (which is pretty frequently here in Durham NC) it's hard for me to choose anything else. I love Torch!"
""
""
""
""
"Nice!"
"It has dull straw gold color. There's a bit of a cloudy haze to it. Big foamy white head and some lacing behind. Wheaty scent to it."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of grains, some malts. Taste is grains, hops, some malts, a touch of lemon, smooth and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it is pretty easy drinking, but I feel like the bitterness level on this guy is a little high for my tastes.. I want a crisp and clean finish that this one falls short on."
""
""
""
"o - Overall a decent pilsner. Not a ton going on but easy to drink and solid."
""
"Good session beer and would go well with a veggie curry."
""
""

""
""
"Light golden hued with great clarity. Just a faint wisp of foam partially covers the top. Aroma of Saaz hops and Czech lager yeast is prevalent. Mouth is crisp and refreshing. The taste is a nice gentle Saaz hop bitterness that beckons for additional sips."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours orange straw with little to no white head. Smells of nice grain profile, very sweet. Tastes of sweet grain, nice profile. Beer is heavily carbonated nice and smooth. Overall an above average beer."
""
"This one has grown on me. It is a typical Czech pilsner, I think the first bomber I got to this had been left too long somewhere, either on my own neglect or the store I purchased it. It pours a nice straightforward pilsner. The color is golden straw with a good bit of carbonation, which for this style is perfectly normal and something I look for. The smell is where it is truly at its best. It s great smelling beer, full of grainy aroma and character. The taste still doesn't fully do it for me. It is bitter and not necessarily in a good way. I expect the bitterness in an IPA and some ales, but this one should be more on the malt side of things. When I think of a pilsner I think of a beer that is highly sessionable, but I wouldn't do that with this one. Overall I do like it, but would choose another one to drink a few of. Overall, I do like this beer and think that it is fairly representative of the style. I would like for it to be a little less of that hairspray bitterness and more of the grainy goodness that comes through in the aroma."
"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a crystal clear, pale, honey-gold coloring with little to no head. Nose of floral hops highlight a subtle roast and bitterness throughout. Flavors are floral and peppery forward, with a heavy roast and bitter hops character at the end. Some richly sweet notes of honey ribbon throughout the palate, also. Smooth bodied, with a very clean aftertaste. The finish is very crisp and clean. An interesting twist on the pilsner, and tasty."

"O: A decent pilsner. Could have been great if the malt backbone hadn't been so...shall we say, 'robust'. Worth drinking again, but not worth getting a 6 pack of again."
"O - pretty ambivalent about this one."
""
""
""
"Also proud to say, that it`s made in my home state of N.C."
""
""
""
""
"It comes off almost more German to my sense with not much noble sensing hop character, but still an enjoyable pilsner to drink with it's thick malt presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was an OK beer, Nothing special. I don't think I'll buy this beer again. It's a little bitter, and not refreshing enough for me to warrant keeping this around."
""
"Overall - easy drinking session beer."

"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer for sure. Its not as flavorful or as crisp as some other versions of the style but still a solid choice, especially in the warmer months."
""
""
""
""
""
"A good pilsner, a little heavier on the grainy sweetness than I would like. Good spice presence, just settles down a little too heavily, making it not as bright or refreshing as I want."

"Super easy drinking pils. Not perfect but one I would buy again if I could get it here. I liked this as much as Prima Pils"
""
""
""
"Overall (4.25): This is an excellent pilsner. I’d love to have this in my neck of the woods, because it’s so well-crafted for the style that it’d be a great cross-over beer for those who aren’t so familiar with or deep into craft. Great for hot weather drinking. Definitely worth checking out if you’re a fan of pilsners or looking for local talent when in North Carolina."

"Overall – . It is refreshing and relatively crisp with a decent herbal hop profile. A decent and pretty easy drinking pilsner."
""
""
""
"O: A really nice try. It's refreshing, crisp, and feels like I just stuffed my mouth with wonderbread and butter (which I like). However, the hop schedule needs tweaking to finish this beer. I'm going to try it again in the summer, just to see if I like it better. End all, much better than generic pilsners out there."
""
""
"O: Nice and refreshing. I'm not much of a Pilsner drinker, but I could drink this pretty much anytime."
""
""
""
"O: One of the better pilseners that I have had from NC - I enjoy the additional hop flavors from the citrus hops that really add a little something extra to the taste and smell. Very enjoyable and quite easy to drink, a session beer."
""
""
""
"The combination of the dryness of the taste, herbal taste/hopiness, and overall appearence make this pilsner shine. Excellent."
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty pilsner. Better than most."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - real nice summer beer. I would prefered if it was a touch crisper but I could see drinking this as a warm weather thirst quencher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This isn't the best interpretation of a Czech pils out there. It's nice but as my first Foothills beer, it was underwhelming."
""
""
""
""
"This is has to be the most balanced and refreshing Czech style Pilsner I have in a long time! I seriously can not find anything wrong with this beer. Proud that it is brewed in my home state NC."
""
"If you want a pilsner with a kick, find it!"
"Overall, not bad. It can be my ""if all else fails, give me one"" beer."
""
"Overall: Good stuff. Not quite a typical European pils, but it has some resemblance to Urquell."
"Pours a clear glowing gold with a sudsy white head that settles to a slight haze and ring. Nice aromas of grainy malt, lemon zest, crackers, and noble hops. Taste is mostly dominated by the grainy cracker malt and more noble Saaz hops, along with a touch of honey and bread dough. Mouthfeel is properly crisp, with a medium-thin body and good, sharp carbonation. Overall it's not the most over-the-top beer in the World, but a damn fine Pilsner that is perfectly amble after a days work."
"O: This was a solid pilsener that would be divine on a warm summer day!"
""
"O: A very solid Bohemian - and better than most in fact. Torch Pilsner is a super clean, refreshing quaff that begs for outdoors and a hot day to compliment the drinking experience. Happy to have tried this one..."
"pour is a crystal clear golden orange with a rather tight creamy white head. The nose is pretty decent, a little heavy on the grain but adds notes of doughy bread and and some leafy green hops. The taste is slightly more balanced but still a touch heavy on the grain. Grain, doughy malts, some sweet caramel and honey transitions to some green leafy hop notes. The finish is faintly dry, highly carbonated and a bit rough on the back of the throat. Solid pilsner."
""
"Overall, a decent pilsener, but one that is readily surpassed by others in the style. I would happily drink it again were it offered, but would take no great effort to seek it out."
""
"O: solid beer, I'd def. purchase again, one of my favorites from Foothills thus far"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Clear gold with an inch of pure white foam. Pleasant spicy hop nose...slightly sweet pale malt, toasty grain, dough, faint fruit, and some lager character. More spicy, leafy hops in the flavor. Sweet, fresh grain and a lingering peppery bitterness. Very refreshing and chug-down-able. Body is a little better than light and is crisp. I've had this on tap a number of times and it's nice to see it in a bottle. Good local pils..."
""
""
"Arrived a clear medium yellow with a decent head and good retention. Had more caramel malt taste that a lot of pilsners I have had. Bitterness was moderate with a crisp fairly dry finish. Overall an ok pils but not one of my favorites."
""

""
""
""

"Pours a pure gold with thick head that stays around. Nose is pure straw/wheat. Taste offers light malt and a decent balance of hops; after a few sips the malts become a little sweet. Light bodied, carbonated well, and crisp. A very good pilsner."
"Flavor was similar but perhaps a bit more full than was the aroma. A very enjoyable pilsener. Crisp in body, a perfect summer beer. Quite refreshing."
"Beer is light to medium in body, lead off mild sweetness, mild bitterness from hops at the end, between is just sweet and wet, not overly sweet, it's a nice round subtle flavor, highly drinkable. Yum."
"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured golden yellow with a minimal white head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, and slight bitter hops. The flavor was of bitter malt, wheat, skunk, slight bitter hops, and subtle banana on the followthrough. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. The skunk aspect was a little surprising, but didn't kill the brew at all. All of the flavors worked really well together on this one, but it just wasn't awe-inspiring. Aroma was a little weak in intensity for my liking, but still decent. This is a must try at least once."
"Looks the part of a typical pilsener with a rich golden color and a thin creamy white head. The aroma has a dull, earthy bitterness that is pleasant but a bit muted. The flavor is more potent, with the same noble hop character coming through on top of a decent malt base. The texture is a bit thicker than a typical pilsener, being more resinous than crisp. Overall, this is a fine beer, but it doesn't really impress."
"Growler station was limited for my tastes and I was looking for an IPA. Settled for a pilsner instead. Pours a clear, golden yellow with little head as expected. Grassy and grainy with a slight hint of noble hops as a pils should be. Drinks really well and is a solid offering from Foothills."
"Pours a clear yellow color with visible carbonation bubbles and a white head without too much lacing as it goes down. Nose is some light grass and bread with a few hops. Light European hop character and grass in the taste. Light and crisp bit nothing too interesting."
"Drank many of these at the Carolina Ale House in Raleigh. Pretty pedestrian draft selection but this was a pretty solid choice. Mostly clear golden color, clean, grassy, lightly sweet aroma. Clean, crisp, nice grassy hop flavor with a pale malt sweetness and a hint of lemon and a modest spicy, bitter hoppiness in the finish. Not on the level of the very good pilseners I am used to living in PA, but a solid brew."
"Pours a pale yellow with an inch head w/ lacing down the glass. Mild malty aroma, Assertive lemony malt flavor with a burst of hops to balance. Light bodied, crisp and very drinkable. I had two pints and wanted more. This would be a great hot weather beer."
"An absolutely great and authentic pils. Foothills gets better and better as the days go on, and when they can brew a traditional, lower alcohol brew like this and have it impress almost as much as their much more limited bourbon-barrel experiments, you know they're doing it right."
"Drinkability: easy quaffing pils that is a bit light on the flavor profile but still tasty. Definitely worth a try if you see it on tap."
"D: I enjoyed this, but there are a lot better pilseners out there to be sure. Glad I tried it nonetheless and it is another solid Foothills product."
"Keg from the guys at Charletson Beer Exchange. V Good but not quite gr8 beer. Learned not to read other reviewers b4 making up own mind! Having tasted lots of Pils in Russia where Urquell (SP?) was pushed on people and was of LOW quality, this was a pleasant upgrade from that more skunky variety. Had never thought about whether beer leaves suds down the side of glass...."
"Pours clear golden with a fluffy head and nice carbonation streamers. The aroma is sweet pilsner malt with a sting of noble hops. The flavor is malty and honeylike, with a pleasant hop flavor and bitterness. The finish is fairly crisp. The downside is the sourness that develops late, with a peanuty flavor and mouthfeel."
"Overall sour finish brings down the drinkability."
"D - Very high. This one doesn't last very long."
"This started out a little rough, but the clean taste and crisp nature of this ended up making for a solid Pils drinking experience. At least enough to nicely compliment my accompanying 1/2 lb pub melt. Yum!"
"The beer is light, and has a nice dry aftertaste, very nice active carbonation and extremely easy to drink. For this style, this may be one of the best and IMO has been very much under-appreciated by the reviewer of this beer thus far (as do most lighter colored beers and some for good reason). Overall, an excellent beer by an excellent brewer."
"Reviewed on 06/21/2009. On draft. This beer pours a clear light yellow with a thick white head. The aroma is of wheat and light fruits. The flavor is sweet initially with a light wheat and bready finish. This was very refreshing and I thought it was a good pilsener!"
"A clear golden amber color with a thin white head and nice lacing. The aroma is weak swampy wheat and citrus. The flavor brings a nice balance of bitter herbal citrus hop and bready caramel malt. Very tasty and well carbonated. Crisp and very drinkable, a distinctive pilsner. Quite hoppy, fair bodied for the style."
"Drinkability: My beer of choice when working in the heat. This one will cool you down - perfect for the boat. Another great beer from the guys in Winston-Salem!"
"A pretty dark gold pour for a pilsener, off white head. Malt, yeast, light citrus and pineapple aromas. Malt, lightly Biscuity with some citrus fruit flavors. Lively mouthfeel, just enough so. Clean malt and hop finish. The Victory Prima Pils is still my favorite from an American brewer, but this was pretty darn good as well."
"Light-medium in body with perfect carbonation. Quaffable."
"This beer has a drinkability like very few pilsners! This is a great beer, when you can find it you should have one!"
"I'd have another. Foothills adds another solid, if a bit unexciting, brew to their stellar lineup."
"D - This wasn't a horrible brew to drink, but if I wanted something more I'd pick a German pils or an APWA; if I wanted something less I'd opt for a Brooklyn Lager or even PBR. Not particularly suited to etiher crowd."
"Aside from the simplicity of this brew, it is quite drinkable. Drinks very smooth and clean. Not a choice I'd pick for flavor, but for refreshment."
"This is one of the hoppier Pilseners I've ever tasted. That said, it's not really a great example of the style, but I absolutely loved the taste: citrusy, pine hops balanced by a light note of biscuity malts. The mouthfeel was on the heaver side of light-bodied, smooth and perfectly carbonated, with a lingering hoppy bite to the finish. Overall, this was a very enjoyable brew by the good folks at Foothills, and would make a great session beer."
"Very Drinkable and would go great with any light fare or German food."
"Served a crisp pale orange with a thin head that diminished to nothing. There was almost no aroma whatsoever. I was able to pull a little with a good swirl of the glass. The taste had a decent complexity with an almost IPA-like finish. The beer was crisp and smooth and very easy drinking. This would make a decent session beer, but there's far better stuff out there."
"This came with a thick, bone-white head with decent retention throughout. The nose had a distinct Saaz hops aroma. The color was a deep yellow with NE-quality clarity. The mouthfeel was light-to-medium with an intriguing light sweetness on the tongue. I did experience a medium hop bite on the finish, but it needed to be hoppier throughout, IMHO."
"Torch is my favorite of the regular rotation at Foothills, but that is more a result of my taste than its. I love a great pilsner and can make do with an average one. Unfortunately, Torch is pretty average, but it is not bad by any means...just average. The individual parts of the beer all are fine, but seem to add up to less than the sum, making the beer less smooth and drinkable than it should be."
"The beer poured into the glass with a nice darker golden body underneath a white head that holds a nice film and laces well down the glass. The smell is spicy czech hops and sweet pilsner malt. The taste is also very hop forward balanced by the malts with a nice bitter profile. The mouthfeel is great for the style. Enough body but still light for drinkability. Overall, a very drinkable pilsner. Not a german style as listed on this site, but a nice czech style one."
"While its forgivable butter character provides a charming sense of fullness, the beer doesn't let that interfere with its refreshing and hop-forward finish. With elements of mint, leaf and stem stewing late, an aftertaste of honeysuckle reward the senses one last time."
" Overall this was a really good pilsner, and totally away from what I was expecting. It was light enough to drink on a hot day or in large numbers, but at the same time had enough character, enough profile to carry its own weight even at night. This was a superb choice at the time, and a really good brew. I would definatly order this up again!"
"Prosit!"
"6-4-08: snappy, crisp hop presence with clean pilsner malts, apparently much improved over my previously reviewed version, near the top of the NC pilsner heap"
"Flavor was full of husks and grain flavors. Kind of like digging my teeth into an seven-grain bread that was flavored with alcohol. Slight hop bite that was more citrus than pine. Medium body. Perhaps a tad too much hops kind of threw this beer out of balance."
"This beer was a good lighter beer. The smell was macro like and the taste was too. But ice cold this sure hits the spot on a hot afternoon. I could drink this beer again. Average for the style. This could be a session beer with ease. I wish I had one right now."
"Body is a hair below medium. with a very brisk and crisp mouthfeel, with some light minerality in the finish."
"The body is light which is good per style. There is a good backing but some lighter sense almost gives it a watered down taste. Truthfully I didnt notice but it was by other in my party. So overall it was a good American pilsner."
"Poured a little deeper golden color than alot of pilsners with a fluffy white head that took awhile to come down,aromas of lightly toasted grain and corn husk and very fresh.Nice and well rounded pils here a firm dry malt base holds up very nice to a lip smacking dry herbal hoppy finish very clean in the finish.A nice sturdy pilsner that is very food freindly to boot,I really enjoyed this one."
