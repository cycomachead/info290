The flavors were clean and crisp, though not overwhelming. I tasted the pleasant Pilsner malts, bready grains and some lemon grass and herbal notes from the Saaz hops. Nothing was big about this beer it was well-balanced. The mouthfeel was smooth but slick, the body medium and the carbonation light. Very pleasant albeit non-distinct.","thekevlarkid","Feb 04, 2012"

Hops are on the lower end of the spectrum, with a mild lemon and earthy character, rather delicate. Bitterness is medium-light, present mostly in the finish. While light in body, this has a fullness that I've come to expect from the better pilsners out there. However, this finish isn't all together, despite the modest bitterness, this beer does devolve into being a little watery. Carbonation is high, providing a nice, drying, scrubbing finish. While not the best beer of the style, this is still one that I could easily drink half a case of if presented with the opportunity.","DefenCorps","Jan 04, 2011"

It has a light, clean tasting flavor that boasts of pilsner malts and not much else. Where are the hops here? It's dry with a bit of malt sweetness and a faint hop character. The mouthfeel is fine.

Much, much better than the ubiquitous puesdo-pilsners, but there are many better, and more affordable, options. Pils are delicate beers and overseas journeys don't do them any favors.

Flavor equally pleasant and quaffable, brngs some glory back to the Czech lagers after the dumbing down of Pilsner Urquell. Nice toasted malts, blended into a biscuit/cracker flavor backed with spicy/herbal noble hops. It's no Victory Prima as far as aggressiveness in terms of bitterness but it's hoppy, definitely a well made Czech pils. Mouthfeel is crisp dry refreshing never falls flat extremely refreshing taste, this is liquid bread and it's light bodied lager. It now makes more since why the Czechs drink more beer per capita than any other nation, solid from beginning to end I hope to find myself a steady fresh supply of this currently served at Giant Eagle Market District in Robinson.","WVbeergeek","Sep 26, 2010"

It is missing the Saaz hop aroma that this style posesses. But it does not smell skunky either. I pick up a lot of bready malt and yeast. Not as hoppy, bitter, and dry as the better Czech Pilseners. Mostly malt flavor upfront with the hop flavor coming in at the finish. Bitterness is low as well. Nothing wrong with the flavor but just a bit "meh". Also it is not as crisp and clean as the better pilseners. Light bodied with spirited carbonation.

Plenty of biscuity malt sweetness; this beer seems to be a bit light on bitterness for style. The finish is fairly dry with a good clean aftertaste. Light bodied and goes down easy.

Crisp malt flavor complemented by grassy bitterness from the hops. The beer finishes quick, bitter and dry.

It is very enjoyable, crisp and very clean, and if not too cold has plenty of malt and hop flavours and subtlety. However, this beer will seem unimpressively bland if drunk too cold.

Two finger snow white head shrunk to a finger or finger and a half, but stayed put nonetheless. Streams of CO2 continuously traveled skyward throughout the drink. Smell was a bit grainy and of course, rather strong of lager yeast. Some Saaz detectable. Very average, I would say, neither being offensive nor particularly special. Taste was malty up front with definite Saaz presence on the back end. I felt this was a better than average Czech Pilsener with a nice mouthfeel and subtle, yet enjoyable flavour.

The beer is fairly well carbonated which provides an extra tingle on the tongue and a touch more palate cleansing character. Herbal hop notes evoke thoughts of lemon grass, hints of mint, fresh cut hay, and an almost green basil like thing. A touch of bitterness in the finish, as well as a touch of lemon-like tartness. This is on the dry side for a traditional Czech Pilsner, it seems to be lacking that malt fullness and even the diacetyl is a touch on the lower end.
