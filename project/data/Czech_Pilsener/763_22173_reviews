"This is just simply a decent pils, very good.  A world class beer?  I am going to have to say no sorry.  Would I like try more beers from this brewery? Absolutely yes without question."

"Pours a clear yellow-orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and grass aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, grass, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty, refreshing, and easy to drink."

"On tap at Flavor bistro in Santa Rosa and served in a Moonlight Brewing pint glass (proper glassware). Bright yellow, clear, huge pillow of white head. Aroma is nice and fruity , malts, hint of lager yeast. Flavor is lager yeast, crisp, fruity, pretty much one of the best pilsners I've tasted and something you just want to gulp down."

"Funny story is that it took me ages to finally ""get"" the appeal of this beer, even in midst of all the hype. After cleansing my palate with a variety of gentler beers after knocking it out with far stronger offerings in the past year, my rediscovery of this beer came to me as a tremendous surprise. I always make a question to order either this or Trumer Pils whenever I'm in a bar that offers them in Berkeley - it keeps things simple, and yet, shows the vibrant qualities that a homemade lager can bring to the table."

"There’s a piney bitterness with a robust biscuit finish on it. Another tasty Moonlight brew."

"I like this beer, but I think I'd reach for a Death and Taxes instead because its slightly sweet for me."
""
"O: solid overall... great balance, foundation and separation of constituent parts.... tastes like a Czech Pils more than anything else.... probably oughta do a follow-up review ASAP"
""

"This is kind of the ideal lager sort of beer. Reminds me of the way Mexican beers used to taste in the 1960s, at least in my mind. On tap at the Trappist in Oakland and a great quaff for lunch."
""
"I have tasted very few high quality pils. This one blew me away. It was refreshing, light and full of good pils flavor. I was fortunate enough to have this on tap at Toronado with a good friend who was showing me the local brew scene. I won't forget it and would highly recommend you try it."
""
"On tap. Pours a clear light amber with a one finger white head that has good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is hay and straw. Quite earthy with bread and biscuit and a bit of grass. The taste is dry and earthy with straw, grass, and biscuit. The finish is drying with a very light bitterness and a lingering earthiness. Medium carbonation. Medium-light body. A great American Pilsener."
""
""
"Drink- Much like Bombay, was hearing the hype but couldn't believe how good this was. Sad I only had one pint."
""
""
"Beers like this show why the American brewing scene is now king, and will be so for a very long time."
""
""
"Overall - I'm not a lager fan, but so many pilseners are awful. This is an exception. When it's good, it's very good."

"O- A great pilsner, it's light, refreshing and very drinkable but still has loads of flavor, I don't drink a ton of lagers but this is easily the best pilsner I've ever had."

"Crisp, clean, easy drinking, slight hop and bitter twang but no aftertaste or lingering flavors, just bam, done. A very good lager and all, but allow me to fulfill the stereotype and just say that there's easily one hundred ales I'd rather have than this beer. A good beer though and something worth looking for and seeking out if you're a lager guy or girl."
""
"M/D: Medium-bodied, plenty of carbonation, and very easy to drink if you enjoy the style. I'm not a big fan of pilsners in general, but I've gotta tip my hat to Moonlight for brewing the best interpretation of the style I've ever tasted."

"Good Pils that rivals my favorite Prima Pils. All of the good flavors in a nice balance."
"O - Like Prima Pils only better. I see this as a a prime example of what the style should looked and taste like."
"Similar flavors, very crisp, dry and refreshing with a lingering bitterness from the ample noble hops. Light bready flavors of crisp crackers and sliced apple again. So crisp and clean, with enough hops to keep interest, superbly balanced with equal malt and yeast character. Extremely versatile, a timeless classic to pair with just about anything."
"A nice, full-bodied taste for a lager. I noticed very slight herb notes. A very appealing golden-brown appearence. Very smooth but thick mouthfeel. It is an extremely drinkable beer. Not an overpowering nose, but overall one of the best beers I've had. I will definitely look forward to trying this beer in the future."
"Overall, not bad, but certainly not my favorite. I was expecting just a little bit more. I'll revisited again though."
"Notes: Really nice pilsener with a good amount of hops in it. Quite refreshing and crisp. A little on the bitter side but overall it is fairly well balanced."
"O - Delicious, and this not a style I ususally go for."
"Overall: Pilsener at perfection."
"O - this packs in the flavor. For the abv, you can't ask for much more. Aroma and flavor are on for style and just really work well. Would be happy drinking this every day during the summer."
"O: There is a reason this is listed as the best Czech Pilsener. I love this beer and along with Death and Taxes order it pretty much whenever I see it."
"A very good Czech pilsner with good flavour and balance."
"After a long flight, it was great to grab a ccouple of these on tap while I had a snack. A very nice Czech pils."
"D - Super drinkable. This has set the new bar for Pilsners in my mind. The balance here is fantastic and all of the flavors really build on each other to create an excellent beer."
"Overall, a very well done lager. This could gain gratefully with the addition of a few more spicy, grassy hops, but very well done throughout nonetheless."
"While it may be the best pilsner brewed this side of the Atlantic (or should I say Pacific?) I think part of the acclaim it receives stems from the unfortunate fact that this clean, agreeable - yet uncompromising - kind of pilsner is so often dishonored, and dishonored so badly, that many overlook the fact that this hoppy but easy beer is just simply what a pilsner is."
"D-A very easy drinking beer that I wouldn't mind having regular access to; however, I don't see what all the fuss is about with this beer as I've had other Czech pilseners that were equal or better than this one."
"4.0 D: I never thought I'd want a lighter, ""less filling"" body on a pilsner, but apparently that's what I want. Good taste and overall good beer though."
"O: This is a hell of a beer, I have to say. It's a great, refreshing summery beer, but with a little more complexity than your run-of-the-mill pilsner. I wish I had regular access to this because I'd drink it all summer long."
"EDIT: Had to get a keg of this for my wedding. Everyone loved it and so did I. One of the best pilsners on the market."
"The mouthfeel is light with carbonation being above average. Overall it was a very good beer of the style. I found it very flavorful and balanced. It wasn't a beer that blew me away with flavors, but it was probably the best version of the style I've had. Very solid beer overall, easy drinking as well as flavorful. Rating with style in mind definitely gives this one a little boost in my scores since as I said, it's probably the best of the style I can remember having."
"Light and drinkable, but also very standard, and rather uninspiring. It's fair to say I was deeply disappointed with this beer, being nothing more than a middle-of-the-road pils. As far as I'm concerned, New Zealand has the jump on this style nowadays—Croucher and Emersons far outstrip this one."
"This might replace Death & Taxes as my favorite Moonlight beer. Full of flavor without needing higher abv to accomplish it."
"Overall/Drinkability: Great session beer, was our first beer for the night."
"Thanks to Sean and the Chicago crew for saving me some from last night's tasting. Growler opened up with a nice hiss...a great sign that its still fresh! Light bright golden color with nice carbonation and minimal lacing. Floral, grainy and hay like aromas...so much better than any of the Czech pilseners I've had. Taste is very flavorful for the style getting some floral and slight citrus notes in the finish. Very drinkable, light and refreshing. They are getting everything out this style that definitely lives up to its top rating. What a great beer to be able to drink on a hot summer day. Would love try this again fresh off the tap. Definitely a recommend!!"
"O - Best pilsner I've had, not to say I'd seek it out from some of my regular offerings, but it's quite good and easy to drink."
"D - Very very solid and lived up to the high expectations that I set for it. Would have again over and over. Must-try!"
"Great for the style but not an elite beer, really glad I got to tick it."
"This one really set the stage for drunken stumbling out of Toronado, which I think is just about right when you only get to go there once on a vacation."
"Overall: Delicious and amazingly drinkable. A rare treat."
"Perhaps not as balanced as it could be, and although quite tasty, it leaves me thinking about what I will try next. Perhaps that is the peril of being included on such an awesome tap list as the Monks Kettle has."
"Beer is light in body and served way too damn cold IMO. I wait and warm it up a little but get impatient. Shame on you Flavor, shame. Beer is mildly sweet up front and has moderate carbonation on the palate and finishes cleanly without being too dry. This was a high quality DONG tick for me and while I really appreciate the simplicity of this beer and it is done well, I can't think of anything that makes it special. Its not bittered, its just a classic example of the style, it embodies what a Czech pils is about. I'd have it again but I won't go out of my way for it again. Solid all around."
"Overall a superior pils."
"Finally, a pilsener that I can actually drink!"
"Taste is similar but I pick up a twinge of floral hops there too. Extremely crisp and refreshing. Easily the best pilsner I've ever encountered. Sharp carbonation, light mouthfeel and overwhelming drinkability. This one is a winner!"
"Nicely done!"
"Drinkability: If this were on-tap more often, it'd be my go-to beer in the city. I had two glasses at Park Chow: one on its own; the other paired with lasagna and a fresh salad. It was a great fit in both situations. If you ever spot this beer, give it a try!"
"D - Well, I came into it wanting to like this a lot. The keg at the Magnolia kicked when I was there earlier in the day so I was very happy to see this on tap at the Toronado. My first thought is that this is just an old keg or maybe it hadn't been poured in a while and was sitting in the lines, but at a place like the Toronado I wouldn't expect this. At any rate, the diacetyl was overpowering and really killed my enjoyment level on this. I'd love to give this one another shot at some point, but at least for now, it didn't live up to the hype or my expectations."
"Easy on the mouth, properly carbonated. A real pounder (oh and I pounded it)."
"Enjoyed on tap at Toronado. Yellow coloured body with a white head. Grainy. Very nice session ale. Medium mouthfeel.Lightly sweet. To me, a good lager. Not much hops detected by my palate, and its early in the day. I am open minded, but I was expecting more.Appropriate carbonation."
"Overall I wish I could get this more often. It's nice to just have a nice crisp pils every once in a while. And this is the best."
"Straw/light gold clear body, huge rising carbonation, two finger white soapy head slow dissipation, nice lacing. The nose is authentic Pilsener, clean smell and a grassy hop presence. Taste is very pils, a bit sweet up front, clean, reminds me a lot of Trumer Pils in a good way, but a bit sweeter. Mouthfeel is light, clean and crisp. Drinkability at this ABV is extremely high. A bit hoppy for the style and a little on the sweet side but that just adds to the allure of this fine offering from Moonlight. Another winner. probably the best American Pilsener I've had."
"Clear light gold with a thin white cap that faded to a collar. Lemony and grassy aroma, a bit floral with mild biscuity malt in the background. Solid bitterness with plenty of hoppy flavour, citrus and floral. Malt sweetness hit mid-palate. Finished with some mineral and herbal bitterness. Light bodied, moderate carbonation. One of the better pils I've had from a US brewery, solid all around. It just didn't blow me away like I expected it to. Hype? Maybe. Or perhaps I was spoiled by spending three years in PA surrounded by top notch lagers."
"M/D: Mouth is a bit thicker than your might expect, but not menacing. Super drinkable of course. Good stuff."
"for the style, this is one of if not the best pilseners i've ever had. ballast points Pescadero being the other. sampled at woodshop 5.0 several times. great color, aroma, and very drinkable and probably the lowest alc beer in the room. felt and drank fresh, and would of been even better on a hot summer day. moonlight makes some great stuff."
"Simple need not mean simplistic - a thoroughly enjoyable example of the style."
"D - perfect. I could drink it all night. For a beer to make me reconsider a style completely, I gotta give it props."
"Medium body which is happily much fuller than ai expected with a nice crisp light hop presence up front followed by a prominent pilsner malt presence and a very tasty earthy straw grass character. Very complex and easy to drink. ABV is decently masked with only slight alcohol presence. Light and crisp with a enough of a subtle hop bite up front and full malt body to make it complex and interesting. Recommended."
"This beer does have the lovely pilsner quality of disappearing from the palate immediately leaving you ready for more and more. I could drink buckets of this stuff and find it to be a unique and pleasant take on a very old style."
"D: This is a nicely crafted pilsner. Goes down easily, nocely balanced, not filling and one to sit with for an evening."
"D: This is a really refreshing and easy drinking beer. I'm not generally much of a lager fan, but this just has such great flavors and a nice light feel to it."
"I find it hard to believe that this beer is less than 5% ABV, but is full of all the pilsner qualities, and more, then molded together in a way like no other. No matter how you slice it, it's an outstanding pilsner. Only Brazil's very own Bamberg Tcheca comes close among pilsners in my book."
"The flavor echoes the smell to some extent with the noble hopping, the straw character comes through for a nice moderate bitterness. Crisp finish with a little bit of earth to it. Medium bodied with a prickly amount of carbonation. This is a very refreshing beer. It wasn't the mindblowing experience that I had expected, just a real nice pils to enjoy. Definitely the best example of a pilsner from California, at least."
"I had this on tap at Toronado's in San Francisco. The beer was clear with a little haze, gold colored with a thin head and no lacing. The aroma was toasted malts with some light citrus like lemons or at most orange. The taste was similar to Pilsner Urquell, at least as much as I remember it, lightly hopped and understated which is OK for the style. Good carbonation, medium body, everything is OK but not mind-blowing like I hoped from a beer that's been on the top 100 for so long. Not sure what the appeal has been with this beer, I definitely didn't feel interested enough to get a second one."
"D: Pretty drinkable, but not more so than most for the style. I didn't detect nearly as much of a hop presence as others have discussed, so I'll make sure to revisit it again in the future."
"D: A fairly good czech pils. Probably wouldn't make it my go to pils, though."
"D - Very drinkable. You could session the hell out of this one."
"D - Super drinkable. I finished my glass in no time and could easily have had plenty of this, although flavor-wise it paled in comparison to the amazing Death & Taxes."
"Again soo friggin cool that I was able to land this one. I had all but written it off without a trip out west, but never say never. One of the best session beers I have ever had. I would drink this all day if I could."
"D: While I'm rarely up at Toronado, I could see myself having this again when I'm looking for something more refreshing and lighter on the palate than a big hop or malt bomb. Lovely brew."
"Draught at Toronado SF. Finally. I've seen this on the menu at The Red down in Santa Cruz at least three times, and the keg seems to always have ""just"" kicked. I started to get into the style while I was on the east coast, and this definitely hangs with the top American stuff. Pours a clear gold with a fluffy white head. Bread and spicy noble hop aroma. The flavor is quite hoppy but with a nice fresh bread malt body to balance. The hops are pretty spicy and finish with a medium bitterness. There is a light mineral quality as well, the malt is very evocative of grain and fresh bread. Light bodied but not thin in the mouth. Very solid pilsener overall."
"D - A very good beer, it improves with every sip. Very addicting, but am unsure of it deserving of a top 100 beer. I think Pilsener Urquell is a better example for the style. Still very good."
"This to me is a perfect session beer. I love how light this beer is and the generous hop character keeps me going back for more."
"Served in a Moonlight glass at Flavor Bistro in Santa Rosa on 02/06/09. Beautiful opaque golden with a perfect white foamy head. Simply gorgeous in the glass. Wonderful aroma of a romp through some wheatfields, with a subtle but nice fragrance. Crisp toasty breadiness noted on the first sip...like a Triscut cracker. Spot-on crispy hop bitterness in the flavor, with a touch of bitterness in the mouthfeel. Picked up more of the perfume up front in the body. Wonderful melange of crisp cracker breadiness and subtle crisp hopiness. Very honored to have tried this beer...perhaps the best American-made pilsner out there."
"Pint at Toronado for three dollars and some change during happy hour a week ago, reviewed from notes, finally get to try this Top 100 beer, color is a golden yellow with some cloudy orange thrown into the mix, aroma is of toasted pilsner malts, floral hoppiness, bread, butter, grapefruit, lemons, flowers, grass, and mild spice, flavor starts off bready and quite chewy for its style, middle is toasted with buttery bread, finish is a mix of floral and citrus hops, wow I kept asking myself if this was really a pilsner and in fact it is a very good one, like the grassy accents once it warms, great finish that is crisp until the end, mouthfeel is chewy, dry, citrusy, and slightly sweet, medium bodied but still on the thinner side, crisp level of carbonation, taste lingers a very long time for its style, so much flavor packed into a beer that is less than five percent, drinks very easily, super light and refreshing, could have drank numerous pints, I want more as I am writing this review, too bad this stuff is not bottled like the picture deceives us of, world class beer coming from a great Northern California brewery, will be drinking this ever time I see it now, quite the session beer to say the least, this is worth the hype and is phenomenal for its style, never thought a pilsner could have such great fruit character, highly recommended"
"Easily the best domestic pilsner I have ever tasted. Impressive."
"While a perfectly drinkable and perfectly easy to drink beer... this isn't something I see myself asking for again. Particularly when it's dark cousin (Death and Taxes) keeps calling my name so seductively."
"Easily the best pilsener that I've had so far. I've been nothing but impressed with Moonlight Brewing thus far. It's a shame that they don't put out greater volume and some bottling would certainly be nice. Reality Czeck is an excellent beer and a bit of a surprise for someone who hasn't had many good lagers, like me. The beer is golden in color with a white head that leaves decent lacing. The aroma is very cleanly hoppy and crisp with freshness. There is some excellent pale malt balancing things out. The beer has wonderful grain flavors, almost the opposite of normal, stale macro pilseners. There are light hop notes, mostly pine and grass, with a slightly bitter finish of lemons. The malt and grain flavors are just right and so much better than cheap lagers that it's like night and day. You taste the fresh grains that go into this beer, and they're crisp and bready. The mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, just right for a pilsener. It's a very easy beer to drink, one of the most sessionable beers that I've tried."
"Note: I like this one A LOT more than the numerical score indicates."
"D: Man the whole place was pounding this one and I can see why. The perfect pils!"
"Great pilsner. Reminds me of some of the New Glarus pilsners with a bunch more hops."
"Just a great example of a pilsner, rivaling those that have been doing it for centuries. Wish it was more widely available."
"On tap at Toronado SF Sept 19. Pours the usual golden pils colour with good clarity. Reasonable ivory coloured head. Nose- spicy , fresh mown grass. Taste- light toasty malts with the spicy/grassy kick of the saaz hops. Finishes quite dry with crisp bitterness. Carbonation levels are moderate making for an easy refreshing quaffer."
"On-tap at Toronado. Finally getting around to reviewing this after having had it a number of times. Great brewery and a great beer. Pours pale gold with a pure white head and some lacing. Aromas of spicy hops and some lager yeast. Long and spicy in the nose. Very nice hops that seem super fresh. The taste is similar with a nice crispness, especially fresh and spicy hops for the style, and a long yeasty finish. Full and rounded, with the trademark softness of the Czech Pilsner style, but a bit spicier and tangier than Czech versions while not approaching the earthy bitterness and uber crispness of the German style. A bit spritzy on the moiuthfeel, not necessarily a bad thing. just a fine beer all around."
"Pours a clear straw yellow, decently thick white head forms, drops a nice sheet of lace on the glass, settles to a layer, looks quite fine. Smell is great, honey, grass, nice biscuity malt, very clean, musty grapes, nice herbal hoppiness, some floral, light but lots of aroma. Taste is better, some sweet maltiness, biscuit/toast in the middle, grass, floral, totally ripping herbal bitterness in the finish, along with a light salty/mineral character I was digging. Mouthfeel is awesome, light bodied with medium carbonation, super smooth and very drinkable. This is a great pilsner, very clean malts and perfect bitterness and hoppy goodness, I wish I could get something like this here, I loved it."
"Taste was more robust, with some nice woodsy/earthy hops and a crisp citrus zest along with a sharp, bitter twang ... but I'd probably order about half a dozen other beers on the Toronado menu again before revisiting this one. I will say that it's mouthfeel and drinkability are superb: it goes down easy and is a pleasant brew indeed."
"Reality Czeck is simply a super hopped up version of a Czech pilsener. Frankly, I was expecting a whole lot more from this brew."
"Had this on tap this weekend at both the Toronado and Flavor Bistro. Pours a light yellow with a frothy white head. The taste is mildly sweet while having an awesome snappy hoppiness to it. It finishes clean without a huge amount of lingering bitterness or sweetness. I remember Prima Pils being somewhat like this but the crispness and refreshing feeling of this brew easily make it the best I've ever tried from the Pilsner category."
"Revisiting this after forever at Flavor. Beautiful hoppy, crackery , bready nose, earthy, lemony hops, brilliant stuff. The palate opens with a lemony bitterness, snappy and doughy cracker malt character. Mild honey like sweetness. Bitter, drying finish, doughy and with a little sweetness. Awesome. Upping appearance and nose by .5 and taste by .25. Changing overall to 4.5"
"Overall, incredibly easy to drink. I polished off the first quickly, then slowed down a bit with the second to enjoy it. Strongly encourage trying this one!"
"The taste is similar: a full-bodied, lightly sweet grain/bread lager with plenty of citrusy-piney hop flavour to just dominate it. It is crisp but smooth and full of long-lasting flavour."
"A good beer, but a Czech pils is like someone doing ballet, gracefully, elegant. This pint was more like a hip-hop dancer, definitely an American version of the style."
"Not only the best pilsener, I've ever had - but possibly the best session beer. And I could drink this everyday."
"On tap at CIty Beer Store in S.F. Thanks to Craig for the sample of this. Smell was somehow of a spiced cream corn, and not corn in the way that cheap beers smell or taste of corn. Light clearish yellow color with a unique taste to match the smell. Has a nice almost spiced maybe subtle bitter bite to it, and was quite nice. An interesting beer worth trying if you can get a shot at it."
"D- This could easily be a session beer. I had Pliny the Younger right before this and I think the awesomeness of that beer overshadowed this one a lot. It's a good brew but I don't think it can hold a candle to prima pils."
"This is what a pilsner should be. Light and crisp, but full of flavor. I could drink this all day. It pours a clear, golden color, with plenty of carbonation. Thin white head. The taste is crisp, dry hops. This has become what I will judge pilsners against. If only it was easier to find."
"Served on tap at the Toronado. It has a clear golden colored body with a thin white head. The aroma is pretty good with a crisp hop presence leading a good malt backbone. This is one of those beers where I can actually picture the hops and barley when I smell it. The flavor has good bitterness; actually a bit more than I expected for a light pilsener. Behind the bitterness is that same strong malt backbone that was in the aroma. Hop flavor is not very strong at all. The body is not quite as light as I would have expected, but still fairly light. This would make an excellent summer drinker."
"This is an excellent low ABV choice that is highly drinkable. Highly recommended..."
"Biscuity slight caramel maltiness leaves things fresh and creamy with a floral hopping that interacts to a tee. Wonderful carbonation has a spritzy tingly sensation on the finish. Lemony with a bit of a buttery cereal driven kick. One to session for a week."
"Note: So this is a perfect pilsner From now on I will gage pilsners, which are much, much more common here in the heartland then they are on the west coast, against this beer. Although this is certainly a great beer, I think I will find that there are many pilsners made by small breweries here in Wisconsin that can stand up to Reality Czech. That being said, kudos to Moonlight one of my favorite Bay Area brewers."
"As far as Pilsners go, this one goes to 11, I'm extremely pleased to have tried it, and it's an essential brew if you're in the bay area."
"D: Incredibly drinkable and smooth, a great pilsner, I could drink this all day, the epitome of a session beer. This is my first beer from Moonlight, and if they are all as good as the pilsner, I'm in for a treat when I can find them. A great beer all-around. The best pilsner in the world."
"D: My first introduction to this excellent beer did not disappoint. Paired well with grilled wild boar sausage and onions; seemed perfectly easy to drink with or without the benefit of food to pair with it. Could be the smoothest, most drinkable pilsener I can recall trying to date. Highly recommended!"
"A perfectly clear straw-colored pils without much head to speak (this was mostly due to the way the bartender poured it though, because the carbonation was just fine). Pretty subtle aroma; pale malts, grainy and grassy, lots of fresh floral hops. The taste closely mirrors the smell - bready pale malts and a surprisingly strong hop kick at the end that lingers on the palate for quite a while. Very clean and simple, light in body and crisply carbonated, exactly as a pilsner should be. It reminded me quite a bit of Victory's Prima Pils, but with a cleaner taste and better balance between malt and hops."
"I really can't imagine a better pilsener overall. I could drink this beer all night (if Toronado didn't have so many other tempting brews). This lived up to all the hype for me."
"I'll admit that I'm not the biggest pilsner fan out there but I'm just not understanding why everyone is going ape-shit for this brew. I would actually place Victory's Prima Pils (on tap) ahead of this beer. Argue if you must but I'm standing my ground."
"This beer has superior drinkability and can quench with the best of them during the hot summer months. Sucka jeah!"
"Highly, highly recommended. This is probably the first time I have gotten truly excited about a pilsener - let alone rating it in the top beers I have had of all time. So yes, it's that good."
"Track this down! Perfect for the warm temps that are approaching."
"Drinkability: Generally pilsners can be drunk in quantity, but this one is so aggressively bitter that, by the end of the pint, I felt I had to give my tastebuds a rest; the floral tones at the end of each sip were quite memorable and certainly set this beer apart"
"D: I can't imagine a beer being more drinkable or sessionable than this beauty. It is extremely smooth, flavorful and drinkable. A perfect beer for enjoying a beautiful spring afternoon."
"D: At 4.8% this is easily one of my favorite session beers, very refreshing and tasty and uncloying and just absolutely great."
"An exceptional beer. Incredibly balanced, tasty, and flavorful. Ridiculously drinkable."
"A beer with a cohesive and delightful personality, even if it doesn't quite adhere to the style. Shows that the world of great American beer doesn't start and stop with ales. If you're in Northern California, don't stop with the IPAs and sour Belgian-styles - make sure you try some Reality Czeck."
"Overall: Seems wrong to give a perfect 5.0, but this really *IS* that good. To try to improve it would be like killing the Goose that lays the Golden Egg. On-draft, fresh from the Tap at Flavor Bistro in Santa Rosa, this was Simply Stunning, Exquisite, Dangerously Drinkable and Effortlessly Addictive. Believe the Hype and laugh at Prima Pils. Some slight deviations and variations from the better home-spun Czech Pils style that those anal nit-pickers revel in, I ignore them all, for the simple reason that my first taste of this literally reminded and mentally transported me back to my first trip to (the then) Czechoslovakia. It had me eulogizing about those first half-litres of Pilsner Urquell, StaroBrno, Gambrinus and Budvar that I tried way back in 1991. In that respect, this is where the Reality Czeck wins hands down. Forget my original reason to visit Russian River, sampling the Reality Czech at Flavor Bistro was worth the 900 mile round trip from Long Beach to Santa Rosa just for this alone."
"Mouthfeel is light, smooth and even somewhat creamy. Plenty of bubbly carbonation flows down with each sip. Supremely drinkable...I could seriously enjoy the hell out of this brew all night long. A stellar pilsner with a plentiful hop bite. At 4.8%, if I was near Moonlight and somewhere that had this on tap regularly, I think I might be in trouble. Now it's time for me to visit California and get more....yum."
"Drinkability is good a nice crisp clean pilsener, make a hell of a session brew. Pilsener's not my big thing, but this one is nice."
"22 oz bottle. Hand bottled via counter pressure filler. The beer is a brilliant straw yellow color with absolutely no haze at all. A massive carbonation is seen maintaining a finger of head over top of the brew. Very good looking beer. The nose brings a mild honey-kissed pilsener malt sweetness, a mild grainyness, and a solid herbal and spicy noble hop that really entices me to drink this one. As I sip it, I find this one brings an excellent herbal noble hop that moves to a moderate to strong bitterness. Behind this is a mild grainy character and a very subtle sweetness. The bitter lingers really nicely into the finish, drawing me back for more and more of this one. The balance here is fantastic. Definitely one of the best pilsener beers ever to grace my glass. After letting my palate sit for a minute after a drink, there is a sweetness that sticks to my tongue and works really well against the bitterness that clings. Mouthfeel is moderate with a very solid carbonation that breaks it up and keeps it feeling really light and smooth. Drinkability is top notch on this one. This is a beer I would love to see on tap so I could belly up and drink it till the keg was done. It is big in flavor, balance, and clarity. I really enjoy this beer. I believe the hype, and will be looking for this one when I hit California early next year. This is a great Czech pilsener."
"Cheers!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" bright white head over the clear light golden brew. Head lasts very well, with ample artful delicate lacing. Aroma is pale grain sweetness upfront, giving way to Saaz crispness. Flavor is also light malts and crisp hoppiness, but I'm kind of at a loss to put into words how well everything melds together. Nary even an aftertaste, which often dooms some in the style. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, extra smooth, and drinkability is superb as well. If this is better on tap, I can't wait to make sure."
"Reality Czech is my first Moonlight brew and I have to say that I'm impressed, especially with its balance and its drinkability. Not that I needed any more impetus, but savoring the final few ounces of this incredible beer leads me to cast my mind back to that too-long-delayed trip to Santa Rosa. In addition to wallowing in great food and great beer, I'd love to be able to thank RedwoodGeorge in person."
"This is the ultimate session beer. Certainly, the best pilsner I've ever tried. The 22 oz. bottle provided by George filled two tall pils glasses which emptied in what seemed to be record time. Damn! This stuff is off the scale in drinkability."
"the things that makes this beer the stuff of legends are not excessively creative flavor blends or double extreme anything. it's the presentation of a fresh, flavorful session beer that incorporates massive amounts of taste, practically nothing off-kilter, and the ability to session the hell out of it. i would drink the shit out of this beer if it was available to me locally. a true treat and an excellent, green west coaster."
"Drinkability will be questionable for lots of people. This is a VERY aggressive Pilsner, if you loved Sam Adams imperial Pilsner you will love this. If you like regular type lagers and try this as just a little stronger you will get shocked. This is A LOT stronger than most any lager you could name. Like a big hop smack you will love it; if you don't you will be over powered."
"It poured hazy straw gold with lots of champagne bubbles. Light aroma of saaz hops. It had an earthy character. Mushrooms? Possibly a little green apple. . Taste is crisp clean. Very sparse. I detect that earthiness again in the flavor. Light, crisp and clean. With a biting tartness from the hops used. Extremely drinkable, this would be an unbelievable warm weather beer. It was worth the wait."
"Drinkability  I ordered a round of three and somehow got four beers out of it. I bogarted the extra one and had no problem finishing it. Really, you cant stop at Flavor Bistro without ordering at least two of these Moonlight Brewing specials; one to down in three gulps out of sheer decadence and the other to drink like a gentleman."
"[EDIT] I have since learned that no Saaz is used in this beer, rather an unlikely combination of American hops. It's still the best beer I have had to date, and I wish it were more accessible."
"All I can say is this is a must try it if you have a chance."
"I have been a fan of Moonlight since I randomly ordered a Death and Taxes during my first trip to Toronado about two years ago. When I order a moonlight, I expect a beer that is completely unorthodox with no definable style. The devil may care vibe of Moonlight always made it an interesting choice, and never a disappointment. But, unlike I am used to, Reality Czeck is a completely different. This is not a ""take"" on the pilsner style, it is not an americanized variation or a stylistic homage. It is a straight up Czeck pilsner, just the pinnacle of craft (that I have had so far). There is a refinement to a style I had passed on that makes this beer so damn enjoyable. Extremely versatile, damn delicious, world class."
"Drinkability- Please, oh please bottle this!!! Session beer at it's best. Best pils hands down. So well put together and balanced."
"Thanks to Venom for putting this on the BA radar screen."
"Drinkability and Notes  Great drinkability because of the superb balance and terrific flavor. This is probably the second best pilsner I have had, behind only Prima Pils. I wish it had been more carbonated, but it was still a good craft brewed pilsner."
"As for drinkability - there's no real question. This pilsner may be difficult to find but it's worth the trip. Lunch at Flavor is quite affordable and I've already made a date to go back there in a week (for more Pils)"

"Sampled at the Boonville Beerfest."
"Fresh keg, tapped at Zeitgeist in the mission. Bright gold. Goldy gold, the most gold that fucking gold can get in a beer. Perfectly sized and contained head of thick egg cream white foam. Aromas are al that a pils should be, and nothing that a pils shouldn't be. Floral German/US hop varities lend this brew a great aroma of lemon, lime, bread dough, flowers, oranges, and more. The taste is a combination of the aromas but intensified, unified, and perfected. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to light with an intense small bubbled carbonation that never let's up lending this brew a perfect drinkability. Insanely drinkable. Refreshing and subtle, yet horribly complex and thought provoking. This is beer."
