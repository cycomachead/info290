"An acquaintance brought this over. He didn't know any better."
""
""
"D- An excellent, very drinkable, but sophisticated beer!  Highly recommended!"
"This is a very typical Pilsener. Bright in the glass, easy on the palate, with a bit of corn sweetness and Saaz hops at the end of the tongue. An enjoyable alternative to Pilsener Urquell."
""
"Stale smell and below average in taste. Not my style of beer."
"bright golden color, white frothy head from hard pour, it fades.   clean, earthy aroma.   taste is crisp, just a touch of sweetness and some grassy hops.   thin body, but slick mouthfeel.   easy to drink.  pretty good overall."
""
"Enjoy"
""
"This isn't all that good. I don't know fresh it is, but no beer of this kind, or really any kind, should be put in green bottles."
""
"Great even taste, no complexities."

"Purchased in Bratislava from a store. Typical pilsner/lager. It's not Budweiser."
""

"O: Nothing overly interesting here. Golden Pheasant is a typical, mass produced beer. There are worse examples of a Czech pilsner, but there are certainly better ones."

"An inoffensive, but otherwise not very interesting Euro Lager. Now that I’ve tried it, I don’t think I’ll need to have another one."
""
""
"Pours a pretty gold in color with a thick foamy white head that lasted a while. Decent amount of lacing was seen also when sipped. Lots of streaming bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Since most of brews that come in a green bottle is on the 'skunky' side for some reason, this was NOT the case with this one at all! The aroma is of malts and hops for the most part. More going on with the taste as there is a slight nutty flavor in there also because the malts and hops. A very light hoppy finsih that doesn't last. Great taste and easy to drink!"

""
"I would give this 87 out of 100."
"O: Not a bad brew for a hot summer day, but it's far from being my go-to when the mercury starts to rise. It's very easy to drink, but I wouldn't go far out of my way to obtain it again. Not that it's a bad beer, mind you, I just think that there are better offerings out there."

"12oz / Pint Glass"

"A nice example of what a nice pilsener tastes like."

"Poured into a pint glass from a 500 ml green bottle (fortunately I failed to detect any skunk). This pilsener is a honey gold hue with an impressive rich white head, around five inches or so ... Stands out from many other pilseners in this latter regard. Aroma is rich pilsener malt and a subdued noble hops spice. The smell was middling or just below this but fortunately the taste compensated. Not a super dry or bitter pils but with a rich malt character and assertive hopping for a European macro-brew. Admittedly much better than I expected. Cracker and sweet bread malts predominate but there are also very nice noble hop spice and fragrant hay flavors, particularly in the semi-dry finish, along with sweet honey and vanilla notes, almost evokes raisins for a moment (!). I don't get much of the characteristic Saaz floral/herbal character. There is some diacetyl which actually works well, contributing to a somewhat buttery mouthfeel that fits many descriptions of the Czech style, which is supposed to be a bit chewier than a German pils. I also detect a mild fruitiness. Honestly a rather impressive Czech pils straight from the source (well, Slovakia). I dig the complexity and softer, sweeter, rounded-off corners. Your mileage may vary of course. Style purists might consider some of the traits I enjoyed here to be faults."

"The only delta I could see was that it tended to drink a bit flat and not crisp like I was expecting. But, really this is a good beer."

"I would say I must agree with most of the people who talk about this beer. Had this at 1. Slovak Pub in Bratislava, a great environment. The beer is served in what is called tankovar in Slovakia (and in Cech Republic too) which means it is brought in unpasteurized in tanks. This gives the beer a distinct earthy taste that is not found in the bottled version. In Slovakia of course, this beer is far cheaper than in North America, so it may not be worth buying if you live in Americas. Instead, perhaps try another more widely available Cech pilsner such as Staropramen or Pilsner Urquell."

"Overall - A step above from the other Euro Pale Lagers that I have tried in the past. There is a nice grassy hop finish that stands out in this brew in comparison to its competition."
""
""
"This beer pours a really medium yellow - not nearly as pale as coors light or that kind of stuff. The head is pretty generous at 3 fingers' worth and the smell is really hoppy, almost like a proper pilsner. The taste is fantastic for a Euro lager - it is much more hoppy than any of the big brands, with a smooth finish and a pleasant lingering bitterness on the tongue. If you enjoy a good pilsner, you'll take well to this. Definitely grabbing this again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - a solid pils that is enjoyable, accessible and is a bit smoother than others in the style. A recommended buy for pils lovers."

"Smells of Pils malt sweetness and spicy Saaz-like hops with some obvious skunking (green bottles!!). Still not bad though. The flavor is right there also, first the malts make themselves known, but then the minerally hop bitterness comes in and gives the beer a drying impression. Overall, not that much different that some other green bottle Pils', but maybe not so one-dimensional as Urquell and a bit smoother on the palate. Probably would get consistenly higher ratings if they switched from the green bottles."

"Overall: not a bad pilsener at all, but with an equivalent of AU$60 for a case of 24 x 330mL, is it worth it? I don't think so. Just get a different, cheaper equivalent Czeck or German pilsener, which are just as good. this simply doesn't have the 'cut above' factor that would make the extra cost worth while."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a decent representation of this style which is generally hit or miss for me. I'd have to say this was better than I expected!"

"A descent and good Czech Pils. Enjoyable and worth trying out."

"A really good beer. Light and easy to drink, but a good representation of the style. Would be a great beer for the islands in the Caribbean. Very drinkable yet still nicely flavorful. Much Better than American lagers."
""
"O: This beer isn’t that bad, but it isn’t as malty compared to other pilseners."
"O: This beer is enjoyable, the flavor while slightly sweet initially there is a pretty good balance to the flavor. Easy to drink and definitely sessionable."

"O - a classic czech pils in many respects, not best in class but a tasty and easy drinking brew well worth a try or two"

"O - Refreshing summer beer, nice example of the style."
""
"500 Ml bottle....pale yellow with foamy white head. Skunky smell fills the air as soon as I pop the top. Taste is light and watery with a little bit of hop bitterness that hangs around after swallowing. the mouthfeel is smooth with medium carbonation. Overall this is a slightly above average beer, no off tastes, very easy to drink. Im glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O -- This is a classic Bohemian Pils; a beer that is very refreshing and begs for more tastes. It's lighter in mouthfeel and body than Budvar or Urquell, but not as delicate as some German Pilsners. Very nice."
""
"Out of a bottle this beer was a clear, rich, golden color with lots of rising carbonation and two fingers of foamy, yellowish head. The retention was good and the lacing consistent. The aroma was of macro grains, corn, pale malt and some faintly grassy hops. The flavors were less ‘macro’ than the aroma but still centered around the dry, grainy corn and pale malt. I also tasted some sweet malt, bread, and a touch of citrus and herbs in the hops. Clean, bitter finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy, the body medium and the carbonation nice. A good example of the style, even if not a great stand alone beer."
""
""
"This beer was given to me from a guy I work with. Strangely enough I haven't had this one before. The beer poured out s a lightly hazy looking yellow color. The head was white, it had a decent retention to it. The smell of the beer is earthy, and gives off that grassy pilsner aroma. The taste of the beer is sharp, it has a nice hoppy bitterness with a sweet malt finish. The mouthfeel of the beer was clean and crisp. Overall its a pretty good pilsner. I actually enjoy this one."
"A good beer all around and one that might become a regular in my fridge."
""
"Overall: Once again, this beer put a smile on my face and reminds me of certain memories in the Easten block. A good pilsner from Slovakia that I will enjoy for many years ahead."

"Final Grade: 3.73, a solid B."
"Overall, a great pils. I'm glad I tried this beer out an I will definitely purchase it again the future."
"O - Overall, incredibly underwhelming and lackluster beer. Wont buy again, but, atleast I check off another country."
"Pours a clear deep golden yellow with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a small cap. Thick legs of lace form down the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains, grass, and some herbal scents. Taste is of grains and grassy flavors with a mild herbal hop quality on the finish. A very mild hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a pretty good carbonation level with a nice crip, clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good pilsener but nothing too exciting."
"Overall: Similar to many other region beers,"
"Overall, this is a nice, and slightly layered beer. A pleasant surprise."
"Not a pils however."
"Dr: It's far too expensive in Ireland, but I assume it's affordable elsewhere. It's a garbage beer, not to be consumed by proper beer fanatics."
"500ml into a snifter...big pilsener head with decent retention on top of a clean body. Solid lacing for the style. Aroma isn't quite as funky with the yeast as I like in this style, but it's well balanced and also very clean. Taste is balanced, smooth, highly drinkable. Mouthfeel is clean and crisp too. I am using that adjective a lot in this review, but this is quite simply a super clean beer. Good value too, easy call to buy frequently, it's a classic of the style."
"Overall: Very good beer, would definately recommend it to a friend or stranger. Slightly on the expensive side($12.60) for a 6 pack, but the flavor is worth it. Warning though, if you are a fan of normal pilsners you may not like it because of its aforementioned bock taste."
"overall not recommended. leaves a bit of dryness and bitterness but which i like but there is too much negative for me in the nose. and the style is not very ambitious or good."
"While this has a crisp golden bronze color, it had basically no head, but the aroma is nice and hoppy with a nice bread like character to it. The taste and mouthfeel are crisp and clean and again rather like raw bread dough in flavor. I will say I like the fact that it had a bit of an effervescent quality to it."
"D: A solid pilsner here, just be careful not to get it skunked. When it's at its peak it's a nice little beer."
"Pours a super-clear, golden yellow. a white head laces the glass. Smell is very minerally, some biscuity malt and a faint bitterness. Taste is way more ""round"" than the smell. A fair amount of estery back end and a nice, mellow hop finish. Super smooth feel with some zest at the end, easy to drink. A fine pilsner, here!"
"Really drinkable. Solid."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com/"
"I poured the half liter bottle into a stella Artois glass. The beer poured a nice cloudy golden color with a small white lacing for a head. Plenty of nice hop bitterness on the tongue with a buttery finish. The mouthfeel is very mellow a goes down smoothly. A great sipping beer and even better for long sessions."
"Pourd a .5L can into my mug. Appeared gold, not entirely clear, with a short head. The bitterness is right in line with the style with a rounded, herbal hop finish. The aroma and flavor are a touch cider-like at first, but the spicy, dry lemony hops quickly take over. Not a bad lager to session."
"D - A pleasant surprise and a tasty Euro lager that would bode well on a hot summer day. Flavours are mild, but I would definitely prefer this over some of the Canadian large scale brews."
"The beer has a decent grain bill, with a touch of sweetness in the cereal malts and some light hops giving a bit of bitters character. Overall a pretty smooth product, easily consumed, with a nice, straightforward label and well rounded flavor profile. Probably would pair well with a roast pheasant dinner."
"D: I'm not sure if this beer is always supposed to be skunky like this or not, but the skunkiness overpowered the aroma and taste to the point that it was difficult to pick them out."
"D: Very nice import pilsner. fine session beer. Not phenomenal, but worth trying. Just wanted to try something different, this was an impulse beer buy."
"D: Not bad, not great. Would like to try this fresher though."
"D- A good Czech Pilsner. though not necessarily standout in the style."
"For style, I can't say this is one of the better ones I've had. The tastes are just a bit off for me. More crispness and hop character would have been welcomed, and the flavor profile is a little odd."
"D: very typical of a czech style pilsner and a very drinkable beer; that beening said for a beer I have to search all over and fear to find fresh at its price I'd rather buy somthing locally and just as good. A great beer but the availability takes away from it."
"Overall, this is a simple and refreshing beer. Although expensive, it is worth drinking all night."
"Drinkability - Nice tasting beer that i will stock again. Overall, impressed with character this beer brings to the table."
"This beer pours a golden straw color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly but eventually vanishes. The aroma is of faint noble hops, and a little skunk. The taste has some nice bready malt with a hint of hops. Unlike the aroma there is no skunkiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a decent beer, but I doubt I'll drink it again."
"I Did not get any 'floaties' and the head was bone white. An all round excellent pilsner."
"RJT"
"D- This is flavorful, yet different, but has the overall profile of a Czech Pils. It's fuller, but refreshing and I wish this was available on tap at any of the local pubs....it would be a great choice. I would have no problems having an evening full of this brew....I like it and recommend it!"
"D - Good beer. Easy to drink only this in a sitting."
"Drink - An excellent euro lager, probably one of the best I've had from the category. I'd compare this with Pilsner Urquell. A definite session beer."
"Hops are more on the wood/perfume side than the grass/spice. Not hopped up to Budvar, but a good clean Czech pilsener."
"Drinkability -- Not a game-changer by any stretch, but I found it to be pleasant enough. It's more or less on par with the rest of Europe's macro lagers such as Carlsberg or Stella Artois."
"Overall: If you've tried other Czech pilseners, this is worth trying."
"My pour got me two fingers' worth of fluffy, foamy bone-white head with good retention. Color was a pretty, deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Liquid sunshine! Nose had a rich, Saaz-hop grassiness up front, with an underlying lager sweetness. In a CAN!?! I have been missing out with all of the AALs that have been part of this process. Mouthfeel was medium and it had a pronounced molasses flavor on the tongue. Wild! Finish was slightly grassy and bitter, but lingering with a molasses tang. I have this as a ""Gots"" but if I do not get any takers, it will be going into my cooler."
"Nice, a Slovak quasi-tallboy. Doesn't get much better than that, right? Oh, wait, it does: Johnny Cash's ""Hurt"" now fills the air about me. Right on. This bad boy pours a clear pale straw topped by over a finger of quick-to-death white foam. The nose comprises wheat, puffed rice, and a field full o' fragrant flowers. The taste rocks all o' these elements, adding a slight corn-syrup-esque sweetness in the back. The body is pretty light, with a light carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a solid pils; I may not be that big a fan o' this style, but this is pretty good."
"I like this beer. Poured from tap to a 0,5l Zwayt Bazant glass, by the time the beer got to me there was no head so I imagine it fell fast to the thin white film left before me. A clear golden body was shown with a good amount of activity. Smells faintly of malt and hops. There's a sweetness like honey in the beer very malty and a bit filling with slight hop taste as well. I really like the beer. Though slightly filling, I'd happily make a few of these my meal."
"Overall, a good drinker. Not a hint of skunk, even from the green bottle. I liked this as a rep of the style. Pleasant, and enough uniqueness to edge this up. Worth a try."
"This actually surprised me, I have to admit. From the packaging,style and smell, I did not expect to like this one. Oddly enough though, I find it quite drinkable and will look forward to having it again."
"To many, Golden Pheasant may be just another mild, mainstream lager. And it is. But it bears noting that these kinds of beers are so often emasculated and corrupted with adjuncts that to brew an unadulterated and relatively uncompromising example is respectable and virtuous in its own right. Don't be so quick to call this one for the birds..."
"The body was fairly typical for the style, as was drinkability. Overall, except for the skunk, this was a decent litle example of the style. I'd like to try a non-skunked one sometime. Worth trying if you see it."
"The touch of malt in the nose, which inevitably reminds the Czech lager, is pleasant. The body is fairly light, but complex flavors, but it offers a touch of malt sweetness to bring the drink and making it very pleasant to drink. The finish is not powerful, just a slight grassy bitterness (probably due to the Saaz hops) where the side joins the malt side more invigorating hops."
"Overall, much better than expected and i will admit putting this one off for quite sometime. This beer has alot of character for the style, and I would definitely recommend this for anyone who enjoys a tasty pils"
"I had a few of these on my trip and it was never really disappointing."
"If you like a good czech pils this would be the beer for you. I really like the taste of it. It's a little expensive and it is not easy to find. Most stores don't have it."
"D: Drinks quite nicely."
"D - I think the pint 0.9 ounce serving is perfect for this. Very strong flavor and big body, but still very drinkable."
"Cheers!!"
"a decent beer and worth trying, those Slovaks know how to make a decent lager"
"D: Another fine Czech Pilsener. Checks all the boxes and refreshes the drinker. No complaints here."
"Very good beer. Clean and refreshing. The Czechs and Slovaks know how to brew. Like this a little better than Budvar, maybe not quite as much as Urquell. Will definitely drink again. Will search to find this on tap. Will also try in the can, if it available."
"This is one of those beers that I've always seen in the stores and wanted to give it a shot, so I picked one up last night. Poured from the bottle into a Pilsner Urquell stemmed glass. Bright yellow color, decent sized white head, lots of carbonation. A good amount of lacing also. Then you notice that skunky, lightstruck, green bottle smell. Never pleasant, but expected. Taste was pretty average for a pils, clean and nondescript. Mouthfeel was good, it went down fairly easily. Beer seemed to lose that skunky smell ever so slightly as it warmed up to room temp. It's a decent pilsner, but I bet it would be better on tap."
"This has a nice dryness that is very but is also a bit sweet. I get a slight hint of citrus as well."
"Pours pale golden with medium sized white head that recedes to a thin rim, and leaves plenty of lace. Nose is clean with a whiff of fresh white bread aroma. Palate is also somewhat clean with a subdued malt sweetness and crisp hop balance. Very approachable and easy drinking."
"Again with the green bottle, I was hesitant, but It didn't taste skunky at all."
"A decent session beer, but I am sure the Slovaks have better one's they keep @ home."
"A very good pilsner. Crisp and fresh. I think I must have opened a very fresh bottle as it is better than other bottles that I've had in the past."
"Green bottle twist-off from the Slovak Republic. And of course the jipped me of .8 of an ounce of beer. It's an 11.2 ounce bottle. Tarnished brass color and a modest creamy white head. Good clarity and few bubbles rise to the top of the glass. Smells like good quality ingredients were used to brew this beer. Smells like sweet malted barley. Smells just as the best German lagers that abide by the purity law smell. Light and flavorful, sweet carmely malt taste, good carbonation, and a touch of bitter hops in the aftertaste. Excellent beer. Perfect example of a Czech Pilsner. This is what beer is supposed to taste like. The taste, for this style, can not be improved upon."
"A fresh tasting pils that resembles both in design and taste Pilsner Urquel. I liked the clean taste of the finish and decent hopping level of this beer . Put it in tall boy cans ands I would buy it again( most euro pils come in cans in BC). Not a world beater but a quality lager that does slovenia proud"
"Taste is a little flat after the hop zest aroma got my hopes up. Might enjoy this more next time if its sampled in the summer. I could see this enjoyable in a more appopriate season. Its got the lemon tang and whatnot."
"Nothing wrong with this brew, but nothing particularly noteworthy either."
"Overall, decent beer. Best of luck with your beers. Cheers."
"Mouthfeel was OK; about the same as Urquell."
"Not a bad little pilsner. Quite drinkable. For the price, it ain't bad. There's others I prefer, but every once in a while I'll give this Slovak option its due."
"Not my favorite pilsener, but it's alright."
"Drinkability: This isn't bad. On it's own, it might be a little rough for me, but it goes really well with food. I could get this again if I'm in the right mood."
"Pours a clear, golden color. 1/2 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of metallic, yeast, sulfur, and euro pale malt. Fits the style of a Czech Pilsener. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of supfur, yeast, euro pale malt, and slight grain. Overall, an obvisously light-struck beer (at least I strongly hope so)."
"Bought this because I liked the label; very glad I did. Nice and bright golden color, with plenty of rather large bubbles streaming from the bottom-center of my glass. A typically loose and fizzy white head with a brief but happy life releases a nice aroma of flowers, lemons and honey. Clean taste and light body make this very enjoyable; again, lots of flowers and honey with citrus in the taste and a lightly spiced, hoppy sting at the end. The bubbles left little pinpricks in my mouth. Nice! Very much worth your while."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not too bad of a beer and it's worth drinking for a while if your choices are limited, but there are others in the style that I would pick first."
"D - Excellent! Flavorful and refreshing. Definitely have another!"
"Drinkability is average."
"Clean and crackery on the tongue. Crisp and dry at first, a touch of bready malt briefly appears mid-palate before the floral, herbal hop character takes over in the finish. Restrained bitterness, and I must emphasize how remarkably clean this is. Incredibly quaffable stuff, yet subtly complex. One of the better Czech-style pilsners I've had."
"I really enjoy this beer. While it is not my favorite example of the style it definately makes my mouth happy. Very drinkable."
"Taste follows with a lightly sweet orange malt flavor that offers a lingering carbonation on the tongue and a hint of peppery spice. Body increases over time however as the carbonation shrinks somewhat quickly. This leaves a finish that becomes richer with malt flavors though it does refresh nicely with a topping off. Overall pretty good but slightly heavy on the finish."
"It's not a bad lager overall. It doesn't have the character of a good pilsener, which is a shame, but it does end up a fresh, clean and easy-drinking beer all the same. I'm not wowed, but I'm not repulsed either."
"Conclusion: Not a terrible beer, but not my favorite example of the style for sure"
"Mouthfeel is slick and smooth with a nice sizzling texture across the tongue, perfectly crisp and lagery. It's a decent pils but not a fantastic one. More hopping to eliminate that weird sweet peak and bitter up the finish would be more than welcome."
"Drinkability: this has a nice drinkability, much like most lagers."
"Golden Pheasant is a Slovakia Pilsner and an overall good example of a Pilsner. It is easy to drink. My Golden Pheasant was serves in a tall slender Golden Pheasant mug (don't you love proper glassware) filled to the 500 ml mark. It is aggressively carbonated but did not form a persistant head. Easy to drink, interesting malt character for a pilsner. You can taste some hop flavors too. Overall, an excellent, drinkable, wet beer. I order it frequently and enjoy it everytime. Better on draught than in bottles."
"Poured from a green bottle into a weizen glass. Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Has a mild, hoppy aroma. Taste is crisp with some malt and hoppiness. Feels a bit watery in the mouth. Goes down very smooth and easy. Overall a pretty good brew."
"D: I didn't find anything all that special about this. Still, it's fairly well done and a fine session brew."
"Definitely a solid pilsner even if it doesn't quite compete with some of the Czech offerings."
"Well... Not better or worse than any of the Swedish macro lagers. An unnecessary import."
"D: Not the best pilsener I've had (to my taste it lacks some hops), but in the summertime - it's a great thirstquencher."
"poured from a 500ml bottle..a nice clear yellow head with a fresh carbonated head that retains with nice lacing til the end..the smell is crisp with noble hops and malt and biscuits..the taste is a bit thin but it is a easy drinking pils with a crisp noble hop flavor it finishes with some sweet malts ... the mouth feel is crisp an you can drink these all day long.. a nice summer cookout pils or lawnmower beer.. try this one its pretty good! recommended for sure for the summer season"
"The taste gets a bit thin and watery as the beer settles. Right out of the bottle, the beer was quite crisp, had a sharp little hop spicy bite, some definite graininess, husk flavors, and grassiness. The beer is settling in and it is getting smoother, sweeter, a little less spicy, and less interesting. The beer had a certain crisp refreshing taste and has evaporated and I'm getting too much bland, watery sweet malt. The mouthfeel is very light."
"drinkability is good with flavor and as light as this beer is"
"Thus drinkable , enjoyable bt not memorable"
"A decent example of a veritable Czech pilsener from their former (admittedly thrown-together) countrymen, with the normal amount of off-flavours likely due to the stupid green bottle. I can see you under there, my friend, too bad about that other stuff, eh?"
"I just picked up this beer today, just finished it, not too bad, it was not too impressive pouring it, but overall This is a pretty tastey beer. Would like to see what else they put out. It is also My first slovak beer. Overall, I could easily see myself drinking this again, perhaps with a good hearty meal."
"Drinkability: A very good session beer, and my favorite Czech pilsner so far (of which I have had many during my time so far in Slovakia). I do not let this affect my review because that would be unfair, but I would still like to note that this beer improves by leaps and bounds on tap."
"The taste delivers on the flavor I remember, with some biscuit inspired malt balanced nicely with the Saaz or Hallertau or whatever bitter European hops they're going with. The aftertaste is pleasing and slightly warming. A solid example of central European craftsmanship in their signature style."
"I was pleasantly surprised by a good bit of flavor in this beer. It was definitely the best of the round."
"D - The quality, as well as tradition, is evident. Makes a good refreshment and does not leave you thirsty."
"Drinkability: Pretty solid beer. A good representation of the pilsner style. Highly recommended."
"There was no date on the bottle, sorry :-( However there was a code of some sorts (like a bottle cap) but I'm not sure what that meant (maybe I won a hat?)."
"Mouthfeel was zippy and medium bodied."
"This poured a beautiful golden color with a small white head that dissipated quickly to a thin film along the top. Aroma was very nice without a trace of skunkiness to it. Very crisp, very clean, a very well done Czech Pilsener. The drinkability on this one is sky high. I will definitely have again."
"It pours out a nice clear coppery amber with a rather thick, slightly off-white head. The head stays for a bit, a point in this beer's favor. Crisp aroma is fairly strong and has a fruity hint. Flavor is crisp and has a surprisingly strong bitter bite, as well as just a hint of sweet fruit. Texture is smooth and tingly, and aftertaste is somewhat bitter but not nastily so. One of the better pilsners I have sampled."
"Alright, i finally got my hands on this one, so onto to the review! This is a very well done czech pils, the hop bitterness on this is definatly toned down, when compared to Pilsner Uruquell (my benchmark for this style) But none the less this is a terrific beer! Pours out a deep golden yellow color, that is nice and rich, with a small ring of laceing, that holds. Pretty nice! Smell was a bit skunky, so i docked it .5, but otherwise floral hops, and beery smell, decent. Pheasant goes down smooth, with a nice smoothness, and the perfect carbonation. First you feel the carbonation, then the hops finish crisp and clean, no aftertaste. I would of given it a 4.5 but I really like a lingering hop flavor in a nice czech pils, but this didnt, so it gets a 4. Mouthfeel is nice and full, feels like velvet, with good carbonation. Drinkability is amazing with this one, when you want a beer with taste, and something that is refreshing at the same time, and will satisfy you after your done, and you can session it all night long, this is your beer. This is very good beer, and it lived up to my expectations, and what I had been told by friends. Well done! Highly Recommended!"
"Pours a dark gold with a two-finger white head that fades fairly quickly and decent amount of bubbling from the carbonation. Smells strongly of pilsener malts, sweet grass, and light floral hoppiness. No skunking whatsoever. Taste is similar in that the malt is dominant--grain is really the best way to describe it. The light sweetness is balanced by a clean, slightly bitter finish. Nice, thick feel, for what it is. Overall, a pleasant surprise from a beer for which I had low expectations."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a bright wheat color with a 1/2 clean white head. The head settles very quickly into a thin cap leaving no lacing. The aroma is of dry hops, clean malt, with a wonderful balance and a crisp aftertaste. The carbonation is moderate, but tingles in the throat. This is a solid Czech Pilsener...coming from a place where beer is simply beer."
"D - Not bad. I don't like the focus on the pepper notes, but this is a decent example of the style and it might go well with something that compliments pepper... like maybe a ham sammich."
"D - This is a decent pils. Nothing overwhelmingly special but not bad either."
"I have had Pilsner Urquell, but no other Czech/Slovak brews.(Czechvar is on my radar.)Very easy to drink beer with a crisp feel and nice carbonation. No outstanding taste. A good thirst quenching brew."
"Very tasty, balanced, and drinkable."
"The taste is similar, with a lot of honey, herb, some apple, a little toasty bread that becomes more prominent near the finish. It has a nice, very Czech feel, oily yet spritzy-zesty, but is not as oily as some. It starts off lightly sweet but this is increasingly balanced by a light herbal-lemon bitterness that just barely takes over in the very end of the finish. It's flavours are full-bodied and solid, and it has great interplay of textures, flavours, sweetness, and bitterness - a nice, constant balancing act in the mouth."
"The flavors are clean but subdued. Nothing big or unique, pheasant has a crisp flavor and mouthfeel but nothing that stands out. A light bodied beer that is refreshing but is just teetering on the positive side."
"Golden Pheasant poured a nice golden color, however it had only a small head that didn't last at all. Smell was full of strong hops, followed by a light malty sweetness. Taste was crisp malty sweet up front and followed by a slight hop finish. Mouthfeel seemed ok for a pils. Drinkability was very good. Overall this beer is exactly what it should be. A pils with some good flavors, that is very easy to drink. I enjoyed this beer and will buy it again."
"It's not quite Stella Artois, but it is from Slovakia, so I say give it a try and gain bragging rights for your extensive knowledge of Slavic beers (how many other ones can there be?)."
"Drinkability: Easy to down, sure, and it does so without becoming to bland but on the other hand, never really strikes me as something one would truly long for either."
"D- Easy to pound this beer back. A decent sessionable beer. This would be a good beer for the average bud drinker."
"D - This is quite a nice pilsner and definitely worth a try. However, the flavors are so delicate here that having this after any strong flavored beers would be a mistake to appreciate it fully."
"Bottle poured into chalice - thin head, a tad soapy in some areas - a bit hazy - golden thatch in color. Smell fairly clean grain some malt. Taste surprisingly malty for a pilsener hoppy aftertaste. MF - a touch creamy but pretty average body - nicley carbed. Very drinkable - I am generally not a fan of czech pilsener - could easily down a few of these with some salty snacks watching a ball game."
"I loved in Czech for 6 months and this was the most served Slovak beer. Great example of a fine Pilsner. Like may beers in the area it is smooth, very drinkable and has little aftertaste. The translation for the beer is Zlaty Basant. Even though I liked it, there are betetr choices."
"From the ..of the month selection. Didn't think much of it at first, though the label and cap band is a nice touch. Poured yellow gold in the glass with a bubbly clear look and a head that seemed to dissipate quickly. Grassy malt and a hint of hops in the nose, but the taste was surprisngly balanced and refreshing. Nice rounded (even a touch sweet) malt flavor with a fruity hops presence that is both refreshing and yet subtle enough to render the whole beverage extremely drinkable. Perhaps a bit too drinkable. Very nice rendition of the style. Very impressed. Worth trying. Not your usual bland Czech."
"Very good Czech Pilsener."
"Deep golden beer, slightly hazy, small white head..leaves Ok lace. Great strong pils aromas, of grassy hop and considerable malts. Nice semi-sweet maltiness to begin, then a lemon type hop taste, followed by more grassy hopping in the end. Ok on the palate. Not a bad beer..good drinking lager."
"Light-bodied and mellow with very good drinkability."
"D: A big pass here drinkability wise and avoid at all cost. A heneiken by anyother name still drinks the same and wouldn't taint my toilet water with this. (ps i was under the impression heneiken owned and operated this)"
"d: An easy drinking pilsner that goes down like water. But I'm glad I didn't buy more than one because half-way through the bottle I am already bored with it. Not much complexity to this simple and light lager."
"Long live the Bohemians!!!"
"Pilseners are one of my favorite style. This is a great example of a czech pilsener in my opinion. Only price would keep it from being a regular drink.."
"Not bad at all..."
"Bland watery mouthfeel, but overall a good beer."
"*Edit 24 Aug 2009: Tried this again, and I'm upping the mouthfeel score as it's a lot better than that. Crisp yet full in the sense that it brings to mind some pils that were decoction brewed, with good carbonation and a tasty finish that's got a gorgeous, delicate hop character."
"Solid pilsner style beer. Very tasty, One of my favorite European Pilsners. Poured with a nice white head and a bit o lace. Malty aroma with the bitter hop fully present. Some neutral corn sweetness evident. Good finish. For sure a session beer if you're into this kind of beer. Burps too."
"Pours a clear, dark gold color with a 1 finger white head made of little bubbles with good retention and light lacing. The aroma is dominated by malt. Up front tastes of malt and caramel lead to a lemon hop middle with a herbal, tealike finish. Medium bodied, medium carbonation with a creamy mouthfeel. Clean and refreshing but with some deeper flavor than other Czech Pils I've sampled. A great bargain for the $1.59 price."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades slowly and leaves some lace. Clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Grassy nose. Flavor is grassy, some hops with a lingering hoppy aftertaste. Typical Euro pils. $2.15 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"This is a beer made to be consumed en masse. I would have no trouble drinking several. Very refreshing, and great for summer. Also hits a pretty reasonable price point. Beats the crap out of just about all the Euro lagers out there in terms of taste. This beer won't wow you with appearance or nose, and if you're the type who lets a little skunkiness ruin the drinking experience, then this isn't for you. But it tastes good, is quite refreshing, and would pair well with just about any meal. If available, it's a better choice than the more expensive Pilsner Urquell."
"The smell was a bit skunky, but nothing to be upset about. Overall, the drinkability was smooth. I will definitely drink another one of these in the future."
"So-so."
"EDIT: 100th review of this beer. Cheers!"
"Golden Pheasant isn't anything too exciting, but it's a pleasant drinker, particularly on hot days, that comes at a good price and will not leave you wishing you'd bought something else."
"Very minor foggy tone to a straw color. Crème head. Minor cereal nose with a stronger metallic tone. Flavor is tart in a way I don't consider positive. Metallic edge is there, but not the biggest character of the ride. Feel is typical. Overall this is average stuff. There is nothing interesting about it and the metallic and dirty edge just kind of kills it from ever being interesting."
"D -A very average flavored lager. Almost smooth taste w/ subtle European yeast qualities and slightly mineral malt flavor. An ok lager, but one is enough for me."
"Haven't had a lager in months! A pils in even longer. Minimal head and lace, even with the most vigorus pour. Clear faint yellow. ""Skunk"" aroma, but plesant. Classic Saaz hop pils, but VERY refreshing. Some bitterness/metallic as palate goes along. Enjoyable lager, as lagers go (with me anyways.)"
"The taste totally reminds me of a Stella, perhaps a little drier and more bitter. The bitterness is complimented nicely by the taste of sweet malt. I feel as though this is a cross between a Stella and a Victory Lager. This beer would be a great thirst quencher for a nice summer day after mowing the lawn or something. A very drinkable beer that's worth a try, but I think you can get a slighty better experience from Stella Artois."
"drinkability is good. a nice simple pilsener"
"Pours golden with an okay fluffy white head that quickly fades to a thin cap. The smell is lightly grainy, clean, has floral hops and a touch of lager yeast. Not bad. Taste is similar, quite clean with a crisp pilsner mouthfeel, slightly soft, and with noticeable floral hops. Not as robust as most Czech pilsners, but this Slovak version is pleasant enough in its own way."
"The beer poured a translucent gold colour, darker than most North American lagers. The head was quite large and quite dense but disappeared quickly leaving a little lacing on the side. The aroma is hoppy with some yeasty tinges. The mouthfeel is slightly thick with ample carbonation and medium-bodied. The taste is very much pilsener like, but not as good as some of the common Czech Pilseners in my opinion."
"Poured from the 500ml green bottle into a pint glass. Bright golden color in the body, topped by a smallish, creamy white head that doesn't stick around for very long. Aroma of sweet, lightly bread pilsner malt, a touch of spicy Saaz hops, and a little bit of skunk. Palate is a nice balance between light pilsner malt and tangy hops, with a lingering bitterness. Body is nice and well-carbonated, but a strange antiseptic tinge emerges on the finish. A decent, thirst-quenching pilsner."
"12oz green bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a deep golden yellow color with a massive sticky white head. The aroma is malt with some spicy and grassy hops. the taste is malt accompanied by a nice dose of spicy hops and a nice dry finish. Overall, this is a highly enjoyable brew that I will surely revisit in the future. Recommended."
"A decent enough pils..crisp clean but I dont care for this mineral/metallic taste."
"Drinks easy, but a little too subdued to be more than a BBQ beer, although I do like it better than pilsner urquell"
"A superb first act here in the Golden Invitational, and a score that will take some work to overtake. Bavaria's offering will be next at the dish."
"an easy libation"
"vast oceans before it gets to you. Decent."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear, dark-golden color with a two-finger, bubbly, white head. Smell is not very strong, but is sweet with pale malt and grain. The taste is pretty simple, pale malt balanced with a bit of hops, maybe a little spice to it. Pretty average. The mouthfeel is light and has a creamy-foam carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, not bad... I would drink this again but I don't think I would actively pursue obtaining more."
"16.9 oz. bottle- color of clear bright yellow , with a white medium head - nose of hay , slight hopps , banana , sweet corn , and malt  taste of hay , skunk , hopps , and sweet - body well carbonated , and medium acidity  aftertaste of sweet corn , resin bitter , and gummy"
"Medium-light straw with a medium-sized, white, foamy head with good retention. Light, thin lacing. Smell is moderately malty with a light hops balance. Grass, lightly sweet grain, light citrus. Taste is more of the same but with the hops more evident heading towards the finish. Nothing all that complex at all, but clean and crisp and very pleasant. I enjoyed this one."
"The taste also had a hint of alcohol when first poured but again that changed with warming. Some hop bitterness coming through, but not much noble hop flavor that usually accompanies the style. It wouldn't be hard to drink a few of these in an afternoon but its flavor is pretty basic. It drinks smooth and doesn't leave a whole lot of aftertaste."
"Not bad. Decent but basic. All the pieces are in place. Probably great with food on a hot thirsty day."
"A pretty good, if simple, pilsner. Definately fits the style, though I feel it could use a malt boost...very drinkable."
"Golden Pheasant pours a pale straw color with a white head froma a green 500 ml bottle with a foiled neck and cap. The smell is a little skunky at first, but that cleared up by breathing for a few minutes. A mild hop aroma dominated after the skunk cleared. The flavor is mild, not unpleasant, but not exciting either. Fairly well balanced, it's hard to pick out any flavors. Better than a lot of eastern European lagers I've had."
"It's a solid choice when looking for this style and above average for European pilseners. For the past few years, I've been getting this occasionally when I'm in the mood for a Czech-style pilsener, and it's never been a disappointment - never been harsh, metallic or skunked."
"I may have Golden Pheasant again, but I don't think that it will ever be a mainstay in my beer diet. A fairly straightforward pilsner, worth a shot."
"Guess it's ok stuck in the Czech Pilsner sytle...I would have said Euro Pilsner because of the earthy character with a noticable, but mild skunk aroma. Disguised neatly as herbal and must-ey hops, the beer comes across characterful but dirty. A common light yellow and neatly clear hue with adequate carbonation and a lacking head retention. Moderate malt sweetness with a grain quality (expected). Hoppy for sure, but more earthy flavors than balancing bitterness. Feels typically grain-ey, carbonated, and clean, but just slight of refreshing and crisp...just a little to muddy with the hops. Never really got over the pungent aroma and flavor."
"M&D: smooth and semi-clean (not crisp), on the texture, pleasant enough for quaffing in quantity. Yet the flavour profile is slightly too boring, as the hoppy entry only brings aboard its body rather than sufficient flavours, hence a beer feeling better in the end than its overall taste... An O.K. Pilsner-style lager I have to say--NEEDS MORE FLAVOURS!!"
"Would be highly refreshing if chilled on a hot day. Enjoyable."
"Very good beer. Certainly the best from Slovakia."
"D - Easy enough to drink. Not particularly interesting or tasty, but not bad either. I wouldn't be able to spot this one out of a lineup of pale euros and pils'."
" I will attempt to find another bottle and re-review."
"Not much of a nose but the mouthfeel is nice and beads on the palate. very drinkable in that respect. Not acidic. However not much flavour. As the farmer said ""That'll do babe, that'll do."" but not much more. Take it when it's offered but don't seek it out."
"This poured a standard pilsner look, a yellow-orange look with some slight lacing. Smell is actually really good for coming from a green bottle, not a single bit of skunk in the nose. Taste is pretty good, fresh grain with strong bitter hoppy undertones that fade quickly. This is not overly carbonated which makes it a pretty positive drinking experience, and goes down pretty easy. I'd have another if offered, would go well with spicy food."
"Not so bad."
"These questions and more will be answered ...never...or, ...will they?"
"poured a crystal clear golden color with moderate white puffy head that lasted throughout the glass. Smell is a citrus and hoppy. Taste is crisp and refreshing with a slight hop bitterness. Finished more bitter that malty with a touch of citrus. A simple yet refreshing beer."
"(11.2 oz.)"
"D - This is a better pils than a skunky Heineken all the way around. Pilsners are not my favorite style, but once in a while I'll enjoy one. I'd drink this again in a pinch."
"I remember while living in Hong Kong someone visiting had the kindness to bring me a bottle of this and I truly enjoyed it ..."
"I'd drink it again."
"Overall, was OK for a sample, but I will not return for more."
"Decent."
"Light copper in colour and well carbonated. Saaz hop type aromas are dominant, with some light honey-like malt playing a minor role. The body is somewhat thin and watery, but the flavors are alright, with notes of grassy hops, minerals, and light malt. Not quite bitter enough for my taste, and a little on the simple side, but not too bad at all. It compared favorably to the Urquell I had afterwards."
"To those days when we were young and the birds were thick in the cornfields of Iowa . . . Carpe Pheasant - seize the bird."
"It's pretty easy-drinking stuff, but I prefer Topvar."
"The taste is dominated by the herbish green noble hops and complimented by a simple pilsner malt flavor. Nothing fancy, but more generous in flavor than a typical American Pils."
"Color is golden yellow with below average head size. After a tiny initial whiff of skunk, the aroma is of doughy malts with an underlying herbal hop smell. Taste is mainly of malts, not too sweet, with just a tiny bit of spice. Taste is probably more like a euro pale lager than a czech pils. Mouthfeel has an above average crispness and the drinkability is very good."
"Overall impression: A decent pilsner - nothing outstanding. It is being marketed by Heineken as an ultra-premium, and the price tag reflects that. This one was left over from a party, and I won't be seeking out more."
"Golden Pheasant is pleasant enough. If you're looking for an easy drinking, balanced, 'don't want to think too much about it' kind of pilsener brewed in the Slovak Republic (and who isn't?), this just might be your beer."
"12 oz. twist-off green bottle. Pours a typical golden pils color with a fluffy white head. Bready and grainy aroma with a hint of Euro hops. Swayed more toward the malty side for a pilsner. A touch of malt sweetness and crisp and clean throughout, finishing with a faint astringency. Not the best pilsner I've ever had, but not bad either."
"I don't claim to know a lot about Pilseners, but I like this brew, it would certainly fit in as a session beer."
"D-just average or worse. There are many examples of this style that are better not just in drinkability but smell and more importantly taste."
"Bottle: Poured a golden yellow beer with a nice white bubbly head with average retention. Aroma is quite weak but some malt can be detected. Taste is quite crisp with some malt that can be detected and some bitterness at the end. Overall, I would classified this as a better then average pilsner without any watery taste and no skunk taste from the bottle which are two major accomplishments for this type of beer."
"This brew is a pal gold color, with a generous sized white head on the top. Decent lace. It has a bit of that green-bottle euro scent to it, light malts. Light malt front, a bit of bitter hops in the backround, sweet candy. Fairly creamy mouth. This brew isnt horrible, but i cant see a repeat purchase."
"Came in a green 500 ml bottle, gold foil around the neck and cap, small pheasant logo embossed around the shoulder. A classy enough presentation. Pours out a deep clear gold, thick foamy white head with good retention. Sweet malt blended with crisp grain on the nose, along with grassy hops. This is an okay enough tasting pilsener, there are no serious defects, but there is not much character to it either to make it stand out. Husky grains at first, mellowing out in the middle, with a brisk herbal hoppy finish. Quite a bite on the aftertaste as well, the mouthfeel starts crisp, but becomes a bit abrasive throughout after that. The palate and throat feels rubbed raw after swallowing, very akin to sandpaper. Nice looking bottle, but I wouldn't pick up another for casual drinking, I'll be passing on this next time I come across it."
"It pours a nice gold color with a minimal white head and moderate lacing. The aroma is of doughy malts and a fresh mown hay, grassy hop character. The taste is some what watery with a malty beginning and a more hoppy, well rounded middle. The finish is a little slender, with moderate bitterness. This beer is a lot more characterful than maintstream imports like heinekin, grolsch and becks."
"This is probably a bad bottle, but it smells like a disturbed skunk on a hot summer night and the flavor, while not skunky, is not winning me over either. I have tried other Czech pilsners and they were nothing like this beer. Oh the tragedy that I spent money on this beer. I hope my liver and palate forgive me."
"Light, crisp, and actually quite refreshing, this isn't a bad beer, but it isn't a good beer, either."
"Drinkability is decent, but not outstanding. Just above average for style, and certainly worth a try."
"Darker yellow and transparent, huge-bubbled head that has no chance of lasting past a quick photo shoot -- and it doesn't. Laces in thin tendrils, sugary look to them. Grassy aroma, light bit of white pepper. Flavor is skewed in the malty direction, smooth and suggestive of light brown sugar with some slippery graininess that approaches wheat starch in flavor. Arid hops, dried autumn leaves and a little underwhelming in balancing the first impression. Not fizzy, superior to some mass-market Lagers in that sense -- but there's not much else to say other than it is drinkable as a simple brew with a narrow profile."
"Another unimpressive LCBO import. Lighty saaz hopped. Malty sweet, dry and sour finish, creamy. Fizzy carbonation. Floral perfumy. Typical Ontario fare. Very Foamy head on yellow that dissipitates too slowly, not bad drinkable for a pilsner. Mild 4.4%"
"I dont know why i bought this, just the name of the beer seemed really lame. The green bottle didnt fill me with confidence either but this is a pretty decent beer. The appearence is a nice pale amber color with minimal head and good carbonation. Smell was better than expected and the beer went down nicely and tasted just fine. A slightly above average brew thats great for summer."
"Golden Pheasant. What can I say. Though not awful, I won't be purchasing it again. The Pheasant pours a light, pale gold colour with a whopping four finger head!!! After a while, the head creeps down to two, and is finished at 1 1/2. Small rings of lace are left after every sip. Smells a bit funky. Not quite lightstruck skunkiness, but off. Definite spicy hop aroma. Didn't care much for the taste. Perhaps I just don't like the taste of Saaz hops, but I found it lightly skunky again. It was a green bottle, so light would be a problem. But I just find Saaz hops to have that light skunk smell and taste. Their is a bit of spice and malt, even citrus. Overall, it's balanced, but the Saaz hops/skunk is in charge. Mouthfeel is lightly crisp and thin. I guess it's drinkable, but I won't be upset if I never drink another."
"While not the best Czech beer I've had, it's still pretty decent. The head retention was fairly good, with the frothy white head. The head got less frothy after a while, and smoothed out to a laceing that was still pretty thick itself. The initial smell was a little bit of skunkiness, due to the green bottle, but then subsided over time to a grainy/light wheaty smell. The taste had small elements of skunk in it at first, but it went away as well. This gave way to the taste of mild hops and citrus. The mouthfeel was creamy too, so I liked that part. While I look at the other reviews, I think I may have lucked out with this bottle, cause it's previous reviews weren't that great. I really did enjoy this brew."
"Nice golden color with slight carbonation and little head.Slight hop aroma and a slight ""skunkiness"".Average taste-pleasant enough malt flavor with a slight sweetness.Somewhat citrusy.Decent enough mouthfeel.An above average drinkable beer-the slight skunkiness detracts from what would otherwise be a good Pils-the first I have had from the Slovak Republic."
"Light gold in color with a fizzy short-lived head. The aroma is pungent and gross skunk! Yuck! I was hoping I might get a fresh bottle. Aroma is telling me obviously not, and you're an idiot for buying an import that's in a green bottle again. The skunk isn't anywhere near as strong in the flavor as in the aroma. It's still drinkable. The pilsener crispness is there with just enough hops for a slightly fun finish. I imagine this beer would taste pretty good and refreshing while fresh. But I doubt most of these green bottles sitting on shelves for months at a time are fresh."
"A Belgium friend of mine gave me a can of this claiming it was 12% ABV because there was a 12% on the side of the can. There was also a 5% on the side, so I have no idea what the 12% meant. It poured extra foamy, and when it settled it was a mild yellow color. The taste at first was non-existant, but after a few sips, the pilsner style was reckognizable. Quite subtle, slightly citric, this was a beer meant for hot weather or just as a quick refreshener."
"The color on the pour is a limpid deep gold with a generous bright white head that is frothy in texture and the residual lace a quite thin sheet to cover the glass. Nose is citrus crisp, fresh and clean, sweet with the start also sweet and fairly well malted, top is middling in feel. Finish is brisk in its carbonation and the hops mild but pleasant in their spicy bite, quite dry aftertaste, drinkable at any rate."
"Well, judging from some of the other reviews, I must have got lucky and grabbed a fresh bottle of this beer. Poured from a half-liter bottle, this Golden Pheasant had a nice fluffy head with a fairly neutral nose. Crisp and fresh, with a fairly assertive hoppiness backed by a firm maltiness. A dry and just slightly bitter finish aroused my appetite prior to dinner. I would fit this beer somewhere between Pilsner Urquell and Czech(Bud)var. It's not the best, but I found this Pheasant to be worth the hunt, at least when found fresh."
"As middle of the road as you want to get."
"This beer poured a clear, amber color with white foam that settled relatively quickly. The smell was mild, biscuity malt and some floral hops. The taste was modest: biscuity malt and floral hops. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium light body and moderate carbonation. The flavor lingered. The drinkability was good. A decent pilsner."
"Mouthfeel is thin, but the beer is well carbonated. Not one I would choose to drink all night. There are worse Euro lagers out there, but you can also find a ton of better ones."
"The nose does compliment the taste."
"No hop presence to speak of. Nothing special. Worth drinking I guess."
"This brew poured a medium head of fine and medium sized white bubbles. It has a transparent dark yellow orange body. I sensed a nice smooth hoppy flavor that finished dryly. It was smooth and very nice for its style. But just an average beer none-the-less."
"Thx"
"Pours a golden color. The head fizzes away quickly. There doesn't see to be much carbonation in my bottle. Mild aroma of hops and malts. Nothing distinguished stands out. Taste is Fairly mild, with a bit of malts and a slightly bitter finish. Seems to be kind of smooth."
"This lager is brass colored with fizzy, foamy white head and some trailing lace. The aroma is mostly malty with some hops and a trace of alcohol fuminess. Medium herbal malt with an earthy quality. Medium lemony hops. Crisp and clean and only a slight dull aftertaste."
"This brew had a medium head to it and decent lacing. It had a pleasant malty aroma. It had a malty flavor as well. It was gold in color. It also had a sweet taste to it. It had a smooth, creamy taste. To me it had a slight aftertaste as well. Just a so-so beer."
"Just another average Pilsner Style Lager, I would not miss it if I never had another."
"Bright-gold color witha normal hop nose, but ordinary dry hop flavor, just a small amount of malt flavor. Finishes just like it starts with a medium to brief dry hop aftertaste. Good, but lacks the complexity found in outstanding Czech beer. Pretty decent with crusty rye bread and sharp cheese."
"The aroma was quite noticable just upon opening the bottle.  It had a spicey hoppy note that wasn't nearly as evident after pouring.  That was more flat malt, with hints of hops.  Big full head, brilliant clear gold.  Has some nice qualities of many European versions of similar style, but some unusual and less pleasant aspects, such as a real flatness of aroma upon taking a drink (like drinking water), and the finish has a spiciness that ventures into sourness, grassiness and chemical tastes leaving a less than pleasant aftertaste.  Mouthfeel seems a little too flat.  An average overall beer.  Not undrinkable, just can easily do better."
"Straw appearance.  Foamy white head with good retention.  Carbonation is evident.  Aroma is a subtle mix of malt and hops with the malt winning the battle. If you're looking for a European Pilsner without the big bitter factor, this is it.  It's a very pleasant tasting beer.  Nice malt base.  Very subtle hop nuances.  A slight citric twang and maybe a little metallic.  Thinnish body and fairly low carbonation.  Very easy to kick this one back.  Gotta love the name too."
"Brilliantly clear golden in hue, covered by a persistant, thick white head.  Dense lace leaves a solid ring per sip.  The aroma is mellow overall, being comprised of light straw - like pilsner malt and a soft lemony and spicy hop nose.  The typical Saaz grassy spice is subdued and perhaps blended with with Tettanger.  Residual sweetness and light bready base malt notes dominate the flavor profile as a result of the subpar hop bitterness.  Although mild, hop flavor is a touch grassy.  Moderately bodied.  Finishes w/ fading sweetness and a hint of dimethyl sulfide.  Golden Pheasant is a decent pils, but lacked sufficient hop backbone to support malt sweetness.  The cooked veggie note in the finish hurt the drinkability."
"A simple lager, tasty without any complexities. Pairs well with any kind of smoked sausage, I had mine with some smoked sausage and slaw."
"From the Slovak Republic: half liter brown bottle.  Golden Pheasant is a golden lager, with a nice, tall, firm head.  Had a slightly malty taste.  Crisp, not overwhelming taste.  I’ll buy several more, as this is what an American Macro is supposed to taste like, good basic drinking brew."
