"I thought this beer was quite drinkable, and it had a bit more up-front flavor than some Pilsners I've had. I tried a few different Josephsbraus since you can make your own six-pack at Trader Joe's. I didn't care for a couple of the others, so my expectations were probably pretty low. Not sure if I'll buy it again, but I would certainly grab one from a cooler at a barbecue or picnic."

"For a Pilsner I'm pretty impressed. Is has more flavor than your typical mass produced Pilsner. If you want to step up to more taste without taking the plunge on a heavier darker beer or IPA, this is a great start. Overall a solid beer."
"All the right components, but rough around the edges. This doesn't sit well up front but has a nicer finish.  It's just a smidge too bitter perhaps?"

"Not hoppy but bitter. Sparkly.  Honey golden yellow."

"Overall - Decent Pilsner. Nothing to write home about. Maybe a decent gateway beer for macro drinkers?"

"My bottle had a different label, but i'm not sure if that means I had a newer version of the beer."

"O: PLZNER is another high-quality, low-priced TJ beer that really delivers the value. A few little tweaks to decrease the sweetness and moderate the bitterness (which is too sharp and needs to be softer), and this would be an excellent example of the style."

"Now, as a German Pils, it's again not bad at all. It's got lots of Noble hop bitterness and the tartness I expect, but it's lacking enough Pils malt flavors to make it keep it from being a one note wonder. It's definitely a ""a celebration of noble hops."" Yet it's not much more than, though. On the back label on the bottle it says it's 32 IBUs, which is again what it tastes like, which is a now what most German Pils' are. Again, it's not bad, but not up to the standards of the beer I've been drinking from Franken and from other Bayernbiere. A 3.5 of 5."

"Overall it's refreshing enough, not TJ's best but drinkable."

"Best before date 5/20/14 so it was pretty fresh."

"Overall: Sadly, I only had one at my disposal or I probably would have had 4 or 5. It's low enough in alcohol content to be a very sessionable beer, but doesn't overpower the palate to the point where you only want to have one or two. It's light, crisp, refreshing and has a perfect balance of flavors for this style. I'm really impressed."

"half a good beer, with a good price. ill probably grab it again."

"I'd gladly drink either of these tasty beers again, but, if given a choice between the two, I'd reach for a PLNZR."
""
"Overall: A decent enough pils. As always, Trader Joe's has a great price/value for their store brands."
""
""

"It's unbalanced but more than drinkable."

"Not my favorite Czech Pilsner, however it is refreshing for a summers day."

"O: Very mediocre, expected more even from Trader Joe's brand"
"A clear golden yellow with about one finger of paper white foam that fell quickly but left behind some sheeting action. The nose is of cereal-like grains and crackers, with some floral and grassy hops over top. Floral hops pounce on the palate first with crackery and sweet cereal-like grains through the middle. A little bit of a vegetal character before a finish of toasted malt and grassy bitterness. Light body with moderate carbonation. This beer is a little messy, moving from flavor to flavor without any real transitions. There are much better pilsner options out there. This is largely average at best."
""

"O: This beer is rather easy to drink. It would have been nicer if there were more malts in the taste to balance off some of the hops."
"O: This beer seems dark for the style, at least much darker than the majority of the others in the style I have tried. The beer is not bad but not great either - probably a decent choice when you factor in the price."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a light yellowish golden amber with a thin film of head that dissipates immediately to a ring around the glass. Mild aroma of bready malt and grassy hops. Flavor is mild biscuit malt with light lemon, finishing with a somewhat astringent dry grassy hops. Not a particularly pleasant flavor transition nor well balanced. Light bodied with good carbonation. Most the Joseph Brau beers have been uninspiring but pleasant to drink. This one is miss for me."

"Much more bitter than expected, and with more caramel malt character. There's a metallic flavor that emerges as it warms."
""

""

"A bit one-note I suppose, but this is quite a refreshing and carefully constructed lager and an excellent value."
"Taste is a nice combo of grainy malts with a herbal, grassy hops. Not bad..this is one of the more affordable pilsners out there and it is better than 60% of the imports that are more expensive. I like it, but unfortnately a TJ is about 30 miles away!"
"D- Not great, but definitely drinkable."
""

"Mouthfeel is pretty good as well- light body, moderately full carbonation, some residual sweetness and grassy hops in the finish. Hell, this is a damn good beer for $6.49 a sixer, and even not considering the price I like it for an American pilsner. I've never quite been able to put my full support behind Prima Pils. I think I'll get this one many more times considering this price and worthy taste."
""
"Offers a decent feel and carbonation. Bit sweet and neutral in delivery and with a light hop presence. Bit nondescript overall."
"Not a bad beer overall. A decent, refreshing pilsner. Great for the summer."
"O -- When I first grabbed this beer I was afraid it was just a re-labeling of the Josephsbrau Bohemian Lager, but this is a much nicer brew. While not so much Czech as German in its Pils character, it's a great rendition of the style from a US micro. Very easy-drinking and perfect on a warm summer day."
""
"O - Overall, it's not the greatest Czech Pilsner out there, but it's pretty hard to complain when a sixer runs what BMC type stuff does. Definitely a good value."
""
""
"O: Pleasantly surprised, to say the least. Tastes like a ten dollar a six pack beer. Instead, only 5.50. Damn."
""
""
"The body was mostly the expected clean crispness of the style, but the finish was a bit on the sticky side. Drinkability was OK, I'd have a couple under the right circumstances. Overall, a decent enough brew, especially at the price point it's at. Worth grabbing a sixer for a cookout at the park, or to use as a training wheel beer to get someone away from the bland mainstream beers."
""
"D - Not really the best pilsner out there. The grain flavor is flat and a bit sour, totally lacking in pilsner malt depth. The hops have a significant presence, but they are almost more British than German in character and do nothing to help the already harsh malt character. Not one of my favorites."
"The mouthfeel was medium with lively carbonation. With the Trader Joe's label one automatically thinks ""cheap"" but this is a solid Czech style pilsner in my book."
"Overall: Nice full flavored malted beer but fairly simple."
"I really think this lager should be considered an American adjunct lager. It is not a bad brew, but it just reminds me of an American adjunct lager. There is a lack of saaz hop spiciness that I always look forward from this style of lager. But for the price, I think it puts most American adjuncts to shame."
"This pours a clear golden color with a generous cotton-billowy layer of foam. Looks great! But the aroma disappoints. It’s there, but nothing stands out. Where are my grassy Saaz hops? Flavor is more, er, less of the same. It’s all sort of meh, middle-of-the-road, not horrible but not something I’d pick up for myself again. Seems consistent with the other Josephbrau offerings I’ve tried however."
"Overall: this beer is nothing to brag about. It is not the beer I'd offer to my best friend or to my worst enemy. However, it is rather refreshing - it's a good beer for a cool evening during an early spring when you're sitting inside unwinding but still have a to-do list to conquer by the end of the night."
"Overall: A decent take on a European Pilsner. Sweet but not overly sweet and has a decent body for the style."
"This is a nice American version of a Czech pilsner."
"O- Not good."
"D"
"Poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This Czech Pilsener poured a golden clear color, produced a average white head, average retention and a nice amount of lacing left behind. The aroma consisted of sweet malted grain. Moderate body this Pils has a base flavor of sweet malt, baked bread and hops. Overall, its merely an average example of a Czech Pils- if our on a budget its a nice value, but I wouldnt seek this one out. Prost!"
"O: A good beer but there are better examples of Czech pils out there. Not a big fan of this beer but I would not turn others away from it."
"The aroma is plain with just malt and grassy hops. The appearance is golden with an average head for the style. The taste is like the aroma with a noticeable bitterness but not bad at all. The palate is typical for the style. Overall a pretty good beer."
"O: Despite the low cost (about $1/bottle) this is a disappointing offering not worthy of a recommendation."
"Pours a clear gold with a 1 inch foamy white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt/grain and some slight vegetal aromas. Taste is of malt/grain, grassy flavors, and an herbal hop finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a light carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average pilsner but nothing too offensive."
"12 oz bottle from Trader Joe’s. Pours deep golden with a short-lived, white head. Nice aroma is of pale malt and grassy hops. Medium, slightly crisp body. Earthy hops are balanced by biscuit malt and grapefruit on the palate. Long, bitter finish. Well done Pils."
""

"Slightly disappointing, as don't feel as though it is as good as some of the other Josephbrau offerings. But at $6/6pack, not a horrible value."
"o: While there was some diacetyl in the aroma and flavor, it was within the style guidelines. The malt aroma and flavor was pleasant. However, there was not much of a noticeable hop aroma (should be spicy) in either the smell or taste. This aroma is necessary for this style. Also, there just seemed to be too much astringency which made the bitterness sharp. The astringency can be avoided by making sure your ph does not get too high when sparging. Also, the astringency could be related to leaving the hops in the boil for too long."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A nice pilsner - good flavor and smell but a tad disappointing in regards to appearance. Nice to see the Czech/German hops typical for this style so well represented with this beer. Went quite well a meal (Sicilian corkscrews & beans) and would go well with a lot of other food as well. Good drinkability as well, I could have another without hesitation."
"O: Disappointing since the last few TJ's beers I've had have overperformed. This is OK, tastes like a lower end import in the end."
"Is it a great beer? No. Am I unhappy that I spent six dollars on the six pack? Nuh-uh. Will I buy another one? Nope."
"Apparently a Gordon Biersch product. Ohio state liquor board lists the Josephs Brau beers under GB. Reminds me of GB Golden Bock though scratchier."
""
"T: Very smooth bready malts upfront with a trace of grassy and resinous hops in the back. A faint but lingering hop bitterness on the finish. To be honest, this beer was close, but didn't quite have the style down. The malts are there but the hops don't shine enough to give it that refreshing bite that good czech pilsners have. Still not a bad beer though and maybe my favorite of the josephs brau offerings."
