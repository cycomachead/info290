Lacing and retention are both actually quite good for the style. The aroma is absolutely huge on zesty noble hops, with pale malts and some wheatiness backing it up. The taste is a bit lacking. It comes on fairly strong with some nice noble hops over some subtle malts, but the finish brings in strongly astringent citrus and something that just tastes a little bit sour. It's close, but not quite. It's basically lacking the great balance that's the hallmark of a good pilsner. The mouthfeel is a bit thicker than the average pilsner, and highly carbonated. The drinkability suffers a lot due to the poor aftertaste and relative thickness. Overall, this was just barely an alright pilsner. I've had a host of better ones.","shand","Apr 09, 2011"

Anyway, this stuff pours a clear pale straw topped by a finger of stark white foam. The nose comprises wheat, mild chalk, sweet flowers, and a light touch of banana peel. The taste follows this recipe pretty closely, but then brings in some light corn, hard water, and light orange rind. Things were going so well, too... The body is pretty light, with a very light moderate carbonation and a crisp finish. Overall, I'd basically classify this as a pils that was almost good.

The flavor is somewhat thinner than the aroma, but still malty and sweet with a crisp finish and a surprising bitter bite on the back of the tongue. The one thing that keeps it from breaking into the outstanding ranks occupied by American Pilsener standouts such as Victory, Troegs, Sly Fox and a few others is the hop flavor - the hop bitterness is nice, but the hop flavor is a bit thin and slight.

The flavor offers a healthy dose of grainy malt infused with grassy hops, and livened by a thread of yeasty fruitiness. A firm bitterness lies beneath, revealing itself at mid-palate, and then fading fairly readily in the finish, leaving behind a dull, acrid note amidst some fading, lightly-honeyish malt.

I dont care for the nose, too acidic, oddly sweet with not enough Pils-malt characteristics. The aromas arent detestable but theyre not inspiring either. In summery then, the bouquet is par for the course but I fancy more. Not inviting then. The palate tastes like what the nose indicated. Thats too bad! Firm lemony acidity mixed equally with a buttery twang. Mild bitterness in the middle, the finish is the home of the malt, weak and not crisp or flavorful. Not biscuity either. Mildly sweet. There is a slightly flowery taste after the swallow. The palate, overall, isnt great but it isnt bad either. There is enough taste so I cant call it boring. The flavor profile doesnt jive with me, too buttery, too sweet, and too acidic. Some people may like it; Im not one of them. Medium in body, mushy mouthfeel because of the low carbonation, this aspect of the beer needs improving. It is not Pils-like, as it needs more zip and crispness. This would be a good beer for the macro-lager crowd or after mowing the grass. This is nothing Id buy again. I have little leeway when it comes to Pilsners, they have to be brewed to near perfection or Ill think they are too flawed and then pointless to drink. This one falls into the latter category. It was purchased as part of a sampler-pack in Milwaukee, WI.","bditty187","Aug 06, 2004"
3.92,14.3,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Straw yellow body with a clingy white head. Not overly impressive looking. Smells of clean, light fruit malt, and sulfurous, spicy hops. Taste is a nice surprise. Light fruity sweetness up front, followed by surprisingly big hops. Bitter with a peppery spiciness. Light, crisp, refreshing feel and quite drinkable.","alexgash","Aug 01, 2004"
3.92,14.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A little watery upfront but develops very well. Malts are doughy and sweet, but overtaken by the assertive hop bittering. Cleans out and leaves a nice long bitter finish.","sweethome","Jul 18, 2004"
3.85,12.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Not a favorite style of mine, so I probably won't revisit this, but do recommend it to those so inclined.","feloniousmonk","Jun 26, 2004"
3.83,11.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Slight hazed dusty gold color, tall frothy white head, immediate distinguishes to a skimming and the lace sticks in some strings and spots. Aroma is dullishly sweet with a pale biscuit-like maltyness, clean, crsip, a bit of grassy spiced hop profile underneath. Taste is pretty good, crisp, clean, nice balance of slightly sweet and pale malts, white breads, and a lightly spiced hop with a bit of grassy tone to it. Feel is about medium with a lighter carbonation yet crisp and semi-bold, dryish finish with some sticky sweetness residuals leftover. Not a bad brew at all, a nice drinker from the folks at Lakefront.","tavernjef","Jun 07, 2004"
3.08,-10.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours a rich golden colour...maybe a pinch darker than most Pilsners. The nose was light and mildy floral with a hint of citrus. The taste was fairly light and mild with minimal hoppiness and some grainy notes down the middle. Again, a hint of citrus fruit which was a little different for a Pils. Overall a very smooth and drinkable beer but not really a top choice in terms of a pilsner.","Popsinc","May 22, 2004"
3.13,-8.7,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Darker than gold, clear as a bell appearance. Pale head is down to a spidery skin in 20 seconds. In contrast, it laces well, in broad dripping rings. Aroma is very sweet, almost seems like it has estery qualities with marshmallow characteristics. The flavor follows suit, sweet and cotton candy in tone, just a lightish bit of lemon, and an early-asserting but fairly weak peppery hop balance. Mouthfeel is close to medium and seems fairly flattish. Could be less sweet and fruity, and more crisp and sharply attenuated to be a good one for me.","ADR","Mar 27, 2004"

4.05,18.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The smell brought in a nice aroma of flowery (Hallertau?) hops. The initial taste was of subdued maltiness, but with a pleasant hop bitterness (Saaz?). Kind of a light body, but thoroughly refreshing. The finish was good, and it beckoned the tongue for more! Quite a drinkable beer--definitely one for a warm summer day.","RedBaron","May 24, 2003"
4.3,25.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Klisch pours a clear golden color with a bubbly white head. Active carbonation is present, and rings of lace develop down the glass. Very nice. Nose is dominated by grassy, earthy Saaz hops, although mild yeast and caramel-like aromas are present, too. Taste is an amalgam of bready, earthy, spicy flavors. The balance between the Saaz hop character and the bready malt is very nice. Notes of lemon rind are also present. This is a light-bodied, crisp and flavorful pilsner. Refreshing and quite drinkable, this is an excellent thirst quencher on a hot summer day.","Jon","Mar 13, 2003"
4.05,18.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Klisch: This is one terrific pilsner beer from Lakefront brewing company. The appearance is a deep gold color, with very nice clarity. The head was unimpressive though, with a mere bit of lacing down the side. The aroma is smooth and very clean. The taste, as already noted, but worth repeating, is very nice. Sweet light malts are the dominant taste, with slight cracker like aftertaste. Very light hop taste as well. This is very light in body and exceptionally easy to drink. Look for this, because it will make your day after a hot afternoon working in the yard.","jackndan","Jan 28, 2003"
3.88,13.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Beer gets is name from the Lakefront owners, Russ & Jim Klisch. Pours a clear dark golden color with a foamy white head that fades fast. Aroma consists of spicy hops, bready malt and a little bit of yeast. Mouthfeel has a nice hop and carbonated "bite" to it. Definitely some body, unlike most American Pilsners. Taste consists of malt, spicy hops and barley. Finish is sharp and has a pronounced bitterness to it from the Saaz hops. A finnicky style now-a-days that can be a difficult one to please most people with, but Lakefront does a pretty good job of tackling it here.","Winter","Jan 03, 2003"

4.38,27.7,2.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured out of the bottle and into a pint glass (from the brewery) this golden, almost straw colored beer has cloudy appearance and herbal hop aroma. A lot of carbonation with a lot of foam. It isn't assertively hoppy for a pilsner, but has pleasant herbal hop flavor. Not too much bitterness. Very smooth, fresh malt backbone making for a nice smooth, medium-bodied beer.","marcobrau","Sep 25, 2002"

4.44,29.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer is actually a little hazy. Not right for a pilsner. Nice straw golden hue though, and a nice white frothy head. Really nice blend of spicy noble hops and pilsner malt on the nose with an additional subtle perfumey/minty aroma. There's a nice little bitter bite to this beer. I like it. There's a definite European slant to this pilsner. The taste really appeals to me. Good pils malt base. Various floral, herbal and spicy hop notes dance on top of that. And a lingering bitterness puts the capper on this full bodied lager. The hop qualities really appeal to me in this one. Another nice offering from Lakefront.","Bighuge","Beers"
