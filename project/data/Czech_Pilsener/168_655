Taste is almost nonexistent on the front end, consisting of carbonation and an indefinable something that's technically not nothing. Some honey-like sweetness emerges in the finish as you're still racking your brain to determine if you actually tasted anything at all. While the modicum of flavor that exists is not offensive, it's so mild that it's bordering on seltzer water. Even an American light macrobrew has bolder flavor than this. I'm an admitted skeptic of Pilsners to begin with, and this certainly does nothing to champion their cause.","MaximalC","Jan 03, 2013"

3.37,0.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"The brew pours a super-translucent golden hue and is capped with a modicum of white wispy head. The nose is herbal and a bit grassy, and has a mineral-metallic note underlying. There's also a soft powdery note in the aroma. The flavor is quite grainy and slightly sweet; it is mostly pleasant, but gets a bit of rankness on the finish. Feel-wise, it is lighter than medium and softly carbonated; pretty good overall. Though it is decent, it is definitely not a top-tier Czech Pils; I'd take, say, Staropromen over this any day of the week.","ktrillionaire","Sep 25, 2011"

Light orange liquid, not pale, transparent with very mild visual distortion, a few scattered bubbles here and there. The nose has a nice liveliness to it, lots of all kinds of bread, like one big marble loaf in your nostrils, sweet golden honey accents, general maltiness then more salt 'n' pepper than herbaceousness, tame mixed white fruits, it seems like it aims to mix things together like a stew than let the elements stand apart. Medium-bodied, strong through the attack before relaxing and just letting it flow, unfold as it wants. Honey, molasses and caramel very obvious while displaying restraint when needed. The breadiness is more doughy than yeasty and had the crust cut off. A few corn notes. The carbonation somewhat lowgrade, not a deciding factor. More floral than fruity or citrusy. Hops bring tingle to the finish so it does end on an up note.","farrago","Oct 14, 2010"

Some pine, lemony citrus cut nicely by a spicy hop bitterness and yesty fresh baked bread and sweet toffee like malts. Good sharp carbonation makes for a crisp and refreshing mouthfeel. Maybe just a little metalic skunky aftertaste comes out, but not bad. Overall very clean and skunk free. Probably the least skunk filled European lager I have ever had.

Hop flavor is also quite restrained, there's a little earthy character. The finish is solid, a touch of bitterness appearing initially before a strange medicinal astringency appears. The sulfur character grows as it warms. Just a little thin and watery for my liking, the body could use a little more heft. Drying on the finish, this is an easy to drink beer, one that I'd like to try fresh.","DefenCorps","Nov 16, 2009"

Pale malty flavors. Vaguely metalic and a lot of floral, aromatic hops. Noble hops (saaz I'm sure) dominate the palate. Slight bitterness keeps the beer refreshing throughout drinking it, along with the fairly high amount of carbonation, giving it a sharp ""nip"" when you swallow each gulp. Drinks easy.

It's light in body, but slightly oily, well-rounded in fel with lively, zesty frothiness, a very nice texture.

The flavor is well balanced with a light, grassy bitterness, notes of lemon and pretzels, and a hint of sweet malt. It's better than most European Lagers I've had.

In the nose it's mildly hoppy with a light dose of malts - not too aromatic, but pleasant. Tastes of nice noble hops and a bit of sweet malts. Grassy and spicy, with light lemon and pine, a little doughy, with a near medium bitterness on top of a light, dry body that has a lightish, hoppy finish.

Some hop bite was noticable along with some metallic flavors which lasted into the aftertaste.

And it sure isn't hard to produce a head in a pilsner glass. Secondly, it just reminded me of something that you would buy in 30 packs at the grocery store for $8.99.
