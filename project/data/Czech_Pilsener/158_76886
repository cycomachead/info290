Aroma classic pilsner, crisp & dry, clean bready grain, lemon,  grassy hops. Taste is  grain/pale malt, cracker/biscuit,  lemony, grassy noble hops, peppery finish with a heavy & lingering bitterness. Dry, clean & very drinkable. Very pleasant, but an overly bitter example of the style. But what the hell, I crave the bitterness of Noble (Saaz) hops & don't care.","mothmanscott","Jan 06, 2015"

Soon, I had two-plus fingers of solid, bone-white head with good retention that resembled the top of a vanilla ice cream cone. Color was an ever-so-slightly-hazy pale lemon-yellow. Nose was crisp with the Saaz hops front and center in evidence. Now this was what I was looking for! Mouthfeel was soft, not an overabundance of carbonation in the mouth and the taste was a good commingling of the grassiness of the hops with the counterbalance of the malt.

A touch of sweetness, mildly corn-like, right before the strong, bitter finish. Light in body with crisp carbonation, this is quite refreshing on the palate. The flaws of the nose aren't as apparent on the palate, with the metallic character not quite noticeable.

The nose is a blend of pilsner malt, earthy hops, and a bit floral. The flavor builds on the nose for a nice flavor: pilsner malt base from which the earthy hops lay a mild bitterness, lemon and honey sweetness provide a hint of sweetness to balance. Very nice. Finishes with a mild bitterness and lingering lemon sweetness. Better than anticipated. Lighter end of medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this was a treat if a surpise.

It's a bit hoppier than more pilsners from Bohemia, but it's not as hoppy as a number of American versions, such as Victory's Prima Pils or Avery's Joe. I'm sorry to hear this is a seasonal.

Aroma earthy herbal citrus notes with a mild grassiness amongst a pale malt breadiness that just works. You may call it one dimensional but I think it's great. Flavor has adequate bitterness, fresh green hops a bit of sulfur/skunkiness going on but it's muted nicely an citrus lemony herbal grassiness. Pale malts provided a toasted biscuit sweetness that really works, finishes dry with each sip. Mouthfeel is crisp clean unadulterated good drinking lager, lighter bodied with sturdy carbonation.

The flavor is mixture of sweet and bitter. The sweetness comes in first and just before it takes over the hops come in and provide some bitterness. Lively mouth feel from the carbonation and a nice thicker body for a pilsner than I am used to, another pleasant surprise. Overall, this beer is pretty good.

3.68,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I bought a sixer because I am trying to broaden my palate when it comes to lagers and pils seems to be a style I like. I don;t really have a frame of reference in regards to Czech or German pils so I can't say which one this is more like. It was bright yellow, fizzy (the horrors), and looked good. Aroma was a bit of minerals and smelled decent. Flavor was crisp, mineral, nice lager flavor. I really need to buy more lagers so I can describe the flavors better, they seem so much more subtle than ales.","ArrogantB","Jan 08, 2012"
