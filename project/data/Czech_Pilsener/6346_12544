If they fix the carbonation, and I'd say it is probably the best. I honestly feel bad that King doesn't appear as successful or widely distributed then it currently is. This one steps up to the plate where it really matters and I could drink this all day as a stand alone drinker or with spicy food because of it's cleansing crispness.

4.01,5.2,4,3.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Final Grade: 4.01, an excellent A-. King Brewery's Pilsner is a solid pale lager, and easily one of the best locally-made pilseners available in Ontario. The robust malt flavours are balanced nicely by the impressive noble hop bill, and the end result is a deliciously drinkable brew that is guaranteed to appeal to any fan of imported Euro pilseners. This brewery seems to focus mostly on brewing German-style lagers - a job they do damn well, I might add - but this Czech-style pilsner is probably my favourite of their three 'flagship' year-round offerings. I'll definitely be trying this again at some point in the future, and would encourage all pale lager enthusiasts to consider this one well worth seeking out.","thehyperduck","Apr 23, 2013"

2.43,-36.2,2.5,2,2.5,3,2.5,"Was interested in trying this as it has some interesting reviews and its average score places it near the top of the pilsener style but I'm here to knock it down a bit cause I just don't see it. Simple appearance, generally what I would expect from a macro. Smell is pretty muted, sweet bready malts, but not too much coming through. Flavour is subtle with that same malt character and a light citrusy saaz like hop character. Refreshing, in a simple way. Light weight feel on the palate. Overall, nothing I would seek out again. If it were a macro, I'd give it top scores in that vein.","Ardon","May 10, 2011"
3.75,-1.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall- This one ranks right up there with some of the best of them, although I would have liked to see a bit more on the taste aspect, it’s very much dominated by the bready malts and not much of the other smells that you get really come through on the palate. Happy that I got to try this one because without the OCB 6-pack I probably would have overlooked this one and not even given it a try, but I could definitely see myself enjoying this one this summer while relaxing on the patio.","Roke87","Apr 04, 2011"

3.61,-5.2,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"King Pilsner could better distinguish itself from other mediocre, mainstream lagers on the market by boasting about its specially imported Czech ingredients (namely, the hops) less on its packaging and more in its beer.

3.85,1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours yellow and light golden colour, soapy white head rises and falls leaving an etched surface. Solid ring, some slippery lace, medium carbonation, bubbles a bit larger than I prefer. Grassy, skunky smell rings true to the Czech style, hoppy . Taste is sharp and crisp, nice bitterness, dry with huge malt aftertaste that lingers. Light to medium body, I've heard some say this might be the best Ontario brewed pilsner and I think you could make an argument that it's among them. Classic pilsner, nicely done, I'd drink this anytime.","ThatWineGuy","Jan 05, 2010"

The dedication of importing the correct malt, hops and yeast from the Czech Republic allow this beer to stand proud beside other great brews.

4.07,6.8,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Taste is a bit nutty, with a spicy pepperiness in the front. Light malt sweetness, apple-like, lots of grassy and floral notes, and a very forward bitterness that leaves you craving the next sip. Aftertaste is full of the spicy and floral Saaz flavour that I certainly crave from time to time. This is a well-balanced pilsner, very enjoyable, and has a lot of flavour going on. Mouthfeel is nice an soft but finishes good and dry thanks to the generous hop profile. Carbonation is mild and undistracting. A solid pilsner, one I'm thankful to have had, and one I'll seek out on tap when I'm in Southern Ontario again.","trevorwideman","Sep 04, 2005"
4.05,6.3,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This was an unfiltered sample on-tap at Volo in Toronto. This beer is very similar to the standard offering, but the hop character is much stronger and it's slightly hazy. The aroma is very floral with plenty of saaz hop goodness and the contribution of hops to the flavour is much stronger. Overall, I enjoyed this version more than the regular version... just a little more punchy with the hops and really nice balance. I'd drink this anytime.","DrJay","Jul 02, 2005"

The carbonation is quite active and the bubble are like pin pricks (a good sign I hear). The aroma is of grassy saaz hops, a grainyness and crackers. The taste is quite a lot hoppier that Urquell or Bitburger. Pine, eucalyptus, and saaz sea air hop flavors are very prominent. The malt background is very grainy with huskyness. The hops impart a fantastic bitterness that coats the mouth. The finish is very bitter. The mouthfeel is quite full bodied. Light carbonation seems to accentuate the hoppiness.
