I have been living in the Czech Republic for nigh on ten years and once upon a time a Gambac would come with a great frothy head that clung to your nose, and further beers would be on the way before the first was finished.

3.7,8.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Anyway, this is a typical Czech brew. It's light in color, with a nice head (i had it on tap as well). A bit darker than Budweiser and Urquell. Taste was a bit less sweeter than those other two. Had some crispness to it. This was one of the better beers I had over there, and since I'm not a pilsner kind of guy, I drank this one a lot.","Mebuzzard","Nov 05, 2006"
3.97,16.8,3.5,4,4,3,4.5,"Like others have commented, a popular beer in the Czech Republic due to good taste and ease of drinking. I'm sure that it helps that it's also significantly cheaper than Pilsner Urquell both in the bottle and on tap. Worth a try but not necessarily worth making a huge effort to seek out. If you come to the Czech Republic, you'll probably drink it.","friendofthedevil","Sep 07, 2006"

3.3,-2.9,3,3,3,4,4,"Poured with huge head, crystal clear body. Great lacing. Clean mouthfeel, epitamy of easy drinking. Not much at all in terms of arom, oh well. Some light hop bitterness and sterm malt profile stays unobtrusive to the smooth, gentle mouthfeel. Would be very interesting on cask. I, personally, would prefer to big brother Pilsner Urquell. A good true Czech pilsner, far above anything you'd find domestically here in Ontario.","biegaman","Apr 14, 2006"

3.65,7.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"You have to be 18 (US citizen: 21) to visit Gambrinus' website. Couldn't find anything harmful there, though. I have a soft spot for thirst quenching Czechs which probably makes me overrate this beer a little. It pours with a finger of foam and has a nice, golden color. There is a strong bread aroma (which I also like), some hops and a little sourness. The taste is dry, malty and bready with some saltiness. In my opinion it's better than average but not in the premier league.","JanM","Aug 07, 2005"

3.33,-2.1,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"It pours a rocky and foamy white beerhead, settling rather fast to a thin layer of medium bubbles... golden/light honeyish colour; medium-rich carbonation. The nose is very softly malty with light, lime-like fruity hops and soda-biscuit and dough's softly sour note. On the palate, again a lot of soft malts arrive in full force, with a light, delicate hop flavour at the back--no particular bitterness detected in the finish, while chewy, bready flavour is more noticeable towards the very end. It's basically a thin-bodied, mild-flavoured pilsner, with a bit of watery mouthfeel in the end. Straight-forward and much more boring than Pilsner Urquell, albeit very thirst quenching especially when served on tap.","wl0307","Mar 28, 2005"

3.18,-6.5,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Draft, St. Petersburg, Russia. A bit more substance after all the Russian lagers Ive been swilling. Good fluffy head that leaves a little lace. Golden pilsener color. A bit of extra sweetness, but the European hop profile makes a valiant effort to balance it.Still, a great pilsner beer smell I could pick up from two feet away made a good first impression on me.","DrunkMcDermott","0"
3.87,13.8,3.5,4,4,3,4,"Pours a darkish clear gold under a firm two finger white head that fades fairly quickly to thick patchy film and leaves some spots of lace. Sweet grainy malt nose with a twinge of metal-fruit hops. Very highly carbonated and fairly light in the mouth. Open features a good strong malt backbone, slightly sweet and a bit bready. On top of this superstructure the crisp hoppiness quickly establishes itself, building in intensity until the smooth bitter finish. The bite lingers well into the aftertaste. Yup, it's good.","Globetrotter","Nov 18, 2003"

3.13,-7.9,3,2.5,3,3.5,4,"More complexity would add to it, but its drinkability and smooth bite let it be an excellent accompaniment to bread-based meals. Slightly above average, but unfortunately touted as spectacular.","cooter","Jul 30, 2003"
3.36,-1.2,4,3,3,4,4,"I'm drinking this brew all the time in Prague, this major brew I prefer immensely to Pilsner Urquell. Came in a soccer ball themed can. Pours with good head, but dissolves quickly over time. Beer itself is a quite spectacular golden. Taste is a typical pilsner - smooth, but not much flavor except for slight hoppyness with the carbonation, and very little aftertaste. A good standard pilsner.","RocketWidget","Apr 14, 2003"

3.25,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Good beer. Tried this when i was in Prague. I'm not VERY enthusiastic with this beer and the reason perhaps is that i compare it with Pilsner Urquell and the U Fleku beer i had when i was in Prague. Definitely not the best Czech Republic has to offer","ipogios","0"
