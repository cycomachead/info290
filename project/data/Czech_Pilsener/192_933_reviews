"Clear golden pilsnery goodness. An even, bright white, large-bubbled head with excellent retention for the style. I detect a honey-like pale malt aroma. Refreshing but pleasantly spicy, zesty, lemony. Mouthfeel is watery, with not too dry of a finish. This beer is well-carbonated as well, as was first indicated in the head. And with the crisp, mildly bitter hop aftertaste, it's a great American representation of the classic Czech lager."
"Very good and very light."

"A pretty average pilsner.  I’d say sub-par for New Belgium.  Refreshing and drinkable on a hot summer afternoon, but pretty low on flavor and/or character."

"This is a crisp, dry, refreshing brew -the way pilsner ought to be - particularly nice for summer, but I'd drink it year-round."

"The Crack! was made difficult by the dent and really, I was lucky it did not explode on impact. A bottle would surely have shattered from that height. Speaking of height, it also made it impossible to tell just how full the CAN actually was. I gave it an inverted Glug to get things started and for the first time in a long, long time, I got some overfoaming! The result was two-plus fingers of dense, rocky, bone-white head with excellent retention. Color was Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-plus quality clarity. I could see into the future! I have company coming by later. Nose had a grassy, Saaz/Noble hops presence. My mouth began to water. In the meantime, lacing had begun to appear as the head subsided. Mouthfeel was soft, not thin, not watery, but simply soft. I was really digging the way that the hops were first and foremost, which is the hallmark of the Czech Pils style. I CAN get behind German Pilseners, but they do not trip my trigger like a good Czech. Pils, I mean, although I dig Czech women, also. The grassy bitterness is such a treat and this style is what made me realize that I CAN enjoy lagers as a hophead, especially after so many CANned AALs. Finish was semi-dry, not quite as biting as some that I have had in the style. At 4.8%, definitely sessionable and perfect for the Summer cooler in the backyard."

"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, best before 1/4/2015. Pours fairly crystal clear golden straw color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, pear, apple, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and clean mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.8%. Overall this is a nice and pleasant Czech pilsener. Good balance and robustness of pale malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall - A very average pilsner from NB here. Clean, yes, but very little in the way of flavor. There are so many other better craft pilsners out on the market, so it's doubtful I'll ever feel the need to buy this again."
""
""
"O: Possibly New Belgium's most bland beer? It's not bad, of course, but it just lacks character. I like the hop bite, but it's not enough. It has a noticeable toasted malt base, but it's just not enough. There is a slight lemon hint, but it's not enough to call it a note of citrus. Mediocre, B-."

"OVERALL: I enjoyed this beer, pils is the hardest style to describe for me, this is a good beer, nothing over the top but, I would not hesitate to buy it again."
"This is a good pilsner. It's not mind blowing or even worth getting again, but it's good. The taste matches the smell, and the taste is sweet and really enjoyable. Light lemony bread."

"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a light golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, a bit grassy. Taste is light, malts, some breadiness, a light bitterness at the finish. Decent but mild flavor. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a mediocre beer."

"Overall this I a well balanced easy drinking pilsner but could be a tad more flavorful. Would probably not go out of my way to seek out again but fine to drink if offered one."

"Pours a golden straw yellow in color with about a half finger foamy white head. LOTS of lacing is seen with each sip. Very surprised of the amount actually. The aroma is of mildly crisp and grainy pale malt, lemon, and earthy, grassy hops. The taste is of grassy hops, pale malt, biscuit, and lemon. Very crisp with good carbonation. Goes down easy and very drinkable. A good brew from the 'Fat Tire' folks."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Blue Paddle pours a golden straw color with a very small lacing head. There is a pale straw like aroma; very weak. The taste is crisp, light, good pale malt backbone. Nice flavors, stronger then others, but weak aftertaste. Overall its a very nice pils."

"An adequate and capable old-school pilsener, a bit soft around the edges, yet more or less drinkable, and duly thirst-quenching. A pleasant start to this cornucopia of a beer experience I have ahead of me this evening."

"A clean, well lagered beer over-all. I'm tempted to say something about the strange contrast between the excellence of New Belgium's American and now Bohemian styles and the general mediocrity of their Belgian style offerings, but that's beyond the scope of this review..."

"O: nice bitterness for a Pilsener, uncomplex, refreshing"

"O: I often detect mineral notes in lagers and count it against the experience, but here I don't mind it. It's a bit more subtle and balanced by other qualities and a good crispness. Overall one of the better lagers I've had. The pieces on their own aren't anything to brag about, but put together it turns into a great hot weather session beer."

"Decently hopped, just not especially tasty. In a can, I would like this for boating or camping."

"O: As with many New Belgium beers, I get the impression this one is brewed for the cross-over drinker and, while it is clearly a step up from the American Adjunct Lager, it is also clearly brewed with a heavy dose of restraint. Certainly drinkable, but nothing too exciting either."

"O- Is this a great beer? No. But a refreshing one that feels right considering it is 80 degrees outside."
""
""
"There’s a light but sharp aroma that’s equal parts lemony and grassy, with a hint of toast hidden in the back. The flavor is light and crisp, with the touch of lemon and grass on it. It’s lightly bitter but just enough to give it some character, with a nice finish, I liked this one more than I had expected to."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: A well made Pilsner that will probably impress your BMC friends. As a hop head I'd love to see a version of this beer that uses the same malt base with some West Coast hops. That would be a beer that could turn some heads. For now though, Blue Paddle is a drinker-friendly and enjoyable take on a classic. Would I drink it again? Sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a nice looking beer...clear gold color with a thick white head that leaves laces down the glass. It smells like a typical pilsner, sweet honey malts with a touch of herbal hop. Maybe a little waxy in the aroma. The spicy hop jumps out at first with grassy flavor and then the beer finishes with some grassy and floral hop and sweet malt. Finish has a nice spicy bitter bite. Overall a good pilsner."

"O-This is a good looking beer, but there are certainly better-tasting Pils out there. This one errs on the side of light and refreshing (maybe a good pool beer/golf beer), but even assuming that light and refreshing was the goal, I could use a little more taste and body here."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light yellow with a foamy beige head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and slight grassy aromas. Taste is much the same with grain and grassy flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is quite drinkable and tasty."
""
""
"For some reason, I've always shied away from New Belgium beers with the exception of their 1554 black ale. And that prejudice has been to my detriment. Based on this sampling, this pilsner is one of the best I've experienced in a long time. The beer is nothing but clean, sweet, and delicate with plenty of lager character. Well-balanced with a pleasant, subtle complexity that is nothing but enjoyable from every angle. I will be coming back to this one..."
""
""
""
""
"Poured this Czech style Pilsener from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear golden color, produced a nice off white head, nice retention and lacing. The aroma consisted of pale malt and citrus. Light in body, base of sweet malted grain, floral hops and lemon citrus. Overall, this is a easy drinking beer, nice session beer, not very complex but it's worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A fairly standard pilsener. I can see myself enjoying a few of these while grilling some burgers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden, with a big, creamy off white head, that leaves tons of lacing as the beer passes through the glass. Aromas of of freshly cut grass. Taste is a citrus peel beginning, followed by some light crackers, then an herbal, zesty bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a nice pilsner, easy drinking, but not dumbed down."
""
""
""
"O-I bought a 6 pack of this with out ever having it before. I'm glad I did! It's very tasty! It's a quality lager! I really don't know what else to say besides go out and try this please! It's one of the best pilsners I've ever had."

"Pours out clear like any other pilsner. Clear with a golden hue. The aroma of the noble hops emerges out as the most pungent aroma. This beer goes down smooth and the clears. There is only a light and slight bitternes to this beer. Very good american interpurtation of a Czech Pilsner where most american craft beers are going for fruitful beers."

"Pretty average, except for the smell. Good for a summer day."
""
""

"Overall: Unfortunately, I'm not too excited about this one. I was looking for a good go-to pilsner to replace my Sierra Nevada Summerfest when it goes out of season and I'm afraid the Blue Paddle just isn't it."

"yeah this isnt the most intriguing beer on the planet, but its a worthwhile summer sipper. it smells as german as it does czech on the malt profile, dusty and dry, sturdy but light enough to be easy drinking. the hops enter a little bit in the flavor, but its only in the finish and very subdued. this is a straight up pils, more robust than is traditional, but its not a beer for hop heads. the finish is dry after just a second, and a certain thirst quenching element is there, thankfully. it feels a little filling to me, maybe a little heavier in body than most beers from this genre, but the carbonation is good and its an easy 6pack on a late summer afternoon. no complaints with this, it just isnt getting me off ya know?"
"O) A pleasant pilsener. I'd drink another one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a decent beer, not one of my favorites so maybe it just is personal taste."
""
""
"O: If I could, I'd give this a 3.25. The hollowness spoils what would be an otherwise stellar Czech pilsener. Nonetheless, this is better than average."

"Blue Paddle is a simple, no frills pilsener. Looks how you'd expect, smells like you'd expect, tastes like you'd expect, etc. The good news is that it works just fine. It's full flavored, even if its elements are simple. I took a six pack of this out to Lake Tahoe and had several while barbequeing and felt it was perfect for the time."
""
""
"O - Blue Paddle is a relatively bare-bones, simple beer, but certainly not without flavor! This delectable, incredibly refreshing beer is a quintessential summer session beer, gently offering bitterness and hop characteristics of a cleanly lagered pilsner; something a hop-head who doesn't want to get bashed across the face with resin would really dig. Blue Paddle is incredibly well-done."
""
"A well done Czech pilsner. Easy drinking, light but flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a clear pale straw with a white head sticky enough to leave a good amount of lacing. Smell is bready but also notes of vegetation and citrus. Taste is full, making the experience of drinking a relatively light beer like this enjoyable (as opposed to a necessary step toward toward drunkenness *cough). Mouthfeel is light, smooth and certainly sessionable. Enjoyed."

"Easy drinking. The beer is decent, but leaves room for improvement."
"O: Nice drinker that goes down easy especially on a hot afternoon. pretty true to the style."
""
""
"Blue Paddle Pilsener was poured in to a standard pint glass. It was a true to style yellow color with a pure white head. The head was about one finger but turned to wisps fast; it did lace for the glass, the head fading may have been some residue of soap in the glass. The smell had the distinct pilsen yeast with a light floral hop. The taste was crisp and clean and ha a great pilsener taste. The hops were a good balan e but did not dominate. Very good with hints of the crystal malt for complexity. A clean aftertaste finishes this great specimen off right! Worth hunting for! Cheers!"

"On-tap at the brewery in lovely Fort Collins, CO. Clean gold with a healthy head of white foam. Mild grainy malt and spicy hop on the nose. The palate gives more complexity with clean, sweet malt underneath a soft hop bitterness and black pepper and fresh flower flavor. Well crafted and refreshing, but a bit more in the way of hops would be welcome. But I'm sure they were going for a crowd-pleaser with this one. A sub 5.0% beer is always welcome on a warm spring afternoon."
""
"Good for the style. Not my cup of tea, but I would drink another if it was offered."
"O - On par for the style, but nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
""
"O: I recalled not liking this beer for years, finally giving it a second try, I can say that it is definitely better than I remember, but still not something amazing. The bitterness seems out of joint with the rest of the flavor profile, and the lingering bitterness and bite don't help. I guess it's just not a beer for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a slightly above average pilsener and a really good effort from New Belgium."
""
"O: Not a world beater, in fact it's pretty middle of the road (like most things New Belgium), but this is something little 170 lb. me could kill a six pack of on a hot summer day, without feeling like I'm drinking a water facsimile. In that regard, it earns high marks in drinkability/overall score."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A summer drinking beer, like it was intended. Crisp and refreshing and delightfully middle of the road."
"I feel lucky to have something from New Belgium whenever I have the opportunity, and I am beginning to see some common threads. Delicate, balanced, and drinkable. There is nothing particularly remarkable about Blue Paddle, but there's nothing bad, either."
"Overall: This is one of my first quality pilsners, and I am rather impressed. This has a much stronger taste and is better than I imagined."
""
""
""
"An alright pils but there are better ones for this style."
"Pours a crystal clear yellow color under a lumpy, pure white head of fluffy foam. Webby lacing. Appears pretty well carbonated. Weak, clean, dusty grain aroma. Pretty much nothing from the hops department. Grassy, lightly spiced flavor over crispy cracker grain with a slight, fine sweetness. Quite crisp and dry, perhaps a bit too much, though it could just be in contrast to the overall mildness of the rest of the beer. Light bodied with a bitter finish. Far from awful, just sort of lacking."
"Overall, a very refreshing brew. It actually feels a bit heavier than 4.8% for some reason, but this is easily sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not up to European standards but a perfectly serviceable New World attempt. Nice drinkable ABV. Clean and refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This American-brewed pilsner lager seems a bit restrained by comparison to the top-tier of craft-brewed domestic pilsners such as Victory Prima Pils, but matches up fairly well with respectable European brands. Malt stands out more than hops, without really being malt-focused, although hop bitterness is present almost throughout the taste. It definitely doesn't measure up as an IPL flavored with noble hops, but it does hit the traditional pilsner dartboard--if not the bullseye."

"F: bitter exhaust, like dry pine needles.... in a good way."
""
""

"D ~ Probably would not be a good go-to pils. Drinkability is low for a pils which is a huge flaw. Very doughy. Loses drinkability even more as it warms. Would I drink this or Fat Tire? Who's to say really. Don't seek out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If it wasn't for that weird metallic off flavor in the finish, I would have called this a better than average Czech-styled pils. But because of it, it only comes across as average."

"It's a good session beer, but I thought it might have benefited from a more complex flavor. There's a good amount of bitter, but not enough of anything else."
"Bright yellow with a tall white head and nice carbonation, smells like cereal, grass, and a hint of lemon. The taste is a straightforward pilsner--malt-assertive, but with pleasantly floral noble hops and some nice estery flavors. Light body, dry finish, just enough hoppy tingle to keep it interesting the whole way through. I would like more spice or rawness on the palate somewhere, but you know, it's a good beer, easy to like and easy to share."
"Overall impression - not too bad, but I prefer it while colder."

"New Belgium Blue Paddle Pilsner: Moving out of a long and fun time sampling IPA’s, it’s time to try some lighter fare. The New Belgium Blue Paddle pours into a glass with a bright clear golden body, and nice amount of sparkling carbonation. The head stand tall, is pure white and very fine with great lacing. Aroma wise, the Blue Paddle smell like, well, beer. No esters, dry grass, bread crust, et. al. here. Flavor is subtle all the way through, faint malt sweetness up front and finishing with light hops and no bitterness. Very smooth to drink. The Blue Paddle is a great change of pace from big statement craft brews. Enjoy."

"the beer was clean, crisp & refreshing. It was easy to drink and had just enough complexity to separate it from the sea of average lagers that are out there. what else can you ask for from a Pilsener. enjoyable."

"Overall Drinkability - Pretty decent American made German-style pils. A little too acidic and not quite refreshing enough. Otherwise it might have been a letter grade higher."
"Overall, this was a fairly unexciting pilsener. Expected more from New Belgium. I won't seek this out again."
"The flavors are very clean and earthy, some grassy notes and a bit of lemon on the finish. Very very fast finish, clean, the flavor comes in and gets out fast."
"O: Though rather simple, the flavors were pleasant and the beer was easy to drink."
"O- Better then most pilsners, but I have yet to find a stand out pilsner as of yet"
"Very fine pilsner, a definite repeat purchase."
"O- A solid New Belgium offering that I like, but won't be likely to confuse with Stoudt's pils or Victory Prima pils as the frontrunners of the American take on the style."
"D/O- I've had better of the style, though I've certainly had worse. This is a good candidate for some with decent flavor that you could drink a lot of."
"Solid Pilsener - nice and crisp, slightly citrusy and likely amazing outside on a patio."
"Pours out clear like any other pilsner. Clear with a golden hue. The aroma of the noble hops emerges out as the most pungent aroma. This beer goes down smooth and the clears. There is only a light and slight bitternes to this beer. Very good american interpurtation of a Czech Pilsner where most american craft beers are going for fruitful beers."
"O- No real big flavors, but certainly a good-light summer beer...so if that is what you are looking for, then pick one up.."
"O - Decent and worthy of a pint when you're not feeling anything over 5%. Worth the tick."
"Reviewing this beer on a warm summer day in early June. First note picked up is strong smell of Noble hops with slight malt taste in the backround, head is light and not much carbonation. Small amount of lacing in regular pint glass. Very similar to euro style or Czech style pilsner lagers. Mouthfeel is light but with good flavor. overall a good summer brew best enjoyed on very hot days (90+) not something to go searching for but I would buy again."
"O: Not bad, but not that far above average. No off-flavors, but really miss the hops. Still, a good thirst quencher that would do well on a warm day. Worth a try."
"it was a while ago since i had this beer so i cant really get specific on it but it is certainly a traditional pilsner and im generally not crazy about pilsners but this one has easy to drink and refreshing and wet in the mouth."
"The beer was a clear, pale, yellow with a thick soapy white head that left a lot of lacing. Smells of lemon with light pilsner malt, grass and hay. There is a smooth but solid bitterness, the taste consists of lemon peel with a light pine flavor and a biscuity background. The beer is light with prickly carbonation and a dry finish. I would choose this pilsner over any other that I have tried so far."
"Has a crisp clean feel to it and leaves the palate satisfied."
"Overall, this is a thirst quencher of a beer. I enjoyed this one with fish and fresh vegetables, and it was the perfect light and crisp combo with a light meal."
"As summer nears this one will be a staple for the fridge, well crafted style that is easy to overlook. Crisp, refreshing and only gets better on tap."
"Overall not a bad pilsner at all. Nothing really earth shattering here, but still a very solid effort. I would most certainly not turn this one down if offered it again, especially with the warm weather approaching."
"Drinkability- Enjoyed three of these after work and was able to get a positive vibe from this beer. New Belgium always does a great job though."
"D-too bad I only had one!"
"This is another solid American pilsener and one I will stock up when warmer weather rolls around. Very well crafted and highly drinkable."
"Overall, an excellent pils that I highly recommend. Hadn't had this one in years but glad I did. Avail here in TX. Rotation - this would make a good addition to my light (wit, wheats, etc) rotation especially in the summer [R;Y]"
"A perfect example of a lager done right. This one hits the spot."
"D: I'm not a pilsner fan but I want another one of these. It's like they have upped the game a little."
"Aroma is light, malty grain that gets progressively bready as i warms. Mild herbal hop. Taste is light malt with some caramel sweetness in back. That herbal hop spices from the aroma is back again and it's brought an unfortunate friend antiseptic aftertaste. The hop bill is saaz, liberty and target which is odd because I love saaz and liberty. Not too familiar with target. Hops leave a swampy, antiseptic aftertaste. Mouthfeel is kinda fizzy."
" D- This beer was pretty clean with a few off flavors."
"This is definitely drinkable and solid. The lack of malt, as fast as I could tell, is a drawback. I wouldn't put it among the top pilsners, but I definitely wouldn't turn one down."
"D - very easy drinker, but a stronger grain flavor without the metallic hint would move drinkability to 4.5 or 5.0"
"Light golden straw. No head. continuous bubbles from etching in glass. Superb clarity. Smells a touch skunky over the base of straw scented malts. Bitter pilsner flavor. Taste is a bit too bitter for a good pilsner style, more like a kolsch."
"D- High marks for drinkability. More bitterness and carbonation might make me want more, but a beer worthy of a six pack carrier. The alcohol, body, and bitterness of this beer bring it firmly into the German family of pilseners rather than the Bohemian. Well done and refreshing, another solid beer from New Belgium."
"Blue Paddle Pilsener Lager was bright gold in color with good clarity. It had a white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was light malt and noble hops. The taste was a nice blend of noble hops over a light malt base with some bitterness coming through. The finish was dry and a touch bitter. It was medium-light in body with medium carbonation. Drinkability was very good. This is a tasty pilsner that is crisp and refreshing and well worth a try."
"Kinda surprised by the low marks on this pilsner, given the style's on the mark for a german pilsner. I could drink this all afternoon. Too bad I only picked up one."
"I prefer my paddles to be yellow or without color. This clearly inferior blue model pours a clear pale straw topped by nearly a finger of white froth. The nose comprises wheat, grass, and flowers. Quite mild. The taste adds more flowers, a touch of orange peel, and a few drops of mandarin orange juice near the finish line. The body is pretty light, with a moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry finish. Overall, a very nice pils, one of the better American versions I've come across in a while."
"Carbonated well to give it a crisp finish, and despite not being outstanding, very drinkable."
"Overall a soild German Pilsner. Not exceptional but nothing really to criticise either."
"D- Very easy. Refreshing and light. Crisp with a dry finish."
"Drinkability: With lower abv and the dryish finish it's easy to drink."
"Pours a clear golden yellow color with visible carbonation and a white head. The nose is some floral and herbal hops with grain in the back. The taste is straw and grain with some light Noble hopping. Fairly light mouthfeel with high levels of carbonation. Drinks well, especially in the summer, although there are certainly better examples of the style out there."
"You could easily have a few of these at a time without getting worn out, very refreshing and enjoyable."
"Poured into a 12 oz beer glass. The color was a light amber. The head came on nicely at about 1"". Not a real creamy head but left nice lacing all the way down the glass as I drank the brew. Smell was a light hoppy pleasant smell and the taste was very good with just a slight hoppy finish. Taste had a good balance. Mouthfeel was good, not thin and watery like most lagers. Drinkability was wonderful, mos definately will buy this brew again."
"New Belgium beers have a great reputation and this beer ived up to it's name. It pours a golden yellow color with not to much of a scent that stands out. It has a very light carbonation which makes for some very easy drinking. It goes down well and finishes with a great taste. Only thing people might not like about this beer is it's lighter flavor in comparison to many craft brews."
"Mouth is smooth light and crisp and with that quite drinkable really if your looking for something sessionable"
"This one surprised me. It was better than I expected. Everything was mild but everything blended together very well."
"This beer pours a clear pale golden color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice sticky lacing. The aroma is a balance of spicy noble hops and biscuity malt. It has nice strength for the style, and is pleasing. The taste leans toward the maltier side, with little hops coming through. It is a rather light it flavor for a pilsener. The mouthfeel is light bodied with aggressive carbonation, and an almost (but not quite) watery texture. Overall, this is a mediocre beer that I will probably not drink again."
"12 oz. bottle, brewed with all malt and noble hops. Pours a filtered yellow/gold, with high carbonation and a tight white head that deposits clinging lace. In the nose there's a sweet graininess and floral, green, spicy, almost earthy hops. It has a complex, sweetish, toasy/nutty malt flavor (Munich malt? decoction?), and is filled with noble hops that impart a medium bitterness. With its medium body and light, dry finish, each sip begs for another. Delicious and refreshing - I love a well-made lager."
"A very pleasant surprise in a 12 pack sample with Ranger, Fat Tire and Hoptober, all of which I've had and enjoy. This has classic pilsner profile, but more yeast in the aroma and taste, again, a nice surprise since I viewed this as the lightest offering in the pack. New Belgium has never knocked my socks off, but really makes some pretty good stuff."
"D- Very refreshing. A great lawnmower beer. Not a whole lot going on here but the clean simplicity wins you over in the end."
"Drinkability: Not the most full flavored Pilsner around but quite elegant and drinkable. More than solid Pilsner overall."
"I could have easily chugged several glasses, but it didn't quite hit the spot."
"Pours a clear light gold color with a tall white head that slowly dissipated, leaving some lacing. Smells crisp, a little grassy hop, not a very strong smell. Taste is also of grassy hop, with a little bit of citrus hop and some malt flavor. Mouthfeel is light, decent carbonation. Overall, pretty good pilsner, but not the best I have ever had. If it was offered to me, I would surely have it again."
"D - Wow what a refreshing brew! I wouldn't mind tossing back a few of these babies on a hot day. Very drinkable and refreshing, and I really liked the appearance of the beer as well. Definitely worth picking up, and I'd probably buy it again sometime. Cheers!"
"d: Above average beer. It's pretty drinkable and offers up some solid flavors. Give it a try!"
"Being light bodied and somewhat lowish in alcohol, this is almost a session beer. I wouldn't want to have too much of this when the weather turns cooler, but it's a good beer to have on hand when it's warm."
"11:30 am, on a thursday, Fort Collins, Colorado. Went up to Fort Collins with the wife and kids for a few beers, some junkin' and some lunch/dinner. My wife used one of her complimentary tokens on this one, didn't really like it, and gave it to me. Golden color, rocky/clingy white head. Aromas of grass, lemon and malt, with a flavor to match. Refreshing and drinkable, but not much more."
"Would I go out of my way to get it over their others? No. But it fills its role nicely."
"D- Its OK, I wouldn't go outta my way for it. Decent, but I like the Victory Pils better also the Sam Adams summer pils is better."
"Best before Nov 14 2010. I'd say this is a fine German pils with a bit of Belgian influence - the grains are a touch smoother and less crisp than usual. There's also an American twist with a little more hops character than usual, though it's not so high to be out of the realm of German brewing. The barley character, like a lot of the NBB beers, has a slight cookie or biscuit taste. That goes over dry toasty grains and is followed by herbal citrus hops. All in all, a tasty pilsner that's a touch different and interesting."
"Pours a clean yellow color with a white head. In the aroma, a sweet malt and a nice dry pilsner hop. In the taste, sweet to dry malt and saaz hops. A small bite, but mainly smooth and light mouthfeel, with a clean to dry malt in the aftertaste. A clean and fresh pils, very nice."
"This is very drinkable as it is light but has good flavor. A very good beer to drink on a hot day. Worth trying."
" ~ I think New Belgium really nailed this one. I'll be the first to admit I'm not a huge fan of this brewery. (I think there's a lot of hype around it and thier beers that are just pretty much, okay.) In this case, they really put out a beer that I would buy again. This is a good picnic, boating, or lounging around summer-time brew."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a very light straw color with a 2 finger fluffy white head that lasts quite well. The aroma is grainy with a nice backbone of noble hops and some slight earthiness. The taste is clean and crisp with some grain up front with dry bitter hops finishing things off. The aftertaste is a little much and takes away from the sweetness upfront. This is a thin body brew with little carbonation. All and all and average brew."
"This is a very nice version of a german pils. New Belgium continues to please."
"A good beer to have around for those who appreciate more than BMC, or when in need of a thirst quencher or palate cleanser."
"Very easy drinker that is easy to pair with a ham and cheese, bbq chicken or a burger."
"Mouthfeel is light, almost feathery, so much so that it almost feels like it evaporates off the palate. Nice, crisp carbonation as well. Stupidly drinkable."
"Pours straw-colored with am ample amount of foam. Ah. lovely noble hops aroma. A little toasted malt in the nose, too. Little bits of lace stick to the sides of the glass. Very smooth, crisp pilsner with a tasty, noble hop flavor and light-to-moderate bitternesss in the finish. Decent amount of body and heft for a pilsner; definitely more Czech than German. Despite the ample maltiness, bitter hops linger on the tongue after several sips. An excellent example of a Czech Pilsner. I think I'll be revisiting this often through the warm months."
"Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass. Straw-golden color with a two finger white head that leaves an excellent lacing. Aroma is grassy with a bit of maltiness following. Tastes slightly grassy with the maltiness a little more present. Feel is good and crisp, with a light-medium body, and some dryness. Overall the beer is good and a fine example of a German Pilsner."
"D - So easy, like throwing back Bud Light; I could easily down 5-8 of these"
"Drinkability is superb."
"D- Too hops forward, not my type of pilsner. But it's definitely not a bad beer at all, I wouldn't complain if this was all there was to drink."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, Blue Paddle is a perfectly clear, light golden color with a dense, foamy head that lingers and leaves nice lacing. A small population of bubbles slowly rise from the depths of the glass. The nose isn't terribly distinct, bits of lightly toasted malts mixed with grassy, herbal, maybe citrusy hops. The taste to me is slightly better with the lightly toasted malt taking center stage with a more defined presence, slightly bready. The hops too seem more obvious with the grassy, citrusy notes being dominate - very citric on the finish. The mouthfeel is light to medium in body with a minimal carbonation that still seems a little creamy which makes for easy drinking. I'm not much of a Pilsner man but if I was I think this would be a decent one to reach for."
"Fiance says its ""meh"" drinkable but she would not buy this again."
"i've had this brew on several past ocassions and from what i remembered it was better then, than it was today"
"Pleasant but nothing to rave about."
"STILL THIS IS REALLY GOOD>"
"D: A light and refreshing beer that was quite enjoyable. Not the most complex beer on the planet, but easy to drink and good for a session with friends."
"I just found Blue Paddle the other night and didn't know much about it. It really is a decent lighter beer. It looks very similar to other light beers, golden in color. The difference is the flavor. Blue Paddle has a lot of flavor for being a lighter beer. It's a good beer if you get the chance to have it."
"I liked the brew... It went well with the chili although I was hoping for a little more noble hop presence here..."
"A solid pilsner, more malt forward than say Prima Pils. Nothing great, but just a solid pilsner, i could drink a lot of this."
"Very crisp, very smooth. After a days hardwork in the kitchen or workin on the power lines you could for sure cool down with a sixer of these. Unfortunately, we got them in December... but I'll remember in July."
"poured a clear golden yellow color with very little head and lacing..the smell was a sweet malt smell with a floral hop background..the taste was german malt forward wit a crisp pils hop and floral bouquet IMO ..the malts took over on this one and the hops did not come thru..i will choose HOPTOBER over BLUE PADDLE ..did not like this one as much as hoptober due to the malt override..worth a try you be the judge"
"D - A very smooth easy drinking pils. I would like a bit more flavor but would easily have several."
"Notes: This beer is rather unexciting, but thats a moot point because excitement is not what a pilsener aims for. In terms of style, this beer definitely succeeds in the hop bitterness, refreshment, flavor, and drinkability categories. It seems to me this beer would make a great introduction to craft beer to a macro drinker."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a small head that leaves a little lacing. The appearance is yellow with a little amber and clear. The aroma is of light hops and malt. The taste is good with malty sweetness and slight bitterness. The feels is about average for a lager with moderate carbonation. The finish is clean. It's a very drinkable beer with no sharp edges."
"A refreshing pils!"
"12 oz bottle to glass. Clear golden yellow, head a mix of large soapy and small foamy bubbles. Nice clean smell, sort of Bud with some citrus. Taste had more citrus, very light malt flavors, not much sweet or bitter though. Mouthfeel has some creaminess, nice carbonation, very dry, clean finish, almost no alcohol. Haven't tried imported pilsner much, not sure how this stacks up, thought it was decent."
"drinkability is good - priced right and low abv"
"Nothing to get excited about, but it beats the hell out of having another glass of Fat Tire. Would probably order this one again."
"Drinks decent, but personally not a huge fan of this style."
"Taste is earthy and floral with a pretty good balance between graininess and a clean, bitter finish. It does not have a very 'bright' feel to it, as the almost soil-tasting malts make it seem a bit dull. Still, it is a very easy drinking lager and has enough flavor to keep it interesting."
"D - Easily drinkable - flavors aren't so overbearing that it makes it difficult to session. ABV is well in line. Not very filling, nice for a lager style."
"Conclusion: Nice American example of the German-style Pilsener...crisp and thirst-quenching, and this doesn't have the skunk/tinny flavors of many of the imports...at $9.00+ this was a bit expensive where we got it, but for the typical price around $7.50 it's not a bad example of the style at all...this went great with sauteed zuchinni and jalapeno quesadillas with black bean and corn salsa."
"D - This is a nice American interpretation of the classic German style. One might argue it's more like the Czech version. Regardless, nice beer, but perhaps a little on the malty side and, while appropriate to style, the sulfur component is a little more than I care for."
"Pours clear straw yellow with a medium head. The nose is very grainy. Taste is citrus and hops. Easy to drink but I felt I must keep this one pretty cool or it didn't hold up. This is an issue with me since most beer I drink holds up warm or cold. Cold and the taste was good, as it warmed, not so good."
"Nice medium body. Carbonation sting in the finish."
"A good-sized ivory head over a clear, light golden body. Aromas of grainy malts with a bit of earthy hoppiness to balance out. Taste is about the same, with similar balance. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, but it doesn't do too much to tone down the very welcome grassy hops in this brew. This beer is clean and straightforward. I am a fan, and give props to New Belgium for once again creating a good drinking beer."
"Beer poured a straw color with a decent white head. Nose is malty with hints of those German hops. Taste is heavy on sweet malts balanced quite nicely by those German hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and decently carbonated. Overall drinkability is good. This is a very nice take on the Pils style, quite sessionable, and a very refreshing brew for a warm summer day."
"The nose on the beer is quite grainy and bready; pretty much your standard smelling German Pilsner. Maybe a slight bit of hops at the end. The beer is brilliantly clear with a nice white fluffy head with okay head retention. Looks like a great pilsner. There is a bready flavour in the background with a nice bitterness. You can definitely taste the spicy noble hops with each sip. The balance is pretty good, but the beer isn't as clean as I'd like a pilsner to be; it's just not crisp enough. The flavours are quite mild, and I'd like more maltiness in the beer. Besides that, it's a decent tasting pilsner The mouthfeel is medium and good. Pretty drinkable brew as well."
"D - where this beer wins is in its drinkability. It's very balanced - not heavy or too light, the flavor neither weak or overwhelming; a great straight-ahead pilz that beats the macros."
"D: Better than average. Much better than a Miller. Not as skunky as a Euro-Pils, which is just fine by me. Good American take on a Pils."
"I am not a huge lager fan and this beer proves my point. Nothing that really stands out about this one. I loved the Prima Pils but this offering from New Belgium comes nowhere close. It's just your typical, thin, watery, minimal flavors. I do enjoy some of there other beers but this one is just way too average for my liking."
"D: A solid pilsener with excellent all-malt goodness with a strong noble hops presence. More of that hoppiness, and I think this beer would be even better."
"D - Very smooth, refreshing and easy to drink."
"Overall: A very clean pilsner, with a slight bitterness. The mouth feel is kinda chalky, astringent, and carbonated. The pilsner is decent. The hops is coarse through out this beer but not harsh. It is really close to the classic American, except is lacks a few qualities. I would have like to seen some creaminess in the mouth feel of the beer. Second, I felt that the beer is not well put together. I feel that the beer ingredients, are not being presented on the palate as one."
"D - This beer did many things to remind me of some of the great German Pilseners, which is good and more than I can say for most Pilsener, American or otherwise. I just didn't quite feel it pulled it off. The finish and the mouthfeel were the two main issues I had. This being said, solid value, and best American Pils I've had lately not brewed in the Bohemian tradition."
"Consumed 01/05/08 Poured clear golden into Stella glass (sorry, it was either that or a shaker - I do not have a pilsener glass or flute). Moderate whitish head, diminishing to very slight head. Nice pilsener aroma. Grassy with crisp citrus notes. Mild to moderate bitterness, crisp finish and a flavorful pilsener. Within category I find it a good offering, and domestic to boot, I enjoy the New Belgian beers - Cheers!"
"Overall it's too bland of a beer for me."
"Drinkability: a nice guzzler but can't compete with the true thing across the pond."
"D: I enjoyed this beer and would seek out again as lager option."
"I surely would like to have this in a restaurant but not quite the caliber of a Pikeland or a Prima."
"This is a nice beer after my little run today. It is a nice looking pilsner with a perfectly clear golden body and a thin flimsy white head. Has a mouthfeel like seltzer water. The smell has a nice aroma of hops, but the beer itself is pretty ordinary. It has a good taste, crisp, clean refreshing. It tastes a little straw like with a nice balance of esters. The only problem is it lacks that real characteristic pilsner flavor I like. Otherwise, it is a great beer."
"Pours a bright clear golden color, sturdy soapy white head hangs in for a long time, and leaves nice clingy lacing in the glass. Nice bright hoppy aromas, sweet grainy smell. Slight lemon flavor, grassy hop flavors, bready. Very clean and crisp, light-bodied, nice lingering bitterness, and excellent drinkability on this one. Good stuff."
"Godd drinkability."
"Out of mixed six pack this bottle of brew poured into my glass a bright, clear gold color that displayed great clarity and some good rising carbonation. The head was white, laced fairly well and retained itself as a thin collar. The aroma was a nice balance of grassy and slightly lemony hops atop a grainy, pilsner-malt base. The flavors were also well balanced, a zing of hops up front with adequate bitterness followed by pale malt and some hints of semi-sweet malt. Not complex, but solid. The body was medium, the carbonation lively and the mouthfeel clean. I don't ordinarily like Pilsners much but this one was a good example of the style and I found it refreshing and crisp as one should be."
"Overall - Just a very solid, very nice beer. I nearly drank the whole six pack in a night. Bitterness lets you know the beer's there, but very approachable. Very good offering from New Belgium, a pleasant surprise."
"Price/quality ratio often factors into my drinkability score, and here, it is a downside to this beer. Maybe it's cheaper in Colorado, but I'd rather spring for a cheaper Full Sail Sessions as a go-to basic, tasty lager. Otherwise, a quite drinkable, pleasant brew."
"d: Middle of the road Pils for those scared off by NBs other offerings, nothing more really. Doesn't have any glaring faults but doesn't scream for recognition as a top of the line lager either. Serves its purpose."
"It is a golden straw yellow. It has a nice white head that is very frothy. There is good lacing. It smells very floral, malt and hopped. It has a wonderful taste. It is floral with a piney citrus aftertaste. I has a good mouthfeel. It is a little fizzy. The drinkability is great."
"D: If you like your pilsner with some feel and flavor, this is a good pick."
"D- Drinks good and easy"
"Not my most favorite Pilsner but it is still very good. Great appearance but could use a bit more complexity with the flavor."
"Served in a Pilsener glass. Light golden color with very thin white head that dissappears quickly. Smell is fruity hops & yeast. The taste is slightly sweet from malts, bready. There's also a faint hops flavor. Mouthfeel is just average--clean, slight carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, but definitely not one of the better Pilseners out there."
"D - easy to drink and goes down quickly...perfect summer beer."
"This hit the spot on a hot summer day. A very good pilsener."
"The mouthfeel is light, but a bit thin. Not quite enough carbonation for my liking for this style. Nice beer. Not bad, but there are some better ones out there."
"mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, nice yeasty goodness, and good flavors, a very nice german pilsner!"
"Very quenching and refreshing."
"This beer doesn't strike me as being overly special, but it's something that I would consider buying again. The price might be a little steep for a ""party beer"" since it is comparable to other less-expensive beers that taste similar. It's not a bad beer, but it's nothing incredibly unique."
"Pours a nice transparent gold with a decent, fine-bubbled head. Aroma is strong and malty with a hint of fruit. Flavor is mouth-filling, mostly malty but with an appreciable hop component, and a hint of apple or pear. Texture is sassy, and overall this is a lip-smacking pilsner."
"This beer is quite good and plenty drinkable, but nothing really stands out about it."
"Nice crisp floral pilsner, not your typical macro flavors. Even other craft brewers like Victory have very macro-ish versions of pilsner. NB however stands to the side, offering a twist on the pilsner style."
"Clear yellow color with a fizzy white head. Nice collection of zesty hops and citrus fruits in the nose. The flavor does not quite meet expectations. Fairly light with some grainy malts. Highly carbonated crisp body. A drinkable pilsner, but did not live up to my hopes from the start."
"Poured into a pilsener glass. Classic pale gold color with a thick 2 finger head. Nice lacing. Aroma is faint, but I can pick out some sweet toasty malt, maybe some Saaz too. Flavor is mostly cereal grain that comes out a little too heavy for the style, limiting the crispness. Now that I think about it, it's not only cereal grainy, it actually tastes like breakfast cereal. There's a Cheerios note in there! Anyway, the hops are almost nonexistent in the flavor, which also contributes to the lack of crispness. Drinkable but off the mark for the style as far as I'm concerned."
"D: Definitely likable, a better than average pilsener. I had no idea what to expect from New Belgium when crafting this style and must admit I was pleasantly surprised. This one I'd probably get again, even when the office isn't buying..."
"Pours brilliant golden with a decent pure white head that fades to a thin ring but leaves some spotty lacing as well. Very light hop aroma with some earthy crisp notes and a touch of lager yeast in the aroma, but that's about it. taste is about the same. It lacks the crispness and bitterness of a true German Pilsner, and the finish is especially soft. There are some spicy hp notes, but its fairly one dimensional. Even so, it is still pretty refreshing on a hot spring afternoon. Some more noble hop bite and crispness would make it more so."
"Don't drink and review."
"Bottle poured into mug. Light golden color with 1/2"" head that lingered throughout. Aroma of hay and lemons. Nice blend of malt and hops with honey, lemons, and clover. Crisp and refreshing with a moderate bitter finish. Nice session beer, poor me another!"
"Drinkability- Crisp, clean, refreshing. I could shower with this stuff! A very pleasurable and well made pilsner from New Belgium."
"A tough style to do well, but New Belgium has Blue Paddle dialed in... solid ... very nice across the board leaving me with no complaints. I typically don't pick up the NB brews that often, because I just don't like Fat Tire.. but their Triple, Dubbel, and pils are the brews I frequently get when I want a taste of Europe without spending too much. Also Blue Paddle is a great gateway beer for the Macro drinker who wants to branch out.. ""Here .. try this... it's Bud with flavor."""
"The Blue Paddle pours a clear straw color with a very little foam head and tiny dotted lacing. In the smell category it faint smell of citrus and yeasty aroma. The taste was crisp and clean. In the mouth is left its mark on the back of the throat and tip of the tongue. It is thin which is normal for the style. Overall one of my favorite pilsner session beers."
"Very drinkable, and refreshing but not really remarkable."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of medium gold, with a thick light white colored lacy head - nose of pale hops, sweat, soapiness, and semi floral  taste of pale hops, dry, and semi floral - body is dry, and with medium high carbonation  aftertaste of semi bitter, citrus hints, and lingering"
"Pours a crystal clear gold. Head goes about one finger and falls fairly quickly and leaves a lot of lacing on the way. As far as appearances go, it'd be a good beer to shoot pictures of. Mouth-feel is thick and frothy when you first down it and as you keep going it lingers for a bit and leaves a lasting impact on the palate. Overall I'd say this is a decent brew, but not powerfully done."
"This beer pours with a lot of head that clears quickly. The smell is almost non-existent and the taste is mild. There is a slightly sweet, slightly carbonated, slightly bitter mix to the taste. Nothing offensive, but nothing to set it apart either. It is drinkable in so far as it's an easy going beer but it's not the type of thing you'd seek out again."
"Nothing really remarkable about this, but nothing wrong with it either."
"D: It is a nice Pilsener that benefits from some time breathing before drinking. Its not my drink of choice but a nice brew when eating spicy food, pizzas and Mexican dishes."
"D - Not terrible, but way off for the style. I don't really care much for this, it's really not a bad brew, but something just seems off to me."
"Taste follows the nose in that the first sip is flat out sweet. It was just tongue shock as the second sip...not so much. Light and crisp, but sweet and a bit undercarbonated for my liking. I need something to sweep away the sweetness. I could drink one now and again but will not seek this out."
"Pretty good domestic pils."
"Drinkability: Very nice effort from New Belgium; while not as hoppy as Prima Pils, I really like the floral elements that make it very drinkable"
"Overall a good brew, but far from perfect. I might recommend this to others, but I can't help but feel wanting more."
"Pours to a thin white head that leaves some lace; clear gold color. Aroma is spicy/grassy hops and a hint of malt. Flavor is crisp and hoppy with just enough malt to offset the bitterness. Finishes hoppy, bitter and dry. This is a solidly pleasing beer."
"This beer has a nutty and hoppy smell to it when you pop the top on it, but it does pour a nice rich light brown color, with a cream colored head that holds true and lasts. The first sip is a little nutty tasteing, which dies off as you drink more of the beer. It's a good beer, just takes a little more time to drink."
"it's quite competent and I would certainly not refuse another. It's well worth a try."
"D: Easy to drink. A good choice if you want to knock back a few without resulting to an American Macro."
"Drinkability: A decent session beer, but I'll stick to Trumer if I want a good domestic pils."
"A solid effort. There are better pilseners out there, but there are also far worse."
"The taste and mothfeel -- almost at a Victory Prima Pilz level. Very nice and drinkable. Good stuff, indeed."
"For a New Belgian product this is actually not bad stuff- in my opinion, of course, its not nearly hoppy enough for all that grain. Easy to drink."
"Had this on tap at Little Star Pizza in San Franciso. Pours an opaque tan with a medium head. All around a basic Pilsner. Made me think it is the lager a BMC would like to make; basic but with a little more taste. Not much more to say about it. Enjoyable but I would choose something else if offered."
"this would be a good beer if your trying to weine your freinds off of lite beer. this is a good sesion beer. you can probably throw a few of these back. i havent decided if im going to buy this again or not."
"D: Despite my just above average impression of this beer, I found this to be quite refreshing on the 83 degree day that I drank it. Overall, I found it to be one-dimentional and rather boring."
"Mouthfeel was nicely rough in texture, with some huskiness. Dry, medium length finish. This is a subtle yet solid American Pilsner."
"Pils are not my forte, but NB has made a nice one. Appearance was crystal clear pale yellow with a fluffy white head that had nice retention and left nice lacing. Smells were malty, a bit floral and grassy, all around common pils aromas. Tastes were well balance with a hoppy bitterness up front followed by a balanced malty grassy flavor in the middle and ending with a lasting bitterness. Mouthfeel was a bit dry and slightly thin. A beer worth drinking, no doubt....great for summer days, bbqs, etc."
"This beer poured a dull yellow with a fair amount of white head. Aroma was citrusy with a lightly sweet aroma. Flavor is acidic tasting with lots of citrus notes. Much more like a Spotted Cow than I expected. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh and slightly sticky. Can't say I'd recommend this."
"Again not a favorite style of mine, but this is one of the better examples I've had... especially from The U.S. The appearance was a definite strong point. Beautiful beer to look at."
"I am not a big pilsner fan, or any lager for that matter, but I could get used to this beer. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel, almost medium bodied. Wonderful drinkability. Should be a great summertime treat. Certainly worth another shot in the future."
"D: Definitely a session beer. With low ABV and a clean taste, light mouthfeel, you can drink these all day. Definitely an addition to my summer beer list."
"Pours a very light, clear yellow. Thick foamy white head, settles slowly. Smells a bit grassy. Very malty. Smooth mouthfeel. Not a whole lot else to say really. It's a very sessionable lager. Easy to drink. Far better than most other american pilseners."
"I never thought this Pilsener was too intriquing, but for some reason I still like it. It is light, refreshing, and easily drinkable. I heard a rumour they were going to stop making this at New Belgium. Hopefully that's not true..."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a clear straw, forming a very thin 1/4 inch head, that faded quickly, leaving very light lacing on the glass. The aroma is extremely skunky. Unfortunately, that is all I can detect. The taste is a light balance of hops and malts. Nothing that really stands out. Light mouthfeel. Overall, its an easy beer to drink, but far from enjoyable. The smell is terrible, and the taste is anything but great. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a German style pilsner. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but if this is the what it normally tastes like, I wont be trying this again."
"D: Enjoyable, this beer would be perfect on a warm summer night or on a snowy winter night like tonight."
"Smell is clean with a bit of bitterness, taste follows suit. Mild and really easy to drink, gets better the less is left in the glass. Second Beer in my let's visit New Belgium beer tour. Will again be a hot/warm weather brew, but not much of a cool weather friend."
"Dry and easy to drink beer. A good choice for most any food."
"Normal pilsner color, golden yellow with above average lacing. Verry hoppy smell almost like potpurri. Great pilsner, a bit of a bite. Plenty of hop taste. I liked this beer, but the mouthfeel had a little high carbonation for a New Belgium beer. This beer was really good and had an above average drinkability."
"This beer pours golden with a half finger of white head. Visually, the beer looks highly carbonated as I can see bubbles rising. The only thing I can smell is yeast. The taste is rather disappointing. It tastes like a standard pilsener, which I wouldn't expect from New Belgium. I only get light to moderate hop and slight yeast flavors. It does differ from a standard pilsener though because it is not incredibly thin feeling. It isn't full bodied, but it isn't Budweiser either. The drinkability on this is pretty low. I really wasn't that impressed."
"Not overly found of this beer from New Belgium. In fact, this is the lowest I've scored on any of their beers. The hoppy flavor was not to my liking and just didn't do anything for me. For me it was kind of spicy, peppery flavor, but had a flat hoppy finish. I just didn't like this ale. Maybe just a bad batch or bottle."
"Golden body topped by a thick white head. Head shows excellent lacing. Aroma is very clean and crisp noble hops. Flavor is also clean, with a touch of malt accompanied by decent bitterness and a touch of hop flavor, almost a peppery note. It finishes very clean, with no adjunct aftertaste. This is a very solid pils. Body and mouthfeel are great, and it's a very enjoyable beer. I can see me enjoying this with dinner fairly often. Great offering from this brewery."
"D: Not my style of choice normally but this is a very good beer in my opinion, would try again"
"Taste is dominated by strong noble hops. Hops in the finish and linger in the aftertaste. Crisp and clean mouth. Refreshing and tasty, a nice domestic pilsener."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability I rated as 4.25 each. I just gave mouthfeel the 4.5 to even it out. This beer is very crisp and very very refreshing. It is easily a session beer. I could drink these all night long. My favorite new belgium brew so far. But I still have a lot more to try ;)."
"D - A nice pilsner. Really one of the more enjoyable American pilsners available."
"Session beer here for sure."
"Light bodied with high carbonation and a slightly dry finish from the light hop flavor. Slightly disapointing, as I expected more hop character out of this. The dry finish with low hop flavor lowers the drinkability."
"Last swigs: Light flavor & aroma. A true American pilsner."
"I've never seen a thick consistent head on any other pilsner before. Great bubbling and thick lacing to boot. The best looking pilsner I've had up to this point. But the smell didn't match the pleasant sight. Pretty musky for what was expected to be a well crafted New Belgium brew. No clean or crisp definition of the malts or hops. The flavor was slightly better than your Miller or Bud. Drinakable. Yet not what you expected from a brewery."
"Very poor example of the style."
"A great Pilsner, and an incredible sessioner. Highly recommended."
"My favorite part of this was the fact that it was absolutely free and I could drink it while floating around a family friend's pool. I'm enjoying New Belgium more and more when I can find it and this one hits the spot on a hot summer day. Not my favorite style, but hits every mark in terms of comparable characteristics. Worth a try."
"Poured a clear golden yellow, and exhibited a very thin head. Mouthfeel was good, and over drinkability is quite nice. Of the New Belgium offerings that I've had thus far, this is one of the better of the bunch. I'm not a huge pilsner drinker, but this one was quite good. I would definitely give it another try."
"D - Drinkable. Not a bad pilsner, would recommend over the Big 3 for sure though."
"Tastes grassy and grainy, no sweet malts here- the hops are ""just right"" crisp, bitter, and a bit spicy. Flavor in an American pilsner- very nice! Pleasant carbonation, nice dry finish, very drinkable."
"D - Good drinkability. Nice ""light"" beer. Another solid NB brew."
"Pale strawish color with very little head and some decent lacing. Nose is very, very subtly floral and grassy. Definitely subtle. Taste is certainly pilsnery, with a good kick of biscuityness near the end. It starts off a bit grassy and hoppy and the biscuit really smooths it out, makes it smoother, less agressive and easier to drink. Mouthfeel is chewy yet not too heavy. Feels nice on the palate. Quite easy to drink- a great summer beer, not a shabby session beer, and ultimately pretty good. Too bad I only have one bottle... part of payment for cat-sitting whilst my friend was in Colorado. Sigh."
"And that's what it is."
"Overall a decent beer, nice example of the style. seems it would pair well with many types of food. quite drinkable, but wont knock your socks off."
"Beautiful clear golden color. One and a half finger head. Great Pilsner scent and taste. Extremely refreshing. Wish I had more. I will be searching for more lagers like this throughout the summer. Enough hop bitterness to satisfy my IPA loving nature. Puts the American macro lager to shame. Reminds me a little of when I first had Pilsner Urquell back in the early 90's. I couldn't believe beer could be that good. This is an excellent switch up from NBB's belgian style ales."
"Best before date of 8 Sept. 06."
"Pours out a brassy gold with a sudsy head. Excellent lacing all the way down. Sheets of white. Smells of sweet malt and a good helping of noble hops. Tastes malty and a touch grainy with some herbal hops in the finish. I'm a bit put off by the typical toastiness I get from New Belgium beers. Mouthfeel had a nice presence with an active carbonation, although it felt a bit sticky at times. Solid drinkability and easy to finish."
"Hops was balance enough by biscuit and slight malt. A bit of citrus, left a clean feeling. Good for spring and autumn."
"A pretty standard tasting Pils. Nothing stands out more then others, so its fairly good for a quick drinking session when in the mood for a Pils."
"Overall a nice interpretation of a quality pilsner. Very drinkable, light, nice flavors and aroma. Should hold up to a variety of foods and situations."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Overall impression: A great example of a style so many people overlook. Drinkable, but complex enough to be interesting and hold up to a wide variety of foods. This should be a staple in many coolers."
"I had this at the airport bar in Denver in a very cold glass so I had to let it warm up a bit. The color was clear yellow, with a nice white head that disappeared quickly. There really wasn't much to the smell, a bit of piney hops and that was it. It had a slight bitter taste without much malt presence; there was a metallic taste in there too. The body was light and it was very refreshing. Not quite up to Victory's Prima Pils but excellent for the airport."
"My son was right. Have this with pizza or hot Mexican or a heavy German dinner, and it's a great beer. Heck, it's even pretty decent on its own. A commendable example of the style. I'll definitely come back to this in the future."
"Obtained from the brewery and consumed very fresh. Reviewed from notes. Pours a three finger white fluffy clingy head of fine sticky bubbles. Crystal clear and very light straw in color with many streamers racing to the top. Smells potently hops. Noble, not quite Hallertauer, but I'd guess a hop derived from a Hallertauer parent. A bit of earthy, a bit of honey, and a tinge of tin. Malt is far below the hops and has a hint of cardboard. Otherwise, it's clean. Just a hop dragging down my nose. Tastes clean fresh malt with a heavy sort of saazy hop flavor. The hops lighten in the end to a clean, somewhat citrusy, finish. This hop experience is supported throughout by a bright honey flavor. A touch of grassy hop character stands up as the beer goes down the throat. Nice dry finish witha lingering tin-like hop aftertaste. The dry-mixed with the hops almost comes across as a flavor like a raspberry seed. Pretty amazing lacing on the inside of the glass. Md body and moderate-heavy carbonation."
"Overall, this beer is what I expected. I have been trying to break my habit of always going for the 'big' beers, and this is a nice change. Pours golden, with a nice fluffy head that leaves beautiful lace and hangs on 'til the end of the beer. The taste is light, but not without flavor. Nice to have a beer with subtle subtlties for a change. I was surprised by the mouthfeel of this beer, which was pretty substantial, not watery like expected. Nice maltiness and hops are balanced and make a refreshing brew."
"Flavors are deep and malty with a very dry finish. Hoppiness keeps it in check. This is my first non macro lager (had SA ages ago and have no recollection), and it's actually quite enjoyable. Very light body, high carbonation. I could drink this all day once hot weather is set in. Glad I chose to drink this straight from the fridge as I feel it will suffer once warmed up. NB even recommends drinking at 38 degrees. This one really changes my mind about my disposition of lagers."
"* The beer is a little colder than recommended and may be suffering chill haze. A second warmer bottle was clearer."
"Drinkability: Highly quaffable. Very enjoyable brew. Not my favorite style but a very nice example."
"the other being the far inferior Polestar Pilsener from Lefthand--and, perhaps for that reason alone, it's worth checking out."
"Drinkability is good a decent pilsner, thanks go to Dertbert for this sample."
"The body is light. The bit is just a look to big and not as crisp as it should be. Also the sudsy taste gives a texture of chalkiness. Ive had far worse but its noticeable here as well."
"Not as interesting as most beers by this brewer, but passable nonetheless."
"Opinion: Well, I have definitely had better pilsners. This one is out of balance for the style. I would expect it to be a bit more crisp, along with either more assertion on the hops, or the malt. This one ends rather uneventful. If I were to drink a US made pilsner, I would stick to Victory's Prima Pils."
"The taste is a very nice balance between the hops and malt and has that *pilsner* taste that I've experienced with the better European examples. This is one great session beer and I thoroughly recommend it."
"Like I stated, had better samples, just bothers me that a beer within 200 miles of home with great distribution is not consistent."
"Now this is a different pils. Same looking pour as American pilsners, but much more in the aroma. The crisp noble hops flair up , and the taste is also much hoppier than what I expected. Sharp and tangy, this makes for an exceptional drinker, either just for one or many. A much tastier option vs. the BMCs out there."
"The beer is golden. Smells of grassy hops. Tastes like a pilsner. Feels like a pilsner. I could drink it all day."
"Mouthfeel has a solid body with a good creaminess that just flows down the back of the throat so easily. A well built pilsner that would be great for sessioning on hot summer days out by the beach. Ranks up there as one of my fave U.S. brewed pilsners. Thanks to mentor for the opportunity to sample this one!"
"Starts sweet and clean with a bitter hop twinge (at the front it actually affects the lips as much as the tongue). Blue Paddle settles light bodied with a unqiue combination of sweet, sour, and bitter flavors. The overall taste of this beer is somethign akin to a subtle wheat and cream. Finish is fairly clean but with a notable aftertaste that dwells on the tastebuds."
"This is a *perfect* brew to wean people off of macros (both domestic and euro). It's familiar, but so much better."
"12 ounce bottle dated 30 Dec 05. Thanks mentor!"
"Overall I would say a very enjoyable brew as a thirst quencher or when you just feel like something lighter. A must try as a malt only alternative to Macro Lagers that use adjuncts. A very good representative of what is possible with a style of beer that is commonly looked down on by people wishing to avoid this style only because it is so mainstream."
"Overall, not too exciting but a decent brew."
"Pours a light pale gold with one finger white head that left sparse lacing. Aroma is mildy malty with floral hops. Taste is biscuit malt, light and earthy followed by progressively drying hop bite with faint citrus notes at the tail. Short crisp, dry finish. Tasty and a nice summer beer."
"Overall a finely crafted pils. I really dig the bready, earthy/skunky component but wish there was more in the hop dept. I suspect this beer is well received from people just entering the craft brew movement. Great for beginners and a great alternative to most 'pilsners' in local supermkts and liquor stores."
"Nice initial thick head but doesn't retain long. Mild aroma of malt. SLight hop smell. Quite easy to drink but not as much hop as would be expected in a true pilsner. Enjoyable but would score better with more hops. Light bodied with dry finish. Fits well with the hot Sacramento summer. Goes down way to easy."
"Appearance is a lovely light amber with a very white foamy head that leaves a little lacing. Aroma contains an upfront dose of fresh mowed lawn, flowers and gingery hops that mellow out into some malty grains. Body is light to medium with little carbonation. Initially the flavor fulfils the promise of the aroma, but adds some bitternness that ends in a finish that is nicely dry and satisfying. Very nice to have on a hot day, with food or as a session beer."
"Not a real premium Pilsner but very drinkable."
"This is a fairly tasty take on a German Pils that hits the right notes on both hopping and finish. Don't get me wrong this is isn't up there with the great German Pils but I would buy this in the Summer as a thirst quencher.I really enjoyed the pleasant semisweet finish which helps make it food friendly."
"Not a bad brew, but not something I would buy regularly."
"Overall, it's a solid pils that's definitely welcome during the summer, but perfectly acceptable in any season; and also perfectly suited to almost any occasion (BBQ, wedding reception, bowling league, nightclub, late afternoon at the ski-lodge, dinner with mom & dad, fishing expedition, .... you get the idea!). Nicely done!"
"Pours a slightly cloudy golden hue with a half-inch stark white head. Nice clean aroma of German yeast, light malt, and floral hops. Taste is nice, but kind of subtle. Very light malt, a touch of floral hops, some honey sweetness, and some nice German lager yeast. Not exactly a very complex palate, but decent. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, about what you'd expect from a pilsner. Would be a great session beer if I had more than the two my brother brought back from Colorado."
"This beer pours a golden yellow with a white head. The head fades slowly leaving thick laces. It smells citrusy and hoppy. It has the smell of a flower. There is a very faint malt aroma present if you look deeply. Ot tastes hoppy. It has a crisp taste to it. It is just a little tangy also. This is a well balanced beer. It leaves a fresh floral aftertaste on the palate. This beer is carbonated nicely. Due to the low alcohol content, this beer would probably make a good session beer. I am not really a Pilsner fan, but I thought this beer was decent. This beer would be good to drink on a hot summer day. It is hard to get down here, and that makes it a bit pricey, so I probably wont buy it all that often, but it is worth a try."
"This beer has enticed me into trying other examples of REAL pilsener, such as Pils-Urquell and others. It was quite refreshing after a barrage of intense beer flavors through the winter months. So far, this is the only Pilsener I have had that is worthy of a review, and I hope to change that soon. Nonetheless, I still prefer an unbalanced hoppy brew. I can't normally get this at home in Iowa City, but next time I am ""home"" home (in Omaha), I will most likely skip this even though it has intrigued me. I will definitely try other New Belgium beers, though, since the brewery will always have a special place in my heart (regardless of whether or not I am as obsessed with Fat Tire as I used to be before I got into hoppy beers)."
"Blue Paddle isn't a bad beer. It compares favorably with Belgian pilsners like Stella (pils in Belgium accounts for over 80% of the beer produced, I've read). New Belgium's other beers are more interesting, but this is a good example of a continental pilsner, with few flaws."
"Drinkability- Not a real bad beer for me, but I'm still searching for a pils that I like. It looks like most people enjoy this, so I guess I would give it a go. Just not for me."
"Finish is an expected clean, crispness. Very appetizing, drinkable."
"This is an outstanding pilsener, equaling some of the finest European pilseners on tap. Probably the best American pilsener I've ever had, and it's only better on tap at the brewery. At $6.99/6'er, this is an absolute steal. Highly recommended!"
"Straw colored with a weak head. Smells hoppy and tart and tastes the same. A little maltiness lurks in the finish. Mouthfeel is fantastic and makes this a fine hot day brew. Combined with the hoppy nature of the beer, it makes for a beer that certainly earns the title: ""Crisp and Refreshing"". Drinkability is likewise high."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a typical pilsner scent; pale malts and a dry lager yeast finish. The taste is decent as well. It has a plain pale malt base with a slight bitterness. It has a grainy flavor and a dry finish. It goes down smooth and finishes clean and crisp. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine pilsner. It doesn't throw anything new at you, but it drinks well."
"My palate grew tolerant to this beginning after a certain point and I did truly find the beer pretty tasty after awhile. Probably wouldn't get it again unless I was sure that sulfury taste wasn't there again."
"Blue Paddle pours an attractive golden color with a large, thick head. Head retention is excellent, lacings are left all along the inside of my glass. Smell is what you'd expect from a pils, mildly hoppy with some grassiness. This is quite tasty, very crisp and refreshing. Slightly sweet lemon finish is very enjoyable. Drinkability is very high, I could easily see myself spending an afternoon with Blue Paddle."
"Overall this is a good american pilsner, nice and refreshing, best when ice cold."
"Overall Impression: Crisp, slightly bitter mostly refreshing pilsner. It could make a good session on a warm day. Great looks, mild aroma, firm taste, rough mouthfeel. A mixed bag overall, but a nice total product."
"Sharp carbonation lends a bite to the brew. Very clean and summery flavor, with a thin mouthfeel and clean finish. A solid pilsner, and one of the best brews put out by New Belgium."
"The head was thick at pouring but thinned down pretty quick to a lacy covering. The aroma was not unlike Budweiser or other mass p[roduced pilsners. The taste begins with a malty flavor but quickly turns to a light sweetness. Mouthfeel is very crisp and wheaty."
"This is a damn good lager. Pours a crisp golden yellow with a foamy head that is very inviting. Leaves a nice froth coat throughout the session. The smell is a refreshing blend of citrusy lemon-lime and sweet sugared grains. Popcorn/sunflower detected as well. The taste is refreshing and inviting. The citrus is mixed wonderfully with the sugar strawed corn. Slight caramel/molasses as well. Refreshing and light and perfect for those outdoor occasions."
"Thanks marc77."
"What an unexpected find at Pipe and Pint here in Greensboro today actually had it given to me it was part of the owners personal stash,anyways pours a vibrant yellow with not much head wich kept the rating at 4 I really liked the vibrant color of this brew.Aroma was like walking thru a meadow of flowers kinda sweet and grassy with a good toasted malt character.Taste was grainy and lightly sweet with a nice smacking of hops that hits nicely in the finish.One of the best American pilsners out there at least from my perspective I wish I had more!"
"Overall, this is a fairly impressive beer, highly drinkable, and is an excellent option for a pilsner purchase. Produced in the western US, shipped in the western US, this beer is far less likely to be skunked than, say, Pilsner Urquell."
"Blue Paddle Pilsner is another quality product from New Belgium. It's difficult to brew a noble hop lager that I really enjoy, but this one comes close to getting a big thumbs up from me. I have no problem recommending it since it's one of the better domestic pilseners that I've run across."
"Many thanks to nvsblman for the hook-up."
"ng"
"Thanks to BDitty for the bottle!"
"This Pils pours a clear yellow with a nice big head that laced quite well. The smell was strong of green apples. Taste was malty and crisp. Has a nice aftertaste I thought. An easy beer to drink. Overall a good beer but nothing really stood out on this beer for me. It was good but not great."
"All I can say about this is it's very average. I was surprised because New Belgium produces some of the most unique, quality brews you can buy. Not saying this is not high quality, it's just the same pilsner formula that everyone seems to use. I guess I was expecting Blue Paddle to have a different twist/interpretation of the standard pilsner (ie, have a little flavor or something). Nope, this is a standard pilsner."
"Pours a hazy yellow, little head and even less lacing. Hops dominate the aroma, some maltiness in the taste and a crisp mouthfeel. Tasted great with some fish & chips, the maltiness blended well with the beer battered fish. Overall, a good beer, not overwhelmingly great."
"thanks to beer angel for the sample!"
"Overall, 3.5 out of 5 swills."
"Clear, light gold with a foamy, white head. Streams of small CO2 bubbles rise through the liquid. The initial 3 fingers of head falls back to a persistent half-finger which leaves a surprising amount of lace. Smell is slightly biscuity with some mild floral, grassy hop aroma. Taste was a nice balance of malt and hops. More malt flavor than expected, and just a little hop bitterness in the finish. Light bodied, as expected, but creamy and nicely carbonated without being ""fizzy"". This is a good example of what an American pilsener should taste like."
"I don't think I'd go out of my way to obtain it."
"Blue Paddle pours soda-pop bubbly, and emits an aroma quite like a yeast under duress during lagering--sulphury and a tad autolyzed. Stylistically, it tastes like a golden ale (micro, not Belgian). While the hop profile is quite an appropriate snap-to-form for this brew, it's meandering fermentation leaves it flat--somwhere between Cologne and Dortmund."
"Lots of carbonation, refreshing. Mouthfeel is perfect for this beer. An ideal warm weather treat, even if it's cold outside (like it is today)."
"This is a very drinkable summer beer but I would like to try a few other variety of Pilseners before I had this one again."
"Pours a light gold with very little head. Aroma is a bit metallic with a slight detection of hops. Has a light body that is crisp and dry. Flavor is a grainy malt with a bitter finish from hops. Overall not very good. I'd take Warsteiner over this one any day."
"Final Thoughts: IMO, just an average beer. The most disappointing product I have had from New Belgium thus far."
"Appearance: Slightly hazed golden straw color with a nice fluffy white head forming leaves behind speckled lacing in concentric patterns at that. Aroma: Upfront nice biscuit malts with some Saaz peeking through giving a nice peppery hop profile very clean altogether. Taste: Incredibly crisp and smooth no cloying off flavors delivers light malt sweetness and finishing hop zest in the finish. Mouthfeel: Light bodied smooth but a bit spritzy carbonation. Drinkability: Is excellent awesome summer beer I wish I had this one at my disposal, that would be key."
"Pours hazy golden color with a small fizzy white head that doesn't last very long, some pretty good lacing though, spicy, grassy and flowery aromas. Bready malt and spicy hop flavor. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel, not as carbonated as some pilsners, finishes clean, a pretty good pils."
"A note on the bottle suggests this beer be served at approximately 38ºF. A good suggestion, as Blue Paddle does not hold up well to even a slight increase in temperature before developing a certain sourness. Still, its a decent American take on the German Pilsener style and would make a good session beer."
"Standard pilsener hue under clingy foam fingers. Aromas of grass, dandelions and fresh donuts. Just a perfectly balanced malt and hop concoction so ultimately drinkable I wish I had a case of cases in the basement. Rivals the best out of Duetschland."
" It has a nice golden hue but also that grassy nose similar to Heineken and other mainstream imports. There is a bit of chewiness to the flavor and it is a good crisp, drinking beer but it is very non-distinctive. The label promotes it as ""reflective of Europe's finest pilsners"". I've noted before that it reminds me more of Heineken than of Christofel Blonde so I would be curious to know what they regard as a fine pilsner."
"Poured a big fluffy white head atop a beautiful gold beer with good head retention i think this on has a little bit of Carapils malt in it to achieve this. Aroma is extremely light and the only thing i can detect is a little toasty bread. Taste has a definite saaz hop character with a very mild malt balance that gets bolder after each sip. Body is pretty good for the style though it is a little light and tends to make the hop flavors subside quickly. I would much rather have a Trippel for the same price or at least a Pine Mountain Pils from Deschutes."
"This beer has a nice gold color to it, and is very clear. It is well carbonated and pours with a nice thick white/ cream head. The aroma is herbal and slightly grassy in a hoppy sort of way. From the first taste it is hops, there is a nice clean bitterness to it with subdued hop flavor. It is nice dry and refreshing, with a bit of maltiness as well."
"Golden orange color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is grassy, herbal and hoppy. A medium bodied pilsner. The flavor is crisp and hoppy. The malts are sweet and fruity. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is slightly sweet, some bitterness"
"This reminds me of a Bohemian pilsner. Softer, less crisp and less clean tasting than it's German counterpart. The beer poured out a pale and somewhat cloudy pale yellow. Sticky white head that clung to the glass like meringue. Subtle lemon grass and sweet grains in the aroma. Hop bitterness is a bit weak and the taste is a bit muddled, but not a bad American version of the style. Drinkable in it's own right."
"Flavor: It had a very dry, flat flavor. OK, I didn't like it that much. I guess I'm not a big pilsener fan. I'd advise sticking w/ their Belgian styles"
"Update  I reviewed this a month after joining the site back in the fall of 2003 so thought it would be run to re-rate it with a 2004 vintage. I juggled a few scores around but still ended up with a solid 4.0. Good job, New Belgium. This is a hard style to nail."
"This would be a nice transitional beer for someone who likes your standard American swill as they enter ""micro"" territory. And this would be a good time to turn on the grill and get some garden fresh veggies on it."
"Pours a sparkling yellow with a mountainous white fluffy head. Hops are there, and I can smell light malt. Taste starts out with a hint of malt, but this is quickly flung aside by a wave of tart, sprucey, spicy, bitter hops. I like, although it could be a little more balanced. Mouthfeel is adequate, not too thin; plenty of carbonation. I'm starting to get into pilsners (finally) and this one did not disappoint too much."
"Not bad, but not something that I will seek out again."
"Overall impression: A quite smooth and drinkable beer. Refreshing. No overpowering flavors."
"One of the more authentic American pils I've run across. And probably one of the better ones too."
"Pours a very pale straw yellow in color. It has a small fizzy head that goes away quite quickly. Fair amount of hops to the nose. Similar amount of hoppiness to the taste, which overpowers a slight sweetness. A mediocre pilsner, but still not too bad. I'm still amazed that this brewery can put out some really good beers, followed by some very non-descript ones. If you want a good pilsner, try Victory Prima Pils to see what one should really taste like!"
"Thanks to bditty187"
"This is pilsner beer. If I close my eyes, I can here the church bells ringing in Prague.In a pilsner glass, it stands tall,bright golden with virgin white,puffy top. Classic grassy,floral hop nose that begets a sturdy malt accented flavor with a floral,grassy hop flavor. Very crips and clean with no caffeine. This is the beer you want after a long bike ride or an afternoon of gardening. A fresh example of a traditional European brew. The malt touch is perfect, just enough structure to keep it interesting while still light enough to quench your thirst. Drink and feel the history of lager yeast brewing."
"A pretty drinkable but forgettable brew..ok i suppose."
"Nice pilsner. If I can't get a Czechvar or Pilsner Urquell you could gimme one of these and I wouldn't feel slighted."
"Golden color, great carbonation, nice aroma... anyone in the mood for sausage & mustard?"
"Acquired via trade. I have never really been a fan of the style and this one didn't really change my mind on the matter. Pours a light gold color with a medium thin off-white head and rather lively carbonation. Not much lacing to speak of. Aroma is actually rather pleasant, delivering a nice crisp hops, citrus and malt experience to the nose. Unfortunately the flavor did not match up to the aroma. I found this to be a little harsh flavor-wise, and not as clean as I was hoping. Hops flavor was nice but there was something off in the mix. Dry finish. Okay but New Belgium has better to offer."
"Golden hazy brew with a very sticky head that mostly settles. Very sharp hoppiness in the aroma, the signature of a good Euro-pilsner. Subtle maltiness is also present. Good sharp and spicy hop bite in the flavor as well, with a very supportive malt backbone of graininess. Good body for a pilsner, still light, but flavorful. Smooth, yet still hoppy finish. A very good pilsner, but since this isn't a favorite style mine, it's just above average ignoring the style. I'd recommend it to any fan of pilsners."
"Pours a very clear and very pale golden color with one massive white head. The smell of cooked veggies and a light black peppery hop is the dominant aroma here. Very nice! The taste reveals more of the black peppery-spiced hop bite and light grainy malt and a lightly sweetened corn. This light to medium bodied pils drinks down pretty easy and finishes crisp and watery clean. Very good brew! Cheers!"
"Pours a deep golden color with a white fluffy head. Smell is of malts and grain with a little bit of sweetness. A very crisp fresh taste with a sweet maltiness up front and the hops making for a bitter finish. A medium mouth feel with very good carbonation. This is the first real pilsner I've tried and I wasn't real impressed but I did not dislike it. Another solid brew from New Belgium."
"Pours a golden straw color with a thin white head that dissipate into a nice lace. Fresh grains dominate the aroma with some malty notes. A bit spicy on the tongue with a touch of lemon and a nice blend of sweet malts and bitter hops. Finish is crisp and refreshing. One of the best of the New Belgium Brewing line of beers."
"On the pour the beer is a crystal clear gold color with an impressive head that is brilliant white with the residual lace a fine sheet to cling mightily to the glass. Nose is malt, clean, crisp, as most Lagers/Pils seem to be. Front is malt and slightly sweet, the top skinny, the finish has a splendid hop presence, pleasingly carbonated, droughty long lasting aftertaste. Im a big fan of New Belgium, and proudly say that this is one of a handful of Lagers/Pils, that I actually like."
"New Belgiums Blue paddle Pilsener Lager is a full flavored lager, that goes well with a good Chicago style hot dog and all the trimmings or any number of food groups, and even by its self."
"I am not usually a fan of pilsners, but this beer is quality all the way.  The color is a nice golden clear with a foamy white head.  The aroma is spicy and inviting.  The smooth body supports a bold spicy hop presence with a dry malt character.  The light lingering bitterness finishes off a tasty interpretation."
"I found this Pilsner crisp and refreshing.  It has the appearance and functions of what you should expect in a Pilsner.  A formidable head, lace remains good number of bubbles.  I really like this beer.  It might be a broken record for me but New Belgium makes a great freakin beer!"
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"The large initial head settles into a thin but tight and stubborn one that leaves a very attractive lace all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Very light golden hue that approaches a straw color.  The spicy, lemon zest - like unskunked Saaz aroma is quite enjoyable.  A very clean noble hop bitterness and prickly carbonation hits the palette at first, but a smooth and mildly biscuity graininess quickly ensues and provides for a well balanced experience all around.  The mouthfeel and malt profile is just a tad lacking when compared to good (unskunked) European pilsners. In any case, I'll take this to a skunked and poorly traveled import any day. Blue Pabble is quite refreshing and crisp."
"This reminded me of many of the European lager/pils offerings. I was impressed with its very fresh taste and hoppy snap on the finish. A very nice interpretation of a pils. I wish it were available in my neck of the woods. Good stuff."
