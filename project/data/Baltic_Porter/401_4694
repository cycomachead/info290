The taste is of dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt, not overwhelming and not a strong bitter tasting stout. In fact it had a little sweet taste upfront, with only light bitterness afterwards, well balanced. It was very smooth and very enjoyable to drink. Will be looking out for this one again in the future. Recommended, but be careful it is strong despite how smooth it goes down!","Thisdrinkinglife","Dec 10, 2014"

Better than Ol' Rasputin for sure, and way cheaper. Packs a decent punch with 7% ABV and sometimes serves as my morning donut replacement on Saturdays or Sundays. Much enjoyed for the price, but it you're looking for more complexity, you won't find it here. Regardless, it is still tantalizing to the taste buds and serves more than enough alcohol for dessert without getting too inebriated.","BSDA","Dec 01, 2014"

Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, roasted malt, raisin, plum, herbal, light nuttiness, and yeast/toasty earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/roasted malt and yeast ester notes; with solid strength.

Nice balance and solid complexity of dark/roasted malt and yeast ester flavors; with good robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good Baltic porter. Good balance and solid complexity of dark/roasted malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV.

The Baltika 6 is a Baltic Porter which are typically strong and sweet and the 6 is no exception. It poured a dark brown to black with a thin tan head. The first taste was instantly molasses, dark and sweet. The sweetness remained as it warmed, but the molasses relaxed a bit with a fuller malt profile.

I distinctly remember liking #'s 6 & 9 and a friend found the 6 and brought it over to relive the experience. It was as good as I remember and nice to know it actually was a porter since I was just guessing. I like the color and aroma - I get a few hits of cocoa and coffee in the taste and I think the finish is nice and smooth and even a little thick - I pleasantly try to suck some of the flavor off the sides of my mouth. I like this one and I think it's my favorite out of Russia.","SteveTheDog","Jun 10, 2013"

The aroma is dark fruity with caramel and burnt sugars and a hint of chocolate with a touch of alcohol. Sweet grainy honey like pilsener malt surprisingly shines through. The flavor follow the aroma quite well. Sweet grainy pilsner with some dark and burnt sugars touched off with some chocolate and some sweet sugar coated dark fruits. Long lingering sweet finish with a touch of ethanol. Medium body with a sweet slick mouthfeel and a moderate level of carbonation. Not a bad porter, certainly not over the top flavored like some Americanized versions, but kind of nice with it's subtleties.","johnnnniee","Apr 02, 2013"

Pours the color and clarity of cola with a 1.5 inch khaki-colored head that sizzles and pops and slowly recedes into a sudsy skim. Nose expresses dark, vinous fruits, lager yeast and a hint of oxidation. Taste follows nose; however, it all comes off a bit watered down with a very assertive German-lager skunk that lingers between quaffs. There's also a trace of toffee and roast mixed into the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a slight acidity. Overall, decent and drinkable. Not the best example of the style, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down if offered.

The aroma was of macro grains, toasted malt, a little brown sugar and carmeleized sugars as well as some slightly roasted elements. I instantly thought it an odd beer upon tasting because it seemed to walk that line between a macro brew and a good homebrew. I tasted a strong amount of adjunct grains, corn and rice in particular, but behind that the more complex elements of nuts, toasted and roasted malt, some extra sugars (sucanat? molasses?) and bread.

Head retention was a good as it stayed with the brew as it reduced down to about a one-finger head. The smell was just as amazing with wisps of dark chocolate, cocoa powder, and something akin to roasted hazelnuts. The flavors just add to the symphony of delight; dark chocolate, cocoa powder (like taking cocoa powder and adding just a tad bit of water to make a paste and eating it!), caramel, warm bread, plums, raisins, a twinge of hops, cloves, and more! This brew is full bodied (but not too thick) and no real detection of alcohol. Definitely not a session brew as this one is made to be savored very slowly as I found the tastes and smells just amassed as the brew slowly warmed up. Something that could easily be enjoyed all year long, I can see this one being especially comforting on those wintry days spent by the fireside.","awmiller","Jul 22, 2011"

Just to that side of opacity, black trumps brown in the final round, quite clean appearance, ring of dark mahogany and orange around the rims. The nose is sort of annoyingly light but comes up with milk chocolate, coffee candy, golden raisin, apricot, pear scents, unusually lacking in darker fruit, very little roast to it, brush of ginger spice, the hoppiness stiffens things before its final dissolve. Light-bodied, comes across as somewhat watery for a porter, the lack of body here does bring the roast to the fore as it is needed to buttress the cocoa, chocolate, caramel shades. In the same vein, lemon to orange citrus comes forth, accompanied by a brown sugar dusting. The grains, oats and breadiness swell slightly in the middle. Raisin, date, cherry, apricot, a good mix of flavors but needs more richness.

The taste emphasizes the pine and spruce and really brings the florals out from the shadows. The darker aspects are still there, with the molasses and brown sugar leading the way, but they are much more balanced with the other elements than in the nose.

The first two were less then stellar to say the least. This one is starting off much better then the rest. The aroma is semi sweet bakers chocolate, dates, raisins, cream, and caramel. Wow, the aroma is pretty top notch. The bar has been raised. The flavor profile follows suit with bitter dark chocolate leading the way. Subtle toffee notes follow with dates and figs coming though also. A hint of oats come and roasted grains. This is a really well rounded beer. Rather tasty. At the very end of the flavor profile comes sweet raisins. The mouthfeel is odd. Unlike any other beer I've ever had. If starts really creamy. Almost as if they mashed with oats. Coats the mouth with dark chocolate, then comes the odd thing. This beer finishes really, really dry. Reminds me more of a finish on saison then a porter. Creamy and dry, it's a rather odd combination of sensations. While not my first rodeo with Baltika beers, it definitely is the best ride I've had.

Its light-medium bodied with a fizzy amount of carbonation. I'm not exactly sure why I was smelling the DMS but it was certainly the most noticeable aroma of this beer, the flavor was nice but not complex in the least and the body felt a little thin for the style.

The mouthfeel was a tad thin even though the bubbles were small enough to get close to the silky texture they were no doubt shooting for. Overall a nice example and a unique creamy milk chocolate/mocha type sweetness that isn't overdone but just right. I was expecting an average beer but happily I got something much better.

The aroma is a bit underwhelming with some cheap, simple malt smell that happily doesn't come through much in the flavor. The flavor is well-balanced, particularly for a porter, a style that a lot of breweries tend to take too far, in my opinion. There's an excellent roasted malt note, burnt without getting too harsh. The malt is also sweet with caramel and fruit. This is a calmer, more drinkable Baltic Porter than most from American breweries.

The upgraded bottling is definitely better for exporting. Pours a very dark reddish brown with a big brown head that lasts. Smells and tastes of roasted malts and dark chocolate, though neither the aromas nor flavors are as powerful and complex as those of other popular porters. The lingering chocolatey finish is my favorite part of this beer. It's medium-heavy weight manages to be creamy and quite satisfying.

The aroma is dark, roasty and sweet. There is a strong note of licorice. It is medium-full bodied, smooth and slick. The finish is a little sticky. It tastes sweet and roasty like the aroma. There are notes of caramel, chocolate-covered cherries and licorice. I like that this isn't as sweet as some other Baltic porters. It's balanced more toward a roasty bitterness.

Taste was well developed, balanced, and quite enjoyable, starting with a sweet, almost creamy licorice and cherry-tinged malt backbone. This sweetness was tempered very nicely by the bracing carbonation and roasty cherry-chocolate finish. Mouthfeel was extrordinarily smooth, with the right amount of fullness.

The aroma is nice, it smells like roasted malt, dark fruit (mostly cherries), caramel, toffee and chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit, molasses, smoke and a bit of alcohol (which becomes less noticable as the beer warms up). Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with medium carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and has a slight dry finish. It's easy to drink, too.

Chocolate covered raisins,roasted caramel malts and a good amount of hoppy bitterness. Again a very sweet and almost root beer/tootsie pop like sweetness throughout. A slightly dry and gritty feel keeps things tough enough to call this a good solid Porter.

It had plenty of malt and hops in the flavor but they were well balanced out. I felt like I could taste a syrup in the flavor maybe used to brew the beer and I could also taste the 7.0% alcohol on the back of my tongue as I swallowed (my wife said the alcohol taste reminded her of soy sauce.)

The taste was also too sweet. This is the third Baltic Porter that I've tried and this is one of those styles that will never be top tier for me.

Smells plesantly malty, gentle hops and gentle all around, no detectable alcohol aromas, sweet malts but not so much as to intimidate. Taste is a fairly sweet baltic porter, not overwhelmingly sweet, not as high-fi as others, and not as lager like or off tasting as others I've tried. Darker malts make a fair show here, while the body of the beer seems balanced and not overly pale malt focused, nor overly caramel focused (like some traditional dopplebocks, say). The baltic porter lager yeast characteristic is present here with a slightly sweet flavor and yet slightly drying with a bit of cocoa finish prevails giving it character. Where is the alcohol? None detected. Impressive. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full but certain in the medium bodied catergory, but not light for the style, nor overly carbonated. Wow, this beer impressed me more than other top rated baltic porters, and Baltika is a surprising contended again along with their #4. While I wouldn't choose this beer often as I don't care for the finish and baltic porter characteristics too often, this is the best I've tasted yet of this style.

Also present are hints of Queen Anne chocolate covered cherries. Flavors are of very malty and lager-clean: bready, nutty, and lightly roasted. Slight bitterness comes at the end, but I can't tell whether or not it's from the hops, alcohol, or astringent roasted grain. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky, but too light for me.

The aroma is on the malty side with some fruitiness. The taste seems a bit restrained, it has the right elements, but I would like them to be a bit bolder.

Roasted coffee aroma with some fruit, including bananas, oddly enough. The flavor is sweeter than I expected. Malty, but doesn't tasted too much like roasted malt. A little chocolate flavor. All in all, this beer is fairly bland. Light hoppiness. Much better than most of Baltika's beers, but as a Baltic porter, this is merely average.","beveragecaptain","Oct 01, 2005"

The beer has a medium full body that just starts to coat the mouth. This beer is quite drinkable, smooth and creamy it goes down quite easily. There is a lingering burnt note that sticks around long after the beer has left my mouth; this is not a bad thing though, more like a lingering roast coffee note.

Slightly thin in the mouthfeel, but it ads to drinkability as this is not as heavy a hitter as some baltics.

As the bottle was uncapped, and beer poured, the dark brown - bordering on pitch black  body was revealed, and a half inch thick brown head formed briefly, before receding to a thin collar of foam. Aroma was more fruity and vinous than a typical porter with a smell consisting of chocolate covered plums, cherries, and raisins. Taste was also devoid of much roastiness, with sweet plum and caramel flavors dominating. There was scant evidence of faded roast grain flavor if I let the beer linger longer on the palette. Slight oxidation was apparent in the aftertaste with a hint of soy. As complex as it was, I can think of several craft Baltic style Porters that are better.

It's delicately crisp in the mouth with a fine-bubbled standard carbonation that's somewhat subdued by its medium-full body... gently tingling I might call it. The flavor is more fruity than the nose suggests, and it's loaded with caramel and toasted brown sugar as opposed to chocolate; and, unfortunately, it's hindered by a touch of alcohol that wasn't really noticeable in the nose.

Slight chocolate came through as well, but mainly the coffee/cappuccino odor.

Aftertaste was there, mainly of bitter coffee, which was nice.

Could be fusels or hops, hard to tell, but I lean towards the former. Roasted and chocolate malts dry the mouth out in the finish, and the entire beer seems to shrink in your mouth.

Taste is of bittersweet chocolate, slightly fruity without being cloying. Overall a good, drinkable beer. My only real complaint is that it could stand to be a bit more robust.

Nice tannish head, a vigorous pour leaves a good two inches, but it dissipates down to a thin skin after a few moments. Thick lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is nice, somewhat clean, and a little bit of mocha coffee. The taste is nice and rich, very heavily malts, with flavors of coffee and a bit of dark chocolate. Nice rich aftertaste, with rich roasted malts. Very lightly hopped to avoid any cloying malt taste. Rich and pleasant smooth mouthfeel. Easy to drink, although its got a fairly heavy 7 percent alcohol by volume bite. Nice, and a great buy at $1.45 a half liter.","jackndan","Feb 14, 2004"

Taste: Sweeter up fron some plum and raisin like tones with chocolate and a mild coffee finish not bad compared to other Baltika products I have had. Mouthfeel: A bit thin for a big baltic porter medium to light in body with steady carbonation, not too impressed by anything.

This beer exemplifies a porter; malty with just the right amount of hops to keep it from being sweet with hardly any bitterness. Full mouthfeel without being chewy.

The color was a black color, noth letting any light what so ever through it, kind of like a black hole. The head was tan, thick and frothy in the beginning and lasted the whole drink. The head did trail off a little towards the end, but was still a solid covering. The smell was not alcoholy at all. It was more geared towards plums, grapes, and other ""dark"" fruits. The taste was very similar, but a little heavier on the malt side. It has a nice sweet taste to it, but nothing too sweet, just right. I would say this is one well balanced out beer. Overall a great beer to explore. Every temperature change in the brew ushers in new tastes.","JISurfer","Jan 13, 2004"

3.01,-16.6,4,3,3,2.5,3,"My first Russian beer. While I'm not thrilled by it, its not horrible, either. It poured a black that was as dark as the Detroit Tigers recent season. There was a pretty decent tan head at first, but it quickly faded, leaving a tan ring and a sligjhtly foamy film at the top. Smell was a slightly odd mingling of dark toasty malt and a subdued sweetness. Taste was of dark, toasted coffeeish malt and a caramel candybar sweetness. There was no hop taste to speak of. I think this could have been a little more bitter - its just too sweet for my porter tastes. Perhaps Baltika has invented a new style of porter - the candy porter. The mouthfeel of this porter is a little on the thin side. I don't think its sweetness and alcohol content lends itself well to repeated bottles - one is definitely all I need tonight.","woemad","Oct 06, 2003"
3.08,-14.7,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"This Baltic Porter is a bit of a disappointment. It pours a roofing tar black with a fast rising and equally fast dissipating head and some trailing lace. The aroma is of mild malt and a slightly smoky odor. The sweet malt body is doughy and a little pasty. Dark chocolate and coffee notes come through loud and clear. The hop flavor is difficult to define as it is masked within the strength of the roasted malt and noticeable alcohol. I think I taste a bit of lemony citrus and mild spiciness. It could use a more acidic hop attack, an essence of pine and a tad more burnt caramel flavor common in quality Baltic Porters.","BeerResearcher","Sep 28, 2003"

Mostly malt in the lightly sweet nose, fresh and clean, the start sweet and malt-laden top is skeletal in feel. Finish is mildly carbonated, hops pleasant in their spiciness, very dry, some what tart, and a drinkable beer, but not really anything to scream about.","Gusler","Sep 12, 2003"
3.2,-11.4,3,3,3.5,4,2.5,"Notes: The alcohol is a bit deceiving at 7.0% abv, as I said before a bit too sweet for me which took away from the drinkablity. A small glass of this with a chocolate dessert would be nice.","Jason","Aug 10, 2003"

Smells of sweet brown sugar with some roasted coffee and a hint of alcohol. First taste is of roasted coffee combined with strong alcohol flavor (vodka?). But that doesn't dominate the palate. This is a very sweet beer and the main flavors seem to be molasses and english toffee. Bitter hops waver in and out and never seem to settle. Finishes with more malty sweetness. A complex brew that warms the body.","granger10","Jul 31, 2003"

There is something about the taste and mouthfeel that is off to some degree. It's a little thin, and there is a strange taste I can't describe. Not to say that this is a bad beer, just not as good as I thought it would be. I'll have to try it again some time. Appearance is as expected, alcohol not noticed in taste. IMO, can't compare to Fuller's (or Samuel Smith and Liberty, for that matter).","JohnnyDuvel","Jun 20, 2003"

Shortly afterward, the head disappears, leaving very slight lacing, which slides down the glass behind the beer. The aroma is of dark roasted malt and a bit of chocolate, followed by very slight hops. Flavor is rich, with distinct chocolate and coffee, and a malty finish. The finish evolves into molasses. A bit of hop bitter hangs in the back of the throat. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a crisp finish. Very drinkable.

Smell is gorgeous with dark fruits, I detect cherry, melon, star fruit, and for sure bananas, hardly anything else, but who cares, this is awesome, its like a frickin fruit salad, super enchanting and pleasing nose. Tastes like no other I've had, mostly up front of banana and light, sweet roasted malt, very unusual and interestingly yummy. A bit like candied fruits but no sugary stuff, just the fruit, dark and rich. The feel is medium and quite full, very smooth and easy - no tricks to this creation.

The aroma is full, with a touch of nut. The taste is full-bodied and smooth - cherries, nuts. a touch of chocolate. All of this with nice hoppy undertones. It's strong, but not overpowering, and the alcohol comes naturally, rather than being suger induced like most Russian ""strong"" beers. Just don't have more than two.
