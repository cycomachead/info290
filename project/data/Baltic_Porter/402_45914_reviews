"Overall: a pleasant mix of attributes from a good lager, the maltiness of a porter and the saltiness of an oyster stout. Good with chicken, bbq or any grilled meats – palate cleansing and not so powerful as to overwhelm your meal."
"1/14...pours very dark brown with some white foam. Coffee nose, faint, little bitter. Strong coffee bitter flavor. Some grittiness. Smooth chocolate coffee all around. Very good."

"O - Fantastic beer, perfect for a snowy winter day"

"12 oz bottle, dated 10/25/13.rnrnquite dark, but not quite black. off-white head, decent retention. fairly muted mild aroma, just a bit of roasty bitter chocolate. taste is similar - smooth well balanced flavor, just mild cocoa, malt dominant. very nice mouthfeel, very smooth, fully bodied yet easy to drink. rnrnoverall - a nice winter seasonal brew."

"O- not a bad beer but definitely not a Baltic Porter and much more of a lager (as the yeast used is lager) than the big robust porter I was expecting."
"O: Not my favorite interpretation of the style, but not terrible. As a BOCK, though, it's actually pretty killer. Since I'm not much of a bock fan, this one ends up being merely okay to my frazzled taste buds."
"o - overall a nice beer, but for those looking for a baltic porter, you might be barking up the wrong tree with this one as it is heavily lager influenced...kind of what i would call a black lager."

"Complex for a lager, this is easy to drink. It was made for winter, and fits that season well, but good all-year-round. It held up very well for a 10-month-old beer. This was enjoyable. I will look out for it this winter!"

"All in all, a very pleasant surprise."

"12oz bottle. thanks mike67. Pours a dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma and Taste is of roasted caramel malt, some cacao notes and mild dark fruit and mild bitterness. Palate is medium body with moderate carbonation. The finish is mildly sweet roasted caramel, some cacao and a touch of dark fruit on the end with some bitterness for balance. Overall a good drinking brew."
"Overall: On its way to a delicious beer, but could use another kick of dark malts to really grab the attention."
"Overall: Love the style. These guys honor it. Would definitely drink again."

"I didn't have high expectations for this but it was actually pretty good."
"Today might be the first day of Spring according to the calendar, but it is still plenty chilly enough to warrant drinking this beer. My aggro pour raised a finger of dense, deep-tan head with reasonable retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown allowing only a modicum of light to penetrate except around the edges, revealing cola highlights. Nose was rich with notes of dark chocolate, anise, and toffee. Mouthfeel was full and creamy with a very chocolaty/licorice taste on the tongue. Finish was semi-dry and the rye gave it a spicy kick. The lacing that it left behind really covered the glass. While it was not really my choice of style, it was stylistically quite good."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/26/2012. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, cocoa, toast, dark bread, light coffee, clove, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; a bit muted though. Taste of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, raisin, cocoa, toast, dark bread, light coffee, clove, and floral earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toast, raisin, dark bread, light coffee, clove, and floral earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and robustness of flavors, with good complexity; great balance of malt and yeast esters; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good baltic porter style. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"A good beer, but it doesn't compare to the other well known baltic porters, and for the price, I'd stick with Okocim."

"O- Lacks the boldness I was looking forward to. Because of that, it makes an ok porter but not my favorite Baltic. One and done IMO."
"Poured from a brwon12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of licorice, some malts. Taste is roasted malts, chocolate, licorice, good flavor, well balanced. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a pretty good beer."
"This is a pretty decent baltic porter. Good amount of ABV that is pretty well hidden. That said, it is kind of one dimensional and really doesn't excite my taste buds. It's good - but nothing that I'll really crave."
""

""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours brown with an off-white, long lasting foamy head. Nose is bready, toasted malt, hints of dark fruit and piney hops. Body is medium and smooth. Taste is of bready, toasted malt, brown sugar, spicy hops and hints of dark fruit. Finish is long, semi-dry. Well made, balanced brew."
"D- Not sure this needs to be called a Baltic Porter as there are many 7.5% porters with lesser titles. The feel is a little thin but the taste is great. Right now at less than 2 bucks a bottle this is a great price and will do. This is a great night time porter to relax to."

"I love the style; however, this version was adequate, but drinkable. In any case, it does NOT exemply a Baltic Porter as it has become to be known and loved - and quaffed. Oh Catherine, stop f--- that horse and pour me another Baltic Porter."
"O-a very boring Baltic porter. The flavors are almost muted. Sometimes with this styles, the basic ingredients are supposed to speak for themselves. If not, sometimes the added ingredients help a lot. This just has nothing going for it at all. I don't recommend it at all."
""
""

""

"O: A rich, sweet and relatively balanced porter with plenty of malt character to back up the near 7% ABV. A little grainy and slick, so its still rough around the edges, but it's as welcome of a brew on a cool spring night as a late fall one."
"O - Nice porter. Depths of malt flavor are tasty and keep me wanting more."

"Medium body, lower carbonation. Slight warmth in the chest. Interesting beer, not bad."

"Overall, this beer doesn't impress me. I was expecting something more. I would not go out of my way for this rather average beer."
""
"O- This is a good beer. It has a solid flavor and feel while not being too simple. Good all around beer."
"O: A bit of an odd smell and taste. Head was way too fizzy. Slightly above average Baltic porter here."
"Overall I like it a lot, mostly because I've put 14 hours of hard work day in at MCB Quantico."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a dark, copper color with one finger of khaki colored head. It retained as a collar and lefts streaks of lacing. The aroma was of roasted malt, caramel malt and chocolate. The flavors were full of chocolate notes with some light nuts, figs, prunes and caramel along with some alcohol heat that appeared as it warmed up. The mouthfeel was smooth and full, the body full and the carbonation light. Despite being full of chocolate it wasn’t overly sweet and I found it highly enjoyable."

"O - Solid brew, unremarkable in any one measure."

"Fits style - enjoyable fireside brew."
""
"FYI label says 6.8%abv."
""
"Worthy"

"D- Not bad just nothing very exciting here just a pretty bland porter."
"O - No wonder it's from Delaware... these guys must be Eagles fans, affected by Reed's dismal Eagles. I'm Philly-proud, but the heralded dream-team shit the bed. I'm gonna try Old Dominion's other products in the future, and pass this one up. Maybe I had a bad bottle, or maybe the other reviewers just haven't had Zywiec and Okocim? I dunno, but I know those are hallmarks of great brewing, anything failing to come close isn't worth your time."
""
"Overall - I think this a decent well crafted Baltic porter, easy to drink and great for newbies to the style. I've had some others that were much more harsh."
""
"O - Dominion's Baltic Porter is a very solid, enjoyable winter beer. Definitely a nice way to spend a cold evening."
" caramel and coffee tones dominated this from the beginning. Very sweet smelling, with a hint of chocolate on the back. Very full aroma, and a hint of alcohol. Initial taste was loaded with caramel and chocolate tones. A touch of alcohol warmed it up as well. Lots of roasted coffee tones in the back, and a nice bitter, dry hoppy finish. This was a really well rounded and full taste. Very nice indeed. Very full, pretty much stout like in feel. Rich creamy with very good carbonation."
"Y - On first opening it I was excited because it smelt very sweet. The taste answered the call of the smell. It was very malty, a little too malty for a porter. It tastes a bit too much like the Oak Barrel Stout. It has a small bite in the beginning, smoothing out at the end. All in all I give it a C+. Not bad, not spectacular, worth a try."
"O: Decent enough, but I don't love it."
"O - I could have a couple but not my first choice by far."
"As far as local/regional beers, however, I'll take Flying Dog Gonzo Porter any day over this."
"Drinkability: A very nice and somewhat unique Baltic porter. Definitely a great winter brew, and another great offering from Dominion."
"Pours a deep dark charcoal brown near black with a nice lasting tight beige head. Aroma is lightly hopped, a touch of mint and pine over big chocolate malts, smooth nutty sweetness, toast, and light burnt hint with a touch of diacetyl. Flavor is clean, with good chocolate hints, roast, toffee moderate sweetness and a light leathery earthy finish to dry it out some. But something was lacking from this porter."
"Overall, a solid example of the style. Well balanced and not too crazy, this is an approachable offering that would serve as a good introduction to Baltic Porters."
"Drinkability- Overall this is an alright beer. Not great, but not a drainpour either. I could probably kick back a few of these in a night, but I dont think I will buy another sixer of these."
"D = The drinkability on this one is pretty high. It taste good, feels okay and goes down quite easily."
"not a bad beer, a bit lacking in spots, worth trying if it is easy to obtain."
"As soon as you taste the beer those flavors are confirmed in the beginning with chocolate and coffee, than turning sweeter into caramel and brown sugar, but being checked by the bittersweetness of hops. Nice medium body almost a little creamy mouhfeel.Maybe just a little more carbonation would do the beer good.A very drinkable winterbrew. Very good job."
"Pours a moderately dark brown color with a tan head. Nose is of caramel, a bit if roast, chocolate, and dark fruits. The taste is mildly fruity with some darker flavors taking the front. Good feel with good carbonation and a bt of heat. Drinks well bt fairly ordinary."
"As to drinkability it holds up remarkably well. The flavors are not so powerful that you've discovered all of its nuances within the first half of the glass, nor is it so powerful that you've blanketed your palate or become tired of it. It's maltiness is not overdone, nor is it underdone; and it's quite smooth across the palate. It's actually a really nice beer. Well worth trying!"
"It's as straightforward as a Baltic Porter can be, balanced the fruitiness and the roastiness well and is smooth as velvet. What's not to like? Six years is a long time to wait between samples...but I think they have improved the recipe since then"
"drinkability: good"
"Very easy to drink and hides the abv extremely well."
"every flavor i experienced in this beer was incredibly sharp. the drink starts mellow enough with some wood and chocolate notes. like any good porter, though, the experience comes in when the brew settles on your pallete. there i found a medium body and exceptionally strong bitters. i like a bitter beer (a lot) but honestly it was too much for me. the wood becomes an oak note (similar to a good tennessee whiskey) and just keeps getting stronger and more distinct. when you first swallow, the finish is almost painful. in a way, your mouth gets used to it before too long, but it's still one of the strongest beers i've ever tried."
"Smells of some chocolate and strong fruity notes. Raisins and more, can't pin it down too much. Some hoppy aromas present as well. Tastes of more chocolate, slightly astringent. There some more fruit as well but more subdued. A surprising, though slight alcohol warmth. Finishes with slight hoppy bitterness."
"D - Overall, a very solid brew, and one I'm glad to have had the opportunity to partake. A solid offering from Old Dominion. I would recommend it to my BA friends."
"Nearly black. Nose is mainly roasted malt with a bit of sweetness. The taste shocked the hell out of me. I honestly didn't expect much as I'm not overly hot on OD these days but this beer is money. Its got a bigger body than most crisp baltic porters, its a bit more substantial, big enough roasted malt to know its a porter and the sweetness is subtle enough for me. If this thing was hopped up a hair, I think it would be incredible. Well done, OD, I'm not going to be so hesitant from now on to try new things from you."
"Drinkability: A decent porter. I was expecting more from this beer, however. For something billed as a Baltic Porter, I was expecting a bit more complexity to it. Regardless, this is a decent beer and a good winter seasonal."
" ~ I'm very impressed with this beer. I really appreciate the way this porter is crafted. I recommend this brew to all porter fans."
"Altogether, this was a solid porter that was a bit on the stronger side. It was a nice showing from ODB, although I would've liked to have seen it brewed & bottled in VA instead of DE. This is a nice winter beer and I will definitely buy more."
"D- Rich, beautiful beer, really enjoyed and was ready for more...I need to get a six pack of this gem!"
"Poured a dark, almost black body with a tan head on top of a stoutish smell of roasted malts, coffee, toffee and hints of dark chocolate. A smooth, creamy, stick medium almost full body that has a sweet taste of chocolate and a tad vanilla as well as a mix of roasted and toffee malts. Gives off a balance as it is smooth and passes easily but finishes crisp and dry. A duller than top notch porter but still a good beer that is enjoyable and will pick you up in the winter."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly, it's not half bad! That recent Beach House whatever was a complete dud for me, and their Oktoberfest was so-so, so I was a little hesitant in regards to this winter seasonal, but here I am, enjoying this bottle while watching Blade Runner. It's smooth and easily drinkable with a nice dark maltiness, like a poor man's Kalamazoo Stout."
"Overall this was a good beer and I was a fan of the light smokiness. Worth a shot."
"This beer pleasantly surprised me. I bought a six-pack at the brand-new Wegman's in Dulles/Sterling, VA."
"Overall - Very enjoyable, flavorful beer that stands out for taste and mouthfeel. Very reasonably priced as well. A great value purchase."
"this beer cuts through. Sometimes a brew tastes amazing up front, but falls short half way through and doesn't taste like anything. This beer always keeps it's hoppy bitterness meets touch of molasses sweetness. You'll always have a nice taste in your mouth when drinking this brew. It's similar to terrapin's india ale. It lingers longer though."
"Pretty decent local brew. Can't say that I've had a Baltic Porter before, but this tastes like every American Porter I've had, just like the other reviewers said. The description on the back of the bottle says it's a ""bottom-fermented lager"" with ""German Pilsner, Crystal, Dark Specialty Malts & a touch of Rye."" Could someone explain this to me? How is this not an ale? And does that mix of malts make for a typical American lager?"
"A nice, drinkable beer, especially warming at 7% ABV. Finishes very rounded and nicely balanced. Its Christmas....only with chocolate."
"Beer is sweet and has a lot of bitterness from the roast at the back end. The sweetness is interesting, adds nice connectivity, but the roast at the end definitely wins. Its not coffee flavored at all, just an interesting malt flavor, a little coffee in the aftertaste. Body is a little thin but I would say the drinkability is high."
"Pours an opaque dark chocolate brown with a thick tan head. Rich aroma is chocolaty with smoky, nutty and coffee hints. Flavor is like a fine chilled mocha, mainly of chocolate and coffee with smoky, nutty and molasses touches. Texture is smooth, fizzy and lively - a winner."
"Not bad. I dug the overll flavors and interaction here for the Baltic Porter style, but I just wish that they had been a bit more aggressive and defined. I'd like to see them continue to work on this recipe, as this has the potential to be a really solid Winter seasonal from them."
"D: I enjoy the Baltic Porter, but I must admit I have a hard time drinking a lot of it at once. I can't identify any off-flavors that would explain that, but my best guess is that I'm expecting a stout -- which is not necessarily a good reason. The Baltic Porter is a great example of the differences between a porter and a stout: the Baltic Porter lacks the coffee-like astringency that I expect from stouts, but it still has a lot of flavor and feels like a big beer. That said, I suspect I also don't session Baltic Porter because it is a ""bigger"" beer and has the associated ABV."
"Served: in an faceted mug."
"Overall, not a bad beer. But there are so many authentic European examples available that this isn't particularly one to seek out. A nice, worthwhile effort though."
"HV"
"M: medium bodied. Mild carbonation level. Very robust, as well as being smooth and creamy."
"Pours a clear dark brown color with purple highlights. Two fingers of foamy beige head fade quickly leaving a spotty lacing ring. Smells of molasses, coffee, dark fruits, chocolate, and nuts. Tastes of citrus zest, cocoa powder, and nuts up front, then some caramel and molasses, dark fruits like plums and raisin, and then a slightly bitter and salty finish of coffee and soy sauce. Medium in body with low carbonation. A little watery in places, but also quite thick in others. In all, pretty easy to drink. Thanks go to Kegatron for the bottle."
"D: divinely good"
"This beer is very, very good."
"I have to admit from the outset that Baltic Porter is one of my favorite styles and have some very specific notions about what this style can and should behave. Pours a dark brown with a small brown head that does not retain well, unlike several others of its class. Smells roasty and (like the back of the bottle says) a bit like black licorice, but is remarkably understated to the point of being uninteresting. The taste, however, will knock your socks off. Full-bodied, well-rounded, extremely complex and layered flavors that make you marvel at every sip. This is extremely tasty. Black licorice? Check. Dark chocolate? Check. Roastiness? Smoke? Expresso? Check, Check, Check! This beer spans the entire Baltic Porter flavor spectrum and does so in a very balanced way. This a suberb beer once you get it to your palate."
"3.0 D: Not anything special at all, but no huge problems either."
"so the age old debate. do I review this as a baltic porter per the bottle label? Or do I review this as an american porter per the BA site? Or, do I go with a BJCP style category? Yeah, I was kidding with that last one. I'm going to go with the BA category of american porter. this drank nice, hada good porter / coffe aspect to it, but fell short in the cleanliness and maltiness of a baltic porter as I've had them. I'd happily drink another, I just wouldn't worry about style classification."
"Drinkability is high for me-- this is a beer with a good strong flavor, but not so powerful that you can't enjoy several. Look out for the 7% abv, though."
"I took a recent trip out to Virginia and drank gallons of Dominions Oak Barrel Stout. I'm glad to have the chance to try another of their offerings and thoroughly enjoy this brew. The label may be a little misleading but what's in the bottle is quality. Thanks again David!"
"Clear and dark brown with a purplish red hue. Fine tan cap, sort of thin off the pour with a bit of a collar. Some lacing. Roasty aroma, dry cocoa, nutty, dried fruit, faint smoke. Mild bitterness with faint hop flavour. Mostly malt though, some roast and chocolate, caramel and malted milk, cola sweetness. Slight alcohol, medium bodied, lowish carbonation, a bit on the sticky side. Not bad, but labeling it a baltic porter seems a bit misleading. Not a bad American porter though."
"Hand-delivered from Ashburn to Vienna (thanks, Chris and Jeff!), my 33cl bottle looks just like the one in the picture. Couldn't find any freshness info. Pours a clear dark cola brown under a deep tan head that barely rises above film and settles quite quickly without managing to generate any lace. The nose is strong of coffee and nuts, with a hint of licorice. The mouth is slightly cloying and well carbonated, leaving a bit of a prickly sensation on the tongue. The taste is definitely porter, with a good taste of nuts and a bit of dark chocolate. There is also a fruity sweetness such as from dark plums or red grapes. The hops are subdued, but never absent, generating an espresso bitter at the slow and a bit of a dry ache in the aftertaste. The sweetness never goes away, though. In fact, this is a bit too sweet for too long for my taste. Still, a solid brew, and probably the last sample I'll get of Dominion brewed in Virginia. Sigh!"
"Drinkability - Not too bad for a porter. Even though it has a rather heavy body, I could drink more than one of these. Another good one from Old Dominion, even though I've only tried a few of their beers, they have all been pretty good. Would love to try this one on tap."
"D - Very drinkable, and right along the lines of what you should expect from a winter brew. however, I would almost definately like more hops in the finish. that might remind me a little more that im drinking a beer. its true that you would never know this was a 7% abv by the taste."
"Poured a deeper mahoaony color with an averaged sized tan head. Aromas of roast, piney - rye, chocolate, and some nuttiness. Tastes of chocolate, roast, lightly earthy, caramel, and some rye. Alcohol content well hidden. Light lacing left on the glass."
"Both the aroma and taste seem to lack stand-out characteristics, but this is a solid beer."
"Direct from the brewery. This beer was delicious! Very dark color with ruby hues around the edge when held up to the light. Smell was of grain, dark malt, licorice and toffee. Goes down smooth on a cold night. Very easy drinking for 7.2% abv. Taste was rich in grain, malt, and spiciness. Mouthfeel was full, rich, and smooth. I could drink a couple of these. Nice job."
"As far as whether it's an American or a Baltic, I'm leaning towards Baltic on this one."
"D: could drink this endlessly, very good"
"So if I get this right, OD is hanging it up. Too bad as I find this to be solid beer, even if it's a bit of a ""also-ran""."
"Had this at the Brewhouse in the DC Convention Center. Far superior to the Aviator amber lager (which I switched to), and a solid brew, in my opinion. Appearance is a near black with a nice big fluffy tan head and solid lacing. Nose is mild, but some roasted malt and swirling fruit. Flavor's nicer, but still doesn't have as much oomph as it could. Roasted malt, some fruit. A hint of hops, but not particularly ""there."" A little dirtier than most porters, almost stoutish. Feel was solid, appropriate for the style but not really creamy enough to be interesting. Overall, a good beer, and one I'd have again."
"Overall- Bland. Worth trying but otherwise lackluster."
"Though they call this a Baltic Porter, I agree with the BA designation of American Porter. This doesn't seem to pack the alcoholic punch associated with most Baltics I've had. That said, I'm happy with it. It's nothing too extreme, but flavorful, balanced and drinkable. My first from Old Dominion and I was generally impressed."
"D: This one is pretty tasty tonight, with a cold, soaking rain outside. A nice winter offering and good to see the folks at Dominion expanding their rather small line of beers for the holidays at least. It's nothing outstanding, but it's a great buy for $6.99 a sixer."
"M + D: A little syrupy... the whole experience was kind of reminiscent of a soda that's been sitting a few hours. Mild carbonation, a little flat feeling, kinda syrupy, and sweet. It's not a bad brew, though it's not really what I would expect of the style."
"I suppose this is the latest from Old Dominion as I haven't seen it yet and I only live an hour from the brewery. It is a very nice full porter for the winter time with all the classic flavors. Lots of dark malts, roasted flavors, and a nice hint of rye in the background. Quite high in alcohol but none of the taste, they did a very good job of masking the alcohol flavor. Pours a nice deep dark red/brown with a strong head and great winter-warmer aroma. Not a bad beer if you can find it and hard to beat the price."
