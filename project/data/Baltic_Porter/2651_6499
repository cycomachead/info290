What I liked was the smoothness and sweetness. Im not a big fan of heavy coffee overtones and this is really lacking in coffee, but for me that is a plus. Its more like milk chocolate than dark chocaolate. I like this beer, its lighter and ok for summer. Its goes down easy for me and I like a change. Sweet instead of bitter ok.

Initially all I could smell was vinegar. I did let this sit a while, and later I was able to smell some chocolate and roasted malt. But even after waiting 5 minutes the vinegar smell was still overpowering everything else. Unfortunately the taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly vinegar, some sour taste I can't identify, and a little bit of chocolate and coffee in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is thin and watery, not pleasing at all. Drinkability is bad too, especially because I don't like drinking vinegar. I hope this is a bad bottle, but I don't plan on trying this again anytime soon. I had to drain pour this, I could only stand a few drinks of this before I couldn't take it any more.

Smells of over-ripe (on the verge of rancid) fruitiness. Tastes similar to this with a touch of vinegary ugliness to it. UGH... making my way to the sink to dispose of it.

I have had beers that didnt call themselves chocolate beers, with more chocolate flavor. This beer is carbonated about right. It leaves a malty aftertaste on the palate. It is medium bodied and not too aggressive. This beer would probably make a great session beer. It is low in alcohol, and the taste is not too strong.

The nose reveals some acetic notes and a touch of cocoa, but little more. In the mouth it's thinner than might be expected (medium bodied); but with a fine, slightly restrained carbonation that gently tingles the palate. The flavor, disappointingly, is as the nose suggests. It's acidic up-front over a minor amount of dark malt - although there's not much malt there at all - and the chocolate character only appears for a brief moment at the swallow. Unimpressive to say the least.","NeroFiddled","Jul 08, 2004"
1.66,-41.1,3,2,1,2,2,"This is one of the worst porters I've ever had the displeasure of drinking. It poured a decent dark brown color with a small off white head that faded quicky and left little to no lace. The smell was allmost non-existant but for a very slight coffee scent. The taste is downright bad with a very weak flavor of coffee in your mouth and one of the most nasty sour finishes I've had in a long time. Definantly save your dough and get any porter out there other than this.","Dmann","Apr 23, 2004"
1.44,-48.9,3,1.5,1,3,1,"Wow, what a disappointment. Actually, a near-total dud. This sad attempt at a style I usually like ended up cleaning the pipes in my kitchen sink. Don't get sucked into spending $2.50 for this brew when there are so many better beers out there.","Boilermaker88","Oct 19, 2003"
1.55,-45,1.5,1.5,1.5,2,1.5,"Dark black color. Medium bodied. Aroma is chocolate with a touch of roasted malts. A light bodied porter. Malts are roasted and choclately. But it a VERY lactic tasting porter. Taste is thin and watery. Not much flavor. Possibly infected? Not very good either way, Drain pour. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is sour.","beerguy101","Oct 06, 2003"
3.18,12.8,4,3.5,3,3,3,"This porter poured a very dark brown with a light tan head with little foam and some retention while drinking. The smell was of roasted malts and some chocolate. The taste of roasted malts and chocolate was average. The only set back was not the bitterness, but it had a sour flavor that some how took away what pleasant flavor it had. Well balanced, but the sour taste was it's down fall!","BeerManDan","Apr 24, 2003"
2.74,-2.8,4.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Very dark brown in color, with a huge light tan head which settles quickly but leaves a good lace down the glass. Aroma is roasty with mild chocolatey notes -- quite sweet and pleasant. The first sip was a shocker. The taste starts off extremely sour, rather like an Old Brown Ale. Malty sweetness kicks in mid palate, maybe a weak milk-chocolate like flavor, and finishes with a pleasant roastiness. All this, however, seems rather insufficient to balance the sour start. A bit thin bodied. I'm not sure what I would think of this on its intrinsic merits, but the taste definitely seems wrong for a chocolate porter, and definitely does not live up to the description posted on the website -- ""chocolate and coffee."" I emailed the brewmaster who confirmed the presence of the sour taste was not due to a bad batch, but seemed to think it wasn't a bad thing either. To each his own, I guess!","mzwolinski","Apr 03, 2003"
