The aroma is chocolate syrup, caramel, molasses, brown sugar and roasted malts. Hints of licorice and tobacco. The taste is roasted malts and chocolate syrup with some leather and tobacco. Boozey. Some woody notes as it warms. Finishes with more tobacco, roasted malts and chocolate syrup. Hint of coffee. Slick, velvety mouthfeel. Really digging this one.

Said head endures a respectable time, and lacing remains as time passes and drinking proceeds. The aroma, which is not pronounced, is of freshly-baked brownies. The beer's flavor is also that of a rich, semi-sweet chocolate pastry, accompanied by a very slight alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is just right for a robust porter.","Altrurian","Apr 28, 2014"

4.17,0.2,4.75,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours practically like motor oil, thick and black with just a hint of coffee “browness” reflecting back at the eyes. It forms a beautiful, dark tan head of creamy, small bubbles that settle around a finger’s width above the glass. In body, the beer’s clarity is hard to discern, seeing as how it is totally opaque. The beer seems thick and viscous, but clear of any particles or cloudiness, but that is just going off of what I saw pour into my glass. On the nose, the beer smells magnificent. Dark roasted coffee with a thick nuance of dark fruits like brown sugar and raisins, plums, and just a touch of sweet cherries. Soft char, and a nuttiness also make their way into the nose, along with spicy licorice. Touches of caramel and toffee do blend in with the coffee as the beer swirls around the glass. On the tongue, the beer tastes initially sweet, but then dries out beautifully into gentle coffee bitters with touches of dark fruitiness, and even a light sense of spice. Acidity is light to nonexistent on the palate. Alcohol is just an afterthought at the end of the sip, providing a light heat and spice to the finish, which is very impressive given the beer’s 10% ABV. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet bread, but swiftly unfurls into light char, rich coffee, dark and bitter chocolate, and touches of molasses. Burnt raisins and brown sugar come to mind as the sip hits the mid-palate, along with a nice nuttiness that I also found in Jack’s Evil Brew, and even a touch of toffee on the finish. In the third quarter of the sip is a burst of spice blending a touch of cinnamon with licorice for a nice burst of flavor. The finish is strong but muddled. The flavoring is peculiarly light with coffee, and brings more spice, light alcoholic heat, and even a touch of cherry into play on the palate. There is even a bit of meaty flavoring on the end of the finish, almost like a Christmas Ham… The aftertaste is more expected with roasted malt, coffee, and char lingering on the tongue. I love this beer until the finish, and though it is not awful, the muddling has me confused. In the mouth, the beer feels full bodied and smooth. Velvety carbonation of an above average rate helps to coat the tongue in softness as the beer displays its chewy, yet smooth quality. The mouth is left wet all over with a lingering roast-bitter tingle and a slight warmth in the gullet. Overall, this is a great thick beer that is perfect for sipping in front of a fire. I wasn’t quite as fond of it as I was of its barrel-aged variant, mostly because of the oddness of the finish. The flavors are not awful by any stretch, but merely peculiar and out of place with what I was expecting. This is a good beer that gets even better after sitting down in a barrel.","Maxwell","Dec 29, 2013"

Would like to see this in sixpacks like Hoponius Union but that probably won't happen. I do appreciate the unique approach of European size bottles, but at nearly $5 a take-home pint this is not likely to be on many drinkers' list of regulars. Nonetheless, this could definitely spoil me for any other Baltic Porter.","scotorum","Beers"

Maybe this is a bad batch, or my taste buds are off. Malts are nice but a bit syrupy, nice crisp lager coming through, decent hops to balance, but a couple slight flaws I think.","jlindros","Mar 31, 2013"

4.03,-3.1,4,4,4,4.25,4,"Served in a tulip nonic. Pours a dark brown, almost black, with ruby highlights around the base when backlit. Head is a 1/2 in thickness, dense, creamy and tan-colored and embedded with tiny pinpricks. Head eventually dissipates into a soapy slick with some swaths of lacing present during the tasting. Nose expresses roasted malts, lager yeast and dark, slightly vinous fruits and cocoa. Taste follows nose; however, the fruit profile is not overly assertive and melds with the roasted malts and cocoa. There is also an earthy hops bittering and a bit of ethanol (more flavor than heat) at the back that leaves a slightly acrid aftertaste between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with an even carbonation and some mild acidity attributable to the alcohol. Overall, a solid baltic porter with both complexity and balance. That said, I continue to be impressed by this young brewery's innovation and quality.","Jwale73","Mar 06, 2013"

It causes the sides of the back of my tongue to twinge a little, but the way a good hot sauce causes your mouth to burn just a little - you notice it but it does not dissuade your next sip.","nmarsceill","Feb 26, 2013"

4.18,0.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"At first it almost reminds me of a less smoky version of their other dark beer, the smoke and dagger. But after a few sips the ABV really starts to sneak up on you. This is such a well-balanced Baltic Porter. It’s not in your face with malt, or hops. According to the brewery, much like all other JA’s beers, the beer is actually a lager and not an ale like most Porters. That definitely accounts for the very smooth and easy drinking of this beer. Almost reminds me, at least in the sipping sort of way, an English Barleywine vs American Barleywine in that it’s not over the top in any area, but just right in a good malty sort of way. Just another stellar beer from Jack’s Abby.","taez555","0"
