"Great beer!  Aroma was pleasant, flavor and taste enhanced by leaving it out for a while. A solid offering."

"O: Thomas Hooker's Imperial Porter is a pretty good beer that has a bit too much intense sweetness in the early and mid-palate and overly pronounced sourness in the finish. it is complex however and worth a try as it may hit some people's palate right in the sweet spot."

"O – This is a really nice porter. It is not very complex but it is very true-to-style and very tasty. I love the thicker mouthfeel that almost borders on stout territory, and it is insanely drinkable for 8% ABV. If I hadn’t known, I would’ve guessed it was around 5-6%. I’m really glad that I got to try this one. I’m glad I have another offering from Thomas Hooker (Liberator) in my fridge. I’ll have to check out more from them when I’m back up in New England. Thanks, Jared!"

"I recommend picking this one up. I think it is a very good example for a porter."

"Overall a nice step up from the lager dopplebock. I would buy this again!"

"Overall: Solid porter. Minus the lack of head and carbonation, this beer is still good."
"-Overall 4.0: Very good ""Imperial"" porter. It does have a few drawbacks, namely the fact that it is basically a ""dubbel"" porter and the taste certainly reflects this: a porter on steroids. Also, the alcohol content tends to sneak up on you and kick you in the shorts. Still, the brew certainly exceeded my expectations, and I would unreservedly recommend this beer."

"Poured from undated bottle to mug the beer arrives a dark opaque brown with deep brown edges in the light, a nice 2 finger off-white/light mocha color head with good retention and lacing. The nose is a bled of roasted barley and caramel sweetness, hints of dark fruit, and perhaps a heat from the alcohol. The beer starts very much the same way with a smooth creamy malt roast after which the dark fruit and caramel warm the beer up a bit, finishes with a lingering roast. Mild bitterness and hides the alcohol well. Medium bodied and creamy, this is a good beer. Overall, a treat, very enjoyable."
"O: The alcohol is well hidden from the taste, but overall this beer doesn’t seem to fit the style with all of the fruity taste. It becomes a bit more drinkable as the beer warms up."
"O: The alcohol presence is well hidden in this beer but I am not a huge fan of the cola aroma and vinous notes. The beer is not overly enjoyable to me with a little too much balsamic vinegar."

"Overall: Really impressive for a 9 year old Imperial Porter. Very enjoyable."

"Found at Backstage in Torrington, CT this one's a pitch black color with a decent light chocolate colored head and good lacing. The nose picks up a smokey, chocolate, firm and enticing. The flavor nicely mirrors the aroma with more of the charcoal theme. No interesting nuances really just solid, standard stuff. This is a medium-plus bodied porter with a slightly resinous, velvetty feel. Very pleasant stuff with solid, though pretty typical, porter flavor. Wish it was something a little more unique, but most improtantly, it’s a very good porter. It never quite struck me as an imperial version with little suggestion of alcohol or magnified flavors, but no complaints here."

"The taste is like the first wet kiss on the end of a hot fist. I lie, it's a pleasant homeostasis of warming wet hops love and alcoholically dry sweet malts. I need a new thesaurus for the word subtle. Whereas the world flops in clown shoes towards Imperial Porters, there's a real growing appreciation from this roller skate for the complex and delicious porter. Bravo."
""
"Boy does this one jump up at ya. Smells and looks absolutely fantastic. Very dark, wicked roasty chocolate smell. Nice head with great lace. Thick and creamy roasted coffee with a bit of chocolate and molasses. Ends with a warm alcohol taste, then throws more roasted coffee at ya. Very good beer."
""
"overall: unique take on the style, very good beer. my introduction to thomas hooker."
"overall: Very nice. I'd love to try the oak aged version."
""
"Overall Impression: Overall, I thought this was a decent Imperial Porter, but it just didn’t quite hit for me. There was something a little lacking, maybe a little thin, about it in both flavor and body, that kept the score from being higher."
""
""
""
"Overall: a strong Imperial Porter with an aroma that is better than the flavor."
"Overall: I'm not sure what to think of this beer. The aroma is great, the taste is just odd and makes me go back and forth. In the end while its not exactly what I'm looking forward to in a porter, its still a nice flavor."
""

"Unremarkable. Pretty good, but nothing to set it apart from hundreds of other porters."
"Little too bitter on the finish. Very roasty and chocolatey. Something is missing in the balance."
"Overall: It's been a long time, Hooker. I recall seeing them far more often at the marketplace around 2006, then, I recall a few infected large-sized swing-top bottles (got one myself), and, after that, they seemed to all but vanish from the stores in GA. Now, I'm seeing them a bit more, now with their entire line-up in twelve ounce capped bottles it seems. I'd revisited their doppelbock late last year, enjoyed it, and now it's time to revisit the imperial porter. It's good, thankfully not infected, but seems more bitter than I recall."
"Even with the strong amount of alcohol in this, I could hardly feel it as I enjoyed this beer. It's hard to dislike this offering since it's so silky and easygoing, and any fan of dark or dessert beers will find it well worth it to seek this beer out. It's a great example of how enjoyable a Porter can be."
"O/D: At 7.8% ABV, it doesn't scream boozy, but has a bunch of great flavors jumping around. It's a straight forward beer, but it's good at what it does. A solid Hooker brew."
"O - Ehhh. I do like Hooker, but this was a bit of a let down. Perhaps its better fresh, but the driving bitter roastiness was a bit tiring. I guess its in between a porter and a stout. The flavors seem to be a bit intense and big, while the body is thinner."
"O: Not my favorite porter, but definitely one of the more memorable ones. Good stuff..."
"Drinkability - an excellent porter, next time I see this I'll grab several. Excellent beer tasting choice."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer. If you like porters and have a sweet tooth, then this beer will be right up your alley. Reminds me a little bit of a Southern Tier offering. Lots of sweet chocolate, probably too much sweetness for me."
"Overall it's a good beer. One I would pick up in a pinch."
"Medium bodied with a good amount of soft carbonation. Easy to drink and very flavorful. The dark roast is definitely improved as the beer warms in your mouth."
"Surprisingly very drinkable for an imperial beer. Goes down quick and easy, and on the sweet/cocoa side of things. Well done T. Hooker."
"On a side note, I found this brew had some traits that I found familiar. I cracked into the cellar and on a lark opened a Jubel 2010, I found a similar yet more subdued (weaker, less imperial) flavor in the Jubel. Just FYI."
"Aroma is smoky and oily with undertones of quality coffee and molasses and a hint of hops. It pours a barely transparent cola brown with a thick, fine-bubbled tan head. Smoky flavor has tones of molasses and coffee and a hoppy, bitter undertone. Texture is thick, smooth and fizzy, leaving a fairly persistent smoky and slightly hoppy tingle."
"This is a good porter but I don't know"
"3.5 D: Again, a good beer, but the weird flavor meshing reduces my desire for another one."
"D - I had previously only had the oak-aged version of this brew (way better), but I was unaware that it was actually a different brew than this, as it does not indicate that it is oak-aged on the bottle."
"Nice to try, but there are other old stand byes I'd go to."
"There is much going on here, and it is pretty well balanced. Some rich flavors blend nicely. I'm impressed, and look forward to trying this one and others from Thomas Hooker in the future."
"D: The malty, roasted, bittersweet chocolate character of a strong porter fused with alcohol and distinctly American hopping. At nearly 8% ABV, this is certainly a heavy-handed porter, but one to be enjoyed on its own or perhaps with a slice of dark chocolate cake or torte."
"Drinkability -- This beer slowly grew on me. Falls somewhere between a traditional porter, an English Barleywine, and an Old Ale. Lots going on, and an incredibly easy beer to drink even with its heft and richness. Good stuff."
"D- I'm glad Phil included two of these."
"This is medium in the feel with a light level of carbonation. Quite drinkable with a pleasant roastiness. Relatively speaking the alcohol is well hidden in the taste from what the aroma led on. Not bad."
"D - this is a very good imperial porter. I would love to have this again and would put it toward the top of the ones I have tried."
"D: Pretty good; a little boozey."
"Pours near black with a light tan head and a tiny bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings some roast as well as sweetness with some dark malt, chocolate, coffee, and molasses coming through. The taste isn't super well integrated and looses some nuances from the nose. Mild cherry flavor and good chocolate and coffee. Medium body with a bit of alcohol. Drinks fairly well, but nowhere near the Doppelbock."
"A great beer to sit and sip for a while, just be wary of the deceptive alcohol content."
"Drinkability is a little lower. It doesn't drink hot for almost 8%, in fact drinks pretty well in that aspect. However, the sticky mouth feel that coats the mouth, combined with that minerality salty like flavor that starts to bombard after a while. If it wasn't for that minerality flavor this beer would probably break into the A rating range."
"12oz bottle. Pours a black as night color with a small head that doesn't stick around for very long. Good lacing. Nice aroma of coffee, malt, and caramel. Taste is heavy. Flavor of the coffee and malt again. Sweet caramel finish. I'll be taking my time to enjoy this beer."
"This has Baltic Porter written all over it both on the nose and the tongue. Very good example of the style."
"Plenty of chocolately malt flavor. Good introduction of hop in the swallow. The aftertaste is short and features the darker malts, not hops. Very thin for the style."
"Full-bodied with light effervescence. Warming with a dryish finish. Please, may I have more? Though at $9.50 a bottle..."
"Poured into a pint glass, formed a 1"" brown head on top of an almost opaque dark brown brew, with slightly translucent edges. Lacing is prevalent, but quick-falling. Aroma is tons of dark grains, with both coffee and chocolate apparent. Taste is dominated by the dark malt sweetness upfront, but gives way to some pervasive hoppiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and easy, and drinkability is very nice as well. As nice as I remembered."
"Nuthin' better than some ""Dog Whisperer"" and a snifter of imperial porter. Good times. This one pours a straightly opaque black-brown topped by nearly a finger of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, spruce tips, pine, rich toffee, cocoa, blackened biscuits, rye bread, and a hint of cashews. The taste is pretty darkly roasted and charred: malts, biscuits, caramel, coffee. Feel the darkness, apparently. All of this roast and char leaves a slightly stinging bitterness that even leans toward the sour end of the spectrum. Some light pine and citrus notes get lost in the mob as well. The body is a strong medium, with a light carbonation and a dry feel. Overall, I think this guy overdoes it with the roast a bit, but beyond that everything seems pretty dern solid."
"Drinkability: I knew it, I knew it, I knew it. ""Why not get a 4-pack?"" I asked myself. And of course, I decided for just the one bottle. It's not the end of the world, I know, but this is a brew that almost begs to not be a sipper -- however, it seems like it very well could be, which it shouldn't. And there's the rub. I haven't seen it at too many places, so if I encounter it again, you know I'll be buying more. Delicious and a perfect selection for the upcoming cold weather and rain that's upon us."
"D: Excellent. Not exactly what I'd call a warm weather thirst quencher, but this sure does stick to the ribs."
"Bought a 4 pack of this for $8.99... and man oh man is this a fantastic beer. Pours a nice dark brown with a nice white head to it. Aroma is very roasty, nutty, and a faint hops. Taste is medium to full bodied, TONS of taste to this one. Get some great roastiness, some good caramel notes, possibly even some coffee and chocolate too, along with a balance of good hops. A little bit of an alcohol kick but it all goes together so well.. just a great beer at the end of an evening. Way too drinkable and damn delicious... recommend this one for sure."
"D: Not sure whether this should have come from a pint or a snifter...a hefty taste/feel and an fairly weighty alcoholic girth lead me to think this worthy of the latter. A well-done brew by the folks at Thomas Hooker, really worthy of seeking..."
"d - A very nice porter. I thought it tasted great and was very well balanced. Would definitely try again."
"d- delicious stuff that was priced nicely at around $10/4pk. I will most certainly be pulling the other bottles out of the cellar for more immediate consumption. these puppies are tasty as hell fresh and I can't see them getting much better with age."
"Not sure what was wrong with this to me as I usually love porters, this one just did not do it for me. Poured a dark brown with a thin little head. Smelled of sweet raosted caramel malt and some hop bitterness. taste was of roasted malt, dark fruit, and dry bread, more bitter than I like from a porter but can see how it's balanced nicely. Quite heavy on the palette but nice carbonation. I will give this another chance as maybe my pallette was off, just not my thing that day."
"Drinkability is quite good; I really enjoyed Imperial Porter. One (maybe two) at a time would likely suffice as it's fairly hefty. I wouldn't at all mind getting to try this one again. Recommend."
"The Imp Porter pours a deep mahogany color with a very thin tan head that quickly fades after an aggressive pour. Smell is dominated with malt characteristics. Some chocolate and coffee are present as well as raisins. Taste is fairly light with a nice lingering burnt coffee taste. Plenty of malts are also present on the palate with a fruit sweetness. A good tasting american porter. Mouthfeel is fairly thin but well carbonated. This is one drinkable porter. ABV is well hidden and taste is really good."
"SkÅL!"
"12 ounce bottle, courtesy travduke, poured into a pint glass. Pours a deep dark brown, clear under bright light, with a big fluffy cocoa-colored head. Dark chocolate aroma with some light roastiness, dark fruits, and a touch of alcohol. Big dark chocolate and coffee flavor that melds into a caramel note through the finish. Substantial acidity, maybe a little too much. There's something about this that lets you know that it's a lager, although I'm not sure I can put my finger on it. Nice bitter finish, otherwise pretty clean. I dig it."
"Drinkability is also good. By no means a chore or a choke down. Just not my fave porter but a unique take I'm glad to have sampled. Cheers for the interesting extra!"
"Medium bodied with a very low level of carbonation, the roasted burnt quality lingers through the finish.... I wouldn't see having a couple of these back to back but it was interesting to try. At least they aren't producing the infection-prone swingtops anymore."
"very good brew. glad to try it in the new 4-pack version after being scared away from the flip-tops for so long. will probably visit again, though it won't be a regular."
"Based on some of the other more recent reviews and my own experience, as compared to the overall rating and some of the older reviews, I wonder what has happened to this beer. Clearly it was a great beer once, but the one in my glass is not. The burned flavor just kills it, masking the other flavors and giving it an unpleasant, bitter astringency. Maybe they should bring back the swingtops afterall..."
"D - Not bad, there is a lot of dark sugar character, but for some reason it never seems to really come together. There is an odd spiciness that I pick up in the aroma and that really jumps out in the aftertaste. The cola sweetness sticks around too long and makes the beer seem cloying rather than complex. Drinkable, but not something I would drink more than once."
"Don't get me wrong, I love imperial anything, but the wave of booze in the beginning takes away from the rest of the beer. The second half of this beer has wonderful flavor and it would probably mix nicely with an ipa for an interesting black and tan. I would not recommend spending $10 on a 4 pack of these guys to anyone as it is just not complex enough. Overpriced for being ordinary..."
"D-i could maybe have a few of these but its well balance taste it thrown off by the huge alcohol taste to it"
"Mouth/Drink: Mouth is thick and smooth. Drinkability is low because this beer is filling and the somewhat high alcohol kicks in quick."
"Drinkability- Well since I never had this beer fresh, I don't have anything to compare it to. Either this beer is past its prime after 4 years, or I just don't like it much. The nose if fantastic, but the taste is extremely disappointing. It's too sweet and it's still slightly warming. Oh well, interesting none-the-less. Thanks whoever you are!"
"Drinkability: A nice high alcohol creamy sweet brown ale. I do want several and am glad I picked up a four pack. Very complex for the style."
"D - simply incredible. 4.5"
"Overall a very drinkable porter. Lots of flavor and complexity. I'm glad I have another bottle to enjoy. Thanks Andrew."
"good beer, little different from most porters i've had but good. i'd get it again."
"Mouthfeel is on the thicker side and slightly creamy. Drinkability is good, I really liked this porter. It had a lot of very big and bold flavors that worked together very well. Very good porter in my opinion that I would gladly drink again."
"[EDIT: 3/13/2011 - Reviewing a fresh non-barrel-aged bottle (12oz capped, no longer the swing-top), the oxidation has disappeared making this more drinkable, but I find the ABV to be more forward and the roast levels a bit higher than I remember; better retention and lacing with this fresh bottle; and more cocoa in the nose]"
"D-The prominence of the smoky, charred malt makes this beer a one and done. Its not a bad beer, but one is all I would want and that one is definitely a sipper."
"Thickly bodied and very filling. Could really substitue it for dessert!! Exellent brew."
"On tap at Sunset Grille in Allston. Served in a 13 oz tulip glass. Dirty brown color. Thin tan colored head. Cloudy body. Light smell of cocoa powder. Taste was good but not memorable. Dark chocolate, roasted barley and a hint of anise noted. Did not like the mouthfeel though. Felt a bit rough for a porter and had a chalky characteristic to it. Would have liked a smoother body. ABV was moderate but not too high. A nice porter for a decent price, but I would not pay premium prices for this."
"Overall I don't know what to think about this brewery. Their doppelbock was phenomenal, however both the barleywine and this beer had way too much fruit flavor, though it was evident there was a tasty beer underneath all the riffraff. Maybe they don't age well? I'll be on the lookout for fresh versions to compare."
"As someone who drinks their coffee black, I found this beer to be right in my sweet spot. Props to augustgarage for pointing me in the right direction."
"500ml swing-top bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured one shade shy of black with a thin, khaki-colored head that quickly dissipated into a thick cluster of bubble and then a soapy slick; no lacing on this one. Nose reveals chocolate malt, a hint of coffee and a suggestion of dark fruit. Taste consistent with nose, but there's a little bit of a peppery quality at the finish. Mouthfeel is just shy of medium-bodied, with virtually no carbonation. Easy drinking and fairly flavorful, but I wonder if I got an old bottle."
"A really nice beer, very big roastiness, extremely intense. There is just barely enough sweetness to compliment the intense roast. Try it if you love strong dark coffee."
"M/D - Medium bodied and surprsingly still given the rather large head that formed. Drinkability is there, but the tastes are rather big which brings the drinkability down a touch in my book. Alcohol provides a nice warming."
"I've always had mixed results with aging fliptops and I think this is another example. I enjoyed it, but I really think the mouthfeel and taste would have been much better fresh."
"D - A sipper."
"Drinkability is good , it is more drinkable than say Smuttynose Robust Porter, but very similar in style only more caramel flavors for a higher price tag. Id drink it again - maybe they could tone down their bottles and make it a little cheaper"
"D- This is definitely not a session beer, but a very tasty sipper indeed. Overall, this is a fantastic beer that is highly recommended!"
"Overall, if you like the roasty drier porters, or are just in the mood for one, pick this one up. If the carbo was right this could be a fine porter for sure. It even still is. I feel bad giving it a low score, but as it sits, gotta do it. Would love to try this with the minor fix. A good beer."
"D: Nope, thanks, I'll pass and drink a real porter instead."
"6/3/6/3/12/3.0"
"Pours dark brown with a foamy beige head. Malty aroma of roasted coffee, chocolate and caramel. Flavor similar to aroma once again dominated by roasted coffee maltiness, chocolate, caramel and toffee."
"This black-as-night porter poured nicely into an oversized mug, leaving a 1-fingered creamy tan head whcih dissipated from the brew nice a slowly. It had a light aroma, but that may be due to the fact that I chilled the beer. Aromas did appear the longer I let it sit in the glass. The flavor seemd a bit complex, again it could be because the beer was chilled. The flavor started out sweet and then turned slightly sour, then leaving behind a bitter aftertaste. The flavors did seem to blend much better the longer it sat in the glass. There was no sharp changes in flavor, it blended much better and was more consistent. The mouthfeel is full-bodied. The flavors just coat the palate and linger long after the beer is gone. Like other big strong beers, you can't drink this all a fternoon, but one beer can sit in the glass for quite some time, allowing you to enjoy each sip."
"A very rich flavor profile that should be savored. However, it's tough to put the glass down, and easy drinker."
"The taste has a good chocolate and caramel sweetness with some light coffee and some chocolate bitterness but...there's that tartness I noted in the smell. Something is amiss here, me thinks....I can't finish the bottle. :^("
"Drinkability: Argh. This one was tough to finish. All the elements of the good beer were there, but the funky, tart, salty, metallic notes - while not being offensive, really - definitely seeming out of place in an Imperial Porter. I suppose I can stretch my imagination to imagine that the fruity notes and tart notes are the finish of bitter roasted coffee notes, astringencies, etc. And the alcohol isn't bad. But still, it seems like this Thomas Hooker - whose swing tops I loved, but which is notorious for infected bottles - might just be infected. I'll give it another chance next time I see it, has promise."
"Drinkability: It was pretty much a standard roasted Porter in an expensive bottle. 2 years worth of age didn't really do anything for this beer. That lead me to believe that I should have probably drank this Porter fresh. Is it worth a shot? Yeah, go ahead and give this beer a shot."
"For a porter this is exceptionally drinkable, a great brew."
"I enjoyed this one with my friends, Pleepleus and Hyland - I think it's better that way."
"Enjoyed this one with the Mox and the Monkey. Poured from a cool lookin swing top growler looking bomber. Poured pitch black like old motor oil with a minimal tan head leaving spotty lacing throughout. Coffee smells with hints of raisin. Bitter coffee tastes with hints of dark fruits, raisin and plum. Definite malty character came through in the finish. Slightly thick oily mouthfeel leaving an overly bitter aftertaste. Overall a little too bitter for my liking but worth trying if your a stout or porter fan."
"Poured into a pint glass from bottle that was ""Bottled in 2006"". Black with brown hues and a tan bubbly quarter inch head. Chocolate sweet smell, and thats where the good part ended sadly. Strong coffe and caramel with heavy alcohol. The heavy coffee bitterness lingers too long. This seems more like a stout than a porter. I am not a fan."
"500 mL bottle with a flip top. The sticker across the top says that it was bottled in 2006. The pour reveals a black beer with brown highlights around the edges. A big cap of tan colored foam sat on top, with OK retention and moderate lacing. The aroma is not strong, but bitter chocolate and earthy hops are identifiable. On the palate it is creamy and nice. The taste is roasted malt--more coffee than chocolate with a bitterness that soars at the end. This beer is an good imperial porter."
"This could be a case of being disappointed that a beer isn't what you expected, but I just sampled the absolutely Duck-Rabbit Porter a few weeks ago. This was a disappointment on many levels."
"I have never had this one fresh, but aged it is truly a gem, despite its meager appearance."
"Notes: The slight sourness is actually somewhat enjoyable, though it's clearly not what the beer was intended to taste like."
"A massive four finger head is quick to build. Fat rocky dark tan bubbles krackle and leave scattered lace as the head fades. Body is as black as stout yielding not light. Nose is smokey and robust with meaty malt notes and dusting of spicey zest. Enters the mouth with a dark rich bitter. Dryness is much like dark chocolate or coco powder. Tones of coffee are of course noticeable. hints of soured dark fruits almost reflect a tannin like feel. As it warms it does show a bit of sweetness. On the back of the tongue you get a browny like rechness that leads into a rich, thick lovely mouthfeel. This is as dark as a porter gets, and I'm thankful for that. A real joy to drink and a true brewing success."
"Taste is of roasted malt, the caramel slowly comes into the picture and lingers long after, some interesting bitterness in the aftertaste, not intensely coffee-ish but some contribute a little."
"Drinks very easy for the style & heft, not great, but close to it"
"Wowza."
" I did not expect this to be as good as it was but what a pleasant surprise. A truly great brew from Hooker. This review is from notes taken three days ago. I've since bought more of these to stash in the cellar."
"D: One was quite enough for me. I think that in the process of making this an ""imperial"" they lost the porter characteristics."
"Poured out of a bottle at the Flying Pig in Malvern, PA into a tulip glass. Poured a dark, dark brown with a good sized tan head. Smell is of sweet malts, bitterness, burnt toast. Taste was chocolate, sweet and smokey malt, with a tangy hop bitterness that was almost metallic. A fantastic imperial porter that I enjoyed trying."
"This beer was no Flying Dog Gonzo but this a great imperial porter, only had two Thomas Hookers beers now but they were both enjoyable, would drink again if possible in the future, recommended"
"Pours a dark brown, black color with a small foamy tan head. Light retention and no lacing, only an oily residue. Smells incredible with lots of caramel, some dark fruit notes, honey, chocolate, coffee, and even some alcohol presence. Taste is of caramel, chocolate, coffee, and smoke, with a citrus and alcohol finish. Medium in body with low carbonation, smooth with a dry finish. A good sipper, but definitely not something I could session."
"Overall, this is a brilliant porter! It's hard to do a porter well but TH has done it well. I really enjoy this brew!"
"Taste is very interesting. This is the hoppiest porter I have ever tasted. Wow, the flavors interact well on this beer. A super porter. Highly recommended."
"Two: cost me $8 per pint. I'll be in the poorhouse once I'm well acquainted with this wonderful porter!"
"Pours a near black in color. Smell has some subdued hops in the nose and some caramel malt. Taste is rather lacking, but the mouthfeel is absolutely wonderful. Full, creamy and velvety. Just not a whole lot going on in the flavor to warrant a good score."
"Pours a solid black, with a large fluffy head that wouldn't quit. Aroma held some surprises. Alcohol, yeast, plums, cherries, some caramel some citrusy hops. Taste of alcohol, roasted coffees and chocolate and some more dried fruits some grapefruit and pine. Thick creamy mouthfeel. Lots of carbonation. Nice brew all around. Not quite what I was expecting, but a great sipper nonetheless."
"D - I feel like a lot of the problems with with beer come from the fact that has just been aged to long. Would love to try a fresh batch sometime..."
"This beer was a bit of a disappointment overall. I expected much more in terms of aroma, flavor and mouthfeel."
"Almost completely opaque brown with a thick coffee colored head. Aroma is strongly coffee and chocolate with a nice nutty background. The chocolate stands out the most in the flavor, along with the roasted malts. The coffee is more noticable in the aftertaste, lingering for a while. Full and creamy mouthfeel. Just a slight hint of alcohol in the finish that becomes more noticable as it warms."
"Pours a really nice dark brown from the bottle with a nice thick brown head. It has a beautiful carmely, chocolatey, roasted grainy aroma that really engulfs the drinker. It tastes excellent. It has a really good complex flavor that blends the malts together with a chocolatey and caramely taste. It has a tiny hint of how alcoholic it is in the end, but it is indeed a superb beer. It has a rich and velvety mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation for a beer of this magnitude. It is a pretty drinkable beer, but due to its gravity it is not as drinkable as others."
"Rather dry in the flavor, but a delight to sip."
"This spills over into Baltic Porter territory. Sit and sip this one for awhile in order to really know how to experience it. Sweetnesses turn out to be too much for me in order for me to consider this really mind blowing. Good stuff to be sure! but for my money I'll take Anchor porter instead."
"Pretty good overall."
"Pours an opaque brown, some red edges to it, very thick tan head forms, lots of lacing settles to a thick layer, looks great. Smell is neat, lactic sourness, roast, cherries, chocolate, toffee, kind of light but nice. Taste is roasty, lots of chocolate and coffee, toffee, sour lactic cherries, cedar woodiness, very earthy, very nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, very tasty and drinkable. Thanks a ton April!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, still plenty of good carbonation here. Easy enough to drink. A tasty porter for sure. I only have one 500ml bottle of this left, and that's probably all I will ever have. I'll report back on a fresher bottle when I crack it."
"Creamy on the mouth, with a very well disguised alcoholic content, this one is amazingly easy to drink. Bittersweet chocolate, unsweetened coffee, then some mild sugary malt notes, and perhaps even some hoppy bitterness."
"EDIT: After reviewing this beer, I noted that it was my 400th review. I just wanted to mention that I think it was fitting that milestone."
"D: Quite nice. Less carbonation would make this one a winner. Worth drinking again."
"The beer is opaque ebony, with a thick frothy tan foam. The aroma is sweet and malty, reminiscent of Perkino's Hammer or Okocim. The taste is great too, but maybe a little more bitter or astringent than the afore-mentioned great Baltic Porters. Tasty and rich, best as a sipping beer."
"Drinkability: Very tasty, big and malty, big and hoppy, big and alcoholic, very well balanced and delicious."
"Pours a five+ finger light tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Totally black color. Good carbonation and heavy bodied. Roasted coffee nose. Flavor is roasted coffee/chocolate with a burnt coffee finish and lingering bakers chocolate aftertaste. Pricey at $9.25 for a 500ml flip top bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME."
"At first taste I thought ""G.D. delicious"". 500ml bottle purchased in RI. Hooker puts stoppers in their larger bottles which are very handy for resealing and saving for later. Pours a dark blackish-brown with creamy foam that stays around. Doesn't pack a strong aroma, but makes up for it with taste. Coffee, coffee, coffee is what comes through. If you're a Starbucks fan you'll love this. Other undertones of roast malt and chocolate, but coffee is the overwhelming flavor. Very smooth, no bitter aftertaste. Finished the whole 500ml in one sitting."
"A world-class find on a recent Atlanta visit. The beer pours ....no, it plops into the glass with a solid and weighty-ness, releasting an abundance of carbonation. Later, settling into a firm dark brown hue with a 1"" foamstand that accompanied me to the bottom of the glass. Moderate, but well balanced aromas of roasted coffee, milk chocolate, lacto-fermentations, and a hint of berry tartness. Flavors are nearly as balanced with the weight of the beer falling on the chocolate side. Balanced with enough flavor (grassy, earthy) hops to make the beer pleasantly palatable. Full and rich textures conclude with a velvety finish and a lingering coffee-like bitterness. I can certainly see why this beer is among the best of BA."
"A top shelf beverage experience enhanced by the quality swing-over lid. A nice warmer. Recommended."
"Drinkability is very good for a beer that packs this much flavor. It is eerily drinkable whether warm or cold."
"The beer pours a deep, dark brown color with a towering tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wondeful malty scent that boasts of roasted and crystal malts as well as some black malts as well. It has an earthy feel. The taste is good as well. It has a rich, malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry with some residual sweetness. It has a nice black patent/coffee like finish. It's incredibly smooth with excellent carameel flavor. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an excellent porter. It's robust and full of malty goodness; a damn good drinker. I've looking forward to this one for some time."
"This beer poured black with a huge tan rocky head. The aroma is malty and sweet. The taste is bold and roasted. It is bitter (coffee) but balanced well with the malt. The mouthfeel is full and sticky. This is a delightful beer that Ill hopefully enjoy again soon."
"drinkability is excellent. well balanced, the nearly 8% abv is almost completely hidden. a fairly big beer, but quite enjoyable. really glad i finally got the chance to try this one. thanks again jason!"
"A swing-top, bottled in 2006, and cellared for 6 months. Poured into a tulip glass, it was black, with a thick mocha head. Good-looking beer. It had an intensely chocolate aroma. Taste was similar: very chocolate. At times I felt like I was eating a brownie. My only (small) quibble was I thought it was a little too carbonated. That aside, this is a wonderful beer."
"Drinkability is good. Nice porter. I prefer a few others, but I still enjoyed this one."
"The alcohol, close to 8%, hides like a car jacker in the bushes  but you know in the end you got jacked up. Yummy."
"Poured into a chalice a clean deep dark brown color, not much carbonation, no head or lacing. The nose is sweet malts, slight alcohol, nice touch of toffee/caramel. The taste is very malt, but with a nice touch of sweetness, and lots of toffee/caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice Imperial Porter from this brewery, highly recommended."
"Another nice beer from Hooker and a solid choice for an imperial porter. Sweetness is a bit prohibitive in drinkability, time to move on after one glass."
"for my bombing from babydoc, 2006 vintage"
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy, smooth and very drinkable."
"Well, that was just awesome. An incredible beer of any style, and quite possible the best Porter I've ever had. I will have to (ahhh, shucks) do a side by side with my current favorite (GLBC's Edmund Fitzgerald) but this was just a treat. Could see this paring well with a serious steak, even a seasoned one. Highly recommended, a truly great porter."
"This is definately a different kind of porter that is best saved to sip on those special occasions of cool evenings."
"Overall - an excellent seasonal porter, perfect for cool evenings in the fall/winter. Robust enough to handle a cigar"
"Drinkability: I feel buzzed almost instantly but this is an easy drinker. The ABV is ever-present but not disturbing of the flavor nor does it cause any heaviness or cloyingness. I would say, as good as it gets."
"Bottle courtesy of IMtheOptimator: Poured a hazy slightly dirty yellow color ale with a huge foamy head with good retention and good lacing. Aroma of estery yeast and spices is quite dominant as well as some tropical fruit- like sweetness. Taste is spicier then I would have expected which might be from the spice mix use in this beer or from the yeast strain use in this beer. Body is quite full and alcohol is not discernable. I thought this was reasonably well done for the style and would mind having another taste of it."
"the flavor is malty, with some carmelized malt, spiciness, hint of cocoa and coffee, lingering malt essence."
"Really good beer overall. I had FFF Alpha Klaus a couple nights ago, and this isn't quite on that level for me, but very good nonetheless. Well worth seeking out."
"Snagged this (not seemingly) 32oz swingtop bottle with a 2005 sticker on it...two years old on the shelf, for about the same price as the now-smaller bottles. Pours rather dark with a small, foamy, light brown hued head that fades. For a dark beer, fairly standard looking, but points for the cool bottle, swingtop and label. Aroma is grassy hops and some pine, with sweet malts and roasted notes in the background. Taste is dark, smooth, syrupy, and roasty without tasting gritty or charred, and some coffee, but has a distinct earthy flavor and a lingering 'dirty' caramel malt flavor in the aftertaste. This is not my favorite flavor to find in a beer...but reminds me a bit of BBC Drayman's, and if you like that, you'd love this, fair enough. Mouthfeel is smooth carbonation and full bodied. Overall this is not a 'bad' drinker, and the 2005 factor must be at play here somewhat, but it seems like the main characteristics are intact here, more so just not my style. Glad I tried it and got the 32 oz size even. I was surprised how well and how long the swingtop preserved it as I could only do half the bottle (one pint) at first due both the abv and not loving the flavors...then I sealed and reopened it multiple times till I finished it over the next TWO days, and yes, it was loosing some carbonation, but everytime I reopened it the carbonation still popped and it wasn't at all flat when I finished it off. Nice."
"Thanks to mcallister for sharing this great brew. Solid black in color. Thick tan head which held together for the life of the brew. Big milk chocolate aroma, some burnt caramel, and soft citrusy hops. The flavor seems to be more dark chocolate, and slightly roasty. A hint of coffee in the finish. Full body, lower carbonation. More caramel flavors come out as this one warms. Great amount of different chocolate characteristics. Very full of flavor. This is a gem."
"Not crazy about this one , but I will try another to age a bit."
"Drinkability: Another beer to be sipped upon. Very smooth and tasty. One of my favorite beers to sit down with and chill."
"The taste of the malts linger on the palette for a long while. I will definately be adding this to the my list of standbys."
"The color is a deep brown to black with a nice 1", creamy, mocha head that falls quickly leaving just a little bit of lacing. The smell is not strong but is of chocolate and coffee. The taste is much stronger and is dark, roasted malt and lots of coffee with a hint of sweetness and a slightly bitter back taste . The mouthfeel is rich & chewey. An excellent porter that is very drinkable."
"Poured out a guiness like dark brown with a thick creamy tan head. The nose had alcohol at first, then it gave way to coffee, cola, caramel, and something I can only desscribe as o-zone, that smell you get after a two minute rain shower hits hot concrete during the summer. The taste is big and mocha, big coffee, big mollasses, and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is fairly viscous and creamy, more like a stout than a cola crisp porter. An enjoyable beer, but pretty big, one and done."
" Anything that says store at cellar temperature right on the bottle is bound to get my attention! Poured a thick black as night opaque oil color with a nice two inch head that ever so slowly faded and stayed at about a half inch until the bottom. Very nice thick lace down the sides, gooey and creamy, very nice look to it. Smell took a while to warm up, at first was strong alcohol and caramel sweetness. As it warmed some more subtle smells started to come through, hints at chocolate and coffee started to overtake, and the alcohol quickly faded, leaving a very nice overall aroma. The taste followed the smell with the caramel hitting first. Nice flavors of coffee followed, maybe even a hazelnut hint in there, well rounded. Some warming due to the alcohol, but it was welcomed and did not impact negatively at all. Very good fell on this one, not too thick, went down very smoothly. Great consistency on this, and good carbonation. This was an excellent porter, and I would not turn this down if it was offered. Would love to try some that has been sitting for a time, as aging may well make this outstanding."
"Pours black with a light brown head and very good lacing. The smell is malty with cocoa notes and a faint whiff of bitterness. The taste is much more bitter than the smell would lead you to believe. Huge malty chocolate and coffee notes with an extremely bitter chocolate finish. Dark fruits are there too, but its quite dry and vinuous. Excellent mouthfeel- creamy but dry. Big, but drinkable."
"D - A tasty porter but too much smoke for my taste. Based on other reviews I wonder this one has not held up over time. Reminds me more of a Baltic porter with the smoke. I will definitely try to find another bottle and give this one a shot again."
"Bottled in 2005. Pleasant little spritz upon uncapping the swingtop. Pour yields an absolutely gargantuan head, colored like blanched and toasted almonds with a frothy, creamy texture and great cling around the glass. The body is a thinnish dark cola color on the pour but appears in the snifter as a glossy obsidian. Lovely soft and sour black patent aroma predominates with diminishing floral and earthy hop notes. After being cellared for more than two years, the taste of this porter is anything but aggressive. Yet it retains an edge. While primarily vinous -- nearly acidic in character, actually -- up front, with dark berry accents and an earthy bitter cocoa flavor, the finish, which begins early and lasts a very long time, is sharply bitter with black roasted grains and a deeply earthy mineral-laden hop flavor. Some of the alcohol begins to emerge in the flavor after warming for a bit. Not slick; mostly angular in mouthfeel with sharp twanginess throughout the medium-thin body. A beguiling porter -- one that has many layers of complexity and therefore is very able to provide for a truly fascinating drinking experience. It's not exactly sessionable, which may be its weakest point. I will, however, not have any trouble finishing off this oversized bottle this evening. Many thanks to dmeadows for the trade."
"A porter that can be drank all day easily. The mixture of smoothness, low too medium carbonation, and delicousness set this apart from most beers."
"The third beer from my four beer sampler at the Sunset Grill and Tap - served in a 5 oz. mini-pokal. It is almost black with a half-inch foamy tannish head that leaves decent lacing. The aroma is quite rich, with smoky, roasted/charred, and chocolatey malts. It tastes the same (richly malty) but with the addition of green hops, dark fruits, and a medium bitterness from both the hops and the charred malts. The body is medium to full with smooth, light carbonation and it leaves a medium to long finish. Overall a very nice porter, and one I was glad to see on-tap as I had been wanting to try it for awhile."
"M&D - as smooth as can be, this beer is very easy down and full flavored and full bodied, what an incredible brew. if youve never had a Thomas Hooker beer, any of them, beermail me or some other Ct.'er and trade. its worth it"
"Drinkability: Intensely drinkable. The caramel sweetness marries with the bigger, bolder, ""less drinkable"" flavors to yield a brew you can't easily put down. Wonderful stuff."
"Overall, this beer represents a lot of what I like in a porter. Perhaps an imperial porter is not my perfect beer, but for what it's trying to be, it does the job perfectly. And it's damn delicious to boot!"
"Cheers!"
"Pours a deep brown/black that only yields highlights to direct light. Delicate espresso head that fades to a dusting and a collar. Beautiful coffee aromas on the nose, with roasted malts taking most of the load. Hints of English stout sourness come through in the aroma as well, along with some saltiness. On the palate, bright carbonation, perhaps just a bit overdone, first off, then a sweet and sour mixture of dark malts, followed by some malt and hop bitterness, berry fruits, and finishing with an oaky sweetness. The malts in this beer make for a very smooth drinking experience, in spite of the thickness of the beer and the high ABV. In all, this is an excellent beer. All the parts fit together seamlessly. The oakiness is not overdone, the coffee and roasted malt elements are entirely in line with the style, and it's very drinkable. In spite of my initial skepticism, this beer works, and works well at that."
"D: The ale is excellent, full of deep roasted coffee flavors and a smooth finish. This is, to date, amongst the top five American porters that I've had."
"D: Very tasty, easy-to-drink, a little bit filling, good kick to it, this beer is a good sipper, but you can certainly sip it quickly. After missing the 2005 release, I was waiting on the 2006 release and it certainly lived up to my expectations."
"Wow, what a taste. I'm going to have to go get me some more of this. In my top 3 porters, definitely."
"DA: This is a heavy weight Porter, this is the George Foreman of Porters! It could give some of the RIS stouts a run for the money in every catagory. I had no problem finishing of the Quart size bomber...but two would be way too many!! Good stuff."
"Extremely tasty and very drinkable. One of th ebest porters I have ever had."
"This beer was excellent. It didn't seem too heavy and the flavors were a perfect mix of bitter roast and malty sweetness. I could session this one all day though I think the alcohol would sneak up on me. A highly recommended porter..."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a very full body. It is a very smooth and easy to drink porter. If this came to Cincinnati I would regularly drink this beer. Super nice!"
"drinkable?: kinda, if it was better I would think it more drinkable."
"My bottle of Thomas Hooker is the 2005 edition, in an enormous swing top bottle (1qt, 1.8 fl oz; I think this is equal to 1L). It pours a completely opaque black, with a thick tan head in my snifter. Good lacing. Aroma is malty, with deep roasted notes, some coffee and a whole bunch of chocolate. All with a layer of hops to back it up. Taste is just a delicious combination of chocolate, deep dark maltiness and what seems like a whole lot of hops. This isn't a hoppy beer, really, but I'm sure they used a ton of 'em to get this flavor. Great balance. Very full bodied, with a relatively low amount of carbonation. Quite drinkable for its strength, but compared to beers with lower ABVs in the style, it suffers a bit. But only a bit. A great beer. My first from Hooker, but it won't be my last."
"The beer poured with very little head that soon dissipated leaving only the dark chocolate brown liquid in my glass. The odor of this Imperial Porter is that of a very pleasant rich roasted malt. The flavor from only a small sip of this astounding beverage fills the mouth. It is a strong chocolaty and maybe slightly smoky flavor that leaves an after taste much like the initial flavor. It feels smooth in mouth and going down. This is easily drinkable for those into more flavorful styles of beers. If you like this beer style, you will enjoy this beer."
"Very smooth, yet pungent in the mouth. Very strange, but also very good. Sip it, and and take it all in."
"Cheers!"
"D- This is a big malty beer with nice complexity while staying very drinkable. The 1 liter bottle was the perfect size."
"Drinkability: This is a big bottle. Too big, but just barely. I am glad it is a swingtop so I can save some for later. The beer is easy sipping and highly enjoyable."
"Burnt caramel flavors are present, crisp"
"Would benefit from more aroma and flavor up front, but quite good by the end."
"When drinking this fabulous brew, one must ask oneself: Just how Imperial can a Porter get? The answer is 19, but that's the answer to every question. This brew is all about the over-the-top coffee, toffee, caramel and chocolate flavors and aromas it posesses. It has plenty of vivacious carbonation, even after six months of storage on its side in my cellar. Get a friend or two for this one, beacuse a liter of Porter can be a dangerous thing."
"Good looking porter - dark, creamy with nice but muted chocolate and malt scents. The taste was not what I expected. It had some traditional malty/roasted malt/ chocolate flavors but there was a bitterness that throws the flavor off. It tastes like a wild porter with a distinct funkiness. Not sure if this is what this beer is supposed to be but if it is then this is my last bottle."
"The first pour had minimal head with a dark brown color. The second pour had more of a head, once the beer was warmer. It is intensely rich, and definitely a sipping beer. The taste is defined by a burnt-coffe maltiness (think Starbucks) with a little alcohol and hops to back it up. This is a very nice offering, and it gets better as it warms. A great special occaision beer, THIP is a welcomed seasonal."
"It's good. A little much on the burnt malt sort of taste. Sort of in the gray area of stout and porter, but again, very good."
"2005: Very dark brown with amber highlights and very slightly hazed. Short tan head off the pour that produced a little lace. The aroma was a combination of roast/light coffee, malt sweetness, chocolate, and fresh, green hops. Solid bitterness, both from hopping and dark grains. Very roasted and dry with bittersweet chocolate and plenty of malt sweetness. Hop flavour hits immediately, then washes away as the malt comes forward. Slight astringency with moderately low carbonation and a full body. An excellent beer with great balance. Highly drinkable. Thanks northyorksammy!"
"Highly recommended."
"Dark colour, thin head, then after bigger head,bit of lace, excellent roast and hop aroma, smooth chocolate taste. Perfect carbonation, bit of bitterness but smooth for taste, nice roastiness. Underlying bitterness, but balanced with maltiness. Rich, full mouthfeel. Moderate astringency would be Great with dinner."
"Pours vibrantly with an impressive dimpled cappuccino colored head of small and medium bubbles. Slow to settle, leaving strands of thick lacing. Deep, dark black with cordovan highlights. The smell is rich with coffee notes, roasted whole bean with some caramel and chocolate. The taste is filled with rich caramel and roasted coffee, sweet and with some alcohol which warms through the finish. Chocolate and roasted coffee bitterness appear in the finish. Full bodied and slightly slick on the tongue. Minimal carbonation, but this is not a problem. The Imperial Porter is wonderful and possessing great drinkability. Spectacularly enjoyable. This is a must try."
"Brown with a faint reddish tint and a fluffy tan head. A powerful aroma of roasted malt and dark bakers chocolate. The first sip lets you know you are drinking a big bitter bitch. Very roasty with ample bakers chocolate. Very little sweetness to this though you do get cocoa and caramel notes beneatht he bitter coffee notes.. Very satisfying to drink and if beer really did put hair on your chest this one would make you look like Chewbacca."
"Good mouthfeel but a bit thin. Typical of the style. Excellent drinkability. Well blended flavors which sit light on the stomach."
"make sure you let this sit out a bit before drinking, this isn't nearly as good refridgerator cold."
"got a 32 oz bottle at Julios in Westborough. Tried this at the last BA fest I went to and have been looking for it in Worc area. Pours dark Brown ..almost blackish with a beauty of a head..very dense. Well balanced mix of hoppy bitterness with a nice shot of maltiness. Tastes of coffee and choc. with a hint of dark mollasses in its sweetness. Great mouthfeel...almost chewy. These great dense Porters and stouts I've been drinking lately have made some of my old favorites taste almost watery to me....I don't know what I'd do if someone handed me a Coor's light at this point...maybe water a plant. Anyway great beer....grab one if you get the chance..well worth the money"
"This porter pours a dark brown, very close to black and leaves a thick tan head. It smells of brown sugar, dark chocolate, wafers, bread, and molasses. The taste is bitter citrus rinds, espresso, feel on the palate. The sweetness in the brew tastes like dark molasses, dark bitter sweet chocolate, dark roasted coffee, the taste is great. This brew finishes with some brown sugar sweetness, and some carbonation bite in this fantastic brew."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is really good on this offering from Thomas Hooker. Very well balanced imperial with a descent amount of carbonation. Warms you as it goes down. Drinkability is pretty high depending on if you can finish a whole one will determine if you can have another one. A quart is pretty big. Would have again in a second."
"Mmmm, yum. A nice, thick and dark looking brown, almost black, with a healthy head on there. Very fruity in the nose, lots of dark cherries, almost a grapey aroma. Plenty of mustyness as well, with a hint of alcohol. All of this comes out in the darkly complex taste. Really malty upfront, almost reminiscent of a scotch ale. I know this beer isn't really up there in terms of ABV, but it's got that oaky, woody, aged sort of boozy dryness and must to it. Also, quite a lot of bitterness to this beer, lots from the burnt malty notes, but also a lot from some nice fruity, floral hops. It really all melds together well and doesn't confuse itself or the drinker. When I first cracked this beer I thought it might be overly thick or unnecessarily strong, being an ""Imperial"" porter, but I'm surprised by the really smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel. Suits this beer perfectly. Nice, finally an ""Imperial"" something that isn't just a ""bigger is better"" kind of thing. This is a really well made beer."
"I like the mouthfeel on this one, it's light-medium bodied, not syrupy or coating like others. I find it easy to drink, goes down smooth. Just needs more balance, I find it too hoppy for my taste, maybe some aging will mellow that out?"
"All in all, I would like to try this again soon. It was a pleasant beer and a good American Porter"
"This is a hell of a beer."
"This pours a jet black with a huge tan creamy head.The head lasts forever and leaves a nice lacing.The smell is a full aroma of roasted malt and coffee or expresso beans.The taste is very good. Your taste buds are bombarded with a strong coffee and a roasty flavor.This has a sweet aftertaste that mixes nicely with the bitter hops and coffee flavor.This is an outstanding beer that should not be missed."
"This is a really nice example of creating a huge beer that has separate phases; It takes you on a ride of extremes, alcohol and smooth coffee, biting carbonation and a smooth finish; Definitely an experience worth the price of admission for the small portion of the beer drinking world into sipping porters."
"Drinkability- I'll pass on this one in the future unless I got an infected bottle. Kinda bummed as I was really looking forward to this one."
"The finish is fairly dry and leaves alot of flavor on your tongue. I enjoyed this brew very much and cant wait to go back for another."
"Cheers"
"Hooker Imperial Porter is a humdinger of a beer and is further evidence that the brewers at Troutbrook Brewing Company are geniuses. Of course I didn't need any further proof after drinking and being floored by a liter of their doppelbock. Rest assured, I'll continue to seek out as many hookers (uh... Hookers) as I can lay my hands on. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to far333 for this beauty."
"This has a big, full body to support all the massive flavor. It has the texture of melted silk on your tongue as it glides across your palate, coating it with layers of malt and hops. This beer is a masterpiece. Every bit as good as my beloved Old Marley, and a great way to celebrate a big birthday."
"A very very dark brown beer with deep mahogony highlights. Has a big bubbly brown head. Deep coffee aroma with some chocolate notes and a hint of flowers in the background. Some chocolate sweetness dances on the tip of your tongue. Then the strong roasted coffee bitterness takes charge and slides easily into a smooth bittersweet chocolate finish. Has a great rich mouthfeel."
"Taste was remarkably different from what I'd expect out of an Imperial Porter...rush of hops, strong, (acrid almost) coffee, and some very strong lager yeast taste, more than I think I should have been able to taste. Despite trying to let both glasses I had warm up some, hoping for better results I was denied. The beer seemed to grow more bitter and slightly more single dimensional as it warmed. I can't say I'll be trying another of these big bad boys."
"D- Its a sipping brew, a pretty damn tasty at that."
"Poured a dark amber / brown color with a small light tan head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of roast, chocolate, and sweet caramel malts. Taste of roasted, and small caramel malts, smoke, and lots of chocolate. Very light alcohol in the taste."
"Mouthfeel was dry and dusty, and alcohol was well in check. This little brewery can do no wrong it seems."
"Thanks to cmaruschak for sharing. Lovely opaque black color with a medium thick and foamy tan head. Thin sheet of lacing. The aroma is a shocker - the first thing I thought of was a Christmas beer. Tons of spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, etc erupt into the nasal passages. There is a bit of a roast character in the nose that comes through at times but it is overwhelmed by the spices. After the initial surprise this is pretty easy to enjoy. Medium body with lots of spice character, along with some roasted malt and bitter chocolate flavors. The finish is dry and somewhat bitter with coffee and hops. Whether this bottle was ""off"" or not, I liked it."
"LARGE bottle, with swingtop, 2004 vintage, opens with a lot of energy and this one is full of fizz, seems initially to be quite actively carbonated. settles down after quite awhile, and pours black with an active and long lasting dark tan head. Lacing is fine and extensive. Nose is cafe au lait. This is a dense and rich brew. Mucho chocolate, roasted grains, dark coffee, vanilla evident. Luxorious and chewy, first class elixir. Mighty tasty creation from Hooker."
"Overall, a decent sessioner, but not too quaffable. Nevertheless, a fantastic brew from one of the best breweries out here on the East Coast."
"2003 bottle. Pours out a pure black color with some lighter brown highlights and a nice dark tan head. Smell consisted of big roasted malts along with cocoa. This baby doesn't have any sweetness to it, which is good to see. Some underlying chocolate aromas show through as well. Taste was great. Deep malt backbone begins with some chocolate and coffee which wasn't in the nose, start to blend in. Some dark fruit underlies it all. Mouthfeel was medium with a good check on carbonation. Finished with some alcohol kick but seemed to be right in place. I'm surprised that this bottle held up that much. I was expecting some strange flavors because it's 2 years old, but this bottle held up quite nicely. Great beer."
"This is a great treat if you come across it. Ideal for cooler months of the year, but it is so flavorful I won't be able to pass on it if it's 120 degrees outside. This is a great brew to be shared amongst friends due to its heaviness and bold flavors. Another phenomenal brew from the boys at Troutbrook!"
"Another big thanks to mentor for graciously sharing his stash of goodies!"
"Nice big swing top with a bottled in 2004 sticker across the top. Body is a shade less than black in color with a healthy tan head. Nice chunky lacing as well. Interesting aroma with tart dark fruit notes as well as a big sweetness. Chocolate and a touch of roastiness. Solid flavor of chocolate, some caramel and roastiness. Sweet and tart notes from dark fruity esters. Ends on a lightly bitter roasty note. The tartness seemed not to mesh well at times but overall it worked. Medium slick body. Fairly easy drinking and tasty. I would pick this up again, good Imperial/Baltic Porter but not quite top of the food chain good. Thanks goes to Mr. ppoitras for the bottles of this brew."
"Very full in mouthfeel and slightly coating, but with enough bitterness to keep it from cloying. Good, good stuff."
"Thanks to Shapudding for sharing and to ""deep throat."""
"The flavor shows off even more complexity. Starts with rich, dark porter qualities of toasted malt and bitter dark chocolate, giving way to slightly sweeter plum and black cherry. Eases it's way into a bit more bitter, hoppy, warming finish. The alcohol is subtle, but noticeable. The mouthfeel was devilishly smooth from start to finish, of both glass and bottle. An exquisite, complex, belly warmer of a porter."
"Super-huge thanks to Sulldaddy for sending me this one. What a f'ing unique beer. Bottled in 2004. Poured a lushious 2 finger brown head over a dark dark liquid. Held to light, the color is deep mohogeny ruby. Smells woody hoppy, roast/chocolatey, and alcoholic. Yeah, roasty/chocolatey...but also a bit of smokey. More than that...charred. Some cottony hop character (Fuggles?) and mechanic-shop hop character (Perle?) invite me in. As good as it smells, it tastes even better. Chocolate to start with a mild alcohol and noticable hop bitter. The bitter is strong and cotton-mouthy, but its rough character is tempered by an underlying wet sweet. Whoa, the middle is a hop bomb of flavor. Minty hops (plus some zing). It must be Perle, with perhaps some Fuggles (or Wmette). Onward into more flavors...imagine roasting a marshmallow and sticking it right into the fire. Let the outside burn black, then pull it off the stick and eat the char. The aromatic qualities of the hops, when combined with the roasted grains, have a similar character. But its woody, too (like you dapped the flaming marshmallow on one of the burning logs, you idiot...except it works really well). In the later part of the sip, sugar sweet rises before being overwhelmed by a faster rising alcohol burn and aromatic hop aftertaste. Yummy! Boy, there's alot at play here. Plus, a thin layer of brown head still hangs over the liquid with incredible lacing on the inside of the glass. Who can make a beer like this? Truely incredible. So, do I finish the liter or save half to split with my best buddy? Well, I'm quite lit now (I had two before this) and I think I'll be kind and save the second half. Thick body and mild carbonation (despite the amazing head). Interestingly, the carbonation continues to form on my tongue after the beer is down my throat. Now, *that's* a thick beer. Near perfection, I wish I had another that I could age in my cellar."
"Drinkability: For a bigger bear with so much flavor it is wonderfully smooth and easy to drink. Aside from the weak smell I was very impressed with this beer."
"A very good beer. I would recommend anyone who can get their hands on it to try it"
"Bottled in 2004. Opaque, brown-black with chestnut highlights. Frothy, thick, tan head fades into just a creamy coating in a few minutes. Smells of dark roasted German malts, burnt coffee, sweet milk chocolate, dark chocolate covered cherries. Smells are a bit more subdued than I would've liked. Tasts of dark roasted malt, chocolate (sometimes like milk chocolate, sometimes dark unsweetened), spicy German hops, and French roast coffee round into a solid bitter finish that parks itself in the back of your throat and dries your mouth entirely. Taste is on but a little too dry. Mouth is wonderfully thick, full and creamy. Bubbles are plenty but the space between them is not. Good stuff."
"Not what I was expecting after all the hype and honestly I was a bit disappointed. Nice 2004 swing-top bottle. Served room temperature because that is how I prefer my porters. The appearance and aroma were overall quite good. Poured a chocolate brown with a finger deep head. The aroma is dark chocolate and very bitter coffee. The taste had a very strong alcohol bite and was not very smooth. The hop bitters also kicked in high gear, but I could not really find the malts to balance it out. I let it breathe for a while and came back, but the malts were still all lost. The mouthfeel is just all bitter hops, the blance is lacking. The drinkability for me is rather low because between the alcohol and the hops I am now enjoying this beer within the style. While I recognize it in and of itself as a singular beer, I still cannot find much that makes me go ""Wow!"""
"-No thanks to ""Deep Throat"" who did not send this to me, and I am not thanking for this one!! ;)~"
"Thanks to sulldaddy for the hookup."
"Beer #900 on my personal list, and an appropriate way to mark the milestone. With the Imperial Porter designation, I wasn't sure what to expect - probably something along the Baltic Porter style, I thought. My impression, however, was more of a very robust American porter. Black tinged with mocha. Aroma was dark roasted malt. A bit of creaminess in the mouthfeel, with a dense, dark roasted malt and espresso coffee flavor."
"The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy, perfect for the taste. Great body. And the drinkability was also exceptional... one bottle was enough for me (it WAS a liter, though *LOL*) and I would gladly drink it again. The only thing that puts me off a bit is the price. But for a special occasion, if you want a dark beer, this is a wonderful choice."
"Notes: I now know why this is the #1 rate American Porter. It deserves all the honors and titles that are bestowed upon it. I can only continue to thank cmaruschak for letting me experience this fantastic beer."
"A big shout out to Kevin (kmpitz2) for sharing this with me, and also a big thanks for Pete (ppoitras) for trading this to him! 1 Liter swingtop bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a deep jet black color with two fingers of dark tan head. There is just a little bit of lacing. The smell is very sweet, with lots of caramel and molasses. Not too shabby. The taste is damn fine. Lots of sweet and bitter hitting my tongue at the same time. Molasses sweetness and coffee bitterness reign supreme. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, and the drinkability is good for such a high gravity beer. One again, thanks to Kev and Pete for this beauty."
"Thanks to ppoitras and kmpitz2 for bringing this beer to my glass. Big liter flip-top bottle. I like the bottle. It pours a very dark color with a medium head that sticks around a little while and leaves a little lacing on the glass. Looks good. The aroma is of roasted malts and bitterness with a hint of fruits. The flavor is much the same. Lots of bitterness in there. Has a good taste from dark malts and coffee. The mouthfeel is very thick and heavy - nice. Drinkability is good, but I thought that the bitter bite was a bit too strong for my preference."
"Thanks to ppoitras for giving me the chance to try this fine beer. Pours a nice black color with a big fluffy thick tan head that falls slowly. The nose is coffee bitter with a touch of dark fruit in there as well. The flavor is nice, with a big blast of roasted coffee, that sticks around huge on the finish as a hoppy bitter. Wow. I really like it. The feel is thick as thick can be, somewhat creamy. A nice beer overall. The bitter is pretty strong, but I do like it still. It takes away from the drinkability, as I can't take it down quite as fast as I would like. I am very glad I had the chance to try this one, and I recommend finding it if you can."
"Thank you, unionmade. My life is now complete, *OK* being a bit dramatic, but this is an amazing beverage. One that I will seek out in trade whenever there is the chance. I wish I could get this around here. Boo hoo, it's almost gone... :-("
"First off what a cool f*^&ing swingtop bottle.. That will definetly be used to hold some kick ass homebrew when I start doing 5 gallon batches again.. Pours a deep dark brown almost black color with a robust head that simmers ever so slowly leaving a lingering lace. Aromas are a mix of faint cocoa and roast along with a slight vinous character. I don't know if its my nose or what but I just can't pick up too much on this one. Flavors are full and complex. There is an upfront sweetness and a chocolate like feel with a hint of roast that has no astringency with it. Following there is a slight vinous and molasses character with just a hint of caramel. The finish is slightly hoppy and nicely bitter with yet more roasty and cocoa characteristics. The body of this brew is simply beautiful and full and just completely well rounded flavorwise. For drinkability, I can put this simply: I'm drinking this bottle completely to myself and wishing I had another to savor right after I finished the last drop.. Simply superb.."
"Intense coffee & chocolate flavours, some subtle dark fruit notes lurk underneath. Big, bold hops with great notes of citrus & pine. Full bodied, smooth, prickly carbonation. Pick some up."
"Thomas hooker Imperial Porter 2004 is not quite my cup of beer. The packaging of the huge liter bottle is impressive but the taste I've come to love from winter porters wasn't quite here. The porter was on the bitter side which while not bad kind of masked the flavors a lot and the hops were just a tad too much for such a big offering. This beer is probably a favorite of the stout crowd because that is what it reminded me of. All said, it was a decent brew but I still don't know what the fuss is about. i'll probably try this again in a week to see if I still feel the same way but for now I'm moving on."
"Smooth is the first word that comes to my mind. Like a chocolate and coffee egg cream (for those of you in NY) with less fizz. A mix of milk chocolate and dark chocolate shavings melting on my tongue. VERY assertive flavor. A blast of chlorophyll and slightly tingly bitterness surges in and joins the barrage of flavor half-way through. Each sip is a reminder of how good it is, as if you forget in the few seconds that pass between them. Looks perfect, from the bottle to the body to the head. Smell is deeeluxe earthy vegetation, m&ms, and a nuttiness not unlike what I find in Bell's beers. The only imperfection that show itself to me is the overly vegetal finish. It is still an amazingly focused beer with the flavors fitting together seamlessly. Wow."
"Awesome beer and a phenemenol winter beer release from this great Hartford, CT brewery. This is the best Thomas Hooker offering I have had yet. This beer is worth seeking out."
"Opaque extremely dark brown. Sticky light brown head consisting of tiny bubbles stuck to each other. Gorgeous. Multi-faceted malt aroma. Pumpernickel bread, monstruous chocolate, well put lactic hints, caramel richness, woody vanilla, subtle roastiness, this has it all and well expressed at that. Extremely malty taste, much roastier than anticipated also far hoppier, theres quite an honest bitter slice to cut the sweetness. Mild licorice flavor, vanilla, vegetal tones. Medium to full bodied, very low carbonation. Here I go again, this had the potential to be world-class, but theres just something that feels wrong with Troutbrooks beers mouthfeel. They can be thick and rich, but they dont seem to be living, they cant seem to use any carbonation to transport their flavors and I think the beers suffer a lot from this. The just seem much more stable and stuck in their little universe, far less adaptative, creative and evolving. So in other words, this beer rocks, yet it could easily do better."
"Delicious malty mixture (cocoa, chocolate, dark fruits, raisins) with a nice generous hoppiness. A tasty brew and much better than that other pitiful offering they call Liberator."
"Thomas Hooker Imperial Porter was served from a big 1 liter flip-top bottle that was sealed with a bottled in 2003 label. In my Duvel tulip, the beer was shiny black with dark chestnut accents, and was topped by a beautiful reddish-brown head that left fine wavy sheets of lacing. The multi-faceted, luscious nose held rich n roasty, lightly smokey chocolatey malts, fresh out-of-the-oven apple-cherry fruit pie aromas, a subtle cutting lime undercurrent, and a perfect whisp of alcohol. The taste was decadent and delicious, with velvety-creamy roasty deep dark chocolate nutty almond malts that developed some cherry-plum esters and notes of subtle baked apple, cocoa liquor, vanilla, and sassafras, leading to a perfectly bittered, rich dark chocolate ganache spicy-hopped finish that left excellent residual estery chocolate liquor flavors. This impy porter was quite monsterous, but was amazingly balanced and drinkable with a overall dryness. The body was amazingly smooth and creamy, with a lovely oilyness that added much to the pleasure factor. I really loved everthing about this superbly-crafted imperial porter...one of the best youll ever find."
"Thnaks to wyllder for this offering. Poured black with an outstanding head. Smell was malty with a hint of the sweetness to follow in the taste. Taste was lightly sweet throughout and remained so from the front palalte to the back. Mouthfeel was smooth, with a lightly dry finish...very nice. Drinkability for abv was smooth and sippable."
"Thanks to pbrian for sending this my way many months ago. I wanted to wait for the cold chill of an autumn night, but I settled for an usually chilly mid-August evening."
"Wyll-"
"By this point I think you can guess that I found this brew to be exquisitely drinkable. Troutbrook B.C.'s Imperial Porter easily meets the high expectations I had for it after having tried their Liberator doppelbock. This porter is simply amazing, a real achievement for the style."
"Big cheers to sulldaddy for this one!"
"This beer is black for all intents and purposes. But I see the faintest streaks of dark ruby red in there as well. Nice crown of light brown head. Creamy and dense in nature. Retention is solid. Quality aroma. Cocoa powder. Bittersweet chocolate. Roasted malts. A little smoke. Nice nose. Nice silky mouthfeel. Close to full in body. And the taste is very nice. Lots of roasted/chocolate/black malt flavor. Not abrasive though, just right. Great coffee undertones. Slight tones of tobacco and lactic sugars. And there's a nice lingering dry roasted malt, slightly bitter hoppiness on the finish. It makes me want to drink it all the more. Good thing it comes in this fabulous Liter size bottle."
"Overall, a good strong porter. Huge thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for sharing his liter bottle!"
"Poured an oily blackness. Only the barest amount of ruby hints at the edges. Massively thick tan-colored head puts on a great cascading show. Great lacing. Aromas consist of sweet chocolate, bitter hops, and a large latte' from the coffee shop. Alcohol is well-hidden in the nose. A bit of smoke creeps up from the glass as well. Flavor is good as well, with a dance of chocolate, toffee, caramel, and smoke. Finishes on the dry side, with some bitterness at the end. Very creamy mouthfeel, but it was a little thinner than I expected. Still, a very drinkable beer that hides the ABV well."
"Another beer that I have been anticipating. Pours out pitch black with a small tan head that seams to last. Smell is heavy coffee and chocolate notes. Hints of alcohol come through as well. Taste is very smooth. Coffee and chocolate are powerfull and leave a bitterness as well. Nice warming feeling. The mouth feel is actually medium heavy in body. A get a grassy aftertaste as well. A wonderful beer from a great brewery. Too bad this is the only bottle I have."
"A true roasted wonder. A black brew with a nice creamy, tan head. Aroma leaning heavy on grainy roasted malt. A creamy medium textured brew with a delicious bitter, dry and nutty finish. Seems to have a good dose of earthy hops bittering this thing. It has plenty of roasty flavors giving it a little acidity to balance a light sweet malt, balanced with some chocolate flavors. A unique beer among Porters."
"This beer poured into my snifter with a thick meringue brown head that wouldn't quit. Clear black liquid underneath. Fresh florally hop aroma greets the nose first, then lots of coffee and roasted grain notes. A little alcohol comes through as it warms. First sip is a refreshing mix of floral/grassy hop bitterness up front, and a strong coffee flavor presented in a silky, lucious mouthfeel. Some sweeter dark fruits like prunes and raspberries hang around as well. Carbonation is light. Becomes even hopppier as it warms. Finish is sweet and full without being cloying. A warming beer but one that isn't too difficult to finish the liter. (I still wouldn't mind having 12 oz bottles around to grab at will instead of having to make the 1 liter committment, but I'm nit picking here) Interesting American take on the style with not a hint of the vinous characteristic you get from the classics. Nicely done."
"Can't believe I didn't crack this bottle until now! This is great stuff. Pours from the one liter swingtop bottle a dark brown, espresso color. It took a vigorous pour to kick up the head but it rose up to about an inch high and lingered long, and was the light brown color of cocoa powder. Aroma quickly rose up to hit my nose with roasted malts, a fine hint of raisin, some caramel, and bitter coffee. A smooth and creamy, somewhat chalky but not tannic mouthfeel gives way to ever-evolving flavors of cocoa, dark brown sugar, bits of raisin and fig, swirling into bitter coffee in the finish, and lingering with a smokey hoppy bitter aftertaste. Drank the whole liter in one sitting. Glad to know I have 2 more stashed in the cellar. Paul Davis has done it again."
"Pouring into the glass, the light through the glass totally disappeared! This was almost a black beer w/ a mocha chocolate head which crested at about 2"" high. The head also clinged to the glass a lot which was pretty cool! Upon smelling it, I got the odor of a lot of maltiness, caramel, and a scent of pear maybe? Tasting it, the caramel coffee flavor really came through making my taste buds very very happy! It was a beautifully malty porter, which has a slightly sweet finish due to the caramel sitting so heavy throughout. Texture= a very full bodied beer and very drinkable...it took me nearly 3 different sittings to finish this one! However, it was also heavenly!!! Enjoy!!!!"
"Xaipe, Bro"
"Thank you to UnionMade for a bottle of this simply amazing porter! A great one for a 400th review; an imperial porter that tastes like a regular porter on steroids...a simply wonderful character with just the right amount of sweetness, and absolutely one I hope to have again!!"
"Meduim-full body with the scales leaning towards full. Gentle carbonation. I was extremely glad this came in a liter bottle. Another gem brought back from Boston."
"685"
"1 liter swing-top bottle, bottled in 2003. Dark as all ""get out", and inky as hell. Opaque with a nice, off-white/tan head of fluffy foam. Aromas are of currants, dark belgian chocolate, caramel, other dark fruits, slight alcohol, deep roasted malts, and background hops. The taste follows suit. Chocolatey, fruity, caramely, and boozy, with just the right hop>malt balance. The mouthfeel was a bit thin, but not watery, and the drinkability was damn good. Nice stuff!"
"This beer poured picture perfect, dark burnt brown with a moderate head. There were aromas of coffee, chocolate, grapefruit hops and roasted meats. There wer deep fruit flavors, dark malted candy and a crisp dry hop finish with crisp hop bite. The alcohol was well disguised behind the super balanced malt/hop/carbonation and I did not realize it until I stepped away from the chair I was in. This was a good beer on a cold winter evening, worth the price for a big, burly, inebriating beer."
"On a side note, I don't really like these liter bottles. Dogwood and Sweetwater use them for their winter beers, but the way the neck bulges, it makes it impossible to pour without glugging the beer. In beers with low to moderate carbonation like this, it's not that big of a deal as the agitation doesn't send the head out of control, but with a more highly carbonated beer, this could prove problematic."
"1 Liter Bomber: Dark. This beer is dark brown with hints of ruby when held up to a light. Good size tan head. Decent lacing down the glass. Aroma is rich with roastiness, coffee and chocolate. The taste is rich: this is a full-bodied beer. Big roasty taste. The chocolate and coffee are still there is force. A hint of hops in there somewhere. This was even better than when I got an early taste right off the vat. Excellent job on this one, Paul!"
"Godly carbonation filled my pint. It looks like its from a pub can. I'm really enjoying this swing top bottle. Thank god its a liter bottle because I really like a full imperial pint of imperial porter. Wafts of coffee, sweet roast; hops and spices reach my nose. The beer tastes so clean and complex. You can pick out every flavor. Yes some floral notes, hops, coffee, a tinge of smokiness, and black malt. Its really surprising the flavors stay so distinct. Amazing. Get me a juicy hamburger with cheddar cheese, thick fries and a wedge pickle please. This beer is a beautiful creation."
"Excellent. AS close to perfection as I have found and right here in CT. A beuatiful jet black with a tight brown head. Aroma and taste of coffee, dark chocolate and mint. Smooth on the tounge, not bitter or cloying and finishes beautifully dry. An wonderful brew and I will need to track down some more. Love the litre bottle, too."
"The beer is only medium bodied, I would have expected a little more thickness, and is very easy to drink. I wish I had had a chance to sample this on tap as well. Definitely worth trying/picking up if you see it."
"This is perhaps one of the very few beers that's better than the original. This porter exceeded my high expectations, and then some. I'll be hoarding this stuff for the rest of the year."
"Beautiful deep dark color with a thick tan head. Really active nose of roasted malts and coffee bean with a hint of leafy hops. Taste is awesome from first sip. Unbelievable rich flavors of roasted malt and coffee bean with really nice sweet undertow of caramel and bittersweet chocolate. And if that isn't enough there is a really nice hop finish that has tartness reminiscent of a really strong fresh espresso. The hops in this really make it awesome. This beer had a really drinkable quality and no syrupy or heavy finish you might expect with such a big beer and style. This is a limited release and I can kick myself for only buying two bottles."
"Served on tap at Eli Cannon's tonight, in a nice full pint glass for the bargain price of $3.50. I was very happy to see this on tap as I've been dying to try it. Now I want more...the Hooker Imperial Porter arrived in my glass a deep midnight black, with just traces of dark tan foam on top, moderate carbonation. A fresh hop aroma greets you at first then is overtaken by strong scents of coffee and roastiness. Taste is very much coffee-is and roasty at first, then some nice hop bitterness comes in to complement the roasted malt. Becomes sweeter toward the end with hints of raisin and just a bit of nice alcohol warmth. Quite smooth and drinkable for a big porter....excellent brew from Troutbrook."
