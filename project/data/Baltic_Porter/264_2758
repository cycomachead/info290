4.32,3.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"330 ml bottle into snifter, best before 11/4/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense brown head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, prune, fig, licorice, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, prune, fig, licorice, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, prune, fig, licorice, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and dark fruit flavors; with a nice roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible Baltic porter. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 31, 2014"

4.81,15.3,4.5,4.75,5,5,4.5,"I could see some lees at the bottom of the bottle so I was gentle in my pour. OMFG, it pours like heavy-weight motor oil! No head and just wisps as a result. Color was deep-brown (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. I put my snout into the glass and inhaled and was met by an unparalleled booziness. I was transported back to the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern, while Stosh was still alive and in ownership. We would drink Baltic Porters and smoke dark cigars, like Parodis and maduros and shoot the shit, a publican and a barfly. Back to the present. I took another sniff and got Dark Chocolate pudding. I was reminded of Vanilla Snak Paks the other day and this was reminiscent of Dark Chocolate Snak Paks. I got a little in my mouth and it was exactly like pudding! It was thick, viscous, kind of sweet, and definitely full of fusel alcohol heat! I may need to lay down after this one. Carbonation was so low as to be almost non-existent. Warming, I began to note charcoal smoke, anise, dark chocolate, tar and still, the unrelenting heat. Phew! This was no playing around. I am sure that it is much more appropriate during the Winter months, especially up in Finland, but I just did not feel like waiting that long. Haluan vierailee Suomessa ja mene jääkiekko peli! This Finnish beer was fin(n)ishing me and it was only the middle of the afternoon! The Finnish fin(n)ish was dry. Duh! I felt like I had been caught in the solar plexus. My breath was taken. This was a big, brawling monster which was determined to send me back to my corner to throw in the towel. I am too stupid to lie down, though, which is how I won many of my fights in the Navy. I would be half dead, but by outlasting my opponent, I would win on points. You don't think that I became this good looking naturally, do you? I reloaded and raised a toast in a northeasterly direction, towards this beast's country of origin. I was rendered nearly insensate and I suddenly remembered Nietzsche's warning that ""when you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you."" I was engaged in advanced navel gazing at this point. Tentacles began to come forth from my navel and I shook hands before wrestling with them, finally resorting to knives to cut them from whence they came. Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? Yaaah! I called my mouthpiece for his learned advice at this point and he advised me to drink more of the same. I love having Jimmy Keaveney on retainer. Suddenly, my glass was empty, no longer marked ""Drink me!"" and I was back in my bed with Auntie Em looking down at me, asking why I was wearing a gingham dress and ruby slippers while now sporting a long beard. Say, how long was I with this one?!? Where did I go? This is not my beautiful wife! Well, how did I get here?!?","woodychandler","Jul 20, 2014"

Don't get me wrong - there's plenty of incredible renditions of the style out there, but they're all directly or indirectly modeled after this one. Each and every occasion I drink it becomes a ""where were you when"" kind of memory - it remains truly special stuff even if, as mentioned, more breweries now offer similar offerings.

My wife and I couldn't call the sweetness out by name until the next morning. I took a whiff of the warm remnants left in the glass and immediately picked up on raisins or prunes. Taste had average porter bitterness. Viscosity was above average and higher alcohol was apparent. Decent aftertaste. I think I actually served it too cold at first (maybe 40 deg or so).

The aroma is heavy with charred wood, and vinous oxidation, supported by dark fruits, smoke and dark chocolate. Little to no hop aroma or alcohol presence. The flavor is a hint of sweet sugar up front that quickly becomes smokey with light fruits and a bit of wine like flavor. A charred ashy flavor sweeps in and lingers long into the finish of every sip. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a full almost gritty mouthfeel.

Unsurprisingly, this means that I've had the beer many, many times, and will gladly go back to it any time. It deserves the praise that it has gotten, although it's sometimes better known outside of Finland. Although the Koff Porter isn't most chocolate flavoured of stouts, or doesn't boast intensive coffee or strange herbs, it still deserves to be rated highly. Why? Because of its uncompromising devotion to the core of what a porter is supposed to be. It's perfectly balanced, deep, and truly black.","Arborescence","Feb 13, 2013"

With that being said, I was sort of torn while judging because sometimes the specific style a beer is given on this site is decided by anyone who cares to change it. For example; were the overly roasty, bitter flavors intentional to try and re-create the style brewed in the 1700s? Who knows. Either way this is a great beer. Maybe not a 93/100 or 95/100 IMO but none-the-less worth a try if you like porters/stouts and haven't had this yet.","RyanLigeia","Oct 24, 2012"

3.95,-5.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Damn fine looking dark beer with a remarkably deep shade on its head, which is short but dense. Just a pitch black brew here, speaking to no lack of roasted malts. Smells kind of earthy, kind of bready, a touch of caramel sweetness to it, but nothing real roasty about the nose. The nose doesn't lie either, not any roast on the palate either and hey, that's alright, this is a real porter after all, not some stout masquerading as one. Comes on nice and sweet, almost reminiscent of the dark fruit and licorice flavors of big English styles like barleywine or old ale. Definitely a caramel kind of sweetness, but it slides gracefully to the bitter end of the spectrum for the finish, certainly a hops kind of bitterness more than a roast type. Would never have guessed that this has as much booze as it does but for the flavor comparisons to other strong styles. Mouthfeel comes of as kind of thin, very little carbonation but i neither expect or want that out of this beer. The body is alright though, and it resists being too sticky or viscous. As a package, definitely a remarkable example. If someone asks you how a porter is different than a stout, this would be a lovely example for demonstration of the distinction, which I personally claim is the roast malt character being stronger in stouts. There simply isn't another way to categorize this beer - it is a porter, and a profound one at that.","kc44","Apr 04, 2012"

The taste of the beer was almost like charcoal at first. It was burnt tasting and not all the good to me. The aftertaste sort of gave off this odd creamy flavor.

Scent is an attractive blend of roasted matled, notes of dark cocoa, dark fruits (cherry, blackberry) and faint hints of coffee. Taste is quite wonerful - dark roasted and toasted matls give way to bitter dark chocolate and strong dark fruity - almost like eating the best chocolate covered cherry one has ever had. Taste finnished out with notes of coffee, and a light nuttyness. Medium bodied, creamy and smooth, lightly dry on the finnish with some grainyness on the tongue. Quite possibly the best porter in the world - deep and complex, almost stout-like in every way but no issues with excess as it as delecate as it is bold.","rfgetz","May 23, 2011"
4.13,-1,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Sinebrychoff Porter pours a complete black, with just over two fingers of frothy caramel foam topping it off. The head shows some staying power, and there are a fair amount of spots of lacing left sticking to the glass. The nose is a bit muted, but aromas of bitter espresso and anise to come through. Espresso is still the first thing that comes to mind when the beer crashes over my palate, but there's a bit more supporting it. Anise is largely replaced by a touch of dark chocolate and some molasses. In addition there's a certain fruitiness and lactic twang that reminds me of a dry irish stout. The body is impressively rich and creamy for a beer whose flavors come across as so dry, and the carbonation is apppropriately mild, staying out of the way of a malt driven beer. Sinebrychoff Porter both is a true classic and a beer I wouldn't hesitate to give to friends who don't know beer past Guinness.","axeman9182","May 16, 2011"

The taste is very similar, heavy on the roast, molasses, maple syrup, and brown sugar; some burnt biscuits are added, along with some more (though still pretty light) smoke.

The fruitiness and the thinner body makes this decidedly fall into the Baltic Porter category as opposed to a stout, but shares many of the same flavor components. Very delicious brew and goes well with roasted pecans. Make sure to drink this beer at least at 50 degrees, if not warmer, it really opens up nicely.

Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Neither the aroma or flavor are as great as a couple of other Baltic Porters, but this beer is still lovely, complex, and dynamic. Great malt aroma and flavor runs deep into the drinking experience. Notes of espresso, cocoa, and smoke. Hop bitterness seems much higher than others within the style. Alcohol is well disguised and not detected. The body is not as robust as I would of liked but has a nice soft texture. Another of the great Baltic Porters.

The aroma is of roasted malt and oxidized red grapes, similar to an old ale. Some honey and raisin round out the aroma. The taste is of a milk chocolate malt with oxidized grapes, cherries and a tart lemon twang. Me must thinks that this is a bit aged. The roasted malt bitterness stays true throughout this beer. The feel is thick and chewy like a stout, soft carbonation; finishes with a roasted malt bitterness and a sour lemon twang. A very thick and robust baltic porter, right on style. There are some oxidized notes that add a port wine and lemon character. Though it might be old, this has some nice flavors and a big feel.","Gmann","Dec 18, 2009"

I get chocolate, coffee, vanilla and cherry, as well as a hint of licorice as well. There's even a slight hint of tartness to this beer, that I think works very well in countering this beers moderate (at most) sweetness.

The beer pours well and is quite attractive compared to many other porters I have sampled, with generous amounts of lace ringing the glass. Drinkability is probably not quite as good as some other traditional Baltic porters, which I understand are generally lighter in body and sometimes in alcohol content as well, but for a single serving this is quite a brew.

Incredible lacing as the head recedes. Not an overwhelmingly strong smell, there a smoked scent, with maybe a hint of coffee or chocolate. There is a nice mix roasted malts and that chocolate/coffee from the scent. It has an initial ""bite"" of bitterness up front that fades fast.

Some cocoa, caramel, and toffee as well as lots of darker fruits, prunes, plums, a bit port-like. Taste is excellent. There is a big malty sweetness upfront that never totally goes away but is overtaken by over flavors rather quickly. There is a prominent roasted character here that is quite like schwarzbier, not like a stout but more pronounced than the of variants of porter. The dark fruits are again present and play a more prominent role than in the aroma. The like cocoa, caramel, and toffee flavors take a backseat here. Very clean, low-medium hop bitterness, just enough to balance this out. Mouthfeel is pretty good, medium-full body with moderate-ish carbonation and next to no discernible alcohol presence.

Below that is a very slightly astringent oak right prior to the finish. Very complex but just plain balanced all along the way.

Smells of bakers chocolate, dark fruit, and roasty malt. The taste is crazy, in a very good way. Starts roasty, then transitions into bakers chocolate, then the dark fruit kicks in then washed away by a hop bite that dissapears to a coffee but silky flavor.

Had I poured right, the head would be substantial, fluffy and gorgeous tan over an opaque black body. Looks like a stout really. Mouthfeel suffered as well, seeming a bit flat, but I'll chalk that up to the agressive pour. Instead I'll focus on the taste, which was chocolatey and rich but simpler than I expected from this most hallowed of Porters. Doesn't approach the incredible deliciousness of Perkuno's Hammer in my memory, but tasty nonetheless. Finish was just bitter enough to keep me sipping away. Nice.","Folderol","Oct 29, 2007"

Nose is a warm rich malty feel with roasty chocolate notes, hints of toffee and maple are noticeable too. As I take first sip it is as if it had been aged in oak as the wood notes are very present. Mineral malty feel is even and balanced. 7.2% alchol is nowhere in the taste. It is a bit mettalic in flavor in a real old vintage kind of way. Mouthfeel is rather thin and balanced by a slight hop hint that fades fast. This is very bood but maybe a bit past its prime.

4.33,3.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Thanks to Sam's for this suggestion. Chilled and poured out into a nonic, just under one finger of creamy milk chocolate head develops. Lacing is already apparent and retention is decent. Body is black and completely opaque. First sniff is very complex, notes of figs, anise, raison, dirty cocoa, subtle hints of roasted walnuts maybe even coffee, but very faint and only in the back end. Hops are very subdued in the nose, I can detect them faintly, but can not detect which they are for sure. Taste is just as complex and delicious. The flavor is well shaped by bottle conditioning which has made wonderful space for many subtle nuances to become apparent. Roasted malt is more apparent in the flavor than in the smell same with the cocoa. Slightly fruity at first and then quickly taken over by the roasted malts, the subtle bitterness manifests toward the early middle and then again on the finish. The malt and hop balance is very good, its obviously malt forward, but the IBU was obviously not for gotten about. For me it could it could stay where it is, but it would be interesting to taste it 5 points back ward. ABV on is makes it not quite a session beer, but perfect to have two to three during a meal or just one for a snack. Mouth feel is wonderful perfect for the style, lots of complex big flavors, but not over done in the least. This is an excellent food beer as all good porters should be. I just ate some Gruyere with fig jam, great pairing, but obviously this would be great with barbecue or even spareribs. Its taken me a long time to get porters, but now I love them so dearly especially this one. Thank the Elfin lords it is brewed all year round.","mmcave","Jun 14, 2007"

The bottle had no dating system and since in a trade don't know if fresh or cellared. It poured a deep black with mahogany fringes when against the light. It had a good size head that was brown in color. It slowly settled to a collar with no lacing which was surprising. The aroma was roasted malts with dark chocolate aroma as well. Also had a strong sweet smell that I couldn't pin down. The taste was really good and smooth. Since don't know age of bottle not sure if that's the way it is or if it has mellowed over time. Either way it's good. While I enjoyed the taste, for me this is a one per session and maybe once a year beer.

Immediate yeasty tang on the tongue follwed by the chocolatey coffee malts with a nice lasting hop character at the end. Sweet and sour raisens stayed on the tongue long after each sip. Mouthfeel was good, with a heavy brew feel balanced by the moderate carbonation- interesting texture.

Was expecting something a little more complex. I thought it was very full-bodied and very smooth on the mouth. A very drinkable beer, but missing some complexity in the taste.

The taste is at once toasted and sweet, smooth and acidic. Finishes with a mild anise flavor. This is quite mild, but enjoyable. The body is heavy, with fairly low carbonation.

4.48,7.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"What a beautiful beer to pour. It leaves the bottle like oil -- thick, black, and eerily still -- and settles into the glass to form a dark brown head. The brew smells burnt, with a hint of raisins, and a strong stale ale component. I was worried that the sour flavor would overpower the others, but to my delight it is just one part of a complex profile. (That profile is made up of the conventional porter flavors, but they are exceptionally balanced.) The Sinebrychoff Porter is lightly carbonated, with one of the most pleasant, substantial mouthfeels I have ever experienced. I wish I had had more than just dark chocolate to eat with it -- I'm sure other foods would highlight other flavors.","davidshamoon","Sep 27, 2006"

Initial aroma of malty toffee, with hints of chocolate. As beer warmed, alcohol also made its presence known in the aroma. This beer is fdefinitely better as it warms at mid-glass. Finish at first is metallic, but later on is smooth and rich. I hope I can find another of this kind and age.","kimcgolf","Sep 08, 2006"
3.91,-6.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Black with an ultra dark brown sugar colored head which is rather thick and holds a bit but does have rather large bubles. Impressive and a bit unique looking. Aroma is distinctly according to style, german lager kind of aromas--a bit sweet, with gentle grassy hops. Surpsingly, no alcohol aroma detected. The taste is very distinct, a baltic porter but with a very charred and gritty black malt up front--more of the standard stout and charred porter characteristics, and drinking it makes me think a bit of Otter Creek Stovepipe porter. After the upfront charred note it turns into your standard baltic porter with the lager characteristics, the middle and finish standard in flavor, but rather full. Mouthfeel is medium full, not as light as other baltic porters, with good carbonation--well done here. Overall this is very drinkable and no alcohol detected in aroma or flavor. I'm not into this style, but this is a superb version for those who do, if you ignore the price tag.","Liquids","Aug 28, 2006"

It pours as black as a dank imperial stout and has a finger of orangey/brown head. Almost dares you to drink it. Smells of chocolate, coffee, cocoa, roasty malts, currants, blackberries, and otherwise sweet malts. It has a big roasty/burnt flavor with dark berries and lots of IBUs from the green hops and the roasty/coffee malts. In addition, theres sweet and smoky malts, charcoal, tobacco juice, some acidity, old leather, and maybe some piney spice. The body is medium and a bit drying, a little numbing, and leaves a looong roasty/coffee finish. Overall quite nice - would go great with barbecue. However, it's probably better with age as the IBUs are still a bit too prevalent.","mmmbeer","Aug 22, 2006"

The smell is a mixture of a dopplebock-esque and oatmeal. The taste is just great. It hits you first with the creamyness from the oatmeal but follows up with what I can only assume is dark roasted german malts. The alcohol was less prevelant in the 1998 than the 2000.

Taste begins sour, then expands into a delicious chewy chocolate flavor. The finish is bitter and earthy with understated hops and a light smokiness. Medium-thin body, silk-smooth mouthfeel. This can be easily (if not entirely accurately) described as a top-notch Russian Imperial Stout by flavor and a Dry Stout by body and mouthfeel.

Less sweet to the taste than I expected, but big of it's flavor profile. Toasty, roasty, cocoa, and a little camp-fire-ish without being smoky. Powdery and charcoal like to the palate without becomming harsh or burned in flavor or feel. Finishes very, very clean despite a usual grain acceptance. The 7+ alcohols are hardly detectable--neither hot, nor phenolic. Balanced with light hopping and roasted grain. High attenuation leads to a lighter beer, but keeps it's bold flavors.

Mouthfeel is rich and frothy, coating the mouth with fine bubbly carbonation. This is a damn tasty Baltic porter, the most complex and balanced that I've had to date.

Giant rocky chocolate-colored head that soon settles to a good-looking skim of brown bubbles that hangs around for awhile, providing good lacing. Smell and taste combine gentle roasted flavors with a sweet pruney/raisiny character that grows in prominence as the beer warms. Overall, though the flavor is pleasant but subdued, the former perhaps a result of the latter--too much of the dark fruits character can kill me on some Baltics. Also, the Sinebrychoff hides its alcohol immaculately. A big body and smooth, creamy mouthfeel finish off what is a surprisingly easy-drinking ""big"" beer.","battlekow","Oct 09, 2005"

The flavor has an intense roasted character that is a bit astringent and bitter, some unsweetened chocolate, ripe prune and fig, charcoal, and some earthy, organic hops. The is a very interesting beer (reminds me of carnegie porter on steroids), very complex and somewhat bitter and astringent. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected (but true to style), and the drinkability is pretty good with only slight alcohol notes. Excellent traditional baltic porter, has none of the sweet character exhibited by american interpretations but is balanced and complex.","silver0rlead","Oct 05, 2005"

As it warms, there is much more of a fig tone in there, which I really like. Beautiful. The feel is on the low end of thick. Best part of this beer is that there is no hint of the alcohol at all.

Most of the standard English or American porters seem to have a more engaging flavor, off course this could be because the beer is a little old and probably wasn't aged properly.

4.33,3.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Almost black but there seems to be a very dark mahogany influence as well. When I held this beer to a light it didnt allow any penetration of the liquid. Opaque. The head reached two fingers in height and it was a beautiful brunette color. I really liked the head color. The foam slowly faded to a soapy cap, lacing started before I started to remove the liquid. A foamy cap lasted the entire consumption. Overall, the lacing was webby and messy but very prevalent. In my stemmed glass it looked exquisite. The nose was a very lovely mix of dark fruits and roasty qualities. The malt provided hints of chocolate, coffee beans, and some true roast that produced charred wood influences. Oats. Caramel. In the middle is raw alcohol, which is too naked and talkative, unpleasant. The finish recovers nicely and offers some cherries, plums, and prunes. At the very end is a big blast of chocolate that really propels the nose. It ends on a high note! Potency is moderate but expressive, too bad I can clearly hear the cussing from the alcohol. Still the bouquet is inviting, maybe too clean as the nose lacks a symbiotic aura. The palate caught me off guard a little. It had more roast than I was expecting; this is a pleasant surprise! There is a big jolt of roasty qualities that range from char to smoky to woody to espresso to black coffee to chocolate. Each quality shines a little at a time. The espresso and chocolate are the loudest. Astringent. Bitter. Fruit in the middle, largely dark and tropical, cherries and plums mainly. Then follows some sweetness. It strikes with perfect timing. Caramel. Brown sugar. Milk chocolate. Oats. Im really digging this! At the finish is the alcohol, kind of raw, too naked, too hot but it doesnt ruin the beer, it does stop it from being truly remarkable. The palate is very charming. Long, bitter yet sweet aftertaste with lots of coffee influences, dry with earthy hops. Damn, this is good! The alcohol is noticed, yes, but it doesnt play itself, I mean, it doesnt seem like a beer with a 7+ abv. It drinks like a much smaller beer, and that could be dangerous! In other words, this is one hell of a drinkable beer. Worthy of my 850th review here on BA. Medium in body, a tickle thin it seems, the carbonation is very light, too light IMO and this produces a slick mouthfeel. Id like a little more bulk but there is nothing inherently wrong with the mouthfeel. It is pleasant. My bottle is over a year past its best by date, couldve fooled me! This is a really good beer and Im glad I can buy it in Iowa. This bottle was purchased in Minnesota, MN. I should have bought more. As good as it is, when I drink this again it will be standalone, no cheese here please. This bad boy is flying solo. This is a great Baltic Porter. Seek it out. Enjoy it. Recommended.","bditty187","Nov 17, 2004"
4.01,-3.8,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Cap comes off with a loud, rushing pop. No wonder this pours with a nice inch-and-a-half-deep head of miniscule, dark tan bubbles. Beer is black--not black hole black, but matte black. Head clings foamily and laces well. Gah, it really clings! in keeping with the sluggish viscosity of the brew. Aromas of carbonized chocolate, burned Milk Duds, cigar ash. Finishes with a touch of sulfur--not eggy sulfur, but matchstick sulfur. Polished nosefeel seems on the light side in body... I wanted it to lay it on me heavier. For an instant, the sweetness of over-dried prune skins hovers at the tip of the tongue, before plunging into oily poppyseed depths. Charred wood, coffee grounds, and raw cocoa float around in the gloom. Finishes with smoldering hop stalks, hash resin, and residual carbons in a surprisingly even aftertaste. Slightly greasy mouthfeel with no detectable carbonation seems to gain sludginess as it decends from mouth to belly. Drinkability is better than I expected; I could semi-gulp this despite the heavy flavor, but it would probably kick my ass in due fashion. Don't forget this beer on your next trip to the tundra.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Nov 10, 2004"

4.85,16.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"I was lucky enough to find a vintage 1997 bottle of this stuff at Spirit Haus in Amherst, MA, great store by the way. Dark velvet black appearance, with a slight brown head. Beauty in a glass. Smells strongly of port wine, bitter chocolate, dried fruit and coffee grounds, with faint wisps of alcohol. Taste is out of this world gorgeous. Port wine sweetness up front with lots of fruity complexity. Figs, dried fruit, and raisins all come to mind. Chocolate and coffee flavors also swirl themselves around in this brew. Roasted malt is big in this beer, yet floral hops and all of the wonderful complex flavors of this beer balance everything out very well. It feels like I'm drinking black silk. Not thick at all like some porters. A very thin consistency makes for incredible smoothness, and makes it surprising that this beer is as flavorful as it is. A real treat to drink. I don't think I've ever raved as much about a beer, but this brew is so fantastic that it warrants such raving. This is one every beer enthusiast should seek out because it is such a unique gem.

4.41,5.8,5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a deep dark brown color, almost black with a bubbly firm offwhite/chocolate head that is just simply beautiful. After a couple minutes a nice lace is left behind after the head recedes. Aromas are slighty roasty, with a bit of bread, and a sweet characteristic to it near the realm of molasses or a bittersweet cocoa. For flavor this brew starts off slightly roasty with just a nice hint of dark fruits. Following there is a light sweetness, then a change towards a more malty bread like flavor, almost biscuity. Afterwards there is a nice rounded coffee flavor which is followed by a slight molasses. The finish of this beer is slighty bitter, with a firm roasty balance. The body of this brew is gorgeous, almost chewy and fully complex. The carbonation is light, but there is no need for any more than is provided due to the amazing flavor. Overall if you like Baltic Porters (or even just regular porters) this beer is clearly the king.","bigbeerdrinka","Oct 29, 2004"

Bitterness is very slight, and the flavor really exudes a nice balance of the ingredients. Immensely quaffable, and really enjoyable. The high abv is hidden wonderfully.

4.33,3.8,4.5,4,4.5,5,4,"Bottle at the Moan and Dove. Tar like pour. Thin tan head fades quickly, but it remains dark as night. Powerful malty aroma, lots of dates and grapes character, but also a considerable chocolate cake portion and this huge roasted malt, flakey counterpart. Great balance, awe-inspiring alcohol dissimulation. Intense palate starts with big dates and anise maltiness. It quickly lets room to an extreme roasty finish, very long.. like 2 parts roasted licorice and 1 part cereals. The sweetness fades out in total control. Acidity level is maintained very low. How much dark malt could they fit into a 12oz? A lot of things going on. Complexity is not disturbed by the great thick airy body. Thick enough that the high carbonation appears just smooth and creamy. It feels like theyve brewed it with oatmeal.","Rastacouere","Oct 12, 2004"
4.6,10.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a nice deep, dark, sanguineous black, with a minimal head. A very nice coffee and licorice aroma wafts from this beer, with some undertones of currant or some other dark fruit. It's not a really overwhelming smell, just a nice, subtle aroma. This thing tastes just awesome. It is good when chilled, but becomes leaps and bounds better as it warms. The flavor consists of licorice, chocolate, sarsparilla, and toffee up front, which progresses to a roasty coffee bitterness combined with a very flavorful hops profile. The finish is dry and surprisingly refreshing. The mouthfeel seems a tad thin to start, but again, it becomes richer and fuller as the beer warms. The real kicker to this beauty is that its 7% ABV is so well hidden. I real feel like this would make as good a session beer as any I've ever head, except I'd be stupified after three. This is superb, and the best example of this style I've come across. I feel like it shares quite a bit with Anchor Porter in flavor, but steps up to the plate where that beer falls short. Completely deserving of its rating.","bultrey","Oct 07, 2004"

Chocolate malt grips your tongue and does not let go until well into the aftertaste. The first few sips were almost overwhelming due to the strength of the malty background. This is definitely not what I was expecting, as I expected something a little less potent.

The aroma is a rich mix of chocolate, roasted, coffee, and vinous notes. The palate, like the aroma, is quite rich. Carmel and molasses sweetness is noticeable up front, with lots of dry roastiness a hint of chocolate later on. Some slight hints of fruitiness are also noticeable. The finish is a mix of bitter roasted notes and hops that linger for a while. The mouthfeel is medium with not too much carbonation. The vinous notes that were quite noticeable on the nose are very slight on the palate. This was a great porter that I enjoyed very much. Ill definitely look for this one again.","byrd","Oct 21, 2003"

Seemed like a steal at $2.99/bottle. This beer seems to have every flavor possible in it. Wow. I don't know what to say. Malt bitterness at the start. Chocolate and coffee mix together to smoothen it out. Malty sweetness comes along. I notice some fruity flavors, even some vinous flavors. It seems as if a hoppier bitterness is there towards the end, but I'm not completely sure. Finishes with more chocolate/coffee sweetness. Excellent.","granger10","Jul 22, 2003"

4.38,5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Its black body reveals a brilliant ruby highlight at the base of the glass when held to the light. It's clear; but tiny particles of sediment are noticeable resting at the base. The thick and creamy dark-tan head holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace throughout most of the glass. Sweetish dark caramel and a mild note of fruit greet you in the nose. With a little investigation it reveals some cocoa and a mild roastiness. The body is medium and it's smooth and oily across the palate with a fine carbonation that lightly caresses the tongue. The flavor, however, comes on strong with lots of roastiness, deep caramel, chocolate, alcohol and a swirl of fruitiness. It's initially sweet, but the solid bitterness (50 IBU's) kicks in at the swallow. It finishes surprisingly dry with more bitterness than the style normally offers, and a wash of alcohol; lingering with notes of cocoa, prunes, dark caramel, molasses, bittersweet chocolate, dull roastiness, and some ""spent hop"" flavor. From the start to the finish it's quite a complex ride for the senses. Most impressive!","NeroFiddled","Jul 11, 2003"

A bowl of mixed fresh and roasted berries drizzled in dark chocolate with a dollop of hazelnut cream might be enough words to try and describe the hearty aromas oozing from this charmer. Soft coal snatches your buds by the roots initially, but is quickly steamrolled by dark roasted coffee beans that get all red currant tart and dry and chummy with a handful of greasy hops. Coats the mouth like whipped wet fudge. A serious fireside session brew, big enough to sate, but small enough to crack another.","inebrius","Apr 07, 2003"

Unlike other reviewers, I did not obtain much head, but I must admit the beer was served a bit cooler (38F) than I prefer. A little warmer might have generated a better bed of foam. This is a very intense beer, with coffee/molasses/burnt flavors initially vying for your attention before succumbing to a lingering hop aftertaste. This stuff is silky-smooth, and begs for drinking, but it definitely it is not a session beer. ""Easy does it"" is certainly in order here.","Ueberales","Dec 29, 2002"

Toasted grain, caramel, light hints of coffee, and a bit earthy to boot, quite a nice nose. Start is ambrosial and the top heavy in its feel, with the finish passably acidic, the hops potent in their spicy bite, dry lingering aftertaste and quite a decent and Robust porter in my book.","Gusler","Dec 24, 2002"

The mouthfeel was full and chewy but creamy. The flavor was nice and lingered a while in the mouth. Low carbonation. This bottle was very drinkable!

Somewhat abrasive on the tongue, but manages to be velvety too, in the manner of porters. Big roasted malt flavor, traces of coffee, grains and herbs. Very light hoppiness, some bitterness a la bitter chocolate, but majority of flavor is sweet. A beer that is both daunting and tempting. I am guessing this sample is old, since flavors are mellowed, muted, almost shimmering. Nothing prototypically Finnish except perhaps a very light trace of liquorice. Alcohol is notable but not overpowering, and finish is not too lasting. A classic.","Thrasher","Dec 05, 2002"

Dark caramel malt sweetness dominates the aroma initially, but a bittersweet combination of deeply roasted malt & carob ensues. There's a hint of fusels in aroma as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is viscous, rich, borderlining on being oily and thus adds to the richness if this brew. Assertive sweetness hits the palette at first, but mellow and clean chocloate malt & heavily caramelized flavors follow. Hop bitterness doesn't assert itself until the enjoyable bittersweet finish which is akin to dark chocolate. Although sweet overall, there's sufficient complexity in Sinebrychoff Porter to make it a highly enjoyable beer.","marc77","Jun 21, 2002"

It is hard to take in all at once, sip after sip revealing something new. Next time this one comes around I am definitely getting extras(the distributor only had 16 bottles). My only complaint was the head didnt last long. It aged AMAZINGLY well, the young version is a tad astringent but that seems to go away with age.
