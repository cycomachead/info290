"Overall - I really like this.  Very nice smoke and chocolate combination."
"BLACK brew, solid tan head. Smells of smoky malts not unlike a campfire. More liquid smoke flavor. Good lager base is not overly objectionable. Mellower than other smoky beers"

""
""
"On tap."
""

""

"Thin, overly smokey, dark, tastes like liquid smoke."
""
""

"I haven't had Smoke in several years, but this is far better than I remember. Maybe age has toned it down or maybe my memory is hazy. Either way, this is an excellently balanced beer. Still hot, but not overly smoky like a number of similar beers out there. Excellent base Baltic Porter. Worth a try."

"D:  I found this to be a very tasty Dark Lager and would definitely have again.  Extremely subtle use of the smoked malts here however.  Actually had me wanting for more intensity.  I mean why else would you wax the bottle.  For those who may have shied away from this one should not fear the Smoke."

"Smoke pours a black color with a nice lacing tan head. There is a strong smokey aroma; much like a smoked meat. The taste has a nice mellow, but pronounced smokey flavor, very meaty flavors. The body feels a little watery, but a nice warmth. Overall its a nice easy drinking smoking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Overall quite surprised loved the smoke aroma and flavor."
""

"O: Great smoked porter. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the pleasure of smoke flavor in their food or drink. Quite enjoyable."

"o - This is a darn good Raucbier! It really hides the 8% alcohol, which could be dangerous in a bomber. I'm glad I gave it a chance beyond the first sip...each sip has been better than the last!"

"Deep, dark cola brown pour with khaki head. Nose is a nice mix of salty smoke and sweet cherry-type smoke along with refined roast malt, cocoa powder, and faint fruit esters. Flavor is a gentle salty/sweet smoke mix, bittersweet chocolate, soft roasted malt, and some mild dark fruit. Lingering bittersweet chocolate, and to a lesser extent, charcoal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-I wasn't enamored with this beer. Over the top smokiness. I was expecting a bit more diversity in the flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body with carbonation of medium-low to low intensity, resulting in a smooth (4/5), somewhat foamy (1/5) mouthfeel that makes it easy to sip this fairly substantial beer, as it should be. Ethanol can be felt as a light burn on the back of the throat and a little heat in the nostrils, a bit disappointing for an 8% lager beer. Closes dry, with medium to medium-light stickiness clinging to the palate."
"A great smoked beer. The smoke doesn't dominate and gives all the other layers a chance to shine."

"Judgement - Absolutely worth a try and if smoked porters are your thing, pick up a few."
""
"Low B+"
""
""
""
"O- I had a bad experience with a smoked beer from a macro brew so I came in skeptical....but again Surly shows why they're the pride of Minnesota Breweries. A smoke beer that can be completely miss handled and they are able to balance the smokiness with the rich flavors of raisen, fig, licorice, and that slight molasses sweetness.I recommend you let this beer begin to warm before you are really able to enjoy the full flavor experience of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown almost black with a fairly agressive brown head. Roast, dark chocolate, and light smoke on the nose. Really balanced beer. Tastes primarily of roasted espresso and dark chocolate. Smoke level is minimal and actually helps round/sweeten the beer a bit. The base is very well made and has the exact lager mouthfeel that a baltic porter should."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Having had both the fresh and aged version of Smoke it's hard to say which one was more enjoyable. The solution would be to buy two bottles every year for further drinking--analysis. Would I drink it again? Yes, I've never understood how this beer does not garner the same reputation as Surly's other seasonal releases."

"I was happy with this beer, though it is one I only wanted a bit of and not often. I would love to see this in smaller bottles so that I didn't feel like I wasted so much of something that had such a complex tone to it, overall. It was sippable, not drinkable. Smoke was a beer I will keep an eye out for in the future. As for the rest of the bottle? It just got used to make some beef jerky. Yep, I said it. Stay tuned for that post next week. Never let a good beer go to waste."

"O: Tasty baltic porter for sure. Given the age, the smokiness is not bad at all. Instead of being at the forefront it's more of a complementary flavor, adding a layer of complexity. One of the best ""smoked"" beers I've ever had and a delicious baltic porter to begin with. Well integrated and balanced flavors leads to a very tasty and drinkable beer."

"i wasn't sure what to expect from SMOKE.. after having a few smoked beers from jester king lately, i thought it would be something like that (a light colored beer).. i'd compare it to stone's smoked porter in style, but it's nothing like that either.. think of it as a smoked stout almost, just my two cents."

"I'm not sure why this is categorized as a baltic porter instead of a rauchbier but either way, its a strange but ultimately, pretty pleasant and very interesting offering from Surly. Smokiness is balanced nicely by the chocolate and maple/molasses sweetness. I'm glad I got around to this one. Worth trying."

"Overall. A good smoked porter that didn't go crazy on the smoke like so many smoked beers do. I appreciate that and am enjoying this beer. Thanks Ryan (Okay, he's actually a great guy)."

"A pretty strong brew though right for the style....the alcohol, imho, is hidden pretty well. A very good beer."
""
"O- not bad, not bad at all...just not a very mainstream style"
""
""
"O - Purely awesome if you love smoked beer &/or scotch."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A really nice beer, balances the smoky and sweet flavors, which are tasty and complex, the smoke can become a bit strong though so this is probably a beer to be split with friends."
""
""
"O-Excellent smoked beer, very complex and a delight to taste, yet altogether very drinkable and balanced,would gladly have another. Don't know how true this beer is to the Baltic porter style, I think its really in its own category or should be in some specialty hybrid category of smoked beers."
""
""
"O: good take on a Baltic Porter wow"
"Pours a dark brown...almost black (amber when held up to light)... almost clear. Large tan head that goes down quickly. Scent is VERY smokey. Nice chocolate aroma with some mellow charcoal and burnt malt. Nice smoked meat aroma. Taste is coffee at first, then the smoke comes in. This beer tastes like a more rich, chocolatey Schlenkerla. VERY tasty. Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a great finish. Drinkability is VERY high, especially for 8.20%! Overall, one of the best smoked beers I've ever had."

"very interesting and deep flavor. boozy, and feels it. I hold surly to a high standard and this didn't disappoint"
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
""
"O Not a bad porter. I'm assuming drinking it fresh would be much more enjoyable for me. Smoke was over the top for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- good smoke beer. Fairly one dimension but you do get some roast, chocolate, etc from the porter as well."
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a very good smoked beer to drink for a long time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An interesting combo of lager and stout. An all-day sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pairs well with ghost pepper cheese, I think. If they sold this in 4 pack cans...that would be awesome!!! Thanks Elliott."

"A very nice beer that made Elaine's home-made pulled pork sandwiches even better!"
""
""
"It's called Smoke, so I expected that, but I was hoping for more, especially from the smell. A woody smoke, not meaty or salty. Want more porter, though. More richness, or more sweetness, or more of something other than smoke. An interesting beer, but not one I'll feel compelled to drink all that often."
""
""
""
"Overall: I don't remember this being so smoky. Regardless, it's tasty. Surly crafts some aggressive, yet drinkable stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an extremely unique beer. Not my favorite beer from Surly but it definitely showcases their creative potential."
"O: 3.5"
"Overall this was a beer that grew on me as I sipped. I think I started this one out too warm and the smoke flavors were a bit much. As it warmed up it really mellowed out and everything blended together. Todd from Surly really knows what he is doing and keeps putting out style defying and expertly crafted beers. Recommended to any fan of dark, malty beers, or any BA looking to try something one-of-a-kind. Cheers!"
""
""

""

"Extremely smooth and creamy mouthfeel, with a signficant and controlled smokey taste, with the porter complexty behind it.Great smoked, although not as bold tasting a baltic porter as I would expect. The beer is really a cross between the two. Smoke aroma."
"Fortunately the taste isn't smoke-forward. Mildly smokey, but tons of roast and malt are at the forefront. Thin-ish body still works given the lower carbonation. I really like this."
"O: A tasty beer overall with an odd, but tasty, mix of flavors and aromas. Really enjoyable and super smokey."
""
"Nice smokey baltic porter, big flavor and powerful body."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one terrific beer...The aromas were heavenly and this was a real pleasure to drink... A very good effort from Surly..."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer jet black with big notes of bacon, smoke and charcoal. It would be excellent with BBQ. For a baltic porter some of the nuance of the style is lost in the smoke, but it's still super smooth and drinkable. The aftertaste is a slightly bitter chocolate. Very drinkable beer, but something is slightly off in the follow through."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty much as good as I'd hoped for. Surly brews some damn terrific beers and this is no exception. I've had Baltics with lots of sweetness or loads of spice, but never one so savory. And I'll be savoring memories of this for a while. Its complexities (and subtleties) make it a joy to sip and one I'd very much like to have again. Thanks, Anthony!"
""
""
""
"O: Very impressed. Very drinkable, no sign of the abv at all. Perfect level of smoke."
""
"Overall: Surly makes fantastic dark beers. Surly Four is my favorite beer from this brewery and Surly Smoke is not far behind it. This beer is also probably the best baltic porter and the best smoked beer that I have ever drank! Bravo Surly; you guys nailed this beer!"
""
"O - I'm always a little leery of smoked beers, and the smell had me a bit concerned that this would be one dimensional, but the flavors here are wonderful and balanced. Excellent brew."
""
""
""
"Pours black in color with a small, chocolaty head. Nose is chcoloate malts enveloped by a rich smokiness. Taste is true to the nose. Starts off with a nice chocolate malt profile that ha a touch of grains. This moves into a deeper, richer chocolate flavor that is really nice. Next up is a nice touch of smokey meatiness (more smoke than meat). Finishes with lingering meats. Mouth is full bodied with good carbonation. This is a solid, solid beer. Takes rauchbier to a nice level, as the smoke is in the background, not the forefront, complementing rather than dominating the pallet. One of the better in the Surly lineup, IMO."
""
"The tingle left in mouth is like a comforting flannel shirt. Definitely unique."
""
"O: Pretty good, could have gone higher as I liked it but I'll stick with a 4. Thanks a ton Aaron!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Too much smoke, salt and meat."
"Overall though this is really delicious. If they somehow get the novocaine action nixed or controlled this beer would be a serious winner. Very different and unique brew, and the beer has that one lacking character that many don't have, it's just flat out fun."
""
""
"O: I like it, it only took three years to get a bottle after a little bit of effort but it is definitely enjoyable."
""
"Overall: I thought this was a very nice beer. Not overly sweet or smokey, yet all the promised flavors were there. Very tasteful."
""
""
"definatly one of my favorite baltic porters and quite possibly my favorite smoked beer as of now. lots of in your face smoke, which i really enjoy, while still staying somewhat in balance. gotta give it to surly, they dont know how to make a bad beer."
""
""
"O- I'm a big Baltic porter fan so I've had this on my list for a while, but since I'm not a rauchbier guy I was a bit hesitant. I think this brew does a good job showcasing smoked malts while still leaving a bit of flavor to be discovered. Not sure how it intense it is fresh, but at a little over a year it seems perfect for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"D-Overall this beer was good.. ME and my friend made homemade bacon mugs so i think that might of distracted me a little and gave the beer a little more of a cured meat flavor but i think it might have also made it taste a little better. But in my notes i tried to taste it and ignore the bacon. Overall i thought this was a nice baltic porter. Had just enough smokiness but didn't overpower it. Def. give this a try if you can.. I wouldn't pick this up right away if i saw it again but then again i might."
""
""
"O - I found myself wanting more, but again I was subject to a limited supply of 1. At $20 a bomber this is a tad pricey, and although it was tasty and memorable I would reserve it for special occasions. A dangerously drinkable and full flavoured ale indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- tasty smokey porter"
""
""
"4, 4, 4, 4, 4"
"O-another really impressive beer by Surly. Very unique and delectable. As far as smoked beers go you probably can't find a better example. World class."
""
""
""
"Hands down this is the best rauchbier I've tried. The flavors are flawlessly integrated. Smoke, roast, chocolate, bacon and oak. I couldn't think of a better beer with which to sit around the campfire on a cool fall evening."
""
""
"O - I'm amazed at how they made such a strong smoky aroma but a milder smoke taste. Delicious!"
""
""
"O: This is a good one to open with a group. Definately a sipper, a great change of pace from what I gravitate to. Got another bottle I am aging and may pick up a couple more to rest to see what evolves from this."
"O: This is a seriously good baltic porter. If you love smoky beers and/or you love bacon, this beer is for you. I'm sincerely impressed. I don't remember it being this bacon-y the last time I had it. I'll have to crack a 2010 bottle to see how it's changed."
""
""
""
"O- A good smokey beer that balances the smokeyness with the other flavors. Worth a try."
""
""
""
"This is the first and only 'smoked' beer I've had. 'Drinking a campfire' was what came to mind immediately. Smelled like a campfire. I thought the wife would smell my clothes and ask where I was after I drank this. Very immersive experience that made me want to go out and make some smores. I can't say I was crazy about the taste overall, but man, the great smell, great smooth mouthfeel really made it a nice."
""
""
""
"O - I usually avoid surly because all their beers are incredibly expensive (I'm in MN, and usually it's at least $18/4pk). I also have not had many 'smoked' beers, but this brew is very nicely balanced so that the smoky flavors are not overpowering. It works very well considering the base beer is a baltic porter. Recommended."

"750 ml wax dipped bottle, 2011 vintage. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that went away quickly. There's a very small amount of lacing left on the glass. The brew smells like smoked and roasted malt, peat, coffee, and a bit of chocolate. It tastes like smoked malt/meats, burnt/charred malt, coffee, and some dark fruit and chocolate. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a little creamy and slick with low/moderate carbonation. I think this is a pretty good brew overall, I'd definitely buy this again in the future."
""
"O- Surly struck a balance of richness and brightness that is fantastic. There are some thing lingering in there, a complexity that my less experienced palette can quite put a name to."
"Roasted, toasted malt up front. Light coffee bitterness is there as well. Palate soon swells with a mix of sweet and smoky. Smoked meats, campfire, and peat blend nicely with caramel, dark fruits, and chocolate. Long finish with lingering smoke and chocolate-caramel. Roasted bitterness is there is well. Medium-full body with a chewy, yet creamy feel. Delicious!"
"O: I need to try this one fresh, but this year old bottle was pretty darn tasty. It was just so smooth. An A- grade for me."
""
""
""
""
"im looking forward to seeing how this ages over a year or two. a complex beer like this should change a lot!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good winter beer. If you like smoky beers with a big smoke flavor, this is the beer for you. A sipping beer for sure, but a ton of smoke and malt to bring big flavor with every sip. I appreciate this beer for what it is, and would drink it again if it was available and I was in the mood for a 'smoke'."

"O: Man, this rounds out my Surly box from my Minnesota homeboy olympuszymurgus and there wasn't a mediocre bottle in the box. They were all extremely delicious and this one is no exception. I don't know if you are supposed to age a Baltic and I don't know what it drinks like fresh, but this is a wonderful beer with a year on it. Very smooth, very balanced, lots of flavors mixing in and blending nicely."
""
""
"Sweet, smooth, mild smoke, a little dry, very nice. Maybe I'm warming to the whole smoke beer thing but this one is really nice. I like it. Great finish. I would have this again."
""
""
""
""
"O- A really nice beer, worth seeking out. Definitely would trade for another bottle or two."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a 1/2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of smoked malt and maybe some caramel and cocoa notes. Taste is of smoked malt up front with some dark fruits and cocoa powder on the finish. A smoky, roasted bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good smoked baltic porter from Surly. The smoke aroma is somewhat dominant but the smoke flavors compliment the other tastes in the beer very well."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Very easy drinking with a well rounded base of flavoring. The alcohol is perfectly integrated in this brew which makes it dangerously drinkable. The finish is fairly crisp with a lingering smoked and chocolate aspect. A very fine example that is quite enjoyable. I wouldn't mind having a couple bottles of this."
"I dig this beer and am thankful for the opportunity. A beer that's been shared on multiple occasions and often with non beer geeks and always ends up a crowd favorite. Not an easy task Surly, so well played."
"Procured in a trade, but can't remember from who. 750ml capped bottle coated with silver wax. Served in my Allagash chalice. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a half inch, khaki-colored head embedded with tiny ringlets that eventually dissipates into a soapy skim. Exceptional nose on this brew - smoky, dark fruits (figs and dates) as well as an earthy quality and grape and bubblegum notes. Taste follows nose; however, much more smokey than suggested by the nose. Chocolate and roast are also revealed in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light in consistency, perhaps a little thin for the style, with a lively carbonation and a slightly oily texture. This is definitely one of my favorite Baltic Porters. Not only is it delicious, but there is great complexity to this brew. Another top notch offering from Surly."
"O: This was a very interesting brew. I wish there were some other flavors that could popped up, but the smokiness really took over and dominated. I guess that's why they call it Smoke."
"Drink- Not my cup of tea. I can handle a Baltic Porter but this was a bit unbalanced and just too roasted and peat like."
"O: Winner, Winner BBQ diner. Great with BBQ ribs. Another great style by none other than Surly."
"O - Weird, but I kinda like it."
"Nice Baltic and smoked beer alike."
"Drink 'em if you got 'em, it's going fast."
"O: From what I've heard, this is better fresh so I'm a little bummed that I've sat on this for so long. Oh well, Smoke is still a pretty enjoyable beer at this point."
"O- Very good. Smoke dominates, which it should. I do wish the porter base would have stood out a bit more though."
"This is by far one of the top beers I have ever had! It is amazingly smooth and easy to drink. The flavors are bold, but also complex. It's not a one sided smoke flavor like often what happens with Porters. The tastes changes and matures in your mouth. I look forward to having this beer again and again."
"O - Another fantastic beer from Surly. I've had it a few times on draft and in bottles, and this bottle (from the first 2010 bottling in March) really stood out. Wish I had some more. Cheers to Todd and Omar,"
"Surly Smoke is a one-of-a-kind beer. Who else brews a smoked porter with lager yeast? The end result is brilliance! Never have I had a smoked porter with such a smooth mouthfeel. Usually, the smokey malts work with the smoked malts to give a super smokey smoked smorgasboard. Is that too much of a mouthful? Yes! Yet Surly brillianltly uses the subtle workings of lager yeast to mellow out the overwhelming smoked malts. End result is an entirely too-quaffable brew that I wish I had more of. Certainly there is smoke in the nose and on the tongue but good gosh, it is not at all bitter. In fact, there is a light sweetness that plays nicely against the smoke. Kudos to Surly for setting my new standard for smoked beer."
"Had the 2011 batch fresh and Im really impressed with it. More balanced, love the wood/oak characteristics that come out. Roasted malt, coffee, cocoa. Do not age this beer. Fresh is much better than the previous bottle I had which was aged for a while."
"o- overall this beer is phenomenal and met my expectations. this is my new gold standard for Baltic porters. would love to have it again"
"Overall: I liked this beer a lot. Many beers that try to make a smoked beer are afraid of blasting the other flavors out. Surly blasts the smoke, yet also puts out enough other flavors to help compete and get accentuated in good ways by the smoke."
"Overall: A very good porter that is complex and very tasty. The smoke is tame enough to notice the many flavors going on here. Another great Surly brew."
"Overall I really like this. Been craving some smoke and this is doing the job. Surly hits another one out of the park for me."
"D - Fairly drinkable, especially considering how bold the flavors are, but that is just how smooth it is. The smoke flavor is really strong and fits right in with the beer."
"Overall, this is my first offering from Surly and I cant wait to explore more of them through trades and beer fests."
"Smoke gets sweeter as it goes and I would prefer a lasting smokiness. As it warms, though, this beer does a fine job."
"This beer was well worth the wait and I am so glad that I have another bottle. Smoked Porters are quickly becoming one of my favorite styles. Please, Surly, keep doing what you do. This beer is smokey but not overboard, with some wonderful complexities beneath the plume of smoke."
"O: Great beer. Reminded me of coffee bender if it was smoked though. Very easy to drink and perfect by the bon fire. Would drink this again if I could get my hands on it."
"Pours a nice dark brown. Vry thick but still clear on the edges. Smells potently of smoke. Incredibly smoky... Wow. Tastes sweet and malty off the get go. Tons and tons of smoke on the back. Vry nicely potent. Not so much that it's unbearable. Solid mouthfeel and pretty interesting overall"
"o-good beer and I'm glad I got to try it. Good breakfast beer"
"d - Overall this is a very good smoked Baltic Porter. I don't think smoked beers or Baltic Porters in general blow my mind, but this is a very good one. Great mouthfeel, and glad I have anough bottle of it."
"I did not go into this expecting Smoke to be a real enjoyable beer since I'm not a huge smoke guy. I left wanting more bottles. In my opinion just about the perfect smoked beer. Surly amazes me again. I want to move to MN just for Surly. You guys rock."
"O- Pretty delicious, smooth, and totally unique. I wish I had picked up another bottle to put away for longer. If one ever gets a chance to try the Mole Smoke it is a supreme beer, which I also highly recommend."
"Given its name, Smoke isn't really as smoky as I expected. Still, it's got some very nice flavors that are incredibly well-integrated. It's a smooth drink, for sure."
"D- Very easy to drink. A bit of a sipper too. I'll look for this one again."
"Drink is decent, no real booze effect, just a very slight hint of warming booze, smooth and creamy, a bit dry."
"D - Decent stuff. I enjoy porters quite a bit but this one was just too smokey to really enjoy. I could drink one of these but that is about it."
"Sure it is drinkable, but I have had many better smoked offerings. Worth a try but not worth the hype."
"Drinkability: The smoke does not dominate, which I appreciated. Overall this is another solid beer from a great brewery. I do not tend to go after the smoked beers, but I enjoyed this one."
"smoke is a beer i whould love to grab three or four bottels and let them age a bit and see what happens, also this make a great beer to add to my special occ stach."
"With no alcohol in taste, there is a slight warming effect that comes from smoke. Slightly chewy with a big edium feel and ample carb. Thanks for the bottle ogl, this one was a treat."
"D- Moderately high. I am impressed. Tasty stuff... Didn't have it fresh but time seemed to be kind to it. My first special release Surly and it was a joy to drink."
"Pretty good. I can polish off one of the 750ml bottles in a sitting and be pretty happy. I don't know if I'd be likely to get it at a bar, but I really like it as kind of a ""staying in for the night"" kind of drink."
"D- this is a really cool twist on this style. The smoke blends wonderfully with the sweetness and the slow warming in the belly make ya feel just right. Another great beer from what look more and more to be one of my favorite breweries."
"Overall: This is easily one of the best (if not THE best) Baltic porter I have ever had. The smokiness may seem like a gimmick, but it is really not; the beer is genuinely solid."
"Pours jet black with but not completely opaque with a tan head that disappears over time. Smells very similar to chocolate stouts with lots of chocolate and molasses as well as some subtle smoke. The taste is of more chocolate and molasses and then the smoke comes. Similar to Weyerbacher Fifteen but much creamier. However, after sipping on it for 10-15 minutes, the smoked bacon taste starts to take over a bit much for me. This beer is so creamy and delicious but starts to become a little too sweet and smokey for my liking. I really loved it at first, and by the end I had grown tired of it. Still a great and different beer that I would recommend trying."
"D: Excellent drinkability, especially for style. Too often the smoke--even if not overpowering at first--eventually becomes too much. Not so here. An excellent representation of a rauchbier (drinks more like this than a baltic porter). The 8.2% ABV is imperceptible...magic. Surly strikes again!"
"Overall: What a great presentation with the red wax on the bottle. Cool graphics on the bottle as well. Overall this is a fantastic brew. I think I found a brewery whose beers I'll be be making a serious effort to search out."
"I haven't been all that impressed by Smoke the 2 times I have had it on tap while drinking other beers. But this bottle really surprised me. Smooth, tasty, and very drinkable for the abv."
"Body is a little thinnish, with the carbonation coming on a little strong up front and finishing too light. The roasted, smoky notes linger too long for the next drinkability score. Thanks to the sis for this birthday present; looking forward to next year's Surly!"

"I'm glad to have had this opportunity to taste Smoke (thanks feloniousmonk), even if it's clearly not the beer that it once was. I would be even more glad to have the chance to taste it fresh and on-tap. Here's hoping that wish comes true sometime in the next several years."
"D: Despite being pretty smokey, I actually thought this was good and had enough other flavors going on."
"Big thanks to largadeer for sharing this one after the Bruery RS Post-Party. Served from bottle into a Bruery sampler imperial pint. Poured pitch black with a very minimal slight tan head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, and smoke. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoke, caramel, and chipotle. It had a medium feel on the palate with no carbonation to speak of. Overall this was a pretty good brew. MASSIVE smoke going on here (as would be suggested by the name). Even with this fact, it was still pretty nicely balanced. This is a must try if you get an opportunity."
"Poured a dark brown in color with brown highlights that had a half finger of head a left a decent amount of lacing sticking to the glass. It had a very nice smoke aroma upfront but had roasty character, mild chocolate, faint caramel and slight chipotle pepper notes. The roasted character and chocolate flavors were more apparent on the palate with caramel smokey accents with a touch of chipotle peppers whicxh added a little zing in the back of the throat. The brew was medium to full in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a smokey, roasty, subtle sweet, and slight spicey finish. I really like my smokey beers and this one is no exception. Tasted great drank great and had exactly what I like out of a smokey brew."
"D: For a rich, smoky beer this is so drinkable"
"Very good Beer. Nice bottle. Will keep for display."
"Fuller medium body, lighter carbonation, creamy and pleasant on the tongue. Drinks faster than it should, the ABV is masked well and the smoke is much lighter than many other simpler beers."
"This is a beer that I've heard a lot about and since I like smoke in dark beers this is one of my more preferred styles. The beer pours a beautiful darkness topped by a finger of tan foam. The smell is mostly smoke with perhaps a bit of chocolate, though there is so much smoke it's hard to tell. The flavor is thankfully toned down on the smoke to the point of near perfection. There is also a malty sweetness that comes through to help complement the smoke that is on the palate. The beer finishes a tad too bitter for my liking, but drinks pretty smooth for the other portions. This is a really enjoyable beer."
"Gift from #2. Thanks Eric."
"Drinkability: What an amazing and pleasant surprise! An evening that started with one disappointment (Tuverbol) is capped by one fantastic brew, and I couldn't be more thrilled. This beer is just so balanced, so flavorful, and - all things told, at 8.2% - so drinkable (not to say it's not there - I'm certainly feeling it!). Nonetheless, I want more of this, and could definitely keep coming back for more of this crisp, flavorful, balanced brew. Also, stick this in barrels and I'd marry it. Like, tomorrow."
"Good beer, not great beer, but still worth seeking out. A little too thin for me to love it."
"D: Good flavor and body with a high abv but still easy to drink."
"D- Very nice stuff. The smoke is very easy to deal with here."
"D - It's pretty easy to finish 1, but could I drink 2? Probably not. The smokiness is just a little bit too intense. Still a great brew. Glad I was lucky enough to try it."
"The mouthfeel is a little above medium bodied and carbonation is on the lower side. Drinkability is very good, it had some great bold flavors to it but yet remained very smooth and drinkable. The chocolate was especially nice. The smoke was good but was probably more intense fresher. Very good beer overall."
"Very good beer. The oak is for me a critical component that kept this one sane & drinkable. Glad to finally meet you, Smoke."
"Ridiculously smooth and tasty. I haven't had Darkness on tap yet, and until I do this remains my favorite offering from Surly. And that's saying something."
"Overall, another great limited release from Surly. This beer just reminds me of fall/winter. Would be perfect while sitting around a fire. The name really is dead on as the biggest thing that stuck with me is its smokey characteristics."
"Poured into a mug. The color was a dark brown, with a 2 finger head. The smoke smell was, in my opinion, a little too strong. The taste was OK, but again, I thought it was too smokey. It was smooth at the start, and a medium bitter on the tail end. Drinkability was somewhat low due to the over powering flavor, and slightly elevated ABV."
"Quite drinkable. As noted, the alcohol was well-masked and the smoke added character without overpowering the rest."
"All in all, this is a truly fantastic beer. I'll be trying to find a few more bottles around town before it sells out."
"The smokiness is a limiting factor in drinking a lot of this, but I do love this beer."
"This beer pours a black color that you cant see through. There is also an off white, tan looking head. The aroma of this beer smells of smoke and roasted malts. The flavor reminds me of a piece of oakwood that was burnt and thrown into the aging tank. It is a very good taste, balanaced with malt and hops. The carbonation is low to moderate, and I would consider this a drinkable beer."
" ~ I like this beer. It is one of the most unique beers I've been lucky enought to sample. If you are able to get your hands on a bottle, don't let go of it."
"Smoke has a medium to full body. The smoke flavor really explodes on the palate. Dark malt mixes with the smoke that roasted it to create a satisfying flavor profile. Toward the end the alcohol warms the chest. A well made winter brew with ample complexity built around a smoky backbone. If you love smoked beer, you will be in heaven. If smoke isn't your think, it will remind you of hell."
"This is a remarkable brew in that despite beinga smoky roasted malty beer, the flavor profiles converge to recall a delciously strong and complex wine like a Chateauneuf du Pape...woody smokiness, licorice, cherries,charred smokiness, blackberries and vanilla. Very unusual and very compelling. I keep tasting it and while it is carbonated and therefore doesnt feel like a wine, it is bitter and roasted and that is not like a wine, the flavor keeps tasting like a string, rich, extracted, powerful wine. Very nice."
"I expected to taste way more smoke in this than i did. It feels more like a smoked imperial stout than anything else. Not bad tho. Not bad at all!"
"D: As stated above, it went into the drain."
"Drinkability: The smoke isn't intense initially but is lingering. This is good for me as besides the smoke, the basic baltic porter elements are quite tasty."
"A solid beer from Surly again! Not sure I'll pick up more than 1 of these each year though it will be interesting to see how this developes."
"Overall: Another great beer from Surly. Unique, complex, and definitely not subtle."
"I've always like a good smoked beer so this one hit the spot for me. Lots of smoky character but still very drinkable. Good stuff."
"Pours a dark amber-brown with a nice off white head. The nose is really quite smoky, although it doesn't go so far that it's overpowering. A bit meat. Roasted malt and some dark fruits and chocolate underneath. Quite complex. Taste is a bit less so, as there is some general chocolate and roast below the heavy smoke character, but the smoke is definitely stealing the show. All the smoke and meaty flavors bring a nice mouthfeel, and this drinks quite well, especially comparing it against similar beers."
"Drinkability -- While very rich and complex, It doesn't take long for the deep smoke flavor to become overwhelming. Couldn't see myself have more than a single 12oz pour."
"OVERALL: A complex and flavourful porter for sure. The appearance was slightly lacking and the palate a little light, but overall this was an enjoyable beer to drink. Glad to have had the chance to try it, but won't be seeking it out again."
"SkÅL!"
"An overall good beer."
"D: very for its strength"
"D. Very drinkable. This is a pretty damn tasty beer. Very smooth drinking. Lots of complex flavors that blend together nicely. Never been let down by Surly yet."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, silky smooth, a bit of warmth going down. A great beer, thanks Russ!"
"drinkability is great. nice balance. great depth. a tasty baltic and smoked beer."
"D: I'm glad I tried it, but I can get an Aecht Schlenkerla rauch bier that tastes better for way less trouble."
"Drinkability: For whatever reason, my bottle lacked carbonation; still a fine example of a creatively brewed beer by the folks at Surly"
"D: I could drink this all night, but I'd surly regret it in the morning."
"Awesome, awesome beer! Thanks again Russ!"
"O: Just another example of why Surly is quickly becoming one of the best in the business."
"D- This was a good brew overall. Classic smoked porter. I have New Glarus smoke on the porter and I am interested to compare this experience to that brew."
"Certainly above average and worth seeking out. I'm sure this would be outstanding to age, unfortunately I have no more."
"D: Given the heartiness and flavour present in this brew, it is great. Not even sure of the ABV."
"The prospect of a smoked baltic porter --> I need new pants. Let's do this shit! It pours an opaque scorched brown with a small amount of tan foam on top. The nose comprises charcoal-smoked ham, roasted malts, molasses, and brown sugar. The salivation has begun in earnest. The taste holds notes of sweet syrup, molasses, brown sugar, spruce, and caramel up front, leading a healthy puff of light smoke. The flavors may not necessarily stand on an equal footing with the smell, but they do come very close. And, besides, it's still pretty damn tasty regardless. The body is a hefty medium, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a rich, oily feel (and I mean that in a good way). I am very pleased, indeed, to have been able to try this beast. Now I've gotta find a way to get more..."
"D - Excellent choice for my 100th review. Another great brew from Surly. Medium bodied smooth sipper. An easy brew that I can easily have more than a couple of glasses of. I recommend this brew if you can find it yet on a shelf or trade for it"
"Cheers!"
"Chewy, viscous medium body that again, is only slightly smokey. Very well balanced with lots of luscious chocolate malt goodness. Slightly spivey possibly with anise as well as some hops to comiment the roasty/smokey notes. Hints of deep roasted coffee bean, bittersweet dark chocolate, burnt toast and toffee. As in the aroma, the smokiness isn't as intense as expected. Only subtle hints of vampire, butane, bacon, charcoal, BBQ, etc. integrated into the flavor. Very complex, excellently balanced and the high ABV is pretty well masked, making this beer ery quaffable. I really enjoyed this beer but didn't find it as smokey as I expected or hoped for. Highly recommend but I would warn the smokeheads out there that this beer isn't that intense in that regard."
"D-definitely a good bit of smoke with a good malty sweetness and nice hop presence in the finish. solid drink here with some nice maltiness going on."
"Drinkability: This one was very easy to down. What else can you say? It's a good Baltic Porter brimming with smooth smokiness."
"D: a nice showcase of roasted and smoked malts, everything is in nice balance, the ABV is undetectable. I am convinced that Surly is incapable of brewing a beer that is anything less than spectacular."
"Toasty dark malt, smoke, light roast and astringent rubber. Smoke is well integrated, present at a subtle level. Medium-light body with a good level of carbonation. Finishes with smoke, rubber, roasted malt. The body is spot on but the rubbery flavor is very detracting."
"D-This is probably the most subtle smoky beer I've had. The smoke is definitely there, but it doesn't override everything else going on in this beer."
"The taste is much sweeter than most porters, lots of malty sweetness and toastiness. The smoky flavor carries in the aftertaste for a long time. If anything could be improved flavor-wise, I'd like to ramp up the smoked malts and dial down the sweetness."
"Very solid beer overall. Even better than I expected this would be as a highly rated beer from a brewery I really like."
"Great drinkability for a smoked porter of this abv. An awesome example of the beer, but again, not as good as on tap at the brewery in the past. I'll have to have another bottle I guess!"
"D - a pleasure to drink."
"xomparing my notes, I am left with the distinct impression something was lost between one of those first batches I had on tap and this bottle. Good, but very far from the greatness I noticed the first time. Quite disappointing."
"Another example of Surly showing us why we love them."
"Overall, yet another very good beer from Surly. Very glad I got to try this one. Would recommend to all."
"Overall this is definitely a fine beer, but one that is designed for a specific palate. Definitely worth giving a shot."
"D - Fairly drinkable, definately drinkable for the style. Very solid."
"3.5 D: Good beer, but a lot of room to improve. The base recipe is solid, but a higher mash temp and some flaked barley or wheat could do wonders."
"Once again another feather in Surly's hat, solid and unique beer."
"Thanks tdg!"
"M/D: A little bit thinner then I remembered it to be when I had it at the Surly Beer Dinner @ The Happy Gnome in Feb. Medium body. Carbonation is a little on the higher side at first, but dies down to hardly anything after a short while. ABV is hidden pretty well. A cold fall/winter night sipper. Drinkability is pretty good considering the style."
"Overall, I think I liked this slightly better on tap, but can't really complain about this in bottle form. I don't really see this improving too much in the bottle, but it certainly won't get any worse."
"The palate is solid. Opening moderately fruity with a blend of raisins and dates coupled with some medium dark chocolate (50%?) and vanilla sweetness with some smoke to tie it all together, this is actually a beautifully crafted beer. The smoke character is moderate to low and is well integrated. Licorice is noticeable mid-palate. Alcohol does appear on the finish that's dry, fruity, a little smoky and a little astringent. There's also a touch of Splenda-like sweetness on the finish. These two do detract marginally from a great experience. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this is a very enjoyable beer. Thanks again, Bill!"
"Overall, this is another awesome beer from Surly. It seems that every thing they brew rocks pretty hard. I think some people might be looking for more smoke flavor in this beer, but the complexity and smoothness that the brewers bought to this offering will make most people forget any complaints they may have had. Awesome job Surly! I'm eagerly awaiting the release of Four."
"This beer is absolutely a treat. Surly scores again. Get your hands on some if you can."
"Enjoyed on tap at Acadia Cafe in Minneapolis, MN. Poured into a stemmed tulip glass this beer shows an extremely dark brown body with a thin ring of off-white foam. Aroma is raisins, peat, burnt sugar and a hint of smokiness. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a low to medium carbonation level. Flavors are of caramelized sugar, dried grass and level smokiness. Hop bitterness shows for a moment in the finish and is quickly replaced by a dry malt sweetness. I was expecting much more smoke flavors, but this is still a solid baltic porter."
"I bought 2 bottles from Heritage for like $14 and then one from Haskell's Stillwater for closer to $16, so this is certainly not a cheap beer, but its certainly worth trying. I have one to trade..."
"Drinkability- Lots of big flavors going on here but all done in moderation and considering the 8%+, this thing is hella drinkable. My only real complaint is that I a Smoked Beer fan and I'd love a bit more smoke in this. Who knows though, maybe it would screw this up royally. Enjoyed yet again!"
"Drinkability: Overall, very nice balance between a Baltic Porter, Rauchbier and Oak-Aged beer. Delicious and very easy to drink, belaying its 8.2% abv."
"M&D: A bit lighter than I was anticipating, but still very full bodied and smooth. It's a great sipper, and would accompany BBQ quite nicely. This, however, is a smoked brew that is amazing on it's own. Like I said before, this beer has Surly wriiten all over it. They can do no wrong."
"Medium bodied, smooth, easy to drink, and the alcohol is well hidden. I could drink this all the time with no problem."
"D: Good portion of smoke. Mouthfeel is just right. Big in flavor, but refreshing."
"Good on drinkability. I have to admit, this one didn't quite live up to the hype, but it was still quite good. I'm looking forward to trying the other bottle sometime down the road to see how it fares with some age."
"D - Easy to drink, no real hint of alcohol. Another winner by Surly."
"D: This beer was described to me as a stout, along the lines of BCS, but smokier. That description is quite inaccurate. For a beer named ""Smoke"" I was expecting a heavier beer with a more pronounced smoke aroma and flavor, but, in the end, I'm glad the smokiness wasn't overdone as it created a beer with a better drinkability."
"Overall, this is a fine beer. I wouldn't call it a baltic porter its not nearly heavy or sweet enough. I'd call it a pseudo rauch and for that, its pretty damn tasty."
"TOTAL: 41.5/50"
"Very good beer overall and a distinct example of the style in that I didn't get the typical black patent malt flavors that are typically found in Baltic Porters. Yet more evidence that Surly is among the elite breweries in the world."
"D- For such a strong beer this is quite drinkable. I have become a fan of baltic porters recently, and while there are others that I like more, I would definitley get this one again if I saw it around."
"D - The Rauchmalz, if that's what they used, is well balanced with the other ingredients. This isn't a subtle beer, but it is quite harmonious ... and drinkable."
"Had this twice in the past couple of weeks on tap, once at the release party and this evening at Grumpy's in NE Mpls. Poured black, very little head which dissipated fairly quickly. Slight smell of smoke and maltiness -- I had expected more but with little head and carbonation, to be expected I suppose. The smoke balanced nicely with a subtle bittersweetness. Somewhere between medium and full-bodied. The balance and creamy texture made this very easy to drink although I don't know that I'd session it. Love to see this in bottles or cans next year!"
"Had this at the release party at Brasa's on 11/30/09. Was poured from tap into a 10oz glass. Little to no head was a little bit of a dissappointment, not sure if that was caused by the pour or if it is just that way. Needless to say, the lack of head hindered the aroma of the beer a little. Smelled of slight smoke and a subtle sweetness. What a taste though! Very smooth with a slight smoke taste that ends with a subtle sweetness, just like the smell I guess. Very drinkable! With a name like Smoke, I was expecting a Smoked Porter taste but was pleasantly surprised. This is an extremely good beer. Love to see it in bottle or can..."
"Overall, I was a little worried that the smoke was going to be to much for me. But Surly really blended this well. Very drinkable to me, considering smokes aren't my favorite. If you get a chance, give this beer a try."
"Very interesting brew- one of the few smoke beers that I have liked. Appearance is very good. Lots of head, dark in color and nice cascading. Smell is pretty good but almost all smoke. Some roasted nut and bitter chocolate. Taste is a bit more complex, a lot of smoke but more of the malt comes through here. Some sweetness like caramel as well. Nice and thick mouthfeel. Drinkability is pretty good as well."
"Another fine Surly brew."
"Pours a dark brown with a silky tan head. The nose has sweet roasty malts and a nice smokey presence, oak, vanilla, ripe fruits and chocolate. The taste was also quite smokey but well balanced by the roasty malts, sweet fruits, cocoa, vanilla and wood. Creamy body is very well carbonated. Let see some bottles!"
"Overall: Pretty drinkable, the smoke flavor is not too overpowering, generous amount of roasted malt, there is a very nice hoppyness towards the end that gives this beer an extra bit of character."
"Overall- This is one of the best porters I have ever had and would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice smokey porter."
"Overall: Very good porter, nice arbonation and very enjoyable as far as mouthfeel goes. Highly drinkable beer as well, the alcohol doesn't come out as much as it should for such a high abv beer. One of Surly's most impressive."
"Overall I cannot say enough good things about this one, it was one of the best Baltic Porters I have ever had and tasted more complex then just about anything else in the category. This is a must get that it looks like you will have to go to MN to go get now."
"D: Overall, a pretty solid beer. I'm not a big fan of smoked things and I actually liked this beer. I think it is well balanced in regards to the smoky flavors. It really fit well with my adobo pork dish. I'd try this again with certain foods, but probably not on its own. I'll search for it when I have another adobo dish or if I have something in the way of a bacon cheddar burger. I'd recommend giving this one a whirl."
"D: I can't see being excessive with this beer, have had 5-6 pints of this to date, but never back to back. Also, maybe it's psychological, but this thing tasted better at the brewery...I swear."
"Very good, much better then my plastic cup at the brewery. No signs of alcahol at the knose, but some mild warming comes around after the swallow with the lingering bitterness."
"A Beautiful beer!"
"(3.7/5)"
"D= for me not to high. It was fun to try but it was just not my style. I graded it higher because it accomplished what they whated to accomplish... just not for me though"
"D-I like this beer. It's tasty, with it's namesake smokey flavor prominent, but not near overpowering the balance of the flavor. It's an enjoyable brew, hearty and great to enjoy while watching the wind blow outside. Complex in flavor, enjoyable to drink."
"D- A slow drinker but nice."
"A good beer."
"Pours very dark, nearly pitch black. Good brown head that holds and leaves lots of lacing. Very sweet and very smoky. Loads of smoke but not really abrasive, which is impressive. The hops come out much more in the drink, some citrus and loads of resins. Deep cola tastes with grapy notes and loads of dark sweetness. The smoke balances throughout the drink and seems to be in all the tastes. Body is nearly full and very smooth. ABV is big and this was my last review of the day, lol."
"Mouthfeel is nice and full, with a great smoothness to it, and I could drink a few of these easily."
"It was overall a GREAT beer, one of the best I have ever had, maybe it was just the freshness of the beer, or the fact that I was drinking it at the brewery, but it was sooo good."
"Had this on tap at D-Day. Poured a dark brown color, nice tan foam. Smoke in the nose mixed some sweet malts, and light hop bitterness. Nice smoke flavor, some chocolate, and green hoppiness. I find it hard to believe that the ABV was 9.5% on that brew. It was easily drinkable, but the smoke flavor is only good for one beer at a time. Nice and interesting offering from Surly. D-Day was great, and was glad I had the opportunity to try this one."
"Neat. I usually think of rauchbiers and smokes as occasional treats, brews you might finish the night with but you would never consider pounding at length. This is easily the most drinkable, session-ready smoke beer I've ever come across. It certainly didn't taste like it was 9.5% ABV, and frankly I'd be surprised if that listing wasn't in error, but if it's anywhere close to correct that holy mother this is one dangerous beer."
" I could have had about 3 more of these, highlighting the drinkability. Its good stuff."
"It's really easy to forget this one's 9.5%. Watch out!"
"Overall: I am not the biggest smoked beer fan, so I am not gangbusters over this beer. But you have to respect the quality or this beer, and all the flavor juxtaposition going on. The smokiness was toned back enough that I could really enjoy it, especially when having one with a meal, rather than as session ale."
"Very good quaff."
"Drinkability is all right for such a big, smoky beer, but I really couldn't handle more than a full glass of this."
"Overall good, easy to drink, could use more smoke aroma and flavor."
"D: Proper serving temp is the key with this. This drank like a porter with half the abv. Excellent."
"Served on tap in a tulip glass at Stub&Herbs, this pours a beautiful opaque black color, with a minimal white head and scant white lacing on the glass. The smell is faint. I detect an alcoholic, brandy-like smell. The taste is wonderfully complex, with a cherry brandy flavor, along with a smoky toasty chocolate malt presence, as well as a slight taste of vanilla. There is just enough hop presence to balance the other flavors. This is a terrific tasting beer, with rich and lingering flavors. The high alcohol content is the only thing marring the drinkability. This is another exceptional beer from Surly."
"I'm not sure if I like smoked beer or not but I could tell there was a lot at work here and I would love to try this again if given the opportunity."
"Drinkability - Damn Good! ABV is hidden well. The smoke flavor was there, but was not overpowering. Recommended!"
"Lingering, tan head. Opaque. Yep...grillsmoke and roasted malt in the nose. Creamy chocolate/+/hops upfront. Subtle smoke in an otherwise warm finish. Strong. Tasty. Want to pair it with ...smoked venison summer sausage."
"I had this on tap at Cafe Twenty Eight. This beer is an opaque black color. The head was small when the beer arrived, but a nice cap of lacing lasted until the beer was gone. The aroma is immense. Smoke bacon, maple syrup, burnt caramel, and bitter chocolate. The taste is as large as the aroma. The smoked flavors are prevalent, but are well balanced with the beers other attributes. The mouthfeel is full bodied, silky in texture, and has light carbonation. Overall, this is a beer to contemplate. I would certainly drink this again."
"Pours a dark dark brown, near black, with a generous dark tan head, good staying power, nice lacing, quite lovely. The aroma is a little more mellow than I'd imagined, smoked malts more chill, some nice bacon (yum!), smoked salmon, some chocolate and faintly earthy hop notes. The taste follows the same lines, but better, more complex perhaps, the chocolates and caramels and toffees peeking out. The smoke is still understated, any meaty connotations well balanced. The body is delightful, silky smooth, a little warmth is all the warning you get from this strong brew. In all, I had to keep switching from this to another brew, but I kept coming back, and back, and back, and back..."
"This was a well balanced, medium bodied, well rounded beer."
"This is a thinking (wo)man's beer. Plenty to ponder and more to enjoy. Go find some before it's gone."
"Inky black. Soft looking creamy brown head. A full sheet of lace is laid down as I drink. The aroma is quite subtle. Smoke is subtle. There are nice roasty and chocolatey malt tones as well. But reserved as a whole. On the palate, there's a bit of that phenolic smokey stuff going on. Bacony in nature. Nice roasted bitterness. The phenolic (slightly medicinal) nature is a little strong for my personal taste. But it adds some character. The beer is medium bodied. Slightly alcoholic. Flaccid feel. Not particularily creamy or velvety. O.K. though. This beer reminds me of my own smoked porter, which garnered 2nd overall at the NHC this year. And as with mine, I feel that this is merely good...not great."
"there's just one thing I'd like to say to the folks at Surly...is there anything you can't do??"
"Another home run from Surly. Try it if you can."
"A phenomenal brew from Surly. Delightfully drinkable and versatile. A departure from the traditional Surly style, though more than welcome. hoppinessI would welcome this beer anytime time of the year."
"Drinkability tastewise is nice, sessionability slowed a bit by high abv. and strong strong flavors."
"Overall Impression: I had 2 and am glad I went home when I did. 3 would have been too much for being 3PM and I would have had to go to bed. With that said, I loved the beer and believe it is another classic Surly beer...not true to the style, but damn good none the less!"
"This is highly drinkable, dangerous even. Another triumph for the geniuses at Surly. Bring on the ""two""!!"
"Quite tasty, kind of reminds me of Bender, but with a smoky aftertaste. Good stuff, too bad they don't can this, otherwise I'd buy more!"
"Really magnificent! This needs to go in bombers and blow some minds out there! Til that happens, I'm happy to drink it down on tap right here! Ahhh!!!"
"This was a phenomenal brew. This is probably the best Surly brew behind Darkness. I polished one of these off easily and I could have pounded more, but I felt compelled to try the TeaBagged Furious cask."
"The drinkability is outstanding! Ahhh, but here is where I think that term ""Smoke"" came from other then the obvious use of smoked malts. As its the ABV that renders itself like smoke from a fire smoldering in your head. It builds slowly at first, filling your head gradually with smoke, eventually, and before you know it your head is a blaze of swimming glee from the ABV. Wow, one sneaky fuckin beer! Watch out for this one, be sure to drink water to help slow the smoke. Whew..."
