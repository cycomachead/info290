3.67,-4.7,4.25,3.5,3.5,4.25,3.75,"A big-ass Baltic-Style Porter with blood orange peel and cacao nibs. Big on darkness with a brown lacing on top. Big nose and palate of dark fruit and highly roasted grain, both of which give off suggestions of dark fruit and coffee ... chocolate comes from the cacao nibs obviously. Massive chewy body and the 9.0% abv is noticeable, there is some orange peel in here but this beer is just too big for it really to make a good showing. Perhaps there is a pinch of it middle to end but pretty damn subtle. Also, the addition of cacao could easily be confused for additions of dark malt ... if it was not on the label I would not even think about it. Regardless, good drinking all around.","Jason","Jan 18, 2015"

The smell is pretty strong with chocolate with no real hints of orange. Mouthfeel is over-all smooth but with sharp carbonation coming late. Taste is dark and slightly bitter chocolate.

Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, citrus, orange zest, and roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, orange, milk chocolate, and subtle dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. If I am honest here, I really don’t know what they were trying to do… While the chocolate and orange aspect was definitely there, I’m not sure it worked so great together. Luckily there was some dark fruit character going on to help add a nice medium to the brew. Otherwise this one could have been a disaster. Worth trying at least once, but I would leave it at that.","thagr81us","Sep 04, 2012"

Flavor full dark malt flavors come forth with a hint of orange peel flowing along big sweet maltiness balanced with dark roass.

3.75,-2.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Picked up a bomber from Brilbeck's in Syracuse. The orange doesn't come out until you give this beer time to warm up, but once it's there, the orange peel makes a fine complement to the dark malts. The chocolate here isn't that strong. The barley has a clean roasted brown malt flavor in addition to the cocoa, and I can't say I taste the cacao nibs at all. The orange component tastes sweet and a little juicy, but it doesn't overshadow the barley. The body is light for a 9% ABV porter, but not inappropriately so, and not surprising for a Saranac beer. Overall, it makes a nice, not too heavy dessert beer with the classic orange and chocolate pairing.","tempest","May 13, 2012"
3.88,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"O: A bit blunt at first, the chocolate and coffee roast are dark and dominating while the alcohol surely flexes its muscle as well. It takes a few sips but things do smooth out a bit once your tongue becomes accustomed to the heavy handed roasty and alcohol nature. Saranac definitely amped things up a bit from their usual offering here with a dark silty roasty treat worhty of a try.","beerthulhu","May 06, 2012"

Aroma of roasty dark malts, coffee notes, probably about robust enough to be a stout. Taste of dark malts, roasty, cocoa, with a hint of citrus and pine in the finish, and a ubiquitous booziness throughout. I got more booze than anything in this one really, and it detracted from the mouthfeel quite a bit. Body is no more than middle-of-the-road medium, leaving no doubt that this is no stout, low carbonation, which was good considering it wasn't very smooth otherwise.

Lots of foods like mousse cake or pudding would go well with this but lets face it, when you get a beer this works this well on its own, just enjoy the work of art for what it is.
