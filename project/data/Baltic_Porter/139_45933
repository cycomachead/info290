There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

It looks amazing and definitely tastes pretty good, but the weak aroma and thin, fizzy mouthfeel do not help this beer's case at all. I still have to give this stuff a thumbs up, but the aforementioned flaws prevent it from being a truly memorable imperial porter. There are local options (Wellington RIS and Grand River's Russian Gun) that are more affordable and equally satisfying, so this is not something I am likely to repurchase. Not an amazing deal at its LCBO price point, but potentially worth a try if you want a changeup.","thehyperduck","Dec 18, 2012"

High and sometimes prickly carbonation, light-med body though it felt thin at points.

The nose comprises roasted malts, light toasted caramel, very light coffee, and a touch of seared wood. The taste brings in more of the same, but with a stronger char/vinyl character, along with some deep molasses notes. Something tells me they overdid it a bit on the black patent malts here. This character tends toward the astringent and kinda ruins the whole experience for me. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish.

Body is thin and creamy, with some sweet and tart notes that remind me of a milk stout. It’s not a big and boozy as I remember it being, but this might be due to the fact that I’m drinking a bottle with a ‘best by’ date of March 2011 and it’s mid September. Or maybe I just remember it differently, as the last one I had was towards the end of winter. All in all it’s a solid porter.

4.15,11.9,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Poured from a bomber and served in a pint glass, the beer is a deep, dark brown coloring with some chestnut highlights around the edges of the glass. Poured with a ton of light tan head at first, but it quickly settled into a thin film of dense head. Aromas are slightly coffee and dark chocolate, with a slight booze characteristic. The beer's flavors are more coffee centric, with a good balance of dark chocolate and a highlight of milk chocolate. Very complex and well blended. Bitter from the coffee and from hops hit the tail end of the palate, cleaning everything up nicely. No cling on the glass, and the beer tends to be standard for the Porter style, with a thin, light body overall. The aftertaste is heavy on the bitters, with highlights of the coffee and chocolate flavors lacing through. The finish is slick at first, and then dry through the end.

Tasted like nose smell, nice chocolate on the front end, low bitterness, extremely heavy carbonation, almost too much. Prickly on tongue, sweet deep malts in the after taste, low on hops aroma and hops taste, but alcohol is well hidden. Could drink this slowly throughout the evening.

The flavor was though was in fact more pronounced, certainly with some chocolate, caramel, and toffee notes, but a big contribution came from the roasted/coffee notes. The finish was semi-dry as a result. Alcohol content was well-hidden. Semi-thick feel, with a little more carbonation than expected.

There is some smokey taste in there as well and a nice bite on the finish. Sort of sweet on the swallow. Mouthfeel is rather average based on the going's on. Very easily drunk even for a 7.10.

The retention was pretty good, especially as a skim and the lacing in broken bands. The aroma was of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate malt, bittersweet chocolate and baking cocoa. The flavors were similarly slanted towards the dark/roasty side but with little complexity beyond that. I tasted sweet caramel and chocolate malt up front with some light molasses notes as well followed by the coffee, roasted malt and alcohol heat. The hops did give enough bitterness to balance the malt elements especially towards the end. Slightly nutty and maybe slightly spicy but otherwise straight forward; sweet malt, dark malt, bitter finish.

Low carbonation in the mouthfeel, but avoids feeling flat or watery. Powerful roasted malt and caramel taste up front that ebbs slightly to a Baker's chocolate taste. Heavy molasses throughout. A wooden barrel flavor blended with peat/earth again pops up and stays until the finish. Slightly veggie and soy sauce at times when it warmed up. It was good, but felt like a meal.","magictrokini","Apr 01, 2009"
3.6,-3,4,4,3.5,4,3,"Really seems more stout than Baltic Porter. For one thing it is quite dry and smoky for the style. For a second there really isn't and fruity or fig flavors to this. Not really something I will order again.","Zorro","Mar 30, 2009"
3.28,-11.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"22 oz. bomber. Nice gold tin foil on top. The beer poured a deep dark color that I couldn't even quite figure out. I am gonna go with it being black. Hmmm. Not much in the way of head. Some tan colors along the side, but nothing that spectacular.The nose was somewhat thin. A bit of sharp alcohol with a deep breath. Some thick meaty flavors popped up just on the edge and just the slightest hint of molasses. The taste was a bit better than the smell. Nice roasty flavors, rich notes of bitter chocolate. A slick, sweet finish. Mouthfeel was a bit sharp, but not too creamy. Perhaps a tad too much carbonation. This was an okay go at the style, but it lacks a bit of the real definition that I like in the porter style. I'll stick with Old Thumper when I drink Shipyard.","GreatPondBrewer","Mar 27, 2009"
2.57,-30.7,3.5,4,2,2,2,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a scant 1/8"" dark brown head over the almost opaque dark brown brew. What head there is quickly recedes to the rim, encircling a swirly skim, with leggy slow-falling lace. Aroma is dark malt, anise, and alcohol. Taste follows the nose, but weakly, and the alcohol close is harsh and fusel-involving. Mouthfeel is thin for the style, and drinkability is limited by above noted traits. Sorely disappointed.","ppoitras","Mar 26, 2009"

3.73,0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Mild carbonation with a medium heft to the body. The alcohol is burried within the flavor and adds complexity to the brew. The actual mouthfeel is a tad watery and has a slightly chalky bite in the end. I've had a few bombers of this and definetely recommend giving it a try. It's very English-like, but that's not a wonder. I prefer Pugsley's Sig. BW a bit more than this one...both are nice offerings though.","scottoale","Mar 06, 2009"

The pour is a very dark brown and almost black with a foamy, tan head the remains on top for a few moments, Decent lacing. The aroma is of chocolate malts and of bitter hops. The mouthfeel is bold.

4,7.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a two finger light tan head that leaves traces of lace. Almost black, faint mahogany highlights color. Roasted coffee nose. Light carbonation and heavy bodied.

3.72,0.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D- Very drinkable, but... This brew would be a decent Porter but for a Baltic the flavor is fairly bland and the body is light. I would expect something with a full body and flavor profile. This ain't it....","JayNH","Jan 06, 2009"
4.15,11.9,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a midnight black with a two finger tan colored head that dies down to a thin layer of foam. A decent amount of chunky lacing remains on the sides of the glass. Nose consists of smoked malts, roasted barley, and some good 'ol ringwood yeast. Smell also has some coffee notes and cocoa powder as well. Taste starts off with ashy bark, some brown sugar, and roasted coffee grinds. Ringwood emerges midway but isn't overly strong, thank god. Aftertaste is smokey and sweet with toasted grains, some molasses, spicy hops, metallic notes, and a touch of butter from the ringwood. The body is a bit thinner than I like for the style, with a dry feel and a medium to strong carbonation. This is a nice English Ale that is true to style. I've found that the Ringwood yeast strain is hit or miss for certain styles with Middle Ages being a stones throw from my apartment, but this is definitely one that works. The only problem I have with this beer is the price tag, bring it down a couple bucks and I'd be all over this bad boy again and again.","BeerTruth","Dec 25, 2008"

3.38,-8.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"22oz bomber from the local Hannaford. Pours an opaque dark brown/black body with virtually no head to speak of. Toastiness and butter dominate the aroma. Toasty dark chocolate with a fair bit of butter as well. On the lighter side of medium in body with moderate to low carbonation. Okay beer, but I must admit I'm rather underwhelmed by it's simplistic taste and lackluster features. This beer could be cleaned up and dialed in for sure. Not what I look for from a Baltic porter or imperial porter.","MrHurmateeowish","Dec 17, 2008"

Delicious cask draught with the typical but full chocolate-toffee-coffee aroma and a nice bitterness that followed not to sweet mouthy flavor. Smooth & rich with a hint of sourness behind the bitter. Definitely up there with Mayflower!","selecter70","Dec 15, 2008"

Easy to drink for an ""Imperial"" beer. There's no indication of any alcohol nor ""big"" flavors. Other than the title, this might be a pedestrian porter. Still, it's tasty and worthy of trying.","smcolw","Dec 14, 2008"
