"Coconut and cocoa definitely show. This adds a lot of flavor to the base beer. Bourbon with a little heat. Some vanilla. The best out of the 4 I tried side by side."
"Overall: the highlight of the framinghammer series. really nice balance. sweet but no where near cloying."

"Love this beer, not quite as thick and rich as the truly elite BA stouts, but in some ways that is a good thing when you are in the mood for something 'lighter' (relatively speaking, of course). Flavors are well balanced, excellent beer overall."

"Loads of dark chocolate, some toasted coconut, with a big bourbon & wood  finish. A little hot but overall very good."

"Smells and looks great. Taste is over the top and cloying. Incredibly difficult to drink."

"This was a phenomenal beer.  I've never had a coconut beer before but my instinct tells me this would be easy to screw up.  The coconut flavor mixes so well with the coffee, chocolate, and bourbon flavors.  They definitely took a risk by the amount of coconut (first the smell) and then the forward tasting flavors.  Could have been a disaster but its well done.  Great work Jack's Abby."

"Very good, the coconut is bit obvious and cloying, but it's nice that it's not overly subtle like in other beers I've had. Also melds great with cocoa nibs and bourbon."
"Decadent mix of BA Framinghammer and lots of toasted coconut. The chocolate is felt throughout perhaps just a bit more than the regular but still big. The whiskey and oak only pulls it together more with some vanilla sweets."

"What a great beer. Super complex and tasty, while really nailing the coconut-chocolate flavors. Easy drinker, and definitely a sipper."

"M - I think that this is my first beer that has coconut added and it is awesome. Highly recommend trying this beer at least once."

"Overall: Excellent beer.  I think the PBJ still claims best variant for me but this was a very drinking experience.  Its reputation is well earned."

"O: Like the BA Framinghammer and the other variants I've tried, this is a terrific beer. Unlike the others, it's more of a dessert beer geared towards slow sipping."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Hard to judge which one of these Framinghammer's I like the most. They are all so close together because the base beer never becomes overshadowed."

"O: Interesting, I've had the vanilla and coffee versions of this, this year and I thought they were somewhat underwhelming compared to last year (very little bourbon this year). This however, is the opposite. Bourbon everywhere. From start to finish. Maybe even a little too much? Seems to overshadow the base beer and the adjuncts quite a bit."
"Love this beer. Sweet and delicious . Could not drink several of these in arrow, but, this is a wonderful beer to savor. I will stock up more in my fridge. Another great Jacks Abby beer. Taste this beer."

"The 3rd best Framinghammer variant of the night, probably."
""
"O - Silky coconut is dominate and thick."
""
""
""

"Surprising that the coconut is so forward in the palate."

"Pours the color of cola with a loose, khaki-colored head. Nose expresses roast, dark malts, cocoa, char and caramel. Taste is fantastic! Toasted coconut really comes out. This beer tastes just like an almond joy; however, there is also a touch of artificial sweetener. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation; however, it all comes off a bit thin in the end. Overall, this is another exceptional framinghammer variant. Not my favorite, but quite impressive nonetheless."
""
"O- This is a fantastic barrel aged porter. So much flavor from the cocoa nibs and coconut, as well as the bourbon barrel. A bit boozy, but excellent none the less!"
""
"O -- Pretty good."
""
"O - Great addition to the Barrel Aged Framinghammer series, try the coffee and vanilla as well."
""
"O - The Coffee and Vanilla Framinghammer variants are some of the best Baltic Porters out there. This is on another level. So much going on in the smell and taste. This pushes the limits of Baltic Porters. Hopefully they release it again next year because this needs to be shared with the world."

"O: i love the BA framinghammer and all the variants and this is no exception. The coconut is present just enough to not overpower and blends well with the barrel aged goodness. Glad i picked some up."
""

"M: thick like oil"
