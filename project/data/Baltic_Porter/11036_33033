4.06,-0.7,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is jet black with mahogany highlights around the edges, and a frothy, low profile, dense, light tan head. Aromas of roasted highlights, toasted bread, bitter coffee, hints of vanilla, hints of booze, and some earthy and woody highlights. Smells aren't overpowering, but very inviting. Flavors are bitter coffee forward, with heavily roasted qualities. Wood characteristics, old world fruit rich sweetness, and hints of smoke. There is also a building warmth from the increased ABV. This is deep and layered. Robust body, but crisp enough to stay true to style. The aftertaste is heavy roast, subtle smoke, and bitterness. Smooth, slightly dry finish. This is a big beer, and it is damn tasty!","GarthDanielson","0"

Nose of roast, milk chocolate, bitter citrus, powdered chocolate, and caramel malt. Medium full body, thick on palate with fine carbonation and a lingering bitter finish.

Fuller bodied, not watery smooth but not sticky, either, and goes down easy with a dry finish.

Flavors again have a dessertish quality and a nutty character, like hazelnuts, with some creamy vibes going on as well. Its sweet to a point, but it doesn’t come across as overly sweet as the nutty qualities of the malts, the creaminess of the body, and the touch of hop bitterness in the finish make it all come together quite nicely.","PatLarsen","Beers"

Deep, roasted chocolate-covered dark fruit aromas with a spot of age that melds with a smooth hit of alcohol. Molasses and a trace of smoky char. Big, roasted malt flavor...very dark chocolate sweetness - not too sweet. Moderate purple fruit esters in the middle leading to a dry, bitter roast finish.

Despite all the tastes and smells being so strong, the beer balances itself pretty well, making for a moderately drinkable beer.

4.02,-1.7,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"I'm a big fan of nearly everything I have tried from Foothills, and this beer is no exception. Poured from the bottle, the color is a deep, nearly opaque dark brown, with a thick, foamy beige head that quickly settles to a thin film surrounded by a foamy halo. The aroma is rich and potent, with notes of cocoa powder and licorice. The flavor likewise features a dark roasted malt profile of bittersweet chocolate and licorice, but a nice pine hop bitterness and a little booze is also in there. The very-fine carbonation provides a silky texture that works well with the slightly warming booziness. Overall, this beer certainly blurs the line between baltic porter and imperial stout (if there is such a line), and it is yet another well-crafted, flavorful, and enjoyable beer from Foothills.","devilben02","Feb 22, 2011"

Nose is grapey/vinous and medium-dark roasted malt. Taste is smokey and roasty with less fruit in the flavor profile than in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an even, crisp carbonation and a dryish finish. Definitely a top notch Baltic Porter - smokey/roasty and not as sweet as some examples of the style, but it still doesn't touch Smutty's BP; however, it's definitely one of my favorites for the style.","Jwale73","Feb 04, 2011"

The nose comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate, spruce, light pine (the wood o' the tree), and toffee. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, bitter coffee, cocoa powder, and spruce tips. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a prickly, smooth feel. Overall, a very nice Baltic porter. 'Nuff said.","TMoney2591","0"

4.1,0.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer pours a dark brown color with an ecru foam. The smell is of slight roasted malts and chocolate not too much other than that. The smell carries on greatly into the taste of the beer as there is a nice slight roasted quality to the beer along with the malty chocolate flavor. The mouthfeel was rather light comparatively to other porters that I've had the good fortune to taste in my time. I must say that even though most everything about this beer was good, there is a nice wonderful quality that it conveys overall. It's a quality rich chocolate porter.","Vdubb86","Jan 20, 2011"

Light dried/ripe fruit notes, along with a bit of grassy hop, just a hint of smoke. Rich, sweet malt flavour, toffee and caramel, milk chocolate, faint smoke, light fruit character, mild roast. Bitterness is restrained, but comes forward with a bit of hops in the finish. Sweetness lingers. Just short of really full bodied with lowish carbonation.
