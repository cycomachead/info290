"Huge fan or porters, but hated this one"

"Not a fan of this porter"

"Nice dark. Very dark in the glass with small head. Bitter taste hits on the first sip but seems to recede as you drink. Slightly less pleasant than the Brand Dobbelbock."
""
""
"Food match: Chocolate roasted rib eye steaks with au gratin potato and roasted pumpkin, with a rich dark gravy simmering away all over that shit."
""
"O: An exemplary Baltic Porter with big aromatics, bold flavours, and a very smooth palate. Definitely lives up to its first-class reputation."

"Deep, practically black color. Fruity and sweet aroma, like prunes and molasses. Similar taste; fruity and roasted. Smokey coffee and cocoa. Bittersweet finish. Full bodied and heavy with a fairly low carbonation. You can't really taste the high alcohol content, but you'll certainly know it's there by the time you finish this great porter."

"Overall - A shockingly good porter. Full mouth flavors, great balance and complexity as this is more of a symphony vs. a few hard punches. What makes this really nice is the price of $1.99 a bottle at my local Garden Fresh. I will pick up a few of these every time I shop - pick up a few for yourself if you come across them, highly recommend! *Please note, I've updated this review, as my first bottle of this was 9 months past the best by date - it was pretty good, but was overwhelmed with astringent dark fruit flavors, and a slight balsamic-like vinegariness. A fresh bottle is a real treat, and an excellent representative of the style. I would even call it ""imperial", as the flavors are bold and mouth filling."

"Pours a very deep brown, almost a pitch black actually with about a good 1/2 finger of a beige head that settles down to a thin layering on top and sides of the glass. A decent amount of lacing is seen when sipped. Nice and frothy. Lots of roasted malt with some dark fruits for the aroma. The taste is pretty much the same with a hint of brown sugar as well as a touch of black coffee. Pretty smooth finish for this high alcohol porter (though you don't taste the alcohol at all). Over a great tasting Baltic Porter! Prosit!"

"500 ml bottle into snifter, best before 9/28/2013. Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, raisin, prune, brown sugar, molasses, light herbal, and roast/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and moderate fruity yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, dark bread, raisin, prune, brown sugar, molasses, herbal, and roast/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, toast, dark bread, roasted malt, raisin, prune, brown sugar, molasses, herbal, and roast/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and earthy hop flavors; with a a great malt/yeast balance and no cloying flavors after the finish. medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, smooth, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Baltic porter. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: This is a good porter. I was surprised for the price how well it performed."

"Pours a very dark kola hue with a luscious two finger chocolate laced head and lacing here and there quite a looker,the smell is roasted malts,red berries and booze,the mouthfeel is full bodied and moderately carbonated with tastes of roasted malts,milk chocolate and finished with a soft bittersweetness and overall quite the suprise package would drink again cheers."

"500 ml bottle, back label says best before 09.13.2014. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch and a half tan head that stayed around a while. There's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted malt, dark fruit, bittersweet chocolate, anise, and some brown sugar. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted/charred malt, dark fruit (plums, prunes, raisins), molasses, dark chocolate, brown sugar, anise, and an earthy/mineral flavor. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and smooth with a good amount of carbonation. I liked this, and at just $1.79 a bottle it's definitely worth picking up!"

"A pretty bang on Baltic Porter. Cut down a little bit of the sweetness and dial up a little bit more of roasty malt, and it would be near perfect."
""

""

"A little hot, but brewed to big strength. Swishy body with a sizzling carbonation. Good weight."

"O: This is the best porter I’ve had yet. It’s very reminiscent of an imperial stout, probably contributing to why I like it so much. Big body, sweet and malty, and at the same time easy drinking. I think the Baltic variant reigns supreme when it comes to porters. I’ve been looking for one like this I’m glad I picked it up."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with a white head that leaves behind a lot of lacing. Aroma is malty, with a chocolate and coffee like essence. In the taste, coffee and cocoa, with a mineral, hard water aspect. Minimal hops but a small coarse bitterness. Medium bodied and lightly creamy. Overall a decent beer."
""
"A nice, basic porter that delivers flavor and body without overpowering alcohol or other relatively extreme flavor profiles. This has the depth, the sweetness, the body, and the flavors of a classic styled dark ale."
""
""
""
"Good traditional Baltic Porter, it is an old recipe going back almost 150 years, so bear that on mind when comparing to today’s kick-ass American imperial Porters. I had to raise its grade after warming up."
"O: This was hyped by my local bottle shop, at $2/0.5L so I figured I couldn't go wrong. I didn't. This is in my opinion an excellent ""Smoked Imperial Porter"" with complex varieties of malt that after only one bottle I can't entirely place. The smokiness is omnipresent but not overpowering (be warned). I would buy it again and at 9.5% I think some age might mellow that smoke and bring out the earthy malts."
"Deep brown, nearly black colour with quite impressive head. Chocolate and coffee aromas with a hint of roasted notes. Slightly metallic. As the beer warms up prune aroma starts to appear and a bit of alcohol can be noted. Medium sweet, but can be considered as dry in comparison to other baltic porters. Creamy, full bodied. Medium carbonation. Very good and complex beer."

"O - Zywiec Porter starts nice with a dark pour that leads right into the subtle but forward aroma of molasses and raisins but it's hint at dry metallic cocoa in the nose explodes in flavor and feel, tarnishing the good thing this beer had going for it. It's high alcohol is surprisingly hidden well though. It's not awful and the ""metallic"" essence in beer seems to strike at my tongue more ruthlessly than most others so it could come down to more personal preference, but I'd pick most other Baltic Porters over this."
""

"this porter is world class, no bones about it. surprised and not surprised at all that this is now a Heineken brand, but whatever, that's business and this beer is outstanding regardless of corporate ties. matte black in color, thick and sturdy, not a pure white head, but light for a dark beer, and lasting with ring lacing as it sips. nose of cocoa powder, roasted barley, char, and lager yeast of all things. its dusty and European in origin, that classic old world malt vibe, and the chocolate is rich in the taste. drinkable, cold fermented (I have to imagine), and really heavy roast character, pushing burnt. its bitter and well hopped for the style too. the alcohol is invisible, which is maybe most impressive. super drinkable and it feels right at holiday time in cold weather. it also pairs wonderfully with a range of eastern European food, and can theoretically age fairly well. one of the better porters ive ever had really, distinct from the pack, and clean and simple. high quality brew right here."

"Overall, this is a rather inoffensive Baltic Porter. I'm not sure if the high ABV moderates the flavor, but this is a very smooth, drinkable beer that I just wish had a bit more character."
"o; Deservedly well-ragarded porter. Perhaps the smoothest and sweetest I have ever had."
""

""

"Pours an impenetrable black body with a small tan head with decent retention. Aromas are very malty, super sweet and chocolatey with a good amount of roastiness. Flavor is amazing. Sweet up front as the chocolate notes go from milky and sweet to darker, nuttier (I get pecans and vanilla beans) and more austere on the mid-palate before finishing with a with a lot of roastiness and warming oak barrel-like notes that linger long and luxuriously. What a great beer. Could use a fuller body to better accompany such intense flavors, but overall I love this beer."
""
""
"O - Fairly average flavourless porter. No complexity and the bitter metallic finish is very ordinary"
""
""
""
"Zywiec Porter, aged 2 years 8 months in my beer cellar, 9.5% ABV, 16.9oz bottle and poured into a Dogfish Head Chalice. Poured black with a thick brown head. Taste of bakers chocolate, roasted malt and a slightly sweet finish. The roasted malt lingers until the next taste. A medium bodied beer with a chocolate mousse like mouthfeel. It wears its age quite well and exceeded my expectations. It also goes great with s’mores. This is a wonderful example of a baltic style porter and highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass."
""
""
""
""
"Post-script: This seems to taste better the longer time I consume it over, but I'm going to blame the tipsiness dulling my senses overall."
""
""
""
""

""

""

""
""
"Overall- It seems as if this may stray from the style but it is enjoyable nevertheless. It has flaws but somehow, most of these flaws add to its character."
""
""
""
"O- There are hints of Baltic porter in there but it is very clean and light in flavor and aroma with mostly a bitter black char and iodine quality as it opens up, but it is probably the best Baltic porter for under $1.50 you can find. That doesn’t mean I will drink another one though."
""
""
"Strong but without any unpleasant alcohol taste. The fruity, licorice taste is a little weird, so I guess it won't take over Green Flash Double Stout among my favorite darks. From the 500 ml bottle bought at AJ's Fine Foods in Phoenix."
"Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""
"O: This is a very dangerous brew. It's inexpensive and drinkable, with only mild hints to suggest its actual strength. While not fantastic, it's a great way to get drunk on the cheap(ish) - I know I'd much rather drink this over some crappy Euro malt liquor."
"O- Very nice, I would refinement this and I will buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a porter for men that want to drink like manly men. It isn't notably complex, and I wouldn't consider it to be among the best I've tasted. As I often say about beers in this category, (out of respect for beers in ANY category): I ""wouldn't kick this one out of bed"". It's tasty, cheap, and unassuming. Although, I prefer sophisticated, intelligent, beautiful women- I can enjoy the ""tasty-cheap-unassuming"" type on occasion. If there are better porters on tap or in the store- by all means: buy them. However, if you're on a budget, and nothing else is up your alley- do not be ashamed to give Zywiec Porter a try."
""
""
"Overall for $2.50 I guess its not so bad. Wish I would have know it was Heineken before I got it since it has the classic ""skunked"" flavor even though it's a brown bottle..."
""
""
""
"Poured from 500 ml bottle into a pint glass, almost jet black with a nice 3 finger tan head. It smelled rich,roasted and sweet...things I like in a Porter. Taste held roasted malt with a bittersweet edge also some metallic notes and alcohol/dark chocolate flavors after each sip. Mouthfeel was medium to heavy and was what I would expect for a Baltic Porter....I would get this again as a single ( $ 1.67 ) and recommend to anyone who wants to explore Porters for a good price."
""
""
""
"This was going out on a limb a bit for me; I don't venture to the import section of the bottle store too often, and I think this is my first beer from Poland. Overall I was very pleased, very rich full beer and absurdly cheap. Pours dark with medium head. Smells very good: chocolate and cinnamon and roasted malt. Follows with rich flavor as well. Chocolate and malt, hints of coffee. No booze. Very mild metallic taste. Only thing odd to me about this is that it is called a porter. I was expecting something a little lighter weight. Good all around!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer for the price. Worth trying especially for the value but probably wouldn't recommend. 3.2/5."
"Overall not bad, a decent true Baltic region Baltic Porter, not quite up to what some of the clean and full flavored beers that are made these days, but this is from 1881 so a great beer for that time I would guess. Still tasty and drinkable, I was expected extract skunky crappy beer so this was a pleasant surprise."
""
""
"Very good porter."
""
""
""
"Overall – A pretty good Baltic porter with some nice roasted and more bitter notes."
""
""
""

"Poured roughly into a 25oz snifter, it's near-black with a tall, frothy, beige head, excellent retention and chunky lacing is left all over the glass. Aromas are pleasantly sweet with dark malts, raisin, plum, earth, slight smoke & spiciness, booze. Tastes are sweet and rich with plum, raisin, caramel, chocolate, mild smokiness, mellow roastiness, touch of spiciness & earth, booze is present but not quite hot. Mouth-feel is smooth & creamy, finishes clean. Overall, solid Baltic Porter! So glad to revisit this one, and for $1.79 a pint I definitely will hit it up again soon!"
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation levels of mid-intensity, leading to a slightly fizzy mouthfeel that gradually becomes foamy and smooth across the palate. Ethanol can be felt across the tongue during sipping, and in the back of the throat and nostrils after each swallow. Closes quite dry, with substantial stickiness lingering across the palate. I would have liked to see lower, smoother carbonation to make this more sippable given its heaviness and ethanol content, and also ""feel"" less of the ethanol burning across the palate."
""
""
""
""
"A bottle of Zywiec Porter pours a tootsie roll brown with a big foamy head. The foam has decent retention as this big beer slowly goes down. The aroma has a strong malt presence. The grain really comes through with hint of chocolate and dark fruit. On the palate some chocolate nibs prickle through. A big boozy center and finish herald what this beer is about. Some dark fruit sneaks in about midway but this beer really is about the alcohol. As others have noted, this beer isn't bad for the price ($1.49 in my case), but I would like to see a little more depth to mask the alcohol a bit."
"Overall this beer is OK. It's a 9.5% beer, and unfortunately you taste each and every percentage of alcohol in this beer. I wouldn't go out of my way to get this again."
"500 ml bottle. Pours dark brown with thick, long lasting, creamy, brown head and nice lacing. Aroma is of bready malt, cacao, brown sugar and hints of dark fruit. Body is full and creamy. Taste is roasted, toasted malt, cacao, brown sugar, dark fruit and a good dose of earthy hops. Finish is long, bitter-sweet. Solid Baltic Porter."
""
"If you can get your hands on this, do. It's a great porter for a great price. Remember, it's 9.5% ABV! Bottoms up, people."
"Overall this starts off pretty good, but the aftertaste really sort of lets it all down unfortunately. It's at least drinkable and I could have this again for the right price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This has a great flavor. Really, a smooth, full-bodied porter, full of those fantastic flavors."
""
"O - I drank a Black Boss Porter prior to this beer (both Polish Baltic Porters) and I am left a little underwhelmed I had this one afterwards. If it came down to recommending this beer, I think I'd pass. It's a good strong beer, but it has too much of an afterbite that doesn't appeal much to me."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty typical for porter. Generic roasted / nutty scent and flavor. For those who like enormous amounts of foam, you won't find a lot going on here. It wasn't a problem for me, but some look down on that kind of beer. Not a game changer, but worth it if you can get it for $8 or $9 per sixer."
"I was definitely pleased with this beer. A good fall/winter brew. I could see pairing this with some Polish cuisine. Zywiec Porter is certainly worth a try."
"O: Really a nice porter. Think this is my first Baltic Porter and I like it. Very clean, malty, roasty, just underbalanced (in a good way) by hop flavor. For the price it is hard to beat and I'll buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like to think that this is a fair represntation of the style and its tradition. So I appreciated the beer as much as I liked it."
"Overall - I'm not too familiar with the Baltic Porter style, having only one previously, but this one seems like a good one. As a basic porter, it's certainly strong. For the price I paid, it's a definite future buy, and it's peaked my interest in this specific style."
""
""
""
"Pours black and thick. Can't see a damn thing through it. Not much head, but what is there is tan and likes hanging onto the glass. Smells sweet, malty, roast coffee, some notes of.. cookies. Not much hoppy aroma, but it's a porter, that's more or less the style. Tastes very sweet, malty, chocolate cookies, slight bitterness on the back end so it doesn't finish too sour. Mouthfeel is heavy and creamy, very nice. Overall, it's a great porter with lots of flavor and you can't really taste the high alcohol. I'll be looking for this one again."
""
""
""
"Overall: very interesting porter, quite sweet but with a variety of malts. The 9.5% ABV certainly rears its head, but not in an unpleasant way."
""
"Pours the color of burnt molasses with a modest tan head. Bubbles of carbonation coat the length of the glass, giving it a cola-like appearance. Aroma smells mildly of dark fruit, alcohol, and a hint of chocolate. Flavor is strongly alcoholic, accompanied by dark fruit and a metallic twinge. Warming reveals some coffee and anise as well. The front end is a little on the fierce side, but drinkable.The saving grace here comes on the back end, where a wave of bitter chocolate and smoke sweep the palate clean. The metallic flavor never quite goes away though, which is a little off-putting. The mouthfeel is interesting--slick and moderately viscous, which suits the style well, but the relatively high carbonation mitigates the body some and negates what could have been an excellent mouthfeel. I have limited experience with Baltic porters, but I've found them to be an interesting animal, and this is no exception: rich, roasty, and flavorful, but infused with an industrial character that confuses more than it charms. Zywiec Porter comes off as a beer I want to really like, but ultimately leaves me merely bemused."
""
""
""
"This beer pours out a deep brown color with two fingers of mocha head that retain quite nicely. The aroma is sweet and roasty, with chocolate and dark fruits. The taste is smooth and roasty at first, and then a kick of alcohol and dark fruits comes in. It finishes mocha smooth with some more of the dark fruits. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and farily high carbonated, and the drinkability is good. An interesting Baltic Porter that I imagine is a bit more classical and true-to-style than the Baltic Porters that American brewers put out that are practically imperial stouts."
"O - Perhaps I got a bad bottle, it came from Dan Murphy's so it's entirely possible. Actually got worse as it warmed and the offensiveness came to the fore."
""
"O: This beer is very drinkable compared to other beers in the style because its alcohol is well hidden from the taste and it seems to be a little lighter-bodied."
""
"O: Overall decent, normal."
""
""
"Overall, I am glad I had this beer. It maybe an intimidating beer to those unaccustomed to stouts and porters, but it is a welcoming friend and companion on a chilly April night."
"O: This is the best Porter I've yet to consume!!! it has the aroma i want in a dark, the taste i enjoy sipping on!! high octane in certain aspects....overall I would enjoy this again when i'm in the mood to go to the dark side!!"
"Overall: for a few bucks you would have to be kidding yourself not to buy it. It might be an acquired taste for some but I felt it right after one sip. Salud!"
"O: Both the taste and the smell of this beer have a lot of complexity but the high ABV is not as well hidden as I might have hoped. This beer is definitely a sipping beer and not one you would want as a session beer. I enjoyed the beer and the flavor/aroma was very enjoyable. My first Polish beer and quite a nice one with an exceptional value at $1.95 for a 500 ml bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Call this one a porter, imperial porter, imperial stout or whatever... I call it fantastic!!! Cost me $2.99! I think I just found my new favorite go to Imperial Stout/Porter. I can't believe it took me this long to grab one of these! makes me proud to be Polish!!!"
""
""
""
"thanks redliner8!"
"O: this beer has a boozy character I often notice in Eastern European beers, at least with higher ABVs; this is usually a weakness but it fits in well with the flavor profile in this nice Baltic Porter. Improved with warming. Well worth seeking out."
""
""
"O- Very strong and flavorful. I am very surprised by this porter. The price definitely cannot be beat. I've had quite a few porters and this is one of my new favorites."
""
""
"This is is the first baltic porter that I have tried and it was pretty good. I will definitely look out for others in this style. It was also good value at $2.99 for a 500ml bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is an enjoyable porter- if you see it available worth a taste."
""
""
"The taste improves as it warms, as with so many beers. Burnt coffee and toffee up front with licorice in the middle. Bitterness from spicy hops and the roast follow. The alcohol is barely detectable in flavor, but there. A nice, smooth body."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a nearly opaque brown/black color with two fingers of delicate, brown-tinted foam. The fizz soon receded to a collar that left broken curtains of sliding lacing. The aroma was light, mostly roasted malt and hints of coffee. The flavors were much more distinct and very ‘dark.’ I tasted lots of roasted malt, blackened bread, hints of toffee, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and a lingering note of carbon and burnt toast. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium/full and the carbonation light enough to add to the richness of the experience. A robust Baltic porter that speaks of long, Polish, winter nights…"
""
"O: It was my first Baltic Porter but if they all taste like this I would buy more. Enjoyable and I would recommend to anyone who likes porters/stouts/strong ales."
""
"O - A fantastic porter. Especially for its price. Lots of complexity and dangerously drinkable. Will be drinking again."
""
""
""
"A total steal, I will get these every single time I go to the store I got these. I want a case."
"Overall – very good brew. It’s got a lot to think about while tasting, and even at the end of it still tastes great."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The high ABV is almost not noticable. A nice well balanced Baltic Porter."
""
"O: Enjoyed this beer, wasn't expecting much from it, but I would buy again."
"Overall: I haven't really ventured into the porter world of beers, but this one was enjoyable. Definitely a sipper due to the high ABV, but well worth the time to enjoy this Northern European brew."
"O/D-$2.19 for a 500 ml is a deal but I think this beer is pretty poor. Not enough of the roasted coffee and chocolate. Booze too evident and too involved in the flavor. Flavor finishes poorly as well. Don't regret trying it but would not buy or even drink this again."
"No matter what, I don't think I could ever turn down a new Baltic porter...like this one. It pours a very dark ruby-brown topped by over a finger of dusty dark tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, molasses, spruce tips, dark chocolate powder, and dense, resinous pine in the background, melding with the darker notes, yet still expressing itself pretty strongly. The taste emphasizes the dark chocolate and pine, with the roast and molasses pulling up in a joint backup session. Some balsa makes its way in there as well. Combined, it almost comes across as too roasty, too charred even, for its own good. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice BP, but things seem to have been taken to excess when moderation would have been the proper path. Had they toned this down slightly, it would probably have turned out very well."
"O- A well done baltic porter. On the lighter side for the style, but very easy to drink. The 9.5% abv is not detected at all, just 30 min into this beer. A great buy for $3. Simple but worth a try."
"Medium bodied, maybe a little lighter. Healthy dose of carbonation. Similar to Okocim in that I wish it was just a little thicker. Warming, but no problems drinking this one."
"Overall- A great success this is such a great beer. Cheers!"
"M: Slides down well for a porter, you don't have to fight it much. Good warming and decent carbonation level."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson brown with a 2 inch khaki head that stays at a 1 inch puffy cap. Thick foamy rings of lace stick to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, caramel, and some chocolate aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, cocoa powder, and an off metallic taste. The metallic taste pretty much kills this one for me. Mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. A low level of carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Ovearall, this would be a pretty good baltic porter if the metallic taste wasn't so overwhelming. As it is, I couldn't even finish a bottle of this one."
"O: Overall this is a fairly good beer, for the price and the ABV it is a decent drink, but lacking many flavors, I would find other beers in the style for a bench mark, but none the less a good offering."
"O: This is my first Baltic Porter, wow! Great beer to finish the day with."
"O - A fantastic porter with tons of character and flavor. Complex but well balanced, with a high drinkability at this abv."
" laced with caramel and definite hints of alcohol. As it warmed some nice flavors of roasted malts and a robust grain and bread like flavor with just a touch of chocolate started to come through. The alcohol was the biggest factor here and needed to be reigned in a tad. A bit of a thin feel for something that I thought would be so big, almost had an ale like quality to it. Nice caramel malt sweetness could be detected under the alcohol with an ever so slight hoppy presence in the back. Very smooth and great carbonation led to a nice frothy feel"
"The brew pours near black, and is capped by a filmy tan head, depositing rings of lace. The nose is mostly roasty with underlying notes of dark fruit. Flavor-wise, it is mostly nice, featuring notes of roast, cocoa and chicory, but it has a finish that I disdain. It gets very very bitter on the finish, acrid really, and has a lingering burn. The feel is good through most of the quaff, but again, it takes a turn for the worse on the finsh. Overall this is an underachieving brew."
"Pound-for-Pound this is the king of beers!"
"Overall this is a pretty damn tasty brew. I would happily drink this again. I wonder if this is distributed down here."
"O- this beer has everything going for it. cheap, strong and tasty. great length, and a great smell. tastes really nice, but a little more one dimensional compared to the smell, however the lower rating is purely a comparison to the nose. definitely worth trying, and a beer i often enjoy when it gets colder."
"This beer pours a medium bodied dark chocolate brown in color with a one finger khaki head. It appears to be more of a black color once fully poured. It smells of dark chocolate, lightly roasted coffee, and it has an interesting creaminess to it. It tastes of coffee with cream, bitter chocolate, and has a subtle roast flavor that eminates. You don't pick up any alcohol at all, which is impressive all things considered. The unfortunate thing is this, after awhile you start to get some pretty heavy metallic flavors. You feel that you're drinking rustor something of that nature. It's a killer for a beer that would otherwise be pretty decent."
"O/D - Couldn't have too many in a night but it was quite a tasty, smooth Baltic Porter. Solid."
"O: Too boozy and harsh to be all that enjoyable. The metal wasn't doing much for me either."
"O - A decent but not outstanding brew."
"The beer starts out great with appearance and smell but falls short in every other category after that. What needs to be addressed first is the metallic aftertaste."
"O: The best porter that I've had, even though I can only think of two others. A nice change of pace for me."
"D/O- One enjoyable ride. The high abv does not drink as such...so good I just want to gulp it all down in a hurry."
"D: Alcohol is well hidden but can't get over the metal/copper taste."
"D - pass, don't care for the Belgian flavor or the strong alcohol front."
"D - This stuff is quite drinkable. Really solid mouthfeel and a great appearance. That metallic finish though I just cant get past. Such a shame though. Still, I enjoyed it."
"Not really impressed with the aroma or taste. To over the hill in flavor and aroma. To bitter and sour for a porter. The big turn off was the aroma first, then the taste. Not close to a great or even good, average Porter!"
"Drinkability is pretty nice despite the abv. Heck you can't tell the 9.5 at all here. Aywiec hides it well."
"Next time I should drink this with a blind fold or in the dark. The taste and smell will surely transport me to fantastic places far and wide: places full of fellowship, exotic women, warm sunsets, and hearty living. The hefty level of alcohol will doubtlessly help speed that journey!"
"This was probably my new 'key beer' of the Baltic Style- the specific beer you remember when recollecting a particular style. Glorious."
"Dark brown, medium head that really sticks around for a while. Lacing is thin, but it clings OK. The smell is somewhat bitter roasted coffee, malt, prune and raisin. Taste is powerful and I wasn't too sold on it at first. Bitter tannin flavors are very sharp behind the wallop of roasted malt. The overall effect is, well, bitter. Bitter and then dry. There is also a ""burnt"" taste. Not smoky, burnt. But it has redeeming qualities. There are good flavors lurking around: cocoa, coffee, caramelized dark brown sugar and the dark fruits mentioned above. This is not an easy drinking brew for the timid drinker. This would have to be an acquired taste, much drier and more bitter than countless other porters I've guzzled over the years. The ABV is obviously staggering, though the booze is almost completely hidden in the powerful flavor."
"D - It's a fairly drinkable porter for its ABV. Go for it."
"Recommended, but not if you have to wake up early the next day."
"IGA sells it three for five dollars. It's worth the price. I'm glad it's not that well known yet. except in ethnic neighborhoods. I can always find it when needed."
"D-Very easy to drink a few of these, the alcohol will creep up on you. Nice change of pace from American versions. At under $3 a bottle at my local store, not a bad deal."
"Taste: here the beer fails. The body is really thin. The flavor strongly bitter and rough from dark roasted malt and.hops. ends with strong mineral flavored hops. As it warms it gets better, but never good."
"Pours a nice dark black, with a lingering tan head. Beer smells great, can smell all the basics of a good porter. Fits the baltic porter category well. THe high alcohol content is not terribly noticeable and doesn't distract from a very smooth porter taste. Received this as a free sample and would gladly search it out again in the future."
"Pours a dark, dark red color with a thin cap of tan head. A strong medicinal/alcohol aroma dominates with notes of roasted malt and caramel. The taste is syrup-sweet, lots of caramel malt flavor and a LOT of alcohol. I know it's 9.5%, but I've had big beers that hide it better. The finish is lingering and astringent and kinda harsh. Drinkability is so-so. Looking at the other reviews, I think I'm in the minority here, but I really didn't care for this beer."
"Pours a nice creamy black. Some light bronze/mocha head. Smells of roasted malt, coco and some sweet nutty/cola thing, too. Rich smoke/burnt malt flavor and some dry chocolate powder, like Ghirardelli chocolate. Hint of wine-like acidity and very faint hints of malt sweetness. The taste of this beer is amazing, the mouth feel leaves me a little dry, but the carbonation levels are just right. The texture is light-medium. Definitely some malt and booze notes come to light once this warms up a bit. This is a pretty damn enjoyable beer, and the price ain't too shabby either. beats the hell out of a 22oz of Pabts. I imagine stocking up on this beer when going to a cabin in the winter. This beer gets straight to the point. This is the kind of beer I imagine when people say, ""It'll put hair on your knuckles."""
"For the price, this is a wonderful strong Euro porter. Nice enough head to start, but settling a bit flat, the beer pours nearly jet black and leaves no lacing. Gritty, soft roasty aroma. Starts off with bitter chocolate flavors, giving way to subtle coffee liqueur, slight molasses, and smooth roasty, charcoal flavors. Bordering stout character, but decidedly porter. Not the least bit bite from carbonation or sour/acidity. The alcohol is certainly felt but its presence otherwise is wonderfully woven into the taste - okay, a little bit of its warmth rises up in the aftertaste. Great beer all things considered. Will buy again for sure."
"A tasty beer that certainly doesn't feel like 9%. Well flavoured."
"alcohol is integrated very well. a bit of a metallic flavor and light body hinder its score here, but its tremendous value and above average scores make this a great buy any time."
"Definitely will be picking up more next time I see it."
"Overall very happy with the beer, it costs less than half of other 500mL options in it's class ($2.09 at Hy Vee Spirit Shop)...really want to call this an Imperial Porter, it could be labeled as one in my opinion.... very good value...Try this one"
"D-At $2.99 a bottle, this is a steal."
"Cheers..."
"I bought this on accident thinking it was some other beer I'd read a good review about, but it turned out to be a nice surprise. Enjoyable and tasty, but one bottle is enough for me, especially since I drank this during the summer."
"D: A really good porter that I wish I'd tried sooner. High ABV hurts drinkability a little, but this is a very nice porter that goes light on sweetness and big on roast."
"Completely breaks the promise of the appearance and the up front aroma. It just doesn't taste like something that should be consumed. I threw it out."
"Very dark brown, but with faint, clear, ruby edges. A soft pour produced 3/4 inch of thick, tan foam that stuck around for quite a while. Clumpy sheets of lace at first, followed by spottier stickage. Fruity nose, plums and raisins, backed up by grainy malt, chocolate and roast, slight alcohol, anise and a hint of mint. Full bodied, but not heavy, with soft carbonation and creamy texture. Very light astringency, plus some alcohol flavour and warmth. Nice flavour profile, with plenty of dried fruits (figs, raisins, and the like) along with dark, roasted grains that provide notes of chocolate, toffee, and a bit of coffee. Bitterness seemed to originate partially from the dark malts, providing some depth to this characteristic that isn't present when hops are the only source. It's balanced towards sweetness, but isn't cloying at all. Based on the mouthfeel and alcohol content, I'd be surprised if there weren't adjunct sugars present -- but this only makes the beer more drinkable, similar to some higher abv Belgians that retain some lightness of texture. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and robust. Makes itself known while still being quite drinkable for the ABV. Overall, a top notch Polish brew. This and the Okocim porter make for a good one two punch!"
"Conclusion: We're drinking this fairly close to the ""best by"" date, so this may have faded a little. That's my only real complaint here. It feels just a bit muted. Otherwise, good flavors, and this hides the alcohol well. Would try again."
"I poured this into a Southampton pint glass. The colour is a deep black body, off-white head with some good lacing and decent retention. Smell is chocolate-coffee, and taste and mouthfeel is a velvety milkiness with some hoppiness interspersed within. Decent drinkability and a solid entry from Poland."
"D - I could easily go through another one of these if I was ready to stay in for the night. this is a fantastic beer at a shockingly cheap price"
"Overall, I enjoyed it a lot. One of the most drinkable and strongest Baltic Porters I have had."
"drinkability is very good - the light body with the great flavors screams drink me drink me - just watch yourself this brew is 9.5abv"
"D: A solid porter, one of the better high alcohol porters I've had. Pretty drinkable. Strong in alcohol content but doesn't seem like it when you're drinking it."
"a beer that has a faint malt quality of a porter with added sugar and alcohol. looks darker but lean in malt. nose is toastiness and a lot of booze and finger nails. has a grit that is sort of not baltic grit but protein-y grit and smokeiness combined. bitter finish that is a great quality of earth. palate sort of burns the tongue of sugar and alcohol. after having a go at polish baltic porters i would say this is in the bottom third. great if you're looking for something that goes down hot, bitter, and boozy. it much that destroys the body. one thing i will give the polish. the beers are exactly the same cold as in room temperture. so i probably more interesting to have at about 55 degrees."
"An alright porter, but definitely not my favorite."
"Notes: $1.80 a bottle? What the hell. You could easily pay $6 for a beer this size that doesn't even taste as good. This one tastes great, will get you drunk fast (if you want), and its from Poland. What more could you want?"
"Yeah, enjoyable enough. Just lacks depth and strength of character. There's a niggling thought that this bottle is a bit old, so standby for a re-review in the future some time."
"Medium to heavy body that is still creamy as well as smooth."
"Not an impressive brew at all, tastes burnt to a crisp."
"A very enjoyable porter that goes down easy and hides the alcohol well. A very nice beer."
"Overall: Overall, if you like a good porter, this will not disappoint you. Great flavor, great smell, and a great deal. I highly recommend this beer."
"Overall, this is a badass beer. And the price is right, so I'll be buying this often. There are some definite treasures and bargains to be found among Eastern European beers."
"Pours a deep, warm, opaque sable with a thick and fairly persistent light tan head. Aroma is rich, oily and smoky with an overtone of molasses and a hint of miso. Smoky flavor is oily with hints of molasses and just a touch of sweetness, as well as a bit of hop bitterness. Texture is quite fizzy, leaving behind a nice tingle."
"Syrupy cola and coffee malts, with maybe a touch of brown sugar hit the palate first. The middle has cola nuts and some molasses. The finish is roastd blood and tin. The finish on this beers taste and palate kills any hopes of me buying this beer again. All metal and blood. Sounds like an 80's thrash metal album title."
"Overall: A Wonderful beer on a cold day, and an excellent example of this style. At less than $4.00 per bottle, it is also one of the best values I know of for this level of ale. Try this if you haven't!"
"Overall - No wonder it was only $0.97 for a bottle. Won't get this again."
"500ml bottle purchased at Whole Foods for 2 bucks and some change. Impenetrable black in the glass with a thin tan head atop. Smells of raisins and chocolate. A bit prune-like, even. Oatmeal with dried fruit. The taste is roasty with an acidic twang, like French roast coffee. Dried fruit flavors reveal themselves mid-palate, along with substantial roasty bitterness. There's a touch of alcohol too, but it's surprisingly well-hidden. Medium-bodied, rather dry and bitter on the whole, this is fairly easy to drink despite the intense flavor. The finish is sharply bitter and roasty, leaving a note of anise on the tongue between sips. Drinkability is marred slightly by the intense roasted bitterness, but it's a great beer overall."
"Oh - and as for 'bang for your buck' - a 500 ml bottle is only just over $2 at [the best beer store in the US] State Line Liquors in Elkton, MD. Why is this notable? Because this beer is a) a European import and b) better than most Baltic porters that come in 22 oz. bombers for $8-10 a pop. Dig out some change from your car's ashtray and pick up a few bottles of this, you won't regret it!"
"I am impressed by how it is presenting after a year. At only slightly over $2 for a 500 ml bottle, you can't go wrong with this--it is I think one of the best beer bargains around for the taste it delivers."
"Nose is malt with a burnt caramel, cocoa or burnt molasses overtone. Taste was nice with some coffee, chocolate, mainly dark and a roastiness. Mouthfeel was average, no let down. It did have a bit of an aftertaste that annoyed me.Drinkability was average."
"Nicely done. It's like a grittier version of the Sam Smith's Taddy porter, meant to be enjoyed by someone who likes to work with their hands. This would go well with strong, sharp cheddar and bold meats."
"My first Baltic Porter experience, thanks to MDS. Thanks a bunch Mike. My first impression of this beer was a good one. The pour was like motor oil, opaque, almost black, with just the smallest amount of light visible. The head was mocha, and was thick, with good retention. In the nose, lots was going on. Huge roasty notes filled the room. I could litetrally smell them while standing away from the glass. Upon further examination, coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, toffee and tobacco were all screaming at me. Very appealing. Silky coffee and chocolate filled my mouth, leaving tingling sensation. Burnt tobacco and roasted malt also very enjoyable. Bitter hops chocolate finish, and the alcohol was noticable as it warmed, but it was good. Definitely a sipper, and certainly worth of the average rating it has received. A very good porter, probably the best one I have had to date. This is a style I will definitely keep an eye out for . Thanks for sharing Mike!"
"500 mL bottle, best by 5/31/09; sampled 5/13/09. It pours damn near totally black, topped with two inches of thick brown froth that leaves nice lacing. Gentle and aromatic, with clean roastiness, blue and blackberry, licorice, mild hops, milk chocolate and a light fruitiness. Roasted and chocolate malts on the palate, with licorice, dark berries, coffee, malt sweetness, nuttiness, sturdy bitterness and a gentle warmth. The body is light and smooth, with low carbonation and a nice, dry finish. This is a great brew - so completely balanced all around and quite cheap to boot. Definitely one to revisit."
"Fabulous."
"500 ml from Whole Foods, Arlington - a deal at $2.99"
"Very tasty brew, and at $3 a 500ml (ie a pint), a good buy for a hammerhead beverage."
"Pours a dark, root-beer brown. It's quite dark, but without the opacity of some stronger stouts I've tried. It smells dry fruit sweet and (skeptical as I was when reading this in other reviews) soy sauce-y. Tastes really nice, there's a perfectly roasted flavor, not too burnt-bitter. The body is smooth and slightly carbonated, and the alcohol content is well hidden. Keep that alcohol content in mind and designate this as a sipper, you'll be just fine."
"Dark, with a full head. Thick, chewy, but not overly sweet. You would never know this is 9.5% The alcohol is well integrated & the brew slides down easy. Not a favorite of mine, but a very good beer & when taking into account it's modest price- a real bargain."
"Wow I was not expecting this to be any good! To my surprise this is an awesome porter -- really smooth roasted malty flavors with not-too-dark coffee, sweet bourbon underneath, and the alcohol content is a joke --- you'd never guess it from tasting it. Very thick and creamy but not syrupy. I love being surprised. DeCicco's had this for $1.50 a bottle and I'll be getting more for sure!"
"D: This is a very drinkable Baltic Porter, even more so because of its conventional price and availability."
"D - Despite the noticeably high alcohol level, this is not necessarily relegated to sipping status. I drank this more quickly than I intended to (and got a bit light headed in the process) but I didn't regret the 30-40 minutes that I spent with this one, although I did find my self shaking my head and thinking ""holy crap! That one really kicked my ass!"" Good beer! And for the $1.95 that I picked the bottle up for, I'll be coming back for more!"
"Drinkability: This is your go to baltic porter. As i find myself getting into the porters, this seems to make the mold for what baltic porters should be like. Big bottle and high abv means 2 of these per session max. Still great and definately worth the $1.69 for the 500ml bottle!! See out now!"
"D - This is a great example of a Baltic Porter. It tastes great and looks good, too."
"D: There is not a strong alcohol taste, and it is incredibly tasty. Can put down several of these."
"this beer is quite smooth, very drinkable and enjoyable. I paid $1.79 for a 500ML bottle of this and it turned out to be a good investment. This is a porter I would gladly drink again"
"D- So good. Great depth of flavours, yet so clean! The price point won't hurt the wallet either--great."
"Pours more like a stout than a porter. Wonderful thick creamy head. Very very creamy mouth feel, something I usually don't pay attention to, but this one is good. Roasty flavor and chocolate bitterness and balanced with sweetness. Alcohol bite and not a session beer what so ever. Recommended if you can find it. Very affordable, I paid $2.19 a bottle."
"The mediocre coffee hints and over-roasted malts could be improved upon, but it is amazing to me how a 9.5% ABV import of this caliber can be at this price point."
"Pours a deep mahogany (almost black in color, but when held to the light, there is a clear ruby tint) with a creamy tan froth. Characteristics of Molasses, Dark berries, Chocolate, Coffee, Raisins, Roasted Malts, Caramel, & a bit of Alcohol show on the nose. The beer definitely has a weigh to it, but dry crispness (classic baltic porter). Great flavors with a bit of alcohol sweetness and tingle. A great beer (especially for only $2) and one that every dark beer fan should try!"
"Drinkability is great at first, inviting big sips, not dainty ones. Starts kickin' like a Polish draft horse as it warms, though. I can imagine a bar full of Eastern European dockworkers getting pretty rowdy on this stuff on a winter night. Great stuff. Really like an imperial brown ale with its big body and earthy malts."
"Everything that a baltic porter should be,this is up near Okocim and Synebrychoff. Excellent buy, consistently excellent quality. Very highly recommended."
"A really nice baltic porter, not usually a fan, but this was a winner. Dark fruits weren't too overwhelming up front with the chocolate and roastiness taking the foreground near the finish. Very complex with every component working, fantastic!"
"Drinkability: this would be a great session beer. At 9.5%, it would have to be a pretty short session. This stuff is great."
"Drinkability isnt too high, as the abv is prominent. Not a sipper but FAR from a session brew. Nice example of a baltic porter however. I will buy this one again."
"Could go for a little more complexity, but a really satisfying baltic porter, and a very welcome alternative to the parade of lagers from the region."
"Overall I was very impressed with this beer. Be sure to give it a chance to warm as the flavors really come into their own and the complexity mounts. Worth a shot."
"D: Not a beer to have more than one in a given night. It's good, but the alcohol is definitely there on the palate. This is what I would call a Nightcap beer."
"D- Surprisingly easy to drink, not as much of a sipper as I had thought. My favorite baltic porter so far."
"a testing beer. so good, yet you have to work to drink it. well worth the effort i must say. at 9.5% this is a big beer, but there is no hesitation at finishing the bottle. the best beer ive had in a while."
"surprisingly drinkable despite the alcohol"
"Roast malt, dark fruit and Hershey's chocolate syrup. A little thin and lacks depth hinted at in the aroma."
"Nice big mouthfeel."
"Thick, rich body. Great creamy carbonation. Warming alcohol on the back of the palate."
"The appearance is a very dark brown almost black color with a pleasant aroma with a subtle fruit smell? Prune? The head was about a knuckle high that did dissipate rather quick, and the lacing abundant and sticky. The taste had a bit of Caramel and a little bit of tin for added goodness : ) It is very drinkable and for the AC 9.5 to feel smooth as you drink? Excellent. I am buying this one again.. Bet on that!!"
"good beer would drink more if i had them."
"Drinkability: Very very good--perhaps my favorite in the style. I have not had this for a while and it is still a delicious favorite. The alcohol is fairly well masked, but because of the high ABV, two is my limit."
"Notes: A good Porter with a good mouth feel and a well masked ABV. I don't over pay for this here,so I will pick it up when ever I get the chance. I know it is not as complex as others yet still a fine Porter."
"Watch a blustery wind whipupsomewhite caps and enjoy this"
"Drinkability: I had just drunken the taddy porter yesterday, so this was a bit underwhelming compared tot hat. The alcohol content is obviously much higher. Its a solid brew all round, but not as complex or overwhelming as the more $ craft brewers. However I will probably purchase this again the price is very reasonable. Perhaps it will become may new get drunk beer 9%abv tastes decent $1.75 per bottle."
"D - Again, decent for the price point, but by no means near the best porters I have had. No real reason to revisit short of saving a few bucks over better, more widely available crafts."
"Maybe I was hoping for those chocolaty, coffee-ey notes in craft baltics, but this beer was worth not a cent more than its 1.99"
"Picked up a single for $2.99 at the Allston Wine Shop in Star Market. Poured into a Ceres Brewery stemmed glass. Dark brown color. Immense tan head that never seemed to fade. Nice smell of molasses and roasted barley were there. A bit of a bitterness at first sip, then sweetness as it goes down. Dark chocolate and milky coffee are the flavors that stood out for me. Nice malt backbone. I really like the flavor of this beer. Hearty enough to be a nice porter, but smooth enough to be very drinkable. Definitely a steal at that price."
"The taste is rich, with a lot of strong, complex flavour, but it is very smooth the elements integrated and balanced very nicely. It has a rich character of prune, chocolate, port, and burnt sugar with hints of licorice, black pepper, toast, and coffee. It's smooth and a little oily but less than one might expect for this richness. It has a warmth to it, but the high alcohol is not noticeable at all except in the silky body and warm sweetness. I find that this just edges out its fellow Polish porter, Okocim porter."
"Deep deep chestnut brown color, not remotely transparent. Coffee colored head only about 1 1/2 fingers high. Mostly sweet malty smells coming from this one. Dark, roasted coffee malt taste to it. Strong. Definitely on the sweet side more than bitter, but I am liking it and not a porter drinker! Pretty residual on the pallet, little chewy. Real easy to drink, great roasty dark malty flavors makes this really easy to enjoy! Definitely a great buy for the price!"
"Pours a dark brown, almost black color with burgundy edges at the base and a thick foamy beige head. Roasted malty aroma with hazelnut, chocolate, caramel, toffee, syrup and alcohol notes. Roasted chocolate malty flavor with hints of toffee, caramel, nut and oatmeal with a nice dry, bitter finish."
"d: Split with my dad and we both loved this one! Definitely one we will revisit. Thanks Scott!"
"A very good and fairly sweet porter, this is not one of my favorites in the style, but a surprisingly good beer for the price."
"D: This goes down very easy and is a very nice way to end the night. A solid porter and a good deal for the price. Recommended."
"Err, what was I saying? Anyway, the fruit background is really surprising in such a cheap brew. I swear, sometimes it feels like porter, somtimes a doppelbock dunkel, and somethings a porter mixed with malt liquor. Will be revisiting, though the mouthfeel is a bit thin."
"Pours very dark brown with thin tan head that immediately dissipates to a dissapointing nothing. The aroma comes to the rescue with a warm roasted malt, chocolate, and light alcohol aroma. Good flavor that is robust roasted malt initially and slowly transitions to a very long lived bitter malty aftertaste that has a burnt malt and licorice flavor. This flavor got to be a slight bit medicinal for me as the beer warmed, hurting its drinkability. This maybe an issue just for me, as I don't really like licorice that much. The mouthfeel is just what a big porter should be - full bodied, smooth, and well carbonated with an alcoholic finish. Nicely done here. This is a decent taster, maybe best split with a friend, unless you want the full flavor and effect of a 500 ml strong porter high alcohol content. Not a bad thing at all, but I am not always in the mood for that much of something this flavorfull."
"Taste is sweet and malty and offers little nuance. Bit of spiciness on the close helps the finish however. A bit sweet and simple, pour a little at a time to enjoy the hops and the flavor/feel which improves through a bit of foam."
"D: That I'm Polish might have something to do with it, but I could pair with all sorts of cuisine: kielbasa, boiled dinners, smoked barbecue, and even something like a roast beef sandwich. It's filling but doesn't make you feel like you've surfeited."
"Mouthfeel is very sweet and carbonation is not all that high, which I find a good thing for a beer this strong. Very drinkable! A very solid Baltic Porter from Poland."
"The taste is quite pronounced, strong, and characteristic of the style. There are some charred notes, lots of roasted grains, chocolate and caramels, lots of toffee, an assertive bittering hop presence, and a boozy metallic and toffee taste. The beer has a strong fermented brown sugar character as well, and it comes through noticeably because the beer doesn't mask its ABV at all. The beer is strong, it is a sipping type beer, but it is warming and creamy. The metallic qualities fade a bit as the beer warms. The aftertaste has a definite throaty ABV burn, and you will know that you were drinking a beer with a high alcohol content. Not bad, but not for all occasions either."
"Well worth finding, this one came from Hammersmith (London)."
"Poured an almost jet black, with just a touch of a head. I love how black it is and the smell was very nice and chocolate. At first taste it was a very nice porter... chocolate and coffee, but then it got a bit different. It had a touch of a fruity taste, and I'm still not sure exactly how to describe it. Once the fruit flavor passes, unfortunately the finish is a bit metallic. I think it's the 9.5% that I was finally tasting. All in all it's not bad, but there are other porters I like much better, and have a much better price, and at 9.5, I really wouldn't have more than just the one."
"Zywiec Porter is a great porter. It's full and chocolatey. The malt flavor borders on perfection. The relatively high alcohol is superbly hidden in sweetness and an extremely creamy mouthfeel. It's not heavily carbonated. The beer just tastes wonderfully rich. It's the sort of beer that I could drink all the time. I believe this is my first Polish beer, and I'm extremely happy with it. It's dark and sticky, like a Porter should be. The flavor has big chocolate and caramel with a dry bittering hop finish. It certainly leaves a coating in your mouth, but it's an enjoyable coating. The feel is really wonderful. I would love for this beer to grow in popularity and distribution."
"The coffee tones here are powerful and numerous. There is also the obvious dark malt and dry chocolate notes followed by a slightly chalky and metallic finish. The texture is molasses thick and silky smooth. Alcohol for days. This is not everyday drinking stuff and more than a couple will put you six feet under pretty quickly. Quality stuff though, and the price cannot be beaten."
"Good beer, great for the style, but there's one major flaw that consumes me when I drink it. Pours a wonderful black with a smallish off-white head. Aroma of coffee and smoldering firewood. Palate is thick and inviting, full, and leaves a nice film on the tongue. Flavor is of dark wood, floral hops, bitter chocolate, and then, out of nowhere, I get the unmistakable flavor of oxidized metal. That metallic finish ruined the whole experience. I wish I could shut off my taste buds just before the end of the flavor experience. Maybe it was a bad bottle; if so, I'll rerate."
"D: On the whole, this is a drinkable beer. It has some slightly strange characteristics, but remains likable."
"D: Good drinkability considering the 9.5% which is non-detectable and considering the price makes it that much better."
"The taste is strong and assertive in a classic Porter style. I'm tempted to call it unrefined, but fortunately it's a bit more subtle than that with a slight anise undertone as you get deeper in the bottle. With an ABV of 9.5 and a silky luxurious mouthfeel this is veering into Imperial Stout territory (and would not rate as highly there), but as a Porter it's an out-loud eye-brow raiser."
"Wow. Brown, nearly black pour, with a squatty brown head that quickly dissipates. Rich aroma of coffee, roasted malt, licorice, and alcohol. Dense, roasted malt up front with cocoa and cognac flavors. Moves into cream, coffee and anise, which is swept up with an alcohol warmer."
"Way too drinkable and I am fully impressed with fine Porter that I just stumbled upon. And it's a rather hefty 9.5 ABV to boot...cheers!"
"Reviewed on 4/15/08. Bottle. Pours a dark black with a pretty dark, creamy tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of chocolate and faint coffee and roast. Flavor strongly of coffee and roast, some chocolate. Rather boozy too, especially as it warmed. Good beer. 7/5/7/4/13 (3.6/5)"
"D - NO. For something that has this aftertaste, I will never seek out a Baltic Porter again. Nothing will make me change my mind. Very high alcohol content for a beer that is subpar on taste and smell. However, very nice looking and mouthfeel. I do find these qualities very nice."
"Solid black color with a huge tan head that leaves behind sheets of lacing as it slowly recedes. Dense and rocky foam, cap sticks around throughout. Perfect appearance for a Baltic. Aroma is of roasted grains and booze, with a slight hop aroma in the background. Taste is roasty and toasty, plenty of dark malt bitterness, some coffee and chocolate and only slight undertones of dark fruits and raisins. Very nice mouthfeel, thick and chewy, silky and smooth. Perfect amount of carbonation for the style. Alcohol is high and it can be felt quite early. This is a one and done sipper, but gosh darn it was good!"
"Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with bittersweet cocoa flavors clinging to the palate."
"D: extremely impressive beer but also very filling and flavorful. Could not have many of these. My first Baltic porter and not a disappointment."
"Very silky smooth, awesome all around. Honestly this may be my new favorite beer for this price. Hopefully I can get a case price."
"M + D: A nice, soft creaminess to it which does it justice. Not as much of a 'thin' feeling. The alcohol is very well hidden, and it's hard to believe it could possible by 9.5%."
"Very appealing. One of the best I've had of this type. Affordability is also a huge plus, as this runs only about $2 a bottle. Score."
"Hot, dark banana bread. Dark fruit: overripe plum, fig, raisin. Anise and coriander on top of an herbal/pine hop character. Very nice. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel while still managing to tingle and finish spicy. Well done BP. Dangerously sessionable."
"Overall my impression is positive. I enjoy drinking this beer and the alcohol is generally hidden well. If you can't find Okocim porter, this is definitely an acceptable substitute."
"Another beer provided courtesy of my brother (pojo41). Poured almost completely black with small off-white head/tan that dissipated quickly. Aroma was of roasted malt and coffee. Flavor was also of roasted malt, coffee, and also chocolate. Nice mouthfeel. Coudnt believe this was 9.5% abv as it was hidden well. Dangerously drinkable."
"Now here we have a remarkable beer. Abundance of character. all of the clasic baltic porter hallmarks coupled with individualistics such as roastiness, darker grains and perhaps a special yeastoid. Poured with a tan head, lots of lace and pitch black color. Opaque. perfect balance between bitter and sweet, with enough body to compliment the works. Bravo. almost robust enough to be too much of a beer for the session lablel. tough it out bro."
"The back end is quite bitter - another personal taste Plus for me. The mouthfeel is just a little shy of perfect - call it medium for style. It's just one of those Lager v. Ale questions, and I tend to prefer the creaminess and depth of the ales, but hell yes to Zywiec Porter."
"I was about halfway through this Polish beer before I realized it had 9.5% ABV...I kept wondering why it was so robust! Overall it was a big, full flavored beer with little to knock."
"Nice dark ruby brown color with a creamy tan head. The nose is very roasty with soem chocolate and dried fruits. The taste also has roasted malts, chocolate and figs. Nice full body goes down well. A nice example of a Baltric Porter. Drinks well for a 9.5% beer."
"D- very drinkable for how potent it is. they did a great job of hiding it. also, very cheap. definitely something ill be picking up again, probably not untill it gets a little colder"
"This is definitely one of the better Baltic Porters I have tasted. Not quite as good as Okocim, but its up there."
"D= This is another great Polish baltic porter that I might consider the best if it were not for the Okocim Baltic Porter. Definitely worth your time!"
"Bottle courtesy of secret santa: Poured a deep red color ale with a light pink color head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of syrupy cherry with too much of sweet cloying notes. Taste is also dominated by the extremely sweet cherry syrup with some very light malt notes. Full cloying sweet body with some average carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Too sweet for my taste buds and too much of the fake cherry syrup comes out for me to enjoy this beer."
"Sends me back."
"The only contender to this one is Killer Kowalski from Flossmoor Station. Bottle from Sal's Elmhurst."
"I enjoyed the color of this porter. It had a heavy black with a light head after the pour that resembled a coffee with cream only. The high ABV overwhelms teh nose, bearing the scent of a pure porter overa light proter. The mouthfeel is a little tingly, but still heavy on the pallet and leaves very cleanly. Chocolate tones emaerge over the tounge. It's a heavier porter than normal. If tasting your porters, this is a nice beer to throw into the mix. For an all night affair, like most porters, this may not bee your choice. It's a great beer for a rookie taster's ""want"" list."
"I kind of liked the last few ounces better. Maybe this is a enjoyed a little more after greasing the wheels with a lager or two. If the problems I had with the boozy qualities went away, this would score better for sure. Still a beer worth trying, but not tops in this style in my book."
"Black with a tan head slow to dissapear. The roasted malts create a smell that is a balance between chocolate and coffee (with a little plum in the back). Tastes like roasted malts, and mysteriously some banana. Very good beer- my first baltic/ polish. I am glad I found this."
"Pours light brown from the bottle and appear very dark brown in the glass. Light aromatics. Brown malt, caramel, light chocolate and espresso, banana peel arrive on the front palate, with a lovely backround of ripe sugar glazed fruits. Flavor is truly astoudingly complex, clearly a great recipe, yet I can't say I'd want to drink it again. The beer tastes too dead."
"Drinkability: This is probably my new favorite Baltic porter. I don't think it's sweet enough to be a textbook example of the style though. It's far more quaffable than a 9.5% beer should be."
"For some reason we've had the Zywiec lager beer available around here for quite a while, but even after the ABV limit was lifter the Porter was nowhere to be found. But today I found it at Windward Beverage Mart of all places. When poured the body looked dark brown to black in color, and the carbonation did a nice cascading trick until settling into a head that was tw fingers thick. The smell was nice and mellow with mostly a dark fruit character showing up with very little chocolate. The taste followed the lead of the smell with berries, cherries, prunes, and a little hint of chocolate and coffee. Astringency and roast was notable in their absence. Very Baltic in overall presentation, which made it an easy drinking beer. The alcohol was completely hidden, and this drank more like a 5% beer than something nearly twice as strong. Perhaps a little thin in the mouth, but that is forgivable considering all its other virtues. Well done."
"D: A great example of the style. This is a great brew for slow drinking on a chilly night watching some hockey. I, being in Florida, will settle for a hot night watching hockey in an air conditioned house."
"Drinkability: Excellent, makes a great porter-lover's session beer."
"I'll be the odd man out on this one and admit I was pretty excited when I poured this into my pseudo stein and it resembled motor oil. Seriously - excited for thick, black, syrupy, viscous motor oil. Fortunately it smelled vaguely of roasted hops, and tasted like a strongly bitter chocolate with more of the alcohol flavor showing through in the end. The feel was thick but not too heavy, and light carbonation. Not sure how many of these I could put down in one sitting since they settle rather heavily, but they taste damn good regardless."
"This has great drinkability. I docked it only slight because the 9.5% would sneak up on you fast, but for $2.19 for 500 ml you cant go wrong with this one. I will have to get a few more of these, a hidden gem IMO"
"First sip reveals a fizzy tingly carbonation. Flavor starts with some sweet molasses but rolls to a harsh astringent flavor with some chemically flavors not overly pleasant. The finish is bitey and it could be from booze, this beer wasnt one of the better ones of the nite."
"Very decent all-together beer. Really surprised with this one."
"A friend of mine left me a bottle of the Zywiec Porter a few weeks back, and I'll have to remember to thank him once again. This is a truly enjoyable Baltic porter that is easy to get excited about. I've always been a fan of the darker brews, but this big dark lager seems to excel at everything I like about the Baltic porter style. It looks great, leaves a distinct lacing, has a top end abv, and a superior complex blending of smells and tastes. The aroma itself is sweetly intoxicating, while the flavor melds a rich caramel malt base with alcohol and aggressive bitterness that really leaves you wanting for more. Incredibly smooth, with low carbonation this dark amber ale will give you both a kick in the taste buds, as well as, a kick in the head. I'm going to have to find a case of this to use as the perfect, erase the rest of the day, elixer ."
"D: Hugely drinkable for a 9.5% beer. Being one of the only porters available locally I am thankful that it is also one of the best I've had. Definitely pick this up if you find it in the states!"
"Mostly black with lighter edges and a pancake batter tan head. Aromas of coffee, roasted malt, molasses and burnt sugar. Sweet and roasty dark malt flavor with a doppelbock-like caramel fruitiness. Full body with a deep malt finish - more caramel doppelbock notes with alcohol fairly well hidden. Baltic Porters are fun because the bottom fermentation totally throws you for a loop when you first taste the almost imperial stout-like character that suddenly swerves into doppelbock character. It's the beer that starts out as an ale but finishes like a lager."
"Overall, a good sample, sweet, rich, full-of-flavor, but with noticeable alcohol..."
"I wish I had more than one of these!! I could drink this all night long."
"Overall flavorful and enjoyable. I return to this one frequently because of the value."
"As it warms up, more complexity appears. I start to enjoy and appreciate this fine showing from Poland."
"This is a great Baltic porter with the odd aroma and uninspiring appearance the only downsides."
"Drinkability: This was less than $3 for the bottle, which really surprised me. I was pleasantly surprised by this. Sure, I've had better of the style, but this was fairly singular, and astoundingly easy to drink and seemingly light for the ABV and the style. I'll be buying this again, and it was a nice first beer from the brewery."
"This is an unusual Baltic Porter...it's missing something but I can't say what it really is. It's an enjoyable brew, but there are others in the same low price range that I enjoy more. Baltika for one."
"Overall, a damn fine beer that I'd happily buy again. I would like a bit thicker mouthfeel, especially considering the gravity and style. Other than that, its quite nice."
"D: Nice balanced brew that is smooth and zesty. Warm and clean finish."
"D- Not bad as far as drink ability goes, defiantly got better the longer it sat and it warmed up a little. The burnt taste was somewhat distracting in it and for me caused it to not be super high on the drink ability scale."
"Pours a basically opaque black with a tan head. Nose is distinct with chocolate. I like! Flavor is just as good. Mature and robust with a smooth and not too harsh profile. Chocolate and mature malt tomes. Feel is thick with carbonation and smooth with ingredients. Extremely drinkable. After sampling several porters from the region over the past few weeks, this is by far one of the top ones...if not THE top one. Very worth trying,"
"Drinkability: I found this to be an easy to quaff porter despite the higher alcohol levels. Nice beer for a cold evening."
"This is a surprisingly good porter...from an unlikely source."
"Pours an opaque black, some red around the edges, huge thick off white head, tons of lacing, great retention, forms a solid layer, looks pretty nice. Smell is a bit metallic, some iron, roast, chocolate milk, vanilla, caramel, lacto sourness. Taste is toffee and chocolate milk, light floral, roast, touch of coffee, well integrated flavours, lacto sour finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, super smooth and alcohol is well hidden. Nicely done beer, very enjoyable."
"D: A very tasty Baltic Porter, true to style, a steal at $1.99 a bottle, price/alcohol ratio is about the same as your average malt liquor but with a ton more flavour."
"The bottle alone merits mention, as it's shiny and a has a nice classy label. Poured a deep dark reddish-brown into my Guinness pint glass, and the tan head reached the top. Beautiful. Smell was nothing special, a typical dark malt aroma. Mouthfeel is good, thick and nice carbonated, with alcoholic kick apparent especially as the beer warms. Taste is mainly of caramel, molasses and some charry dark chocolate, but turns too far to the bitter roasty end for my taste. Alcohol becomes a bit overpowering after a while, and really detracts from this beer's drinkability. So far I've tried Southampton Imp Porter, which was too sweet, and this one, which is too bitter-dry. If I could find Okocim, that might be a happy medium. I still miss the Hammer."
" ~ This beer is one created in my mind for after dinner. I will certainly recommend it to my friends."
"drinkability is great. you hardly notice the 9.5% abv. well balanced and very enjoyable. thanks eric!"
"Drinkability: There are better porters out there w/ out the metallic taste. I enjoy the warmth of this drink but not the thickness nor copper taste"
"smooth and drinkable, a little light for a porter makign it a bit easier to drink than average."
":("
"into the world of Porters."
"Pours a deep black color, nice carbonation, there's a nice small creamy tannish one-finger head, some nice islands and sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, but slightly roasted, lots of toffee/caramel. The taste is malty, creamy, slightly roasted, with a nice touch of toffee/caramel. There's a slight chewyness to this brew. Also, no trace of the ABV, amazing. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an awesome Baltic Porter, would love to try again someday."
"D-The alcohol presence is very low here which makes this dangerous. This is a very good beer though that mineral quality might make more than a couple too much. Either way I am glad to have a few of these in the cupboard."
"No beer thermometors or ""Prawie jak"" campaigns for this one, this is the real deal. It's drinkable for a 9.5% beer with a great taste. Add in that it's only $1.99 for a half-liter bottle, and you have yourself a bargain. Now if the low metallic flavor could be fixed..."
"A big, slightly fruity porter. Sneaky alcohol - very smooth and drinkable. A bit disturbing for a 9.5% ABV beer to be highly drinkable. The Poles are onto something here."
"Highly recommended. One of the top beers of the year, I must say."
"It's very strange that the smell was underwhelming to me. Everything else about this beer is exactly what I would want. It's incredible. I'll be buying these as long as I can get them."
"Pours very dark brown to black with a healthy initial head that fades to a thin cap. Some spotty lacing. Smells of chocolate, prunes,brandy, and some bitter hops. Very dry and bitter taste,with noticeable alcohol. Much dryer than most in the style and delicious. The fruit and semisweet chocolate come through here as well. The mouthfee could be a little bigger, and the carbonation is a little high. Very nice Baltic porter."
"This beer was a pleasant surprise and most enjoyable."
"Black as the Baltic, but with a waaaayyy better head. The smell is of a rusty bumper, totally unbecoming of the fine taste of this beer. I was mystified by this at first, as the smell caused dread. The overwhelmingly metallic nose was not represented by the smooth, coffee/mocha flavor until the back end. Mouthfeel is smooth, not remarkable, but satisfying. The drinkability of an otherwise fine beer suffers considerably because of the fact that I breathe through my nose."
"Quite the beer, complex flavors, but not something you could drink in quantity (it's 9.5% ABV after all), but it's most definitely something you should try."
"Poured out a near black color with a luscious creamy tan head that slowly settled into a thin fiolm. The nose had soem light coffee and good malt character. The taste had some bitterness to it before giving way to bitter coffee, a tiny amount of dark chocolate, some tannin, and a bit o cherry. The mouthfeel is creamy, long finish settling into some coffee bitterness. Good and drinkable, but take it slow and enjoy."
"This is pretty drinkable but I have had better Baltic Porters though. This is OK don't get me wrong but I really have other beers in this style I like better and one of them is made by Baltika and is VERY affordable."
"D- couldnt have more than one or two of these, a good beer, i should take advantage of my stores large eastern european beer selection more often, good price too"
"Roasted malt flavors coupled with sweet caramel and molasses notes. Thick with a heavy body that sports a very smooth creaminess. Hop profile flexes its muscles with a pretty hefty bitterness that has legs into the finish. Molasses notes stick to the taste buds and can be picked up again in the aftertaste. Earthy with a nice full body. A very night porter from Poland. Spots a pretty high abv, which warms the body. It's cold in Poland..."
"Drinkability- Overall a really good top 10 baltic for me. Not quite up there with the big boys, but I can definitely see myself buying this again in the future."
"ABV flies under the radar. Very drinkable, great after dinner with a dark maduro cigar."
"Prior to cracking the crown, I doubted whether this beer could equal the brilliance of my favorite Baltic porters. Poland's own Okocim Porter and Finland's Sinebrychoff are some of the best beers of any style that I've ever had. I'm pleased to report that Zywiec is in their league and is an immensely enjoyable experience. Why can't all Polish beer be this good?"
"What more can I say? A great Baltic porter, and something all porter fans should try. It also tends be to very cheap, much more so than domestic offerings of similar quality."
"Zywiec's Porter pours a crystal-clear deep-mahogany (almost black) body with gleeming dark-chestnut and 'burning-ember' orange highlights. It's topped by a full head of creamy, dark tan froth. Unfortunately, the head retention doesn't quite hold up to the bar set by it's color and clarity. The lacing is, however oddly, a bit better, and it leaves wide rings of thin lace at the outset of the glass, and then some pretty nice runs of spots and splashes. The nose is moderately roasty and chocolatey with some yeasty, berry-like fruit, and an edge of alcohol... perhaps even a touch of minty hops. In the mouth it's medium bodied and creamy smooth. The flavor is surprisingly rich, and it hits you immediately with dark malt acidity, low-notes of roastiness, and alcohol. Chocolate appears next, alongside some yeasty fruitiness; but as you progress through the tasting the darker flavors build and the fruitiness gets covered over. Deep, scorched caramel sneaks in here and there! A bold bitterness backs it, and it finishes dry and brash due to the acidity and alcohol. Some cereal grain maltiness, a touch of cocoa, and a wash of alcohol linger. It makes a great companion on a chilly night in front of the fire, with a book, or just settling in watching TV. Worth trying."
"Pours thick and opaque black producing a dense, tight, long lasting tan head. Luscious aromas of dark chocolate, figs, raisins, molasses, roasted malts, along with some faint espresso coffee beans and smokiness. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and full yet shows a moderate level of crisp carbonation which allows the flavors to explode on the tongue. Initial flavor leans toward the sweet side showing off notes of dried dark fruits, licorice, molasses, dark rum and burnt caramel. Mid to late palate transcends into a moderate roasted malt/charcoal, dark chocolate, espresso bean bitterness with just the slightest hint of alcohol. Itll sneak up on you quick since it is well hidden. Probably the best Baltic Porter on the market here in the U.S."
"Brought some bottles back from Poland over the summer, just finished the last one. I was hoarding them because this is so good! Pours a nearly black body with a small attractive tan head with unbelievable retention. Strong nose of roasted barley and malt. Some light licorice and coffee scents too. Taste is simply divine. Its so rich and complex, there is a lot going on in this brew. Strong alcohol flavor as well. Creamy and very full mouthfeel, very stout-like. Because of its complexity and fullness, I didnt find its drinkabilty too high. But that certainly isnt a bad thing, some beers should be like that. If you can get your hands on this at your local distro, go for it."
"Pours syrupy black with ruby undertones. Head forms nicely and continues to grow for an unusually long time. Smells of alcohol, fig, toffee, coffee beans and chocolate. Smell is nicely complex. Taste is nice and warming. Moderately strong alcohol warm and nicely balanced. Taste is more reminiscent of an Imperial Stout but none the less a great beer."
"D: Tasty, easy-to-drink, not as filling as most beers in the style, I found this one to be more of a sipper, but on the right night, I could see myself knocking back a few of these pretty quickly."
"This is a damn good porter! My Polish friend introduced me to this marvelous beverage the other day. This stuff has a really creamy mouthfeel with low carbonation, nice malt flavor, and you can barely tell that its a 9.5% ABV. Awesome beer, picking some up real soon, you should too."
"Overall, I enjoyed this quite alot, but the lightness in flavours disappointed me a bit. This is still an amazing brew. Many, many thanks to Mark (TheManiacalOne) for sending me this on a trade."
"Deep, dark brown, topped with a thick mass of light taupe head. Great head retention, maintaining through the glass. It takes a while to get a beer like this to settle. Splotchy lacing. Impenetrable to light, even at the edges of the glass. A thin layer of sediment dropped out to the bottom of the bottle, despite this most likely being filtered. That's what happens with age. Rich aroma of licorice and roasty, lagery malt. The hops have completely dropped out of the picture. Smooth lagery aroma is intensified with the last year sitting in the back of the beer fridge. A study in aged lager roastiness. Excellent. Full lagery, roasty flavor. So amazingly smooth. Medium bodied, with soft, sparkly carbonation. Fig and raisin, moving into a clean, aged hop finish. Vestiges of noble hop flavor, mostly a floral tang with some soapy, eastern european spiciness. Finishes so clean, drying off the palate with negligible flavor. Incredible. How they make beer like this, i don't know."
"Very nice and well made."
"My wife and I recently enjoyed some of this brew. Were both fans of Polish Porters, and hoped that this would be as good as some of the others that weve sampled. It pours a deep, solid black color (maybe hints of crimson along the edge). The head is tan and small, but quite dense. It has a fair amount of lasting-power, and leaves a nice lace on the glass. The aroma is a sweet mix of chocolate, roasted malts, burnt grain, and a whole lot of fruit. There are so many fruity and estery smells that it sometimes distracts from the underlying grains. Almost no hop aroma. The taste is sweet and warming. You can certainly feel the alcohol in your mouth. Molasses, brown sugar, and raisins come out in the taste. Theyre a little jumbled, though, and I think that the beer could have had more malt flavor. This is a rich and tick beer, with a fleetingly chalky mouthfeel. All in all we thought it was very good, although nowhere near a best of class."
"Taste is sweet dark malt. Rich, far more rich that the nose suggested. Black fruit, tart currant and plum. Noticeable warming alcohol in this one, faint roastiness way back behind the fruit. This is a thick brew in the mouth. Doesn't look or smell like it should be but it is. A little hot but a nice drinker. I can't decide if this will excel or fall apart in the cellar. I'm gong to get a couple more and find out."
"A Port among Porters. Great beer!"
"I sampled this a couple times while in Poland and it simply didn't seem to me to have the great character of some other Baltics."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is full bodied. The beer is a good blending of taste and smells. The alcohol is well incorporated in taste and smell. This beer is a very dangerously drinkable beer. I will definately seek this one out."
"Rich mouthfeel, very full. Creamy at first, then a prickly carbonation. Very drinkable for its strength -- it made the voyage down my gullet well."
"Mouthfeel is good. Low carbonation suited to the style. Thick body, rich complex flavour. Drinkability is okay...I might have served this a bit too warm, but this is a stylen I generally enjoy and this particular beer is worth buying again."
"I found this a little musty at first but, man is this stuff good. Under $2 for a 500mL bottle seems like quite the bargain. It does seem dry and I wouldn't really call it ""rich"" but its damn satisfying. This beer is HUGE and its kicking my ass..."
"The high alcohol content is actually a mixed blessing - I could easily drink this stuff all night if I weren't plastered after two bottles. It's absolutely worth a try."
"I'll have to try more of this style, and I'll definitely be picking this up again."
"An excellent beer all around. Pours very dark brown with red tint when held to the light. Has a large fluffy tan head. This beer says ""drink me"" all over it. Smells of lots of roasted malts, coffee, some licorice, and alittle alcohol. Creamy goodness with lots of the roasted flavors comming through. Waming alcohol is noticable in feeling, but not so in flavor. Great representation of the style and a great beer, im happy i picked it up. Will be even better in the winter."
"Poured a deep deep dark brown with ruby hue thru out when held up to the sun with a big fluffy almond colored head that left copius amounts of lace behind as it settled slowly.Awesome aromas raisin,green apple which I found suprising but very appetizing with notes of star anice and wood as well,flavors start out sweet and rummy with raisin and prune notes a slight drying cedar,raw earthy profile shows thru keeping it in balance.Awesome beer a style I should seek out more often,I love to find some decent Polish offerings being of Polish stock myself."
"M&D: not the smoothest Baltic Porter I've tried, but it's really well-made, maintaining its soothing texture apart from the initial bite on the tongue. At 9.5%abv, this full-bodied beer tastes rather like 7%abv. as the alcohol hides all too well. Given the fact that it's past its expiry date by 1.5 years, I'd say I really feel lucky to find it at such great condition and it's perhaps more mellow than it should've tasted before the BB date. A delicious and satisfying Baltic Porter, with a reasonable balance."
"This beer pours pitch black with a brownish/off-white creamy head that lingers. It has a complex, rich smell of coffee with hints of chocolate. It has a great, complex taste that fills the mouth. The only down-side is that some of the alcohol taste does come through, but considering the high abv it is not predominate. This is an excellent example of a good porter. It would have a higher drinkability if not for its high abv. I highly recommend this beer for lovers of porter. There is not much to not like about it!"
"Mouth feel is full bodied and on the verge of syrupy."
"This beer pours a deep dark brown to black color with a thick tan head from a 500ml brown bottle. Malty smell, touch of wine like smell too. Taste is very interesting, at times metallic, malty, sweet, wine like flavors, even bloodlike at times. Alcohol is definitely present in taste and warming effect. Definitely a very interesting porter, probably not my all time favorite, but well worth trying. Complex flavors for sure."
"500 mL bottle. Translucent rubied dark brown with a humongous, thick, light beige froth. Nose is of noble hops (reminiscent of a Pilsner), but with roasty malts underneath. First sip is quite minerally, but with a smoky roasted chocolate finish. Subsequent tastes yield more noble hop flavor atop the persistent choco-caramel roast. Faint smokiness abides. No trace of 9.5% abv, save for the buzzing in my head. Body is lighter than expected, but still in the medium-range. Slick and smooth mouthfeel. This is my first Baltic Porter, and as of now, I think I prefer the more sessionable U.S. porters, but this is still a fine brew. Sneaky alcohol content and a bargain to boot -- around $2.50 for this half liter. I'm sure fans of this style would dig Zywiec, and probably have already tried it."
"Very aromatic. Lots of caramel and chocolate with fresh dark bread notes as well. Deep black color with a beautiful three finger thick mocha head. Very roasty...burnt pumpernickel and dark chocolate flavors pop out. Head never gives up it stays huge and fluffy...beautiful looking beer. Some herb and vegetal flavors come out in further sips."
"Taste is better with malt, smoke, peat, alcohol, dark chocolate and dark fruits all coming to the party. A full-bodied brew, rich, almost stout-like. A definte must-drink beer Wow!"
"Rich dark brown in color.Nice tan head that did not disappear. Smell is of roasted coffee, and rich mocha. Mouth feel is thick and rich. Taste has quite a bite,the high alcohol content is very evident. Finish was a bit bitter for my taste,but still a beer well worth trying."
"Shared a bottle at room temp 1.5 years later and it was good, but clearly not up to the top stouts around."
"Dark, nearly opaque cola brown with a small mocha head of foam that leaves petit lacing on my glass. Aromas of deeply roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and a bit of harsh, edgy booze. Taste is similar to the aroma. Damn tasty and fine, with coffee, and roast up front, some hoppy chocolate in the middle, and some bready booze in the dryer finish. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected, but still thick enough, and the drinkability is pretty nice as well.."
"Drinkability: A solid example of the Baltic Porter style, this brew is one to savor and drink slowly, being mindful of the high abv"
"Highly recommended...And I'll remember it's Zhe-viets."
"I drank this beer at the table of my corner deli, and I plan on doing so again."
"Wow...my tastebuds have grown. This offering was extremly dark with a pillowy head and great lacing. I wonder if my first review was an old bottle. The smell is burnt malt with a distinct hop uindertone...extremely inviting. Taste is malty on the front...smoothly moving to the back of the palate where the hop flavor dominates. Mouthfeel is smoooth and rich, the dry finsih keeps it from being oily. Extremely drinkable. This is 9.5 abv..but you don't know until the alcohol kicks in. The alcohol by the way is very understated...very nice."
"i prefer the ale baltic porters i've had; these lager versions are too smooth (thus the taste doesn't really linger). that being said, these things are truly a godsend in the land of pale lagers"
"Luscious pour: dark but clear burgundy under a two finger beige head that lingers forever and leaves very nice lacing. This is what a porter should look like. The nose is a bit faint, but the feature tone is sweet malt on top of an underlying floral hops aroma. The mouth is exquisite, well but not excessively carbonated, with enough body to coat the mouth without being sticky. The taste? There's lots of it. Sweet caramel, a touch of chocolate, significant espresso tones, a bit of plum. The alcohol is also noticeable, but in a smooth, pleasant way that warms the stomach and mellows the rest of the senses. The finish is significantly dry and bitter, leading into a good crisp aftertaste of coffee beans and fruit. Very, very nice experience."
"Nice light brown head thrones the deep brown hue. Very balanced aroma: delicate coffee and chocolate maltiness complemented by a profound and expressive roastiness. Hints at hay or straw which I love. Light alcohol presence. Very potent maltiness in mouth. Anise suggestions shine in the middle of that choco, coffee and vanilla desert. Slowly establishing roastiness provides a terrific flavor evolution. Very pleasant, very rich. Soft mouthfeel, medium body, medium carbonation. Yeah, this is a killer, baltic porter at its peak. Greatness, thanks a ton Per."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a medium head that falls quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma reminds me of soy sauce. Some coffee in there. The flavor is oily and has a coffee flavor with possibly some chocolate as well. This one doesn't drink as smoothly as I'd like and the mouthfeel is not desirable to me."
"500 ml bottle. Very dark ruby colour, large thick tan head. Malty aroma with smoked notes, elements of espresso coffee, tar and old woodwork. Flavour is initially a tad sweeter than I appreciate, roasted malts with tar, coffee and prunes. A distinct bitterness from the hops and roasted malts takes over, and lasts through the long aftertaste. The high ABV is well hidden. A solid Baltic porter, but not as good as Sinebrychoff."
"The head was fine and dense, I expected it to be a bit more prominent. The very dark body shows nice mahogany notes. The smell is an exuberant mix of wood, fresh and sweet red fruits, citrus and chocolate. The taste basically shows the same features, with a deep and chewy hoppiness that has a dark chocolate bitterness and a dry roasted coffee character. Notes of porto (or the idea I have of porto). A warming brew in which the alcohol gets clearly noticeable. Mouthfeel is good, not thick but not too thin either, maybe the alcohol is a bit too warming for my mouth though. Enjoyable, thus drinkable, but a few bottles of this would bring you to hell quickly..."
"Flavor is roasted coffee, chocolate with a sugary sweetness. hops kick in a little in the finish. .Very tasty!"
"I couldn't put down more than one at a time, but I'd definitely go back to this one. Much better as it warms up."
"Being half-Irish and half-Polish, I've had many different Irish beers, but this is my first Polish beer. And what a beer! Zywiec Porter pours a dark brown with a slight tan head that fades quickly. Nose is full of roasted malt. Taste is of dark roasted coffee and malt with a strong alcohol bite; a silky mouthfeel leaves a slightly bitter finish on the toungue. This beer does not even try to hide its alcohol, making it more of a sipping beer than a drinking beer, but a delicious one nevertheless."
" This is a benchmark Baltic Porter, and is exceptional in taste, aroma, and drinkability. Truly a classic."
"Drinks very easily for a beer of 9.5% abv. A real find with this beer's price and quality. Who cares if it's a Heineken-owned brewery? This is a very nice Baltic Porter from Poland."
"Incidently, the clerk at Jim's Homebrew said this was being discontinued. Sounds like more rumormongering along the lines of Okocim/Carnegie rumors I've heard earlier this fall. Zywiec IS owned by Heineken. Whenever a big conglomerate buys an old, established brewery, its possible they will do away with their range of beers if they feel they are competing with their products. I really hope this is still going to be around for a while."
"Pours a light leathery brown, settles deep dark brown, nearly black with deep ruby highlights, thin tan head fades quickly with drippy whispy lace. Aroma is all malt and all dark fruit, wafting plum, raisin, fig, dates, molasses, touches of dark cherry and dark toffee. Taste is more of the same, just a bit milder, but quite subtle and complex, starts thin of dark toffee and caramel, amounts of dark fruity sweetness builds nicely over the top, dragging raisins, plums, and dates through a stream of molasses ending with a light malty mouthfeel of sweetness and some light floral hop bitterness and light spice popping through in the finish. A nice mix of flowing subtle layers, a semi roasted quality and cocoa comes through underneath as it warms. Quite inticingly mild and mellow, smooth with a bit of a thin start but a good easy creamyness comes through throughout each sip. A pretty nice porter and worth a try."

"This was not the first beer of my evening, but it was the last! I shuffled off to Slumberland, and left some beer in the glass. Next morning, that aroma was still there, and I couldn't bear to pour the remnants out, even felt tempted to toss it in my coffee!"
"This overly potent Porter pours a tar pitch with a thin beige head and very thin wisps of lace. The aroma is basically scorched malt and fumes of alcohol. Smoky wood, sweet crème brulee, and dark roasted coffee make up the body. A light grapefruit bitterness and mild metallic tang wonder aimlessly about, while the wild and potent alcohol is the almighty king of this brew. Towards the end of the glass, the essence camphor peeks through and some balance begins to take form, but again the jealous alcohol takes over, sharing center stage only with burnt and sweet."
"A decent Baltic porter, but not the best example of the style. Aroma is very sweet and syrupy. Flavor has strong leanings toward lightly scorched maple syrup, with some almost-soy sauce notes at the end. An odd saltyness hovers on the edges. All of this sounds pretty bad, but actually the overall flavor is robust and drinkable. There are others I'd select first, however."
" Overall, a very good porter, with a real kick. I'm glad I found this, as it is quite good and reasonably priced in Beantown. Cheers to Poland!!"
"Rich roasted mouthfeel, with a long bittering finish, some caramel, chocolate and soy, warming finish, with some alcohol, but really well balanced, especially considering the high ABV. It's also intersting to note that the bottle i had was passed its use by date by about 3 months."
"Real good beer overall. More bite than I expected, and that takes away from smoothness that I'd like, still a beer with high character and good drinkability."
"This is my first porter reviewed on this site. It's a good one. Poured a dark black colour, with few scarlet streaks dancing with the light. Above average, long lasting head that left good lace on my glass. Big coffee smell. It's as if Nabob was a major part of the mash. Some plums, cherries, dark chocolate, vanilla and pine are detected with the coffee. Very strong, sweet, dessert smell. Tastes like a coffee and chocolate cake. More coffee flavour than any stout I've had, and subdued chocolate. The mouth picks up more vanilla than the nose. More fruits, some of which I'm unsure of. Definite plums and cherries, but more fruit is tasted. Raisins? Figs? I don't know. The chocolate is dark and unsweetened. It's actually a little harsh. Despite the bitter chocolate, this porter is smoooth. The liquid coats the back of your throat like some sort of heavenly syrup. For a 9.5% ABV, this is smooth and drinkable. Great to have during a cold winter's night. Too bad it's August and my A/C is producing more voltage than an AC/DC concert."
"Originally sampled on 7 April 2003. This pours black, w/ roasted, dry notes in the nose. this beer has slightly oily feel on the tongue. It's very lightly carbonated & doesn't have much head. It's an interesting brew. It's definitely different, not sure if I'd have it again"
"This baltic porter poured a medium tan head with small-medium bubbles. The lacing was sparse on the sides of my glass. The aroma was sweet, chocolate and licorice. The body was dark brown. I could taste the alcohol in this porter. The taste was smooth and it had a bit of a bitter taste to it."
"This brew poured a small head of fine to medium sized light brown bubbles that lasted a fairly long time and left a fair lacing. It has a slightly carbonated dark opaque brown body and a very nice strong chocolate malt aroma. With an initial bite that later settles down in the aftertatse, this brew has an interesting complex flavor of mild coffee, bitter hops, caramel malt and sweet. There was something in the aftertaste, I think it was the alcohol, that I didn't care for. It was not smooth enough for my liking as a great porter so my palate is a bit off. But still, an interesting brew to rate."
"The color as it sets in the glass a deep brown to black, the head is portly in size, creamy in consistency, and the color a winsome light chocolate. Nose is deep roasted grains, malt sweet, fresh and appealing to the olfactory senses as well as the eye. Start is thickly malt, sweet, the top full and rich, finish has a delicate acidity, the hops purposeful in their spiciness, dry as the desert aftertaste. A tad alcohol bitter and the 9.5 percent ABV makes itself known with a nice Belly Warming, Ah another Bad Ass beer to add to my master list."
"This is a surprisingly huge beer and quite drinkable. The flavor evokes hints of caramel, toffee, a hint of coffee, and a little smokiness. Finish is rather quick, without much in the way of hops, and I find myself drinking this too quickly. I think this is a great beer to break yourself into the world of dark, malty beers. Something about the quality of baltic porters makes them easy to drink and refine your palate for heavy beers. Great effort."
"Never knew a Polish beer would be so great!"
"Pours black with a touch of ruby red showing through if you hold it to the light. Tan head dissipates quickly and leaves just a little bit of lace. Aroma of raisins, roasted malt, and chocolate. Flavor begins fruity... like a chocolate covered raisin, then becomes somewhat bittersweet and finishes with an aftertase of espresso. Be careful with this one because the 9.3% alcohol is deceptively hidden. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, with low carbonation. A very nice beer for the winter months to sip by the fire."
"Profound nose of chocolate, ripe cherries, mild gingerbread and myriad other fruits and spices. Absolutely no hint of over 9% ABV other than a finish warming. Awesome! A draught is simultaneously subdued and complex, fruity, roasty, a crafted blend of flavors. Better than a Packzi on Fat Tuesday, this brew makes me want to learn the pronunciation of the brewery's name. Choice!"
"Hard pour releases a big brown creamy head with good retention. Almost black with ruby light transmission on the bottom. Nice aroma, a slight sense of berry, mostly sweetened blueberry. Excellent deep malt, stops short of java but with lots of unsweetened baking chocolate properties. Bitter quality on the roof of the mouth. As dense as a turkish coffee with considerable aftertaste. Powerful brew here, I'd love for more folks in the industry to do Baltic-style Porters...LOVE this stuff..."
"Excellent sipping porter (in contrast to those Porters you slam in beer bongs..lol...)...heavy mouthfeel...black with a little tan head...smell is of sweet dark fruits....the taste is loaded with burnt malts and sweet dark fruits...a nice little semi-bitter hop finish....a real dandy..alcohol emerges only slightly....on the sweeter side, but some real nice hopping nicely balances things out...My first true big porter and a great one to start with...also noted some true vanilla bean notes in this one."
"Many thanks to cokes for the fine brew."
"I would recommend this beer highly."
"Oh my. Um...OK, need to compose myself. Where to start...this is a beer that requires your full attention. Color is black as night. Remarkable dark tan head. Fabulous cascading effect after pouring from the 11.2oz. bottle. Big dark roasted malt, espresso aroma. Alcohol smell is pronounced. More big burnt, dark roasty complex flavors. Full body. Satisfying alcohol warming. Amazing brew. Looking forward to my next. This is one to savour for sure."
"I am very glad that I have been turned on to Baltic Porters.  They are quickly becoming a favorite of mine."
"Here's a beer that will warm your cockles.  Definitely a brew with beef.  Not a session beer but one to take your time with and enjoy."
"I have to agree with Venom on this one. Had one for the first time last night. Huge raosted flavor with tons of caramel malt. Although I did get the plummy nose I didn't get and vinious aroma off of mine. As of right now I am switching Zywiec to the number one slot for Baltic Porters (sorry Okocim). It's listed at 9.5% but it is damn smooth."
