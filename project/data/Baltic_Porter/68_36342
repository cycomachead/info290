4.3,3.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, 2012 vintage bottling. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, toast, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, dark bread, light smoke, and roast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, toast, molasses, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, dark bread, smoke, light char, and roast/oak earthiness. Fair amount of deep roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roast, coffee, toast, molasses, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, dark bread, smoke, light char, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of intense dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/barrel flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, slick, and lightly chalky/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged imperial porter! All around awesome complexity of intense dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 14, 2014"

Flavor is sweet dark fruits up front fading into a smooth bourbon taste. Ends with a blast of vanilla bourbon, very smooth, and definite heat lingers. It has enough viscosity for the aging--which I find rare for these BA porters--but doesn’t hold up quite like an impy stout does in the barrel. Dry oak hangs around a bit with the bourbon heat.

Poured very dark, but it had absolutely no carbonation and no head. Not a single bubble. I wonder if the bottle had maybe been previously opened and then resealed when the purchaser found out it was so expensive because the other reviewers claim there is normally carbonation. I invited 7 differen people to sample it, to make sure I wasn't crazy. NOBODY could drink this. it was like a ruined glass of port-type wine. DISGUSTING.","beersands","Sep 01, 2013"

Dark brown, nearly black pour with a one and a half finger caramel-colored head with nice lacing and decent retention. Sweet, earthy, whiskey-dominant nose with hints of oak, dark chocolate, licorice, and vanilla. The barrel-aging really comes out in the taste. Lots of oak and whiskey along with hints of vanilla, leather, cola, dark chocolate, and just a touch of black cherries. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly syrupy with medium carbonation and nice dry, bitter finish. Overall, this had decent body for a Porter and the barrel really came through nicely. Glad I picked up multiple bottles of this one.","beerdrifter","Apr 30, 2013"

More oak than bourbon which is light and not intrusive. The flavor is a bit light with less of the fruityness and more of the oak and coco. Vanilla is also present with a mild booziness which is welcome. Mouthfeel is a bit light and thin with a small pleasant amount of carbonation.

The smell of whiskey fills the air, the boozy aroma also form on the nose too and some chocolately malts as well. The taste of the beer is nice and smooth but has a really interesting whiskey taste to it, blended with some roasted malts and some wood flavors. The mouthfeel is a pretty thick which I like a lot.

The nose is bourbon infused with cherry, cocoa, charred oak and vanilla. There is an overlapping milk chocolate flavor lingering as well. The taste is offering much of the same bourbon flavors noticed in the nose but with intense chocolate and a bit of charred/smokey oak. Awesome taste with booze well hidden. Mouthfeel is sticky and pretty thick without compromising drinkability. Overall, this is damn tasty and pretty easily drinkable for such a brew of this magnitude.","ChugginOil","Aug 13, 2011"

3.58,-13.5,4.5,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"This beer pours an absolutely gorgeous blackness with a darker tan foam that hangs around quite well. The aroma has much the properties of whiskey. Added behind that are perhaps some dark fruits and dark chocolate with touches of vanilla and coffee. The taste is truly dominated by the whiskey with a touch of anise in the background. This puppy burns while going down. I feel that this beer is quite flammable and that scares me. This should have sat for so much longer to make this go away. I feel that there is a tasty beer down beneath this but I can't get over the hotness of this. It's way too fresh and I warn away from those looking to try it just for the hell of it. This needs to be cellared. After that I may revisit this, but until then it was hard to swallow.","Vdubb86","Aug 01, 2011"

4.27,3.1,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Tastes really good, lots going on here. Alcohol/booze flavors are more pronounced and the woodiness really compliments the chocolate well. Light fruitiness comes out that is not quite as prevalent in the regular gonzo. I find this to be just about as enjoyable as the non-BA version...but different - more complex. All the flavors do not integrate perfectly, but that is a minor complaint. Maybe it will come together with some age. Very good brew right now though, I bought 4 bottles at about 4 bucks apiece and am very happy with the purchase.","twiggamortis420","Jun 11, 2011"

3.87,-6.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"While the taste has some rough edges to it and that Imperial Porter body didn’t quite hold up to the barrel-aging here, this still had a delicious nose on it and handled it’s high ABV quite well for itself, helping to leave an overall favorable impression of this on me.

Taste is exactly like the nose but the coffee taste is subdued and there are some soy sauce flavors. Slight alcohol taste and burn in the back of the throat after each sip. Ok, this beer has ZERO carbonation. It is super flat, super thick, and a chore to even take a swallow. Horrible, horrible feel. Overall, this beer is obviously off in the carbonation department. I am not sure what happened here since the other reviews I am reading don't have this issue. I bet this would be pretty awesome if the carbonation and mouthfeel issues were normal.","UCLABrewN84","Jun 02, 2011"
3.84,-7.2,3.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. Despite the decline in taste from the nose, it's still pretty good, but not enough for being barrel-aged in my opinion. This ended up being a lot more oaky than I would've expected, which while not necessarily bad, is not desired when it's overshadowing the whiskey. Worth a try if it's available, but I'm not sure I'd seek it out again.","nhindian","May 26, 2011"

Similar taste, very roasty, malty, toasted wood, dark chocolate and vanilla bean, with a strong but bearable alcohol taste/bite. Very little--almost none--of the obvious hop profile noted in the regular (non-barrel-aged) Gonzo Porter. Thick and heavy mouthfeel, leaving some film behind. Very complex and flavorful...highly drinkable.","Rifugium","May 04, 2011"

Not very impressed. The mouthfeel is solid with almost no carbonation which is good. Overall I was disappointed in this effort as I love the original.

Initially I get some delicious vanilla and oak with a hint of cherry and some dark fruits. Then I get some chocolate and roasted malt. Tasty whiskey flavors thrive throughout each sip. Delicious! Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety...with good carbonation, but not too much. Drinkability is high, as this beer is highly mouth-watering and not TOO high in ABV for a barrel aged imperial brew.

4.23,2.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Y'know, sometimes things line up when reviews are being written past the midnight hour (Wilson Pickett waited quite a while for this time o' night). In this case, nothing says "gonzo" like the strange short on my TV, called "Circus on Ice". Thank God Joel and the 'Bots are here to mock it along with me. Now, this beer is gonzo, but not in the same way: it's more of a positive, "The only word to describe my species is 'weirdo'" brand. The pour results in an opaque black-brown capped by a half-fingerof bubbly foam; the color is too dark to be called tan and too light to be called brown. Dammit, I can't remember my crayon box well enough to come up with the proper term. ["Women are torn apart like french bread." Classic.] My 'strils are smacked around by a well-exercised fist of oak. This is followed 1-2 style by some spruce, dark malts, caramel, and sweet, sweet vanilla. I want to drink this. Yes, I do. [Ah, at last, "Monster A-Go-Go" is starting! I can't wait to wretch! ... "It's Billy Pilgrim." Wow, Vonnegut and Thompson references simultaneously? Pinch me! (And there's some BNL!)] The aforementioned oak fist reballs itself for another pummeling, this time aimed at my 'buds. It's got a new posse, though: bitter chocolate powder, red apples, whiskey, maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, and, still hangin' with his boy, good ol' spruce. I guess if the fist analogy were extended to these guys, whoever's swingin' the oak has about seven fingers or so. ...That's if I extended properly... The liquid sits heavily, but in a lighter-than-usual sort of heavy way. The moderate carbonation and only semi-syrupy coating assures me that, given the chance, this brew and I would be spending lots o' time together. Hunter would be proud to sip on this Wild Dog.","TMoney2591","Jun 05, 2010"

Sure, there was a bit of an addition to the nose, OK, but it wasn't any better than it was before, just different. And the woodiness kind of softened it. Although, in retrospect, I do think that was a good thing. Smoothness is (almost) always good. On the other hand, it lost a lot of its hoppiness. Hmmmm... ? I kind of wish I'd had a bottle all to myself at home one night with a good book rather than just a glass of it on tap at the bar - I'm not sure that does it justice, and I'll have to see if I can find one somewhere. There must still be bottles around, right? But back to what I was saying, it's an alteration of the beer, and it's a good one, but it doesn't improve the initial beer in a significant way. It's still an A, just a different A.","NeroFiddled","Feb 16, 2009"

Poured into a St Bernardus chalice, a dark brown quite close to black color with a two finger brown head that left some average lacing on the glass. Aroma is full of chocolate, spicy alcohol, dark fruits and some buttery oakiness. Flavor follows suit. Chocolate is the main star, brownie batter goodness, hints of coffee, dark fruits, light whiskey flavor, some buttery oak, and alcohol. Thick and creamy, average carbonation. Alcohol is more present in the nose than it is on the tongue. Well hidden in the mouth but could be felt in the head after finishing one glass.

Flavors on the palate generally replicate the nose, though I get a hint of licorise and some noticeable hoppy bitterness. Once again, however, the sweet chocolate and vanilla dominate the flavor profile. The beer has a medium bodied mouthfeel and the beer is pretty soft and smooth.

The aroma is somewhat light for the style, especially with the barrel aging, but there are nice notes of Bourbon, rounded graininess, prunes, cream, and oak. The taste is amazing- big bourbon flavors and huge flavors off sweet, charred oak with vanilla, caramel, and spice. Slightly sweet and raisiny, with more prune and some nice sweet, dark malt that is dried by the oak. Very creamy and smooth mouthfeel, doesn't feel heavy at all. Just an awesome drinker. As long as they had this on tap, I ordered one every time I went in. I'll bet this is much better on tap than in the bottle, where more creaminess can come out and things mellow a bit more.

I think this is a little better than the regular Gonzo Imperial Porter, hopefully Flying Dog will decide to make more of this in the future.","bluejacket74","Aug 25, 2007"

4.85,17.1,5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability - this is excellent ale. It is more of a sipper than a session beer, and it is too high in alcohol to be sessionable in any case.","ultralarry2006","Aug 12, 2007"
4.13,-0.2,5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"It's hard to imagine that Flying Dog could take a beer as fantastic as Gonzo, and make it better. They did. In general, I've been getting a little tired of the oaking craze of late, but this one just works. At $16 a bottle, this isn't cheap, or something that I'll be drinking regularly, but I'll definitely be buying another bottle or two for the cellar. Recommended and worth seeking out.","phisig137","Aug 07, 2007"

3.73,-9.9,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a very dark color with a thick and tall head that has great retention and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma has quite a bit of alcohol to go along with the oak and chocolate notes. Alcohol is at the forefront of the flavor. Lots of chocolate and citrus/pine hops come through. The body on this one is very thick and the drinkability is so so because of the alcohol.","clvand0","Jul 17, 2007"
4.03,-2.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a beautiful thick tan head that resists fading. The aroma is great. It melds together the whiskey scent with the thick chocolate and black malt aroma of the porter. The taste is great. It has a smooth black malt and whiskey flavor that goes down easy and warms on the finish. The barrel aging really lends the whiskey character well. The mouthfeel is excellent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great imperal porter. I loved the original Gonzo, but the aging brings it to a whole other level.","WesWes","Jul 08, 2007"
4.38,5.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer poured looking like black tar with a huge brown rocky head  pretty lacing. The aroma is malty and alcoholic. The taste is sweet and malty. There are caramel and slight coffee flavor. The woody notes are noticeable. The mouthfeel is full and chewy. This is a bold beer that comes together excellently. Awesome! Great tribute to Gonzo  Im sure hed be proud!","barefootbrewer","Jul 04, 2007"
2.93,-29.2,4,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"The beer looks great, but it seems as if it could do so much more. Porters aren't my top style, but this disappoints, escpecially at such a high price. I've never had the regular Gonzo, but this might put me off of it. I expected better.","Jmamay22","Jul 01, 2007"
4.15,0.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D- This is a big beer with a nice blend of flavors. The malt flavors increase when warm while the bourbon gets softer. This is a big porter with accents of barrel aging not the other way around which is common for many Barrel Aged Porters.","rhoadsrage","Jun 21, 2007"

3.87,-6.5,3.5,4,4,3,4,"After drinking the bottle I think the secret is to let it warm a bit pour harder (get less in glass but gets rid of carbonation) and it tastes a whole hell of a lot better! I think about 60 degrees is good.","BlindPig","May 29, 2007"

3.71,-10.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,3,"A slow-sipper to be sure. The whiskey and wood dominated just a bit too much to be too drinkable for me. Actually, it is interesting, but personally I prefer the regular Gonzo Imp. Porter. (Surprised that this is categorized as an "American Porter" here - would have thought it would be "Baltic Porter", but that's okay - it works).","jwc215","May 16, 2007"
4.33,4.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a deep dark black with a head that builds rapidly, way more than the normal Gonzo porter, and it stays till it is gone. There's heavy alcohol aroma on the beer along with semi-bitter dark chocolate and some caramel mixed in. Definitely a different taste than the original Gonzo, the barrel aging really comes through with a smoky aftertaste in this beer to go along with the dominating chocolate and coffee taste. While the alcohol stuck out a little bit in the smell, this is a very drinkable beer at 9.5 percent. Good stuff.","saintwarrick","May 15, 2007"

3.85,-7,4.5,4.5,3.5,3,4,"Apparently they can age this beer in any container and for any amount of time and it is still a quick, swift kick in the pants. Although the barrels sanded off the most aggressive burrs, the beer continues it's harshness and roughness. Still, very rich, thick, and boldly flavored of espresso, cocoa powder, and booze. Aromas pick up on very raw and earthy / pungent citrus hops, which flow right into the flavors and bittering. Feels every bit as thick as discribed, along with a charred coal, ashey flavor and feel that I could live without. The barrels seem to give a marshmellow texture and a bit of mellowing. The beer will certainly improve with time, but until it matures, I'll not be the biggest of fan.","BEERchitect","May 13, 2007"
4.28,3.4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured a deep dark, opaque brown with a huge, overflowing brown head. Absolutly no fade on this one, fantastic retention with significant lace throughtout the glass. Smell was very rich, full of chocolate and sugar, with hints of caramle and a slight hoppiness. The taste was great, full, creamy, and exceptionally smooth. Lots of roasted malts, chocoalte and caramel hints throughtout. A slight warming from the alcohol, but hardly noticeable and very tolerable. Nice hints of oak as it warmed, nothing overpowering like some other beers i have had that have been oak aged. Overall this was remarkably good, and dare I say an improvement over the regular Gonzo which in and of itself is a great brew. Very nice and definatly a winner.","mikesgroove","May 11, 2007"

2.95,-28.7,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Pours a very dark brown with a respectable frothy head. Smell is of a roasty bourbon. The taste is huge. A very good underlying porter with a large amount of bourbon flavoring. The mouthfeel is big and creamy. However, there was way too much carbonation for my liking. The same comment was made by all, and that was, this is good, but doesnt compare to Founders KBS. Still a very good beer, but not as complex or as good as several others.","FtownThrowDown","May 04, 2007"
3.58,-13.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Yep, this is definitely way over carbonated, it foams up quite a bit as it first hits my tongue. Even after 5 minutes the head has not subsided in the least; a quick swirl to shake loose some carbonation lets the foam climb an additional three fingers above the rim of my glass and still not overflow down the out sides. Without the excessive carbonation, the beer begins to take on a creamy mouth feel. Even in the flavor the barrel still plays the dominant role; notes of vanillin, oak-butter, whiskey soaked oak, and a touch of spicy woodiness are all easily noticeable. The Gonzo underneath the wood is not all that noticeable. Somehow though the underlying Gonzo plays an interesting supporting role. By that I mean that the oak here is not too overwhelming, despite being the most noticeable flavor, the Imperial Porter flavors, while not particularly stand out, hold the oak in check enough to make this reasonable drinkable. Still I think I would enjoy this a lot more if a quarter of this was mixed with three quarters of the regular Gonzo.","Gueuzedude","May 02, 2007"

It would get an easy 4.5 overall after a few months but for now its a bit raw even with the aging. This could be a brew that achieves a wide range of scores. The best offering I've had from this brewery....although the double pale ale has been calling me from my makeshift cellar for a couple days now.","DogFood11","Apr 13, 2007"
