"Pours an almost pitch black with little head. The smell is mild but has some caramel and nutty aromas but is overtaken by alcohol. The taste was rather pleasant with a decent balance but the mouthfeel was very thin for a porter. Known as a great cheap/strong beer and I think it lives up to that reputation."
""

"Not bad for the price."
"I actually couldn't finish this one...."
"Lets not get complicated.  This is a very delicious porter. One of the best i have ever had. It tastes great....period."
""
""
"Overall: Decent. It's good for the price, as many users have noted, but it's a far cry from being a great brew. It almost feels like coffee liqueur has been added to a watery porter. The sweetness detracts, and I am not enough of a coffee drinker to appreciate the only other apparent flavor. I wouldn't mind drinking it again some time if I wasn't so close to Deschutes, who produce one of the best porters there is."

"Well rounded full bodied. Impressive porter from poland"
"A little light bodied (in my opinion) for a Porter, but tasty.. well balanced and easy to drink.  I normally like them a bit more on the malty side, but the high alcohol content gave it a nice punch"

"At 1.99 per... this just became my winter session beer. It sounds like a 70's blacksploitation film, goes down just as hard and satisfies the same way too."

"Very smooth drinking Baltic porter from Poland. This beer drinks very smooth and not heavy at all. Has a bit of very light sweetness to it but not over powering so it stays pleasant. I had this in the smaller 11.2 ounce bottle and I didn't see an alcohol content shown, if this beer is 9.4% ABV its masked very well. The last time I drank this beer I picked up four of them, I like this beer and will drink it again."

"Reminds me of Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout, only not as refined. A bit on the sweet side. Warning: Don't keep it super cold: Otherwise it comes out almost flat with no head. Nose is that of a mocha spirit: Like a Godiva liqueur fused with whiskey or  bourbon, even dark rum. Solid mocha start-to-finish. Because not as rich as a stout, very drinkable. A bargain for $2.50 -$3. Good Stuff."
""
"I spent summers on my grandmother's dairy, coffee, and sugarcane farm.  This porter reminds me of what the giant pots we made ""melcocha"" in smelled like after boiling down the cane juice.  I understand this smell now whereas I used to confuse it with soy sauce.  This is by far my favorite porter."

"9.4% need I say more. Excellent strong beer and smooth!"

"Has the Baltic Porter become an overlooked style? Don't say that to the Black Boss, which is a more than fair representation of the style."
""
""
"One of my favorite beers of all time. These are usually relatively cheap in bottles ($2 for a pint), and are a fantastic value. Most 'craft' pint bottles are far more expensive. The alcohol content of this beer is very high (almost 10%), yet the beer retains a very smooth, dark taste. This is definitely a fuller and richer porter. Many porters I've tried recently have a sort of watery chocolate taste, but Black Boss has a wonderfully deep coffee flavor."
""
"Overall: I’m now a fan of Baltic Porters. This one, at least, is a porter for those who enjoy sweet stouts."
"My first beer from Poland, and a solid one at that. A tiny bit too sweet- I wish there was a bit more hop or roasted malt bitterness to balance the sweet dark fruit and cherry flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent brew. Not a fan of porters so much, but I do enjoy Russian imperial stouts on occasion. This is closer to that style than a porter in my opinion, and I will continue to try others in this style in the future when I can find them."

"I followed a Brooklyn Winter Ale with this. The striking thing was that they were nearly identical in appearance, but this is, by far, a better beer. The style may be unfamiliar to US drinkers who have a very different notion of Baltic Porter (and there is at least one Polish representative of the latter style), but this is precisely what an actual porter tastes like on the shores of the Baltic Sea, from the Oder to the Finnish border. Latvia and Estonia have similar heavy sweet porters that are, shockingly, their common summer brew. As I said, you have to recognize it for what it is--in context. If you are expecting a standard Baltic Porter style, you'll be disappointed. But, judging on its own merits, it's not bad. Worth another shot or two (which is more than I said about Brooklyn Winter Ale)."
"Nice beer, available at Bierkraft in Brooklyn for less than $3. Very dark brown, decent balance and well masked kick make for a nice quaff. Looks like this will be regularly on the shelf; bought mine in W-B. Although big in malty flavor, sweetness is very light."
""
""
""
"Overall I like this beer. It works. Definitely a beer I could get drunk on since it has a high alcohol content yet is not very filling. I would not be inclined to pair this with very many food options."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice decent porter if you like them sweet, if not it may gross you out, especially as it warms."
"Sadly, in the mouth it's immediately too sweet. Dark fruits, simple syrup, toffee, and wood barrel. I could really use some roasted grain or hop bitterness to balance all the dried fruits. How about some unsweetened cocoa or burnt coffee? No. It's all sweetness (I'm getting vanilla, now, too), plus an unwelcome leather. Wait, there's the roasted malt and coffee, faintly. It helps put the sweetness into perspective and raises the score a bit."

"O - 4 - This is a great beer for the price. Almost taste like cinnamon toast crunch but with more dark malty, roasted notes. The cool thing is it doesn't really compare to any other porter or stout that I've had."

"This is a tasty beer, but completely not what I want in a porter. Even if you're in the mood for something sweet, this is likely a bit much."
""
"O: $2.73 for a pint. This is one of the cheapest pints/single servings available at my local craft beer store, but it definitely is in the top half in terms of taste. I readily admit that I'm a sucker for beers that successfully pull off having a high abv. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys porters and happens to see this in a local store."
""
""
"Picked up this 9.4 ABV 500ml bottle on a recommendation from a friend who happens to work at my local imported beer store. Rarely am I disappointed with his recommendations and this beer fits the bill. Previous reviews accentuate the estery l / fruit like finish, which is no doubt present in this porter. But don't allow those descriptions to scare you away from the roasty, chocolate backbone of this outstanding beer. Perhaps a different type of yeast and this would be a top notch imperial stout. At $2.39 a pint everyone should take a shot at this fantastic Polish Porter"
""
""
""
"O - Black Boss' dark fruit esters add wonderful layers of complexity to this chocolaty beer as suggestions of licorice and molasses come in to seal the deal. Surprisingly drinkable, smooth, and deceptive, this Porter makes for a great cold weather treat!"
"taste is roasty, but thin, with lots of alcohol and a metallic twang. kind of nutty but with a twangy bitterness. one of the better Polish brews I've tasted.... not much else to say, however,,,,"
"Pours like Coke or Pepsi, but without the carbonation.  Smells of slightly burnt caramel.  Taste is a tad sweet on the front end, but overall very good and a satisfying drink.  Not a lot of burn considering the 9.4% ABV.  This Polish Baltic Porter is a very good beer for the cost (16 oz for $2.99)."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and sugary chocolate syrup aromas. Taste is much the same with extremely sweet cocoa powder, char, and vegetal grain flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is fairly tasty when cold but as it warms up, there is an acrid burnt vegetal and grain flavor that is pretty off-putting."

"a dark brown almost black pour with 2 fingers of creme colored head, slow dissipation and nice lacing left behind. there is a heavy booze aroma at first, which leads to sweet raisin, brown sugar, and chocolate. a very easy drinking porter, sweet up front, with raisin and chocolate notes, then a nice charred roasted bitterness hits you and leads way to a fig flavor that leads to a sweet finish. for the amount of malt needed to make such a high percentage beer, i'm surprised at how thin of a pour this is. medium in body with enough carbonation to make this beer go down nice and easy. this bottle is a few years old and has developed VERY nicely over time, so i suggest picking up a few since they're cheap-ish."
"A very deep brown practically just a shade or two lighter than black in the glass with a huge frothy khaki colored head that sticks around a while and laces nicely. There isnt too much in the smell. I do get just a touch of the chocolate and caramel that you'd expect in a porter but more yeast character and alcohol than is normal. The taste is pretty sweet with some of the alcohol flavors carried over. In the end some of the more typical porter flavors of roast malt and coffee come through. Overall the bitterness is quite low or perhaps that is just my perception which could be skewed by the near cloying sweetness. The body and carbonation level are both in the middle of the range, as mentioned previously the finish is a touch sweet but that gives way to a drying roasty character after a minute or two. Overall I can't get by the sweetness of this, it will appeal to some but I've just never been a big fan of big dark beers that dont bring the malt flavors that their color suggests."
"I'd compare this to Spaten Optimizer, an imperial stout. It's also sweeter and more palatable to me, than Obsidian Stout, and packs a little more punch than Black Butte Porter, and it's sweetness was more to my liking. I found it at a great price in a grocery store, and will definitely try it again!"

"Poured from a 500 mL bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a red black with an off white head. Smells of raisins and chocolate and coffee. Tastes of raisins and coffee, very nice, balanced and full. Beer is full bodied and goes down smooth. Overall a very good beer."
""
"Very nice Baltic Porter."
""
"overall - pretty good, no hint of the the higher abv."
""
""
""
""

"Pour a mild cola color, hardly black enough to be called a porter. Paper head is gone quickly and barely a hint is left to show it was there. Burnt malt dominates the nose, there's not alot of depth. It's smooth and easy drinking, cola, burnt toast, chocolate roast. The alcohol is present but concealed. It's awright and at 9.4 if your looking for someting to get your block rocked you could do alot worse."
""
"A bit too alcohol forward which surprises me as this is less strong than Zywiec (my standard go-to Polish Baltic Porter), though not nearly as drinkable. Still a bready meal in a glass, well suited to a night cap or a small meal of sausage, cabbage, etc."

"Very tasty.. light feeling but that is what makes it refreshing. Very drinkable all year around. And wow, with the beer prices today, this is the best value for a high octane beverage! I pay $ 2.09 for 500ml. This is not a Bells Porter but it's not $ 5 a bottle eather. Enjoy! Oh, the compaion food with this beverage is more Black Boss Porter!"

"Quite a solid effort here. Black cherry in color maybe a little darker and very clear with a little carbonation evident. Decent lacing and a light covering that remains. Aroma has the requisite roasted and chocolate malt. A touch of coffee. An English style fruitiness with raisins and mild figs. A touch of alcohol and mild toffee/caramel sweetness. Taste is a recapitulation of the nose. Chocolate and coffee, molasses and toffee. SMOOTH. Roasted malt and lots of it. Earthy and dry hop bitterness that finishes clean with just a touch of lingering grapefruit. Some light graham. Feel is surprisingly light for a beer with this kind of og. Velvety carbonation, silky swallow. A great example and a wonderful bargain at less than $1.30 for a 500ml bottle."
"Overall this was interesting enough to try but I probably wouldn't seek it out a second time."
""
""
""
"Overall I could see why I picked this up its a nice change from a chocolate/chalky taste in your imperial porter. I love the fruity, chocolate/roast, sweet finish aspect this beer gets. Worth picking up just to try Poland's best porter."
""
""
""
""

"O: The mouthfeel is the weak point of this beer, and carbonation is the main issue. It's rather flat. This may be a product of poor bottling/rough shipping, among other things. Still, it doesn't detract enough from the drinking experience to make it totally unenjoyable. In fact, this is a pretty decent Baltic Porter, and more traditional than some examples of the style we see over here. Many American versions (including some of my favorites, admittedly) are affected by that overzealous, bigger-is-better American mentality. They come off tasting more like an Imperial Stout than a true Baltic Porter. It's refreshing to drink something a little more authentic and straight from the source. This is a real brain cell assassin at 9.4% abv too. It almost feels sessionable, and if it wasn't labeled you'd never know it possessed that strength until you were swinging from the chandeliers."
"Overall - Odd beer. Has a bit of funky wine character amidst the porter flavor. Drinkable, and somewhat enjoyable. Something I might consider buying again, though it's not necessarily representative of the baltic style."
""
"Poured a pitched black (had this in a dimly lighted bar, mind you) with good one-finger tan head that died quick but left some lace on top of a dry, roasted aroma with a mix of some sweet malt smells like caramel, possibly chocolate. Mouthfeel is a little thick and sticky, good balance between sweetness and roasted malts and finishes nice with a crisp finish (ABV leads to heated finish but doesn't nuke the tastebuds or anything). Good, not great, porter, as the tastes themselves are basic but pleasing. Some sweet caramel and chocolate and maybe a touch of candy fruit or something. Good beer, worth trying, not the greatest, but that's more of a critique than an indictment."
"Pours the color of molasses with a healthy amount of mocha foam that settles to an appreciable veil that remains indefinitely. The aroma is very mild, a faint combination of molasses and cocoa. The flavor is much bolder than aroma, with a roasted malt character headlined by dark fruit, molasses, and alcohol. The alcohol flavor is not extreme considering the ABV, but it's certainly hard to miss. Some vanilla also manifests itself as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is slick and oily, typical of the baltic porters I've tried. A lush, roasty fog lingers in the back of the mouth after all else has subsided, lending a really nice finish. On the down side, the flavor profile lacks some cohesion, with heavy handed flavors smacking the palate variably in succession. I'm not a huge fan of Baltic porters, so perhaps I'm being a bit harsh here. With that said, this is better than other Baltic porters I've tried, so it appears to be a very solid offering for the style."
"O - Great beer for the value, otherwise above average by other means. It is worth the $2/bottle price and would certainly consider purchasing again. I've had better porters, but this beer is better than many others I've tried before. Would recommend, but I wouldn't go out of my way to push it on someone to drink. The alcohol is a touch strong, but masked rather well."
""

"Pours darker than a stout or your typical porter. About 3"" of thick cream topper....Very smooth, robust taste and not to bitter after bite. I sincerely enjoyed this, probably would have tasted even better with a fat filet mignon or t-bone. Overall it was a perfect end to a halloween evening and one that I would definitely recommend/drink again."
""
""
"This is by far the strongest porter I've had the pleasure of tasting, and it certainly didn't disappoint. This beer had a very strong malt taste to it, with a very sweet mouthfeel. I will have to do a more thorough tasting, but at $2 a bottle I will certainly be purchasing it again."
""
"Overall always willing to pick up something knew when I see it in this case not enjoying it much. Maybe close to old world porter but nothing like the new Baltic Porters."
"O: Interesting Polish beer! I might not seek it out, but it's certainly recommendable. Hefty and drinkable."
""
"O/D-My first judgment came in the liquor store. There I found 500 ml of 9.4% ABV Baltic Porter for $1.60. That deserves an A for value. ANd the beer itself is unique and frankly quite tasty. I could get a nice groove going with about 3 of these (for under 6 bucks to boot). An enjoyable, high-gravity, cheap beer? One of the few of its kind."

"All in all, a very drinkable Baltic Porter and a good substitute since the king & queen of Baltic porters, Okocim and Zywiek are so difficult to find. I'd love to try this on tap."
""
""
""
"Smoothe and easy drinking. If I didn't already know, I would be astonished that it is 9.4 abv. Masked very well. Would be good around christmas with gingerbread houses perhaps? I would also be curious to see how it ages, might have to pick up a couple when I am home again."
""
"Overall - Awesome porter. Wonderfully balanced and complex."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I didn't care for this one...many of the chocolate/espresso flavors were OK, but the over the top alcohol (yes, 9%) is too much and kills this one. Chasin' Cheers :~)"
"A sweet, heavy, high alcohol content porter. Pretty tasty if the sweetness doesn't bother you."
"Also, can't beat the price of this porter"
""
""
"A an amazing addition to a large hearty meal, pairs great with stews (bigos in particular) and one pot meat dishes. The sweetness may turn off some people, I find it quite enjoyable. Be careful of the high alcohol content, if you drink it from a mug you may wake up in a revolutionary war graveyard down the street from your house. (yes i did) The price is one of the many selling points besides its ability to go with food like a fine wine. I am able to get this beer in the 11.2oz bottles for $35 a case, an amazing feat for a porter that is 9.4% If you can find the 16oz bottles even better price/volume. Dangerous them big bottles, because you can slam them like its milk."
""
""
"This poured out into a tall pilsner glass, it had a dark brown color that faded into black as the head settled. The smell of the beer gives of some lager aromas, some roasted malts and a little bit of earthiness too. The taste of the beer has a slight chocolate note in the beginning that fades into an earthy roasted grain flavor with the lager yeast bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth, it's not even that heavy for a porter. Overall it's a good brew, I found it to be pretty good on most levels. Glad I tried it."
""
""
""
"O- This is a well balanced porter slightly on the sweeter side with a high abv that is not very detectible. Pretty good and definitely worth trying for the low price."

"O – A porter lovers porter. Everything presented here is dark, roasted, or burnt. I love this beer. (This now wins my “most dangerous beer” award as I’m wondering how many of these 500 ml bad boys I could put away in an evening. Something tells me I better not try to find out.)"
"O: Good Porter, definitely worth the price of $2.something for 500mL, almost always have one of these on hand"
"Overall, this is an amazing porter. I am partial to porters, but also quite critical. Not too sweet, not too smokey, just the right balance. My only complaint...it's TOO good! It is so easy going down that you forget how heavy the alcohol is. Drink this one slowly."
""
""
"O: one of my favorite beers -- not available in most places"
"Bought this as a cheap filler for a beer tasting (under $2 for 16 oz), but this was one of the hits of the party. Decent head, on a black coffee colored beer. Bursting of chocolate and some coffee undertones. Alcohol is well hidden. My first beer from Poland, and I was very impressed."
""
"Price Point - $2.09/16.9oz bottle"
""
""
"O- Weird beer. Not your usual porter. Not sure if I enjoy it or not."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a stemmed porter glass. Small head, which dissipated quickly with some lacing. Poured a deep, dark ruby red. Strong smell of caramel. Taste, a sweet coffee/caramel flavor with hints of sorghum. One of the sweetest porters I've had. Definitely a breakfast or dessert beer. Overall, very nice. Would buy more."
""
"Porters are my favorite beer style. I prefer them over stouts, because they're generally sweeter. This particular porter is sweeter than most. It's also thinner than most, but that just makes it all the more drinkable."
""
""
"O- Good. Very average yet the high alcohol content and low price definitely make this Porter worth the try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall it is good but not amazing. I would try it again but not go crazy to get my hands on it."
""
""
""
"True to the style of sour, tangy, and smokey. It's a little rough around the edges but aren't all Baltic Porter's? Lighter body than I expected."
""
"Black Boss Porter is one of the most notable ""surprise beers"" I have come across in a long while. Furthermore, it paired perfectly with my kielbasa and pierogi dinner. Do yourself a favor by going to your local Polish market and buying a six-pack of this stuff. You will thank me later."
"Breakfast beer! Lots of residual sugars, but still light. Not nearly as big or dark as other Baltics. Very drinkable."
""
""
"Usually baltic porters are just too sweet, or bitter without hops, or just not right for me. This one was decent, at a decent price, so I'd check it out again, anytime there is a strong drink, that doesn't suck, at a cheap price, it has a place in the world (deservedly)."
"O- rather big fan of this beer, I feel it is well brewed for a porter and plan on continuing to buy."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I really like this beer and would love to have more."
""
"The mouthfeel is almost as weak as the nose...thin and watery with a small amount of carbonation."
"On advice from my brother, I gave one of these a try over the holidays. Very dark, with some hint of ruby. Almost no aroma apart from maybe some hints of coffee, maybe should have served it warmer. Malty, sweet, chocolatey with hints of spice and a burnt edge to it. Really no hop flavor or detectable alcohol which was unexpected. I'm not a huge porter fan, but this is probably the best I've had. Very good."
"D- Had a hard time finishing this one, bit boozy as it warmed."
""
"taste - fairly sweet with lots of dark malts, and the molasses again is the dominant feature. fairly drinkable although the body is lacking, especially for a porter."
"Overall: pretty good, if you see it grab it and give it a go. Very easy to drink considering the high ABV level. Cheers to all and hope you enjoy."
"O: This is just a poorly made, hard to drink beer. Not a good effort."
"One of the best of the Baltics! Poured this one at a good temperature and with a nice sized, thick, foamy, tan head that settled down after a bit and some lace. Color is a very dark, but clear brown red. Aroma is roast, malt, cocoa, hints of licorice and molasses. Flavor's very similar to nose, with slight sweetness up front, a little tang from carbonics and bitterness from malts, yeast. Excellent full mouth and perfect carbonation. Finsih is like flavor, no off notes, and fairly long and slight alcohol warming. Great Porter Beer!"
"Overall, it's a nice beer. It cost less than $2, which is a crazy bargain considering how good it is. I wouldn't have more than one in a night, but I'd enjoy that one."
""
""
"Sampled on November 19, 2011. From the 500 ml. bottle it pours dark brown with better clarity than the average Porter. Some head. The aroma is an odd cross between dark malts and Toffee. Kind of cardboard like too. The body is medium to bold. The taste is not smoky or chocolate-like but it most definitely has a weird kind of astringency which leads to a slight hop bite.But that is more like the traditional Baltic style. It is not my kind of Porter because I like the smoke but since they began brewing it in 1848, maybe this is the way it is supposed to be."
""
"This would be decent if the body was bigger and the nose wasn't so off-putting. For the price and ABV, not a bad offering."
"O=Very well rounded and complex, one of the best porters I've ever had"
"O -- I was happy to drink this, but I wish it had just a bit more body. Otherwise, its pretty good."
"O- Not a bad a beer. Easy to drink, maybe too easy. Would drink again."
"Perhaps a bit of aging, but right now, ridiculously hot."
"Overall this is a very nice enjoyable porter, my first Polish beer and hopefully not my last."
"O=May buy this one again...I have another bottle that I am aging for a year to compare this one against."
"I've yet to taste a Polish Baltic Porter that I didn't like. The same is true with Black Boss. Exact same color as Coca Cola. Light beige creamy head that clung somewhat. Smells toasty and caramel sweet. Taste is very sweet caramel and roasty chocolate. A bit more sweet than I prefer. The roastiness balances the sweetness somewhat and takes the edge off of the 9.4% alcohol. Alcohol is a little deceptive with only the lightest throat warmth. Surprised by the thinness of the mouth feel which also adds to the deceptive drinkability. I have had better Polish Baltic porters but this one is not bad at all."
"O: Another great baltic porter, but not my favorite. Much prefer the viscosity of Olfrabrikken or Baltika #6. This one also really pushes the molasses flavor, a bit too much. 3.5"
"Slightly metallic, but very roasty with creamy carob and chocolate flavors. As it warms, the chocolate flavors become more front and center. Ashy roast blends with mellow sweetness of dark chocolate. Definitely a lager with roasted malt, but still pretty enjoyable somehow. Nice char and chocolate aftertaste."
"MF- Nice full creamy and silky body on this one. Good amount of carbonation, and flavors that do stick around for a while."
"O- I could drink this porter morning and night. Great breakfast beer. Creamy smooth mouthfeel. Everything a porter should be. And at 9.4%, you'd never know. No hit of strong alcohol at all. Cheers!"
"The cpj"
"Tastes are store-bought chunky chocolates, churned butter, soy sauce, maltose, some hops, allspice, windowpane, and tangerine peels. Smells strongly of dark malts, milk sugar, really artificial sweetener, coffee beans dipped in hot tea water and almonds."
"PP (Price Point) - $3.50 for a 500ml, sign me up, I want More, More, More!!"
"Overall - A definite must have again, though, I will choose a more time appropriate season. As the sweltering heat descends upon this North Carolina summer a porter with this much flavor is not what I have in mind. Come September this one will be back in my fridge."
"O/D - For the ABV it does well. No alcohol in the taste. It's a little high for another and the sweetness might get to you but otherwise tasty."
"I intend on buying this again"
"O- I am very pleased with this one. Drinkability is great for the ABV and it keeps me interested the whole way through. Will definitely pick this one up again."
"I first had this beer with a specialty mushroom and cumin flavored pizza. And now I am convinced that any low ratings are the result of trying to drink this without the proper food. For me, this beer has a slightly sweet note and operates like comfort food. In the best way, it's like licking the inside of a fireplace after a holiday season. And it compliments the natural smoke of cumin like a strong but smooth cigar after a char-grilled sirloin. After having two or three of these growlers (on different occasions, of course-- this is a high alcohol beer), I noticed that it's better in the first ten minutes after opening; after that, it loses its already low carbonation and goes a bit flat. That flat watery mouthfeel deadens an otherwise fantastic beer that should be reserved for comfort during a night alone or thinking about your next big move in life."
"Overall a very nice porter and very drinkable and smooth. You won't be dissapointed. As they say in Poland, bardzo ładne piwa! Cieszyć się!!!"
"All in all, at $2.50 a bottle, Black Boss represents excellent value for an imported dark ale. Call it Porter...call it a Stout. Whatever. But if you spot it somewhere, grab it. You won't be sorry."
"Overall, if you like stouts/porters that are not too sweet (almost dry) and not too heavy - like, it doesn't have to feel like a meal - and you see one of these on a shelf - grab it."
"Overall this is an excellent beer and possibly my new favorite porter. It has a wonderful taste is easy to drink and at around $5.00 a bottle a great value for such an amazing beer."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a pint glass. Black. Only when held up to a light do I see a tiny bit of brown at the base of the glass. This is motor oil here folks. Very little head or lacing. Aroma is of chocolate, coffee beans, walnuts, cherries, and booze. Mouthfeel is actually light. Taste is of chocolate, coffee beans, walnuts, cherries, and booze. This is a super cheap beer well worth the quality and amount you get. Great deal, great find."
"Drank one of these with my good BA Buddy, y2korey, as we tossed backed some tater tots. Good light bodied Baltic Porter with a deep brownish, amber hue. Beautiful brown sugar and caramel nose. This beer tastes like a brew version of a Port wine. (I love some good Ports too!) Nice mouthfeel and lingering finish. Black Boss Porter drinks easy for having an ABV of 9.40%."
"This is really not my kind of porter. The ABV is hidden very, very well, but it lacks the characteristics I like in a porter."
"Definitely on the sweet side, but pretty tasty. I'd buy it again."
"Honestly Surprised by this beer. My mom's boyfriend brought this over when he was visiting. And I have to say I wasn't expecting much from it, I see it all over the place and expected it to be kind of disappointing like sheaf stout. However, it is quite good, and worth a try. Reminds me of Sam Smith's oatmeal in a way."
"The ABV will surprise you on this one, definitely feels like 7%, not 9%. A lovely Baltic porter, nothing world changing, but a benchmark."
"Overall I really liked this beer you can't tell its 9.4% its very smooth, black color with tan head that retains pretty well, chocolate-coffee bitterness. Good full body and mouthfeel I would recommend this to someone who like dark beers or porters not surper hoppy more malt flovors"
"D: The beer is very drinkable for the style because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"Drinkability - Very decent-tasting brew and at 9.4% abv in one pint, not a bad kick for the price."
"D: decent drinkability"
"Overall, I felt this was a nice porter, but was not a 'big' beer even for the high alcohol content."
"drinkability: nice beer. not blow your mind but great beer. up their with all the others I have in style"
"Drinkability was very good, especially for such a strong beer. Not too heavy or filling, this beer can potentially become dangerous. Good flavors and reasonably priced, would definitely buy this one again"
"Conclusion: This is my second Polish Baltic Porter, and it is different from the other I have tried. Both were very good, the other (Zywiec) was better overall, but this is still a well crafted porter and I wouldn't hesitate to buy or drink it again. The flavor is more singular in this offering, and in a way the simplicity is very enjoyable. Well done."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a smooth, black and chocolate malt scent. It's bitter and roasted with a good deal of chocolate malt sweetness. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. The taste is good. It has an incredibly smooth malt flavor that's quite sweet with some roasted notes. The mouthfeel is great. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer. It may be too sweet for some, but it seems to hide the alcohol well."
"Overall this is a pretty decent beer - definitely a good value at just over $2.00. The flavor is smooth and somewhat rich without being overdone."
"16.9oz bottle. Pours a thin, black color. No head to speak of. The smell is boozey. Aromas of honey, molasses, and malts. The flavor is a dark, sweetness. Molasses and honey. Not as boozey as the smell would indicate but you can taste some of the alcohol. This is one hell of a deal. I picked up this brew for about $2. It's 9.4% ABV and has a solid taste. Surprising amount of drinkability for such a high alcohol content. Perfect beer to have a few of in the fridge at all times."
"Very strange one. First thing I noticed as I poured this beer was a black opaqueness that looked very inviting. Very little head, and it dissipated immediately. I had a hard time distinguishing anything other scent than merlot. Yep this beer smelled exactly like merlot to me. I barely pick up a little raisin it it. Taste was were I lost some enthusiasm. I found this beer to really have no body to it. Low carbonation and not much taste at all. Pretty disappointing. I dont understand how a so called ""Baltic Porter"" could have no backbone to it. Drinkability I found to be quite high the 9.4abv was hidden quite well."
"This is a big beer...pours out pitch black with a faint red hue when held up to the light. huge fluffy, tan head that simmers down fairly quick, then patiently sits around for a while. Reeks of alcohol, has a fermented brown sugar aroma and a strong scent of bakers chocolate and overripe plums. The alcohol is up front in the taste and dominates the beer, while the sweetness of this one is almost too much to handle. It leaves a sweet aftertaste on the tip of the tongue after each sip, not too pleasant though. Slight bitterness going on as well Not much else really happening in this one, the sugars and alcohol cover up the malts, leaving a fairly light feeling beer, and the carbonation in this bottle is raging, not what I expected for this baltic porter and I likely won't be seeking this one again."
"D-This is very drinkable at 9.4% ABV. The alcohol is not noticeable in the taste."
"This is a great beer for the price and would satisfy all kinds of dark beers lovers. One bottle is plenty because of its over the top molasses character and ABV. I think it is quite yummy."
"Actually, I have to say I was surprised by this beer. It drank very well for 9.4%abv, had some nice roasty malts and other dark malts, slight syrupy flavors with caramel and some roasty and spicy hop bitterness. Tasty, just a slight extract syrup flavor."
"D - Easy drinking and not what I expected at all. Not picking up the 9.4% at all either. If I had to guess I'd put this at around 4.5%. Interesting brew and worth trying but I don't know if I would seek this out again. If you want to tick Poland however I don't think you could go wrong with this brew.."
"D - You really can't go wrong with this beer considering the price, style, ABV, and even the label design (which I love)"
"One finger light tan head, medium dissipation with some lacing. Dark brown clear body, no visible carbonation. Pretty non-descript nose, I had a hard time picking up my aroma other than a bit of floral hop presence. Taste is pretty sweet for the style, caramel malts, minor floral hop presence. Medium mouthfeel, a bit sticky. Drinkability isn't real high, quite boozy, but given the ABV pretty good. Not the best Baltic Porter I've had, but certainly one of the most authentic."
"A strong addition to the somewhat surprisingly powerful lineup of Polish Baltics. A little more raw and unrefined than Okocim but creamier than Zywiec."
"Pours an extremely dark brown, almost black color, with very minimal hues of deep red. The head is foamy tan, with fair retention. The aroma is of roasted malts and dark fruit, with a slight boozy and astringent backing. A mix of sweet molasses and roasted malts, with very astringent bitterness and hint of sourness, with some licorice notes. It is all a bit over whelming though, as it is quite the mix of very strong flavors. The mouthfeel is a nice medium to full body with pleasant, yet subtle carbonation. As it warms it does mellow out a bit and become more drinkable."
"I didn't expect too much from this and almost spit it out after the initial molasses kick but I'm glad I didn't. Still a little thin and sticky for my taste but an excellent end to the night. It's been a great stomach settler for sipping on and entering the days' reviews!"
"Lightly carbonated, good smooth porter. I like, and could drink more."
"Drinkability: Really enjoyable. One of my new favorites in the style. The taste is sweet without being cloying. I will search for this again."
"d: definitely worth a try; i found it enjoyable"
"D-At the price point this beer is very drinkable. I notice that it's similar to Helivus Kaper."
" ~ I'm going to go with, no thank you. A good friend recommended this brew but I have to say this is not one to offer to a pal."
"D: An incredible beer that has one of the smoothest feels in recent memory. Great sweet and roasty porter flavor with that signature European yeast strain taste to pull it all together. A solid beer all around and one that's well worth seeking out."
"A nice beer, I might have been a victim of the over-hype. But wasn't necessarily let down either. I would go back for another but not go out of my way to search it out."
"I had high hopes for this but I am left wanting something more from it."
"Everyone kept tellng me to try this porter and when I finally did I was just a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong it was good it just wasn't as great as people led me to believe, plus it takes a lot to get me jazzed up on a porter. One thing I did really enjoy about this porter was that for being 9.4% ABV you are not left tasting the alcohol like some high alcohol brews."
"Pours a dark brown color body, somewhat see thru held up to the light. Some small dark tan colored head. Dark almost dirt smell, heavy roasted flavors. Strong grape aroma too, purple grape juice. Some alcohol. Not too heavy, somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Odd flavor. A little better as it warms."
"D - I wasn't expecting a lot from A Polish beer, but this one was pleasantly surprising. A big beer with good flavor and well masked alcohol presence. I now know better than to judge a book by it's cover."
"Pours a deep clear ruby brown with a finger of ecru head that leaves a decent amount of lacing behind. The smell is heavy on the wheat, oats, and dark malts, with cameo appearances from cocoa and coffee. The taste starts off with a host of roast, followed by a darkly wheaty flavor, and finished by a powdery cocoa flavor. The body is surprisingly light, considering the wheaty and oaty characteristics, which, despite the relatively high alcohol, helps keep the drinkability fairly high."
"Skål!"
"I have reviewed this beer before, when I had it out of a 500ml bomber, but I tried Black Boss Porter out of two different types of growlers. One was a a short fat bottle, and had no handles. The other was elongated, and had a stem handle at the top. The second one was referred to as a Pyramid Growler. This beer is PHENOMENAL."
"500ml brown bottle, no freshness indication to be found. Pours a dark brown color with more than a finger of tanned head. Pretty good retension and a nice amount of lace hanging to the glass. Nose is roasty; including aromas of smoke, burnt grain and hops. It has some characteristics in the nose reminding me of a rauchbier with a zip of citrus thrown into the tail end of the smell blended with a bit of yeast. Taste follows suit with the roasted character and a bit of residual smokiness left in the mouth. 9.4 ABV? Honestly you could not tell it has this much alcohol, it is well hidden except for in the finish. Flavor also includes some hints of bitter chocolate and it is quite ""woodsy."" Fairly light feel with this beer and mild carbination. Rather enjoyable overall if you are into woodsy flavored dark beers."
" Appearance has a dark rich color with a nice fluffy head that slowly dissipates with fair head. Smell has a big hit of sweet molasses and brown sugar standing out above all. Taste again has molasses, brown sugar, light roasted malt thats rich with light hop and low alchohol taste, considering. Mouthfeel is full with low carbonation making it go down smooth. Makes me want to try more of these Baltic porters."
"Overall, I really enjoyed Black Boss and will drink it again. I don't have much experience with this style of beer and hope to try others of the style."
"This beer hides it's alcohol well, which is no simple feat, considering that it's 9.4%. As such, it goes down surprisingly easily. However, given that this beer has only one real flavor, and it's incredibly sweet, I'd be fine with only drinking one."
"Drinkability: Will have again but this is a one-night stand for sure. The 9.4 ABV just lurks around and knocks you around a little bit at the end. Solid porter, but be careful."
"D- Enjoyable overall. The dark fruits and sweetness was unique and more of a mix between a barleywine and a stout as opposed to a porter."
"Drinkability: For 9.4% ABV, this is a deceptively easy drinker. Overall, this is definitely a beer I would have again, and this is something I could easily do given its low price tag (always a plus)."
"Overall an impressive beer and one that seems like a steal in today's beer marketplace. Less than $3 for a big beer from Poland? You've got to be kidding!"
"D: As my second porter from Poland, I have to say this one is better than the Grand Cru. This seemed to be less sweet with the alc hidden better. Definitely a good value and a steal at the price point -"
"Drinkability is pretty good. It goes down easy and has a nice rounded flavor. Not so much of a session beer, but I could have maybe a couple a night. But overall a nice brew."
"500 ml. A black pour, though somewhat transluscent with brown throughout. Some off white head, minimal lacing. Some roast malt, more caramel/chocolate malt and some peat with molasses. Taste follows suit, more sweetness than some baltics, chocolate, caramel, some vanilla and molasses. not a ton of roast in this, but a little. Chocolate caramel finishing. Solid medium body and almost creamy mouthfeel, especially as it warmed. Borders on too sweet for the style, but still quite drinkable, went down easy. Wouldn't turn this down if offered again. Another, or at least the 2nd good Polish Baltic I've had."
"Cheers!!!"
"Black Boss is a dark, baltic porter with heavy notes of chocolate, coffee, and even molasses. it pours easy with its little carbonation, a packs a aroma that the misses would love to have a candle of! the smell for me is the most powerful aspect. the feel is light but creamy, and really doesn't finish as bitter as you would expect with its high alcohol content. its real sweet, at is a great dessert beer, pairing well with chocolate of course. a also find this to pair well with a good tobacco, as i smoke a briar pipe. the taste it leaves you with makes you beg for that next drink!"
"Baltic Porter is probably my favorite dark variety and when I can find a good one I grab it,I was thinking this would fit the bill but honestly it wasnt.Poured a deep cola color with a nice creamy lighter mocha colore head,the aromas were very light for the style,mainly I picked up hints of molasses and sweet alcohol.Body seemed really thin to me almost watery,flavors were mild with some mollases and brown sugar standing out most,a mild alcohol infused dark fruit element comes through as it warms as well.I had higher expectations for this beer but it kinda fell flat."
"We originally bought this because it is from Poland and my wife is Polish. It surprized us by being a very good beer. It is very dark with a light, creamy mouthfeel. But the flavors are so strong and well balanced that the beer is quite good. It has almost no hop flavor or aroma, just coffee, lots of chocolate, and dark malt. Very drinkable"
"D= This was a solid Baltic porter but there are so many that are better its hard not to beat this thing up. In fairness, it tasted good and was not hard to drink, so I guess that equated to good drinkability. I just wish the brewers would clean up the finish a bit and tone down the fusel alcohols."
"Drinkability- Lots of flavor and alcohol detract from this being more than a one in a session brew,"
"This beer isn't perfect, especially in the nose, but its flavor and sheer drinkability have made this one of my favorite dark beers."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth. Good drinkability. Alcohol is hidden quite well in this porter. At this price and quality, it might be one of my go-to sweet baltic porters. Tasty."
"Overall, well worth the price, great baltic porter. Would definately drink again."
"Honestly I am suprised so many people like it, but to each his own."
"Dark black which should be no surprise. The first smell is liek Count Chocula cereal, I love it! Robust, chocoalte aroma. The flavor is sweet porter and so easy to drink. This beer was only $2.69 for a 500ml bottle and I feel like it was a complete steal. Fantastic porter from Poland."
"D - The high ABV in this makes it a one bottle thing for me. I'm a very skinny person and I felt a decent buzz off of it. So more than one may get me pretty tipsy. But still an amazing beer. Get one!!!"
"This the best Porter that I've had to date, and currently my favorite beer. I picked it up at the package store for $1.84 for the pint, and was completely blown away. I was really sad that I only got one. Can't wait to get another."
"This beer pours a nearly opaque black color. The head is a mere quarter inch in height, and recedes within seconds into sparse lacing. The aroma is very fragrant. Graham crackers, milk chocolate, roasted and burnt malt. It is a very pleasant aroma. The taste is just as big as the aroma. There is just as much chocolate and graham cracker, and more roasted malt. There is a nice moderate bitterness which I suspect is coming from the roasted malt. The aftertaste is of nice lingering milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is nearly full bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this beer is a nice surprise. It might not be the best Baltic Porter I've tasted, but it is good and easily enjoyable. I wouldn't hesitate to drink this again."
"Pours a dense black that has some slight deep copper edging with a light cocoa colored head that quickly dissolves into a nice layer atop the glass. The aroma has mostly sweet chocolate and is accompanied by some roasted malts. The flavor has more roasted malts, a lot of milk chocolate and a very light bitterness. Its a very light bodied porter with the right amount of carbonation. This is a pretty watery porter that leaves you needing much more flavor and the aroma is a dominated by too much chocolate."
"It's probably not the best Baltic Porter in the world, but it's damn good, and a steal of a deal at the price I paid. Nasdrovia!"
"Pours a pitch black color with a thick tan head. Scent is interesting; malty, maybe some licorice. Taste is quite complex; a lot of smoky flavor, but elements of raisin-like sweetness. The alcohol is hidden remarkably well. Goes down very easily. Maybe a little smoky for my taste, but a nice offering overall."
"Drinkability very good, a really nice Baltic Porter, perhaps a bit heavy handed now, I'll bet this ages wonderfully. For the value price, there's no reason not to stock up on a few and find out!"
"This is one incredible beer. For $1.99, you get 0.5 L of heaven that's 9.4% ABV. The wonderful thing is that you can't really taste the alcohol. I really can't say enough about the flavor; the smokey sweetness is quite unique. The closest thing I can compare it to is some sort of wonderful root beer. If you haven't tried this beer, you must do so as soon as possible. At this price, you would be hard pressed to find a better value."
"M/D: Thick, rich, a meal in a bottle. The high abv isn't readily perceived, but the rest of it is amazingly heavy. These are not to be drunk quickly, but they're well worth it. And being readily available in most bodegas by me at $1.50-$2 per half-liter, a great value."
"I'm gonna look for more baltic porters."
"mid sized bottle, w/o freshness/brewing date info. Pours very dark amber, w/ a dark tan silky head, leaving respectable lace. Some smoke and cocoa in the nose, then ripe fruit notes, more smoke and roasty malts. Smooth and complex in its soft flavors and smoky hues. Alcohol (advertised @ 9.4%) is no where in sight. This stuff tastes like its aged. Flavor intermingle, edges are smoothed out and that all adds up to an intriguing and interesting offering. Go find some of this one and enjoy its intricacies."
"Would love to try this on nitro and cask...or just tap would be fine."
"Lastly, the ABV is 7% according to the label. I would really have liked to try it at 9,4%, since I think higher ABV would have served it well."
"Heavy, creamy body slides down the throat and smothers the palate. Balanced carbonation. The flavors and mouthfeel of this beer make it incredibly drinkable. It took me a moment to accept the heavy teriyaki aromas, but once I realized how balanced and strong this Porter was...I fell in love. Definitely a beer I will be talking about for a while."
"Quite bubbly for looking like it had no effervescence in there, and at 9% it hides it's alcohol well"
"D - Really good. Great example of a Baltic Porter."
"A great brew at a great price. Really glad I can find this locally."
"Notes from 04/07/06."
"This is one big outstanding, robust Porter! Black Boss is a great porter for all us die-hard Porter fans worldwide. VERY highly recommended by Perfesser Homer!"
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is black, but when held to the light shows a deep reddish color. The head is a wonderful cream, mocha color that last quite well. The aroma is full of a fantastic mouth watering espresso and chocolate tone. The taste does not disappoint. The chocolate and coffee taste is strong, but a slight nuttiness balances the brew and there is even a mild bitter finish. The beer is a little thin for my liking, but that is certainly tolerable and the taste makes up for it. This is a great brew. I have to thank my wife for picking it up while we were out of town at a wedding. Great choice!"
"D: it is very drinkable, smooth and not to heavy. Higher alcohol content can be felt half way through. I have not had too many brews like this. However, I would never drink more than one...but worth the try."
"If I didn't look it up here, I wouldn't have known that the abv was clocking in at 9.4%. This is scary drinkable, mainly due to the thin body. Careful, this guy could hurt you in later rounds."
"This porter is an amazing quality bang for the buck, this is a great tasting porter with an alcohol content of a stout. This is a super rich, saturated porter with hella flavor of coffee, chocolate and well... hops & barley!!! This porter is a bit chewy as far as porters go but its still a good bet if you can only grab one bottle."
"Overall, this is a very tasty Baltic Porter, but I just wish the finish was a little longer lasting. Other than that, I truly enjoyed this offering and will seek it out again."
"Zum wohl."
"D: Yeah, the best Baltic Porter I have ever had."
"This brew is just dangerously drinkable for a 9.4% ABV porter. It's been sitting in my beerpantry for about a year and it has improved quite a bit. It feels alot smoother now. I could easily have a few of these in one evening. Recommended!"
"This porter pours near black and has a silky tan head. The nose has a mixture of chocolate, dark fruits and some dry malt. A big malty flavor profile as well. Great balance between a variety of rich and sweet flavors. Creamy body flows over palate. Could drink this 9.4% beer all night."
"500 ml bottle purchased at Jim's Homebrew in Spokane, WA. Pours a very dark brown, some vaguely red highlights. Very little hear, very little lacing. Smell is dominated by roasted malts, coffee, caramel, maybe some distant earthy hops. Taste follows suit, very sweet roasted malts, coffee, caramel, with a slight bitterness at the end. Mouthfeel is very smooth, moderate to minimal carbonation. I didn't expect much when I picked this beer up, sort of expected it to be very similar to the Baltika porter--but this is actually a really nice, very drinkable beer. ABV is very well hidden. I'd pick this up again, especially at this price."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with reddish hues and a one finger brown creamy head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. This smells like a port wine: raisins, oak, sweet cherry. Big flavors of raisins and caramel up front with a bitter chocolate & hoppy finish. Light carbonation, heavy body this beer has a smooth creamy mouthfeel with a dry finish. Surprisingly easy drinking for 9.4% ABV, you taste the alcohol but it doesn't dominate and for $1.49 price tag, a bargain worth enjoying."
"Taste is very strong on the chocolate, the dark heavy baking chocolate type. Together with the cinnamon notes and roasted malt a great combination. Bitterness is medium. Mouthfeel is rather sweet and goes with the style. Aftertaste is a long, dry and sticky one."
"As the name indicates, this beer poured a nice thick black with a thin tan head. There was chocolate, alcohol, and maybe some sour cherries in the aroma, as well as some breadiness as is breathed a bit. The flavor had lots of chocolate and coffee with a slight creaminess. The malt body balanced the alcohol. It finished smooth. This was a great beer for the price ($2.80 for 500ml bottle) and a good beer regardless of price."
"As with most thick beers, 1 is more than enough."
"Deep black in color w/ crimson highlights when held to the light. Slight head. Smell is different. Slightly smoky with touch of leather is about all I can muster. Flavor has a mild chocolate tinge coupled with smoke and toasted grain. Overall not too bad. Slightly slick, watery mouthfeel. Medium body with a modest carbonation. Drinkability is quite good considering abv."
"Drinkability: a Baltic Porter the way it should be; dark, heavy and rough hence Black Boss is -- probably not suited for comsumtpion in any larger amount of quantities at once -- however still, highly recommended."
"This is a great porter for malt fans everywhere."
"Overall not bad at all. I was not really sure how this was going to be but I was really quite pleasantly suprised, this was definitly a solid offering and cheep, like 2.99. If you see it, make a nice night cap, and a good call."
"D: Overall a decent example of a high-alchohol porter."
"Pours an black color with a tall thick tan colored head that laces the glass all the way down. It smells of deep roasted malts and some hints of sweet flavors. The taste is good for a porter. It has a nice very deep roasted malt backbone that has some hints of chocolate and some coffee in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a very smooth and a little crisp at the end which is nice because that the amount of alcohol in this beer is hardly detected. The drinkability is good, but due to the high amount of alcohol it is not as drinkable as some others. Well worth a try."
"Drinkability is kinda low, definitely a good one to try but a tough one to have more than one. Overall a very unique brew, one of the more interesting I have tasted from eastern Europe."
"Black Boss is better than Okocim Porter, and at $1.99 for 500ml, probably the best deal going at my local booze shop. Highly recommended, this is one of the best Polish beers I've had. Black Boss gots balls."
"Pours jet black and slightly viscous with a vanishingly small off-white head. The aroma is slightly coffeeish but almost entirely dominated by earthy and malty characters. Flavor is similar-- malty as hell, and tasting like dirt-- but in a good way. The finish is unmistakable black patent. Even keeping the style in mind just a little more hops would have mad this beer less ""raw," but it's very good and certainly far better than I had expected from a Polish Beer Tasting. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy, drinkability is marginal but decent for a baltic porter."
"Pours an almost opaque black that has a dark ruby tint when held up to the light. Nose is malty and sugary and deep. Strong hints of roasted earth. Flavor is sweet and smooth, but carries a bit too much sweetness I think. Overall it is pretty good and carries some good roasted qualities. The sugary aspect kills it a bit though. Feel is thick with low carbonation. Drinkable, yes. A good one to try."
"Don't quite know why this barely misses the baltic porter big leagues, but still, it's a very enjoyable and tasty thing...more like a good boy than a big boss..."
"This really hides the alcohol quite well, it even is a bit lighter feeling than I would expect from a beer of this strength. Tasty, and because of the unexpected flavors, quite interesting."
"Drinkability: Just too many flaws to be enjoyable; the sweetness becomes overbearing after a while"
"Split a bottle of this with my good friend. I actually thought it one of the best porters I've ever had. Poured a dark black, not completely opaque, but decently dark. Small, off-white head. Nice flavors and aromas of roasted coffee and toasted grained. Slight chalky bitterness. Medium mouthfeel. Not stunning, but still one of the strongest porters I've tasted. Highly drinkable - check it out."
"Pours out black-brown with a tan headskie. $1.50 in Ridgewood for a 500ml bottle! Can't beat that price, but will it be any good? Yes! I've had better big porters, but this one is very smooth and easy to drink. The strength comes through in the flavor, but barely. Well balanced but slightly on the sweet side of things. I'll have to get some more."
"The beer was dark brown, almost black, just shy of opaque, with a thick foamy head. The aroma is malty and strong, definitely you can smell the alcohol. The flavor is mostly the same, with lots of black licorice or anise seed or something dark like that. It gave the feeling of a strong warming liquor, making it a little difficult to finish the bottle."
"Highly recommend this as a great example of a wonderful beer that would make anyone appreciate porters."
"One of the best eastern european porters I have had in a long time. Great looking pitch black brew, great bubbly carbonation with very mild aromas- almost winelike tannins and hints of dark chocolate and earthy malt flavor. Very assertive, chocolate flavors, bittersweet to the max, but there is also that euro-malt flavor going on, not bad though. Cant even detect the ABV, and the brew is smooth and light. A great sour finish makes this porter stand out in complexity. I can tell this one means a headache, but i cant stop drinking."
"drinkability is good for a porter. fans of caramel malts will love this one."
"I couldn't imagine putting away more than 2 of these, and usually one is enough to give me a tummy ache, but damn I like this beer for the price. Goes great with summer BBQs."
"Taste is thin, duh, 9.4%. smooth though and a pleasent coffee/roasty/toasty aftertaste with a bit of chogolate as the mouth dries. pretty nice honestly. Not imaginitve but good."
"Thick, but not overpowering or cloying. Good dessert beer, but ABV limits this to a finisher...I can't imagine having more than one a night."
"D - a flavorful porter with Ummph! Just not a drinkable beer at 9.4% for multiples, but well made. This would make a good ale to cook with. I would pair with sweet mesquite bbq."
"D-The chalk puts me off here, were it not for that i would really enjoy this. As is I will probably get it again if i am in the mood for a Porter without the need for a sixer."
"Pours out very dark brown, almost black. Off-white colored head that leaves small amounts of spotty lacing. In the smell I get molasses, sweet caramel, toffee, a bit of nuttiness, licorice, and just a small amount of roastiness. Taste has much of the same elements as the nose, but has a very nice creamy, yet at the same time soft, roasty finish. Soft carbonation, about medium levels with a luscious full body to back it up. This is 9.4%? I didn't get an alcohol burn or unpleasant alcohol in any way; this is just a very well made porter that I intend on getting much more of."
"Pours a nice little head that falls right away leaving almost no head, but with a little lacing. Color is black, jet black. Smell is sweet and slightly roasty/sour (I think sour). Taste is sweet with a roastiness that's almost soapy or soy. Yeah, really big soy flavor. The aftertaste is a nice balance of roastiness and soy. The mouthfeel is ok, a little carbonation nips at you, but not horrible. Overall, it was nice to try, but I wouldn't have this again without stipulations."
"This beer is great to wash down chocolate!"
"Pours a five finger light brown head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Deep mahogany color. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Roasted coffee nose. Flavor is coffee/chocolate, sweet coffee finish. Higher ABV is hidden. $2.50 for a 500ml bottle from Liquid Solutions Tigard, Or."
"It's soothingly smooth. Alcohol is well-coveredbut can sneak up on you, as it's pretty potent. Sweet, but balanced. I like the nutty touch that gives it a nice addition to the chocolate and licorice. Just the right amount of smokiness that doesn't overpower, but enough to give it some roastiness. The carbonation is right on the spot. And the beer gods rejoice at this treat from Poland..."
"Coffee aroma, and nuts. Mocha head. Baltic style but really a blackened lager from this part of the world. Black but not opaque, with a good amount of head. Mollasses and suger, some ageing and tad of wood in the taste. A bit sweet, and very smooth.Worth trying."
"Again not my beer style of choice so one and done."
"eta: what stood out in the latest tasting was the taste of mineral, the taste of iron, this gives way to a sweetness, not cloying, just a big malty sweetness. Still the alcohol is masked well."
"Black Boss pours an opaque brown-black body with gleeming chestnut orange highlights at the base of the glass. The frothy tan head drops shortly to an average collar, but does leave some craggy rings of lace before it goes. The nose is rich with dark chocolate, licorice, cold black coffee, dried apple, and a waft of alcohol. It hints at some acetylacetate but doesn't display it outright. In the mouth it's full bodied, creamy, and smooth. The flavor offers no surprises from what the nose suggests. It starts with chocolate and fruit and licorice; warms to become even more like black licorice with a touch of spice (no doubt from the alcohol); and finishes drying with a light touch of spice, some dark-skinned fruit, and more dried apples. Roastiness rises in the aftertaste. The alcohol stays in check pretty much throughout the entire serving, reigned in by the dark malt and fruit. Quite nice, and very drinkable despite its girth and strength. Absolutely worth trying!"
"Cheers!"
"D - The 9.4% ABV is well hidden but this beer is rather unimpressive."
"Pours a dark brown/ near black with a creamy tan head. Auburn highlights visible in the body. Vinous aroma of roasted malt and coffee. The mouthfeel borders between medium and full-bodied. This is a vinous, alcoholic porter. Husky grain flavor upfont. There's an understated flavor of chocolate that follows. Alcohol emerges in the flavor in the finish and is not hidden very well. Virtually no bitterness in a very non-dry baltic porter. One of these gets the point across. I downgraded the drinkability not so much because of the high alcohol content, but this this isn't a very interesting baltic porter. Still good enough for a night cap."
"The pour is a very dark black with a deep red hue. The head is dark tan, about a finger. The aroma is very sweet with notes of molasses, dark malts and coffee. Taste follows the aroma, but is even sweeter. The high ABV come through in the flavor as well. Mouthfeel is a bit watery and over sweet and the drinkability is average at best. Overall, this brew leans to far to the sweet side for my taste. There are better examples."
"The mouthfeel is creamy, and very drinkable. A very nice beer for the price ($1.69/bottle), and a very nice beer overall. Not as complicated as some porters, but that may be a virtue of itself. Well worth a try."
"A strong alcohol and bready smell. Taste I found to be typical of many porters, with strong flavors of cocoa. This was a very tasty porter, though a little stronger than the porters I am used to. My wife is Polish and I have come to love many Polish beers, particularly the porters which seem to be one of their better styles. This beer would be a good nightcap porter, and I gave it only an average rating on drinkability because, though it is smooth, I max out at two of these due to the 9.4% ABV."
"All-in-all very solid. If one wanted to get toasted on decent beer, this would be a good one to do it to. Not too expensive and it goes down like water. Good stuff. Not great. But solid."
"M&D: the mouthfeel is superb, lightly carbonated and soothing enough to buttress the fruity-malty theme. The alc. is well-hidden, and the body light, making the beer taste almost like a 6% Schwarzbier~~ very well-crafted and even quaffable Baltic Porter, albeit not amazing (with a capital A). Anyway, this is one of the most impressive Baltic Porters I've luckily tasted!!"
"Mouthfeel is big, thick, and sludgy. A viscous, chewy mouthfeel and slick, creamy texture are probably this beer's best attributes."
"Drinkability: This is hard to drink. It might be okay in a recipe, though... maybe to flavor a mousse or ice cream. At any rate, after having this and the Boss strong lager, I do not think I will be returning to this brewery."
"Alcohol was well hidden."
"For such a high ABV porter, it's drinkable. More than one would be too much, but it's a nice break from lighter beers with less character - not as heavy as a barleywine, not as nutty as a bock, not as dry as a stout."
"The beer poured a pitch black that looked deep purpelish red when held up to a the light and a finger of tan head that didn't retain well throughout the drinking of the beer. The smell was of big, sweet dark chocolates, dark fruits, a brown sugar like sweetness and a faint anis. This beer boasts one awesome nose - I'm fighting myself to not to give it a 5. After the nose, the bee's flavor surprised: a dry begining with with warm, sweet malts in the finish that opened and deepened as the beer warmed. The mouthfeel was full and warm; this is a beer to be sipped. The drinkability is medium from a filling, malty sweet beer but with a high abv."
"This is a malt mutha' loving beer. The Anti-IPA."
"Taste like a treacle tart with all the good sweetness inherent in that snack. Almost too sweet but i aged this one a bit so the balance was prety good. The malt body was well rounded with a real almost English profile to the style. Not what I expected as most Polish porters tend be quite dry. Worth buying for sure."
"Black ruby. Smells and tastes a lot like prune juice mixed with cheap coffee, the kind you get at an AA meeting or in a hospital waiting room. Mouthfeel is medium to full and obnoxiously dusty. There is an appreciated slight woody character to the beer but otherwise Im not much of a fan. On the plus side, I will admit that the price is right and the 9.4% ABV is very, very well covered. I would not have guessed this beer to be anywhere near that strength. Theyve done a few things right with this one."
"This pours a jet black with a large tan foamy head. The smell has a very strong dark fruit,prunes and raisins, with alittle coffee. The taste is good with a full fruit flavor and some coffee. The m/f is medium with well balanced flavors. This is a good beer, but I prefer porters with more of a coffee flavor than dark fruit ones."
"Pretty good brew..but, you have to like sweet beers...I will buy this again."
"So much diveristy in the Baltic Porter Style. The brewer's are all in different countries speaking different languages, so they aren't really copying each other. It great."
"Chestnut colored with ruby highlights, a beige sizzly head rises up and settles quickly. Aroma is light, but distinctively has chalky cocoa notes and roasted malts. Flavor is smokey roasted malt upfront, followed by molasses and sharp currant, moving to notes of brandy and port. Finishes smokey, followed by zingy carbonation and a hop tingle. The back of my throat feels warm down about halfway, and the roof of my mouth is numbing. Mouthfeel is full, somewhat chalky. Fairly drinkable for a big beer."
"Pours a deep dark brown with ruby highlights. Light shines through a vibrant red. The half-inch head is a pretty light brown. Sweet aroma of roasted dark malt, caramel, raisins, and cocoa powder. Palate seems sweetened with lactose - a roasted malt backbone accented by raisins, prunes, cocoa, and other tasty dark sweet things. Body is wonderfully full and creamy. Goes down quite easy for such a strong beer."
"Raisins, walnut, chocolate and some dried cherries in the aroma. Reddish brown/black with a frothy, but thin head. Huge raisin blast in the fore followed by another huge blast of black licorice and then mild marzipan notes in the middle. Finish wafts on through with dry black licorice notes and a chalky raisin/licorice/burnt aftertaste. This is very nice."
"Super awesomely cool thanks to BuckeyeNation for the surprise!"
"A very nice brew and one I am glad to have been given the opportunity to try."
"This is a great European porter and so very drinkable at 9.4% ABV. I was shocked at how smooth this beer is at this strength."
"I get brown sugar, molasses and toffee with a mix of raisins again. The alcohol is dangerously well hidden and I think this would be a sneaky beer to have more than 2 of. Easy drinkin and smooth but with a hidden wallop! Definitely worth a try if you like to catch a buzz while you enjoy a tasty beer!"
"A clean dark brown/black beer with deek mahogony highlights. Has a big bubbly dark beige head. The aroma starts with a bit of roasted malt followed by a vannilla note and a hint of alcohol. Big bittersweet chocolate start to the flavor. a quick licorice passes thru before the coffee candy finish."
"I can't see drinking more than one of these 16 ounce bottles."
"This beer pours a deep brown color nearly black but not quite. Sort of a thinner dark tan head holds up top then reduces to a skim layer above the liquid. Aroma of roasted malts, molasses, and burnt cherries. Taste is a bit simplistic but still enjoyable. Dark fruits and toasted grains seem to maintain the initial flavors of the beer. A fortified wine feeling comes towards the middle then comes the acidic finish. Body is a tad thin but that helps this beer go down rather easily. Alcohol isn't too perceptible which also helps this beer go down too easily. Overall a nice Baltic Porter, esp for the price ($1.99/16.9 oz bottle)."
"500 ml bottle. This beer pours out dark brown with a small head. Strong aroma of molasses and brown sugar. Burnt sugar and malt flavor. Some chocolate. Beyond this, I don't get much flavor. Maybe a little bitter roastiness. Medium mouthfeel. Pretty good drinkability despite it's strength and sweetness. This beer has a one dimensional flavor, but it's not bad."
"I recognize not many people need that unorthodox studying help, but starting out an evening of drinking with this beer is an excellent idea. At ~10% alcohol this beer is amazingly drinkable. Some alcohol warmth, but that's it. Otherwise this beer is a very run-of-the-mill baltic porter, nothing too special about it. If you want alcohol in your system in a tastey, inexpensive, yet highly effective manner, this is the way to go."
"This one goes well with 4AM white catle meals. No seriously. Seriously. I digress. Dark black, cola brown, nearly opaque, but not quite. Compact mocha head that dies, but leaves a tad bit of lacing as well. Aromas of sweet roasted malts, chocolate malted milkshakes, coffee, bittersweet cooking chocolate, leafy hops, and oily bread. Taste is quite nice as well, roasty and chocolatey with some bitter coffee notes and an oily, slighlty hoppy, and yummy finish. Mouthfeel is a bit light for the 9.4% this one is packing, but it works oh-so-well and ups the drinkability of this bad boy quite a bit. A fantastic baltic porter, and the only one that stands up to a 4AM white castle meal!"
"I was definately looking forward to drinking this one, poured a nice tall glass and was surprised that the head was not as large as I expected it to be. It dissipated rather quickly as well. When holding it to the light, it was not as opaque as I was expecting and had a reddish hue. The smell of it was great. The taste was not as impressive, but I did enjoy the chewyness. Overall it was a good porter worth drinking again."
"Pours black with some garnet highlights and a one-finger off-white head that dissapates to a thin coating. Nose is roasted grains and espresso with a mysterious fruity sweet kick. The taste has a similar two-faced profile. Starts off with roasted barley, coffee and dark chocolate, then pulls a 180' on you and dives into a raisin/prune/date dark fruitiness with an alcohol bite. The finish is much sweeter than I have ever experienced in a porter. It was a little off-putting at first, but I got used to it half way through the pint. This is an interesting brew no-doubt. The alcohol is hidden rather well for 9.4% and the mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation. The jury is still out on the taste profile, it was interesting if not a little cloying, but worth a try at this unbeatable price. It'll get you drunk!"
"The beer upon its evacuating the 500ml brown bottle takes up but temporary residence in my glass a deep brown to almost black color with a smallish light chocolate head that vanishes rather quickly leaving a dangerously thin skirt of lace to encircle the glass. Nose has a splendid burnt grain aroma with a sweet malt backing, caramel, and a somewhat earthy tone present; start is sweet with a nice grain profile, the top middling in its feel. Finish has a vigorous acidity and the hops delightfully spicy, and the 9.4 percent ABV leaves a nice warm feeling in the belly, a darn tasty brew this Black Beauty!"
"Reviewing this simultaneously with the Aldaris Porteris. Looks very nice, black, and bright red where the light shows through, with a tan head and nice lacing. Has a very distinct scent of prunes, olives, molasses, and vinegar. Also alcoholic. For lack of a better term, it smells Greek. Taste is similar, strange fruits and and alcohol. It's sickeningly sweet and sour at the same time. The only time it seems like a porter is at the end with some caramely notes. No chocolate or coffee here. I can definitely see why people would like this, as it has a powerful, unique flavor, but it's not for me."
"[Edit: Black Boss is much closer to the Baltic porter style than I realized when I wrote this review and is a very good version.]"
"For a 9.4% beer this is dangerously drinkable..alcohol is barely noticed in the taste."
"I really enjoyed this brew and will have it again. Sooner rather than later."
"Have fun!"
"This goes down quite easy. Probably a little too easy for something that's 9.4%, but hey, I only bought one. Definitely a rich tasting beer, so it's perfect after a satisfying meal. Not really a session beer, but who expects that of a Baltic Porter?"
"Up to this point, I've had truly divine Baltic porters (i.e. Zywiec, Okocim, Sinebrychoff, Carnegie, Stepan Razin), and mediocre ones (Baltika, Utenos). This falls squarely in the middle, leaning somewhat better."
"Drinkability: For such a strong porter, this one is remarkably enjoyable to drink. I can foresee issues though, when putting about 6 pints of this down in a sitting."
"As for the properties of this beer, I noted every bad, funky beer chemical on the shelf: lots of sulfur, rotten eggs, butterscotch, fusels, etc. There were also some heartening threads of coffee and licorice and no inherent flaws in the appearance or mouthfeel. But the beer as a whole was a hand grenade of failed expressions. Stay away."
"If you're in the mood for an overly strong, extra-pleasurable Polish porter for everyday enjoyment, I'd nominate the Big Boss, for sure!"
"A quality drinker. I really enjoyed this beer, and despite its higher alcohol content, it was well masked and didn't play into it much at all. Well done."
"Drinkability  Lets see, two bucks a bottle, 9.4% alcohol, kick-ass taste, hmmm  OK, you talked me into it."
"$1.50 for 500 mL at the CT Bev in Newington. A great deal for a pretty dang good beer, if you ask me. I was definitely surprised, and would recommend trying this if you happen to run upon it."
"This is delicious and am glad it is not locally available as this drink could very easily lead me happiliy to severe alcoholism."
"The label says that this beer is made in collaboration between Boss Brewery in Poland and Ölverket, the Beer Department in Sweden. An organisation or company or whatever that I never before have heard about, although I can agree with their slogan, something like drink easy  drink good"
