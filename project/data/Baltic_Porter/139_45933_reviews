"o: An easy drinking and flavorful porter with a good malt profile and hop bite, if perhaps a bit mild compared to some of today's Imperials. Needs to be around the suggested 55 degrees or warmer to taste its best."
""

"Overall - Nice sent and a good appearance but the taste is fairly boring. Quite drinkable but just not something that I'd have any reason to search out again."
"The aroma is wht weak spot for me, with the dark roasted malts presenting a slightly sour note. Improved maredly with some warming/airing. The taste is better, with just an acceptable hint of sourness at times, but a little more burnt flavor than I prefer. Still, nicely rich dark malt flavor with a momentary hit of sweet up front."
""

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark fruit, and slight cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with char and dark fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but fairly boring in my opinion."

"Overall- Probably should pass this one by. Nothing wrong with it; it's just quotidian. It seems to be true to the style guidelines and mellows out as it opens up. However, it doesn't become more interesting."

"O: I gave it an ""OK."" I had it after a Yards Tavern Porter, which at 7% ABV is just a notch under this supposedly ""Imperial"" offering, and I preferred the Yards."

"Pugsley Sig looks fantastic poured - dark and rich with impressive ""look at me"" head that lingers on forever. But the nose is weak with a faint hint of metallic notes. Mouthfeel is nice and full though. Taste.. not so much. Starts interesting - toasted malts and hard coffee but soon butterscotch flavor overpowers and then pure bitterness. Toasted malts taste more like burnt malts. This Imperial porter is not your everyday drink. It's demanding and unruly."
"Barrel-aged or ridiculously over-the-top porters and stouts are the order of the day for edgy American breweries. But for their 'Signature Series' Shipyard has opted to go a more traditional, domesticated route, and they did well at it. This strikes a great balance between, on one end of the scale, familiarity, and, on the other, excessiveness. An easy one to recommend."

"Final Grade: 3.62, a B grade. Shipyard's Imperial Porter is one of the most bipolar beers I've ever reviewed. It looks amazing and definitely tastes pretty good, but the weak aroma and thin, fizzy mouthfeel do not help this beer's case at all. I still have to give this stuff a thumbs up, but the aforementioned flaws prevent it from being a truly memorable imperial porter. There are local options (Wellington RIS and Grand River's Russian Gun) that are more affordable and equally satisfying, so this is not something I am likely to repurchase. Not an amazing deal at its LCBO price point, but potentially worth a try if you want a changeup."
"Too much char for my taste, too one-dimensional."
""
"O - tasty and bold, definitely glad my BA in crime decided to include this one"
"M - Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation."
""
"O - Overall a tasty Imperial Porter, nice flavour profile that posseses a solid cocoa profile and a hint of sweetness. Quite tasty and easily drinkable. One of the better brews in the Pugsley Series for sure."

"O - This is probably the best beer I've had from Shipyard. Well done."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
"A pretty decent imperial porter. Good balance and flavoring all around. I'd really enjoy another bottle or two on down the road..."
""
"Medium body, good level of carbonation, sticky on the lips."
""
"Black with some burgundy highlights, big dense tan head with loads of lacing and good retention. Sweet nose, some dark fruits, chocolate and some brown sugar. Light almond liqueur scent with a whiff of alcohol. Taste has chocolate, roast, dark malts and some sweetness. Bitter hopping that's a little much for me. Body is fairly thin, carbonation is medium. OK flavours, but body is thin and this isn't really anything too exciting."
""
""
"Overall, OK. The roast flavour is nice but too much anise and the vegetal flavour is not great."
""
""
""
"Near black in colour, 2 fingers of tan head, big sheets of lace on the glass and good retention. Smell is strong of anise, bits of roast and coffee, some fruit and herbal/vegetal notes also, little hop presence but mostly herbal anise/black liquorice. Deeply roasted and almost ashy, chocolate and coffee present mid palate, finishing with a bit of tart fruit and black liquorice/anise but not as strong as it is in the nose. High and sometimes prickly carbonation, light-med body though it felt thin at points. Overall this is pretty average and not all that drinkable, the above average flavours aren't enough to make up for nose and mouthfeel for me, wont revisit this I don't think."
"o - what was this beer once? may have been great but this bottle is definitely in decline. i'd really like to get my hands on a fresh batch and try again."
"Almost perfect. Exactly what I'm looking for in a beer. Wish is had more alcohol, being an imperial porter, but that's picking nits. Excellent beer."

"Pretty amazing. Strong, dark and tasty."
"O - A really good porter I would recommend and buy whenever I can!"
"Overall, this is a nice porter worth a try."
""
""
"O: Don't think I'll be going out of my way to find this one again. Not bad but there are better options."
""
""
""

""

"Overall a nice Imperial porter, a little touch of sweetness and a little less carbonation would make this a much better Porter."
""
""
"The body lacks the fullness and depth of some Finnish, Polish and Swedish Baltic Porters, but it is a really enjoyable brew anyway."
""
""
""
""
""
"A damn fine beer. Well balanced, flavorful. Hides it's booze well and is quite drinkable. A repeat coming in my future throughout the cold winter nights."
"D: This was not a bad porter, but the scent and taste weren't great and the body was weak. The alcohol was well hidden, so it wasn't difficult to drink. But it wasn't really exciting to drink either. Not recommended."
""
""
""
""
"This was a refreshing reminder that 'imperial' porters/stouts needn't be off the wall and full of chocolate/vanilla/chile/bourbon/etc to be good."
"Decent little Imp Porter. A slightly bolder body and a touch more rounded sweetness would help immensely."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is on the thicker side and a little syrupy. Carbonation is moderate. Overall I didn't really think it was a very good beer of the style. The buttery, caramel flavors were just overdone for me and not that enjoyable. The roasty, chocolaty porter characteristics just seemed overshadowed, which didn't work well for me."
""
"Very dark with just a faint mahogany edge visible. A gentle pour produced a couple inches of fluffy tan foam, much more than expected. Good head retention, a bit of clumpy lacing. Lots of dark malts in the aroma, burnt and chocolate, nutty and malted milk, mild caramel and a hint of smoke. Plenty going on in the flavour, building from a malty base of chocolate and caramel. Notes of fruity cherries and licorice, mild vanilla, slight roast in addition to the burnt malts. Medium bodied with moderate-plus carbonation, mild astringency from the dark malts and faint alcohol spiciness. Overall it was quite nice, but would have been better with carbonation a bit lower."
""

"Where do I get the gold-foil-tipped pen Pugsley uses on these labels...? Anyway, this stuff pours a dark russet brown topped by a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, light toasted caramel, very light coffee, and a touch of seared wood. The taste brings in more of the same, but with a stronger char/vinyl character, along with some deep molasses notes. Something tells me they overdid it a bit on the black patent malts here. This character tends toward the astringent and kinda ruins the whole experience for me. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a mostly solid porter, but that astringency holds it back significantly. Beyond that, though, pretty good."
"Not bad, but there are too many other porters I will seek out over this one in the future."
"O: All in all, a nice porter. The nose could use some work, and I've had better flavors, but this is quite nice and is possibly the creamiest porter I've ever had."
"Overall it is a fine beer, nicely roasted malts, could be a fuller mouthfeel but overall is a nice beer"
"I gave this a vigorous pour into a nonic glass. Came out dark, opaque and black in dim lighting, with a tremendous bit of roast on the nose. Body is thin and creamy, with some sweet and tart notes that remind me of a milk stout. It’s not a big and boozy as I remember it being, but this might be due to the fact that I’m drinking a bottle with a ‘best by’ date of March 2011 and it’s mid September. Or maybe I just remember it differently, as the last one I had was towards the end of winter. All in all it’s a solid porter. While I wouldn’t suggest cellaring it for years and years I think it’s held up nicely over the last 9 months."
"Poured from a bomber and served in a pint glass, the beer is a deep, dark brown coloring with some chestnut highlights around the edges of the glass. Poured with a ton of light tan head at first, but it quickly settled into a thin film of dense head. Aromas are slightly coffee and dark chocolate, with a slight booze characteristic. The beer's flavors are more coffee centric, with a good balance of dark chocolate and a highlight of milk chocolate. Very complex and well blended. Bitter from the coffee and from hops hit the tail end of the palate, cleaning everything up nicely. No cling on the glass, and the beer tends to be standard for the Porter style, with a thin, light body overall. The aftertaste is heavy on the bitters, with highlights of the coffee and chocolate flavors lacing through. The finish is slick at first, and then dry through the end. Very strong, robust flavors, but not overpowering or off-putting. Extremely tasty brew."
"Overall, the beer is pleasant to drink, just not in the style advertise. It was somewhat closer to a scotch ale..."
"O- Very drinkable...but thinner than I hoped after the beautiful pour. Just does not compare to any BAS. Maybe an unfair comparison as it is not BA...and is a porter...but is what I have come to expect when I see that coloring."
"D: Overall I thought it was a pretty good representation of the style, nice mix of flavors and feel and it delivers on the abv end making it a nice imperial style beer."
"O - Pretty good, a solid 7 percenter, good for a cold night or a bruins game 7!"
"Narrative: An antechamber of silence awaited the gawky dauphine. He was born with an awkward gait and a quiet disposition that made him likeable to his peers, if not compliant and easy to manipulate. The unforseen early death of his mother cast a great weight upon his frail shoulders and now an impovershed nation looked upon him for guidance. ""H-hey...we sh...maybe we should st...start the ceremony? If you w w wwant to?"" "Yes my liege."" A great velvet cape was cast around this negligent prince and he was escorted to the regal balcony to make his address. Thousands of serfs clamored below awaiting some direction in this hour of great sadness. ""Hey...hey fellas, well...I guess we..we gotta get moving in the right direction and so..I was thinking maybe tithing could be increased...just to y..you know, get capital flowing, if that's ok with you guys?"" The crowd almost unanimously shook their heads, it was their curse for they were not subjects of the Ottoman or the Byzantine, they were the reluctant subjects of the Shipyard Empire."
"Overall this is a drinkable and pleasant enough beer. But if you are expecting to find the traditional porter characteristics, you will be disappointed"
"This beer pours a thick black color with a finger of tan bubbly head. The aroma is strong with coffee ground and smoke. The taste starts smokey and then has strong notes of coffee bitterness... These are almost a bit overwhelming. The mouthfeel is somewhat empty and watery. Overall worth a try."
"An enjoyable enough beer. Just not one of the better Imperial Porters."
"MF: Surprisingly thin for a porter, with flavors that make it seem like it should have a little more body for support. Thinness makes it highly drinkable."
"o: This was certainly unique, I've never tasted anything like it. Not bad, but not for me."
"D: This is a pretty nice porter, would buy this again for sure."
"This beer is not heavy in the mouth or the tummy. Easy to drink"
"This was a pretty good beer, very good flavor, a bit filling so its not easy to drink more than one or two. I might drink this again."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, although there are better beers in the style that I would choose first, this is still a solid beer worth drinking for a while."
"Drinks very easy, ABV is well hidden, a respectable take on the style. I don't like a lot of shipyard's stuff, but their bigger stuff is not bad..."
"D - This is easily one of Shipyard's best."
"D: This to me is just a borderline imperial stout, it drinks fairly easily, but not what I expect from something labeled ""Imperial""."
"D: Nice enough porter, but with the exorbitant prices the bomber goes for makes it a definite pass at the price."
"D - Yes very drinkable for the ABV. It goes down very smoothly. So smoothly it would get me in trouble quickly."
"Bottle poured into a new Belgium fat tire bottom inscribed globe glass from a 1 pint 6 oz bottle. Huge head became puffy in middle as it receeded around the edges. Smell was slightly weak due to head but smelled of dark roasted malts, caramel, chocolate. Tasted like nose smell, nice chocolate on the front end, low bitterness, extremely heavy carbonation, almost too much. Prickly on tongue, sweet deep malts in the after taste, low on hops aroma and hops taste, but alcohol is well hidden. Could drink this slowly throughout the evening. Honestly an average imperial porter missing something, maybe some depth and complexity. Excellent as a porter style in fact Style is dead on. Nice beer, would be better with age, I got impatient.... Again lol"
"I can be hard on porters that don't please me, but I like this one. Whatever small faults it may have, the bittersweet malty flavor I expect in a porter is there in spades."
"Poured a mahogany color into a pint glass, with a beige head that didn't retain or lace very well, but some carbonation was apparent. The nose revealed caramel, roasted malt, and modest chocolate nuances, but wasn't that pronounced overall. The flavor was though was in fact more pronounced, certainly with some chocolate, caramel, and toffee notes, but a big contribution came from the roasted/coffee notes. The finish was semi-dry as a result. Alcohol content was well-hidden. Semi-thick feel, with a little more carbonation than expected. Good beer, but a little too dominated by the roastiness, for my taste."
"This beer was better than I expected. Good flavor, good balance. I'm not sure I'd call it an imperial, but that's the only complaint."
"I just wish there as more to this beer in both flavor and mouthfeel."
"Snifter pour and I am met with a black liquid and a beige foamy head which starts out massive but trickles to a ring around the glass. The smell consists of tobacco, smoke, butterscotch, leather and roasted malts. The taste is on the bitter side with malt leading the way. There is some smokey taste in there as well and a nice bite on the finish. Sort of sweet on the swallow. Mouthfeel is rather average based on the going's on. Very easily drunk even for a 7.10. The taste is nice enough where a bomber left me wanting more. Nice Imperial Porter though make sure to let it warm as the flavors really intensify."
"D - pass."
"Notes: The flavors were nice, and it was an enjoyable beer, but other than the smell I wouldn't have guessed this was an Imperial Porter. That said, it is an enjoyable porter."
"Overall this is a good beer, not great. Nothing I will remember for the rest of my life, but still decent. Not a horendoues price point but not worth seeking out."
"D- This was aged for about a year before opening but if I had another I'd definitely look forward to more age!"
"The body of this beer is what really kills it, if the burnt vegetal note was also gotten rid of this could actually be a really good English-leaning Imperial Porter. As it is though, this is drinkable, but really more interesting to try and pick out its flaws than to try and actually drink. I actually had some high hopes for this beer as I figured the age would give the yeast a chance to settle in."
"Very impressive, a really robust Porter here. Very balanced, and with just enough complexity to make it interesting without cutting into its drinkability."
"It's a good beer but left me looking for more, as porters go it was middle of the road."
"pours black with little head- what there is subsides to a thin swirl. Smells malty and a little fruity, followed by some chocolate aromas, but all quite dry. Tastes quite similar, but with some earthy notes at the end that help round out the flavors. Quite dry in the mouth, this seems like it's somewhere between an English porter and a Baltic porter. Not bad at all, but not nearly definitive of the style."
"Not the best porter I've ever had, but its no slouch either."
"Imperial porter brought back from Vermont. Pours dark brown with soapy head. A nice roast,puff of smoke, strong licorice above all,a bit of chocolate, licorice anise mostly.A tad below average mouthfeel.Warrior, English Fuggles, and East Kent Goldings Hops"
"Overall, a nice porter that has more of the flavor profile of a coffee porter than a Baltic porter. Definitely the best offering I've ever had from Shipyard as well. Worth a try, especially on tap."
"drinkability is good. pretty well balanced. a fairly nice porter."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. A bit of warmth going down. Solid beer but not very porter like. Thanks Russ!"
"OK, let's see if Maine can redeem the East Coast...Pours a wicked super-dark mahogany - near to black. Head is a beautiful tan, persistent, leaves awesome lace. Really robust aroma, tons of dark chocolate, maybe some cinnamon, a little raspberry...complex and yummy smelling. Flavor is intense - deep, tangy bites of the chocolate roast hit you right away, and with an excellent, full mouth of flavor. VERY robust and delicious. Strong hop character on the finish, with some sour fruit rolling around in there. Outstanding beer, really delicious. $5.99/bomber though so it's not cheap, but it is worth every penny."
"Not exactly what I was hoping for, but it's not bad. Their is definitely a carbonation issue which leads to a healthy amount of burping. I would pass on this one next time."
"The pint glass allows enough light in to show the beer's deeper brown character at the edges, and it ends up almost black in the center. Many people find the skunky, angry nose unpleasant, but given the style I think it's an exceptionally interesting character. One does not drink this beer expecting calm and pleasant. The slick, almost sticky mouthfeel wasn't my favorite aspect, but the robust, almost chewy chocolaty flavor redeems the mouth coating thickness. Good for a single pint though I can't imagine the pallet that can handle more than that. A good closer for a night of tasting."
"Taste is decent, lots of roasted chocolate and burnt coffee, it's got a very nice mouthfeel though, it's really creamy with nice carbonation, but that's the highlight of this beer. It's decent and I got it cheap but don't pay more than $3-4 for a bomber."
"Seems like Shipyard was trying to overcome mediocrity with high ABV."
"Balanced mouthfeel, it's not gnarly thick but most definitely not a chugger either. It keeps you wanting more while also satisfying you at the same time. Great brew in my opinion although it's not overly notable on the whole of all the beers I've tried."
"Out of a bomber bottle (that I needed for brewing purposes!) this beer was an almost completely opaque, dark brown color with one finger of tan head. The retention was pretty good, especially as a skim and the lacing in broken bands. The aroma was of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate malt, bittersweet chocolate and baking cocoa. The flavors were similarly slanted towards the dark/roasty side but with little complexity beyond that. I tasted sweet caramel and chocolate malt up front with some light molasses notes as well followed by the coffee, roasted malt and alcohol heat. The hops did give enough bitterness to balance the malt elements especially towards the end. Slightly nutty and maybe slightly spicy but otherwise straight forward; sweet malt, dark malt, bitter finish. The mouthfeel was average, perhaps a little oily, the body full and the carbonation a little high and frothy especially at first."
"This was marked down to really cheap so I picked one up. Way too sweet for my taste buds, not enough body or roasted flavors. I suppose you get what you pay for, glad I didn't pay full price."
"D: over all a pretty decent offering from shipyard. Probably would not drink a whole one due to the sweetness in the beer."
"Shipyard, you guys used to be cool. Wtf happened?"
"This was a decent strong porter, but there was nothing particularly unique about it. Nice head and lace, smell was a bit acrid, the taste had a bit of diacetyl but was otherwise nice, decent chocolate. Medium bodied mouthfeel, the drinkability was good, as I finished it before I realized to really type the review a few minutes ago while working on something else! Wouldn't go out of my way to seek out though, the packaging makes it look more special then it is...."
"Somewhat dry especially at the finish. Pretty good but nothing great. While the smell and taste are good and reasonably complex, they don't really line up well together."
"D: Overall, this was a ""meh"" experience. No strong feelings one way or the other. If someone gave me one, I wouldn't complain about drinking it."
"In some ways it comes close to being something special, especially in the nose. But it falls short in other ways. Some interesting influences don't quite gel and balance, unfortunately, as well as I'd like them to. A good but not great beer, and one I doubt I'll reach for often if at all, considering the other options."
"Overall: It just didn't work. I had it the same day as the Pugsley's Series Imperial IPA (both being delayed birthday presents from a good friend), which was actually quite good, which made me all the more disappointed with this one."
"Pours visibly thick and has a light and clear dark brown color crowned with a light and tan creamy head. The nose is sweet with hints of robust coffee and sweet chocolate. The flavor however, is more focused on the coffee. Very robust and warming coffee flavors flow well through the heavy body with low carbonation. The finish begins to fade with a slightly vinous flavor and fades slowly before it ends cleanly."
"Drinkability: With a change to the malt bill that would elinate the char and a bit more of a fuller body, this might be a keeper"
"Notes: Just an extremely average brew."
"Notes: To tell you the truth, I've had a handful of regular American Porters that offered fuller bodies and bolder flavor profiles than this ""Imperial."" The body indicates that this is way under-malted, while the flavor says it's overly burnt. This is just not a very good beer in my own humble opinion. I want my $7.99 back!"
"overall an average porter."
"Poured a deep, deep brown with good crabonation and nice dirty white head. Nose is mainly cheap cocoa powder and some roastiness. Taste is pretty awful. Lots of cocoa powder that I could have pulled from my kitchen, thing bodied, astringent and a light roastiness. Mouthfeel is thin some booze more cocoa powder. Avoid."
"D - In the end, it was a very satisfying Imperial Porter that could cause a person to open another one at completion. The chocolate/coffee/cream taste was delightful."
"Overall it was very solid. I was impressed as the series had me wondering after the barleywine, but this redeemed itself nicely and was enough to get me to come back again."
"Unfortunately the bomber was a difficult journey to get thru. I was hoping for more given how much I enjoyed the 'Smashed Pumpkin' of the Pugsley series. But this just didn't do a whole lot for me and found it to be the norm for what Shipyard usual brews. And @ $9.00 for the bomber, its passable."
"Medium heavy body, with some decent ligering effects on the back of your tounge. Would love to have another, big fan of the Pugsley series altoghether."
"D - Overall, this is a very good Imperial Porter with lots of chocolate cake character and plenty of hop bitterness. The alcohol remained well-concealed for an Imperial brew."
"Aroma is not strong, but it does tempt the taste buds. It is more sweet than smoky, being mainly chocolaty and molasses-ish with a yeasty overtone - rather unusual. It pours an opaque dark chocolate brown with a fairly thick pale beige head. Flavor is smokier than the aroma and mainly of sweet chocolate with a molasses undertone and nutty and yeast hints. Texture is smooth as glass and just a little fizzy, leaving a slightly sweet finish."
"D-Good stuff. Never a big fan of Shipyard brew, you can keep your Ringwood yeast thanks, this one plenty of flavour to keep it interesting. I REALLY liked the aroma!"
"D: A decent porter that I'm glad I tried. It's not earth-shattering but it's not your usual Shipyard either."
"Beer poured deep brown with ruby highlights and a large tan head. Nose is malty with some hints of cocoa powder. Taste is semi sweet from the cocoa influence balanced nicely by a decent hopping leading to a dry finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and fairly smooth. Drinkability is good. This is a nice beer that is a bit overpriced. But given I am a sucker for a big porter I had to try it and would recommend it to porter fans."
"3.5/3/2.5/3.5/2"
"Drinkabilty is awesome given the style. I'd buy this again."
"Pours a very nice black color, nice carbonation, huge three-finger plus creamy tan head, with lots of sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate/toffee/caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, with a nice dose of dark stuff. Medium body, this is a nice chewy brew. Drinkable, a nice one, thanks Bill."
"Pretty disappointing beer, honestly. Won't be having this one again."
"D - Good overall. Nothing to get to excited about, but a well crafted beer though."
"D: An okay beer. Nothing I will remember for the rest of my life, but still decent. But decent is not really enough for a Baltic/Imperial porter - there are so many better beers of this style out there."
"This is the second Pugsley's Series I've had, first one being the English Barley Wine. They are both unique in their own right. This one has a great mouthfeel. Perfect amount of carbonation and texture feels just right. I can taste the hops in the background and they seem to compliment this beer nicely. As the beer warms, it becomes even better. A little less bite and little more smoothness."
"With the exception of Old Thumper ESA and Brewer's Choice Special Ale 2006, I have been supremely unimpressed with Shipyard Brewing Company beer. Imperial Porter shows what Mr. Pugsley is capable of when he sets his mind to it. $10 per bomber is a little steep, but I'm not sorry that I gave this special release a (temporary) home."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a small head that falls quickly and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is mostly comprised of a chocolate malt character with maybe a hint of coffee, not much more, but the chocolate is pretty intense. The flavor is quite chocolaty (sp?). There is a touch of roasted malt that leaves a bitterness on the tongue that is different than hop bitterness. It finishes pretty sweet, but not too sweet. The alcohol is pretty well masked behind the sweetness as well. The body is quite full and the drinkability is good."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a large light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of lightly sweet black chocolate with some light dry coffee. Taste is also dominated by some creamy black chocolate with a lightly bitter finish. Creamy palate with fuller then average body with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol makes this beer even more enjoyable. No the most complex beer out there but well done for what it intended to be."
"Tastes a bit more even. Dry hops up front, heavy on the fuggles, which moves into a rough porter middle of roasted grain. The sourness comes from the strength of the roasted malt, and it gives the beer a flavor that's close to an oatmeal stout, only with a fine alcoholic zing. Unique, certainly. Not a baltic but a beer all its own."
"D- An enjoyable beer that goes down alright. The sweetness does become a bit much. Good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get this."
"D: Nothing wrong with this one, and it is better than average. But that's all."
"Very heavy brew, where the roasted character is the main event, verging on being the only event. Not bad - in fact, pretty interesting. Something I can only handle in moderation though."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a tremendous malt nose that boasts of chocolate and roasted malts. It's sweet and creamy smelling with some Ringwood yeast esters. The taste is good. It has a more robust character than the aroma suggests. It's dry and roasted with some hints of chocolate malt in the finish. The esters are hard to pick up. The patent/roasted malts must be potent enough to hide it. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an easy drinking imperial porter. I like the malt character quite a bit. This is the best Shipyard beer I've ever had."
"Notes: This is quite a brew from Shipyard it's perfect for a cool night. Cheers."
"Not a bad Baltic Porter. Too bad it's only a limited release, I would like to see more of these."
"Drinkability: this one goes down very easy and has a nice flavor profile. Buy one of these if you see it."
"Overall, not horrible but not great either. There are better porters to be had."
"The best beer i've tried from this brewery so far. Not bad at all."
"Notes from and tasted on: 5/21/09"
"D - Good, not great example of the style. The yeast character is throwing me off a bit but the roasted malt profile works well. Could use some more complexity and a cleaner lager-like character."
"This is a complex good porter."
"Bottle from the Vacaville, CA BevMo. Pours a nice dark brown with a creamy light brown chocolate head. Laces fairly strongly, and stickily too. A very pretty beer. Nose has hints of chocolate and toasty grains. Flavor is rich and creamy, with a little dry malt bitterness clawing through. Lots of nice truffle-like chocolate fudge, some roasted grains. Barely a hint of alcohol. Very little fruity flavor, which i generally like in this type of beer, but there's a little yeasty character that mixes in with the chocolate and serves the same purpose. Very, very tasty.Extremely smooth and creamy. Wonderful full body and texture. This one was a really, really nice surprise. I could drink a few more of these (well, maybe not tonight!)"
"Would definitely recommend this."
"Medium carbonation but the thin body makes it seems as if this one is over carbonated. Not very enjoyable to be honest and doesn't make me crave another sip in between sips either. Way too thin of a body and lacks complexity and presence on the palate."
"Dark brown with ruby highlights. Pretty quick foam that recedes to nothing. Creamy and deep roasted malts help give this beer a coffee and dark chocolate aroma. Mayb a little vine ripened fruit and smoke a well. Very smooth roaste malts have a lovely char to it. While the creamy, mocha flavors blend together well. Creamy smooth start with a roasted coffee and grain finish. A mix of sip and session. Lots of flavor and hard to detect alcohol."
"An unexpected gift from Oscar at The Red in Santa Cruz. Pours ruby brown with a wispy, wet tan head. Okay retention, no lacing. Aroma is mainly cocoa with black coffee and some nuts, possibly some diacetyl butteriness. Flavor is one dimensional: black coffee. Just tastes bitter and thin, like someone aged seltzer water in a used-coffee-filter-lined barrel."
"Poured murky dark brown with a dense tan head. Thick lacing creeps down the sides with the beer. Heavily chocolate and caramel nose, along with an very earthy/peat aroma. Low carbonation in the mouthfeel, but avoids feeling flat or watery. Powerful roasted malt and caramel taste up front that ebbs slightly to a Baker's chocolate taste. Heavy molasses throughout. A wooden barrel flavor blended with peat/earth again pops up and stays until the finish. Slightly veggie and soy sauce at times when it warmed up. It was good, but felt like a meal."
"Really seems more stout than Baltic Porter. For one thing it is quite dry and smoky for the style. For a second there really isn't and fruity or fig flavors to this. Not really something I will order again."
"22 oz. bomber. Nice gold tin foil on top. The beer poured a deep dark color that I couldn't even quite figure out. I am gonna go with it being black. Hmmm. Not much in the way of head. Some tan colors along the side, but nothing that spectacular.The nose was somewhat thin. A bit of sharp alcohol with a deep breath. Some thick meaty flavors popped up just on the edge and just the slightest hint of molasses. The taste was a bit better than the smell. Nice roasty flavors, rich notes of bitter chocolate. A slick, sweet finish. Mouthfeel was a bit sharp, but not too creamy. Perhaps a tad too much carbonation. This was an okay go at the style, but it lacks a bit of the real definition that I like in the porter style. I'll stick with Old Thumper when I drink Shipyard."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a scant 1/8"" dark brown head over the almost opaque dark brown brew. What head there is quickly recedes to the rim, encircling a swirly skim, with leggy slow-falling lace. Aroma is dark malt, anise, and alcohol. Taste follows the nose, but weakly, and the alcohol close is harsh and fusel-involving. Mouthfeel is thin for the style, and drinkability is limited by above noted traits. Sorely disappointed."
"D - Very good. I'd seek out this bottle again. I'm really enjoying the style. It fits my mood very well."
"Very drinkable considering it's strength."
"I thought this beer was fantastic. If you enjoy any smoked porters, check it out"
"Fairly drinkable, others in the style I enjoy more."
"M: medium bodied, slightly rich with a mild carbonation rate. very drinkable, just some flavors through me off."
"Mild carbonation with a medium heft to the body. The alcohol is burried within the flavor and adds complexity to the brew. The actual mouthfeel is a tad watery and has a slightly chalky bite in the end. I've had a few bombers of this and definetely recommend giving it a try. It's very English-like, but that's not a wonder. I prefer Pugsley's Sig. BW a bit more than this one...both are nice offerings though."
"Interesting and drinkable. A tasty porter that is certainly worth a try."
"Overall not a bad stab at the style, the price seems a bit unreasonable and would stop me from buying a second time, but worth it as a one time shot."
"Pours from the 1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle and sampled on Feb. 23, 2009. The pour is a very dark brown and almost black with a foamy, tan head the remains on top for a few moments, Decent lacing. The aroma is of chocolate malts and of bitter hops. The mouthfeel is bold. The taste is bitter and hoppy and a little like smoked licorice. Actually a nice Porter."
"A solid brew that hits the porter bulls eye pretty well."
"Even mouthfeel, just a tad thin, somewhat tannic. Good beer, very drinkable."
"D- Overall, I'm not a huge fan of this beer, definitely not something I'd purchase again."
"Pours a two finger light tan head that leaves traces of lace. Almost black, faint mahogany highlights color. Roasted coffee nose. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Flavor is smooth, roasted coffee, slight burnt coffee finish. Pricey for Shipyard - $10.15 for a 22 oz bottle from Tullys Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Would like a little more kick, but overall a very good brew. I might not buy bottle again since its a twist top (-.5)"
"Drinkability: I could easily drink two bottles of this on a cold evening but not much more. Very nice blend of roast, coffee and alcohol make this a good winter beer."
"Drinkability: Though far from exceptional, it is reasonably enjoyable and decent, so long as you don't find the bumptious Ringwood objectionable."
"This beer was one of the first Potters I've had. I wasn't disapointed, a great even blend of flavors made this experience memorable."
"D- Very drinkable, but... This brew would be a decent Porter but for a Baltic the flavor is fairly bland and the body is light. I would expect something with a full body and flavor profile. This ain't it...."
"Pours a midnight black with a two finger tan colored head that dies down to a thin layer of foam. A decent amount of chunky lacing remains on the sides of the glass. Nose consists of smoked malts, roasted barley, and some good 'ol ringwood yeast. Smell also has some coffee notes and cocoa powder as well. Taste starts off with ashy bark, some brown sugar, and roasted coffee grinds. Ringwood emerges midway but isn't overly strong, thank god. Aftertaste is smokey and sweet with toasted grains, some molasses, spicy hops, metallic notes, and a touch of butter from the ringwood. The body is a bit thinner than I like for the style, with a dry feel and a medium to strong carbonation. This is a nice English Ale that is true to style. I've found that the Ringwood yeast strain is hit or miss for certain styles with Middle Ages being a stones throw from my apartment, but this is definitely one that works. The only problem I have with this beer is the price tag, bring it down a couple bucks and I'd be all over this bad boy again and again."
"6/3/4/3/8/2.4"
"Most everything is pretty pleasant here, although I would sure not mind a little easier finish."
"22oz bomber from the local Hannaford. Pours an opaque dark brown/black body with virtually no head to speak of. Toastiness and butter dominate the aroma. Toasty dark chocolate with a fair bit of butter as well. On the lighter side of medium in body with moderate to low carbonation. Okay beer, but I must admit I'm rather underwhelmed by it's simplistic taste and lackluster features. This beer could be cleaned up and dialed in for sure. Not what I look for from a Baltic porter or imperial porter."
"Wonderful! I savored every drop. Deep blackish pour with light beige head with brown drops on top and excellent retention & lace. Delicious cask draught with the typical but full chocolate-toffee-coffee aroma and a nice bitterness that followed not to sweet mouthy flavor. Smooth & rich with a hint of sourness behind the bitter. Definitely up there with Mayflower!"
"Pretty good beer. Probably wont go out to acquire more but I enjoyed the beer."
"Dried cocoa flavor. Quite thin for the style; closer to a brown ale in body. Nice blend of darker malts--like chocolate and dark crystal. Light hop noted in the finish. Easy to drink for an ""Imperial"" beer. There's no indication of any alcohol nor ""big"" flavors. Other than the title, this might be a pedestrian porter. Still, it's tasty and worthy of trying."
"Served in my snifter, the beer was a very dark brown, almost black, color with a thin tan, clingy head. Mild roasted malt aroma. Coffee, no espresso, came through more in the taste. I thought it tasted pretty good, but noted an unpleasant bitterness coming through at the end. Not a bad beer. I would buy it again, but not for the $10 I paid for this one."
"for more of my reviews, please check out my beer blog at joshsbeerblog.blogspot.com."
"Overall, not a bad porter. It just has that same buttery flavor that finds its way into all the Shipyard beers. If you're a big fan of their beers, then give this a try. But for the price ($8 for 22 oz) it's not really worth it."
"The aroma is pretty good for the style with toasted malt, coffee, and hops. The appearance is quite nice with a foamy tan head and dark brown color. The taste is very bitter and tastes burnt. I think it also tastes chemical. The palate is smooth but not thick. Overall I think this one is a major disappointment, it just doesn't taste good."
"Not a bad example of a baltic porter. The carbonation is a bit too high though. I would have preferred less carbonation in a bigger beer such as this."
"Beer pours a deep deep brown - held against the light you can see some ruby tinges to it. About a 1/2 inch head on the pour that fades very quickly with slight lacing. Aroma is slightly of roasted malts and definite coffee notes, slight dark chocolate. Taste is heavy on dark chocolate and coffee, slight bitter aftertaste. Medium body, very little carbonation. I enjoyed this beer, and I really wished I picked up a second bottle."
" This is a very good porter, perhaps a bit light for an Imperial but at 7.1% is very drinkable. Gotta love free samples!"
"D - the mouthfeel / finish made ita 1/4th beer for me."
