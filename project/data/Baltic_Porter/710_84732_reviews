"Not our favorite"
"Did not age well at all."
""
""
""
""
"O - Pretty good and I suspect this improves with age based on the reviews. I was given a bottle since I feel it is kinda pricey compared to other brewery offerings. If it is ever on sale it is worth picking up."
""
""
""
"O not sure how the age affected this... but it must have been for the better.. because there is NO WAY that the beer I just drank deserved a 3.69 (the current overall rating) probably coupled with the fact that leinenkugel  makes macro beer."

"Black in color and impenetrable to light.  A fingernail of khaki colored foam sits on top of the vast majority of this beer.  I smell plenty of dark malt and dry grains.  The taste is comprised of dark smoked malt.  The mouth is thick and yet viscous."
""
"Pours cloudy dark brown with quickly fading razor thin head. Aroma is of rich roasted caramel malt with some mild dark fruity notes. Taste is sweet dark mild roasted caramel malt, coffee bean, some dark fruity notes, dried figs and mild bitterness. Palate is medium body, slightly viscous mouth feel, moderate carbonation. Finishes with mild dark roasted caramel malt, mild dark fruity notes and a mild roasted malt and coffee bean, mild dark fruit on the backend. Overall, this quite a good and tasty Baltic Porter. I like."
"astringency.  Odd but decent."

"Tastes of sour fruits, dates, plums, pomegranate, licorice, very sour. Not sweet at all like one would expect from the style. Followed by toffee, caramel, and dark fruits. Finishes with almost a vinaigrette quality. Beautiful flavor profile. This is more like a sour wild ale than a Porter. Very fruity and very sour. Amazing beverage. Way underrated in my opinion."
""
"O- Too sweet for me. It's not horrible, but it's not anywhere close to what I've come to expect from classic baltic porters which have tended to have more roastiness and dark fruits. This is just sweet, cloying without even close to enough balance."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Way too sweet. Little overall complexity for the price. I will not purchase again. Sloppy job by the brewers."

"Overall: Overall a decent Baltic Porter. Average looking with a fruity, mellow nose. Tastes of very sweet dark fruits and mellow chocolate malts with a thinner than expected mouthfeel. Not anything to go out of your way for, but recommend for fans of the style. It held up better than expected in its two years."
"Overall a nice balanced porter, would be better with a little more body, a good drinkable beer."

"Sourcing: purchased at Spec's in Georgetown, Texas in January of 2014, priced at $10.49 plus tax for a 4-pack of twelve-ounce bottles."
""

""
""
"Overall - This beer is more prominently acidic and sour aka plumskins, with slight roast and smoke far in the background. This is a very flavorful beer, with nice balance and complexity. I would recommend sipping this one a bit more slowly, as the flavors open up nicely as it warms - alcohol is well hidden. A bit off for the style, but still enjoyable, and recommended."
""
"O- The nose on this beer kills it. It is by far one of the best Baltic Porters I've ever had. Kinda thin and the appearance is light, other than that, world class."

"O: Enjoyable beer, nice take on the style."

"Overall: Wow, is this really Leinenkugel? This is a pretty solid Baltic Porter, with some age on it. I would drink this again for sure. Only my second of the Big Eddy Series (after the Imperial IPA) but I think I need to try more. Worth a shot."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 9/5/2013. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, molasses, raisin, prune, nuttiness, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of dark malt notes with moderate fruitiness; and good strength. Taste of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, raisin, prune, light roast, nuttiness, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, dark fruit, nuttiness, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark/toasted malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Baltic porter. All around nice balance and complexity of dark/toasted malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Good Baltic porter, but nothing out of the ordinary for the style. Still, a good beer for a surprisingly cool summer evening."
""
""
""
"Starts off slow, but really gathers itself into a nice beer. The style doesn't always work for me and I had this pegged as a loser early on, but it really shines ones you take a sip."
""
"Strange...I am not sure what to think about this beer. The smell was amazing. It smelled like a rich, complex, fruity, malty stout. The taste had some of these same aspects but there was just something missing and I couldn't tell exactly what it was. The mouthfeel was a little thin as well. I usually give everything in the Big Eddy series a try since Leinenkugels being a state brewery but this one was missed out on something in trying to be a great beer."

"Overall –Not a bad Baltic overall. There are lots of port and dark fruit flavors swirling within this one, creating a rather fruity and sweet brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not the worst porter I ever had but not bad for some BMC wanna bee's. I would get it again if I found a 10 dollar six pack."
""
""
""
"An extra in a trade, I think Beerenberger."
"Creamy, full bodied. Somewhat rich and slick. Overall though, this is quite a bit off kilter for a Baltic Porter, which makes it hard to enjoy it as such."
""
""
"I can definitely say this is one of the better offerings from Leinenkugel, although I'm not completely sold, and certainly not at the going rate. There's still that ""something"" that's just missing. Not really standout-ish in any form, and so what are you really missing?"
"O - Honestly I like this. But, nothing is bursting through. Nose is underwhelming. Taste is pleasant but you keep hoping for more- specifically aged fruit- gotta bring that out more. Big Eddy are Leinenkugels' best brews but they seem to always fall just a step short of that 'excellent' level. this falls into another brew that is good, but I wouldn't brag about."
"This pours a dark brown color with a slight light brown head. The aroma gives it that scent like it’s been aged in a sherry barrel with a mild fruitiness of plums. The texture is smooth and creamy. There are lots of complex roasted and smoky flavors. Finishes ever so crisp. Not too bad but there’s also room for improvement."
""
"Overall - A heck of a lot more interesting than most Leinenkugel brews, but the taste is not quite right."

"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought it was an average at best example of a Baltic Porter, it just seemed much more like a Wee Heavy since it really didn't have any of those nice roasted flavors and aromas that I look for in the style. This beer had decent drinkability, it was fairly smooth and even though the flavors weren't true to style they still held my attention, but I think one would be enough for me, I don't feel the need to crack open another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was actually nice, it just wasn't true to style and it lacked the roasted aromas that I was looking for. What I liked the least about this beer was that it tasted much more like a wee heavy than a Baltic Porter, where did all the roasted malts go? I wouldn't buy this beer again, I would much rather have a Thirsty Trout Porter from Dark Horse, it's a little cheaper and it's much truer to style and tastier, I wouldn't recommend this as a good Baltic Porter. All in all i was let down with this beer, it didn't taste bad, but it wasn't what I expect from the style and it was really missing the roasted malts as a key component of this beer. So far I haven't been impressed with any of this beers from the Big Eddy series and this one is no different, I'm starting to lose hope with the series, but I hope the DIPA is better than the rest, better luck next time guys."
"O: Such a rich, chewy porter; a touch of an alcohol burn on the finish though it's pretty well masked; another nice offering from the Big Eddy series"

"O: Creamy, rich darkly sweet and an unusual departure from most of thier offerings (thankfully). Theres not much from Leinenkugel that impresses me, this is a good start along with thier RIS, unfortunately thats where things end as well (Up next is thier IPA so maybe three for three). A good but some may say overly sweet baltic porter but may be worthy a single purchase to give this brewery some redemption."
""
"This is a tasty little sucker that triumphs over a rather weak appearance and feel. The flavor balance is a tad out of whack, too, but not so much as to be unacceptable. I just would have liked a more robust malt character to bring about more balance and to tame some of the rough edges."

"Trying the Big Eddy porter following a surprise soirée for my Cuz's 40th. The Big Eddy is opaque in color with thin ecru head that is not lacing much. The scent carries peat/earthy tones with touches of coffee/espresso. The taste starts crisp and slightly bitter, them a healthy peat malt, semi sweet kicks in through the finish to make this a decent porter. The mouthfeel is medium in body with subtle carbonation. Overall it is a decent porter. If I were to change anything it would be to add a little more body and a touch more of caramel and roasts malt."
"Not a bad beer, but it wouldn't be a go to for myself."

"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/5 inch head of an off-tan color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hint of dark citrus, hint of yeast, and hint of pale malt. Fits the style of a Baltic Porter. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a hint of tartness. Tastes of oak, sweet malt, alcohol, slight roasted malt, hint of hop, and slight dark citrus. Overall, weak appearance, good aroma, and good body."
"	Overall Impression: this is a nice beer, I am very pleasantly surprised; very drinkable and really quite tasty; there is quite a bit packed in here, but it is balanced very nicely-it isn’t overwhelming, but isn’t boring; a nice drink that I will probably buy again, especially in the fall/winter as an alternative to the spice beers"
"Poured into a snifter. Pours a dark brown color, which does allow some light through. I small amount of cream colored head does arise, but dissapates quickly. It smells of molasses, raisins, and other dark fruits (figs/dates). Tastes like you are drinking a Fig Newton, with well hidden booze. It is enjoyable & quite smooth: drinks more like a Belgian strong dark ale. Tastes somewhat similar to Chimay Blue, from my recollection."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tumbler, dark pour with a slight tan head, decent lacing. Lots of coffee on the nose, very malty. Nice mix of coffee, port and dark fruits, lingering finish. The carbonation is medium, no detectable booze, dangerously drinkable. I really enjoyed this, good flavor and great drinkability."

"MF- Nice full body, especially when this warms up. Not too much carbonation, but just right."

"A decent Baltic Porter, worth a shot, but don't set your sights too high"

"D - a hearty drink for a hearty meal. This needs to be paired with something a bit greasy."
""
"A decent example of the style. Not as smooth or clean as Okocim, Sinebrychoff, Carnegie or Zwyiec, but still pretty tasty. I would buy it again, but at this price, why not just get an Okocim."

"overall - not quite as good as the Big Eddy RIS."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a white head. The aroma is full of alcohol and some dark fruit notes. I also get a little bit of brown sugar. The flavor is similar. I get a lot of raisin and prune notes, as well as some molasses and roasted malt. I also get the slightest hint of smoke. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
"Overall: An interesting and decent tasting take on a Baltic Porter. Dark fruit flavors are good. Could of had some more body and smoke."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Big Eddy Baltic Porter does all that Baltic porters prescribe, but the smoothness is met with the abrasioin of light char, the alcohols are slightly less refined, and the middle palate leaves holes in the flavors and textures that are expected. It's a good beer, but the Baltic Porter taste is so specific that this beer has difficult achieving."
""
""
"Overall: Well, let's just say I preferred the other members of the Big Eddy crew. By margin wide enough to chuck some dirty nickles and a bottle of Kikkoman's through."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good for a Baltic Porter. Not up there with the best, but not a bad attempt, either."
""
""
""
"O - sweeter than I'd expect for the style, but another good offering from the Big Eddy series"
"This is actually pretty good. If this was in a blind taste test I think this would get better reviews. Very robust flavors with a balanced bitter roast. It's a tad sweet but it's a big beer with tons of sticky flavor."
""
""
""
"O - This is beer is pretty nice. None of the flavors are in your face, like many imperial porter/stouts. It has a simple aroma and flavor profile and it is easy drinking. I wouldn't trade it in for some of my favorite big stouts, but I think it represents the Baltic Porter style nicely. Pretty cheap (I think, I paid around $2 for the single) and definitely worth a try if you are a porter purist."
"O - Not a bad example of a baltic porter but i've had a lot better examples. I think maybe it's just a tad too sweet for me overall. Not sure i would seek this out again."
""
"This beer pours a medium bodied dark cola brown that gets darker as it pool, minimal head and light carbonation. The nose is malty and sweet with little to no roast. It sure doesn't smell like a Baltic. The flavors too, light for a Baltic with too much of a cola flavoring and no roast. It has some scotch ale attributes to it, also odd. It is also too light in body for the style. Overall this is a pretty bad representation of the style. It really is more like a Wee Heavy than a Baltic Porter. It just needs to be bigger and have more to it."
""
"This was a bit disappointing. The flavor was a bit weird to me. The caramel was more prevalent than I would have expected. It seemed at odds with the huge roasted malt presence. In any case, this is probably worth a try."
"Big Eddy Baltic Porter pours a black color with a nice sized tan head. There wasnt a strong aroma, but their were hints of coffee. The taste had a nice bold coffee flavor, all on a smokey malty backbone. A bit watery, but not of surprise from Leinenkugel. Overall this was an enjoyable beer, a little watery, but full of nice flavors."
"I haven’t had that many Baltic porters, but I’ve tended to like all that I’ve tried—Big Eddy’s included. I wouldn’t put up against my favorite RIS’s, but it’s still a good beer worth seeking out and trying. I’ll age one for a year just to see where it goes."

"O - Such an Excellent beer. Big Eddy series is turning my head! I really have enjoyed these beers by Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co!!!"
"This was delicious. It actually didn't quite live up to my expectations, because my expectations for the Big Eddy series are now quite high. I actually expect a bit more booze and bite in this style, but I have to say this is a delicious beer, one I could drink all night if it weren't for the ABV."
""
"O - Another malt-driven concoction completes the series of seasonal Big Eddy beers and really shows that there's serious brewing skill there; they're not just amateurs pumping out shandy. Leinenkugel's Big Eddy Baltic Porter almost perfectly nails the style with it's malt complexity showcased. Despite being a clean lager (which makes it dangerously drinkable for the alcohol percent) it's got ale depth and character. Don't pass this one up."
""
""
"This certainly wasn't bad but it's not quite up to the level of the others I've had from the Big Eddy series. Hopefully the other 3 I have will develop more character over time. "
