4,-2.9,4,4,4,4,4,"500 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle date. Clear dark brown color with a dense 1 finger light tan head with nice retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap. A nice amount of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big dark fruits, roasted malt, caramel, molasses, chocolate, coffee, wood, and a bit of booze. Nice aromas here with good strength and complexity. Taste of nice chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, and dark fruits; with a bit of wood and smokiness as well. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish that lingers with some caramel, and chocolate flavors with a bit of hop spiciness. Very malt forward, but also has a nice balance of all flavors. Medium bodied with a slightly higher than medium amount of carbonation. The carbonation does not really detract anything, and the beer still has a fair amount of creaminess in the mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden, only a small warming after the finish. Very good drinkability for 8.3% as well, nice and smooth. Overall this is a great Baltic porter, with a lot of complexity and nice balance.","superspak","Aug 19, 2011"

There is a slight chicory flavor, lots of sweet chocolate and brown malts, a roasted malt note underneath, some charred flavors, some cocoa powder flavors too. This is a surprisingly sweet, yet complex porter, that is a pure sweet delight. It is strong, but deceptively so, with no real indication of its strength, beware. The charred and more drying hop characteristics, what there is of them, comes through more in the finish. There is definitely an oily finish on the tongue, but very little aftertaste and just maybe the slightest ABV warming notes in the finish. This beer is a treat. L'Chaim.","albern","Dec 05, 2009"

Rich dark chocolate and a perfume of alcohol are also there. Taste is pretty amazing, with much of the same, plus cola and a nice caramel flavor that is mildly reminiscent of a Doppelbock. Body is heavy, hoppy, and bursting at the seams with complexity. Drinking Okocim Porter should be a process of sipping and savoring, so that all of those interesting traits come to the forefront.

A gem from mother Poland, very smooth and a beer that easily masks its rather high ABV (8.3% according to its label).

I smell a sweet molasses-like aroma combined with an almost smokey roasted malt smell. Perhaps I detect chocolate as well. I could be fooling myself but I could swear I smell the alcohol content. Tastes like a very good porter. Semi sweet and warm from the 8.3% alcohol. Slight bitter aftertaste. Hint of smokey roasted malty overtones. Very smooth and heavy with little carbonation like a good porter usually is. The high alcohol content and heavyness makes this beer a two-beer-a-night kind of beer.

Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I crave, but still quite respectable. All in all a very nice Baltic Porter.

Body is completely opaque black and shiny. Smell is complex and well shaped by bottle conditioning. The aroma of fruit mingles and is eventually over taken by beautifully showcased roasted barley and thus displays a great nuttiness, dry roast coffee and hints of chocolate. Hops are subtle in the aroma if even present at all. Taste is very quaffable with subtle bitterness coming to ward the finish and a slight sweetness through and through. There is a great deal of complexity to the taste both dark fruit and roasted malts are present with a very pleasant touch of acidity toward the finish. Great subtly and flavor in this.

This isn't the most complex beer I've ever had, but it's very nice, almost like a glass of dessert that's not so sweet you'll hurt your teeth.

As I'm not a fan of the raisin smell in beers, it took a hit in the rating. The taste was pretty good but again dominated by the raisin taste so hard to enjoy. This is my first Baltic Porter so I'm hoping this isn't standard for the style as I've really gotten into American and English Porters this year.

On the finish, medicinal note finally gives way to a good roast quality with lingering hop bitterness. The 8.3% alc by volume listed on the label is very evident, contributing, I'm sure to the barleywine-like characterics of this beer. On a winter's night a good quaff but not to be considered sessionable by any stretch. It has a more roast finish, I find, than other Baltic porters I've tried (Utenos, Liviske). Complex flavor profile indeed; would be on my winter drinking list.","alehopman","Apr 11, 2007"

3.8,-7.8,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The Okocim Porter pours impenetrably black with a thin tan head. As you reach the bottom of your glass, it reveals a much less ominous reddish brown hue. The smell is mostly that of roasted malt, coffee, cocoa and a hint of sweetness. It has moderate carbonation and is medium bodied, but the mouth feel was thinner than I expected. The taste is mildly sweet roasted malt that is offset by alcohol and some hop bitterness that reminds me of dark rum based deserts. There is noticeable heat on the semi-dry finish. Overall, I found this to be an intoxicating, but not exceptional, example of a Baltic porter. Maybe I was expecting too much, given some of the stellar reviews from other BAs. I just wasnt bowled over by this beer. Its certainly a good Baltic porter; I just dont think its anything more than that. I'll take a D.

Gas a nice medium colored tan head that has pretty good legs and left a good amount of lacing down the side of the glass. Over all this is a very good looking brew. The aroma was noticeable right from the poor, with a strong scent of alcohol mixed with licorice and coffee. As I took a deeper smell I also notice chocolate, dark fruits and maybe a sherry scent? Very complex smelling brew, which is nice on a cold snowy night. The taste is also very nice with a sweet flavor that seems to dominate with brown sugar, licorice, malts, dark fruits and butterscotch then breaks to a roasted flavor, which is somewhat surprising as I figured that it would be more of a burn flavor. Over all this is a great brew but for some reason I was expecting more but it is hard to specify what that more is. I guess after hearing about this brew for a number of years and then actually being able to give it a try, it did not live up to all the hype.

There was a decent black malt backbone to it, but chocolate dominates the taste. The mouthfeel had a pleasant light carbonation that went very well with the chocolate taste.

The malt dominates the flavor almost till the end, when that surprise of aroma comes foward. A dried fruit flavor lingers on the palate after each taste. A rich mouthfeel, it coats the palate nicely, till the burning sensation of alchol hits the throat. Still, this fairly easy to drink beer, very surprising in taste and aroma, for a porter.

A very rich, initial taste is followed by a nice sweetness--mostly chocolate--and coffeelike presence. Bold and flavorful. In the mouth Okocim Porter is full, carbonated and biting. As it warms the presence of alcohol is notable, but not overwhelming. Overall, this is a very good porter. More bitter than most, but quite tasty and impressive.

Taste is true to style, and is german dopple/schwarz like; sweet caramel flavor mostly, with a distinct roasted malt note that is delayed and swells on the palate into the finish when the sweetness fades. Alcohol is there but not flashy. Hops are minimal in taste. Too sweet in the dopplebock way for me to really enjoy. Mouthfeel is full and creamy on the tounge, but on the medium-high side as for carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer, but for me, why bother, with other more flavorful options and styles, particularly less boozy ones? This is tame in taste, though good (that little roasted note saves it from being booring). Drinking this made me wonder if it is more highly rated due to it being fairly tame and for how well it hides it's dizzying alcohol content. This is just not for me.","Liquids","Jul 25, 2006"

Roasted and vinous aromas dominate the nose with english hops, soy sauce and chocolate malt in the background. Articial sweetener flavor upfront is probably the only flaw. Rich with malt flavor like crystal sweetness, roasted notes, faint coffee, and suspect stale dark malts. Drying herbal hop aftertaste balances the flavor very well and lifts some of the residual sweetness to form a marvelous execution of the style. Medium in body and a mid-level carbonation allow a creamy mouthfeel with ample crispness. Finishes sweet, but not cloying with a touch of dry fuggle hops and a trace of alcohol. Very drinkable considering the alcoholic strength and robust malt profile.","PBRstreetgang","Jul 19, 2006"

Smell is quite intense with roasted malt, fig, and licorice well blended. Taste follows up the smell accurately. Moderately sweet with an unusual bitterness. I am used to American porters that can have a coffee or chocolate taste. This is quite different and pleasant. Licorice seems to be dominant, but there are some other floral and herbal notes. Mouthfeel is very full and creamy. This is a very pleasant porter, and a real value too. I am able to get these for less than $2, seems a bit of a steal. I will definately be getting this again.

4.12,0,4,4.5,4,4,4,"500 mL bottle, 8.3 % abv. Pours a deep mahogany color, with russet highlights and a dense beige head. Nose is an over-the-top vinous affair with dark fruits like plums, Bing cherries, and prunes reconstituted with Port. A roasted chocolate aroma is detectable as well. Big flavors of cherries and plums with a mineral twinge at the finish. Sweet dark fruits linger in the aftertaste. Molasses and currants. Some roasted malt bitterness provides a subtle bulwark against over-sweetness. Aside from the mouthfeel, which is certainly full for a porter but overall closer to medium-bodied and quite smooth with some very slight alcohol warming, Okocim Porter reminds me quite a lot of a Russian Imperial Stout (although I like my stouts to lean more toward the roasty side of things rather than darkly sweet). Not sure when this one was brewed/bottled, but I believe I prefer Baltic Porters with a bit of age on them.

Creamy flavors (vanilla?) mix with cocoa in the middle. There was a slight metallic flavor at first, but after a few sips it's gone.

It might be just a tad too sweet to be perfect, but its still a great flavor. I recommend it...","bennetj17","Mar 01, 2006"

The butterscotchy sweet taste was a little overwhleming, but there were moments where I got chocolate liquor. There was little bitterness, and the last taste I detected was the alcohol. The beer had a nice body to it -- creamy velvet in the mouth. Because of the sweetness, I'm having a tough time finishing this 500 mL. I like sweet beers, but this one is unbalanced in some way.

This beer doesnt give any hint of 8%. The sweetness in the flavor gives plenty of body, but the density of the flavor goes beyond that with a nice lingering roasted chocolate flavor.

The beer is quite sweet up front with a burnt roasted note throughout as well. The roast flavors dont quite balance the initial sweetness though. In some ways it tastes like an over-sweetened cup of espresso, lots of sugar and bitter burnt flavors. It is still tasty, just not as well balanced as I would hope.

I'll give it plenty of credit for being very complex and interesting, but the taste was just not to my liking. It tastes like an imperial stout mixed with a porter mixed with rum(?). The alcohol is present in the taste and has a lot of roastedness in the taste.","clvand0","Oct 01, 2003"
4.37,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured from a stout-looking 16.9 oz bottle with a goat on the label, it pours a deep, dark brown that shows a little garnet when held up to the light. The smell is just amazing, with notes of chocolate, coffee, ripe fruit, molasses, and traces of caramel. A torrent of flavors are also present. In addition to those found in the smell, the taste tingles the tongue with just a slight medicinal taste that only makes the whole thing more enjoyable. It's belly-warming, but the alcohol is well hidden The mouthfeel is creamy and almost encourages use of a spoon. It's no session beer, but it's very drinkable for the style and abv. It doesn't quite match Carnegie Stark Porter, but it's not far off.","mickeymac","Sep 17, 2003"
4.32,4.9,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Well, I was lucky to find a couple of these (I only had two, I'll wait for a special occasion to drink the last one). Pretty much lived up to the expectation. Kind of an "Imperial Porter". Strong, full-bodied. Extremely well balanced. Some bitterness to go with the chocolate flavors. Really a stout, IMO. Fits right in with the better stouts, porters, and doppels. Excellent all around beer. Hides the alcohol very well. Ordinary appearance, and maybe just a tad on the bitter side. If I could get it regularly, I certainly would. Why D/C such an excellent beer? (the best baltic beer I've ever had).","JohnnyDuvel","Aug 27, 2003"
4.63,12.4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Notes: Sharing is for the weak. If you find this beer, take it from Mustard: horde it like the greedy pig that you are. The best porter I have ever had, by far.","Mustard","Aug 18, 2003"

4.82,17,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours black ruby in color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that sticks to the sides of the glass as it recedes. Nose is very reminiscent of Kahlua and crème de cacao. This is a full-bodied brew and is oh so very smooth and creamy in the mouth. Taste is rich dark malts, lots of chocolate syrup, and dark fruits followed by some notes of chocolate coffee liqueur and noticeable warming alcohol. An excellent choice for a nightcap, and once this gets 30 reviews, its sure to make the Top 50 List. Purchased from Liquid Solutions.","Morris729","Apr 11, 2003"

4.73,14.8,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Well well, what do we have here? Answer: another exceptional Baltic/Imperial style porter. Incredible depth of aroma and flavor. The black and chocolate malt, ripe dark fruit - plum, prune, raisin must be slowly savoured. Rich, full bodied. Semi-sweet with the strength of 8+% abv to balance things out. Sit back, relax, look, smell, taste...repeat. Outstanding.","John","Nov 29, 2002"
4.4,6.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"The tan dense head settles into a thin uniform layer that leaves sparse lace.  Deep ruby hue when held to light exhibiting excellent clarity.  Assertive caramelized sugar, deeply roasted malt, dark toffee in aroma w/ a candied fruitiness emerging at the end. As the beer warms, a touch of heaty fusel alcohols add additional complexity.  The flavor is dominated by tremendously smooth and rich dark coffee and chocolate-- there isn't the slightest hint of astringency to be found. The date - like malt sweetness overpowers the understated hop bitterness and is thus quite high, but isn't cloying. Full bodied but not overly rich. The finish is sweet, lightly roasty and a touch fruity.  This is one tremendously flavorful brew-- the myriad of flavors hide the high relative alcohol content.  Delicious.","marc77","Jun 23, 2002"

4.9,18.9,5,5,5,5,4.5,"An absolute classic. I've been intrigued by the Baltic porter category for some time, and am truly glad I am getting the chance to finally try one. It's hard to rate this beer against other Baltic porters (since this is the first I've tried), but that hardly matters; this is a terrific beer regardless of category. Almost pitch black, though if you look closely through the light a beautiful ruby glint will come through. Huge rocky dark tan head that reduces, but doesn't quite disappear. It's got aromas somewhere between an imperial stout and a sweet barleywine (not like Bigfoot, more like Victory's Old Horizontal; then imagine it combined with Storm King). Tastes of slightly burnt raisins and prunes, with a bit of licorice and (maybe?) a touch of chocolately sweetness. Nice alcohol burn in the finish; not too strong, but definitely there. Whoa baby, this is a treat, and I like it.","mophie","May 10, 2002"
4.64,12.6,4,5,5,4,4,"My first and definately not last Baltic Porter.  Drinks much like an imperial stout, as it should.  Great nightcap beer.","pbrian","Nov 20, 2001"
3.76,-8.7,4,3,4,4,4,"I had earlier rated this beer pretty as being pretty poor, but wondered if I had gotten a bad bottle, given other BeerAdvocate's favorable opinions.  Consequently, I decided to give it another chance.  Glad I did, and I do believe there must have been a problem with the last bottle, which I described as tasting like Sam Adams Tripple Bock gone bad.  On second try, this beer has a very nice burned prune character and a solid alcohol punch.  Lots of depth of flavor.","Brent","Nov 15, 2001"
4.16,1,4,3,5,4,4,"Brent from Kentucky is dead wrong. He must have gotten a bad bottle or he is not familiar with the Baltic Porter style. These porters are strong (Okicim being at 8.1%) with an aggressive (sometimes sweet) roasted malt profile. Okicim is a fine example of the style not as sweet as Dojidily (sp) and not as aggressive on the roastyness as say Sinebrychoff. If you like a nice aggressive porter definitely give Okocim","mattmaples","Sep 12, 2001"
