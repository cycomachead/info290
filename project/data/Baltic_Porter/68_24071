4.27,6.2,5,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. The beer is a dark deep coffee brown hue with a dark and dense, creamy-foamy brown head that retains and laces quite well. The aroma is initially a bright, sweet cherry note with a wood character and a background note of caramel that strengthens later. The taste is a balanced medium high bittersweet. It’s thick and syrupy, with a touch of stickiness and a creamy thick head. The medium-full body has lots of chocolate and coffee notes. There’s some jolly rancher sugary fruits tucked away in there too that come through more at the finish which is primarily caramel syrup in flavor and texture that brings with it a subtle tabacco note that lingers mildly in the waxy, dry coffee aftertaste - kinda like smoking a mellow cigar.","ARoman","Monday at 05:12 PM"

I was a little disappointed by the smell (or lack thereof) but  the taste more than makes up for it.  Very malty but with a nice combination of coffee, chocolate, caramel, and molasses.  It's a little sweeter than other baltic porters I've had.  It has a very nice mouth feel.  Overall, an excellent porter, which I will enjoy again.","MacMalt","Feb 16, 2015"

4,-0.5,,,,,,"Poured a deep brown with reddish highlights around the edges.  A mile high head with some rather large bubbles interspersed in the tan foam.  This left a pronounced lacing on the glass and thin islan of the tan foam remained for the duration.  The smell is darkly roasted malt, bitter chocolate and prominent alcohol.  I had this at just under room temprature and it tasted aggresively bitter, but in a good way.  Alchohol hits pretty hard, not really hidden at all.  The rosty taste of this reminds me of a good stout, but the mouthfeel is thinner and quite effervescent.  This one is good, but lacking in subtlety.","SFNC","Dec 11, 2014"

For something the looked like vanilla extract, this had a lot going on since the vanilla was only a small aspect of what was found here. As so many have alluded to on here, this is by far Flying Dog's best beer! Most of their other offerings tasted similar to each other but like the Smuttynose Robust Porter, this one's a standout that's not to be missed. Part Porter, Part Stout, Part Scotch Ale, this was a beer that's unlike anything else on the shelf and deserves to be a winter staple in anyone's stash.","JerzDevl2000","Dec 06, 2014"

It definitely has a boozy taste to it, it is not trying to hide the alcohol content, that is for sure. it leaves a good taste in my mouth afterwards and is not too tough to drink. A couple of these will set you straight without any trouble. THis would be a good beer to eat while grilling burgers.","sanzenapocalypz","Jul 08, 2014"

That combined with the dry finish make this a nice slow relaxing brew. The Alcohol is a bit more forward as the beer warms (it takes over for the chocolate taste).

The nose is quite hoppy and not terribly roasty. The roasted malt flavor is present upfront, but the hop qualities of this offering stand out above the malt profile. This is more of a black ale than a Baltic porter. For example, the body is far too thin for a Baltic, but right on-point for a solid black ale.","57md","Jan 07, 2014"

Thompson quotes and Steadman art on the bottle (so much that I'll be keeping it around). With such a high ABV I can't see drinking more than 1-2 at a time, but it is a nice switch from the sweeter more chocolatey porters I'm used to. It may not be for everyone, but I'd recommend giving it a try. Also, there is quite a difference in aroma and flavor after letting the beer warm for a few moments, much smoother and less sharp alcohol flavors.","Crafts_and_recreation","Dec 25, 2013"

Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, slight coffee, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with a cookie dough flavor on the finish. There is a medium roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat and medium bodied mouthfeel.

Pours pitch black color with a nice 2 finger dense dark tan head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice thick soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, light char, herbal, caramel, toast, toffee, earth, light dark fruit, and light coffee. Nice aromas with good complexity and balance. Taste of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, toast, char, earth, herbal spiciness, and light dark fruits. Fair amount of coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, toffee, earth, light fruitiness, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice flavor balance and complexity; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good imperial porter. Good flavor balance and robustness; very smooth to sip on. I was expecting more out of this, but this was still quite tasty.","superspak","Nov 19, 2012"

Lots and lots of vanilla coming through here. Light malts as well. Tastes somewhat like a medium-dark coffee. Black coffee beans, vanilla extract, And small amounts of malt. For this beer being 9.2% I cannot believe that it actually tastes this good. The mouthfeel allows the alcoholic side of this brew to come out. Retains all flavors except for the vanilla, sadly.

The head is a creamy and thick French beige colored mass which persist as long as your beer does. The smell of this beer is one of rich roasted malt and chocolate. Similarly the taste is an mighty combination of primarily malt and chocolate with slight dark fruits and acidity playing the side kicks. Unfortunately about seventy five percent through this experience an acrid and harsh flavor comes through. This beer feels amazing in your mouth because it seems to float on your tongue.

The head is very low profile, sitting about a half an inch, and it is a dark beige coloring, solid and dense. Aromas are rich, with a creamy backbone and a coffee bitterness. A touch of booze in the nose as well. Flavors are rich, also, with a dark fruit sweetness on the initial taste, followed by some roasted coffee bitterness and a smokey overtone. Flavors are very well blended, and the booze characteristics make their presence felt on the transition between the flavor and the aftertaste. The aftertaste continues with a nutty and dark roasted sweetness. The finish has a decent linger, but not overpowering. Good beer.","GarthDanielson","Jan 14, 2012"

4.13,2.7,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"2008 Vintage Gonzo Imperial Porter from Flying Dog Brewery rings in at a hearty 7.8% ABV. This beer pours an inky black, with a wisp of light brown head that features a quickly dissipating lace. A sweet malty aroma fills the nose while hints of chocolate, coffee, licorice, and alcohol tease the senses. A seemingly silky medium mouthfeel are complemented nicely with a medium to high amount of carbonation.Dark roasted chocolaty tones are well established out front, with roasted malt and earthy hop flavors leading into a warming alcohol finish. Simply delicious.","phishsihq","Jan 01, 2012"

The aroma is extremely malty, almost like a dopplebock. The same with the taste, only difference seems to be a bit more burnt in character. Fine beer.

There are about three fingers of tan head, and retention is very good. There's a solid ring of lace that marks the high point of the beer, but everything underneath is a bit more spotty. The nose is fairly weak, but I do pick out a little bit of coffee as well as some roasted grain. The flavor's got some more life to it, but not too much. There's a bit of milk chocolate that creeps in, especially as the beer warms, and plays off the coffee well. That roasty quality is also still there, and while it's definitely not as prominent as the chocolate or coffee, I still wish it was dialed back a little bit more. The mouthfeel is nothing special either. The body is a touch thin, and the carbonation a bit too bubbly. If not for a certain silkiness that's also appreciable, it would be entirely a lost cause. I have to say, I've heard plenty of good things about Flying Dog's Gonzo, but to me it was just OK","axeman9182","Nov 26, 2011"

3.83,-4.7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I shared this beer with the wife, pouring it into a pint glass. Blackish-brown color with a well-retaining tan head. Aroma of dark roasted malts, coffee, and strangely, quite a pronounced hop profile. Taste was not what I expected. The wife took the first sip and recoiled a bit, claiming it seemed more like a Cascadian dark ale (aka black IPA, as she put it, but it's a term I hate to use). In a bit of disbelief, I took a sip, bearing the aroma in mind. Definitely a piney hop kick right off the bat, with notes of rum raisin, but mid-to-end-palate, the hoppiness mellowed, leaving space for the cocoa-coffee duet to enter. Finished dry and roasty, and not that bad at all. Medium body. Not quite what I expected, but still good.","Rifugium","Nov 02, 2011"

Flavor has a sour-ish dimension, too. Mostly I get slightly burnt coffee, caramelized fruit, pine resins, and cocoa. All in all good, but did not meet my expectations, mostly due to the lingering burnt/sour flavors on the aftertaste. Alcohol is warming, but not overdone. Mouthfeel smooth but unremarkable.

In any case a might fine beer and the first Flying Dog beer I've had which I've actually loved and not just liked.","DavidST","Aug 19, 2011"

This beer tastes better when it is warned a bit at room temperature rather than drinking it cold. I drank this while eating a piece of dark triple layer chocolate cake, and what a great match!

Smell is very bright, creamy roasted malt, some dark chocolate and vanilla undertones. On the palate, there's a punch of smoked and roasted malt up front, dark chocolate folded in there, finishing dry with a moderate acidity/sourness on the back of the tongue. There's an almost harsh, off flavor at the end. Mouthfeel is pretty good, although the carbonation (medium) is a bit higher than would be ideal. Medium-full body.

All in all I liked it, but was hoping the hops would be a little more subdued and subtle while the malt starred, and I felt that eventhough the malt flavor on this is great, the hops that didn't compliment it as much as subtracted from it.","Wreckoncile","Aug 08, 2011"

4.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I have enjoyed this beer for a long time now, but never sat down to review it until now. Pours motor oil black with a viscousness that hints to the amount of body and alcohol it has. A nice three finger tan head that stuck around for a little while, then left a bit of lacing and a thin film of froth on the top. Aromas are cocoa, roasted malt and a bit of fruitiness underneath it all. Coffee on the palate, bit of rasiny fruit and a nice bitter punch to back up all of the sweetness. The bitterness seems to come not just from hops, but the darkly roasted malt too. Alcohol is apparent, but not in an unpleasant way. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy and pleasant. As I said I like this beer a lot, and seeing as how this one was the last one at my local store and Flying Dog is pulling out of Arizona for the time being, it might be the last one I have for a while. One of my favorite (albeit, potent) pairings is this beer with a glass of neat Bourbon or Irish Whisky on the side.","BeerAmbassador","Jul 08, 2011"

4.23,5.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good Baltic Porter and I really enjoyed drinking it. I don't have much experience with this style with only ever having two other Baltic Porters, that being Shipwreck Porter and the Barrel Aged version from Arcadia. This beer can hold its own against the Shipwreck Porter but i think I would take Shipwreck Porter over gonzo, its just a little more fuller and flavorful, but with Gonzo being priced better and much more available to me I could see this being my go to Baltic Porter. I thought this beer went down super smooth for 9.2% beer and it's drinkability was one of my favorite things about this beer, my least favorite was the lighter then usual body. I will for sure be buying this again and I recommend it to anyone who likes roasty and robust beers. This beer is right up their with Horn Dog as my favorite beers from flying dog, I find the majority of their regular line up to be pretty lack luster but all the beers I have had from the Canis Major series have all been good and impressive, nice work Flying Dog.","StoutHunter","Jun 24, 2011"

Taste is a good deal boozier than the aroma. Roasted malts, burnt coffee and dark chocolate flavors. Chocolate aftertaste. Medium bodied and nicely carbonated. Think this bottle was from 2010 but the label was hard to read and faded. Overall, its a decent Porter that drinks fairly well all things considered.

The floral from any hops just won't escape me, I love it. Almost like a CDA (Cascadian Dark Ale). Taste is totally different than I would have thought, taking into account the smell.

Taste is round, heavy on the roasted malt (lots of chocolate flavor), with some hops to back it up, but not a ton of complexity to the flavor.

Maybe it was the romance of the place, or the fact that I was pretty high, but I was fucking in love with this beer. Now, over a year later, I am underwhelmed. It's interesting and big (not huge), but lacks complexity and nuance. This porter was brewed in honor of Hunter S. Thompson, the best-known champion of Gonzo journalism, which was a type of writing in which the authors immersed themselves in whatever their subjects were so that they could write from an experiential point of view. It was all about putting your ass on the line and your guts into the writing, and I think that if the fellows at Flying Dog want to truly honor Mr. Thompson, they should go stir up their guts by picking a fight with the Hell's Angels, partake in a protest in the Pacific Northwest, and experiment heavily with several psychoactive drugs. That way, when they drag their broken heads and bodies back into the ol' brewery think-tank, they'll have some heady fodder to ferment into something worthy of the late great Hunter S.","bwan15","Dec 03, 2010"

Honestly, as stated in the taste section, the more this beer warms up the more enhanced the flavors become, and the better the beer drinks.

The body is black and has about a finger's worth of bubbly mocha colored head that has good retention and leaves behind spotty lacing. The smell is bakers chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts and somehow in my nose I get a touch of tartness. I'd like the smell a lot more if it weren't for the tartness. The taste follows the smell pretty well. Bakers chocolate, roasted malts and a big coffee finish with a slight bit of tart. It's pretty nice but the tartness seems really out of place. Do I have a not great bottle? The mouthfeel is a bit sticky but on a full bodied beer like this I'm not too put off. Overall this is pretty nice.

Smells like dark roasted coffee, chocolate, notice a bit of alcohol in the smell and taste also. At 85 IBU's I find the bitterness to be noticeably more than a normal porter, but still not too much, nicely balanced with the sweet malty taste. I did notice a ""smoky"" taste to it, but didn't think it was overpowering. Very dark appearance, opaque black. Lacing left on glass from the head, seems to have a medium level of carbonation. Has a medium-thick mouthfeel, very nice. Goes down smooth and easy, but at 7.8% abv I'd be tipsy after maybe two or three. Maybe would be a good sipping beer for me, but I'm sure others could quaff a couple pints of this and be fine.

The nose is dominated by roasted malts, with some chocolate and maple syrup picking up whatever slack is left them. The taste reprises this roast domination, with the additional additions of dark chocolate and coffee, bringing in some nice bitterness. The body is a heavy medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat thick feel. Overall, a very nice Baltic, not quite as strong as the BA version but very tasty nonetheless.","TMoney2591","Oct 08, 2010"

Combined the aromas seem akin to being a bit off some sort of iron combination out of all of it. The taste is slightly odd. I'm not really sure but it would seem to me like there is more smoke than malt and it leaves a leather taste in my mouth. That is one of the most interesting beer flavors I've ever had. It doesn't sit all that well in my mouth but it isn't bad. The drinkability is not great, but I've had worse. I can see how the overabundance of smoke can help it. Interesting brew.","Vdubb86","Oct 07, 2010"

The beer is almost motor oil black with a frothy brown head like on hot chocolate. The smell is mostly of rich toasted malt, without the deep chocolate and coffee aromas that I was expecting. The beer tasted roasty though, with a bitter chocolate and licorice flavor that slowly dissipated allowing the caramel sweetness to come through. Bitterness was minimal but enough for balance and alcohol was well hidden. The beer was silky and coated the mouth well, and a luxury on its way down the throat.","Soonami","Oct 03, 2010"

Thompson may be the greatest American of all time - and I approve of this beer as a fine representation of the man. Final quick note - the bottle claims an ABV of 7.8% although BA lists it as 9.2%.

Chocolate malts are very present, but that citrus is still slightly prevalent as well, and despite the high ABV it feels very smooth and full bodied.

Big chocolate tastes come through to start, really big and beefy in places. Bitter burnt coffee bean finishes up the taste.

I'm having a second thought half-way through tasting now, that in a sense the flavour profile is much milder and lighter than an IRS, and perhaps it means to be a cross between Baltic Porter and IRS, for its balanced profile b/w bitterness, fruitiness, and sweetness overall? I'll never know.

Fully black and opaque, no brown coloration to the liquid at all. Extremely sweet nose, drips with caramel, toffee, butterscotch, coffee ice cream, hot chocolate, banana pudding, plum and black grape fruit, you name it, its got it. The nose does develop some green hoppy bite but this is an after effect once the sweetness has congealed a bit. It's full-bodied in the mouth, however, sheds a noticeable amount of weight before it finishes. The carbonation helps break up some of the density in the chocolate, coffee, caramel flavors and here you get more of a roasted edge than in the nose. More scone, baked sweets aspect too while the plum, cherry, grape fruit recedes slightly. Here too the hops surge at the end and lend both bitterness and tingle.

Second, there is not much complexity or power to be found here. Flavors are quite subtle and it lacks the depth and complexity that an Imperial Porter should have. The mouthfeel ends up being too heavy and cloying from all of the sweets, and it leaves a really weird diet soda-like aftertaste. Not sure if I got a bad bottle or what, but this wasn't anything close to what I was expecting out of an Imperial Porter.","sweetbrew82","Jul 18, 2009"

Taste is similar to aroma; chocolate (sweet and bitter), floral hop, a touch of burnt roastiness and bread. Quite chocolatey aftertaste. Mouth is full bodied with a slight acrid feeling in the after-sip from the hop bitterness. Carbonation is quite present. Drinks fairly well.

A little coating, almost but not quite medicinal, certainly leaves its impression on the palate. Not real watery, but not a great mouthfeel impression either. Drinkability is much higher than antiicpated - not overly bitter or alcoholic at all. A nice surprising way to end a night.

The head was about a half inch thick, almost as smooth as chocolate frosting. The color was jet black, allowing no light to breach its darkness. The aroma was full of dark roasted malts and sweet dark fruits. The taste wasn't as strong as an imperial stout, but very well defined and rich. There was a good bit of sweetness, from the malts and what I'm guessing would be honey because molasses would be too heavy.

Roasted malt, chocolate, mild hops and a little earthiness, especially as it warmed up. Nice rich initial flavor - a little sweet, roasted and burnt malt, caramel, dark chocolate and a nicely balanced bitter hops and roasted malt aftertaste that is pleasantly lingering. Full bodied, well carbonated, smooth but not really creamy. The mouthfeel is just what I want. This is a really solid porter that is great to sip as it warms up.

Roasted malt, coffee and bitter hoppiness came forward towards the end, the coffee especially on the long finish. The alcohol heat was well concealed and the effect was generally complex.

4.23,5.2,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"2008. 9.2% abv. I want to review this beer before only the lower abv version is available. It seems this beer is going down a bit in strength, which I'm not overtly opposed to but I fear any change to this wonderful porter. It's thick and chewy almost like a great stout. It's in a slightly easier categories than the stouts, and its scores reflect this to a modest extent. The beer pours deep and dark with slight highlights on the edges and a mocha head. The smell is tiny bit weak. (Or maybe DIPAs have utterly spoiled me) There are some notes of roasted malt and caramel. The flavor is slightly sweet and ashy. It's a very good caramel wood ash flavor, which doesn't sound great but comes off fairly dry for such a big porter. It has been one of my favorite craft beers for a long time. I love how well Flying Dog got such a big strong beer distributed so widely. The hop bite in the finish is bitter and dry. This beer has a very round flavor and full mouthfeel that compliments the malt notes nearly perfectly. Also, the abv is very well hidden for a big porter. This beer has made me seek out other big porters, like Sinebrychoff, Zywiec and Carnegie. It's a great introduction to big, tasty porters for American beer fans. Without this beer, I would not have readily bought these random-sounding porters from Finland, Poland and Sweden. So much attention is paid to big stouts, while big porters languish in relative obscurity. It's fairly confusing.","popery","Dec 28, 2008"

The RIS flavors made me think the beer was too thin, but being a porter the relative thinness of the body was actually fine. I'm torn to say the least...","spointon","Dec 16, 2008"
4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a solid dark brown with the faintest of ruby on the outer edges. Large fluffy mocha head leaves lace all over. Aroma: Holy hops, I could smell them in the pour. Pine and grapefruit lathered in chocolate and roast. Sounds bad, but smells good. Taste is roasty chocolaty even little bit of ash, especially in the finish/aftertaste. The hops are there, but not as up front as the aroma would lead you to believe, surprisingly balanced for 85 Ibu's Mouthfeel is oily and creamy, Body is a little thin, carbonation is light but appropriate.

First off it is an imperial porter, making it obviously more thick and rich (and more alcohol-ic tasting) in the overall profile. Secondly it has a unique hoppy-floral note lacing the more typical roasted chocolaty, malty and mocha. This is the most impressive part of the beer, it's hoppy sweet floral notes and slight bitter hints really make this normally dark beer far more crisp tasting.

The beer is quite complex, yet it's not a beer that I can drink a lot of. The 85 IBUs of this beer for some reason some come out much except a bit in the after taste; however, it's kind of like an imperial stout in the bitterness.

Dry roasted malt and cocoa flavors evolve into a burnt, mildly alcoholic finish. Has a slightly cloying burnt/bitter aftertaste.

There is a slightly burnt aspect to the coffee and dark chocolate flavors from the roasted malt which come across slightly burnt. The bitterness of the hops also contributes.

A surprising ballance of hops and malt in this one prevent it from being a complete malt bomb.

The taste is strong, definitely burnt molasses, caramel, and a sweetish backbone. The beer is full bodied with no carbonation to speak of. There are strong alcohol warming notes and a lingering aftertaste. This is a good beer, but only for specific circumstances. The 9.2 ABV is quite noticeable. L'Chaim.","albern","Nov 11, 2007"

Part of it could be the movement of the production facility or a change in the ingredients. Either way it's not as lush as it once was. People tell me I'm crazy but I have some of the older bottles stockpiled and bust them out to compare. The old ones still have a great hop profile and a cleaner malt profile/flavor.

It looks like a fairly typical imperial stoutish brew, but then you get your nose over it and get a snootload of hops. OK, this is the second clue that this is going to be a weird beer, the Steadman label being the first clue. There's really nothing else in the aroma but serious hops, though I can't place the type. In the flavor, the hops are present but don't dominate, competing with dark malts and semi-sweet malt body, with no real winner except your taste buds. The malty bitterness clings to your tongue long after you swallow, well in style for anything claiming to be imperial. Likewise a complex imperial brew does not lend itself to a drinking session, but at a very well hidden 9.2% ABV, that might just be a good thing.","MillRat","Oct 23, 2007"

Of the four of five porters I've tried so far this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. The notes that end up as ""subtle"" (undetectable by me) in other beers are here clear as day, and this beer has leaped to the top of list for a fully flavored beer to enjoy after a long day.

With its nice viscous body and milk chocolatey aroma, it is evident you're in for a treat. The taste is great as well - coffee, chocolate, and hint of caramel sweetness. While the pour is thick, the mouthfeel could stand to be a little thicker with more creaminess. However, this should not dissuade you from seeking this beer out - it is dangerously drinkable at 9.2% - very tasty. An ideal after dinner beer. Highly recommended.","montageman","Sep 27, 2007"

A fantastic bitter bite finishes off the whole thing, but doesn't linger long enough to numb the tastebuds. I really enjoy baltic porters, almost moreso than their Russian Imperial counterparts.

Although the folks at BT acted like they were doing a favor (more beer for the same price), they actually did a disservice to a 9.2 ABV sipper. When I get my hands on this stuff at home I'll definitely use a wine glass or equivalent.

Alcohol is a bit present in the nose as well. Flying Dog did a great job with the taste on this one. Very complex, thick, and sweet. Roasted chocolate malt seems to dominate, but brown sugar and a very tiny, but noticable, citrus bitterness appears in the aftertaste. Very full flavored with a lot to recognize with this taste.

The head is monstrous, two full inches of light brown head, lacing in streaks and rings. Just lovely. The aroma is full of roasted malts, espresso, and chocolates, but there is an unexpectedly large amount of leafy, raw, oily hops, reminds me a lot of Surly Darkness (only not as good). And that continues on to the taste, a thick, malty chocolate fist grabbing hold of a leafy, grassy, almost raw hop, and it works very well here. Unfortunately, it doesn't translate to a good mouth, where the carbonation is a little low for a porter, the body is good, but just thins and flattens and disappears much too quickly. When I drink a thick, dark beer, I want to keep feeling and tasting it for some time to come, and I just don't here. Not that it detracts all that much from this delicious brew, it just brings things down a bit. But then again, if this is the closest I can get to Darkness all year round, I can't complain.

The taste is very deep and rich with a winey flavor up front, deep flavors of chocolate malt, dark stewed fruit, and a nice lingering bitterness. The chocolate flavor is very pronounced and is of good cocoa. Some late espresso notes as well. Very nice indeed. Very creamy mouthfeel, medium weight. The alcohol doesn't shine through.

Some dark fruit flavors as well, black cherries and dates, but the beer was more about the rich malty flavors. Noticeable alcohol in the taste as well, but just enough that it wasn't off putting. Good contrasting fresh hops. Any good porter has a decent hop kick in my opinion. There was quite a bit of carbonation from the bottle finishing that broke up the rich creamy-ness of the beer well.

Bitter piney hops are in full effect, as is a ridiculously hot alcohol presence. A mellow chocolatey roastiness emerges at the finish as a saving grace, but because of that over-the-top booziness all through the middle, this one just doesn't have what it takes at this point. Perhaps several years cellared? Grassy, tree-bark aftertaste. Aside from the stinging alcohol heat, the mouthfeel is trying hard to be smooth.

I didnt get much head retention of this one - maybe 3/4 finger - but what was there was a nice caramel brown. Looked very inviting overall. I didnt note as much alcohol in the smell as some have reported, but I did catch the expected burnt coffee, brown sugar, faint raisins, toffee. The nose pretty much foreshadowed the taste to a T. Nice oily hop presence up front with the roasted malt and bitter coffee coming in on the back of the tongue. With the mouthfeel being nice and chewy, almost like oatmeal in itself, for some reason this beer gave me just as much of an impression of a high-octane oatmeal stout as it did a porter. Could have been my mind playing tricks on me. Nonetheless this is quite a good beer; not necessarily one of the all-time greats in this style but quite drinkable. I had two of these last night before I really felt the buzz setting in, and if the buzz had been my goal I probably could have managed one or two more.

The flavor has a quality that reminds of me of bitter or baking chocolate along with flashes of hop bitterness and burnt maltiness. The hoppiness is a surprise, although not unwelcome. The high abv hides well behind within the beer, and allows it to be more drinkable than expected. Overall, this is a solid Baltic Porter with a distinctly American twist, something I would reach for again, but I don't believe it to be a necessarily traditional version of the style.","edmundfitzoil","Apr 11, 2006"

The malts are also present in the taste along with a sour-ish dairy finish. This may not sound the best but it tastes quite good. As the beer warms the sweet aromas become slightly more prevalent. I can feel the alcohol having its effect, but it is very well balanced not overpowering on the palate. The beer is medium to heavy bodied and a very fine porter.","hoppymeal","Apr 06, 2006"

Notably darker than the foam on a glass of Coca-Cola. The head hung around for much longer than I thought it would, and slowly subsided from a foamy ""crown"" to a craggy, pitted head which left thick, almost gooey lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and malty with a good bit of hops tossed in for good measure. You can tell this is going to have a roasted burnt taste to it. Upon taking a sip, there's about 63 different things going on inside your mouth. Unbelievable. You have a creamy smoothness with a pretty big body. Excellent level of carbonation. Lots of malt, a fantastic hop twang right in the middle, and an unsweetened bakers' chocolate / toasted taste on the finish with a nice dryness. This stuff is just incredible. It's well balanced, looks delicious, smells fantastic, and I must add this, as well; the brewers did a smashing job concealing the monster alcohol level as it is nearly un-noticeable. I was very, very surprised at how ""tame"" it was to be a 9%+. Just wonderful...!!","SilentSabre","Mar 04, 2006"

Burstingly hoppy (cascade?) nose becomes very perfumey as it warms, bordering shampoo and definitely green fresh hops to the point of feeling vegetal and salty at times. Cocoa component is all I get from this vague, so-so maltiness that reveals its poor structure in mouth. Dominating roastiness suffers from a strong wave of citric, pine-sol and ashey character, thankfully no lactic aspects, but that the astringence remains limited within those conditions is beyond me. Dry and hoppy palate where unenvelopping dark cocoa and anise-floral loose malts get abashed by growing whispers of alcohol. Medium body, very effervescent. Fair as it is, but forget balance, round malt fruitiness was traded away for a hop putsch.","Rastacouere","Feb 27, 2006"

Medium body with alcohol lighter than expected. There is an earthy taste but leads toward grassy. There is a roasted maltiness that goes towards burnt but overall the malt base seems fairly good.

Not alot of chocolate like i was expecting but rather lighters and floral...really floral at that. Taste is as expected: sweet malts, lots of underlying fruit flavor, smooth, and satisfying taste with the alcohol level very masked. This beer is very creamy and sticky on the mouth, the flavor of this beer makes up for that though. This is a beer that makes a beer belly a beer belly.

A bit of roasted bittersweet chocolates and some raisins are there for the malts but they are completely dominated by the brash and annoying hops. Pine sol flavors, aspirin like. A soy sauce elements comes into play. Alcohol is brash and unsettling. Finish lingers with a burning alcohol sensation.

That went away as I drank more. It is relatively thick, but feels smooth in the mouth and goes down with a mild bitterness.

I'm not tasting coffee like some drinkers are. In fact, it doesn't have that much flavor on the palate, but a lot of hoppy flavor on the aftertaste which I don't like. It's a smooth beer, the mouthfeel is pretty good though nothing out of the ordinary for a reasonable quality beer.

Chocolate is buried and some grassy hop co-humulone is present. Not much hop flavor (which is a stark contrast to a glass I had fresh at the brewery about 6 months ago). At this point, the citrusy hops have settled, but the alcohol now needs time to cool down. Md-thick body with a bit too mcuh carbonation. The carb detracts from the beer, IMO.

4.15,3.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Poured a complety black beer with a dark tan head that is a finger thick and has strong retention and leaves a little lace.. I love the aroma of this beer! It reminds me of the smell of hops as they enter the boil kettle. Spicy hop aroma with a hint of a citrus and a roasty malt as well. The flavor begins with a smooth roast barley and sweet malt flavor that segues into a more spicy hoppy balance to finish with a lingering hop bitterness and a lot of alcohol. The body is smooth and viscous and it has just enough carbonation to keep the head from disapearing. Overall I like this beer because of the very pleasent aroma and the fact that it has a huge flavor and it is distinct. To me it is like the hoppier brother to Old Rasputin which is another beer i love to enjoy during the winter. I think that flying dog should drop their barleywine and sell this instead.","RenoZymurgist","Dec 04, 2005"

Caramel sweetness, slight plum fruitiness. Fluffy carbonation. Piney, woody hops in the finish, dryish, with a soft kiss of alcohol. If i had to summarize the flavor in a sentence, it's like a fancy chocolate chip cookie, the kind with the big chunks of baker's chocolate and crushed walnuts. Very nice.

San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run, but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. And that, I think, was the handle - -that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn't need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting - -on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark - -the place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.","Higravity","Sep 30, 2005"
4.12,2.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,5,"Pours near black with hardly any head after a minute. Upon first smelling it, the hops stick out. Very citrusy and piney! This is unexpected. There is definitely quite a bit of roasted malt and coffee as well. Also chocolate. Taste is creamy chocolaty malt at first, then the hops kick in. Unlike what other reviewers experienced, I thought the hops were restrained very well, despite being unusual for the style. The hops in the taste come in the form mainly of piney, bittering hops, which linger in the finish, along with some coffee taste for a couple seconds. If anything, my only complaint about the taste is that the finish is a little weak. This probably isn't helped by the relatively thin mouthfeel either. The alcohol never makes an appearance though and drinkability is off the charts. I can't remember a beer so high in alcohol that is so easily quaffed.","PatYoda","Sep 28, 2005"

Fresh, grassy hops hit your nose first, with malt and coffee notes following behind along with faint alcohol. Sweet and roasted malt kick off the flavour profile, but the grassy hop character appears soon behind and becomes a major part of the flavour through to the finish. Bitterness is moderate and builds with some citrusy hops into the finish. Chocolate and coffee makes themselves known as well. Hop flavours linger for quite some time, with a tiny bit of alcohol warmth. Full, round body with low, well integrated carbonation that gives it a slightly creamy texture. Slightly dry, roasted finish, but the hops seem to keep this in check. This is a very interesting combination of flavours, certainly not expected. Highly recommended.","DrJay","Sep 25, 2005"

Aroma assaults you with fields of grassy, piney hops amongst burnt yet sweet grain, all drowning in a pool of somewhat obscured alcohol. Taste starts with sweet chocolate upfront, hits its hops groove in the middle, and smoooths again with more dark malts at the close. Alcohol is felt more than tasted.

Shockingly, it has almost zero alcohol flavor, with a lingering after taste of hops and chocolate. Mouth feel is a bit oily, but with plenty of carbonation to off set it, and makes for a good balnce.

Aroma of prunes and nutmeg, odd hops that remind me distinctly of milkweed of all things. The mouthfeel is thinner than an Imperial Stout and many ordinary Porters -- with higher than average carbonation. What a weird flavor, the aroma impression is all over the tastebuds, bitter weeds and stale coffee grounds, I assume from an over hopping gone wrong (for me, at least). Not very coating in body either. Chalky, astringent and overly sharp at the swallow. Plenty of alcohol. Maybe an ""Imperial"" Porter (whatever the hell that means) in alcohol and rampant nasty bitterness, a mess of a Baltic or Robust Porter. Thin, overcarbonated, green, weedy -- maybe this might age OK, but as is, I am NOT a fan of this one. Cartoon of a beer, IMO, close to a disaster. If this beer didn't look good, it would be a total loser and its amazing how people ""follow the leader"" in praising this bilge -- in my opinion, of course, LOL.","ADR","Jul 15, 2005"

4.03,0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours opaque black from a 12oz bottle with a skeletal rendition of the good doctor. Tightly knit brown head tops off the brew and leaves some sticky lacing on the glass. Hops are surprisingly apparent in the nose, radiating some esters and light citrous. Not to be outdone, heaps of coffee and roasted grain punch through the hoppy aroma like a battering ram. Taste begins with a bitter roasted bite which transitions into thick coffee and a little chocolate. Hops lends a bit of spiciness which mingles with the warming alcohol presence. Citrous rises above the intense dry roasted character in the finish, some acidity is perceived. Big malts lend a smoothness to the mouthfeel, which is kept in check by the crispness of the hops and the roasted flavor. Mouthfeel almost tends towards oily at different points, which I enjoy. Alcohol is pleasantly noticeable, but subtle. Not sure if Thompson would have preferred this to Wild Turkey, but its an interesting example of a porter. Fine job on a tribute beer by the Flying Dog crew.","BeerFink","Jul 12, 2005"

Nose is that of roasted grain, sweet and mouth-watering, coffee, chocolate, it has it all; start is nicely malted with a moderate in feel top.

Where's the roasted malts or the coffee aromas? This seems to be headed down hill very quickly. Taste wasn't any better. Grainy and a load of hops start out and end the same way. How about having a ton of roasted malts and coffee beans with an underlying of piney hops? That would seem to make more sense. Finished a little oily as well. Mouthfeel was overcarbonated and finished with hardly no taste. Almost seltzer like aftertaste. This one was really off the mark.

4.1,2,4,4,4.5,4,3.5,"I think this does fit the Baltic porter category, with perhaps a bit of an American spin. No sparing of the malt on this - chock full of deeply roasted flavors - French roast coffee, almost burned caramel, dark sorgum. A bit more hoppy than the average Baltic porter, which I think is the American touch. The beer lacked the acidity found in some Baltic porters, which was not at all a detraction. It was a little rough around the edges, but that is really the nature of this particular beer - it seems intended to bite back at you a little. ETOH was a bit prominent in the flavor profile, but not enough to be a signficant detraction. Not a lot of U.S. brewers are going for this style, and, while Flying Dog hasn't always been a hit with me, I like what they've done with this beer.","Brent","Jun 17, 2005"

I get some nice hoppy burps from this. Very nice. The feel is moderate to thick, with a moderate carbonation. I really like this beer. The drinkability is huge. Easy drinking and smooth, with everything working well for it. I like it, but its not really what I expect from a baltic porter.","kmpitz2","Jun 14, 2005"

The alcohol isn't as apparent in the flavor as it was inthe nose. Very tasty, but I don't agree with this as being a Baltic Porter. It's missing a key ingredient that I can't place.

Aroma of chocolate, malt and a good amount of hops. Medium-bodied and tastes like a regular Porter just with more alcohol. Lots of chocolate and malt flavor, along with some hops and alcohol bite. The finish is decidedly bitter espresso and alcohol. Overall the ""Imperial"" tag feels tacked on but as far as the beer goes it was pretty enjoyable.","Dogbrick","Jun 13, 2005"
3.85,-4.2,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a creamy, slightly frothy brown head that sits atop a midnight black beer. The aroma has a spicy hop note to it up front. There is an intermingling of pine and citrus hop notes with espresso & roasted malt notes, as well as a bit of chocolate. The beer has a thickish, creamy body. This beer is aggressively hopped, at least considering that I was not expecting much in the way of hop character in this beer. The fresh, herbal hop notes actually are the most distinctive part of this beer. Running throughout is a sweet, malty chocolate note that finishes out with an astringent sharp espresso note. This beer has notes of bergamot, grapefruit, and pine. This beer is perhaps a little on the light side, and could of course use a bit more malty notes to help tame the hop notes, but I am definitely enjoying this right now. This was a surprisingly pleasant beer, from a brewery that I honestly have not been all too fond of.","Gueuzedude","Jun 11, 2005"
