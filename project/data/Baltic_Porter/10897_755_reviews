"Overall – This is a very nice easy drinking porter at of only 5.5 %. A quite tasty brew overall and one to try if you have the opportunity."

"11.2oz bottle $3.99. I remember reading this was a classic porter so why not. Black with a filmy head that laces the glass. Aroma is yeast and dough. Flavor is slightly smoky, roast malts, touch of chocolate. Not my favorite but not bad, worth a try."

"2010 vintage.  Pours a clear dark amber with a rich dark ruby cast.  Excellent head volume, lacing and retention.  Complex nose of dark fruit (fig, plum), molasses and caramel over notes of chocolate and a hint of coffee.  Light medium body with a bit of creaminess over a smooth texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.  The World Class flavor profile is reasonably intense, quite complex and masterfully balanced.  It begins with a caramel sweet rush that soon flows into the dark fruits.  In the middle, molasses comes to the forefront and fades into a mild roast and hop bitterness.  As it approaches the finish, chocolate sweetness is evident and oak notes (oxidative aging) are present as is a subtle smokiness.  The finish is a slow fade of sweetness into a mild hop bitterness with just a hint of dryness."
"Notes: served from an 11.2oz bottle into a pint, mouthfeel is a bit more sharply carbonated than I expected. That is the only thing I didn't care for, but it wasn't bad, merely unexpected. And once I adjusted to the more double bock taste than anticipated I was able to enjoy it. Not surprising given it is a Swede. In fact, it is nice to enjoy a beer from somewhere other than the usual suspects. At 5.5% and a bit rich I won't be quaffing pints, but this is a very enjoyable beer and worth seeking out. Throw some beer love Sweden's way."

"O- A porter by the numbers but executed so well.  Very drinkable as well as very flavorful.   Now I see what all the hubbub's about."

"Rich malts, going along with toffee, earthy notes, hints of chocolate, coffee and smoke. Sweet malts melt together with chocolate, supported by a perfect fitting carbonation, resulting in a smoky, warm finish. Malt goes through different stages on the palate, mingles up with coffee and later on chocolate, but keeps being the most defining ingredient of this beer the whole time. Oily, smooth mouthfeel, with a bitter finish."

"2004 vintage in my I Believe snifter. Still has a surprising carbonation  herringbone head falls back quickly but clings softly to the side of the glass. All the rough edges have been smoothed of this, leaving polished obsidian. Madagascar vanilla, cocoa and the hint of black currant roll past. Evaporating into a dry licorice finish. A dark pleasure!"

"O: A nice true to style, old school Baltic porter. One of the style benchmarks."

"Happily no significant oxidation. Have had this many times, but this time worthy writing about. Beer was a soft wash of roasted coffee and bitter chocolate. Excellent mouth feel, which is delightful considering the rather low abv. My 61 yo old nose doesn't pick up much these days, but there is still a nice roasted grain scent and a hint of fruity sweetness. This is just a great porter. May possibly be my favorite ever. As a lover of Porter...No small praise."
"This one was impressive because it lasted so long and remained drinkable- it also helps that it tasted pretty good!"

"O - The smells from this beer are robust, and while the beer is more restrained when it hits the palate, the overall result is a top-notch porter."
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a very nice beer. The aroma, in particular, just keeps revealing new flavors with each sniff and each new flavor just seems to fold into the rest in a really pleasing package. The taste is a bit simpler and the mouth is a touch lighter than I would like, but I would happily drink more of this."

"Bottle 2013, Klass III. Pours black with small, creamy, beige head and nice lacing. Aroma is of floral hops, toasted malt, dark fruit and coffee. Body is full and slightly crisp. Taste is of toasted malt, coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, dark fruit and floral hops. Finish is long and bittersweet. Very nice porter."

"This offering is hard to rate in comparison with other Baltics. It seems to be more in the vein of a classic Baltic while most contemporary beers of the style are heavier in body and roasted malt. I'll just say that this is a unique and very tasty offering."
""
""
"Flavor: dark fruits, dark bread, light smoke and a hint of coffee."
""
""
""
"Carnegie Porter is a dark beer likely to appeal to those most afraid of them; I should have expected such a watered-down product from Carlsberg. There's nothing bold or intimating about this supposed Baltic Porter - it's as much a caricature as the Swedish chef from the Muppets. Scandinavians do much bolder (and better) than this. Don't waste your time on it."

"Dark and perfekt with plenty taste.."
""
""

"O - Roasted and bitter with out backbone, this light (in every sense of the word) Baltic Porter has flimsy, lopsided flavor and the makings of a nice Baltic but little body to back it up."
""
""

"I went into my local well-stocked beer store and cruised for eye-candy as neither my memory nor my heart could come up with an otherwise specific reference. I saw the label, the color, the unique bottle shape and I was at the register faster than I could change my mind. I came home, started heating up the kitchen cooking and anticipating what my mind was computing my heart's eye's whim came up with at the beer shop and I could stand it no longer. I popped my stellar bottled ""firmament"" anxiously pouring it into a handy pint glass to find a most satisfying cooking companion to prepare my palate for the delicious spicy peppers and pasta meal I was preparing. Round, brown, sweet, and smooth. A lucky privileged guy am I. Some of the elements I find in this drink I also look for in my morning espresso, my other main hobby. This is now a permanent inclusion to my short go-to list, awesome everytime brew."
""
"Overall I'm glad this was recommended to me. It's a fairly robust porter with good depth of flavor and supreme drinkability. Definitely a nice change from the typical American style porters that are so common. Highly recommended."

"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a mug. Pours pitch black with a foamy brown head. Smells of chocolate, a little coffee. Tastes of raisins, fruit, and candy, quite surprising. Beer lightly carbonated full body nice finish. Overall a slightly above average beer."
""
"Looks stout but has a thinner, lighter feel though it seems too rich and smooth to be a porter."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer if you just want one quick brew with not too much alcohol and a big interesting taste. Sit on the back porch like I am now and enjoy your brew!"

"What a beautiful Baltic Porter. If you like dark beers, it is a must."
""
""
""
"O- a historic brew! One of the first original style porters I've had and one that will always be near and dear to me. This is the brew you should introduce yourself with when trying a porter for the first time."
""
"O: Lowish carbonation aside, this has aged like a champ. A shame I'll likely never be able to find this again (barring a trade) because this is really excellent stuff. And hey, I didn't have to drink a crappy Carlsberg lager or sell my soul for a bottle of Kaggen! Stormakstporter just so I could tick a Swedish brew!"
""
"Dark brown with ruby highlights and generous foamy tan head that crowns the beer. Very subtle nose, nothings jumping right out. Hints of caramel, roast and chocolate, with even a bit of alcohol as it warms, but its all very much in balance. Mild coffee and hint of Burgundy wine, even a bit tannic mouthfeel, but only serves to balance the malt sweetness."

"was fortunate enough to find a 2000 vintage bottle of this for just 13 bucks. the label reads best before November 2010, but im thinking its not past its prime at all. it pours a surprisingly lively darkest of browns, without any light at all able to pass through. the head is made up of micro bubbles of a lighter brown color. the head doesn't last, but its easily reinvigorated with a swirl of my globe. the nose on this is heavy chocolate, burnt malt, ash, and a gentle toffee tickle. it has an aged mellowness to it, very earthy and organic, with roasted barley and cocoa powder dominating up front. the finish is like all the best features of dusty leather, my grandpas attic, mature compost, and smoked pork. its just so complex and delicious. there is a funny astringent bitterness towards the finish and the alcohol stands out more than it should in a beer so low in abv, but other than that its phenomenal. the mouthfeel makes it for me, so gentle on the carbonation, and curiously dry for the style. I love the cocoa powder flavor, it transforms into a cocoa powder feel of sorts, really cool. age has definitely done wonders for this beer, and while ive never had a fresh one, I can assure you that this is one special porter. perhaps also my first beer from Sweden. memorable."

"This is a pretty good porter overall."

"O: Very interesting Porter here all the sweetness you want but there is a touch of bitterness that brings everything back. Great ABV that makes this a pretty damn good session beer. Worth looking for it you can find it."

"It is an outstanding balance between rich, full character, complexity, and easy drinkability."
""
"Overall- I love this beer. I will buy this over and over again. Next time I see it I'm gonna buy a few to drink and a couple to store. I have one Ike holding for a year, but I have a feeling two or three or more years will make this beer absolutely fanfuckintastic."
""
""
"O - I had hoped to like this more, but it was only slightly above average. Maybe I'll give it a chance again in the future. After a long, tough day, it could be my palate is messed up. Others seem to like it more, so it's worth a try. Not bad, just not that great. (And I love the Swedes.)"

"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark brown with red tint at the edges with a light tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of toasted malt and light chocolate. Tasted kind of understated on opening, with dark roasted malt and dark fruit. On warming a bit, the cherry, chocolate, vanilla and molasses started coming out. Great flavoe. Medium bodied with some creaminess. A quite nice low ABV porter. I bought this on a whim without great expectations and was very pleasantly surprised, will buy again."
""
"The pour is brown in color with a small tan head. Some roast malt, dark fruit, and a hint of coffee come through first on the nose. A bit dusty and oxidized. Quite a lot of dark fruit, especially prunes. The flavor is fairly simple. Some roasted malt, chocolate, and tons of dark fruit."
"O: Good drinker, quite satisfying. Nice beer to end the day with. One of the better offering of this style."
""
""
""
"This beer is a 2004 vintage. It pours dark brown with some ruby tints to it. I can smell roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and some dark fruit. It tastes pretty much like it smells, very good. The mouthfeel is a bit slick, but also smooth and creamy at the same time. The carbonation is low, and this is a very drinkable porter. This is a pretty good beer, I'd definitely drink it again."
""
""
"o: I first had this several years ago and was blown away. Happy to say that this is still one of my absolute favorite porters."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad."
""
"O - What an odd beer. It has some roasty tobacco malt notes, but it also has a surprisingly bright fruit element to it. Really delicious aged beer that I got for a bargain price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite nice. A great porter."
""
""
"Pitch black with a fluffy, beige head that reduces to a creamy ring around the edge of the glass. Some sediment left in the bottle. Interesting aroma - along with a fresh chocolate grain richness, there is a good amount of toffee, nuts, prune, and port. Dark malt and fruit flavor exhibiting some tartness and a dry roasty edge. Dark fruit, berries, and molasses. Not as rich as many Baltic Porters, but then it is unusually light in alcohol. Medium bodied and pretty clean, but seems to fall a little flat. I'd be interested to see what this would be like properly cellared for a couple more years."
"A fine porter!!!"
""
"This was such a surprise! I'd seen it on the shelves & never really thought much of it til now - really glad I tried it! Given the restrained alcohol, this is a great example of how a lot of flavor can be crammed into a fairly tidy package. There are just so many emerging layers, each sip is kind of a new experience. I also love how it straddles the line btw. lager & ale at times. What a cool brew!"
""
""
"O - A nice beer, good enough to try again."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a deep dark brown with a milk chocolate 2 finger head that settles into a nice 1/2 finger head. The aroma is nice of chocolate, sweet brown sugar and some slight roasted malts. The taste is a little grainy strong on the sweeter malts. Not too much of a hop presence to balance things. A little roasted malt, but not enough dark roast flavor. Medium body with lighter carbonation. A decent brew but not a top tier porter."
"Very dark brown, average and mostly diminishing light brown head. Moderate, malty and sweetish aroma, fruitiness - dark fruits, some coffee and roasted malt. Body is medium, malty and sweetish flavor, some fruitiness and coffee,light roasted malt. Finish is average, malty and sweetish, coffee and some roasted malt, light fruitiness and hoppyness. Overall, this porter was a bit too flattish for me, but had a nice vinous fruitiness to it."
""
""
"Not super impressed with this beer. Basically a notch or two above a dark Euro lager. Definitely not a baltic porter in my eyes."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson brown with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a thin cap. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, dark fruit, dark sugar, vanilla, and some earthy tobacco-like aromas. Taste is of dark malt, dark dried fruit (prune/raisin), leather, smoke, tobacco, and slight cocoa nibs. There is a light roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good baltic porter and a rare treat that is around 8 years old. I am glad I picked one of these up to try."
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the most complex brews I've ever had. There are so many flavors going on in both the nose and in the mouth. I had a great evening listening to Jaga Jazzist Live at the Cosmopolite and sipping on a glass of this stuff. It's not too often that I say I'm going to have to revisit a brew to see if I can figure it out more, but this is one of those."
""
"WOW that’s a great beer. We had a Porter & Stout beer tasting over New Years Eve and of the 12 beers we tried this was hands down #1. Some of the beers we had were bitter, or had chocolate and coffee flavors, too much going on in some of them. Carnegie Porter had the straight-up porter style that I look for, full flavored, smooth with a short creamy head, World Class. This is the first beer I felt compelled to review."
"Overall, this doesn't blow me away, but it is far better than any 5.50% ABV attempt at a Blaltic Porter. In fact, I'm very impressed by the amount of aroma and flavor are in a beer this light."
""
""
"O - I was really looking forward to this based on its reviews and recommendations. It's pretty solid, but not my A+ Baltic porter. I'd drink it if offered, but probably won't seek it out."
"O - Really nice porter. For what it was supposed to be it did quite well."
"O. The entire experience is perfect. From the price, the cool bottle, to the pour and the smell. The taste is a journey but subtle enough to drink more than one. I'm not eating anything but I can pair this with all kinds of foods, some grilled lamb with asparagus, for dessert some raisin pudding cake maybe a vanilla ice cream. I'm going to age my other bottle and let those flavors grow."
""

"I was pretty close to giving this one a 5 on taste too...alas, it's only about four layers of flavor deep. Damn, this is a great porter. Deep rich color out of the bottle and into the glass. 2010 vintage. Baltic baby. Smell is super complex. There's a lot going on here and I inhale deeply with every sip. Lots of depth on the tongue. Malty. Well balanced. I almost should change that to a 5 on taste. This is a perfect Baltic porter. Mouthfeel is energetic but silky. Highly recommended."
"Pours the darkest of brown with faint ruby highlights when held to light. A good sized creamy off white head dissipates rather quickly, but leaves moderate lace in its wake. Smells of caramelized sugar and dark pitted fruit mostly but has hints of coffee and chocolate on the outer fringes. This one smells like a fine dopplebock honestly. Taste is moderately fruity with hints of chocolate and ash. Deep burnt sugars mix with dark fruit and a little bit of coffee. Medium body with a light level of carbonation and a creamy smooth mouthfeel. This is a very tasty beer. It really straddles the line between porter and dopplebock for me though. Maybe one day I can try a fresher example."
"O - Very good porter. Easily drinkable. Charming traditional look beer label."
"As Baltic porters go, this hardly qualifies: it lacks the weight, the density, the burn and the booze. As a straight porter, however, it's quite good. There's just enough vanilla, citrus and bubbly sting to make it a happy little beer. It's a tad smoky without being overly charred, and for once we have a porter that doesn't reek of coffee. You'll be able to have more than one (bring your wallet) and *still* be able to operate a power tool with a spinning blade. Maybe."
"Overall / Drinkability: Outstanding beer. Wonderful taste and if this truly is the same recipe as was brewed in 1836, then this is a beer recipe of perfection for the ages. If not, well it's still quite good and I could easily have another one or two. Very good by itself and would be good with a meal as well. I had this by itself but I could easily see having this with beef or a dessert."
"Iight herbal bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, delicate carbonation and very easy to drink. In fact, it took me longer to enter this than to drink it. A fine Sweedish export."
"Enjoyed it, held up amazingly for how old/low ABV it was. Heard it was a relatively cheap one to aquire, will be on the lookout for older vintages in the future."
"Overall-- this is nice. I'll be grabbing some more of this to sample at various stages of aging."
"O - Overall, this isnt a bad baltic porter. I wouldn't buy it again though as there are some great represenations of this style elsewhere."
"Ordered a bottle of this at the Allentown Brew Works once. I was shocked to see how much they were charging for this brew. I could have found it cheaper and which I would have let it in their cooler. Anyway, The beer poured out as a nice looking rich black color. The head was big and strong looking at first but settled down to just a thin tan creamy looking film over top of the brew. The lacing was light on the glass. The smell was full of roasted malts and just some minimal fruit elements shining through. The taste of the beer has a bold burnt bitterness up front, and some dark fruit sweetness which faded into a dark chocolate dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer had a decent thickness to it. Overall it was way too expensive at $15 a bottle. Should have been half that I think. But other than the price it was pretty good."
"Dr: Average range ABV, very drinkable, and of a high price. The quality is nothing special."
"O- The well-blended flavors of dark malt are smooth and very easy to drink but still have some nice depth. There were some grain and pot caramel qualities that are hard to describe in there. It is a great ""recreation"" of a historic beer and a lovely session beer."
"500ml bottle: Mine was marked ""ARGANG 2006", although I bought it recently. This one pours an inky very dark brown color. Mine had about no head on it whatsoever. A little bit of a sweeter aroma. Caramel and toffee, with just a faint roastiness in there also. A bit of sweetness in the taste. Coffee, chocolate, caramel, toffee and a hint of roastiness dominate the taste. A touch of slickness on the tongue. Nice!"
"T: Much sweeter than I expected. Espresso, chocolate, chocolate cake, roasted malt and maybe a touch of hops towards the finish. Pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is slightly thin but has a nice creamy feel."
"Overall a good rather than excellent beer. A little extra mouthfeel and definitely more complexity would have promoted it to great. Although I have never tasted the old top fermented version I can safely say that this beer would be ages better as a top fermented one."
"Anyhow, I can envision a fresher bottle being a fine session porter, but this bottle didn't cut it."
"A very solid baltic porter, if on the low end of the alcohol spectrum. The flavor and aroma are quite good, though I do find it to be a little bit sweet for my taste. Still, fantastic."
"Carnegie Porter smells of coffee, roasted malt, raisins. It tastes sweet, chocolate coming out, more roasted malts and coffee. MF leans towards lighter with a creamy texture. This porter from Sweden is very good and pairs well with chocolate or other desserts."
"Pours a blackish body w/ good head and minimal lace ring w/ a slightly dry roasted, coffeesue malt aroma, even bready, as well as little sticky sweetness. More of the same w/ the beer as it is lighter bodied, minimal carbonation so it passes smooth and easy, almost creamy, w/ sweet caramel, cocoa and a touch of vanilla (maybe) along with a little dry malt taste (roasted or coffee, or something like bread/dough/yeast). Simplistic and not overwhelming but well-crafted and a great sipper to have after a meal."
"Undoubtedly benchmark porter. Class in a glass. Let the prostrating begin."
"Very drinkable. Very nice foreign style porter. Could a number of these in one sitting, very sessionable."
"Drinkability: Stout lovers (and I am one) will really enjoy this world class stout. A huge mouthful of flavor with every sip (and the flavors only get better as it warms). Will definitely seek this one out again when I'm in the mood for a flavorful stout!"
"Really drinkable. It's creamy and goes down easy. It's full of good flavors. There is some bitterness in the finish, but nothing overwhelming. Alcohol is only slightly above average. Very easy to empty a glass."
"D - Very high drinkability factor. I'm not sure if this is 2004 vintage, but if it is it held up very nicely for the last 7 years! A 5.5% ABV brew should not have held up this nicely. Either way, a very nice example of the style."
"Poured into a Great Lakes snifter. Medium thick creamy head dispersed with large bubbles. Chocolate black in color with no visible carbonation. Aroma is a strong almond note and some fusel alcohol. Mouthfeel is creamy just a touch above thin, definitely not a stout. Finish is dry across the tongue and and on the roof of the mouth. Flavor is a good subtle roast with a mellow chocolate flavor."
"It's a #1 cellar candidate, keep several as long as you can, that's my advice."
"I would like to try both a younger & older version before settling on my verdict."
"Even with the aroma and flavor of moldy books predominating, this was rather easy to drink. Perhaps this bottle was stored improperly. It didn't taste skunked, but there certainly seemed to be some degradation here."
"As I worked my way through the bottle, I came to appreciate the beer more. Not my favorite Baltic Porter but nice considering its historic significance."
"Note: 2004 vintage"
"This is a tasty porter. Compared to others, this one is a bit too light on the carbo, almost flat. Hops are not detected. There's a lot of molasses and it's not as dry as a typical porter. The fruity stuff is a little odd and seems to be common in Nordic brews of many different styles."
"fantastic beer!!! I found this on the menu of cafe rouge in berkeley. served in a tall slender pint glass, poured from approx 22 oz bottle. the thick tan head of medium and small sized bubbles lasts long enough for the beer to reach optimal tasting temperature. once it warms, you can smell more of the chocolate malts. tastes like chocolate, coffee, burned, some spices and a slight boozy late favoring. I loved it... it was drinksble and tasted good in my mouth, as it was not quite a thick meal in a mug, nor too light, as little red says, it I'd just right, and fantastic at that."
"Overall a really nice beer. I picked this up on a whim, and was putting off drinking it. Now I want to get a few more bottles."
"The taste is complex, first and foremost. There is plenty of molasses and brown sugars. There are some roasted notes and sweetish malts. There are some raisiny flavors and maybe a slight touch of nut flavors. This is good stuff. The beer does have a bit of a beef steak taste to it as well. I can see pairing this with some bloody red meat, although that's not my fare. There is a touch of Rauchbier in this porter too. This is a complex, medium bodied, creamy, smooth, sweetish porter with lots of molasses flavors and brown malts. This is a winner. The mouthfeel is just right and there is no unpleasantness in the aftertaste. L'Chaim."
"Drinkability: this beer is more than the sum of its parts. I like Baltic porters in general, and Carnegie is kind enough to clock in at a low enough ABV to basically be a session beer. Great stuff."
"2006 the bottle says. Pours a deep dark brown, with a lacy head. Smells of dried fruits and roasty-ness. Mmmmm... this is a very nice porter. Molasses mixed with more dried fruits and toast in a very drinkable beer. Tastes bigger than its 5.5%. Wish this was more affordable in the US-- I'd drink this all fall and into the winter."
"The end of the flavor is slightly abrupt which cuts down on the drinkability for me. It's good and you can't say it's watery, but still the flavor ends quickly."
"This beer pours a nearly opaque black color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes very slowly into a one inch cap of lacing. This is a very sexy looking beer. The aroma roasted malt, cream, and a lot of black licorice. The taste is mostly of black licorice, with hints of cream and black malt. There is a firm roasted malt bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a very good beer that I will definitely drink again."
"Overall it is a bit thin and watery for the style, not really worth the pickup imo."
"drinkability- just amazing, world class porter here, i got if for 99 cents cuz the place thought it was distressed and discontinued, but wow, cant believe that at 5.5 a beer can be this great 4 years later, amazing and probably best porter i have had privilege of having, if you see it get it you wont be sorry"
"Poured a 1 tan head. To me this whole thing comes across as coffee just in slightly varying degrees - the appearance is black coffee, the bouquet is a weak iced coffee, and the flavor is a slightly sweet and mild coffee dessert - like maybe a cold coffee pie slice. Hey I still enjoyed it, there just wasn't a lot of complexity in my sample, and it cost me $8 for a 9 oz bottle so I was expecting more. Perhaps my sample sat on the shelf in Massachusetts too long and if I'd had a fresher sample in Sweden I'd be singing the praises?"
"The taste causes this musky beer to take a hit in the drinkability category but it was worth a shot, I'd be willing to give it a second chance on tap."
"Drinkability -- If you told me a 5.5% beer would maintain this well over the course of six years, I wouldn't have believed you. Great stuff."
"O: Quite impressed, deserves to have survied all these years."
"Vintage date says 2004. Pours coca-cola brown, with some half finger head. Smells a little sweet, a little roasty, some smokey hints in there too. First sip was good, second was a even better. Smokey, roasted, a little dark chocolate flavors, a little sweet aftertaste, similar to a rauchbier, but it also reminds me of zywiec's porter. I had this beer years ago when I first started getting into beer and I found it again, and I'm glad I did. Such a refreshing difference from most american porters (this one is swedish). The smokey flavors are a nice touch, just enough presence that I won't complain. Nice light beer, nice rich flavors. I'd love to have this on cask sometime."
"Drinkability: Certainly surprised that this beer has held up for so long, though at this stage I wouldn't put it in the top tier for the style; would be interesting to contrast with a fresher version"
"D - very tasty and smooth, but the sweet raisin taste would get a little old after glass number two."
"Pitch black colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is very pleasant with dark fruit and cocoa powder.Taste is dark fruit,caramel,butterscotch and chocolate.A very flavorful and good beer.I would highly recommend and definetly purchase again in the near future."
"D: 33cl is just too small of a bottle."
"Drinkability - Enjoyable beer that has much more flavor than the abv would suggest."
"This goes down FAR too easily - thankfully, it's under 6%. Highly recommend that you pick this one up if you see it."
"D – Again, I am shocked that this brew is nearly six years old. At 5.5%, I wouldn't think it would keep so well. But it certainly does."
"I was surprised, this is a mighty fine beer! Great flavor and a clean roastiness, but still refreshing and leaving you wanting more. I should definitely go buy some more..."
"As a Porter lover this was an enjoyable experience. All in all, this is one of the best Porters I have tried. I generally enjoy the Deschutes Black Butte (especially cask!) as well as the Alaskan Smoked. I wasn't expecting much from a Swedish brew but wow, this is a winner."
"A beer to drink quietly after dinner."
"D: This is a very nice take on a baltic porter. Not too filling and goes down easily. The sweetness in it lessens the drinkability for me, but is perfect to enjoy a pint or two."
"All about balance. Perhaps a challenge to what some other brewers are putting out as a Baltic, which is basically an Imperial Porter. But this is understated, subtle and oh so drinkable."
"A very well made porter, good drinkability."
"D- Very drinkable due to the light body and lack of intensity."
"The most drinkable baltic porter I've ever had, without relinquishing much if any flavor despite the lower ABV. If not for the high price, I would choose this as a session ale over many English or American porters."
"Overall, this one went fast. Not overly boozy, and great balance, body, and strenght/complexity of flavor. A very good and interesting porter to try. From 2004 batch."
"D: Well balanced. Nice and a bit complex. A very nice porter from Sweden."
"Pours a deep mahogany with a finger of tan head that soon dissipates to a thin and patchy film. Only a few spots of lace are left behind. The nose has an extremely enticing mix of chocolate, roasted malt and very strong and sweet dark fruit. Once the beer is tasted it reveals a large treacle character, which is more than likely the result if waves of raisin, chocolate and brown sugar melding together. This is accompanied by a light coffee roast and moderate bitterness. Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel with a hint of alcohol in the tail. This beer drinks bigger than it is, which is a great feat for a lower ABV Baltic porter, and probably makes it one of the few that could be sessioned."
"An unexpected treat, had never heard of the beer before- ""Pripps Carnegie Porter."" Dark black appearance, decent head. Mild aroma, rich malty taste with huge roast and chocolate flavor and a nice hoppy edge. Full mouthfeel, solid drinkability. Fantastic porter, almost stout-ish. Very well balanced, clean flavo. Would instantly order again if seen. Definitely recommended."
"D: This is a good beer, but no more. I like the vinous and fruity character it showcases. But it's kind of restrained, both in terms of aromas and flavors, and it lacks complexity, and in my opinion, its reputation as one of the best porters in the world is greatly exaggerated. Perhaps it once was, but the way the brewery has treated this classic beer during the last decade is embarrassing."
"This is probably one of my favorite porters, and I attribute that to a good balance of tastes -- malty sweetness contrasted with a pleasant roasted bitterness. The coffee and chocolate flavors are agreeable because they remain mild in character. Unlike some stouts and porters, I could enjoy more than one of these and not feel overwhelmed by the flavor. I recommend this one to anyone looking for a tasty, drinkable porter to enjoy on a rainy autumn afternoon."
"D - This is a heavy porter, with a powerful aftertaste. Put simply this is an awesome brew, and needs to be tried. I will definitely be stocking up a few of these to be drinking over winter."
"drinkability: wouldn't throw back too many, but I could sip this indefinitely."
"Aroma is malty, smoky and slightly yeasty with a good undertone of fine coffee and molasses. It pours a dark chocolate brown with a thick pale beige head that is fine-bubbled and fairly persistent. Flavor is malty and mocha-ish with just a whisper of sweetness. Texture is smooth and lively though not as thick as that of some other stouts."
"D - this beer was a good experience overall, but i dont think i would buy it again."
"D: Definitely a drinkable Baltic Porter. Sweeter than most, but goes down easy."
"D: I really, really liked this. It was a dreary day out side, and this beer served as a nice pick me up. I'm happy to have found this and will visit it again."
"I've never tasted anything like this before. A porter that is really one of a kind. It seemed almost like a fine scotch."
"3/20/2010 - Still awesome."
"It's a shame that current reviews paint the newer product as not worthy of the hype the original got. I didn't have very high hopes for this beer (I thought it would have been well past its peak), but I was pleasantly surprised, and slightly disappointed that I may never have one again...at least not in this incarnation."
"D: considering the thin body and low ABV, I found it surprisingly difficult to drink. enjoyable and all, but I'm not sure I'll pick up another."
"This is a fine porter, but it has been a great porter, but not anymore."
" Cheers!"
"Great tasting porter. Very well balanced."
"Solid drinkable beer that did meet my expectations."
"Notes from: 12/30/04"
"Blackish-brown with only a streak of orange to it, weak head upon the pour, what's there dissolves quickly. Energetic roasted nose of coffee bean, caramel, malt and prune, date fruit, furnishes orange peel, dough and cinnamon stick, doesn't really attack you, more of a marathon runner than sprinter. Light to medium-bodied, this makes it much easier to chug given the thicker flavors of caramel, toffee, coffee ice cream and orange peel. More white fruit than black fruit here. Nothing bitter about it, smooth and unrolls confidently across the tongue. Long finish, full possession of all its flavors. You could drink a considerable amount before noticing."
"Nearly black pour. Pretty roasty in the nose, coffee, burnt toast. Tastes of the same, with maybe some slight dark chocolate and molasses. Enough hops to even it out. Another very good Scandanavian porter, albeit a little different. Alcohol of a standard porter, flavors of a Baltic."
"D: Very drinkable. I'm wondering how this qualifies as a Baltic, as it comes in at 5.5%? Either way, it is a very tasty porter. A nice reccomendation from the clerk at Four Firkins. I'll be searching this out again for sure!"
"taste is creamy, milk chocolate, coffee, and some roasted nuts, ends with just a touch of bitterness and a little dry."
"2006 vintage. nose could be stronger, but what is there is spot on. coffee, cocoa, vanilla laden caramel, hops and maybe a touch of tobacco. smoke? oak? dark fruit as well? in the finish for sure. extremely well balanced. medium body. lightly carbonated. very very food friendly. i would love to try a 10 year old bottle."
"More fullness is required in the end; for this style I would like a little more malt body and a more fleshed out beer in general. This is easy to drink in the sense that it's light bodied with some interesting flavors, but I'm ready for another beer and if I had any number of alternatives within this style I would take them."
"I wish I had more! This is an awesome Baltic Porter, and would definitely serve as a great introduction to the style if you can find it. Smooth drinking with some great flavors. Definitely worth tracking down."
"I am rating this beer very higly. It is easily one of the best porters I've ever had - in all five categories. Please, please pick this beer up and enjoy all of its subtleties slowly and fully"
"Mouthfeel is creamy and well textured with ample carbonation to aid the finish. Amazingly drinkable BP that I will be returning to."
"Overall, this was the most mellow Baltic Porter that I've tasted."
"D - In a style filled with high alcohol flavor bombs, this beer really stands out for it's mildness. The complexity is still impressive, with nice mild spice making this a very enjoyable after breakfast drink."
"Baltic porters are my favorite style, and this is really delicious as I would expect. Lighter than most types of this style, but its a nice change."
"Pours a one finger light tan head that fades slowly, leaving some lace. Totally black color. Light-medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Slight chocolate nose. Flavor is chocolate and roasted coffee, some bakers chocolate at finish. $4.20 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"D - Good but not balanced. Way too sweet."
"Another solid Baltic Porter from Sweden, not Eastern Europe as I had previously assumed. There's nothing that really stands out about this beer, but it's nice and flavorful. Also, when considering that it's only 5.5% alcohol, the amount of flavor is quite impressive. Recommended for fans of the style."
"Taste is robust and milky-sweet, with winey notes of espresso with gritty cocoa powder. Fruity flavors emerge as the drink warms, and are squashed by a gloriously dry roastiness and a solid bitter finish."
"this was a decent beer but not outstanding."
"D: Drinkability was simply beautiful, Did not want to sit my glass down for this one and was sad to see it go so quickly. Amazing and worthy of a high recommend."
"Overall - An incredibly well balanced and drinkable Porter but at £3.50 a bottle not something that i'd be buying all the time... definitely recommended though..."
"drinkability: Interesting beer but I find the flavors fatiguing. I can't imagine wanting more than one of these in a sitting. I would keep it to a rare diversion."
"Worth a try..."
"D: Very Drinkable."
"Pick this up if you find it."
"Good beer. I liked this."
"d= note: 2006 D. Carnegie & Co. stark porter was tahhhAaassstee and my reason for purchasing this 1997 bottle. Perhaps it is too old. Perhaps my taste buds are too young. Hate to say it, and with no disrespect to the Swedish brewers, this made it to Chesapeake Bay."
"Drinkability- The best Baltic porter I've had, and one of the best porters I've had all around."
"M&D: refreshing, with lovely creamy fizz soothing the palate; this Baltic Porter is the lowest-gravity one that I've tried, and yet it provides all the complexities and an even higher drinkability. A delicious, well-hopped, and well-made dark gem this is, really like a chocolate stout blended with a full-bodied and fruity Czech dark lager."
"Dry quaff works the above notes into the taste quite well. Just a small pop of chalkyness, and this processes a nice hop balance to qwell any cloying sweetness. Creamy like a milk stout, the 5 and a half % alcohol makes this close to a real session drinker."
"Note: 2004 vintage is still drinking great. Very lagery smooth, with wonderful flavor, I would give it A- or so. Awesome."
"pours a fairly opaque black/brown with a thin yet foamy mother of peral head. it smells like a malty wee heavy with some earthy notes. tastes like your staple porter but with a unique twist of cherries or grapes or prehaps even currents. it has the classic porter mouth-feel with a hopy finish, overall tasty. easy drinking porter, and will last this 06 vintage says best before 2016. for certin worth your time and cellar space."
"A thin black body boasts no head even with a very strong pour. I guess this might be expected from a beer that is 10 years old. The oldest vintage beer I've tried. Nose definetly shows its age with hints of ink, antique wood, leather, molases and slight smoke. Enter the mouth with notes that resemble thin port, oak barrels, chalkie malt and dry, mineral back bone. Hints of underlieing coco are there also. This beer really shows its maturity in its complexity. Mouthfeel is like drinking an antique store. Drinkable in a sippable way. Do seek out a vintage if you can find it."
"age nicely too. Recommended!"
"2004 vintage. This one poured a clear, very dark brown with purplish highlights and a dense, tan cap. Great head retention and the foam produced plenty of thick, clumpy lacing. A grainy malt and dry cocoa aroma hit my nose first, followed by a light roastiness, dates, and nuts. Very malty with a clean yeast character in the nose. Mild bitterness that sits just underneath the malt notes. Fairly sweet, very malty, with ripe fruit, prunes, and nuts filling out the middle. It finished with a bittersweet chocolate/cocoa flavour. Chewy, malty body with creamy carbonation. Very smooth with a refined texture. Great balance, seems a bit mellowed with some graceful aging. This is a superb baltic porter, highly recommended."
"Not really sure what to say about this one other than thumbs way up. A mysterious and subtle brew that is among the most interesting I've ever tried. I will be looking at my local stores for additional bottles of the 1997 vintage, and I will buy everything they have in stock."
"Upon its parole from the 500ml bottle 2006 vintage, the beer sets a deep brown to black with strong dark ruby highlights, the head is light chocolate brown, creamy in texture and piled high on the body, lace forms an obscuring sheet. Nose has a rich roasted grain aroma, sweet with a definite espresso tone, caramel, and a hint of semi-sweet chocolate, earthy. Start has a pleasing roasted grain presence, sweet, with a bit of bitterness at the back, light to moderate in feel. Finish has mild acidity, touch of hops, toasted grain semi-sweetness continues to the very aftertaste, quite nice actually, a pleasing beer, not to light, not to heavy."
"Very drinkable - hard to put down. Favor fades and begs for another sip. Great flavor and complexity paired with low abv leaving no fusel alcohol flavors. Thankfully this is only 5.5%, otherwise there could be trouble. Highly enjoyable."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, excellent representation of style, this is a nice beer to sit and relax with, but even though it is got a mild kick, it does not like a beer that I would want to drink a bunch of. Nonetheless, it is a very good beer overall."
"Pours black with a nice tan head. Aromas that are a small caramel sweetness. In the taste, a dry malt, with hints of chocolate and a nice coffee presence. A smooth, dry sticky mouthfeel and a dry malty aftertaste. Nice smoothness and flavor, a very enjoyable porter."
"D - A great beer, session strength, but still one of the top examples of the style. I consider it one of the best. More than 1 pint is not enough, a class act."
"2004 bottling. A brown and pretty beer. Opaque with a small, compact tan head. Smells of prunes, soy sauce, toffee, dark chocolate, cherries. Fruit odors are the most prominent, along with a rummy, scotch-like odor. Mmmm...yes, further evidence that baltic porters may be the most underappreciated of the top beer styles. This one is oaky and slightly burnt tasting, with lots of rum-like notes and a soft fruitiness. Burnt quality is maybe a bit too strong, turning the maltiness into more of a blackend coffee, but its still a great tasting beer. Too fizzy of a mouthfeel would be my only major complaint. Another great B.P. from Northern Europe!"
"Recommended. Maybe a different take on the Baltic Porter category, but quite a nice take on it."
"D: Not a bad beer although it doesn't fit the Baltic Porter category very well."
"Overall: Extremely enjoyable. I was expecting a dud. I was SO surprised by this one... I may have trouble waiting another year or two for the other bottles I have."
"Very low carbonation and a bit thin across the tongue - a bit surprisingly for how creamy it is. While I wouldn't have more than one very often, that one delicious bottle is extremely drinkable."
"This is a real easy drinking porter. I am surprise that I saw it in the reduce basket. I bought two of them so I will definitely enjoy the other one too."
"This was immensely enjoyable. I look forward to hunting it down again. [I'm assuming ""Argang 2004"" on the bottle means it was brewed in 2004. Best Before date is May 2014]"
"årgång 2006"
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and with a fairly smooth carbonation it has a pretty silky feel. The drinkability is really good, and add in the fact that, for a Baltic Porter the alcohol level is fairly low, I could easily enjoy a couple of these."
"D: Very easy to drink, flavors aren't conducive to lots of drinking but good for a bottle. Worth a try, a good Baltic Porter."
"A very dark brown beer with dark mahogony highlights. Has a nice creamy dark beige head. There is a light dark roasted malt aroma with hints og coffee and licorice in the background. The flavor is full of roasty malt goodness. A nutlike sweetness on the sides of the tongue with a soft coffee bitterness at the back of the throat. The smooth creamy texture of the mouthfeel really drives this great beer home."
"Overall, it definitely tastes old. It's very interesting how it developed, although there is definitely a stale bread flavor. It aged nicely and is very interesting to try, with very subdued, balanced and intriguing new flavors. Past its prime though. Still enjoyable."
"Bottle to tulip forms a three finger light brown head over very dark body, tinted w/ ruby hues. The head makes a rather speedy descent about half way, then slows to a fizzle where it's rocky and solid. Ends with a nice coat of lacing, a healthy halo, and lots of webbing along the glass. The smell is nice and roasty, some chocolate and plum, chalky and dry. Its only been an hour in the fridge, its smooth and only very slightly carbonated in the mouthfeel. Leaves a lingering roast flavor in the mouth while the forefront is a bit sour and fruity, plums and chocolate, just like the smell. Some maple syrup qualities as well. Really easy drinking, appreciate the low carbonation how the beer is still thick without a ton of bubbles."
"Overall a nice and flavorful porter. Not as dry as I would have hoped however."
"D: Quite good."
"The black/opaque color and light tan head make a great contrast with each other. Smells of smoky/roasted malts with a sweet banana flavor. The flavor is strong, yet mellow. The bitterness is a burnt one from the malts. Trace of chocolate. The beer sweetens as it warms up, adding a hinted fudge flavor. It was extremely smooth, probabaly from the aging, and was much too easy to consume. It's so easy, a caveman can do it. HA! HA! But seriously, try it out if you can get it."
"In the end this is a fairly tasty brew, but I don't see how this is going to last until 2010. It is probably already just past its peak, and I could see this starting to develop cardboard-like oxidation notes pretty soon."
"Pours a dark black color with a small fizzy head that quickly dissapears. The nose features molasses, chocolate, roasted coffee, and caramel. The taste features much of the same flavors as present in the nose. Overall, this is an extremely well balanced and highly drinkable porter that stands out as one of my favorites."
"Just when I think it's gonna pack an overwhelming punch, it disappears nicely. Good drinking brew, wish it were a bigger bottle."
"Drinkability of this beer was quite good. While some may be disappointed with this beer's lack of both alcohol strength (which tasted even lower than the 5.5% ABV) and hoppiness, this offering impresses with it rich, full flavors and overall balanced profile."
"Quite good, would certainly drink again. Nice balance between sweet & bitter."
"Poured a dark, cola brown. Had a moderate, brown head that lingered throughout and left tracings down the side of the glass. The flavor was pure coffee, with a slight, bitter aftertaste. Though porters are not my favorite style of beer, this was one that I'd drink again."
"This is a very well balanced beer that starts out sweet with roasted malt and raisin notes, but finishes dry. It has a fine carbonation and silky smoothness. In the end, there is a lingering tartness that might be compared with that of dark chocolate covered cherries. Very drinkable with just enough going on to keep you coming back for more."
"This is a pretty darn good stout, not amazing, but darn good. Personally, I like fuller, stronger flavored stouts and I found this one to be a little on the weak side of flavor. Chocolate and coffee flavors were definitely present, but just didn't present themselves as well as I would have liked. Presentation is great with a color and bottle that are both equally stout-like. The aroma wasn't strong enough to get through my slightly stuffy nose. This beer finishes extremely easy and leaves a relatively a clean palate. And like some have said, its very easy to drink."
"Pours dark brown close to black with a head that quickly dissipates. The smell is typical Baltic porter, if a little lighter than some. Winey, slightly malty with notes of stewed cherries and prunes. The taste is similar to the smell, with vinous notes, prunes, and quite a bit of creamy vanilla on the finish. The mouthfeel is medium weight but fairly creamy and with nicely restrained carbonation. Very nice example and nicely complex especially given the relatively low alcohol."
"This is another beer I always see sitting on the shelf, but am never too sure how long it's been there, so I tend to hold off. In this case however I figured it was a nice change of pace to have a strong Porter on a cold Winter night. It poured a nice dark brown, that was somewhat lighter when held up to the light. Smell was somewhat weak, but did have a nice milk chocolate nose. It was also pretty clean in the smell overall. Taste had lots of burnt coffee beans, bitter chocolate, and the aftertaste you get from a nice cigar. Mouthfeel was a notch above medium, and very nice on the palate. This ia a great beer. It would do well as a sipping beer or as a gulper. I personally found no problem in finishing the sample I had. A really well done effort for the Porter style. Usually I am let down by this style, but when it's right, it really hits the spot. Worth a shot for sure."
"From a half-liter bottle, ""argang 2004"" and best by May 2014. It pours with a deep black body, not too thick, and topped with an inch of dark khaki head. It is quite aromatic with roasted/toasted, chocolate, vinous, and sweet malts with notes of blackberry. The flavor adds to this notes of coffee, tobacco, anise, smoked malts, green apple or melon rind, a light lactic quality, and green hops that contribute a mild bitterness. The body is medium to light for such a dark brew, with medium carbonation and a medium finish. Overall a tasty Baltic porter that has a wonderful aroma."
"Roasted malt flavor lasts throughout with touches of coffee and chocolate but mostly just dry and tasty. Mouthfeel is relaxed and very smooth, almost silky. Very pleasing on a cold night and very old fashioned tasting as the label brags. I could very easily see making this a winter regular as it goes down very easy and doesn't kick at eight or nine percent like a lot of the newfangled BPs. Good stuff."
"D - A great easy drinking beer. I will have to find another one of these."
"Overall: First brewed in 1836, but it seems that at nearly ten years old this one tends to loose all conditioning and starts to thin out, though the complexity remains and the depth of taste still excites. Remains a high quality sipping Baltic Porter but I prefer this one a little younger."
"Drinkability: A little to osweet and one-dimensional for me. Lacking any memorable burnt/brown sugar and bitter/coffee characteristics that I normally associate with a great porter, and the candy sugar kick throws the taste out of balance. Having said that it was a good beer to drink while watching the snow come down."
"Drinks pretty easy, would a nice on to session on if it weren't so expensive. One kickass batlic porter"
"Worth seeking out for a special treat."
"Thank you to Chris at Ebenezer's Pub for getting me to try this. I probably never would have had this without his recommendation. It was a nice dark black with a thick coffee-colored head. A coffee, chocolate aroma. The taste only enhanced what I smelled, and this had to have been the smoothest porter I've ever tried. Indescribable, all those great dark tastes running around in my mouth. You gotta try this beer!"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Viscous but relatively light in the mouth, the smooth rise and fall is wonderfully complementary to the beer's texture. At 5.5%, it has subtleties and complexities that don't usually reveal themselves in a beer of this strength... and the European hop profile really seals the envelope in the superb finish. Fabulous beer, a gem worth seeking out."
"At just 5.5% abv I could drink these all night, and when a beer is this good, you don't mind spending $5.19 a bottle."
"Europeon Porters, IMO are much more complex then theri American counter-parts. Not as wild, or original, but but more solid. A good beer that comes in a bottle that is too small."
"I must say, I'm a little let down by this one. I had such high expectations for it, and I just don't think it delivered. It was quite tasy and smelled okay; it just wasn't the big, black, chocolate pudding beer I thought it was going to be. It poured a dark reddish brown colour through which light could pass. It had a sandy coloured foamy head that stayed around for ages and left thick lacing clinging to the sides of the glass. This was quite nice, but I would have liked it better were it darker still. The smell was roasted malts with a bit of a bitter coffee bean under tone, and a really faint chocolate aroma hidden deep down. I expected so much more in the smell. I expected the roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate, but at much higher levels. There was also a bit of a soured smell present here, as well, such as something you might expect to find with a lambic. Not as strong of course, but there, faintly, nevertheless. The taste was sweet roasted malts and a touch of caramel. Not the unmanageable semi-sweet chocolate and punch in the face coffee bean bitterness I was so hoping for. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, both for what I was expecting, and the style as a whole, I thought. Overall, this was a good porter. Not a fantastic porter, simply a good one. I was simply expecting so much more from this one, only to be dissappointed a bit. 3.5's across the board."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is a bit lighter than full bodied. The beer is lightly carbonated. The beer has a bit of buttery creamyness to the mouth. The beer never becomes cloyingly sweet. I would have liked this beer to be a bit thicker on the mouthfeel. The beer is a very drinkable malt bomb. I wish the cost of this was a bit cheaper because it would be a regular in my beer line up."
"Notes: I love porters and this one is at the top of my list. It doesn't get much better than this."
"Good beer. Probably even better fresh. If only they included a realistic dating system..."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: A big improvement over the first time. This is a really well balanced beer, with just enough to keep me interested over the long haul. Nice to see a brew with a lower ABV for lightweights like me, too. Now, if these only came in 6ers at a decent price..."
"This is a 2004 vintage. This beer pours a ink black with a large foamy head. The head of this beer leaves very nice lacing. The smell has a real wood smoke aroma that dominates ,but also has sweet roasted malt . The taste is crisp with a smokey flavor along with malt sweetness and coffee. The m/f is lighter than expected with the flavors coming together very nicely. A very good beer that should be had by all. Cheers."
"1997 vintage 8.82oz bottle 5.5% very dark very little head ,minimal carbonation.Tried this last night at a vintage beer tasting and found it to be one of my favorites.i found it to be very drinkable,sweet but not to sweet .chocolate coffee hints perhaps?maybe prunes or grapes?I would definatelytry this again if I had the opportunatey."
"The smooth, delicious, rich taste, along with a low abv for this style, makes this an enjoyably drinkable ""session"" Baltic Porter."
"An interesting great tasting brew. Complex and intricate. I liked mine extremely cold."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty light for such a dark beer. This would a new session beer if it was more readily available at some Illinois bars."
"It pours an extremely dark red until it settles into an inky black with red edges when held to the light. It has a tan head closer to white than brown. The consistency of the head was fantastic. It smelled malty sweet with not too many hop characteristics that I could gather. Overall, the aroma was pleasant but not outstanding. This beer is balanced towards the sweet side in terms of flavor. Obviously the hops are not that evident but I wished there was something else there to counteract the very sweet malty tones it was giving me. This was a very creamy beer and it sat very well on the side of my tongue as I swished it around. It left a fairly clean taste that I was very pleased with. I probably will not pick this beer up again. However, I know a couple people that would love this stuff so I have to skew drinkablity up."
"If it wasn't for the smell, this would be outstanding. I honestly held my breath for every sip, trying not to ruin the taste. The flavor is really good. And actually, after 15 minutes or so, the smell went away. One I'd have again. I'd just open it and let it breathe for a while."
"this beer is absolutely delicious and at 5.5% it's incredibly drinkable"
"One note on the vintage thing: I just had the 1997 vintage a few weeks ago. It had aged wonderfully -- in spite of the absence of bottle conditioning and a relatively low alcohol content, this beer at 7+ years old was huge, with a much more complex flavor than the 2004 vintage. Over time, some great date flavors came out in the beer, as well as some nicely sweet, cake-like flavors. Anyway, a few people on here have noted seeing some 1997s around as remainders and such. If you see the 1997, BUY IT. As long as it's been cared for between then and now, you're in for some serious goodness."
"Dark brown with a thin head. Smells of chocolate and mildly of molasses. Lightly roasted with sweet malt and more molasses and chocolate. Very mild, but also very compelling. You just want another sip. It almost has a Baltic Porter taste profile, but none of the BP alcohol."
"2004 Vintage, purchased at A Southern Season. Pours a dark brown with amber highlights, topped by a creamy tan head that has some staying power. Aroma of toasted malt with a slight metallic tinge. The malt comes through rather roasty on the palate, with a bit of a nutty character peeking through. Very light notes of milk chocolate and oats. Body is kind of thin for a porter. Goes down easy, though, I will say that. Not a particularly remarkable beer."
"It tastes just really balanced. Sweet creamy mouthfeel mixed with the bitterness of the coffee and roasted malt. A nice hop flavor lingers and there's good hint of the hop bitterness peaking through as well. The carbonation is mild and feels just right. I drank the 25 oz never feeling like it was at all too much. Goes really well with a nice dark chocolate as well. I was expecting this to be a good beer, but it goes beyond that. It doesn't amazing strong flavors but it just works."
"Nice and easy to drink baltic porter. Has aged nicely. Very enjoyable."
"Absurdly small 8.3 ounce bottle. Carnegie porter pours out a black topped with an oily film. Big malty aroma that can be smelled from several feet away. Lots of cookie dough in the aroma, with some cocoa. Roasted malt flavor, followed by sweet dough, like that of a dopplebock. This beer actually makes me think of a stout crossed with a dopplebock. Very little hop flavor. Mouthfeel is a tad watery. This beer left me craving another, but then again it was only an 8.3 ounce bottle."
"Mouthfeel is great. Perfect. The drinkability of this beer is fantastic. I could see the third being just as good as the first."
"The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin and watery side, which does not detract from the enjoyability of beverage but merely serves to make it more easily drinkable. It's a sure winner in that department. I am somewhat curious as to how this beer got the classification of a baltic porter (other than the geography, obviously) since this seems to be more of a mild English porter more than anything. I am not a stickler for style guidelines however, as long as your stout doesn't taste like a pale, for instance. This is definitely a good beer whatever you call it."
"A tasty drinkable beer here, too bad it is $5 a bottle. Full flavored Baltic porter that I can recommend."
"I think ""Årgång 1997"" means that this is from 1997--that can't have helped."
"Drinakability likewise is very good. I just wish it was less expensive, and that it wasn't retired. Oh well, it is still going down well tonight."
"Dark brown. Aromas of molten red clay, coffee, chocolate, nut paste and poppy. Drinkable, even texture. Sweet coffee liquor rushes the doughy mousse. Very neat and perfect proportioned. Highly drinkable. Perfect with butter drenched prawns, crab or rare grass fed filet, Irish style."
"Final whine: Retired? Whaaahhh!"
"Edit Feb 2007: Had another bottle of the 2004 and I stand by my original scores. Its just OK fresh or with age. A bit of a cola feel starts to creep in as it gets older and not a bad thing really as this needs a bit more depth."
"1997 vintage poured from the bottle. Very little carbonation, coffee like darkness. Aroma was sweet, chocolately. Taste wasn't quite what I was expecting, but excellent nonetheless. We're talking Frappucino type cafe mocha coffee/chocolate creaminess. Unlike almost anything I'd had in a beer. Sweet but not too sweet, lack of intense carbonation I'm sure helped. Very nice to savor in your mouth for a second. Nice complex notes of vanilla as well. Very very smooth and drinkable.... you could slug down the entire 9oz bottle and not even flinch, but what fun would that be?"
"Pours a deep brown to black color with no head over top. Not even a puff when the cap was popped. The nose is light fig, and soy sauce. A very nice combination. I'd like a little more force in there, but I can live with it. The flavor is nice. Mellowed chocolate covered fig, touched with a soy, but not biting, flavor. Almost a light smokeyness in there as well. No hint of oxidation. Incredibly tasty. The feel is a light moderate, with no carbonation. Overall, an incredibly drinkable brew. Easily a session beer for me. I'm sad this is the only one I have."
"1997 Vintage. Pours a very dark color with no head and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma has the character of a very sweet raisin with possibly some other fruits in there and a hint of soy sauce. The flavor has a lot of chocolate in it that sticks around, but it also has some dark fruit character and some other dark malts. It's dark tasty for an eight year old beer. Not much in the way of roastiness. Mouthfeel is kind of thin, but again, it's really old. The drinkability is really good."
"The mouthfeel is good. Medium carbonation and medium body. This is a very drinkable beer. I like it alot and will probably be going back to the store to pick up a few more of these. It is kind of pricey considering that the bottles are only 8.82 fl. oz. None the less I highly recommend trying this one."
"It seems to have a bit less fruit than younger bottles I have had. The coffee/espresso contribution seems to diminish as well. Still a great beer, and beautifully put together. Enjoyed for it's earthier character."
"Drinkability is good a nice porter. A bit pricey for what it is but still nice."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Best before April 2010 (April 2010...5 years and I certainly did not purchase this yesterday! Perhaps if I had it would have been better, or perhaps I should have waited till 2010!)"
"Pours an opaque black, with a thick tan head that retains nicely, a fine looking porter. Smell is an intriguing mix of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt and a smokiness thats hard to place. Taste had coffee flavors along with a sweet chocolate malt taste and and a smokey roasted flavor that is mild but noticeable. The finish is pleasantly dry and bitter, a nice crisp finish to a flavorful porter. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth but the carbonation is moderate and adds a nice crispness to the beer. Overall an excellent porter, this is my first baltic porter and im looking forward to trying some more."
"as the beer goes.... eases up a little bit. a slight sweetness creeps in, maybe figs or bittersweet chocolate. frankly I think this beer might need another two years to mature and even out a bit. a little less carbonation and a little smoother finish might help it out. that said, it's really a quite good experience. there aren't a lot of great porters out there -- or at least that are accessible -- but i think it's one of the better ones. that said, i'll still take the sinebrychoff over this one. that beer leaves you with a little more at the end of the night, whereas this is a great one to sit in front of the fireplace on a rainy evening and enjoy. hope to find more in the future..."
"2004 vintage-Pours a deep,deep ruby brown-borders on black but theres some great ruby highlights visible when held to the light. No real head to speak of. Low aroma-some roasted malt and a low level of yeastiness. Great big malty flavor-not overly astringent as some porters can be. Nice blend of chocolate and roasted malt. Mild bitterness. Lingering sweetness-somewhat trecle like in the finish. Wonderful body. An excellent beer and an even better porter-Baltic or otherwise. Very well balanced and rounded. At $5 a bottle I would like to see this in an affordable 6 or 4 pack. This could become a common occurance!"
"I think this one might be past prime."
"Light-medium bodied, but seems light for a porter.. lots of carbonation grabs the tongue. I like a porter that shows this much carbonation, but it is really strong this time around. Medium rich malt flavor, but not smokey or toasty.. kind of plain in that regard. As far as the hops, it's vaguely hoppy. Not foward like an American porter and not as subtle as a British.. Eh.. it is highly drinkable though."
"Undeniably, D. Carnegies porter is top shelf."
"2004 vintage. Color is pitch black with a large, tan head. The aroma is rather light and has an earthy malt smell. The taste of of earthy malts with a roasted edge. Coffee and chocolate are noted. Finish is sweet and stays with you. A nice hop body provides complexity and balance. Very good porter here, definently would like this one in my fridge again."
"Picked up a 1997 bottle from Archer's Ale House in Bellingham. The beer was black as black with minimal head. The nose was winy and old fruity. The taste was aged and vinous with the burnt malts in the background. I felt that this bottle was maybe too old as the midbody seemed slightly hollow. I know that this beer can be cellared eventhough it is only 5.5% but I feel the low abv may have let some of the bigger flavours dissipate. I enjoyed this beer but wanted a bigger set of flavours."
"Pours a deep brown almost black with some ruby highlights with a creamy-like off -white head,aromas of chocolate xhip cookie dough and dark roast coffee really made me want to tear into this offering.Flavors as expected were malt dominated some dark roast coffee and bittersweet chocolate along with some raisin.Deeply flavorful and a nice creamy mouthfeel makes this porter one of the better I have had in quite awhile,I think my first Swedish beer that I have had."
"Drinkability- Not bad, but definitely not worth the $4.95 I paid for this not even 9oz of liquid. Worth a try if you can find it for cheaper, but still not a great baltic IMO."
"1997 edition. A very smooth porter, with some sourness. Very Black and very roasty and other herbs, including fennel aroma and possibly peppermint is very attractive. Chocolate malts Wee small bottle goes pretty quickly. Encourages trying other Swedish brews."
"D.C. & C. SP is good beer, but it falls well short of the Perkuno's Hammers and Sinebrychoffs of the world. My penchant for more full-bodied beer means that I love the Baltic porter style. It also means that my praise of this one is something less than full-throated."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome! It has a very powerful and rich black malt aroma that is sweet and slightly coffeelike. It is creamy and highly complex. The taste is great. It has a creamy chocolate/coffee flavor that is rich and smooth finishing. It seems high in alcohol, but the label says it's only 5.5%. It has a slightly bitter hop flavor as well. This is a very well balanced porter. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a terrific brew. It is so rich in black malts. It's a very smooth drinking porter."
"This is a little too sweet for my taste, even though I can appreciate the complexity of the beer."
"All in all, it's a great beer, but not one of the best Baltic Porters I've had."
"Overall this is a decent beer. There are other porters out there which are stronger in flavor. If they could kick the flavor up a bit and keep the mouthfeel the same then I think I would like this one even more. Is it worth the price tag? It depends"
"This is a great porter. I just wish it was available here. Thanks for the bottle, Rob!"
"Pours thick and utterly black. Almost no head or carboation at all. Heady aroma of chocolate, molassess, plum and tobacco. Oddly, this beer looks and smells like it would feel a lot thicker than it actually does in the mouth. It's not thin, mind you, but can be deceptive especially given the Imperial-stoutish character of its appearance and aroma. The flavor, though, is quite rich. Chocolatey sweet with dark fruits at first, followed by roasty, roasty malts that linger well into the aftertaste. This isn't a stout. And it's refreshing that it doesn't pretend to be one. It is, however, a nicely robust porter."
"An impressive beer, and one that has certainly held up well. I wish I could see what this one is like when fresh..."
"this bottle says 1998. pours a dark dark brown with no head and no lacing. almost looks like flat coke. the smell is great though malt and some chocolate. taste is the same as the smell with the malt lingering in the aftertaste. mouthfeel is somewhat thick and feels really smooth almost like milk or something. i'd probably drink some more if i had it, but if i had something else better, i'd take that. a pretty good brew overall."
"Bender Factor: This was a once in a lifetime. For $4.20, no. I was expecting someting better. Not to say that this was shyte, just didnt meet my 4 dollar expectations. Regarless, solid brew. Worth seeking out the newer, less expensive years."
"Great stuff, that makes me a little proud as a Swede."
"good though, recommended."
"Aroma is chocolate and caramel with a light pine hop scent surprisingly coming through. SMooth creamy texture and average body are present in this brew. Very light and gentle carbonation, almost non-existent. Flavor is chocolate and roasted malts with some brown sugar sweetness appearing. the beer is silky smooth and very easy to drink. Not sure about other years, but this one is quite tasty. try this year 1997 or others."
"oh my god, that's beautiful. Melted bittersweet Callebaut chocolate with bubbles. A little prune syrup, a bit oily like blackstrap molasses. Leaves a puff of deisel smoke as it departs. A very economical beverage. Meaning it's not so layered, or thick and fruity, or hopped up that it jumps all over the palate as if it were a trampoline. This beer is smooth with a smoky bite, with easy barley fruitiness, balanced alcohol and carbonation that reminds me of the difference in ride between my HONDA civic and a towncar. Many beers are variations of a civic: Good rides with personal embellishments that make the civic unique. This Baltic porter gives a ride like a towncar, smooth. Loved it, and could drink buckets of it."
"Notes: This is my first baltic porter and I like. Very taste and drinkable."
"Easy drinking, low ABV beer which would be excellent for the months ahead. A good beer. Only one I had though. I'll have to replenish my supply."
"This guy poured a very deep black that you would expect to see with a stout. There was a very small head, even when trying to build a big one with a vigorous pour. The little head that there was quickly left the building. The smell was of a caramel/roasty/nutty mixture that was very interesting and exciting. The taste had a very cabonated twang to it that never went away, however underneath that was a very complex carmel, molasses nutty mixture that was very nice and unexpected along with a thick molasses like mouthfeel, I also figure that there was some lactose in there as well. I wish I knew what the rest of the label says. I would drink seveal of these on a nice cool evening."
"This beer sort of reminds me of the classic bottled Guinness, circa 1994, before pasteurization (or at least when their was a nice sourness, and hoppier character to it). The difference, however, is that this Stark-Porter is a stronger brew, and would probably hold up well over many years."
"complex aromas but I can pick out sweet milk with a earthy peated character and some chocolate. very smooth and rich mouthfeel when tasted cold but thins up a bit when it warms up. very balanced in it's flavors, it has a black malty bitterness that in the aftertaste. a very well brewed easily drinkable example."
"Notes: Sadly, this is no longer brewed and I raise my empty pint glass to AKSmokedPorter for supplying me with this gem. I would love to get me mitts on a few more of these. Well-done."
"I have tried over 500 commercial beers and this is my all time favorite"
"I found more! A 2004 vintage. The appearance score drops slightly due to minimal head retention but the taste and smell increase due to finding the previously sought smoke character which was all over the nose, mouth and aftertaste that just lingered forever (with vanilla) at the back of the throat. Buy it, drink it, want more."
"Excellent beer and supreme drinkability!"
"This is slick and the super fine bubbles make this a masterpiece."
"Well, I don't know if I'd consider this a Baltic porter, but it is solid. Though the mouthfeel is a tad thin, the flavor is quite good, with a rich chocolate to it. Quite good, and I'd love to try some of the other vintages."
"Body was too thin, it should have been fuller for a Baltic Porter."
"Had a perfectly treated and conditioned bottle. This was yummy. The conditioning of this beer is outstanding. Smooth Chocolate/Coffee malt flavor. Hops have been reduced to the background (through conditioning). Aroma has that beautiful, fruity, toffee, oxidized note that makes every sip enjoyable. This beer stands out and is worth seeking. I must warn everyone about mistreated bottles, though..."
"This beer poured a deep amber, almost black color and formed a nice light tan bubbly head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, coffee, and caramel. A flavor of malt, coffee and a touch of chocolate. The body was fairly light for the style and the finish was slightly bitter. Not a bad porter for the style."
"Drinkability is very high. Probably defines the style as well as any beer."
"overall- a nice porter that goes down well. Simple review- beer wasn't too complex."
"As pointed out at the event, the beer is only 5.5% abv, but has a ""best before"" date of April 2010. Can a beer such as this age well? For so long? Only one way to find out..."
"2001 vintage with ""best before 2010"" on label. Pours an opaque, almost pitch black with a tan head that quickly drops into patchy and collar lacing. Aroma of burnt coffee, smoke, licorice, and a hint of chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, and has a mild peppery bite. Taste is similar to the nose, with burnt coffee, smokiness, licorice, and spicy, dry, bittering hops. Very drinkable, and a nice Porter, but nothing outstanding at this stage. I was surprised by the ""best before"" date being a several years down the road. This one will probably be much better in a couple of years."
"Comments  I had the 2001 vintage. Even though it is going on three years old I would recommend cellaring this for another three. Im not a big cellaring fan but I think the flavors here just need some more time to get to know each other."
"The body is very dark reddish-brown with a head that starts to fizz but stops before dissipating, which it does, eventually. The aroma is light, mostly a bit of chocolate. The flavor is vinuous, a bit of raisin and chocolate followed by a faint bit of char."
"This is an amazing porter, besting many stouts. Very pleasantly surprised by this, and I would highly recommend it to my porter loving friends. The drinkability is amazing. I could easily put away 3 of these 17 oz bottles back without noticing. Complex, yet extremely satisfying without fatigue on the tastebuds. My last gulp was as good or better than the last. Wow."
"The flavor starts with a good malt chew before being chased off by a blackstrap molasses and a spicy hop zing that lets the finish ride with a long coffee bite that lingers"
"2001 vintage, best by April 2010. Cost me like $5 at my local store...way overpriced, I know. Anyway this was a nice strong porter. It poured a deep black colour with a tan/beige head of foam. The aromas were all deep roasted chocolate and caramel malts with some lovely citric hops in the background and on the finish. The taste was similar to the aromas with some lovely roasted malts and hops blending together for a nice chocolatey/caramely taste of wonder. The mouthfeel was creamy, thick, and almost ""chewy"" and the drinkability is damn good as well!"
"paid $1.99 for a 16.9oz bottle."
"Drinkability: Why can't the Swedish bikini team shill for this? Man, they had to stop making this stuff after I got hooked. And I snagged the last bottle in this area that I know of. Oh, cruel fate! *sniff* Anyways, enough ranting. This is a superb Baltic, I'd even hazard to say a benchmark for the style. Perfect for a crisp, late fall day like I just had."
"2001 Vintage. Black with some ruby tinge. Of the Baltic porters I've had so far, this is both the lightest flavored and lowest abv. Some very mild oxidation flavor present in the first few sips, but after the beer warmed it faded, or I just got used to it. Sharply sweet candy-ish aroma, almost surprising when the beer does not turn out to be particularly sweet in flavor. Carmelized fig and prune flavors, but in moderation. Finishes with a bit a acidity that cleans up nicely and leaves a pleasant sour bitterness at the roof of the mouth. Not really a fireside sipper like other Baltics, but overall more drinkable than its bretheren."
" Mouth is lightly carbonated, but full, round and chewy. Fades fast on the palate, makes me want another. Drinkability is high, could I have another (or 3) hell yeah. This is one fine brew, really a great porter, I love this stuff."
"Had this last night at the Viking. 2001 vintage. Poured an inky black, with a head somewhere between tan and mud-color. Rich odor, I got elements of chocolate, rich, roasted black coffee, dark fruits, and a beguiling smokiness. The taste was exquisite, silky smooth. Velvety chocolate and premium coffee, wrapped in a thin sheen of smoked malt. Truly a pleasure to drink. If this being axed, as I've heard other BAs say, I'm going to buy up as many of these as my resources will allow."
"Notes: Amazing flavor profile ... and at 5.5% ABV; not quite as tasty as my beloved Okocim, but not dramatically far off either; stellar beer."
"pours out a nearly opaque, dark crimson colour. thin wispy head and slight wisps of lace. sweet sugary aroma...raisins and molasses come to mind...hints of chocolate and caramel. upon first taste, the first thing to hit me was the extremely silky smooth and velvety mouthfeel...leading to swirling flavours of semi-sweet chocolate and slightly bitter espresso. a magnificent combination. a sweet but dry finish; lingering bitterness on the tongue. supremely drinkable and down right delicious. one of the best beers i have ever had the pleasure of drinking. i will be getting a stash of these for sure! excellent tonic for a blustery and cold day in north dakota/northern minnesota."
"This porter is brownish black, but remarkably light in body. I think that if I had another bottle, that I would lay it down for a couple of years. It's not in it's prime yet. I think it has a lot of potential for aging"
"found a few of the 1997 batch at my local store, so i picked one up and was not dissapointed. knew this one would be good from the get go. poured a deep brown, almost black. a nice head developed and moderately faded into a lasting lace. smells of sweetness dominated with hints of coffee and earthiness as well. while not as sweet as the smell, tastes included chocolate and caramel along with the afforementioned coffee. minimal carbonation here, which i enjoyed. a highly drinkable porter. perhaps even for those who may not enjoy heavier beers, as there's a bit of lightness to it as well. this was a very, very smooth brew that was enjoyable for every last sip. hopefully i can find a few more bottles. the swedes have themself a winner."
"This was a very sweet tasting porter. Lots of malts seem to be involved in the making of this. Chocolate malt is dominate. A creamy vanilla flavor ensues. After that I can't tell but there are more flavors, sweet ones. Roasted grains and roasted coffee hit me towards the finish. That balances the beer out and makes me want more. I really liked this one."
"WOW! I hate to be trite, but WOW! This is an excellent porter! When I arrived at my usual spot this evening I was enticed into this by my publican. I was a bit skeptical at first, because he described it as 'tangy'. As I take my first sip, I am forced to agree, but not to the extreme I was expecting. This porter starts and ends on the sweet side and does have a very uniqe and very subtle sweet/sour characteristic--hence the 'tang'. I was befuddled to hear that this was only 5.5%, it has far more character than would be expected from such a low ABV beer (rates RIGHT up there with Stepin Razin, although a little sweeter and thus, different) I recommend letting this beer warm up a bit before imbibing, it is far more balanced when warmer."
"Oh yeah! A small head with medium to fine light brown bubbles that quickly fades away. A deep brown color almost black body. It has a very heavy aroma full of hops. Low carbonation with heavy flavor and coffee taste typical of a good dark porter. I found myself taking several sips to make my taste calls. It has a typical dark flavor with no aftertaste. The head is gone now as I complete this report. A very nice brew."
"Wish it wasnt so expensive. Also hard to believe you can age it even more because it was not terribly exciting but definitely better than average. Very easy to drink and drink much of."
"Thanks again FM!"
"It's very dark, close to opaque with ruby highlights. A large fluffy tan head forms and then reduces to a small ring pretty quickly. I can't get a strong aroma out of it, just some chocolate and coffee. But drinking this is miles better than smelling. Strong roasted coffee comes through first, some dark fruits, alcohol warmth, and then slightly bitter bakers chocolate through the finish and aftertaste. It's thick, creamy, rich, and robust. It's only 5.5% ABV but the alcohol adds a certain character that kind of tricks you into thinking it's stronger. A kick ass porter from Sweden to say the least."
"The bottom line is that this is one very good beer."
"2001 cintage. Pours a thick dark brown with red-amber hues on the edge of the glass. Has the smell of roasted malts and molasses. This is probably the third bottle of this vintage that I've had in as many months, and I've loved it every time. The taste is a smooth roasted malt with a balanced hop finish fading to a coffee-like aftertaste. This beer is a sipper that I could drink morning, noon, and night."
"The taste is complex, roasted malts, vinous peaks and valleys, and a slight tang. Ages well as the flavors seem to have both ripened and mellowed over time. Very easy to drink as well. A beer to be savored and enjoyed whilst dreaming of the finer things in life."
"Topping out the roasty and ripe fruit flavors is a hint of mint and a slight medicinal taste. The mouthfeel is nice and chunky. The drinkability is good for the style; even so, it's not the type of beer you'll want to devote an entire night to drinking. I'm not sure exactly what it is about this beer, but it gave me an overwhelming urge go grab a sledgehammer out of the garage and starting smashing shit. I'm going to start looking for other vintages. Skol."
"Pours black with ruby highlights. It forms a thick, light brown head with excellent lacing. The aroma is roasty and chocolatey. It has a deep roasted malt flavor. It is expresso-like in flavor also. It is a full-bodied beer, which has a somewhat creamy texture. It was a very tasty porter; I would definitely sample this one again."
"2001. Pours a very deep mahogany brown with a reddish cast when held to the light; but appears black in the glass beneath a creamy light-tan head. The head holds fairly well at first but soon dissipates to just a thin collar and some whispy surface foam.The nose expresses a sweet vanilla-laced caramel maltiness and some light, yeasty fruitiness. The body is medium; and it combines with a fine, moderate carbonation to leave it creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor is bold; and displays a vanilla/butter/caramel maltiness up-front, and a bit of chocolate towards the swallow along with some earthy/herbal hop flavors and a dull bitterness. It finishes bready with some residual sugary maltiness (molasses, brown sugar, light milk chocolate) and a drying bitterness. Quite exceptional! A classic Baltic porter that's well worth trying."
"This oddly named Swedish Export is a very interesting Baltic-style Porter. Black Coffee in color with a heavy to medium malty body. The hop content is fairly high, possessing a raw hop bite. Dry and crisp and lightly smoky with a hint of caramel sweetness. Pleasing hop and lightly smoky aroma. This is a well-made, easy to drink porter with a nice beige head...speaking of which, Id like to experience this dark Swede with a Swedish blonde on a cold winters eve!"
"Truly devilish."
"Drinkability: Give me a newer bottle with all of it's full carbonation and I could drink this all night. This is a fantastic porter, but not so complex as to limit the drinker to one or two."
"Quote from the back label: ""Carnegie Porter was created in 1836 and the taste is the same today"" Anyone happen to have a 1836 vintage? ;))"
"Color is DARK brown almost black. Head was a nice tan but dissapeared quickly. Smelled a little coffe flavor but it was too metallic to give it a higher rating. The taset was great. There wasn't much of the metal flavor. It is a nicely blended porter. Not too coffee like, but just enough. It had a smooth slightly thick feel. Definately a good porter. Definately worth getting again."
"Not my favorite porter and perhaps just a shade or two light, but overall a very nice beer to enjoy. Not easy to find from what I understand, but clearly worth the effort."
"Damn! This beer totally rocks! The dude from the Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg told me that this beer is one of his best Porters, so I took his advice and gave it a shot. I had high expectations for it, and it totally blew those out of the water. This beer has a nice thick malty taste to it and finishes off with a chocolate flavor. Even my girlfriend, who loves to drink Natty(don't worry, I am working on her), totally digged this stuff. I totally recommend this beer to anyone who is looking for a change for the better."
"Very malty on the palate. Lots of licorice again, but nice acidity and bitterness add complexity and keep the residual sweetness from becoming cloying. An interesting take on a Porter."
"A definitive ebony hue. Good, crackling tan head. As Fred Eckhart recommends, put this one to your ear and listen! Aroma is a blast of espresso, cocoa, anise and molasses. Rich and roasted, with loads of bitterness on the palate and a tenacious finish. Complex, if a bit gritty. Not a brew for novices or girly-men, this is stiff and substantial stuff. Label says best before August 2O1O, but who could wait that long? Unfortunately, the brewery has become bereft of their senses and is discontinuing this classic, so grab one if you can."
"2001: Pours a nice dark ruby color with chocolate overtones with a smooth, tan head leaving behind a lacy cling.  A whiff from the glass reveals big sweet, malty, dark fruity, raisin aromas. Big sweet malt flavor with a slight metallic twinge, some alcohol warming, medium fruitiness like plums or raisins, and a mild roasted malt contribution.  A dry hops finish with some grain astringency keeps this beer under control.  It has a smooth, medium-heavy body with medium carbonation, but has an almost syrupy consistency.  This is a super malty porter... I didn't know they could be like this.  Almost reminded me of some doppelbocks, but with some roast character added."
"Hearty bodied beer, nice example of a heavy porter. Good use of dark malts. Charcoal burn grain flavor is present but very well intermingled with other tastes such as coffee and dark chocolate. Hops bitterness works closely with grain bitterness to keep beer from tasting sweet. Very smooth, creamy beer. Carbonation kept light so that it doesn't take attention away from this robust beer."
"D. Carnegie & Co. Stark Porter 2001 from Sweden: In a big 16.9 oz. Bottle.  The label says that the best by date is April of 2010!  This is clearly a beer made for cellaring, but I have no time to lose.  This beer pours an inky black with ruby tints.  Thick full head, with Belgian lace all the way down. Clean light aroma, vaguely like a good Columbian coffee.  Creamy mouthfeel, with some carbonation.  Initial taste is licorice, which leads to a dark rye/ pumpernickel, and molasses.  Very well done, with several layers of tastes.  Excellent."
"2001: This beer is a very dark ruby.  Thin beige head disintegrates to nothing quickly.  A coffee scent dominates with hints of mocha as well on the nose.  Nice velvet like feel on the tongue.  Smooth tastes of chocolate, cocoa and java.  Very smooth porter.  Very easy drinking.  A nice faint bitterness.  A solid porter in my book."
"And that's an only one Swedish porter I ever drank... Good beer."
"1997: Nearly jet black with a very thin bubbly lace that keeps on coming back after each sip. Smell of dark bread similar to pumpernickel, good amount of sweetness in the nose to soften the roasted aroma. Mild charcoal with woody and bready flavours that want to come in at the same time, very low carbonation that lets the creaminess flow first then a quick yet small smoothness rolls in. Vague acidic twang that is very passive, malt flavours pass back and forth between roasted and bready. Hops are but a dream and seem to be the most faded trait this brew has, thankfully the roasted grain picks up a little of the slack. Hard to tell this brew is on it fifth year, malt is still very fresh on the palate."
"1998: The head formation is poor, and a only a thin rim of bubbles coats the inside of the glass.  Like many porters, a deep garnet hue is noticeable when held up to light.  The slightly sweetish, dark caramel malt and mocha - like chocolate malt is quite pleasant, but could be more assertive.  Fairly thinly bodied for a porter, and there is nothing outstanding in the malt profile. A fairly one dimensional black patent and chocolate malt bitterness dominates the flavor, thus making this beer a bit unexciting. Hop bitterness has faded and is lost amongst the roasted grain bitterness. The finish is quite dry and too clean. Perhaps this beer has aged poorly, since the complex malt and hop character that comprises a good porter was sorely lacking in this brew.  Nothing ventured nothing gained, I guess."
"(Argang 2000) Wow! This stuff is great! Starts by pouring a very dark black, with a very yummy looking dark tan head. The head sticks around for a good time also, the body is a medium to light- heavy with a very nice smooth mouthfeel. Very nice robust coffee notes and light caramel flavor, with just enough sweetness ( not over done ) to really enjoy this brew! This stuff is great to the last drop! Ends with a nice long finish!Overall a excellent Porter! I need more!"
"1998: A good porter, but perhaps a little sweet or something, still i can't believe Pripps brew this, that brewery really sucks."
"1998: baltic porters are a style all their own.this one is one of the finest.try saving a bottle or two for acouple of years. they age beautifully."
"Notes: This vintage has probably reached its peak, though I'd be interested in tasting it again in a few years. It's an amazing example of the style and ripe for the tasting. I implore everyone to try this magnificent Swedish beer."
