"This has the lacing and body of an RIS. There are actually some RISs that could learn from this. Very roasty and malty, with a somewhat sweet and bitter finish. This is an impressive porter."

"It's a pretty standard porter."

"Impressively strong roasted malt flavor with a noticeable level of bitterness, and accompanied by moderate sweetness and a slight sour note mixed in."

"330 ml bottle into snifter, best before 11/4/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense brown head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, prune, fig, licorice, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, prune, fig, licorice, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, prune, fig, licorice, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, balance, and robustness of dark/roasted malt and dark fruit flavors; with a nice roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible Baltic porter. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O: Got this one at Grapevine in Lakeland, FL. A sign said it’s a Baltic Porter from Finland, so it got me interested as I’ve only had a few in this style, and perhaps its my first from this country. Not the best I've had of the style, but glad to have found it, especially one from so close to the Baltic. . Drank in Pensacola, FL July 24, 2014."

"I could see some lees at the bottom of the bottle so I was gentle in my pour. OMFG, it pours like heavy-weight motor oil! No head and just wisps as a result. Color was deep-brown (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. I put my snout into the glass and inhaled and was met by an unparalleled booziness. I was transported back to the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern, while Stosh was still alive and in ownership. We would drink Baltic Porters and smoke dark cigars, like Parodis and maduros and shoot the shit, a publican and a barfly. Back to the present. I took another sniff and got Dark Chocolate pudding. I was reminded of Vanilla Snak Paks the other day and this was reminiscent of Dark Chocolate Snak Paks. I got a little in my mouth and it was exactly like pudding! It was thick, viscous, kind of sweet, and definitely full of fusel alcohol heat! I may need to lay down after this one. Carbonation was so low as to be almost non-existent. Warming, I began to note charcoal smoke, anise, dark chocolate, tar and still, the unrelenting heat. Phew! This was no playing around. I am sure that it is much more appropriate during the Winter months, especially up in Finland, but I just did not feel like waiting that long. Haluan vierailee Suomessa ja mene jääkiekko peli! This Finnish beer was fin(n)ishing me and it was only the middle of the afternoon! The Finnish fin(n)ish was dry. Duh! I felt like I had been caught in the solar plexus. My breath was taken. This was a big, brawling monster which was determined to send me back to my corner to throw in the towel. I am too stupid to lie down, though, which is how I won many of my fights in the Navy. I would be half dead, but by outlasting my opponent, I would win on points. You don't think that I became this good looking naturally, do you? I reloaded and raised a toast in a northeasterly direction, towards this beast's country of origin. I was rendered nearly insensate and I suddenly remembered Nietzsche's warning that ""when you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you."" I was engaged in advanced navel gazing at this point. Tentacles began to come forth from my navel and I shook hands before wrestling with them, finally resorting to knives to cut them from whence they came. Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him? Yaaah! I called my mouthpiece for his learned advice at this point and he advised me to drink more of the same. I love having Jimmy Keaveney on retainer. Suddenly, my glass was empty, no longer marked ""Drink me!"" and I was back in my bed with Auntie Em looking down at me, asking why I was wearing a gingham dress and ruby slippers while now sporting a long beard. Say, how long was I with this one?!? Where did I go? This is not my beautiful wife! Well, how did I get here?!?"

"Anyone who tells you that Sinebrychoff Porter is the world's greatest Baltic Porter isn't lying. Don't get me wrong - there's plenty of incredible renditions of the style out there, but they're all directly or indirectly modeled after this one. Each and every occasion I drink it becomes a ""where were you when"" kind of memory - it remains truly special stuff even if, as mentioned, more breweries now offer similar offerings. Dating back all the way to 1957, this is still the benchmark."

"Poured into porter glass. It is very dark black with a caramel-colored head. Didn't leave much lace as I drank it. Aroma was roasted (burnt) coffee and a mild sweetness. My wife and I couldn't call the sweetness out by name until the next morning. I took a whiff of the warm remnants left in the glass and immediately picked up on raisins or prunes. Taste had average porter bitterness. Viscosity was above average and higher alcohol was apparent. Decent aftertaste. I think I actually served it too cold at first (maybe 40 deg or so). As it warmed, I really enjoyed it more."

"O: Somehow I just didn't care for it the way the majority seems to. I thought it tasted mostly coffee-ish, except for an unavoidable sense of throw-up, which was obviously off-putting."
"Pours a solid black color with a smallish tan head that dissipates to a small cap. The aroma is heavy with charred wood, and vinous oxidation, supported by dark fruits, smoke and dark chocolate. Little to no hop aroma or alcohol presence. The flavor is a hint of sweet sugar up front that quickly becomes smokey with light fruits and a bit of wine like flavor. A charred ashy flavor sweeps in and lingers long into the finish of every sip. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a full almost gritty mouthfeel. Big burnt fruity Baltic porter. I warmed up to it after a while, but it is not my favorite example of the style."

"Overall: i personally think the best Baltic porters come from the Scandinavian countries. Extremely delicious for a beer that has traveled thousands of miles to get to Boston."
""
""
"A really wonderful beer. I enjoyed this and it surely surprised me."
""
"O: Fantastic. Sinebrychoff reigns supreme as king of the Baltic Porters. Rich, deep, and complex, yet still very drinkable. Full of character and nuance. There's a lot of legend and history surrounding this beer too. A favorite of the late Michael Jackson, and a timeless classic of a beer."

"My first beer from Finland. Really glad to find it on tap as it's one of the best porters around."
"RJT"
"Overall- Very good beer. There's a tiny bit of thinness to the flavor profile that prevents me from putting higher than a 4.25 but it is close. It's a must try."
""
""
"11.2oz bottle, pours near black, creamy light brown head leaves some lace as it fades. Super rich aroma with plum, raisin, chocolate, booze, anise, black pepper. Tastes are smooth and rich with plenty of dark fruit notes - mainly raisin & plum, with smoke, chocolate, caramel, toffee, anise, and a peppery finish. Medium body but seems watery at times, ample carbonation, very smooth. Really nice to finally come back to this one after 2 or 3 years. Just as good as I remember, and always a favorite!"
""
"O: Overall I thought this was a good Baltic Porter. It's pretty much your standard fare, and I doubt porter and stout lovers would have anything bad to say about it. There are some slightly odd characteristics to the scent and taste, but they provide a sort-of sweetness that is a welcome counterpart to the toasty flavor."

"Excellent Porter, complex, very bold and tasteful. They should quit doing Vodka and dedicate to Ales."

"O - A very solid beer. Very glad I was able to find this. Would certainly have again."
""
"O - This is a great porter! I ate it with a hot fudge sundae... man it was good. Looks good, smells good, tastes good, goes down smooth. A very solid porter in spite of its higher alcohol and the tastes and smell are profound and different enough to make this beer stand out."

"Overall: This beer is the best value for money that you can get in Finland, costing only just over 2 Euros at Alko and often some 4,5 Euros at bars -- effectively half the price of many similar beers. Unsurprisingly, this means that I've had the beer many, many times, and will gladly go back to it any time. It deserves the praise that it has gotten, although it's sometimes better known outside of Finland. Although the Koff Porter isn't most chocolate flavoured of stouts, or doesn't boast intensive coffee or strange herbs, it still deserves to be rated highly. Why? Because of its uncompromising devotion to the core of what a porter is supposed to be. It's perfectly balanced, deep, and truly black."

"Overall: This is my first Baltic Porter, so I can't say how indicative it is of the style, but its pretty damn tasty overall. My only other experience with porters has really been Bell's and Founder's - and in that sense, this beer is nothing like those. It's got a very unique smell and taste profile."

"Overall: Couldn't find much information, but it feels like this bottle may have a bit of age on it. Still big, robust, and delicious, but not quite to the level of when I had it on tap. Feel like some age has thinned out a bit of the malty presence. Still a delicious beer in a style that a lot of breweries don't produce (baltic porter.) Highly recommended."
""
"Overall- This is not a bad BALTIC porter by any means but the bottle dubs itself plainly as a porter. With that being said, I was sort of torn while judging because sometimes the specific style a beer is given on this site is decided by anyone who cares to change it. For example; were the overly roasty, bitter flavors intentional to try and re-create the style brewed in the 1700s? Who knows. Either way this is a great beer. Maybe not a 93/100 or 95/100 IMO but none-the-less worth a try if you like porters/stouts and haven't had this yet."
"Price Point - $4.69/11.2 oz bottle"
"Overall: A really fine beer; not as fruity as other Baltics but the ashen flavor adds a really interesting dimension"
""
"Really nice one. I can see how one could say it's a thick, strong porter instead of a stout, I guess. But apart from all that, very nice, complex, roasty treat. Would definitely pick it up again."
""
""
"A definite winner in my book."
""
""
""
""

"Overall- Not bad, but I can go out and get other porters or shouts that are hop forward for a much better value. It's good, but would go out of my way to purchase it again."

"As far as Baltic porters go, I still prefer smuttynose, but this is still quite tasty."

"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours pitch black with a fine light brown head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of roasted and sweet malt, chocolate, dark fruit, light oxidation. Flavor is dark roasted malt, sour cherry, chocolate and hints of burnt coffee. A rich taste approaching a good stout. All the element I expect from a good Baltic porter with the sour fruit element nicely balanced by roastiness. Finishes with toasted malt and coffee. Heavy bodied and creamy. An excellent, tasty Baltic porter."
"11.2 OZ bottle. Pours black with a brown, foamy, long lasting head and a lot of lacing. Aroma is of toasted malt, bread crust, coffee, and hints of chocolate. Body is medium and smooth. Toasted malt, burnt grain, coffee, prunes and dark chocolate fill the mouth. Finish is medium and slightly bitter. Easy drinking porter."

"A nice enough Baltic porter. Fairly complex and pleasurable overall."

"Damn fine looking dark beer with a remarkably deep shade on its head, which is short but dense. Just a pitch black brew here, speaking to no lack of roasted malts. Smells kind of earthy, kind of bready, a touch of caramel sweetness to it, but nothing real roasty about the nose. The nose doesn't lie either, not any roast on the palate either and hey, that's alright, this is a real porter after all, not some stout masquerading as one. Comes on nice and sweet, almost reminiscent of the dark fruit and licorice flavors of big English styles like barleywine or old ale. Definitely a caramel kind of sweetness, but it slides gracefully to the bitter end of the spectrum for the finish, certainly a hops kind of bitterness more than a roast type. Would never have guessed that this has as much booze as it does but for the flavor comparisons to other strong styles. Mouthfeel comes of as kind of thin, very little carbonation but i neither expect or want that out of this beer. The body is alright though, and it resists being too sticky or viscous. As a package, definitely a remarkable example. If someone asks you how a porter is different than a stout, this would be a lovely example for demonstration of the distinction, which I personally claim is the roast malt character being stronger in stouts. There simply isn't another way to categorize this beer - it is a porter, and a profound one at that."

"All in all one of the better Porters I have tried."

"Cheers!"

"Truly a porter for the stout of heart."

"O: A great baltic porter and my first Finish beer that I have reviewed - this beer came highly recommended and did not disappoint. The alcohol is well hidden and I could definitely enjoy more than one of these, though not too many with the 7.2 ABV."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very enjoyable. Goes down easy. Nice late evening sipper."
""
""
"O- A delicious beer, very drinkable, definitely gonna have to pick this one up again."

"Lots of lacing. Great head and retention, especially for an import. Smooth, full bodied, rich and decadent. Sweet but not cloying. A gem of a beer that I'm glad to have tried. I'd gladly purchase this again."

"This one was recommended by a friend of mine, he said that he loved it and that if I hadn't drank it before I should give one a try. So I ordered one up and poured it out. The beer was black as night and had a thin brown colored head on top. The smell of the beer was heavily roasted, it had some light chocolate aromas too. The taste of the beer was almost like charcoal at first. It was burnt tasting and not all the good to me. The aftertaste sort of gave off this odd creamy flavor. Not sure how it works but that was what I kept getting. The mouthfeel was thinner than I expected it to be. Overall I wasn't a huge fan of this beer but it must strike good with some people it seems. Maybe worth trying again."

"O: This is probably my 2nd favorite Baltic porter out there, behind only Okocim. The European beers of the style have more of a lightness to them that I love, and combining that with the dark malts that typically define a porter really make this a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"o - one of the better porters I've had...and I would have never guessed it could have come from Finland..."
"O: I found it unbalanced, but not all will. Personally, not my favorite, but a well-made brew."
"O - The Sinebrychoff was an enjoyable porter. I was glad I got to try it, and would have it again."
"O - a strongly flavored and excellent baltic porter."
"O- This is a good beer. I wonder if the metallic taste is due to a bad bottle?"
"overall impression: it was fun to sample a bottle that had been aged this long. I picked up a couple of other bottles the same weekend to sample to have a point of comparision. certainly a great beer."
"Almost black with a medium, big foamy head. A strong Burnt chocolate aroma with some roasted malt and hints of licorice. Roasted, lightly burned flavor with hints of licorice and coffee. Light to medium body, hardly any carbonation. Ok Porter, kinda thin, 1 dimensional. Another site says it's retired?"
"O: A great surprise to get to try this at a wedding where I anticipated knocking back some BMC as I figured it would be my only option."
"O: This is a really nice beer with quite a bit of character. What a treat! Will surely buy it again."
"Light to medium thickness in texture. Overall, an excellent porter that is very enjoyable. Definitely worth a try."
"O - Nice porter, but more similar to a dry stout or even a schwarzbier. Im a fan of all so I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"Poured a thick black with mahogany highlights, and a modest beige head. Molasses and caramel in the nose, and a bit of indistinct fruit. Very malty taste, more molasses, licorice, touches of semisweet chocolate and figs. Finishes bitter and a bit dry. Heavy-medium mouthfeel, thick and a bit oily, and quite drinkable."
"O - this is a very good baltic porter. definitely worth trying but for the price ($4.45) per bottle i probably wouldn't revisit."
"This is a great option for a readily available top-notch baltic porter."
"Conclusion: I find this Baltic porter to be a far cry from the best in this class. However, it is possible that the bottle I have obtained is too old or there is some other problem with it (however it is not oxidized and came from a store with a good track record)."
"O - Very enjoyable. Would have enjoyed it a bit more if it was more silky than watery, but it still is a very nice Baltic Porter."
"Pours a deep, dark and clean near-black, small cap of creamy, dense off-white head. Scent is an attractive blend of roasted matled, notes of dark cocoa, dark fruits (cherry, blackberry) and faint hints of coffee. Taste is quite wonerful - dark roasted and toasted matls give way to bitter dark chocolate and strong dark fruity - almost like eating the best chocolate covered cherry one has ever had. Taste finnished out with notes of coffee, and a light nuttyness. Medium bodied, creamy and smooth, lightly dry on the finnish with some grainyness on the tongue. Quite possibly the best porter in the world - deep and complex, almost stout-like in every way but no issues with excess as it as delecate as it is bold."
"Sinebrychoff Porter pours a complete black, with just over two fingers of frothy caramel foam topping it off. The head shows some staying power, and there are a fair amount of spots of lacing left sticking to the glass. The nose is a bit muted, but aromas of bitter espresso and anise to come through. Espresso is still the first thing that comes to mind when the beer crashes over my palate, but there's a bit more supporting it. Anise is largely replaced by a touch of dark chocolate and some molasses. In addition there's a certain fruitiness and lactic twang that reminds me of a dry irish stout. The body is impressively rich and creamy for a beer whose flavors come across as so dry, and the carbonation is apppropriately mild, staying out of the way of a malt driven beer. Sinebrychoff Porter both is a true classic and a beer I wouldn't hesitate to give to friends who don't know beer past Guinness."
"O: I would definitely try this beer again if I happen to see it on-tap as the mouthfeel seems to come across as being a bit smoother and fuller bodied."
"O - Not too bad. I really enjoyed how rustic this one was, with plenty of simple flavors working in tandem to create an overall good beer. Very nice stuff."
"Poured a 1.5"" quite dark mocha head. Body is black as coffee. Smell has chocolate, coffee, malt. Taste is more of same but what's most noteworthy is the chocolate malt and long slightly bitter finish have a definite dark chocolate aspect to them. I felt like I'd munched a high end 80+% cocoa bar. All in all this holds its own against a world of rich porters. Well done."
"Overall, the Finnish make one helluva porter that brings a ton of roasty characteristics to the table"
"O/D - Nice stuff. Quite sessionable and tasty. Not world class, but hell, it's a good porter for a cold day and worth a shot."
"Very drinkable and only $3/bottle (less, actually). I've sen this before and never grabbed one -- what have I been missing? Very worthy."
"This is a great porter and up there with my favorites (like Founders). I would definitely buy this more often if it were a bit cheaper."
"This beer has a wonderful aroma and taste. Roasted malts, with noticeable chocolate malts are the backbone here. More subtle are flavors of dried fruit and earthy cocoa bitterness. Hops kick in at the finish giving a bitter twang which softens back to cocoa. Though seemingly chugable, be refined and savor this experience. You probably had to search to find a bottle anyway."
"This is a really nice tasting Porter. Easy drinking for sure. I can only imagine how awesome this would taste from a cask or on tap. Beautiful lacing up and down the glass."
"Drink: 4 This is so intense and rich that I'm not sure I could have more than a couple... A thoroughly enjoyable porter that deserves its world-class reputation..."
"My absolute favorite beer to date and this coming from an experienced Porter lover. Pours a thick viscous opaque black with a dark brown head that simply looks delicious with a spicy coffee aroma. Smooth creamy mouth-feel backed by a lightly sweet blend of chocolate, toffee, and coffee flavors with notes of spice and a deep oak background. Mild bite typical of porters in the finish. If you spot this on the shelf at your local beer store, snatch it up."
"Pours a thick motor oil black with a HUGE 3 inch dark brown head. Chunky ring lacing on the drink down. Smells of subdued coffee, cocoa powder, roasted dark malt. Taste is like the nose with coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and a bit of a charcoal-like/burnt flavor. There is a slight vinegar/acidic twang in the taste too. Light carbonation with a somewhat light body makes for a good mouthfeel. Good drinkability on this harder to find porter from Finland."
"Drinkability is very good. Top notch, classic."
"Overall: Overall the beer was a good Porter. The balance of sweet and bitter flavors works very well. I would recommend any beer drinker try this one."
"Drinkability is superior- nice long flavor and the alcohol content doesn't seem overly strong, but I can see tanking and basking in a few bottles of this stuff."
"This is very easy to drink. It's something you'll want to drink a lot of, but probably shouldn't. It's quite filling and the ABV will get you if you're not careful."
"D: for what its worth, id drink these all night long. its pretty tasty and the price tag aint bad either!"
"D: This beer is definitely a great drinker's beer. It is a porter with medium weight, reasonable taste, and a great balance of flavors. However it wasn't what I wanted, nor what I expected after all the hype."
"I had a Founders Porter right before this one and I must say, this was a touch better aside from the smell."
"D: Actually struggling a bit with this one. Finding the bitterness to be more and more aggressive after each sip. Think it could use just a bit more sweetness to counter this."
"D - Considering this is suppose to be the most amazing porter out there, was a little disappointed. Maybe had a bad bottle. Not something you can slam back, share to sip with good friends."
"Pours a deep dark rich mahogany with a small brown head. Aroma of dark malts, caramel, coffee, chocolate, dried fruit. Taste is same as aroma. Palate is full body,very nice smooth and creamy texture, good carbonation. Finish is creamy, chocolate, coffee, dark fruits and caramel, a touch of licorice, with some light bitter hops to add some balance. Overall a very nice and smooth BP. Very tasty and enjoyable."
"Big dark black body of a porter here on the baltic side with some slimy oily looking liquid condensing into a dark elixir. Head is nice, medium tan, hits of mocha, sheets of lace, spraypaint like, a looker. Takes a while for the nose to come out and what comes out is roast, dark malt, old world porter, cocco, licorice, dark fruit. Nice and different actually. Taste takes a step down IMHO, but still tasty and baltic. The main taste is roast, malt, cocco, maybe a little coffee. The dark fruit kinda gets in the way kinda muting the bit of vanilla that's in the tail end. I woulda rather had that. Interesting beer here. Feel is medium, could use a boost, be a bit thicker, but still a oily slick porter with faint bitterness. A small prick to the tounge. While I would not drink this to excess, I will gladly grab one of these every winter for a warmer."
"The body is a little thinner than I have come to expect or like in a baltic porter and maybe a little more carbonated than I would like."
"It's full and robust and drinks much lighter than a beer with an ABV of 7.2%. It's a wonderful example of the Baltic Porter style and a beer I look forward to drinking again and again."
"D- The only real negative about this beer is that it tastes and feels like a larger than 7.2% beer. Intensely complex. Certainly a sipper."
"D: very drinkable and enjoyable, at 7.2 ABV it commands respect"
"D - a little less fruit and this could be an all-nighter."
"Not an elite example of the style (especially because it straddles the line between Baltic Porter and Robust Porter). This is plenty tasty and easy to drink. Were it cheaper and available in six packs I'd consider buying it again. Worth a shot, especially if you love Porters."
"This is just an awesome porter and I will definitely have it again."
"a great example of the style and a long awaited bottle. pour is like a good porter with a pretty decent head but not as massive. hits like a american but with the baltic sour zest. nose of molasses and earth, coffee grounds and chocolate. palate is a blend of that with sour finish and a bitter lingering quality of caramelized onions. there is some stale porter fruit if grape and plum and a blood earth quality. fantastic aspect of everything that a baltic can do. hits all the notes nicely."
"This is one of the classic porters and it lives up to expectations."
"Lighter bodied also than I would have expected. Still mid bodied and no alcohol present. Drinkability is only hurt by the carboard. Had this some time ago and remember it more fondly, but have had many better examples since apparently. Still not bad and worth trying. This bottle could be bit old, but that should help not hurt."
"They were sold out of my first choice, but this is a pretty nice runner-up. It pours a straight black topped by about a finger-and-a-half of dark-ish tan foam. Pretty. The nose comprises chocolate (both dark and milk, baby), roasted malts, light smoke, maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, and a touch of spruce tips. The taste is very similar, heavy on the roast, molasses, maple syrup, and brown sugar; some burnt biscuits are added, along with some more (though still pretty light) smoke. This is some damn tasty Baltic porter, I tell you what. The body is a heavy medium, with a moderate carbonation and a velvety feel. Overall, a very nice brew, one that I plan on revisiting rather often."
"Drinkability - one is plenty but that's not unusual for porters. Pretty good brew, definitely not my favorite style but a good representation of a Baltic Porter."
"Drinkability -- Picked this up on recommendation from the manager at my favorite bottle shop as I took the last Ølfabrikken from the shelf. Doesn't quite compar, but still a delicious beer. I may have again."
"Pretty decent stuff here. Nothing amazing but I wouldn't turn down another; this stuff went down pretty easy."
"Drinkability is very good. This was an awesome random pick at the random liqour store..."
"Pours a two finger brown head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Light carbonation and Heavy bodied. Black color, no highlights, some yeast left in bottle. Nose is molasses. Flavor is chewy molasses, nice porter. Less chocolate and more molasses than 8 years ago. $4.45 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Lots of dark fruits, raisins, milk chocolate, a hint of roast, touch of coffee, quite sweet. Light roast and it's subdued by the fruits and milky sweetness. Hint of something cardboardish, perhaps a little oxidized? Some smoke as the beer warms which adds a nice layer. Warming alcohol, slightly thinnish mouthfeel for the style. Can't say I loved this one but it certainly wasn't bad, just not in my top tier for the style."
"Nice stuff and deserving of its place on the Baltic porter top 10, though I'd take Trois Mousqueatires' version over this in a heartbeat!"
"kept drinking this with dinner...beer warmed up. spicy dinner. sweetness came out and it is a very tasty brew. can even drink another now."
"Loved this beer since I first had it, though, I couldn't see drinking more than two in one sitting or paying $98 for a case on my pageboy's wages. Still, I do feel kind of noble drinking this."
"D-There's a lingering dry, almost astringent, bitter thing going on in the finish that makes this one a little hard to drink for me."
"Definitely an interesting version of the style that gets the job done. Refreshing. Worth a try."
"D: Light Feel for a Porter but doesn't Lack in flavor. Less Filling than most porters. Not bad. Could probably have a couple of these in 1 night."
"A very robust and satisfying brew. This beer is worth seeking out. a great example of a full bodied, smokey porter. I can't say I've had too many baltic porters, but this is by far the best I've quaffed. Tastes of the finest indonesian coffee ring through (Sulawesi comes to mind) with a very nice hop presence. I taste a lot of burnt butter and molasses. This beer reminds me of Myers Dark Rum."
"Baking cocoa maltiness is very nice and leads the way on the palate. Raisin juice fruitiness mixes with the chocolate for a surprisingly smooth experience. ABV is nowhere to be found and the beer is dangerously drinkable. The fruitiness and the thinner body makes this decidedly fall into the Baltic Porter category as opposed to a stout, but shares many of the same flavor components. Very delicious brew and goes well with roasted pecans. Make sure to drink this beer at least at 50 degrees, if not warmer, it really opens up nicely. I will be sure to try and score some more of this next time I am in Louisiana, I am sad I only bought two bottles."
"Overall, this is an excellent, and classic, Baltic Porter. Loving the sweet and pleasant flavors with the slight roastiness of an English/American porter."
"Pours nearly opaque black with brown head. Nose has some dark chocolate and dark rum aromas. On the palate the roasty flavors dominate, with a lot of malt sweetness with chocolate and coffee. Finish is full of coffee flavors. Alcohol is tame on the palate, even though it has a high ABV."
"Drinkability: quite high for such a dark beer. I could easily see myself enjoying a couple of these in one (longish) sitting."
"Careful with this one as the alcohol is quiet after that initial hit. Easy drinking. I think B/B still has a 1999 bottle in their cellar."
"A good beer at a pretty good price, too."
"Pours a smooth, deep black with a few finger of mocha colored head that dissolves into a nice heavy ring around the glass that leaves nice lacing down the glass. The aroma has lots of roasted malts with some bitter chocolate and some hints of toast. Chocolate malt and bread are at the forefront of flavors followed by roast and a smooth sweet finish. Its medium-full bodied with a light amount of carbonation and comes across slick and oily. Fantastic porter, really enjoyed the toasty character that came out behind all the roast and chocolate. Also, really enjoyed the low carbonation that allowed for the flavors to be showcased and meld together."
"D - Even with the mild over-carbonation it's still quite easy to drink. It definitely feels like a winter brew, so it's appropriate I'm having this one on a cold January night. The residual bitterness is restrained, and the alcohol is not overtly obvious."
"Overall I still like this beer, but think it's much better in bottle than on draft."
"One of the best overall beers I've ever had and is my personal benchmark for the Baltic Porter style."
"Now I am drinking it from a Duvel tulip. The starch is still annoying in the nose. But these bottles I have now are much better tasting. The first bottles I had were from a different store, though they share the same 5 year expired freshness date. The starch came out big time in the flavor of the previous, perhaps oxidized beer. No more; the flavors meld well. This beer is complex, and has aged well. I feel fortunate to have had both sides of the spectrum to compare."
"This was a good porter. Drinkable for such a huge malt character. Had high hopes for this one. Not super impressed but this was a damn solid porter. Good across the board."
"Overall- Incredibly drinkable for a dark as night porter! Very complex, righ, and quaffable brew! Will definitely snag a few of these for the cellar for the fall.winter! Would pair nice with anything chocolate (desserts), creamy pasta sauces, bourbon!, lamb, or other rich meats."
"Very dark color, not quite completely black, with one inch of mocha head. The head does not last as long as I would of liked and it settles to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Neither the aroma or flavor are as great as a couple of other Baltic Porters, but this beer is still lovely, complex, and dynamic. Great malt aroma and flavor runs deep into the drinking experience. Notes of espresso, cocoa, and smoke. Hop bitterness seems much higher than others within the style. Alcohol is well disguised and not detected. The body is not as robust as I would of liked but has a nice soft texture. Another of the great Baltic Porters. There is a definate dividing line between the few greats, and the rest of the pretenders."
"Pours a near black color, with brown highlights towards the edges. Big dense rocky head that left a sheet of lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is of roasted malt and oxidized red grapes, similar to an old ale. Some honey and raisin round out the aroma. The taste is of a milk chocolate malt with oxidized grapes, cherries and a tart lemon twang. Me must thinks that this is a bit aged. The roasted malt bitterness stays true throughout this beer. The feel is thick and chewy like a stout, soft carbonation; finishes with a roasted malt bitterness and a sour lemon twang. A very thick and robust baltic porter, right on style. There are some oxidized notes that add a port wine and lemon character. Though it might be old, this has some nice flavors and a big feel."
"D: A very unique brew. Not sure if I would buy it again, though I might be persuaded if I saw it on tap. Pretty big for a porter, but I suppose that is the whole point of this style.. Interesting, and worth a try."
"D: This is my first time trying a baltic porter and I must say I am impressed. This is a bit on the pricey side but it goes down smoothly and the complexity of the beverage in both taste and nose really make it shine."
"Full bodied beer but a thin flavor. Some roast in the back of the mouth and in the aftertaste there is some coffee like flavors. Despite the smell I would not describe the flavor of this beer as sweet at all. In fact its a little dry. Mouthfeel good, drinkability moderate."
"The foam was dark wheat in color with a reddish hue, thick and smooth. The color was very opaque/brown with cola red highlights in the light. The taste had a deep, rich taste of roasted barley, coffee and caramel highlights. Drinkability - good if you like rich/full-bodied beer. Mouthfeel - full-bodied and rich"
"d- this thing is definitely a treat. A very bold and deeply complex flavor and an aroma like heaven. I would happily drink two or three of these without getting remotely bored of this taste. Definitely a full, four-dimensional porter worth exploring."
"The taste will not disappoint. The beer has a very strong cherry dark chocolatey taste, tons of dark malts, lots of roasted and charred flavors, a bit of molasses and brown sugar a touch burnt. This is a nice Baltic porter. The mouthfeel is oily on the tongue but there is a nice aftertaste. The beer is 7.2% ABV but this is well hidden and there is no boozy or throaty feel to the beer with this level of ABV. This is a nice beer for the winter months. L'Chaim."
"The taste is also light with the same flavors you get in the aroma shing through. There is a nice chocolate finish that makes it easy to drink and gives it a nice heavy feel."
"Overall, high quality and an immediate favorite of mine. Try stuffing a few in the back of the fridge for a few years!"
"Pours deep black with a small but pretty tan almost brown head and little lacing lines the glass. Smells of roasted nuts, coffee, and hints of sweet bourbon. Nose is quite nice. Taste is smooth and great. Dark chocolate, coffee, and hints of raisins make up the quaff. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some carbonation. Drinkability is fairly high, pretty good for this style."
"notes- may have tasted it too warm (61.9 degrees). nice for laying down seven years. this review is for a 1996 vintage tasted in 2003"
"Awesome example of the style and well deserving of the high rating. Probably the second best baltic I've had behind Foothills' limited offering, though it's been awhile since I've had that one."
"Oh well. Chaulk that up to one bad beer"
"D: Very complex and layered. Easy on the palette and good going down. Rich in flavor and enjoyable. This is a damn good porter and worth every sip. I feel as if this is a must try."
"D: Very easy to put down. A must for fans of strong dark beers."
"The beer pours a blackish brown color with OK head retention and lacing. As expected on the nose, I get a lot of coffee, chocolate and vanilla. Still, this porter smells pretty good. Fortunately, good as it smells, this beer is much more impressive on the palate. I get chocolate, coffee, vanilla and cherry, as well as a hint of licorice as well. There's even a slight hint of tartness to this beer, that I think works very well in countering this beers moderate (at most) sweetness. The beer is fairly long and smooth, and I get something of a dry, almost leathery finish. Drinkability is pretty good, with the alcohol well disgused. Not sure if I could drink more then one of these, but nevertheless, this was an all together pretty enjoyable porter."
"On tap at The GInger Man (listed as Sinebrychoff Porter). Pours black with a tan head. Aroma is sour and peaty, kind of weird. Flavor is very medicinal with sweet roasted malt. This was pretty bad...my opinion seems very different from others--bad keg?"
"Final thoughts: Pretty tasty and very stout like, creamy and frothy and lots of chalky dark chocolate and touch of fruits, pretty good tasting and drinkable, can measure up to many of the good porter/stouts, but not the best."
"D: This is a remarkably drinkable beer. It combines a palate-cleansing dryness with a pleasant roasted flavor that keeps you sipping. Overall this is an excellent beer. I hope the Pour House gets this on tap more often."
"Overall, a great baltic porter from Finland. I find myself wishing for more of this style from our American craft brewers."
"D- Very nice beer. Big, bold flavors disguise the alcohol in the beverage. While I sampled this in the summer, it would surely be more appropriate as a winter warmer. This beer is delicious and very drinkable. I would gladly drink 3-4 of these through the course of the night."
"Overall, I'm very pleasantly surprised. The taste, mouthfeel and appearance are all pluses for me. The aroma is a bit less impressive, as it betrays the 7% ABV a bit and is less grainy than I had hoped. The beer pours well and is quite attractive compared to many other porters I have sampled, with generous amounts of lace ringing the glass. Drinkability is probably not quite as good as some other traditional Baltic porters, which I understand are generally lighter in body and sometimes in alcohol content as well, but for a single serving this is quite a brew. I like this one. It's not cheap for a 33cl bottle, but it's an excellent treat on a rainy day. Highly recommended."
"M + D: Medium bodied, a touch on the heavier side. It supports the flavour well, and that's a plus. Considering the ABV, it goes down amazingly smooth and easy... a good representation of style, and worth looking into."
"Overall a great Baltic porter, a style which I really appreciate, and this one is well near the top of my rankings for Baltic porters."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable because of the low alcohol and complexity of flavors."
"Quite a unique taste, reminds me of melted dark chocolate bars with somewhat off-putting flavors of sour milk and hoppy bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated, medium-bodied, and chalky--too chalky and dry for my liking. Overall, I found this to be an interesting try, but not a phenomenal Baltic Porter by any means. I'd like to try it on tap to see how it compares, though."
"Immediate smell is of average intensity: crushed grapes and a strong woody tone. Tastes of molasses, lightly of wood chips, chestnuts...very nutty porter. This beer has a somewhat smooth stout-feel on the mouth; it thinly coats the palate with chocolate and wood. This beer was pretty good, though unfortunately the feel and the taste stick around forever."
"What a great Porter. This is a model by which others are judged."
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a black color with a small head. Considerable lacing of the glass. There is a mild coffee aroma. Taste is mild with hints of coffee, finishes slightly bitter. Medium bodied and a tad bitter in the mouth. This beer is a bit heavy on the stomach for continuos drinking. Overall a so-so beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium, and I could definitely have a couple of these. I thought Flying Dog Gonzo was fantastic, but this one is giving it a run for its money."
"D- Great representation of this style. Definitely a great beer to pair with cold weather and/or some meat."
"D: Great beer, a little too heavy on the bitterness but overall very tasty."
"HV"
"D: This is a drinkable, not too heavy Baltic Porter. A well done beer."
"D - Would burn out after 1 or two."
"This is delicious and would be great for a crisp evening. Such a solid porter."
"D- Super easy to drink, I'll be sure to pick this one up again if I come across it."
"D- im sorry i didnt think to try this one sooner. very cheap, and quite good. a little strong to session, but certainly not over the top ABV wise for the style. something ill check out again. you should too."
"The beer was very smooth, but with a thick body, but not to much so, and extremely easy to drink. Overall a very good porter."
"This beer's greatness is hard to describe. Many subtle notes that are hard to qualify. It manages to be both refreshing and nourishing. If you see a bottle on the shelf, grab it, and you'll know what I mean (I hope)."
"D--Absolutely. A satisfying refresher going down too quickly for comfort!"
"drinkability - The bitterness screwed my head a little, not use to that on a porter. Not that bad. Was pretty good."
"Pitch black with a thing light brown head that settles to a thin rim. The aroma is dominated by burnt malts and molasses. The malts are roasty. They go with some dark fruit and some slight spiciness. The bitterness from the malts lingers for a bit. The alcohol is well hidden. Full bodied."
"D: wonderfully drinkable baltic porter. Some unexpected complexities in the nose & taste, and the alcohol while well hidden does hit eventually :) -- yet I'd be happy to drink more."
"Of all the ""authentic"" Baltic Porters (those from the Baltic region) that I've had I definitely like this one the most. Its very drinkable yet complex and absolutely well balanced and delicious."
"On tap at Pepperland Cafe. The beer was an opaque black with a thick milk chocolate head and a bit of lacing. It had a mostly coffee aroma, but there was also some sweet dark fruit. Tasted primarily of espresso, but the bitterness of the coffee was nicely balanced by the dark fruit. A very enjoyable beer."
"This particular bottle seemed slightly stale or oxidized, not sure how long it had been sitting around before buying it."
"Could be heavier, carbonation is good, definately a bit too thin. Drinkability is very high."
"D. Strong flavors come together to create a awesome beer. I really enjoyed drinking this and will be drinking it often from now on."
"Very refreshing & of course easy to sink."
"Conclusion: The flavors have an EVER so slightly muted feel to them, like this beer's sat around a bit too long...and it's still fantastic...at like 2.39 a bottle, I'm gonna go buy out the last 10 or so of these from the store...wonderful Baltic Porter"
"D: Just a great beer all-around. Glad I finally found this in Carlsbad, a shame I won't be able to buy it more often. I can certainly see why it was in the top 100 for a while."
"This is one of the better porters out there in my opinion. If you're a fan of beers like The Abyss, I think you'll really enjoy this brew. I usually don't reach for this style brew, but I'd certainly have this one again. Well done by our friends in Finland."
"Overall I liked the beer, a bit to strong in ABV and flavor to drink more then one at a time, but that one is enjoyable."
"May have just been the bottle, but poured a huge, dense 1"" head, but quickly faded, leaving a thin, but still dense layer on top of deep, dark brown, and once again, dense looking beer. Incredible lacing as the head recedes. Not an overwhelmingly strong smell, there a smoked scent, with maybe a hint of coffee or chocolate. There is a nice mix roasted malts and that chocolate/coffee from the scent. It has an initial ""bite"" of bitterness up front that fades fast. No strong carbonization, so rests low and dense in your mouth. Certainly masks the ABV well, as it goes down like many weaker ABV porters."
"Overall this is a solid representation of the style that does everything right without overdoing anything. Be sure to give this one a try."
"Pours a beautiful black with a large brown head that stays upand becomes craggy like the foam on a milkshake. Leaves nice looking rings on the glass as you drink it. Rich aromas of cocoa, express, and burnt malts. Very enticing appearance and smell. Taste is much sweeter than I expected: lots of milk chocolate and bit of a charred, roasty bitterness. Disappointingly thin body this quality ultimately makes it easier drink. A top-notch beer."
"Aroma is strong and smoky with a salty undertone, like fine coffee mixed with miso. It pours black as motor oil with a thick dark ecru head that is fine-bubbled but doesn't stick around. Flavor is like smoky coffee with nutty and unsweetened chocolate hints, and just a touch of sweetness and a bit of hop bitterness. Texture is smooth and tingly, and just a bit on the watery side. Not too shabby."
"D: The sourness keeps the drinkability score down. Maybe my palette just isn't refined enough to enjoy that aspect. A very interesting brew for sure. The smell and taste differ somewhat. I'm glad I gave this one a try."
"Very smooth and creamy brew. I'm tasting some roasted characteristics, some definitive chocolate, with a pumpernickel bready finish. Very fine tasting beer. This is an exceptional brew. Recommend."
"Opaque black under a thick tan head that slowly recedes into a lumpy, creamy, milkshake-like topping. Webby, stringy lace all over the glass. Aromas of deep, dark, malty goodness...sweet chocolate cake, fruity alcohol esters, light roastiness, and a faint hint of smoke. Black roasted malt and rich sweetness in the flavor. Dark fruits, but the roastiness dominates and lingers. Some alcohol, but the sheer amount of deliciousness covers it up with ease. Full, slick mouthfeel...modestly bitter and dry. Fucking awesome. I want more."
"D - Almost a perfect beer, almost. Please do yourself a favor and try it"
"My first Finish beer! Hopefully not my last!"
"Dang, I really like this beer. Again, much better as it warms. Great. Thanks again Greg."
"Pours a very dark black with foamy coffee colored head. Beautiful aroma of smoky maltiness, chocolate, nut and toast. This is a very complex beer with lots of smoky malty flavor. Hints of chocolate, toast, nut and roasted coffee."
"The taste is rich, complex, yet smooth and clean, with great balance of flavours, sweetness and bitterness. It has complex tastes of leaves, chocolate, dark toasted brown bread, prunes, a hint of port, some raisin, black pepper (esp. in the finish), with an increasing taste of black coffee condensed with brown sugar that is stronger by the end. It is rather dry throughout for the most part. In the middle, it has a definite but light sweetness and light but slightly stronger bitterness right at the finish, but for most of the time, up front and in the final finish and aftertaste, it is mostly dry, clean, and leafy. The flavours are fairly strong, but nicely restrained and harmonious."
"Excellent flavor and balance, too bad I only picked up a single."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and easy drinking. This is a damn fine baltic porter that really hits the spot. Just a solid offering that I will have to pick up a few more bottles of now. Worth checking out for sure."
"Overall, a highly enjoyable beer on a frigid mid-November day. It warmed me up to say the least, and most certainly put me in a good mood."
"If you can find it (Findlay OH is where she got it), you really should try this."
"Hints of dark fruits and figs (akin to a Belgian triple) are tucked in there, but it is the malts that do the talking. A tad simplistic at times, complex at others, a damn good beer (especially from the Fins!) and only the high ABV prevents me from continually downing this."
"Bottle thanks to Santa. Pours a pure black body with a medium light brown head. The aroma is full of a boozy combination of dark fruit and espresso. The taste is very nice; tons of sweet fruits, blackberries mostly, some coffee and chcolates, and a dry and toasted malt finish. A very nice Porter for sure. I could live in FInland just to drink these, plus all those hot Finnish girls."
"Drinkability is OK, I have to say I was disappointed with this one for sure, especially once I saw how highly rated it was. I prefer my Baltic's richer, sweeter, and with more depth and smoothness, this one is all about the dry, boozy roast."
"wasn't to bad to drink either but will most likely just be the one time purchase"
" Body is not too thick and slightly oily, quite appropriate for the style. This is certainly a slow-drinking ale, but still goes down pretty easily, all things considered. On the whole, a tasty dark ale that is a true pleasure to drink."
"Not the greatest porter I've ever had, but certainly a good one. I would have no qualms about drinking more of this."
"Drinkability: What a great dry roasted Baltic Porter! It's too bad that it doesn't come in a bigger bottle. This small bottle won't last long and I guess neither would a big bottle of this fine brew either. You might think it might be another expensive European beer, but it's really not. I could see myself buying another bottle or two to enjoy again in the near future."
"Pours an extremely dark brown that borders on black with almost 2 fingers of persistent mocha colored head. Excellent aroma, big and malty, some sweetness. Some cocoa, caramel, and toffee as well as lots of darker fruits, prunes, plums, a bit port-like. Taste is excellent. There is a big malty sweetness upfront that never totally goes away but is overtaken by over flavors rather quickly. There is a prominent roasted character here that is quite like schwarzbier, not like a stout but more pronounced than the of variants of porter. The dark fruits are again present and play a more prominent role than in the aroma. The like cocoa, caramel, and toffee flavors take a backseat here. Very clean, low-medium hop bitterness, just enough to balance this out. Mouthfeel is pretty good, medium-full body with moderate-ish carbonation and next to no discernible alcohol presence. Drinakbility is excellent. Complex, well balanced, easy to drink and highly enjoyable."
"D: Very drinkable for the abv. The flavors don't linger (unpleasantly) leaving me wanting more."
"Sinebrychoff pours a dark brown almost black with an MONSTER of a chocolate milky brown head that leaves thick lacing, very impressive. Big nose of chocolatey, coffee goodness, roasty and semi sweet overall with subtle notes of bourbon. Full and quite chewy in initial body, but becomes surprisingly thin after a few sips. Hops explode just before the finish, cakey with yeasty notes of pepper and brown sugar. But it leaves the tongue craving another quaff. Very coating with a sweet toasty aftertaste. No alcohol heat. Incredible beer, definitely a winner if spotted!"
"Pretty good Baltic Porter. Not my favorite but it is worth a try."
"This sucker is pretty damn black; virtually opaque with a light brown foamy head that then turns rocky after a minute, then compresses down to pancake batter. The aroma is carob and chicory with bits of chocolate, coffee, and boozy/ stewed/ dried dark fruit. I'm going to say the flavor is much the same with a metallic edge that at first seems wrong, but quickly gets right. There is a dry, scorched grain character that plays well with the warm alcohol sensation and full body. Too bad it's not 30-40 degrees colder outside right now, not that I want it to be, but this beer would be great to have around in February."
"best baltic porter i've had. not quite opaque, but i don't believe it's supposed to be. coffee with cream colored head that holds very well and leaves very nice lace. nose and taste exhibit chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and a hint of fruit. silky mouthfeel with near perfect carbonation and a nice finish. too easy to drink. i'm going to take advantage of the opportunity, and buy this one as often as i can while it's around. fantastic."
"real nice porter. I'm keepin' a few for desert"
"Pours out black. No light penetrates the edges of the beer. Fluffy, creamy looking head with some big bubbles mixed in. Hugely aromatic with fruitiness, maltiness and slight alcohol. Taste is sweet and fruity and this character is unusual as it starts late. This porter has a big bouquet upfront and the taste starts light, then comes the sweet and fruity. Hops break late like a crashing wave to help dry out the finish, which is still on the sweet side. Hops and roast linger in the aftertaste. Nice little baltic porter."
"D- 7.2% is Very well hidden. This is an absolute treat. I really look forward to having this many times again."
"D- Best part of the beer. In my opinion, just like the Celebrator: dark, but not super heavy and very easy to drink no matter what time of year."
"Overall a great beer. Fantastic with smoked pork chops. Well worth the effort to find and enjoy this beer. A must try hit for the style."
"D- Quite nice. This beer goes down real easy."
"Great beer, I enjoyed this."
"Wine Specialist/$3.25/330ml"
"A modest sweetness sits up at the tip of the tongue and grows as it warms which really provides a good base for the other notes to rest on and doesn't dominate. Espresso, bittersweet chocolate, and more dark roasted malts are predominant, there are some little flicks of dark fruits in here as well. Below that is a very slightly astringent oak right prior to the finish. Very complex but just plain balanced all along the way. The finish is ever so sweet but transitions to an unexpected hop bitterness note that I didn't catch at first, all of which lingers just enough. Good strong willed carbonation props up a slightly lighter mouthfeel. Great stuff."
"Very drinkable, slow and easy sipper. I wish I had a maduro cigar."
"The smooth creaminess coupled with excellent carbonation make this beer extremely drinkable."
"D: very good. A huge, bitter roasted porter with an equally big grainy coffee lacing. One should be enough to fill you up and leave you satisfied."
"Pours black with a lasting thick, tan head. Aroma of molasses, caramel, and coffee, Taste of caramel and coffee slides into a lasting bitter finish. Tatse is really excelleny here, with a selicious combination of sweet malts and robust hops. Medium mouthfeel. Very nice porter. Mouthfeel could be thicker. That's my only complaint."
"A nice and sippable porter with a nice complexity. Dangerously drinkable. Recommended!"
"Big thanks to deepsouth for sending me a bottle of this in Powerball!"
"Served in a nonic (wise choice). Poured a deep, opaque black. Rocky, cascading mocha-colored head was barely contained in the glass. Good retention, with dense rings of lacing left behind as the head slowly receded. Scents of chocolate and dark fruit. Flavors similar to nose with a pleasant roasty character and a slight hops bitterness that lingers at the end. Surprisingly flat feeling in the mouth considering the generous head; however, nice medium-bodied feel. Very pleasant and drinkable all and all. A nice alternative to an RIS if you're looking for something a little more drinkable with not so big a flavor profile. I'd love to try this on tap."
"This is a very good porter. It definitely leans more towards the complexity of the RIS, but without that stomach walloping alcohol or gravity content."
"Notes: I'd drink this again but won't go out of my way for it. Definitely worth a try."
"This is one fantastic beer. Certainly one that I would choose over any other porter, and over nearly any stout, as well. Outstanding."
"Drinkability is good, but this rich flavor, and the 7.2% ABV would become strong perhaps quickly."
"D: Good but I found it too roasty and bitter for a session beer."
"Thick syrupy appearance with a dark tan head and nice lacing. heavy alcohol on the nose, dark chocolate, coffee, some fruity undertones. I think I can smell some hops as well, but there covered up by the sweetness and the alcohol. Dark chocolate and bitterness in the taste. Coffee as well. Not as complex as I remembered it, or as complex as the nose. A tasty classic though, A precursor to the RIS phenom."
"I thought this was well balanced and was quite impressed."
"Black pour with a quickly fading bubbly fizzy brown head. Smell is a touch of soy, molasses, some figgyness and heavily of peat, much like a scotch ale. Nice medium body that isn't too thin or thick, with a slight worcestershire tastes. Dull fig flavor as well and tastes too much like a peaty, Mcewan's scotch ale or Traquair house to me. Nicely made beer, but the flavors just aren't for me."
"Recommended..."
"Bottle poured a jet black with a tall dark tan bubbly head with heavy lacing left after each sip. It smells of dark roasted malts, dark bittersweet chocolates and coffee. The taste is full of roasted malts and bitter chocolates with hints of fruits or raisons. It has a nice chewy texture that finishes smooth and slightly dry. Very nice and balanced taste and texture. Good solid porter."
"Carbonation is pretty smooth but the finish is sticky. The metallic note also hampers the drinkability."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Carbonation is good. It is smooth and quite drinkable at 7.2%. Overall, this is good porter. Recommended."
"Notes: Best before date is obliterated. Not sure how old this is. I just bought it at Olivers in Albany, but the label was pretty scuffed up, so I wonder if it's been sitting around for awhile."
"D: Very easy to drink and very tasty. I've only had a few of this style but I think this one will be hard to top. Thanks again, Mike."
"Overall, an excellent example of a somewhat uncommon style that bears only slight similarity to the other porter variants. Well worth seeking."
"As far as the style, very drinkable, with a complex taste and great feel. The 7.2%abv is not overwhelming and would allow me to drink one or two more with ease. I couldn't ask for much more from this beer."
"Next, please!"
"This is a good beer, but lands a little shy of greatness. Nice complexity here but it lacks that ""magic"" that I was expecting. Then again, I've been spoiled by Dark Lord..."
"330ml bottle served in a brandy snifter. Poured an opaque black with quickly dissipating tan head. Not a lot of carbonation. Fruity aroma with some cocoa and molasses. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Plenty of malt, slightly sweet. Some roasted malt. A little hop bitterness in the middle and finish to balance the malt. Long dry lingering finish of coffee. Good stuff."
"goodnight."
"Deep, dark color with a very nice cocoa tan head on top. Low, slight roasted aroma. Very good, almost meaty roasted flavor. Nice graininess to it. Somewhat mild espresso tinge. Decent solid body. Very, very good baltic porter. More bite in it then some I have had but very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Highly recommended."
"Overall, this is very drinkable and very enjoyable. Its complex without being pretentious. If you like Guiness, you'll probably love this, and that says a lot for this beer. Just think BIG STOUT and less porter for this offering."
"Saw this brew the other day and decided that I would give it a try, not sure what I was getting as I have never heard of the brewery before. The brew poured to a dark black color with a medium sized dark tan head that has nice retention and left a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is very nice, lots of roasted with a slight burn malt note. Also chocolate, slight black liquorish, dark fruit - raisin and plum? The taste is quite nice, coffee and chocolate immediately come to mind. Slight sweet note bit more of a bitterness that lingers in the mouth. Some alcohol flavors come through but are very welcoming. Brew has a slight astringency to the feel at the end kind of charcoal like. Wow, I really stumbled onto something here, this brew is simply fantastic and so drinkable. This brew has completely caught me off guard and simply has to be one of the finest brews I have ever had. Simply amazing."
"This beer was such a comfort to drink. Really an outstanding beer."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Pours a pitch black with a dark tan head. Nose is a sweet sugary malt with extremely faint roasted bean (coffee and cocoa) qualities to it. Flavor is very unique. Smooth and tough. On the very tail end I get a strong almost tarred earth aftertaste that lingers in my mouth. But before that comes I get a strong silky smooth lightly roasted porter. Feel is thick and with good bubble. It has only been a few minutes and I am halfway through it. Extremely drinkable. An absolutely beautiful brew."
"Taste is roasted and has great malt bitterness, coffee, cacoa and mocca (this comes closest). The malts offer a nice malt bitterness without being burned. Body is slightly sticky and aftertaste is dry and lingering roasted."
"A damn good beer, this. I suppose it's my first ""authentic"" Baltic Porter, being that it's from Eastern Europe and has a name that I can't pronounce. Of the few beers of this style that I've had, this is certainly one of the best, although not quite as good as the year-old Gonzo I've had, IMO. Still, this is a very good beer and is recommended to anyone, especially fans of the style."
"HOLY SHIT!!!, what a porter. I can't beleive it. I bought this on a whim, and i got super lucky. it pours deep dark brown with a tan head. it smells wonderful, even I can smell the roasted malts in this. it tastes like a standard porter should and then some with a nice full taste and a lingering smooth finish. the mouth-feel is smooth crisp, just plain perfect. and i could most likely polish off a case before i knew where the beer went. if you like porter or really any dark beer, try this, you will be very happy with it"
"D- Very drinkable beer, taste is excellent, smell is a wonderful experience and the mouthfeel makes this an all around excellent beer. This is a beer that I most definately plan on consuming again."
"Overall this was very nice and unlike anything I have had before. A very full bodied porter with a decidely big flavor and a very nice long lasting finish. I really thought this was great and I am glad I have another!"
"Overall- Damn, I like a good porter and this is definitely one. 2 of these to finish the night would be nice."
"d: Alcohol is well masked. Exceptionally drinkable, a total session beer. Its enjoyable, but nothing really jumps out at ya."
"Pours out black with a big frothy chocolaty head that takes its time before lacing to a thin layer. Looks spectacular. Smells of bakers chocolate, dark fruit, and roasty malt. The taste is crazy, in a very good way. Starts roasty, then transitions into bakers chocolate, then the dark fruit kicks in then washed away by a hop bite that dissapears to a coffee but silky flavor. So smooth in the mouth with a tickle of carbonation. I could drink these all night long."
"The way the flavor slinks through a complex series of blended elements is, in a word, art. It caresses and lulls, but keeps you with it along the way. The ABV is an after-thought, and I don't care how big or little it is, though it is rather middle-of-the-road. Id' gladly drink as many of these as the next morning could handle. A magic wand touched this one, and the incantation is all that."
"I'll have to be generous with my ratings as my less-than-stellar pour screwed things up a bit. The head on this thing was huge; so much so that it overflowed my tumbler. Had I poured right, the head would be substantial, fluffy and gorgeous tan over an opaque black body. Looks like a stout really. Mouthfeel suffered as well, seeming a bit flat, but I'll chalk that up to the agressive pour. Instead I'll focus on the taste, which was chocolatey and rich but simpler than I expected from this most hallowed of Porters. Doesn't approach the incredible deliciousness of Perkuno's Hammer in my memory, but tasty nonetheless. Finish was just bitter enough to keep me sipping away. Nice."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, forming a 1/2"" brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades slowly, with plenty of slow-falling lace. Aroma is dark grains and licorice. Taste follows the nose, with some coffee grind-type bitterness as well. Mouthfeel oddly seems a bit watery, but this one's still plenty drinkable. Not bad, but not quite what I was expecting."
"Drinkability- This is a really really solid brew. Very approachable with great flavor, body and very easy drinking. This brew is definitely deserving of its rating and worth the $3.99 tag that is still stuck to the side of the bottle. Thanks again for tpd975 for this wonderful brewsky."
"Overall: Thank you HimerMan for this great beer. I really liked it. This is the first beer I have reviewed from Finland."
"I was licky to find this vintage 1998 gem at Kahn's in Indy. Pours to an old fet black oil body with an inch of chocolate brown head. Nose is a warm rich malty feel with roasty chocolate notes, hints of toffee and maple are noticeable too. As I take first sip it is as if it had been aged in oak as the wood notes are very present. Mineral malty feel is even and balanced. 7.2% alchol is nowhere in the taste. It is a bit mettalic in flavor in a real old vintage kind of way. Mouthfeel is rather thin and balanced by a slight hop hint that fades fast. This is very bood but maybe a bit past its prime. I would like to try a 2000 or so vintage to test this theory."
"This is really a solid, tasty and easy to drink beer."
"Hear a lot about this porter, so I picked up a single to try this past weekend. Poured it into a widemouth tulip, and was impressed by the huge frothy head and the chocolate brown color. My first sip was a bit of a let down though. It was good, but it didn't blow me away. I let it warm up a bit, and same thing: nice porter, but I guess I expected a lot. I'd buy one from a store again for a few bucks, but I am glad that I didn't spend $7 or $9 as I've seen on menus at beer bars."
"the beer's finish is a bit winey, and bitter. the tastular experience is quite different from what my nose went through, lacking some of the richness with which i was first impressed."
"D: This is deserving of it's rating with the exception of the aroma IMHO. Everything else is great."
"Full, creamy mouthfeel..definitely on the rich side for a porter, but it's oh-so-good. It's certainly worth trying one of the best porters the world has to offer."
"Drinkability is good easy drinking very tasty and enjoyable, will be buying this one again."
"Slow down, and appreciate each sip."
"Drinkability - This was a great beer which I picked up at Martin Wine Cellar for $1. Nobody liked it I guess so they had it on their discount rack. Lucky me I picked up 4 and used one to cook with!"
"This is a very good porter even with the alcohol content. A little plus with this outstanding winter beer."
"Regardless, all in all a very solid brew, and one you should certainly pick up if you see it on the shelf."
"because this is a very rich and thick brew, the drinkability isn't its strong point, but this one delivers on the flavor complexity and appearance to kill with the best of them."
"Overall, pretty nice. I don't think it's worth all the hype though. I would happily take a bottle of Gonzo or Southampton Imperial Porter for the same price or less. It's a solid beer and worth trying, but don't go out of your way for it."
"Drinkability is high here dispite the abv. Great tasting and wonderful aftertaste make for a great session beer."
"I need to try this fresh, but I am very happy with it as is."
"This beer poured thick and oily looking with a huge rocky brown head. The aroma is strong of malt with some chocolate/caramel characteristics. The taste is malty and sweet. Some roasted and chocolate flavors are noticeable along with a little bitterness. The mouthfeel is very full and a bit chewy. Overall this is a beer with bold flavors that are well balanced  making it quite easy to drink."
"Thanks to Sam's for this suggestion. Chilled and poured out into a nonic, just under one finger of creamy milk chocolate head develops. Lacing is already apparent and retention is decent. Body is black and completely opaque. First sniff is very complex, notes of figs, anise, raison, dirty cocoa, subtle hints of roasted walnuts maybe even coffee, but very faint and only in the back end. Hops are very subdued in the nose, I can detect them faintly, but can not detect which they are for sure. Taste is just as complex and delicious. The flavor is well shaped by bottle conditioning which has made wonderful space for many subtle nuances to become apparent. Roasted malt is more apparent in the flavor than in the smell same with the cocoa. Slightly fruity at first and then quickly taken over by the roasted malts, the subtle bitterness manifests toward the early middle and then again on the finish. The malt and hop balance is very good, its obviously malt forward, but the IBU was obviously not for gotten about. For me it could it could stay where it is, but it would be interesting to taste it 5 points back ward. ABV on is makes it not quite a session beer, but perfect to have two to three during a meal or just one for a snack. Mouth feel is wonderful perfect for the style, lots of complex big flavors, but not over done in the least. This is an excellent food beer as all good porters should be. I just ate some Gruyere with fig jam, great pairing, but obviously this would be great with barbecue or even spareribs. Its taken me a long time to get porters, but now I love them so dearly especially this one. Thank the Elfin lords it is brewed all year round."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice small tannish head, which then leaves some small islands and sticky lacing. The nose is malty, figs, raisins, slight toffee/coffee, and some caramel. The taste is very nice, slightly sweet, malty, some dark fruits going on, and a nice touch of caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is one fine baltic porter, highly recommended."
"Awesome. Lovely baltic porter, wish I could see more of the style. Preferred evening sipper, recommended on all fronts."
"Got in a trade with Bort11 - thanks! Poured from a 33cl bottle that I let warm up a bit into a pint glass. The bottle had no dating system and since in a trade don't know if fresh or cellared. It poured a deep black with mahogany fringes when against the light. It had a good size head that was brown in color. It slowly settled to a collar with no lacing which was surprising. The aroma was roasted malts with dark chocolate aroma as well. Also had a strong sweet smell that I couldn't pin down. The taste was really good and smooth. Since don't know age of bottle not sure if that's the way it is or if it has mellowed over time. Either way it's good. While I enjoyed the taste, for me this is a one per session and maybe once a year beer. Falls into the category of tastes great and drinkable but not a beer that I can have over and over like my hefes, wits and saisons. With that said still highly recommend. (4, RB-OAY, T, Y)"
"D - A pleasant and Masterful brew of wordly porportions. Nuance that exemplifies the taste of Baltic porter as a style. Carbonation supports the maltiness flawlessly and allows elements of spice, hops, and milky smooth textures to shine. I have and will continue to seek out this magnificent specimen. One of the Premier Porters of the world."
"I loved this beer. Vintage 2000, and at 7 years old, it has kept up incredibly well. Part of the B UNITED vintage portfolio. This beer has a dark, almost ruby red appearence and is very smooth, yet has the robust flavour you look for in a Baltic Porter. Incredible malt tone, I can truly say this one of the best Porters I've ever had. Can't wait to try the fresh version. Highly recommend Chris"
"D - This is an outstanding beer, especially for the price. I loved the sweet chocolate flavor with roasted malts."
"Drinkability - all in all, quite tasty and a top choice in my book."
"D: Very tasty, goes down very easily, slightly filling but not enough that it would prevent you from knocking a few of them back, very good representation of style, this is a very good beer that I good stick with for a while."
"Overall: Very different from any porter ive had, although i havent had many. This beer is complex and certainly a sipper. If you like porters, this is a must try."
"A good Baltic porter I've been wanting to try for awhile now. Glad I finally did. I'll be picking up more of these in the future."
"Poured an opaque black with a thin tan head that diminished. The aroma was of dark malt with some chocolate and molasses with just a tinge of hops in the background. The taste was very complex for a porter. There was the usual dark malt and chocolate, but an interesting bitterness provided depth. The beer was medium bodied and the alcohol was hidden. This is an enjoyable beer, just not something I'd drink that often."
"Drinkability: A bit on the sweet side, but good."
"One of my favorite brews all around."
"Poured from a 33cl bottle into my Adnams tulip pint glass. Appears a dark opaque brown color with about two fingers of tan foam. Smells of molasses, milk chocolate, prunes, and a hint of smoke and anise. Tastes of booze filled chocolate covered cherries and molasses, followed by bitter coffee and cocoa powder. Medium to full bodied with great carbonation. This is a rich and satisfying beer. I could see myself enjoying a few of these in a sitting. Give it a try if you can."
"Truely a beer that you should seek out."
"Pours extremely dark and rich with a thick tan head. Faintly smoky in the aroma and flavor- absolutely delicious. A very smooth and well done beer, an easy drinker for sure. This is an excellent example of the style- very highly reccomended if you can get your hands on it."
"This isn't often available here, but I've got several saved up - I'm going to cut this review short, and go have another. IMO, you should too."
"if price were no factor, this would be a staple beer. at approximately $3 per bottle though, this will have to be an occasional treat. perhaps for the best. this is to be savored."
"Drinkability/Notes: What a fantastic Porter. Very complex with an array of flavors and aromas. Chocolate, cherries, burnt toast, coffe just to name a few. Has a really nice roastiness in the finish along with a linger hop bitterness. Definitely a beer to savor and let warm up from the fridge. This beer really opened my eyes. One of the more complex and delicious beers I've had recently. Highly recommended. Seek and enjoy !!"
"Poured from the bottle (a slightly roughed up bottle) into a pint glass, beer is black as night and has a two-finger, frothy, brown-cream colored head. Smell is of chocolate malt and a bit of smoky alcohol. The taste starts slightly sweet and transitions to a very bitter, dry, coffee finish. This bottle seems a little off too, there is a metallic taste throughout. The mouthfeel seemed sort of light; medium bodied with very little carbonation. This is a pretty drinkable Porter, I'd like to try it again, maybe a bottle that didn't have such a hard life."
"Yeah, its good, but is it $4.29 per bottle good? For my cheapie arse, not really. Id rather spend $9 on a sixer of almost as good US stuff."
"D: This has lots of potential, but I would like this one a whole lot better with less carbonation. As it stands, the texture is a bit too rough to drink very much of this."
"Looove the mouthfeel. Creamy yet crisp and just the perfect body that makes it feel sturdy yet totally consumable. I'd be happy to have a few more."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The thin carbonation complements the heavy weight in the mouth... it's still a bigger beer, and should be approached that way. For a strong porter like this, I would have liked to have more complexity and balance to marvel at. Much more intriguing before the swallow than after."
"D: So well rounded and with exceptional balance. This porter completely changed my perceptions of the style. A plethora of fantastic flavors and aromas. Incredible!"
"Tastes roasty again, very chocolaty and malty. A big porter, leaning toward stoutish tendencies. A nuttiness pairs with the roasty qualities in the aftertaste. Thin mouthfeel, very easy drinking. Recommend for sessioning if you can find it for a good price. No negative qualities to report...this bottle i've had for a year, probably not recommended for cellaring at extended periods."
"Very enjoyable porter, I'll have to remember to get more."
"Man was this black! I couldn't hope for a darker porter. Head was tiny but very dense. Nose is full of plum skin, molasses, and licorice. Taste is the same but there's just the barest hint of roasty smokiness in the finish. Definitely a great porter!"
"D - This goes down as smooth as a session brew but with the flavor (and alcohol content) of a big complex brew. A pleasure to drink."
"Mouthfeel was superb. Creamy. Medium to low carbonation. Slick and rich without being cloying. I would highly recommend this beer."
"Then a sting of hops and a light fruitiness shines thru. The finish is really smooth and dry,with a hint of dark chocolate."
"EDIT 6-8-08: Not alot coming through on the aroma still. It's a bit more rounded with a distinct nuttiness, but you still have to search for any chocolate or caramel. The taste is similar but with an alcohol bite that seems odd for a beer that's 7.2%. On the good side, the head keeps itself most of the way down leaving tons of lacing. Looks perfect."
"A masterful example of the style. The first baltic porter that I could see drinking everyday."
"A beer geek's beer, for sure, and it helps if youre a big roast malt fan. I am, and I found this to be an excellent beer, just not one for the masses."
"Pours a dark, dark black, darker than a cola. Not much of a head. The taste was quite different from other porters that I have tried in the past. A sligjt tartness accompanied the usual smokey coffee porter flavor. The mouthfeel was slightly more bubbly than the typical porter, a variation that might be the cause for the tartness. I'm not a huge porter fan, but I liked this more than most porters. I'd try this again."
"If you like the sweetness of baltic porters (which is something I love), go for okacim. If you want the roastyness, this is your baltic porter."
"Pours out a viscous coal black body with a stout chocolate milk head that leaves healthy rings of lacing. Smells like a robust chocolate milk, coffee, molasses bread. Starts off with a mix of dark chocolate, raisins, and pumperknickle with a middle of strong coffee flavors. Finishes with a clean maltiness (I'm to assume this has been lagered) and a lingering bitterness. The aftertaste is of cane syrup soaked biscuits. Mouthfeel is full, viscous, chewy, and has a very soft and mellowed out carbonation. Drinkability is solid, but can be a little much at times."
"Pours pure black with a light tan head. Smells of sweet soy with a touch of vanilla and a little sour roastiness on the finish. Taste is roasty and sour with some sweet coffee notes. Almost reminiscent of a milk stout. The finish is even a little sweeter. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and a little less thick than you might guess from looking at it. Quite good and drinkable, but not quite so complex as I remember it being in the past."
"Thanks to my Secret Santa, numenor1, for the opportunity to experience this."
"A very dark brown/black beer. No light passes thu at all and great lace. Some chocolate notes at first in the aroma with a big roasted malt character dominating. A lot of bittersweet chocolate in the taste with hints of coffee. The finish has a tantalizing dry smokey character."
"D: A fine sipping beer of excellent quality. I'd certainly get this again, but keep it cellared a while; also it's a rich flavor/style that I'd like on occasion but not too frequently. Ultimately, however, this porter certainly gets my seal of approval."
"One of the better porters on the market today."
"1998 bottling. I was told this was a special thing to try, so i bought one and drank it side to side with this year's version. pours black with only a hint of transparancy. brown head rises out of nothingness and then mostly disappears again, leaving just a ring around the glass. Looks great and liquor-like. Smell has sherry, cherries, some chocolate. smells boozy and rich. Taste is pretty amazing and quite different from the fresh bottle. Fruity (cherries and plums) and velvety up front with a coffee finish coming through later. The burnt coffee flavor is less strong than in the fresh version and compliments the rest of the flavor nicely. Somewhat thinner than i expected, based on how it looked, but very well balanced and smooth. Very nice overall. A different beast than the fresh version."
"Overall, an outstanding offering that is truly in a class of its own."
"Drinkability is very good. This is very enjoyable and easy to drink in large quantities. A very well-rounded porter."
"Overall, a decent, drinkable beer, but unremarkable."
"Drinkability: Well folks, its a good beer! You don't want to miss it. Its the chimney soot that does it."
"1997 bottling. Got it at Paradiso in Georgetown, but none left, sorry. One of the best porters i've had in ages. If not the best, it was the best balanced. It smelled like an expresso with a bit of chocolate notes in there. The palate was much the same. It had a bit of an oiley taste to it, but the chocolate and expresso taste lasted through for about a minute after this beer finished. The oiley finish allowed for all the flavors to linger for at least a minute making this an easy sipping beer. The mouthfeel begs for more. All the flavors were incredibly balanced making this an incredibly savory beer. Please drink if you can."
"Taste is surprisingly sour, although still rich and round. Coffee, plums, and alcohol are the major players in the taste. Creamy, mellow finish with sharp hit of alcohol at the tail end. Texture is smooth but a little overcarbonated at the front of the sip. This beer grows on me as I sip it but there are a few BPs I'd choose over it."
"Highly recommended. Not quite the match of Okocim Porter, which has a richer mouthfeel and a bit more figginess, but still a very fine Baltic Porter. Get some today!"
"Pours inky black, with a tan head that stays around for a while. Smell is of dark malt and port wine. The taste is dark malt with faint coffee, bourbon and port. The finish is a slight tartness with a nice nutty quality. This beer has a medium-full mouthfeel. Very big and robust with nice dark complex malts."
"D - Alcohol is well hidden and this is my go to porter when I am at the Map Room."
"D: Excellent baltic porter. One of the best things to come from Finland, since my hot Finnish au-pair when I was about 10."
"Poured an opaque black with one of the darkest heads I've ever seen. Aromas of burnt coffee and what seemed like black olives. Immediate yeasty tang on the tongue follwed by the chocolatey coffee malts with a nice lasting hop character at the end. Sweet and sour raisens stayed on the tongue long after each sip. Mouthfeel was good, with a heavy brew feel balanced by the moderate carbonation- interesting texture. A little sour for this type of porter for my taste, but good overall."
"Upon pouring this porter into the 16 ounce tumbler I immedialy noticed the nice head which had good retention. I thought this was an excellent porter. The taste was rich and thick with a mingling of coffee and a roasted taste that made me want to keep the beer in my mouth without swallowing. The porter was also well liked by others in the room, some who are only ""okay"" with porters. The reason stated was that it was smooth with no bitterness."
"Poured into a pint glass and had a black color, with a dark tan, thick head. Excellent lacing. Appearance was exceptional with this beer. The smell was mostly roasted, and coffee-like with not much else. The taste followed the smell with roasted/coffee flavors dominating and a slight touch of sweetness in the aftertaste. Was expecting something a little more complex. I thought it was very full-bodied and very smooth on the mouth. A very drinkable beer, but missing some complexity in the taste. Overall a very solid brew."
"Overall, I found this beer quite a step down from Okocim and even Duck Rabbit. I was quite surprised, after seeing the high rating it has attained. Maybe I just had a bad bottle, but I was not impressed by this beer."
"One of the best porters I have ever had (if not the best)."
"Pours a deep dark pitch black with a tan colored head that turns into a thin lace that sticks to the sides of the glass. The nose is a really pleasant malty aroma with some coffee, caramel and a touch of dark fruits. Taste is exceptionally smooth that starts out roasty with a lot of malt that finishes dry and somewhat bitter. Overall, this is a fine brew that is recommended to anyone who can get their hands on it."
"Get it if you can find it!"
"The pour into my La Moneuse tulip raises a very dark tan two finger head with large bubbles and slick lacing, above a mysterious opaque body. The head falls at an average rate to a glass ring. The nose is very malty sweet and alcoholic, with raisins and other dark fruits leading to a cloying odor. There's also a strong roasted scent. The taste is at once toasted and sweet, smooth and acidic. Finishes with a mild anise flavor. This is quite mild, but enjoyable. The body is heavy, with fairly low carbonation. A nice drinker, but not a standout that I'll seek again."
"What a beautiful beer to pour. It leaves the bottle like oil -- thick, black, and eerily still -- and settles into the glass to form a dark brown head. The brew smells burnt, with a hint of raisins, and a strong stale ale component. I was worried that the sour flavor would overpower the others, but to my delight it is just one part of a complex profile. (That profile is made up of the conventional porter flavors, but they are exceptionally balanced.) The Sinebrychoff Porter is lightly carbonated, with one of the most pleasant, substantial mouthfeels I have ever experienced. I wish I had had more than just dark chocolate to eat with it -- I'm sure other foods would highlight other flavors."
" At one point I disliked this style, but based on this and southhampton's, i've changed my mind. In fact, i may have to revisit Okocim porter."
"Very easy drinking and tasty beer."
"Actually had this as a Sinebrychoff Porter IV, bottled in 1997. Poured to a jet black, with medium tan head and very good lacing. Initial aroma of malty toffee, with hints of chocolate. As beer warmed, alcohol also made its presence known in the aroma. This beer is fdefinitely better as it warms at mid-glass. Finish at first is metallic, but later on is smooth and rich. I hope I can find another of this kind and age."
"Black with an ultra dark brown sugar colored head which is rather thick and holds a bit but does have rather large bubles. Impressive and a bit unique looking. Aroma is distinctly according to style, german lager kind of aromas--a bit sweet, with gentle grassy hops. Surpsingly, no alcohol aroma detected. The taste is very distinct, a baltic porter but with a very charred and gritty black malt up front--more of the standard stout and charred porter characteristics, and drinking it makes me think a bit of Otter Creek Stovepipe porter. After the upfront charred note it turns into your standard baltic porter with the lager characteristics, the middle and finish standard in flavor, but rather full. Mouthfeel is medium full, not as light as other baltic porters, with good carbonation--well done here. Overall this is very drinkable and no alcohol detected in aroma or flavor. I'm not into this style, but this is a superb version for those who do, if you ignore the price tag."
"33 cL bottle with no freshness date, despite the fact that the label says ""best before"" in three languages. It pours as black as a dank imperial stout and has a finger of orangey/brown head. Almost dares you to drink it. Smells of chocolate, coffee, cocoa, roasty malts, currants, blackberries, and otherwise sweet malts. It has a big roasty/burnt flavor with dark berries and lots of IBUs from the green hops and the roasty/coffee malts. In addition, theres sweet and smoky malts, charcoal, tobacco juice, some acidity, old leather, and maybe some piney spice. The body is medium and a bit drying, a little numbing, and leaves a looong roasty/coffee finish. Overall quite nice - would go great with barbecue. However, it's probably better with age as the IBUs are still a bit too prevalent."
"D: It seems bigger than it actually is."
"drinkability is great. i love a nice porter, and this one is really nice. hides its 7.2% abv well and goes down smooth. need to get some more of this one."
"Poured bottle into a pint glass, the look of this was amazing nice pitch black color with a fluffy tan colored head that stayed the entire drink. Smell is roasted malt with roasted almonds as well, hints of coffee as well, this smells awesome. The Taste is better than the smell it is a big beer with a nice after ton, very full flavored has coffee taste with roasted malt and roasted nuts, very good and top notch qualiyt put into this brew. Highly recommend."
"Very black color, especially dark for a porter, with no light shining through. Thick, reddish-tan head that holds up well leaving frothy goodness to accompany me throughout the experience. Aroma could be a bit stronger, very sweet and coffee-like to the nose. A nice, biscuity coffee taste and fine dark chcolate sweetness starts out the flavor, yielding to a wonderfully roasty, bitter finish with superb dryness. Excellent mix of flavors and balance, almost perfect. Compared to appearances the mouthfeel is only lightly thick. There is a nice creaminess with its bubbly carbonation. I loved this beer, especially with its enjoyable finish. I could drink several of these..."
"Drinkability: I admit that I was too anxious to try this, as it seems to be universally enjoyed, but I just don't think that it is on target."
"33 cl bottle . very dark brown almost totally black beer with a tan head , with some purplish tinges..looks great. Mostly toasted malty aromas , but some funky fruitiness there too. Good flavours of figs,raisins, 70% cocao Dark chocolate and actually quite a hop presence compared to others in this category. Pretty exciting on the tongue..though the carbonation is per haps a touch to much. Not the Best Baltic but probably the most authentic I have had..good but not great."
"Edit: Ok, I didn't realize this was a Baltic Porter, or understand the ramifications of it. I'm just going to pretend like it's an imperial irish stout. :)"
"My first baltic porter, pretty intense stuff here. Pitch black pour, can't see through it with a nice brown head. Smells a bit liek chocolate malts. Tastes like burnt malts, cocoa, some dry bitterness. Good mouthfeel Overall it is eally nice, but one for an evening is enough. This is a lot like a imperial stout, but hey I'm not complaining."
"Very good, maybe a little weak in body, but extremely tasty."
"Very drinkable, really enjoyed this. Baltic porters rule!"
"Great Baltic Porter, just a bit too sweet. Recommended."
"This beer pours jet black with a creamy tan head that dissipates to a thin film but leaves some nice lace down the glass. The smell is a mixture of a dopplebock-esque and oatmeal. The taste is just great. It hits you first with the creamyness from the oatmeal but follows up with what I can only assume is dark roasted german malts. The alcohol was less prevelant in the 1998 than the 2000. There is a little bit of roasted coffee lingering in there. The mouthfeel is very creamy and thick with an even carbonation. Overall it is a highly drinkable beer. A great one to pick up."
"Sinebrychoff Porter pours a deep, dark brown that shows a little ruby at the edges from a brown 33cl bottle. The head is tan and fluffy. I pick up some raison and some alcohol in the nose while the beer is still cold. Malt is also noticeable. Strong malt flavor with some esters thrown in at first. Some chocolate notes also present. A complex beer for sure. Recommended."
"This is from an 11.2 ounce bottle, with no freshness date that I could find on it. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a half inch brown head which went away pretty quickly. It's a very, very nice looking beer. It smells like malt, molasses, coffee and chocolate. It tastes mainly like coffee and chocolate, with a bit of sherry in there as well. Good bit of a lasting bitter aftertaste as well. It has a medium, oily/slick mouthfeel, with little carbonation. Even with the alcohol content of this beer, it's still easy to drink. This is a very good beer, I'd definitely buy one again and I would recommend it to others to try."
"D- Very big and robust with nice dark complex malts. I will be on the look out for any more of these bottles hidden around local beer stores."
"Worth a shot, moderate price, Cheers."
"What a nice beer. Pitch black with a short tan head and a little lacing. Smells and tastes of rich chocolate with a bit of roasted malts and sherry. Reminds me of a nicely aged Brooklyn Chocolate Stout. The palate is rich, but light. I was hoping for a little more complexity, but overall I'm impressed."
"Edit: Drank the '98 in February, 2007, with northyorksammy, grub, biegaman, and derek. Has held up really well - a little soy sauce, but still very drinkable. However -- wouldn't leave this much longer."
"-SS"
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Not as Baltic-y as some of the others Ive had, but this works very well on its own, and has its own merits. Great flavor without being overpowering. Certainly worth getting to know better!"
"This is a very drinkable beer. I wish I could have afforded to stock up on these."
"I highly recommend this lovely porter!"
"D - There is no hint of the 7.2 percent in this beer. Simply amazing."
"Bottled in 2000. Unlike many other reviewer's samples, this bottle doesn't look very beat up at all. Pours quite black and impenetrable, with a thin bubbling light-cocoa foam cap. Aromas of plums, chocolate cake batter, and a dusty smoke scent. Taste begins sour, then expands into a delicious chewy chocolate flavor. The finish is bitter and earthy with understated hops and a light smokiness. Medium-thin body, silk-smooth mouthfeel. This can be easily (if not entirely accurately) described as a top-notch Russian Imperial Stout by flavor and a Dry Stout by body and mouthfeel. Incredible taste -- I can't believe how well this has held up over six years. Absolutely deserving of all the praise it gets. Hands down the best Baltic Porter I'll have for a while."
"There is something mature and well developed about this porter. This is simply a really good version of a Baltic Porter."
"Taste; the coffee and dark fruits really come out on the first few sips, along with a bit of licorice. There's a strong roasted maltiness, with some touches of wood and a little alcohol. The chocolate character starts to come through as this gets warmer. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, and so drinkable I wish I had several more."
"Drinkability: easy drinking, even though the alcohol is slightly noticeable and this heavier in body. Great beer, got to get more."
"Really a fantastic baltic porter. Complex with overtones galore. Highly recommended and I beer I wouldn't hesitate to have again."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: Dam! This beer is full bodied. The beer has a minimalist carbonation. Just one malty beer treat. A dam fine drinking beer."
"Understandable of why this is among the best porters on BA. It offers a big combinaiton of flavors in a managable body. An opaqued burned brown color with an amazing brown moist foamstand to match. Mouthwatering in its roasted grain and chocolate aromas. Less sweet to the taste than I expected, but big of it's flavor profile. Toasty, roasty, cocoa, and a little camp-fire-ish without being smoky. Powdery and charcoal like to the palate without becomming harsh or burned in flavor or feel. Finishes very, very clean despite a usual grain acceptance. The 7+ alcohols are hardly detectable--neither hot, nor phenolic. Balanced with light hopping and roasted grain. High attenuation leads to a lighter beer, but keeps it's bold flavors. Tremendous beer. Only the light fermentation, that reminds me of lactose, and light body keeps me from serving up a 5.0"
"As with most baltic porters i've tried, this thing needs a moment to air out in the glass to reach ultimate drinkabilty, otherwise that ""metallic"" tinge is just too pronounced. Earthy and smoky - at the right temp, it becomes really tasty."
"This is a damn good Baltic Porter. It has porter qualities, like chocolate and fruits, as opposed to coffee like, like a stout. Mouthfeel is really nice, hops are low, and alcohol warmth is there. A winner by all standards. (Well mine, anyway!)."
"Vintage 1998. Purchaced from Premier Gourmet, here in the Town of Tonawanda. Pours black. Thin pale brown head,and nice lace.Smell is of roasted malts, figs and alcohol. Body is medium, with a bit of carbonation. Taste is smooth and rich.Well balanced malts through and through.Somthing about this reminds me of rum rasin. Wow!"
"I was totally blown away by this porter!!!! Terrific looking brew! Giant, three finger tall head. Tan colored and very frothy, fades after a few minutes. Clumpy, spotty lacing around the glass. Strong roasted malt smell, with hints of alcohol. Reminds me of malted milk balls. Very sweet and very well balanced. A definite treat! By far the best tasting porter I've had. Lots of carbonation and silky smooth. Even though this has an abv. of 7.2%, I could enjoy this brew all night long! Highly recommended!!!!"
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a medium dark creamy had with very good retention. Aroma of chocolate is omnipresent with a nice touch of bitterness. Body is full and has a nice creamy texture that is very enjoyable. Taste is also dominated by the chocolate malt with nice light bitter ending. Very nice example for the style and probably even better then Okocim."
"Prefer a bit fresher than 8 years old. Glad I tried it."
"A truely great porter suitable for the Baltic winters."
"Overall: This is a very nice and flavorful porter. I'd be interested in doing a side by side comparison with different vintages."
"1997 Vintage  Huge vinous and oak aromas pound their way out of this old but solid brew. Mouthfeel is surprisingly heavy, especially when compared side-by-side with a 2004 vintage (as I am doing). Taste is dominated by molasses, thick, sugary coffee, and blended prunes. Mildly earthy too. Drinkability is as good as it can be with a Baltic Porter. Appearance is a dark, slightly clouded mahogany-walnut blend."
"D - Sort of sessionable, but a bit strong. It has a powerful flavor that would overshadow many foods. I imagine that it would pair well with most nuts, particularly almonds and macademia nuts. A pleasant beer that I wouldn't mind having again."
"rich and smooth, lightly carbonated. chocolate and raisins/prunes in the flavor with a dark chocolate bitterness and caramelly sweetness. amazingly, richly drinkable, especially as it warms. on par with, or better than, almost any imperial stout."
"To those who think Baltic Porters are the same as a dopplebock I present to you this beer. The coffee flavor is this one is just great. I don't know if there could be a better beer for this style. or any porter for that matter. I love this beer...Finland here I come."
"Very substantial mouthfeel. Towards the end of the beer the head looks like a rootbeer float. Long lasting head. Overall I detect more sweetness and smokiness than roastiness and choclate and while this is still great beer its not ever going to be a favorite."
"D: With its alcohol warmth and coffee tastes, this makes an excellent sipping beer for long conversations or reading a book through a winter afternoon."
"Intimidating black body, with a manila-khaki head. The beer was not very lively, nothing overly jumpy on the nose of mouth. But at 7.2% it went down easily. Just a silky smooth, cigar smoking chair smooth. This beer is widely complex, but at the same time simple, up front and basic. A winner."
"Mouthfeel- A little oily with a medium to heavy body. Leaves a velvety feeling on the palate along with a little roasted bitterness."
"Overall a great beer. I remember liking it more than i like it now. I'll come back to it in the future."
"Pours thick and oily, with a beautiful dark tan head. Great aroma, full of coffee and chocolate malt. Huge flavors -- coffee, immature prune, peppery alcohol, and some caney sweetness (but just a touch). It's these flavors that, I imagine, would meld wonderfully with aging. This porter is thick spicy on the tongue, with a significant alcohol burn. Long aftertaste. Very smooth and quaffable. This is just an excellent beer."
"Drinkability: A great porter, strong, but not over the top, extremely drinkable. Excellent, I suggest you go and try it."
"Vintage 1998 Bottle purchased at Bello Vino in Ann Arbor. Poured out to a dark opaque black color with a small head that quickly vanished. A small tan film is all that is left on the surface of the beer. Low carbonation. Minor notes of lacing. Aromas were strikingly similar to a red wine at first; dark fruits and dark chocolate are first, followed by some roasted characters and mild malts. Taste is nearly exceptional; strong flavors of dark chocolate, followed with a solid medium bodied malt and a raw molasses flavor fill the palate. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with a nominal level of density, yet not thick or syrup-like. Decent drinkability. I'm glad I experienced this one. One of the best in the style I've had. Recommended."
"Drinkability: So thick and complex that it's hard to have just one. But I really have to stop drinking it so fast because it's definitely going down quickly and easily. I paid $2.99 for the bottle, and that was definitely more than worth it. Make sure your palate can handle it though, because this sucker takes no prisoners."
"Pours an inky black with a good a head and good retention. Aroma is slightly of burnt raisins, but also a funky smell that I can't put my finger on. It's almost like that of my dog's treats. Taste is raisiny and chocolatly and a hit of coffee in there too. Mouthfeel is good. Drinkablity.. it's interesting, I will finish this bottle for sure, but I don't know if I'd seek it out again. It's a very clean non-lingering beer."
"Outstanding porter. Finland needs to make more beer..."
"Probably my favorite porter out there."
"dark pour gives off a yellow hue like iodine. skinny ring of foaminess, barely countable. smells like dark chocolate melted in a rich, red wine. unique aroma, appetizing. starts off with a bit of moldy age that morphs into coffeeground bitterness. underlying port character and molasses sweetness offers perfect balance. mildly fruity, barely.. something here whispers butterscotch and a bit of fermented tang in the finish reminds you this is beer. light and smooth, dark and dank, this beer is a perfect evening sipper. leaps and bounds beyond perkuno.. who knew finland was producing anything with flavor?"
"Overall, I'm very glad this was recommended to me. Will definitely need further tastings to try and savor all that this complex porter has to offer."
"Bottled in 1997. This brew pours a thick motor oil black color with no head what so ever. The aroma is very rich. Caramel, chocolate, roasted malt. The taste is largely of roasted malt with chocolate in the back ground. The mouthfeel is full bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, the brew isn't bad, but I think it may be past its prime."
"Pours an intensely opaque black with a thick, creamy/foamy bumpy coffee-colored head that looks like an oatmeal raisin cookie. Mmmm, oatmeal raisin cookie. Anywho, nose is potent fresh coffee grounds, bakers chocolate and dark fruits. Taste starts off with juicy raisins, sweet prunes, apple and grape skins and trasitions into creamy milk chocolate mousse and mocha. Mouthfeel is rich and frothy, coating the mouth with fine bubbly carbonation. This is a damn tasty Baltic porter, the most complex and balanced that I've had to date. Many go overboard with sickly sweet/sour prunes, but the creamy milk chocolate takes over. A pleasant surprise from Finland - not just reindeer anymore."
"Pours an opaque black, big tan head that lasts forever, sticky lace. Smell is sweet molasses, roast, coffee, smoky tobacco, maple, rich maltiness. Taste is super strong roast coffee, cream, bitter chocolate and maple. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, perfect smooth carbonation and one of the best aftertastes ever, especially for a coffee lover."
"Drinkability: A roasted, coffee flavored, bold porter...yeah, that's why I got in to craft beer in the first place. I realize that the line between stout and porter is fuzzy at best and this one does nothing but fuel that fuzziness. I can see why it's highly touted. I think people who don't like porters but like stouts (yeah, I'm talking to you HardTarget!!) would enjoy this one. Strongly recommended for sure..."
"Sinebrychoff Porter is almostsoclosebutnotquite black, just the smallest bit of a red highlight along the bottom. Giant rocky chocolate-colored head that soon settles to a good-looking skim of brown bubbles that hangs around for awhile, providing good lacing. Smell and taste combine gentle roasted flavors with a sweet pruney/raisiny character that grows in prominence as the beer warms. Overall, though the flavor is pleasant but subdued, the former perhaps a result of the latter--too much of the dark fruits character can kill me on some Baltics. Also, the Sinebrychoff hides its alcohol immaculately. A big body and smooth, creamy mouthfeel finish off what is a surprisingly easy-drinking ""big"" beer."
"Pours a viscous inky black with a thick, creamy tan head that retains well and leaves nice lacing, imposing brew. Aroma is roasty with some astringency, dark chocolate, some prune and plum and some mineraly hops. The flavor has an intense roasted character that is a bit astringent and bitter, some unsweetened chocolate, ripe prune and fig, charcoal, and some earthy, organic hops. The is a very interesting beer (reminds me of carnegie porter on steroids), very complex and somewhat bitter and astringent. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected (but true to style), and the drinkability is pretty good with only slight alcohol notes. Excellent traditional baltic porter, has none of the sweet character exhibited by american interpretations but is balanced and complex."
"Overall, Sinebrychoff Porter was a damn nice brew that is one I now consider to set the bar as a premier example of the style. Worth procuring if you see it on the shelf."
"Really enjoyed this beer and savored my way through it."
"Nice, not quite the treat that Okocim Porter is, but definitely a pleasurable Baltic porter in its own right."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Such a wonderfully intense charcoal layer all over bits of dried bing cherry. Whole milk mouthfeel. Licorice root sweetness. Toasted cumin and coriander. Mighty tasty for something the color of Satan's soul."
"In my opinion this porter is a near cousin to an English Stout, and I would like to try another one that is not as well aged."
"Malt sweetness and hop bitterness are balance very well."
"Poured mostly opaque black with red edges and a huge tan head and nice lacing. Mildly metallic coffee aroma. Dark fruits, chocolate coffee, and bitter hops in the taste. Some smoke was also recognized. I think I was expecting too much from this, but it was a beautiful beer regradless, my expectations were just set way too high."
"The scores reflect a mix of both. The appearance of the younger beer was better, while smell of the older beer was far richer. The edge in taste goes to the older beer as well. In the mouthfeel department, there was more going on in the younger beer, but the older was more pleasant. Overall, Id take the older beer as the more drinkable and interesting of the two."
"Tastes super-yummy. Rum soaked raisins surf a roast bitter. A chocolate sweet lies beneath the surface and eventually tangles the bitter to leave a wet sweet. Fruity with some fine chocolate. The aftertaste shows a re-appearance of some of the roast with a touch of cherry sour from black patent. So much happening each time I raise the glass that I can't keep up. Really complex with lotsa individual flavors that combine to make even more flavors to try to keep track of. Md-thick body with a somewhat smooth mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Really enjoyable."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Black with a large dark brown head. The aroma is roasted malts and cocoa. This beer has a big chocolate flavor. Besides the chocolate, there's nuts and vanilla. Big on flavor and so smooth. There is a pleasant hop bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel could be just a little fuller, but it's hard to find fault with a beer this good."
"Nice deep chocolate body with a light, deep beige head that left little lacing down the glass. The aroma is like a malt kick to the face. Nice toasted cocoa and espresso filled the nose. The taste is filled with a bittersweet cocoa and nutty body. Vanilla bean also makes a strong appearance. The mouthfeel is wonderfully rich, like an italian coffee. It becomes a little thin towards the finish. This beer is insanely smooth and deceptively strong. This would definately be one that I would be hitting all nigth if it were on tap on a night out (or in my basement)."
"There wasn't much difference at all between this 1998 and the 2000 that I reviewed a few days ago (http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/264/2758/?ba=Quaffer). They were both excellent beers. About the only difference that I could detect was that the '98 had less of the heavy sweetness to it that the '00 had. It was still there and, on the bright side, its diminished presence didn't make the beer taste any ""thinner."" Just more of the tart fruit and smoke seemed to come through. A little sharper overall, but the scores remained the same. Fantastic."
"Well worth the money spent."
"Pitch black, topped by a dense, creamy, chocolatey head. Lots of lace and great retention. Malty aroma with lots of roasted character, plenty of coffee, sweet smelling. Vinous flavour with a nice combination of dark malts and an earthy, fruity character. Bittersweet chocolate throughout. Coffee really lingers in the aftertaste. Slightly astringent, with a moderately light body and carbonation. Still, quite a creamy texture. Quite a nice beer, quite drinkable with plenty of complexity."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and frothy. Somehow I've run short of words to describe this particular aspect of the beer, but I've been long-winded enough as it is. It's not too highly drinkable as the tastes and alcohol get to be overwhelming after a while, but it was still a great beer if you hadn't already gathered that much."
"Three years old at the time of sampling, and had indeed aged like fine wine. Poured a pitch black. Pleasantly assertive with nearly-burned caramel and prune flavors hitting up front. Dries out a bit toward the middle, and a bit more hops bittering join with the dried, dark fruit flavors at the finish. The alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile. Overall, the body was a bit lighter than the flavor suggested, but this was not a detraction."
"It pours a dark color with a small head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a little chocolate and a little roasted malts, but it's not very strong. The flavor has a lot of chocolate and roasted malts with some hints of dark fruit and sweetness. The finish is bitter from the roasted malts. Fairly thick on the mouthfeel and the drinkability is pretty good. Enjoyable."
"Great great stuff. Worth seeking out."
"Are all the beers in Finland this good?"
"Its been a long time since I trid this brew...It pours a very dark brown to black color with a finger of tan head that falls to a coating over the beer. The color is beautiful. The nose is a little light. I get dark fruit, slight roasty notes and a little sweet chocolate. I would like a little more force in the nose. The flavor is nice. First I get slight roasted and chocolate notes, with a distant fig, but it moves fast to a big roasted creshendo at the end. As it warms, there is much more of a fig tone in there, which I really like. Beautiful. The feel is on the low end of thick. Best part of this beer is that there is no hint of the alcohol at all. Not in the nose or the flavor. This is a truely good beer."
"Overall, a very good beer. I was kind of surprised to find this one at my local store, but I'm glad I did. I will definitely be picking up some more."
"This was perfect at the end of the work week. This beer hides its alcohol strength rather well. I could drink it all night, but at $5+ a pop, I would want to save them, especially since this could taste really tasty if it gets cellared for a while."
"Poured into a snifter with an opaque black color and brown head of 1 1/2"". The head retention is good for a porter, settling down to groups of hearty suds on the surface. Ripe plums, anise, dark chocolate and black coffee in the nose. The balance of flavors relies on how rich the malt character is, and how there is a slight bitterness right at the finish. Medium bodied, with a well toasted malt flavor. This is a fine example of the style, just slightly estery, roasty malt and just a tad bitter."
"Drinkability: Oh, hell yes! One of my personal 5 favorite porters. I'd drink this all day long."
"Mouthfeel is just abou right for a porter in that it heavy and not overly carbonated and it doesn't try to push itself into stout territory either. A very, very nice example of the style."
" This brew pours with a beautiful 1/2-in. dark brown head. The color is like that of looking into a black hole, so dark you can't tell its depth. There is a nice smoked malt character in the aroma along with chocolate notes. The taste was exceptional let me tell you. There is an intense and amazing chocolate creamy, almost indescribable flavor that makes you beg for more. I could taste smoked malt flavors that added to the overall pleasurable mouthfeel of the wonderful brew."
"I can picture enjoying this beer with a few grilled sardines, pickled herrings, a shot of aquavit and some smoked salmon. This is a bold brew that would compliment the lingering oily taste of smoked or pickled fish"
"A dark black pour, with a thick tan head that leaves creamy lacing all the way down the glass. Earthy aromas, tobacco, bitter chocolate, dark roasted coffee, prune. Rich and malty flavors, along with chocolate, espresso, cabernet, molasses. Creamy, full bodied mouthfeel with excellent drinkability. Damn tasty!"
"Overall, this is a great baltic porter and very reminiscent to imperial stout. A definite must, highly recommended."
"From what I understand, this is no longer available in the United States. Too bad, because it's a good beer."
"Sinebrychoffs Porter is a middle-deck homerun."
"The bottle says it's best before 27.06.2003. I'm still giving it a shot. The color is black with a creamy, light brown head. The aroma is lightly of roasted malts with a distinct smoked smell. Taste is of roasted chocolate with an earthy smoked taste. Overall the taste is very good, but just a bit underwhelming. Most of the standard English or American porters seem to have a more engaging flavor, off course this could be because the beer is a little old and probably wasn't aged properly. Mouthfeel is very creamy, which adds to my drinkability. This is great stuff, just a tad unwhelming, I wonder how great it would be fresh or corrrectly aged. I'll be looking for fresher bottles in the future."
"Brown/borderline black in hue, soft and foamy tan head that allows streaky lacing throughout. A delightful aroma of dark roasted coffee beans, chocolate, caramel and even some port/wine notes detected as warming takes affect. Oily smooth, cocoa, chocolate, plums and cherries noted in the initial sips. Burnt malts and a little hop bitterness detected in the middle; very well defined and flavorful. On-going sweetness, just a hint of alcohol, chocolate and espresso notes towards the end. Tasty, and then tasty some more; world class, a truly exceptional porter (an imperial porter?)."
"This is powerful entry to my porter experience, perhaps the best. The mouthfeel is similar to the Samuel Smith pale ales while the flavor is far more dark in a good way--black patent and chocolate malts are very evident."
"Absolute pitch black in color with a quickly disappearing chocolate milk colored head. Aroma is of ripe dark fruits with a nice combination of toasted and patent malts. There is a subtle alcohol nose. The taste is quite complex. The main components are the toasted malts which have subtle hints of coffee. The flavor finishes slightly chocolaty. There is also a nice ripe fruit essence which compliments the other flavors. Mouthfeel is creamy and full with a slight oily character. It coats the mouth well and leaves a pleasant finish lingering around. This is damn good. Thats all I can say. I could easily down a couple of these and enjoy every sip of it."
"Drinkability- Paid more than I wanted for this one, but after I had it, I'd wish I grabbed another couple. This dude was almost 2 years past the best by date and it was still pretty incredible. I'm just coming around into the world of porters, and this may be the one that makes me turn the corner and try more. When I saw on the shelf and looked at the $3.49 price tag, I laughed and almost walked away because it looked like just another one of those euro beers that you have never heard of. Then I thought to myself, heck, I've never seen or heard of this one before and may never see it again. What if it's actually good? I'd kick myself if I got home and read the reviews and they were positive. So, I figured, what the hell, I'll only be out a few bucks if I'm wrong. I'm glad I was right...so glad. Two big thumbs up."
"Pours out an oily black with a slow rising light brown head. Some decent lacing left around the glass. The aroma is quite strong, chocolate malts and dark fruits stand out the most. Lighter notes of roastiness linger in the back. As this warmed the vinous qualities really came on strong. Sweet dark chocolate cover fruits come out in the flavor. There is a touch of alcohol present but the strong vinous qualities covered that. Ends with a dark sweet fruitiness. Medium and slick in the mouth. Very easy drinking brew that I enjoyed quite a bit. A great example of the style that had a good mix of flavors going on. I will definitely be picking this one up again."
"two years later had a 1998 that displayed alcohol as often an aged beer will do, and chocolate. Light crown with bubbles and lace on top of black. Low carbonation. Past its prime."
"Medium brown, small head. Cold coffee look. Cold coffee aroma too, joined with dark chocolate and nougat. Flavor is chocolate tobacco smoke, tar, and pine sap. Fudgy at times with fugglesish flavor. Thick, smooth, dry, the alcohol is present, and it is a bit oily. A good beer, but not as alive as I would like, and not as good as this style can get."
"A beer from finland eh? this is new for me, although I've sampled some American Baltic Porters. This stuff pours out thick & black. Light does not penetrate it. Looks more like an imp. stout to me. Nice tan head. Aroma is heavy on the raisins, with a bit of coffee type maltiness in the background.Taste is quite subtle. There is alot going on here..but it's hard to pinpoint any of it. Definitely some chocolatey/coffee type flavors, along with some alcohol, but nothing is jumping out. The mouthfeel is slick and quite watery. There is decent carbonation but nothing special here. Drinkability is not so hot in my book, but the thin mouthfeel helps a bit. Porters & stouts are not my thing it seems lately."
"This was my first experience with a Baltic outside of Heavyweights Perkuno's Hammer. I would defiantly recommend it and hope to sample a few more authentic examples of the style."
"D-extremely smooth and drinkable- I would love to have a couple more of these."
"Overall: powerful porter. imperial?"
"This one is black as night with a creamy light brown head. Leaves a good amount of lacing. The aroma is malty and chocolatey, with rum soaked dark fruits, bread and a slight bit of roastiness. The aroma is just awesome. The flavor is malty and bready, it then flows to chocolate and dark fruit flavor. Again just a tad bit of roasted malt is present in the flavor. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, almost velvety. It is very drinkable for its strength. An excellent porter. One of my favorites, if not the best one I've yet to have."
"This is good and I'll try it again but I seek a less dry profile."
"Notes: Wow, this is one tasty beer. Definitely a great one for coffee and chocolate lovers. I was a little put off by the nose though, doesn't seem to match well, but an excellent beer nonetheless."
"A helluva beer. I'm a bit surprised by the lack of fruit notes and malt-sweetness - isn't it a bit out of character for a Baltic Porter?"
"This was quite interesting, although I'm not sure the bottle was worth it (four bucks!). Nevertheless, it's fun to drink a really old beer and see how well it's aged (or not). This one seems to have held up well."
"The beer was medium to full-bodied. There definitely was some unfermented sugar remaining, and perhaps that is why it was so drinkable. It was like a molasses candy drink, with plenty of spice from the hops and dark malts. This beer is a delight, and highly recommended. I love Baltic Porters."
"Sinebrychoff Porter doesn't quite supplant Perkuno's Hammer in my mind, but it is outstanding beer and has few peers in its class. Baltic Porter is one of my favorite non-hoppy styles and this bottle does nothing to change that. One of the best, if not THE best, beers that is readily available to me."
"Reflection: This was a pretty good porter, I plan on picking up more so my buddies can try it."
"Dark, dark brew -- truly black -- with a sticky brown lace that looks like a styrofoam pillow. Smoked wood, burnt chocolate, bittersweet bars of Lindt, and some subtle vinous fruit notes. This smells big. And it tastes/feels big too. Thick body with a warming, pleasant, subdued charcoal flavor that unlies the entire experience. Black malts and a hint of java round out the roasted flavors, but this really is dominated by chocolate. Chocolate powder and malted milk balls punch through the initial sip. The roastiness builds as you drink this, but there's a slurp of chocolate in every drink. A delightful classic."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep jet black color with three fingers of dark tan head. There's lots of sticky lacing left on the glass. The smell is rich and malty. Lots of roasted malt along with some dark fruit and licorice. Just a touch of alcohol. The taste is also malty, with lots of burnt malt, toffee, and a touch of espresso. A slightly dry finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, and just a little oily. The drinkability is good for a 7.2% brew. A nice Baltic porter."
"Cheers"
"Almost black but there seems to be a very dark mahogany influence as well. When I held this beer to a light it didnt allow any penetration of the liquid. Opaque. The head reached two fingers in height and it was a beautiful brunette color. I really liked the head color. The foam slowly faded to a soapy cap, lacing started before I started to remove the liquid. A foamy cap lasted the entire consumption. Overall, the lacing was webby and messy but very prevalent. In my stemmed glass it looked exquisite. The nose was a very lovely mix of dark fruits and roasty qualities. The malt provided hints of chocolate, coffee beans, and some true roast that produced charred wood influences. Oats. Caramel. In the middle is raw alcohol, which is too naked and talkative, unpleasant. The finish recovers nicely and offers some cherries, plums, and prunes. At the very end is a big blast of chocolate that really propels the nose. It ends on a high note! Potency is moderate but expressive, too bad I can clearly hear the cussing from the alcohol. Still the bouquet is inviting, maybe too clean as the nose lacks a symbiotic aura. The palate caught me off guard a little. It had more roast than I was expecting; this is a pleasant surprise! There is a big jolt of roasty qualities that range from char to smoky to woody to espresso to black coffee to chocolate. Each quality shines a little at a time. The espresso and chocolate are the loudest. Astringent. Bitter. Fruit in the middle, largely dark and tropical, cherries and plums mainly. Then follows some sweetness. It strikes with perfect timing. Caramel. Brown sugar. Milk chocolate. Oats. Im really digging this! At the finish is the alcohol, kind of raw, too naked, too hot but it doesnt ruin the beer, it does stop it from being truly remarkable. The palate is very charming. Long, bitter yet sweet aftertaste with lots of coffee influences, dry with earthy hops. Damn, this is good! The alcohol is noticed, yes, but it doesnt play itself, I mean, it doesnt seem like a beer with a 7+ abv. It drinks like a much smaller beer, and that could be dangerous! In other words, this is one hell of a drinkable beer. Worthy of my 850th review here on BA. Medium in body, a tickle thin it seems, the carbonation is very light, too light IMO and this produces a slick mouthfeel. Id like a little more bulk but there is nothing inherently wrong with the mouthfeel. It is pleasant. My bottle is over a year past its best by date, couldve fooled me! This is a really good beer and Im glad I can buy it in Iowa. This bottle was purchased in Minnesota, MN. I should have bought more. As good as it is, when I drink this again it will be standalone, no cheese here please. This bad boy is flying solo. This is a great Baltic Porter. Seek it out. Enjoy it. Recommended."
"Cap comes off with a loud, rushing pop. No wonder this pours with a nice inch-and-a-half-deep head of miniscule, dark tan bubbles. Beer is black--not black hole black, but matte black. Head clings foamily and laces well. Gah, it really clings! in keeping with the sluggish viscosity of the brew. Aromas of carbonized chocolate, burned Milk Duds, cigar ash. Finishes with a touch of sulfur--not eggy sulfur, but matchstick sulfur. Polished nosefeel seems on the light side in body... I wanted it to lay it on me heavier. For an instant, the sweetness of over-dried prune skins hovers at the tip of the tongue, before plunging into oily poppyseed depths. Charred wood, coffee grounds, and raw cocoa float around in the gloom. Finishes with smoldering hop stalks, hash resin, and residual carbons in a surprisingly even aftertaste. Slightly greasy mouthfeel with no detectable carbonation seems to gain sludginess as it decends from mouth to belly. Drinkability is better than I expected; I could semi-gulp this despite the heavy flavor, but it would probably kick my ass in due fashion. Don't forget this beer on your next trip to the tundra."
"A great balanced brew. A favorite."
"Taste is very similar. Rich, sugary, dark fruit mix in with chocolate liquer, before roasted coffee bitterness balances the palate. Coffee bitter lasts well into the finish. Theres a sour twang vaguely present throughout the taste that was unexpected, but not bad per se. Mouthfeel was a little watery for the style. All in all, a very good beer."
"I was lucky enough to find a vintage 1997 bottle of this stuff at Spirit Haus in Amherst, MA, great store by the way. Dark velvet black appearance, with a slight brown head. Beauty in a glass. Smells strongly of port wine, bitter chocolate, dried fruit and coffee grounds, with faint wisps of alcohol. Taste is out of this world gorgeous. Port wine sweetness up front with lots of fruity complexity. Figs, dried fruit, and raisins all come to mind. Chocolate and coffee flavors also swirl themselves around in this brew. Roasted malt is big in this beer, yet floral hops and all of the wonderful complex flavors of this beer balance everything out very well. It feels like I'm drinking black silk. Not thick at all like some porters. A very thin consistency makes for incredible smoothness, and makes it surprising that this beer is as flavorful as it is. A real treat to drink. I don't think I've ever raved as much about a beer, but this brew is so fantastic that it warrants such raving. This is one every beer enthusiast should seek out because it is such a unique gem. Wowie zowie."
"Pours a deep dark brown color, almost black with a bubbly firm offwhite/chocolate head that is just simply beautiful. After a couple minutes a nice lace is left behind after the head recedes. Aromas are slighty roasty, with a bit of bread, and a sweet characteristic to it near the realm of molasses or a bittersweet cocoa. For flavor this brew starts off slightly roasty with just a nice hint of dark fruits. Following there is a light sweetness, then a change towards a more malty bread like flavor, almost biscuity. Afterwards there is a nice rounded coffee flavor which is followed by a slight molasses. The finish of this beer is slighty bitter, with a firm roasty balance. The body of this brew is gorgeous, almost chewy and fully complex. The carbonation is light, but there is no need for any more than is provided due to the amazing flavor. Overall if you like Baltic Porters (or even just regular porters) this beer is clearly the king."
"Deep brown body, with a 2"" inch head of dark tan that retains slighty longer than average. Scent is of roasted malt, some light chocolate. The taste is wonderfully rounded, has a sweet malt body that lends flavors of prune, toffee, some wet leaves and a really sweet finish with a real chocolate taste and some coffee notes. Bitterness is very slight, and the flavor really exudes a nice balance of the ingredients. Immensely quaffable, and really enjoyable. The high abv is hidden wonderfully. A great porter and deserving of its reputation."
"This'll have me back."
"Only medium-full in body, but intensely full in flavor. This is a terrific beer."
"Notes: Very nice. Had a great complexity with a smooth taste and roasty finish that was oh so nice."
"Bottle at the Moan and Dove. Tar like pour. Thin tan head fades quickly, but it remains dark as night. Powerful malty aroma, lots of dates and grapes character, but also a considerable chocolate cake portion and this huge roasted malt, flakey counterpart. Great balance, awe-inspiring alcohol dissimulation. Intense palate starts with big dates and anise maltiness. It quickly lets room to an extreme roasty finish, very long.. like 2 parts roasted licorice and 1 part cereals. The sweetness fades out in total control. Acidity level is maintained very low. How much dark malt could they fit into a 12oz? A lot of things going on. Complexity is not disturbed by the great thick airy body. Thick enough that the high carbonation appears just smooth and creamy. It feels like theyve brewed it with oatmeal."
"Pours a nice deep, dark, sanguineous black, with a minimal head. A very nice coffee and licorice aroma wafts from this beer, with some undertones of currant or some other dark fruit. It's not a really overwhelming smell, just a nice, subtle aroma. This thing tastes just awesome. It is good when chilled, but becomes leaps and bounds better as it warms. The flavor consists of licorice, chocolate, sarsparilla, and toffee up front, which progresses to a roasty coffee bitterness combined with a very flavorful hops profile. The finish is dry and surprisingly refreshing. The mouthfeel seems a tad thin to start, but again, it becomes richer and fuller as the beer warms. The real kicker to this beauty is that its 7% ABV is so well hidden. I real feel like this would make as good a session beer as any I've ever head, except I'd be stupified after three. This is superb, and the best example of this style I've come across. I feel like it shares quite a bit with Anchor Porter in flavor, but steps up to the plate where that beer falls short. Completely deserving of its rating."
"Pitch black in color with a stick tan head. Malty, chocolately smell and taste. Smooth body and extremely satisfying. Enjoyed every sip and glad I gave it a try. I've never been a fan of porters, but I'm quickly becoming one. Malt is good."
"Pours an inky black with a small, quickly fading brown head. Almost a syrupy, glugging sound when poured. Aromas of soy sauce, licorice, and lots of roasted malts. Toasty, slightly bitter palate. Not as thick and rich as the nose promises. Long, lingering finish. Flavorful, toasty mouthfeel with a light toasty finish. Overall, a solid beer. I think this is my first baltic porter, and it has encouraged me to try more."
"This beer was much better than anticipated, and I recommend it highly. An excellent example of the style."
"Best before 27.06.2003 dating. Pours opaque deepest brown with a nice, fluffy light brown head that lasts. Big aromas of dark fruits (raisins, berry, prune), scorched malts, coffee and molasses. Very creamy mouthfeel despite its thickness. Very heavy on the roasted malts, earthy and residually sweet. Faintest astringency in the finish. Very drinkable despite its higher alcohol and lower carbonation. I'd thought I was losing my ""sweet tooth"" for certain beers, and this one's bringing everything full circle again."
" highly recommended!"
"Pours with a prodigious, rich brown head that is quite impressive. The beer itself is a deep black color. It is lightly sweet up front, but quickly leads to rich dark malt flavors that are redolent of espresso, burnt raisins and chocolate. This is fairly light bodied, but has a lingering palate that is dominated by a roast malt astringency, which really helps to balance out this beer. This beer has some really nice rich flavors without being heavy."
"Note: I found this beer in a completely different bottle than the one pictured. Read the label carefully and you should get the same beer anyway. ""Portteri"" is a singular Finnish noun for ""porter."" Add a suffix ""-n," make the word plural, and have *lots* more fun. :)"
"Poured out with pitch black body with a thin tannish head that dissapated down to a slight layer of foam that stayed until the end. Aromas of chocolate and mild cherry fruitiness. Sweet black chocolate flavors and nice mellow alcohol that gave it a somewhat fruity flavor. The real magic to this beer is in its mouthfeel. Paradoxically thick yet light in the mouth making it very easy to drink. When the beer warmed a certain slickness appeared. Certaintly a top notch brew from Finland of all places. Another northern European winner for me."
"Slick, coffee flavours, prunes/raisins, along with an oak type flavour. Big & wine like, with a quick finish. Medium/full bodied, oily, with relaxed carbonation."
"Poured a pitch black with a tan head. The head receded to the rim with a little lacing in the middle after a few minutes. The aroma is deep chocolate, vinous alcohol notes, raisins, and plums. The taste is unbelievably smooth. Sweet roasted malts coast gently through the mouth, lending hints of coffee, chocolate, and a very light fruity finish. Not very thick feeling at all, surprisingly light. The right balance of dark malt and carbonation with no outstanding bitterness causes this beer to just glide over your tongue. Exceptionally drinkable - just watch out for the sneaky alcohol, as this beer is so smooth you won't release it catching up to you!"
"IMHO: Interesting, and an easy drink, yet the flavor is somewhat one-dimensional"
"Alcohol is well hidden in this beer and I will buy more."
"A fantastic porter, not too sweet which is good, went really well with a cadburys turkish delight :)"
"Best before 6-27-2003 clearly marked. I at first balked at the $2.99 price tag, but it was worth every penny."
"Mouthfeel is sharper than expected. This thing is potent, but in a good way. Drinkability remains pretty high."
"Pours out an almost black with a small tan head. Smooth with a nice hoppy finish. Dry malts abound while keeping a thin profile in check. Way better than I was expecting for a Finish porter. Worth checking out, but not dwelling on. I can not taste the 7.2%."
"A solid baltic porter that keeps a real nice smoothness the whole duration making for one sound drinkin' porter. One that grows on ya."
"Sheer Baltic Porter Porn, you should feel ashamed and guilty if you spend the night alone with this one, but fulfilled, and you will cuddle it afterwards. Brilliance - a true Classic!"
"being a huge fan of porters, i had been eyeing this for awhile. then i read the reviews and slapped my own ass for not having picked it up sooner. ran down to the store and snatched 3 bottles immediatly. this pours out pretty damn black. some will argue its not ""stout"" like black, but this shit looks pretty black to me. nice brown head pops up and fades leaving awesome lacing. the aroma is sweet, dark fruits (raisins/prunes), thick caramel, brown sugar and maple syrup....hell yea. a great roasted character also keeps things ""porterly"" and there is a lingering alcohol presence. nice. the taste is much like the nose, strong brown sugar and malt sweetness right off the bat followed by touches of vanilla and chocolate all ending on a lovely coffee wave that just lingers long past the last swallow. full bodied and smooth with a nice tingly carbonation, this is too drinkable. in the end, this gets two sets of horns and a full blast tribute from Emperor with ""Ye Entrancemperium"" cranked up all the way."
" Thick, rich, and smooth, yeah gotta go with full body on this one. The malt backbone is very large. Roasted coffee flavors come in first followed shortly by chocolate, nuts, and caramel. Hints of fruit come in near the finish as it dries and throws a few chewed up coffee beans in there. There is 7.2% in there somewhere, but I can't find it in the flavor. It does warm a bit. I would like to try a fresher sample to compare, but this beer is absolutely beautiful as it is. The drinkability is excellent as well. It just keeps getting more and more complex and intersting as it warms. I will seek this one again, soon."
"Overall: An excellent Baltic porter, complex and flavorful."
"This stuff quite simply rocks. Recommended to me by Bill at Whole Foods in Arlington VA (great place BTW), this was my first Finnish beer. Wow... What a brew. Great example of a Baltic Porter/Imperial Stout. Pours almost black with a fluffy caramel colored head. Smell is of plums, coffee and alcohol. Taste is out of this world... burnt malt, bitter/semisweet chocolate, roasted coffee and a touch of fruitiness are evident. The fruitiness can only really be discerned if you hold it in your mouth for a second. This is a must try beer. I will be purchasing more soon."
"A quality brew for sure but not as good as the Okinom (sp) I had yesterday...still a top notch Baltic....thanks to Budgood1 for setting me up again."
"12 oz bottle. Nice dark pour, tiny bubble head, tan in color. Leaving moderate lacing. Nose of coffee and burnt malt and fruit. Full bodied, creamy mouthfeel, some chalky dryness and stickness. Notes of chocolate, malt, coffee, toffee, plums, figs, raisins and a nice finish note of vanilla. Very taste brew. Seek out this Finish nectar."
"Pours almost a pitch black with a fairly nice sized tannish head. The beer laces all the way down the glass. Aroma is of bitter chocolate, port barrels, and maybe some raisins or figs soaked in port. Taste is a coffish-chocolate like bitterness although it is smooth and very malty. Some alcohol soaked fruits in the middle followed by more chocolate in the finish.. Very smooth and drinkable concidering the ABV.. Quite a good beer. Not one that I would drink more than one or two of, but I will certainly seek this out and have it again. Top notch after dinner cool weather beer."
"Not something I would drink often, the alcohol just struck me as too raw, maybe it needs to age longer."
"There was not much of a nose. I caught a hint of roasted coffee and some chocolate. They were both very subtle. The flavor was lingering and waiting to consume my palate. What this lacked in aroma it made up in flavor. The chocolate and dark malt saturated my palate and continued to provide enjoyment even after I swallowed. This would go exceptionally well with a raspberry dessert or cigar."
"This is some potent stuff! Pours a deep black into the glass. A very thick, dark brown head forms after a less-than aggressive pour. The aroma doesn't really prepare you for the taste...it is just understated malt with some chocolate undertones. The understatement ends as the beer hits your tongue. Chocolate malt grips your tongue and does not let go until well into the aftertaste. The first few sips were almost overwhelming due to the strength of the malty background. This is definitely not what I was expecting, as I expected something a little less potent. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, or wouldn't seek it out again, it's just not something I would want more than one of in a sitting. Drinkability suffers due to sensory overload."
"33cl Bottle No Freshness Date. Poured black as coal and opaque with a creamy dense tan head. Aroma of sweet malt, roasted coffee, chocolate and licorice. Slight metallic note also. Body is medium and smooth finishing slightly dry. Flavor is roasty and bitter with notes of cocoa and caramel. Overall very good for the style."
"Poured out a very blackish color with some carbonation, but left no lacing around the glass. Smell consisted of some plums and some chocolate. Taste was great. Plums and raisins hit first with some coffee and chocolate undertones that's very well balanced. Aftertaste was cocoa like in taste. Very nice. Quite expensive but well worth it. Grab a couple."
"Thanks to WVbeergeek for the bottle. Though I just missed this beer on the Top 50, it's still a good one nonetheless, and I'm hoping to get a more recent vintage sometime in the future to see how they compare."
"1999 Vintage I don't know if that's a good thing. Appearance: It pours a dark ruby brown practically black with a huge tan head leaves behind nice even lacing as it dwindles. Aroma: Stale toasted malts dark chocolate and creamy moccha tones with a heavy alcohol drenched fruit tones. Taste: Very smooth heavily roasted malts dance on the palate with a moccha fruity alcoholic tone it does seem a bit past it's best by but still very tasty and good to consume. Mouthfeel: Not as heavy feeling as it looks medium to full bodied baltic porter not bad at all still well carbonated. Drinkability: I'm somewhere in the middle it's very good and balanced but I must say I would like to have a fresher sample. Seems to be one of the better brewed Baltic porters around I suggest giving it a shot very nice."
"1998 Vintage Bottle - The body is much leaner than a fresh sample. The dark, ripe fruits have mellowed and there is more of a grape-like character to the taste and a slight tartness. The alcohol has mellowed considerably as well. The mouthfeel is slightly less, but it makes up for it in better drinkability so overall, it has the same score."
"11.2 oz bottle pours an opaque dark brown with a three finger tan head that seems to last forever, and leaves patches of sheet lacing all over the glass. Very nice looking. Aroma is disappointing, with not much on the nose but some chocolate and light smoke. Mouthfeel is creamy, but has a light texture. Taste just doesn't seem to emerge until room temperature. Cocoa, a hint of coffee, light smokiness, and a slightly dry finish. Very smooth, and alcohol is well concealed, but this one will sneak up on you with its superb drinkability. I was disappointed in this one, as it doesn't measure up against others of the style."
"This pours jet black with a huge, rocky tan head. The aroma is somewhat a mixture between chocolate & coffee, but not too overpowering on each. On your tongue, you get smokey and dark chocolate notes. It's medium bodied and smooth. This is a pretty nice 'winter warmer' type of beer."
"This terrific brew will definitely be making regular appearances in my fridge, glad to have discovered it."
"The beer is very smooth throughout and exhibits very mild gentle carbonation. Nice thick body almost chewy, and yet incredibly drinkable. No hint of the alcohol content anywhere. Gotta love this brew!"
"My bottle was sampled in 12/17/03, and the expiration on the back was marked 06/27/03. Perfectly palatable, with perhaps the hops dropping out a tad, and the beer acquiring a more pronounced port vinousness. This is truly one of the best baltic porters out there. One of my favorite styles, the lagered versions unlike anything else out there."
"Comments  This was a Vintage 1997 that held nicely for the six or seven years that it was in the bottle. A big, appreciative BA THANX to Jason (dare I call him J-Bro) for sending this one out my way."
"Too bad it's not that cold here. I can barely finish this - more of a critique of my palate, not the beer."
"Dark reddish-brown liquid topped by a creamy tan head. Sweet and fruity aroma also throws in some nice chocolate notes for good measure. The taste is at once fruity and roasty, with a bit of a bite to it. The slight edginess actually makes it a bit refreshing as it cuts through the heavier flavors. THe beer finishes very dry, and the chocolate and roasted notes reappear and linger in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is perhaps a bit on the thin side, but not distracting in any way. This beer also is very drinkable and enjoyable. I can't believe I waited so long to review this one."
"Aroma of creamy alcoholic raisins and a little spicy jerky. Foamy hazelnut colored head dissapated quickly leaving just a trace on the glass. Really dark opaque colored beer, I'll go with 10,000 mile motor oil. The body is hardly thick, I've got to get the dark beer = thick out of my head. Strong porter flavor with hints of roasted malt with a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is creamy and the finish is fairly clean. A very flavorful and aromatic beer that is easy to drink. I haven't had that many porters, but this ranks up there with some of the best stouts."
"Notes: A most excellent brew, god like qualities. A hard to find beer and few like this are made in the Baltic Porter Style. A treat your self brew and worth every penny of the $3 spent on this one."
"Flavor leads with a hint of oxidation, but comes through with a large brown molasses sugar that weaves back and forth with a mix of metal and strongly herbal flavors. The finish is a mix of roasted black malts and brown sugar."
"This bad boy was as dark as dark can be. Tan head retained well and left some scattered lace. Aroma was of sweet malt, with some roastiness. Taste was interesting, on first sip the sweet malts and alcohol were evident along with a decent roasted note. The roastiness seem to give way to the sweet malts and hoppiness for the rest of the glass. Silky mouthfeel and very drinkable. Thanks to Rkhaze for this nice porter."
"Drinkability: Nice. A number of other less pricey porters are better in my book."
"Wonderful."
"This is easily one of the best beers I've ever had. Inky black with a full tan head that lasted quite well and gave great lacing. Sweet chocolate aroma, a touch of coffee, a bit of smoke, and a little alcohol sneaking in too. Taste is amazingly smooth and complex. Chocolate malt, bitter coffee, sweetness of dark fruits, and a well balanced bitterness. Alcohol is slightly evident, but never obvious. Wow."
"Pours a rich black with deep tan head that I swear had purple highlights. Head left quickly leaving some lace. Aroma had some peaty scotch-like notes along with some chocolate, could also swear I picked a port-like touch. Taste had some roast, some semi-seet chocolate and minor bitter coffee-like aftertaste. Complex brew that just didn't quite pull it off IMHO."
"Good full rich mouthfeel and soft carbonation. This went down too easy. Top notch effort. Gonna have to score some more!"
"Opaque dark brown with a lavish, khaki head that retains itself quite well while leaving trails of lace down the glass. Chocolate, black licorice, and espresso permeate in the bouquet. Flavors of freshly ground coffee and roasty, mildly bitter chocolate with the vaguest hint of earth on the finish in addition to some minor warming alcohol. Full-bodied, wonderfully smooth and creamy mouthfeel complements the beer exceptionally well. A highly drinkable, majestic Baltic Porter. Very Imperial Stout-like, but in a more subdued, elegant fashion. A wonderful pairing with fresh brownies and other chocolate desserts. A definite world classic."
"A very good porter that is solid all around. Stout-like dark brown to black body with a good beige head. The nose is fairly awesome with huge chocolate and roasted malt sense. The flavor is very rich and full, chocolatey and malty as well. The feel is full, creamy and rich. Very drinkable despite the higher ABV."
"*Edit (Debate solved, I drank it and enjoyed it every bit as much as the first. Excellent Porter. Mmmmm"
"Thick foamy brown head that lasts and lasts. The aromatics develop as the beer warms, but the first impression was chocolate and coffee. The flavor is very smooth and chocolate. The flavor also has a complexity that must be attributable to age. The finish was dry, bitter, and slightly alcoholic. A very good Baltic Porter."
"Pours with a foamy dark tan head that stays for a good length of time. The lace is thick and holds on to the sides of the glass. Solid black in color. The aroma is a rich mix of chocolate, roasted, coffee, and vinous notes. The palate, like the aroma, is quite rich. Carmel and molasses sweetness is noticeable up front, with lots of dry roastiness a hint of chocolate later on. Some slight hints of fruitiness are also noticeable. The finish is a mix of bitter roasted notes and hops that linger for a while. The mouthfeel is medium with not too much carbonation. The vinous notes that were quite noticeable on the nose are very slight on the palate. This was a great porter that I enjoyed very much. Ill definitely look for this one again."
" Overall, I cannot speak highly enough about this beer, complex, well balanced, beautiful to look at, warming in the belly, satisfying (this is really one for the ages). I have enjoyed this beer many times, and it still continues to amaze me. The only beer from Finland I know of, and a masterpiece.."
"Eclipse black color. Small head. Aroma is fruity (raisins and apricots). A lighter bodied porter. Roaster malts are sweet, choclately and fruity. Hops are mild. Very drinkable. Touch of oak and smoke. Smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Don’t know what to make of it: a porter with stout notes and complexity. Flavorful and fairly balanced amongst its many flavors, not sure it gets much better than this. A stupendous match with dark chocolate. Buy one."
"I couldn't wait to try this. Deep brown/black in color with a rich and lofty dark brown head that was at least an inch thick for the entire beer. Smells nutty, chocolaty, and licoricey. Mmmmm. Rich and chewy malts expand across the palate. Complex tastes of bitter chocolate, coffee, toffee and some black licorice. So chewy I feel like I should be drinking/eating this with a spoon. I love Baltic Porters. This would be a great beer to enjoy with a winter Sauna. Thank you Finland."
"I got this one at Siciliano's Market where the worker told me it had been in the back since 1998, being aged. It was the last one they had in stock. Seemed like a steal at $2.99/bottle. This beer seems to have every flavor possible in it. Wow. I don't know what to say. Malt bitterness at the start. Chocolate and coffee mix together to smoothen it out. Malty sweetness comes along. I notice some fruity flavors, even some vinous flavors. It seems as if a hoppier bitterness is there towards the end, but I'm not completely sure. Finishes with more chocolate/coffee sweetness. Excellent."
"Find a better porter-I dare you. Pours dark(like a stout). Head dissipates quickly. Malty and chocolate nose. Taste is very clean and fresh. Good carbonated bite. Dark chocolate and coffee with malt flavor. This is an excellent beer. Great for after dinner."
"Its black body reveals a brilliant ruby highlight at the base of the glass when held to the light. It's clear; but tiny particles of sediment are noticeable resting at the base. The thick and creamy dark-tan head holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace throughout most of the glass. Sweetish dark caramel and a mild note of fruit greet you in the nose. With a little investigation it reveals some cocoa and a mild roastiness. The body is medium and it's smooth and oily across the palate with a fine carbonation that lightly caresses the tongue. The flavor, however, comes on strong with lots of roastiness, deep caramel, chocolate, alcohol and a swirl of fruitiness. It's initially sweet, but the solid bitterness (50 IBU's) kicks in at the swallow. It finishes surprisingly dry with more bitterness than the style normally offers, and a wash of alcohol; lingering with notes of cocoa, prunes, dark caramel, molasses, bittersweet chocolate, dull roastiness, and some ""spent hop"" flavor. From the start to the finish it's quite a complex ride for the senses. Most impressive!"
"This brew has a very nice aroma for this Porter. Extremely dark brown color with a small light head filled with a mixture of all sizes of bubbles. Very heavy taste with an initial bite that soon fades. Subsequent tastes are not as bitter. All in all one of the better Porters I have tasted. Hotstuff did not rate the beer as she felt it had chocolate in it."
"(Looking on the label, it seems we crossed paths just in time?Best before:6.27.03)"
"This stuff is amazing. A truly delightful treat of a porter."
"-F"
"Pours black ruby in color with a tall creamy tan colored head that slowly dissipates into a heavy semi-sticky lace. Nose is fresh coffee and lots of sweet dark malt. Medium to full in body and extremely smooth and creamy in texture. Taste is dominated by tons of malt with additional notes of unsweetened chocolate, dark coffee, and a touch of molasses. Finish is dry with a lingering aftertaste. A wonderful porter thats quite delicious. Purchased from Liquid Solutions."
"Pours coat closet black under a roof of dirty foam. A bowl of mixed fresh and roasted berries drizzled in dark chocolate with a dollop of hazelnut cream might be enough words to try and describe the hearty aromas oozing from this charmer. Soft coal snatches your buds by the roots initially, but is quickly steamrolled by dark roasted coffee beans that get all red currant tart and dry and chummy with a handful of greasy hops. Coats the mouth like whipped wet fudge. A serious fireside session brew, big enough to sate, but small enough to crack another."
"Pours with an outstanding immense deep-tan mousse, settling over dark brownish-red liquid. The nose is very roasty with a malt powder undertone and coffee notes. The taste is simultaneously roasty and chocolatey, with a bitter coffee upsurge on the palate. Finishes with a sweet malt burst, then drys out roasty, toasty and bitter...just awesome!"
"Very black appearance with creamy tan head,smelled sweet an coffeeish.Taste was oily,somewhat woody with some sweetness in there.High alcohol content was very apparent as it warmed,something good to drink on a cold night before bed good for that Baltic style."
"This was a Porter Zenith. By shear luck, I plucked a dusty bottle of this from a shelf at the packy, not knowing anything about it or its brewer. Poured a nice dark black color, with a rich caramel head. The taste was esquiset, burnt coffee, caramel, good malts, etc. I did not even realize it had a 7.2% ABV until I started staring at the bottle in amazement at the great taste. Easily the best porter ever."
"Pitch black porter, even held against the light. Tan head. Complex aroma of coffee, cocoa, dried fruits, ensilage(!) and oak. The full and rich flavour has coffee, bitter chocolate and loads of roasted maltiness. Not too sweet, just the right bitterness in the aftertaste. This must be a world class porter!"
"Kiipis! (Cheers!)"
"Pours an almost opaque dark brown, with a slight garnet tinge to it. Head is medium in size, dark tan in color, leaves good lacing. Aroma is roasted malt, caramel, light dough, and mild chocolate. Flavor is roasted malts, coffee, bitter chocolate. Body is medium, medium carbonation, and goes down quite smooth."
"488"
"Cheers"
"An outstanding brew. Definitive of the style. Very enjoyable. Highly recommended. Up there with Okocim, Carnegie, Aldaris Porteris and Zywiec...the HOLY Pentacostal of Baltic Porters."
"The flavor was very good and balanced. coffe/chocolate...a little bitterness...and again the alcohol flavor warms you as it goes down. I would get this once in a while. Not one of my top beers but still good."
"Solid black color and a thick, bubbly tan head (great head retention). Malty, woody, aroma. Alcohol and warmness is in the smell as well. Taste is very sweet and malty, with roasted grain flavors coming through after a few sips. Great bitter finishchocolate and molasses notes in the mid-taste. Actually, this is a very drinkable, exceedingly smooth beer. Creamy and on the heavy-bodied side. Very enjoyable."
"All in all, it was a very good beer that would buy if available in my area. I hope to fine a fresh bottle one day and compare it to this one. If I do, I will update my review if needed."
"Drinkability: Damn good... While the thicker body and higher alcohol keep this from being an all-night companion, it makes a fantastic nightcap for putting an end to a tiring day. Bloody marvelous!"
"Very nice porter. Has some head to it, which I like. Tasted like malted coffee. Good rich dark color, with a super thick brown head. Had some floral smells attatched to the chocolate malt. Starts out a little bitter from the alcohol, but finishes smooth. Fiancee liked it and she is a big fan of lighter beers, so mostly anyone would like it."
"This beer pours jet-black. All I had at hand was a pilsner glass, and I held it up to some sunlight, and still could barely see through it. Unlike other reviewers, I did not obtain much head, but I must admit the beer was served a bit cooler (38F) than I prefer. A little warmer might have generated a better bed of foam. This is a very intense beer, with coffee/molasses/burnt flavors initially vying for your attention before succumbing to a lingering hop aftertaste. This stuff is silky-smooth, and begs for drinking, but it definitely it is not a session beer. ""Easy does it"" is certainly in order here."
"A brilliant deep walnut to black color on the pour, the head a lavish cap of frothy chocolate brown bubbles, that degrades to fine sticky sheets of lace that seal themselves to the glass. Toasted grain, caramel, light hints of coffee, and a bit earthy to boot, quite a nice nose. Start is ambrosial and the top heavy in its feel, with the finish passably acidic, the hops potent in their spicy bite, dry lingering aftertaste and quite a decent and Robust porter in my book."
"This sample was a bit better than the previous, though perhaps with a bit less aroma. Poured black wtih good, light brown foam that settled but left good lacing. The smell was nice and sweet (caramel malt). The taste was full and sweet but with a touch of sharpness. Caramel, coffee, and bitter chocolate overtones in the finish. The mouthfeel was full and chewy but creamy. The flavor was nice and lingered a while in the mouth. Low carbonation. This bottle was very drinkable! I wish I knew the vintage of this one, but I estimate it had to have been on the store's shelf for a year or two or more (based on the dust)."
"Shoe polish black with medium head. Terrific aroma of bitter chocolate, big toasty malts. Somewhat abrasive on the tongue, but manages to be velvety too, in the manner of porters. Big roasted malt flavor, traces of coffee, grains and herbs. Very light hoppiness, some bitterness a la bitter chocolate, but majority of flavor is sweet. A beer that is both daunting and tempting. I am guessing this sample is old, since flavors are mellowed, muted, almost shimmering. Nothing prototypically Finnish except perhaps a very light trace of liquorice. Alcohol is notable but not overpowering, and finish is not too lasting. A classic."
"Dark. Tastes heavy with a alcohol feel. Some bitterness with a sweet taste. Molasses. Brown sugar. Some musky notes that remind me of aged dark cave. After I finish this one I'm done for the night. A night capper."
"Not quite as good as Fuller's but this Porter is no slouch. Pours a nice oily black with a pretty milk-chocolate brown head. Aroma of espresso and chocolate. Very robust flavor with a slightly sharp aftertaste, but overall the finish is warm and smooth. Very good!"
"""Aromas of rum, oak, molasses. Sweet attack. Chocolate milk. Cedar chip-dry grip on finish. Loaded with coffee liqueur, raisin, and allspice flavors. Dense and slick."""
"Porter, from Finland: Deep, almost jet black color.  The head is as dark brown a head as I’ve ever seen.  Taste is very powerful, with pronounced tastes of bitter dark chocolate.  This beer is surprisingly bitter, more like very strong coffee, rather than from hops.  Lingering aftertaste of bakers chocolate, with alcohol warmth and taste.  I’ll pass it by if offered again."
"Porters aren't usually among my favorites, but this is an exceptional porter!  Very complex.  Very tasty."
"Pours black, but not opaque with smallish tan head. Nice roastiness in aroma and flavor. The bitterness rides on top of a marshmallow kind of flavor. The feel of the beer leaves the palate quickly and leaves little aftertaste. Fairly clean profile."
"A notch shy of being completely jet - black-- only a meagar yet clear ruby hue around the edges is seen. Dark caramel malt sweetness dominates the aroma initially, but a bittersweet combination of deeply roasted malt & carob ensues. There's a hint of fusels in aroma as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is viscous, rich, borderlining on being oily and thus adds to the richness if this brew. Assertive sweetness hits the palette at first, but mellow and clean chocloate malt & heavily caramelized flavors follow. Hop bitterness doesn't assert itself until the enjoyable bittersweet finish which is akin to dark chocolate. Although sweet overall, there's sufficient complexity in Sinebrychoff Porter to make it a highly enjoyable beer."
"Man alive! This beer is quite an experience. Jet black with coffee, cherry, sandalwood, chocolate flavors and aroma. Complex almost too much flavor to it. It is hard to take in all at once, sip after sip revealing something new. Next time this one comes around I am definitely getting extras(the distributor only had 16 bottles). My only complaint was the head didnt last long. It aged AMAZINGLY well, the young version is a tad astringent but that seems to go away with age. This ranks way up there on my list of beers for a treat not your everyday porter."
"Pours dark brown / opaque, with a very nice dark tan head with deep pockets. The body is medium, with a very smooth almost oily mouth feel. Coffee notes in the aroma and in the flavor also. Along with coffee there are fresh wood notes and caramel malts. As it warms it gets very, very sweet. Nice bit of warming action in the finish (a typical antidote for the Baltic cold)...overall a excellent Baltic Porter..."
"Okay, first off, wasn't expecting a Finnish beer.  Love the people, but never heard much about beer from them.  A nice dark color, a decent head(but didn't hold).  Nice flavor with some flavor elements that I have quite figured out yet.  Worth checking out."
"The beer is opaque with a thin, dense brown head.  Pretty heavy roast tones in the aroma. This is a pretty decent porter.  Nice roast tones on the tongue as well as bitterness and coffee notes.  All things I look for in a porter.  The bitterness is the most appealing aspect.  Nice creamy mouthfeel. Medium to full body.  While it's not one of my favorite porters, it's pretty good."
"Yumm...Only problem with drinkability is that it is gone too fast."
"pours out a completely opaque black colour, with a thin fine tan head with a little lacing. wow is this brew awesome! dark, ripened fruit aroma with plenty of chocolate, java and smoken tones. big chocolate profile in the taste...some burnt fruitiness, coffee and woody undertones too. the complexity is intriguing, very layered and it's extremely creamy and smooth. finish is full of roasted bitterness. i would rate this in my personal top ten of all time. this is a real treat. exceptional!"
"Wow! Malt, Malt, Malt. I love this stuff! It is rather hard to find. I just found a store selling singles of it. Very smooth with a very strong chocolate/coffee taste. Beautiful deep dark color. Amazing! The perfect porter in my book."
"And... and it's black. Real black porter. And my point of veiw is very simple: if a brewery can make a black porter, that's a good brewery indeed :-)"
"Definite chocolate smoothness balanced with a nice hop/grain bite. It's clean and unique. Hard to find too...."
"This sample came in a much larger bottle than past vintage years, and actually didn't display a vintage on the label."
