4.35,5.8,4.25,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"2010 vintage.  Pours a clear dark amber with a rich dark ruby cast.  Excellent head volume, lacing and retention.  Complex nose of dark fruit (fig, plum), molasses and caramel over notes of chocolate and a hint of coffee.  Light medium body with a bit of creaminess over a smooth texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.  The World Class flavor profile is reasonably intense, quite complex and masterfully balanced.  It begins with a caramel sweet rush that soon flows into the dark fruits.  In the middle, molasses comes to the forefront and fades into a mild roast and hop bitterness.  As it approaches the finish, chocolate sweetness is evident and oak notes (oxidative aging) are present as is a subtle smokiness.  The finish is a slow fade of sweetness into a mild hop bitterness with just a hint of dryness.","tillmac62","Jan 13, 2015"
4.24,3.2,4.25,4,4.5,3.75,4.25,"Notes: served from an 11.2oz bottle into a pint, mouthfeel is a bit more sharply carbonated than I expected. That is the only thing I didn't care for, but it wasn't bad, merely unexpected. And once I adjusted to the more double bock taste than anticipated I was able to enjoy it. Not surprising given it is a Swede. In fact, it is nice to enjoy a beer from somewhere other than the usual suspects. At 5.5% and a bit rich I won't be quaffing pints, but this is a very enjoyable beer and worth seeking out. Throw some beer love Sweden's way.","WoodButcher","Jan 12, 2015"

I popped my stellar bottled ""firmament"" anxiously pouring it into a handy pint glass to find a most satisfying cooking companion to prepare my palate for the delicious spicy peppers and pasta meal I was preparing.

I love the cocoa powder flavor, it transforms into a cocoa powder feel of sorts, really cool. age has definitely done wonders for this beer, and while ive never had a fresh one, I can assure you that this is one special porter. perhaps also my first beer from Sweden. memorable.","StonedTrippin","Apr 11, 2013"

On warming a bit, the cherry, chocolate, vanilla and molasses started coming out. Great flavoe. Medium bodied with some creaminess. A quite nice low ABV porter.

The head was big and strong looking at first but settled down to just a thin tan creamy looking film over top of the brew. The lacing was light on the glass. The smell was full of roasted malts and just some minimal fruit elements shining through. The taste of the beer has a bold burnt bitterness up front, and some dark fruit sweetness which faded into a dark chocolate dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer had a decent thickness to it.

First sip was good, second was a even better. Smokey, roasted, a little dark chocolate flavors, a little sweet aftertaste, similar to a rauchbier, but it also reminds me of zywiec's porter. I had this beer years ago when I first started getting into beer and I found it again, and I'm glad I did. Such a refreshing difference from most american porters (this one is swedish).

The nose has an extremely enticing mix of chocolate, roasted malt and very strong and sweet dark fruit. Once the beer is tasted it reveals a large treacle character, which is more than likely the result if waves of raisin, chocolate and brown sugar melding together. This is accompanied by a light coffee roast and moderate bitterness. Smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel with a hint of alcohol in the tail. This beer drinks bigger than it is, which is a great feat for a lower ABV Baltic porter, and probably makes it one of the few that could be sessioned.","bobsy","Sep 08, 2009"

Light to medium-bodied, this makes it much easier to chug given the thicker flavors of caramel, toffee, coffee ice cream and orange peel. More white fruit than black fruit here.

Smell was somewhat weak, but did have a nice milk chocolate nose. It was also pretty clean in the smell overall. Taste had lots of burnt coffee beans, bitter chocolate, and the aftertaste you get from a nice cigar. Mouthfeel was a notch above medium, and very nice on the palate. This ia a great beer. It would do well as a sipping beer or as a gulper. I personally found no problem in finishing the sample I had. A really well done effort for the Porter style.

It is quite aromatic with roasted/toasted, chocolate, vinous, and sweet malts with notes of blackberry. The flavor adds to this notes of coffee, tobacco, anise, smoked malts, green apple or melon rind, a light lactic quality, and green hops that contribute a mild bitterness. The body is medium to light for such a dark brew, with medium carbonation and a medium finish. Overall a tasty Baltic porter that has a wonderful aroma.","mmmbeer","Dec 11, 2006"

It had a sandy coloured foamy head that stayed around for ages and left thick lacing clinging to the sides of the glass. This was quite nice, but I would have liked it better were it darker still. The smell was roasted malts with a bit of a bitter coffee bean under tone, and a really faint chocolate aroma hidden deep down. I expected so much more in the smell. I expected the roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate, but at much higher levels. There was also a bit of a soured smell present here, as well, such as something you might expect to find with a lambic. Not as strong of course, but there, faintly, nevertheless. The taste was sweet roasted malts and a touch of caramel. Not the unmanageable semi-sweet chocolate and punch in the face coffee bean bitterness I was so hoping for. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, both for what I was expecting, and the style as a whole, I thought. Overall, this was a good porter. Not a fantastic porter, simply a good one. I was simply expecting so much more from this one, only to be dissappointed a bit. 3.5's across the board.","SilentSabre","Aug 25, 2006"

Obviously the hops are not that evident but I wished there was something else there to counteract the very sweet malty tones it was giving me. This was a very creamy beer and it sat very well on the side of my tongue as I swished it around. It left a fairly clean taste that I was very pleased with.

Over time, some great date flavors came out in the beer, as well as some nicely sweet, cake-like flavors. Anyway, a few people on here have noted seeing some 1997s around as remainders and such.

Sharply sweet candy-ish aroma, almost surprising when the beer does not turn out to be particularly sweet in flavor. Carmelized fig and prune flavors, but in moderation.

The body is medium; and it combines with a fine, moderate carbonation to leave it creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor is bold; and displays a vanilla/butter/caramel maltiness up-front, and a bit of chocolate towards the swallow along with some earthy/herbal hop flavors and a dull bitterness.

Definately worth getting again.","stegmakk","Jan 28, 2003"
4.05,-1.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Not my favorite porter and perhaps just a shade or two light, but overall a very nice beer to enjoy. Not easy to find from what I understand, but clearly worth the effort.","JoeyHotrod","Jan 01, 2003"
4.46,8.5,5,4,4.5,4,5,"Damn! This beer totally rocks! The dude from the Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg told me that this beer is one of his best Porters, so I took his advice and gave it a shot. I had high expectations for it, and it totally blew those out of the water. This beer has a nice thick malty taste to it and finishes off with a chocolate flavor. Even my girlfriend, who loves to drink Natty(don't worry, I am working on her), totally digged this stuff. I totally recommend this beer to anyone who is looking for a change for the better.","JISurfer","Dec 24, 2002"
4.2,2.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Very malty on the palate. Lots of licorice again, but nice acidity and bitterness add complexity and keep the residual sweetness from becoming cloying. An interesting take on a Porter.","Realale","Dec 12, 2002"
4.55,10.7,5,5,4.5,4.5,4,"A definitive ebony hue. Good, crackling tan head. As Fred Eckhart recommends, put this one to your ear and listen! Aroma is a blast of espresso, cocoa, anise and molasses. Rich and roasted, with loads of bitterness on the palate and a tenacious finish. Complex, if a bit gritty. Not a brew for novices or girly-men, this is stiff and substantial stuff. Label says best before August 2O1O, but who could wait that long? Unfortunately, the brewery has become bereft of their senses and is discontinuing this classic, so grab one if you can.","feloniousmonk","Dec 01, 2002"
4.15,1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"2001: Pours a nice dark ruby color with chocolate overtones with a smooth, tan head leaving behind a lacy cling.  A whiff from the glass reveals big sweet, malty, dark fruity, raisin aromas. Big sweet malt flavor with a slight metallic twinge, some alcohol warming, medium fruitiness like plums or raisins, and a mild roasted malt contribution.  A dry hops finish with some grain astringency keeps this beer under control.  It has a smooth, medium-heavy body with medium carbonation, but has an almost syrupy consistency.  This is a super malty porter... I didn't know they could be like this.  Almost reminded me of some doppelbocks, but with some roast character added.","comat0se","Nov 12, 2002"
4.18,1.7,4,3.5,4.5,5,4,"Hearty bodied beer, nice example of a heavy porter. Good use of dark malts. Charcoal burn grain flavor is present but very well intermingled with other tastes such as coffee and dark chocolate. Hops bitterness works closely with grain bitterness to keep beer from tasting sweet. Very smooth, creamy beer. Carbonation kept light so that it doesn't take attention away from this robust beer.","yen157","Nov 11, 2002"
4.38,6.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D. Carnegie & Co. Stark Porter 2001 from Sweden: In a big 16.9 oz. Bottle.  The label says that the best by date is April of 2010!  This is clearly a beer made for cellaring, but I have no time to lose.  This beer pours an inky black with ruby tints.  Thick full head, with Belgian lace all the way down. Clean light aroma, vaguely like a good Columbian coffee.  Creamy mouthfeel, with some carbonation.  Initial taste is licorice, which leads to a dark rye/ pumpernickel, and molasses.  Very well done, with several layers of tastes.  Excellent.","jackndan","Jul 25, 2002"
3.7,-10,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"2001: This beer is a very dark ruby.  Thin beige head disintegrates to nothing quickly.  A coffee scent dominates with hints of mocha as well on the nose.  Nice velvet like feel on the tongue.  Smooth tastes of chocolate, cocoa and java.  Very smooth porter.  Very easy drinking.  A nice faint bitterness.  A solid porter in my book.","Bighuge","May 16, 2002"

4.59,11.7,3.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"1997: Nearly jet black with a very thin bubbly lace that keeps on coming back after each sip. Smell of dark bread similar to pumpernickel, good amount of sweetness in the nose to soften the roasted aroma. Mild charcoal with woody and bready flavours that want to come in at the same time, very low carbonation that lets the creaminess flow first then a quick yet small smoothness rolls in. Vague acidic twang that is very passive, malt flavours pass back and forth between roasted and bready. Hops are but a dream and seem to be the most faded trait this brew has, thankfully the roasted grain picks up a little of the slack. Hard to tell this brew is on it fifth year, malt is still very fresh on the palate.","Jason","Apr 26, 2002"
2.89,-29.7,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,"1998: The head formation is poor, and a only a thin rim of bubbles coats the inside of the glass.  Like many porters, a deep garnet hue is noticeable when held up to light.  The slightly sweetish, dark caramel malt and mocha - like chocolate malt is quite pleasant, but could be more assertive.  Fairly thinly bodied for a porter, and there is nothing outstanding in the malt profile. A fairly one dimensional black patent and chocolate malt bitterness dominates the flavor, thus making this beer a bit unexciting. Hop bitterness has faded and is lost amongst the roasted grain bitterness. The finish is quite dry and too clean. Perhaps this beer has aged poorly, since the complex malt and hop character that comprises a good porter was sorely lacking in this brew.  Nothing ventured nothing gained, I guess.","marc77","Apr 07, 2002"
4.8,16.8,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"(Argang 2000) Wow! This stuff is great! Starts by pouring a very dark black, with a very yummy looking dark tan head. The head sticks around for a good time also, the body is a medium to light- heavy with a very nice smooth mouthfeel. Very nice robust coffee notes and light caramel flavor, with just enough sweetness ( not over done ) to really enjoy this brew! This stuff is great to the last drop! Ends with a nice long finish!Overall a excellent Porter! I need more!","WilliamPhilaPa","Apr 06, 2002"
