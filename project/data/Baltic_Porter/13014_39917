Instead of being at the forefront it's more of a complementary flavor, adding a layer of complexity. One of the best "smoked" beers I've ever had and a delicious baltic porter to begin with. Well integrated and balanced flavors leads to a very tasty and drinkable beer.","Dope","Jul 11, 2013"

Starts off with a nice chocolate malt profile that ha a touch of grains. This moves into a deeper, richer chocolate flavor that is really nice. Next up is a nice touch of smokey meatiness (more smoke than meat). Finishes with lingering meats. Mouth is full bodied with good carbonation. This is a solid, solid beer. Takes rauchbier to a nice level, as the smoke is in the background, not the forefront, complementing rather than dominating the pallet.

Taste is of smoked malt up front with some dark fruits and cocoa powder on the finish. A smoky, roasted bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip.

Pours the color and clarity of cola with a half inch, khaki-colored head embedded with tiny ringlets that eventually dissipates into a soapy skim. Exceptional nose on this brew - smoky, dark fruits (figs and dates) as well as an earthy quality and grape and bubblegum notes. Taste follows nose; however, much more smokey than suggested by the nose. Chocolate and roast are also revealed in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light in consistency, perhaps a little thin for the style, with a lively carbonation and a slightly oily texture. This is definitely one of my favorite Baltic Porters. Not only is it delicious, but there is great complexity to this brew. Another top notch offering from Surly.","Jwale73","Aug 29, 2011"

4.22,3.4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Surly Smoke is a one-of-a-kind beer. Who else brews a smoked porter with lager yeast? The end result is brilliance! Never have I had a smoked porter with such a smooth mouthfeel. Usually, the smokey malts work with the smoked malts to give a super smokey smoked smorgasboard. Is that too much of a mouthful? Yes! Yet Surly brillianltly uses the subtle workings of lager yeast to mellow out the overwhelming smoked malts. End result is an entirely too-quaffable brew that I wish I had more of. Certainly there is smoke in the nose and on the tongue but good gosh, it is not at all bitter. In fact, there is a light sweetness that plays nicely against the smoke. Kudos to Surly for setting my new standard for smoked beer.","dnrobert24","Jul 15, 2011"

Similar to Weyerbacher Fifteen but much creamier. However, after sipping on it for 10-15 minutes, the smoked bacon taste starts to take over a bit much for me. This beer is so creamy and delicious but starts to become a little too sweet and smokey for my liking. I really loved it at first, and by the end I had grown tired of it.

Poured pitch black with a very minimal slight tan head. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, and smoke. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoke, caramel, and chipotle. It had a medium feel on the palate with no carbonation to speak of. Overall this was a pretty good brew. MASSIVE smoke going on here (as would be suggested by the name). Even with this fact, it was still pretty nicely balanced. This is a must try if you get an opportunity.","thagr81us","Beers"

It had a very nice smoke aroma upfront but had roasty character, mild chocolate, faint caramel and slight chipotle pepper notes. The roasted character and chocolate flavors were more apparent on the palate with caramel smokey accents with a touch of chipotle peppers whicxh added a little zing in the back of the throat. The brew was medium to full in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a smokey, roasty, subtle sweet, and slight spicey finish.

The beer pours a beautiful darkness topped by a finger of tan foam. The smell is mostly smoke with perhaps a bit of chocolate, though there is so much smoke it's hard to tell. The flavor is thankfully toned down on the smoke to the point of near perfection. There is also a malty sweetness that comes through to help complement the smoke that is on the palate.

I keep tasting it and while it is carbonated and therefore doesnt feel like a wine, it is bitter and roasted and that is not like a wine, the flavor keeps tasting like a string, rich, extracted, powerful wine.

The taste holds notes of sweet syrup, molasses, brown sugar, spruce, and caramel up front, leading a healthy puff of light smoke. The flavors may not necessarily stand on an equal footing with the smell, but they do come very close. And, besides, it's still pretty damn tasty regardless. The body is a hefty medium, with a lightly moderate carbonation and a rich, oily feel (and I mean that in a good way). I am very pleased, indeed, to have been able to try this beast.

As in the aroma, the smokiness isn't as intense as expected. Only subtle hints of vampire, butane, bacon, charcoal, BBQ, etc. integrated into the flavor. Very complex, excellently balanced and the high ABV is pretty well masked, making this beer ery quaffable. I really enjoyed this beer but didn't find it as smokey as I expected or hoped for.

The smoke character is moderate to low and is well integrated. Licorice is noticeable mid-palate. Alcohol does appear on the finish that's dry, fruity, a little smoky and a little astringent. There's also a touch of Splenda-like sweetness on the finish. These two do detract marginally from a great experience. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this is a very enjoyable beer.

Smelled of slight smoke and a subtle sweetness. What a taste though! Very smooth with a slight smoke taste that ends with a subtle sweetness, just like the smell I guess. Very drinkable!

I detect an alcoholic, brandy-like smell. The taste is wonderfully complex, with a cherry brandy flavor, along with a smoky toasty chocolate malt presence, as well as a slight taste of vanilla. There is just enough hop presence to balance the other flavors. This is a terrific tasting beer, with rich and lingering flavors. The high alcohol content is the only thing marring the drinkability.

The taste follows the same lines, but better, more complex perhaps, the chocolates and caramels and toffees peeking out. The smoke is still understated, any meaty connotations well balanced.

The phenolic (slightly medicinal) nature is a little strong for my personal taste. But it adds some character. The beer is medium bodied. Slightly alcoholic. Flaccid feel.
