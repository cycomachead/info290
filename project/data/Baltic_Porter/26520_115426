It tastes like all of those things fuzed very well into a serious Baltic porter. Smooth mouthfeel,just delicious. The reason I didn't give it a five all around is because the peanut butter is strong at first in smell and taste and then is overcome by the jam as the beer warms. It's delicious though.

The bourbon is a little too harsh and overpowers the beer to an extent but a couple months of age on this should mellow it out. Raspberry is wonderful and really adds a nice layer of complexity to the beer.

4.62,11.1,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,"Overall: Fantastic. I've never had a ""peanut butter"" beer and didn't know what to expect. The peanut butter comes through fantastically, being subtle enough not to dominate, but its presence is welcomed and adds substantially to the flavor profile. The raspberry is very subtle but also present and gives just a little extra surprise to make this something special. I had this at the brewery and thought it was great, but out of the growler - a little warmer - this is amazing. Let this one warm up to get the true experience.","Resuin","Mar 12, 2014"
