"similar to the rest of them. just has a slight unpleasant edge that the others do not."

"Pours a three finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Good carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Roasted malt nose and flavor follows with roasted malts and hints of hop bitterness. Light bitter aftertaste. High ABV is hidden. $3.70 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."

"I have one more Framinghammer to try (Coconut, I think), but this one is the winner so far with respect to flavor and feel."

"O - wow so good. I think I had one of these fresh once and the year on the shelf really pushed it over the top. Cheers!"

"O - A terrific BA Baltic Porter with coffee added. Reminds me of a local favorite, Tyranena Devil Over a Barrel, but even better."
"Big, roasty, malty and a little sweet. This drinks like a stout. I was a little skeptical but this is quite good."

"Good stuff, just not as great as I thought it would be. I figured it would be more smooth, being a lager, but it is good nonetheless."

"my brother has really been coming through with the goods lately, so thanks man for pulling this one off. its as good as all the others, again blows me away that its a lager, and although the coffee is light on the aroma, its taste and contribution to the mouthfeel are very prominent. matte black beer, heady and thick, inviting like a guinness really, lighter head, but similar vibe. the nose is mild on the coffee, way more barrel and lager yeast here, vanilla is as prominent as it was in the vanilla edition, not sure how they got all that from the barrel, but they did. in the flavor, the coffee is darkly roasted, earthy, and bitter enough without being harsh. its smooth and full bodied, and the booze is invisible. i definitely feel it after half a bottle though! stunning in its depth, awesome in its slick richness and dry finish, like no other in the feel. the coffee does add a little acidity, but its mild and actually helpful here. the barrel is more pronounced in the nose than the taste, but it definitely adds that sweet oak to an otherwise dry finish. expertly made, this is one of the best series in beer right now!"

"Great Beer!! Full body for a porter, dark color, not to sweet, not boozy. Barrel on the nose, big coffee flavor."

"A very dark shade of brown. Not quite black in color. Still a bit translucent around the edges. Forms a smallish darker tan colored head that fades away fairly quickly leaving just a trace around the edge. Minimal lacing. Aroma is wonderfully potent: coffee, espresso, dark fruits, dark chocolate, and alcohol. Taste is also pleasant, but falls off a little. Again, there is coffee and dark chocolate along with a moderately sweet dark fruits and a rich maltiness. But the flavor seems somewhat thin, presumably from the alcohol. On the heavier side of medium. Lower carbonation. Mild bitterness. Overall, a very nice beer. Complex yet drinkable. A great complement to a chocolate-centric desert."

"Good coffee. Good porter. Lots of good bourbon. A little harsh."
""
""
"The coffee does not really shine through on this compared to the base, but still a fine fine brew."
""
""
""
"O - Another great variant.  Harshest of the variants that I've tried.  Gets super boozy as it warms."
"This one is a bit thicker int he mouthfeel than the vanilla.  It is full. It has a nice soft chocolatey flavor that is enhanced by coffee and bourbon.  Breaddy and with some cold coffee to come forward. Silky and a bit of creaminess lend this beer a long lasting palate with not too much bitterness. A flourish  of alcohol dryness and bitterness from roast in the finish. This one is not as sweet as the vanilla after all and that gives it a more unique character as you drink. . Warming in the swallow and that is the first hint of alcohol."

"Pours a dark brown with a real thick head. Intense coffee aroma, nice mix of creamy and sweet with fudge mixed in. Flavor is dominated by coffee but is not intense and is rather silky smooth. Good stuff!"

"Thanks, mj0126, for the opportunity"
""

"Edit: apparently this is barrel-aged according to the fine BA who sent this to me. It's now much less surprising that there was an oaky vanilla flavour along with the sweet chocolate ice cream aspects and subtle heat (presumably from the whiskey)."

"O- Between the vanilla an coffee, this was favored by all of us. A splendid melange of flavors that get to the heart of what I love in a big, dark, barrel-aged beer. I have had better, certainly... But this is a top-notch beer. A great offering in all respects."
""
""
"Probably the best Framinghammer variant, excellent stuff."

"Poured from 16 oz bottle into tulip. Deep black with a bit of tan head, gone quick. Lots of coffee and roasted malt aroma, but subtle all around and balanced. Flavor of slight roast, lots of coffee and chocolate. A touch of sweetness really balances this out. Suuuper smooth mouthfeel...its phenomenal. So silky smooth and a near gulper. Really a tasty brew and I wouldn't hesitate (except the cost) to get more of this."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, coffee bean, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, coffee, and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of wood bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a nice mix of coffee and bourbon aspects all around."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a very good big coffee porter worth drinking for a long time."

"Poured a jet black with a half inch light brown head. Dissipated with some lacing once it goes down. Great smell of bourbon, espresso, oak, and slight chocolate. The flavors come through stronger on the taste. A great sipper. Full bodied and full of flavor. Overall, prefer the regular bourbon barrel aged over the coffee and the coffee over the vanilla. All great brews."

"O- the aroma was more impressive than the taste, but overall very good. I didn’t pick up as much coffee as expected, rather more sweetness that bitterness"

"Mouthfeel is good, full bodied but not too heavy. Light to moderate carbonation level that leaves it fairly refreshing, especially for a barrel aged beer. Pretty smooth with a warm but not too hot bite at the end. The 10% is very well hidden, this is an incredibly drinkable beer. Designed to be a sipper, but if you're not careful, this is going to go really quickly. Another nice job by Jack's Abby. They know what they're doing on all aspects."
"Taste is dark maltiness to start, a touch of dark fruits in the middle, and coffee and alcohol to the close. Slight numbing after swallow. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is easy. Comes together nicely."

"Didn't believe the Framinghammer hype. I have another variant & if that one is this good, I'll be a full-blown Believer. Excellent beer."

"O: Great beer. Love the body on the beer. Strong flavors that might mellow out with some age. Alcohol on the nose is a bit much. Thankfully doesnt translate to the taste very much. Still think i like the original framinghammer the best."

"2014 vintage. 500ml bottle served in a tulip at 49 degrees. Pours darker than cola with a frothy, two-inch, khaki-colored head. Some lacing, but weak legs. Incredible nose - roasted coffee, bourbon, vanilla and toffee notes. Taste follows nose, but is not as rich and bold as anticipated. That said, everything coalesces together nicely without one aspect being too assertive. There's also a thread of milk chocolate that also weaves its way into the flavor profile and finishes with a robust, roasted coffee character. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation; however, the overall representation comes off a bit thin. One of my favorite styles, and this beer really holds its own. Not only one of the better Baltic Porters out there, but also one of the better coffee-based beers as well."
""
""
""
""
""
"M: bit thin on the palate but can't complain too much because fairly smooth from start to finish"
""
""
" O- Amazing. One of the best Baltic Porters I've had. It makes me excited to drink the rest!!!"
""
""
""
""
""

"Looks like Framinghammer (no surprise) - dark with ruby highlights, fine tan/brown cap, lacing. Lots of coconut in the aroma, some roast and coffee, chocolate and malt, slight alcohol. Less coconut in the flavour, moderate bitterness with cocoa and malt, alcohol and chocolate, mild coffee and roast, balanced sweetness. Nice texture, creamy and smooth, moderate carbonation and full bodied, a little warmer than regular Framinghammer. Quite good, but the coconut in the aroma was turned up a little high in the balance."
""
""
""
"Very rich body and flavor. Complicated malts of chocolate and some black patent, giving a definitive coffee flavor. Lots of alcohol warmth. This is particularly notable in the aftertaste. Light on the carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: In both the taste and aroma, the coffee is the dominant flavor. Everything else takes a back seat, which means this isn’t as balanced or complex as it could be. This is more like a delicious coffee porter sans the barrel aging."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Not as coffee forward as I expected, but that's actually a good thing. The beer strikes a nice balance,though the barrel takes over in the end. A sipper you absolutely must seek out if you love a good bourbon barrel aged beer."

"O - A fantastic offering. I missed out on last years version but not this time. Drinks pretty damn easy for a 10%. I love the coffee and bourbon blending but the thinner mouthfeel brings it down a tad down for me. Overall, an excellent brew and Jacks Abby continues hitting home runs. Nice job!"
"O/D-The Framinghammer family of beers is exquisite. This is my favorite one...it's close, though! Trying the variant next to the coffee variant is a good time. I personally enjoyed this one the most but honestly, it's splitting hairs. Jack's Abby is a temple!"

"O - This was probably my favorite of the three, just barely beating out the vanilla. The coffee really accentuated the base flavors and yet it remained easy to consume. Glad I could try this one and share it with everyone."
""
"Bottle. Brown-black pour with a nice off-white head. Aroma is deep espresso and milk chocolate. I also find layers of butter and cream that makes it exquisite. Taste is roasted malts, coffee and cream. So rich without being cloying and overly sweet, oats adds a nice creamy touch. Extremely well balanced imperial stout. The most intense (and best) oat stout I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Lots of barrel and coffee. Exceptional."

"D - Good stuff, although I think this may be my least favorite of the three variants. Still, it's a delicious beer that I'd happily drink again at any opportunity in the future. Perhaps a bit more coffee would bump this up to world-class."
"Overall - I enjoyed this just as much as the barrel aged without coffee. The coffee is almost too strong, but well blended."
""
"O: what a fantastic brew! We had all three variants of the beer, and this one was my favorite. Will be trading for this soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"o - Overall I really liked this one; I liked it more than the normal BA version, though not as much as the vanilla one. Tons of fresh coffe in both the nose and taste, a great coffee porter that continues to improve on a great beer. Would highly recommend checking out."
"O: Extremely impressive - excellent balance of flavors and barrel. The coffee is there and tastes very fresh, but doesn't overpower the other components. This isn't quite BCBCS (mostly because Framinghammer lacks a boozy hotness), but this IS a bba coffee beer I could drink all the time (unlike BCBCS). Just awesome stuff."
""
"Without a doubt, this is worth seeking out."
""
"After trying Framinghammer and Bourbon Barrel Aged Framinghammer and being hugely disappointed by both offerings, this beer really surprised me. The addition of coffee really rounded out the flavor profile and gave this beer the balance and complexity that the other versions lacked."
""
""
""
""
"O: One of the best coffee aromas/flavors I've ever had in a beer, but it seems like a slight mismatch with the base beer (though the base beer is outstanding, don't get me wrong). I rank it a little behind Bourbon County Coffee overall. But still excellent."
""
""
"Overall: I really like the BA Framinghammer but I liked this offering even more. Incredible coffee porter!"
""
""
"Overall great nose but that same crazy coffee grinds overpowers the flavors and gets a bit too bitter, booze is a bit strong, and the coffee drowns the other flavors too much, but I'm still nitpicking at a great beer."
""
""
""
"O: Wow, I thought the regular bourbon barrel version was amazing. This is somehow even better. Coffee is delicious and a wonderful additional layer of complexity. Yet, not overpowering like so many coffee beers. Despite being so fresh, flavors are very well integrated and complementary. Taste is smooth and mellow despite the strong flavors and goes down so easily. One of the best beers I've had in quite a while. I can't find any real flaws."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this was a solid beer, but as good as some of the notes are I still prefer the base beer to these."
""
""
"O- There is some heat still, so setting this aside for maybe 6 months may be ideal to ease that and if you don't like coffee- dominant brews, that could help as well. As a coffee fan, I think it is great now, but will likely try to keep one or two for a bit just to see how it ages. Fantastic brew and look forward to the next batch"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- The beer goes down incredibly easy for 10%. For me personally, the roasted coffee flavor is a bit dominant. Full disclosure, I'm not a coffee drinker. The aroma and mouthfeel are wonderful, but the regular bourbon Framinghammer has a lovely balance of flavors that the coffee beans seem to have overwhelmed in this variant. That said, still great."
