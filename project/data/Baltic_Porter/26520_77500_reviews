"O: Not the best porter for me, but really close.  I certainly wouldn't ever turn one away.  Super excited to try one of the variants.. I believe some vanilla would make this thing sing.  The PB&J version sounds just crazy enough to be excellent."

"A good porter, almost a stout or imperial stout by taste and feel."
""
"I'm not convinced of the hype over this beer. The taste is there. Complex, with nicely complementing flavors. However, everything else is just average. Worth trying but not a standout among its peers."

"Another really solid beer from Jack's Abby. One of the most consistent breweries around."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A great beer, and one that's extremely drinkable given the 10% ABV. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Basic baltic, some smokey malt flavors. Dark dried fruits. Very malty. Solid offering."
"Super roasty and robust. Chocolaty sweet. Got a nice smooth/thick body. Drinks like an imperial Oatmeal stout. Love it. Great for a cold winter night."

"This is an absolutely delicious Baltic Porter, on par with some of the best imperial stouts out there. Flavor really reminds me of Founders Imperial Stout."

"12oz bottle with MFG 1/30/15 on the side. Pours a pitch black color with a small amount of head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is chocolate syrup, caramel, molasses, brown sugar and roasted malts. Hints of licorice and tobacco. The taste is roasted malts and chocolate syrup with some leather and tobacco. Boozey. Some woody notes as it warms. Finishes with more tobacco, roasted malts and chocolate syrup. Hint of coffee. Slick, velvety mouthfeel. Really digging this one. I'm hoping I can get my hands on some of the variants. Overall, fantastic beer."

"Overall very smooth mouthfeel. Sharply acidic on the front, full and roasty in the middle, with a lingering, smooth, lager-ed finish."
""
"Exquisite full bodied and thoroughly enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
"I think I would need to drink a traditional Baltic in order to truly appreciate what differences, if any, I can detect from a regular strong porter. That said, this is a great beer and the other three bottles in my fridge won't last long."
""
""
""
"Overall- Real enjoyable, bitterness and sweetness play well off each other and work in balance. Sweeter flavors are quite pleasant and add an undeniable smooth quality to this beer. Roasted malts and cocoa are very forward and flavorful. Excellent offering."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite Jacks Abby brew."
""
"O: Every Jack's Abby beer I've had has been amazing and this is absolutely no exception. A strong example of everything a good porter should be, and and absolute joy to sip. Should be on every BA's ""must try"" list."

"A nearly black beer, with deep ruby/brown edges showing up only when held close to a bright light. For several seconds, cascading roils under the tan, three finger head. Said head endures a respectable time, and lacing remains as time passes and drinking proceeds. The aroma, which is not pronounced, is of freshly-baked brownies. The beer's flavor is also that of a rich, semi-sweet chocolate pastry, accompanied by a very slight alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is just right for a robust porter."

"Mouthfeel is perfect. Could end it there but I wont. Nice easy flowing medium body that has a nice carbonation level. Silky smooth with a nice dry bitter finish from the hops and maybe the coffee flavors as well. SUPER drinkable. I wouldn't have guessed this was 10%, maybe high7's low 8s, but not 10. Awesome beer, love it, the Mr. Hendler nails another one!"
""
""
"The barrel-aged version of this was rather memorable, and the base beer is unsurprisingly tasty. But I can see why there are many variations to this. It has some unexplained levels of booze that work quite well with other flavors (bourbon, for example). This is worth a try, but if I had to choose, I'd stick with one of the variants."

"Very dark, but there's a faint, clear, ruby hue to the beer when held up to bright light. Tan/brown cap of fine bubbles, lots of lacing, good head retention. Chocolatey aroma, light burnt/smoke character, cocoa and malted milk. Moderate bitterness with just a bit of alcohol. Notes of chocolate, caramel, malt, slight nut and fruit character, bittersweet finish. Creamy and smooth, mild warmth, full bodied with medium carbonation, slight dryness. Really good and super easy to drink for the abv. I'm looking forward to trying some of the other variants."
""
"Taste is sweet darkness to start, lactic sweet through the middle, and a roasty touch of acrid bitterness through the close, with alcohol coming on strong. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is scary easy. Wow. Makes me wonder how the FH variants I have waiting can possibly be any better."

"I've loved the BA variants and it's a pleasure to see where these beers began. A fantastic Baltic Porter."
""
""
""
"O: Ahhh, a baltic porter like no other. As of this moment, Jack's Abbey brews 4 out of my top 4 baltic porters (this and the 3 barrel aged variants). Talk about domination of a category. Only thing that comes close is maybe Smuttynose Baltic Porter? Anyway, great example of the style. It's not a big stout like some, it's a proper baltic porter. Nice fruitiness, nice toasted/roasted malt, super drinkability (one of the easiest drinking 10% brews ever). Just a great brew, only made better by the barrel aging of the variants."
""
""
"An impressive baltic porter. Recommendable."
""
""
""
"O - Tasty, smooth and warming. Nice for a cold New England night."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is no wonder that the BA variants are so good. I am glad I had this a few times before reviewing it because it just seems to get better and better each time. Jacks Abby is the best brewery in MA for a reason, well many reasons."
""
""
""
""

"O - Another excellent beer from Jack's Abby. The alcohol in this one is a little stronger than I like, and the couple Imperial Stouts that I've had recently compared favorably to this one."

"O - Smooth beer, very solid Baltic Porter, not extraordinarily complex, but very robust in the flavors and characters it does express."
"Cheers Adam!"
""
"O: A very solid baltic porter with great balance and complexity. The 10% is very well hidden and sneaks up on you. Definitely well-suited for the winter months as well. If you liked the 3 BA variants, you'll like this one as well, as it's definitely a solid base for those"

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and slight smoke aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and smoke flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty with a nice smoke presence."
""
""
""
"Very tasty beer with additional flavors as it warms. The smooth, creamy body is wonderful."
"O-Received as an extra so unsure about the price, but a solid Baltic Porter and if it is like other Jack's Abby beers it would be worth the price."
""
""
"Pours a Beautiful tan two finger heady. Nice and frothy that rests just at the top of my tulip glass. Leaves great lacing as it settles down rather slowly. Smells lil roasted malts, maybe a little chocolate and coffee there. Something else I can't put my nose on. Some Sweetness. A lot of roastiness on the taste. Very creamy. Dark chocolate, as well. Thick enough to coat the mouth but not too much that it's a hard one to drink, very smooth. Incredible that this is 10%.I'm picking up a burnt marshmallow taste at the end. I don't think it's overly complex, but its a very flavorful beer and an easy to drink porter. Can't wait to try the barrel aged version!"
""
"This beer really drinks easily and hides it's ABV very dangerously. It could be a bit more robust on the flavors, but a good job at the style."

"The beer pours practically like motor oil, thick and black with just a hint of coffee “browness” reflecting back at the eyes. It forms a beautiful, dark tan head of creamy, small bubbles that settle around a finger’s width above the glass. In body, the beer’s clarity is hard to discern, seeing as how it is totally opaque. The beer seems thick and viscous, but clear of any particles or cloudiness, but that is just going off of what I saw pour into my glass. On the nose, the beer smells magnificent. Dark roasted coffee with a thick nuance of dark fruits like brown sugar and raisins, plums, and just a touch of sweet cherries. Soft char, and a nuttiness also make their way into the nose, along with spicy licorice. Touches of caramel and toffee do blend in with the coffee as the beer swirls around the glass. On the tongue, the beer tastes initially sweet, but then dries out beautifully into gentle coffee bitters with touches of dark fruitiness, and even a light sense of spice. Acidity is light to nonexistent on the palate. Alcohol is just an afterthought at the end of the sip, providing a light heat and spice to the finish, which is very impressive given the beer’s 10% ABV. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet bread, but swiftly unfurls into light char, rich coffee, dark and bitter chocolate, and touches of molasses. Burnt raisins and brown sugar come to mind as the sip hits the mid-palate, along with a nice nuttiness that I also found in Jack’s Evil Brew, and even a touch of toffee on the finish. In the third quarter of the sip is a burst of spice blending a touch of cinnamon with licorice for a nice burst of flavor. The finish is strong but muddled. The flavoring is peculiarly light with coffee, and brings more spice, light alcoholic heat, and even a touch of cherry into play on the palate. There is even a bit of meaty flavoring on the end of the finish, almost like a Christmas Ham… The aftertaste is more expected with roasted malt, coffee, and char lingering on the tongue. I love this beer until the finish, and though it is not awful, the muddling has me confused. In the mouth, the beer feels full bodied and smooth. Velvety carbonation of an above average rate helps to coat the tongue in softness as the beer displays its chewy, yet smooth quality. The mouth is left wet all over with a lingering roast-bitter tingle and a slight warmth in the gullet. Overall, this is a great thick beer that is perfect for sipping in front of a fire. I wasn’t quite as fond of it as I was of its barrel-aged variant, mostly because of the oddness of the finish. The flavors are not awful by any stretch, but merely peculiar and out of place with what I was expecting. This is a good beer that gets even better after sitting down in a barrel."

"This ones pours chocolate brown in the glass with a pillowy brown head. The scent is some roast and lots of chocolate. The taste follows through. It's a rich coffee-like chocolate flavor. Lots of flavor in this one, and you get the booziness but not a burning heat. Very well crafted beer and the mouthfeel is true to style with the lager body."
""
""
""
""
""
"Starts with chocolate malt flavor. The malted aspects of the darker, more coffee-like malts show up in the swallow. Relatively thin body; high carbonation. Long aftertaste of dark cherry and the aforementioned mocha. I don't notice the alcohol despite the level of it."

"o: A special, tasty and easy-drinking porter that feels good just to swirl in your mouth. Would like to see this in sixpacks like Hoponius Union but that probably won't happen. I do appreciate the unique approach of European size bottles, but at nearly $5 a take-home pint this is not likely to be on many drinkers' list of regulars. Nonetheless, this could definitely spoil me for any other Baltic Porter."

"O- this beer really delivers on the bitter dark chocolate fix, but is a tad one dimensional. Fortunately I'm very fond of bitter cocoa, this was pretty easy to put down in spite of the 10% abv."

"Overall nice but doesn't seem as high quality as most of the Jack's Abby beers, esp since I had the barrel aged version of this and it was phenomenal. Maybe this is a bad batch, or my taste buds are off. Malts are nice but a bit syrupy, nice crisp lager coming through, decent hops to balance, but a couple slight flaws I think."

"Served in a tulip nonic. Pours a dark brown, almost black, with ruby highlights around the base when backlit. Head is a 1/2 in thickness, dense, creamy and tan-colored and embedded with tiny pinpricks. Head eventually dissipates into a soapy slick with some swaths of lacing present during the tasting. Nose expresses roasted malts, lager yeast and dark, slightly vinous fruits and cocoa. Taste follows nose; however, the fruit profile is not overly assertive and melds with the roasted malts and cocoa. There is also an earthy hops bittering and a bit of ethanol (more flavor than heat) at the back that leaves a slightly acrid aftertaste between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with an even carbonation and some mild acidity attributable to the alcohol. Overall, a solid baltic porter with both complexity and balance. That said, I continue to be impressed by this young brewery's innovation and quality."

"I find the flavor to ring of mostly molasses with a bit of spice to it - I really can't tell you if that's a cinnamon or a clove or anything else but I think of this beer flavor as having hints of that fall spice motif but with a much stronger smokiness. It causes the sides of the back of my tongue to twinge a little, but the way a good hot sauce causes your mouth to burn just a little - you notice it but it does not dissuade your next sip."

"O/D-I love big Porters. This one is pretty tasty. Jack's Abby makes some awesome brews and this is just another that should be tried when available."
""
""
"O - Overal this is a very, very tasty baltic porter. Jacks Abby continues to impress."
"Mouthfeel is nice as well- medium to full bodied with a little carbonation. Definitely a nice Baltic porter- get it if you see it and live darker beer."

"At first it almost reminds me of a less smoky version of their other dark beer, the smoke and dagger. But after a few sips the ABV really starts to sneak up on you. This is such a well-balanced Baltic Porter. It’s not in your face with malt, or hops. According to the brewery, much like all other JA’s beers, the beer is actually a lager and not an ale like most Porters. That definitely accounts for the very smooth and easy drinking of this beer. Almost reminds me, at least in the sipping sort of way, an English Barleywine vs American Barleywine in that it’s not over the top in any area, but just right in a good malty sort of way. Just another stellar beer from Jack’s Abby."
