review_text
"Pours a moderate head, under a finger, mostly larger bubbles which sizzle off quickly, there is some lacing but it’s extremely thin lines with not great stickiness. The liquid is a murky brown, fully opaque, develops a yellow tint at the rims and surface, you can see a few strands of bubbles within but you are more likely to spy particulate floating about. The nose is at once compact and expressive, German chocolate cake, licorice, vanilla cake icing, toffee, kind of too sweet for real smokiness to  show, curious lack of fruit scents, quiet raisin and prune at best, lingers with minimal effort. Full-bodied, layers creamily on the tongue, however, here you get something like bitter chicory which brightens the attack. Low carbonation, more fluffy than refreshing. Licorice, pine sap, crème brûlée, molten chocolate, roasted chestnuts and scone flavors keep the sweetness on parade, one could argue there is an uptick in the plum, prune, raisin, cherry fruit. The finish is somewhat flat-footed, yet no faulting the intensity of the flavors it chooses to spotlight. Does a reasonably good job of masking the alcohol."

"Awesome flavors, really smooth and absolutely no alcohol present. Not one bit. Awesome!"

"O- I feel like this was the perfect time to crack this one.  Aged over 2 and a half years, it's snowing outside and I just got off work, so the warmth of the booze plus the tastiness really hits the spot.  Cheers."

"A very sublime, smile-producing dark ale. Rich, robust, and balanced with an exquisite flavor complexity. A dark malt treasure with no distracting alcohol heat even with it's 11.0% ABV. An exceptional example of what a big beer can be..."

"Picked this up at the beer store at Brouwerij De Molen. Bottled 05/04/12. Dark brown, nearly black pour with a one finger beige head with good retention and lacing. The nose is dominated by dark fruit and brown bread along with hints of toffee, butterscotch, and coffee. The taste follows suit with huge brown bread, raisins, and dates, along with hints of molasses, licorice, subtle chocolate, booze, and coffee. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a sweet, boozey finish. Overall, this is a little too sweet for my tastes and really lacks any kind of roast. More like a Barley Wine for me than a Porter. I remember having this on tap several years ago at ACBF and really liking it, but this was a bit disappointing..."

"Bottled on 05/04/12.Pours a deep dark cola color with a creamy half finger beige head atop.Aromas of dark roast coffee,raisin/prune,and earth with the alcohol being big but not in ur face.Wow alot going on flavor wise with dark fruit and dark roast intertwined with big earthy tones giving a great drying lager-like finish.This is a great Baltic porter with just enough sweetness and just enough drying earthiness,top notch."

"Pours a dark reddish brown with thick head of dense light brown foam, sheet of delicate lace halfway down the glass. Smell: buttered and toasted brown bread, raisin, fig, dark chocolate. Taste: huge dark fruit flavors and light on the roast. Plum, raisin, dates, dark brown sugar, into toasted brown bread with very mild roast and a moderate earthiness. Medium body with plenty of delicate carbonation to move things along. Silky feel with a quick jab of alcohol near the end of the sip. Sticky brown sugar and raisin finish. Bottled 4/12."

"O: Definitely recommended. It smells like a porter and tastes like a slightly sweet stout."

"And hence Tsarina Esra is a little sweet for my tastes. The prunes-meets-rum cake profile isn't exactly what I look for in the Baltic (or any kind of) Porter style and this makes it a tough one to recommend, especially given the rarity and price on this side of the world. De Molen remains one of the best Dutch breweries I've tried, but they have better offerings than this."

"O: extraordinary. My admiration exceeded my considerable enjoyment."

"The taste is a balanced between the dark malts and the alcohol and bitterness. The dark malts offer a dark chocolate and coffee taste, the alcohol is not upfront, but it gives the beer a warming sensation and a big mouthfeel. The bitterness is 93 EBU according to the label, but never mouthpuckering bitter. As said, the beer is very balanced. The high density of the beer gives it a bit of a sticky mouthfeel, but this is very well crafted with only malts."
"O - Other De Molen 'big dark' brews I've had have been nice but always somehow fell short of their potential through big sweetness, booziness, minimal carbonation, etc. This one avoids those pitfalls and delivers on all fronts. Definitely enjoyed it after some aging. Complex and incredibly smooth and drinkable, the 330ml solo was a little too easy."
""
"Overall this is not a beer I would really go after trying again."
"Taste is very smooth with the alcohol very well hidden. In the aftersip you get the alcohol."
"11.2 ounce bottle, stamp on back label says 05/04/12. Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like dark fruit, chocolate, licorice, bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some milk chocolate and a bit of an earthy/herbal flavor noticeable. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and slick, and has a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a good brew, but also pricey at $8.99 a bottle. With that being said, it's definitely worth trying."

"Deep brown colour, ring of tan head with not much in the way of lace either. Smell is of burnt coffee beans, bitersweet chocolate and darker fruits, just a hint of alcohol, but fairly robust and roasty overall. Taste is of dark chocolate cake, a bit of coffee as well, herbal-black liquorice flavours and mild dark fruit, a bit of booze with a bittersweet finish. Lightly carbonated, fairly full feel. A great porter, nice rich layerd flavour here probably as a result of aging."
"Bottom Line: Porter lovers grab this puppy and hold on tight!"

"O- Appareance and smell were quite promising but the taste was a total letdown. This is an unbalanced beer, no fine brewing work here, and really not worth it's price"
"Tsarina Esra is a nice porter, but I can't see going back to this one anytime soon. Definitely, one to pick up if you like the style. It is a touch pricey like all De Molen beers are in the US, but if you can get past that try this one!"

"Drinkability : a nice beer in the style Imperial or Baltic Porter."

"Generous extra courtesy of KingKong. 330ml bottle served in a tulip. 05/04/2012 indicated on the back label. Pours two shades shy of black with a 1.5 inch, tight, mocha-colored head. Head eventually disperses into a sudsy, broken froth. Interesting nose - malted milk balls and dark fruit. Taste follows nose; however, there's also a slight metallic character interspersed in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a slightly creamy texture and a very mild, even carbonation. Overall, a very good Baltic Porter; however, it may be heading a bit down hill as I'm getting some traces of oxidation. I'd love the opportunity to try this on draft at some point."

"A rather pleasant porter overall, the chocolate dialed up, the sourness dialed down, and the alcohol somehow off in another dimension, or something. Lots of flavour to go around, and really nothing to keep you from enjoying this like I would imagine the titular Russian empress would."
"330ml bottle. Snifter glass. Enjoyed on sep´12. Dark mahogany color & tan headed. Lasting thin layer is left on top. To the nose roasted malt & fudge chocolate aromas, floral fragrances & spiced touches. Creamy & sweet malty sensation. Full body. Soft carbonation. Oily & dense. Herbal & bitter cocoa in the middle. Sligthly sugary aftertaste. Incredible well hidden ABV!!"

"Pours black with some dark brown just barely showing on the edges. Small-ish mocha-colored head with lots of fine bubbles. It's actually a pretty decent head for the abv. The aroma has a lot of tasty milk chocolate but seems a bit simple otherwise. There's a lactic edge with a whole bunch of cocoa, so basically milk chocolate. There's a definite caramel malt backbone and a bit of fruitiness to the beer, but it's buried in chocolate. A very light touch of booze. There's probably a light mineral-ish hop flavor, as well, but it's not easy to pick out. The taste is sweet, and while there's a bit more depth, the beer is still on the simple side here, as well. Lots of milk chocolate but a bit more malt and hop complexity, particularly in the finish. It's not quite roasty, but there's a darkly toasty malt flavor in there. The milk chocolate sweetness just doesn't relent, though. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. Very good. This is a nice beer, but I was hoping for more. I tried the recent Evil Twin stout and porter brewed at De Molen, and they were great. So, I guess I had my hopes up for this beer and a couple others. While this is a good beer, I don't think it's worth the price tag."
"I'm happy with this one and might buy one or two to sit on, I doubt I'll age it for the 25 year potential I see printed on the bottle but I'm sure a year or two would do it some good"

"Perfect beer to end the day with. Very satisfying in taste, smell and mouthfeel. If you dig the style you have here a very fine example. My favorite beer from Brouwerij de Molen so far."
"O: A nice, solid porter with a lot of flavor. A very enjoyable beer that I would definitely have again."

"So, the tsar has fallen but tsarina still holds the throne. (330 ml, into tulip)"
"D - I had a bottle of this when Menno was in town and it wasn't nearly as good as this one. Perhaps some vintages have held up better than others. 18cl is the perfect serving for this sort of beer if your drinking for one. Hopefully the batch released stateside recently will be as enjoyable."
""
"Pours a dark root beer color with a very small quickly dissipating head. Smells of booze, figs, dark overly ripe plums. First sip is complex yet in many ways rather simple. Deep roasted malts, dark fruits, hazel nuts and a tad of brown sugar comprise the taste. The beer is slightly under carbonated and that hurts the mouthfeel. Pretty damn tasty. Drank side by side with a 2012 version bought stateside. 2010 was hands down better and really seemed liked a different beer. The 2010 had yeast in the bottle and was bottle condition while the 2012 was not bottled condition. Really cool to have two different years side by side."
""
"O: Too many baltic porters are almost indistinguishable from an imperial stout. This one is not. Very fruity without a huge amount of roasted malt like you'd get in an IS. Drinkability is shockingly high for an 11% brew, it's very smooth and creamy and a delight to drink. Excellent baltic porter, possibly the best I've had."
"overall: I'm tending to give this one a 5 actually. But usually i only get there after i had a few. This is the one i'd go back to the brewery for so far, after bringing back a whole case of ""The Molen"" bears last time as tasters. It's quite alcohol heavy, but you don't get none of that when drinking (after maybe ;)). It has such a great flavor balance. I like porters, but most of the time they are just a touch off balance. It's too bitter, too milky or whatever. This one seems to do everything right. Highly advised!"

"Overall: With winter on its way, this was a great choice for an evening sipper! I wish I had another bottle."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. Initially it is pretty bold with alcohol that tapers off and becomes more enjoyable. It also has a little bit of awkward flavors as aromas that seemingly burn of as the experience continues. Not a bad brew but also not something I would get terribly excited over getting to try again. The small format of this bottle was quite ample to get a feel for."
"This was a solid Imperial style Baltic Porter that definitely had some strength behind it but the flavors here never did quite get as deep or robust as they felt like they wanted to. The alcohol also got to be a little bit intrusive here as well. This was certainly good but ultimately didn’t leave a huge impression on me."
""
"O: Sharp and off. Hodge podge of really weird tastes and characteristics. Unpleasant from start to finish and thoroughly not enjoyable. Not sure if the bottle is/was infected or what, but this was just a bad beer. Sad, because I really enjoyed the Tsarina Esra Reserva that was consumed side-by-side with this."
"OVERALL: This stuff really is world class. The previous small batch was flat, unfortunately, but this one is just as good as I remember the earlier batches being. A great look with a huge nose and piles of delicious flavor. Only the relatively aggressive heat keeps this one from scoring like a champ. Definitely worth the trouble if you get the chance. Highly recommended."

"Overall: Recommended. A good Baltic Porter."
"Notes: Again De Molen offers a tremendous dark brew, well not that their hoppy stuff is mediocre, quite the contrary… But these dark ales have a richness and palate of their own. Well, worth the paid price for this little bottle."
"Overall: Wow, what a beer! Only disadvantage is (again) the low carbonation of this the molen beer."
"O- great flavor profile with good complexity. Im not sure what the intention was with the carbonation, but if it had more, this would have been solid."
"Poured dark reddish brown color with an average frothy brown head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy roasted malt, dark fruit and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy dark fruit sweet flavor with medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to moderate to long duration. Solid complex beer."
"This is the 2009 bottling. 18cl."
"Worth trying."
"Thanks, Arne. Opaque viscous black with a thin brown crust. Black licorice aroma is prominent, and there's a faint charred undertone along with a bit of molasses sweetness. Palate is very viscous, and the flavors mirror the aroma pretty closely, with strong black licorice flavors, molasses, earthy bitter hops, brown sugar cookies and a touch of alcohol. Really nice stuff, this brewery continues to impress me."
"Solidly coffee-black, with no real head nor highlights. Fabulously rich aroma - especially full of sherry flavors, solvent and unfinished birch wood; there's also an akavit-like character of raw alcohol and carraway, as well as some nice herbal notes. Anise, coriander, and artichoke come together for an Italian bitter flavor. Rich and heavy, rummy and bold but neither too sweet nor too sharp - a rare, well-integrated 11% stout. Chocolate, toasted coconut, and black currants contribute nuance to the thick brew. This is earthy and a little bit strange, but also mighty delicious. An impressive imperial stout."
"180 ml waxed bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Also sampled at Olympen, Oslo. ABV is 11%. Bitterness 92,9 EBU. Pitch black colour, no head, hardly any carbonation. Lovely vinous and roasty aroma, dark dried fruits, oak. Roasty flavour with oaky and vinous notes, distinct hoppy bitterness in the finish. Good stuff!"
"Bottle number 640 of 823. Bottled 1/11/2007. The beer pours dark brown to black with a very small tan head. The aroma is roasted malt, teriyaki and soy sauce. The flavor is more of the same with roasted malt, teriyaki and some light smoke. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Notes: Pretty nice porter, with some strong flavors that evolve through drinking it."
"An interesting beer that I could wish had a touch of light carbonation, but really still drinks pretty well without it. I am not sure if this will actually make 25 years, but it has lasted the past two pretty well."
"This is an excellent beer that I think would be absolutely world class if it had a shade more carbonation. As it is, the look and feel take a hit from the complete lack of carbonation. The nose and taste are exceptional with tons of complexity and all kinds of different flavors coming out. Interesting and tasty."
"This was my last beer of the tasting and not a bad one to end on before going to bed on that super comfortable Motel 6 mattress, would like to try the reserve version now and compare them, first beer from De Molen and it did not disappoint, would drink again, recommended"
"Good but the lack of carbonation was a big detriment."
"A tremendous beer, bottle number 75. Challenger hops, and saaz for aroma. Sent from Holland, fresh. Left it for about 24 hours, yet it kept foaming over, foam eventually almost disappeared,still tasted carbonated. Jet black.Aroma of cocoa and licorice. First maltiness, then the hop bitterness comes at you and builds up over (several) glasses. 92 IBU, an outstanding effort for its class-I would take this over many great imperial stouts."
"Truly an outstanding beer. Has an incredibly unique spiciness and a very smooth taste. My only complaint is the lack of carbonation... ZERO. Perhaps I got a poor bottle, but the beer certainly didn't taste spoiled. This beer had no bubbles, no lacing, no legs, and tasted kinda flat, but was exceptional nontheless."
"D: This one'll kick your butt if you're not careful, and likely even if you are. A beer to be respected, but definitely one to try - very unlike a lot of other baltic porters I've had."
"A very interesting, and altogether quite tasty, beer. This one really doesn't fit any one style perfectly. Probably best not to go in expecting a traditional Baltic Porter."
"Thanks Jan (from De Bierkoning) for hand delivering this Bottle #101. What an amazing porter; aroma was roasted malt with slight Smokey flavors, strong licorice, more alcohol aroma as it warmed. I had plenty of frothy brown head after the initial pour. Taste was outstanding for this porter; full-bodied with plenty of bitter chocolate, coffee, slight tobacco flavor with an oily feel; very drinkable considering how high the alcohol level. Can't wait to get some more of this stuff!"
"Drinkability: All in all, it really is a fine beer."
"Normally I do not rate much beers. I'm simply too lazy. But to rate this one I had to enter a few other ratings to get to 20 reviews so I could enter this new beer to the database. And I think it was was worth it. This beer is absolutely the best beer ever brewed during the last 40 years (before that I have no knowledge) in the Netherlands. Just amazing. I do like porters and stouts a lot. And this Baltic Porter has all it needs. The aroma is very strong, chocolate, roasted, malty, hops. The flavor just the same. And the mouthfeel. How do they do it? It's so full, so warming, so silky and oily, so warming. And above all that so well balanced. The only others that I had that come close are Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter and Thirsty Dog Siberian Night."
