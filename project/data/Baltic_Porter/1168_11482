The smell on this beer is absolutely stunning with sweet bourbon notes. Taste and mouthfeel is silky smooth. Could drink lots of this on a nice winter evening!

The flavor has a really incredible bourbon presence with some dark fruits backing things up. Nice oak. Roasted malt is nice, and there's a bit of chocolate as well.

4.62,5.2,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Jet black pour with a reddish head. They pour it with very little head to get the maximum amount of beer in the glass. The head was about a 1/4 inch. Big bourbon on the nose. It demands center stage of the smell. Fig and dark fruit with a touch of chocolate are faint but there. Very little carbonation. I was expecting as much. Bourbon in the mouth as well. There is a slight burn but not off putting. This beer is 15% folks, it's bound to be there but the taste is so damn good. I've noticed certain bourbon barrel beers taste like roasted coconut to me. This one does as well. Bourbon, roasted coconut, char, and some bakers chocolate. Heavenly. Glad I finally had this and I hope the people I sent the growlers to enjoy it equally as much.","TheDudeRules","May 30, 2011"

4.27,-2.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"D: What a beer! Nine times out of ten I would prefer the bourbon notes to be more restrained than they are in this one, but for some reason I think this one manages to pull such a bold character of. Although the beer is completely dominated by bourbon, it's still rather complex (wouldn't dare to call it balanced though). It's also important to note that you can really tell that it's an imperial porter rather than an imperial stout; it doesn't have the big body, nor the massive roasted malt character of an imperial stout. And I think this plays an important part in the success of the beer, since a bigger body, stickier texture and bigger roasted flavors would probably be to much with all the bourbon. With the porter backbone, it actually manages to come out as almost easy to drink.","ricke","Mar 16, 2009"

Taste follows with a rich sweet maltiness, strong vanilla notes, dark berry fruitiness, strong alcohol warmth in the finish is very large but on par for the size of the beer. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, low in carbonation, but the carbonation that is there is creamy and adds to the fullness on the tongue. A bit of a bite from the alcohol at the back of the throat before it warms into the somewhat dry finish.

In the taste, a little cocoa and coffee back up the liquor, but I think the BCS is much more balanced by comparison.

Bourbony with a stomach turning type alcohol or it could be from the overly sweet elixir. However the beer is very good and desserty. Dark chocolatey ver dark fruits and brown sugar/mollasses. Creme freche. Thin and oily, and too sweet to drink many of.","mcallister","Sep 18, 2007"
4.12,-6.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"I had this on tap at Barley Johns and again at the Autumn Brew Review. Very dark/black in pour. Overpowering bourbon and oakish aroma with some dark fruit as well. Slightly sweet prune or molasses with a heavy bourbon overtone and the alcohol is noticable.","KAF","Jun 25, 2007"

2.64,-39.9,4,2.5,2.5,2,3,"Hand bottle courtesy of Stine: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a small dirty brown foamy head. Aroma of bourbon is quite overpowering with some sweet malt notes also noticeable. Taste is overpowered by bourbon and I had a hard time picking-up other flavour. Body is quite full with alcohol from the barrel really coming out. I was a bit surprised as I was not expecting so much bourbon to come out in such fashion and I am probably not the biggest bourbon fan around.","Phyl21ca","Oct 20, 2006"
4.5,2.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Its nice when you get a whiff of a highly rated beer and know instantly it isnt all hype. Rich milk and dark chocolate, blueberry, coffee, cream,fudge brownies, molasses, caramel and vanilla. The chocolate/fudge and coffee elements are strongest, but the blueberry fruity notes make a decent showing. There is a slightly dusty note in the tail end of the aroma. Quite varied and concentrated though. The body is deep black and holds a slowly diminishing thumb thick mocha head that compresses to nickel thickness. Slightly hot boozy notes in the first sip followed by burnt/bitter roast and coffee notes. Unsweetened bakers chocolate, low sweetness dark fruits, very light bourbon notes. The mouthfeel is actually very porter-y despite the massive un-porter 13% abv. which youd think might make it more an Imperial stout in thickness. The finish is vanilla, sweet cream, brown sugar and some more dark fruit notes this time lucious grape, raisin and prune. Doesnt dissapoint. Great range. Seems to dip slightly in inteisity through the middle ranges, but the finish is very enjoyable and it drinks damn easy for a 13% abv beer.","Jredner","Oct 03, 2006"

4.4,0.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"While picking up a growler for hopdog, figured I'd sample this fine brew myself. Glad I did too. Into a snifter glass, pours a thick black mess of liquid and massive bubbles and head, lacing all over the place, loverly. The nose is one you could just hook up to your nose and sniff for hours on end, roasted malts and grains, thick, delicious. Tastes fantastic, richly malty, slightest hint from bourbon oak aging, wonderful. Full body, could almost call it thick and creamy, but the slightest tingle of carbonation, quite nice. Now i have to ask myself, why am I not buying a grolwer for myself? Oh ya. At $1 an ounce, that adds up and it ain't cheap, but for a treat every blue moon, there is nothing better.","objectivemonkey","Beers"

4.1,-6.6,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Smells of tiramusu cake soaked in light bourbon, covered with chocolate sauce and decorated with toffee, cherries and coconut flakes, with a side of sliced apple and red wine. Near opaque black color. Initially vinous, like sweet dark fruits and red wine, whichs then falls into a roasty blast of malt, with chocolate and roast. Grapes and bourbon on the finish, with light vanilla and coconut, although not as profound as I usually prefer in a bourbon beer. Soft texture, seemingly better when served at the brewpub. A really enjoyable, unique beer.","Crosling","Jan 12, 2005"

I will definitely have to try and get some more of this one.","hopdog","May 16, 2004"
4.33,-1.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Absolute black, opaque. It was served with a tiny beige head; the retention was fair as it faded to a foamy collar, sparse in the middle. The appearance is impressive. Great color and all but the small serving glass seems to up the ante. For such a high abv beer I am impressed with the subsequent lacing, it was spotty but fairly widespread. The nose starts off with Jim Beam-like aromas with hints of cheap whiskey (possibly Old Crow), raw alcohol notes as well. Actually the nose seems like bourbon soaked mocha-chocolate coffee. The roasty coffee aromas are way in the back and just not loud enough. Regardless this bouquet is still very inviting. The potency is solid. The palate has its raw moments, they are not overwhelming, and the alcohol flavors add plenty of depth as does aging this beer in bourdon barrels. I get a lot of Jim Beam-like flavors. Awesome. The porter aspects are too secondary and mostly hidden. The chocolate, coffee notes are too weak. I am surprised that this beer is not very sweet and it is actually very dry. Quite flavorful! The finish is warm and alcoholic, bourbon, faint hints of charred wood. This is a lovely beer, something to sip and savor. I am impressed at how easy going this big, complex beer is. The mouthfeel is good but ordinary; honestly I wish it were chewier. It is a little fuller than medium, low but natural carbonation. Very good stuff here, Im glad I got the chance to try it.","bditty187","May 16, 2004"

4.32,-1.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Dark and opaque, thin spidery head with simple string lace. Heavy malts mark an aroma that only hints at what's to come. Husky carob flavors, almost chocolate but not, backed by a dried fig fruitiness. Impressive mutating flavors, switches emphasis to a more highly bittered roastiness on later sips. Substantial alcohol is decently well-hidden. In another switch, by the end of the glass (and its only a small snifter), there's a distinct sense of Oreo cookies and cream with some spiced pear up the nasal cavities. This brew is quite layered and impressive.","ADR","Aug 09, 2003"
4.82,9.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,4.5,"Taste is complex, rich, and invigorating with a ton of deep dark chocolate, some molasses, fruity-like alcohol with a dark earthy quick bite of woodyness finding some hold about midway finishing with more complexing woody earth features of sweet malty tang and bitterness with notes of flowery spice like that of dulled mustard or ginger. Wow! The bourbon barrel worked its wonders on this brew. Fantastic! Very port-like in its character. Packs a big punch in flavor and alcohol, you can tell the alcohol is there but is mildly mellow and lends the feel to be smoother then you would think. Very rich, nearly full overall in mouthfeel with a welcoming smoothness that makes this dark knight a deadly easy drinkin' Porter. Super Yum!","tavernjef","Jul 17, 2003"
4.74,8,4,5,5,4,4.5,"My cuz STUBOB and myself swung by Barley John's today and sampled this one. It was all in all a great beer. We had the pleasure of being able to talk with the brewer, head chef, and owner, John. He was a really friendly guy who was happy to talk about his beers. Anyway, on to the beer. This one came in a little snifter. It was as black as midnight with a brown head. The aroma was great. It was port-like and oaky with a nice roastiness and a bit of alcohol. My anticipation was growing. The taste was amazing, with the port, oakiness coming through. There were also flavors of dark fruits, such as figs and dates. After talking with the brewer we found that he used a high gravity Trappist yeast for this one that gave it the estery dark fruit flavors. It also had a nice roastiness to it. All in all it was a high octane brew, one to be sipped, but it was still easy drinking. An exceptional brew, probably one of the best brews I have ever had.","BeerBuilder","Beers"
