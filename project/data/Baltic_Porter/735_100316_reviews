"O: This would be my go-to pumpkin beer, if I could get it regularly."
"Overall:  This is an excellent, excellent porter, one of the best I’ve ever had in fact.  Absolutely fantastic!!  If this beer is released again next year, I’m definitely getting it again!"
""

"Good porter, but I couldn't pick up much of the pumpkin & spice."
""

"Points off for the lack of pumpkin. However, if this was ""HE SAID BALTIC PORTER"" I think it would be closer to 4.25."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I first had the He Said/He Said 4 pack in 2013, and remembered that it was good.  I'll be sure to pick some up every year from now on."

"Can shared with a friend. Pours dark black with tan head. Aroma of malts and spices. Taste of coffee, nutmeg, and clove. Not much of a pumpkin flavor at all. Dry finish. Very good."

"3.65/5.00"

"Overall... the whole is less than the sum of it's parts. The flavors are fighting here. There's no gestalt. It's lacking a unifying theme... or at least once that pulls it all together. Some interesting flavors, but not all of them are pleasant. Sorry... I've gotta drop the points down on this one."

"Dark nearly pitch black body, nice head formation with creamy tan colored head, which leaves behind speckled lacing in even patterns.  Aroma dark roasted malts, a hint of pumpkin spice, raisins/plums other ripened or dried dark fruits.  The spice is very minimal with pumpkin notes in the finish upfront dark chocolate, roasted malt character with a hint of coffee and dark fruit especially raisin notes.  Mouthfeel texture wise silky smooth even flowing carbonation medium to full bodied really nice light spice finish which doesn't linger, absolutely no alcohol burn at all very smooth.  Overall impressed with this offering, I'm glad I picked up a can of each to try the He Said, he Said combo!"

"O This is a nice thick beer and another good showing for 21st amendment. The pumpkin is light, but I prefer that. I would def. take the Tripel over this"
""
"Really this is a good beer and a unique one at that. Really great use of spices and it makes for an interesting brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  the Baltic porter aspect of this beer struggles to shine, but like all Elysian pumpkiny beers this is pretty well done.  I dig it."
""
"O: No flaws but nothing particularly exciting going on"

"If I were judging this as just a Baltic Porter, it might not fare as well as it does as a PUMPKIN Baltic Porter. That deserves BONUS points!!"

"Creamy, frothy--distinctly a porter rather than a stout."

"Thanks to Illudium for the sample!"

""
""
" picked this up at a liquor store in the boonies while traveling cross-country, and I'm sad to say I cant find it anywhere else now. Great stuff."
"A tasaty and imaginative brew."
""
""
"A well done take on a Baltic Porter, though it is certainly just as equally a Pumpkin Ale in taste in my opinion. Happy to have another can to enjoy."
""
""
"Overall: A decent porter, though I’m not entirely sure the pumpkin works as well as I might like. I wouldn’t mind trying the porter behind this beer with no pumpkin added."
""
""
"Overall, good. It's a pretty solid option for a darker stronger beer in cans. It could be better though, and it's lighter than you would expect for the ABV."
""
""
""
""
"O) 9.3"
""
""
""
"Over all not something I would buy again but it wasn't bad per say. Well to think of it its one of the better pumpkin beers I've had."
""
"Nice black and tan type pour. Aroma of hints of allspice, tiny bits of squash, and a bit of roasty malts. Flavors tend to be a bit sweet up front, then blending in a bit of the roast, while kicking up the spice note towards the finish. Pleasant pumpkiny flavors throughout, while the lingering notes lean mostly onto the spices. Tiniest hint of booze in the finish as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I enjoyed this one, I think the cinnamon having more of a presence that the other spices worked nicely with the baltic porter. Very drinkable, given the ABV. I'm usually let down by all things 21st, but this one was good"
""
""
""
""
"O- I hope the Tripel in the other half of this 4-pack is better than this. This one's just too hot."
""
""
""
"Love the color on this beer. Just a hint of that dark roast bitter making it through the spice and sugar. Lots of cinnamon and less clove, good call there guys. Coats the tongue. Goes with food or without, try some to wash down a curry, mmmm."
""
"overall: Nice brew. Interesting mix of pumpkin and aromatic spice with the malty smokiness of a Baltic."
"Overall: I'm totally okay with this beer, really."
""
"Poured from a can into a shaker pint, the beer is a very dark, blackish color with ruby highlights around the edges and a tall, frothy, foamy, chunky, small bubbled head that sits a solid inch and a half and is creamy tan colored. Slow recession of the head as you drink. Aromas of coffee roast , earthy notes, and subtle pumpkin notes. Pretty subtle notes past the coffee. Flavors are a little more pumpkin heavy, with rich notes coming forward in front of coffee bitter and roast, as well as some cinnamon and nutmeg spicing. Bittersweet baker's chocolate notes are present throughout the palate, also. Pretty dynamic, and more flavorful than I was expecting. Tasty brew. Robust flavors on a mid-bodied, dry feel throughout, with a tangy, rich sweet and fairly rigidly bitter undertone all through the aftertaste. The finish has a subtle linger of bitter and sweet, with more of the coffee and chocolate hanging around until the next sip. Solid beer!"
""
""
""
""
"I appreciate the effort to make something differen in a pumpkin beer with this one just doesn't work for me."
""
"O- well worth the try. A nice notch on the belt if you will since I have never seen this until presented to me."
""
"O: This was pretty good, but since this is one of my favorite styles, the competition is pretty fierce to my mind."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a deep dark chocolate brown with a thinner but pretty well susteined tannish colored head atop.Spiced aromas like nutmeg,mace, and cinnamon,with some roast and a tinge of iron.A little fizzy to me in the mouth and some what light as well.Flavors of pumpkin and spice with nutmeg and cinnamon standing out mainly,a little chocolate roast round out the palate.I like the concept of this beer but it's lacking a little."

"My pour began with an upright Glug as I did not want any doubt remaining as to whether Bro. Woody with the Order of Disorder were an upright soul. This resulted in two fingers of dense, deep-tan head with better-than-expected retention. It were witchcraft and so I were called in to delve to the bottom of this bloody and dismal swamp. It were a witches' brew, indeed, with a deep, murky brown color (SRM = 44 +) that burbled and popped until I came near its mess. The smell emanating from it was of Hell itself - roasting pumpkins, cinnamon, allspice, eye of newt and tail of frog ... Whoops! Satan got ahold of me briefly. Suddenly, that temptress whom I CANnot rid myself of memory, The Old Lady, appeared before mine eyes. ""Get thou back, thou reddish wench!"" I cried out. She merely smiled and beckoned me to take a draught from her chalice, somehow replacing mine own. It were as thick as baboon's blood and as spicy as her nether regions, from which I had partaken in oh, so many weak moments! I were naught but a fallen minister and she straddled atop my mouth, pouring the CANtents of CAN after CAN into mine orifice. I cried for help but none was forthcoming. The light and love that suddenly appeared from the glass demanded that I look not directly upon it. I wept whilst The Old Lady laughed but she poured yon luscious beverage into mine gaping orifice and soon we were alone. Mine breath had been taken away by the perfume of the all of the spices.I have no further words for any/all of it but words of caution. Wanderest down yon halls of ""He Said"" and ye may find yeselves in yon same predicament as yon favorite pseudo-monk: F**ked, again!"
"I've always been a fan of pumpkin porters- so much so that I've been known to mix a pumpkin beer with a good roasty porter. This one from the collaboration between 21st amendment and Elysian is a good one. I've always been a fan of Elysian's pumpkin festival, and their pumpkin beers in general. This beer has that pumpkin silkiness I'm looking for coupled with some judicious pumpkin pie spicing, and a nice roastiness as a counterpoint. Creamy finish, this is just what I'm looking for in a pumpkin porter."
""
""
"O: Overall, this does not really have any of the characteristics I would expect in a Baltic Porter but it is a really enjoyable pumpkin ale assuming that you enjoy the flavors of pumpkin pie spices."
""
"Well, this is definitely better than the other He Said (Tripel). But I do have some issues. It's overly earthy and borderline dirty. And there is an odd amount of sweetness. Overall, after having reviewed the He Said Tripel a few hours ago, I am reaching the conclusion that while 21st Amendment and Elysian are great breweries on an individual level, they do not produce magic when collaborating. Sorry."
""
""
"Mixed with the Baltic porter He Said: a far more balanced nose, spices play with pumpkin to a nice backdrop of roast. Mouthfeel is fuller than either alone, and the taste is again more balanced; it's as though one only tastes the best parts of both brews. The finish is shorter, again perfectly balanced, but at the very end becomes just a tad too vegetal. I'd rate the mix at 4.85, it is so incredibly close to the perfect pumpkin beer."
""
""
""
"O: This beer tastes a lot more like a Pumpkin Ale compared to a Baltic Porter, but when compared to pumpkin beers the taste is nearly completely dominated by spices. Provided you can handle the spices, it is easy to drink for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad but some flaws, cooked vegetables esp on the aroma are a bit of a turnoff, pumpkin was OK but a bit on the cooked side, baking spices and cocoa were nice, OK beer but could be better."
"Overall- Pretty good, more on the Baltic porter than pumpkin but the spices mix in well. I only picked up a single and while I enjoyed it, I probably wont revisit."
"Overall it's got the spiced pumpkin profile similar to it's tripel, but it's bitterness is really not in control here and doesn't make for a very enjoyable beer experience. It's ok."
""
""
"Overall – A rather tasty brew overall. Very much more on the Baltic porter side with just some lighter hints of the pumpkin pie tastes. A rather enjoyable sipper."
""
"O: The tannic bitterness was truly unbearable and making me gag. Way over spiced to enjoy any of the good qualities that are in the background."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a sam adams glass, nice head, tan, developed with good retention and lacing. Appearance was almost black in color. Aroma had notes of pine, chocolate, coffee, spice and pumpkin. Tasted of coffee and spice, strong spice, with a bite up front. Strong spice notes of of cinnamon, allspice and cardamom. Mouthfeel was medium to full with a dry and bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A bit thin and dry for a Baltic porter. The combination of roast and spice with thin body lead to an astringent finish that I don't love. Spices are very strong in this one. I wanted so much more from these guys!"
""
"This is the better of the two He Saids, for sure. It pours chestnut-dark, with a hint of translucent. A finger of tight, brownish head. The nose is spiced and deep. All the usual suspects -- clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc. The flavor is nutty and strong, with a hint of roasted barley amidst the sea of spices. Body is moderate-light, and the aftertaste is every so faintly unpleasant. A good beer, and interesting, but perhaps not worth revisiting."
""
""
""

""
"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of strong coffee, lots of roasted malts. Taste is unique and good. Roasted malts, some coffee, spices, a touch of sweetness, mild hints of pumpkin, very easy drinking for the abv. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a fine beer."
"- Overall a nice drinking porter which hides the 8.2% very well. Can calls this a lager, which I guess just means cold fermentation, but that aspect was confusing. Good value at $2.50/can."
""
"TASTE: Roasted grain, very warming alcohol, perfume flair, cedar, caraway seed, mild cinnamon, burnt currants, pumpkin?, long roasty finish, semi-dry, lingering roastiness and spice"
""
""
""
"O - An excellent brew. I have never had a pumpkin spice porter. Seems natural, since the pumpkin spiced latte is all the rage right now. This is better!"
""
""
"Poured from the can, it has a dark, rich black color body with a small tan head. The smell has a rich malt and cinnamon smell to it. The taste has a deep sweetness to it with the spices coming through, I get a little pumpkin flavor as it warms up. Moutjfeel is great and overall a really good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark brown with mahogany highlights at the edges. A fine two finger very light tan head that dissipates to a persistant thick film with lots of lacing. Aroma of distinct cinnamon, roasted malt, clove and pumpkin, appealing. Flavor is mellow, sweet toasted malt, pumpkin and well handled light pumpkin pie spicing. Medium bodied with pleasant creaminess. A very nicely balanced pumpkin porter. I'm not detecting the Baltic portion of the porter because of the other flavors, but that is hardly a detraction because everything is very nicely balanced and tasty. Very nicely done. Both of these He Said ales were excellent. I hope these are an annual event."
""
""
""
"Overall: I was thinking I was going to like the tripel better, but I actually found this to be the better of the two beers. This is not as pumpkin forward as some other pumpkin beers I have had, but the base Baltic porter is really tasty. I would get this again."
""
""
""
"A very good porter, mild hints of the pumpkin, but wish there was a bit more of it. That aside, it's quite enjoyable and worth trying."
"If I read the label better and saw the word pumpkin, I never would of bought the He Said four pack. Turns out to be a better than average beer that is just too heavy handed with the spice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Worth a try. Quality beer in a can = good stuff"
""

"More traditional flavors with finishing layers of complexity. A standardly dry porter with great chew, oatmeal bitterness, well-done roast, dry cocoa notes, and a lingering sustain of pumpkin pie spices. A little minerally with low PH levels. Relaxed body with palming weight, but not tension. Gives up slowly, but surely, in the mouth with a pleasant release of gases. The body of the beer is exceptional and really plants on the taste receptors. Spices are overmatched with a great malt base. Aged hops bring forth some young pine and a twist of orange peel. Faint 'squashy' taste that I like. An exceptional porter of the Baltic style with a seasonal American twist. A fine drink for the onset of colder weather. Could be enjoyed late into the throes of winter."
""
"The first whiff I got of this beer was quite promising, in a baltic porter kind of way. But it ends up being a wad of spices in a more pumpkin beer interpretation. Too much clutter really. Could stand a lot sharper of a definition. Nice enough to drink, I guess. But I just don't dig the spice clogged beers. Not my preference of style for a beer, but it works."
""
""
"This beer is great for a pumpkin beer, note that it's also my fort of this season. I grew to loathe the style, but this I a nice different take on it. A perfect balance between sweet and roasted flavors, it's something I'd consider picking up again. I'm gonna let the ther can age for a bit and hope that there's less of the spice so I can enjoy the base beer for what it is."
"A beer that almost demands staunch apologists -- defensible but unremarkable, curious but still blatantly attuned to the public consciousness -- and as such, something that might very possibly become remembered for being better than it was. What I'm saying is, if one felt compelled to compare it to a firm point in the Sam Raimi filmography, the logical conclusion would, overwhelmingly, be Darkman."
""
"Aside from the herbal character, I found this beer to be a nice take on pumpkin beer. Fun one that I would like to drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown with some light passing through the edges. Thinning tan head. Nice aroma with a bit going on: milk chocolate, nutmeg, touch of smoke. Am I actually smelling pumpkin, our is that just malt sweetness? Taste is more intense than expected with plenty of bitterness throughout. Chocolate becomes darker in the flavor, and anise pops up. Pumpkin is subtle on the tongue initially and in the finish, and I prefer not being knocked over the head with it. Sweet cinnamon, mmm. Just enough to leo you drinking this heart brew. A nice one to run into--try it."
""
""
""
""
"It's a bit rough around the edges. Spice runs a bit too high and the malts help when cold, but warming makes it a bit more jarring."
""
"12oz can from""Lifesource"" in Salem OR $2.59 Poured into my snifter this is a black black beer with a very large frothy and creamy tan head. Attractive. Nice creamy sugar cookie aromas,dark berries and slight alcohol. Nice Taste is the same as the aroma but with pumpkin showing..salty pumpkin with some cinnamon. Nice mouth feel smooth and silky. I like Baltic Porters and this is OK..sadly would have been better without the pumpkin IMO"
""
" The taste has a roasted grain flavor with subtle dark fruit and moderate amount of spice with a generally cinnamon dominant warming flavor with some nutty vegetal taste and mild light yeast fruitiness in the finish. Overall this is interesting and worth trying...I like the concept more than the actual beer but if you like spiced beers or strong porters it is more enjoyable than most."
""
""
"I like this. It's a very nice beer from 21st Amendment and Elysian. They deliver with a perfect balance between chocolate and pumpkin spices. Recommended."
""
""
"Overall it's not terrible but again nothing worth getting again. An interesting take on a pumpkin beer but it seems every time I try a dark pumpkin beer I am disappointed."
""
""
"3.5 across the board."
"Very nice and complex, and a very enjoyable pumpkin brew that begs for another sip. Reminds me of Monk's Blood - not a bad thing at all. A fall keeper."
"Wow. This beer was amazing. I had it on tap for the first time and was blown away. The pumpkin spice and the porter richness mix perfectly together. This beer is sold in 4 packs of cans. Two cans are this beer and the other two are a Belgium style ale with pumpkin spice. Both are phenomenal and if you are into pumpkin beers, you must try these."
"The feel is even and smooth in a medium body but a little leaner on the tongue than I had expected. It has a light crispness to it as well."

"I had this at 101 Beer Kitchen. This is an excellent blend of the slightly sweet pumpkin and rich, silky porter. The only thing that keeps me from giving it a higher score is the slightly bitter finish. This is however one of the best pumpkin beers I've had."
"D - This one is certainly more Baltic Porter than Pumpkin Ale... Similar to it's Tripel counterpart the pumpkin plays a subdued second back seat... This is still a respectable, but unremarkable offering... There's nothing wrong with it by any means, but it certainly isn't an autumnal seasonal that I need to seek out each year..."
"O/D-Pretty decent. Not sure how enamored I am with the combo of porter and pumpkin here."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The pumpkin pie flavors are not quite as well integrated into this beer as the He Said Tripel. However, this is a really delicious porter and I love the way the cinnamon and vanilla flavors blend with more traditional porter characteristics."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice mix of flavors, enough to keep things interesting. With this coming in a 4 pack and 2 of each style in the 4 pack, I'd easily grab one or 2 four packs a year around fall."
"Serving type: Bottle 12 oz"
"12 oz. can, poured into a pint glass."
""
"Had to go back and bump this rating up, this is one of the best pumpkin beer I have ever had. Period"
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce can, canned on 09/09/13. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a couple inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like chocolate, cinnamon, pumpkin spices, dark bread and caraway. It tastes like cinnamon, caraway, chocolate, pumpkin, nutmeg, roasted malt and a bit of licorice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. I liked this brew, definitely worth a try. $8.99 a 4-pack (2 cans of the He Said Baltic Porter, 2 cans of the He Said Tripel)."
""
""
"OV: Mediocre effort far as I'm concerned. The look and nose were solid so I've no idea where they went wrong with this. Body and flavours were just too watery for me and really let me down here. Their He Said Tripel was very good, so I don't understand how they got this one wrong. I think they should scrap this one and just brew more of the Tripel."
""
""
""
""
"O.A. definitely like the Baltic porter much more than the tripel in this four pack but like I said, I love the idea of two completely different beers in a single four pack, its like a mini sampler! love it!"
