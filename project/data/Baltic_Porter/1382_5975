Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toast, raisin, plum, dark bread, brown sugar, light chocolate/roast, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/bready malt and yeast ester fruitiness; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, raisin, plum, dark bread, brown sugar, light chocolate/roast, and yeast earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, raisin, plum, dark bread, brown sugar, light chocolate/roast, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice robustness and solid complexity of dark/bready malt and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice Baltic porter style. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 12, 2014"

Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is of roasted malts and brown sugar. Very nice! The taste ia about the same with a hint of dark fruits coming through at the end along with the brown sugar. A really tasty brew with no bitter or harsh aftertaste at all with perfect carbonation for this type of brew style. Never had a Baltic Porter let alone from Latvia.","BeerWithMike","Jan 12, 2014"

By then, the beer was completely flat and slightly warmer. No noticeable nose change, but the taste was radically altered. It showed more licorice-like sweetness and the initial acidity was completely replaced with dark-fruit flavor (stronger cherry notes). If it weren't for the body, the taste almost approached that of a good coffee stout. It's no Bourbon County, but still more interesting than expected.","VictorWisc","May 07, 2013"

The retention of the cap and then the collar was good and it left lacing in sliding curtains. The aroma was of roasted malt, booze, light hops and whole wheat bread. The flavors were good, starting with a sweet note of caramel and toffee but augmented by the darker elements of bittersweet chocolate, molasses, coffee, rye bread and a hint of hops. The mouthfeel was average, the body full and the carbonation appropriate. An inexpensive, tasty offering from far-flung Latvia.

The flavors are good: the licorice comes through nicely as does the spice and some cola taste. A little thick going down and syrupy on the finish, but otherwise quite good.

3.84,4.1,3,4,4,4,3.5,"As a fan of porters, I snagged a bottle of this on my last trip to my favorite local store. The pour from the pint+ (16.9 oz.) bottle produced a strong and persistent light tan head. Dark, almost black pour with gold (as opposed to red) highlights. The smell and taste reminded me more of stout than porter, with significant roasted barley in both the nose and the mouth. I did not find this to be an unpleasant porter, but it is definitely toward the darker, more roasted barley end of the spectrum and not a lot of pleasurable malty sweetness. The bite of the roasted flavors is quite persistent, lingering on the tongue long after the swallow. Flavor notes include raisins, currants, brown sugar, and a hint of coffee. Mouthfeel is, I would say, average for porters - substantial but perhaps a bit less substantial than the taste would suggest. Not watery, but not as fully satisfying as the best baltic porters (for example, I prefer Southhampton's offering over this Aldaris, even though I gave them both a ""B").

Smooth and creamy, buttery, is how I'd describe the medium-body's texture. Caramel and cocoa make it a sweet beer, really sweet at some points, and there are fruit flavors as well thanks to minor hopiness (for some reason I picked up this weird cherry vanilla taste and some butterscotch and maple syrup).

Any less hops and I couldn't go any further, which is to say that I can't detect any hops except to know that it would be a heck of a lot sweeter without them.

Very light dark grain character (dry cocoa, burnt) that grows as it warms. Well-integrated, lowish carbonation with a refined, creamy texture. A little fuller than medium bodied, but still with a bit of dryness in the finish. Faint alcohol warmth. This isn't bad at all.

Pleasant malty aroma, karob and cocoa influenced. Thick and very lowly carbonated, caramel and chocolate flavors but with a sense of peach brandy flavor and some alcoholic tones. Little hoppiness and lots of coating aftertaste. Some hard roasted bite, but in the long run, not nearly enough. A little thick and sweet overall, an OK drink. Looks like one of my stores is promising more brews from this area of the world in the near future...","ADR","Jul 05, 2003"
3.6,-2.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,"When poured into my glass, this beer poured a medium tan head of fine-small sized bubbles. The lacing was next to nothing on the sides of my glass. The hue of this beer was brown. The aroma was that of licorice and chocolate. This porter had a smooth and sweet taste to it and not a bad porter in my opinion.","hotstuff","Jun 29, 2003"
4.3,16.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,"It's basically fermented chocolate malt combined with fresh ground roasted coffee. I can really taste the chocolate and the coffee brings an intensity I rarely taste in a beer. Porteris also has a creaminess to it that complements the chocolate/coffee mixture very well. This was a very, very filling beer and one that I could not drink all night with. Personally this is a great beer to have right before I go to bed.","granger10","Jun 06, 2003"
4.04,9.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,3.5,"This beer had a lovely dark complexion with a tinge of red, so it wasn't opague. It had a wonderful roasty sort of aroma. This and the slightly bitter taste are from the use of chocolate malt. Very silky mouthfeel coupled with a blend of caramel and bitter chocolate flavors on the palate. Another tasty porter from the baltic region.","andyj","May 03, 2003"
3.8,3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized light brown bubbles and a semi-opaque dark brown slightly carbonated body. It has a very nice strong malt aroma and a smooth slightly alcoholic flavor with notes of coffee and roasted caramel. A very nice smooth Baltic Porter. Not as good as the Sinebrychoff but still very nice. This is a good tasting bre that I would try again and again.","TheDM","Apr 20, 2003"

4.23,14.6,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A clear, deep ruby stained mahogany body is capped by a creamy lid of light tan foam. It's retention is good, and it maintains a thin surface covering throughout the first half of the glass. Some limited spotty lace also adds to the appearance. The nose is pleasantly sweet with notes of toffee and raisins. The body is firm and the carbonation is very fine and soft; leaving it quite silky in the mouth with an almost liqueur-like feel that's probably due in part to it's 6.8% alcohol by volume. The flavor is richly malty, and tempered with a clear note of alcohol that helps to thin it and leaves a mild pepperiness in the finish. It's fruity (raisin, fig) although it's probably a lager; and delivers a solid note of burnt brown sugar. It's not roasty, nor is it chocolatey - but it's quite caramelish and toffee-like. It finishes with a lingering note of dark sugar and some peppery alcohol. Quite interesting; highly enjoyable; and with a good level of drinkability even at 6.8%! Certainly worth trying.","NeroFiddled","0"
3.6,-2.4,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Dark ruby colour. Good light tan head. Interesting vinous aroma of raisins, blackberries, ensilage, seaweed and some coffee. Full, rich and smooth flavour - but unfortunately too sweet. Like a good cup of coffee with too much sugar. Syrup battles with a nice roastiness in the aftertaste. Still, an interesting Latvian aquaintance - well worth sampling.","Sigmund","Feb 24, 2003"

4.25,15.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Body is a deep, dark reddish brown with no carbonation visible.  The brownish head is initially thick and creamy, but fades rather quckly to a nice bubbly lace.  Nice sweet roasted malt aroma with hints of fruit - plums perhaps?  Flavor is smooth, with roasted malt, hints of chocolate, and a nice bitterness that is most prominent in the finish.  Very creamy and smooth mouthfeel, and a damn good brew all around.","Viking","Beers"
4.53,22.8,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Complex and very tasty with a nice warming after glow. Aldaris Porteris from Riga Latvia is among one of the better porters, flavorful and will not disappoint.","BeerBob","0"
