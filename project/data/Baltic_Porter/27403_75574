The nose is disappointingly weak but gives some pleasant sweetness, a little doughy. Very good flavor. This is definitely a sweet stout, with little to no roast. Good black patent malt flavor dominates. Bitterness is pretty low, giving the malt overtime to deliver a lingering thick bready taste.

Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing only minimal light penetration at the edges. Nose had a roastiness underlain by a light chocolatiness. I just had chocolate chip oatmeal for breakfast this morning and I am beginning what has happened to me as a self-avowed hophead. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was VERY roasty, initially, giving 'way to a pleasant smoky chocolatiness. My my. I just looked at the style - a Baltic Porter! The site's descriptor for the style mentions ""bitter"" and ""acidic", both of which I experienced, especially on the finish. It was much akin to a cup of coffee. Wow! Good stuff.

Taste is much the same with malt, oat, and cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

Traditional nutty malt flavors, with a touch of caramel, immediately followed by rich roasted coffee and some creamy sweetness.

In fact, I think that's the best comparison for this beer. It's the Pecan Porter of Deep Ellum, but it's different on the dryness and sharpness. I'd usually prefer the Pecan Porter, but I wouldn't be sad to see this on my glass. Solid, but not great.","UTCengOwl","Dec 18, 2011"

4.2,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"On tap at The Common Table. The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is great, with a ton of chocolate up front and a little bit of roasted malt also mixed in. Definitely the aroma of a big, flavorful beer. The flavor doesn’t disappoint. I get a lot of roasted malt and chocolate notes, as well as some oaked notes and some lactose. The beer is very creamy and all of the aroma and flavor notes seem to go very well together. Medium to thick, creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","0"
