"Having allowed the finely corked bottle to sit for about 20 minutes, it began with a quick rush and slowly settled into a dark ruby body capped with a heavy foam crown. There is a nose heavy on spice and wood. The palate receives an intense miasma of black cherry, malt and nut, supplemented by a boozy finish that suggests a tanic red wine. The balance could be better and the mouthfeel more weighty. Add a plate of Irish cheddar and ..... yes! All in all, a nice quaff to while away a snowy March afternoon."
"Bottle poured dark brown with thin head and small bubbles. A floral aroma with vanilla and coconut. Flavors were coconut, hazelnut, onion, and caramel. Did not get the barrel or wine flavors that others are noting. Maybe need a second try as I was 10 beers into a tasting. Mouthfeel was nice with light body and a dry finish."
""
"This is a decent beer, but really not as good as I was hoping for.  I thought the wine barrel aging was good, but not as forward as it could be.  I think my real issue is that the base Baltic porter just is not that great."
""
""
"Wow, a lot of red wine flavor.  I enjoyed it but can only have this in moderation."
""
"Oak, red wine, cocoa, very light roast, tannin"
""
""
"I was sent this as an extra, even though I can go buy it at my local bottle shop tomorrow if I wanted. Went in with low expectations and the beer didn't change my mind."

"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/8/2013. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, brown bread, tannic red wine, oak, raisin, plum, fig, vanilla, light char, and roast/oaky earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malt, wine barrel, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, brown bread, tannic red wine, oak, raisin, plum, fig, vanilla, light char, and roast/oaky earthiness. Slight roast/oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, brown bread, red wine, oak, raisin, plum, fig, vanilla, light char, and roast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of roast/bready malt, wine barrel, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wine barrel aged Baltic porter. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt, wine barrel, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."
"3.75 D:  Seems like everything gets better when Victory puts their beers into barrels.  Pick this one up, it's good."

"Overall: Why haven't I bought this brew before now? This brew is very intriguing and simply put, Delcious. This was 2013's vintage I'm going to have to see how this year's holds up. The vinegar tartness is a refreshing factor to this brew, IMO. It adds a depth that makes this malt beer not too cloying nor syrupy on the tastebuds. Back to basics,  this brew is Recommended!"

"OVERALL: Another Solid Effort by Victory Brewery...Well Made but.....Not My Type of Porter"

"Aug '13 bottling. Pours a brown tinted clear dark red with thick fluffy light brown head. Thick sheet for a few inches. Smell: ripe plum, grapeskin... oaky red wine, tart peach, dark chocolate, light roast. Taste: mildly tart peach, mild tannic bitterness, chocolate brownie batter... moving into the finish some toasted brown bread and plum. The wine barrel certainly adds a lot with the tart stone fruit and oaky vinous notes cutting through the chocolaty sweetness. This is well done."
"Split a bottle with my beer guru, could not remember where I had picked it up. Outstanding appearance, very interesting to the nose, kinda of a mix of the porter with the wine which is very interesting. Very good taste, the same mix of porter with the wine sweetness and chocolate, plus there is not bitter aftertaste. Plus bonus points overall for the drinkability with the ABV. Surprisingly tasty, Victory has done it for me again, hope to buy more of this little surprise."

"Victory Red Thunder ---4/5."
""
""
"I am a fan of this style. This approach is different- I prefer Baltic Porters aged in Bourbon Barrels such as the Framinghammer from Jack's Abby. However, this beer is worth checking out- especially for a different approach to the style."
""
"Interesting beer. To some it might be a case of even if you can barrel-age something it doesn't mean that you should. Has the Baltic porter twang to it. And with the combo of the barrel aging, an even higher level of it than is typical. Woody fruit thing going on. Smooth feel. Easy to drink. There are aspects of this beer that I think are interesting. But I'm not sure if Baltic Thunder is the best beer to be aging."
""
""
"Very unique beer. Poured into pint glass. Dark black color with medium thick head. Smells like a porter and taste like Porter mixed with a sweet red wine. Not a bad combination Easy drinkability. Overall an above average beer. Worth trying for both Porter and sweet red wine fans"
""
""
""

"Pours a very dark brown with some deep amber highlights. The head's a solid, dark tan that fades quickly. Ripe fruit, very subtle, and some hints of chocolate and smoke on the nose. The initial taste is more intense ripe fruit: cherries, plums, especially; some vanilla and chocolate. And then it tastes like sweet vermouth and the heeltap of a Manhattan. If you like that, well, this one's a winner. I do like it, but in small quantities, so a whole bottle may be best divided amongst like minded friends. The feel is perfect - they really have the carbonation just right. It's not sticky, not too watery, either."

"Mouthfeel is good. Medium bodied, medium carbonation and some bitterness from the charred malt are all balanced nicely."

"Bought 2 corked & caged bottles from Victory 's retail shop at the brewpub. Roughly $10 a piece. Poured into a snifter for review. Light pop of the cork. Bottled on date reads August 06, 2013. Pours a very dark garnet red, almost brown in complexion. Nice foamy head after a generous pour. Smells of dark malts with very noticeable tannin character from the wood. Red wine is there - very subtle but appears more as it warms. Seems like a complex nose of chocolate malt, red wine,and wood. Tastes of dark malts with oaky tannins and a very light red wine presence. Slight burn in the back of the throat from alcohol. Feels medium full with nice carbonation and an even bitterness. Overall, a nicely subtle foray into a used red wine barrel program. Red wine isnn't in your face, and that's fine. This one seems to be about more quieter complexities rather than a tongue punch full of flavors. Will be curious what another few years do to the other bottle. Will likely save for another 2-3 years."
""
"Overall – Fantastic!! I quite liked Baltic Thunder by Victory, and after the aging in the wine barrels, it only gets better. The combination of the big robust porter flavors with that of a subtle but pleasant red wine flavor really creates a wonderfully tasty and enjoyable drink."

"750ml bottle: This one pours a fairly opaque, dark mahogany brown color. There was just a wisp of head on it. It has a nice nose. I definitely can smell a bit of oak and red wine. I get some cocoa too, as well as some faint roasted malts. The taste is very good. Just a bit bitter. Taste is some cocoa, roasted malts and a bit of a dry red wine. A touch of the oakiness comes thru too. This is a very nice brew."
""
""
""
"O: A really nice offering and a nice change in the barrel aged department."
"Dark brown porter with a nice off-white head. Smells oaky, and gives off hints of the wine whose barrels it’s been aged in. Oak is the strongest flavor I could detect. The fruits of the wine were more subtle for me. This is a very smooth, very tasty beer."
""
"The taste had a little more smokiness, but otherwise followed the nose. There was a little bite of alcohol in there as well. The taste also included a molasses sweetness and a hint if the wine. The ending was a little dry completing the barrel-aged feel."
""
""
""
""
"Not what I’ve come to expect from Victory: a blatant attempt to cash in on the popularity of barrel ageing. A shame this is not half as good as unbarreled Baltic Thunder. Perhaps a bad bottle? Then so were the first two. Drain pour time."

"This is unique and interesting. Though nothing really jumps out as being exceptional. The tart fruit/wine character with the roasted malt are balanced, just not something I particularly think is a good combo. Worth a try, but probably a one time purchase for me."
""
"This almost seems like a wine without the alcohol & acetic bite to it. A gentle beer that seems to spit in the face of the over-the-top crowd, this grew on me as my expectations took a break. Enjoyable, & a good beer."
""
" Smooth and perfectly composed, this beer is light on the palate and rich and very debonair. Wonderful balance."
"Overall: an interesting beer. ends up being quite tasty and complex."
""
""
"O- Victory is still keeping my interest, and this beer is wonderful. From the deep oak aromas to the full body taste, they have put out a damn good drink with this one. I plan on going and getting a few more for my shelf and would suggest you do the same lol."
""
"Overall: An okay brew. I was certainly hoping for something more complex here. Really surprised at how much the wine characteristics take over. Not bad for the price though, a solid brew from Victory."
""
""
""
""
"This is not a robust porter, but the sweetness balances well with the medium amount of wine barrel character."
""
"Pours Really dark red. Light malt bread nose. Sweet caramel taste. Sweet trumps the bitter, which backs the flavor, but not enough. Could use more bite. Light carbonation mouthfeel. Good but not outstanding. 35 325 35 3 325"

"A big bodied sipper that goes down fairly smooth and viscous. The perfect start to a snow day."
"The feel is a bit astringent and though I didn't detect any hop flavors or aromas I did get some of the tinny metallic hop sensation. There was also a light warmth and a tinge of fizzy soda."

"O: A creamy beer with moderate cocoa flavor and an unmistakable red wine oak character supporting the porter with notes of currants, cherry, oak and cinnamon. I was really impressed with this on tap, it hold up well in the bottle but well worth finding on tap."
""
"Mouthfeel (4/5): Full-bodied, medium carbonation, and creamy. A beer that, despite its richness and complexity, is easy drinking. I could probably drink a full 750 mL bottle of this."
"Mediocre head of about half a finger, lots of larger bubbles which diminish its staying power and it’s all quickly gone, lacing likewise on the weak side. Clean black liquid of full opacity, no real orange or yellow tints, just some brown around the edges, no real way to visually gauge the carbonation. Malty nose with cocoa, mocha, coconut, butterscotch and vanilla bean, maybe a hint of sour red wine but no real “vinous” presence, at the same time no real hoppy bite either, dries out the longer it lingers in the nostrils, seems like a straight up porter. Medium-bodied, slightly creamy during the attack then gets quite dry and close to dusty in texture. Chocolate, vanilla, caramel, a light dose of black licorice and coconut as well as scone bread. The carbonation is weak and it moves at a sluggish pace. Glimmer of cherry to plum fruit, not a lot of lactose or milky qualities. While it’s posture is nice, still wish it moved more gracefully. Still not sure what the wine barrels contribute, except some sour notes through the finish. By no means a bad beer, just unsure of what makes it “unusual” versus a basic rendition of a traditional style."
"O: I like how the barrel flavors and base beer worked together on this one. May buy another to cellar to see where this one goes over time."
""
""
""
""

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good variation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while."

"Overall: I'm not sure who's idea was it to take a porter yet alone a Baltic porter and age it in wine barrels but I think Victory has themselves a hit. It's not for everyone, but most porter fans would like. Salud!"
""
""
"D= Drinkability bolstered by the very pleasant flavor profile. That almost makes me forget about the thin and disappointing mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a really tasty beer. The wine barrel flavor is excellent and not too overpowering. Nice complexity and hints of fruit and wine, but not enough to take away from the flavor a Baltic Porter should have. Well balanced all around. I'm usually not a big Victory fan, but they made a great beer in this case."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I've never head a wine barrel-aged porter before, but this was a solid beer. I doubt many other examples of this aged Baltic porter exist, but I'd be happy to try others to compare. Cheers to the folks at Victory for experimenting."
"High B-"
""
""
"O--Tremendous. Another home run for Victory. If it wasn't 8.5%, I'd drink this all day/night long."
""
"Overall- Was more impressed with this than I thought I would be. The original is great in its own right, and the wine/wood blends nicley into it. Initially reading the description I was worried it would be a mess but its def worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a mahogany brown with a small tan head. Smell red wine, chocolate with a little tart cherry and coffee. Taste is red wine, chocolate and oak. Medium body with decent amount of carbonation and a little dry. Overall it is an interesting take on a porter, worth a try a least once."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"I thought this was an interesting combination of a porter and wine. It worked well for me, and I will buy this again."
""
""
""
""
"O: A disappointing beer. I've had worse, but I expected more from this one."
"O: I was expecting either the wine to wash out the porter or the porter to wash out the wine, but this is well-executed and relatively balanced. Quite enjoyable."

"Poured from a bottle into a snifter, the beer is a dark brown-to-black coloring, with a thin, filmy, light brown colored ring on the surface. Aromas of bittersweet chocolate and bitter coffee in the backbone, with heavy merlot and cab wine characteristics all over the place. Very rich and layered, with a decent balance. Flavors are wine-like as well, with a dry, red wine forward flavor on a bitter, roasted coffee backbone. Subtle bittersweet baker's chocolate character builds towards the end of the palate. The body is light, but robust and slick. Chocolate and wine blend in the aftertaste once again, with a dry, red wine linger into a slick, dry, lingering finish. Tasty beer, with robust flavors and a slightly increased ABV that make it a sipper."
""
""
"D - Having never had regular old Baltic Thunder, I wasn't quite sure what to expect... The red wine components dominate in all facets, but they never overpower... Interesting enough and pleasant enough, but not stellar... A very good beer that wine lovers would likely enjoy..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 12 oz glass. Pours black with a reddish tint with a small head. Smells of coffe and mulled wine. Tastes of chocolate coffee with a nice merlot after tone. Beer is full bodied and is a sipper but to be expected. Overall a very good beer."
"Overall I'd love to get another bottle of this beer. Great complexity and complimentary flavors going on here. Starts off as one beer and finishes as quite another. Pick one up."
""
""
""
"O: An already great beer made even better by wine barrels. The wine characteristics very nicely and provide quite a bit of complexity towards the back end. Good price point at under $9 for a 750 mL C&C bottle. Definitely recommended along with the original"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was expecting a bit more, frankly, though I never thought the base beer was a top flight Baltic Porter, either; the wine barrel tends to clash rather than complement; wine barrel aging is a tricky thing and I have tasted some hits and some misses; this one is OK but a bit of a miss"

"O - This was a bit strange and also a bit of a let down. Initially it smells and tastes likes a sour - or heading that direction. But in an instant I felt fooled. What you may think is about to be sour cherry is actually dry red wine which turns to mild sweetness as the chocolate and carmel flavors come through. Mouth is avg at best being too watery but the 8.5 ABV is hidden quite well and is very easy to drink."
""
"D: This was a really interesting and well done beer. I was skeptical of a red wine barrel porter, but somehow the scents and flavors ended up bring complimentary. The result was complex and bold and tasty. The body was decent but not great. It had a reasonably smooth finish, and well hidden alcohol, so it was pretty easy to drink. Not sure how it would age, but I really liked it fresh."
"O: Really enjoyable and wish I had bought more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The red wine barrel aging completely changed the dynamics of this beer so it no longer tastes like a Baltic Porter, but like more like an oak aged ale with some red wine flavors. The beer is quite drinkable and hides its alcohol very well."
"O: One would have to have a microscope to detect any Baltic Porter characteristics here, but that doesn't mean it's bad."
"O - Overall good beer. Couldn't have multiples, not that drinkable. Leaves me very intrigued and wanting to try more beer/wine collabs."
"Pours a murky and dark brown with some red highlights, plume of dense tan head, gone quickly. Scent is big on the red wine character - vinous and oaky. Base beer is underlying with notes of brown sugar, chocolate, fruit, spice, alcohol. Taste again bold with the red wine notes, base beer hidden a bit underneath and that is tough to do with such a bold base. Felt a bit thinner than expected, moderate carbonation and dry. Solid beer, but heavy on the wine which clouds up a very good base beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bomber into a snifter, reddish brown pour, creamy white head. Tannic notes, oak notes, on the nose. The flavors of red wine and oak are overlaid with chocolate malts, slight acidic taste. The beer is creamy, full bodied, no discernable ABV. Decent beer, actually enjoy the base beer more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tart and tannic, plenty of dry oak barrel character, some vinous berry and leather, red wine and roast malt are seamlessly blended. Super dry tannic aftertaste with a hint of grape. Medium bodied, supple carbonation. A nice wild sipper."
""
""
""
"O: Overall a good complexity with a silky smooth tartness that is gentle, A good easy blend that works smoothly together and doesnt seem forced."
"O - I enjoyed this brew but wasn't blown away. Something a bit different for sure, which is always nice. I'd have it again."
""
""
""
"Full Review here.... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfsXFnzKTto"
""
""
""
"Overall at times it does seem too wine like but its fairly balanced and easy enough to finish the bomber. The best wine influenced beer I ever had."
""
"Full bodied with a moderate barrel presence that's nicely integrated into the base adding another dimension to the intense smokiness.  Dry, toasted oak with vinous red wine notes countered by smoked/burnt malt, toast, charcoal and dark chocolate.  Sweet up front from the barrel presence followed by smoke and roasted malt before finishing dry.  Decent job barrel aging this beer but the wine and barrel notes take away from the smokiness that I like so much in the base beer."
""
"O- Interesting combination of flavors that work to a certain extent. I would like a little more from the barrel, but with a big roasty porter, it can be difficult. Worth a try."
""
"8.1/10"
""
"O: I really enjoy beer thrown into wine barrels, and I'm eager to try more dark and heavy beers from either red or white oak barrels. I think a beer like consecration has flavors that blend together better which make for a better beer. Even so, Victory did a solid job on what they set out to do and for the price, this is awesome. I recommend this one."
"M: creamy and highly drinkable for ABV"

"O: This was a strange beer that I'm still not sure how I feel about. Perhaps with more time this will turn into something great, but for now it was just...interesting. The flavors need to play together better. 4"
"A fine take on a red wine barrel aged porter. The flavors are very complementary and layered in complexity. A little too subtle to warrant a higher score, but this is pretty delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am glad I finally found this beer. I really like the combination of the porter and red wine, I think it really brings out some interesting flavors in the beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"To me while this beer drinks smooth and easy it lacks in flavor. One can hardly notice any beer at all. I would thick that Baltic porter was aged in wine barrels to give the beer sutle hints of wine and oak perhaps leaning towards a port. Not the case here, and since I can't find any info on the website maybe they know it too."
""
""
"O- I really like this beer. I wasn't able to get any of the Dark Intrigue release last year and was happy to hear that Victory and produced a lot more of this so it would be out in a larger distribution for a longer period of time. I really like the red wine flavors matched with the porter, it's awesome to see Victory trying more with barrel aging."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Interesting stuff. The red wine characteristics were much more prominent than I was expecting and added some additional complexity. I really would liked to have seen more of the base beer shine through, but this was still a solid brew. Glad I picked this one up, and I wouldn't be opposed to revisiting it in the future."
"I so thoroughly enjoy the base that a wine-barreled version piqued my interest greatly. Expectations were high. It pours a deep garnet topped by a finger of dusty tan foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, brown sugar, lightly-vinegar-y red wine, and light cedar. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some dark chocolate and some extra red wine for the sake of it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this turned out to be pretty tasty, though it falls quite short of the base, if you ask me. It's thinner and not quite as robust as the base would lead you think it'd be. Still, fairly good times here."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer as it is very drinkable due to the lesser ABV (compared to most American barrel aged beers these days). The red wine flavors should have been bumped up to really make this special but it was still above average how it currently is."
"I was a little hesitant to buy a bottle of this. Thankfully, it worked out in my favor. The wine barrels don't come across as being over the top and a Baltic Porter seems like a decent style to wine barrel; several I've tried had dark fruit notions as they were."
""
"This is a light bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is easy drinking and crisp in the feel. Overall not bad, the barrel presence really took hold in this brew and it is nice. Nothing ground breaking here but worth a try. It is a pleasant offering and at a very reasonable price point."
"D - Good to try. Not a favorite."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark ruby color. Surprising with the base Baltic porter... Nonetheless, there's a tan head and it looks nice, though its somewhat perplexing, The aroma makes you thing what the wine barrels have done. Heavy on the vinous notes, some smoke, some work, some sweet grape. Tastes smoky, malty, with a boozy wine note, caramel and peated wood. Body is pretty much full, creamy, and a touch coating. It's a good beer. Unique, and perplexing."
""
""
""
"O/D-I borderline loved this. Great hybrid brew. The barrel aging really, really, really morphed this brew into a new species. A 750ml (I think) for $8 is a pretty legit price too. When was the last time you bought a wine-barrel aged brew in this size bottle for well under $10? I am very happy I went after this one. A big time success in my book."
"Overall: this a slow sipping beer that has some nice oak and wine characteristics to it. Definitely worthy of a try."
""
""
"Great beer to start the night with and with my Christmas Eve appetizers"
""
"I love this brew. It's still Baltic Thunder, at heart. Just aged to a near-souring point with some effective cab barrels. Brilliant stuff. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Different and definitely enjoyable. The fruity red wine and dark chocolate flavors are a perfect pairing. The flavors do feel kinda muted, especially compared to the original Baltic Thunder."
""
""
"O- not for everyone, but red thunder is unique with the combinations. Might change a little more over time"
""
"A medium bodied, interesting brew, which deserves respect for the idea! Great job!!"
""
"Pours a clear dark brown color with garnet highlights and a smallish tan head that slowly dissipates to a cap. Aroma's of chocolate and caramel with a hint of earth make up the bulk of the nose. A light vinous, raspberry and strawberry fruitiness is subtle but rounds things out nicely. The flavor is rich with lots of caramel, vanilla, and chocolate with a sweet sugary edge. Light berry tartness as well as faint earthy hops and a vinous quality provide a nice balance against the sweet flavor. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet light sugary mouthfeel. I quite enjoyed this one. The red wine qualities are subtle but provide a nice background note. I should have bought a couple more of these."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really great brew from Victory. Hope they continue to try new, more challenging brews aside from their standard selections."
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a pretty tasty brew where some careful barrel aging was used to really compliment an already excellent base beer. Deffiantly worth trying especially if your already a fan of Baltic thunder."
"Overall - Hey this turned out good, kinda like a beer version of chocovine chocolate wine, but not as strong and wine forward. Its balanced rather well, easy to drink, and quite different then about any other beer you can have. I still enjoy baltic thunder but like this unique offering alot. Id for sure give this a shot if you enjoy red wine, baltic thunder or chocovine wine."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with almost an inch tan head. There's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted malt, dark fruit, chocolate, nuts and oak. It tastes like nuts, roasted and grainy malt, dark fruit/red wine, and some chocolate and oak. It's a mostly sweet tasting brew, but there's some tart fruit noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and creamy with a good amount of carbonation. I like this brew, but I think I like the regular Baltic Thunder more. But this is still worth trying, $7.99 a bottle isn't a bad price for this at all."
"Red Thunder is a very good all around beer. I think the aging in the wine barrels really helped this brew out. I will definitely purchase another bottle or two of these."
"O - It's different but the flavors blend and play well together, 'sort of like having wine and chocolate together. I cellared a second bottle and it will be interesting to see how it evolves and hopefully the oak will diminish some, it's a little too up front right now."
"OVERALL: I've had my share of barrel aged beers, and Red Thunder stacks up decently. Interesting choice with the red wine barrels. The aging in those barrels imparted a tangy wine like note making me wonder if some Brett may have been involved providing residual tartness. Either way its pretty good. Maybe time will mellow it out a bit, still, I wouldn't sit on a bottle of this too long."
""
""
"O- not nearly as wine-heavy as I expected, and the barrel doesn't overshadow the base beer at all like what happens in so many of barrel-aged beers nowadays. Great balance"
"O - This was a release I was excited for since I first heard about it. Victory is one of my favorite brewers and, come on, a porter aged in wine barrel? This beer is a whole dfferent beast than Baltic Thunder. It has adopted many flavors of the barrel, adding fruit and oak to the already roasty porter. I don't know that I will be rushing to the store to stockpile this stuff, but it is interesting and certainly worth trying."

"M: Big medium leading to full. Not too chewy."
"Overall a tasty beverage, although honestly think the wine qualities are a bit overpowering here."

"This one looks like a baltic porter, very dark brown bordering on black with a very minimal amount of off tan foam up top barely forming a cap, no lacing. Swirls bring back something, yet not much. Smell is in between winey and robust I can pick up the red wine easy with a faint tootsie roll scent and roast. A faint yeast scewnt pops out in the end with some small cocco rounding the scent out. Not picking up any alcohol. Taste is nice with a mix of baltic porter roast and wine barrel oak and grape/berry taste. Baltic Thunder is not the thickest BP out there so I can see how so much red wine/oak sprang up. It kind of takes away from the base beer, which I like better on it's own than red thunder. Either way this does not taste off IMO. It sets out what it is supposed to do. Body is a nice medium with low amount of carb, even off the tap, surprisingly, it's not dead though. This is a nice riff on the original baltic porter and I'll be looking for a bottle to drink when it gets real cold out."

"This poured out as a dark brown color with some highlights of red in it. The head was thin and didn't leave much evidence behind on the glass. The smell of the beer gives off a roasted malt aroma which is decent. Nothing too exciting really. The taste of the beer gave off some chocolate like flavors, some roasted malt and a slight bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was thin, not much body as all, the carbonation was fine but not much depth at all. Overall this was a disappointment, I didn't get much of the wine barrel characteristics at all from this beer. This beer seemed entirely different from the original version of Baltic Thunder... I'm not sure if this beer was old or if it was just a flop from Victory but I wasn't much of a fan of this at all."

"Very low carbonation and a creamy feel round off this beer. Overall an interesting tasty drink that hides the abv very well."
