"Overall, this is a great Baltic porter. Very complex but very drinkable. This is a solid beer, and easily the best Baltic porter I’ve had."

"Pours a deep, deep brown, almost black. Has a thin tan head with barely any retention or lacing. The aroma is big roasted malt with hints of coffee, grain, and stronger alcohol notes. Taste-wise it is very similar to the aroma. The body is not overly heavy and has a nice smooth finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability:  Seems to hit the style pretty well.  What it lacks in lacing and mouthfeel it more than makes up for in aroma and taste.  While I enjoyed this, I cannot say I would want more than one an evening.  Still, a solid example of the style and I'm glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
"A little strong for me."
""
"Bitter coffee. Nice rich black color. Toasty flavors."
""
"O: lovely richness and bold approach to the style... but it lacks a bit of depth in flavor/character... this beer may, however, be an excellent candidate for barrel-aging"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a black body with little head and lace.  A sweet aroma of chocolate mixed with roasted malt aromas.  Beer is light to medium bodied, smooth, even a little oaky/woody, more sweet than roasted with a slight overbalance of chocolate (possible vanilla) sugary sweetness over roasted malts.  Nonetheless, well crafted beer that controls itself, has a clean finish that complements rest of beer and the ABV is well-hidden (no idea it was this high)."
""
""
""
"Overall:  Wow!  I like this beer!  I really like the roasted malt and dark chocolate flavors and the smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  Certainly the best beer I’ve had from the Duck-Rabbit."
"Overall; Not bad, but suffers in comparison with some other Baltic Porters that  I've  sampled.  If the taste matched the smell, we'd be talking about a winner.  I'm not sure I would seek it out again with other options available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It pains me to write an unfavorable review, because I normally appreciate Duck Rabbit's offerings.  This just doesn't seem like any Baltic Porter I've ever had... It's nicely colored, but its plum, cherry, and raisin flavors are - to my palate - truly excessive, almost resulting in a cough-syrupy sweetness.  I'll come back to it again in a week to give it another chance, but for now, I think it's a miss."
""
""

"O - I think this would typically be an excellent Baltic Porter, but something made it turn a bit tart."

"Not sure I get this beer. Sharp and prickly sour, which thins it out and gives big thin head. Huge burst of competing sweetness. The added roasty flavors don't help. I tried to let it warm and nothing helped. Couldn't drink more than 2oz. Infected?"

"O - Overall, not bad but isn't really doing it for me. A bit too much sweet, sugary and not enough roastiness. Not that the beer is done poorly, but perhaps, just isn't my thing."
"Poured on-tap at the brewery and served in a nonic pint, the beer is a jet black, slick and oil-like coloring with a halo of light tan head. Nose of rich date, molasses, and bittersweet baker's chocolate. Flavors are rich and roasted, with bitter chocolate and black strap molasses forward, with hints of smoke and charred wood character. Rich and perfectly balanced on a smooth, robust body. The aftertaste is richly sweet, with hints of smoke throughout. Slick finish, with a roasted linger. This is a fantastic beer!"
""
""
"The Rest: Medium bodied, highly drinkable, balanced and well-hidden alcohol make this a great brew."
""
"O: I have chosen wisely for my first Baltic porter. Sweet, smoky, semi bitter and prickly on the tongue. I will have to grab a six of this next time in our. Cheers!"
""
"(O) I would buy this beer over and over again. It is one that is best enjoyed with the company of others. I don't normally rate beers; but this one has me wanting to shout reveries of its awesomeness from a mountain! Please try this beer so that you know im not crazy for my outlandish description."

"It is a great Baltic Porter that fits the mold. Not too boozy, not too sweet."
""
""
""

"O- By far one of the best Baltic Porters I have ever had. Mouthfeel and flavor are the highlights of this beer. Who new a lager could taste so good."

"Really tasty stuff. I love the interplay of roasted malt flavors in the taste. Yummy."

"Appearance is a deep dark brown with a half finger of head that dissipates fairly quickly. Roasted notes are present in the nose. The body is hearty and the roast profile is good for a straight-up porter. That said it is a tad thin for a Baltic. There is a light hint of dark fruit and a mildly roasted finish. Also, the alcohol pokes through on the finish and burns a bit."

"The beer pours a dark tan and creamy head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a dark brown that borders on black and opaque. The beer has a smell that demonstrates its funk but mixes well with the dark chocolate notes that also have some cocoa hints in it. The beer taste resembles the smell but with a stronger funk that mixes well with the cocoa and dark chocolate notes. The funk is a bit tarty and sour that might not appeal to some tastes. The mouthfeel is slick with biting carbonation. Overall, a pretty good Baltic Porter and worth getting again."

"Not terrible. That's really where it stands."

"Thanks to Treyliff for this!"
"Overall – A good sweeter Baltic porter that is nice to sit back with and sip over a nice cool evening. A rather enjoyable brew and one to try if you get the opportunity."

"O: You really feel this Baltic Porter. Not much to look at, but smells and tastes pretty good, and has a smooth, warm, alcoholic feel."

"O: I love this beer. I would say it is one of my top 2 I have tried from Duck Rabbit. It is a hot beer not for the faint of heart... but the complexity of it is fascinating. My only complaint is the alcohol is not well disguised... easier said than done though."
""
""
""
""
""
"An almost perfect beer. Pours deep brown, almost black, with a tan head. Low carbonation and a little lacing. The smell is almost all dark fruit, with a touch of chocolate or something else sweet. Taste is more dark fruit and a richness that doesn't overwhelm. Delicious dark cherry notes. This beer is exactly why I love Duck-Rabbit. Intense flavor in perfect balance."
""
""
""
"Duck Rabbit's Baltic Porter pours solid black, with just a hair over a finger's worth of mocha foam capping the beer. Head retention is alright, and lacing is minimal. The nose features aroma of cocoa powder and black licorice, and while the former is dominant, the latter definitely has its fair say as well. The dark chocolate that leads off the flavor profile is exceedingly smooth, I actually find myself wishing there was just a little bit of a roasty edge to it. The star anise that follows is joined by a light earthy hop presence to form the finish. The body is surprisingly not heavy for a big porter, and that combined with the lack of appreciable alcohol makes this one impressively drinkable. The modest, understated carbonation just completes the picture. Baltic Porter is just another entry in a very solid lineup from Duck Rabbit. Now, if they would just bottle The End of Reason..."
""
""
""
"Overall: A little too one-dimensional on the sweet fruity side; would prefer to see more chocolate and other flavors adding depth and balance"
""
"Growler fill that my neighbor let chill for about 6 weeks. Still lots of action when we cracked it. Very nice deep brown/light black pour with generous 1 +finger mocca head. Smell is a bit tame with some notes of coffee, carmel, roasted malts and some earth tones. Subtle on the nose. Taste was where this brew hooked me. A very balanced porter that hides the 9% quite well. Initial coffee and chocolate that fades to earth and nuts with a hint of hops. Pretty complex and smooth. Comes off a bit more like a stout than porter. Feel was a bit of a letdown. A touch watery and thin. It did have a silk feel on the tongue and perhaps the 6 weeks had something to do with this. Adequate carbonation, but a little light on the feel. Overall- I really enjoyed this beer. Solid blend of malts, coffee, chocolate and earth. Well hidden ABV and tough to set down. A nice sipper for a winter evening. Again, this comes off as a stout to me, but it's a damn good beer and I will be trying one out of the bottle soon-"

"O- This was an okay baltic porter. It reminded me way too much of cherry cough syrup though more then anything which I didn't particularly like. Overall interesting to try, but definitely not my favorite baltic porter and not something that I would go back to right away."
"O - It is a different taste experience from what I initially expected. The tart cherry taste was a nice surprise. You would never know that this is a 9% beer. The alcohol is hidden."
""
"Wow, but the head looks more like a stout! I got a finger-and-a-half of bubbling, deep-tan head with limited retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown allowing ZERO light penetration. Nose had a dried dark-fruit scent, like prunes, raisins, dried blueberries, you get the idea. Mouthfeel was medium and the alcohol heat was the first thing that was evident on the tongue. Getting past that, it was really like a fruitcake with lots of dried fruit flavors like the aforementioned as well as cherries plus a nice maltiness. Finish was literally breathtaking as the alcohol burn really led the way, followed by all of the fruitiness. I would only need one or two of these to get where I am going. Nicely done."
""
""
""
"This one went to the sink. There were some good things up front, but the dark fruit flavor at the back end did not mesh well with the other flavors at all and ruined it for me."
"This was an enjoyable brew. I'll need to try a fresh one for comparison but this drinks like a ""light"" Russian imperial stout. Many of those same dark fruit and cocoa flavors but with a smaller body and still pretty high alcohol. Well done. "
""
"O: Huh, I wonder if I got a bad bottle. Almost no roasted malt, just tart fruits. I'm unsure as I've never had this before. Some of the descriptions list similar aspects though so I really can't discount this. Odd beer and not that tasty."
"Medium full bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth and creamy overall feel. A delicious and nuanced brew with a ton of flavor; one of the very best of the style."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not quite to my taste. It's a little bit different, but it's lacking in the roast department, and the high ABV comes through too much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: big, without being RIS big. and the abv/flavor certainly could play with the RIS's. glad i was able to try this brew from duck rabbit as it can be a little more difficult to find than some of there other offerings."
""
""
"An easy drinking beer, reminiscent of a brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"I want to start and say this is a very good beer from Duck-Rabbit, like most of the other reviews this brew is true to style and all the flavor notes are there. This beer is so well balanced and drinkable than lesser baltic porters, it deserves to be cherished. Saying you're ""The dark beer specialist"" is a bold statement but, they get it right with this one!"
"O: One of Duck-Rabbit's best creations. Very tasty, very likeable."
""
""
""
"Duck Rabbit has themselves a nice example of the style here. The flavor’s solid and the mouthfeel is out of this world. Glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest to light level of carbonation. For a 9% lager, this is fairly well tamed yet has its edges about it that are bold. It is fairly crisp and easily approachable but I dont think I could drink more than a single serving at a time. This is a fairly decent brew that is worth giving a try at least once."
"O: Duck-Rabbit's best offering and just as good on-tap. Strong, slightly boozy, flavorful and a great pint for the winter."
""
""
"O: To be honest, I haven't tried many Baltic Porters in my life that I haven't liked. However, I'd rank this up there with the best of them."
"Cost: $8.99 for a six pack."
"O. Great beer with good complexity and after reading about the style I would say this beer is spot on with the English Baltic Porter recipe. Nice job Duck Rabbit!"
""
""
""
""
"O- I don't know if I got a bad bottle or not, but this one seemed a bit funky. The finish is quite sour, which I wasn't really expecting, and the coffee flavor is a bit overwhelming."
""
"O: well-made beer but unusual deep nutty flavor doesn't fit for me"
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, received in a beer of the month 6 pack from Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, Virginia, into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice black color with a one finger light brown head that dissipates quickly. Smells heavily of dark malt which is quite sweet, but not overly so. Tastes of very dark malt and slight hops, very well balanced. Carbonation is right and goes down extremely smooth. Overall, a very good beer, and one I am surprised about how good it is, as I am normally not a huge fan of porter."
""
""
""
"O: I like this beer. The smokiness works really well. I would certainly order it again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I have always loved this offering from Duck-Rabbit and will continue to. I feel for the style it is truly one of the best. It has a abv content that makes me curious to see what time will do for this one."
""
"Lovely."
""
"O: Overall, very enjoyable. Not terribly complex, but quite taste with good drinkability and deceivingly strong. A good brew for sure."
"Dark and deep with a great balanced flavor and an amazing smell. Great job!"
""
""
""
"Very, very good Porter. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good beer. The flavor is similar to an Irish Dry Stout of sorts. The alcohol takes this one to a new dimension. Overall, it's a sipper but it's enjoyable. I'll take another."
"O: Pretty mild for a 9% ABV Baltic Porter. The flavors mix very well together, though, and there are no negative flavors present. A decent Baltic Porter."
""
"Overall even though the feel on this doesn't seem to match the taste and the smell especially really hits it out of the park. 9% abv barely even hard to taste."
""
"Mouthfeel is very good. It has a good carbonation level and full bodied. Smooth mouthfeel from beginning to end, well maybe slightly clean and dry at the end. The 9% alcohol is not one you'd expect from the mouthfeel either, no hot bite at all, and it's nice and drinkable. You could use this as a sipper, but you certainly don't need to. Great representation of the style. Duck-Rabbit made it worth Drive of about 1,200 miles worth it!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Probably the best Baltic Porter I've had, and darn near the top of my favorite Duck-Rabbit list."
""
"D - It's a spot-on Baltic Porter that's vaguely reminiscent of Flossmoor's Killer Kowalski or Smuttynose's offering in terms of sweetness and flavor profile. Not as smokey or brine-heavy as Scandinavian takes on the style, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I appreciate that this comes in 12oz bottles, as that seems like the appropriate serving size - I think more would become fatiguing and burdensome for one person."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The best Baltic Porter I've had. Big awesome flavors and aromas from this."
""
""
"The mouthfeel was creamy with a mouth filling full carbonation. Classic Baltic Porter."
"Well done well done"
"The 10 - burnt sugar is what I get out of it. All the amazing complexity is gone, leaving a subdued caramel, dry feeling. I prefer fresh."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a beer of this proportion. At 9%, I would have liked something creamier and chewier, but it is not to the point of watery. It could just use a little more body. Overall, this is easily one of the best Baltic Porters that I can get easily. I am really looking forward to drinking more of this."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Baltic porters are becoming a favorite style of mine, and this is one of the reasons. Easy to find locally, fairly complex without being too heavy, great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is a real sipper due to the full and filling body in addition to the high ABV. There are some nice flavors to the beer but it did not have the vinous acidity that I really like in the style. Definitely an enjoyable beer and one that I would gladly have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. I found myself enjoying this one a bit more than I thought I would've. I really liked the big chocolate flavor and how it didn't let the roast or smoke dominate. Wish the feel would've been better, but at least it delivers on flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good. I wouldn't trade for it, but it is a solid beer."
"O: I think this beer is fantastic. I love blatic porters, and this one hits the spot. I would drink this all the time if I could."
"Overall as expected it was a very drinkable Baltic porter with a smooth thick body and moderate sweetness. Could use a bit of age since grain is a bit aggressive but it drinks pretty good fresh."
"This is the second time I've had this one and it tastes about the same as before. I guess I'm not a huge fan."
"This brew pours out as a thick looking black body. The head on top is a brownish tan color with a creamy feel to it. The smell of the beer is a roasted and sweet smelling. The taste of the beer is rich with bitter flavors and and sweet caramel flavors too. The mouthfeel of this is pretty thick, it could pass as a stout, it's creamy and oily feeling with an easy going carbonation. Overall I like this brew, I would buy it again."
"O: Very good beer. Glad I snagged a six pack of this stuff. Even though this is a bit heavy for a normal 12oz, cannot really taste the alcohol in it. Wish this stuff was more obtainable."
"O: This is a good Baltic Porter, but I was expecting a bit more. It's just a little sweet and heavy on the chocolate syrupy flavor. I still like it, but it's not a world beater."
"O: I wasn't expecting this to be so damn good in every sensory aspect. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and would actively seek it out again. This was received as an extra but can't for the life of me remember from who. Thank you to whoever it was. This is excellent! The only thing I'd change is perhaps a bit less dark fruit flavor and a bit more maltiness and roast. Otherwise, excellent! 4.5"
"Overall, I like this beer. It is a roasted wonderland that has good balance and is blossoming as it warms."
"Pours black with about in inch of dark brown head; very appealing. Smells of chocolate, vanilla, coffee, some toasted caramel, and brown sugar. Tastes of sugar, vanilla, caramel, roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. It starts off sweet, but finishes with some of the more “roasty” notes. Mouth is smooth in the beginning, but sugary, sticky, and dry on the finish. Overall, a great porter that I’m glad to have tried. Would happily drink much more of this."
"Pours a gorgeous dark dark brown. Almost black with a nice brown glow around the edges of the glass. Smells chocolatey and roasty. Tons of chocolatey goodness. Tastes dry and chocolate heavy. A solid roastiness with a touch of bitterness. Very enjoyable. Dry but thick and smooth. Good carbonation. Too dry for me but overall very nice"
"O: A very good beer with a great flavor profile. Only thing I would have liked, was for it to be a bit creamier. Easy drinking for the abv as well."
"Rabbit on the label wearing a snow hat. Poured a black color with no head. Smells like soy sauce, raisins and chocolate with alcohol. Taste is a bombardment of chocolate malt and alcohol. This is sweet and salty with low carbonation. Slick and smooth feel. Best beer I have had by them yet."
"The CPJ"
"O - Love, love, love."
"Medium to full bodied with very fine and soft carbonation to contribute to a nicely creamy beer. Alcohol is well hidden behind a huge amount of flavor."
"Also, the heat has died pretty much all the way leaving this open to get mouth raped by me. I will enjoy doing it."
"O - One of the better DR offerings I have had. Good depth of flavour, I would have this again, no question."
"D - I was very surprised at how good this beer was. Really nice sweetness that doesn't get out of control thanks to the burnt malts. Although this is 9% abv, I could drink multiple of these without realizing what hit me. Delicious beer and one I am going to have to seek out again!"
"O- This was a great beer, full on flavor and just the right amount of alcohol. Blew through the first four in the six pack, but saving two for later in the year. Highly recommend it."
"Had this at the ACBF and was lucky enough to get one as an extra from Pittsburghkid66. Excellent beer."
"Overall: Nice smooth beer. The balance was very good and I would have it again."
"D- Drinks similar to an RIS. The smooth creaminess makes it easy to drink. It's warm and delightful. Perfect for a cold, rainy night such as this one."
"This specialty brew is a solid black color, opaque, with a modest light tan head that breaks to a ring with decent lacing. The aroma is a meek but tasteful chocolate charcoal with a nutty undertone. The flavor brings tart brandy malt with charcoal smoke. It mellows nicely with great balance between granny apple and earthy toffee malt. Very nice with medium plus body and a slightly chalky feel with pleasant carbonation. An excellent, unique baltic porter."
"I really enjoyed this a lot. A bit different, but robust and great to drink!"
"Duck Rabbit makes its way to the Knoxville area, I believe. I hope they come to Nashville soon because I will be buying the hell out of their Baltic Porter."
"O: Fantastic brew. Likely among my favorite baltic porters. Wish the carb was just a hare lower."
"Pours a big one and a half finger milk chocolate head with some small bubbles and some big bubbles. I'm surprised at this, but I can hear the head fizzing, not a good sign usually. The head isn't going away super fast, but it's for sure dissipating. The body is absolutely pitch black, no light is getting through, even when held up to the light. Lacing is excellent, it just sticks to the side of the glass. Overall, an ok look, not as good as I was expecting, mainly the head was not as good as I was expecting, but the body looks solid. Nice roasted malt on the nose, chocolate is also present for sure. It smells slightly sweet, slightly bitter, I also detect a small amount of alcohol kick underneath the initial smell. It smells pretty solid, it smells like there may even be some other scents in here that I can't quite identify, so perhaps more complex, either way I can tell it's going to be a quality made and quality tasting beer. Wow the taste was not what I was expecting at all, this tastes like an oatmeal stout to me, oatmeal is very present. It's also very sweet, perhaps a little too sweet, the malts are present, but not as roasty as I was hoping, more sweet than anything. There is a little bitter/sourness on the flavor. It's a good brew, don't get me wrong, it's just a little too sweet and not as complex as I would have hoped, a little one sided. I do however get a nice taste in the middle of the drink that I can't quite identify, maybe dark fruit, it's very yummy though. So I guess it's a little complex, just not nearly complex as I would like. They do a very nice job of masking that 9% though, I can hardly taste the alcohol at all, I mean you know it's there because you can taste the sweetness and you can feel the alcohol when you drink it, but it's not an offensive alcohol taste. I keep getting this taste in the middle of the beer, it's really nice, it's like a cinnamon, candy, maybe even cake taste, it's so bazaar because it's so subtle I can barely pick up on it, but it's very nice. The mouthfeel on this beer is decent, it's thin in some areas and big in others, so that's a little disappointing, but the carbonation is just right. Drinkability is honestly better than it should be for 9%, with that being said it's still not the easiest beer to drink. Overall it's a good beer, is it the best porter I've ever had? No way, but it's good. The beer all around is too sweet, but it has some nice factors and I really liked that middle flavor I kept picking up on."
"O- Overall, not bad. The flavor profile was pretty mild and un-interesting."
"I really really enjoyed this one and would like to get more of it along with their milk stout to try side by side."
"O-I honestly dont like this beer at all. I had high hopes for it, but maybe Baltic Porters just arent for me. Just not what I expected"
"Overall it's a good offering from Duck Rabbit. A different porter for sure. A bit surprising for the style in most aspects."
"Pretty good beer overall, but not the best Baltic porter I've had."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O: Not a big fan of this one, if it tasted like it smelled it would be a lot more enjoyable but the acidic feel takes away from the taste and my overall opinion of the beer. Drinkable but not quite enjoyable."
"This smells and tastes distinctively different from any other baltic porter I've tried, though I have a hard time pinning down exactly what makes it unique. In any case, very good overall, and it inspires me to hunt down and try some other Duck-Rabbit beers."
"(12oz bottle courtesy of ewright!!). Pours near black-only some red hue is noticeable when held up to the light-with minimal khaki head. Aroma has dark chocolate, some cherry or strawberry and some light coffee. Taste has some roasty bitterness, but it is beautifully balanced by a sweet malt backbone. The bitter and sweet go back and forth on this beer. Medium bodied with an oily texture. Finish is a bit dry. What a great beer. It doesn’t drink like 9%abv either."
"o - Overall, VERY impressed with this brew. Would definitely seek this out if it was readily available to me. Don't have a bad word to say about it."
"D: This beer seems so complex, there are lots of flavor combining together and it's tough to really put your finger on them all, but they are very good and well balanced."
"D-For an out of the bottle offering this one doesn't miss the mark of what this one can bring to you when on draft. An excellent offering and one of the finest domestic examples of the style that I have had the pleasure of drinking."
"This is big beer. Needs to be sipped. It also helps to wait a minute or two to let the beer warm a bit to get all the flavors."
"Notes - This was just a really delicious beer. I've been impressed with everything I've had from Duck-Rabbit. *fist bump*"
"Notes: Full of flavor yet with an elegant moutfeel. A nice example that is more classic than a lot of American attempts at the style. Well done!"
"D- Drinks similar to an RIS. The smooth creaminess makes it easy to drink. It's warm and delightful. Perfect for a cold, rainy night such as this one."
"(111th)"
"All in all, this one surprised me. Best brew I've had from DR so far. If you like baltic porters, this one is very well balanced and deserves a try. If you like dark brews in general, I'd recommend trying this too. This is almost like a Yoohoo / Nesquik taste. Bravo Duck Rabbit."
"D: I didn't like this when I first had it, but I'm coming around to its unique approach to the style. I prefer Smuttynose's Baltic Porter to this one, but that shouldn't be taken as a strong criticism of this beer."
"The aroma was sweet with a hint of spice to the background. The smell would of been lovely if it was a tad stronger, I felt that I had to struggle to get the aroma out. The taste was of a very sweet malty back ground with a hit of spice. Mouthfeel was a bit on the thin side which I feel fits this style appropriatly even though it is a Baltic Porter. Will pick up again during the winter as this was a great brew to have."
"Get it!"
"Served from tap into a flared Pilsner glass. Poured a deep dark brown with a red hue around the edges in the light with a two finger dark tan head that subsided to one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark fruit, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasty malt, dark fruit, cream, dark chocolate, and very slight alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this is quite the excellent brew. If I'm honest it tasted slightly better out of the bottle I had in the past, but it is definitely no slouch on tap. The dark chocolate aspect was just more robust out the bottle from what I remember. Definitely a great flavor and aroma going on throughout this beer. An absolute must try without any doubt."
"On tap at Pizza Paradiso in Georgetownn DC. In line with several other delicious porters/stouts I've had recently. Velvety smooth, it's a beer which begs to be sipped and enjoyed. Roasted flavors, chocolate stand out. Very little hop bite - delicious!"
"drinkable - one and done."
"poured this beer from a 12 oz bottle into my southampton snifter. this beer pours a dark brown with a little bit of light making its way though on the edges. the smell is roasty and a little sweet. the taste is pretty similar mostly roasted malt character with a mild hop character to it. the mouthfeel is pretty good for the style, and the drinkability is good. if you trade with somebody from someone from north carolina try and work this one into the trade if you like dark beers."
"Anyone that I'm doing a trade with, make a note, SEND ME SOME OF THIS RABBIT DUCK STUFF. Very impressive for the first try of a brewery and even on a style that's hit or miss for me."
"D: Very delicious, and although the feel could be better, it's not a fatal flaw. Yet another great beer from the dark-beer masters--Duck Rabbit!"
"Overall, definitely one of the best Baltic porters out there."
"D - I really enjoy this beer, so much so that i sought it out in this trade after i received it as an extra in a previous trade. Its very drinkable and i wish i was able to get it here in California."
"This is one of the best regularly available beers coming out of the Southeast. Duck Rabbit does great things, and Baltic Porter is at the forefront as one of thier top achievements."
"D- this one get ya feelin right on a cold night. All the stuff I look for in a baltic porter. Maybe a bit sweeter then my ideal but it works nicely here. I'm having no problem drinking this glass but I'm trying to savor it. Its going down to easy."
"D: The beer needs to be sipped given its high alcohol content and full body."
"A superior winter warmer. Most definitely a sipper that reveals its flavor notes as the beer warms. Nice creamy head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of coffee and dark chocolate. Taste notes are heavy on licorice with some coffee. I also detected some metallic taste, but that seemed to go away as the beer warmed. Overall a very good beer and solid example of the style."
"D: Not an enjoyable drinking experience here. Some really weird and off flavors."
"D: Well, this would go down much easier if the body was a bit lighter and the alcohol was more deceptive (perhaps at 7-8% abv), but the flavor this brew packs is certainly worth being full after one or two bottles."
"Verdict: Quite nice. I'm tempted to make this one a winter regular as it does a good job at finding the boldness I seek in a porter and at balancing complementary flavors. Worth it should you find a place that carries this brewery's selections. Get some. B+ (3.9)"
"The mouth feel is thick, but different than a stout. Drinkability falls on how you feel about the flavor. Some may find it drinkable, others not so much. It's a big boy beer, that's for sure. Kinda like Left Hand Fade to Black on steroids. My ass has been kicked this early on Sunday morning. It challenged me on many levels. Here's where I'll tip my hat in appreciation of a fine ale and say good day."
"Drinkability: A very good beer, one that I have enjoyed in the past and will continue to enjoy. Definitely recommend."
"Taste is heavy in nutty maltyness, and a strong bit of smoke. Just a tinge of sweetness, which balances the beer nicely. I do get a bit of a hop finish. Medium full body, this is a great beer to be paired with food. On its own, however, its just not great for more than one drink."
"The Drinkability is great. Nice beer I look forward to each year."
"Overall impression - A great Baltic Porter, complex layering of flavors, no alcohol taste or smell considering the 9%ABV makes it appreciably drinkable. The thickness and complexity may slow you down the sweet aftertaste will keep you going."
"D: This is surprisingly drinkable for its strength and body thickness."
"D: To bad I only have one."
"O-Exceptional beer, easily my favorite offering from Duck Rabbit. The smokey and roasted malts are balanced perfectly by a dark fruit/chocolate sweetness. Be careful though those ABV's will creep up on you since you cannot taste them in the beer you forget its strength. Will definitely be seeking this beer out in the future."
"Mouthfeel is nicely creamy... very smooth, somewhat heavy, but the finish is a little harsh for me, and as a result drinkability is a little lower than it would be otherwise. A very solid offering from Duck Rabbit."
"Thanks to BucketBoy for the generous extra. 12oz. bottle served in my Old Stock snifter. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a quarter inch, loose, mocha-colored head embedded with tiny ringlets. Head quickly disperses towards the shoulders before dissipating into a thin band around the edges. No lacing on this one. Big bold nose - chocolate and dark fruit reminiscent of grape juice. There's also a slight bubblegum character. Taste is a bit more subdued than suggested by the nose and there is a slightly oxidized character and some acidity in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a prickly carbonation and a slight acidity. Definitely a solid Baltic Porter, but doesn't touch my go to BP - Smuttynose. I would, however, love the opportunity to try this on tap. Well worth your time if you have the opportunity to try this, but I would not recommend cellaring if this is a representative sampling."
"Quite complex. I've enjoyed a few baltic porters this year, and this is one of the better ones. A nice blend of vinousness (without any sourness), restrained roast, and sweet, dark maltiness."
"Other than the high carbonation, this is a very good beer. I will definitely drink this beer again"
"D. A really interesting mix of dark beer complexity with vinous notes that I have only recognized in sours until now. This is an interesting style that I'll be on the look out for in the future."
"The body is full and carbonation is fine in structure but active. Really nice mouthfeel. Overall a very nice beer that would be nice to have regular access to."
"D- Warm and heavy. Definitely a sipper. Strong. Alcohol not well hidden."
"Bottle. Poured into my CCB tulip glass a dark brown color with what starts as a 1/4 inch dark tan head that quickly settles to form a tan collar around the glass. The first aroma I smell is that of roasty coffee mixed with milky chocolate, slight tobacco, but overall a very mellow smell. Swirling to get a better smell creates some nice lace around the glass. The alcohol is pretty apparent in teh first sip I take but also dark fruits, roast, coffee, chocolate, and a touch of leather. Medium/heavy mouthfeel and pretty creamy. Slightly dry finish. Nice sipper."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, a touch of warmth. Light acidity going down but a pretty nice baltic porter. Thanks Russ!"
"Moderate to full in body with carbonation at the same level, too many bubbles for a dry beer that isn't too thick. More acidic and less malt dominated and thick than a typical Baltic Porter, a more historic variation on the style. Unique dry and acidic qualities make it easy to drink. Worth trying."
"Poured into a tulip glass. The pour brings a dark brown body with a tan head. Nose is pretty complex with some dark fruits, roasted malt, chocolate, and a tad bit of booze. The taste is dark fruits and brown sugar as well as a bit of chocolate and roast. Good feel with a tad bit of booze. Good beer all around and a solid offering from them."
"This is a great little baltic porter."
"D- a little too sweet, this is definitely a sipper...I'd prefer a little less sweetness and a little more bitterness. The balance isn't the best"
"D - only a couple before moving on."
"D- A very enjoyable beer that I will seek out again via trade, there is alot going on here and I would like to revisit. Baltic Porters are becoming one of my favorite styles and this is one of the best."
"Will probably not be seeking this out again."
"I'd suggest it to others in hopes they don't have this possible defect in their taste buds. Creamy, feels great, and almost all the other flavors are great. Fix the alcohol and you have a nigh on perfect beer."
"Drinkability: It's only moderate due to the weight and ABV -- I may be able to see past this just a little bit too if it wasn't for that slight off-scent and flavor of the butter, but it's still really good and I would love to have some more. One per sitting would suffice."
"This beer pours a nice deep dark brown color to the point that unless held directly to light it has the appearance of black. The tan foam on the surface is fading, but at a moderate rate. The aroma is of some nice smoked malts and coffee, dark chocolate notes are also prominent. Due to the higher ABV a sweet alcohol aroma can be smelled as well it gives a honey whiskey aroma to the mix. The taste is both a bit boozy and smokey. Both of those flavors in balance really make up the brew. The coffee essence is mild. This beer is a lot sweeter than I would have assumed the baltic porter would be. The mouthfeel is a bit all over the place. It's not nearly as thick as it seems to have poured and I feel that it could be carbonated a little bit more, but overall it's not that bad. The overt sweetness in comparison to the smoke is not as in balance as I would like. This however is a rather nice brew."
"4.5 D: DR's RIS disappointed me in how harsh it was. This could very well be an RIS and I enjoyed this one a hell of a lot more. Really good flavor profile and mouthfeel make this one good enough to come back to again and again. I wish I had another one."
"A sweet example of the style, but a decent one."
"Bottle, pours black with a beige head. Nose is sweet, some powdered chocolate, vanilla. A bit thin in the mouth, of course chocolate, some mild coffee, and a thoroughly unpleasant sour component that clashes horribly with the bitter coffee and light malt. I do not get this style."
"**EDIT-I like to read other reviews AFTER posting my own, and I would like to say that I most likely got a bad batch after reading what everyone else experienced. I will keep my post as is, but something may have gone wrong with this batch..."
"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours pitch black, with about one inch of khaki-colored fluffy head. Smells very boozy right off the bat. Cinnamon and other sugary-sweet aromas as well. Sweet dark fruit character gives way to bitter/roasty dark chocolate and molasses that finishes dry. Very soft carbonation but a full, chewy body. Alcohol warms the chest."
"Drinkability is good. You can tell the alcohol is in there, but it isn't overpowering. Great for a cool night. Overall, this is a well done Baltic Porter. My only gripe is the sweet fruity off flavor on the finish, but beyond that there isn't much to complain about. A good example of the style and worth checking out."
"I need to get myself more of this!"
"Duck- Rabbit did well with this porter, keeping with their dark beer experts tag line."
"Even at 9%, this thing drinks very easily. I could pour another one of these right now, but I'll use some restraint and save it for another day. This is a great beer."
"had at hoser's drunk by noon Sunday British Open tasting thanks presario for bringing this gem. I hadn't heard of this beer or brewery for that matter and feel like I've been missing out. drink this if you get the chance"
"d- $12-$15/6pk of this extremely enjoyable brew of a style that doesn't have a big representation in the market. duck-rabbit has a long-term customer for this one. I'll pick it up every time I see it."
"Beer is medium bodied and mildly smokey. Forward a little sweet and the back is bitter with grains and roast. The smoke character is minimal but its really good. I enjoyed this beer a lot. Drinkability high."
"D - This is a fantastic Baltic Porter and yet another great dark beer from the brewers of Duck-Rabbit."
"That duck-rabbit looks kinda funny in a winter hat. Tee hee. The beer pours a very dark brown, with the slimmest translucence possible, topped by a short, tan, foamy head. The nose comprises molasses, maple syrup, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, spruce tips, roasted malts, plums, and a bit o' chocolate. The taste follows very closely, though the plums and spruce tips are swallowed alive by the brown sugar and molasses midstroke. Still, the spiciness mixes well with the syrups and roasted malts, which is what you're lookin' fer in a baltic porter. The body is a hefty medium, with a heavy-moderate carbonation and a slightly chewy feel. Overall, a solid baltic; I expected nothing less from the DR."
"D: Were it not for the big beer nature of this beast, it would beckon for for another sip and another, and another. Eventually, though, it's just too rich for more than one bottle at a sitting."
"This is not a ""difficult"" beer, but hard to rate its drinkability: so many good things going on, but each element has so much power to it that they kinda clash & wrestle with each other most of the time. Could maybe stand some aging, it was on the hot side when I tried it, booze-wise. Still, very good overall. I'd love to try it on tap."
"Thick mouthfeel and a medium carbonation. A nice lagered baltic porter. Would purchase by the six pack if it was available in the area."
"Flavor is good! Malty, thicker than expected. Big cocoa and coffee notes through-out. Medium mouthfeel with medium to high carbonation. Slightly warming, but booze flavor is masked pretty well. An easy drinker to boot! A great porter."
"D: well I much prefer the Rabid Duck to this as it is just a bit too sweet for my liking. Would have loved to see the specialty grains balance this out a little bit."
"Edit: Had a chance to try it again recently and it was much tastier than I remembered."
"D - I was pleased, this is a decent baltic porter, a bit sweeter than some, but very drinkable and one I would be happy to try again. I like the complexity since it comes off as more ale, than lager-like but still smooth and not overly boozy either."
"D: Dangerously smooth at 9%, full flavored but well balanced. An interesting porter, in a good way. Yum."
"Thanks to a generous trader, whose identity I have now forgotten, for this tasty extra. Pours oily dark brown without a great deal of head, but a ring of bubbles around the glass assuages any concern with carbonation. Smells of lots of milk chocolate, dark fruits, and port. Interesting mix. Flavor follows with a little more emphasis on the fruit than chocolate but they're both still quite prominent. A dash of toffee floats around on the palate as well, along with brown sugar and molasses. Body is medium/thick with moderate carbonation. I'll have no difficulty downing this 12 ounce bottle, but one's enough for a session."
"very dark pour but a translucent body reveals the thin(ish) body within. it breathes firewater, touches of smoke, a roastiness and chocolate astringency. There is a sweetness in the front of every swallow that submerges beneath the roast and chocolate with the thin veneer of smoke clouding all from above. the body is thin, like the women from the TV. Lust crowds my head for my mouth is filled with good cheer."
"Maybe I'll try it again next time I'm there and try to think of it more as a Holiday Beer and see if I like it a little better."
"Overall a tasty brew. I need to try some more of their stuff."
"Just too syrupy sweet and thick for me. I haven't had too many Baltic Porters, so maybe I'm just not a fan of this style. On the positive side, the labeling is cool! :)"
"Wow! I was NOT expecting to like this so much. Now that I have tried it, I intend to buy more in the future. Fantastic showing Duck-Rabbit. I will be paying closer attention now."
"HV"
"D - not a huge fan at the beginning but this beer grew on me at the end i was sold on it, duck rabbit pulls out another dark beer that is great"
"D: Not sessionable... sip and savor."
"Really drinkable beer for being 9%. The flavors are very rich and enjoyable without being unbalanced or harsh. Excellent Baltic porter."
"Mouthfeel is good, but drinkability is low due to the creeping sourness and port notes that just don't work with the underlying flavor profile. This one is very unique and I could see how certain individuals may find it very appealing, so I would advise seeking it out for yourself and seeing if it is for you."
"D: I definitely recommend this beer, though one is plenty for me on any given occasion."
"Close to a finger of dark brown foam, thick yet only moderate staying power, about average lacing left behind. Jet black with nary a hint of color anywhere to be found, of course, completely opaque. Toasted coconut, caramel, dark chocolate, whipped cream, cherries and plums, oatmeal in the nose, not much hoppiness but there is a sudden lift before it all disappears. Medium-bodied, the carbonation coils and leaps through the mouth to relieve any unwanted weight or pressure. You get both barrels of that coconut, vanilla, butterscotch, café con leche, dark chocolate right from the start. Cherry, strawberry, raspberry fruit as if slathered in chocolate. Grainy, if not bready, at all the right times, adroitly sidesteps extra sweetness. Manages to linger and clean up at once at the end, let's you choose how long it sticks around."
"A: Half a pencil of head off a hard pour, pitch black with only a touch of light passing at the rim, no visible lacing - 4.00, S: Tons of coffee and ash, the specialty malts shine in this beer, very slight sweetness that reminds me of dates, faintest signs of alcohol - 4.00, T: Raisin juice, sturdy use of malts, chocolate frappuccino, alcohol is quite evident and maybe takes away a little from the palate, brandy soaked dates and prunes - 4.50, M: Medium bodied and creamy - 4.50, D: An exceptional example of the style, extremely enjoyable though the high alcohol would be a little limiting - 4.00"
"Notes: Hmmm, I think this is my first go at Duck-Rabbt. Having overheard often that it is typically hit or miss with them this one is surely on the hit column."
"Very nice, but extremely drinkable high gravity beer. Deep rich mahogany color, with hints of chocolate and a bit of roasted barley. Substantial body, with strong dark malt character, with just a hint of hops present."
"The Mouthfeel is a little on the heavy side with no light passing through the beer. The burnt taste seems to overpower the rest of the flavors. I could imagine making this beer into some kind of milkshake. Feels like I am having some kind of decadent chocolate dessert of some sort.."
"With about 18 months on it, this is even better. Smells something like malted milk. More smooth, creamy and mellow. De-lish."
"D-this is so drinkable, big bold flavors with a nice complexity and a hint of balance. very sweet, just a bit too much carbonation."
"Mouthfeel is thick with moderate to low carbonation. I usually enjoy DR's darker beers and this is no exception. I very good drinking and tasty Baltic porter for a cold winter night. It might not be the prettiest, or the best smelling but it is thick and delicious which matter most to me for the style."
"The pours is deep and dark, similar to any good imperial stout. I try to identify any hint of color, but it is as black as can be. The thin head that sits on top is a medium chocolate brown, like the foam on top of a vigorously poured glass of chocolate milk. The aroma is unremarkable, with just a bit of crisp sweetness and just the slightest touch of booze. Where this one stands out is in the flavor and texture. Richly sweet, with flavors of bittersweet chocolate and molasses, and an underlying bitterness akin to a lightly roasted coffee. The mouthfeel is silky smooth. If it were any sweeter, it would almost seem syrupy with how little carbonation it has, but the smoothness works with the flavor to create a rich, decadent, but smooth drinking experience."
"2009 bottles. Fresh is best with Duck-Rabbit, don't worry about aging. No sourness when fresh, last bottle I'm having here in early February is picking up a tartness in the taste. There is also some consistency issues with this beer...I've had a few over the years that were off, even beyond the sourness it picks up over time, as well as one that was completely flat and not very good at all (guessing it wasn't capped properly). This loses a lot of its luster as you get to the bottom of the glass. Overall incredibly flavorful, and packs quite a punch, feels like 11%, but I think it's a little over-rated. I do prefer Sinebrychoff Porter, but this is also an excellent example of a Baltic Porter, and one I will enjoy each year it comes out."
"Poured a very deep brown with good carbonation and a tan head. Nose is chocolate, roasted and coffee. Taste is oh so smooth, milk chocolate, coffee, booze and roasted malts, oats perhaps. Mouthfeel is smooth, coating and sweet with cocoa. Drinkability is very, very good."
"I think I like the aged one a little better than the fresh because the the malts haven't really worked in yet in the fresh one. Also, the mouthfeel is a little too creamy with the fresh one."
"D: First time I have reviewed any of their beers but I have had a few and have always enjoyed them. Really great Baltic porter. Thanks again."
"d- i would actually love to have a fresh bottle of this to re-review this seeing as this is an '08. i now notice it is notched best before 11/09. this is very bitter and not many tastes compliment the bitterness and booziness here."
"I really want to get another couple and age them and see how that goes in about 6 months and a year to see how the flavors meld."
"drinkability is with ease. it is strange. its warm, without doubt. and while i know alcohol to be warming, i dont think the alcohol is obvious. a quirky beer no less. fun to experience, but one is enough."
"Well, happily surprised to report this is an excellent beer. No knock on Duck-Rabbit, but baltic porters haven't been in my sweet spot & this is one fine brew. Recommended any time of the year."
"O - I have to find this again. I don't think this could be improved upon. Cheers!"
"Overall this beer is very good. The 9% limits its sessionabilty, but this beer offers a lot of flavor and complexity. Very interesting and I will definitely seek out other baltic porters, as I want to see how other brewers incoroporate the tangy/ sour aspects associated with this classic porter style."
"I found this one to be a great drinking beer. Very smooth and nearly decadent on the palate. Deliciously drinkable for the reported ABV. Another beer I'd like to have available more often. I would imagine I could use this one in a dessert of some sort, too. Maybe even reduce it in some time of sauce."
"really wish I had more. Thanks again Wil, I guess I'll have to bug you for some more soon."
"Overall, this is one huge baltic porter. It is a little hot for me, but other than that it packs a lot of flavor. Fairly drinkable considering the abv, but would be a lot better if the heat wouldn't show so much. I wonder if this would do well with some years on it."
"Rich and sweet, roasty and chocolatey taste. A little sticky, creamy but astringent in the first sips though it mellows as it warms. Pleasant aftertaste with roast malt, plum/raisin, and chocolate milk traces. A well balanced and flavorful porter, great for the cool winter months."
"Awesome, but dont want to drink more than 1 a night this thing is so big. glad I got a case from my parents for christmas this year to share with everyone! Every time I have a duck rabbit it reminds me of being back home in NC... grab some"
"The aroma of this beer is very impressive, and I would probably like it for that alone. Overall a pretty good Baltic Porter."
"Overall, this beer is pretty good, but not a baltic porter to me, more like a smoked porter. To be a true bp should be a lot sweeter."
"Overall, the sweetness damages the drinkability a bit, but the flavor profile is still a revelation - the same could be said about a lot of Southern food in my opinion. This is a distinctly regional concoction that is superior to a lot of the originators of the style. Really impressive - I hope to try more from this brewery someday."
"Pours very dark with a large tan head that had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. The aroma was a little unusual in that the dominant aroma was the acidity. I thought we might be onto something with this beer. The dark malt lends hints of chocolate and some smoke. Unfortunately the taste does not live up to the aroma. Seems to be a very middle of the road porter with a high ABV. The only thing that makes this rememberable is the slight acidity in the finish. The malt just does not seem to be there. There are hints of chocolate and smoke but I want much more especially with this ABV. The body is just better than average and that is saved by the nice carbonation. Just seems a very average Baltic Porter. It definately would not offend anyone."
"D: This one is highly drinkable which could be cause for concern with abv!"
"D - much respect for Duck-Rabbit, but i was a bit cautious coming into it because of previous experiences with the style. not anymore, downright delicious. never seen it in bottles anywhere around here but would definitely pick up some more."
"Pours midnight black with a thick mocha head. This is one awesome looking beer, the head just doesn't stick around for very long. If the rest of the beer is as good as it looks it should be winner. First couple of whiffs reveal some dark chocolates, nice dark roasty malts. There's some nice sweet dark fruitiness as well, with a slight alcohol presence. No hops to speak of but this one is all about the malts. First few sips reveal a nice sweet dark fruit flavors, hints of raisin and maybe some grape as well. Along with some nice dark chocolates. There's a nice roastiness lying in the background. Feels so smooth and creamy in the mouth with perfect carbonation. This one goes down nice, smooth and easy perfect for sipping on a cold winter nights."
"A total comfort beer...and Duck-Rabbit's best? Maybe so. Certainly a must-try if you're a fan of the style, of dark beers, of beer in general, of putting things in your mouth that taste amazing, of living the good life, or of, um, about anything!"
"This is another solid offering from Duck Rabbit!"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint-glass a deep opaque black with a nice frothy dark tan head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice amount of dark malts with slight cocoa. The taste is a very enjoyable amount of dark malts and lingering bitter cocoa flavor. The beer is medium bodied with slight alcohol presence. While this one has shown to get better with age, it's very enjoyable fresh as well."
"The mouth is very creamy. Nice thick, slightly chewy body. Alcohol presence makes itself know right away in the flavor. Slight astringent zip there, but this dissipates. Flavors of syrupy pancakes, pumpernickel bread, dark chocolate, and even a touch of cold coffee in there. This has been one of the more elusive DR offerings for me, as I see to keep missing its release. Not this year. This is really good. Definitely one of their best beers. Recommend."
"A very respectable baltic porter, to say the least. I'm very glad to have had the opportunity to experiment with this beer, and my first beer from Duck-Rabbit gets a thumbs up."
"D - Almost 4 years of age, this beer still has a nice amount of ""oomph", but the 9% ABV is really hidden well and the age has helped contribute to this. A top-notch BP and with almost 4 years of age, it's really shining."
"overall i greatly look forward to this treat every year....its still a little green around the edges in its current state this year but it hasnt even hit store shelves yet either...as usual this brew will age quite well man i cant wait to secure my case or two.."
"This one is delicious and easy drinking. At the halfway point though, I'm already starting to feel the 9.00%abv. Not one for sessioning, but very tasty."
"Appears an opaque black hue nice tan head that forms fine even lacing. Aromatics come correct with the malt sweetness and roasty qualities associated with a porter upfront with the plum, raisin, dark chocolate roasts and creamy milk chocolate malt balls with a touch of slightly burnt coffee roasts. Flavors bring out dark roasted malts with tart raisin fruitiness and brown sugar caramelized sweetness going on, more milk chocolate malted Whoppers coming in with toffee and strong bitter black roasts as well, finishes with a touch of fruity booziness and a herbal hop bouquet. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with even smooth carbonation. Drinkability is excellent"
"Final thoughts: This is a lip smacking, high octane dark porter. It doesn't overstretch the bounds or experiment much, but its still a great beer. Adds some nice roasted and charred as well as chocolate malts, creamy and slightly chalky, pretty robust as well as complex but smoothed well. The chocolate and alcohol finish linger for a little longer than necessary, but otherwise a good consistent beer, but similar to many other great strong porters."
"smooth, medium body, then moments of thinness, some acidic texture, but accentuated to quite a sour bite by the otherwise moderate, almost creamy carbonation."
"Very smooth taste, fairly light body for such a hardcore porter. Which is very welcome. Very toasty almost burnt flavor to it. I think ti's just awesome, the 9% abv adds a lot too it to, very warming and sharp. This beer would be perfect on a nice cold night, but it's still welcome in the middle of summer!"
"A 12 ounce bottle, 2008 vintage. Poured into my DFH shaker glass. The porter appears an opaque dark brown color with about a finger of quickly fading ecru head. Nose and flavor consist of raisins soaking in molasses, bakers chocolate, bittersweet cocoa, sweet caramel, nice deep roastiness, more molasses, tobacco, a slight hint of red berries. The porter is approaching full bodied and is adequately carbonated. A very nice example of the style and I'm glad they (D-R) are in the PA market now."
"The pour was fantastic. A rich dark brown in color, essentially black with a large tan head on top of it that only slightly faded into nice lacing up and down the sides of the glass. Aroma is full of dark fruits, rich, sweet and nearly perfectly done. Nice touches of boozy aroma and rich tobacco notes. Smooth and seductive flavor of rich dark chocolate, smooth dark cherry notes and a touch of sweet molasses and tobacco. A very big beer that hides its alcohol well, this made a fantastic night cap."
"Pretty drinkable, despite the alcohol heat. I'm pretty glad I still have a couple of these in the cellar!"
"There is an intense amount of flavor. Raisins, Malts, Sugary Sweetness. Lots and lots of flavor. This seems to me to be a better version of raison dr etre. This makes the long line of locals that I wish were available in Ohio."
"via jyounger30"
"Taste is filled with roasty, toasty and fruit notes...pretty much parallels the nose with a bit more toasty and hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is very full with a thick, tongue-scraping coffeeish residue left on the palate. This is a very good beer that I would easily buy again."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a thick, oily, India Ink black that shows barely any dark mahogany hues when its held to the light. Just a light ring of head remains after it was poured. The aroma is a dead ringer for an RIS. Huge Hershey's chocolate syrup notes with coffee, black patent malt and just a bit of toffee. The taste is just as big as the aroma. Chocolate and black patent malts dominate the flavors with hints of astringent espresso and molasses, bit of vanilla and toffee. This beer has a great flavor. The mouthfeel is the only thing that really reminds me more of a Baltic Porter rather then an Russian Imperial Stout. It's a bit thin and finishes exceptionally dry, for a big beer. There isn't much residual sugar in the mouthfeel. This is a damn fine beer. Damn fine."
"D - sip slow my friends, dont just taste the flavors, listen to them. this beer tells a story from start to finish and feels like it could literally slow down time. I couldn't think of a better way to pair this on a cool night next to a warm fire, this beer truly is THE winter warmer."
"Oh well."
"Ummm...Yum! Duck-Rabbit has a big time winner with this one! A total package of enjoyment for any Baltic Porter out there. Drinkable by as many as you can handle as that 9% ain't anywhere to be found."
"7/4/8/4/14 (3.7/5)"
"Enjoyable!"
"Drinks pretty good, but the thickness & booze slow me down after a bit. Went great with brownies, another good'un from Duck Rabbit"
"Pours out a beautiful dark black brown with huge brown head. Starting off really well it smells like roasted malts, chocolate, and a hint of sweet molasses. Does not smell like any baltic porter I've ever had. Taste is an explosion, burnt malts, bitter chocolate, roasted coffee, big in every way. Slight alcohol warming in the finish and leaves you lingering with that burnt bitterness that lingers. Almost has that milk stout texture but with this weird underlying belgian fruit flavor(raisons and something else can't pick it out). Very sticky and almost sweet after a while, but all around one of the best baltic porters i've had. Very interesting and big beer that drinks smooth and warms up on a cold night. Nice brew, will drink again."
"Thin body but really good. Warming alcohol down the throat. My only complaint is it was a little to carbonated. Overall this is Grace Jones of the beer world. Hot, tall, dark and sexy, but too animal to control."
"D - Duck Rabbit's finest beer out of what I've had so far. An excellent beer all around. There is an exceptional balance of fruity/malty sweetness and roasty/coffee dryness. Neither becomes overpowering and are in perfect harmony with each other. I will definitely have more of this around in the future. Great stuff."
"D: The sweetness adds up after a while but it's tasty."
"M/D - Medium bodied, lacking just a little. Rather creamy with just enough carbonation to tickle the tongue. Easily drinkable with a well masked alcohol profile depsite the 9%."
"Mouthfeel is surprisingly light bodied and smooth."
"D = Decent drinkability for a beer of this style and ABV, but a definite sipper all the same."
"J"
"D: I could easily drink a few in a sitting. Very enjoyable Porter. I'm glad I got the opportunity to try this great brew. Now I really want to try more offerings from Duck Rabbit!"
"Need more of this beer."
"A great way to end my day."
"I agree with a previous post that this is a beer to sip. It is a great porter, but the powerful sweet taste makes it a beer I would like to enjoy less frequently than some others. Duck Rabbit never disappoints."
"D: Definitely a sipper, but not unpleasant. I was trying side-by-side, so difficult not to compare to a much easier to drink porter."
"Complex standout brew that is one of my top rated active bottled beers for the Baltic Porter style."
"Overall, one of the better baltic porters out there and my favorite offering from Duck Rabbit. I might have to go back and get a second sixer..."
"This is an excellent Baltic Porter and I continue my search for examples of this style. I can't get enough. Another great beer from Duck-Rabbit."
"D: This is another solid brew from a brewery I am falling in love with. I haven't had a bad or mediocre beer from the yet, and I can't wait to see what they have up their sleeves as they get bigger. This beer is solid in all categories and is a pleasure to drink. I could waste a day while putting away a six pack of these and be a happy camper. Great beer."
"Pours a deep black color, no light whatsoever getting through this one. There is a hint of red to it, but black is the operative word here. A very thin, caramel head that quickly disappears. Definitely smell the malt backbone to this brew, with some chocolate hints, as well as the alcohol. A very nice blend in the aroma, and I sometimes am not a fan of detecting the alcohol in the scent. Taste is what made this for me. Love the robust flavor that mixes the obvious malts, but also a mix of a coffee flavor, and the alcohol, with a sour bite after you take a sip. Sweet to sour flavor as you drink is awesome. That bite is there when you take a nice full swill. The alcohol is warming and nice. For me, an excellent beer, but not one I could have many of. It stands out as an excellent beer to simply have one of, as it is so distinct."
"I wish I had more of these."
"Drinkability: Another solid brew from Duck Rabbit, though what's really holding me back seems to be their yeast strain (either that, or every beer I've ever had from them has been slightly infected). It adds interesting dimensions to most of them, but oftentimes just seems to dominate what otherwise would be a stylistically accurate, tasty brew. Other than that, sure, it's interesting, and with a well-hidden amount of alcohol. Give it a try."
"Pours a deep, rich, opaque sable, nearly black, with a thick, dark tan head that dissipates slowly. Rich aroma has good coffee and smoky tones, and an overtone of miso or salted fish. Flavor has the same fishy/salty overtone, but is still pleasingly smoky with hints of roast coffee, unsweet chocolate and hops, and a nutty undertone. Texture is thick and smooth, leaving a whisper of sweetness in the lively aftertaste."
"Overall I enjoy this beer a lot and see it as a quintessential Baltic Porter. Give this one a shot."
"On a scale of darkness ranging from Edgar Allan Poe to Nietzsche's anti-Christ, I give this beer a David Lynch sequel rating."
"Black pour with a good tan head. Nice roasty and earthy flavors. Malt, peat, coffee. Some creaminess in the mouth. Slight alcohol at the finish, but not too much. Not sure if I like it more than their standard porter, but it's close. Obviously can't drink quite as many of them as their standard."
"This was a very different but interesting Baltic Porter. It had lots of the traditional elements but there was just a strange flavor that I could only describe as cream cheese. I really like it for it's uniqueness though, good stuff."
"first I would like to say that this is the first Baltic Porter that I have had, and I think that this is a wonderful introduction. The color as someone stated before me is such a dark brown that it does indeed almost appear black. The aroma is a little creamy with big doses of toasted malt. Despite the relatively high alcohol levels this tastes a bit lighter than many other porters that I have had, thus drastically upping the drinkablilty. Cheers to the boys a Duck Rabbit on this one. Very well done."
"Pours a very deep, dark brown almost black with a coffee colored head. Strong malty aroma with lots of chocolate and coffee with hints of tofee, nut and sugar. Rich, malty flavor with dark chocolate, coffee, toffee, sugar cane, alcohol ad dark fruit. Very smooth and creamy up front with a warming alcohol snsation in the finish. Excellent."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, this is a very good beer to drink for a long time if your in the mood for a high-octane porter."
"I'm reviewing this one again as I enjoyed the bottle I had more than the tap version. This is a world class Baltic Porter and I'm glad I've got access to it!"
"This one's dark, edges were deep brown and the cap was dark tan. Looked like low carbonation off the pour and a thin collar formed. Spotty, sticky lacing. Rich malt aroma, lots of ripe fruits, roast and burnt grain, chocolate, plums, faint alcohol. The flavour was quite fruity throughout, lots of plums. Bitterness was restrained, roasted grains appeared later on. Light chocolate sweetness towards the end, with alcohol flavour kicking in right in the finish. Very fruity. Mild warmth, medium to full bodied, low carbonation, quite smooth and creamy. Slight astringency. Very drinkable and quite delicious."
"Deep black pour with a healthy, frothy, tan top. Aroma of roasted malts with some vanilla. Very sweet front with a barely grainy texture. A little like a mild peppermint coffee (whatever that is). There's a sweet layer that sticks to you throughout like a muscadine wine. On another level it finishes with dark chocolate."
"Drinkability: Not sure what the big deal is, not for me - didn't enjoy it."
"D - The 9% alcohol is very well hidden in this brew. Very enjoyable brew, and highly recommended for those who enjoy the style."
"A wonderful sipper."
"Bottle shared with, and thanks to Eric. Pours a dark brown with a decent light brown head. The aroma is nutty, burnt malt and smoke. The taste is amazing: dark fruits, maybe raisin, dark cherry, a tartness, some really deep burnt malts, maybe some soy sauce related flavors. Just amazing. Little to no hint of alcohol, a really smooth but substantial beer. I could drink this all day. This is what beer should be: unique, well made, and taking a stand."
"The feel is soft and lightly carbonated with a quaffable medium body. Surprisingly drinkable given the potent, very well-hidden ABV."
"D: Strong. One at a time but enjoyable."
"D: Pleasantly complex and better than an average porter."
"It's not my favorite style of beer, but I don't grade on what I like, instead on how the brewer fit the style. This IS a Baltic Porter."
"A good brew, but Duck Rabbit has a lot of better stuff. Still worth a try."
"Whoa man, this is a heck of an aroma - rich with milk and dark chocolate, smokey wood, raspberries, sweet cherries, java, and bubblegum. The flavor has a little trouble standing up to such a high standard, but it hangs in there with a predominantly smooth Swiss chocolate taste that reminds me of Southern Tier Choklat. Yum. There's also slight black pepper note, along with sour cherry (though not a big tart feel), and licorice. The body is a bit thick, but oh so smooth and tasty. This beer is a must-try for fans of big, dark beers."
"The beer is dark brown colored with a thin tan foam and an aroma of slightly smoked but still sweet malts. A nice intro to a delicious Baltic Porter, more of a smoked porter. The taste follows the nose, malt heavy and peat-like, more sweetness from the malts than roast, nearly bock-like. This is possibly my favorite Baltic Porter, highly recommended."
"D- This beer is delicious with huge black malt flavors while staying smooth and complex aswell."
"Medium bodied and smooth. Starts getting a little sticky before the roasted malts kick in some crisp bitterness. A big beer that begs you to take another sip. Very nice."
"Flavor is HUGE... way more than the nose.. big dark malts.. chocolate and dark caramel.. dried fruit.. sweet but the dark malt essence helps .. coffee acidity with a shot of dried cherry and plum thrown in.... Amazingly complex... Body is fairly big and carbonation is smoth.. more chocolate as it warms.. very very smooth and very drinkable as long as I sip... just keep on sipping.. This is a fantastic brew.. I wish I had more than just what's left in my glass..."
"D: This is definitely good stuff - I'm enjoying sipping on it."
"Medium-full body with lowish carbonation. Very chewy and a little sticky. Finish is long and fulfilling. Great beer."
"overall, i really enjoyed this a really good brew"
"Drinkability - This is a great porter. It is very easy drinking and it tastes awesome. This is my second offering from Duck-Rabbit, and their beers have been fantastic. I definitely look forward to acquiring some more."
"cheers..."
"If this was available where I live I would immediately go buy a case. Glad I had the opportunity to try. Seek this out. It's delicious."
"Sample via piscator- been wanting to try this for awhile- thanks Kris! Pours very dark, little head or lacing. Nose- powerful nose with many flavours hitting the nose- spice and plums , smoke and roast. Taste- full bodied and vinous. Little bit boozy in a good way. Black licorce, oak and roasty malts. Smooth drinkiing that coats the mouth on the way down. nice stuff"
"Pours to a jet black sexy body. Head is one inch of carmel dark tan fuzz that quickly fades to a skim in minutes. Nose has a sharp spices character that is invigorating and carries ssome dark fruit sweetness as well. Creamy smooth dark maltiness coats the mouth on first sip. Silky dark chocolate is matched with ripe plum and raisen pie notes. Rich biscuit like tones are also there mixed in with the dark fruit. This is a very well made baltic porter. Brandy like alchol notes show briefly on the palate then warm the belly. Mouthfeel may be a little to thick but still nice. Drinkability is solid."
"Drinkability - the sweetness I'm okay with, but the vinous bit is a little aggressive for the style, and I wasn't fully expecting it. Some six beers into the evening, I'll give it some leeway. An awful lot of goodness in these bottles, though, a big shout out to ipa2xs for sending a sixer of these my way, I'll cellar some and have some with bbq as well."
"Overall: Well it looks like the beer gods have blessed farmville, NC this beer is simply incredible. Judging by when its release is I'm drinking it with about 9 months of age on it so perhaps that is playing into the smoothness. One of the 10 best beers in the world that I have tried and ive tried a lot, lot more then I have reviewed. Seize this if you see it!"
"Pours dark black with a wonderful aroma of cocoa, coffee, and licorice. Taste starts out with a heavy coffee flavor, and has notes of smoke, wood, dark fruits, and licorice. Finishes both bitter and smoooth. Very thick mouthfeel. Medium-high carbonation. Big, impressive beer."
"drinkability is good. the alcohol reminds me of an old ale - it's obvious that it's there, but balanced well against the malt/caramel/fruit. i am forcing myself to drink it slowly, but it's just so damn good."
"Mouthfeel was velvety smooth. There was a very faint metallic tinge, but not enough to ruin the experience. I chalk that up to bad timing (this one arrived at the tail end of a local heat wave). Would love to try this again."
"This beer pours a dark brown almost black color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and recedes quickly into thin lacing. The aroma is of toffee, chocolate, graham cracker, and has a mellow astringency. The taste is like the aroma, but more astringent. The finish has a lingering alcohol presents. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a nice Baltic Porter. I could easily drink this beer again."
"Notes: Thanks to WeisGuy for tossing this one is as an extra, it was a very pleasant surprise."
"Drinkability: Best porter I've had yet. I'm genterally hard on the style, but this is wonderfully complex and very tasty. High ABV may limit you, but flavor and enjoyment will not. Highly recommended."
"Always wanted to try something from this brewery and I heard this was their best, so I went after it, one of the better baltic porters I have tasted, good for the money especially, would drink again, recommended"
"Drinkability- I really enjoyed this brew tremendously. I'm not 100% sure but I think this could be my first Baltic Porter. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting but I'm happy with the result. This is a different brew that is really nice that I'd like to drink on regular occasion, too bad that can't happen. Big thanks again to Brent for the opportunity to try this fantastic brew!"
"D - My first baltic porter did not disipoint. All the porter taste with that little extra kick that causes this to be a dangerous brew when having more then a couple."
"One of my two or three favorite porters."
"Pretty good over all."
"I'd like to try more of this if I can and enjoy this baltic porter style so I was quite happy with this beer and look forward to other Duck-Rabbit offerings."
"D - not an all night beer by any means."
"Alcohol presence is much stronger in the taste department that I feel it takes away from the subtle aspects, coffee is evident and possibly some chocolate tones but it is basically overwhelmed, pretty good creaminess to it though, just needs to be toned down a notch or two."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is heavy and sweet - tons of body and weight. Carbonation is light and spritely, but has to fight its way through the syrupy goodness. Drinkability? Well, it's good, but it's heavy. I don't think I could do more than one at a time and actually enjoy it, but the flavors really are quite good."
"T_Not digging this one too much. The sour aftertaste and syrup feel make this hard to swallow. Literally. I would rather go to the bodega down the street and drink whichever Polish Porter they have."
"i revisited this one last night, 03/04/2009 and i won't adjust my numbers, but suffice to say that this beer would rate an entire point lower than when i rated it a year ago. the taste is fruity and metallic. it was nearly a complete drainpour."
"Overall: Not my favorite sytle or beer, but it is pretty nice nonetheless. Baltic porters are my least favorite porter but so far, for me this is the best of the bunch. Duck Rabbit knows how to do it no doubt."
"Pours pitch black. Thin dark tan head. Nose is a touch of alcohol and thick malts. Flavor is wow! Thick malty, tar, and minor molasses. After taste seems like a thinner molasses. A little too bright, but amazing all the same. Feel is great on the body with a low carbonation, but it feels really nice. This is an amazing interpretation of a Baltic Porter from an American producer. I have had a lot of Eastern European Baltic Porters, and this is easily as good a production as those from that region."
"Thanks to DrBayern for this one - Pours a lovely oily, heavy looking black color with a big fluffy lasting brown head. Looks amazing. Smell is a deep roasty, sticky, teriyaki/soy like sweetness. I got pretty much only hearty smells and no dried fruity sweet aromas from this one. As it warms it smells more and more smoky, soy-like and like liquified smoked beef jerky. Reminds me a lot of Flying Dog Gonzo Porter. Taste is rich, with similar smoky roasty mildly tart/sweet soy flavors. Mouthfeel is perfect. Carbonated lightly, and the body is rich, thick, creamy and velvety smooth. The alcohol is also extremely well hidden for 9 %, but the almost ""savory"" like heartiness and the smoky, meaty flavor I got from it would keep this from being a beer I personally could drink again and again. Still a well made beer all around."
"I must admit I was somewhat disappointed in this brew after high expectations. trying to figure out what the funky almost bacon grease nose is to this brew. The alcohol is a little to up front on the palette and bitter on the backside. After seeing the prior reviews I can see i'm not in the majority on this one..I think i'll stick to the stouts! I think I figured out this funky smell it's almost like pork rinds..None the less this might be better with a bag of pork rinds!"
"D: The aftertaste kills any of the drink ability in this for me. I can barely get through a single bottle without wanting to pour it out."
"*Taster's Note: Special thanks to nflmvp for the bottle."
"D: It was an easy creamy rich brew that was a joy to drink. It strained the line between a porter and a stout making this a cross bread wonder that I'd love to have more of."
"Alcohol is totally masked. This beer has near perfect mouthfeel. It is rich and thick without being viscous or syrupy."
"Probably the best porter I've ever had. Nice!"
"D - I really, really wanted to try this beer and I really, really liked it! Would definitely order again. Do try if you get a chance! Duck Rabbit are doing great things."
"Great beer to sit, sip and enjoy slowly. Filling so I don't think I do more than one in a sitting but I do want more. First beer I had from Duck Rabbit can't wait to try some more of their brews"
"Thanks to weisguy for a 12oz bottle. Poured into a Duvel snifter. Poured a black color with a tan head that foamed up to a finger thickness. Smell is a bit medicnal with hints of chocolate, smoke, and alcohol. Taste is very similar to the smell with some coffee and dark fruit added to the mix and a strong liquorice and alcohol aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full body with a low creamy carbonation level that suits the beers flavors. While a good beer the medicinal and alcohol flavors made it a little hard to drink."
"I wanted to like this, I looked forward to it, but in the end...eh....sorry..."
"Pours near black, brownish ruby edges. Thin tan head soon leaves a ring with no lacing. Dark fruits, licorice, molasses, a light smoked scent. Caramel and coffee. Spicy burn compliments taste. A little sour pear/green apple flavor underneath all along. Nice and creamy full body up front and somewhat bitter approaching dry finish. A unique beer, very complex. Makes me wonder how the Rabid Duck will be this year, though I think this is my favorite seasonal from DR."
"Appears an opaque black hue nice tan head that forms fine even lacing all the way through my sample, btw thanks jcdiflorio for a nice taste of this rare brew. Aromatics come correct with the malt sweetness and roasty qualities associated with a porter upfront with the plum, raisin, dark chocolate roasts and creamy milk chocolate malt balls with a touch of slightly burnt coffee roasts. Flavors bring out dark roasted malts with tart raisin fruitiness and brown sugar caramelized sweetness going on, more milk chocolate malted Whoppers coming in with toffee and strong bitter black roasts as well, finishes with a touch of fruity booziness and a herbal hop bouquet. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with even smooth carbonation really velvet like in texture on the palate didn't weight me down in any way. Drinkability is excellent one of the better Baltic porters out there in today's market, I'm a fan but it still doesn't compare to my memories of Perkuno's."
"I tried a 2007 of this back to back with a 2006 and don't feel like this keeps too well. The alcohol burn has warn off in the elder version, leaving a bit too much of that aforementioned sweetness."
"This beer pours a nearly black hue with brown highlights when held up to the light. A very small light mocha head quickly dissipated and left a small blanket of head. The scent is big and malty with highlights of brown sugar, dark chocolate, and rum soaked dark fruits (plums and raisins). I think this smells more like a Russian Imperial stout than a porter, but that doesn't bother me at all. The taste is heavy on roasted grain and bitter chocolate. Secondary in the flavor profile are tastes of coffee, toffee, and dark fruits. This is a damn well crafted beer. The mouthfeel is so very smooth and full bodied with the alcohol very well hidden. The drink ability is very good on this for several beers."
"The taste is very good, initially there is a sweet malty flavor but its followed quickly by a slight fruity (raisin) taste with that tiny bit of licorice. Finally the hop bite kicks in and you are left with a bitterness that massages the sides of your tongue. This beer has a very solid heavy taste but not in a bad way. The sweetness is balanced nicely with the bitterness and leaves you with a nice mouth feel. A very fine beverage well worth looking for."
"Prosit, MK"
"Highly recommended. This is an excellent Baltic Porter - lots of strong flavors going on here that complement themselves nicely. I may save a bottle to see what age does to it."
"Body is big, silky, and very smooth. Rich and mouthcoating with an oily, slick texture. Probably couldn't drink more than one per sitting due to the richness. A solid example of the style."
"Overall- A nice sipper. A few of these on a cold night would do the trick."
"Great example of the style. Probably my second favorite behind the Olfabrikken."
"Mouthfeel is very creamy and thick. This one didn't go over very well with me. I would like to try other Duck-Rabbit beers though."
"Well not really what I expect from a Baltic Porter. Basically what we have here is an Imperial Milk Stout with a fairly sharp patent malt taste. Meh don't think I need any more of these."
"Definitely a fantastic beer and I'm glad I was able to acquire a six pack. Now I just need to somehow make it last, because I don't know when I'm going to be able to get any more."
"Pours black. Thats about all there is to say about the color, this stuff is dark. Theres a beige head that fades pretty rapidly leaving just a thin ring. The initial aroma of dark, bittersweet chocolate is noticeable as soon as I opened the bottle. The mouth feel is thick and quite smooth. Theres a moderate about of carbonation to tingle the tongue as well. Initially the flavor is that of dark chocolate. The alcohol provides a warming sensation on the way down. The alcohol is well played in this one. It is not overbearing nor unpleasant. As the beer warms, roasted coffee flavors begin to emerge, along with some dark fruit. There are some faint bitter hops detected in the aftertaste, along with roasted coffee."
"D: Very tasty but I'd probably only have one in a sitting. The remaining 5 shouldn't have trouble getting drank."
"It's got some not-so-great characteristics, but I would try it again. Letting this one age a year might help as well."
"There is a good beer buried here, but as it stands now it's quite tough to drink. I'm going to cellar the remainder of my 6 pack because I really believe this will be heaps better in a year or... three. Just now it's too young and wild and needs to sit in the corner till it learns to behave."
"M/D: Thick on the tongue and more carbonation then I expected. This one is a sipper but one that I would definately reach for second of."
"Pours a solid black with a good sized tan head that dissipates quickly to a ring on top and minimal lacing. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted coffee up front, touch of hops and alcohol hidden underneath. Taste is rich with chocolate and dark fruits. I imagine sour cherries and black currant as I sip this one. It proves to be quite sweet but the burn of alcohol in the finish mixed with a distant hop bitterness keeps it from being cloying. Creamy almost syrupy mouthfeel, thick body, light carbonation. I think I enjoyed this a lot more this time around. I have another bottle that I think will age for a while and revisit in a few years. My score reflects this most recent tasting."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" dark brown head above the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades gradually, with slow-falling lace. Aroma is roasty grain and alcohol, although more rubbing than ethyl. Taste follows the nose, with the alcohol component quite hot. Mouthfeel is a bit rough, and drinkability is okay, both affected by my perception of the booziness being over-the-top. If this was cranked back just a little on the abv, this would be so different, since the dark malt flavors abound and please. They just get shouted down here."
"Baltic Porter is my first high-gravity beer from Duck-Rabbit Craft Brewery. Even though it's at least as good as Brown Ale, Porter and Milk Stout, I expected more. Olfabrikken, Okocim and Sinebrychoff have nothing to worry about. However, if the brewers add more malt and can work on improving the mouthfeel, the Euros might get a little uneasy. This one has potential."
"What is a duck-rabbit? This one starts oily with roasted barley and coffee notes. Bitter dark chocolate leads to sweeter dark fruits, light vanilla, whiskey/bourbon oak, and peat. Herbal, bitter hops build quickly into the finish. Big coffee/dark chocolate/hop bitterness lasts along with warming bourbon-ish alcohol. Complex and delicious. Full bodied, with velvety smooth carbonation. Very nice."
"Very smooth and creamy,medium bodied. The kind of beer that leaves you craving more. Exceptional drinkability for a 9% beer. If you like baltic porters this is a must try beer. Another great beer fron Duck Rabbit deservingly worthy of being the dark beer specialists."
"Thanks to my friend hurleymanvw for picking me up this sixer. I like this beer although this is by far not my favorite beer style. I can appreciate it though. Very nice!"
"2007 bottling. Poured very dark brown. Light only gets through around the edges. Paper thin dark tan head that swirls around a bit and fades into a ring in less than a minute. Sweet and rich smell of dark fruits and licorice, but roasted maltiness is there as well. Taste is complex. Flavors dance around on your tongue and battle it out for dominance. It starts out similar to how it smells but leaves with a bitter chocolate taste. Lingering roasted barley and alcohol. Smooth mouthfeel and the 9% abv is fairly well covered. I could drink another one. I am holding onto several of these, as I can already see the aging doing wonders for this brew."
"I cant drink this again, not like this. I am hoping that the remaining bottles i have will change over time. I will hold on to them for 6-12 months and see if the flavor changes. i will revisit this one eventually to make sure of what im tasting, but i will not be in any hurry to do so."
"Pours a thick, sludge, black color that reminds me of draining the oil from my car. Creamy, thick brown head sits on top of this one only to slowly die down. With every swirl of the glass more head returns and builds. Smell is of coffee, caramel, toasted malt, doughy cookies, smells awesome. Taste is sweet and sugary with dried fruit, some molasses, bitter with creamy coffee notes. Sticky, and creamy mouthfeeling that makes you smack your lips with every sip. Absolutely awesome beer, glad I was able to try it!"
"Pours black with a deep tan head. Aromas of caramel, coffee, and small hints of alcohol. In the taste, a sweet roasty malt and a alcohol presence. A smooth, with a small bite in the mouthfeel, and a dry roasty malt aftertaste. A great porter, big in alcohol, yet nicely balanced."
"Had again four months later at Atlanta Ale meeting, also not sour but more chocolate here and thick mouthfeel. Coffee at end."
"It be some truly moby hooch."
"Pours out like motor oil with a thin mocha head that dies pretty quick. Smells of big chocolate, dried fruits, fig and molassas. Tastes as it smells. Delicious. Porter name is decieving as this is thick and big just like an RIS. Full in the mouth and silky smooth. Extremely drinkable and a damn delight to drink. Seek this one out."
"Had this one aging for a little over a year. The beer is black as coal and there is a thick brown head. The smell is chocolate and coffee. Tha taste is oatmeal, coffee, chocolate. There is a nice roasted taste to this brew. The mouthfeel is smooth, maybe a little too smooth for a brew that rings in at 9%. A nice malty treat to sip on. Another home run from the east side of the Tarheel State."
"12 oz bottle. The brew is deep deep deep brown in color with just small islands of head over top. There is a nice ring of tan head that is maintained by a nice stream of very fine bubbles. Clarity appears to be very good, but it is very dark and hard to see through. The aroma on this is sublime: chocolate and raisins abound, with a deeper molasses and even a bit of spicy anise playing in there as well. This one is beyond great smelling. The flavor is even better than expected. It starts with chocolate and light raisin. This makes a strong turn towards coffee and deep roast with chocolate melted in. The finish has a nice undertone of anise and coffee grounds. The sweet, fruity, roast notes all come together to make a fantastic beer. The mouthfeel is thick, almost a bit creamy as well, with a rather small to absent carbonation. Overall, I am enamored with this brew. I love how the coffee aspect of this one seems to just come out of nowhere in the flavor and then fall back behind the fruityness, with a crescendo back up on the tail. I also like how the coffee is not present in the aroma, and does a sneak attack in the flavor. There is absolutely no hint of the alcohol in this one anywhere, which makes this extremely dangerous in the long run. I have not had a beer this good in quite a while."
"This is absolutely amazing! It poured absolutely black with a medium brown coloured head. Even when held up directly to a light bulb, there is no light at all passing through; not even the edges. This looks fantastic by my standards. This even ""smells"" heavy with some very rich notes of thick, creamy chocolate, coffee beans, some dark fruit in the background, and a bit of lactic sourness. Lactic sourness is a bit more noticeable in the taste, along with a bit of booze, but not even close to what one would expect from a 9% brew. Rich, dark roasted grains and semi-sweet chocolate are also very detectable. Mouthfeel is wonderful. Very thick and heavy with a consistency nearly like warm maple syrup. A very, very solid beer. This is a wonderful representation of the style and an offering I will certainly seek out in the future. Thanks again Enola!"
"D: Excellent porter, loved the flavor and mouthfeel. Hoping to try this again next winter/spring once the next batch is released. Recommended, especially with some cellaring."
"Super creamy, full bodied brew. Lightly carbonated. This is one highly enjoyable beer, but for me one would be it for the day. I will look for this again next year when it returns."
"Pours a completely opaque black with a dark brown two finger head that quickly dies down to a thin lacing. Stickiness isn't really there. Smell is almost like an Old Ale. Powerful licorice dominates the scent with dark fruits joining. Molasses mixes into the nose as well as a tingle of alcohol. Taste is so sweet. Starts with a strong chocolate/caramel malt. Hops find themselves a bit in the middle while it finishes with a nice coffee long lasting flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy with subtle but noticable carbonation. I really like the dinkability of this, I didn't look at the abv until after I drank it. So for 9%, it does an amazing job. I'm still looking for the Wee Heavy!!"
"Opaque black color, it pours like high viscosity motor oil with an ample dark tan head. Some chocolate, coffeelike scents. Chocolate,caramel, espresso notes in the flavor with just enough of an understated hop presence. A little bit thinner in the mouth than an imperial stout but still smooth and silky. High gravity beers are what this brewery does best and this one is the best of those. A really great beer, one which easily stands along side any of the more famous Eastern European brands."
"Very dark in color-nice coffeish head on top. Nice aroma of burnt currants with a mild espresso backround. Great roasted flavor-has a burnt, thick viscuous flavor to it. Quite bready and yeasty. Dark, bitter chocolate flavors. Great body-very full but still quaffable. This is one of the few beers I find I am gulping it is so enjoyable-and trust me it slides right down. Great, great beer all around-very drinkable. I didnt know they bill themselves as ""dark beer specialists"". In this day and age thats a good thing to find one's niche. I am heading to NC in October and will be stocking up. RIP Perkuno-theres a new Duck-Rabbit in town."
"Pours a dark brown with slight froth. Smell is a little soft, not much going on there. Taste is roasted coffee and cocoa. It also has a sense of fruit going on that is pleasant. Mouthfeel is smooth but a tad too carbonated. This is a easy drinking beer that slightly shows the 9% abv. Its not very sessionable, after one, I think Ive had enough."
"Taste: Huge flavor and absolutely creamy mouthfeel, this is a real malt bomb with a side of chocolate slivers and a roasty finale like a well made expresso, with no residual harshness that you sometimes find even in some of the most classic examples of the style. I didn't find the alcohol very obtrusive, in fact it sort of only played a supportive role in what I thought was a great ensemble cast. Fantastic."
"*Sampled again at the 2007 Brewgrass Beer Festival. Still as great as ever, and still Duck-Rabbit's best!*"
"D - Good porter with a lot of different dark fruits."
"d - Stout 9% ABV is the only area of concern. Besides that, these are thoroughly enjoyable sip after sip!"
"Drinkability is great. This is an exceptional Baltic Porter. Smooth, sweet, biting, and very complex. This one stays on the want list."
"D: The big malty mouth is a very easy drink, sweet and smooth with an abundance of flavor. This beer is a sipper, but one that you'll enjoy every sip of."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a 1/2"" brown head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm burnt toffee scent along with some black malt aroma. The taste is good. It has a rich, black malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes smooth and a bit warm. It has an earthy, burnt toffee flavor that is quite enjoyable. There are loads of crystal malts here. The mouthfeel is great. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer with lots of flavor; an easy drink even at 9%."
"Mouthfeel is big, chewy and smooth. Good sturdy carbonation. This is really nice without becoming to heavy at any point and lends itself to easier drinking. A damn fine Baltic porter. I could probably only have two in a sitting, but I'd love to have this one again. Thanks to unclejedi for the chance to sample this one. I'm looking forward to the other Duck Rabbit brews I have yet to sample!"
"Bottle courtesy of Moejuck: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of coffee and roasted malt is dominant and enjoyable. Taste is dominated by dry coffee notes as well as some light bitter roasted malt. I was expecting more chocolate notes then I could detect and the beer was a bit more dry then expected. Body was quite full with some medium carbonation and no alcohol was discernable. Overall, while this was a very good beer I thought it was slightly too dry for the style and I cant figure out why this rated so high but again I am probably not the biggest fan of the style to begin with."
"Poured into a chalice a nice clean/clear black color, nice carbonation, nice litte tannish fizzy head, only a couple of islands left behind, no sticky lacing at all. The nose is of slightly roasted malts, plenty of toffee, chocolate, and caramel. The taste is of roasted malts, toffee, chocolate, slight vanilla, and caramel. There is a slight bitterness to this brew, with a nice slightly dry finish. Medium body, ABV is hidden pretty well. Very drinkable, I believe this is my first Baltic Porter, maybe not, but it is my first Duck-Rabbit brew, but I also have another bottle of this plus other Duck-Rabbit's. Thanks again Steve."
"This is an interesting beer, I don't know if I would want this on a regular basis, but it has certainly shown a mix / balance of flavors that are not usual for the darker American brews; it is almost something that I would characterize as a fresh English Imperial Stout. Too bad this is not bottle conditioned, it might have been quite interesting in 20 years. There is something about this beer that does not allow me to shake the idea that I am drinking burnt prune juice (of course an exaggeration, but still). In the end this is very interesting, even a bit education, definitely good, but still not quite something I would want a big bottle of (certainly the 12oz format is more than enough, even almost too much)."
"D: Loved this beer. Complex, tasty, and smooth. Duck Rabbit definitely know how to brew. Definitely on the Seek Again list."
"Mouth feel is milky smooth...appropriate carbonation."
"It is the best Baltic Porter I have ever had to date."
"Smooth mouthfeel on a medium body, minimal carbonation, incredibly mild for 9%."
"Oh, yes. Believe the hype. If I can get a keg of this beauty, I will. If not, I'll gladly take a case. Any takers on a trade? I'll be passing through Fayeteville in August of 2007."
"Where would a person be without good trades like this?"
"Wow, I think this is the best porter I have ever had in my life! Thanks go to nflmvp for the bottle. The color was a dark black but a little reddish at the edges where the light hits. The taste was a little sweet, malty and very close to the regular Duck-Rabbit porter. I savored every drop of this awesome brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a very creamy texture, and the drinkability is really good, but not quite outstanding due to the higher abv, and the flavors are so intense I would have a hard time drinking a second one."
"This beer is big, it's brute, it's complex, and I could drink it the rest of today, tomorrow, and this weekend."
"I'm very proud that this beer is from my home state."
"This is one delicious brew, the complexities in the flavor keep luring me back for more. If you're able to, get some without haste!"
"App - 4, Smell - 4, Taste - 4, Mouthfeel - 4.5, Drinkability - 3.5"
"D - The best porter I've ever had...I just can't drink more than one. Well, I probably could, but it's much more enjoyable when consumed in moderation ;-)"
"D---This is my first commercial Baltic porter but I have brewed the style before. I thought it was to style except it lacked a clean lager characteristic. I would like to try a few more commercial examples then go back to this and compare notes."
"drinkable (and tasty) beer!"
"Thanks Lhasa!"
"Drinkability: Exceptional for so dark and rich of a beer. Thanks again, ipa2xs!"
"Drinkability is great a big enjoyable beer. Sorry I missed this one but many thanks to Enola for sharing with me. Will be looking and hoping I can get some of this next time around."
"If only this was in my market. I would snatch up as much of this seasonal as I could to stock the beer cellar and enjoy during the cold winters in NH. Lucky folks down south!"
"Another winner from Duck-Rabbit. One of the best Baltic Porters on the planet here."
"Mil gracias a oberon para la oportunidad de probar esta ""cerveza oscura."" Best before June 2007. Served at cellar temperature in a 17-ounce snifter, Duck-Rabbit Baltic Porter pours as gorgeously as any of the best big stouts I've tried, all glisteningly pitch-colored with a huge, creamy mocha-froth head. Vinous dark berry and boozy raisin aromas. Many dark fruits appear in the flavor, with Bing cherry, prune juice, mashed currants, and blackberry being the most prominent among them. Overall, a largely vinous taste experience with a pleasant burnt-toast finish that lasts quite a long time as it rides out a noticeable alcohol sharpness in the aftertaste. Smooth-slick mouthfeel, with 9% abv readily apparent. This one seems spot-on for the style, and to top it off, it drinks like a dream. Highly recommended."
"12oz. bottle poured black with small brown head and a bit of lacing. Smell of malts and some kind of fruit. Taste is roasted malt, abit of sweetness to it, and some other flavors I'm having trouble picking up on.(mostly an acidic flavor I'm not used to) Mouth feel has a nice thickness to it. This brew is pretty easy to drink but is giving me one hard time in figuring out some weird but good flavors. I will visit this one again but mostly out of curiosity."
"This is a beer one should definitely try, it might have been a little too sweet for my liking, but still excellent..."
"A great sipping beer."
"Overall a pretty drinkable Baltic for me, definately has the typical traits of one but the darker toasted flavors that I like more are there too. Good beer...another solid offering from Duck-Rabbit."
"Just a fantastic beer. Pours a ruby highlighted dark brown with a tan head. Smell is a beautifully balanced roastiness, creaminess, touch of sour, and rich wineiness.Impressive. Taste is sublime- dark malt, winey complexity, super creamy, and a delicious tang. Hops on the finish as well.Just delicious and an impressive interpretation of the style. Very creamy mouthfeel with a great refreshing lactic sourness. Extremely drinkable."
"Tastes rich chocolate, some soured malt, coffee roast, and toffee/caramel. Wet sweet with a mild alcohol sting. Licorice and molasses and some cottony fuggle flavor. Astringency mixed with the sour in an unpleasant way. Aftertaste is less than desirable. Thick body and mild, but sharp carb. First sip was wonderful, but the taste bagan to wear pretty quickly."
"Wonderful wonderful beer."
"Pleasantly surprised by this one, I found the fruitiness to be almost irresistable; and the beer itself to be quite unique as Baltic porters are generally lagers, and fruitiness is limited. As expected, it poured an imperviable black body and frothy tan head. The retention was somewhat limited, but at 9% that's to be expected. Some nice rings of lace made up for that. The nose is rich and full, and you could easily while away a half hour or so just nosing it. Apart from the bright, juicy plum, it's also got notes of cherry and dark red berries. Beneath that a darkly toffeeish, coffee-accented maltiness rounds it out. Full-medium in body. Creamy smooth. Similar in flavor to the aroma, the fruitiness sings a siren-song that keeps you coming back sip after sip. A hint of chocolate appears, more low-key roastiness, caramel, and a spritz of alcohol; but based on my experience, a touch of alcohol is appropriate for the style. It doesn't appear particularly bitter, but it's there nonetheless, keeping watch and ready to dry the finish. Surprisingly, after such a massive flavor assault, it fades from the palate rather quickly... leaving you with no choice but to go back for another sip! I am most impressed!"
"D- Very good porter. I would buy it if they sold this here. Must be one of my favorite porters I have tried."
"Thanks to my buddy hoppedup for this NC treat,poured a deep ink black no light showing thru this puppy a 1/2 finger mocha colored head atop wich is gone quite fast leaving a glass of oil-like fluid.Rich aromas I pick up some bitter chocolate and definent molasses hints along with some dark fruit,wow what a nice full but easy mouthfeel pretty much perfection it glides effortlessly down but is full bodied.Molasses and raisin/prune like dark fruit flavors abound with underlying chocolate and roasted nut flavors a great lingering dryness comes out in the finish as I drink more.Another great brew to come outta NC there are many and this is near the top for me."
"Good ol blackie sent this to me in the NoBSBIF Beta. Appreshit again!"
"Overall impression: Well done but probably not for me. I don't like too much smoked flavor going on and there was a lot of that here. I don't think it was intentional but it was hard to get through. Still, after I got used to it I enjoyed it. Recommended."
"Turned out to be quite tasty, especially for a reviewer who is not a huge fan of baltic porters. Felt fairly smooth and a bit dry on the mouth, and went down well. Not something I could drink in succession, but a surprisingly good beer with which to start off the night."
"Drinkability - Drinkability is rather high for a brew of this alcohol content. Very deceiving. I could have a couple of these in an evening, although it would knock me completely on my ass. The perfect nightcap for the evening. Easily my favorite NC brewed beer."
"Shit, I'm overjoyed I had something this spectacular to drink!"
"D: Careful with this one...Abv goes completely masked. Extra silky and smooth makes this a wonderful sipping night cap beer. Very glad I got the chance to try this offering."
"Definitely my favorite offering from Duck Rabbit, but a great beer among many others they produce."
"Pours inky black with a small caramel colored head. Roasted malts mix with a nice boozy bourbon aroma, a rich sweet cola-y matiness also mixes nicely in the aroma. Roasted malts hit up front in the taste and then drop to the background as the sweet malts come forward. There is a nice tanginess in the finish that blends well with the strong sweetness. Medium to heavy in body, fairly thick with a tingle on the tongue and throat from the carbonation, finishes with a light dryness. Very good beer, the sweetness was somewhat cloying at times and strong for me, I'd like to see if a little age might thin that out. Nice aroma and excellent mouthfeel."
"Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for giving me the oppurtunity to sample this... great beer."
"Drinkability - I could have another."
"Flavor is strong but not overpowering. Actually fairly mellow for the style but still keeps the boldness necessary for a baltic porter. A fair amount of bitterness both in the flavor and the feel from the coffee tones. Hopes come through as a slight evergreen. Also picking out some dark chocoalte and overly ripe cherries (covered in chocolate, of course). Full bosy that really holds itself up throughout each pint. A dangerously drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The activity mellows over its course in the tulip, and in the mouth the beer is creamy and rich. It's a porter with one dominant goal... to be your next breakfast beverage."
"Taste is likewise, big, bold, and reminding me of cappucino. Alcohol is present but mostly well hidden. For 9%, it goes down very smooth. Mouthfeel is very mellow and free of carbonation. This whole concoction is outstandingly rich and creamy and probably about twelve hundred calories but worth it. This is craft brewing at its finest. Maybe the best beer ever produced in North Carolina. Get it before it's gone."
"This beer pours dark black with hints of deep amber with a decent froth tan head that dissipates to just a little film and laces well The smell is sweet chocolate malts and some alcohol hints of caramel and coffee are also present. The taste is wonderful tons of chocolate malts rounded out by caramel and cofee flavors. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with smooth carbonation. Overall a great Baltic porter."
"12oz brown bottle with a drink before date of 6/07. Pours a deep, deep dark brown with a one finger brown head and OK lace. Deep roasted malt aromas mixed with coffee, chocolate and slight wiffs of alcohol. Again deep roasted malt smells with lots of coffee, chocolate and slight raisin/plum. Sweet yet nicely balanced. Alcohol is present but easily pushed aside. Creamy and smooth. Very easy drinking cosidering it's 9%. A very nice beer."
"drinkability: good"
"I tried this one out after hearing such rave reviews on the forum. Poured by one of the Duck Rabbit staff at the Charlotte Oktoberfest, seemed like a nice guy. Though it wasn't in my top five that day, it was quite robust and enjoyable. Very dark with thick lacing."
"Though Baltic Porters aren't my favorite style, I enjoyed this beer. Great NC product that I'll probably buy a few more bottles of this season if I can find it."
"The more baltic porters I have, the more I like them. This one definitely affirms that."
"Well done...get it while you can!"
"Pretty good. Couldn't even tell the alcohol. Reminds me almost of some black lagers I've had."
"Poured totally black with a quarter inch tan head. Aroma reminded me of espresso coffee, roasted malts, burnt grain and ripe fruit. Nice. Taste was quite complex. Flavors of dark chocolate, coffee, licorice and tobacco combine with warming alcohol and bitter hops in the finish. Mouthfeel was full bodied and very rich on the palate. This is one assertive brew. Not a beer for wussies. Another winner from the dark beer specialists."
"An incredible beer! I hope the supply doesn't run out before I get some more! (It's already gone from taps, according to the waiter at the Flying Saucer in Raleigh.)"
"The aroma was an easy 5, and the flavor sooo close. A little better retention or some lacing would make the appearance perfect. The mouthfeel, just a touch more creamy. In my opinion, this one is miles ahead of the #1 BP, Flying Dog Gonzo."
"Second best baltic porter i've had to date, losing out to Southampton's. Not by much though."
"Overall this beer completely lived up to my high expectations. A bit rich for more than one at a time, but slow down and savor this one. Delicious. Don't pass it by if you see it on the shelves."
"Not a session beer by any stretch, but I loved every sip of this one."
"Pint at the Flying Saucer celebrating the Duck-Rabbit Second Anniversary."
