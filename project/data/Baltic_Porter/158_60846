Light smoke, light flavored dark malts and dark fruit. Finishes a bit dry. Subdued flavors. Tastes more like a lightly smoked English export stout to me.

3.55,-4.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Bottled on August 6, 2010! Served from bottle into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Poured a deep ruby red brown with a half finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and smoke. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoke, roasted malt, subtle dark chocolate, and cream. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. The smokiness on this one really made this brew stand out from other Baltic Porters I have tasted in the past. This added a nice complex, but definitely covered up a lot of the nice flavors that makes the Baltic Porter great to me. Still a fairly well done brew that I wouldn’t mind having again in the future.","thagr81us","Apr 09, 2012"

The smell was that of cocoa, coffee, and a hint of cinnamon, but sadly there was not much smoke smell. The taste confirmed that the smoked malt was all but drowned by the (very good) Baltic Porter flavors of chocolate, toffee, and roasted grains. There was a creamy finish with a touch of hops and some lactic acid sourness, and the aftertaste was somewhat spicy. As nice as it was, I kept wondering, ""where is the smoke?""","rajendra82","0"

3.65,-1.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a very dark brown coloring, with hazelnut highlights and a crystal clear look when held up to the light. There is a nice, fluffy, light, off-white head on the pour of about a half an inch, but that settles fairly quickly out into a sparse covering of foam. The aromas are rich and smooth, with a good smokey presence, some char and dark roasted coffee, meaty characteristics, and some dark chocolate highlights. Flavors are smooth and subtle, with some slick chocolate notes throughout. The dry body gives a sharpness to the smoke and char characteristics on the palate. There are also some very dark sweet fruit notes in the backbone, with some currant and plum present. The aftertaste is fairly nondescript, with some of the fruit and chocolate hinting around. The finish is slick and quick, with a slight drying feel to it. Decent brew, and light enough in body to drink in quantity. Would match up well with a hearty, rich, meaty meal.","GarthDanielson","Jan 17, 2012"

The aroma has an anticpated smoky malt sensation but there is something else that I cannot quite define. It may be the yeast but it makes me think of olive oil. The body is thin to medium. The taste is far superior to the aroma with a solid smoky maltiness and a lightly balance hop finish. Not bitter but not sweet. Somewhere in between.

4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"O. A style that's fairly new to me so I don't have much to compare it to. Strange to think of a porter as a lager, but that's what this is, and it works very well indeed. One more instance of how beer can be the world's most interesting and varied beverage.","omnigrits","Beers"

More smoke dammit! Malts have a fairly pleasant feel to them and are really neither overly roasty nor chocolaty. More of a honey-charred biscuit flavor. Its not too shabby, but its one of those beers where 1 bomber to try is enough to satisfy the curiosity. If it was in sixers for 8 or 9 bucks...yea, I would probably go there again; especially as a fan of the smoked porter style. Sometimes I dislike the bomber format, this beer is a prime example...21 bucks a sixer equivalent? No thanks.","twiggamortis420","0"

3.93,5.6,4.5,4,4,3,4,"Great Divide Smoked Baltic Porter is a dark brown/black ale with a caramel brown head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is pretty much just smoke. It's a dark smell with perhaps a touch of peat. Medium bodied, it seems a little flat at the beginning, but there's sharp carbonation at the finish, which is a little watery and silty. Dark caramel malt, burnt sugar and smoke give it a sort of dusty flavor with a warm, almost sweet, center. It leaves a sort of burnt cardboard flavor in my mouth, which makes me thirsty. There are notes of black currant, leather, hay and grass. Yeah, this is a pretty manly beer. Twenty-two ounces will grow your stubble at least a millimeter. if it were any any smokier, it'd be out of control, but it ends up tasting like iron, leather, dark wood and smoldering embers.

The back of my throat is feeling the way it gets after spending an evening around a smokey campfire. I've had other smoked porters which seemed much better balanced.

3.99,7.3,3,4,4,4.5,4,"Great Divide’s large, hulking beers have been a constant companion on my beer drinking journey. The Yeti beers boxed me around the ears when I was a beer nebbish, and the Baltic Smoked Porter is my most recent reminder of the excellence in Great Divide’s big bottle beers. The Baltic Smoked Porter is a real treat - from the beginning it is a rich, well balanced and uniquely delicious beer sporting some strange but attractive flavors. It’s a predictably dark beer, midnight black in the glass, crowned with a thick pumpkin orange and tan top. From this curious cap vents a delicious aroma, thick with barbecue smoke, the unctuous aroma of ham, a bite of cumin and the sweet but vegetable sugary taste of Japanese pumpkin, or kabocha. This Baltic Smoked Porter practically plugs the nose with its aroma. A light but creamy beer unrolls onto the palate, soft but stong enough to deliver the flavors. A light to moderate smokiness forms the backbone of the porter’s flavor, accented with a touch of hops in the aftertaste, and a well balanced porter quality that, notably, is not beaten down by the smoke flavors. Smoked beers can often find themselves suffering from a surfeit of suffocating smoke and even a kind of palate smog, but the Baltic Smoked Porter doesn’t suffer any of that. It is an excellent beer for delivering the promise of porter flavors paired with a dimension of smokiness - an incredibly drinkable beer, and another notch in the successes Great Divide has accumulated in their bomber beers.","GarrettB","Aug 26, 2011"

It eventually even picks up some light chocolate, in both sweet and bitter manners. It tastes of light, both sweet and bitter chocolate with a moderate amount of smoke and wood characteristics. It's pretty solid. It drinks somewhat light but is what should be expected for the style. Overall this is a pretty good smoked porter. I'm surprised it doesn't have better ratings.

Sweet and dark chocolates mix with dark fruits, black licorice, cocoa, more molasses and a huge hit of smokiness that envelops it all. Creamy in the middle, and a thinner than expected body leads to a straight medium mouth-feel. Has a woody edge on the throat, plenty of candy stickiness to the lips, and the alcohol is well-concealed.

Medium-bodied, the smokiness here is not sweet, more like wood smoke, kindling ash and charcoal. Over time you get more coffee grinds, bitter dark chocolate, hard caramel candy but never sweetens much. The carbonation is round and full, at time fluffy, a bit more of a presence than desirable. The fig, raisin, apricot, apple fruit sit in the corner most of the time. Overall, it's dry but not finding many distinct hoppy flavors. Oatmeal, scone and some straw accents.

3.65,-1.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5," D- This beer is a bit thin and the coffee malt really is the strongest flavor/aroma. The smoke is very light which is to bad because it is a nice hardwood, non-peat smoke that is very tasty. I don't think this beer has enough depth to age and there isn't any alcohol heat or big flavors that would settle with depth.","rhoadsrage","Oct 05, 2010"
4.32,16.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured almost black with brown highlights that had a half finger of brown head and left a little bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma on this beer is really nice to me cause I like smokiness which it had but was not so overpowering alongside chocolate malts, slight toffe and cofffe but faint hops as well. Like the nose smoke character was definitely there but it was really tasty and well balanced by the malts and chocolate toffee accents. On the back end it did have a touch of hop notes that were very subtle but there; great flavor on this one. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a slight sweet, silky, but smokey finish. It drank really good and always enjoy a good smoke beer. I wish brewers made more of these smokey offering. Good job great divide.","Gobzilla","Oct 03, 2010"

3.63,-2.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Black with brown highlights, this is what I'd expect for this beer. There's a dense, light brown head with good retention and lacing. The nose really reminds me of Surly's Smoke. Smoky with a very clean and neutral (almost neutered, if you ask me) yeast profile, there's some caramel, toasted bread, and water coffee. The palate opens with mild coffee, a little smoke and light cocoa. While clean, the lack of yeast expression is rather disappointing. Again, this could just be my lack of experience with the style, but the Olfabrikken Porter doesn't make me feel this way, I could see this being described as lightly fruity and almost butterscotch-like. Light in body with mild carbonation, the finish is fry with some roast and a touch of fruit. Solid stuff, but not something I'd pay the asking price for ($7/22oz?). However, as a free pour at the brewpub, i did quite enjoy it.","DefenCorps","Sep 25, 2010"
4.2,12.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D: After the underwhelming showing of Hibernation, I'm glad another new beer to the Southland from Great Divide, the Smoked Baltic Porter was stellar. Not nearly as good as Alaskan Smoked Porter, but this is a damn good beer.","Halcyondays","Sep 25, 2010"

3.95,6.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Appears a dark cola brown with a light beige head, fine speckled lacing forms. Aroma has a nice stong smoked malt character, hints of smoked meats and charred wood. Dark chocolate and roasted malts play nicely with a bit of dark fruit. Mellow dark chocolate malts and roasted hnt of coffee and ripened fruits noted. Smokey ballsy balanced smokiness. It works well, I will try to get some more of this stuff. Mouthfeel is easy going with the carbonatin and medium bodied, the smoke clears quite nicely from the palate. Drinkability wise this is a stand up version of two great styles kind of a hybrid Rauchbier/Baltic Porter. Definitely a nice brew, many rauchbier enthusiasts are going to want more smoke.","WVbeergeek","Sep 11, 2010"

3.85,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,4.5,"My struggle with this one is that they called it a Baltic porter and it doesn't stand up to most Baltic porters out there in terms of complexity and body.

4.22,13.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours an impenetrable black with a thin tan head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is really nice with a complex smokiness that is reminiscent of both smoked meat (like bacon) and wood smoke, along with some coffee and dark chocolate, molasses, burnt bread, some piney hops, a bit of dark fruit and alcohol. The flavor also starts off with an intense smokiness, with notes of bacon and smoked sausage along with alder wood and charcoal, some molasses, dark chocolate, coffee, plum and date, and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and appropriately light (this is a lager after all), and drinkability is excellent. A very nice baltic porter, with a complex smoke flavor and restrained fruitiness).","silver0rlead","Aug 17, 2010"

3.25,-12.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Flavor consists of some black plum, faint chocolate and distant smoke. The body is a bit thin which doesn't accentuate the flavors much. It lacks richness or depth or something. This is almost more like a dark, but light Rauchbier. I had this twice to make sure, and the body is thin. The feel isn't smooth, but it's not biting enough for the style methinks. The alcohol doesn't come into play and is a touch low for the style; according to BA. I'm glad I had this one first. If I had the Rumble first, this one would be overpowered.","Mebuzzard","0"
