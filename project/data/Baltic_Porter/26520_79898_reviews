"While this is an excellent beer, it's a bit better if the sweetness doesn't border oppressive.  There's excellent use of the barrel and some good complexity, though, and that is not to say it isn't fantastic."
"The barrel tastes of cheap bourbon or whiskey"
"Chocolate smooth and uncarbonated. Delicious. Mild chocolate strawberry. A mild bitter bite."
""
""
""
"Overall- Beautiful rich and creamy beer, with sweetness enhanced from the barrel aging. Bourbon notes are quite forward and boozy, but they really do compliment the underlying flavors rather than overpower. Lots of layers of complexity to the flavor profile, vanilla, chocolate, molasses, sugar, nuts, earthy qualities. Excellent beer to sip and enjoy."

"Nice and smooth, bourbon, chocolate and brown sugar. Very easy to drink"

"O. The best part of this beer is the way the coffee/nuts/coco flavors meld with the hops to create a porter that's packed with flavors, but not at all sweet. Highly recommended."

"T: Roasted, semi-charred coffee, possibly from barrelling. Prunes and plums, molasses-toffee. Licorice+balsam fir, very green and light grassy bitterness."

"Rich, intense chocolate and espresso flavors.Thick, heavy mouthfeel. Sweet and viscous. This is a huge beer, but one I can only take in small, limited qualities, like a sweet shot of espresso."
"Bottle as a ridiculous extra in trade. Big thanks! Pours dark brown from the bottle and settles essentially black and opaque in the glass with a small khaki brown head. Aroma is definite whiskey, caramel, vanilla, oak, some marshmallow. Flavor starts with dark fruits, chocolate covered raisins, whiskey, charred oak, long finish of char and vanilla. Pretty smooth but seemingly not a lot of rich flavor coming from the malts. Body is silky smooth, medium plus but perhaps not quite enough to handle the barrel, with low plus carbonation. Solid beer, but not sure I get all the hype I’ve heard about this and it’s variants. Certainly a good beer, but the bar is pretty high for BA stuff these days."

"O- Along with Shmaltz Brewing Co.'s Coney Island Barrel-Aged Blockhead (an Imperial Bock aged in Bourbon Barrels), this is one of the few barrel-aged lagers I am aware of (another being 'Baby Maker,' also from Jack's Abby). This is a massive beer that once again proves that Lager yeast can rightfully due the job of Ale yeast, producing a bombastic Baltic Porter (or better yet because of its roastiness, Russian Imperial Stout) aged in Bourbon Barrels creating a particularly satisfying result. The barrel-aging is significant and only enhances an already well made beer...think again BCBS and KBS! (4.75)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Boozy and strong in the vein of BCBS, though slightly more subdued. Heavy and sweet bourbon taste balance out the dark roasted malts. The barrel aging works wonders for the already amazing Framinghammer. If you like barrel aged dark beers, this is highly recommended if you can get your hands on it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly recommend."
""
"O: terrific beer for what it is. Do not expect a monster thick, heavy bourbon flavored stout. This is a porter, it is more approachable, more drinkable and more subtle in all its flavors and smells."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- Pretty good. A little sweeter than I like. Prefer the style to have more roast and nutty character."

"O - I've had limited experience with bourbon barrel aging, so I liked that the bourbon characteristics didn't seem too overpowering. The alcohol, too, was a little bit more present than I would like. I much prefer the basic Framinghammer."
""
""
""
""
"O: Loved this. Cellared this one a little longer than my last bottle, and it payed off. Little to no boozines, and while not incredibly potent flavor-wise, extremely well balanced and easy drinking for the ABV. Nice work JA!"
""
""
""
""
"Thanks, cp45, for the opportunity"
""
""
""
""
"I'm a fan of this one. It really hits on the bourbon flavors. The only knock is that it could use more heft in the body."
""
"Was somewhat disappointed with BA Framinghammer. Lacked body, flavor, and complexity. The flavors didn't go well together. I'll re-rate if I get another bottle and it's better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very bourbon-foward beer. I'd like to say how much you like this beer will depend on how much you like bourbon, but I don't really think that is the case. Bourbon isn't sweet, but this beer is quite sweet. Bourbon isn't chocolatey, but this beer is. In the end, its a good beer, but not at all mind-blowing."
""
""
""
""
"O-solid BA Baltic Porter, easy drinking in spite of the ABV"

"4/4/3.75/3.75/4"
"Great beer - excellent barrel rendition of the phenomenal base."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a wonderfully complex beer. one of the most balanced and well done straight bourbon stout/porters I have had in a while. lots of bold alcohol and bourbon but never overpowering or astringent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Probably my second favorite barrel-aged dark beer after KBS. The bourbon flavor is present, but by no means dominates the beer. Jack's Abby has really asserted itself as an East Coast brewing artist, and this beer clearly shows the lofty heights of their craft."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Quite boozy but enjoyable too. Where did that nuttiness come from? Strange but enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black in color with a small tan head. The head dissipates almost immediately and cannot be revived, even with a swirl of the glass. The beer sticks to the side of the glass, a common feature I've noticed in many bourbon barrel aged beers. Great aroma, dominated by bourbon, with notes of vanilla, dark chocolate, and brown sugar. The taste follows suit. Full-bodied, yet surprisingly drinkable despite how boozy it is. The bourbon is up front and on your face, which is ok with me but should be noted regardless.  I did get tired of this beer towards the end. Very smooth but really hurts from the lack of carbonation. Add those fizzy bubbles in and this is a winner. Without them, it's still tasty, but just falls a little flat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Tasty porter right here, right up with my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, typically I don’t get as excited by barrel-aging as most but this one beer where I noticed a huge improvement over the regular version."
"Verdict: gotta go with this being an excellent beer. Not sure if its the artistry or the lager yeast or what, but these Jack's Abby beers are lapping drinkable. Not a bad defining characteristic to have if you're a brewery. Looking forward to the other two Jacks' beers in the fridge!"
""
""
"My favorite beer to date! This is just how I like my stouts and porters. This beer was mostly chocolaty up front with hints of dark fruit. You could taste the oak barrels throughout. The aftertaste was an incredibly pleasant coconut flavor that left me wanting more. It was mildly carbonated and had a very creamy mouth feel, but not to the point of being too thick. This is a must try!"
""
""
""
"O- really liked the bourbon/vanilla notes, drinks pretty easy for 10%, I enjoyed this much more than the coffee version"
""
""
""
""
"O- I well done BA Baltic. I like that I got to taste a well done version of this"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Can't wait to get a six pack and age this for 6 months and try again. This beer is a must try."
""
""
"A great drinking beer that is really benefited by the barrels with a balanced complexity."

"i love jack abby, and its beers like this that make them one of the most unique breweries in the country. taking lager to new heights, this is special, and in some ways i like it better than the vanilla edition. it still has a ton of vanilla to it, just naturally and from the barrel, there really is not much need for additional vanilla. matte black brown in color, thick, but still holding on to a pretty solid off white head, almost grey really. the nose is rich in vanilla notes and dark barley, with earthy mineral density, but very little of the bitterness we normally associate with dark brews like this. the oak from the barrel is there, and the sweetness of the bourbon penetrates the beer a bit too. bakers chocolate and lager yeast are there too, but much more in flavor than smell. vanilla and chocolate up front, but the only real sugar in this appears to be from the bourbon. musty woodiness is picked up on by the lager yeast in the finish, giving this beer a very unique character that is both rich and complex, yet also sort of light and drinkable, certainly for what it is. lots of body through, and a longer finish than i remember on most lagers, but still rather clean for its size. the flavors here are just perfectly proportioned, not too much of anything, still grain first, but peppered in are all kinds of little twists, making this a bottle to be shared and considered carefully. very very well done, i am very keen to try the other incarnations of this now. this has to be the best american made baltic porter out there. if it isnt, enlighten me, but i would be surprised!"

"Taste is sweet darkness to start, lactic and dark fruits in the middle, a peek of coconut, and then smooths out with some alcohol warmth to the close. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is easy. Nice nuances here, but liked the base brew better."
"Again, looks like Framinghammer - very dark with ruby highlights, tan/brown cap with lacing and good head retention. Slight booze and wood on top of the base beer, chocolate and malt for the most part, cocoa and roast. Nice flavour -- sweetness blends with the mild boozy alcohol and bitterness, chocolate and malt sit just underneath, a bit nutty, woody tannins follow through in the finish. Mild astringency, full bodied, moderate carbonation, not as creamy as the other Framinghammers I've had, but still quite smooth. Quite enjoyable and very drinkable for a barrel aged beer. I'd definitely pick this up again."
""
"M: not as thick as some bb stouts with a nice silkiness"
""
""
"Shared a bottle with my lady and in hindsight I have a hint of regret for sharing. This beer looks good, dark brown with mahogany edges, tan had that recedes after a minute or so, solid legs as one would expect from a 10% beer. Aroma of black malt, anise, toffee, and pit fruit. Taste has bourbon out front with a solid anise and a bit of blackberry. Rich mouthfeel with a sweetness that is not cloying and little to no bitterness. Very good beer, but a bit pricy at $8. Would like to see this some day in 4 packs."
""
""
""
"Overall a real treat. Hides the ABV truly well. Reminiscent of some other lower abv barrel aged beers such as Velvet Merkin. The oats and brown sugar are what make this feel more like a light stout than a Baltic Porter. Creamy, rich, and smooth! Paired with bourbon barrel aged maple syrup drizzled bacon. Fantastic food/beer combo."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a very enjoyable beer to drink. The bourbon element is pleasant but ultimately a little underwhelming. The mouthfeel is great, and a nice differentiation from the BBAIS genre. As a whole this beer might not be mindblowing, but it is a nice change of pace in the BBA world and shows a great deal of craftsmanship."
""

"2014 vintage served in my DFH Signature glass. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a frothy, quarter-inch, khaki-colored head. Head eventually dissipates into an oily swirl. Some lacing is present but exhibits poor retention. Nose expresses dark fruits, ethanol, vanilla and a suggestion of the barrel. Taste is amazing! Rich cocoa, vanilla and buttery elements nicely co-mingle with the dark fruit and wood revealed in the nose. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a mild, even carbonation and a texture that falls just shy of creamy. This beer is nothing short of spectacular and is only surpassed by the draft offering. Jack's Abby is killing it with pretty much everything they put out. Prosit!"
"Who knew a lager-only brewery could make something like this? Baltic porters are a great style, and JA's barrel aging here works wonders. A delight to drink."
""
""
"O: Fundamentally, this tastes like bourbon was poured into a porter. The aroma is nice, but the taste is a bit one dimensional. This feels pretty light bodied and drinkable given the ~10% ABV, so that’s a plus."
""
"Really nice! Not as great as it was hyped to be imho, but has a great balance and smooth flavors overall. I'd grab this again for sure. Nothing ground breaking, but very well done indeed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This is a phenomenal beer. I actually didn't have huge expectations for it, but I want more now. The first Jacks Abbey beer to really wow me."

"Thanks MJ0126 for these great beers! Pours pitch black with a thick mocha head that dissipates quickly. Minimal lacing. Lots of dark fruit on the nose along with vanilla, bourbon, chocolate and coffee. Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and brown sugar on the palate. Most complex and outstanding! Velvety smooth on the tongue, medium bodied with low carbonation contribute to the velvety mouthfeel. Overall, this is an extremely drinkable Baltic Porter, great work Jack's Abby."
"This is an excellent beer - a great porter to begin with, and the barrel-aging just takes it a step beyond."

"O- My first experience with a barrel aged beer. Jacks Abby continues to impress. Would like to see how the beer changes and look forward to trying the other varients."
"Overall this beer exceeded my expectations. It hits on all the great parts a BA porter has. I'm a huge bourbon fan so this is damn near as good as Goose Island BCBS. The more I sip it, the more I want. I definite think if you can get this, get it and savor it's amazing flavors."
""
"Another home-run by a brewery that is quickly becoming my favorite. Love this one. There are some nights where I want the barrel aged stout/porter flavors but not something quite as intense as a BCBS - this is where BA Framinghammer comes into play. AWESOME! Glad I have a few bottles in the cellar to see what some age does to these, though it will be tough to not drink them now!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This is pretty solid. It's a little barrel heavy maybe, but that's is excusable, and it lacks a touch up front, but besides that, this is a solid barrel aged strong porter. Something worth checking out if you get the chance. Thanks again Masterski. Enjoyed this one."
""
""
"O: Such a great beer that it makes this review boring. It was hard to describe but such a pleasure to drink. super mellow, huge flavor, great complexity. For the style, it's absolutely incredible."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is unexpectedly lovely. It comes close to the line of a bourbon bomb (especially as it warms), but it never actually crosses it. It's a nice mix of chocolate and bourbon with a nice pinch of Jack's Abby goodness. I can't say I've had many barrel-aged Baltic Porters, but I can say that this is better than a lot of barrel-aged stouts I had. Or maybe I'm becoming less jaded with bourbon barrel aging in general (which seems unlikely)."
""
"Pours a clear brown with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, wood, and slight bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great bourbon barrel aged presence that is slightly better in the taste."

"Served alongside the bourbon barrel aged with vanilla beans version. The beer is nearly black with an inch of mocha colored head. Nice aroma, featuring bourbon, oak, chocolate. Very tasty and quite smooth on the palate. Very tasty, though not as wonderful as the version with vanilla beans. Fairly low carbonation with alcohol content well hidden. A delightful beer to sip."

"Black in color, but looks more like cola when swished around in the glass. Two fingers worth of head on the pour with decent lacing as you drink it. I smell brown sugar and chocolate, vanilla, with some hops present as well. Taste is sweet with a slight bitterness at the end which balances it out nicely. Bittersweet chocolate, some bourbon is noticeable but doesn’t take over the entire beer. It has a nice chewy quality to it, smooth and creamy on the palate. Overall this is a very well crafted beer – not hugely complex, but it is very well balanced. Very drinkable for its 10% abv."

"Thanks Huddyball, for the opportunity to try this gem!"
""
"O – One of the better BA beers I’ve had in a while. A very solid base beer gets only better with the barrel in this case. Complex and well nuanced – potent but not overpowering bourbon addition…no problem identifying this as a BA beer, but unlike so many, the barrel only complements the base and doesn’t steal the show. Bourbon gives a bit more bite and calms the sweet aspects of the beer while the vanilla’y oak character really smoothes this out and adds to its drinkability."
""
"Overall - Pleasantly surprised by this. Not the best barrel, but it seems like a really good beer behind it."
""
"D - Nice beer that drinks a lot lighter than the listed 10% - more like a 7-8% beer actually. This is in the middle of the variants for me; between the vanilla and coffee versions in flavor integration and enjoyment."

"O: One of the best baltic porters I've ever had, even without the wonderful barrel aging attributes that the barrel provides. Surprisingly not hot at 10% plus the BB, which makes this all too easy to drink. A little pricier than most JA offerings I've seen, but that is expected. Awesome brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is excellent beer, featuring almost everything one could want from a barrel-aged Porter, and in fact the flavors in here are so nice that they show up many barrel-aged Imperial Stouts. But perhaps the best thing of all is the price: for a world-class beer, my .5 liter bottle was only $5.95, making this just about the best buy I’ve ever had."
""
""
"o - Overall I thought this was a great BBA porter; while it is 10% it is not hot at all, and feels like less. The bourbon doesn't dominate the beer, but it is definitely there, especially in the nose as it warms up. More than the other two, this one improves greatly as it warms up, and has a lot more milk and sweet chocolate to it. Overall I have this very close to the coffee version in terms of how much I liked it, giving coffee the slight edge, and with both behind the vanilla version. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the three, and think people's favorite will just depend on whether they like vanilla, coffee, or chocolate the best. Would love to have it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is tremendous stuff. Thank you Bob!!"
"Low B"
""
"T: A good amount of sweetness upfront. Vanilla, brownies, bourbon and some dark chocolate. The middle pulls the sweetness back a bit and brings some charred wood, burnt coffee grounds and a touch of booze. Finishes is just a touch astringent with some dark chocolate and maybe a touch of anise. Mouthfeel is lush and velvety. There's not a lot I would change about this beer. It's fantastic."
""
""
"I am usually impressed by Jack's Abby's beers, but this one was a big disappointment. The beer was thin in both flavor and texture and seemed quite rough around the edges. Perhaps some age would help round this out."
""
""
""
"Drink- A very good barrel aged porter. I enjoyed the flavors. Jacks Abby does it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a homerun and while I found the non-BA version to be enjoyable, this is definitely a case of the barrel improving the original."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is half way to an amazing brew. It drinks almost like a BA stout, but the booze taste is just a little too dominant. The aroma is intoxicating, but it comes up short in the flavor as its so bourbon forward. Good, but just not great."
"Overall: Excellent offering from Jack's Abby, delicious for all the reasons mentioned above. One of the best porters I've ever tasted."
""
"Overall: Jack's Abbey makes some of the best beer coming out of Massachusetts and this is right up there with the best that they brew. Very complex, oaky, and chocolaty, without ever being too overpowering in any area. I would certainly get this one again."
"O-Excellent Baltic Porter, probably in the top 3 best BP that I have had. Flavors are balanced perfectly and the bourbon is present but not overpowering."
"Overall this is quite good, especially for the price, and if you like a good balance between porter/stout flavors and bourbon barrels you are sure to enjoy this. It is a little on the simple side, I think I was expecting a bit more, but not too much to complain about."

"The beer pours an inky black with a nice had of medium sized, khaki bubbles that settle down at about a half a finger’s width, which is surprising given the beer’s 10% ABV and the fact that it was barrel aged. In body, this beer is impenetrable to the eye, and the beer’s head leaves a curtain of lacing full of slippery, small bubbles on the sides of the glass. On the nose, the beer smells of roasted black coffee and big boozy malt with touches of vanilla bourbon and slight hint of bitter hops and oak. The bourbon isn’t huge in the nose, but it is nice and blends well with the malt of the beer. On the tongue, the beer tastes boozy-bourbon sweet with just a touch of bitter roast and some slight acidic bites. In flavor, this beer speaks of booze, bourbon, and roasted malts. The flavor begins as sweet roasted malt with a touch of chocolate and honey, but this builds into practically cloying boozy bourbon with hints of vanilla and coconut, and a very strong touch of alcohol. The finish is bourbon sweet and full of boozy heat as it runs down the throat, and the aftertaste is slightly sticky sweet with lingering bourbon, coffee and chocolate, but also with alcohol hot in the deep back of the throat. In the mouth, the beer feels smooth and velvety with just a faint bite from the carbonation. It is on the light side of heavy in body and definitely carries a clean lager feel in the mouth. Where a stout of this size would have considerable grip and a chewiness, this beer is silky smooth, almost like a fine hot chocolate in feel. The mouth is, however, left sticky and wet with a lingering heat burn from the alcohol. This beer is most certainly a sipper, in case anyone was overlooking its 10% ABV. Overall, this is a good beer. It’s really a nice sipper, and is probably prime to drink in the early winter when you are looking for a bit of a warmth from your drink. Having just had 2012’s BCBS the other day, I can actually say that there is a similarity between the two, though not definitive. Framinghammer is definitely of lager stock with a beautiful and smooth mouthfeel that helps the drinkability of this beer, and it is also about 5% less in alcohol than BCBS, but it carries a nice bourbon heat and some nice bourbon flavors mixed in with thick malty flavors similar to BCBS. Personally, I would advise sitting on a bottle of this a little bit to let the booze settle down and so that it is winter, but that would probably kill some of the bourbon flavors. Right now I’m not craving the boozy beers, but I would certainly revisit this beer come late fall/early winter and I would certainly sip it in front of a fire. It is a good beer, and fantastically cheap for a bourbon barrel-aged beer. Jack’s Abby has got another great thing here, and I can’t wait to try the coffee version of this beer."
"Wow glad I got my hands on some. superbly drinkable and delicious"

"O - Vanilla, chocolate and coffee with some roasted malt-perfection! This may be the best Lager I have ever had. Now if I can only get ahold of the Vanilla and Coffee versions."
""
"O: A good beer overall. The nose doesn't have quite the depth that the flavor has, but it's still very enjoyable with a nice mixture of barrel and Baltic porter characteristics."
""
""
"M: good malt and bourbon up front, very hot finish"
""
""
"O: This is a bourbon drinker's beer through and through. It may come off a bit strongly to those who don't normally partake. Not the most complex beer of its kind, but there's a lot to like about it."
""

"Pour is oily black with a dark tan head. The nose is big and rich with a roasty with light charred wood, rich dark chocolate and cake batter. Taste is strong caramel, rich chocolate cake and light charred barrel. Dry finish, creamy body and soft palate."

"A great beer, just under world class overall I'd say. Not the best thing I've had from Jack's Abby, but something I would happily drink again."
""
""
"Overall: This beer was even more impressive than the ABCS had before it. Delicious."
"Wow! What the hell is this thing? It's damn delicious is what it is. Sweet bourbon notes up front with decadent chocolate malts runs into oaky barrel notes and finishes suprisngly bright and fruity. Huge thick body rolls over the tongue nicely. How did they get these deep bourbon barrel flavors to mesh with this bright fruity finish. One of the best beers i've ever had! 10%? Where? I think it may have to do with where they got the bourbon barrels from as the bourbon flavor is unlike anything i've ever had."

"I had this beer last year at the first anniversary party. I like this year's Baltic porter even more. Last year, I thought the beer was excellent and looked forward to it. This year, there is an added complexity, more bourbon-vanilla character. My balloon glass brought out the tasting notes to their fullest."

"O: Its a good, good Baltic, one of my favorites. No reason not to try this if you can get it."

"Poured out as a nice black color with a thin light brown head on top. The retention is thin, there is also a bit of scattered lacing. The smell of the beer gives off a good amount of barrel aged aromas. There is a subtle wooden vanilla aroma along with some roasted malt and chocolate on the nose. The taste is slightly spicy, it's males sense knowing they used Jim Beam barrels. The vanilla notes and roasted malts wok well together. The mouthfeel is smooth, good carbonation and very drinkable for 10%. Overall it's a great brew, really worth trying."

"M: Full bodied. Creamy. Nice mouthfeel here."
"O: Great Cold weather brew, very strong dark flavors and would pair excellent post meal or with dessert. A bit overwhelming in flavor so I'd suggest sharing. Can be sipped like a whiskey or congnac. Drinks like an RIS but a bit cleaner due to lager yeast. Wasn't quite as mind blowing as I had hoped, but far from disappointing. Given price I would opt for the non barrel aged version."
"o - overall, paint me impressed. i'm a big fan of porters and baltic porters, but when you stick them in a barrel it really brings it all together. this one is aged just right and really has such lush flavors. another fine beer from jack's abby. this is a brewery to watch if you aren't already sold."
""
"Overall, a really great barrel aged porter for an incredible price. The barrel presence is really well integrated and doesn't overpower the base beer at all. Really nice balance of dark chocolate roast and sweet caramel and dark fruit character. Definitely a great addition to Jack's Abby regular lineup."

"I've been raving about JA hoppy beers but hot damn this is good stuff."
"O - Overall this beer is pretty awesome and I would recommend it to any who enjoys the style and can get there hands on some. I had to go to the brewery and I'm out I. Western Mass."
""
""
""
"O: Though I was not that impressed with the smell and look of this beer the taste and feel are really something special. This beer manages to maintain a solid porter base that is noticeably lagered more so then others but perhaps thats just because I know it is a Jack's Abby brew. That being said the chocolate flavors that are enhanced with the bourbon barrel aging really add to this beer that is drinkable and noticeable of its 10% abv. Within the style this definitely the best barrel aged porter I have tasted its up there with some quality BA stouts in terms of taste and feel so as with pretty much every Jack's Abby beer I recommend this."
""
"O-Had a tad too much candied sugar as the beer warmed, which threw off the balance. Still a great beer."
""
"Mouthfeel is really the only thing that wasn't mind blowing. Pretty thin overall, almost feels like a baltic porter that was cut with a shot of bourbon to thin it out. Earthy, spicy and a little hot at the end. Carbonation is pretty much on point though. Overall pretty good, just not stellar like the rest of it. Still pretty drinkable and overall another well done beer by Jack's Abby."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one hell of a baltic porter. It has to be the smoothest drinking 10% ABV barrel-aged porter ever. Wonderful variety of flavors with great balance to boot. Nice contrast of ultra sweet dessert up front, turning a bit bitter and acrid and drying in the finish. Goes down very easily. Too easily. Excellently crafted, as always."

"O: Wow, definitely happy to have had a bottle of this. Killer stuff, world class for sure. First non-lager I've had from Jack's Abby but they nailed it on the head. Just a great, great beer. Treat to have, would love to have it again."

"Overall very nice, a great barrel aged stout that tastes like a dark chocolate oatmeal cookie with whisky infused. Great beer, very well done. Now I see why everyone was really pushing me to drink this, as I think I will add more to the cellar now before it's all gone. Now I REALLY can't wait for the vanilla and coffee versions!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Not quite a beer you would drink after work everyday, but pretty damn close. Incredibly smooth for 10% ABV and not a single component overpowers another. Very well balanced, even with the prominent barrel characteristics."

"O - This is a very delicious beer. I know Baltic porters tend to warp the line between ales and lagers, but I adore anything that Jack's Abby does and this is no exception. The fact that they are experimenting with barrels now is just too awesome. Plus the $6 price tag is super reasonable."

"Just opened the bottle poured into my Hill Farmstead stemmed glass. Nice brownish head about one finger thick, from a pour down the middle of the glass. Color is very dark black no light shining through this beer. On the nose picking up a lot of chocolate (which I like on my Baltics) maybe some of the bourbon but not much. Head stays strong as it slowly recedes down the sides of the glass. First sip and there is the bourbon, not overpowering but definitely asserting itself. Wow nice flavors as the beer coats your tongue with dark porter flavors the bourbon comes in at the back of your tongue. Mouthfeel is a good silky coating of the tongue. I really like this beer Jack's Abby knocked it out of the park for me on this a very drinkable right now barrel aged beer."
""
"Very good beer. Complex, drinkable (for 10%), and well balanced, a very good effort by this brewer."
""
"Overall an amazing beer. The best bourbon barrel aged RIS/Baltic Porter I've ever had. No I haven't had the pleasure of trying some of the more famous hyped BA beers, but I would be extremely surprised if they were much better than this."
""
"I really tried to be objective here. Jack's Abby just keeps hitting home runs. This brew can easily stand with the best of the barrel aged porters and stouts."
"O - Overall, this is a damn good bourbon aged porter. Glad I have a few more as this is crazy drinkable. Yeah, need to buy more."
"O/D-Another stunner by Jack's Abby. One of the better brews I have had recently. One of their top beers easily. Epic and for under $5 dollars. I need more, many more."
""
""
""
""
"O- Well, my first 5 given out for any field of the beer, this beer is very close to being perfect. I can't imagine how aging will improve this, so I will probably drink more of my stash sooner rather than later. For $6 per .5L, this beer can't be beat price wise."

"Overall- I genuinely love this beer. I'm so broke my girlfriend and I split a single appetizer while we were there but I couldn't help but buy a second glass of this. This beer seriously holds it's own, even against the heavy-hitting barrel aged stouts. I hope they make more"
""

"The pour is black in color with minimal head formation. Starts off with some bourbon notes (wood, vanilla, etc.), followed by lots of roasted malt and dark chocolate. A light fruitiness in the background. The palate also features the bourbon nicely along with some notes of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. Fairly simple and straight forward, but really nice."
"O- This was a very good BA porter, however I'm not sure if it exactly lives up the hype it has been receiving. It was definitely very flavorful, complex, smooth, and well balanced. It definitely can stand up to other top-notch BA porters and is surprisingly good for a brewery that just celebrated their 1-year anniversary. I would definitely like to revisit this beer in December when they start bottling it. The beer definitely showed some nice well-balanced bourbon characteristics however it might have lost some of it's presence sitting in a keg for a few months, I'd be interested to try it fresh."

"Awesome stuff. World class."

"O: I really enjoyed this beer. Jack's Abby is really cranking out great beers and this one is no exception. Tried a few premium Stouts and Porters last night (Year old GI's Bourbon County Coffee, Kate the Great, and a year old KBS! thanks wdarcy77) and this one was just as enjoyable. Try this beer, it's great."
"This is a beautiful beer and I'm honored to have had the chance to try it!"
""
"A special beer, that’s for sure. I can only wonder what the future holds for this one. Who knows where this beer and it’s following can go. I’ll get more if it’s available. It’s really quite awesome."
"Maybe one of the best sipping beers I have ever had. This is where I think the rest in this style miss the boat with over the top representations of the style. Just a great sipping beer. Almost a reverse order in taste profile. Booze in front and not in the finish. Leaves you WANTING another sip, not BRAVING another sip."
"This is it, this is the real thing. Seriously… OH MY GOD THIS BEER IS AMAZING!! I’ve been a fan of JA for months now and stop by the brewery whenever they have a new beer. I have become somewhat of a fan-boy, and really enjoyed the original Framinghammer, but this bourbon barrel aging just takes it to another level. I mean seriously, this beer can hold it’s own any day with the best bourbon stouts or porters out there. I’d go as far as to say this is actually BETTER than Founders KBS or Goose Islands Bourbon Stout. Wow. The bourbon aging was like the missing ingredient to perfect this beer. If they can get this in bottles I wouldn’t be surprised if it sits permanently near the top of the BA 100. Try this beer NOW!!"
