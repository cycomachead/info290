"M - Low carb.  Oily.  Slightly numbing alcohol tingle in the finish."

"An interesting take on a super imperial stout."

"One of a large number of samples I had at the Extreme Beer Fest in Boston 3/21/32014. Smooth rich chocolatey porter, nice."

"Overall- very simple and straight forward.  Very well hidden booze, behind tart bitter dark fruit and a bourbony finish.  Simple and to the point. A great lager offering.  I would expect no less from Jack's Abby."

""
"Pours a dark brown and settles into the glass with a very dark brown body, with some lighter brown at the top. Tan head that fades quickly leaving a thin ring of bubbles. Aroma is sweet, sugary bourbon, caramel, roasted malts and cocoa. Flavor is much of the same, with the roasted malts and cocoa coming through more. Roasted malts, sugary bourbon and lots of boozy heat. Feel is very syrupy, with low carbonation and a potent alcohol burn. A solid barrel-aged porter, but I expected a little more after how much I enjoyed bride maker."

"Overall: Not sure how the alcohol taste is hidden so well in a beer that clocks in at 15% ABV.....the sweet, rich notes defeat any alcohol aside from the warming feel of the bourbon. An absolute treat, especially in the dead of winter. Satisfying, surprising, and yummy!"
""
"Huge lacing. Mocha colored head that disappeared very fast. Big barrel smell, oak, vanilla. Tastes along the same lines of BA Framinghammer, but ramped up and smoother at the same time. Not tasting the alcohol, but do feel the heat in my chest. Dry, oaky finish. Not as much sweetness add you'd expect from a 15% beer. Very impressed."

"This was the first beer from JA that disappointed me.   Extremely boozy (as can be expected from a 15% beer) with almost no barrel character.  The mouth feel was very thin for the style.  Will probably benefit from cellar time."
""
"Overall an awesome brew, should definitely seek out and enjoy with only the best of friends"
"Jack's Abby has really impressed with their darker, bigger beers. Lager Ness Monster is just another in a line of big ABV beers that drinks big, with a complex flavor profile that is complemented by an exquisite feel. Definitely worth trying."

"Bottle. Pours a clear, dark brown color. Not much head here. The color of the thin cut of foam is tan. Not much lacing. First sniff, holy hell, this one is a bourbony, alcohol-dripping monster (pun!). Lots of bourbon barrel character. Big, rushing malty sweetness. Almost smells like a liqueur. Roast, brown sugar and sweet syrup. The flavor strikes with a brash, continuous trio of alcohol, oak, and sweetness. Irish coffee, burnt caramel, cooked brown sugar, more and more oak, liquor-soaked dark fruit. A mean brew! Hot and oily feel. Lingering barrel flavor. I had a large sample pour of this one and I think that was the perfect amount. It's big and bold but its power didn't necessarily translate to pleasure in my mind."

"Tons of Booze heat!  barrel vanilla and oak flavors, good roasty flavors. Ok!"

"Lager Ness Monster is in enormous beer that reminds me a lot more of a barrel-aged American strong ale than a typical Baltic porter. This definitely has potential but is far too boozy when fresh. I would love to revisit this in a year or two and see how it evolves."
""
""
"O- Completely underwhelming.  I'm very disappointed in myself for trading for this.  The drinkability is very high due to the thin body, lack of flavor, and little alcohol presence, but for a 15% barrel aged ""Imperial Baltic Porter"" I expected MUCH more. I am extremely unimpressed."

"Good god, this beer will come up and kick you square in the butt. Quite a strong beer, this is a sipping beer, period. I had a taste of this beer mixed with Fire in the Ham, it made both beers much more drinkable combined."

"Flat black with no head. Aroma of chocolate, coffee, nutty grain. Medium bodied, creamy. Flavor of coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, Roast malt. Hot slightly medicinal finish. Lingering chocolate when gone."
""
"Overall: This is a very interesting, whiskey-dominant Baltic porter. An extraordinary beer to just sit and sip on a cold winter evening. (4.5)"
""

"Tried a sample at the brewery as I purchased 8 bottles.  Taste is balanced....  sweet, just enough bitterness to balance out the sweetness, a bit roasty, and absolutely bursting with Bourbon flavor.  The alcohol was extremely well hidden.  This one tastes great, but it would probably be even more amazing in a year."
