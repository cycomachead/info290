"Pairs WELL with a spicy Indian dish!"
"I'm pretty sure I have had this a few times by now and held off thinking I would get it again for the review. The time is now and my high expectations are satisfied by the great balance of deep chocolate and toasty brown things."

"A flavorful porter that's really easy to drink. And drink. And drink."

"Overall - Really smooth and it has a nice high quality chocolate flavour. The light fruitiness work really well with rest of the flavours. A great beer that I should have bought more of when I had the chance."

"Pours a black color. 5/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, alcohol, slight chocolate, slight hops, and a hint of wood. Much more like a strong American Porter than a Baltic Porter. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight oatmeal, slight roasted malt, slight hop, alcohol, chocolate, and a hint of sourness. Overall, good appearance, aroma, blend, and body, but the feel is lacking."

"O: Great drinkability. Excellent beer. Extremely well-done. Scandinavian classic"
"Overall: I'm a Porter fan and I really like this variance on the style. The 7% ABV isn't noticeable, and the light carbonation combined with the sweet flavors make it highly drinkable. Best porter I've had in Singapore!"
""
""
""
"Quite an enjoyable porter. Rich and dry with a very rounded balanced profile that is so silky. Quite a bit of depth but also very tasty upfront with pleasant dchocolate notes. It is big but it is not heavy, as in a big imp stout. Worth trying, quite a tasty achievement!"

"O: Easy to drink with enough complexity to keep it interesting - I could easily have another one of these and enjoy it even though it is more of a slow sipper."
""
"O/D - Potential infection for this bottle as something seemed a bit off, but it that was off, then this beer is pretty solid. Decent flavours and well executed, but not highly drinkable. A good effort nonetheless."
""
"On bottle.Complex and strong porter style.High body with a medium brown head.Little carbonation.Very dark.Smel, choklat, coffe and roasted malts.Flavor with roasted malts again and delicius choklat.More near than Imperial style, really a old style.Great beer"

"A pleasurable enough version of the style, amped up to near imperial ABV levels, but you'd hardly know otherwise. Tasty, chocolatey, subtly milky, and offset by a perky fruitiness. Old World meet newish-Old World interpretation. Cool, I suppose."
""
""
""
"I had very high expectations for this one after falling in love with some of these guys dark monsters, respectable beer but I doubt I'd buy another when it's beside their Imperial Stout on the shelf"
""
""
""
""
"M - Medium body with moderate to high carbonation."
"Thick but not stout thick. The hops give a crisp quality that gives it more of a porter feel."
""
""
""
"Overall: feel like potential is there, and maybe something happened in transport to cause the negative attributes of the beer; it does get better in the end, but never great"

"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Very dark brown, almost black pour with a one and a half finger caramel colored head with decent retention and great lacing. Earthy roastiness in the nose with a subtle sweetness along with hints of dark chocolate, coffee, and a touch of vanilla. The taste follows suit with lots of sweet roasty malt and coffee/espresso up front, followed by hints of dark chocolate, toffee, vanilla, and just a touch of figs and licorice. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with very little carbonation and a real nice balance between the sweet malts and bitter hops. Overall this is a very rich and drinkable Porter. An excellent example of the style and yet another winner from Nøgne Ø."
""
""
"After the first taste I had lots of chocolate and espresso. As I kept drinking the molasses came through. Wonderful beer and I'm glad I was able to try cause its drinking very well now."
""
"Nearly jet black, 1.5 fingers of tan hed, thick with lots of lace. Smell is tons of roasted malts follwed by lots of dark chocolate, well hopped, coffee and light liquorice as well, more bittersweet chocolate and a hint of smoke/char. Taste is initially big and roasty, lots of malt with some milk and dark chocolate, medium hop bitterness, black liquorice with a roasty-coffee finish. Medium carbonation, prickly, medium body. Really solid porter, the only way this would be better is if it had a more robust feel to match the big robust flavours, something I would gladly revisit."
""
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 4.2, a very respectable A-. Nøgne Ø's Porter is considerably more creative than the name implies. At 7% I'm more inclined to consider this a lighter 'imperial porter' than a true English porter, but I'm not about to split hairs over it - the point to take home here is that this is a balanced, fairly complex dark ale with a delicious bittersweet flavour profile that I absolutely loved. A fabulous brew that is well worth sampling, and a great way to strike Norway from my aptly-named 'countries to sample beer from' list."

"(4.0) D: A very tasty porter that showcases good fruit flavours and solid herbal qualities, and one I would pick up again."
"Picks right up where the imperial stout left off last year. Very dependable porter, highly enjoyable."
"Overall, a very nice porter. Good stuff."
""
""
"When I give it good, quick thought - it tastes like an extra-chocolaty, sweeter, less-boozy Baltic Porter - straight up. Pretty solid. Nothing remarkable. I could see trying this again though."
""
""
""
"O: I knew I'd like this beer - I've been diggin' on Fuller's London Porter and also a fan of Founder's Porter (though that's not an English porter) - if you like either of the aforementioned, this is a winner. Of course they're all porters, so they have similar profiles, but none of them taste like the others. This was a crisp, almost American black ale-tasting porter - but sweeter and creamier than an ABA."
"Very nice porter but if they labeled it as a stout I'd believe them."
""
"A fantastic, if not one of my new favorite english porters."
""
""
""
""
"O: I was blown away by the intricacies of the flavors in this porter. Underrated in my opinion, this Norwegian brew delivers."
""
"O: This porter goes down very easily but has enough interesting flavors to make it a beer that you can sip and savor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely worth a try and comes highly recommended."
""
"Let this one warm up a bit. The full flavor/armoma isn't apparent until ~50 degrees."
""
""
""
""
"O: The perfect porter? Very traditional and very tasty. If you like porters, you must drink this. Still, my biggest complaint is that, even though this is an excellent archetypal porter, it's a tad boring/straightforward. Considering the price, I might not have again."
""
"O: This is a fairly mild, round beer, with a hint of carbonation zing on the tongue and a slightly astringent finish. If it were anyone else's, I'd call it pretty well done. Quality and no complaints. Compared to other Nogne O brews, however, it does not deliver the same sense of art. They set the bar pretty high. So I guess I'll have to give this a lowly ""very good""."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good Porter. Not my favorite, but up there. Could drink this all the time."
""
""
"Very pleasant aftertaste, slightly malty and slightly less sweet than the initial taste"
"500 ml bottle, no bottle date. Pours very dark brown color with a small 1 finger dense tan head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. A fair amount of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big caramel, roasted malt, bread, molasses, chocolate, and some dark fruits. Nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, chocolate, roasted malt, toasted bread, light coffee, molasses, and a bit of dark fruits. Light amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toast, and molasses on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice and creamy mouthfeel that drinks very easily. No alcohol noticed other than a slight warming on the finish. Overall this is a very nice and well rounded porter with robust flavor and good balance."

"O - quite good; less robust than anticipated; creaminess is a little off-putting"
""
"O - A rich, complex porter that is highly drinkable for its 7% abv."
""
"The feel of this beer is complex but smooth as it goes down with ease and has a silky aftertaste that is more enjoyable then a lot of Porters I have had. This one is one of the better ones."
"A very dark almost midnight beer with a large tan head. Aromas of chocolate syrup, with hints of vanilla and maple. The first sip is full of dark chocolate, roasted malt, with a slight bitterness that passes quickly. Had it at the Good Life in Massapequa."
"overall a decent porter but nothing that unique or unexpected."
"It’s absolutely not a bad beer, actually its quite nice, but then again definitely not as good as I expected especially in relation to the WBC silver medal in the Robust Porter category."
"There's really nothing to complain about here. It's a very nice dark, roasty, robust porter. We get Nøgne Ø here, but I haven't seen this. If it's as pricey as the rest, it's going to be disappointing to pass on this more times than not due to price."
"On the light side of the style, almost plain porter, and hops push it American. Much-feted Grimstad water makes for a lovely body. Very drinkable yet interesting (which is not to say deep or complex) enough to hold the attention."
"Pours a dark black with a large and bubbly dark brown head. Aroma is sweet and has hints of coffee, dark malts, and chocolate. The flavor is slightly sweet, with brown sugar, molasses, dark fruits, dark malts, and coffee. The coffee gets stronger on the finish. Very smooth beer."
"D: Quite quaffable, if it wasn't for the $10 price tag, I'd keep these on hand."
"Finish: Soft and flavorful. a plethora of flavors make themselves evident. A great porter may be one of the best."
"Taste - It's balanced full feeling the right ABV I could not have drawn it up any better"
"Poured a hazy dark brown, with a nice finger of tan head, and noticeable sediment in the glass. Roasty malt aroma, dark chocolate. More of the same in the taste, with big roastiness, malts and coffee notes, dark chocolate, and tar. Full-bodied, almost stout enough to be...a stout. A bit heavy, but still a quaffable brew."
"O- i find myself enjoying this more than i expected to, which is always a plus. i went into this with little to no expectation. i wouldnt hesitate to try this again."
"Yeah, theres a bit of a foggy haze as I drink this, quite hot for a porter. It's so pleasant and balanced though, so I just don't care."
"Overall a very nice porter. Too expensive to buy regularly, but I'm glad I tried it will certainly buy it again at some point."
"Men's Health listed this one as a top 25 beer in the world. It's certainly a solid representative of the Porter style with an unmistakable chocolate malt presence. This is the sort of beer you'd want to have on hand in case you mention dark beer to someone and they say ""like Guinness?"" Promptly you can respond, ""well, like this!"" Pour them a glass- they will thank you for the enlightenment."
"D: This is a great porter and is so easy to drink; hats of to Nogne--this is good"
"O - Nice flavor and body."
"D: Overall pretty meh. It was good but not memorable. Flavors are pretty good but the mouth could use some work."
"Drinkabilty - What a pleasure to drink. Easy on mouth and a real treat to drink. I pounded down the 16.9 oz bottle and loved each drink. Im very impressed with this brewery so far. Any porter fan needs to seek this out. Taddy porter fans and even oatmeal stout fans really should try this. If it was 5-6% id probily would have gave it a 5 on drinkabilty."
"A subtle, easy-to-drink example of the style, but with a unique twist. A superb porter!"
"An excellent porter, and a true flagship for this outstanding brewery. Dangerously drinkable at 7%..."
"Overall: Overall its a good beer. Didnt blow me away like I was hoping, but definitly worth a try."
"Taste is rich and delicious with lots super roasty toasty barley and dark bitter chocolate flavors that come out even more when it warms. Feel is super smooth and silky with just a little carbonation. Super drinakble and fresh."
"D - This is a very respectable porter and I recommend it."
"A mellow, soft porter."
"Very impressed with this...can't wait to try more from this brewery."
"Highly recommended!"
"500ml bottle enjoyed at Chancey Smith's in London, Ontario. Pours pitch black in colour with two fingers of frothy, mocha tan head and sheets of lacing on the pint glass. Smell and taste are dark chocolate, black coffee, barley, espresso beans, rich roasted malts, a hint of smoke, dried fruits, some sweetness, port wine, and a bold hop bitterness. As the beer warms the fruit and port flavours give off a slight tartness towards the end. Mouthfeel is fuller than medium, creamy and oily middle, prickly carbonation, spicy and astringently bitter finish with a chalky, cocoa powder aftertaste. Exactly what I want from a porter. In terms of drinkability, this beer is much thicker and more robust than others in the style, as it took me nearly an hour to finish the bottle. So it's not as quaffable as I thought it would be. But that's a minor quip - this is still a marvellously complex and warming ale that I plan to sip on frequently as the cooler fall and winter months approach."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability is good, it had some very nice flavors to it and it was a very good version of the style. The chocolaty flavors were particularly nice and made for a nice beer to sip on this evening."
"This beer came with its mind made up: it was going to be stout and substantial, focus in on one or two really key flavours and be sure to keep all contributing elements in check. You gotta love its resoluteness. There's nothing like drinking a beer that is undauntedly flavourful, deliberately brazen and exactingly well-built. To and through, this is fine porter."
"Served on tap in a standard pint glass at TJ's. This beer poured a very dark brown/black with a mocha head which dissaptes completely. Lacing is ample and lasting. Nose is chocolate, caramel, malts, and dark fruits. Taste is sweeter with dark chocolate, roasted coffee, licorace and some dark fruits. Hops add some citrus and a welcome bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium with decent carbonation. FInish is a little sticky but not unpleasantly so. All-in-all, this was a nice offering I would try again for sure."
"Mouthfeel is full bodied, roasty, chewy, and a tad boozy."
"eh. went down rather well. would give a second shot. tasty."
"This was an OK porter, I would not turn one down, however, I would not go out of my way to buy."
"taste is of malt, cocoa, a little fresh roasted coffee, some fruit in the back, and a touch of caramel, ends on the dry side."
"Drinkability: As with Korean cuisine, I'm likin' it, but I'm just not lovin' it. Still, I'd say give it a try, as most everyone else seems to be diggin' it."
"really liked this one. would buy again. I'm still unclear of the line between porter and stout...this seems to push the boundry. I'd like to see a little less sweet."
"Have to say I'm slightly let down by this. It's decent, but if I want a porter Edmund Fitzgerald is still my go to... glad I tried this one though."
"Beer is medium to light in body and has a decent amount of smoke in there. Mild carbonation on the palate and finishes with some coffee and a minimal chocolate bitterness. Overall the beer is easy drinking and smooth."
"I've passed on this brew a number of times, so I figured, while I was at CK, I might as well finally try this guy out. He pours an opaque black brown headed by a finger of dark khaki foam. The smell comprises dark, roasted malts, coffee, vodka, spruce, and pine. It's as though a thicker version of a baltic porter was roasted a bit more than normal. The taste is identical, though, just to be different (those crazy Norwegian liquids!), a firm touch of bitterness is added. It's interesting, I'll give 'em that. The body is a hefty medium, with light carbonation and a sticky feel. Overall, a solid porter, but a bit of a let-down. Maybe, after all of the passes, I'd built it up a bit mentally, but, either way, I'm not all that impressed...though my thirst has indeed been slaked."
"D - would be great with a meal as the flavor is good yet mild enough to not overpower the flavor of the food. The mildness make it not worth drinking alone though."
"Pours a nice , deep dark brown color with firm cap of khaki head, leaving decent lacing. Scent if of molasses, charred grain, roasted nuts and some earthy qualities. Taste brings a moderate amount of molasses along with toffee and roasted nuts, hints of chocolate and medium roast coffee and hints of cherry. The background is a nice fresh grain profile, found in many of Nogne's beers. Interesting floral hoppy profile dances around. Fuller side of medium bodied, a touch high level of carbonation. A good porter with a lot of freshness to it."
"Pretty drinkable and enjoyable, I'd get it again."
"D: For a 7% porter I'd say it has good drinkability. Tastes great, feels good on the tongue. The appearance and the smell are the only things that bring this down. I'd drink it again if we had it in Tx."
"This is very drinkable. Would have been rated higher if not for the sour smell. As is, this rocketed to the top of my porter list!"
"D- Moderately high. A very tasty beer, the price and availability may limit how often I revisit this one but"
"I saw this on sale for $8 when it had been $10 so I bought it despite the fact that it still was a pretty bad deal for a 500ml bottle of porter. It was black of course and smelled a little roasty but also a tinge of metallic so I knocked the score down. The taste was nice, sweet, roasty, pretty good. I will of course never buy a second bottle because it is just to expensive but this was a pretty good American porter with a robust flavor."
"Pretty much dead on for my mental picture of a strong porter. Great chalky roast character that, for me, is the signature of the style. Dark, bitter chocolate combines with bready malt, light caramel and mild English yeast. Relatively big bitter citric hops push through, despite the relatively low IBU count and at least four or five months of age on the bottle. There's a licorice flavor in there, too - no idea what that's from. Dry flavor. The beer looks great. It's black with a big head, creamy and light brown. Mouthfeel could be a touch fuller, but it's quite good. Excellent porter with great bitterness."
"Medium-bodied, medium effervescence and medium dryness. Somewhat tingly on the tongue. Pretty good. Interesting idea for a Scandinavian brewery to emulate an American style instead of the reverse."
"While the abv clocks in at 7%, which in my experience is on the higher end of the spectrum for a porter, I did not experience any noticeable taste of alcohol. I could definitely enjoy a couple of these waiting for the weather to warm in Norway. Very drinkable and satisfying porter."
"1 PT .9 FL OZ bottle served in my SA Sensory Pint. Poured the color of cola with a root beer float-like head both in color and consistency. Nose is malty, brown sugar/molasses and a little metallic - perhaps some oxidation. Taste consistent with nose, however, a roasted character and a little bit of cocoa comes forth. Metallic quality subsides as the carbonation breaks down. I also get a little bit of creaminess as well, maybe some lactose. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an assertive carbonation level. Pretty tasty brew for the most part. Maybe slightly on the decline, but I scored the bottle for $4.99 and thinks it's fairly priced at that."
"I was quickly tiring of my 500ml bottle.."
"D: Nice example of the style, but the winter porter is much better."
"Nøgne Ø Porter is a dim, dark brown ale with a thin, dense, beige head that leaves excellent lacing on the glass. It smells dark and complex, with a lot of roasty coffee. It's medium bodied, smooth and clean in the mouth. It's not sweet. The flavor is well balanced and roasty like coffee. There are notes of dark chocolate and cassis. For some reason, I was expecting a Baltic Porter, but this is more bitter and complex. This is a delicious beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice sessionable porter to drink for a long time."
"The 7.0%abv is nowhere to be found in this glass. This would be a great session porter. Too bad it's not available to me, locally."
"Overall I was a bit underwhelmed when I first smelled the beer but once I tasted it I was thoroughly whelmed. This one is worth a shot."
"Nothing really blows me away about this beer, but I do respect Nogne O and wouldn't be surprised if it was better fresh in Europe. I appreciate the bottle conditioning, homebrew feel it has."
"It pours a dark, opaque sable with a VERY thick, if not too persistent, light brown head. The bottle I got foamed like nobody's business, so be careful if you have this in a bottle! Aroma is rich, smoky, mocha-like with a hint of sweetness, very inviting. Flavor is like fine roast coffee with chocolate undertones, but it got a bit tinny as I got near the bottom of the bottle. Texture is smooth and fairly tingly. Satisfying."
"This beer pours black in color with a thick foamy head that has a brownish beige color to it. Grainy nose of wheat and raw barley. The attack reveals some grainy hints as well. It is very different for a porter and I must admit I find the grain heavy character to be a bit out of place for the style. There is a decent malt presence. Very little hops presenting itself openly. The mouthfeel is decent. Really the only part of the flavor that is speaking to me is the rawness of the grain flavor. It is not a bad thing, but I just don't really know what to think about a porter that lacks the characteristics I am accustomed to. There is a nice sweetness about the finish. It has a light body about it. I am appreciative that my wife brought this back for us to enjoy, thankfully she thinks its wonderful. . . for me its just okay."
"the beer is well carbonated and smooth with a very decent drinkability, hindered only by by its flavor."
"J"
"This beer pours a jet black/brown colour that lets no light thru at all it is averagely carbonated and leaves a nice half finger cappicino laced head that dissapears as fast as it appears to leave a nice semi haze of oil slick head floating in the middle of the glass,it has nice aromas of blackcurrants,blackberries,malt liquor and coffee/chocolate,the taste is very nice with hints of blackcurrants and subtle chocolate/coffee notes at the end that leaves you with such a moreish taste you just want more and forget this is 7.0% the mouthfeel is very nice indeed i really like it just right for this style,this is probably one of the best examples of this style ive reviewed so far and will make sure this beer stays in my collection in future."
"D: With the heavy body/mouthful I could prob only drink one bomber of this. This it a beer that's good for drinking with a nice burger or steak and savor the roasty complexity of the beer."
"Smooth full mouthfeel and an easy drinkability given a nice moderate body. Surely worth a try."
"-Oelergud"
"A very enjoyable porter. Very smooth, and slightly complex. Nice roasty flavors mixed with a bit of coffee and chocolate. Recommended."
"The beer pours a pitch black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, earthy black malt scent with hints of chocolate and coffee. The taste is good. It has a very dry, roasted character with loads of black malt flavor. There is a bit of chocolate and caramel in the finish, but it's primarily a dry coffee experience. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with too much carbonation. This is a good porter, but nothing I'm too excited about."
"This beer pouts a deep dark bown, tan one finger head that is well retained. Sheets of thick lacing coat the side of the glass the entire way down. Nose is of roasted malts, dark chocolate, caramel and a touch of coffee. Taste is of caramel and toffee upfront, leading in to the dark chocolate and roasted malts. Finishes with burnt coffee. This is a medium bodied beer, with slightly higher carbonation - though it didn't detract from the beer. It goes down very easily, nice creamy feel to the mouth with a bit of a dry finish. This is another great beer from Nogne."
"D: This beer looks great, smells great and tastes....average. I'm not sure what happened in the journey from aroma to taste, but a lot got lost along the way. If the flavor of this beer matched the setup, this would be an outstanding porter. Unfortunately it doesn't, so it simply rates an above average."
"A strikingly clean and well attenuated Porter with low-lying sweetness and ultimate maltiness. Malts show a great malty, bready flavor and aroma with a heavy focus on the roasted malts that nearly shove the beer into Stout proportions. The opaque dark brown beer holds a fantastic head and laces very well as the beer fades. Deep French Roast coffee flavor is mixed with light campfire-like notes and really make the beer taste like Stouts, even down to the dry and ashy texture. Hop aromas give a nice fresh pine aroma, taste, while supplying a firm bitterness without the thread of any rising sweetness. Quite dry and clean throughout. This Porter definately takes an Americanized twist on things and definately does not show the milk chocolate or caramel sweetness that is usually found in English style Porters!"
"D: This one I'm rating against the style as opposed to pure personal opinion. This is a great example of a porter but it doesn't stand out."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: Very drinkable. I love dark beers, and this one doesn't disappoint me."
"D: All in all a very good beer. Combining it with a piece or two of dark chocolate makes it even more delightful. Chocolate is truly a perfect companion to this one, but make sure a quality beer is accompanied by some dark quality chocolate."
"D: drinkability is right up their with the best. What I really love is the strong malty profile and explosive flavors that drench the tongue. Incredible showing for a porter! How do they pack so much flavor in a slim bottle?"
"Poured a very dark brown. Slight frothy head. Incredible amount of chocolate, and a good, smooth, creamy mouthfeel. This isn't an over the top porter, but I think it's one of the best I've had. Well balanced, and easy drinking. Enjoyed every ounce of it. Definitely worth seeking out."
"The body is a little thin and fizzy for the style. Flavor mimics the nose except for a lingering coffee roastiness. There isn't a lot of depth and really lacks the creaminess of the elite porters. Not a great example of the style, but worth a try."
"This beer is fairly smooth which makes it an easy drinker. Though it came in a larger bottle, I didn't find it difficult to finish the bottle. Nice roasted characteristics come through in the flavor, but I wasn't overly impressed with the flavor on this one. There was a tangy sour-like note in the finish that was a little disappointing. Could taste some of the dark fruits in there as well, but overall, just fell a little short of my ""expectations..."" Whatever those are. Not that bad, but not the greatest. Still, I recommend you try it for yourself."
"One finger head comprised of bubbles so large you think you hear them popping, cream brown in color, below there's a slight brown touch to the basically black hued liquid. Smells like a chocolate cake with chocolate icing while served with hot chocolate, lots of, say, chocolate. Toffee, ice cream scents follow that along with dates, plums, cooked oatmeal, overall more slow roasted than toasty or smoky. In the mouth it has a great deal of density yet still comes across as medium-bodied, the carbonation vibrates through the liquid to prevent full congealing. The dark bittersweet chocolate here matched more evenly by espresso bean, toffee and general maltiness. There's a nice mineral or spring water freshness below which evokes something like lemon peel or forest pine. Constructed in a subtle style which mandates a good deal of concentration to catch the nuances, nothing obvious here. OK, maybe the chocolate. Very clean finish, resets the palate for the next sip."
"drinkability that word is an understatement with the brew just an excellent porter"
"Porter fans should really enjoy this dark liquid jewel from Norway."
"Very delicious!"
"Overall, I was very impressed with this offering from Nogne. It was one of the best porters that I've tasted. I will continue to buy this one. Highly recommended."
"This was an outstanding porter that I wasn't expecting to be this good at all. A perfect blending of flavors, this is my new standard. Despite the high price tag of their beers, I will pick one up if I see it around. Highly recommended."
"Dark brown pour with a solid tan head arising. Roasty and earthy in scent and flavor, just a hint of mocha. Great in the mouth and smooth going down. Lingers nicely a bit, but clean. Side note, Scandanavian porters are the best, close second English, then US."
"Pours a nice deep brown with a short-lived tan head and nice lacing. Licorice, earthy yeast, roasted malt, chocolate, smoke, and toast in the nose. Taste is bittersweet chocolate, burnt coffee, leather, dates, and a mix of toffee, caramel, hops, and cream. Some of that soy taste as well. Kind of thin in the mouthfeel. A very good beer, nonetheless."
"The taste of the beer is very strong, but not in an ABV sense, just flavorful, with strong roasted, but not charred malts, coffee, mocha, cherry chocolate, raspberry, and maybe some other heavy fruits. The beer is extremely creamy, very smooth, and a nice after dinner accompaniment. The beer has at least five different malts that add layers of complexity to the taste, and just enough hop presence to make the beer come to life in the finish. The mouthfeel is modest, carbonation is quite low, but not flat, and the aftertaste is very good. The ABV is very well hidden underneath. This is a delightful beer worth venturing for. L'Chaim."
"D: This is a drinkable and interesting beer, despite some odd traits with the taste. Worth a look."
"A good porter. Not my favorite of the style, but would recommend and drink this again."
"Bottle from Bruisin' Ales in Asheville... $5 for a 22 oz... I wish I had bought more. That is a steal for this hard to find beer. Pours oily black (looks like a stout, this is black, not brown beer. Minimal head, with soft cascading lace... flavor is HUGE porter... great roasted quality, a bit of sour like a baltic, but not enough to even put that in the forefront. I will seek this one out again."
"One hell of a porter, surprisingly drinkable at 7.0%. Sampled while listening to Emperor, Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk, another fantastic work of art from Norway."
"D - Strangely enough, the Norwegians have made a porter that should be a benchmark for others wishing to brew this style. As good as any British porter I've tried. Unfortunately, the $8.99 price tag limts my consumption of this to an occasional treat."
"Pours a blackish body with a two-finger tan head that stuck around for awhile and left a lace ring down the glass. Heavy malt smell, like coffee, roasted and some chocolate. Hints of sweetness and fruit from the hops. A medium to full body, this beer has a smooth creaminess to it. Sweet malts like chocolate and caramel prevelant, and so are some roasted and coffee malts. Finishes with a dry twinge but there is also a little fruitiness in this porter. A good, solid porter that I could have again anytime."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied, very rich and smooth. A very intersting mix of hops and malts in this porter."
"drinkability: high"
"D: This is a well balanced and beer that is full flavored. It is a great session beer for a porter in part due to its wonderful flavors, decent mouthfeel and great balance."
"Nothing bad to say about this brew, for sure. Fine and roasty, Nogne's Porter is on the full and creamy side of medium-bodied with superb carbonation and drinkability."
"I'm not the biggest fan of the style (I usually like my darker beers to be lightly-hopped) but this might be the best porter I've ever had. My first beer from Nøgne Ø and it's a winner. I will be trying more from their line of beers for sure."
"Getting through a bomber of this is a pleasure. I could see this as a go-to beer if it were locally available."
"drinkability is great. this is a very manageable 7% APV brew, with a rich profile and solid proportioning. an excellent porter. cheers!"
"Sample courtesy of piscator- very rich pouring brew with minimal tan coloured head. Nose- lots of roast and dark chocolate. Taste- dry, little smoky, good roast and medium bodied. Mouthfeel is smooth. Carbonation is on low side which improves drinkability."
"Bottle served at Monks. If I had to sum up this beer in 4 words it would be ""porter brewed with hops"". Appearance wise it looks like a standard good porter - nice deep brown with a tan head. Nice dark fruit and coffee aromas, but the taste has a fairly strong flavor of the sort of hops you'd normally only see in a decent IPA. Nice creamy smooth mouthful besides that, but it really enjoy it you would have to be a fan of hoppy beers."
"I really enjoyed this beer. A lot of flavors and nicely presented. One of these bottles is enough in a night but I will be seeking this brew out in the future. The ABV is high enough to not make this sessionable for myself."
"Pours black with an off-white head that leaves some okay lacing and sticks around as a thin ring. Nice roasty aromas- not too strong and a good bit of dark fruit here as well. Aubtle, slightly rich and fairly dry. The same thing is going on with the taste. Smooth, balanced, some dark fruity, nice roast flavors, and a good hit of dry European style licorice. Delicious. Mouthfeel is very smooth and quite dry making this easy to keep drinking. No palate fatigue here, but enough going on to keep you interested."
"16.9 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both very good. The aroma is chocolate, coffee, brown sugar and caramel malt. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also molasses and a smoky taste to this brew. Good mix of sweet and bitter in the taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium with low/medium carbonation. It's also rich, creamy and extremely smooth which makes this beer very easy to drink. The 7% ABV isn't noticable at all. This is easily one of the best porters I've had in a while. It's a very good all around brew, I'd definitely recommend this to others and also buy it again the next time I find it."
"Damn drinkable porter, very tasty without being overpowering or impossible to take longs sips from. Awesome take on an American style from Norway."
"I appreciate that they list the ingredients - combined with the Nordic water, they have made an outstanding example of a Porter."
"The nose on the beer has a chocolate hint with slight bits of spices. The beer is quite thick, and less carbonated than I expected. The bitterness from the beer is from the coffee flavours with a small bit of hops. There is a nice subtle taste of chocolate that comes to the pallet towards the beginning of the drink.The beer also has a nice sweet taste, which I can't figure out what it is. Quite a drinkable beer as well, and I'd definitely get this again."
"A good scorer on the nite, but fairly different from all other brews."
"A solid porter, but not my favorite."
"D- I dont think i would ever turn this beer down again. Very impressed with this porter. A great sunday evening beer with barbeque or just a cool evening."
"Dark Pour, decent twix color head. Smells like chocolate cake, roasted caramel, and raisinated with yeast. Dark creamy mouthfeel of chocolate balanced by a slight bitter of hops. Cocoa throughout it all, and this is a true porter. The surprise is the amount of hops on the finish, really puts a fresh touch to the dark style of a porter. I like it! Sweetness that is balanced, thats rare"
"M/D: Very nice mouthfeel, low carbonation, a little creamy, full bodied. Drinkability is fine as well. A very good porter."
"Drinkability- Id have several of these, very nice, if your rich."
"Pours a nice dark brown/black color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tannish head, which left some nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty, nice tones of coffee/toffee, and caramel. The taste is just awesome for a porter, malty, nice coffee/toffee notes, and some caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very tasty porter, one of the best I've had, highly recommended. I have a few more from Nogne, glad to see a very good one from the get go."
"Poured into a tulip, this was a jet black beer with a coffee-colored head. A little bit of lacing. Predominately coffee aroma, with a little bit of sweetness. Coffee taste all the way, again a bit of a sweet taste. Some late bitterness. This was a good beer, but not as robust as I thought it would be. Still, would drink it again."
"Final Note: well worth the price of admission."
"Pours a rich, black color with a nice tan head. Smell is dry, roasty malt with some light dusty hops, and some chocolate comes through as it sits a bit. Taste is exceptional. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a somehow dry, cocoa flavor balanced perfectly with bittersweet dark roast. Finishes so smoothly and cleanly, leaving a hint of a pleasant aftertaste. Carbonation is spot on, and makes for a silky, creamy beer. One of the favorite beers ever."
"Pours nearly-black opaque brown with two fingers of very rich brown head and generous lace. Smells of sweetened cocoa, caramel malts and grain. Perhaps a touch of oatmeal in there somewhere. The flavor starts with sweet chocolate malt, builds to a rounded toasty center, and finishes with lactic and faintly smoky notes. Somewhat high in alcohol for a porter, though it can't be easily discerned in the flavor. Body is medium-thick, clean, and tending towards a creamy fullness. A little unassuming, but pleasing enough."
"*Taster's Note: Special thanks to beerhandy for sharing this bottle."
"Taste is heavy roasted, but does not turn sharp or extremely maltbitter. It is just heavy on the roasted malts with the big bosy there to balance things out. There is molasses and coffee, a nice fruity yeast that appears to be somewhat English. The beer is bitter and has some maltbitter which is nicely balanced by the body. I don't know how they did it, but it has a bog body but it is not sweet or sticky, neither is the beer dry, just perfect."
"D: One of the best porters I've had in a long time. Fantastic balance and it's so flavorful. Not much to complain about here, except that it can be pretty thick at times. A must try."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Actually feels a little thin, but it's not a negative. It's extremely smooth and drinkable. Carbonation is somewhat low, but great for this beer. Overall, this is very, very good porter."
"Perfect pairing with a chocolate cake."
"D: Drinks well. I will probably buy again."
"D - Very drinkable. It is a little strong but still a brew I would like to quaff through the course of an evening."
"Almost opaque, some light is getting through the edges of this dark brown sample. A nice dark tan head that is slightly thicker than that of a rootbeer float. Settles quickly to spotty lacing patterns. The smell is a rich aggressive dark chocolate, toasted malt and coffee bean that is very similar to the flavor. You can almost taste it before it gets into your mouth. A mellow tingle of carbonation, the mouth feel is medium bodied. Full flavored, the roasted mocha taste lingers nicely and a touch of bitterness contributes a dry sense to the finish. A real nice drinker, the 7% ABV is warming but nicely integrated. Recommended."
"Pours pitch black with a good sized tan head. Nose has noticeable cocoa powder tones and coffee notes as well. Flavor is more along the roasted edge. as it warms up there seems to be a sweet edge that borders on being berry influenced almost. Stays nice and rounded and a good aftertaste is left to linger. Feel is smooth. Carbonation is higher. Drinkable, yes. I like."
"D - Great, highly drinkable beer. This is a sipping beer, not a session beer, but it is quite a joy to sip. The complexity is fantastic and it has more than enough depth to keep you interested down to the bottom of the glass. This stands up there with some of the best American imperial stouts and porters such as those from Stone and Victory. I had seen Nogne O at beers in stores several times without stopping to pick one up, but after this I will certainly not pass them by any longer."
"Very, very drinkable for such a flavorful porter."
"The drinkability is good really a nice job on a big porter, almost drinks like a stout. Prosit, MK"
"D- It is a pretty good porter. I think I preferred their winter ale but still a good beer."
"Served at cellar temp."
"a fantastic plain old porter. nothing fancy about it just a good old porter, super dark mahogany in colour, with a light brown perfectly sticky head. the smell isn't anything spectacular, but the taste is all that a porter should be and nothing it shouldn't, caramel, and chocolate malt flavours, thick but not too thick. and drinks very easy, i highly recomend this to anyone who loves a good porter."
"this porter pours tar black, with little head. incorporates all the taste of a porter but not overpowering like many can be, its a very smooth porter, borderline watery but for me just right. often times i am turned of by the sharp maltiness of many porters so i enjoy this one very much, good buy, but a bit expensive in america at about 9 bucks a bottle."
"Pours jet black, with a big tannish-brown head. In the aroma, a sweet, roasty malt. In the taste, quite malty, with hints of chocolate and caramel sweetness. A nice malty body, with a small bitterness in the mouthfeel and a dry chocolate malt aftertaste. Very nice porter, nice chocolate malt. Easy to drink and quite tasty."
"M: I was surprised by how thin, almost flat, this beer tasted. It wasn't thin in a negative sense, but didn't match up with what I expected from the scent."
"Pours an opaque dark brown/red highlights, thin off white head, leaves some lace spots, settles to a thin ring. Smell is dates, toffee, chocolate, some light roast, touch of floral, quite nice. Taste is very roasty, rich chocolate, cherries, bit of beef jerky smoke, powdered milk, weird fruitiness, kind of cloying flavour. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with low carbonation, smooth, sticky. Something about this beer I don't get. I enjoy the aroma a lot, and the flavour as well but there are a couple that were off, but my mouth felt kind of dirty after drinking it, pretty strange, I'll try this again but I'm kind of on the fence at this point."
"Recommended only if you are willing to pay this much for a bottle, but nothing spectacular, just an average beer, the only cool thing is that it is Norweigan"
"This one's a gusher. Pours out nearly black with some ruby edges. Head is thinnish, but of an attractive, frothy, tan composition. Smells like a mix of dark roast black coffee and dark hot chocolate. Some undertones of molasses, tobacco, and a shy citrus hop character. Roasty coffee is at the fore of the taste profile. Cocoa powder lingers just beneath it. Citrus and raisin comes out more towards the middle. The finish has a touch of roasted malt astringency and some lactic sourness. Roasted grain lingers on into the aftertaste along with the citrus. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. The body is light to moderate, which is just fine here with the amount of sweetness in the beer. Solid drinkability. Very impressed."
"D - Well balanced and tasty."
"A tad thin in the body, nitpicking there. Im guessing low (5-6%) alcohol; it slides down quickly and smoothly."
"Overall - An outstanding porter... probably the best i've tried so far... highly recommended...."
"My first offering from Nogne and will not be my last. Good solid porter with spot on flavors and aromas. Great mouthfeel."
"Drank pretty easy for the abv, I'm very impressed with this porter"
"Overall very good drinkability, though it's a little stout for the style. Regardless, I think I found a new favorite. This one is as close to perfection as I've had for a porter...somebody send me their Imperial Stouts!"
"D - A very good Porter w/ hints at Baltic porter style, but plenty of chocolate and coffee flavors. A solid choice, a very good Norwegian Porter, as good or better than many American porters."
"Been sitting for a week since I bought it and the carbonation flowed out fast so watch out. The smell is wonderful, sooo great! It smells fruity with great chocolate tones in the background. The head was great, but then fell fast leaving behind a lilypad effect with a good thick lacing. The color is black with seemingly less than a millimeter of light that comes through in a purple-ish color. The smell is slightly roasty with good chocolate flavors backed up by good dark fruit. The taste is very fruity and has a burst of light fruity flavor that mellows and then has an aftertaste like a great coffee with a nose of the same. Smooth, roasty coffee flavors you find in an expensive coffee. Light mouthfeel that is very smooth, especially for such a large carbonation reaction when opened. It's smooth on the tongue and then dissapears without a trace, so maybe a little dry without any harshness. Overall I enjoyed this very much and will have another one."
"while to finish. Definitely not a session beer. Recommended!"
"Overall, a decent porter but a bit one-dimensional. No problems consuming the bottle, and would probably drink another if I had one."
"The body is fairly thin, medium at most. Carbonation is light with a creamy feel. A good balance between sweet and dry. Very good and very drinkable. I can't wait to try the Imperial Stout if this is their idea of a standard porter."
"D - Not bad. I will seek out other Nogne beers, but not the porter in particular."
"This bottle of Nøgne Ø Porter was picked up during my last visit to Green's. When uncapped, the beer formed a rapidly rising head in the bottle, but the quickness of my hands avoided any spillage. In my imperial pint glass, this formed a four finger tall beige head, which looked in stark contrast to the deep black color of the body. The hefty roastiness of the aroma indicated that this was going to be forceful porter, the kind of drink the vikings would have enjoyed before going on a berserk raid in an alternate brewing universe. Coffee and chocolate were everywhere in the nose. The taste was sharp yet soft as the astringent taste and silky body rubbed shoulders in the same glass. I did not get much of the dried fruit flavors that were mentioned on the back label, but coffee and toffee were definitely abundant. Slight sourness in the aftertaste, and a hint of bitter cocoa lingered on. Some brashness in the mouthfeel from the roast grain, but it was right at home in the style. Well done imported porter, which is not the typical case."
"It's a pretty good porter, but it just seems like there's no imagination. The taste is of roasted chocolate, plain, clean, good, but not that impressive. There's a nice aroma to match and it certainly wasn't bland - there was just no zing. For the price, I want something to savor, I'll stick to Sierra Nevada and Anchor Porter."
"Recommended. A nicely done porter indeed. Maybe a touch pricey for everyday drinking...of course, life is short, right?"
"Overall, it's a decent porter, but has some off notes."
"I purchased a bottle of this somewhat randomly without any prior knowledge of the brewery or the brew itself. Having no real expectations, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this beer. It poured jet black, as you'd expect from a porter of this strength, with a fairly minimal crown of beige foam on top. The head doesn't last long, and eventually settles into a small ring around the edges. I found the somewhat subdued carbonation ideal for the style - it lends an easy drinkability and smooth mouthfeel. The nose and flavor are malt-heavy, roasted and chocolatey, mild but delicious. The taste surprised me somewhat - at 7% ABV I was expecting a heavy porter, something closer to a strong stout. Despite its strength the beer stays true to the modern porter style with a pleasantly mellow character medium-to-thin body. Overall one of the better porters I've had - it's a shame this isn't more widely available."
"Good smell full of malt and nut notes. With a good taste that is good for the style. Balance with nothing overbearing. This porter is approachable to my favorite, which is Barley John's Old 8. The only draw back to this beer and why its not a full time member of my fridge is the fact that its just a touch pricey for a porter when I can go down the road for only 3.25 and get Old 8."
"Pricey, and maybe not deservingly so. ($6.99/bomber in these here parts)"
"A good porter but hard to really set it apart from a large swath of porters out there. If it were my local I'd certainly buy it frequently, but I have no plans on relocating to Norway...yet."
"This beer pours a dark black body with a nice mahogany color around the edges. Very little head to speak of, but what was there dissipates very quickly down to nothing with no lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly toasted chocolate with a whiff of alcohol in the end. This medium to thin body porter is well carbonated and roll around the tongue perfectly. This porter tastes of bitter roasted coffee, kinda charcoal and smokey too. It finishes with chalky dry chocolate and leaves a slight roasted bitter flavor on the tongue. Very good porter that's very drinkable, and for $5 it's not a bad buy either at 7%. Great beer..."
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side, which is my only real complaint about this beer, and there's a bit of warming in the back of the throat. The drinkabiliity is very good as well."
"Pours a three-finger brown head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Black as midnight. Slight hoppy nose. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Flavor is roasted/bitter coffee with a slight smoky finish. $6.00 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"A very dark black beer with only the vaguest hints of mahogony color when held up to the light. Has a very creamy dark beige head and a little bit of lace. The aroma has hint of spice and licorice with a roast malt backbone. There was a good Porter mouth feel. Oddly all of the flavor seems to land on the back of the tongue and throat. All of the roast malt notes fighting with the bitter sweet chocolate character and a hint of spicy hops."
"The taste is sweet, yet still the body is fairly light. It has a medium heft to it as it rests on the palate; it does not have the heft or rich feeling that I might have been expecting from the aroma. Dusty chocolate flavors are noticeable up front and the finish has a distinct espresso character of burnt acidity, and a suite of roast coffee bean flavors. The beer dries out considerably after the first few sips and it is not quite as rich as I was hoping. Still this is a fairly tasty tipple; one which I am quite content to finish."
"D: This is a good beer but its not great. Ive been disappointed with Nogne beers so far."
"The second to last Nogne we sampled the other night. This one was poured into a Duvel tulip glass. The body was a deep black hole with a small tan head that lingered for a bit. The been gave off a malty, slightly bitter bouquet that was music to my nose. The taste was a nice solid porter. Roasted malt, coffee, cocoa all mixing together to made a full bodied brew that is worth another try."
"Terrible substantial stuff, with an intriquing kick."
"This is a great American-style porter from a country not associated with beer. It is on par with Sierra Nevada porter."
"Seems a bit overcarbonated, and slightly thin. Very easy to drink, and enjoyable."
"High in carbonation for a porter but I like it; adds a nice creamy quality to the mouthfeel. Roasty burnt caramel flavors with a pot of stale coffee on the end. Finish is lingering and dry. Again very roasty. Not overly complex but very balanced and palatable."
"Very nice color-deep black but with some subdued ruby highlights. Killer aroma-bittersweet chocolate with an overall malty profile. Very nice bready/yeasty quality to it as well. Extemely bold chocolate flavor. Some great black currant and burnt raisen flavors. Malty sweetness behind it all with just a trace of bitterness. The most chocolate flavor I have ever tasted in a beer that doesnt claim to be a chocolate beer. Great body-the sweetness is very prominant though it has an evenly dry finish. Just a super beer. I wish more US porters had the overall balls that this does. Along the borderlines of a stout to me. Great beer. Bring on the imperial stout I say. I am very, very impressed."
"Recommended to dark beer fans, this one brings it."
"Into a pint glass, pours a dark black brown, dark tan head of about half a finger, sticks around a bit before receding to a thin film, lacing is kind of thick in falling sheets that don't stick. Aroma is of dark, bittersweet chocolates, some ground coffee, not all too complex, but satisfying. The taste is similar to aroma, bittersweet chocolates and more coffee, a good bittering, pretty sound porter feel to it. The mouth is probably the best parth though, incredible smoothness, medium body feels right, and all in all this is a pretty solid beer."
"Very dark with deep ruby highlights. The short cap of light brown foam produced plenty of streaky lacing even after falling to a thin skim of bubbles. Nice aroma, some roast, coffee, dark chocolate and toffee, with just a hint of burnt malt and smoke. Mild, yet solid, bitterness with leafy hops running straight through the middle. Malt sweetness was mostly the chocolate variety with a little caramel filling out the end. Dark malts were more prominent in the finish, just a little burnt and roast charaacter. Lowish carbonation with a medium/full body, fine texture and just a little dry. Tasty stuff! It goes down easy and is nicely balanced. I'd definitely pick this up again."
"I expected good things from this beer, but I had no idea it was going to be this good. I should have gotten a case when I had the opportunity. Nogne Porter is an outstanding offering that I urge anyone and everyone to try. Tasting is believing. It's one of the best American porters that I've ever had... and it's brewed in Norway. What are the odds?"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a tight 1/4"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head quickly is down to an uneven layer of bubbles, with slow-falling orange-tinged brown lace. Aroma is rich chocolate, dark fuirt, and some alcohol. Taste mirrors the nose almost exactly, with the aftertaste an amalgam of all of the above, and also a bit of roastiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and deceptively thin, and drinkability is pretty good. The bottle doesn't say so, but if any beer is an imperial porter, this is it."
"drinkability is great. very well balanced and quite tasty. the alcohol is completely hidden and in near perfect harmony with the malt and bitterness. a great porter."
"This is a very inviting beer that seems to age with great dignity."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Edit: ended up dumping this down the drain, wasn't even willing to finish it off. Bleh."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a big slightly off-white foamy head with good retention. Aroma of chocolate malt is quite interesting and well balance by some roastiness. Taste is a well balance mix between some chocolate malt with some roasted malt providing some bitterness. Texture is really creamy and this is appreciated considering the style."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle into an Imperial pint glass. Appears an opaque dark brown, almost black, with two fingers of dark tan colored head. No lacing to speak of. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, caramel and cocoa. Tastes of black licorice, and bitter chocolate. The bitterness remains throughout the finish along with a mild sourness. Medium in both body and carbonation. A very nice porter, but I would probably pass it by next time due to the cost. Give it a shot if you have not yet done so."
"Drinkability: sweet and flavorful porter that is an ultimate session beer. I can drink this all day long for several days in a row without getting bored. Must give this one a try."
"D: An abundance of complex flavors and aromas with a well hidden alcohol component lend this porter fantastic drinkability."
"Rich and complex, but keeping aplpropriately in porter style. Very delicious with dangerously hidden alcohol. If I didn't know that this was an import from Norway, I would have thought that this was a domestic brew, as it is so fresh. In the style of an American Porter with a nod from English-style. If you like good porters, let this one warm up a bit and you're in for a treat!"
"Very nice roasted malt and chocolate aroma but has a bit of a nose tingling sharpness to the aroma that I cant pin down. Dark brown to black body with a slowly diminshing thumb thick mocha head. Fore is slightly smokey and segues into stale coffee and chocolate. Nice roasty bitterness in the middle and finish. Doesnt quite have enough freshness to the chocolate malt asspect to it, but still a pretty spot on Porter. Some mild nuttiness in the far aftertaste reminds me of a brown ale."
"Intense yet smooth roast flavour with some coffee, black colour. Some quality bittersweet dark chocolate. Also malt and licorice. Good porter, not complex yet satisfying pint, well carbonated, fresh from Norway thanks to trade with Madsberg. Medium mouthfeel."
"Bottle condtioned. Pours with an excellent thick & tan head. Pitch black, even when held to the light. In a blind test I'd probably say this was a dry stout (not Guinness!), maybe even an imperial. Aroma of roasted malts, coffee, cigar box, English pipe tobacco and dark bitter chocolate. Flavour is again roasted malts, coffee and dark chocolate. Not too sweet, excellent bitterness where you can sense the hops as well as the roasted malts."
