"Disappointing, expected more. Not a great taste or balance."

"This is a very Boozy beer! I would think cellaring this would be great! I get chocolate, slight orange in the taste. But the alcohol overpowers most of the taste. Not very impressed. In a year or two of sitting mite be a really good beer."

"Smelt like the chocolate oragne that gets cracked open.  Taste wasn't too far off but wasn't my cup of tea.  If you like porters it's a nice variation to the genre."
"3.33/5: Not bad, it just needs more cohesion"

"A big-ass Baltic-Style Porter with blood orange peel and cacao nibs. Big on darkness with a brown lacing on top. Big nose and palate of dark fruit and highly roasted grain, both of which give off suggestions of dark fruit and coffee ... chocolate comes from the cacao nibs obviously. Massive chewy body and the 9.0% abv is noticeable, there is some orange peel in here but this beer is just too big for it really to make a good showing. Perhaps there is a pinch of it middle to end but pretty damn subtle. Also, the addition of cacao could easily be confused for additions of dark malt ... if it was not on the label I would not even think about it. Regardless, good drinking all around."
"Overall:  Unlike many of the other reviewers, I was able to pick out the blood orange tones; perhaps it was the power of suggestion, but I could smell it and taste it; pretty impressed with this brew coming from Saranac - I have tasted some good beers in their High Peaks line"

"It pours from a 12oz bottle with very little head. The color is very dark brown, nearly black with the head having a slight orange tint to the otherwise lighter brown. The smell is pretty strong with chocolate with no real hints of orange. Mouthfeel is over-all smooth but with sharp carbonation coming late. Taste is dark and slightly bitter chocolate. There is hardly any orange taste, just a bit of an aftertaste. It would be easy to confuse this with just another chocolate porter. Over-all quite good."
"Solid dark brown with a stingy off white head. Aromas of milk chocolate and caramel with hints of earth. The flavor is mostly caramel and chocolate with a hint of citrus. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a creamy silky mouthfeel. Not a bad beer, but I would have liked a bit of orange as I found almost none."

"Pours almost black with a thin tan head. Excellent retention, and very nice lace. Aroma is of dark chocolate, and cocoa. Body is on the light side with some carbonation. Taste is of bitter dark chocolate. There is no hint of Orange. This is supposed to be a Baltic Porter? Not very good. This brewery continues to disappoint."

"O- I was very surprised by this one. It had about a year of age on it and I think that it brought out some of the chocolaty notes. They should make this a winter seasonal because its without a doubt my favorite beer from Saranac"
"I would recommend that Saranac makes this a winter seasonal release."

"Usually I shy away from Saranac beers, but I received this as a gift and was pleasantly surprised. This is good to drink now but may show more complexity with age."

"So, the beer is not really orangey...it does have a notable chocolate malt character, present both in the aroma and the taste. Roasted, malty, a bit woody. Somewhat sweet. The smell has a fleeting spiciness and floral quality...like orange blossoms...but not a real orange flavor. Full in body, but just a tad thin in the latter finish. Well balanced. Lots of flavor. I like this beer, but it's not a chocolate orange for sure."

"Good porter, but I really didn't get the orange flavor they were going for. Worth trying, at any rate."

"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a massively dark brown (almost black) with a half finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount very quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, citrus, orange zest, and roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, orange, milk chocolate, and subtle dark fruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. If I am honest here, I really don’t know what they were trying to do… While the chocolate and orange aspect was definitely there, I’m not sure it worked so great together. Luckily there was some dark fruit character going on to help add a nice medium to the brew. Otherwise this one could have been a disaster. Worth trying at least once, but I would leave it at that."
""
"Overall: a very drinkable baltic porter that leans towards the chocolate side. Pretty good beer here."
""
""
""
"This has great flavor. It's rich, chocolaty and roasty. It's smooth and unique. If I see this on the shelves again, I will definitely buy another bomber."
""
"Overall: This beer was better than I thought it would be. The orange wasn't very strong, but it was a nice addition to the roast. I'd have another."
""
"O- Chocolate and orange isn't the first fruit/chocolate pairing that would come to mind. Beer is actually pretty good and has a nice bitter orange peel aroma and flavor. Worth a try but not sure I would have again."
""
"o: very well rounded porter. the 9% abv is very well hidden. the closer to room temp the better this beer is."

"O: Overall it is a great stout.... I mean err.. robust porter.. But I think when you put Chocolate Orange on the label, you better make damn sure you can pick out the orange.. Really tasty.. Really chocolatey... But the Orange is MIA, it seems to possibly pick up a little as it warms but still.."
"A beautiful looking dark beer with big chewy tan foam head, the lacing is thick and beautiful between sips. The body is dark, doesn't let any light through it. The aroma has big ballsy cocoa nibs and orange fruit notes of citric bursts, clean beautiful cohesion coming through. Flavor full dark malt flavors come forth with a hint of orange peel flowing along big sweet maltiness balanced with dark roass. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with even smooth flowing carbonation, pretty nice beer from Saranac...it's hard to believe they're making beer like this in Utica NY."

"Picked up a bomber from Brilbeck's in Syracuse. The orange doesn't come out until you give this beer time to warm up, but once it's there, the orange peel makes a fine complement to the dark malts. The chocolate here isn't that strong. The barley has a clean roasted brown malt flavor in addition to the cocoa, and I can't say I taste the cacao nibs at all. The orange component tastes sweet and a little juicy, but it doesn't overshadow the barley. The body is light for a 9% ABV porter, but not inappropriately so, and not surprising for a Saranac beer. Overall, it makes a nice, not too heavy dessert beer with the classic orange and chocolate pairing."
"O: A bit blunt at first, the chocolate and coffee roast are dark and dominating while the alcohol surely flexes its muscle as well. It takes a few sips but things do smooth out a bit once your tongue becomes accustomed to the heavy handed roasty and alcohol nature. Saranac definitely amped things up a bit from their usual offering here with a dark silty roasty treat worhty of a try."

"A decent baltic porter here. Some aging will knock the alcohol down enough to bring out the chocolate and orange."

"Half pour (thankfully) served in a 6oz. wine glass, deep, dark brown-black color, capped with a nice foamy mocha head. Aroma of roasty dark malts, coffee notes, probably about robust enough to be a stout. Taste of dark malts, roasty, cocoa, with a hint of citrus and pine in the finish, and a ubiquitous booziness throughout. I got more booze than anything in this one really, and it detracted from the mouthfeel quite a bit. Body is no more than middle-of-the-road medium, leaving no doubt that this is no stout, low carbonation, which was good considering it wasn't very smooth otherwise. Pretty decent overall, but I wouldn't want any more than the sample I had."

"Summary: By far, THE BEST I've ever had from Saranac. Ever. Living in Albany, I've been there many, many times for all their beers and a number of special events. This beer is OUTSTANDING! Whilst labeled a baltic porter, this big, complex, balanced beer has a lot going on. How's they hide the 9% abc so well? A genus of a beer! Highly recommended!"

"Overall I found this one at a shop notorious for jacking up bomber prices so if you find this for under 8 bucks pick it up. Agreeing with everyone in saying this is the best beer these guys ever put out!"
""
"I could taste the booze a bit and was just a bit affected by it when I made my way to the end of the bottle. This wasn't what I expected at all and the roasted and creamy notes to this beer give it a nice body without weighing it down. Lots of foods like mousse cake or pudding would go well with this but lets face it, when you get a beer this works this well on its own, just enjoy the work of art for what it is. Props to Matt for pushing the boundaries with this and redefining the potential of what a Saranac beer can be."
""
"Overall: Probably the best offering Saranac has produced to date. If you did not tell me this beer was supposed to contain orange I would not have explicitly known, but regardless this beer is a fantastic baltic porter. This beer would be excellent with vanilla ice cream and I'd even be willing to give it a shot with orange sherbet or sorbet."
""
"O-not a bad porter but expected more orange in the flavor, and there was almost no orange in the nose. I liked it but could needed more emphasis on the orange, Still recommend"
"On tap. Pours a dark black with an inch of frothy brown head. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malts, and some citrus. Lots of lacing. Flavors of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts and some orange peel. Bitter dark chocolate. A bit smoky. Does have some chocolate orange flavor to it, but more dark chocolate than orange. Still, well done. Heavy mouthfeel. Overall, i am impressed. Worth seeking out for sure."

"O: ive really been loving the offerings that have been coming out from saranac as of late and, as far as im aware, this is going to be just the beginning"
""
""
"I gotta say I was a little intrigued to see Matt going out and making a beer like this,I have had mixed feelings about their High Peaks series,this was a hands down big winner.Pours nearly jet black except for some ruby tinge when held in the light,a thick rocky deep mocha colored head atop.The aromas are really nice they just don't jump out ya,the blood orange comes thru along sweetish chocolate and sweet alcohol with a bit of roast as well.Really nice complexity on the palate with a mix of bittersweet chocolate,blood orange,sweet alcohol,and a healthy roastiness and earthy finish.I went back and forth on the mouthfeel between 3.5-4 and 4 and went with the 4 because it did coat the mouth and it did glide down easy.This is a great Baltic porter,the Matt guys put some real care into this and didn't cut corners,I loved it."
"O- I have got to pick up some more of this. Especially some to send out in trades. Reminds me a little bit of Stone VE 09/09/09 but thicker and more chocolatey. Very well done Saranac... very well done indeed!"
""
""
"O-As far as Imperial Porters with orange go with one does not measure up to BBXXIII, it is still a decent beer but not as good."
""
"This was nowhere near what I was expecting when I got a bottle of this Baltic porter from Saranac. Perhaps one of the finest beers from Saranac and one I will be seeking out soon again. Definitely worth a try and is highly recommended."
"O: This is quite good. More stout-like in many ways than a porter (but let's face it, Imperial Porters and Double Stouts aren't too far apart - especially once you start adding extra ingredients, it can become hard to tell them apart). This is probably the highest rating I've ever given to one of Saranac's beers. Let's hope that with the new bombers they continue to make good stuff."
"Overall worth a try and a good Porter. I've never been a huge fan of orange chocolate myself so maybe others will like more. Would think this would improve well with aging as the hops tone down and the beer mellows out."
