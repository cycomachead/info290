"Very bold taste. Strong for a porter. Definite notes of black cherry, chocolate, and coffee. Not for those just starting to try porters or stouts."
""
""
"Best Porter ever, ticks all the boxes, sets the standard for all others to compete with. A stunning beer to be sipped as slowly as possible."

"Amazingly rich with a hint of alcohol. Very good on a cold day"
""
"Tastes amazing.  Starts off vanilla cherry, then tobacco, then a little vinegar, ends with dry dark chocolate.  This was one of my more successful cellar attempts."
""
""

"Think Port meets Porter. Rich, sweet and smooth. The aftertaste features a sugary almost treacle finish. If you like your beers dry, avoid this one. This is extremely sweet. Otherwise, make an effort to try this. As a Port lover, this bring two of my passions together superbly."

"Very excited to try this beer - one of my original 'wants' from when I joined BA and I was fortunate to procure a bottle at the State Liquor Store in Stowe, VT on 12/24/14.  750ml caged and corked bottle served in a tulip.  Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, fizzy, quarter inch, khaki-colored head.  Head quickly dissipates into oily droplets and specks and strands of lacing. Nose is vinous and roasty with kiss of smoke, cocoa and booze.  Taste consistent with nose; however, you definitely get that lagered quality in the flavor profile (hard to describe what it is, but it's there).  There's a bit of a medicinal grapey quality that comes out towards the back and lingers between quaffs.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a carbonation just shy of lively, a light acidity and a residual burn at the back of the throat.  Overall, not my favorite Baltic Porter, but very much true to style.  Not something I would recommend for extended cellaring as I can see this oxidizing with time."

"Rich complex and sweet. Full of flavors like black forest cake, cherries, dried fruits, bannana, molasses, coffee, toffee, and many other rich and delicate flavors. My mate who tasted this with my though it tasted like cough medicine, but he's an idiot. Would definitely buy this again."

"Poured from the austere looking jet black bottle into a snifter. Pitch brownish-black brew with next to no head, just a stippling of dark rusty brown bubbles against the sides of the glass. Intensely sweet nose of dark dried fruits (cherries, prunes), toffee, rum, licorice candy, and enough roasted malts melding with the sweet elements to evoke coffee liqueur. Wonderful stuff. The taste does not disappoint either, although be forewarned ... This is SWEET, like in Samichlaus Classic Bier territory. Flat, almost non-carbonated, and drinks like dessert, although there is a roasted licorice element that engages the palate after a while. Coffee toffee, black forest cake, and molasses with just the barest hint of smoke (at first). Apparently there's hops in here but I do not taste them. This is a challenging brew to rate ... One has to evaluate on the basis of the style guidelines and what the brewery is intending to execute here. Far too sweet on most nights for me, but sipped slowly and shared this is a sublime brew ... Earthy, rich, and fruity, with a slow building alcohol warmth like a high end rum and an emergent cigar-like smokiness."

"On a packaging note – the date is printed on the back label with other pertinent information (a good thing) but is very light and mostly unreadable (a bad thing)."

"o: a really big but delicious brew. really heavy on the licorice and cherrywood to start, but rounds out afterwards with those classic dark beer flavours"
""
"PBGC poured an opaque black..back lighting did nothing more than lighten the beer around the edges of the glass to a dark brown. The aroma was fabulous, a combination of chocolate, alcohol, dark ripe fruits and wet autumn leaves. Pouring produced just over 1"" of crema coloured, creamy head which lasted for 4-5 minutes before disappearing completely, leaving no lacing or spotting down the glass. It's flavour was as wonderful as the aroma, with sweet, dark malts, chocolate, and dark fruits, ending with a modest bitterness. As the beer warms, the alcohol aroma becomes more noticeable, and the already modestly bitter finish mellows further. A bittersweet aftertaste lingers, and though I'm not normally a fan of lingering aftertastes, it was a shame that I eventually had to brush my teeth before going to sleep. Trois Mousquetaires has the carbonation just right on this one, and PBGC is full bodied with the creamy mouthfeel of an oatmeal stout. One thing that struck me about the beer was the variability in taste...one mouthful the chocolate dominates, in the next the dark fruits are more pronounced, in another the malt sweetness is front and centre. PBGC is a complex beer, but not so complex that the individual aromas and tastes get lost. In summary, a wonderful beer...the only area in which it falls down is the ""value for money"" factor. At $9.95 a bottle, I'll have to put this beer in the ""special treat"" category. In a 750 ml bottle, PBGC is best shared...or at least stretched out over a long winter night."

"Overall, an excellent Baltic Porter. The label is detailed about the ingredients in the beer, gives an added dimension to the tasting. It includes the malts, hops,pairings, aging, glassware, and serving temp."
"O: I've had this beer a few times now, and each time it has had a little more age on it (this particular bottle is just under a year) and each time it has gotten better. This beer is a steal at $9 a bottle and is well deserving of its high ranking."
"Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a velvety smooth, softly bubbly mouthfeel that's probably around half foamy and half smooth. The result is quite nice for the beer, actually fairly exceptional, and within the guidelines for the style. Ethanol is exceptionally well concealed for a 10% ABV beer, only the slightest of heat in the nostrils and tingle on back of throat. Closes dry, with substantial stickiness clinging to the lips and palate."

"M: Medium leading to more full bodied. High carbonation."
""
""
""
"Overall: an incredible beer. One of the best I've had. Complex - I love the notes of dark fruit. Only negative is that it is slightly sweet but it still works well for this sipper."
""
""
"Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique is a very solid beer that reminded me of the better traditional (lagered) examples of this style produced by a handful of breweries in the Baltic region. I probably would not go out of my way to buy this again, but it was enjoyable nonetheless."
""
""
"Overall - A very fine beer, one that might improve with some age on it. For now, while it was quite delicious, it was extremely intense in its flavors and a bit unrelenting. This is one of the first beers where I've truly understood of sharing a bottle, because with other large containers, drinking a bottle over 3-4 hours still is not a chore, but with this it was. Still highly recommended for those enjoying the style, or those looking for something extreme."
"Good sippin' beer. Be sure to give yourself enough time to work your way through the bottle."
""
""
"Overall:10%, no way. This beer is so good you don't even notice it. Sign me up for another."
""
""
""
""
""

"D - Alcohol is completely hidden. Very complex and interesting but drinks pretty smooth for all that is going on."
"OVERALL : A very good baltic porter. Somewhat better balanced than their 2013 bourbon/brandy barrel version, but then this 2013 edition is meants to be over-the-top to a point, so it's hard to compare. This standard version of their baltic porter gets the job done in a most amazing way. Rich and warm and pleasing."

"Excellent Baltic Porter. While the aroma is only OK, the flavor is fantastic. Very rich and complex."
"The beer pours a jet black with a creamy tan head that laces. The nose is quite fruity, toasty, almost smoky, and has a deep molasses sweetness. The taste is booming with far more pronounced smokiness and fruity sweetness. This is unlike any Baltic porter I've had with a tremendous amount of interesting flavor layered on top of the smooth, rich, velvety mouthfeel. Honestly I'm a bit taken aback by the strangeness of this brew, considering the smokiness. The beer has more carbonation that I'd prefer, but the flavor richness masks its huge abv well. This is definitely a world class Baltic porter with an incredible amount of complexity and flavor."

"Overall pretty nice beer, goods malts and lager feel, the aged feel was nice other than the slight oxidation, tasty with a long great finish."
"O - Overall I was happily impressed by this beer, while everything was nice as a whole, the lingering finish is just awesome."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"It is very easy to drink with a nice dark sugar pop. I'm not sure where to place it with Baltic Porters, but I can surely say it's one of the best beers I've had."
""
""

"Could use higher carbonation to cut the sweetness."
"Overall: A classic that has great potential for aging. Excellent all around."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark reddish-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, smoke, and wood. Taste is much the same with a smoke and cocoa flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some great aromas and flavors."

"Overall: I was looking for something to warm me up after the bitter cold bike ride home in the crushing 4:30 pm darkness of PDX, and I think I found it. This thing is interesting and inviting, a bit sweet, but that makes it an easy drinker, a bit too easy, maybe, given the 10%. I will definitely seek one out for the cellar as I think this one may round out nicely. A keeper indeed."
""
"This is a very tasty and drinkable beer that has a complex flavor. However, I was expecting a bigger mouthfeel with this beer."
""
""
""
"This is one intense beer with almost too many flavours going on at once. I would love to age some of this as the finishing sweetness was a little much right now but the beer is complex and full of deep notes of dark fruit and molasses. Quite a beer from a Canadian brewer and on to hold onto for awhile."
"Dark cola brown colour. Small, poorly retained tan head. No lace. Aromatic notes of raisin, fig, and sweet chocolate. Hints of coffee, smoke, and alcohol add complexity. Sweet raisins and brown sugar hit the palate first, followed by chocolate and very light smoke midpalate. Coffee, light char, and a gentle acidity in the finish. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth, rich, silky mouthfeel. This well-crafted strong black lager shows great depth and complexity of flavour, great length; and exceptional balance of sweet, bitter, and even tart tastes - though it definitely leans closer to the sweet side of things."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."

"I really, really enjoyed this brew and would serve it as a good example of the style. Basically, the thing that sold me on this brew was the extent to which they counter-balanced the impressively complex, sweet malt profile with bitterness (roasted/burnt grains, hops) and a lager yeast finish to make an exceptionally malty beer without getting too cloying. Great job, TM!!!"
""
""
"Nice mouthfeel - not oily, but medium-thick. Sweet finish lasts pretty long. Sweet dark dry fruit like raisins or plums. Molasses. Vanilla. No smoke or wood -- maybe just a hint at the end; mostly dark fruit. Very pleasant to drink."
""
"OVERALL: The flavor is a little too sweet for my palate, but it is still a well made beer. There is lots of complex, interesting flavor, and the booze is held in check. The feel is pretty big as well, which really helps its cause. This would be good in small servings, but I found the 75cl bottle a little rough going at it alone. As a final note, I remember the '09 being much different than this 2011 vintage, which tells me this is a good candiate for a vertical one day. Cheers to the guys who helped me out with this one!"
"Pretty top notch, you decide if it's in the top three for the style though."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a true pint, this is from the 2011 vintage. The beer is a dark auburn-brown color with a filmy coating of light brown, big bubbled head. Dark, rich nose of balsamic vinegar, oakey wood characteristics, roasted nut, and a slight bitterness. The body is creamy and rich, with roasted and full flavors. Wood and earthy notes are imparted on a dark nut and creamy backbone, with an overall roasted quality. Roasted and boozey aftertaste, with a slick finish and lingering roasted charcter. Very smooth, very strong, and very good!"
"Really a treat, ""probably the best Baltic porter in the world""."
"I can only think of a couple of beers that as so complex beer. I'm usually going to seek out a drier beer but can still appreciate a an fine example of this style from time to time."
"O: You might want to slowly sip this beer on a cold winter night but it’s incredibly easy to drink considering its strength because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste, which is unusual for the style."
""
""
"Overall- This is a great Baltic porter. Good flavor, and good mouthfeel. 4.5/5. "
"Everything from this Quebec brewery I have had has been top notch,I have been looking to get my hands on this beer for a couple years,thanks to Roger at Bestway I was finally able to get some.Poured into a half liter stein a deep deep dark chocolate color with a 1/2 finger deep beige head atop.Cherry wood smoke like the label says is predominant with dark roast coffee and raisin,as it warms the coffee really comes into play more.Lightly smokey with big dark roast coffee ground flavors,it's brash and big,cherry and raisin flavors abound with some mild earthy tones in the finish.The best Baltic porter I have had and that's saying something,it's as good as advertised if not better,my favorite beer of 2012."

"750 ml bottle, 2011 vintage. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is very nice, it smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit (cherries), smoke, and some coffee. The taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like roasted malt, milk and bittersweet chocolate, tart cherries, plums, smoke, molasses, wood, and a bit of coffee. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and smooth, and has good, soft carbonation. I think this is a pretty good overall brew. I'd certainly buy it again. $12.99 a bottle, bought from Keg Liquors."
""
""
"Pours a pitch black color with a 1-finger creamy head. The smell is surprisigly hoppy but dominated by a frank malty sweetness and milk chocolate aromas. In the taste, malt first appears with toffee and chocolate. Then hop shows up, adding some more comlexity with a nice blend of herbal notes. A gentle bitterness and alcohol bite finish the experience. This full-bodied beer has a perfect carbonation and a good amount of malt which leaves a sweet touch in the mouth. Overall, an excellent brew, amazingly balanced!"
"Pours a three finger tan head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights, with some yeast left in bottle. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Smoky chocolate nose. Flavor is smoky chocolate and molasses. High ABV is hidden. $11.99 for a 750ml bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Definitely one of the best Baltic porters ever--far more flavourful than the Garrison Baltic porter."
""
"A fairly full-bodied beer with a fine and unobtrusive level of carbonation. Slightly warming. Profound and contemplative. I need to stop fucking around and buy a dozen to age. Love this."
""
"O - I haven't had a baltic porter for a while. I'll be having a few more after this. Its a cracking brew."
""
""
""
"This is not one of the biggest or most flavorful Baltic porter but it's extremely tasty and sweeter in the taste than the nose suggests."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very complex, sweet, smokey, woody, coffee, chocolate, almost too much going on here. Drinkability is moderate. WOuldn't be able to handle a whole bottle to myself."
"I used to think 'contemplative' was a bad word to describe a drink, but not with this beer. Seek it out if you can."
"O) Absolutely delicious... I wish I had another one of these in the cellar. Highly recommended..."
""
""
"Really - an amazing creation, this... the creamy sweetness, tart overtones and roasty, oaky, smokey goodness is over the top for me. It's a sipper for sure... what a pleasant and enjoyable brew."
""
"Pours a rich, dark, brown with firm cap of brown froth, decent retention. First whiff brings notes of dark roasted malts, molasses, anise, dark bitter baking chocolate, full roast coffee beans, dark fruits such as plum and currant, faint acidity, port-like, light char. Taste takes all of these components and blends them wonderfully. Notes of bitter chocolate cake throughout, cherry, currant and plum like fruitiness. Backed by roasted malts, light molasses, notes of anise, wood, port wine, vanilla, char. Deeply complex. Fuller side of medium bodied, somewhat dry end. Fantastic representation of the style that takes it to another level. Imperial Baltic Porter?"
"Overall, a damn fine beer, though a bit of age could bring it into a class of its own. My other bottle, I'll sit on that bad boy for at least a year. This beast could take it."
"O: A lot of times a big porter is just a stout. This is noticeably different. The roasted malt isn't as dominant as you would find on a 10% stout. Instead the fruitiness is a little more apparent, making it lighter than it really is. This is a great baltic porter, perhaps dethroning my previous favorite - Smuttynose Baltic Porter."
"Overall, this beer is excellent! Definitely hope to get a second."
""
"There is surprisingly little nose to it, which I found disappointing - that's one of my favorite parts of a good beer. But the taste - it had so much flavor it was like an amazing meal, I felt like I was dining in Moscow with some of my best buddies, it was blissful and transporting. I've had good porters/stouts, and this one ranks up in the very highest tier."
"D: Wow. Wonderfully complex and yet a relatively easy drinker (even with an ABV of 10%). Best beer I've had in a long, long time. Style defining. Simply phenomenal...seek it out...now."
""
""
""
""
"Edit: the SO says that it wasn't a random choice - she picked it because it's the WBA best Baltic porter. Which just goes to show that the WBA knows what they're talking about, man!"
""
""
"Bottle was 10 bucks at the LCBO and limited quantities saw it mostly sell out before Christmas 2011."
""
""
"O: Very nice taste and mouthfeel in this Baltic Porter. If I lived closer to Quebec I would drink one more regularly."
"Overall. Really nice beer here. Roasty and delicious"
""
""
"D/O: Exceptionally pleasant to drink. This is a very well balanced porter with a bold, complex, and very enjoyable palate."
""
""
"O- One word... Awesome!"
"Overall, a great beer! Lived up to the hype for me."
"Pretty good Baltic Porter. I usually like a touch more body and some more smoothness, but still solid."
"Overall – I have to say I was a little disappointed in this beer. The appearance wasn't great and the taste and smell were just slightly above average. The main highlight is probably how well of a job it does hiding the 10% alcohol level. Maybe a little age would have helped this bottle. It's still good and if you're a fan of the style you should check it out. I just wouldn't buy it again."
"O: An excellent brew that held up well at the head of a long tasting session."
"D: For 10% ABV, the drinkability is outstanding!"
"D: I'm enjoying the combination of these tastes - Malty sweet (toffee & dark fruits) against the earthy (damp wood) and smoke qualities. Will be stocking up on this before it's gone."
"Overall, I like it. I wish there were a bit more roastiness to balance the sweetness, but this is damn good."
"Overall a highly enjoyable porter, sweet at cellar temperature. Format and price is my least favourite part of this beer, and will probably limit my purchases."
"O: Delicious stuff and quite drinkable. A 750ml bottle makes for a good friend on a late October evening."
"O: Haven't had too many of this style and this is a highly rated beer, but the beer I had was fundamentally flawed. As I said, a grave disappointment."
"O- Had a tough time finishing this one as it warmed to room temperature as the sweetness and richness of the malt got to me. Very good beer though, watch out for the 10% abv!"
"pop was totally proper... no overflow even though the cork was just barely in there. its hot out... but this was smoother than silk. nose of a perfect balance of forest fruit and chocolate and straight up mesquite smoke. this made me think of poland. the Łodzki, warmanski, and ciechan 22. but this is aged to perfection. feel is mineral but viscus anise texture. hints of acidity. leather salt... wet saddle, and undertonics of smoke and balsamic vinegar. lots of anise. chalk dark fruit tannin sticky. great great great beer. wonder if its lager or ale yeast???"
"If you don’t already know, *this* is what a Baltic Porter is. I'm not sure what business this young, small, French-Canadian brewery has in showing up some of Eastern Europe's most established, vested brands but they've done it. This is a (if not, the) definitive example of a very complex, historic, hard to brew style of lager. Merci beaucoup, PeenSteen!"
"Again, a great and mighty shout out goes to flipper2gv for working with me on this swap!"
"D- Almost too drinkable. At 9.2%, it's hard to notice the alcohol. There is some boozy sharpness to it, but it's not abrasive or coarse. Incredibly easy drinking. Good follow through as well."
"2010 version pours a dark black with just a little bit of caramal brown foam. Tastes very roasty, almost like a roasted nut type of taste in there. Nice notes of chocolate as well. This bottle said it was 9.2% alc, and I call bullshit. This was insanely easy to drink. By far the smoothest porter I have had to date. Really sad to see this bottle go."
"Yeah, the mild finish is a surprise, but a pleasant one, and it in fact excels to become the key selling point here."
"Very, very good beer this one. Trois Mousquetaires continues to impress me, and this, indeed, is them at the top of their game."
"A decent baltic porter and really quite tasty. Thick, full flavoured and interesting. It is a touch sweet but that is good in it's own way."
"Pours very dark brown with a tan heads that quickly dissipates and leaves a thin ring. Aroma of chocolate, smoke, and ash. Strong malty flavor with rich dark chocolate, some dark fruits, and bitter coffee in the finish. Medium bodied with good carbonation, and slightly dry. Very nice, this is a great winter beer! I'll definitely buy this again."
"This brew pours a dark as night cola hue with nice carbonation that leaves behind a mocha laced two finger head that slowly reforms to a nice rim and little lacing,the smell is pretty much what it says on the back of the label its mostly aromas of chocolate and alcohol with some tobacco,oak and port in there aswell,it has a nice smooth,medium bodied mouthfeel which leaves your lips sticky with mocha hints and coats your mouth with tastes of dark cherry ripe,brandy liqueor encased in dark rich chocolate,dark berries and finishes with a nice strong port warmness that almost feels like you have just had a shot of some dark liquor and to be honest overall this brew is very interesting with alot of twists and turns in smell and taste but its not something i could drink all the time but glad ive sampled as its different and as this drop is my last for the night its the perfect nightcap."
"Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Only the high alcohol stops this from being perfect."
"D - I could drink this all night in the Winter. Absolutely delicious stuff here."
"Pours almost jet black with 1/2"" of tan head that lasted quite a while before retreating to the edges of the glass, almost no lacing to speak of. Smells of dark chocolate, roasted malt, pine nut/nutty, mocha and a lingering alcohol. On the palate there is coffee, a bittersweet chocolate presence, a woody presence almost like oak, a firm bitterness and a mild alcohol finish. Medium to thin mouthfeel that is quite pleasant, perfectly carbonated and as a result is very smooth. Great slow sipper, definitely a bottle to split. Good stuff here."
"It's delicious and easy drinking and another stellar beer from Les Trois Mousquetaires. I've yet to have anything from them that wasn't outstanding."
"Not the best looking brew on the block, but this brew scored big points where it counts - the flavor department. Lots of tasting notes to keep even the most discerning beergeek busy. I've been very happy with LTM so far, and their Baltic Porter, while not the blow-you-away brew beer I was expecting, was certainly a quality, flavorful brew. Well worth a pick up if you can find it."
"WS"
"Good golly, miss molly! This is a damn fine beer. It is all about malt flavours here, and they are most impressive. The interplay between the fruit notes and chocolate/roast is outstanding. I've got nothing more to say, except do not hesitate to pick this one up if you come across it."
"theres no alcohol presence in the taste or smell but the alcohol sure is in your blood."
"D - completely surprised by how different these offering were, yet both very enjoyable, with the 2009 being so sweet and the 2010 being so bitter and smoky, not sure how much difference the aging process made, maybe we'll have to grab both of these again along with a 2011 next year"
"D - I was super excited to be able to do this little 'experiment' and I was blown away by the differences. Apart for the appearance, these two vintages produced very different flavours and scents. Much like a fine wine, this one will not disappoint. This stuff really is tasty and aging does appear to increase the sweetness of it. Great porter and highly recommended to any porter fan!"
"Wow, a big beer but still drinkable and approachable, has enough complexity to keep you interested, but not so overwhelming that you don't want to check it off and walk away. Definitely an example of the style worth revisiting."
"D - A truly remarkable beer."
"April 1/2012 - 2011 Vintage Nose: Nose has some molasses and a woody notes. Taste is lightly tart, some cherry, roast, light smoke caramel, molasses and coffee/mocha notes in the finish. Mouthfeel is thinner than I remember, fairly rich however. Sticky, dry and sweet. Less impressive than I can recall, but still tasty and complex nonetheless. Alcohol is much an afterthought."
"As I drank it, I was reminded of why I chose this beer in the first place. The beer brought a party of classic flavors to my palate; it opens with creamy fudge-like espresso, very dry yet matly sweet the whole time, flowing with light spice, rummy alcohol which was tamed by a molasses sweetness, lots of roast across my cheeks, and a clean bitter finish. It was smooth and much lighter than I had expected from a beer of this stature; but all the flavors are so well balanced it makes perfect sense. The combination of coffee, chocolate, cream and a touch of black liquorice does make this beer among my favorite porters, and is a classic in my mind."
"Overall a good beer but the sweetness was a little cloying which made it hard to drink."
"D: Thanks again Zorprime, this is fantastic. This is an amazing porter and is extremely drinkable for the high alcohol content."
"On tap at Mondial, 2010. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Huge, dark beige head. Black body. Aroma of coffee and roasted malts with a ton of hops. ABV comes on a bit hot, slightly medicinal at first, but much better upon warming. Very interesting but not necessarily in a good way. I'm all for lots of flavor but not if the flavor isn't good. However...this one does get much better upon warming. More sweetness develops into almost an aged porter taste. Interesting."
"Flavor profile whacks you with a big chew on toasty-chocolaty-mocha malts, some sweetness...mid palate you get dried fruit and complexity....long wet finish with lush cocoa-bready-roasted husk tastes...totally hides the alcohol...far better than Okocim...magnificent!"
"This aids drinkability and the beer goes down quickly for such a high alcohol content. Mouthfeel is silky smooth."
"If you find this, buy a bottle. But don't go crazy - this isn't just any Baltic Porter - give it a try first and see if you can handle Les Trois Mousquetaires' interpretation!"
"Tastes as good as it smells if not better (if that's even possible). Lots of chocolate, chewy maltiness, some bitterness, coffee, alcohol and hints of fruit. Great mouthfeel creamy and smooth. Very drinkable glad I had this as my night cap."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black. Starts with a thick tan head and leaves a nice layer of head all the way down with some lacing. It smells of sweet chocolate. The taste is of bitter-sweet chocolate and maybe a bit of vanilla with roasted malt. This is delicious. Very smooth mouthfeel. Can notice the alcohol a little bit, but that should be expected with 10% abv."
"For its purported strength, this is dangerously crazy-easy to drink, the amped-up beyond belief porter smiling and smirking all the while. Roasted, fruity, nutty, pleasantly boozy, and well, lagery! I'm still not certain as to the ale/lager heritage of this style, but I would having no problem urging you to ignore that when pressing this to your lager-boy friends, when they sneer at the wine-bottle appearance of this kick-ass offering."
"2010 bottle: Dark black with some brown notes on the edge. I would say it is slightly less dark than the 2009 version. The head is similar and dissipates quickly. The aroma is coffee with some dark chocolate. On the taste side, cherry with some black chocolate. Slightly smoked. The bitterness is similar to an espresso. Complex. Superb. Excellent. One of the best Porter I've had so far. Can't wait for the 2011 version :)"
"One of the smoothest, most drinkable 10% beers I've had to pleasure to consume. I'm looking forward to polishing this 750ml off myself; I was worried that it could be tasking. You're not going to want to share this. Aged a couple years, I could see this being mind-blowing. It's place on the Canadian Top 25 is well-deserved."
"Tastes young. I think it would be better aged (label states: Grande Cuvée Automne 2009)."
"Overall an excellent beer, a great porter (which I prefer, by the way) and I just hope that the Trois Mousquetaires will continue to make beautiful beers like this one again and again!"
"These guys do exceptional lagers... even at this weight!"
"A delicious and complex beer, though extremely sweet."
"I get the feeling this one is going to head into Canada's top 25 once it gets enough reviews."
"With the wider distribution that 3M now is receiving, I look forward to the rightful acclaim that their special releases will get and deserve. This one is quite nice and makes me look forward to the dopplebock in the cellar!"
"D - This was a pretty good beer, but not as awesome as the other few reviews led me to believe. Still, a few of us killed the 750ml bottle pretty quick. I'd drink this one again."
"Edit- I'm drinking the 2009 vintage today (Jan, 13, 2014) and its standing the test of time with no problems. Well worth the wait and I think this could stand up to another couple years of age without diminishing. My early reviews with high scores wouldn't get the same marks from me today today, this ones an exception."
"Overall, one of the best brews I had the pleasure to taste."
"Pours pitch blakck with a copious head of rocky brown foam. Nose is boozy, molasses, anise, burnt grain, raisins and fruit. Lots of dark sugary flavours, moderate bitterness and a spicy/herbal edge. Apple and some dark, dried fruits come through as well. Very sweet, but not cloying. Pretty drinkable for a big beer. Mouthfel is smooth and not quite heavy. Does a really good job of being a big beer without being a mess of harsh flavours."
"Pours black with dark head. Taste is licorice, a little sourness. Solid porter with above average mouthfeel. Carbonation is apparent. Drinkable stuff, though not exceptional baltic porter. More mal than any coffee or chocolate."
"Overall, a pretty tasty beer and not your American style Baltic (Imperial) Porter. Possibly more true to the classic style other than the ABV. I'd definitely drink it again."
"Poured an hazy dark amber color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate citrus, fruit and spice aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet spicy flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration."
"Overall I really do not know what to say here. This was an extra, something I had never heard of, and it ended up being one of the best beers I have had in the last year at least .I need to see if more of this is around, as really I was blown away by this one."
"8/4/8/4/16/4.0"
"Black colored beer that pours nice. Brown edges with a lasting light tan head. Aromas showcases an array of complex dark malt notes. Flavor is very nice, with hints of sour fruit, chocolate, coffee and truffle. Lasting finish is also impressive. Very nice beer."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a medium size foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma consists of light black chocolate with some sweetness coming through. Taste is a mix between some black chocolate malt with a seriously dry ending. Full body with medium carbonation and no alcohol was apparent with some vinous notes without being cloying. I am not exactly sure what to make of this beer  different and not totally on style but still interesting nonetheless."
"bière totalement noire non-translucide, mousse brunâtre compacte, beaucoup d'effervescence. nez de torréfaction prononcé, la bouche est légère malgré l'alcool, on ne la sent pas du tout, goût torréfié, agréable."
