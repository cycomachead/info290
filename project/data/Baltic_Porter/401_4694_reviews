"Middle of the road porter. Many better options out there for the price. 2.5's are proper."
"Strong Baltic Porter.  Worth a try!  Drinkable."

"Strong and dense porter. There are not many nice beers in Russia, but this one is exception."
"On of the better porter beers I tried. Not to strong aroma and great taste"
"A bit oversweetened as others say, which definitely downplays drinkability, but still a solid offering from Baltika and one of my favourites from the brewery."
""
"O:  i really like this brew ... it's just a twinge different than most of the stout/porters I've tried, mainly in the first few sips when it almost seems like an English pale ale; good enough that I'll try it again from time to time; definitely among the fruitier if not the fruitiest stout/porter I've tried.  good brew."
""
"The taste is quite surprising as I would have not associated Russia with decent porter, but this was not the worst stout I ever had. I actually enjoyed drinking it. The taste is of dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt, not overwhelming and not a strong bitter tasting stout. In fact it had a little sweet taste upfront, with only light bitterness afterwards, well balanced. It was very smooth and very enjoyable to drink. Will be looking out for this one again in the future. Recommended, but be careful it is strong despite how smooth it goes down!"
""
"I've had a few of these now, and it is a good beer for the price. Tasty porter all around, but lacks much complexity and any outstanding nature. Better than Ol' Rasputin for sure, and way cheaper. Packs a decent punch with 7% ABV and sometimes serves as my morning donut replacement on Saturdays or Sundays. Much enjoyed for the price, but it you're looking for more complexity, you won't find it here. Regardless, it is still tantalizing to the taste buds and serves more than enough alcohol for dessert without getting too inebriated."

"Just okay. Nothing fancy. Kinda sweet. Expected it to taste a bit more interesting. But that's just because someone told me it rocks."

"My advice: drink this beer cold, like a Mich Golden Light. Once the tastes all gather around the fire, it’s barely fit for Jaimie Lannister’s table."
""
""
"I'm beginning to try more foreign beers, and I can get this one very easily because of the large Russian community nearby.  It's not quite as good as many craft breweries' porter, but it's not bad at all, and I'd get it again when I'm in the mood for a porter with my Russian food."

"16 oz bottle poured looking like Coca-cola, about the same carbonation, and no lacing left on the glass. Smells weakly of molasses and roasted malts, some yeast. Sweet tasting, almost like a milk stout. Light to medium body, watery mouthfeel. It's 7% abv is hidden nicely in the smooth taste but overall is a boring beer--- it is cheap so it has that going for it."

"Overall - Not a bad beer, a decent beer to knock off of your list if you were on a ""Beers of the World"" quest or something of that nature. Otherwise, there's 20 other porters I would recommend before this one at the same price point."

"Aroma is sweet and earthy. Pours a deep ruby brown with a creamy head.thehead does not linger, there is no lacing of the glass. A bit of an oily film.The taste is alcoholic dark fruit cake. A lingering but not unpleasant aftertaste on the tounge. A bit bitey upon warming. Decent but uninspiring overall."
""
""
""
"As far as I know, this was my first beer from Russia, and first from Baltika. It seems like this might be one of their best entries."
"Pours a dark hazy very deep brown, almost black in color, with a tan 1+-finger head that dissipates fast that leaves close to 1/2 finger tan head with nice lacing when sipped. Aroma is of chocolate and coffee. Taste about the same as the aroma and is very smooth actually with a nice sweet finish. Goes down easy with no bitterness at all! Really liked this one."

"O: Good drinkability. Smooth and pleasant Porter"
"500 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 4/7/2013. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, roasted malt, raisin, plum, herbal, light nuttiness, and yeast/toasty earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of dark/roasted malt and yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, roasted malt, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, herbal, and toast/yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish. Nice balance and solid complexity of dark/roasted malt and yeast ester flavors; with good robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good Baltic porter. Good balance and solid complexity of dark/roasted malt and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"A very nice porter that had a good balance with the relatively high abv. well hidden and the mouthfeel a good one. Initially it started quite sweet, almost like FES but this settled some not long after and the darker malts made themselves known."

"Overall: Not a bad beer, but by no means anything special. Good because it's cheap (only $2 for a 500mL bottle!) and does have plenty more flavor than comparable low-cost options, such as Guinness Draught."

"Early 2013 Rating. 500 ml. bottle @ home. Bottled on 12.10.2012. Picked up in one of those “Russian”-type of stores / deals. Pours a touch lighter shade of black with a non-lasting mocha head. Nose is sweet syrup, light licorice, roasted malts, overripe dark fruits and a touch of chocolate. Taste is sweet syrup, light bitterness, coffee, licorice, iron bitterness / pale lager hop extracts style, caramel, light roast, black bread, cocoa, hopextract and syrup being listed as ingredients comes as no surprise. Bit thin, touch syrup body. Almost like a fine dunkel. In a beer wasteland this stuff must be divine. Probably what a beer geek would drink if for some odd reason he wound up in Russia."

"I have often seen the inexpensive Baltika beers at the store and viewed them as a cheap higher alcohol beer with not much to offer. A friend turned me on to the Baltika 6 a told me that it is actually a really good porter and one they covet. I figured for two bucks it was worth a try! The Baltika 6 is a Baltic Porter which are typically strong and sweet and the 6 is no exception. It poured a dark brown to black with a thin tan head. The first taste was instantly molasses, dark and sweet. The sweetness remained as it warmed, but the molasses relaxed a bit with a fuller malt profile. An impressive beer nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Fairly impressive. It doesn't taste cheap, like the #4. Besides the ashtray kind of taste this is a decent porter."
"Eh. Not much good to say about it. Looks pretty good but I don't like the flavor or over carbonation."
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish black with no lacing and a 2 finger head that flattens immediately. The nose is booze, dark roast acidity, molasses,raisins, some leather. The taste is a big letdown with booze and burnt coffee dominating the flavors. The aftertaste is astringent and bitter like tea bags. Dry and unpleasant. The mouthfeel is very thin and feels over carbonated. Not at all impressed with this porter and I will not be having it again."
""
"O: Bottom line Its a good porter, and at 7% it doesn't tastes strong, its malty and yummy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A bit over the top in alcohol flavor and aroma, but nice, rich malt character. The esters are slightly overwhelming, and chocolate flavor is lacking. Not a bad brew, though. May lay one down a couple years to see what happens."
""

"A decent Baltic porter, certainly one of the better Russian beers. But there is room for improvement, even at $2.19 for 1/2L bottle."

"I first had all the Baltikas when I was travelling in Russia and the numbering system was great since we didn't speak much Russian. I distinctly remember liking #'s 6 & 9 and a friend found the 6 and brought it over to relive the experience. It was as good as I remember and nice to know it actually was a porter since I was just guessing. I like the color and aroma - I get a few hits of cocoa and coffee in the taste and I think the finish is nice and smooth and even a little thick - I pleasantly try to suck some of the flavor off the sides of my mouth. I like this one and I think it's my favorite out of Russia."

"I would recommend it (as opposed to some others from the Baltika family), careful not to compare this to turbinated US Baltic porters or similar Brewdogs."
""
""
""

"Pours a fairly opaque black color with a huge tan head that persists forever in fact it tried to escape from the bottle when I pried the cap off. The aroma is dark fruity with caramel and burnt sugars and a hint of chocolate with a touch of alcohol. Sweet grainy honey like pilsener malt surprisingly shines through. The flavor follow the aroma quite well. Sweet grainy pilsner with some dark and burnt sugars touched off with some chocolate and some sweet sugar coated dark fruits. Long lingering sweet finish with a touch of ethanol. Medium body with a sweet slick mouthfeel and a moderate level of carbonation. Not a bad porter, certainly not over the top flavored like some Americanized versions, but kind of nice with it's subtleties."
"Dark near black with little foam at all - not attractive really. Smells of raisin, malt, cocoa, and some toasted malts, kinda sweet but I like it. Bread, rye, more plum than anything, some toasted malts, some tobacco and a touch of turbinado. Medium on thin with low carb and an off dry finish. Overall not bad, I would drink again."

"The beer is good, but not great. It is a daily drinking porter, and I would buy this again, but only for the price. It's a good example of baltic porter, but I don't have a ton of experience with these. Every brewing company makes a porter… but few make a baltic porter. Maybe this is a European thing. I will do some digging before we get to our next baltic porter. Cheers!"

"appears black, opaque. thick khaki colored head. good head retention. smells like milk chocolate, maybe some earthy hops. mild aroma. taste is just a slightly roasted flavor.very smooth and mild, one flavor note. medium thick body, medium to higher carbonation. overall - just okay."

"O - a very average porter."
""

"O - Pretty basic brew, perhaps the 7 months past due had a negative effect on the favor. I would return to it given the right occasion because hell; its $2 a bottle."
""
""
"O - A very smooth, fruity, honey sweet strong porter."
""
""
"Overall - Not a particularly strong Baltic porter, and it could benefit from more pronounced darker flavors, but it's the smoothest Baltic I've had to date. Unfortunately that smoothness does little when it becomes too rich to enjoy."
"O-This is good beer,i will drink it often."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an ok porter but it leaves quite a bit to be desired. The flavors are pretty muted and it is a little too sweet for my tastes. Gets to be a bit cloying after awhile. Glad I was able to try this although I doubt I will pick it up again."
""
""
"O: Very thin in body for a baltic porter and seems to lack the vinous notes that I expect for the style. The taste of this beer is quite pleasant and the alcohol is well hidden. Easy to drink and enjoyable."
"O: This beer is quite light in body and watery compared to other beers in the style, but this makes it relatively easy to drink. No traces of alcohol are present in the taste."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Really nice dark appearance with a dense and substantial foamy head, and some fair lacing. Nose is roasted malt with nutty and chocolate components. Flavor is heavy combination of roasted coffee, cocoa, and nuts. Pungent with a funky lingering aftertaste. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
""
"Beer is medium-bodied with medium to medium-low intensity of carbonation. Resulting mouthfeel is generally smooth and slightly creamy. Beer closes out with a semi-dry finish and some mild stickiness on the palate and lips."
""
""
"A fine example of the Baltic Porter style: It is not heavy, and the focus is on the malts."
""
"500ml bottle served in a standard pint glass. 27.06.11 indicated on the back label. Pours the color and clarity of cola with a 1.5 inch khaki-colored head that sizzles and pops and slowly recedes into a sudsy skim. Nose expresses dark, vinous fruits, lager yeast and a hint of oxidation. Taste follows nose; however, it all comes off a bit watered down with a very assertive German-lager skunk that lingers between quaffs. There's also a trace of toffee and roast mixed into the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body with a pleasant, even carbonation and a slight acidity. Overall, decent and drinkable. Not the best example of the style, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down if offered. I'd like to try this again with a fresher bottle as the label suggests that its best by date is 27.06.12, which is only a few weeks away."
""
""
"500 ml. bottle, pours a dark colour, brown hints when hold to the light, and a big brownish head that fades quickly. Smell of cofee, chocolate and cherries, though it's not really a strong smell. Maybe too light body for the style, taste of caramel and coffee, with hints of cherries. Too sweet. Not bad, but nothing special either."
""
""
""

""

"O: Average. I'll drink it again, but won't actively seek it. I'd probably recommend it, if not just for the fact that it isn't a bad beer."
"O - Enjoyed very much."
"O: This isn't bad but it also isn't good. it is just too sweet for this guy."
""

"Out of a bomber allll the way from Russia this beer was a nearly opaque brown color with one finger of short-lived, tan head. The aroma was of macro grains, toasted malt, a little brown sugar and carmeleized sugars as well as some slightly roasted elements. I instantly thought it an odd beer upon tasting because it seemed to walk that line between a macro brew and a good homebrew. I tasted a strong amount of adjunct grains, corn and rice in particular, but behind that the more complex elements of nuts, toasted and roasted malt, some extra sugars (sucanat? molasses?) and bread. The finish of roasted malt lingered pleasantly upon my tongue. The mouthfeel was so-so, the body medium/full and the carbonation a bit high for my tastes."
"O: This was really good porter. Very smooth, well balanced, and tasty. Lots of alcohol but went down easy."
"O- I bought this expecting to get the feel for what a true Baltic Porter is. Obviously, I was mistaken."
"Still overall though it doesn't seem to be that desirable to me in terms of others of the style, or just other beers available. It's certainly not that bad and you could do a lot worse. In a worse case of also ran beers in your typical establishment, if I had this as a choice I would have it."
"D- decent porter, aside from the stale malt flavor which could be from any number of things. Alcohol is imperceptible."
"Medium-heavy bodied. Dry palate. Very light on carbonation."

"Solid example of the style, if not a little too sweet. Enjoyed revisiting, but I don't ever have to have this again."
""
""
""
"O: Didn't find it quite as sweet as most; I consider this one to be better than average for the style and definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Fits the style guidelines and while not the best Porter i've had its still a great traditional style Porter. Can't understand the relatively low scores to be honest, since it has alot of soul and quality (to style and subjectively speaking.) I think the fact it comes from a pretty mediocre brewery makes for a strong power of suggestion effect."

"Past experience has left me with low expectations for this brewery, so this rather mediocre porter was actually better than expected. If you like your porters on the lighter side, taste wise, but with the alcohol showing through, you may like this one."
"Appearance has a very dark brown rich color with a fair head that dissapates leaving spotty lace. Smell of lightly sweet roasted malts and dark fruits and molassas. Taste is faded in compexity, but still has lightly sweet roasted malts, coffee and a dark fruit note. Mouthfeel is medium-light with good carbonation. Not a bad porter, but needs a little more complexity and body."
"Overall I had NO IDEA what to expect going in. I had never seen Baltika before, and had not had a Baltic Porter prior to this bottle, it just happened to be pretty cheap at the liquor store around the corner, so I figured I'd check it out. I would consider drinking it again (especially as it is one of the cheaper non-shitty beers at that location that comes in this size bottle), but wouldn't necessarily make a trip just for it. Check it out if you come across it, but you don't need to go out of your way."
"O - I would certainly drink this again, but not seek it out specifically (perhaps a bottle within it 'best before' range). I'm looking for syrupy with minimal carbonation, and enough malt and sweet to balance that roast."
"Overall, this was a decent beer that makes me want to explore the style a bit. Getting to the bottom of it was a bit slow going though, probably due to the sweetness."
"O-had a brewed on date of 9-2-11 so it is fresh and good flavors I might get a few of these to keep on hand"
"Been in Kyrgyzstan for a few months now, this is the main brewery offered in the country, so it's everywhere. Pours dark, with hints of mahagony. Decent tannish head that hangs around for a good amount of time, not too much lacing. The coffee smell isn't as apparent as I would like, but still present. Slightly smoking, and a hint of chocolate. Taste is a little better than the smell. Strong smokey feature, choclate, wood, coffee, and a little grainy. Decent carbonation, but would have liked it to be a little more full than it is. Overall it's an average beer, if youre into Baltika, this one would be my favorite out of all of them."
"Smoky aroma has a strong tone of molasses, as well as a woody hint, and a fair amount of sweetness. It pours a deep opaque sable with a thick tan head that vanishes rather quickly. Flavor has tones of smoked wood, coffee and molasses. Body is on the thin side, and the fizz is only slight, so it is more like soda pop than beer. Still, an acceptable porter."
"O – Really solid Baltic here. Has a nice array of flavor and is surprisingly drinkable even at its ABV. No complaints here I will be having more of these."
"O: Excellent. This is exactly what I was hoping this beer would smell/taste like. From what I know about this style, I love it and I want more. Now that I know I can get this locally, it’s definitely going to be a regular in my fridge. Mmmmm 4"
"Appearance 3.5/5; Aroma 3/5; Taste 2/5; Mouthfeel 3.5/5; Overall 2/5"
"Truthfully, giving this a ""C" may be going easy on it. I'm going to pour out my glass. I just am interested in trying another beer, and I'm not interested in finishing this one."
"O: A decent porter. Not in the same class as Founders or Fullers...despite the style difference. OK...but not a regular rotation worthy beer."
"Again, not going to break it down. I found this to be a very boring porter. Thin, watery flavors. Just not very interesting. It's not bad, and I would welcome one on a hot day if nothing else was available, but there are tons of porters out there that are much better, in my opinion."
"Overall this is a good beer however not really a beer that I would seek out again."
"T: was expecting something thicker, tiny sweet notes at first, then the toast takes full strenght, bitterness, long tasting end"
"What an amazing Russian brew!! This bad boy pours up a deep dark brown (almost black) body sporting a huge four-finger tan frothy head. Head retention was a good as it stayed with the brew as it reduced down to about a one-finger head. The smell was just as amazing with wisps of dark chocolate, cocoa powder, and something akin to roasted hazelnuts. The flavors just add to the symphony of delight; dark chocolate, cocoa powder (like taking cocoa powder and adding just a tad bit of water to make a paste and eating it!), caramel, warm bread, plums, raisins, a twinge of hops, cloves, and more! This brew is full bodied (but not too thick) and no real detection of alcohol. Definitely not a session brew as this one is made to be savored very slowly as I found the tastes and smells just amassed as the brew slowly warmed up. Something that could easily be enjoyed all year long, I can see this one being especially comforting on those wintry days spent by the fireside."
"This beer poured out as a nice dark brown color with a light tan color. The head was creamy and semi-thick looking. The lacing was minimal. The smell of the beer has a decent roasted aroma. The taste of the beer was also smooth roasted and has a good bitterness. The mouthfeel was soft and light carbonated. Overall it's not the best Baltic Porter but it wasn't too bad."
"Slight sourish hint. Rather bitter after a few tastes. Highly roasted malt, not much trace of sweetness. Big head, lots of coarse carbonation. Nicely watery and refreshing mouthfeel. Typical dark brown color. Nose is more like wet cardboard. Drinkable but not much pleasure in it."
"I'm really disappointed with this. I've liked most porters I've had and I recently read this was voted the best porter in the world (don't recall where I read that) but this beer provided little of anything that would make me think that."
"Cheers..."
"A milder porter with more laidback tastes, if you don't want a really strong porter, this would be a good option."
"Overall: A nice change of pace porter."
"Great beer for the money. An easy drinking beer. Good Euro-china representation of the beer although this is where this style got it's name. Definitely different from an English or American porter."
"Overall a very enjoyable beer with a fuitcake-like aroma and a rich mouthfeel. I paid $2 for the half liter bottle, and I considered it to be a great value."
"O/D - Good flavour but a tad mild. Nothing wrong but nothing exciting, just a slightly above average Baltic Porter."
"O: I liked the beer. True to style. I'd like to do a side by side with Black Boss. Nice desert accompaniment. Just didn't knock my socks off."
"a very standard and legitimit form that lacks in one dimensional malting. Looks the part with some subdued carbonation. Smooth... Too simple... And subtle sweet more so then anything. Easy drink. And a proper smoky note. Lacks the acidic note of toasted leather saddle of hint of aging. Candy in the baltic porter world."
"Dark brown, near black, ruby in the light, slight off white/tan head. Smell is of deep malt, light alcohol, touch of coffee, leather and roasted bitter notes. Taste is roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee notes, dark cherry and light alcohol. Thin to medium mouthfeel, typical of porter, creamy, medium carbonation. Really good, very enjoyable and probably the best thing out of this brewery."
"O: A pretty decent Baltic porter, especially for the very low price. I wish it were a bit more full-bodied and that the flavor had as much complexity as the nose."
"Seems a bit light-bodied, but the flavor profile is somewhat unique. Drinks silky-smooth, with a slight hint of fruit. I get some alcohol, too. Seems very overly sweet, almost in line with a doppelbock. Not bad, but not one I'd pursue again, given there are much more complex porters out there."
"1 pint .9oz bottle. Pours a very dark brown with light brown hues and a big frothy head. Decent amount of lacing. Aromas of roasted malts, molasses, and alcohol. Slightly sour. Flavor is of molasses, dark fruits, and booze. Sour dark fruit aftertaste with more of that warming alcohol. A bit light and thin. This beer is alright. It was right around $2 and packs a decent punch. Overall it's worth grabbing every so often but if I never had it again I wouldn't be upset."
"A nice beer and my first of the style."
"D-A decent attempt at the style, but the mouthfeel was very disappointing and the flavor profile was average at best."
"Dark, cocoa brown with a fizzle of head that lasts for awhile but eventually burns out. Rough, roasted grain, bitter cocoa, and diner coffee mingle with burnt sugar, toffee, and raisin. Powerful in terms of strength and a bit coarse (not necessarily a bad thing on bitterly cold night). Fruitiness from the yeast goes slightly unchecked while hops seem rustic and mostly just lend a firm bitterness. A touch of sourness trails at the end. I'm guessing this a fairly authentic example. Certainly not an elegant brew, but still pretty tasty."
"Overall this is a fine beer and a nice change of pace from the hoppy and bitter brews I've been drinking."
"OVERALL - This is what craft beer is supposed to incite in drinkers; a wonderful flavor and an obvious earmark of careful consideration, expertise and pride in craftsmanship on the part of the brewer. I highly recommend Baltika #6 as both an excellent starting point for those who are interested in trying dark beers and as a new staple in the routine samplings of dark beer lovers."
"Pours an almost opaque crimson red/black with a nice 2 inch tan head that fades to an oily film on the top of the beer. Fair ring lacing on the drink down. Smells like caramel and dark roasted malt. Very sweet caramel and roasted malt taste. Almost an artificial sweetness. There is a very small amount of bitterness after each sip. There is also a pronounced metallic quality in the taste of this beer. This beer is a bit flat and watery in the mouth. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and I believe this is my first Russian beer ever. I might revisit this one in the future, especially for the $1.99 I paid for the bottle."
"Poured thin black with a white & tan head. Aromas of hard water, licorice, roasted malt and dirt. Flavor was excellent, black licorice being the dominant factor here. Also nice hop bitterness and maltiness. Finished nice, with average carbonation and a very slight alcohol warming. Solid beer, benchmark style."
"Nothing particularly unique or noteworthy about this beer, but it's solid all around, no off flavors and it's incredibly drinkable. Cool bottle too."
"Pours a dark brown colour with creamy tan head that dissipates fairly quickly without much lacing. Smells of chocolate and roasted malt, quite nice. Sweet chocolate flavour, with hints of a fruitiness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but it still is nice enough. I'm surprised how nice this beer is given how bad the rest of the Baltika beers I've had were."
"D - Is this really a porter? Sure doesnt seem like it. Definately drinks like a Weizenbock. Not sure if its like this due to age or what."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. I purchased a 16.9 ounce bottle for $1.99 at Total Wine and will definitely be purchasing this again."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts. Taste is also big on roasted malts, not much else going on, not very complex. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a decent beer."
"D: Overall a nice porter and one of Baltika's better brews."
"Pours dark brown with thick cascading brown foam. One thick inch of foam remains. Roasted smell, dark chocolate. Some coffee. Smooth (very) taste. Cocoa powder dark taste. Lots of coffee. Very light carbonation. Supremely drinkable. Outstanding porter."
"in general a pretty good find. A little sweet for my taste but has a very good mouthfeel and is very drinkable."
"Very good, too rich to drink a lot of though. Feels stronger than it is. But well worth trying."
"Drinkability: Good, but I probably wouldn't have a whole lot in one sitting just because of the very strong flavors. That being said, I think it's delicious."
"Poured very dark, even for Porter standards. Nice 3/4"" foam that disappeared fairly quickly. Very light lacing, practically none at all. Rich malty smell and roasted coffee, pleasant to whaff at. Mouthfeel a little on the light side, taste is wonderful, very easy to drink. Has a molasses kick at the end. The highpoints are a great taste and very drinkable. The low points is that its not all that complex and kinda thin...but thats ok by me."
"D-mmm this is a great beer. congrats to the russian brewery, i didn't know they had it in them. the tastes stay and the bottle size is perfect for one person!"
"For all its oddities, this is a reasonably pleasant beer. It has a lot of smoothness and a wide swathe of flavours on the palate. Love the complexity, even if the complexity means it ends up a little anarchic."
"Enjoyable, worth picking up now and again. Certainly among Baltika's better offerings. A good representation for the style - the fruity tart tones and softer coffee/chocolate notes definitely help distinguish this from English porter fare. Though it doesn't hold up to be as hearty and burly as one might expect from a Russian porter, it still does the trick for me on a rainy New Years Eve. Cheers all!"
"This beer is pretty smooth and not bitter at all, has a little more carbonation than I prefer, but is very drinkable. I really enjoy the licorice aftertaste that lingers around."
"As you may well already know from trying one yourself - or from what you should know, it having been conveyed in this review - Baltic porters are a very distinct style. And I'm glad that despite the size of their operations and the need for mass market sales, Baltika still brews theirs that way. If you want a real taste of the Baltic - and you're not really in the mood for pickled herring or stewed cabbage - then do explore what Baltika 6 has to offer."
"Poured a slow to emerge head which rose to 2"" then after quite a while dissipated to 1/8"". Dard as coffee. Smell has barley malt. Taste is very mild, like a sweet coffee pie, and maybe a hint of chocolate. Really a pretty decent beer, thoroughly enjoyable. Milder than a lot of other porters though (unless that's just the aging from being shipped so far). Good but not great."
"Drinkability - this is going down nice on a chilly night, for $1.89 a 500ml bottle, this is really good value. I'm glad I tried it and wouldn't hesitate to get another"
"D - pretty good beer here. I don't know what else to compare it to as far as Baltic Porters are concerned, but for the price I would definitely purchase this again."
"Poured a very dark brown, with a fair amount of tan foam that disapated after a short while. The smell of roasted malts with a slight burnt coffee aromoa and a hint of spice. The flavor was of roasted malts, bitter/coffee, sweet/spices and a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. The finish was long and pleasant with a very good aftertaste on the palate. What a pleasant surprise!"
"Pours a deep brownish black color with a thick russet colored head and a huge amount of lacing. Smells of roasted malts with subdued coffee notes. Tastes a little rancid to start, but after that is a little of the following well balanced together: coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, and smokiness. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Drinkability is high."
"D - Very drinkable and approachable porter! Moderate complexity tasting with a good mouthfeel; Russian goodness that made my evening. (4.5)"
"It's fairly drinkable. Definitely the best beer I have had from the Baltika line. It's not a great porter, but I think this bottle was like $2.19. Definitely worth trying at least once."
"D - Well, it's cheap and it's not horrid or anything; I'd suggest trying it to just about anyone, but it's no fancy RIS..."
"D - Fine baltic porter, high drinkability and the large Russian population here in N. suburbs of Chicago, this beer is quite easy to pick up."
".5L bottle. Dark brown hue with a small, tanned, creamy head and nice lacing. Rich aroma of dark fruit, chocolate malt and molasses. Full, creamy, slightly tangy body. A lot of dark fruit, bread, chocolate malt and molasses on the palate. Long, port like finish. Great, easy drinking porter. Love it."
"For the price it's a good choice. $2.39 a bottle at Hy Vee Stony Brook."
"Baltika #6 Porter is nearly black in colour but has a slightly red hue when held to the light. It has a good one finger head that lasts ages. A handsome porter. The smell is of roasty malt with a hint of alcohol and some yeast. The taste is aggressively malty with sharp bitter coffee. There is some dark chocolate flavour in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and surprisingly unfoamy given the style and appearance."
"D- this beer is great to look at but not very good to drink. There are definitely worse ones out there but I won't be getting this again."
"D - fantastic really fantastic I want this on a cold night. Wrapped in a blanket minus twenty outside and me with this beer."
"It has a real dark used motor oil black color. Very little if any light shines through. The light that does make it through has a red tint to it. The head is a light frothy tan color. The nose has a nice rich chocolate to it but absolutely nothing else. The taste is very similar. I can't tell if it is really soft or just thin. It's difficult to differentiate between the two. Some of the chocolate notes come through on the tongue but not much. The second sip shows that this beer is just really thin and more watered down. I don't get much of a finish. It's kind of a boring beer but not terrible."
"Very nice porter. I'd buy it again with no hesitation."
"Decent enough to wash down my Spanish chorizo and feta cheese pizza. Given its one-year best-before date, it may improve with cellaring."
"Drinkability is nice. Subtle but tasty easy drinking porter, goes down much easier than the 7% ABV suggests."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a dark chocolate color similar to cola and a nice 2 finger milk chocolate head that settles nice to a thin cap leaving minimal lacing. The aroma is yeasty with some slight burnt malts, a little prune and some chocolate. The taste is thin and not very full of flavor. There is some slight dark fruit and a little malt, but nothing of chocolate or or caramel as expected. The body is medium and carbonation is moderate. Not the best example of a porter I have had but maybe a bad bottle?"
"I like Porters, and this is a good example."
"Nice interpretation and a decent cool weather sipper. Would be great with some homemade chocolate chip cookies!"
"Not half bad, it sits in the middle of the pack. A little complex, yet a whole bottle is almost too much; share it with a friend, and sip. All of that said, it is certainly worth a try."
"Just the right amount of sweetness for a non-coffee or roast dominant flavor porter, nice change of pace from my usual preference. Will definitely try Baltika's other dark offerings."
"This is sampled on September 9, 2010 from the 25 fl. oz. bottle marked 30.08.09-30.08.10w. It pours a mahogany-brown color with ruby red highlights and a decent, thick but soft tan head that leaves a good amount of lacing. It lingers for awhile. The aroma mixes and matches yeast, dark malts, vague hops and something that really reminded me of cream corn(!). A good medium body. Dark, burnt cocoa, chocolate fudge, caramel malts, and molasses syrup stand out in the taste. This porter does not have a smoky character like many but it has a likeable character of its own."
"It also pretty easy to slug down if you can get around the taste. This is the last time I take my 365 Beers page-a-day calendar's advice on a beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, but one of the beers that I've had in the style but it's still solid enough to drink for a while."
"Drinkability -- Meh. A bit of a letdown. Very simple, very sweet. I don't necessarily mind sweet beers, but there wasn't much of anything going on with this one. Was hoping for this to be a bit of a sleeper, but to no avail. C'est La Vie..."
"Not much complexity here. It is a little too sweet, but would work in a porter pinch."
"Some stale graininess creeps into the flavor and is something I have noticed pretty regularly with Baltika brews, even relatively fresh samples. Roasty, coffee-like bitterness balances well with the sweetness. Body is a bit thin for the level of alcohol it boasts. Not bad, one of the better Baltikas along with the wheat. Good price at $2 for a 500 mL, makes a great grab and go drinker with some flavor. While it is no way an outstanding representation of the style, I have a strong feeling this wont be my last #6 porter."
"This makes a good porter staple in any budget conscious beer diet without sacrificing in terms of taste, and I strongly recommend it."
"D: I split this half-liter bottle with my wife, but I could easily have one (or two!) by myself. I suspect the alcohol would sneak up eventually."
"It pours black with a slight translucence. A good layer of light tan foam forms but dissipates to a thin lace. The taste is a little on the lighter side compared to most porters. It is not too thick and is very drinkable. It is not the best porter out there, but for what I've been paying, I have been very satisfied. This is one of my go-to beers when I do not have much money but still want to drink a decent Baltic porter. It is worth a try."
"this is a really good example, and though it falls short of the very best the style has to offer, I'd have it again in a heartbeat. It's cheap too!"
"Thick and heavy, not tasty enough to make it worthwhile. Too sweet and too dominated by licorice (I personally dislike licorice)."
"Overall: fat as flat cola, strong and silent in its fortitude, this porter runs smoother (and more dangerously) than its English namesake--a pleasure to drink in the company of winter..."
"DB- Good price for a pint. Body sort of throws it off. Good flavor and worth a shot."
"Pours an almost back color with a 2 finger tan head that lasts for a little bit and leaves some lacing. The smell is sweet, dark fruit--raisons, chocolate, dark liquorish, and caramel. The taste is the most heavy on dark liquorish with dark chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits al very noticeable. They blend together very well. The mouthfeel is very creamy and rich, and its pretty drinkable as well. I enjoyed this beer very much, a lot more than many other people who rated it."
"This isn't a very flavorful representation of the style."
"Decent medium-bodied mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: This is, to my surprise, quite a good beer. Also, it was only about $2 for the bottle at my local Spec's, so this beer is very good for its price. Definitely worth a try, given the price."
"Even an innocent, safe pour gets you close to three fingers of light tan head, loose and easily dissolved, close to zero lacing. Just to that side of opacity, black trumps brown in the final round, quite clean appearance, ring of dark mahogany and orange around the rims. The nose is sort of annoyingly light but comes up with milk chocolate, coffee candy, golden raisin, apricot, pear scents, unusually lacking in darker fruit, very little roast to it, brush of ginger spice, the hoppiness stiffens things before its final dissolve. Light-bodied, comes across as somewhat watery for a porter, the lack of body here does bring the roast to the fore as it is needed to buttress the cocoa, chocolate, caramel shades. In the same vein, lemon to orange citrus comes forth, accompanied by a brown sugar dusting. The grains, oats and breadiness swell slightly in the middle. Raisin, date, cherry, apricot, a good mix of flavors but needs more richness. All in all, it's a chuggable summertime porter that luckily enough is priced right for its station."
"Overall, not super complex, but a solid, good tasting porter. Unlike other reviewers, I don't find its sweetness is out of hand. It would score higher if its slight toastiness was closer to a robust roastiness, but I liked this beer, especially considering the price point."
"Overall this a good beer - not great - but very good - Would be a bit more drinkable if it were a bit less sweet. I think this would be a great cold weather porter though. I will probably be picking this one up more just because of theses great home brewing bottles they come with. and all for around $2 - not too shabby."
"All in all, a great Baltic porter, great import, great beer"
"Different, but not the best Baltic Porter I've had by a long way."
"Notes - Medium mouthfeel"
"Its just a rough trip all around, make sure you have some others to help you split it, or a drain pour could happen."
"Pours reminds me of a pour from a 2 liter Dr. Pepper bottle that was opened a week ago. It's dark, flat black. Nose is better than the appearance with some decent roasted maltiness and a little hidden smoke. The taste is undewhelming until the very end where there is a nice bit of roasted malt flavor. Mouth feel is meh. A fun beer to drink with friends, but not overly enjoyable."
"Drinkability: An overly sweet and unbalanced Baltic porter. A beer that I most likely would not turn down, but not the first I would choose either. The alcohol is well hidden."
"Pours a clear very dark reddish brown with a big tan head. Very light colored for a strong porter. Smells of roasted nuts. Taste is decent, very light considering the ABV, a decent amount of roasted malt flavor, very little hop flavor or bitterness. Mouthfeel is good, low carbonation and very little alcohol detected. Drinkability is good though, light and refreshing for a porter, though not as flavorful as many other examples IMO."
"Poured from a 16.9 ounce bottle. Poured almost black with a quickly disappearing head. Huge amounts of flavor. Very sweet dark chocolate flavors, heavy malts along with a slight burnt/roasted malts flavor at the end. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. Some barleywine scents in the nose of the beer. Mouthfeel is smooth. Pretty drinkable in my mind. I am enjoying this far more than I thought I would. So far the best of the Baltika beers that I have tried."
"Pours a nearly opaque dark brown with garnet highlights and about a finger's worth of foamy ecru head. The nose is molasses, pine, maple syrup, spruce, brown sugar, and dark malts. Some very faint floral notes are also lurking somewhere in the distance. The taste emphasizes the pine and spruce and really brings the florals out from the shadows. The darker aspects are still there, with the molasses and brown sugar leading the way, but they are much more balanced with the other elements than in the nose. The body is a firm medium, with a healthy dose of carbonation and a smooth feel, all leading to a very high drinkability."
"Pours out like cola with a small tan head and light lacing. Getting some chocolate and caramel in the aroma and a hint of fruit. Flavor is a little off putting. Chocolate is kinda there, some licorice, slightly herbal, a bit of raisin, and a touch of dry yeast on the finish. There's also an odd metaallic taste that's kind of like sucking on a dirty penny. Nothing spectacular about this brew, just wanted to try it. Prob won't be having it again."
"Poured a 500ml bottle into my Dogfish Head snifter. This beer pours a rich burnt coffee brown with a 2-inch coffee and cream cap that leaves oily lacing down the sides of the glass. This is the third in the numbered series I've had from Baltika. The first two were less then stellar to say the least. This one is starting off much better then the rest. The aroma is semi sweet bakers chocolate, dates, raisins, cream, and caramel. Wow, the aroma is pretty top notch. The bar has been raised. The flavor profile follows suit with bitter dark chocolate leading the way. Subtle toffee notes follow with dates and figs coming though also. A hint of oats come and roasted grains. This is a really well rounded beer. Rather tasty. At the very end of the flavor profile comes sweet raisins. The mouthfeel is odd. Unlike any other beer I've ever had. If starts really creamy. Almost as if they mashed with oats. Coats the mouth with dark chocolate, then comes the odd thing. This beer finishes really, really dry. Reminds me more of a finish on saison then a porter. Creamy and dry, it's a rather odd combination of sensations. While not my first rodeo with Baltika beers, it definitely is the best ride I've had. Changes my mind about beer that comes out of the Motherland."
"The body is pretty light, and the carbonation mild. Not watery, but not too inspiring, kinda like the beer."
"This is an average baltic porter, although I'd like to try a fresher one some day."
"Strong pour produces a fluffy head that looks like the foam on the shallows of the Ohio river, stiff and silty-brown with nuclear waste bubbles and an oily sheen. The nose strikes a balance between over-roasted malt and macro-lager rice stench. What really disappoints is the taste; a bad dark beer with all the worst parts of a bad light beer. Really similar to kvass, unsurprisingly. Creepy weird aftertaste and a weak mouthfeel, nothing like the robustness of a good porter."
"Pours brown-black with deep red edges and a big fizzy light cream colored head that quickly dissolves into a thin layer atop the glass. The aroma is slightly skunky, DMS, roast and a little chocolate. The flavor is sweet chocolate forwards with some toffee, roast and finishes dry with some alcohol presence. Its light-medium bodied with a fizzy amount of carbonation. I'm not exactly sure why I was smelling the DMS but it was certainly the most noticeable aroma of this beer, the flavor was nice but not complex in the least and the body felt a little thin for the style. Probably wouldn't seek this out again although it is a cheap Baltic Porter that is readily available."
"I certainly was not expecting this when I picked this up at the store. This is my first beer from Russia and my first Baltic porter, and I was not disappointed in the least. Solid flavor and an awesome mouthfeel make this an easy drinker, even with 7% alcohol. It gets the job done and it looks good doing it, too. Long story short, if you see this around, pick it up and give it a shot. I'm glad I did."
"This is my first Russia from Baltika, so I had to they it. I'd give another Baltika style a try but this one this did not make the mark to me."
"D - I could drink this all night."
"Cheers"
"This is the first beer I have had from a St. Petersburg brewery. Too bad it is from the other St. Petersburg."
"A touch thinner than expected, a thin/medium body. Light effervesce. Overall, a good beer but would surely like it a bit chewier, although, several is definitely doable."
"Served in a pint bottle. The smell is murky with a hint of light fruitiness. The beer gives a chocolate, malt taste that is more palatable after a few sips, but the amazingly the burnt taste blends into the aftertaste. Feels highly carbonated on the tongue, but beer slides good down the throat with a slightly heavy weight. Mainly enjoyed the well-balanced burnished taste, but could do without the overall message the beer gives to one's taste buds that it has a manufactured taste."
"Very slick and creamy with low carbonation."
"The flavor of this beer was just not very good. Either this guy is not adequately built for the voyage, or it is just a sub-par beer. Did not enjoy this."
"Black beer with tan monolithic big high-resistent head, poor smell of roasted malt and burnt sugar. Flat, unexpressive taste of malt and chocolate, rather sweet. Well hidden alcohol and medium carbonation. A bit metallic neutral aftertaste. Not recommended!"
"Pours black with a good sized head. Nice lacing on the surface and sides. Smell is roasted and burnt malt. Taste has a pleasant chocolately sweetness throughout. Some bitterness from the dark malt also goes well- like bitter chocolate. Very tasty. Medium to full bodied. Fairly drinkable. This would be a really good desert beer. Sweet and chocolaty."
"M: Thick and creamy. The sweetness limits the drinkability for me."
"Pours dark brown with a beige head. The aroma is mainly roasted malt with some coffee. The flavor is heavy on the roasted malt. Not as much coffee or chocolate in the flavor as I was expecting. The alcohol is well hidden. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. Fairly cream finish."
"Drink ability was above average. Wasnt very impressed by this beer. It was pretty rough around the edges, wouldnt buy again"
"Sweet, strong and not subtle. A good benchmark for the style, but not the best example."
"Bottle- Deep cola brown with a frothy mocha cap that laces well. Nose of coffee beans, vanilla, dark rum, dark chocolate, a bit of molasses. Tastes pretty sweet, of roasty malts, burnt toast, bittering hops, a bit woody. Has a bit of a metallic edge that detracts from the flavour a bit but thankfully it is only minor. Sweet malty finish, with roasty bitter aftertaste. Overall very good"
"D: I was pleasantly surprised by how good this beer is. Especially given the price ($1.99 for 500ml) It had complexity and layers on both the nose and palette. Other than a slight metallic note (which blew off) there where no detectable flaws. Another great porter from the Baltic"
"This is a tasty well balanced beer that's a little thin in body. It's easy to drink and a great example of the style."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: Doesn't live up the the first baltic porter I had just yesterday (Beer Here Morke Pumpernickel Porter), however, not a disappointment. Represents the sweeter side of the porter world, and does a good job. If you don't want a real heavy, smoked, or roasted porter then try this. Definitely an easy beer to drink."
"Travels well, good craftsmanship. I should drink this more often."
"D: This is a nice brew and I imagine it would go well with heavier Russian/ Eastern European foods."
"Poured black with a big, tall graham colored head. Nice lacing and nose. All roasted barley, black maltyness, a little coffee bean and milk chocolate. The taste has a unique flavor to it, like they made the chocolate character very creamy, not bitter and burnt. Hops are put mostly to the side in this example. The mouthfeel was a tad thin even though the bubbles were small enough to get close to the silky texture they were no doubt shooting for. Overall a nice example and a unique creamy milk chocolate/mocha type sweetness that isn't overdone but just right. I was expecting an average beer but happily I got something much better. Only a $1.99 for a pint bottle and 7% abv makes this one affordable and practical."
"D - Not bad overall. Some definite improvements can be had with this beer."
"C. It's a very nice Surprising beer that doesn't try to be too much."
"Drinkability: a relatively drinkable beer, especially considering it's 7% ABV. Not really a good session candidate, but I wouldn't mind quaffing one now and again."
"Very nice porter, sweet and roasty. The beer pours a deep, dark brown. It's just barely translucent with a beige head. The aroma is a bit underwhelming with some cheap, simple malt smell that happily doesn't come through much in the flavor. The flavor is well-balanced, particularly for a porter, a style that a lot of breweries tend to take too far, in my opinion. There's an excellent roasted malt note, burnt without getting too harsh. The malt is also sweet with caramel and fruit. This is a calmer, more drinkable Baltic Porter than most from American breweries. I have no idea, really, but imagine it to be closer to the historical roots of the style. It's a very nice beer that doesn't try to be too much."
"Silky mouthfeel, slightly oily. This beer coats my mouth with flavor. Good drinkablility, if the alcohol wasn't so damn high I might have found my new favorite beer to drink in copious amounts. Instead, it's just a pleasant repast on a chilly evening."
"Three fingers of tight mocha head rests atop a deep black body. When held to the light, only the slightest highlight of ruby shows through. Very little lacing. Dark fruit aromas with coffee and dark chocolate; a hint of brown sugar. Coffee and dark chocolate character is complemented nicely by plum, raisin, and other dark/dried fruit flavours. There's even a hint of cherry. Alcohol provides a boozy kick. Bittersweet and slightly acidic. Roasted malt bitterness gives a drying finish and lingers in the back of the mouth. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Slick and oily, coating the inside of your mouth. A delicious afternoon tipple on a cool, grey autumn day."
"D- Very easy drinking porter, could be a session brew for sure. Glad I tried it, probably will pick one up the next time I see it."
"D: An accomplished and uniquely flavored porter that I'll go back to periodically. Pretty good value and easy to find to boot."
"Not bad, a decent value, and one of the better one's I've had from Russia. Would make a great ""cooking beer."" Probably not worth going out of your way for..."
"Nothing really stood out for me on this one. The taste wasn't too complex, nothing really stood out. I enjoy trying beers from countries that I have not sampled their beers from before, but nothing in this stood out to make it more than an average brew."
"Feel is full with a lingering cocoa finish, though not coarse in texture. Well carbonated for the structure of the beer. Surely a different take on the style, but very good."
"Overall, its a pretty dry and not so desirable baltic porter. It was pretty cheap but still wasn't quite worth it. Baltic porter is a style I'm normally very in tune with, and considering the name of this brand, this is a large miss in this category. Love Baltika 7 and 9 unfortuneately not this one."
"This is a good beer...would be good with sausage and caramelized onions...it is drinkable for sure, but is not really a ""great"" porter by any stretch of the definition. It tastes good, and goes down pretty well."
"O- I'm enjoying my first Russian beer. I don't think I would buy another of these but worth one experience"
"It's a decent porter, but average at best. I drank this on it's own and assume it would have been more enjoyable paired with some food. (Note: the price is right on this beer as it's very cheap.)"
"Far from the rich, inviting experience one would expect from a porter. Skip this one and hope there are better offerings from this brewer."
"A nice porter which packs great flavours and looks nice. A tasty brew that I would be happy to have again."
"mouthfeel is good. pretty well carbonated actually. good drinkability."
"Overall, I did not think it was very bad, but I would have expected that this beer would have more smooth body."
"D- the price makes this one an option for times i want a bigger porter without paying too much. the strong alohol presence makes it something i dont pick up too often."
"Not the C+ that Jason of BA gives it, in my opinion, but definitely nowhere near top class."
"Poured a very deep brown with a tan head the quickly faded to a persistent ring. Aromas of coffee and roast grain and a bit of fruity sweetness. Flavor carries through, with an initial malty sweetness tempered more by black malt bitterness than hops, with some fried fruit hints suggesting an English ale yeast. A medium-full bodied beer, appropriate for the style and ABV, that would become a bit much after a few rounds. All in all a good effort."
"1 pint bottle. Poured a dark brown, nearly black, with a thick, relatively short lived, light brown head. Aroma of brown sugar, hickory, malt, alcohol, and peaches. Smooth mouthfeel with a distinctive coffee bitterness. Accents of brown sugar prevalent with malt, red apple, and peaches subtly hinting. I also get a distinct wheatgrass aftertaste. Truly an interesting Russian porter with more than a few levels of flavor."
"mouthfeel/drinkability - light thin beer that gives it better drinkability and easy to drink on this 85 degree day but i want a little more weight porters"
"Drinkability- It was an ok beer. I might have another one but it's not one I must have. Average I would say"
"As always, just my opinion."
"I couldn't drink too much of this, as it sits rather heavy in both the mouth and gut. Not a bad brew though."
"Conclusion: This improves as it warms a bit, but it's still nothing special; I've had similarly priced Baltic Porters that blew me out of the water; this is tasty but mediocre by comparison."
"This one has a fairly high ABV, which takes away the drinkability a little, and some would dislike the sweetness, which is a bit heavy."
"D: Like drinking a pound of bricks soaked in motor oil, but in a good way. Everything about this beer is just a little too strong: the metal, the fruit, the body. There's a lot going on, but it's just not quite in sync."
"D: Easier to drink as it warms. Not a bad beer, but not great either."
"An almost pitch black offering. The head quickly disappeared. The aroma was mostly malt, and not very intense either. I initially liked the flavor right off the bat with it's slightly tangy malty sweetness. Bitterness was minimal. Mouthfeel was thick. The thing that ruined it was the odd aftertaste. I wish I could describe it effectively other then it was not pleasant."
"Not bad. A bit simplistic and too sweet."
"3.0 D: If it had some carbonation, it'd be a bery good beer overall."
"D: I started out really liking this beer, but my initial impression didn't hold. It's an OK beer I wouldn't turn down. But there are much better takes on this style."
"The foam was dark wheat in color, smooth and dissapated quickly but left a ring around the glass til the end. The Smell was very potent, nutty hops and a little chocolaty with a nice aroma and feel of high alchohol. I think it's Russia's answer to Austria's Samichlaus. Tast was a perfect twin to the smell - dark, deep, rich, a hint of chocolate and a tast of high alchohol. Color was very dark red, almost light resistant and nutty. Mouthfeel was smooth, deep, dark. Drinkability was very good. A beer I will seeing again soon."
"Overall - Too sweet for me. Not horrible, but I have definitely had better Porters."
"Pours an extremely black color body, with red around the edges. Big creamy tan colored head, somewhat lasting. Aroma is dark fruit and cola, somewhat effervescent. Some alcohol and dark fruit like fig and raisin. Not an overpowering aroma. Dark fruit, dark grape and some spiciness on the taste. Some light fruit too. Somewhat flat tasting. Okay tasting. Some nuttiness, roastedness, and chocolate as it warms up. Better. Nothing special, very grapey."
"The roundness of the beer was better balanced than most porters, which led me to conclude that the concept of ""mixing"" dark and light just means pouring dark and a tiny bit of ale in there. Lacking in drinkability for watery-ness and lack of character."
"Overall, this is a fairly good porter. I've had better but I certainly would not turn down an opportunity to have another. I think the feel and taste are the best part, but the aroma could have been a bit stiffer. A good beer."
"Slick black appearance with lacing circled around the glass. Patchy clouds for a head. Molasses, cocoa, coffee, toffee, caramel wrapped around a woody, burnt exterior. Creamy and sweet, a good milky aspect gives it flavor and weight. As said before, creamy with a silky texture while being relatively light. A good dessert/sweet drink in my opinion."
"Overall it tastes like I believe a porter should, and gets good marks amongst the porters I've had. This is a solid example and is yet again one of the reasons why I keep turning to Baltika for their beers when I find them."
"Absolutely delicious, a great example of a very enjoyable style. The flavor of this one has a rich butter vanilla element that really sets it apart."
"Overall: I wasn't expecting much from Baltika. I've learned not to. This is probably the best beer I've had from them. Avoid. Try Victory's Baltic Thunder if you're looking for bang for your buck and a solid baltic porter."
"Very good porter."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, just how I like my porters. Easily drinkable. 7.0% ABV is masked well, as I feel I could drink plenty of these. The flavor on this one is fairly blah. It's not bad, but it's just weak and ho-hum. No bite or aftertaste. Just a nice roasty, nutty, scant chocolately taste. I've had better, but at the price ($2.99 for a 19oz.) it's not a bad buy. Recommend."
"My first Russian Baltic Porter, hopefully I'll find some others to compare it to."
"OVERALL: A very interesting brew that I quite enjoyed. It's a little too boozy at 7% , but the rest of the experience is quite nice. Though it'd be hard to drink more than two perhaps, this is one I'd definitely revisit."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable, but the sweetness would prohibit me from drinking anything more than this bottle, as even a bomber probably would've been too much. My first Baltika brew, and due to the other ratings, I'm not sure if I want to throw down the cash to buy anymore. An above average version of the style, but nothing I'd probably buy again, with so many more complex and worthy versions out there."
"When I was living in Moscow in 2004 this beer came in a shorter, stockier bottle (though still 500 ml) with bulkier red-foil labeling and capping that was more attractive than the current model but less convenient when it came to opening it and holding it. The upgraded bottling is definitely better for exporting. Pours a very dark reddish brown with a big brown head that lasts. Smells and tastes of roasted malts and dark chocolate, though neither the aromas nor flavors are as powerful and complex as those of other popular porters. The lingering chocolatey finish is my favorite part of this beer. It's medium-heavy weight manages to be creamy and quite satisfying. Overall this beer is very drinkable and should be tried."
"Baltika 6 Porter is a very dark red ale that borders on black. It has a dense, mocha colored head that thins out but stays and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is dark, roasty and sweet. There is a strong note of licorice. It is medium-full bodied, smooth and slick. The finish is a little sticky. It tastes sweet and roasty like the aroma. There are notes of caramel, chocolate-covered cherries and licorice. I like that this isn't as sweet as some other Baltic porters. It's balanced more toward a roasty bitterness. It's a great example of the style. This is the best Russian beer I've had yet."
"Baltika #6 Porter poured a nice dark red-tinged brown color and settled in the glass with a fine tan head. Subtle aromas of dark fruit, licorice, and creamy-milk chocolate tinged sweet and lightly roasted malt. Taste was well developed, balanced, and quite enjoyable, starting with a sweet, almost creamy licorice and cherry-tinged malt backbone. This sweetness was tempered very nicely by the bracing carbonation and roasty cherry-chocolate finish. Mouthfeel was extrordinarily smooth, with the right amount of fullness. An enjoyable and sophisticated porter."
"D - I really could do a couple of these, very smooth brew. Highly recommended."
"D: Pretty decent brew for my first baltic porter. I could've used a bit more malt presence, but overall pretty tasty."
"Medium bodied, not heavy at all or filling. I could drink a few of these no problem. Again, this is on the mild side of bold. Nothing wrong with that at all. Thoroughly enjoyable."
"A poseur porter."
"D - Nothing offensive here but it's certainly not as hearty and robust as it needs to be for a Baltic Porter."
"Poured into a pint glass, Baltika 6 has an opaque color, and a modest but frothy quarter inch of tan head. The nose is sweet with a rich cocoa, milk chocolate aroma. The flavor is less sweet than I expected, though. There's a roasty edge that offsets it well, but plenty of good malt flavor to make it interesting. The finish has a curious bit of sourness like one finds in some stouts, that blends well. A pretty solid beer, one of the best baltic porters that come from the actual Baltic."
"I've got an old empty bottle of this on my wall and decided to try it again. It's a good beer as I had remembered, nice and flavorful without being overpowering. Looking for a baltic porter that you could have a couple of in a sitting? This could be your beer."
"D - All around this is a fairly biter dark beer. I would not reject it if I was served it but there are many out there that I would order before this one."
"Was unpleasantly surprised with this beer. Looks great, dark with a wee bit of head. But smells like raisins and licorice. Taste is the same. Sickeningly raisin sweet with a caramel back. Body is not porter-like, kind of thin and watery. I'll stick with the other offerings from Baltika."
"500 ml bottle, bottled on 10/25/2007, best before 10/25/2008. Well, just missed that date by a few weeks! Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch and a half tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. The aroma is nice, it smells like roasted malt, dark fruit (mostly cherries), caramel, toffee and chocolate. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit, molasses, smoke and a bit of alcohol (which becomes less noticable as the beer warms up). Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with medium carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and has a slight dry finish. It's easy to drink, too. I think it's a good all around Baltic Porter, and the price isn't bad either. Recommended."
"Pours a dark,rich looking crimson with a creamy medium brown head that recedes slowly to a thin cap that holds on tightly. The nose is sweet and malty with some chocolate notes and subtle dark fruit aromas. This is pretty sweet even for a Porter,I'm not complaining. Chocolate covered raisins,roasted caramel malts and a good amount of hoppy bitterness. Again a very sweet and almost root beer/tootsie pop like sweetness throughout. A slightly dry and gritty feel keeps things tough enough to call this a good solid Porter. A very balanced creamy,sticky,soft...yet a slight grittiness keeps this from being a wimp(it's a bit rough around the edges and I'm glad)."
"i definitely dont get the metal and astringincy that was so strong in the bro's review. and ill slightly agree with the sweetness, however i think its pretty tasty and not that sweet."
"Overall, this is an interesting brew. The mouthfeel and aroma have me anticipating an assault on my palette, however the flavor profile is significantly more rounded and mellow than the average Baltic. I could easily see myself grabbing another bottle or two, especially given the relatively reasonable price."
"I split the bottle with a friend and we dont really care to finish it. We will, but were not excited."
"D - This is a good baltic porter. I am really starting to love this style."
"Drinkability is pretty good, at first I was really loving it, but the bite started to build up and I don't think I'd want to make a night of these. Still, a well made example of the style and a good value make this one a winner."
"D- Drinks great with a smooth combination of semi-sweet flavor characteristics and a drying body"
"Wow, this one is highly underrated. Delicious Baltic Porter."
"The body is thin and for as sweet as this beer is there's a partly dry aftertaste. It could use some more CO2 but I guess it wouldn't be a porter then. Very drinkable, not noticeable that its 7% abv."
"The taste is similar, pleasant, yet interesting, mostly spicey with chocolate, molasses, and some fruit. The alcohol is barely noticeable and it is highly drinkable and somewhat light for the style."
"Drinkability: This beer isn't bad but like other Baltika beers it seems like extra sugar was added prior to bottling. Definitely a slow-sipper type drink, I could not handle more than one of these."
"D'ability - A bit too sweet and alcoholic (in flavor) to be a session beer for me. Not the best Baltic Porter, but not bad for the price (paid $2.29/0.5L)"
"Overall, this beer is certainly one to try. A slightly strange interpretation, but it could end up being your favorite. The complexity makes this one interesting, but the booze and light sourness in the finish make it not overly drinkable, at least for my tastes."
"It worth a try though and it's not that bad though. I would give it another chance."
"D: A little sweet going down, ok drinkability."
"It's not great but it's not all bad. I wonder what it would taste like fresh (hopefully not so sweet) but I'm just not curious enough to seek one out."
"This looks like a porter that I'll like. Nice almost-black color with a tan head. Thick pouring. It smells really sweet like mollases, prunes, sugar and alcohol. It's got an OK flavor. No hoppyness, heavy on sweet malt and molasses. It's heavy and syrupy and somewhat lactic. I'm a little disappointed. It seems like the appearance was nice and then it all went downhill from there. It doesn't suck but I wouldn't ever go out of my way to get this beer again. There are many other much better porters out there. And if this is what a Baltic Porter is... Then I'll stick with regular porters."
"As this is the first Baltic Porter that I have tried, I don't know if this is typical of the style but my initial reaction is that this beer lacks balance. Not bad, but not something I would probably ever drink on a regular basis. Would go good with some dark chocolate I imagine. I am still going to try and remain open minded with this style and hold off judgement on it until I have tried several beers representative of it."
"Pours a good looking deep brown with ruby highlights. Nose is all grain and lager. Taste follows with some weak roastiness, graininess and some slight chocolate. Mouthfeel is a little bit thin here, but ok, and drinkability is pretty good. Overall an ok brew, but really didn't make a lasting impression. I recommend trying it, as it would be good to session on, but really not what Im looking for as far as flavor intensity in a baltic porter."
"Taste & Mouth-feel: Good body, smooth and rich are the first words that come to mind. Nothing too outstanding compared to other Porters, but very decent, especially for the price ($2.00 at a local market). Definite hints of chocolate and caramel, overall drinkable. I do agree with others who say it's a bit too sweet, the pint is a bit much. I would prefer to share this with somebody as a desert before whiskey! Worth the money and does warrant a second try at some point."
"All in all a very solid brew, and one I would certainly not mind purchasing again... especially for the price.... definitely a steal."
"D - A very exceptional porter. This one's very smooth, tasty, and easy to drink. I would definately recommend grabbing a bottle before we embargo Russia."
"Been looking for this one for a while now so when I came across one I quickly grabbed it. Deep dark ruby pour with a thick tan head and some nice lacing. The aroma is very malty with a good sweetness to it. Great smoky flavor with a nice roasted quality. Licorice, coffee, and a touch of chocolate complete a tasty brew. Mouthfeel could be a touch thicker but it works. Overall a good porter."
"One of the surprises with this porter is its alcohol level. The alcohol content of this porter is greater than most beer, but even at seven percent, the alcohol taste isn't as pronounced as I expected. It is a warming alcohol flavor, not a biting alcohol flavor. It makes for a nice combination of taste sensations and it makes Baltika a very tasty, complex glass of beer."
" Although drinkable, this brew does not satisfy my thirst for a true porter. Not much to see here, move along!"
"D - This beer is pretty easy to drink its creamy smooth with a good taste to it and its cheap a dirt for a pretty decent beer its worth getting if you see it"
"D- Great brew I think it was good all around."
"This one might be better classified as a strong beer in my mind, if just because it doesn't really carry a lot of the characteristics that are common to the Porter style. It's thick, but strongly, strongly fruity and sweet, with a sharp alcohol buzz and spiciness across the whole proceedings. I tasted a lot of dried fruit, swirling right into the alcohol that kind of ran throughout. Hugely sweet, potentially to help cover up the alcohol. Not bad, and actually one of the better brews I've had of the Baltika label, although not really a good representation of the style."
"Poured into a .5 liter stein a deep dark brown with a tint of of ruby a 1/2 finger tannish colored head sat nicely atop.Aromas are sweet alot of dark fruit and heavily roasted coffee pretty heavy handed in the sweet dept,flavors are the same intense roast and dark fruit and brown sugar really not any drying base, just to one dimensional.Full moutheel keeps it at least a decent brew but there are alot of domestic style that blow this away."
"i would say try it in an espresso cup with toast the morning after you accidentally sleep with your cousin at a ski slope"
"Another interesting invtational as the second lightest beer of the six wins it all. We'll be back again around this time next year for the Third Unorganized Invitational, so mark your calendars. Good night everyone!"
"Burp: N/A"
"Not bad. It's similar to the Aldaris I just had. The tastes and aromas are very similar, with some subtle differences. If I had to choose one, I'd go with the Aldaris over this, but they're both pretty solid. This one's certainly worth a try. Recommended for fans of the style."
"D - Reasonably drinkable, but suffers towards the end from the significant sweetness. The nice, dark fruit character is quite pleasant, though overall it could be a bit more complex."
"This is not a bad porter, and to be honest I'm new to the Baltic style. But it's a bit sweet for my liking, and makes me think that this is what a porter/malt liquor blend would resemble, although that may be a bit off. I don't think this is a terrible beer, but I can't see myself revisiting this anytime soon."
"This was my first Baltic porter and I enjoyed it a lot. I had it slightly chilled in my Warsteiner mug. Poured a dark, baker's chocolate brown with a tan head. Smelled of roasted malts, some bittersweet chocolate, and a touch of black roasated coffee. Tasted of mildly smokey malts, some rich dark chocolate and a kiss of black coffee. Overall a good brew."
"Too sweet for me, making it more one-dimensional without any complexity."
"D. Very drinkable."
"This is my first Baltic Porter and this compares very well with some of my favorite English and American versions. A good treat and gem that I happened to come across."
"Drinkability: Not the best baltic porter I've gulped down, but, for me, it was definitely the best stop on the trip through Baltika Land."
"Lower carbonation, medium body. A bit warming after a while. Not bad, but a bit too sweet for my tastes."
"Picked this up just because I've never had any of the Baltikas and I've always been curious about them. I was expecting it to be a trainwreck, but it actually wasn't all that bad. Not something I'd immediately pick up again, but I wouldn't necessarily refuse one. It's too sweet, and the sugar sort of gets old after half the bottle is gone, but it's not all that bad."
"Here is another Baltika that I tried straight out of the bottle, so there's no review of the appearance. However, based on the taste of it, this was just a good, basic porter. The texture was thinner than a stout, but it still had most of the coffee flavor. It had moderate bitterness, but the real distinguishing feature was that it had an aftertaste of prunes. This and the 3 were my favorite Baltikas."
"Well balanced, if not particularly outstanding; all the elements are there. Alcohol masked well, leaving a very drinkable porter."
"Mouthfeel is a little overcarbonated, but very clean and dry. Body is too thin for a baltic porter. This is pretty easy to drink but it's not a great beer."
"Pours clear but extremely dark brown with a thick tan head. Nose is okay. Nothing crazy. Just some mild malt tones. Hmmm. Unusual. I can't remember the last time a flavor profile made me stop and think so much about what I was drinking. It's nice and robust, yes. There are nice thick tar-ry tones. Strong sweet side that is almost like brown sugar in a way. Thick malty presence. But at first I get an almost cola It's nice. A bit too sweet, but good. Feel is smooth, but at first there was a real odd carbonation. Calms down over time. I like this style and I like this one. It's a bit too sweet, but I can still hang. I'd session this."
"Pours a ruby tinged dark brown, slightly translucent with a medium tan head, quite luscious looking. Aromas start off with a bang with tons of licorice and caramel. Medium notes of alcohol carrying lots of dark fruits, finishing nearly port-like. Grain-wise, quite a bit of roasted grain, nothing near burnt aromas, and no hops detected. Overall, a really nice aroma. On the palate, a creamy sweetness hits you first with an overall sherry like feel. Moderate to low carbonation and just truly dextrinous. It finishes with the roasted and highly kilned malts coming through in complexity with quite a bit of warmth at the end. An excellent porter, glad to try this and nice to see it holds up for nearly a year with grace."
"Chocolate milk for grownups. This is simply outstanding, a fantastic example of the style (as I know the style so far). The perfection in flavor and feel tips this one over the edge into world-class territory."
"Good mouthfeel. Not thick and syrupy but has sturdy body and is easy to drink."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I think it would pair very well with a rich chocolate-y dessert. I was a little surprised to find that this was more like a porter and less like a RIS, especially since this is a product of Russia, than some of the other baltic porters that I have tried. The alcohol is gently warming, but for the most part well hidden and the flavors are rich and full. I find this to be a strong example of the style and would look forward to having another."
"It poured with a finger's worth of thick, deep-tan head with decent retention. The color was a deep, dark brown with ruby highlights. The nose had a cocoa, chocolate, roasty aspect to it, making my mouth water in anticipation. The mouthfeel was medium with a boatload of chocolate and dried fruit flavors, like raisins and prunes on the palate. The finish was pleasantly sweet, chocolaty, raisiny, and downright delicious. Given its price, this is a true bargain and one that is worth seeking out. More, more, more!"
"Good full flavor porter w/ flavors resembling a milk stout. Also I would not have guessed that this beer is 7% ABV because it hides the alcohol well."
"#6 is all too easy to down, to enjoy, and to follow up with another of its ilk. Grab, enjoy, and thank yourself later."
"Mouthfeel is very soft. It is a smooth porter that evenly coats your mouth with its sweetness. Not a bad feeling but not one I prefer for a long durations. This is a decent dessert beer but not one I would want to drink all night."
"A very enjoyable beer. Alcohol is completely hidden (at least in the taste)"
"D: Not a bad porter and easy to drink."
"A great dessert beer."
"7% alcohol by volume. Excellent."
"Poured a great dark brown/black with nice light tan head and good lacing. Odd scent, not really a porter (no darkness, coffee, or burnt hints). It had more of a lager scent. Not much of a porter taste, either, but was more like a chocolate amber. Decent chocolate tones, but not very good with the other usual porter tastes at all. Went down fine as far as mouthfeel, but I'll never get another batch of these."
"A beer that is worth a taste but it is one I most likely won't revisit."
"D: A lighter Baltic Porter for me, but still a nice specimen, a good beer coming out of Russia, and at $1.49 a bottle, plus tax, the price is right."
"D- Very drinkable porter. I have not been disappointed in anything from this brewery. This is a porter that you could easily have more than one of in a night"
"D: Enjoyable, but I couldn't drink more than one and it just doesn't do it for me. The M.F. is too thin and the depth in the malt dep't. needs to be seriously beefed up. Easy to quaff though and tasty enough to be enjoyable, although rarely."
"This porter was extremely dark almost black which won huge bonus points in my book. Very minimal head when poured and the aromas hit my nose instantly. Once I took my first with I immediately knew this was one rich beer. I got a hint of chocolate at first but then it was all maple syrup and malt there after. It had plenty of malt and hops in the flavor but they were well balanced out. I felt like I could taste a syrup in the flavor maybe used to brew the beer and I could also taste the 7.0% alcohol on the back of my tongue as I swallowed (my wife said the alcohol taste reminded her of soy sauce.) The after taste is very mild if there at all. I was not a fan of the alcohol taste but the feel of the beer on my tongue had texture and it flowed. I am definitely a fan of the mouthfeel but the alcohol taste hurt the drinkability."
"Poured from a 16.9oz bottle with production and best by (love that they have both) dates on the back label into a pint glass. It was a dark almost black color. It had a good sized brown head that settled into a thin collar. Good carb geyser in center. No lacing. The aroma was very sweet from dark fruit with heavy molasses aroma as well. Too sweet. The taste was also too sweet. This is the third Baltic Porter that I've tried and this is one of those styles that will never be top tier for me. They end up being too sweet and after a several drinks I'm dreading the rest of the glassful. A sampler size would be enough for me. Overall, I can't recommend this one unless you are a fan of the style. (One and done)"
"If you are looking for something different and can get past the sweetness, then this is worth a try. It is certainly a unique beer, just not for me."
"This Baltic Porter was much better than I expected and very sessionable as far as porters go. A pretty good bang for the buck as well."
"Overall a decent beer, not sure I'd like another in one sitting."
"The flavor picks up where the aroma left off, with bitter cocoa notes complemented by raisin, fig, alcohol and some candied malts. Mouthfeel is good, but something about the way this porter affects the palate is a bit off. The body is viscous and the alcohol makes itself felt, while the bitter notes make for a good finish. I'd have this beer again in a heartbeat. It was complex, tasty, and (like Mother Russia) it went well with potatoes and vodka."
"I tried this beer on a whim to see what this Russian producer could deliver the way of a porter. This is a very drinkable porter, but I can't say it blew my socks off. Good but unexceptional head, balanced smell, acceptable taste, unremarkable mouthfeel, and an OK finish. A bit too sweet for my taste, and sweetness was the one characteristic that emerged from an otherwise balanced taste. It seems like a beer that is engineered more than crafted. I would enjoy this beer if it were served to me, but I'm not likely to seek it out in the future. Available in a long neck 0.5 L bottle that is different from the one shown on BA, as of this writing."
"Poured dark brown into my Guiness glass with very little head. Head receded to almost nothing, likely due to the full body of the beer. Smell was your average porter dark malt, nothing special. The flavor was simple, malty, slightly bitter, but nothing special either. This one gets points for price ($1.59 for a pint bottle) but as a Baltic Porter it's just average."
"Good on a cold night with grilled bangers and stewed lentils. Good for a late night winding-down sipper as well."
"Mouthfeel- On the sweeter side, the roasted and or darker malts taste great without too much of a burnt taste. A good dark somewhat robust porter with a very nice sweet balance. A good froth releases some of the alcohol and at 7% this Porter hits just right. best Baltika I've tried to date."
"Drinkability- It is an alright sipping beer"
"Pours black with a head that fades quickly. Some slight lacing. The smell is very sweet with notes of plum, prune, molasses, and cherry. The taste is better. Same fruit but dryer and there is a background bitterness that runs throughout that helps to balance the sweetness. Like Blackstrap molasses and bitter orange. The mouthfeel starts bold, but it falls off a bit and becomes thinner. Overall, better than I expected but not as good as some of the other gems around the Baltic."
"this one from Baltika had 13.07.07 as the use by date; pours about as black as it gets w/ a creamy tan head which dissapates quickly & leaves decent lacing; strong sweet caramely mallt aroma, underlying spicy hop & fruitish smell; dark roasty malt followed by sweetness, very robust flavor, more ""congac"" type of flavor, lots of alcohols on the palate combine w/ a raisin type flavor; a rich full bodied, low co2 mouthfeel, not dry like your usual porter at all; this one tastes fabulous, but is a little too sweet for me ( although it is an excellent style example), i could prob. only fit 1 in my session..."
"Pours black with a tan head. Aromas of caramel, coffee, and a small alcohol presence. In the taste, a sweet caramel, coffee and a small alcoholic burn. A smooth mouthfeel and a sweet malty aftertaste. Balanced and a nice alcohol presence, easy to drink and smooth."
"pours a deep brown/black with a light brown head. sweet dark roasted malts, chocolate, dark preserved fruit, and barrel-aged rum in the nose. it's strange to notice this much alcohol in the aroma for a 7% beer. the alcohol presence carries through in the taste which is not to my liking. almost cough-syrupy. sweet dark malts and very little hop presence. the roasty flavors help to provide balance. medium to full in body. complex enough, but the alcohol presence brings this down a bit for me as far as drinkability."
"Overall - A decent enough porter - a bit too much liquorice / anise for my liking though... worth a try..."
"From what I have had so far the best of the Baltika range."
"D - Although it's not cloying, it's not a session beer. I could drink one of these with some chocolates or a cigar. I also think that it could stand up to a burger or steak, but this is one that I would like to savor on it's own. A chocolate lover's dream."
"Overall, a nice surprise. This is a well done porter."
"Did I have a different beer than most others that reviewed this? I thought it was well done and it was a bargain."
"Not a bad beer. Kind of weird tasting but good nonetheless. Alcohol seems to be hidden enough that it isnt noticeable in the taste, but I can definitely feel the hotness. A very different experience. I am not sure I would revisit, but at $2, its a great deal."
"D- Very drinkable, but dangerous. I have spent many evenings in Russia and Uzbekistan with this old friend."
"Sampled from a 16.9 bottle. Pours a deep black with a chestnut head which disappeards to mere lacing before I finish my first sip. Good nose to this with cocoa and black licorice which both come through in the tongue. Very dry mouthfeel to this with very little aftertaste which improves drinkability. Will try again and glad I received this one in a BIF as I may have never tried this one."
"I find this a very drinkable porter. The 7% alcohol is pretty well hidden... I only became aware of it after nearly completing a bomber! A very nice beer!"
"Poured into a pint glass from a 16.9oz. bottle. The beer pours an deep brown, almost black, forming a 1/2 inch tan head. The aroma is a good mix of roasted malt and chocolate. The taste is a good combination of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. The alcohol is well masked. All the characteristics of a good porter. Medium mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable baltic porter, even at 7%abv. Overall, not a bad porter. This is the first ""baltic"" porter that I've had, so I really dont have anything to compare it with, other than the fact that it was a good porter."
"Chocolately, with a nice burnt, smoked aftertaste that was just a bit too bitter. There was some vanilla, but no coffee. Satisfying and solid."
"Pours a deep cola brown with a tan head that eventually reduces to a ring, minimal lacing. Smell is all malt, not much else going on. Taste is much more complex, burnt chocolate followed by a fruity cherry taste. This is followed by a bit of bitternes then dry. Mouthfeel is very nice, with carbonation setting off a fairly heavy feel. Sweetness keeps this from being a sessionable beer. I'd personally put it as a really good porter, but it's not as complex as my favorite Baltic porters. I bought this because it was relatively cheap, but its a very good beer I will purchase again."
"Interesting beer. Poured with a nice light tan head and plenty of lace. Opaque dark brown to black. Aroma is very spicy as of holiday spices. Not so apparent in the flavor. Body is on the thinish side. Good beer. Bittersweet and some roastiness. What do they say? Quaffable, I think.... Not laughable. One of the best of the Ruskie brews that I've had."
"D- I find this one hard to drink. It doesn't taste particularly strong but just rubs me the wrong way mouthfeel and taste wise."
"Good for the getting."
"D - I really like this porter, As it warms it only gets better. A little to big to have more than two in a sitting, but I will be buying another one of these tomorrow."
"Slick, almost oily mouthfeel. Not a bad beer...something more suited as a dessert or a nightcap."
"Pours a dark black/brown. Very enjoyable even after warming a bit. You can really get the chocolate in the aroma. First brew from Russia so why not start with a Porter. Taste is somewhat grainy and slightly roasted. Very little carbonation to be found. Finsihes VERY smooth. Another taste gets some nuts along with the a small hint of chocolate and coffee.... HIDDEN for sure. Very drinkable and a great brew from Russia. Will for sure pick up again."
"Fun easy porter, good strength and smooth demeanor. Quite tasty."
"Pours a nearly pitch black color with a light tan head. The aroma is pretty faint with some dark roasted malt and a little bit of chocolate. The taste features some roasted malts with a dry bitter finish that is a bit boozy. The mouthfeel is lacking any real depth and is too thin and watery. Overall, I am not a big fan of this porter at all and would not purchase again."
"Many thanks to Gary, Old Faithful for picking these up in Louisville. True to its porter/imperial stoutish roots, this pours a dark colour with a mocha head. It has above average carbonation and a drop of sourness, all superceded by great balance. There is mocha and fruit in the nose. A medium mouthfeel. A chocolate finish."
"D: A quality Baltic porter with a thick, roast-y flavor. Liked this quite a bit and would probably get it again."
"The first thing I noticed about this beer was the dark color coming out of the bottle almost a coffee color. The smell had a chocolate scent with a hint of raisin in my opinion. The beer had a nice creamy head when poured and the taste was not as bitter as one would think with the color of this beer. It was very drinkable and I would recommend it too anyone who comes across it."
"Drinkability/Notes: Baltika is a pretty nice Baltic Porter. Plenty of malts upfront with brown sugar and chocolate dominating but has a really nice roasty and hoppy finish that lends for an easy drinking and well balanced porter. Alcohol is well hidden in the taste, especially for 7%. The body of the beer is so light, almost schwarzbier like, that it would seem to make a decent session beer except for the abv content. Definitely worth seeking out and trying and one that I wouldn't hesistate trying or buying again."
"A nice way to support the Russian economy."
"Drinkability - very tasty. The import price is the only negative, but I'd certainly have this one again."
"Drinkability: Wouldn't be bad as an introductory porter, though I yearn for a hint of smokiness... Solid for what it is, though."
"Had a bottle of this with lunch today. I hadn't seen this beer before so I figured I would give it a try. The beer pouts pitch black out of the bottle and forms a thin tan colored head. Smell is not very strong at first, but this was due to the beer being served too cold. Once it warmed up distinct roasted coffee and chocolate aromas are present. The taste is similar to other porters I have had although it does have a more distinct roasted flavor. A very solid brew all around. Drinkable and tasty."
"Overall, a very nice, complex Baltic porter. Too bad we can't get any other examples down here. This is a staple in my beer fridge."
"A unique, but solid, porter, well worth a try. Especially for only $1.75 in singles."
"A very interesting, un-porter-like rendition, and worth a try although, it didn't impress me as much as many Baltic Porters do."
"A very enjoyable beer"
"It is smooth, yet rich and has good drinkability qualities, I wish I had more than one."
"As it warms, the 7% becomes perceptible. Not overpowering, but gives it an edge. One bottle was enough, I continued the Porter session with a Strzelec Porter. At $1.69, it was a great budget buy."
"drinkability - WOW this was a pretty good beer. I think the label threw people off as a bad beer because I bought it for 99 cents."
"I got hooked on Baltic Porter after a visit to the Boston Brewing Co. in Boston. They served a Baltic Porter that is not currently released. It was pretty damn good. I gave this one a try to see how it compared. I thought then Boston Brew Co was better however, this one wasn't too bad. It poured a black color. The head on the beer wasn't bad. Smell had a malty smell to it. However, the taste was light. I rather enjoyed this one. It is 7 % ABV so watch out for this one."
"Drinkability: It's cool to drink baltic porters from their land of origin. I just got done shoveling snow, so this beer is that much more satisfying. This beer is very true to the style, but could use a little bit more sweetness. I think it would do very well with 5-10 years on it. It would probably turn into a robust port-like beer. I like this style and this beer so I will definitely revisit and recommend it for a taste."
"Drinkability - The anise will keep me away from drinking more, but I can see how others could be a fan."
"I believe this is the first Russian beer that I've ever had, and it's pretty darn good. If it's ever available in my area, I'll definitely pick some up on occasion."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very deep brown; practically black with a huge, tan, foamy head that leaves webs of lacing as the foam subsides. Smell is very malty sweet, mostly toasted grains, maybe a bit of burnt chocolate or coffee. Taste also is primarily roasted grain; I also get the sensation of marshmallows and chocolate. The alcohol is barely noticeable and the beer has a dry finish. The beer is medium bodied with a foamy consistency. This is very drinkable and I will definitely attempt to obtain it again."
"Even at 7% this is highly sessionable. I could drink this all day without a problem. I really like this baltic porter."
"This beer poured a dark black with a light brown head. It has a good look with a nice lacing as you drink. It has a dark roasted malt smell with a bit of a bite. The taste is sweet it a little bit of a burnt chocolate taste to its finish. A sharp crisp feel with a lingering aftertaste. Its an ok porter and drinkable but not the best of its style."
"Adam"
"Poured into a 0.5 liter Spaten glass. VERY dark beer topped with a frothy two finger head, excellent lacing. Almost looked like cappuccino. Smell was very malty. Something off about it that I couldn't quite put my finger on. The taste was actually rather bland. It really doesn't even taste like a porter. Alcohol was barely noticeable. Somewhat drinkable, but I'll shy away from it from now on."
"Not a bad example of a Baltic Porter. This is my first one, so I feel I have plenty to look forward to if they are anything like this one, or better. Recommended."
" Buddy"
"Overall, not a bad beer. But for a Baltic porter, coming from Russia, I would have expected more. There are much better Baltic porters out there, and though this one is worth a try... I won't be rushing back to it."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a dark black color porter with a nice foamy head with good retention. Aroma of light roasted malt and chocolate is very pleasant and enjoyable. Taste is nice mix between roasted malt with some bitterness and some semi-sweet chocolate finish. Body is about average with some adequate carbonation. Very nice for the style overall and some thing I wouldnt mind trying again."
"Mouthfeel was smoooth. Medium body. I will enjoy this one again in the future."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass. Poured a deep brown that turned to jet black in the glass. Left about a finger of thick brown colored head that had decent retention and left some lace. Smelled sweet. Dark chocolates , coffee and brown sugar. Tasted of roasted coffee beans, chocolate and and burnt charcoal smoked taste. Not too bad. Little carbonation and no alcohol presence. Had a thick full feel in the mouth. Drinkability was about average but would try this beer again."
"Definitely an underrated favorite of mine."
"A very nice porter. I'll buy it again."
"Really very tasty, and I'm pleasantly surprised. I haven't had any other good beer yet from Russia (or former Soviet republics, for that matter.) I'm really quite pleased."
"Overall, the drinkability is excellent. I would have this again whenever it is offered although at 7% ABV, moderation might be considered."
"Because of the texture and the strong taste, it's hard to drink, but it is a very good beer. I will get this again,"
"The drinkability is quite high, this brew is underrated in MHO. I'll but more and send some to friends. MK"
"Pours opaque black with a small rich tan head that resolves to a film and excellent lace. Sweet aroma composed of roasted coffee malt, raisins, alcohol spice. Flavor is nice but somewhat superficial. Starts with vague sweet malts, builds good coffee and toasted bread notes in the center. Finish is abrupt and borders on unpleasant due to lactic sourness. Oily body with a good mix of cream and carbonation. Quite drinkable overall."
"D - A solid beer that is very easy to drink."
"this was my ""winner"" from the Baltika Challenge (although i knew it would be going into the thing). pours dark but not opaque. brown with a fairly light head. roasty, earthy and malty odors come off of it as it warms up. tastes like a good Baltic Porter should...nice roasted malts, delicate hops, some alcohol evident too...nice bitterness. coffee dry-ness. good mouthfeel and easy to drink. the only Baltika i'll probably be buying again."
"Another beer from IntriqKen. Pours nearly black, can't really see through it. Smells like halloween candy. Taste is very sweet like prunes and raisins, slightly burnt malt and a little bit of alcohol in the background. Overall not the greatest porter but it is pretty good, worth trying at least once and definetly for anyone who is afraid of dark beers, you'll like this one."
"One of the best Baltikas. Pours a dense black with brown highlights. Not quite opaque, but pretty darn close. Has a small brown head and some lacing. Nose is sweet roasted malts. Taste is lots of roasted malts, and some coffee grounds. Other people didn't taste the coffee, but I'm pretty darn sure it was there. Then again, I'm not a coffee drinker. There's a hint of bitter hops in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice, with a good level of carbonation. Drinkability is slightly above average."
"Pours black red (like Guinness) with a nice tan head and lacing. At 7% it's lighter than the other Baltics I've tried. Reminds me more of a ballsy Schwarzbier, but in a good way. Smells of a tangy cocoa. Tastes of more chocolate, not too heavy. It's a little dry and there's is a slight (very minor) sour fruit edge that makes it interesting. Very smooth and easy to drink, not to mention tasty. Makes a great dessert drink."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. I feel like this beer is barely hanging on to 4.0 ratings in all categories, I can't justify giving it a 3.5 in any individual category, but if asked to rate this beer overall on a 1-5 scale I'd give it about a 3.77 not a flat 4.0."
"Slainte!"
"D: A little too warming to session (even for the style)."
"As far as porters go, this is one of my favorites."
"Super dark brown beer, with a luscious light coffee head. Lots of malt, roasted coffee, and brown sugar in the nose. Mouthfeel is super dry lots of grainy bitterness, over roasted coffee, burnt chocolate, mollasses, burnt toast. Dry finish, with a sweet and bitter aftertaste, lingering malt. No hops whatsoever, all the bitterness is coming from the grain."
"Bottle. Good dark/black apperance. A surprising smell of bread - odd for a porter. Good brown head. Taste - slight coffee, very mild, smooth porter for 7% abv. Taste improves as it warms. Feel - average to weak. Drinkability is above average, but not high. This is a decent porter for the price. I have had it several times now, and will come back to it as a good beer to have as a single when you want a bit of a relaxing kick, but not as strong as an imperial stout."
"Medium body, medium carbonation. Rich and creamy in the mouth. A somewhat syrupy finish cuts drinkability. Nice and rich but still a little light for a baltic porter."
"Body is very big as expected, with a oily, slippery mouthfeel and soft, creamy texture. Great mouthfeel, but limited drinkability due to the fear of diabetic shock."
"Lots of flavor. A bit too sweet to drink more than one, but a good starter for an evening."
"Surpringly good. Found it very similar to Flag Porter, just not with the creamy body and smoothness, but very close. Very good chocolate, coffee, and roasted grain qualites that are evident in the look, smell, and flavors. A strong nutty flavor persists after the barley malts and dark grains subside. Light hints of vanilla and lactose add complexity and variety. Pretty good beer, just wish it had a bit more gravity."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable porter , nice and flavorful , not overpowering , smooth."
"The pour is black with red highlights and a large off-white head. The aroma has chocolate, caramel malts, and medium to light roasted Sumatra coffee. Dark fruits and a nutty flavor enter the mix in the taste to add to the roasty coca and chocolate and the sweet malts. The mouthfeel is quite thick and the alcohol comes through more than it should for a 7% beer, but I'll let the brewer get away with it in a Baltic porter. Not a bad offering at all."
"Drinkability....just wonderful!..way better than I had even hoped for....easily the best beer from this brewery that I have had...a good solid quality Porter!"
"As rich as pecan pie. A little much for my taste."
"...and at $1.99 for 16 oz, I will definately be on the lookout."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a dark tan head. The head is thick and creamy and clings to the sides. Smells of molasses and malt and not much else, but it is a very pleasant aroma. The taste is of lots of dark malt, some coffee and some chocolate. Very true to the style. Not much hoppiness or bitterness, but it still finishes cleanly. A little bit of alcohol burn, but it doesn't detract from the taste. The mouthfeel is very thick and heavy, but not really creamy. Not much carbonation either. Very drinkable, it's a damn tasty brew."
"Pours a dark but not opaque black color that is more or a reddish hue in the light. A thick creamy dark multi-hued head forms but dwindles after a minute or two, leaving thick lacing atop my oversized pilsner glass. Smells plesantly malty, gentle hops and gentle all around, no detectable alcohol aromas, sweet malts but not so much as to intimidate. Taste is a fairly sweet baltic porter, not overwhelmingly sweet, not as high-fi as others, and not as lager like or off tasting as others I've tried. Darker malts make a fair show here, while the body of the beer seems balanced and not overly pale malt focused, nor overly caramel focused (like some traditional dopplebocks, say). The baltic porter lager yeast characteristic is present here with a slightly sweet flavor and yet slightly drying with a bit of cocoa finish prevails giving it character. Where is the alcohol? None detected. Impressive. Mouthfeel is surprisingly full but certain in the medium bodied catergory, but not light for the style, nor overly carbonated. Wow, this beer impressed me more than other top rated baltic porters, and Baltika is a surprising contended again along with their #4. While I wouldn't choose this beer often as I don't care for the finish and baltic porter characteristics too often, this is the best I've tasted yet of this style. Underrated and delicious."
"Drinkability - This beer gives you a nice buzz and for $1.66 for a little over a pint, is a good deal in my opinion. I would like to bring some more of these--and I'll certainly be reviewing more Baltika's in the future.."
"slightly disappointed in this one. i can see that it could be better with carbonation."
"Overall, though, this beer leaves me feeling uninspired. It's as if they wanted to make a Baltic Porter to match some of the best but just kind of had a brain fart and stopped before it was finished. Not sure, but I wouldn't find myself drinking much of this. Again, though, it does look nice..."
"A great beer."
"Overall, this is not a bad porter. Very bitter and not terribly smooth though. Nothing terribly special here."
"Pours dark brown, almost black with thick, tan head. I picked up heavy malt aroma, with licorice, coffee and hint of toffee. Taste was more heavily coffee at the start, with alcohol becoming more evident at mid bottle. Finish left an aftertaste of charcoal and alcohol. Possibly if I was eating the right foods with this I could enjoy more, but for just a smooth sipping, tasty beer, this did not cut it with me."
"Pours a dark brown/red, big tan head forms, some nice lacing and good retention. Smell is malty, sweet cherry, toffee, roast, chocolate and coffee. Taste is sweet, roasty, some floral, oxidized dates, caramel, not too bad. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, pretty smooth. Not the best Baltic porter but servicable."
"Pours thick and black with a big brown foamy head that dissipates to a ring. Smells of treacle, burnt chocolate, dates and sweet cream. Very smooth over the tongue, with a silky, creamy texture that signals sweetness. Sweet chocolates and a hint of caramel announce themselves first, followed by nicely bitter roasted malts that linger for a while, morphing into a nicely balanced, sweet-and-bitter finish. Overall, very well done. Not the best baltic porter ever, but certainly a solid one."
"Overall, it's not bad - an average baltic porter, but nothing to go out of the way for."
"Smooth on the mouth, this one reminds me all in all of the similarly misnamed AB Amber-bock. I guess this was $1.18 for a reason..."
"A favourite of many, but not mine. It's simply unbalanced, and alcohol is too obvious both in the air and in the mouth. It makes you warm but leaves you disappointed. Buying porter, we do not want to drink dark lager with a twist of white spirit. But that's what #6 is. If you can live with it, good like. I'll opt for something more conventional."
"Almost over-the-top sweet taste. Pretty much the same as the smell. There's a slight metallic taste in the finish though. It's not terrific but certainly not bad. This is an enjoyable beer."
"Very tasty and easy to drink."
"D: This is probably the best Baltic that I've had so far. Very smooth and tasty, and at $1.79 a bottle, an excellent value."
"Drinkability was good enough to wish I had a second bottle!"
"This beer poured a dark brown from its bottle and had a small head. It's smell had a medium roasted malt and hop aroma with a bit of sweetness and a hint of plum or fig. Also prevalent was an alcohol sweetness due to it's higher ABV. The taste was much the same with a bit more alcohol taste than I'm used to but not over the top. This beer also was a bit sweet and had a medium carbonation to it with a medium/thick mouthfeel. In the end, this beer was good, butI don't think it was anything special except that I felt it was different from beers I've had. I think it's worth a try though."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer seemed to be a bit on the watery thin side. The taste doesnt linger and is a bit thin. The alcohol is major present in the taste. This is just not a beer to go out of your way for."
"Drinkability: This is too sweet. After the pint, I'm done."
"Pours almost completely opaque black. A nice inch and a half head caps it off like a crown. Nose is full of sugary fruits, and a bit of roastiness. I find it very inviting! The taste is at first plum-like, then a bit of coffee, followed by a finish that brought to mind burnt chocolate chip cookies. If there was just a bit of bitterness the taste would be perfect in my opinion. Either way though, its still a lovely porter. Mouth is light on carbonation, and a little slick. I could definitely have another and will buy this again. I think I have a new favorite porter!"
"This beer pours deep deep blackish-brown with a generous light brown head, but not too much in the way of head retention. Hardly any light shows through this big beer. The nose is dominated by chocolate, but it doesn't offer too much overall. On the front of the palate, roasted flavors mingle with hints of licorice, leading into a robust bitterness that fades into a roasty aftertaste. Some astringent elements linger on the back sides of the tongue, and eventually the alcohol begins to perk up ever so slightly in the gut. Really this beer is pretty good, and a pleasant surprise given the expectations one might have. And it's cheep too!"
"Please pick this up if you see it in the store. This is what a porter should be..."
"Pours out black with ruby hues and a very thin, yet frothy, khaki head. Smells of chocolate malt, mocha, concord grape juice, and quiet alcohol. Also present are hints of Queen Anne chocolate covered cherries. Flavors are of very malty and lager-clean: bready, nutty, and lightly roasted. Slight bitterness comes at the end, but I can't tell whether or not it's from the hops, alcohol, or astringent roasted grain. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky, but too light for me. I would have prefered that the flavors in this would have lingered on the tongue. Kind of a compromise between an English porter and a schwarzbier."
"Pours dark brown/black with a small head which holds well. Nice dark malty smell but it does lack depth. Usually beers in this style are a lot more complex smelling. Taste wise its a smooth brown ale--but it really doesnt even seem like a baltic porter at all--more tan malts and sugarry-somewhat thin and lacking complexity. A bit too sticky on the mouthfeel. Average drinkability."
"My good pal GOOCHPUNCH told me that this is a lager style (and then made fun of me for not knowing that, so mods if you read this please ban him for being a beer snob and a huge jerk). So please do not expect overboard American interpretations of the Porter style, but do expect a very easy drinker (7%?) and a perfect remedy for the sweet tooth."
"Pours nearly black with a nice lasting light head. The smell is rich and malty with decent hop sharpness. The flavor is generally roasted and malty, with a strange sweet or fruity aftertaste that I can't quite place, plus a slight hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is pretty well balance and decently dry. Overall this brew was not very complex, but highly drinkable and a great value."
"This is a desert beer to be sure. Its super sweet and cola like. Dark mahogany with an immediately dissipating tan head. Smells of figs, coke, and prune juice. Tastes of aforementioned dark fruits charred wood and a bit of coffee. Chewy with only residual bitterness. Alcohol is extremely well concealed making this one quite drinkable. Cheap as hell too. Im begging to become a fan of the old block."
"This beer pours almost black with ruby highlights and with a thick tan head from a 16.9 ounce brown bottle. It really looks like a beer of this style should. I've had a couple of the lighter beers from this company and I thought they were decent if unexciting. I've been looking forward to this one, because this is a Baltic porter made by a Baltic company. The aroma is on the malty side with some fruitiness. The taste seems a bit restrained, it has the right elements, but I would like them to be a bit bolder. I can taste a bit of chocolate (quite mild though). There is definitely a noticeable amount of astringency in the aftertaste. Definitely a decent porter, worth a try, probably not worth searching for."
"D- This beer has lots of great dark malt and dark fruit layers but it is not sweet and in taste smooth and lagered. The complexity and taste remind me of a good port but without all the sweetness and alcohol. This is a good solid beer."
"A nice drinkable porter"
"Drinkability/notes: An interesting variation on the style, not bad."
"Overall: good beer well aged probably at its peek"
"KM."
"Sweet malts nd a bit of molasses, but also something adjuncty in the smell. Deep black with a three finger thick head. Looked lovely in a tulip glass. Nice steady release of gas and the head is as creamy and fluffy as you could ever hope for. Burnt dates is the dominant flavor with ample alcohol notes. Its not very big flavor wise even though burnt flavors tend to dominate a palate this one does not. It feels so good though and looks so perfect you want to fogive the lack of big flavor."
"Dark brown, deep ruby highlights. Dense, dark tan head with good retention and lacing. Light roasted aroma, some grain character, dried fruit, and some alcohol. Quite sweet without a balancing hop bitterness to start things off. Dark malts are quite mild and the fruit character really dominates the middle. Some fruity bitterness appears at this point along with a light burnt quality. Alcohol really moves forward towards the end, both flavour and warmth, melding with a bit of hop spiciness. Medium to full body that's on the creamy side, medium/low carbonation. Not a bad version of the style, but it's a little too sweet for my tastes."
"Poured very dark and cloudy, looked rather like a brown ale. Pruny aroma, a little alcohol in the nose. Not much head retention. This had a thicker mouthfeel than some of the other Baltic porters I've tried. Very smooth going down. Nicely carbonated, sparkling. A little salty tasting. Not very sweet in the finish."
" This is a tasty, mellow porter that is good news for beer drinkers in Eastern Europe as Baltika is a major player in that market. Not Fuller's or Sam Smith's but this is distinctive, quality stuff from Baltika."
"The mouth is a bit thinner than I would like, but this is very easy drinking beer. Great to savor in these colder winter months."
"Good brew, rich and creamy (a porter from Russia just boggles my mind). But a solid porter, never-the-less, and for $1.69 a 500ml, this has good economic value to boot."
"Overall an interesting and complex porter to say the least. I'm remind of Edmund Fitzgerald Porter and Old Rasputin Imperial Stout when I drink this. Not a bad combination if I dare say so myself. Very good indeed."
"Drinkability- very easy to enjoy and something you can have one right after the other."
"I could see myself kicking back with a couple of thes before calling it a night. Incidentally, this pairs well with 3yr old wisconsin cheddar."
"Don't get to taste too many Baltic Porters, I hope they all follow this one to some extent. Excellent color and nice mouthfell a little on the lighter side of porter, but I'm told that's what to expect from the Baltics. The other flavors of Baltika aren't really worth your time. However, this is a favorite and worth the more than fair price I paid for it. $2.00 a pint bottl."
" notes: this is a good beer for those who want something exotic, but are broke. Heck this is one of the best deals in craft beer, for how decent it is. I think this would be great for a freezing cold day. Recomended."
"Overall Impression: This is my first Russian Baltic Porter. I expected a much heartier meal, and got a light roasted snack. Flavor is ok, but just didnt live up to the great smell."
"Mouthfeel is velvety and creamy but medium-light, only improving the drinkability. A well-rounded porter, not complex but outstanding in its simplicity. My glass is missing the alcoholic heat that others describe and I'm not too familiar with the style. It probably doesn't stand up style-wise but it's quite good for a porter. I could session this."
"A decent beer, alcohol is well disguised by many complex nut-type notes."
"Pours nearly black with a dull clarity. A creamy, pale tan head rises above two fingers and slowly sinks leaving light lacing. Sweet malt and fresh whole hops aroma. Black patent, roasted tones, and plum flavors dominate, with caramel notes and alcohol creeping up in the aftertaste. Lively carbonation cuts through the full body and lingering sweetness to smooth mouthfeel. The fruity cloying finish and alcoholic bite may be appropriate for the Baltic porter, but the drinkabilty sucks."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Oh, if only it were cold enough to have a fire going this is the kind of beer that would taste best with a ski lodge around it. Definitely worth a repeat purchase!"
"500 mL bottle, best by 8/23/05, reviewed on 9/4. Pours almost as black as a stout with a 1 finger light brown head that leaves hints of lace. Smells of metal, caramel, and hints of dark fruit. Lots of sweetness on the palate with toasty/burnt malts, raisins, molasses, anise, some hop bitterness, and a touch of smoke. The body is medium to thick and fizzy at first but becomes smoother. Good and drinkable, but nothing to rave about."
"Hell of a good porter at an outstanding price ($1.69). I will try to keep some of this on hand. Great drinkability."
"22 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a very dark brown color. The initially large head soon fades to a thin layer of foam. Roasted coffee aroma with some fruit, including bananas, oddly enough. The flavor is sweeter than I expected. Malty, but doesn't tasted too much like roasted malt. A little chocolate flavor. All in all, this beer is fairly bland. Light hoppiness. Much better than most of Baltika's beers, but as a Baltic porter, this is merely average."
"Pours out with a massive head that also shows a cool cascading effect that you might find in a ntor can beer. Head is tan in color, body is black until you hold it up to the light (which lets a little light show through). Smell is dark roasted malt, but not that strong. Taste is also not that intense in any flavor, definitely doesn't show the ABV. An OK porter very drinkable, meaning not offensive, but not great either."
"Medium body."
"All told, a definite one to try...and try...and try."
"Pours with a thick, creamy two-finger thick brown head that sits atop an opaque black beer. The aroma smells of chocolate, and lightly roasted coffee; overall the aroma is fairly subdued. The taste is sweet and creamy up front with a sharp, slightly acidic, roasted note in the finish. The beer has a medium full body that just starts to coat the mouth. This beer is quite drinkable, smooth and creamy it goes down quite easily. There is a lingering burnt note that sticks around long after the beer has left my mouth; this is not a bad thing though, more like a lingering roast coffee note. This beer is quite tasty, though it not as complex and deeply layered as many other examples of the style."
"I really enjoy Baltika beers and they're a great example of Russia's emerging brewing industry. Their beers have a great earthiness and this beer is no exception. Pours black with about 3/4 of an inch of head. Malty, earthy aroma. Taste is dark chocolate, bitter bakers chocolate and some dark fruit. Not as sweet as other porters out there. Slightly thin in the mouthfeel, but it ads to drinkability as this is not as heavy a hitter as some baltics. A very nice beer, one to try, and a bargain at under $2 for a 16.9oz bottle."
"smell was rather mild roasted malts. Not the coffee type deep roast but more a light slow cook that produces more subtle flavor. A bit watered down flavor. Its very drinkable and surprised me with the mild hop middle. My opinion is they need to work on some depth in this brew as it seems it has the cookie cutter approach but its decent."
"Balika #6 is a deep, dark shade of brown, almost black. The head is light brown, large, and thick. The retention is very good. The aroma is of rich, dark malts, but not as strong as expected. The taste is very rich and complex. Dark, rich malts dominate with a strong taste of dark fruits mixed with a bit of molasses flavor. Notes of chocolate and alcohol add complexity to this tasty brew. A long syrupy, sweet finish is the perfect capper for this beer. This is an excellent beer and a steal at only $1.69 for a pint. Highly recommended."
"Drinkabality: Since this a good cheap beer, this would make a nice choice for a Baltic Porter session beer."
"The beer came in a 500 ml. brown bottle with a best by date of 16 October 2005. As the bottle was uncapped, and beer poured, the dark brown - bordering on pitch black  body was revealed, and a half inch thick brown head formed briefly, before receding to a thin collar of foam. Aroma was more fruity and vinous than a typical porter with a smell consisting of chocolate covered plums, cherries, and raisins. Taste was also devoid of much roastiness, with sweet plum and caramel flavors dominating. There was scant evidence of faded roast grain flavor if I let the beer linger longer on the palette. Slight oxidation was apparent in the aftertaste with a hint of soy. As complex as it was, I can think of several craft Baltic style Porters that are better. This was more of an easy drinking industrial interpretation of the style."
"A beer that true porter lovers will probably hate but Weizenbock lovers will really like this. If you look at my favorite beer preference then you will know that I love the stuff."
"Head drops off fast, but I like the tan head, not much carbination,so that lets malt and fruit, especially raisuns and dates come through. Color is brownish,purple??? to black what I want to see in this sort of beer ?? I smell alcohol, malt & iron. This really hits the back of the tounge & throat nicely. The abv is deceptive, could almost drink this a a session beer. Probably the best beer I've had from the baltics."
"Opinion: This is a decent beer, and not bad for the price. I was hoping for a rich toasty Baltic Porter that blows me away with the flavor and subtle alcohol. You really need a lot of Munich malt toastiness to provide the foundation for a flavorful beer. This beer is good, but it is too commercialized for this style in my opinion, and is a bit lacking."
"D: not just normally drinkable--it's a very thirst-quenching dark beer which is hard to place in any dark beer style (for me)!!!"
"Pretty full bodied for a porter, on the edge of being a stout. Light carbonation makes it go down easy. I would buy this again, a cheap and unique porter. Quite good."
"Pours a standard porter black with a nice thick and creamy head with good lacing. Nose is bready and malty, smells like breakfast. Taste is malty, malty, malty. Nice and sweet, but balanced with a hoppy bite and garnished with some dark fruity notes. Very nice. This is a chewy meal of a beer, but highly drinkable, I could have certainly downed a few more. The 7% abv is hidden to perfection. It reminded me very much of Lake Louie's highly rated Tommy's Porter, but for some reason I just liked this one a lot better, maybe my palate has matured since then. A very good beer at a great price if you can find it."
" the alcohol, though not immediately detectable, cuts down on head retention"
"Pours a black color with a light tan head. The aroma is of roasted malt, nuts, and cream. The taste is similar to the aroma. The mouthfeel is a little less than full bodied with low carbonation. Overall, this is really good beer. It has a nice relaxing quality to it."
"Bottle obtained from Total Beverage (Colorado) and consumed a couple evenings later in July 2005. Pours a two finger tan brown head over a pitch black liquid. Dark ruby edgings when held to a bright light. Smells toffee and chocolate cocoa and a hint of roast. Tastes mostly chocolate with some caramel and no roast that I can detect. Molasses. A touch of alcohol. The aftertaste is cocoa chocolate mixing with prunes and plums. Simple, but tasty. Medium-thick bodied and moderately carbonated."
"BB 2-09-05. Nice and brown head and a very darkbrown beercolor. Nose is not fresh in the beginning but gets better fast as this whee air has dissappeared. Lots of maltaromes mostly caramellic and some cofferoast. Taste is full malty, burnt and caramellic but nicely dosed. Litle sweetness but not overdone and a nice bitterness for moderate bitter and roasty aftertaste. Full mouthfeel as should be for a porter. Good brew,easy accessable but good flavour."
"D: A smooth beer, highly drinkable for 7% ABV."
"I had no idea what to expect from this beer, so I'm not quite sure why I am pleasantly surprised. This was an enjoyable beer, and while I wouldn't want to drink a session's worth, I would certainly enjoy another on a quiet evening. Give this a try."
"Pours a dark, rich brown body with a tan head. Sweet, roasty aroma, full of dark fruit. However, after it's appearance and smell, everything else was a bit disappointing. Taste was a bit lacking any sort of depth. No roasty flavours present. Just some sweetness and molasses. A bit alcoholic, and it has a dry finish. Medium bodied, and not as drinkable as I would've liked."
" Quite good. After having it a few more times, it's one of my favorites."
"Drank this porter just after eating a hamburger - the combined flavors were quite good. Color was black with a good head. The aroma was malty and somewhat sweet. Alcohol was barely noticable in this beer and the malt/chocolate flavor was strongly present. This is a good, heavy, tasty beer."
"Baltika's # 6 pours a clear, very dark mahogany body beneath a full head of creamy tan froth. The head retention is quite good, and it leaves some nice lace at the outset of the glass. The nose is caramelish with some darker malt tones and a touch of dark fruit (plum/prune, non-tart berry). It's delicately crisp in the mouth with a fine-bubbled standard carbonation that's somewhat subdued by its medium-full body... gently tingling I might call it. The flavor is more fruity than the nose suggests, and it's loaded with caramel and toasted brown sugar as opposed to chocolate; and, unfortunately, it's hindered by a touch of alcohol that wasn't really noticeable in the nose. It's balanced towards sweetness, and its bitterness only becomes apparent in the finish, lingering gently with some previously unseen herbal hops and dried, dark fruit skins. Baltika's best beer?... perhaps! Enjoyable and certainly worth trying!!!"
"Good carbonation level and medium-heavy body."
"Drinkability: Outstanding nightcap. I think I may start keeping a couple of these around the house. At 7%, its just enought to enjoy the full pint and give you that sleepy feeling."
"Drinkability  This was a tasty and very smooth example of the style."
"Not a bad beer, but nothing special. I expected something fuller and warmer tasting."
"Wow, what a fantastic beer: rich, thick, and delicious. Superb. Highly recommended."
"pretty drinkable, but the ABV might limit you from drinking it all night. very good considering the low price. $1.99 for a 16oz bottle."
"Thick and dry compared to other american style porters I've had. Carbonation is present and wide-mouthed, but not too forceful. Dry, steel/grain after-effect, which I didn't like too much. Reminds me of a number of barleywines I've had.."
"Probably the beer to get when youre in Russia. Nice maple smell, and pours with a notably brown rocky head. Has some good coffee roast malt notes, and then maple, and a little bit of honey, come back as you sip. In fact, it almost has some barley wine character that makes it well worth picking up. Glad I was first exposed to it a bit closer to the source that at some Russian deli in America."
"My first baltic porter, wasn't sure what to expect, but this seemed OK-good."
"Dark dullish brown, clear. Nice frothy head on a hard pour, builds to almost an inch of latte-like bubbles. Lacing is pretty good at first, thick looping rings that thin as the beer is consumed. Aroma of bittersweet chocolate, just a slight astringent fruitiness. Carbonation is medium to low, mouthfeel pretty nice and creamy. Flavor is easy-going, milky with cocoa tones that glide easily past the tongue. Hops are non-players of any note in the profile. Drinkable and pleasant overall, if there's anything missing it might be a little more complexity to write about. As is, an easy drinker and one that hides its 7.0% ABV pretty well and has a nice texture."
"Anyways, I poured this into a tulip glass, leaving a 2 cm head that quickly disappeared to near nothing besides a slight edge layer and some slight lacing on the glass. It poured a black color with a mocha colored head. Taking a good whiff of this, I could get the scents of a sour brown caramel malt mainly with some mocha cappuccino aromas and a slightly nutty (almond or chestnut) aroma as well. Slight chocolate came through as well, but mainly the coffee/cappuccino odor. Taking the first sip, I got the idea that this is mostly chocolate and toffee flavors w/ hints of almonds popping through with a light alcohol burn upon the swallow. Aftertaste was there, mainly of bitter coffee, which was nice. The feel is mainly a thin-to-medium body w/ carbonation that whacks the tip of your tongue and quickly dies off w/ a slight alcohol burn taking over the rest of your palette through the swallow. Overall, this was a bit thin for my taste, but fairly drinkable...easy to drink a few bottles..good session beer!"
"Pours a very dark color with a tall head that dies off fast and leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is somewhat sweet with hints of dark fruits and dark malts. Maybe some molasses. The flavor is dark and sweet with the dark fruit giving some slight character. Some chocolate in there. Nice body and drinkability. Very nice offering."
"This one pours a nice black color with 3 finger head that falls to a quarter inch over the beer. The nose is very sweet, with some nice figgy and molasses. I dig it. The flavor is nice as well. A nice combo of fig, chocolate and molasses. I like it. The feel is right there between moderate and thick, with a touch of creamy...a touch thin. This is a really nice beer overall. I like the flavor, nose and feel. Well built. A nice Baltic porter."
"Ultimately, it's a respectable beer, and more than moderately drinkable. At $1.75 for 16.9 oz, it's an affordable option for a Baltic porter in the States."
"Perhaps a little subtle for a Baltic Porter but a damn tasty beer anyway. The rich, sweet, creamy elements hurt the drinkability a bit. It would make a good dessert beer."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice rich malty scent that seems a bit dry, but full of caramel and black malts. It has a roasted, toastey aroma. The taste is great. It has an extremely smooth and creamy flavor that is full of sweet crystal and black malts. It goes down easy and hides the elevated abv. . The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good beer and a bit of a surprise. It is a great drinker."
"This beer starts with an absolutely wonderful aroma of vanilla-scented coffee with cream. It is quite dark, a very dark brown (almost black), with hint of ruby. The It pours with light tan head. The beer foams up with a flourish, then the bubbles fall to thin collar of foam. The first bit of flavor is of the Mexican hot chocolate (but not hot) and is accented by the very smooth mouthfeel. A bit light-bodied, with a dash of bitterness before the powdery, almost tannin-like finish. Finishes with a touch sweetness, no real bitterness, but very dry with a hint of alcohol burn. I like this one, but I'd like to have a little more body for this style."
"If a Russian Imperial Stout and Guinness Draught hooked up during one crazy foreign exchange student summer, this beer would be their child. Poured tar black with an impressive, Guinness-like head. Nutty, caramel aroma. Distinct peat smoke notes, calling to mind Guiness, overlapping dark roasted caramel malts. Dry, and a touch watery mouthfeel. The 7% abv is completely hidden in the malt. Verdict: a dry Irish Russian porter."
"Beer is good. Happy Ruskie Beering."
"Drinkability: It's very tasty, ""only"" about 7% and smells better than almost any beer I've ever sampled. It may not be the best Baltic around (I've never had one before, going by BJCP guidelines), but it's a damn tasty beer and hilariously Wal-Mart cheap. I'm stocking up."
"Baltika Porter may be my first beer from Russia. It's a more than capable effort and I'll be looking for it again. It's also a good starting point for those interested in the Baltic Porter style or in flavorful dark beer in general."
"Pours black with cherry highlights and two fingers' of creamy tan head. Head takes it's time to settle on top of the beer, receding to a thin layer of lace. Spicy hops, roasted malts, and overtones of chocolate dominate the aroma, fighting each other for prominance. Taste is preceded by chocolate and a light medicinal flavor. Could be fusels or hops, hard to tell, but I lean towards the former. Roasted and chocolate malts dry the mouth out in the finish, and the entire beer seems to shrink in your mouth. Almost as if it's scared to be itself. This makes for an exceptionally drinkable baltic porter, but there are certainly better examples in the taste department."
"Pours a very deep brown-black hue (can still see light through it) with a creamy tan head. Looks kind of like a Coke in the glass. Nice aroma of roasted malt, coffee, sweet toffee, and alcohol. Palate begins sweet and full of malt, with notes of caramel, coffee, and cola, becoming more bitter towards the end. Beautiful creamy mouthfeel. A bit too strong to rate high on drinkability, but other than that, this is a good one."
"I must say I was indeed quite impressed with this one. It poured a pitch black with a tan coloured foamy head the receded in about 45 seconds or so. Almost looked like Coca-Cola. The smell was pretty good. Had a sweetness to it. A little bit of dark chocolate and a tiny bit of hops. Some coffee and roasted malt. Par for the course as with most porters. The taste was really good! I thought so, anyway. Very malty with a little bit of a burnt chocolate aftertaste you almost have to me looking for to detect. There is a tiny bit too much carbonation for my personal taste here. Note that I said a tiny bit. It isn't like Sprite or anything, it's just enough for me to say ""3.5"" rather than ""4.0"". The body is a lot lighter than many other brews of this style. Sinebrychoff Porter of Finland, North Coast's ""Old Rasputin""....two of either of those in a sitting is almost more than plenty. They're absolutley delicious brews, but extremley filling, thick, and heavy. This stuff I could knock out by the dozens! And at 7%abv, that's saying something. They do a nice job concealing the 7% in this stuff. All in all, I this one is fantastic and will certainly buy again! If you like porters/stouts, I would recommend this one."
"This beer is the best of both worlds. Unlike the Baltika 9 (the extra), which is essentially vodka in beer form, the porter has a body to it, and a good taste. The Baltika porter is creamy, nutty, and pretty malty, which does a good job of covering up the booze content. Cheap as hell, alcoholic as you would want, big bottles, and a good taste. I once carried a case of this stuff 5 blocks just because I was afraid the store was running out of it (which, much to my dismay, it eventually did). When you drink the Extra, you know you're getting drunk. If you want to get good and wasted on the cheap but still drink a delicious brew, the Baltika porter lives at the intersection of price, quality, and alcohol content."
"cheap russian bottles of beer, $2?? at hte Polish butcher shop Pours an opaque dark brown with a nice tan head that dissapate fairly quickly. Not much of an aroma, light malt Malty flavor, dark grains. Fairly light body which makes this 7%er go down real smooth and quick. This isn't a baltic porter in the Okacim style; big malt, syrup thickness but is quite enjoyable"
"Appearance was a beautiful, rich, crude black with a beige head on it that was very impressive at first and slowly disappeared, leaving only lacing down the sides. The aroma was sweet and malty with just the right amount of heaviness. The taste is wonderful right from the first sip. I had this one at about 55 degrees and it was perfect after a few minutes of warming. The taste is very rewarding with a sweet start and a nutty, malty finish. The dryness spreads out across the tongue but doesn't follow down the throat. Very nice overall for a Baltic Porter and would definately say it was impressive for its price!"
"Overall, you get what you pay for, this is a below average porter in my book. Not worth seeking out, but I've had worse shoved toward me in a pint, that's for sure."
"Pours a dark brown with mahogany highlights. Tan head dissipates into lacing around the sides of the glass. Dark fruit notes like plum and a decent roastiness. Pretty slick on the tongue. Roastiness shines through, although I've had roastier. Pretty good example of the Baltic style porter."
"Not a good example of the style."
"Tight and light brown head slowly fades over clear deep brown liquid. Loads of sweet and roasty malt in the nose. Taste is solid maltiness with some burnt barley and chocolate tones, then a good deal of hop come thru. Light alcohol heat felt too. Finishes nice and flavorful, long and satisfying. A well done Baltic Porter."
"Dark brown color with some cherry red highlights and a solid tan head, color was about the same as a Coca Cola. A light nutty smell, which gave way to a nutty caramel taste, a chewy mouthfeel and a sort of peanutty aftertaste. Fairly mild, the alcohol was not so present. All in all pretty darn good."
"This beer pours like a stout. Very brown to black in color. It is definitely syrupy in presentation. A nice, tan, foamy head erupts but it does sneak out of there quite quickly. I smell malts and coffee (which can't be a bad thing...very inviting). Tasty carmelized and complex in character. I thought it was a bit drier than other porters but my friends did not agree. So maybe somewhere in the middle of sweet to dry is where this finely crafted brew lies. Overall, a nice porter."
"Very dark with maybe a hint of reddish color. Big foamy head that disappeared quickly. Nice lacing on the glass. Smooth mouthfeel. Good flavor. Got the beer from someone else so don't have a clue as to how much it costs so I can't doa cost benefit analysis. The Russians make some pretty good beer."
"The taste is roasted coffee, with the impression of a big alcohol kick, although the beer isn't that strong. Some caramel smoothness too. Then, a chewy hoppy and slightly citric aftertaste leave a thick and long lasting mouthfeel. Nothing exceptional..."
"This beer is deceptively smooth for 7%abv. Nice, dark, dark brown almost black color with a decent head. Nose wasn't very impressive, some barely perceptible roasty notes. Taste was very very smooth, the roasted toasted notes were subdued. Very nice smooth caramel flavors. Very very drinkable, I will get some more."
"The smell is a battle between sweet and sour, proper for the style I guess, blending the malts with the hops, giving off a fantastic feeling. This is certainly (and happily) reexperienced in the mouth as part of the taste. Its rich body and faint carbonation give it a pleasing mouthfeel."
"This beer is very tasty and easy to drink. I got the bottle for less that $2 and I think it is one of my new steal deals at the store. Give this one a shot if you like malty brews!"
"The beer is dark black, but it is not as thick as it looks. The aroma smells of dark fruits and some chocolate. The medium body has hints of raisin and fig along with some sweet chocolate. It finishes with some whiskey notes. It is smooth and sweet. I expected it to be a little thicker and less sweet. It is a good beer, just not my favorite."
"All told, it's a good, drinkable, yet seemingly basic version of the style. Many surpass it in overall enjoyability, though it is certainly a decent rendition."
"I found this to be a very drinkable Baltic..my favourite style after all."
"Bill Hicks. 12/16/61 - 2/26/94 R.I.P."
"How nice and thank you."
"Beef Notes: It wouldn't take much to make this an above average brew. Some of that alcohol taste just needs to go away. I still don't understand why it tastes so much like alcohol when it's only 7%. I won't be returning to this one until someone tells me they've changed the recipe."
"Pours an opaque black with a full tan head. Aroma of dark fruits, roasty and coffee-like. Medium mouthfeel and light carbonation. Taste is of bittersweet chocolate, slightly fruity without being cloying. Overall a good, drinkable beer. My only real complaint is that it could stand to be a bit more robust. A bit more aroma, a bit more mouthfeel, and a bit stronger taste. Not much, just a touch."
"Baltika Porter: Pours a deep black, light cannot penetrate the glass. Nice tannish head, a vigorous pour leaves a good two inches, but it dissipates down to a thin skin after a few moments. Thick lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is nice, somewhat clean, and a little bit of mocha coffee. The taste is nice and rich, very heavily malts, with flavors of coffee and a bit of dark chocolate. Nice rich aftertaste, with rich roasted malts. Very lightly hopped to avoid any cloying malt taste. Rich and pleasant smooth mouthfeel. Easy to drink, although its got a fairly heavy 7 percent alcohol by volume bite. Nice, and a great buy at $1.45 a half liter."
"Appearance: Deep ruby plum in color with a nice sized tan head leaves a good amount of lacing not a bad look to it. Aroma: Thick layer of toasted malts with fruit and alcohol tinging around the edges. Taste: Sweeter up fron some plum and raisin like tones with chocolate and a mild coffee finish not bad compared to other Baltika products I have had. Mouthfeel: A bit thin for a big baltic porter medium to light in body with steady carbonation, not too impressed by anything. Drinkability: Decent not a warmer like I was expecting a bit of a disapointment."
"Drinkability - despite being served at room temperature, this might have been served too cold, but my heating went out and unless I was going to put it in the microwave or heat it on my stove it was going to be served at a very chilly room temperature."
"Pours a dark black with a nice tan head that hangs around for a while, only departing in the way of leaving a beautiful lace down the side of your glass. Smells good, NICE roasted malt flavor and a hint of coffee. Tastes awesome. This beer exemplifies a porter; malty with just the right amount of hops to keep it from being sweet with hardly any bitterness. Full mouthfeel without being chewy. If this beer lacked anything, it could have been just a tad bit more like the motor oil I'm accustomed to, but not by much. Drinkability is great."
"Taste is really nothing special. Tastes like your basic porter, though not a particularly strong one. I'd really like a bit of oomph in this one. Good, but a tad weak. Even so, completely drinkable."
"A good brew whose taste belied its 7.0 abv. Appaerance was a nice dark brown, almost black with a nice very pronounced malt aroma. Taste was smooth with a nice dry, crisp finish. Once again, malt presence with a hint of alcohol was evident. Mouthfeel was medium in nature, with a very nice dry, crisp finish. Drinkability was nice, especially for a higher abv brew. Would definitely have more than one."
"Pours a deep brownish black hue with a slightly tan quickly dimminishing head, slight smell of black licorice. Slightly smokey and a few tones of coffee. By no means overpowering a decent abv that is not very apparent. A decent beer, my first Baltic Porter and certainly not my last."
"Gotta give it to the Ruskies man, they can make a nasty(in the good sence) brew! The color was a black color, noth letting any light what so ever through it, kind of like a black hole. The head was tan, thick and frothy in the beginning and lasted the whole drink. The head did trail off a little towards the end, but was still a solid covering. The smell was not alcoholy at all. It was more geared towards plums, grapes, and other ""dark"" fruits. The taste was very similar, but a little heavier on the malt side. It has a nice sweet taste to it, but nothing too sweet, just right. I would say this is one well balanced out beer. Overall a great beer to explore. Every temperature change in the brew ushers in new tastes."
"it seems like a stout more than a porter to me. there's no complaints here. is this an imperial stout? i feel regal."
"Pours a very very dark brown with a tan swiss cheese head. Sweet sweet malts dominate the brew. There are other flavors to offset the sweetness, but none quite go the distance to achieve balance. A burnt and a fruit and a bitter flavor are amoung them. The 7% is not apparent. Mouthfeel is smooth. An ok porter, but nothing special."
"ng"
"One is very drinkable, but I don't think I'd go for more than one in a sitting - maybe good with a chocolate dessert to end dinner."
"Bottle opened so effortlessly I expected the beer to be flat. Luckily it was not."
"By any account, this is a stout, but not a very good one at that. The perceptable flavor of alcohol, hop extract and metal limits it's drinkability, akin to a Sheaf Stout or Ceres Royal Stout. Vastly inferior to Sinebrychoff or Okocim in my book. Not a bad beer, but I'll pass on having this one again. Throughly unimpressed."
"Overall bumped the score up a notch or two."
"Dark thick black with a nice sized tan head, very nice. Smell is sweet and bitter dark chocolate with a metallic twang. Taste is similar to smell, starts off syrupy sweet, then follows with bitter chocolate and finishes with a steel/metal flavor. Not bad, but not the best Baltic porter that I have tried. Cool bottle and description all the way from Russia."
"Sampled at From The Vine monthly beer tasting Oct 13th, 2003: Clear dark brown with a thin beige head. Light aroma of coffee and malt. Medium body with a mild roasted coffee/malt flavor and a lightly bitter finish. Not bad but nothing memorable about this one."
"Pours with a five-fingered light brown head that fades slowly and leaves some lace. Good carbonation. Black as midnight. Nose is clearly a sweet, roasted coffee. Starts smooth, malty and strong coffee flavor, finishes with a little hoppiness and bitterness. A very good porter."
"My first Russian beer. While I'm not thrilled by it, its not horrible, either. It poured a black that was as dark as the Detroit Tigers recent season. There was a pretty decent tan head at first, but it quickly faded, leaving a tan ring and a sligjhtly foamy film at the top. Smell was a slightly odd mingling of dark toasty malt and a subdued sweetness. Taste was of dark, toasted coffeeish malt and a caramel candybar sweetness. There was no hop taste to speak of. I think this could have been a little more bitter - its just too sweet for my porter tastes. Perhaps Baltika has invented a new style of porter - the candy porter. The mouthfeel of this porter is a little on the thin side. I don't think its sweetness and alcohol content lends itself well to repeated bottles - one is definitely all I need tonight."
"This Baltic Porter is a bit of a disappointment. It pours a roofing tar black with a fast rising and equally fast dissipating head and some trailing lace. The aroma is of mild malt and a slightly smoky odor. The sweet malt body is doughy and a little pasty. Dark chocolate and coffee notes come through loud and clear. The hop flavor is difficult to define as it is masked within the strength of the roasted malt and noticeable alcohol. I think I taste a bit of lemony citrus and mild spiciness. It could use a more acidic hop attack, an essence of pine and a tad more burnt caramel flavor common in quality Baltic Porters."
"On the poor ebony in color, the head monstrous in size, spumous in texture, the color a light chocolate, after it erodes a thick and glutinous sheet of lace clings mightily to the glass. Mostly malt in the lightly sweet nose, fresh and clean, the start sweet and malt-laden top is skeletal in feel. Finish is mildly carbonated, hops pleasant in their spiciness, very dry, some what tart, and a drinkable beer, but not really anything to scream about."
"Notes: The alcohol is a bit deceiving at 7.0% abv, as I said before a bit too sweet for me which took away from the drinkablity. A small glass of this with a chocolate dessert would be nice."
"Pours a dark brown color that's on the cusp of turning black. Tan head rises and falls, kinda like the USSR. Smells of sweet brown sugar with some roasted coffee and a hint of alcohol. First taste is of roasted coffee combined with strong alcohol flavor (vodka?). But that doesn't dominate the palate. This is a very sweet beer and the main flavors seem to be molasses and english toffee. Bitter hops waver in and out and never seem to settle. Finishes with more malty sweetness. A complex brew that warms the body."
"I have to say, after reading the reviews (along with a couple of good recommendations), I'm quite disappointed in this beer. There is something about the taste and mouthfeel that is off to some degree. It's a little thin, and there is a strange taste I can't describe. Not to say that this is a bad beer, just not as good as I thought it would be. I'll have to try it again some time. Appearance is as expected, alcohol not noticed in taste. IMO, can't compare to Fuller's (or Samuel Smith and Liberty, for that matter)."
"Almost black, but when held up to the light, a deep dark ruby color shows through. The light brown head is thick and foamy, and settles to about a half-inch high, with bumps and grooves like an ungroomed snow field. Shortly afterward, the head disappears, leaving very slight lacing, which slides down the glass behind the beer. The aroma is of dark roasted malt and a bit of chocolate, followed by very slight hops. Flavor is rich, with distinct chocolate and coffee, and a malty finish. The finish evolves into molasses. A bit of hop bitter hangs in the back of the throat. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with a crisp finish. Very drinkable. I have the sudden urge to stand in a bread line for hours in the freezing cold."
"Easily, the best Russian beer that has graced my palete."
"Served from a bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured almost black, and thick, but not as much as an imperial stout. The smell was of coffee, and a generally malty sense. The taste was fairly dry, with taste of coffee to it. Mouthfeel was somewhat heavy, with a bit of alcohol streaming through. I could probably have a couple pints of this one, but probably not too much more. All in all, an excellent porter, and at $3.50 for a 16.9 oz. bottle, an amazing deal!!"
"Dark brown (almost black) body with garnet-hued highlights. Head is thick, sticky, and light brown. Head retention is solid, leaving small trails and patches of lace. Smell of roasted barley, with notes of chocolate, coffe, and some not-quite-discernable fruit aroma. Strong flavor of roasted barley. Notes of chocolate and that mysterious fruit also present. Noticeable alcohol flavor in the bittersweet chocolatey/fruity aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth, but rather lighter and less viscous than I'd like to have in a big bad porter. Overall this beer, simply put, is outstanding."
"Color pours dark syrupy brown turning blackish as it levels into the glass, head is a supernatural light brown, much like that of parchment paper, so sad to see it go so fast. Leaves huge sheets of lace; nice. Smell is gorgeous with dark fruits, I detect cherry, melon, star fruit, and for sure bananas, hardly anything else, but who cares, this is awesome, its like a frickin fruit salad, super enchanting and pleasing nose. Tastes like no other I've had, mostly up front of banana and light, sweet roasted malt, very unusual and interestingly yummy. A bit like candied fruits but no sugary stuff, just the fruit, dark and rich. The feel is medium and quite full, very smooth and easy - no tricks to this creation. One fine porter with a bit of a different approach then most, and kudos to that. Loved this stuff!"
"Pours to a deep dark brown color with ruby highlights when held to light. The head is thick and light brown. It leaves a nice lacing when sipped down. The aroma is fruity, with a bit of roastiness and chocolate notes. The flavor is malty with a bit of roastiness. It has a dryness throughout; the type the sticks with you after each sip. This one was okay, but I wasnt overly impressed."
"My favorite Russian beer - and I live in Russia. The beer comes out of the bottle smoothly, with a nice dark reddish-brown hue and a healthy reddish-tan head that dissipates neither fast nor slow into a very nice lace most of the way down the glass. The aroma is full, with a touch of nut. The taste is full-bodied and smooth - cherries, nuts. a touch of chocolate. All of this with nice hoppy undertones. It's strong, but not overpowering, and the alcohol comes naturally, rather than being suger induced like most Russian ""strong"" beers. Just don't have more than two. In an ocean of bad Russian beers, Baltika #6 is a most welcome oasis."
"Pours a ruby-edged pitch under a thin ring of khaki foam. Mild dark chocolate, black cherry ice cream and late summer dust form the nose. Starts chewy roasted malt covered in honey to finish espresso with just a drop of cherry syrup. Moderately sweet. Lingers well until morphing unfavorably into a mustier version of coffee and syrup. Still quite tasty, though."
"Pours black, almost opaque, with a thing tan head that leaves patches of lace. Makes you think of a stout, although, I honestly don't know what separates a Baltic Porter from an Imperial Stout. Aroma is rich and impressive, toasted malt, molasses, coffee, chocolate and cherries. Flavor is quite bold, beginning with some sweet malt and dried fruits, then becoming more bitter, with flavors of coffee and chocolate. Has a full, smooth body, with low to medium carbonation. Finishes dry and crisp. This is an very good beer... complex and quite drinkable."
"This 500ml bottle poured a very dark brown in color with a beige head. After having a few other baltic porters today, Baltika felt thin and just a little lacking in taste. The coffee and sweet maple aromas are light. Tastes are sweet but not overly sweet and is missing any defining bitterness. A previous review astutely mentioned a cola syrup aroma and a sweet cola aftertaste. Finishes a little dry but overall it's very drinkable."
"I'm really liking these Baltic Porters...this is another dandy,,,black in color with a nice tan head...good nose...I get some mild molasses, sweet cocoa, and sweet sugars....also a tich of alcohol is present on the nose...mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and pretty thick....some alcohol emerges on the taste as it develops almost a slight doppelbock like flavor profile....a lot of Molasses and sugars on the flavor....highly drinkable... a hell of a beer....would definitely drink again and seek out..."
"Color is dark as dark can be, beneath a big, bubbly, crackling tan head. Aroma is full of cocoa, nuts, and sweet candyish flavors. Medium body, light in texture, but really tasty, rich, satisfying. The ABV is 7%, but I didn't feel it in the least. Wait a minute...okay, now I do! Very tasty, and a welcome surprise, an excellent porter, an enjoyable beer!"
