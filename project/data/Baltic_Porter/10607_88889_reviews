"My favorite Sixpoint brew. So, of course they changed it."

"It's got the advertised smoothness, though for all the beans I'd expect a more silky touch. It is creamy and quite lush, though, and it doesn't lack as the full body rolls on the tongue with a smooth and easy carbonation offering just enough of a bite with a focus working toward that velvety feeling. Alcohol adds a prickle but not much more, and it blends well."
""
"Reminds me slightly of Victory at Sea, but not as full in flavor and luscious. Still a fantastic coffee brew, even with over a year on it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not the average stout, this one has some bite to it. A bit of an olde ale flavor"

"O: A pretty solid beer. doesnt taste or drink like 10%, but it is really good. I am sure it was better fresh with the huge coffee arome and flavor people describe. Would have liked to get this fresh, but what can you do. very solid though!"

"O - I'm going to miss this beer. Sixpoint, bring this back! This is an amazing coffee/chocolate porter that hides it's 10% punch. It's balanced, it's different and it's amazing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great baltic porter, and a truly great use of coffee here, it stands tall."
""
""
"Medium bodied with average carbonation, and a burnt, bitter coffee aftertaste. Nothing special here. Glad I only picked up a single can."
""

"O-A damn good porter. Probably my favorite so far, but I have not had a porter in a few months so I'll have to try some more. Roasted coffee notes taste exceptional and the bitterness is rounded out well with the faint molasses taste."
""
""
"As I often seem to notice, the alcohol taste/burn is a little more present when the beer is colder [than suggested for the style]. There is a little bite at the end as the beer comes to temp, however."
""
""
""
"3.81/5.00"
"Dark brown pour with a creamy two finger beige head with great retention and crazy lacing. This nose is very malt forward with lots of sweet roasty coffee notes along with hints of vanilla, mocha, caramel, brown sugar, and some subtle hazelnut. The taste follows suit with lots of fresh roasty coffee up front along with hints of hazelnut, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, cocoa, and brown bread. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with above average carbonation and a bittersweet, slightly dry finish. The ABV is very well hidden. Overall, a very flavorful and easy drinking interpretation."
"Lastly - go out into some snow, maybe snowboard, ski or go for a slay ride, and appreciate that the biggest mistake made by the Sixpoint brewery was releasing such a wintery porter in the middle of summer when it could not be appreciated for the atmosphere that it provides."

"O- Got a 4-pack of this for 4 dollars on sale. Noticed it's best by date was 5 months ago but figured I'd give it a shot. The alcohol seems to be taking over and would like to try fresher some time. Still, as it is, a nice beer with complexity."
""
"The taste tends to play down the coffee and chocolate aromas of the nose in favor of a dark malt, earthy, fruity character. Oh yes, the chocolate and coffee do not disappear entirely but they don't present themselves as much in the flavor as they do in the aroma. 10% ABV and the alcohol is not detected. Decent Porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
"I've had my eye on this beer since the day I'd first seen it. I'm not sure why being as Sixpoint has never shown me much in the past. 3Beans falls in line with the rest of Sixpoints offerings I've sampled, it's good but with the selection today I won't be picking it up again. A four pack is more than enough for me."

"Can: Poured a dark clear brown color beer with a generous light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sublime coffee notes with well-balanced caramelized malt notes. Taste is also dominated by great coffee beans notes with almost no astringency or overly dry notes. Malt backbone is solid with good caramelized notes and no overly dry roasted malt notes with light residual sugar notes. Body is lighter then I was expecting for a 10% ABV beer with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I find it hard to distinguish the porter and thought this was more akin to a strong brown ale with loads of coffee."

"Overall: Personally, it felt mish-mashed and muddled with some noted coarseness."
""

""
""
"This is a relaxing beer that develops with warmth while unwinding in the early evening."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Nice rich aroma with great chocolate malt and coffee and that follows through for the most part in the taste. Goes down smooth and the alcohol is a bit hidden but has nice alcohol heat as it opens."
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is simply great. The Romano beans gave the beer a wonderful texture to allow the coffee and cacao beans to meld and mutate into something that wasn’t your typical coffee stout/porter. 3Beans poured a deep brown almost black with a substantial khaki head. The aroma was a perfect buttery chocolate with a hint of coffee to round it out. Let this brew warm because it holds a tang when it’s too cold, but releases into a roasted dark chocolate coffee wonderland when it warms."
"O - Nothing too outrageous but a fine go-to Baltic. Fun to drink, strong but hidden and good flavor."

"4.25/5"
""
""

"O- a very good coffee-forward porter that packs as much flavor as a stout. Drinks nowhere near its high ABV and balances nicely with the coffee beans and cocao"
""
""
""
""
"Deep reddish brown body and two plus finger thick foamy head made this beer look nice in the pint glass. The can it came in was well designed as well. The smell that the beer emitted was a heavenly mix of chocolate, coffee, and hops. I didn't even need to bring the glass to my nose to smell this. The taste was out of this world, with a perfect balance between sweet chocolate, toffee, dark cherries, and figs; and bitter coffee, hops, and burnt toast flavors. There was hint of lactic sourness in the finish. Very creamy in the mouth at first with and astringent punch at the end. Freaking outstanding introduction to this brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer- certainly a very nice coffee flavor here, with some quality coffee obviously used. It's also quite silky in the mouth, which is very pleasant. The only thing I'm not sure of is the presence of sort of a chalky graininess that intrudes on the flavors a bit. It's not bad, but it makes the beer a bit heavy and sort of simple compared to the more nuances coffee and roasted flavors. I think two beans would have been preferable here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is probably, hands down, the best Baltic Porter I’ve had to date. Sixpoint seemed to do everything right with this offering. This was a real treat!"
""
""
""
""
"Tried the Sixpoint 2Beans at the local Tap House & Grill. The beer poured a dark opaque with slightly off white head that left a very nice lace. The scent and taste were dominated by coffee/espresso. There was enough malt and hop to balance the astringent acidic yield of the coffee. The mouthfeel was full body with nice carbonation. Overall this was a nice Baltic Coffee Porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I had high hopes for this as sixpoint does a lot well, but this could have been improved. Still decent though, and for the price, worth giving it a shot."
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a 2 finger foamy grey-tan head. Decent lacing. Smell: Mildly sweet cocoa and coffee with piney hops in the background. Taste: Sweet cocoa and a touch of molasses up front followed by roasted coffee and a nice woody character in the middle before ending with a high amount of bitter piney hops at the finish. Aftertaste is roasted, very bitter and quite long-lasting. Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a fairly high amount of carbonation. Not quite as thick and creamy as I would have wanted. The hop oils really coat the mouth. Drinkability: Good drinkability. This is a sipper, but it’s one you’ll enjoy until the last drop. Overall: Very good beer overall. I like what they were going for with this one. While I don’t think it’s a home run, it’s still a beer I would definitely recommend trying, especially to the hopheads out there."
""
""
""
"Overall (4.5/5): Sixpoint 3Beans is an exceptional beer. This brew isn't special just because it uses unusual ingredients; it's a masterwork of intense flavor and carefully considered implementation of ingredients. I must emphasize, the mouthfeel is something to behold..this stuff goes down like a chocolate shake. This is the best beer of Sixpoint's that I've had. Wonderful."
""
"Overall this is a great Baltic porter with great typical cocoa notes. Light body and some bitterness was a little surprising but it's super tastey."
"O: Nicely balanced brew and good use of flavors to accentuate this style."
""
""
""
""
"Taste/feel: When I first got it, it just tasted like a somewhat bland cold coffee (definitely needed to warm up). After it warmed up... wow. Massive coffee, complimentary dark chocolate, and a moderate amount of warming in the throat from the alcohol. This seems to be a fairly popular morning beer here on BeerAdvocate, but this worked well for me as a nightcap. I will say that I did certainly enjoy 3Beans, but the alcohol isn't masked quite as well as I'd like it to be."
"O: A stout meant to highlight the coffee and chocolate flavors and it does it well. Delicious coffee and chocolate for that matter. Flavors are perfectly balanced and complementary as well. I really enjoyed this one even if it's a little bit of a one-note (two-note?) beer. My kind of notes though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, its a good beer. It has some excellent qualities (that cocoa chocolate on the nose is wonderful), but the off flavors bring the rating down on this one. Glad I was able to try this tough. If offered again in the future I would likely partake."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a mahogany dark brown with lace patches on glass and a mostly roasted, coffee and some dark chocolate aromas, although possibly some dark fruit (when it doubt - black cherries - although not really any tart or bitterness from aroma). Full bodied, thick, a little sticky, still goes down easy, the coffee and dark chocolate and something akin to molasses or even syrup (I guess licorice could be here instead but I'm not sure) sweetness blend together for a coffee like stout that maintains a java like sweetness. As you progress through the can, and its a sipper mind you, the alcohol and heat come into play more and the coffee beans are more pronounced. A wonderful beer that is very enjoyable to sip on for your nightcap."
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice hue, solid head, and some fair lacing. Nose is roasted malt and coffee accentuated with some chocolate notes. Flavor of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate... tastes like it smells. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
" Cheers!"
"O - Not particularly feeling this one, decent but alcohol and bitterness overpower. Maybe better with some age on it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A big porter with attitude, that being said, I could still enjoy 2 pints of this easily before it knocks me off a chair"
"O: A decent offering from 6P, this is sort of like a super alcoholic energy drink. Good for what it is, which is a blend of beer and coffee. Probably wouldn't spend the money on another 4-pack though"
""
""
"I have only had a few Baltic Porters, but this one may be the best. It fits the style description almost perfectly, with the bitter roasty notes playing first chair and the complementary sweet and/or fruity flavors all relegated to the rear. A nice complex and hearty beer."

"From can to tulip. Pours dark opaque brown with a creamy looking one finger khaki head. Aroma of nutty coffee, roasted malt, and ashiness. Nose is a little thin. Flavor is roasted makes and a hint of earthy coffee. Really this falls a little flat for me at first and was very thin for an imperial porter. Seems to pick up as I sip through and might be better on the warmer side. Medium carbonation and medium mouthfeel. Meh, not bad but won’t return to this one."
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown and from a vigorous pour I got a tall ample head of mocha colored foam that fell to some sticky lace. Just a little light around the edges makes it look like cola. Nose is delicious. Coffee, chocolate and dark caramel malt. Smells roasty and cold. Malt is prominent and sweet in the nose but hides a bit of bread. I can’t wait to taste it. Oh delight! Coffee, smooth chocolate some warming alcohol and little toast. Mouthfeel is thin and creamy. There is good earth and a little bitter from the hops and a touch of dark fruit on the back palate that makes this seem very decadent. The coffee is extremely well done and not the slightest bit burnt. The cocoa is like silk up next to it. The alcohol is a little too prominent to call it smooth but it rounds out with hints of vanilla as it warms. The bread in this is mild and really well done. Truly great."

"Overall: Very good beer overall. I like what they were going for with this one. While I don't think it's a home run, it's still a beer I would definitely recommend trying, especially to the hopheads out there."

"Very nice, worth seeking out. As rich as many Imperial Stouts."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"D: This was a decent double stout, with a great scent and body. But the taste wasn't anything special, and the finish was really rough, so it wasn't very easy to drink. Maybe age would help improve, but this brew was only mediocre fresh."
""
"(4.25) D: Sixpoint has impressed me with all their offerings and this is no exception. Lots of everything in this one which produces a taste profile with nice bold flavours. Could easily sip a couple of these in a sitting."
""
"12oz can pours a dark brown espresso-like color with a frothy, beige head, that holds good retention and leaves tons of lacing on the glass. Smells like chocolate, creamed coffee, hint of vanilla. Tastes are pleasant with notes of milk chocolate, cream, coffee, faint oak, raisin, dark fruit, peppery finish. Fullish mouth-feel, super creamy. A little boozy at times, but for 10% it's fairly well-concealed. Overall, nice chocolate and coffee notes here. Excellent!"
""
""
"O: Very dry on the mouth feel with not enough chocolate and dark fruit flavors that I associate with a good Baltic Porter. It needs a touch more roast and some body as well."
"O - Well, there's good news and bad news. Bad news first: With a name like 3Beans, I thought this would blow me away with coffee-dominated flavor, which didn't quite happen. Good news: I instantly didn't care, because this is a delicious and extremely well crafted brew. In a nutshell, this really is a sum of all parts, with a beautiful balance of all components that's enjoyable/easy to drink and very deceptive in the alcohol department. I'll absolutely enjoy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid Baltic porter and in a can."
""
""
""
""
"O - A balanced, pleasurable stout/porter. Where is the alcohol? It really drinks like a 5% ABV porter. 3Beans is a prime candidate for a sipping/dessert beer, but it also goes down really easy. My advice is to take your time with this one. I expected a bit more heft in the body, but overall it's a well crafted, flavorful beer."
"O: Finally, a Sixpoint that I really like. This is great. Right in line with the recent Dayman and Espresso RIS. I loved the combination and concept here, probably because it was perfectly executed. Now this is how you do chocolate and coffee, in a beer. I haven't had many Baltic Porters, but this one was top notch."
""
""
"This is a good beer. Nothing out of the ordinary. Above average. Solid. <shrug> Just a mite bit nondescript."
"Raul likes this, Raul likes this a lot."
""
""
"Taste is a very nice blend of coffee and cocoa with a soft, grassy hop bite. The ABV is very well hidden and goes down really smooth. This is top notch actually as far as non-bomber imperial stout/porter offerings. I was a bit hesitant to drop 13 bones on a 4-pack, but am glad I did so now and might even go pick up another. The smoothness of the beer along with a silky body is quite impressive. The legumes do seem to add a richer texture, especially if this is indeed a porter...it gives it a more stout-esque character."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not quite the smooth stout but overall a good stout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I traded for this and was by FAR the most I've spent on a beer (after shipping costs about $9 for 12oz), and it was completely worth it. This is just fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - The booze is well masked and this beer certainly has a unique flavor, although nothing that I will regret forgoing in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So, overall, an interesting beer. It doesn't quite live up to the hype of the concept, but it is a pretty solid chocolate and coffee strong ale. Worth trying."
""
"Overall I am going away from this very disappointed. As a lover of many imperial stouts some overly hoppy, others chocolaty, many just run of the mill this one does deliver everything but fails to be more than just a homebrew effort that doesn't deserve such high praise."
""
""
"Looked like coffee, smelled like coffee, tasted like coffee, but its not a coffee. Don't let the small can fool you. Its not the size of the can that matters. Its what is on the inside that matters. This beer packs a big dry roasted coffee punch. If you like your coffee beers then it would be a good idea to seek this one out. I wish I had a few more cans."
""
"This is a very interesting, unique beer. I give kudos to Sixpoint for pushing the envelope yet again. That said, I feel this is a touch too bitter and unbalanced toward the coffee side to be truly great. At the current price point of $13+ for a 4 pack, I'll be passing in the future."
""
"Overall: Pretty good, but not mind blowing. If you're a fan of porters or coffee stouts, it's definitely worth a try."
"Great coffee beer here!"
"O - A fine brew from Sixpoint. One I would enjoy when looking for an easy to drink coffee brew. I was expecting a bit more coffee to it, but a solid drinker none the less."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Very nice, well balanced and full flavored porter."
""
"Overall, I'm a little disappointed given all of the hype around this beer. To me it seemed like this beer was highly sought after, but in high supply. Not a bad beer. It's a good coffee and chocolate blend in a solid dark beer, but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not what I was expecting but it grew on me as I drank it. I've been to the brewery so drinking these always remind me of my trip."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz can into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours pitch black with a large light brown head. Smells of coffee, coffee, and did I mention coffee? Also smells of chocolate. Tastes of coffee, coffee, and chocolate, very deep taste, but sweeter than expected with the smell. Heavy body, but it is still very drinkable, carbonation is just right. Overall, a very good beer."
"O: This brewery just keeps making some solid good stuff, was very impressed by this beer, actually wish I bought two 4 packs instead of just one, really enjoyed this brew!"
""
"Fuller end of medium body with a dry, bitter and robust coffee presence that lingers over the dark malt profile into a bone dry finish.  Some dry oak and dark chocolate flavor complimented by espresso bean and burnt toast.  Subtle lactic presence and subtle sweetness balance things out.  Lots of coffee flavor but not a one dimensional coffee bomb.  Dry and acrid but easy to drink because the high abv is nicely masked.  Not a bad beer but not very interesting either.  "
""
"o - very drinkable and pleasant. very complex for this style and i wanted another."
""
""
""
"Overall: I think the booziness of this beer really comes and undoes all the other good stuff that Sixpoint did with this brew. It makes me wonder if they dumped sugar into the brew to get their OG up, as it tastes rather dry and boozy. It'd be a decent baltic porter otherwise, but I really can't bring myself to really enjoy this beer, even though I'll probably continue on and finish this one. (3)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Apparently I like to buy new Sixpoint beers because I like complaining. This was almost very good. The aroma is solid, and the chocolate notes are great. Unfortunately, the coffee combined with the oak aging doesn't quite work here. Still worth a try."
""
"[O] Too.Darn.Big. I think 3Beans could be a decent beer if the alcohol was a lot less obvious. Perhaps some aging, a longer lagering (or even a lager yeast instead of ale?) would go a long way too."
""
""
""
""
"O - Lots of coffee and not much else to get in its way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: For a domestic Baltic porter, this is not bad. This has got a lot of the black coffee taste that I was expecting. This beer is rich and solid and a must for a coffee drinker. That said, I prefer my tea and while I am happy to have one, I think the four pack would be a bit much for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a bit disappointing. It has the intense coffee notes that I was anticipating and the cacao made its presence known. These two notes are very good. However, there was a faint grainy aftertaste as well as a burning alcohol presence which really slowed down the drinking experience for me. In the end, this was still an enjoyable offering that I will definitely try to get my hands on again."
""
""
""
"O-A wonderful coffee beer, the 10% is well hidden."
""
""
"O: A coffee lovers dream. If you want a coffee beer, I would choose this over other coffee porters and even Founders Breakfast Stout. This is one smooth beer and very enjoyable one if you like coffee and roasty porters. Quite a good offering from Sixpoint, I wish they would make this a permanent addition to their line up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from the can a deep mahagony with well defined half finger light tan colored head,a little lighter in color than most I have had from the style.Aromas of dark roast coffee,bitter chocolate,and earth,it seems quite dry and no alcohol sweetness.Starts out with deep coffee roast with underlying unsweetened chocolate,mild molasses-like sweetness that quickly gets hit with a healthy dose of piney hops in the finish.This is a hopped up Baltic Porter,one of the dryer and complex of the style I have had,it's just a little sharp in the feel but this is pretty damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well balanced and not as sweet as I expected. A really nice beer."
"Sixpoint is solid and so is this brew. I don't know if I'd buy more than one at a time, though. One is probably enough for now."
"Verdict: A very intense beer from Sixpoint and possibly too much for me. This is really a palate killer when I wasn't expecting it to be. I'd hoped for a soft, sweet, silky beer that highlights the adjuncts but got something that was punishing and brutal."
"O: I think this could have kicked ass if it were, say, 8% and just a touch sweeter (not cloying, though). As it stands, it feels too much like hard work drinking it. Not bad at all, though - certainly a unique take on a 'coffee and chocolate' brew."
""
"This doesn't fall into the traditional baltic porter category for me. The chocolate and coffee jump into things and mesh with the typical characteristics in a pretty good fashion. It all seems to fight for dominance though never wins. Feel is good. Drinkability is good. I can dig it."
""
"EDIT - 09/2013: Had it again, and found the coffee to be much better, resulting in a better beer overall. Updating scores to reflect."
"O: A superb brew. I went into this not expecting a ton but hoping to really like it. I was supremely impressed."
""
"O – Very nice tasty brew. The ABV is present but not overwhelming. It has a nice complex taste and warms nicely. Definitely a sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
"Baltic porter?I don't know."
"O: I have been waiting to try this for a month. Interesting concept, better reality. 3Beans is an enjoyable mix of flavors blended well to avoid sweetness, but smooth and enjoyable to drink, worth the wait."
""
""
""
""
"O - This one really surprised me. After the smell, I was expecting much, but this one is actually pretty damn good. All the flavors of this one are very well balanced, and very drinkable. Thanks again jageraholic for sending this can my way!"
"O - I enjoyed the sweetness in this and it really suprised me in terms of your normal coffee beer varieties. The 10% abv is detected though with a lot of heat on the way down, I suppose the ingredients used contributed to high sugar/high abv. Glad to have tried this limited release."
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: can"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very interesting beer good coffee and chocolate meld, not overpowering."
""
"The beer pours almost black with over a finger of light tan head. The head fades to a layer on top of the pour and leaves some lacing on the glass. The smell is very roasty with a strong coffee and dark chocolate presence. The taste isn't very sweet at all and there is hardly a trace of alcohol. Lots of roasted malts along with the coffee and dark chocolate. The finish has a roasty bitterness to it. This is very easy to drink and I never would have guessed the abv. I'd definitely have more."
""
""
"It's pretty decent overall, just not incredible. I'm not really sure what to call it. BA labels it as a Baltic porter, which is probably close, but not quite right. I've see it also called an imperial stout (not even close) or a generic coffee stout (lacks some of the coffee punch for me). So it is a solid, drinkable, enjoyable beer with some good but not overly potent flavors. Would love to try it on tap some day to see if I feel differently. Interestingly, I often feel this way about Sixpoint's cans, that they lack the flavor punch that I am hoping them to have. Except for Resin."
""
""
""
"D - A good porter. Definitely a sipper. I appreciate the smaller format I wish I'd see in more high ABV beers. I'd try it again, preferably on draught."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, just not quite what I was hoping for. I'm probably gonna hold on to the rest of the 4-pack for a while hoping that some age will mellow out the alcohol flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I've had a couple of these and while I think it is a personal thing I am thrown off by what I feeling is a bittersweet chocolate taste in this beer. Something intrigues me though, as I keep coming back to try and figure it out. Always enjoy what I get from Sixpoint and will probably end up buying 4 more of these at some point."
""
""
"O: For coffee beer fans, this one is a standout. Stout, robust and ""wake up"" yummy."
"This was my first time finally trying a Six Point brew. Can't wait to try more varieties."
"O: cery good over all it would be tough to say that the the alcohol on the taste would go away with some aging however the coffee and coco flavor would desipate after a short time"

"The earthy bean character is undeniable. Oak balances the sweetness well. There's enough chocolate character to keep things in check. Interesting brew."
"Poured into a 12 oz snifter, best before July 2013. Pours a dark brown, with a 2 inch tan head, that slowly settles in patchy bubbles, leaving behind plenty of lace. Smell is dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, licorice, and some vanilla. Taste is all of that, vanilla leads the flavors, with some roasted coffee in the finish. Body is maybe medium, plenty of life, on the dry side, and easy drinking for its heft. This is a solid brew. I drank it close to room temperature and it tasted the best of the 4 pack I bought."

"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark maroonish-red, that verged on black, but not quite. A bit of translucency was evident. Tons of bubbles rising from the bottom, to a nice solid 2 finger thick head. Head was rich and thick, with a fair it of side cling. Aroma was a slightly sweet, chocolate smell, with a very small hint of acidic in the backend. Taste had both coffee and chocolate, without either overpowering the other or being the main focal point. The coffee notes kicked in first, with just a tab of bitterness, but then mellowed out and left a nice sweet cocoa flavor on the tongue. Coated the mouth extremely well, not overly bubbly with a bit of chew. Overall a very solid beer. Perhaps a bit expensive ($3.75 for the single can) but a very solid beer, right up my alley."
"M: Full bodied. Some creaminess."
"Overall - This brew is simply amazing! I must have got a very fresh batch since the characteristics seemed to point to that. Each sip impressed me all over again throughout."

"O: I was disappointed with this one and it score very low (unanimously) across the board at a recent coffee beer tasting."
"O: This is a great once-in-a-while beer, which packs a lot of flavor and a complexity of character to boot. I'm usually not one for ""flavored"" beer, or even beer brewed with flavoring agents other than hops, but this one really does it right. A trip to the jungle of flavor in your mouth!"

"Overall, the most enjoyable things about this beer was the flavoring, and the silky soft feel. The “three beans” were actually all apparent at one point or another, each adding depth and complexity. The malts through the backbone were strong, roasty, charred, smoky, and above all, flavorful. This, coupled with the soft, frothy feel, made for a wildly drinkable, delicious brew."
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, I certainly won't have a problem finishing the four pack, but I'm not really sure if I'd buy another. Had the body been a little bigger, thicker, and the flavors been bigger, more complex, I think this really would've been an amazing beer. Worth a try."

"M&D&O- wheres the 10%? Sixpoint does a fine job of maksing a double digit ABV behind some solid, albeit not terribly earth shattering flavors. A fine porter with great flavors, it deserves a place among a porter lineup, but it doesn't redefine the style, I guess I am trying to say, this is a good beer and Sixpoint continues to impress. And that the good people over at Sixpoint should send a pint glass in my direction! Ooops, was that out loud."

"The beer has a brown cola body with a thick, creamy, beige head. Ample lacing coats the glass. the aroma is coffee beans all the way. The flavor is big time coffe. Chocolate covered espresso beans, roast. Medium bodied and creamy on the palate. Alcohol content hidden beautifully. Perhaps this beer is one dimensional, but if you enjoy a big, rich coffee stout, you should seek this out. Yum."
"Overall a great Baltic porter and a really interesting concept."

"A lot of bitter chocolate and espresso. Yes, quite bitter. A nice roasty sipper. The 10% abv is not detected."
""
""
"Pours pretty much black with just a hint of dark brown and ruby red towards the bottom of the glass. Finger length off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a thick lacing around the edges. Smells of mostly coffee beans, as well as some vanilla/carmel, bakers chocolate, and some roasted malt. Taste starts with intense, roasted coffee beans. Much stronger taste than the aroma suggests. Almost imparts an earthy flavor from the coffee beans. Then smooths out in the middle. Get some vanilla or carmel that acts like a coffee creamer and lightens the intensity of the coffee. Then the finish brings back some intense coffee flavors, in addition to some carmel, some bittersweet chocolate, as well as some bitterness from the fairly heavy hop presence. Sweetness increases as the flavor profile moves on. Pretty full body with a creamy and slick mouthfeel. Lively carbonation that reminds you that this is an imperial porter, not an imperial stout, and makes the beer much more refreshing for a full-bodied beer. No alcohol detected in the smell or taste. Good stuff."
"O - A very excellent beer....but I can't say I'd grab another four pack when Founders FBS is sitting right next to it at $3 cheaper."
""
""
"O: Disappointing and borderline unpleasant (and that's from a guy with a refrigerator full of 20 different stouts/porters at any given time). In the two-word descriptions that I try to record for every beer (so I can best remember them), I'd use either ""Mocha Everclear"" or ""Big Blech""... Missed it here (or else I got an insanely bad batch)."
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a deep brown color that is basically black. There is a big foamy tan head on top. The lacing is light along with the retention. The smell of the beer is chocolatey with a bit of coffee on the nose as well. It also smells sweet. The taste of the beer is roasted, the coffee isn't that strong. There is a bitter dark chocolate flavor in the finish. The mouthfeel is pretty creamy, light carbonation and smooth. Overall it's not all that impressive. I'm surprised the rating is as high as it is. Not something I need to have again."
"Overall, this is a decent beer that doesn't blow me away and could have used more pronounced coffee and chocolate notes."

"This beer comes by way of the legendary woodychandler. Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of coffee, chocolate. Taste is strong coffee, some hints of chocolate, the 10% alcohol is very well hidden. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall, if you like coffee, give this beer a shot."
""

""
""
"Overall: There are a lot of bold flavors that compete for the tastebuds' attention and, to my palate, they never quite form a harmonious whole; I was expecting a coffee stout and would hardly think of this as a Baltic Porter but it is really one of those style benders; others obviously like it but this one just has too many clashing flavors for me"

"Nearly full on black, beautiful rings of lace on the glass. Big display of aromatics, bold roasted coffee, cacao nibs, black berries, mild charcoal and faint rose water. Semi-creamy fullish body, lots of backbone here. Rustic vibe, mellow overtones of chocolate with a lush brushing of coffee. Floral, clean alcohol, kiss of malt sweetness and a balanced hoppiness let the beans unleash their full complexities. At 10% you can feel the warmth but no heat at all, a pleasure to drink and it is obviously a sipper ... perfect portioned can."

"The taste is out of this world, the balance of coffee and choc is great, u taste them both. It also has some roasted malt to it also. The mouth feel is spot on and overall a darn good beer."
""

"O: I'm glad I found a brew by this maker I dig. I'm a stout/porter kind of guy, so it was no surprise I got into it, but it had been a while since I had found something this fun. I will be buying this again...and honestly I can't think of a bigger praise for a beer."
"Dark brown to black, healthy head and moderate to low-moderate lace. Cola, alcohol, medicinal. Medium to medium-heavy body, slightly acidic, some coffee roast, alcohol. Strong bitter finish. Alcohol borders on the harsh side. Burnt characteristics without malt sweetness to offset. Judging by the many favorable reviews, worth a second try, preferably on tap."
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Beige head, moderate to low retention on a dark ruby, almost black body. Clear oily, sticky lacing. Aroma includes roasted malt, cocoa puffy chocolate, coffee and vanilla. Taste closely follows the aromas. Medium mouthfeel, NO alcohol noted on aroma or tasting. Insanely drinkable considering the abv. Really, really a tasty beer, borderline genius."
"Pours a hazy orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, burnt coffee, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with some intense coffee flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid coffee aromas and flavors."
"O: 3Beans may not be just what I want from a coffee beer, but the flavors it encompasses vary so much that it makes it a pleasure to drink at every sip. Really, I don’t think anyone expected that pairing Oreos with a Stone IPA would be a satisfying experience – but somehow, in this instance, it clicked. I’ll certainly be heading back to the bottle shop for more."
""
"O - An interesting beer from Sixpoint that's very unique compared to all the other Porters out there, definitely worth a try."
"Certainly not a bad beer at all. I've heard the price for this is around 13$ for a four pack of cans. A little on the high side, but it's not too bad. This is a good beer for those who like coffee, and roasted malty beers that have undeniable hop presence."

"The Crack revealed another brimful CAN and an inverted Glug was deemed to be in order. Proceeding in a manner completely counter-indicated by the owner's manual, I soon had what resembled an ice cream Sunday in my glass. Two dense, unmoving fingers of deep-tan head sat atop a bed of deep, dark liquid. More precisely, a deep, dark-brown liquid that, stingily, would not allow any light to penetrate its depths. The nose smelled like the moment this afternoon that we walked past a a coffee roaster's shop this afternoon in Fell's Point. You have to be a coffee drinker to appreciate the Pavlov's dog-like response that the smell of coffee elicits in a coffee drinker and ever since BMCS (SW) Gerard Wargo got me drinking black coffee in the Deck Department office of the USS Fulton (AS-11) in 1984, I have been hooked. Now, as the head fell, I began to foam at the mouth like a rabid dog. Mouthfeel was thick and full, like a mouthful of pudding and the roastiness of the coffee hit first, followed by a chocolatiness and finally, a smooth vanilla flavor. The finish lingered with a coffee roastiness along with a bitterness of dark chocolate. This would have been great to share with The Old Lady on Valentine's Day, but I am keeping this one to myself."
""
""
"O: really misses a lot of what should make it good. Very bitter, and yet, somehow backed up by nutrasweet. I'll age the other can in hopes this mellows out or in case I got a bad one because this never comes together."

"O- great baltic porter, all around well balanced and delcious"
"As much as I liked it, I think I'm still partial to the Imperial/Double Stout style a la Narwhal."

"O-this is just a great beer. Baltic porter? Maybe not, tastes more like a strong English stout. There is hardly any abv in the taste, it's so smooth. I bought this not understanding what it was, thinking maybe it was an average brown ale, but I was completely surprised and satisfied with this beer. I suggest your try this if you see this."

"I had this on tap at The Pour House in Westmont, NJ. In retrospect I should have started with it instead of finishing. It has an extremely heavy flavor and feel. Coupled with the higher alcohol content it was probably poor timing for me. It tastes very good and I would have given it a better rating, but I guess it was just too much for me at the time."
""
"Served in a Leffe chalice (whatever), dark brown-black pour, topped off with a nice creamy cap of tan head; good retention, stratifying lacing. In the nose, dark malts, coffee, cocoa, very smooth all over. More of the same in the taste, more emphasis on sweet, less on roasty/bitter, dark malts, coffee (very nice), cocoa, caramel, cream. Smooth mouthfeel, medium-full body, full of flavor, and higher ABV extremely well-hidden. Great beer overall. Too bad it's a one-off."
""
"Deep brown with a glint of ruby. Thin, but creamy head. Unfortunately that was the best part of the beer. I find the nose to have almost an artificial coffee smell (im sure they used proper coffee though) to me it smells young and undeveloped with very little roast character or astrigency. There are notes of toffee hard candy and faintly talcum powder and fusels. The beer is far too watery for my liking and a little too lively on the carbonation. the coffee and chocolate notes are there but the fall off the tongue too quickly. There is a little more astringency to the coffe than I had anticipated, which I like but this beer finishes too soon. Not much hopping comes through and the finish is a tad cloying. Not bad, but not what I expected for a 10% coffee, chocolate beer. Also not sure what the romano bean is doing. It just says adds complexity in the box so..."

"Clear chestnut brown with a dark khaki head that is quite impressive. Garnet highlights when held up. Decent lacing here and there. A bouquet of coffee and roasted grains greet my waiting nose, with healthy chocolate notes layered in the sweetness of light alcohol, mild cherries and burnt molasses. A hint of the oak gives faint vanilla. Taste is all the nose would have you believe and more. A double espresso with a mochachino chaser. The oak tinged cherry and vanilla flexing nicely. Some burnt sugary sweetness that flows into a healthy charcoal and hop bitterness in the finish. Feel is sublime with a rich full velvety creaminess. Carbonation is just the right proportion to keep it highly drinkable. A great winter beer that I would love any time of the year."

"Overall: Solid beer from Sixpoint. Doesn't really hit the spot for people who want a strong coffee / beer balance in coffee porters, but luckily I'm not one of those people. Not necessarily a home run, but there's many elements that are superbly done, and the overall experience is satisfying."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice, reddish tinted dark brown, fluffy tannish tinted head. Smell of bitter roast and ground cocoa bean and espresso bean, light nuttyness, mild sweetness and some berry notes. Taste dials down the scent a bit, notes of dry, bitter, heavy roasted coffee and cocoa, mild berry notes, earthy and grainy, dry oak, some vanilla, minimal sweetness. Fuller side of medium, dry and lingering fruitiness. Solid selection, smoother cocoa and coffee notes preferred but makes this interesting."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is quite good. It's atypical of the style, but quite interesting. With the possible exception of Resin, this is the best canned Sixpoint I've had."
"Overall – Not likely one I would go too again. A little too bitter and astringent at the end with the taste and the feel a bit off for me. OK, but for the cost not really worth it."
""
""
""
"Poured from a can into a snifter, the beer appears thin on the pour, with a chestnut highlighted dark brown coloring and a clingy, frothy, off-white head that starts around an inch and slowly settles into a filmy coating. Aromas of creamy, smooth, blended and balanced vanilla and chocolate, with an undertone of bitterness from both chocolate and coffee. Very well blended and complimentary aromas as you consume. Flavors of rich, dark roasted coffee and bitter cocoa nibs right off the bat. Wow...this is damn tasty! Creamy backbone of vanilla and oak support the rich and bitter forefront attack on your tastebuds, and there is a strong, solid, boozey tail-end flavor that bleeds into the aftertaste. Some earthy and woody highlights help to add depth to the overall character of the beer. Creamy and slightly boozey aftertaste, with a lingering mocha charateristic. The lighter body lends itself to a clean, slightly dry finish. Great beer. Well crafted and very well balanced. Bravo!"
"Overall (4.0): This beer is unique, I’d say. It offers a very interesting balance between coffee, chocolate (but chocolate in a way that feels different), malt, and some other aspects as well. The alcohol is noticeably present, but suitable and welcome for the size and character of the beer. But what’s really great is that this beer really opens up into something different and thoroughly enjoyable as it warms. Flavors re-arrange, the feel transforms, and it just becomes something different and definitely tasty. Recommended."

"Fuller medium body, well carbonated, chewy and sticky on the palate. This is easily one of the better canned Sixpoint offerings of late, and I really wouldn't have pegged this at 10% abv."
""
""
""
"O- Not a disaster, but it doesn't quite work for me. I won't miss it when it's gone, and that's coming from a major Sixpoint fan."
""
"Overall: I first have to thank Mike at the Superstar Beverage (Deer Park, NY) for convincing me to get this gem, this beer is incredible. I normally resist to grab porters just because of the fact I prefer stouts but this one is a strict win/win situation. It costs a notch more than most Sixpoint beers but it will definitely not disappoint. Salud!"
""
""
"O: A decent beer, though one with a few flaws. Personally, I find it to be more of a flavored brown ale than a Baltic Porter. Good flavors, though the beer seems to have pulled too much from the barrel."

""
""
"Great beer with real depth. The chocolate kept the coffee from being too bitter. Another one of those easy-drinking beers that you need to be careful of, given it's high ABV."
"O: Considering its strength, this beer is very easy to drink because the alcohol is masked very well (except for some hints of it towards the finish). I really like the balance between the coffee and chocolate because it really seems to provide a perfect mix of bitterness and sweetness."
""
""
""
"Snowy night here in the Northeast. Just finished with my snowblower and thought I would treat myself to some stouts. The 3Bean was the first I had. No question about more coffee this time around. Everything was almost perfect. Very soft and big in my mouth hitting every sense there. Aftertaste was just as it started, a nice soft chocolate but mucho cafe stout/porter. After I tasted this one, I went on to the next (which will be seen updated)"
""
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, developed a dense tan head which lasted through the drink and laced greatly. Appearance was a ruby / brown with an aroma of malt, grass and toffee. Taste was intense with strong notes of chocolate, coffee and caramel with some spice and malt on the back. Mouthfeel was full and creamy with a dry, malt aftertaste."
""
"O - This is one delicious beer. Glad I have several more in my fridge. Sixpoint is 2 for 2 for me, but this is the better one."
"Cola black in body with tan frothy head that's stays around. Aroma of acidic coffee, mild bourbon sting, roast, tobacco. Tastes of coffee, dark cocoa, roast, burnt bread, tobacco, earth and herbal notes. Creamy with low carbonation. Sessionable for a big beer. Tobacco may be a bit much but very nice coffee flavor and chocolate. Tastes better than it smells. Solid, enjoyable."
""
"Lighter in body than would be expected from a 10% porter. Very bitter with a slick texture. This beer started off promising but tailed off drastically towards the end. An odd brew for sure, but kudos for originality and thinking outside the box. Worth a try if you like a strong coffee flavor in your beer."
"I really enjoyed it. Nice experience"
"I will take a wild guess here and say that this is the first Baltic Porter I've enjoyed out of a can. Well it was packaged in a can, but I poured it into a glass, this time anyways. Smells of coffee and chocolate mostly with the coffee being the dominant aroma. Light earth, ash, light dark fruit and a touch of alcohol round out the nose. The flavor is sweet with caramel and burnt sugar , a hint of chocolate and a burro load of Juan Valdez. Light ethanol flavor and a touch of dark pitted fruit flavor add a hint of complexity. Medium to thick body with a creamy but coarse mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. This is a nice porter if you like a coffee bomb."
"Looked at the reviews expecting to see this in the high 70s, was shocked to see the reviews so positive, honestly thought this was a mess."
""
"Overall pretty nice. I wish the coffee was a bit stronger as it advertises a lot, but the malt profile is quite nice, and coffee eventually comes out nicely. THe hops are an interesting surprise but maybe a bit too much. The booze is OK, but maybe a little too much as well. REally just wish the coffee was a bit more."
""
""

"O - very good and enjoyable."
""
"This is full bodied with sharp carbonation. I would like this a lot if I hadn't had so many better examples of coffee beers. As it stands, the taste here is middling."
""
"12oz. can served in my Weyerbacher tulip. Pours a deep brown with dark ruby highlights around the base when the light hit the glass just right. Head is half an inch and tan-colored and leaves a residual band of lacing as it slowly recedes. Nose expresses cocoa, dark fruit and roasted coffee. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's a distinct, hoppy bitterness at the finish that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a crisp carbonation and a hint of acidity that is detectable at the finish. Overall, a pretty enjoyable beer with quite a few different levels to it. Too bad it's a one-off."
""
"The beer pours a dull, hazy, dark brown with an inch of fluffy tan head that laces. It presents much better than expected with such a large abv, to which I attribute to the romano beans. The nose has potent notes of sweet chocolate and coffee. It's both bitter and sweet. The taste is reminiscent of a cold ""hot chocolate"" with huge amounts of chocolate sweetness upfront that transitions to a hoppy-coffee bitterness. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth, but drinks like most coffee porters- slightly watery, but lacking the body you'd expected based on the smell and taste. The aftertaste is huge gush of roasty, bitter chocolate. I enjoyed this beer and it was surprisingly flavorful. I didn't grab much of the fruitiness I expect with a Baltic porter, but it certainly packed in enough flavor."
""
""
""
"The bitterness really builds with this guy, dominating the palate....in a good way. This is a mighty fine coffee porter."
""
""
"O: This heavy-hitting, uber-flavorful Baltic Porter may clock in at 10% ABV, but it's dangerously drinkable on its own and could be even better with a chocolate or berry-accented dessert. I'm glad I got to try this limited-run, dark, strong specialty brew; seek it out!"
""
""
""
""
"Giving in to this taste would be detrimental to health and mind as this beer hides its alcohol deceptively well. Its sultry attitude with savory, hearty sweetness, and casual effort makes it somewhat sessionable- a horrible blend for those ""lush-like-me"" types."
""
"Overall I don't find much Baltic ""sense"" about this (not getting that banana feeling) but in terms of what this is, it's pretty darn fun, and certainly a great take for a style I am a little averse to."
"This is a medium to lighter bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. I think the label/description reads like a hell of a good idea and has potential but it just didnt totally transcribe well in the glass. The look of this brew is damn near perfect but thats where the best attributes end. The smell is ok and the taste has its moments of brilliance that are short lived. I purchased a 4-pack of this and drank my first yesterday and was let down thinking my senses must have been off that day. Having it again tonight made me realize this just isn't that good of a brew."

"O: It is an interesting beer and solid, but not worth the price tag. There are coffee and chocolate elements but they could be bigger. It's a good beer but nothing more."

""
"D - A very nice very rewarding brew from Sixpoint... I'm challenging to think of anything that quite compares as this one is rather unique... I can recommend with a clean conscience and will gladly seek out and enjoy again without hesitation..."
"D - A very good beer. Goes down way too easy for 10%. Dessert like but without the dessert sweetness."
"O. It is quite flavorful and complex. For a coffee porter, it is right up there with anything I've had."
""
"O - It's a solid beer. To someone who isn't as sensitive to boozy beers, it'd probably be quite good if you don't like a full bodied beer. I find the odd flavor I get in the middle of each sip somewhat off putting. Not really sure what that is. Overall I think it's balanced nicely and gives you the desired chocolate and coffee flavors. After having Resin and whatnot, I wasn't going to give Sixpoint a second look, but this beer is probably the best they've brewed so far. I'd at least give it a try if you see it."

""
""
"Overall- This is incredible! Might surpass Breakfast Stout in the realm of coffee beers."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep brown with a puffy, but bubbly head not unlike Coca-Cola. The head rapidly dissipates to less than a half inch in height. Nevertheless the lacing is fantastic, sticking heavily to the sides of the glass as the beer goes down. The aroma is very intriguing... At first there is an almost maple, or molasses scent, but then the milk chocolate and boozy bourbon kicks right in. A vanilla bean sweetness is faintly detectable in the background. For the taste, I agree with other reviewers who find this to be coffee-forward. The dark chocolate aspect competes however, wrapped in a more subtle smokiness, and a splash of bourbon. The finish is a bit wood-y and dry, and has a medium mouth feel. Very warming on its way down but stops just short of having too much alcohol heat. Overall an interesting beer, definitely worth trying. It's different, but could be more balanced."
""
""
"O: The alcohol is surprisingly well hidden in this beer and I love the packaging form factor (the 12 oz. Red Bull style can is just awesome). Glad that I have the opportunity to try this one (as it is a one time brew) and I appreciate the fact that Sixpoint collaborated with Mast Bros. Chocolate and Stumptown Coffee - both quality local artisans. I found the beer relatively easy to drink and enjoyable. Not sure this is a typical Baltic Porter but definitely a nice Imperial style porter."
""
""
"d: Given the high alcohol content this beer is very drinkable. It's a bit sweet for more than one or two at a go, though."
""

"Very interesting brew. Need to drink this warmer to let the coffee come through. Quite earthy, good fireside brew."
""

"O: a delightful porter, deceptively strong, definitely rebuy-able"

"I think this beer would have faired much better without the oak aging. The coffee had so much potential but it was lost to the wood. It's s decent beer but I expected more."
""
""
"o - overall, a nice beer from sixpoint. i had to see what the hub bub was about and it is fairly good and can hang with many big coffee beers."
"I'd have to say this is probably the best beer that Sixpoint distributes. With Resin and now 3Beans, Sixpoint has stepped up their game a bit. I'd definitely revisit this one."
"O: Definitely one of the most chocolate and coffee forward beers I've had without going overboard on the sweetness (yes, I'm looking at you, ST Mokah). Disappointed this is a one-off, although I can see why it is with the actual cacao and coffee being added. Definitely recommended while it's still available"
"12 ounce can, best before 10JUL2013 (as stamped on bottom of can). Served in a snifter, the beer pours very dark brown with about a half inch tan head that didn't stick around for long. There is a good amount of lacing. It smells like coffee, roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, caramel and some nuts. It tastes like coffee, chocolate (milk and bittersweet), cream, nuts, roasted malt and some vanilla. It's a little more bitter and roasty than sweet tasting. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. I think this is a good brew, although I'd like it better if it was in 16 ounce cans instead. $8.99 a 4-pack."

"Overall it was excellent and I hope this is a regular production beer from SixPoint. A very high recommendation, I want to get some more of this ASAP. Not many people get excited about a Baltic Porter in general, but this is one Baltic Porter that may get the masses raving about it."

"O- very tasty beer and very sweet. So much chocolate it almost doesn't taste like beer."
"...so resin WAS my favorite sixpoint beer but this just blew it out of the water. i have never tasted such a damn good coffee porter... make that coffee beer. so sweet yet so roasty. so damn dangerously easy to drink and delicious."
"This is a really nice example of a baltic porter. The alcohol bothered me but I wonder if one could age a beer in a can to see if it mellows? Regardless, if you're looking for a challenge to your palate, check this out!"
""
"Not bad. It's a very bold Baltic Porter. It's a nice coffee beer, better than average, but something wasn't hitting for me."

"Final Judgement: I'm glad Jack didn't plant any of these 3 beans because we'd be deprived a fine brew. Find it and try it."
"Poured can into Great Lakes snifter. Pours a cola color with clarity on the pour. As it collects in the glass, it appears dark brown with a tan head. Decent amount of lacing present on the pour. The nose starts with bold and bitter cacao nib character. This comes off a bit harsh up front but fades into a more decadent coffee aroma. The nose definitely leans towards the bitter side of things with a dash of earthy huskiness and an ever so faint hop presence. The taste is a bit more refined than the nose led me to believe. The cacao again is present first followed by a nice bold and robust coffee character. Leaves more of an espresso quality as the bold roasted beans linger through the palate. This is a little drier than most coffee chocolate brews I have encountered and at first left a little to be desired. As it warms and develops in the glass, I rather enjoy the bold and bitter onslaught of coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is lacking in my opinion. It is simply too thin to hold up to the presence of adjunct ingredients. Overall, this is a unique offering that is better than the other Sixpoint stuff I have had. It seems to grow on me with each sip. Worth a try."

"Nothing like a biblical quote taken slightly out of context on a Red Bull-style can. The contents pour a deep, dark garnet topped by a finger of sturdy sandstone foam. The nose comprises mild coffee, roasted malts, cocoa powder, light cola, light molasses, and a pinch of brown sugar and clove. The taste brings in more of the same, with both the coffee and the chocolate coming through grainier, more bitter. In fact, nearly all of the sweetness inherent in the smell has been drained out here. There's also a vague sense of spruce or something similar thereto hanging around as well. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a slightly creamy feel, and a drying finish. Overall, an interesting concoction, one that seems to make good use of the combination of ""beans", somehow simultaneously focusing on them and not letting them overpower all else."

"Overall - This is really good. Reminds me alot of founders breakfast stout but this is something bigger, bolder, thicker and has a real coffee flavor. Very smooth and drinkible, maybe the only flaw would be the alcohol warm. This totally should be made annually. Im starting to learn that when you see a skinny 12 oz can from sixppoint brewing, get excited."
"O: It's chocolate rich and smooth."
""

"O - Overall I liked this beer, until it warmed up. Became pretty bad infact once it warmed, where did those dark fruits and incredibly burnt flavors come from?"
""
""
"O- Great coffee beer. Not quite as good as Wake-n-Bake, but it definitely competes. Extra points for being so strong yet drinkable."
"Overall a really good beer, super smooth and delicious"

"A pretty good Baltic porter and definitely worth buying a four-pack at least once. The beer definitely makes the cold Boston days easier to get through."

"o - Overall a really nice beer; reminds me of a coffee stout or a milk stout. Lots of sweet chocolate and coffee to it and very easy to drink. Would definitely pick this one up again, and look forward to trying it again."
"O-a solid offering from Sixpoint, nice flavor"
""
"O: Overall, not one of my favorite Sixpoint offerings. I expected deeper roasted flavors from each of ""3 beans," and the alcohol presence was a bit overwhelming."
"I am at odds... this is so close to being a home run. The carbonation and mouthfeel really kill it for me, if this was a bit creamier or smoother in some manner it would rock, that said this is a very interesting beer and worth your while seeking out to try, t definitely makes a statement, like it or not."

"Poured pitch black from the can with thick lacing down my mug. The aroma is thick with the Stumptown coffee, while tangy, bitter cocoa pulls through stronger in the flavor. The flavor tend to trade back and forth in the beer's character, over the black-roasted barley. The dark flavors blend and run into a long, lingering aftertaste. It's slightly dry and surprisingly drinkable for a 10% dark beer, but I suppose Baltic porters go down more easily than an imperial stouts."
"12oz can with a Best Before date of 10 July 2013. Pours a dark black color with an inch of frothy tan head. Lots of lacing. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and hints of vanilla. The taste is a nice taste of mocha with some warming alcohol and roasted malts. Some earth along with some sweetness. Not getting as much vanilla as in the nose. Bit of a caramel and mocha finish. Lots of carbonation. Overall, a nice mix of the chocolate and coffee flavors that works well. Worth grabbing again."
"As it warms the coffee aroma becomes more pronounced. The chocolate taste, by the way, is nicely balanced way below most of the rest of the flavors. This may be the best coffee flavored brew I have ever had. Hurray for Sixpoint!"

"O: I was disappointed by this beer. It feels very disjointed, and doesn't mesh well at all. Coffee has a strong presence on the nose, but gets a bit lost in the taste. It's too boozy, and the oak is a slight distraction. To me the base beer comes across as a brown ale/brown porter (though it tastes rather clean), and the body just can't support all the adjuncts at work, never mind the oak and the 10% abv. My least favorite Sixpoint beer."
""
"O/D-I have been and will be a sucker for Sixpoint. This is easily one of my favorite offerings from them; if not my favorite. Its big and unwavering. If you have any interest in coffee and/or chocolate. Get this. I wish my coffee tasted like this each morning…I also wish my coffee made me feel like this in the morning too. Also this is the best looking can I have ever seen."
""
"O- Fan-stinking-tastic. I'll be seeking more of this ASAP. Sixpoint, you've done it again."
"Taste is again..fresh coffee. A bit of vanilla oak, and a tad of chocolate. Super super smooth. Such an awesome porter...its basically like the gorilla warfare porter on steroids; which is a good thing! Have one now!"
"O - As per usual with Sixpoint, I'm glad I tried it, but nothing about this beer makes it stand out and yell ""HEY!!! I'M FRIGGIN' EPIC!!! DRINK ME NOWWW!!!"" Don't get me wrong, I LOVE all of their year-round offerings, but none of their seasonal brews have stood out above the rest to me. However, the Idea of brewing BEANS into a beer to boost protein content and add naturally-occurring sugars is something I find intriguing, and will test myself, sometime in the near future. Also, if you are a home-brew nut, and are feeling adventurous, let me know... I just brewed a batch of Root Beer Stout, that will finish in March, and would be glad to share the recipe! All that said... Have a good good!"
"Roasted malts up front, along with dark chocolate bitterness. Dark fruit and rum sweetness fills in the palate. Notes of carob and molasses. Roasted coffee picks up and increases into the finish. More chocolate notes make for a nice mocha effect. Light vanilla and wood/oak in the finish. Lingering dark fruits, caramel, along with complementary dark chocolate and coffee bitterness. Medium-full body with a slightly creamy feel. Could be a touch thicker. Still, a very delicious beer."
"Pours dark dark brown, black, with a foamy two finger head. Subtle smells of coffee, dark chocolate, earthy. Taste is also subtle coffee, milky chocolate, smokey, a slightly bitter hop backbone. Texture is smooth, not too thick for 10%. Overall I think this pretty good and flavors balance well. I wish the coffee and chocolate flavors were more prominent but this was definatly a good pick up."
"O: This is good stuff. Toes the line between roasty and chocolatey, with roasty and roasted coffee prevailing early, but chocolate stepping up as it warms up a little. Plus it packs a nice buzz."
""
"O: Very underwhelmed with this one. I had high hopes and I was disappointed. To be fair, I'm probably a little more critical of coffee brews, but this is one of the only times I've sipped a SixPoint brew and wasnt overly impressed."
"O- This beer didn't impress me as much as I was hoping it would, but for the price it's extremely hard to beat. It was a bit too bitter for me and slightly on the thin side. The coffee and chocolate wasn't as robust as I was hoping it would be. That being said for $2.50/can this beer is one of the best for it's price range. I'd recommend trying it out."

"O - A very easy drinking baltic porter. The 10% is hidden well. Almost too well--as I finish the glass (and the beer approaches room temp), it starts to resemble stale sweet root beer. I'll revisit, but not the most pleasant finish. 3.75"

"Really nice looking beer here. Lovely light tan two finger head. Lacing and speckling abound. Milk chocolate color with translucent edges of deep reddish brown. Rather inoccous aroma. It is slightly roasty, slight coffee quality and a hint of that cacao. Aromas of oak...no. I am pleased with the flavor more so then the aroma. A complex blend of coffee, cacao and roasted barley. The coffee flavour is round, soft, and apparent. The cacao/chocolate is subtle but present. The roast marrys well without being acrid. I detect no oak. If this is in fact a baltic porter it makes sense. There is a cleanness to this beer obtainable only through lagering. For a ten percent beer the alcohol does not get anywhere near detectable. The beer is clean on the palate, not cloying, slightly roasty and pleasant. This is one of the finest offering from sixpoint I have yet had. The beer is very drinkable, flavorful, but in the end complexity is somewhat lacking."

"Overall - A great, well balanced, and delicious Baltic porter from Sixpoint. Glad to see them offer this kind of style, cause, lets face it, you don't see it all too often."
"Is this a ""one off", or will it be a regular in the Sixpoint line? I admit I am somewhat confused. Please make this fine beer often and in lage quantities."
"O: A very good beer and one I see drinking quite often. Really enjoyable and amazing the way it hides the alcohol very well. Only complaint is that it is called 3Beans and would like to see a little stronger coffee taste."
""

"O: This is the first Sixpoint beer I've had that I haven't been able to recognize as a Sixpoint. Their distinct hop flavors are fairly absent here, allowing their malts (and Romano beans) to mingle with the Mast Brother Chocolate cacao husks and Stumptown Coffee Roasters cold-brewed coffee. It's refreshingly light, for the amount of flavor it packs in. And the aftertaste is really lovely. I'm left craving just a little bit more roasty or smokey notes to round out the flavor profile."
