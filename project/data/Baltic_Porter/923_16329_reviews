"It's OK, but nothing special."
""

"Nefarious Ten Pin is decent enough but for my tastes falls short of greatness. I don't regret my purchase but won't be repeating it."
"Overall: Good. Really enjoy the dark chocolate and dark fruit notes and how they meld together. It reminds me of Ten Fidy's younger brother the only problem I had was it's not as smooth and creamy and the body is a bit thin"

"22oz bottle that I picked up for $6.99. Dark black with a small head, looks like an imperial stout. Aroma is sweet dark malts. Flavor was sweet, dark malts, I would have guessed it was an imperial stout. Overall, not bad, worth $7 but I wouldn't buy it again."
""
""
""
"Feel: Smooth, near medium body."
""
"Passable; not in the same class with RIS, but then since it’s an “imperial porter” one would expect it to be less flavorful and thinner, which it is. This is not bad, with the appearance of the head, lacing, and body raising the score while the weak flavor lowers it. Worth trying; I have another bottle which I’ll age and try again in a year or two."
""
""
""
"Overall: Hmm, the chocolate and coffee tones are a little synthetic and off putting. After such a solid wax job on the bottle I had high hopes, because we all know wax topping means it's going to be a good brew."

"I enjoyed this more as I went as it took some time to settle in, but once my palate warmed to it I found it enjoyable."

"Overall: Not much of an ""imperial porter", more like a strong, dark brown ale. Muddled tastes, disagreeable herbal hops finish. Middle-of-the-road at best. Warming and big, no doubt. Good for preparing for the upcoming snow here, but nothing I would buy again, especially at $8 a bomber."

"Low C+"

"Excellent from the start and well worth the premium I paid for it at a bar. A great beer and one of the smoothest and easiest high abv. dark beers I think I've had; certainly the best in some time anyway."
""
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Pretty decent head, and some persistent lacing. Nose is coffee, accentuated with sweet, and bitter components. Roasted coffee with butterscotch and a peaty finish. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"A big porter here that a got several months ago and was saving for a special occasion. Well today, I finally turned in the rough draft for my Master's degree paper and decided that today was such an occasion. Although a big porter as promised, Nefarious let me down in a couple of ways: first the presentation was merely slightly better than your average porter. Not a great starting point when this sucker cost around $7.00 for the bomber. The flavor profile is bold and filled with roasted chocolate malt and dark fruit as expected, however alcohol makes an unwanted appearance as the beer warms beyond 55 degrees or so and at times is borderline caustic as I finished my first pint glass. No qualms with the lighter than expected, creamy mouthfeel. Overall, I wouldn't buy another bomber of this simply because there are better imperial stouts and baltic porters to be had for the money. I would consider a pint of it if I found it on tap though...."

"Overall just a wonderful beer I wish I had more of! Thanks to Cameron (TheBishopco) for the try!"
"Sourcing: Purchased at Spec's in Texas in April 2013 for $6.99/22 oz bomber."
"Overall a very nice beer. Sweet, nutty and flavorful."
"medium body, silky smooth but a little thin for the abv. another very nice offering from ska brewery, much better than their steel toe and buster nut brown ales."

"O: Not bad at all. Maybe a wee bit too boozy, maybe a bit thin in the mouthfeel, but overall, I enjoyed my session drinking this while up late watching the Food Network."

"Overall, a good imperial porter to dissect and think about. The vanilla notes are really well done."
""
"This is a delicious, complex, rich, highly drinkable beer. I've been down on Ska lately, but I'm glad I came across this beer. It made me a believer again. This is definitely a beer worth looking into for anyone who likes stouts."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall something new to try, I definitely have never had a ""baltic"" porter prior to this. Worth looking at I'd say, and now that I have a taste of this variety, I look forward to trying others (ie Alaskan, Smuttynose). Not sure I'd revisit this one again though."
""
"I'll get this again."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is pretty solid, but the charcoal notes are a little much for me."
""
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass, unknown bottle date but this has been in the beer cooler for a while. This pours a mostly black color with light causing brown edges, with a short lived tan head which leaves a lacing. The smell is more sweet than I was expecting, the smells are of roasted malts and milk chocolate. The feel is medium. The taste is pretty good a little sweet and not as much roasted malts as I like low hop bite."
"Beer is medium bodied with lightly spritzy carbonation, helping this foam up slightly on the palate. Resultant mouthfeel is slightly tingly, but smooth and well-flowing. Noticeable ethanol burn on tongue, throat, and in nostrils, which takes away from the experience of the beer: I've had larger ethanol beers that exhibit less of its presence. Finishes dry, with a mild sustained lingering heat from ethanol."
""
""
""
""
"O- I love the different flavors and the way this beer comes together, I just wish it was more bold. Everything was delicious, but it was also subtle. I dont want my 8% porters to be this subtle- still a tasty delight though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I did like it but no way is this an imperial profile porter. I love Ska Brewing but this one left me hanging on an uneventful sip."
"Pours dark brown in color with a small khaki head. Not an overly impressive nose. Despite being watery, it displays an impressive amount of metal and an acrid roastiness. A little bit of chocolate and maybe a hint of coffee. The flavor is not quite as metallic, but the flavor is similarly lackluster. Some old chocolate and a little bit of coffee to go with the roasted malt and bitterness."
""
""
"Was easy going down, and doesn't leave to bitter of an after taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - An inferior offering, even to the original. I won't be having this again, especially when the original Ten Pin is better. Simple, unbalanced, and the ABV is entirely too present."
""
""
""
"Nefarious Ten Pin isn’t bad — just a little too sweet and a little too boozy."
"22 oz bomber pours opaque black, head and lacing a bit underwhelming. I smell roasted malt, tobacco, and alcohol. Taste doesn't seem quite in harmony - brown sugar, alcohol, and roasted malts, with very light coffee, chocolate, and citrus hops. Creamy mouthfeel, rather wet finish, and unpleasant aftertaste. I had high hopes for this one but overall it was a dissapointment."
"when i poured this i thought i was pouring a pepsi. has that cola colored body with a short whispy head that fizzes out. smell is below average for a porter, let alone an imperial one. i gotta try real hard to find anything in there, but sure enough there is some roasted aromas. taste is pretty weak as well for an imperial. mostly over roasted malts with some liquid smoke added. has a medium body with less than average carbonation and a dry smokey finish. will not buy again or recommend anybody else buys either."
""
""
"Overall - It is a decent and tasty brew, but I don't think it measures up against other ""Imperial Porters"". It was tasty, but I would not buy it again and would rather drink some Modus Hoperandi from this brewery."
""
""
""
"Overall: Porters tend to be hit or miss for me, baltic / imperial goes the right way. Rich body, heady alcohol, good flavor, no flaws, good stuff."
"O: This is one of those beers that taste better at cellar temperature rather than being served at its recommended serving temperature. It's a simple porter that doesn't feel Imperial in anyway, no real punch that puts it above the bar."
""
"O: The nose was exciting but the flavor was a bit of a letdown. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy but a bit lighter than normal. I'd like to see this one a bit stronger and fuller bodied."
"How did the nose become so offensive? Whatever it was, the nose prevented me from enjoying this beer. Don't think I'll pick this up again."
"O- As long as you wait for it to warm up, this is a tasty beer. I have to say though this is probably the beer that improved the most from warming up out of any I've had- cold it mediocre at best, and warm it was a charmer."

"pours dark and smooth, with one of the most absurd heads ive ever seen on a beer. looks like the froth on a good cappucino! 3 inches thick, mocha colored, and lasting the whole time. wow. full marks for appearance! nose is alcohol big time, smells like a belgian sour, tobacco notes in there as well. the flavor is less intense than the nose and quite delicious. hits of dried sour cherries and cigar smoke interchange, with a wine like alcohol dryness. mouthfeel is the perfect porter. drinkable but full bodied, nice carbonation but not in your face. my critique here is largely undefined. when looking at these categories, it scores perfectly well in all of them, but it just isnt my favorit imperial porter. there is something different about this one, really struggling to explain it. it might be that sourness is not what i am used to in this style. alcohol warmth is nice though, and it goes great with a big bowl of cheesy chilli con carne over egg noodles!"
"Overall: I have to be honest, it doesn't taste very much like a Baltic Porter. Its a bit more in the American Double category, but still an excellent beer. Really quality stuff here!"
"Overall: some interesting complexities can be found in this beer.. worth a try."
"O: I really love baltic porters, but I wasn't overly impressed by this beer. In fact, I was a bit disappointed with it. I'm glad to have tried it, but I wouldn't look for it again."
"Ska rolls a good one, but can't nail a strike with this Ten Pin."
"Pours brown with a decent head. Smells yeasty and of raisins, but it manages to come off as dry rather than sweet. Initially tastes very nice- just as you'd want a Baltic Porter to taste with fruit and a bit of roasty depth. Unfortunately the taste quickly falls off and becomes too light and loses any depth of flavor. In the mouth you get a sense of overcarbonation as well, which contributes a slightly wateriness to the beer. Could be better."
"overall - interesting, sweeter than expected, the low carb is killing this one."
"Bonus points for the bad-ass label."
"With a pretty decent body and a nice rich taste on this porter, it's definitely worth recommending it, only draw back is the price at about $7.00 for a bomber."
"Most black with very minimal head. Aroma of dark malt and bit of chocolate with slight citrus from hops. Flavor of dark roasted malt with slight hoppy bitterness. A lot of roasted malt flavor, but wish it was even a bit more pronounced. Overall a good porter would definitely have again."
"A good imperial porter. Perhaps a bit uncomplicated."
"OVERALL: Surprisingly enough, I actually quite liked this. It was flavorful, complex, and quite fun to pick appart. It is, however, hard to score a good beer that completely trashes the style. This was an imperial porter in name only, and can be more accurately described as a Belgian strong dark ale with some porter influences. Hence the average score in smell and taste. One I would drink again, but would definitely avoid if I was looking for a porter. Thanks again boatshoes. This was an interesting and fun brew to drink."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 2 inch khaki head that fades to an oily cap. Thin rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark fruits, dark roasted malt, and slight coffee. Taste is of dark fruits, dark roasted malt, coffee, and cocoa powder. This beer has low carbonation with a slightly flat and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good baltic porter that is a bit of a letdown in the mouthfeel. I am glad I picked one of these up though."
"This beer is highly drinkable at 8.00% Recommended!"
"GOOD, NOT AN ESSENTIAL TASTING!"
"Haven't had enough Baltic Porters to be a very good judge of the quality of this one to the style, but I enjoyed the hell out of it."
"Picked up a bomber of this one on a whim recently, as I hadn't had it in years and hadn't reviewed it. Poured a very dark brown (almost black) color with a nice light brown head. Aromas of dark chocolate, freshly roasted coffee and dark malts. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of roasted malt, coffee and dark chocolate."
"O: this beer is average for the style. I have no information about the bottle date of this bottle, but it seems to be dated a bit."
"Overall: Not really what I expected from this one as I was really thinking it was going to be a bit more of a formidable beer; still decent overall and worth picking up, but I can't say this is something that needs to be in a 22 oz. bottle with the thick wax job."
"Well, it appears my abuse did little to affect this beer, as it is excellent. The malt character is superb and it never gets cloying thanks to a nice balance from the hops. The alcohol is nowhere in sight. I could drink a lot of this before realizing how strong it is. Overall, a great example of the style. Recommended."
"O: A nice Baltic porter with a oaky/vanilla touch."
"D - Nice brew."
"A little pricey at nearly $10, didn't feel like a big ripoff, but at the price, isn't making me clamor for another bottle."
"This beer was fairly drinkable but lacked a few things. I enjoyed the coffee bitterness but it would have been better with some hops."
"This pours almost black with a beach sand two finger head that dies down leaving no lace. On the nose there are big hits of molasses, caramel, and cereal. It's exceptionally sweet, almost closer to an English barleywine but a few shades darker. The sweetness comprises more in the molasses than anything else, and I didn't get much cocoa or bittersweet chocolate as other reviewers did. In the mouth the molasses didn't hold as much as I thought it might, probably a good thing, and there is some roasted grain on the way to slightly balance the molasses that is always present. The mouthfeel is a bit less sticky than I anticipated. Actually I was shocked at how medium this is in body based on what came out in the nose. The finish is long with some roast bitterness balancing the lingering molasses and caramel. Overall I like this beer a good deal, though I was surprised at how tame the sweetness was in the mouth considering how pleasantly overpowering it was in the nose."
"I really have to say what sold this beer for me is the balance it has in all categories. As an Imperial it doesn't let you down in any one category for me. Its 8% is well hidden and balanced with the malt and hop profile. The perfect carbonation and thickness. This is a damn good Imperial only lacking a slightly higher abv than some other."
"Overall a nice beer. Rather sweet, but quite drinkable at the same time. There are certainly better beers for the style, but I enjoyed this one all the same."
"I got this courtesy of coloradobeerbuff in a recent bif. I poured from a bomber into a snifter, tar black pour with a thin little white head. The aroma has coffee, chocolate, and the slightest hint of alcohol. The flavor has more chocolate than coffee, along with dark fruit notes. It has a lingering coffee finish. The body is solidly medium, decent carbonation, the alcohol is hidden. I really enjoyed my first offering from Ska, a tasty porter."
"hard to pinpoint, but I get a bit unevenness in the taste and texture, maybe needs a few years of storing."
"We don't use the word nefarious enough. The beer that proves this pours a lightly ruby-tinted black-brown topped by a finger of dirty ecru foam. The nose comprises coffee, roasted malts, light chocolate, rye bread, and wheat. The expected darkness isn't quite there, but a decent amount of lighter grain is. Odd. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, dark chocolate, light spruce, caramel, and light oak. The body is a straight medium with a light moderate carbonation. Overall, a very nice Baltic porter, but I wouldn't necessarily put it near the top of my personal faves list for the style."
"This beer pours a dark brown with an ecru foam that doesn't last too long. The smell is a combination of coffee and smoke. The taste here is almost a spicy flavor with the slight coffee notes. The mouthfeel. The spice is more of a pepper note. The mouth feel kinda drags on the flavor as well, but isn't horrible overall. This is a fairly drinkable beer. Not my favorite Baltic Porter, but it isn't that bad overall and I wouldn't turn people away from this beer."
"Impression: If I could get this again, I would. I recommend it, it's sweet, drinkable, tasty."
"Bottle from Arizona trip, aged 10 months. Pours black with little head. About average mouthfeel. Mild in relation to other baltics I've had, still very enjoyable and drinkable, with good roasting, chocolate, and slight oiliness.Sweet chocolate in aroma."
"This beer is smooth and somewhat creamy on the tongue, with just a hint of alcohol warmth at the end. Pleasant and quite drinkable."
"OVERALL: A couple of disclosures may be necessary here. For starters, Ska is currently at the top of my list as my favorite brewery, so I may be a bit biased, but there is a reason they are my favorite - they keeping making beer like this. Second, I was pretty happy when I had this, my girlfriend had just finished making a fantastic steak dinner for us and it went perfectly with the steak. That said, although I have had the Ten Pin before and enjoyed it, this was the first time I had a chance to really pay attention to it and I was rewarded greatly for that. This might be the best porter I have had and it has awakened my interest in the style. I am now on the hunt for something to match it. Any suggestions would be great, send me some beer mail!"
"D - too bitter for more than one."
"Poured a dark brown, almost to the point of being black with a finger sized tan head. Lacing chased the dark goodness clear to the bottom of the glass. Aromas of malt, burnt bitter-sweet chocolate, and coffee. This medium body brew found chocolate malts, burnt molasses, and dark fruit on the palate, with good carbonation and a nice alcohol warmth on the finish. Will see this one alot this winter. Two thumbs up!"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light to moderate level of carbonation. The fizzing sound made when this bottle was opened led me to believe this was going to be highly carbonated but that was not the case. It is fairly drinkable but lacks the complexity that I look for in a baltic/imperial porter. I have no idea how old this brew is, but it undoubtedly could have been sat on for quite some time."
"Overall, a decent beer. One that is drinkable, and definitely prides itself on presentation (cool bottling and label). Outside of the fancy packaging, the beer holds up as a good, if not slightly out of the box, porter."
"D: Good drinking, but not great tasting."
"Pours a very dark brown with a thin head and a bit of lacing that is actually quite sticky. Nose brings smoke, chocolate, char, and a bit of roast. Taste is similar with a good amount of smoke, nice roast, and some dark fruits. Pretty good body and nice carbonation. Drinks quite well overall and is another hit from the brewers in Durango."
"Jet black with a creamy latte colored head that quickly dies. Lace is good, but head retention isn't. Toasted bread aroma with a bit of caramel. Carbonation is on the soft side once it has warmed up. About the right amount for the style. Alcohol shows up in the middle. Liquorish finish with a burnt coffee post finish. Medium heavy mouthfeel."
"Bottle. Picked this one up at Binny's while I was in Chicago. Pours a deep brown like cola with a very slight light tan head. Sweet light coffee like aromas in the nose with maybe a touch of vanilla. Sweet toffee like flavor followed by a light roast like coffee flavor. A little sweet. Kind of surprised this is an Imperial by the mouthfeel, way too light in my opinion. Medium mouthfeel. A very blah beer. Nothing really all that great in my opinion."
"This is a style I havent had often and I think there should be more of it."
"Drinkability -- I wouldn't put it in my list of favorites for the style, but a person could could do worse than this porter. Alcohol is well-hidden and there are some big roast flavors, but the tart and bitter flavors become fatiguing at a point and leave the flavor profile a little flat."
"D: I prefer the regular Ten Pin to this. I'm going to compare this to the Alaskan Baltic Porter I had yesterday and this is nowhere near as good. It's not a bad beer, just gets boring, and doesn't have the power that I imagine when I see an ""Imperial"" labeled beer. Fairly good in the end as an American Porter, but as a Baltic or Imperial Porter it's lacking."
"Overall this is a really excellent Baltic Porter. I would drink this again for sure. It tasts big, but honestly it doesnt taste as big as 8%- it is extremely smooth and easy drinking, this may be in part to the fact it is at least a year old."
"Typical run of the mill porter. A strong darker color, same ol smooth feel. Nothing too special here, but if you get a chance, check it out. The best thing I can say about this beer is the brown hued color and nice bottling. You can taste the hard work put into this beer."
"Roasty and nutty flavors really stand out in the flavor with a decent amount of coffee bean. Sweetness is low, which is surprising after the nose. Chocolate flavors abound as it warms. Has a grassy bitterness on the finish that helps with the depth. Not a whole lot of complexity, but the flavor profile is really to my liking and the beer is nefariously drinkable! Paired excellently with some bitter, 65% chocolate."
" d- An ok porter. Easy to drink but the metallic taste is offputting. Would give another shot."
"I have sampled this beer a few times in the past,today with a whole bottle I felt it right to review.Poured into an imperial pint glass a deep dar brown with ruby highlights thru the whole glass,a tight one finger lighter mocha colored head atop.A great mix od deep cocoa and dark fruit in the nose,a bit of earth shows thru as well,the cocoa really stands out well.This is a big American porter with its big earthy and roasty tones,the chocolate flavors are of the dark bitter variety,the dark fruit flavors keep just enough sweetness to hold up to the brash roasty flavors.I really like this Baltic porter(one of my favorite styles),its brash and I want more."
"Body seems to be a bit light, carbonation is adequate. A pretty nice drinker here."
"D-this is a delicious baltic porter, big flavors and aromas. The nose would be better but there is one aroma that is slightly phenolic and the taste is great but it is a little sweet to go any higher."
"Overall, too light and boring."
"D - good drinkability."
"M/D - Medium bodied and super creamy. Very easy drinking. Not sure how much of an ""Imperial"" porter it is, but it is a tasty beer."
"I'm not an expert on Porters, but Ten Pin is a good representative of the style IMHO."
"D - This is a very nice Baltic Porter, one of the really good brews from Ska."
"This one seems caught between wanting to be a bold over-the-top beer, and one that is borderline session-drinkable. Obviously at 8% its not going to be, but a lot of the flavors end up subtly mixing on the tongue, and this one ends up being easily digestible. Another fine offering from Ska."
"This was the second time I tried this beer and it was smokier this time than it was last time. Not sure which version I liked better, but they were definitely different although both were good."
"The drinkability is unquestionably high. Though certain areas lack slightly from what I could expect, Ska does deliver a massively enjoyable brew. Alcohol is masked very well and tends to drink much faster than anticipated."
"Interesting. Not quite sure if it's an error or on purpose. Poured with a nice fluffy, frothy, foamy, tan head and lots of lace. Color isan opaque dark brown almost black. Aroma is earthy, funky, tangy, rich, nasty, good, yet bad. Flavs the same. Baltic Porter? maybe. Shat's good. let's not get too hinky. good solid finish good bye."
"As a side note this beer was bought in a little liquor store out of season, so it might have had a little aging."
"D- It's an above average porter, nothing stands out, it's just a descent all around flavor. I like a porter or stout to somewhat kick me in the stomach as it hits my palate. I paid 6.99 for a bomber, for that price I would expect more, the same company makes a Merlot Stout at the same price that's amazing. I will not be picking up another one of these."
"Drink ability was pretty good. For an 8% beer it was rather light and the alcohol wasnt very present. Had the regular ten pin porter about a week ago and this is a much improved version of it, at 6 bucks a bomber very much worth the price"
"It's a good beer that's worth picking up if you see it around."
"Overall this was a solid beer but I thought it was too much on the sweet side with not enough complexity. Worth a shot, though I wouldn't go out of my way."
"D=drinkable as any beer at 8% is, taste, aroma worth it, overall a good beer."
"D: I was expecting this beer to be an amped up version of Ska's Ten Pin. It's not. The flavor profile sports a stronger bitterness than Ten Pin, so the sweetness doesn't dominate as much. That's not a bad thing. The only real detracting factor for me was the high level of carbonation. Overall, a nice beer."
"Overall, it's not shabby, but I definitely prefer other baltic porters to this one. Still... don't pass it up. Give it a try!"
"drinkability - @8% there are many porters i would rather drink - doubt i ever buy this again"
"Overall, A very good Imperial Porter than I would definitely drink again. Not blown away, but I think that's hard to accomplish with a Porter."
"Pours a very dark brown, maybe with some dark ruby highlights. It looks nearly black, in the glass, with a thin head, maybe 1 cm, that falls down kind of quicly to just a little ring, where it leaves inly the tiniest bit of lacing. The smell is filled predominantly with 2 things, dark chocolate and coffe - with the chocolate winning out. Deep in there, there's a bit of earthiness, maybe some burnt bready and leafy smells, and a bit of caramel. Smells interesting, but isn't exactly powerful enough to get me too exited - I think it's because of the size of the head. The tastes comes out like some weak coffee, with a bit of thick and bitter chocolate syrup poured in. The burnt, roasted bitterness almost becomes too, much, but definitely is a good flavor for an imperial porter. There is enough sweetness, but not too much, and not much in terms of fermentation off-flavors. I becomes cola-like at times, nice toasted bread. I'd say that this is good. The body is nice, about medium full, maybe a little better, just a little rush of carbonation, no real bite to it, but there's just a little bit of one. The bitter roasted malt flavor slows me down a bit. The alcohol doesn't seem to powerful, but you can definitely feel it. I'd say that this is a little better than average."
"D. Better as it warms. Pretty easy drinking for higher ABV. Overall not too bad."
"The texture and flavor profile is good for a profile, but fall a bit short for an imperial; also, the flavor is screaming for some milk stout sweetness in the malt profile to balance it. This could've been a bigger beer than it is, but it's decent and has character."
"Out of a bomber bottle this beer was a nearly opaque, blackish-brown color. The two-fingers of khaki/tan head displayed good retention as a thin layer of foam that left very good lacing throughout the sample. The aroma was of rich chocolate, toffee, alcohol, roasted malt and hints of nuts. The flavors were of roasted malt, blackened malt, bittersweet chocolate, hints of tobacco. It tasted drier than the aroma suggested and as it warmed up the alcohol became more present in both the aroma and flavor. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation very good for the style."
"Pours thick dark black with a smallish tan head. Nice lacing on the surface. Aroma is roasted malt with a big chocolate note. Taste is big roasted malt. Again a big chocolate note. Significant sweetness provides some balance to the roasted bitterness. Generously hopped. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Pretty drinkable. Big all around and not subtle but quite nice overall."
"A 22 ounce wax dipped bomber bottle shared with brothercannon and poured into a set of shaker glasses. The porter appears a hazy deep chestnut color with about an inch of fluffy ecru foam. The head settles down to a thin layer within a few minutes. The nose and flavor consist of medium roasted grains, bittersweet chocolate, a touch of cherry skins, figs, slightly smokey-sweet malt, a hint of mocha. About medium bodied and adequately carbonated for a baltic porter."
"-Other Notes: This bottle was free after the World Beer Festival came through Raleigh NC. I am not sure how old the bottle is which possibly affected the taste. This is also my first review so I don't want to over-analyze the beer. Overall, the beer is pretty decent other than the slight burnt characteristic and not enough sweet to balance it out....I'd have another!"
"This is a pretty tasty, super roasty porter, to the point of tasting slightly charred, in fact. Still, it's a cold spring night and this hit the spot. Worth a try."
"D - Overall, the alcohol seems a bit too strong in flavor where it should be better disguised. Maybe worth picking up if you're curious, but otherwise I'm sure there are better ""imperial"" porters out there."
"D: Meh, it's okay. One bomber is enough, not a whole lot of flavor for a baltic porter. Mouth is just way too thin. I've drank regular porters that have more substance than this. I don't think I'll seek this out again."
"Kudos to SKA brewing for hooking me up with this fresh bottle after I wrote to them about a possibly infected bottle that I had opened. Great customer service!"
"Great for an after dinner treat. Very nice! Recommended..."
"I don't regret the purchase at all, it was enjoyable and interesting throughout. If you haven't tried it before, give it a whirl."
"Nice beer. Poured quite dark with about a 1/2 inch of tan head. Smell was plum, prune, and raisin. It was wonderfully smooth in the mouth and remained that way all the way down, an easy drink. Little hop character to speak of but strong with roasted malt and dark fruit. The prune taste stays long after the brew is gone. I must be getting old because I find that taste strangely enjoyable. I will be buying more."
"The aroma is good for the style with coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. The appearance is dark brown with a light tan head. The flavor is like the aroma but has a bit of vegetables. The palate is thin for the style and the finish is bitter. Overall not a great strong porter."
"Drinkability is great it is a well balanced Baltic. Quite easy to drink when I come to think about it almost a Quaffable brew for us hearty New Englanders. This is one of my top ten of the style"
"One of the better beers I've had from these guys. Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head. The nose has sweet malts and dark fruits with a subtle hop presence. Taste is also on the sweet side but well balanced by the bitter hops. Medium body drinks well."
"Drinkability? At 8%abv, I'm surprised at how well it is hidden. Just a mild warming well after the swallow. Nothing to detract from how good this tastes. I think SKA did one hell of a good job here. Mighty fine sipper!"
"HV"
"this is my favorite beer i've ever had. it provides amazing drinkabaility, head, taste, and aroma. It is a one beer, beer. once you've drank it your set for the night/day. It's %age is high (8%), but hides well. this beer is a beer you can be proud to drink and share. even though they're completely different brews, it competes well with the deschutes abyss. this beer is smooth and extremely well done by a GREAT brewery. A must try if you can find it. well worth the price"
"Beer poured black with red undertones. Tan head is holding strong and leaving lacing behind. Nose is of roasted malts and hints of chocolate. Taste is chocolate roasted malts blending nicely into a prominent dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very creamy. Overall drinkability is good. There was a slight alcohol bite on the first sip only. Definitely try this if you are into roasted hoppy beers!"
"Drinkability is good. This is a tasty baltic porter. I expected a bigger bold beer, especially with the higher abv. Now while the flavors are there, the high abv actually went down pretty easy. Pretty solid beer, worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is very nice, a good smoothness and thin carbonation make a creamy beer. The down side is a slightly salty and chalky fresh milled grain finish. That aftertaste is slightly disappointing and distract from the big malt flavors and the medium bitterness. Still I would buy this one again, it's a good big beer."
"The flavor is not as full, nor roasty (keep in mind it is still a porter), as one might expect given the dark color of the body, yet it's richly caramelish, nutty, and cocoaish. There are hop flavors present, seemingly a bit citrusy upfront (although that could be coming from fruity yeastiness), and then more herbal and grassy in the finish. It's well-balanced by a bitterness that stands back at the start, and then jumps in sharply towards the swallow, cutting through the malt and bringing it to a brash, dry finish. Grassy hops and some dark malt acidity linger, compelling you to take another sip or linger with a bit of chalkiness. It's remarkably drinkable in that way. The alcohol never shows, and overall, it's a pretty well-balanced and drinkable beer."
"I hate the wax-top bottle, but won't hold it against the beer. Clear brown-black pour with a short off-white head. Strong roasted malt and cocoa aroma. Blend of the same with a strong hop profile. Somewhat out of balance, but got better as it warmed. Never found the bing cherry, but the coffee, smoke, and cream flavors were nicely woven into the beer. Smooth, wtih a bitter finish."
"Drinkability: While not as catchy or charming as some, it's still a mediocre to downright decent imperialized porter from SKA Brewing."
"Not quite the right style I think, but this is a tasty and massive American porter. Look out for this one if you like them dark and wicked."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, nice representation of style, not quite the nest ""Imperial"" Porter that I've had but it's still a decent beer to drink for a while."
"The coffee, roasted malt, chocolate flavors show up immediately, sweet up front with a nice bitter finish, like coffee. the 8% abv is well masked, you get little hints of booze as you drink, this beer is smooth. Its not as full bodied as I would like a porter to be, but its a nice change. I could drink more than a couple of these and not feel as if I ate a four course meal."
"D- very easy to drink. not that overly strong that having a second one in a sitting would be that huge of a problem. ill try this one again sometime soon."
"Foamy active bubbles create two fingers of carmel colored head. Fades fast leaving only dots of lace. Body is absolute jet black. Nose is full of spunky carmalized sweet malt and smokey chocolate. Smokey spicy tingling richness enters the mouth and then thins out a bit. A woodsy almost nutty sweetness develops on the back of the tongue. A dark bitterness is there on the mouthfeel that shows signs of a hop profile. Stays pretty thick on the back of the mouth also. Solid drinkability."
"Into pint glass, pours a dark brown bordering on russet, good tan starter head, decent retention, nice lacing. The aroma reveals a good dose of lactose, which will distract me. Dark roasty malts, some chocolates. Taste has more lactose, some powdered chocolate, which gets it dry and chalky, some good bitter roasted malt. The mouth is pretty thin for a big porter, but its easy enough to drink. In all, pretty stock, but decent enough."
"Taste followed the smell but with a very dry, bitter finish. Very mild notes of chocolate and raisins. Very carbonated and a slightly watery mouthfeel."
"D: absolutely amazing. highly recommended. great dessert beer."
"This drinks WAY too easy and nice for 8%"
"All in all, if it wasn't a bit boozy, this would be a very good end of the day porter."
"Overall, disappointing. I recently brewed a baltic porter and actually prefer it. The reason I picked this up originally was to get a benchmark for my homebrew but I didn't get around to trying it until now. Maybe that was a good thing!"
"M/D: Carbonation is a little high but body remains a little creamy, full bodied, bit of chalky feeling in the finish. Decent drinkability. A decent beer that could use some bolstering."
"Overall, this is pretty good, but I would probably recommend it served a bit warmer than most beers, even in this style. It doesn't send me into the trance-like state of, say, Yeti or Duck-Rabbit's rendition of the style, but it is still worth a tasting or two."
"Pours a very inky black in color with a ring of head around the perimeter of the glass. Smell is very roasted, dark chocolates. Maybe some coffee and black malt. Taste is more of the burnt dark chocolate. Pretty bitter and strong. Easy drinking, but not overly complex."
"Medium body; mouthfeel is substantial and chewy, but with a nice clean finish. Too sweet to drink very many, but it might be fun to sop this one up with some nice homemade buttered biscuits."
"pours a nice dark brown 1 inch head, over a very dark rudy liquid. smells roasty and malty. very nice. Good lacing after second pour. looks very inviting. Chocolate hits first, then a nice roasted malt flavor. smooth mouth feel wonderful stuff. good!"
"Pours absolute black with a rocky tan head and gorgeous lacing. Truly, I can't imagine it getting better. The smell is raspberries, coffee, and leather. My mouth waters just remembering it. Drinking it gives a hint of sweetness, then mellows quickly towards a dry, crisp aftertaste. It's silky, with nice bubbles to balance it out. The drinkability is great, with the balanced features making this one I could attempt as a session beer. As long as I'm not driving."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Poured out deep dark brown with a nice head that quickly disappears. The aroma is of slight roasted malt and deep chocolate. Taste was of slight roasted malt and wham chocolate, lots of it. Very smooth both on taste and finsih. Like a hershey bar. GREAT!"
"Drinkability is pretty good, but I'm forced to think of this one as a milk stout, not a Baltic porter (who complexities I'd be savoring a bit slower). I like the taste, although it's a bit heavy on the lactose, and the ABV is dangerously well hidden, it's just not what I was looking for in a Baltic porter."
"D: Easy to drink, well-balanced porter...nothing too complex here. Alcohol level is fully concealed - this 8% drinks like a 4-5%...dangerous drinkability! Glad to have tried this; I'll look for more from Ska."
"Nice creamy brew, bubbles are small but pleasant on tongue. Good finish. This beer needs a good steak to really bring out its usefulness. It does pair well with a nice stinky bleu cheese."
"Pours very dark brown, only letting light through at the very edges. Very think tan head - looks sort of like a root beer float. Aroma is of malt and cocoa, with some dark fruits emerging as it warms. Taste is roasted malt, slightly bitter expresso. This has a thick, creamy mouth feel. Very enjoyable drink."
"A good beer, but I've had better baltic porters and for the money you could probably do better."
"Pours an almost impenetrable brown that a minimal amount of light gets through. The head is enormous. Nose is actually very interesting. Seems like it has a roasted coffee bean aroma to it. The flavor is actually pretty good too. When the first second or two of flavor wears off, what stays with you is a rich and full flavor that has hints of coffee. Overall this is the best brew I have had yet of Skas. I had low expectations, but I was surprised. This one is actually worth trying - especially after you let it warm up a bit. By that point, it becomes quite a bit more."
"Drinkability- Decent, maybe even above decent baltic, but plenty of other ones out there to float my boat."
"Overall a tasty and brawny porter."
"Actually, slightly thin although the finish is creamy, thereby rounding out the mouthfeel a bit. Overall a very enjoyable beer but not as rich and sweet as I am used to from the style. Still, I'd absolutely revisit this one."
"D: It is a servicable beer and goes down quite easily but it leaves me wanting more."
"I bought this bottle at Liquor Mart in Boulder when visiting CO to attend the Great American Beer Fest. I brought it back to Milwaukee in my wooden leg and split this bottle with Surly Sober."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, imo. Slightly bitter aftertaste with a touch of dryness. This bomber is going down pretty good, and I am sure the next one I buy will too. I am hoping the mouthfeel will improve with a fresher bottle."
"This beer poured a black color with a thin tan head. The aroma is malty and mild. The taste is malty and has a coffee flavor  very well balanced. The mouthfeel is full and somewhat creamy. Overall, this is an easy drinking porter that Ill keep an eye out for."
"8% ? No freekin' way...at least I can't find it. Incredibly hidden if it is in there."
" Overall this really impressed me and kicked my ass to be honest. I was not expecting this to be that heavy. It really has the smell, look, and feel of a stout. An Imperial porter it is I guess, but damn it is full bodied. This is a very nice brew and definatly worth a try, it was very affordable at around $6 dollars, so you really cannot go wrong. Ska keeps putting out these quality brews over and over, well done again!"
"a little disappointing, I was expecting to do a standing ovation for this one."
"Poured into a chalice a clear/clean dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little tannish fizzy head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is sweet, malty, lots of toffee/caramel. The taste pretty much follows the nose, malty and lots of toffee/caramel. The alcohol is hidden very well for a 8% brew. Medium body. Drinkable, this is my first Ska brew, but I do have a bottle of Decadent to be had shortly. This brew, I would recommend if you can find it."
"The 8% is hidden from my palate, but i can feel it on the way down."
"Drinkability - this is good ale, but not great. High abv also holds down sessionability."
"Pured into a mug, the beer left a thin darkish head that dimimished into a razor thin head that lasted several minutes before breaking down into a ring. Aroma was rather weak for a beer this strong. Hints of dark chocolate and dried fruit. The taste has rather good with dark mocha characteristics minus the roasted barley flavor of a stout. Mouthfeel does a good job concealing the 8% abv. This is a very drinkable beer, but I'll likely usually pass it up for a similarly priced Imperial Stout."
"Drinkability: Just too many flaws here to be a top flight candidate for the style; definitely doesn't fit the Baltic Porter category and a bit underwhelming as an Imperial Porter"
"Drinks very easy for the ABV. This doesn't really say baltic porter, but pretty tasty. A good purchase at $4 for 22 ozs"
"Drinkable: Sippable, very flavorful but balanced and not overwhelming."
"Slainte!"
"Note: The draft was much better than the bottles I bought home. The bottle did not do this beer justice. I'm not sure why, but that is what I found."
"Another thanks to Bruskiator for sharing this beer with us at the Carolnia Brewmasts Christmas party Saturday.One of the last beers I treid that night so i may need to go back and re-review it sometime. 22 oz bottle pours a reddish black color with nice lacing and a fair amount of head. Smells of chocolate and coffee, with the addition of nuts and vanilla flavor. Great style, next time I'd like to try a whole bottle for myself."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is just shy of medim bodied and lightly carbonated. I would prefer this beers body to be a bit bigger. This was a dam fine beer and I could session this one inspite of the 8% ABV. It is a dam shame this beer isnt available in Cincinnati."
"Seems to be one of SKAs better brews, I could quaff these for a session  the 8% is well hidden behind that smooth chocolaty taste. In fact, this would really hit the spot with another couple percents of alcohol backbone"
" This was something I would call well balanced and very drinkable."
"Can't say that I love this one but it's an honest effort at a Baltic and certainly has its merits."
"Mouthfeel is average but seems a bit weak for an 8%. Alcohol is very well hidden as I taste little. Nice drinkability if you like sort of bitter chocolate and burnt coffee. Not exactly my favorite but I would try it again in the future."
"A good choice. Let it warm for a few and it'll be just right."
"This is a real nice ""big"" porter...all kinds of tasty, rich, complex dark malts. I should pick up another for $4."
"Really good mouthfeel in my opinion. Nearly full bodied, creamy and slick on the tongue. Sticks everywhere and the flavor really lingers and never quits. Good drinkability with its dark robust flavor and creamy mouthfeel. Good stuff, glad I picked it up while out in Colorado."
"Overall, a decsent example of baltic porter. Not sure if I will try this again."
"Pours out black with a tall dark tan head and leaves some light webbing of lace around the glass. Aroma is full of bitter sweet chocolate and roasted malts. The flavor starts sweet with some caramel before the lightly bitter dark chocolate. Plenty of roasty malts in here with a light underlying smokiness. Pretty nice overall flavor that was a bit milder than I would have liked. Smooth feel with just enough girth to the body. Easy enough drinking that I would have another after the first. Solid example of a big porter."
"This is a beer that I would recommend to any Porter lover. I am still undecided if I will be purchasing more in the future but this beer is one that might grow on you."
"Nefarious Ten Pin Imperial Porter is much better than Ten Pin Porter! (why no exclamation point with this beer, I wonder?). I'm not sure how much of a classic Baltic Porter it is, but it's a delicious, drinkable version that 'snow plows' its way to a strike! with each mouthful. Recommended if you can find it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head fades pretty quick down to an uneven layer of bubbles, with plenty of lacing. Aroma is smoky yet sweet dark malts. Taste is sweet chocolate, a twinge of smoke, and not much in the way of EtOH. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both pretty good. Could be a bit smoother, which would make it go down easier, ubt a nice brew overall."
"I would have merely thought this a good, borderline very good, regular porter were the word ""imperial"" not so present on the bottle. As is, it's a good beer, but it loses points for not being potent enough to rank as a good example of either an imeperial or Batlic porter. Still, well worth a try."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: For the one main flavor this has, its very good; wishing there was a lot more balance and other flavors to pick out. Again, its almost chocolate milk. Tastes good for what it is; just wishing it was more."
"Mouthfeel- Left a wet feeling on the palate with the blance of flavors. Had good staying power to savor and analyze and enjoy the flavors."
"A nice offering from SKA, but something that I would prefer in smaller servings. A bomber is too much for me as far as the sweetness goes. I like my porters to have more bite to them. Still, this is good."
"Overall a definite try."
"Ska is on my list of places to visit...call it my 5 year plan."
"A fine example of a wonderful style. Good nightcapper."
"I think this might be the best in this style in my state. Super dark and rich. The nose tells all about the coffee and dark chocolate. I also get small hints of toffee as well. The taste is great. Smooth and not over powered by alcohol. The coffee wrap up stays on the end of your tongue after the dark porter finish. Im not a big fan of the six packs from Ska but there bombers are a must try. If your any kind of fan of the style, give this a try."
"Pours a clear dark brown color with absolutely no head whatsoever. The smell is very nice and complex. Coffee, roasted grain, and a brown sugary sweetness make themselves known. I smell no alcohol. The taste is a bit of a letdown. The roasted flavors don't really come through much and the coffee is very muted along with some cocoa. That leaves a too sweet brown sugar/molasses taste that dominates. There is some pleasant hop bitterness which interacts with roasted malt bitterness in the finish though. This is not robust enough for my tastes. I also feel that the mouthfeel was quite thin. Drinkability was good. There's certainly nothing offensive about it."
"Thanks MJR."
"Mouthfeel is overcarbonated, sweet and lactic."
"The body is very thin and flat. This is fairly low of the drinkability scale in so many ways. Nice try Ska, but this is no imperial porter."
"22 oz. bottle from Whole Foods, sat in the cellar a couple months before drinking"
"This beer brings to mind something that's been bugging me, namely the ""Baltic Porter"" category. Clearly this is just a weak Baltic porter, but other stuff, like Flying Dog's Gonzo or Three Floyd's Alpha Klaus, really belong in a different category due to their dearth of fruitiness and heavy-handed use of hops."
"Flavor starts off with some dark fruit, raisin or plums, and then rolls to a lingering chocolate sweetness like a Hershey kiss that is overtaken by some warming alcohol. THe alcohol leaves a bit of a tingle on the back of my throat and keeps me from downing this tasty beer faster. A very tasty robust beer that is a sipper. Glad to have a full 22 oz of this tasty brew!"
"Drinkability is good not a bad porter not as full as I expected hell its worth a try maybe even a revisit. Taste was a toss up 3.5 or 4.0 couldn't make my mind up."
"For a bomber offering, this is a disappointingly weak beer. Not recommended."
"The body is light to medium and very smooth and easy to drink. I would have like to see more but still an enjoyable beer all the same."
"I enjoy this brew very very much... the only thing holding its drinkability down is that the alcohol is a bit too prevalent in the taste for me to handle alot of it. Nevertheless... high quality brew. The first I've had from this brewery... definitely won't be the last."
"22 oz bottle pours a reddish black color with a small creamy brown head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Chocolate and coffee aromas, flavors of milk chocolate, coffee, nuts and vanilla. Medium to full bodied with a soft and creamy mouthfeel, finishes on the sweet side, very drinkable."
"Beer is good. Happy sorta porta beering."
"Deep brown to black in color with a decent tan colored head. The head leaves a complex lace on the side of the glass as I drink the beer. The aroma is very subtle. Hints of milk chocolate and roasted malt, a bit of mild citrus on the finish. More chocolate in the taste, followed by a hint of espresso, and a light bitterness on the finish. The mouth feel is smooth, and it has a nice drinakbility. Decent beer, much better than their IPA."
"DARK- see thru corners with blood red highlights. cappuccino foam floats and an magical portal-like haze exists on the surface. dive in! nose of mocha chocolate grain silo is both appealing and average in porter terms.. nice butterscotch note keeps it interesting. clean with nothing astringent. light body with chalky baking cocoa bitterness, hop shock and alcohol burn in the finish. husk aftertaste with dirt mixed in.. earthiness isn't all bad but this could be alot smoother to compliment its thinner side body. decent but not the best of the ska line.. eh."
"A good porter, but I think ""imperial"" is stretching it. Perkuno's Hammer is still my benchmark for this style."
"22 ounce bottle. Might have gotten this one from mentor, many thanks!"
"D- This is my first brew from Ska and I'm very impressed. This beer has lots of complexity and its all about the dark flavors. The hops are just for support and the alcohol is also. Good complexity and great flavor with a exceptional aroma."
"-UF"
"Overall a great stout. Good aroma of chocalate and coffee. Taste, well like an imperial stout should, creamy, coffee, and not too hot on the alchohol. I didn't notice the thin mouthfeel as others have, but it seemed just right. No notice of the ABV in this beer. A beer that I will keep an eye out for in the future!!"
"Opinion: This is an OK beer. I wish there was a bit more carbonation to make it a bit easier on the palate. The alcohol is probably the saving grace with this beer so that it doesn't come across as syrupy. It's definitely worth a try...besides, the wax covered bottle is pretty novel."
"Thanks to Absolutesites for the bottle."
"Drinkability: I could drink this kind of beer for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Paired famously with my wife's German Chocolate Cake. Strongly recommended."
"This beers gets much better as it warms. Molasses, raisins (?...or perhaps some other dark fruit) and a touch of vanilla. I can't decide if there is a cherry sour or not (this would indicate use of Black Patent), but because a bitter jumps in after the initial sweetness. The hops are more apparent and now have some webby qualities I'd attribute to Fuggles and some citrus I'd attribute to a c-hop (sometimes Goldings does this for me, too). The chocolate has taken on an even more refined wet sweet quality. Really nice. The hops and roast has risen enough to contrast with the chocolate nicely and I'm left with a dry hoppy roast finish on my tongue. An alcohol burn pierces sharly forward late in the swallow, but isn't so strong to detract, and it fades nicely. Wow, all the experiences in this beer are well-balanced and play off each other in interesting ways."
"The beer after its disinterment from the 22-ounce capped and waxed bottle pours a pitch-black with some ruby high lights, the head is moderate in size and frothy in texture with the color a nice tan, after the heads demise the resultant lace forms a glutinous sheet upon the glass. Nose is toasted grain dominated with hints of black cherries and caramel, fresh and delightful to the olfactory senses, start is sweet and heavy with malt, top is middling to full in its feel to the palate. Finish is demonstrative in its acidity and the hops delectable in their spiciness with the aftertaste desert dry, the 8 percent ABV leaves a nice warming sensation it the tummy, this beer much better than their Ten Pin."
"This beer has a lot of similarities to the Decadent Imperial IPA, at least brewing approach wise, but in this beer it just works. There is no over the top use of ingredients, but the soft melding of the various malt components really works in this brew. Definitely the best beer I have had from Ska, and certainly one I would be willing, nay happy to have again."
"Taste fruit bombs that drop right into smokey baker's chocolate. Sour tingle, and faint wheat grass juice reminds me of bright clover honey. It's beautiful the way the flavors swirl up an alcohol vapor in the mouth, and combine aroma and flavor into one large bite of raspberry/bing cherry ganache."
"This is a very good porter, but is a bit too rich for everyday drinking. I dunno where an Imperial Porter ends and a Stout begins, but either way, this is good stuff. Easy to drink and full of flavor. The degree of chalk might put some off, but I'm okay with it. It has some interesting nuances...enough to keep me interested throughout the 22oz bomber."
"Drinkability: Light body adds to the drinkability. A heavier beer would be harder to have more than one glass, but this presented no problem whatsoever."
"but, alas, I can only thank Mr. Colorado BeerMan for this one! Cheers, mate!"
"This is a big beer and exactly what I was hoping for. Caramel base with tons of different chocolate (dry, dark and milk). Some maple and cashews as well. Magestic. The hop profile is descent. It's oily and floral and does balanced this very well."
"The Nefarious Ten Pin Imperial Porter was packaged in a 22 oz that was sealed with wax. It poured a dark black with a creamy brown head that went to a thin layer and left some lacing. The aroma is of sweetish chocolate malts with a touch of coffee and vanilla. The taste is roasted chocolate malts (somewhat sweetened with vanilla) up front with a late bitter, slightly alcoholic, finish. It had a creamy, full mouthfeel. A nice smooth drinking porter. It's similar to the regular Ten Pin from what I remember. I think I like this slightly better."
