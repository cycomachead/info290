My aggro pour raised a finger of dense, deep-tan head with reasonable retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown allowing only a modicum of light to penetrate except around the edges, revealing cola highlights. Nose was rich with notes of dark chocolate, anise, and toffee. Mouthfeel was full and creamy with a very chocolaty/licorice taste on the tongue. Finish was semi-dry and the rye gave it a spicy kick. The lacing that it left behind really covered the glass. While it was not really my choice of style, it was stylistically quite good.","woodychandler","Mar 08, 2013"

Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, cocoa, toast, dark bread, light coffee, clove, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; a bit muted though. Taste of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, raisin, cocoa, toast, dark bread, light coffee, clove, and floral earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toast, raisin, dark bread, light coffee, clove, and floral earthiness on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance and robustness of flavors, with good complexity; great balance of malt and yeast esters; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good baltic porter style. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 06, 2013"

Its got a bigger body than most crisp baltic porters, its a bit more substantial, big enough roasted malt to know its a porter and the sweetness is subtle enough for me.

I can't identify any off-flavors that would explain that, but my best guess is that I'm expecting a stout -- which is not necessarily a good reason. The Baltic Porter is a great example of the differences between a porter and a stout: the Baltic Porter lacks the coffee-like astringency that I expect from stouts, but it still has a lot of flavor and feels like a big beer. That said, I suspect I also don't session Baltic Porter because it is a ""bigger"" beer and has the associated ABV.","MurphyMacManus","Apr 29, 2009"

Pours a dark brown with a small brown head that does not retain well, unlike several others of its class. Smells roasty and (like the back of the bottle says) a bit like black licorice, but is remarkably understated to the point of being uninteresting. The taste, however, will knock your socks off. Full-bodied, well-rounded, extremely complex and layered flavors that make you marvel at every sip. This is extremely tasty. Black licorice? Check. Dark chocolate? Check. Roastiness? Smoke? Expresso? Check, Check, Check! This beer spans the entire Baltic Porter flavor spectrum and does so in a very balanced way. This a suberb beer once you get it to your palate.","droomyster","Jan 27, 2009"

I'm going to go with the BA category of american porter. this drank nice, hada good porter / coffe aspect to it, but fell short in the cleanliness and maltiness of a baltic porter as I've had them.

Pours a clear dark cola brown under a deep tan head that barely rises above film and settles quite quickly without managing to generate any lace. The nose is strong of coffee and nuts, with a hint of licorice. The mouth is slightly cloying and well carbonated, leaving a bit of a prickly sensation on the tongue. The taste is definitely porter, with a good taste of nuts and a bit of dark chocolate. There is also a fruity sweetness such as from dark plums or red grapes. The hops are subdued, but never absent, generating an espresso bitter at the slow and a bit of a dry ache in the aftertaste. The sweetness never goes away, though. In fact, this is a bit too sweet for too long for my taste. Still, a solid brew, and probably the last sample I'll get of Dominion brewed in Virginia. Sigh!","Globetrotter","Beers"

Roasted malt, some fruit. A hint of hops, but not particularly ""there."" A little dirtier than most porters, almost stoutish.

Quite high in alcohol but none of the taste, they did a very good job of masking the alcohol flavor. Pours a nice deep dark red/brown with a strong head and great winter-warmer aroma.
