There is a nose heavy on spice and wood. The palate receives an intense miasma of black cherry, malt and nut, supplemented by a boozy finish that suggests a tanic red wine. The balance could be better and the mouthfeel more weighty. Add a plate of Irish cheddar and ..... yes! All in all, a nice quaff to while away a snowy March afternoon.","jjboesen","Mar 03, 2015"

4.1,5.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 8/8/2013. Pours nearly pitch black color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, brown bread, tannic red wine, oak, raisin, plum, fig, vanilla, light char, and roast/oaky earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malt, wine barrel, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, brown bread, tannic red wine, oak, raisin, plum, fig, vanilla, light char, and roast/oaky earthiness. Slight roast/oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, brown bread, red wine, oak, raisin, plum, fig, vanilla, light char, and roast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of roast/bready malt, wine barrel, and yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly chalky/tannic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent wine barrel aged Baltic porter. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt, wine barrel, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 23, 2014"

This was 2013's vintage I'm going to have to see how this year's holds up. The vinegar tartness is a refreshing factor to this brew, IMO. It adds a depth that makes this malt beer not too cloying nor syrupy on the tastebuds. Back to basics,  this brew is Recommended!","Shroud0fdoom","Oct 10, 2014"

Smell: ripe plum, grapeskin... oaky red wine, tart peach, dark chocolate, light roast. Taste: mildly tart peach, mild tannic bitterness, chocolate brownie batter... moving into the finish some toasted brown bread and plum. The wine barrel certainly adds a lot with the tart stone fruit and oaky vinous notes cutting through the chocolaty sweetness. This is well done.","babaracas","Jul 12, 2014"

Outstanding appearance, very interesting to the nose, kinda of a mix of the porter with the wine which is very interesting. Very good taste, the same mix of porter with the wine sweetness and chocolate, plus there is not bitter aftertaste. Plus bonus points overall for the drinkability with the ABV.

Ripe fruit, very subtle, and some hints of chocolate and smoke on the nose. The initial taste is more intense ripe fruit: cherries, plums, especially; some vanilla and chocolate. And then it tastes like sweet vermouth and the heeltap of a Manhattan. If you like that, well, this one's a winner. I do like it, but in small quantities, so a whole bottle may be best divided amongst like minded friends. The feel is perfect - they really have the carbonation just right.

Bottled on date reads August 06, 2013. Pours a very dark garnet red, almost brown in complexion. Nice foamy head after a generous pour. Smells of dark malts with very noticeable tannin character from the wood. Red wine is there - very subtle but appears more as it warms. Seems like a complex nose of chocolate malt, red wine,and wood. Tastes of dark malts with oaky tannins and a very light red wine presence. Slight burn in the back of the throat from alcohol. Feels medium full with nice carbonation and an even bitterness. Overall, a nicely subtle foray into a used red wine barrel program. Red wine isnn't in your face, and that's fine. This one seems to be about more quieter complexities rather than a tongue punch full of flavors. Will be curious what another few years do to the other bottle. Will likely save for another 2-3 years.","jwhancher","Mar 16, 2014"

3.62,-6.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mediocre head of about half a finger, lots of larger bubbles which diminish its staying power and it’s all quickly gone, lacing likewise on the weak side. Clean black liquid of full opacity, no real orange or yellow tints, just some brown around the edges, no real way to visually gauge the carbonation. Malty nose with cocoa, mocha, coconut, butterscotch and vanilla bean, maybe a hint of sour red wine but no real “vinous” presence, at the same time no real hoppy bite either, dries out the longer it lingers in the nostrils, seems like a straight up porter. Medium-bodied, slightly creamy during the attack then gets quite dry and close to dusty in texture. Chocolate, vanilla, caramel, a light dose of black licorice and coconut as well as scone bread. The carbonation is weak and it moves at a sluggish pace. Glimmer of cherry to plum fruit, not a lot of lactose or milky qualities. While it’s posture is nice, still wish it moved more gracefully. Still not sure what the wine barrels contribute, except some sour notes through the finish. By no means a bad beer, just unsure of what makes it “unusual” versus a basic rendition of a traditional style.","farrago","Nov 03, 2013"

Aromas of bittersweet chocolate and bitter coffee in the backbone, with heavy merlot and cab wine characteristics all over the place. Very rich and layered, with a decent balance. Flavors are wine-like as well, with a dry, red wine forward flavor on a bitter, roasted coffee backbone. Subtle bittersweet baker's chocolate character builds towards the end of the palate. The body is light, but robust and slick. Chocolate and wine blend in the aftertaste once again, with a dry, red wine linger into a slick, dry, lingering finish. Tasty beer, with robust flavors and a slightly increased ABV that make it a sipper.","GarthDanielson","Sep 22, 2013"

What you may think is about to be sour cherry is actually dry red wine which turns to mild sweetness as the chocolate and carmel flavors come through. Mouth is avg at best being too watery but the 8.5 ABV is hidden quite well and is very easy to drink.","weonfire","May 30, 2013"

Base beer is underlying with notes of brown sugar, chocolate, fruit, spice, alcohol. Taste again bold with the red wine notes, base beer hidden a bit underneath and that is tough to do with such a bold base. Felt a bit thinner than expected, moderate carbonation and dry.

3.95,2.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I so thoroughly enjoy the base that a wine-barreled version piqued my interest greatly. Expectations were high. It pours a deep garnet topped by a finger of dusty tan foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, brown sugar, lightly-vinegar-y red wine, and light cedar. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some dark chocolate and some extra red wine for the sake of it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, this turned out to be pretty tasty, though it falls quite short of the base, if you ask me. It's thinner and not quite as robust as the base would lead you think it'd be. Still, fairly good times here.","TMoney2591","Jan 01, 2013"
4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I enjoyed this beer as it is very drinkable due to the lesser ABV (compared to most American barrel aged beers these days).

The flavor is rich with lots of caramel, vanilla, and chocolate with a sweet sugary edge. Light berry tartness as well as faint earthy hops and a vinous quality provide a nice balance against the sweet flavor. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet light sugary mouthfeel. I quite enjoyed this one. The red wine qualities are subtle but provide a nice background note.

4,3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"750 ml corked and caged bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a dark reddish/brown color with almost an inch tan head. There's a decent amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted malt, dark fruit, chocolate, nuts and oak. It tastes like nuts, roasted and grainy malt, dark fruit/red wine, and some chocolate and oak. It's a mostly sweet tasting brew, but there's some tart fruit noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and creamy with a good amount of carbonation. I like this brew, but I think I like the regular Baltic Thunder more. But this is still worth trying, $7.99 a bottle isn't a bad price for this at all.","bluejacket74","Dec 12, 2012"

3.97,2.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This one looks like a baltic porter, very dark brown bordering on black with a very minimal amount of off tan foam up top barely forming a cap, no lacing. Swirls bring back something, yet not much. Smell is in between winey and robust I can pick up the red wine easy with a faint tootsie roll scent and roast. A faint yeast scewnt pops out in the end with some small cocco rounding the scent out. Not picking up any alcohol. Taste is nice with a mix of baltic porter roast and wine barrel oak and grape/berry taste. Baltic Thunder is not the thickest BP out there so I can see how so much red wine/oak sprang up. It kind of takes away from the base beer, which I like better on it's own than red thunder. Either way this does not taste off IMO. It sets out what it is supposed to do. Body is a nice medium with low amount of carb, even off the tap, surprisingly, it's not dead though. This is a nice riff on the original baltic porter and I'll be looking for a bottle to drink when it gets real cold out.","BARFLYB","Nov 23, 2012"

2.82,-27.1,2.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"This poured out as a dark brown color with some highlights of red in it. The head was thin and didn't leave much evidence behind on the glass. The smell of the beer gives off a roasted malt aroma which is decent. Nothing too exciting really. The taste of the beer gave off some chocolate like flavors, some roasted malt and a slight bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was thin, not much body as all, the carbonation was fine but not much depth at all. Overall this was a disappointment, I didn't get much of the wine barrel characteristics at all from this beer. This beer seemed entirely different from the original version of Baltic Thunder... I'm not sure if this beer was old or if it was just a flop from Victory but I wasn't much of a fan of this at all.","Knapp85","Nov 23, 2012"
