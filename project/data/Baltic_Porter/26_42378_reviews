"I'll definitely give it another try once a future batch rolls around, because it was - otherwise - a pretty solid beer."
""
"Flavor is sweet and extremely chocolatey initially, becoming roasty and dry, almost chalky, mid palate, and finishing coffee-like. Dark cherry notes are muted, but would probably meld well, with time. Would love to see this with some age on it. Very viscous, rich body. Just a tad too bitter. That chalky character becomes offputting."

"O - A solid baltic porter, delicious but not too heavy. The 9.0 ABV hides well, keeping this a relatively easy drinker that could pack a serious punch."

"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass. Pours very dark with tan head. I was supprised by the complexity yet smooth drinkability of this porter. The mouthfeel was very silky. This is just a darn good baltic porter and I will be buying this whenever I see it on the shelves."

"o - overall a solid Baltic porter."

"overall, a decent brew. didn't know what to expect, but this is pretty decent."
""
""

"O- This is an enjoyable porter that I am very happy that I got to try."
""
""

""
""
""
"A really tasty beer; the flavors are intense but not over the top. Great sweet creaminess that's balanced perfectly with dark roastiness. There's a lot of coffee-like flavor and aroma in Topless Wytch, which was great, so I'd love to see what Three Floyds could do with a straight-up coffee stout or porter."

"Three Floyds Topless Wytch ---3.5/5"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - this is a fantastic beer and I'd get it every time I see it at the brew pub."
""
"Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, thick, mildy csrbonated and heavy bodied. Not very lager like."
""
""
""
"This was leading it's way to being a remarkable ale until I actually tasted it and found it to be lethargic and boring."
""
""
"Overall- decent example of a Baltic porter that is earthier and more bitter than usual. I'd have liked a more malty, chocolatey porter but this isn't bad by any means."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - really surprised by the lack of hop flavor and aroma (since its three Floyd's), but not in a bad way. This is a fantastic beer and I will definitely get it again if I have a chance."
""
""
"O) People might expect this to be a hopped up brew because it's from Three Floyds. It seems spot on for a Baltic Porter to me, and is quite enjoyable. Reminded me a of Grande Cuvée Porter Baltique - Les Trois Mousquetaires. Glad to recommend this beer."

"Overall, lets stick to brewing highly drinkable ""to style"" brews like this, Three Floyds. Keep doing what youre doing with Zombie Dust, and Dreadnaught.... stop making weird stuff like Man O Awe."
"Satan's subordinate, The Topless Wytch, will take advantage of you like she has me. She's soothing, reassuring, and persuasive. She's known as Eve in the Middle East and will steal your soul. You'll try and stop but there's no chance now. Just give in. Eternity isn't that long..."

"Darn good Baltic Porter with a FFF signature to it. I've had a few but I wanted to put a year on this one-glad I did."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, light char, apple, raisin, coffee, toast, molasses, floral, and roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted malt flavors with moderate fruitiness. Taste of dark chocolate, coffee, light char, roasted malt, raisin, apple, toast, molasses, floral, light pine, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, light char, light fruits, molasses, floral, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of roasted malt flavors with fruity esters; with minimal cloying sweetness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Baltic porter. Very nice balance and complexity of robust roasted flavors with fruitiness; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"Having a lot of barrel aged imperial stouts lately, this beer is in the same class with those. But supplanting more toasty character than that of roast, the beer is soft, supple, and drinkable in comparison even though its body and power suggests something bigger."

"Thanks to jbuddle for sending this one as an extra in a recent trade! Served from bottle into Mikkeller taster flute. Poured massively dark brown with a very light tan half finger head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and nutty. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and subtle milk chocolate. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. This one was fairly well balanced and had quite a bit going on throughout it. However, it didn't really standout from some of the more exceptional brews I've had from the style unfortunately. It was quite easy to drink and could definitely get you in a lot of trouble if you aren't careful. Definitely worth your time trying this one if you have not done so before."

"This one was a bit disappointing for me. I'm not sure if it's because it came from Three Floyds or if it was just subpar in general. The flavors were there, but they were rather faint. This isn't a bad beer, but it didn't have anything that made it stand out. I'm glad I tried this one, but it's not one I would seek out again."
""

"This pours a brown with a faint translucent quality. Slight head as well. It smells malty. It tastes like a porter but I was surprised that it was better, considering that it came from Three Floyd's. it has a medium body."
""
"O: Three Floyds does not do subtle very well, and I’m glad. This is as in-your-face as a Baltic porter is going to be, despite the lack of dense, piney hops that Three Floyds is known for. Still, as far as dark beers go, it’s a style I wouldn’t prefer over something like a stout, an old ale, or even an English porter (thought that’s not to say I didn’t enjoy it)."
""
"The beer pours black with a thin halo of a tan head. Its nose is slightly roasty with a touch of yeast fruitiness. The taste is roasty, slightly fruity with a bit if caramel. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lingering sweetness. Overall this is an interesting baltic porter, from FFF and a great representation of the style for sure, but not my favorite."
""
""
"O - Thus far I have been very impressed with all of the Three Floyds offerings I have tried. While this one does not live up to the some of the others, it is a very solid beer I would happily have again. It has more flavor than some of the watery Baltic Porters I have tried in the past. Chocolate, roasty, dark fruit notes all contribute to a pretty solid beer. The mouthfeel is amazing, despite the lack of head. In the world of FFF beers, this isn't near the top but it is good compared to the entire craft beer world.."
"Overall- There is a nice amount of complexity with a plesant warming that will be nice on a cold winter night."
""
""
""
""
"Probably my least favorite Three Floyds beer ever. Not much going on for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a great brew. very simple and well done. The best of its style."
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer has nice dark char notes in a big but nice drinking porter with a much softer hop profile that remember."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-The balance here was just great. Does not approach Everett level but still a top level porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is dark mahogany with an inch of soapy, foamy, beige head. Aromas of chocolates, dark fruit. Sweet fruits with some cherry notes. Chocolate covered cherries and perhaps a touch of espresso. Raisins, prunes, dates, figs, etc. Perhaps a mild hop bitterness might help to balance the equation a bit. Finishes sweet. Definitely a bottle for sharing, as the sweet character becomes cloying."

"O: Not a bad beer. Can't say I'm a huge fan of the style, but even for the style, this one doesn't seem to bring a lot of complexity and just falls a little flat for my tastes."
""
""
"Flavors of dry and bitter chocolate, fairly substantial and flavorful. Thankfully not sweet as many Baltic Porters can be. Body is somewhat light to medium, some perceptible alcohol traces in there as it warms. Roasty malt and lingering bitterness. Doesn't seem especially hoppy, a rarity for FFF though true to their history of nailing certain classic styles. Worth a try, looking forward to this again on draft as the weather starts to cool off."
""

"Although I had this many times on tap, including this past weekend, I decided to review the bottled version. Pours an extremely dark brown, with a one and half finger beige head that slowly dissipates. No lacing. The aroma is dominated some roastiness and very dark chocolate. Dark chocolate and molasses dominate through the mid-palate and finishes dry with some alcohol warmth, roasted malt, and mild espresso-tinged bitterness. Medium bodied and fairly slick and smooth. I have always enjoyed this potent brew and was very happy to see Three Floyds finally bottle it. Not overly complex, but Topless Wytch is a very solid Baltic Porter and the perfect choice for a chilly Autumn or early Winter evening."

"O - Prett muted all-around. Some Chocolate and dark fruit flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice BP that I've never several times in several different locations. A little easier to drink because it's not quite as sweet as most others in this style and not cloying at all. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very solid baltic porter. Not overly complex, but the flavors all compliment each other."
""
""
""
"D - Aroma was so-so, taste made up for it. The chocolate isn't overbearing but I'm not convinced that this is as well-integrated as it could be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – It’s a bit one-note. Not quite as complex or as extreme I had hoped for from FFF, but overall, a nice Baltic Porter. It was good for the style, and I’m glad I got to try the rare rotating brew from FFF."
""
"Poured in a tulip at the pub. Dark brown with a dark tan head. It slowly recedes with nice lacing. Smell is chocolate, coffee, malt. Flavor is strong of barley and coffee with a nice hop balance. Mouthfeel is kinda thin and the alcohol is well hidden. Very nice beer."
""
"It's a touch thin in body, but nothing egregious. Nicely carbonated. Overall, this is a touch shy of ""good."" Perhaps if this weren't billed as a baltic porter it would score higher. It's a bit one-note (and that note is chocolate). Tasty but also underwhelming considering the source."

"On Tap - Pours a beautiful pitch black without any light able to peek through. A small white-tan head quickly dissipates. Smells of roasted almost burnt malts dominated the nose. First sip is deep roasted malts, slight dried dark fruits, and some coffee notes present. Mouthfeel is top notch as it is super creamy and a real joy. Slightly under carbonated but oh so slightly and certainly not a flaw. The 9% ABV is well hidden and most appreciated. Very tasty!"
"O - Its not bad at all, don't get me wrong, but it is somewhat middle-of-the-road."
"T: This is nothing like the smell. I get a lot of roast with a bit of a smoky aspect that reminds me of cigar smoke. A bit of toffee and dark fruit sweetness towards the finish. The mouthfeel was way thin. I was hoping for a bit more from this."
"5/20/2011"
"O - Good beer. Like it more than a lot of baltic porters and would drink again."
"Very nice porter, dark appearance with some cascade as it formed the head, little to no lacing. Nose was nice with a coffee and roasted malt scent. Taste followed nicely to make a very balanced, enjoyable porter, ABV was very well hidden. Drank much easier than a 9% abv beer should. I would drink this one again in a heartbeat."
"Pours as a black colored brew with a nice decent sized head. It's got some tan lacing down the glass. Chocolaty aroma and heavily roasted malts on the nose, not much hops coming off this. Chocolate burnt toast and smoke flavors on the tongue on every sip. Creamy and dry mouthfeel. This brew all around it rather good. Very glad I tried it!"
"It's hard to believe that it's been over a year since I last had this brew at the 2010 DLD. How time flies... Anyway, it pours a solid obsidian topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, molasses, dark chocolate, burnt toffee, and cocoa powder. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, yogurt (straight plain, y'all), flowers, pine, light mint, and balsa. Somehow, all of these components combine to form a nice, hoppy-ish Baltic porter. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish. Overall, a very nice Baltic porter, one that shows that you can add some hops to the style without completely ruining it."
"drinkable - yep, overall - very good beer of my favorite style."
"D - Not a bad beer, just a slightly dull one for 3 Floyds. Well-crafted and surprisingly traditional, just not my favorite offering from these guys due to the flavor and somewhat poorly hidden alcohol. To heavy to have multiple glasses."
"Nonetheless, really enjoyed this, very creamy and smooth with not even a hint of heat or alcohol, very ease sipper. Will definitely grab this again."
"This is another solid offering from the Floyds. Very rarely am I disappointed in their beers, and this is no exception."
"I sampled this at Goose Island's Stout Fest and then again later that evening at Three Floyds brewpub. This beer poured a black with a light khaki head. It allowed a little light to pass through so wasn't as dark or thick in body as it could've been. The aromas were sweet, malty, and rich. There was some light chocolate to it with perhaps some dark fruit. The flavors weren't as prevalent as I would have liked. There was light smokiness along with chocolate and light dark fruit sweetness. It was just ok for the style. I found it to be a little thin for a Baltic Porter. This beer was ok but wasn't anything to search out in my opinion."
"D- This is quite drinkable due to a light refreshing taste and well masked ABV"
"Topless wytch had the headache dark malts (see my beerthoughts). Arrives dark brown almost black with an inch of foamy tan head that lingers. Aroma is all roasted malts. Taste is dry and sharp: bitter and edged. Served off the hand pump, it is creamy and coffee rich with chocolate far in the background. Roasty and rich toasted caramel malts and toasted barley. Not my thing but a spot-on porter enhanced by cask-to-hand-pump engine creaminess."
"Pours near black with a bit of a head. The nose brings forward a bit of roast as well as loads of dark fruit in addition to some chocolate and coffee. The taste really brings forward some dark cherries, dates, and plums with good roasted coffee. Fairly full mouthfeel with good carbonation. This is a really nice beer that I was glad to be able to try."
"For a porter this is a very drinkable beer that I cannot get enough of."
"Thanks to Steamhead and JoePat for delivery of a sixtel of this delightful brew for sharing at the recent Bowling Green BA gathering. Creamy mocha head and midnight liquid. Everything a Baltic porter should be - assertive but not overbearing with a big body and dense flavor profile of deeply roasted, nearly charred malt flavors and dark dried fruit notes in the background. Finish is a lingering bitterness and a hint of coffee. Very nicely done."
"D At least fair. I could see having more than one of these. 3.5"
"Overall, a decent Baltic porter. Very roasted with light smoke notes. Slow drinking (high abv) but I really enjoyed the many flavors here."
"M: despite being a big dark beer in the summer, begs to be sipped over and over."
"Really enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability -- Smooth, balanced, an excellent example of the style and a pleasure to drink."
"d - I enjoyed this porter a lot. I thought it was well balanced and would love to try it again."
"Quite impressive. Just delicious."
"D- This was a very interesting take on this style and I must say like usual 3 Floyds hits the nail on the head with this. Looking forward to trying this again the near future."
"Well, finally my first review here, and this was a worthwhile brew for such a momentous occasion."
"D- I really enjoyed this one and was glad to try if for sure. Super easy to drink, great tasting and very enjoyable."
"D: Not real smooth enough to drink more than one, but if you don't mind the alcohol aftertaste it's OK as a sipping beer."
"Full-bodied and smoothish with a dry finish. Warming all over the palate and the throat. Very good stuff though the nose is left out somewhat and that drags the whole down some. I really wanted to enjoy this one more as the style is a favorite"
"Well got this on a trade in growlwer form. Well when I first saw it, I thought"" wow is this dark!"" Amber/dark brown in color. Threw me off! As I poured it, i got chocolate, sense of baking dough not quite cooked. The smell was a little flat for me as in, there were not of alot of things sticking up at me. Now for the taste. Woodsey, hoppy and a spice or 2.As for the mouthfeel, this was one that was thin but chewy as well. I swished it around for awhile and it left a nice coat of tatse in my mouth after I finished. One coould drink this frequently, but not one for someone who is looking for complex events to differ on each tasting"
"A very smooth Baltic, quite clean but not meager. I was expecting a bigger, brasher beer from FFF."
"Overall, a decent Baltic Porter with simple flavors and a bit of hidden licorice. I could drink a few of these if I were a little more into the style."
"Oh yea, the spelling is Wytch fyi."
"This is a nice little beer from Three Floyds... I liked this one and I'm glad I got the opportunity to sample it..."
"Tastes smooth, sweet, bitter, and then dry. Milk chocolate moves into burnt grain--rough, unfinished porter malt--and then it moves into much smoother, almost stouty finish of bitterdry hops."
"Medium body, carbonation is soft. Pretty nice, but a bit different baltic porter."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, no alcohol mouthfeel or burn at all. This is reasonably drinkable beer given the abv."
"Pours a dark amber with about a half inch of head. I'd really appreciate more head, but with a growler fill carbonation goes down hill in a hurry. The smell is nothing special. SOme roasted malt and that's about it. The taste is unique IMO. Malty with a lot of hop flavor without excessive bittering. It tastes a little too hoppy for a baltic porter but the mouthfeel is great. It reminds me of a hoppy choclate shake. I'm not doing justice to the flavor, but it really is a great drinker."
"D= Tasty enough to want more, but it was not like most other Baltic Porters I have encountered. As FFF will proudly say, ""Its Not Normal""."
"I've been waiting for this beer to come out again since late last summer. This was quite a delight. Pours an opaque black with no highlights. Very roasty smell. Taste is roasted malt with toffee, caramel and coffee (slight hints). Sweet and sticky mouthfeel. Barely resembles a traditional porter, but this is something I always look forward to. Now maybe they'll bring back the Sand Pebbles from last summer too!"
"Drinkability: Plenty tasty! A fine Baltic Porter from Three Floyds."
"D: Very I really liked this one. A bit more coffee would have made it world class."
"I would prefer some other Baltic Porters over this one but it's a pretty good example of the style."
"Overall, a nice brew. I dont think its something I could drink often but once in a while I would find it enjoyable!"
"Sampled at the brew pub in a 1/2 pint glass. This beer appeared a dark brown. A scant khaki head that left hardly any lacing. Smell is fruity sugar with a giant coffee back. Taste is a chocolaty coffee punch, backed with a fair share of hoppy vanilla twang. Simply, it is VERY tasty. Mouthfeel was a nice blend of creaminess and some drying hop oils. Extremely drinkable. I had to stop myself from really going at that 1/2 pint glass. This is one brew that they should really consider bottling, there aren't many offerings of this style around. And this beer is easily amongst the best"
"Pours an opaque dark brown/red, very thick tan head, tons of thick lacing on the glass, great retention, settles to a thick layer. Smell is awesome, chocolate, roasty goodness, toffee, vanilla and oak, bready, dark fruit and cherry, more chocolate, very nice. Taste is similar, nice thick chocolate and coffee roast, tofee, sherry, alcohol, some dark fruits, brown sugar, wood, very rich and roasty, very nice. Mouthfeel is medium to thick bodied, low carbonation, super smooth, very drinkable. Excellent beer!"
"On tap at Three Floyds and served in a half pint glass. This beer poured a dark brown with a foamy tan head that settled into a thin layer, lingering for most of the glass. A nice coat of lace was left behind. The aroma of the beer was made up of roasted malts, bitter coffee, and a bit of chocolate. The flavor consisted of coffee, bittersweet chocolate, light smoke, and also a hint of earthy yeast. The mouthfeel was full-bodied with minimal carbonation. Tasty and satisfying. Another solid offering from FFF."
"On tap at brewpub. Pours a dark brown. Not the typical blackish color with purple highlights of baltics I'm familiar with. Smell and taste is chocolate, coffee and a nice roast taste from the malts I guess. Good mouthfeel and flavor. Again, I would've never guessed this at 9%. Decent beer, but the Decimator was my beer of choice."
"Very nice, flavorful, creamy rich witha huge finish of roasted burnt malts and fresh ground coffee. Much more chocolate and vanilla in the mouth dominating the mid-palate. Dark fruits and an earthy aspect of roots, and dried fruits."
