The style may be unfamiliar to US drinkers who have a very different notion of Baltic Porter (and there is at least one Polish representative of the latter style), but this is precisely what an actual porter tastes like on the shores of the Baltic Sea, from the Oder to the Finnish border. Latvia and Estonia have similar heavy sweet porters that are, shockingly, their common summer brew. As I said, you have to recognize it for what it is--in context. If you are expecting a standard Baltic Porter style, you'll be disappointed. But, judging on its own merits, it's not bad. Worth another shot or two (which is more than I said about Brooklyn Winter Ale).","VictorWisc","May 24, 2014"

No. It's all sweetness (I'm getting vanilla, now, too), plus an unwelcome leather. Wait, there's the roasted malt and coffee, faintly.

There isnt too much in the smell. I do get just a touch of the chocolate and caramel that you'd expect in a porter but more yeast character and alcohol than is normal. The taste is pretty sweet with some of the alcohol flavors carried over. In the end some of the more typical porter flavors of roast malt and coffee come through. Overall the bitterness is quite low or perhaps that is just my perception which could be skewed by the near cloying sweetness. The body and carbonation level are both in the middle of the range, as mentioned previously the finish is a touch sweet but that gives way to a drying roasty character after a minute or two. Overall I can't get by the sweetness of this, it will appeal to some but I've just never been a big fan of big dark beers that dont bring the malt flavors that their color suggests.","fank2788","Jul 08, 2013"

Earthy and dry hop bitterness that finishes clean with just a touch of lingering grapefruit. Some light graham. Feel is surprisingly light for a beer with this kind of og.

3.82,1.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"O: The mouthfeel is the weak point of this beer, and carbonation is the main issue. It's rather flat. This may be a product of poor bottling/rough shipping, among other things. Still, it doesn't detract enough from the drinking experience to make it totally unenjoyable. In fact, this is a pretty decent Baltic Porter, and more traditional than some examples of the style we see over here. Many American versions (including some of my favorites, admittedly) are affected by that overzealous, bigger-is-better American mentality. They come off tasting more like an Imperial Stout than a true Baltic Porter. It's refreshing to drink something a little more authentic and straight from the source. This is a real brain cell assassin at 9.4% abv too. It almost feels sessionable, and if it wasn't labeled you'd never know it possessed that strength until you were swinging from the chandeliers.","ryan1788a5","Nov 29, 2012"
3.66,-2.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Overall - Odd beer. Has a bit of funky wine character amidst the porter flavor. Drinkable, and somewhat enjoyable. Something I might consider buying again, though it's not necessarily representative of the baltic style.","TheSixthRing","Nov 28, 2012"

Mouthfeel is a little thick and sticky, good balance between sweetness and roasted malts and finishes nice with a crisp finish (ABV leads to heated finish but doesn't nuke the tastebuds or anything). Good, not great, porter, as the tastes themselves are basic but pleasing. Some sweet caramel and chocolate and maybe a touch of candy fruit or something. Good beer, worth trying, not the greatest, but that's more of a critique than an indictment.","clayrock81","Nov 17, 2012"
3.58,-4.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours the color of molasses with a healthy amount of mocha foam that settles to an appreciable veil that remains indefinitely. The aroma is very mild, a faint combination of molasses and cocoa. The flavor is much bolder than aroma, with a roasted malt character headlined by dark fruit, molasses, and alcohol. The alcohol flavor is not extreme considering the ABV, but it's certainly hard to miss. Some vanilla also manifests itself as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is slick and oily, typical of the baltic porters I've tried. A lush, roasty fog lingers in the back of the mouth after all else has subsided, lending a really nice finish. On the down side, the flavor profile lacks some cohesion, with heavy handed flavors smacking the palate variably in succession. I'm not a huge fan of Baltic porters, so perhaps I'm being a bit harsh here. With that said, this is better than other Baltic porters I've tried, so it appears to be a very solid offering for the style.","MaximalC","Nov 11, 2012"

The taste is not smoky or chocolate-like but it most definitely has a weird kind of astringency which leads to a slight hop bite.But that is more like the traditional Baltic style.

The roastiness balances the sweetness somewhat and takes the edge off of the 9.4% alcohol. Alcohol is a little deceptive with only the lightest throat warmth.

In the best way, it's like licking the inside of a fireplace after a holiday season. And it compliments the natural smoke of cumin like a strong but smooth cigar after a char-grilled sirloin. After having two or three of these growlers (on different occasions, of course-- this is a high alcohol beer), I noticed that it's better in the first ten minutes after opening; after that, it loses its already low carbonation and goes a bit flat.

Some roast malt, more caramel/chocolate malt and some peat with molasses.

Solid medium body and almost creamy mouthfeel, especially as it warmed. Borders on too sweet for the style, but still quite drinkable, went down easy. Wouldn't turn this down if offered again.

4.35,15.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Black Boss pours an opaque brown-black body with gleeming chestnut orange highlights at the base of the glass. The frothy tan head drops shortly to an average collar, but does leave some craggy rings of lace before it goes. The nose is rich with dark chocolate, licorice, cold black coffee, dried apple, and a waft of alcohol. It hints at some acetylacetate but doesn't display it outright. In the mouth it's full bodied, creamy, and smooth. The flavor offers no surprises from what the nose suggests. It starts with chocolate and fruit and licorice; warms to become even more like black licorice with a touch of spice (no doubt from the alcohol); and finishes drying with a light touch of spice, some dark-skinned fruit, and more dried apples. Roastiness rises in the aftertaste. The alcohol stays in check pretty much throughout the entire serving, reigned in by the dark malt and fruit. Quite nice, and very drinkable despite its girth and strength. Absolutely worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Nov 11, 2006"

The mouthfeel borders between medium and full-bodied. This is a vinous, alcoholic porter. Husky grain flavor upfont. There's an understated flavor of chocolate that follows. Alcohol emerges in the flavor in the finish and is not hidden very well. Virtually no bitterness in a very non-dry baltic porter. One of these gets the point across. I downgraded the drinkability not so much because of the high alcohol content, but this this isn't a very interesting baltic porter. Still good enough for a night cap.","Winter","Oct 15, 2006"

My wife is Polish and I have come to love many Polish beers, particularly the porters which seem to be one of their better styles.

After the nose, the bee's flavor surprised: a dry begining with with warm, sweet malts in the finish that opened and deepened as the beer warmed.

Aroma of roasted malts, molasses, and burnt cherries. Taste is a bit simplistic but still enjoyable. Dark fruits and toasted grains seem to maintain the initial flavors of the beer. A fortified wine feeling comes towards the middle then comes the acidic finish. Body is a tad thin but that helps this beer go down rather easily.

Taste is quite nice as well, roasty and chocolatey with some bitter coffee notes and an oily, slighlty hoppy, and yummy finish. Mouthfeel is a bit light for the 9.4% this one is packing, but it works oh-so-well and ups the drinkability of this bad boy quite a bit.

Nose is roasted grains and espresso with a mysterious fruity sweet kick. The taste has a similar two-faced profile. Starts off with roasted barley, coffee and dark chocolate, then pulls a 180' on you and dives into a raisin/prune/date dark fruitiness with an alcohol bite. The finish is much sweeter than I have ever experienced in a porter. It was a little off-putting at first, but I got used to it half way through the pint. This is an interesting brew no-doubt. The alcohol is hidden rather well for 9.4% and the mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation. The jury is still out on the taste profile, it was interesting if not a little cloying, but worth a try at this unbeatable price. It'll get you drunk!","Golden2wenty1","Jul 20, 2005"

Nose has a splendid burnt grain aroma with a sweet malt backing, caramel, and a somewhat earthy tone present; start is sweet with a nice grain profile, the top middling in its feel.

Has a very distinct scent of prunes, olives, molasses, and vinegar. Also alcoholic. For lack of a better term, it smells Greek. Taste is similar, strange fruits and and alcohol. It's sickeningly sweet and sour at the same time. The only time it seems like a porter is at the end with some caramely notes. No chocolate or coffee here.
