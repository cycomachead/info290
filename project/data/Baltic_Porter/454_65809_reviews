"huge fan of the style, i say that a lot, but this bourbon barrel edition has to be one of the most decadent beverages going. at 12% abv and with enough boozy sweetness to render its lager yeast past a distant memory. a half shade lighter than shiny black shoe polish, the head surges near the rim of the glass on the pour, and only relaxes slowly. it smells incredible, dry fruity must, the wood is very very prominent, and the lack of bitterness in the malt base means the sweetness of the bourbon is high. they may have overshot the grain bill just a bit, as this beastly bodied brew has enough sugar to keep on going up. good bourbon barrels i suspect, as there are no weird thin fusel notes on this, and the charcoal aspect is there all the way. ashy almost burnt malt flavor in the middle, before it gives way to traces of rum, licorice, and espresso. potting soil earthiness to it as well before the sugars come on. the alcohol is very strong, no denying that, i wonder what lager yeast they used to get it here. the science is as interesting as the final product. a bold but elegant brew on the whole, my first form arcadia. maybe not my favorite baltic porter, as the thing that makes that style awesome is paved over a bit here, but the beer is of astounding quality. id like to cellar one awhile. thanks to thebrewo for opening this one with me!"

"O: completely stunned - not often partial to porters, this one easily eclipsed the very best of 'em - the bourbon barrel aging was superior, coupled with some favorite flavors and feels. Gotta try it."

"dark brown pour, rich creamy beige head.  massive bourbon aroma right away. tons of vanilla as well. taste is creamy smooth with the vanilla really shining through. lots of chocolate too. the bottle has been sitting for over 2 years now so i dont get much booze. age has done this well. i think im drinking it at the perfect time. body isnt the fullest but its not meant to be for the style. very very easy to drink. awesome!"

"Poured from a bottle. Let it warm-up a bit from fridge temperature. The beer is a nearly opaque black-brown with red highlights. There was a scant dark brown head. The aroma is fairly typical of a barrel aged beer: oak and bourbon with a hint of sweet malt -- and virtually no hops. The taste follows, but the oak and bourbon are slightly downplayed compared to other similar barrel aged beers, letting more of the porter's character to shine through. As a result, some roasty malt is evident. The body is medium with medium-light carbonation. Overall, this is more what I'm looking for in a barrel aged beer: less of the cloying oak and bourbon sweetness that is characteristic of many others. Too bad it's so pricey, so this one will remain a special treat."

"O- Not my thing. Decent, but hasn't melded together as well as it could have."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O â€“ Has an aroma profile to match the best barrel aged beers, but the alcohol is a bit harsh and the bitterness is not very pleasant in the finish.  A tasty but unbalanced beer, to a fault in this case."
""
""
"This is a very bourbon forward barrel aged porter. The booziness is apparent from the nose right from the get go. Definitely get a lot of toffee, caramel and chocolate here. At 12% this packs a punch, but it goes down easier than the ABV would have you imagine. A sipper with complexity and a smooth mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps a bit extreme in some respects but overall a pretty awesome brew."
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"

"Really nice beer that slowly gets better as it warms. It stays true to being a porter with its mouthfeel, but I still can't help but feel it could use a little bit more body. As it stands, it's way too damn drinkable for an 11-12% beer. This beer is an absolute treat, but at $8 a single, it makes me hesitate... but it also makes me wonder, why do I think twice about getting a 12oz bottle for $8, but I don't double take at the price of $18-$20 for a 22oz bomber?"
""

""
"Pours oily black with almost no head to speak of, but a creamy and lasting lacing on the edge of the glass. Smells of rich caramel and oak with hints of chocolate and booze. Taste is similar to the aroma with a strong Bourbon presence and lots of toast and toffee. Mouth feel is slightly more smooth / lighter than what you'd expect from the malt profile and barrel presence. Finishes sweet and clean."

"Really good BA Porter, very smooth and extremely easy to drink at 12% Was also extremely pricey which will keep me from giving it a ringing endorsement, however price aside, it was a very good BA ale worth a try. No huge bourbon tones, just lots of rich dark chocolate flavors. Really not as complex as I would hoped~"

"O - Bourbon barrel aged Shipwreck was a real treat and honestly a bit under appreciated in my view. This thing is class in a bottle and I will look for it every time a batch is bottled. It keeps true to barrel aging big brews while adding some unique character from the Michigan brewery. This put Arcadia on the map for me and opened up many other experiences for me and their offerings. Very delightful stuff."

"O:  I really like this beer.  It has a great flavor, and some booze to make this a great fall sipper.  It didn't seem to mellow as it warmed, and the alcohol intensified.  I still enjoyed every sip..."
""
""
""
""
"The roasty goodness that brew could be is completely overbalanced by the booziness. That said, I would still recommend this for a huge beer that does not hide it's hugeness but rather wears it proudly."
""
"*additional note - I drank the second half of the bottle at a colder temperature and it was more pleasant. Some chocolate notes came out and the finish was less bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Strong work from Arcadia - really nails the bourbon barrel presence without letting it take over the beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good beer. Not quite as good as a BB stout but worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O - With an abv like this, I can't help but compare to others in the same range. This is very good, but not quite THAT good."
""
""
""
"A solid porter base but the bourbon was pretty mild to me. I guess I hoped it would be a little more aggressive. Enjoyable but there are options with more personality, especially at this high abv. I like the idea of being cautious, but this 12% beer has all the character of a 9% beer. The bottle was super difficult to get open."
""
"A really fantastic and underrated barrel aged brew."
""
""
"O: as I said earlier, I do not normally like porters. This, however, is a very good barrel aged example. I love when beers have wax on top, so that adds to the appearance. Go try this, it is a great pour, and it is something that I rarely try. The beauty of trading."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-good blend and balance of flavors, smooth and enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"opened up a bottle from 2014.  Smells great, looks great, but there is an off taste that I can not explain.  I liked this a lot more without a year of being sat in my basement."
""
"O: Very good. Definitely starts bourbon heavy, but some of the complexities that follow are quite enjoyable, combined with a silky smooth delivery. Certainly worth a try. It would be interesting to see what some age would do to this. Cut the wax with a sharp knife just below the cap, and had no problem."
""
""
""
"What a pain to get the wax off the cap! Otherwise quite good. Guess they call this a porter at 12%. Tastes more like a stout to me. Lots of chocolate notes in the noise and north. Heavy booze taste should dissipate after some time. Pretty darn good. Excited for this to age a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very tasty bourbon barrel porter. The base beer seems like it has a bit of a hard time holding its own against the heavy bourbon flavors. It seems the roasted malt character just doesn't have the same strength that it would have in a similar stout, and thus gets lost a little. It's not bad, don't get me wrong, just heavy on the bourbon flavors with complimentary porter characteristics (and not the other way around, like it usually goes). Very oaky in general too, if that's your sort of thing."

"Overall this is a fantastic BA beer. I've been hesitant to buy it given the price tag but was fortunate to score this as an extra.  I will most likely pick this up in the future when I feel like splurging  definitely a must try at least once"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a decent porter with an good smell but an overpowering amount of bourbon from a taste perspective."
""
""
"Dark brown color with a decently foamy off-white head. Smells and tastes strongly like bourbon. Also has plenty of malts and some hints of chocolate and coffee. Has a full-bodied feel and goes down pretty smooth. A nice drink to warm you up, but it is definitely strong."
""
"O: I picked this up on a trip to Michigan on a recommendation from the store owner (it's the last bottle!) but have to say this fell flat for me. If the aroma was better and some of the off flavors I was picking up (maybe it was age, or an infected bottle?) were fixed it probably would be a very solid beer. But this one.. not so much."
""
"O - Nice job Arcadia, 'really held up well for being a few years old, would like another one of these but only have one. The bourbon is pretty bold so if you enjoy that type of thing this will be a beer for you."
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 7/15/2013. Pours fairly pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, raisin, caramel, toast, toffee, dark bread, vanilla, bourbon, oak, clove, coconut, and roasted/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, raisin, vanilla, toast, caramel, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, dark bread, light coconut, and roasted/oak earthiness. Light earthy/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, raisin, toast, toffee, caramel, dark bread, bourbon, oak, clove, and roasted/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible depth, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with and awesome malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding barrel aged porter! All around awesome depth and complexity of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"This is a nice porter that rested in bourbon barrels. It is nice and chocolaty with some good coffee roast to finish. Wish it felt a bit thicker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is an insanely good beer. Wish I had another one, or atleast had cracked this next to a BA Framinghammer to compare to. My goodness was this delicious."
""
""
"Overall, the best beer I have ever had from Arcadia and restores my faith in this brewery. An exceptionally well balance barrel aged beer that could be enjoyed by a novice or a connoisseur. Worth trying and is one beer that I plan to revisit in the future"
""
""
"Pitch black with a light beige head that dissipates quickly leaving some very nice lacing. Strong bourbon aroma - excellent, but not overpowering, with a hint of vanilla bean . Complex bourbon, expresso, and vanilla flavor, and a little alcohol bite, still goes down smooth. A full bodied porter that has the mouthfeel of a stout. Overall outstanding."
"Pours a very dark brown capped by a one and half finger beige head. Above average retention; bits of thin lacing evident. Baker's chocolate and light hints of oak and bourbon on the nose. Opens with dark chocolate, some toffee notes; a bit nutty and biscuity midpalate. Finishes with roasted cocoa powder, light espresso notes, a very light hint of prunes, and pleasant oakiness accent with a bit of bourbon. Medium, slick body with a touch of creaminess. Lower level of carbonation that still makes its presence known. Overall, a solid BA brew that I'd revisit again."
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"Pours a brown-black color with a very fine head, though overall more carbonation than would be expected considering the extended barrel aging process. Rich aroma of bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, cherry, dark, faintly roasted malt, tobacco, prune, charred wood and alcohol. Flavor profile is rather sweet throughout, with plenty of toffee and brown sugar, combined with dark, dusty chocolate, malt roast, more bourbon and vanilla, and finishing warm and moderately bitter, with a background of earth, cherry, and some detected booziness. Warming and hefty on the palate, smooth and coating, with a very full body, as anticipated. Overall, this was a solid porter considering I do not drink much of this style!"
""
"Pretty mediocre here. Not outright bad, just to thin taste and body wise, with to much fusel alcohol."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I was underwhelmed by this one. Most likely due to the almost non-existing barrel presence, thin mouth feel and an overall lack of flavor. Weak in the nose, but I found a little roasted malts, even less vanilla and some chocolate. I don't know, I really wanted to like this beer. I like more of a bourbon flavor forward, and from what I've read, the 2011 vintage was probably for me. Definitely going to give it another shot."

"Overall this is about what you'd expect from a bourbon barreled porter, only with more bourbon than you might be ready for. To me that's a good thing."
""
""
"The taste is very bourbon dominant but has a lot of character following it, I really liked the flavor and the feel of this, I will be getting more and enjoying more often. Excellent"
"Very, very nice."

"A truly delicious and potent porter, meant for sipping. Decadent and very strong. Highly recommended for fans of big slow-drinking beers, as it goes down smooth and velvety, but you can feel the alcohol right away. Very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a knock your sox off ass kicking Barrell aged porter. I wanted to savor every sip and really make this one last, but before I knew it, this wild ship wrecked bitch was gone. I got two of these with the idea of aging one, but I may just go back and get a few more to age for a few years."
""
""
"O: Dominated by the boozy bourbon, not hot, but the alcohol is definitely present. The finish dries out and is maybe a touch astringent at the bottom of the glass. Super tasty; I am wondering how age will affect the beer."
""
"Poured out of a 12 ounce bottle. A great bourbon nose, full mouthfeel, and lingering aftertaste. A one inch head appears when poured that quickly dissipates. Minimal head retention and no lacing on the glass. This is still a very enjoyable barrel aged porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall quite possible the most balanced strongest porter I ever drank so worth the price of admission. Seeing the base beer retired makes me sad as it was a long time want with me. Still trying this I can see an enhanced bourbon soaked version of what I once loved. Pick it up if you can."
""
""
"What a fantastic Baltic Porter! I love when I find myself drinking exactly what I want to be drinking at this point in time. Highly recommended."

"Arcadia Barrel Aged Shipwreck Porter ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours black with a tiny tan head. A little light on the nose with notes of bourbon, vanilla and roasted malt. Taste has slight tartness to it with the the vanilla and bourbon flavors from the nose and a little coffee. I hoped for a little more barrel flavor than I got. Medium body and carbonation. Overall a decent beer, but there are better non-barrel aged options for a lot less money."
""
""
""
""
"O- This is an interesting brew and most memorable one from Arcadia that I've had. The bourbon character doesn't linger as much as I hope for in BBA beers. Kinda of turns into a regular porter/stout after the initial bourbon leaves your palate. I was surprised to feel little burn with the 12%. Would like to try Black Butte sometime to compare, glad I picked this up."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma and its flavoring. The aroma takes the bourbon barrel aged aspect of this guy all the way, to the point of boxing many of the other components out, just so it can be seen and appreciated. The flavor, while inclusive of the wonderful, warming, oaky, bourbon glory, leaves much more room for the base and the rest of the beer to blend and show through. The balance is actually great, but may be a touch to boozy for the unseasoned. This beer marks our introduction to Arcadiaâ€™s barrel program, and only makes us more excited about Shipwreckâ€™s brethren. This is one beer that certainly lives up to the hype in every category, and we are ever so grateful to have finally gotten to experience this local gem."

"O: This was one incredible beer. I'm very glad I let this sit for a year because it's drinking fantastic right now. Anyone that still has bottles should really consider opening them right now. I can't see it getting much better than this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Eh, I was definitely let down a bit by this one. A little too sweet, way too bourbon heavy, and has some strange flavors that didn't mesh well. Maybe it's the 2011 version? I've heard later releases have toned down the bourbon quite a bit, but this one was a little too much."

"O- ok BA porter. Whatever barrels they use for this beer I get more booze than a specific distill."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"2011 bottle poured 01/07/13 Pours a midnight black with a thin light brown head that quickly dissipates. Even after aging quite a bit, the bourbon is the star attraction in both aroma and taste. Aroma also contains a wonderful chocolatey malt. Tastes of a heavy bourbon but tapers off nicely into smooth vanilla. It is a bit on the thinner side for a 12% abv beer but makes it very drinkable for such a big beer."
""
""
""
"o - by far the best beer i have had from arcadia. almost a year old (not including the year spent in barrels) and, while the flavors blend extremely well, this beer is still pretty hot. enjoyable and quite drinkable for 12% though. i will definitely be picking up more of this."
"Oily and warm palate make for a great sipper and nightcap."
""
""
""
"Overall: I would say that I thought this beer was a bit underwhelming. I needed a more full flavor and a thicker body. I don't think I need any more in the future."
"M: rounded, tons of bourbon depth"
""
"Not bad but it's not not for me. It doesn't seem to even try for balance. The base beer never quite surfaces. There are much better and well rounded barrel aged beers out there for far less money."
"Overall: Really nice, would definitely have again"
"O: This is a really nice beer. The barrel treatment is overdone, as I can still get a good amount of roast and malt out of it. I'm a fan."
""
""
"Poured into a snifter, this beer has the expected black color with low carbonation and very little head. The aroma was a grapey-like whiskey aroma. This was not a typical whiskey aroma, which should have been my first clue that something was wrong. The initial taste was the smooth yet biting sensation of alcohol. Rather than drinking beer, it felt like I had a mouth full of cheap whiskey. Amidst, the burn were hints of a bunred dark malt, vanilla, and dark fruit. These pleasant notes could not overcome the burn of the alcohol in my mouth that continued to burn in the aftertaste. There was no sense of balance to this beer. I am able to recommend several good barrel aged porter, but this would not be one of them."
"Verdict: Delicious porter, great barrel characteristics and nice complexity on the tongue, not overly boozy for 12% but certainly a big warm beer. Arcadia certainly hit the mark with this one, a must try for anyone who loves a porter or barrel aged beer."
""
"Cost: $5.99 for a 12 oz bottle."
""
"Overall: This is one delicious brew. It is certainly bourbon forward. It is a little hot, so be forwarned if you do not enjoy bourbon forward barrel aged brews. This is a most enjoyable brew and I am glad I had the opportunity to put a few of these away."
"Delivers a big beer with rich bourbon. Aged and that added to richness. Black, thick head, fuller mouthfeel. Solid porter, and drinkable, but too big a beer to have on a regular basis. Chocolate and understated roast.A spot of wood and coffee.Worth a try."
"Overall - The porter has difficulty standing up to the barrel, but it all tastes good. I don't get how a 12% porter feels too weak for the barrel, but it does."
""
"O- This was a very good BB aged beer. The bourbon wasn't too overpowering, there was a nice fruity cherry flavor that balanced well with the bourbon and light chocolate, and is very easy to drink especially at 12%. Due to it's high abv it's not something I'd want to drink all the time or a full 12oz again, but definitely a nice beer to have from time to time in small doses. I hope to enjoy this one again in the future."

"Excellent BA Imperial Porter! Huge notes of chocolate, vanilla and dark fruits. Balanced bourbon and subtle hints of tart cherry. Very warming yet the booze is well hidden. :)"

"A decent barrel aged porter, started stronger than it finished. Drinks a bit slow"
""
""
""
"Overall: Bourbon."
""
""
"(originally reviewed: 02-05-2012)"
"Pours a coffee black with a broken sheet of light tan foam. Nose is strong, smelled it from a couple feet away - lovely. vanilla, caramel, honey, bourbon, hints of mineral and amaretto. Really would place the nose here on par with some of the best out there. Flavor is sweet and carries much of the character from the nose: vanilla, caramel and amaretto. Plenty of roasted malts in the flavor along a hint of cocoa. Carb is about right with moderately subdued, but the body is thin for the beer. Really a nice beer, and I'm glad I've tried it. I would love to drink more of it if it was around. Really a diamond."
""
"O - Good for a bourbon aged brew, but not worth the rather high price."
"Pours a very murky, dark brown, almost black color with a small tan head. Scent is lovely toffee at first with some chocolate biscotti. A bit of bourbon whiskey and coffee as well. Smooth vanilla throughout. Great smelling beer. Taste is initially sweet chocolate with some biscuity malt flavors. A bit of dark fruits with vanilla and subtle whiskey flavors. A bit of dark chocolate and toffee in the finish. Not nearly as much alcohol burn as I was expecting from this 12% beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied...could use a little more body. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a great beer from a brewery I've never heard of."
""
"This is a decent barrel aged brew. It has plenty of flavor and isn't very strong."
""
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is full of bourbon and chocolate, with some nice maple and a hint of oak thrown in. The flavor is even more complex than the aroma and is very nice. I get a lot of chocolate and roasted malt, as well as some whiskey, maple and vanilla. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
"I'm liking this. It doesn't hold up to the big boys of bourbon barrel stout/porters of the twelve ounce realm but it's in the drinkable second tier for sure. Favorite Arcadia thus far."
"O. A really nice Baltic Porter here, almost stout like. The barrel aging is well done, though I'm not sure the base beer had quite enough character to hold up to the wood, which is just a little too strong on the finish. Otherwise, this is just a really nice porter with a wonderful roasted chocolate malt and dark fruit presence and some solid bourbon notes. Quite impressive."
"O- Very impressive brew for sure. Seek this one out."
""
""
""
""
"O: A good, big, barrel-forward porter, sure to slake your thirst for such a beer. Given the size and intensity of the flavors, this is probably best shared. Big and flavorful enough to stand up to a variety of cheeses or desserts."
""
""
"Very enjoyable and an easier to get -bal beer. Falls shy of perfect in a few areas and solid overall."
""
""
"mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet up front with a semi dry finish with plenty of oaky tannins. Damn. Nice beer!"
""
"O: Honestly, pretty out of balance. The barrel-ageing is overdone and the malt underdone."
"2011 edition. Pours dark opaque brown, velvety looking, and no head. Smells of coffee, chocolate and bourbon. Tastes of chocolate bourbon, roast, a bit of licorice, and more chocolate bourbon. Great mouthfeel that gets chewier as it warms up. Whiskey is strong but does not overpower the complex porter. Low carbonation here, a bit heavy, but really velvety and smooth. Man is this good!"
"It feels so fantastic in your mouth, so full bodied, yet light and creamy. Its as thick as it can be without being overpowering."
""
"O - Way too boozy. This would probably benefit from aging and become a completely different beer."
""
"Bottom line, very good beer. The best I've had from Arcadia."
"O: A decent beer, but not as good as I remember. Great bourbon flavor is accompanied by a nice chocolate and toffee flavor, but the beer is a bit thin. I find myself wanting some roasted malts, too."
""
""
"Speaking of shipwrecks, when will the BA site finally get fixed?"

"Overall the base beer for this is a little weak. Great barrel aging, the whiskey really shines, but I'm a little disappointed with the base porter."
"O: Solid BA beer, but not the best. Good standing B+."
"OVERALL: A solid and enjoyable beer. The flavor profile was a little lighter and mellower than I prefer, but that actually made it drink away very quickly. A bigger, fuller palate on this one and you could have a real winner on your hands. Thanks again for the trade Doodler. This was a very enjoyable porter. Recommended."
"This beer is weird. I figured the Baltic in this porter would be bigger, instead, this taste like a regular porter with bourbon, without the alcohol in taste and scent. I don't know, but at 7 beans a bottle, not again for me. Glad to try it."
""
""
""
""
"I'd had this at a tasting (after I bought the bottle) when it was fresh, and wasn't terribly impressed. Allowing this to cellar a year mellowed it and calmed some of the tanginess that had given the fresher version an almost sour taste. A very good beer, that at 12% I will be sipping quite slow!"
"This was so much more muted than I expected, which was good and bad. The bourbon isn't in your face, but then again I kept waiting for something to really stand out and nothing really did. Maybe it mellowed from aging? Regardless, I still really enjoyed it and the easy drinkability had some major appeal. I'll be looking for this again."
"Overall a real nice sipping bourbon barrel aged porter that I was super stoked to try on tap. Nice beer, would easily drink again. Best sipped."
"O: It may not be Williamsburg AleWerks BB Porter, but it's damn close. Arcadia has crafted what might as well be called a Russian Imperial Stout, as this has the ABV and feel of said big brews. This is a solid barrel aged offering, and one I have no qualms recommending."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I've had other BA Porter's recently, and this one is the best yet. The alcohol is actually hidden quite well for 12%. It's definitely a big beer, and a sipper, but I'm really enjoying this one. My favorite beer from Arcadia thus far."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this but it's a bit too pricey for a 12oz bottle. 12% alcohol would prevent me from having another one anyway, but I'm glad I tried it."
"O: A very good Baltic Porter from Arcadia. I'm glad I had picked up a bottle of this, I only wish I had one more to see how it mellows out after a year. Delicious!"

"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and chewy on the tongue. The barrel character really kills on the nose with this one, but doesnt quite translate to the flavor. Still a really nice beer though - I'd definitely have this again."
"O: A really fantastic beer by Arcadia. This doesn't quite reach the pinnacle of my favorite barrel-aged stouts, but it's not a stout. I love when brewers barrel age beers that are out of the ordinary, and Arcadia really does a great job with this. I have never had this beer aged, so I am glad I have one to lay down for at least a year to see how it changes."
"O: Overall a very solid offering and I definitely enjoyed this but doesn't necessarily blow me away. I don't think this beer would benefit from any extended cellaring. So drink up! 4.0"
""
"O- This would seem to be a heat bomb with the bourbon but its not. Drinks nicely as it warms up. A solid porter, one of my favorites."
"Overall: Damn this is good! Huge but not outrageous, doesn't burn you with alcohol like the Founders Better Half I had before this. Big, balanced, delicious. Is this really Arcadia?? :-)"

"O: A phenomenal beer, well crafted, refined, enjoyable, and pretty drinkable for a sipper. Using a Baltic Porter for this base beer adds levels of complexity. It was highly recommended to me, and I'd do the same to anyone else."
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer, the bourbon accents and compliments the flavors, and the flavors are great!"

"overall, boy does that bourbon barrel work wonders with beer. awesome brew. wouldn't put it up with the creme de la creme of BB ales, but would nurse one on a biting winter night anytime."
""
"Beer is 12% and it let's you know. Very strong. Aggressive. Thick up front. Sweet very sweet. Finish thins but isn't dry. It is a little too boozy for me but it is a fine beer. I probably won't have it again."
""
"I enjoyed this beer as it was not so overpowering with the bourbon flavors and scents. The aging did what it was supposed to, which was to mellow the malts and hops yet bring out some of the flavor characteristics of what is a very drinkable porter on its own."
""
""
""
""
"O-Glad to finally try this.One more solid BA beer."
""
""
"This beer pours a medium bodied Coca Cola brown that turns to black as it pools in my glass. It has a soft and creamy beige colored lacing. The aromas are full of barrel. It features a lot of sweet vanilla and sweet bourbon. The sweetness is high enough to overpower any chocolate or coffee that would normally be present. If you're looking for a lot of barrel sweetness though, this is your thing. The flavors begin with a boatload of vanilla then heads into light bourbon, sweet cream, toffee, smooth chocolate and whipping cream. Its a big improvement from the nose and features a lot of complexity. I'm quite impressed. The flavors are just so creamy and smooth and perfectly integrated. The aftertaste is phenomenal, like creamed coffee. It drinks medium in body and doesn't show the 12% at all. Overall this is a really nice beer. The barrel aging is really nice and adds good complexity. This is a great representation of the style."
""
"overall, pretty good. excellent BA flavors."
""
"On the fuller end of medium bodied with a prominent barrel character that is nicely integrated into the flavor of the base beer. Dry and spicy with toasted oak, vanilla and a blast of sweet bourbon that has boozy flavor without much heat. I'm not sure what kind of barrels they use but the bourbon flavor is really nice. Although this beer is heavy on the bourbon flavor, it's far from one dimensional with lots of rich malt flavor underneath. Toasty with hints of chocolate, caramel, toffee and oatmeal. There's some subtle heat with nice warmth in the finish but overall the high ABV is very well masked. It's nice to have a BA beer that's not a complete bourbon/booze bomb but it's definitely still a sipper. Highly enjoyable."
""
"O: Excellent use of barrels, this is very rewarding for anyone that likes this style(everyone nowadays?). I really wish Arcadia wasn't just distributed to odd places here and there-not anywhere near central Ohio, well ok, maybe just this beer. Well worth the higher price tag."
"Overall, This is very tasty and very complex. Drinkability is fairly low, but to be honest I don't often get into the 12% ABV range too often."
"Bottle. Found in MI on my last trip out there. Not cheap at about $5/12oz bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a light tan tan. Rich aroma of molassess, oak barrel, bourbon, and light roast. Medium mouthfeel. The alcohol not only adds flavor but seems to also thin out the body a little bit. Booze, roast, and then back to bourbon. This one just seems it needs to mellow out a bit as it is pretty hot right now. Some lace."
"Overall, this is definitely a solid beer, if a bit overpowering. As I noted, my thoughts are that this could use a bit more time to let the bourbon and booziness subside a little."
"O: A good porter. I like a little more out of special-release bourbon barrel aged beers, but this is a good one."
"Arcadia knocks this one out of the park. The barrel aging adds to and enhances the other flavors. Mellow, smooth bourbon throughout that's about as good as it gets. A must seek out."
"O: This is a killer beer. As already mentioned, I love porters, and I love barrel aged beers, but this is very well done. It's a very well integrated beer. I will definitely seek this out to keep in my cellar. And no disrespect but I can't understand reviews that say this is hit and needs time. This is one of the smoothest BA beers ive ever had."
""
""
"I'd drink this regularly if it wasn't so expensive. I can see how some might think the alcohol is too prominent but it works for me. I like how they balanced out all of these rich flavors. However, had to pay $7.00 (in michigan, mind you) for this one. Probably won't be doing that again."
"Overall:	Great evening sipper."
"O- I think I found a challenger to Barrel Aged Gonzo, and a worthy one at that. This is an incredibly balanced and tasty beer...especially for being a 12% barrel-aged porter."
"O - A nice night capper. Alcohol a bit too apparent, but this is still pretty young. I look forward to trying again after letting it sit for awhile."

"The reveal: what?!? BA Shipwreck Porter by Arcadia Ales. Awesome! I havent had this before but what a treat! Thanks Alewatcher!! Simply delicious."
""
"This might not be a mind blower, but it always satisfies. Nice beer by Arcadia."

""
"Poured into a snifter, this is a dark black color with light lace head. Smells are creamy bourbon, vanilla, butterscotch, and raisin. Taste is very sweet, with a lot of brown sugar, molasses, bourbon, cream, and chocolate. Mouthfeel is fairly light and alcohol is masked extremely well. This is delicious and surprisingly easy to drink. I am very impressed."
"Never thought I'd see this on the shelf at my local stores, much less in relative abundance. It pours a nearly onyx black-brown topped by a minor bit of dirty ash foam. The nose comprises bourbon, oak, light roasted malts, and a dusting of cocoa powder. There's some minor heat in the background, but not enough to warm the nose uncomfortably. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some dark chocolate, light molasses, and a distinctive heavy touch of licorice. The licorice detracts a bit with its strength (rather than helping things by blending in better with the rest of the flavors). The body is a hefty medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a solid beer, but it doesn't really come all the way together for me."
""
"D - Satisfactory is a good descriptor for this one. I'm not astounded, but it makes me want to check out more barrel-aged porters (Birth of Tragedy, where are you?). This porter mouthfeel integrated with bourbon is a solid combination."
""
"O- Really impressed with this beer, havenâ€™t had anything from Arcadia and was excited to try this BA porter for the first time. The bourbon is very nice in this beer, not very balanced overall, a lot of heat as it goes down. Overall really impressed."
"This is worth a shot, folks."
"This porter works quite well, tastes great, and, for 12 percent, is a nice sipper."
"I really, really enjoyed this beer. It's an expensive one, but well worth it."
""
"I'm pretty sure i've had the regular version of this, but I don't remember it being this good. The BA version is quite nice and what a way to start off the Blind BIF for me."
"Overall- Decent but to much burbon flavor for my liking."
""
"Overall, this is an excellent example of what barrel-aging can do."
""
""

""
""
"Recommended, but not worth seeking out @ $10/12oz. Its good, but not as good as it gets..."
"O: Too thin and not as smooth or balanced as I would like."
""
""
""
"Very smooth for a beer this heavy in ABV. Carbonation is well suited to it, keeps a medium to heavy body. Rather sweet, alcohol burn really builds in the back of your throat, but otherwise alcohol is not really a big factor. Good stuff."
""
"Overall: The bourbon is clearly noticeable throughout each sip, and I am pretty sure it was the brewer's intention to make it overtly noticeable. This is definitely a pleasant sipper, almost comparable to Bourbon County Stout, although I like that a bit better."
""
""
""
"O-- Just impressive. Really good beer something I would want to get again as a good example of what a BA beer should be. Get the notes of the base beer and the barrel takes it to another level"
""

"Overall, a very good beer and my first barrel aged porter so I don't have much to compare it to."
""
"Very impressed. This is an unbelievably good beer."
""
""
""
"O: Really nice, for 12% the alcohol was held in check very nicely and the bourbon added some nice depth."
"This was a very nice surprise especially considering bourbon barrel aged beers can have anywhere from a lot of bourbon to not enough. Shipwreck achieves a great balance with plenty of other flavors coming through. Thanks again, Matt!"
""
""
"This porter leaves me wanting another. Limited availability and price will likely rule out a second. This is one amazing porter."
"OK, I was indifferent to this beer because I've never had a good beer from Arcadia: this one is excellent, so color me surprised. Not a ton of depth, but the barrel aging & mouthfeel were exquisitely done. Perhaps time to give 'em a second chance."
"Drink and overall: This beer really reminds me of Dragons Milk from New Holland. I enjoy them, but can become a bit cloying and overly sweet. The nose, and mouthfeel really make this beer stand out though."

"O This stuff is pretty awesome. I love big bourbon bombs, but this was nice and well rounded. Wish i had some more."
"I had this beer once. It was given to me as an extra if you can believe it! Pours near black with a brown head. Nose has big malts, oak, vanilla and bourbon. So does the taste. It is really nice. Well balanced. Medium to full body drinks nicely. I really like what they did with the barrels by putting the beer in them."
"I need more."
"O: Despite a few faults I really enjoyed this beer. The high alcohol was hidden well and the flavors were delicious and smooth. Itâ€™s not my favorite, but I would gladly drink this again. Thanks Jay!"
"Charred, roasted malts up front. Chalky, dark chocolate bitterness follows. Sweetish malts fill in with notes of caramel, dark rummy fruits, and milk chocolate. Warming, boozy, bourbon into the finish, along with vanilla and oak. Roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and bourbon linger. Medium-bodied, with a slightly watery feel. I expected a bit of a full-bodied feel. Still, the flavors are there and it's pretty drinkable for its strength."
"O: This is a really solid porter and a nice treat. The alcohol has blended nicely and the barrel is really shining in this without the bourbon being over pouring. I recommend."
"O: 4"
"O: a heck of a beer!"
"O: A very delicious Imperial Porter, I'd buy this again in a second."
"Close to full bodied, a light level of carbonation, the mouthfeel is excellent and it's an easy brew to sip on. Well done, Arcadia!"
"o - Overall I thought this was a great barrel aged beer. Nice bourbon comes through but doesn't overpower, and plenty of vanilla and caramel to it as well. Would love to get some more bottles of this one."
"Thank you so very much to kevinv for this as an extra in our past trade! Really can't express how happy I am with the extras you sent me and how happy I am to be able to try this beer!"
"O: delicious brew - I had never heard of this one, but it was worth the $10 or whatever I paid. Not super balanced, as the bourbon takes over and there isn't a malt profile to take it on. It's complex and delicious, and I didn't expect better."
"Overall: A nicely crafted BA Porter that is worthy of a try by any BeerAdvocate."
"O: The very best Arcadia has to offer. Love it. I hope it get released again."
"O: After I got this bottle in a trade a couple of months ago, only then did I here the great buzz surrounding it. Believe me: That good buzz is more than warranted!"
"The beer is dark brown, with a finger of beige head that hangs out indefinitely, leaving some nice lacing on the snifter. The aroma brings vanilla, oak, roast, and booze. The flavor is quite nice, with vanilla, oak, and bourbon blending beautifully. Soft on the palate, this beer goes down smoothly. Easy to drink, with alcohol presence less than expected for a 12% brew. Overall, a terrific beer that I would love to have again. I definitely recommend it."
"O: I like it. The 12% is hidden decently well. I think there is more booze in the smell than the taste, and the booze that does hit the mouth is more towards the finish. A good consistency and good flavor that features the bourbon nicely. I haven't had the base beer before, and wonder how much flavor it has since it was pretty muted, but overall a good beer."
"I'm generally not a fan of bourbon-barrel aged beers, because they often end up being too bourbony. This one manages to bring a fair amount of bourbon character while still maintaining its integrity as a porter. If it had anymore bourbon character, it would probably be too much for me, but as it stands it's pretty damn tasty. A little hot right now, but in a year or two I imagine this would be drinking perfectly."
"Deep mahogany black, thin kahki head that dissipates rather quickly. This thing just screams bourbon which immediately lures me in. I cant say ive had a barrel aged porter like this before but im digging it already. Thick molasses and sap, a decent amount of alcohol, and a lingering but very tolerable slap to the back of the throat make this a delicious sipper. As it warms, it becomes so balanced despite the ABV and bourbon, i really dont think it could get much better. Truly tasty as hell."
"This beer pours a deep black with very slight brown edging. Almost no head formation or lacing, a little bit of mocha brown but didn't linger. Nice deep bourbon nose, slight burn. Helpful vanilla, oak and molasses. Taste is much the same. Quite strong bourbon flavour accompanied by the vanilla and molasses. Some currants and slight hop citric tang. Mouthfeel was a bit too warming but decently smooth. Overall a tasty brew, liked that waxed cap, wish I had another for the cellar..."
"Pours completely pitch black with not a chance of any light coming through. A frothy white-tan head lovingly crowns the beer. Smells bourbon easily dominate the nose with some malt contributing to the overall aroma. First sip is bitter with a plenty of bourbon notes taking charge. Chocolate, vanilla and some dark fruits â€“ plum in particular are present. Mouthfeel really makes his beer rock. It is super creamy and worth noting. Perfectly carbonated with a fairly thick body for the style. ABV is well hidden. This is World Class. Worthy of being sought out. Simply Flawless!"
"Six ounces of this would have been quite enough, and quite gratifying."
"o: delicious and quenching considering. very sweet but welcome and it is balanced well."
"2/20/2011"
"Overall, I'm really impressed with this beer. I've never heard of Arcadia Brewing before this, but this beer is well executed and delivers for the style. All of the components are well balanced and drinkability is quite high for 12% ABV. I could easily finish a 12 oz bottle by myself and wouldn't mind having another. Definitely worth picking up a bottle or two."
"Overall I really liked this beer. Lots of flavors, all of them good."
"Drink- This was damn good. It was smooth, silky, boozy and flavorful. A welcome addition to a nice small tasting and I would love to have this again."
"Pours black with a very, very thin light tan head. A few spots of lacing on the way down, though they don't stick. Half a cap as well. The nose carries a nice, smooth bourbon presence along with some chocolate and roast. Touch of coffee along with some light oak and vanilla. Uber-smooth. The barrel character really shines in the flavor, and carries a good amount of vanilla and light chocolate with it. Good moderate roast in the background, and a bit of oak and accompanying tannin on the backend and through the finish. Medium, chewy body with low carbonation and a really nice creaminess. Barrel-aging well done, Arcadia. Solid brew that I'd love to have ready access to."
"HV"
"This is a really nice BA porter, though you really need to like bourbon to enjoy it. Luckily, I'm a bourbon fan so this one worked for me in general. Not in the league of the best Baltic porters but still a great effort from Arcadia."
"Great tasting beer that I had not really had on my radar before receiving it in a trade."
"Poured a dark brown, almost black, color, with a thin brown head. Aromas of roasted malt, bourbon, oak and milk chocolate. Medium to full bodied, with flavors of dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, oak and roasted malt. Excellent."
"Notes: Nice and rich barrel aged offering. For what is paid typically for these types of brews the quality/price ration is quite phenomenal and made me immediately think of why I did not have a few more of these bottles around. Lesson learned for next timeâ€¦ The Bourbon aging and blending has worked well here, maybe not as nicely as the nose but a very recommendable brew in any case."
"Flavors are similarly muted, drowned out by a steamrolling astringency and a deadening alcoholic presence. Some vague vanilla, roasty malt, and boozy barrel elements. Body is oddly thin and boozy also. Seems like the alcohol got a little too rampant, the barrel obliterated the nuances of the original Porter. Wafting heat rises off the palate, leaving a bone dry finish with some lingering roast malt in the aftertaste, but it lacks nuance and depth. Not something i'd revisit, or consider all that successful overall. More body and less alcohol would definitely improve things..."
"Pours a nice clear brown with an orangish reddish tint and a nice solid light brown head. Very pretty pour. Smells bourbon heavy on the nose. Lots of vanilla and oak on the nose and tongue. The malt backbone is subtle and almost none existant on the tongue. the oak hits first and strongest with some light vanilla undertones. The booziness hits a bit hard but overall is a pretty solid brew. I would definitely drink it again"
"This was a stellar Barrel Aged Porter! Thanks John!!"
"Overall I was impressed with this beer after not expecting a whole lot based on previous experiences with Arcadia. A well done beer thatâ€™s worth a shot."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a low level of carbonation that somehow is strangely prickly on the tongue. Big alcohol influence and lots of flavoring in this. For 12% abv, it is integrated quite nice. A mighty fine sipper that I really enjoyed. I picked through the flavors of this beer and it was complex enough that I feel that I still missed out on some nuances because of how much I enjoyed and concentrated on the barrel aging characteristics. If I see this around, I plan on buying it again."
"Has a licorice and nut smell right off the bat, almost a barleywine influence on it. Pours a thin looking black with just a touch of a white head. Taste is about in line with the smell and has some nuts and other earth things in with the roasted malts. Finishes a little bit sour. The beer is kind of thin, but this is pretty good. I won't buy tons more because of the cost but this is a solid beer."
"O - Overall a very good beer, but the taste is a bit disappointing after the smell. Still a good pickup though."
"The reveal: Arcadia Ales Barrel-aged Shipwreck Porter. Woooo. It actually was a little unfair, since I was sent this in a trade a few months ago and the wax looked familiar. I was looking forward to this though so now I can sit on my other bottle for a little!"
"Anyway, pours black with a very small dark tan head. The nose is muted - cocoa, oak and a bit of a malty, maybe smoked malt sweetness. The taste is a combination of big oak and a small, melded bourbon heat, cocoa, malts, and a finsh of bitterness that seems like a combination of the 50 some IBUs and the tannic, oak quality. This beer isn't boozy in the same way at BA beers can be boozy, and yet the big oak and the bourbon are aggressive. It's somewhat hard to explain how this beer comes together, but it oddly does for me. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than desired, with reasonable lower carbonation. Overall, I like this beer better than what I described below. It does come together pretty nicely."
"This is very drinkable. I need to force myself to take my time drinking this one. So easy to drink. If drunk too fast, however, I'd surely miss out on the wonderful changes this beer goes through in the 45 minutes I had with it."
"O: This actually reminded me of Rahr's BA Winter Warmer. I have a feeling the beer was only aged for around 3 months in the barrels like the Rahr beer. It's tasty and I enjoyed it but I would love to see it aged a bit longer in the barrels to get more of that charred oak and bourbon flavor in there."
"My suggestion is to pick up a bottle of you have it available, but keep your expectations grounded."
"One of the few barrel aged beers that I can say that the barrel aging actually mellows the beer. A very good beer."
"Pours black with dark brown edges and topped with a thin mocha head. Dissipates quickly and recedes leaving little lace. The nose of this beer is pretty good: notes of bourbon, oak, coffee, caramel, and bitter chocolate. I pick up bourbon immediately and it follows up with more coffee, chocolate, caramel, plus some black licorice. This beer is medium to full in body, and carbed on the low side. This ale was a tasty treat! I will seek more for aging and maturing."
"Not a bad beer, but I think it kind of loses it's identity as a porter through excessive alcohol presence. I'll let one sit for a year then give it another shot."
"the bitterness is about right, but could be a little less. the malts are singing a rich aria in this beer -- sloshy and thick i want to just bask in their roasty sweet side -- tone the bitterness down one TICK and this is a 5."
"Pours great with a deep rich color lighter towards the top and bottom. the head is lightly colored and stays for a good amount of time. the smell blew me away. smells like a great bourbon with vanilla and a slight hint of oak and smokeyness followed by a hit of alcohol. vanilla, chocolate, espresso, oak and a buttery taste are all blended magnificently with the vanilla and bourbon flavors shining through the most. the feel, when drinking, is phenomenal. It lingers and leaves the tastes to dance upon your taste buds. This is such a great beer and the best barrel aged beer I've had."
"O: A good, but not great beer. The bourbon notes are well-balanced so that they don't become too sweet or boozy, but I really wish I could get more from the porter that went into the barrels."
"O - Overall a solid beer. Good bourbon character. The nose keeps getting better. The best beer I've had from Arcadia. Happy I've got another to sit on. The edges may round a bit with a year or two."
"Bottle to shifter. Anyone who gives this beer less than an A is flat out wrong. Unless they don't like the type, in which case they shouldn't be drinking it in the first place. The beer is dark and robust in color. Smell is good, with malt and bourbon present. Tastes great. All the great characteristics of a porter, souped up from bourbon barreling. Mouthfeel is good - definitely a sipping beer. Enjoy at stout-like temperature. This beer is excellent. I'm not sure how it had flown under my radar, especially being from SWMI and very familiar with Arcadia, but it had (past tense). I'll be going back for more soon, just to make sure I can hold on to a few for special occasions."
"O - what the hell is this beer? How have I never heard of this delicious beer?!"
"O - This is a very nice beer, especially considering it is a BA brew, available off-the-shelf."
"D - Definitely the best beer I've had from Arcadia. I'd be curious to try this beer at earlier stages in the barrel-aging to see how much bourbon presence there was initially. A nice 12oz treat that's perfect for a nightcap."
"O â€“ I loved this. Just a wonderful porter. Great tasting. Will need more and soon."
"12oz bottle picked up at Binnyâ€™s across from Goose Island: This one pours an inky, dark brown color. There was just a wisp of a tan head that went away immediately. The nose is quite good. Only traces of the bourbon. I also get caramel, chocolate, some vanilla, roastiness and some faint dark fruits. The taste is good. a good integration of the caramel and bourbon, with the latter only mildly showing up in the aftertaste. Hardly any sweetness at all, with some bitterness in the finish. Some roasted notes, chocolate. Nothing really overpowering or standing out. A bit of a subtle complexity to it. Iâ€™d buy another!"
"Well I've had Shipwreck Porter a few times, but I've never really cared for it and never even put my thoughts down on it. Here goes a 12 ounce of the Barrel Aged 12% version. Pours a pitch black hue with a thicket of tan head dwindles slow and leaves chunks of scattered lacing. Aroma has a full on bourbon nose, with hints of caramel/vanilla creaminess. Dark roasted malts provide a touch of black chocolate but is pretty much overshadowed by the bourbon barrel aging. Touch of oak and strong sweet bourbon notes, I'm thinking you really have to love bourbon to drink this beer. To compare this to KBS is unfair, two totally different types of BBA beers. Flavor is full of intense booze and bourbon flavors, that 12 percent is packing some heat instead of abv I feel like I should be talking what proof this is. The base porter doesn't stand up to the barrel, it totally absorbs all of the bourbon barreal effects inlcuding toasted/charred oak, sweet bourbon, hints of vanilla/caramelized dark sugars. Mouthfeel is medium bodied carbonation is low, I'm sure alot is lost during barrel aging. Head formed nicely though I'm not calling this flat in anyway. A warming effect with each sip from the 12 percent abv or 24 proof. Overall you better like you some bourbon or your not going to care for this particular beer, I could give a non bourbon drinker a KBS but if I gave this one to them they may be a bit offended by the straight up bourbon character if their not used to it."
"One of the better Baltics I've had in a while. Only drawback is that it is a bit warm yet. This should age pretty well I'd guess."
"O: This is a good, but not great bourbon barrel porter. It's a little too boozy and thin-bodied and the bourbon flavor comes up a little short. An outstanding base beer flavor probably could have overcome the other shortcomings, but the base beer also isn't incredible."
"A good beer, i betcha with 8 months to a year for the heat to smooth out, this will be sublime, if you get some, only drink one now for referance, and bust them open next spring or 2 falls from now, i expect great things."
"Bottle into Darkness tulip. Black with brown edges and a tiny brown cap that fades quickly to a collar. Smell is cheap bourbon, sweet oak, artificial fruit flavored candy, some dark roasted malts. Taste is much different, slightly brash oak flavor at first, vanilla, toasted oak, alcohol, bourbon, finishing with a hot burn. Mouthfeel is medium to thin with a medium carbonation. Overall not a terrible beer but certainly not worth $7 for a 12oz bottle. Definitley a bit hot and overcaronated, maybe this will get better with a little time."
"Overall - one of the best BA porters I've had. I LIKE!!!"
"While I've sampled a number of barrel aged stouts, this a first barrel aged porter for me. The difference was quite evident in a lighter body and mouthfeel than the stouts usually carry. The bourbon note was pronounced, but not overbearing. Some well-moderated sweetness in the malt, with a bit of brown sugar and some faint vanilla notes. Alchohol was very well integrated into the flavor profile."
"Overall: Nice beer just needs more backbone with a thicker body. It reminds me of a doppelbock and its dangerously drinkable. No much booziness considering it being 12%."
"SEEK THIS OUT, BUT GO EASY!"
"O: This was excellent and incredibly easy drinking. At no point, in taste or smell, was I aware of the 12% ABV. I would seek this out again. Excellent beer."
"Thanks to cetherid for the assist!"
"Overall, not really my thing, as I prefer barrel aging that is alot more subtle. However, for what this is, a big barrel dominated brew, it is pretty solid. I would drink this one again if it was available."
"The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for such a complex mix of flavors. Also, the the alcohol is not nearly as hot as you might expect for the high abv. Overall, I feel this rich mix of flavors would work better in a stout than this porter."
"O: very easy to drink. Gonna get a few bottles before I leave today. Well put together and would serve as an excellent example of the style. Or in another vein, a great introductory beer for a newcomer to the barrel aged style...very accessible"
"Overall - As far as barrel aged beers go, you can get much better then this. Strong whiskey flavor mixed into a porter really makes a fine beer. A total sipper at 12%, one and done for sure. A real treat and worth finding in a bottle."
"This beer drinks like an 8%-er. Nothing to complain about at all."
"O - This beer is better than average, but was highly disappointing given the high expectations I had on this. I wish I had not bought two bottles."
"O) It's currently one of my favorites that I have revisited multiple times. I have the cellar stocked with 20 of these gems, and will likely reduce that number in half by the time I have arbitrarily set as what I feel will be the next time I will revisit the ""aged"" version of this beer a year from now. My one main hope for perfection of this brew is to tame the oak flavors that seem to be a little overpowering to the Vanilla, which is the most pleasant flavor of this beer."
"This is drinkable considering the 12 percent ABV. The carbonation can be a bit jarring at first, but that's to be expected from a beer aged in bourbon barrels."
"I am very impressed with this offering. Expensive but good."
"Overall an outstanding beer. The richness and 12% abv really make this a sipper -- 12 ounces was plenty for me at a sitting."
"O: Really heavy on the barrel, but nice flavor and mouthfeel."
"D - Impressive, to say the least. Really hard to find any flaws in this one. Going to have to grab a couple more to cellar. I think a year might turn this into an outstanding beer. Recommend!"
"(12oz bottle courtesy of jcnd9803!!). Pours near balck with thin khaki head. Aroma has lots of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and some wood. Taste is semi-sweet-not as much as the nose-and it has some roasty bitterness. The flavors are complex with wood, vanilla, dark pit fruit and some coffee stealing the show. The bourbon is not as pronounced as I would have thought through the aroma. Medium bodied with a dry, woody finish. This is a really nice beer"
"EDIT- I just had the latest batch from late 2011 and it was just as good with a slightly better aroma, but the wax was much thicker and harder to remove. opening this beer was a bitch but it still one of my favorite barrel aged stouts. it is so smooth and drinkable you would never think it is 12%, simply one awesome brew."
"Medium body, with a great lighter carbonation, which works very well for this style. Alcohol is felt, but not at the expected level for the strength. The barrel aging added some wonderful character, without dominating. Seems pretty dry, but that may be the only thing I can say. Awesome beer here."
"Heavy bodied but also heavily carbonated. Somewhat sticky, each sip fizzles in your mouth then coats every inch. Less carbonation would have been preferred as experiencing more of the beginning flavors would make for a more enjoyable tasting."
"~Cheers~"
"Very nice, very complex brew. Nice bourbon flavor. Just a huge freakin beer! so much going on."
"It is enjoyable and something I would revisit. At $6 a 12oz bottle and 12% it is a sipper but overall a solid offering. I've got another couple bottles that will be interesting to taste down the road"
"M/D- Full-bodied and creamy. Tangy and sharp for the finish. The carbonation is light throughout, could be a bit more crisp for me. I think I may want a stronger roasted body. It may have a disconnect for me. Something more fluid and more velvet? I just find myself wanting somewhere. The flavor is off the hook, but the feeling just isn't up to par. Either way, good beer. Would gladly drink it again."
"All in all it met my expectations and I hope to pick up several more bottles for special occasions."
"A pretty impressive barrel aged beer. Not quite up to par with GI but impressive for a relatively small brewery. A little pricey per bottle, but easier to find then say KBS or BCBS. If this were thicker and a little less ""heat"" this would get a solid A."
"Thin light tan head on a completely black body. Beautiful aroma of bourbon, vanilla, oak, and some butterscotch. Almost too much going on in the taste for me to wrap my head around. Sweet, smooth, and very drinkable. Roasty and sweet, followed by bourbon and bitterness. I need to track down more bottles of this one ASAP."
"Drinkability - Just a hint of alcohol warmth on the way down, and even less in the flavor. This beer was just sent to me and I can't imagine what a year or two on it would do. It is already practically quaffable for how strong it is. I was hoping not to be let down by this, being a porter lover, and I was most definitely not. I would seek this out in the future for sure. This beer is just SO smooth...I just took a few minute break before posting this to let it warm up even more and my god does it keep getting better as it warms and with every sip. Fantastic."
"Overall- not too shabby of a porter. i feel it fits in the overpriced/ overhyped categories that seem to be about today. um...what happened to drinkability??"
"This pours a very dark brown with a small, thin khaki head that died away leaving just traces of lace. On the nose, the bourbon, vanilla, and oak are the big three notes, but underneath that is a backbone of roasted malt, some earthiness, and a big of booze. In the mouth, the bourbon takes up residence right on the mid part of the tongue and hangs around, well, forever. There is also a bit of toasted malt, and a big, oaky finish. The alcohol presence is pretty huge, but that's not something to complain about with a bourbon barrel beer. The feel is a slightly sticky medium body, not as thick as some of the bigger stouts that seem heavier on oats, coffee, and chocolate than this beer. Overall I wish this beer had just a bit of a bigger backbone as the bourbon flavors dominated the base beer pretty well, but the end result is pretty great and well worth seeking out."
"D- a pretty easy going sipper. take your time with this one, i could see it sneaking up on me if i drank it too quickly. this is something i would like to have another of."
"12 oz. wax dipped bottle. Served in a snifter. Poured a deep brown/black with a finger of tan head that quickly dissipates. Lots of whiskey in the aroma along with a little alcohol. Chocolate, vanilla in the flavor. Not as much Bourbon as the aroma would suggest. Long, lingering finish of chocolate and vanilla. Alcohol is pretty well hidden. Body is a little thin. Definitely a sipper. Good beer, plenty of complexity, not just a bunch of bourbon."
"If this is part of a new tone from Arcadia, I am buying in, a nice subtle porter, melded with bourbon. Arcadia, please make more bourbon barrel beers."
"The most striking part of the taste is that the bourbon barrel flavor is nearly perfect. The full, round bourbon, vanilla and wood notes are front and center, but without the heat that it usually takes to get those flavors to the fore. There is some bitter bakers chocolate and sweet molasses in a supporting role. I wish there was a bit more roast from the parent beer here, but this is as spot-on of a barrel aging process as you're going to find. You really get the full character of the barrel. Very well done."
"overall a fantastic beer that you really need to seek out. one of the best i have had in a long time. i would have to really, really recommend this one."
"D- I am totally blown away by this barrel aged butte. A nearly absent sense of alcohol surprises me delightfully with each sip. 12%? Is this a typo? No, no. I am definitely feeling this brew after a few sips. Seek it out!!"
"(D)- This really took on the bourbon barrel characters well. It rivals some imperial stouts in sweetness and richness; almost dessert-like."
"D - A great beer, possibly the best beer from Arcadia I've had."
"Excellent beer from Arcadia, definitely my favorite offering from them yet. Very tasty and easy to drink. The one piece that may be off putting to some is the heat. The heat is more warming and pleasant than hot and boozey. The ABV is hidden very well, could easily be mistaken for a beer a couple points lower. One worth seeking out if you want the opportunity. This is one I will grab a few more bottles of myself."
"D- Very drinkable, dangerously drinkable for sure."
"The beer is nice and medium to full bodied without being too heavy or too light. The carb is a touch high for me, but the mouthfeel and consequent drinkability score very well. Probably the first beer from Arcadia I've really enjoyed. I'm picking up a bunch for the cellar - maybe I can then celebrate my Birthday all year round!"
"Also, I am reminded that this is supposedly a Baltic Porter. Really? I would be expecting at least SOME smoke, and deep maltiness. Humph."
"D: For 12% this beer was quite drinkable and was enjoyable in its uniqueness. As a side note, Battle Creek has always had a special place in my heart."
"This beer was a pleasant surprise. I never knew it existed until a friend poured it into my snifter. Appearance is thin with no head. Smell is superb - bourbon, caramel, roasts, booze. Smell is bourbon and vanilla up front and nice brown ale roastiness in the finish. Overall this was a good beer. One I would definitely have again."
"This is a great after dinner, nightcap, winter-warmer type of beer. Though not my style, I wonder if this might be the right place for a cigar."
"12oz. capped and red waxed bottle generously shared by jedwards to round out the evening. Pours two shades shy of black with no head, just a soapy swirl and some residual suds. Nose expresses vanilla, coconut, butter and artificial sweetener on a medium-roasted malty backbone. Taste consistent with nose; however, the vanilla is much more prominent in the flavor profile than in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation. A decent beer, but the artificial sweetener present in the nose and taste are a bit too much for my liking."
"Nicely carbonated - very smooth - thick, but not sticky."
"This is drinkable considering the 12%. It is a bit sweeter than I would like, but it is ok. A valiant effort by Arcadia to make an elite beer, but they don't quite make it to the next tier with this one. I'll keep turning to their big brothers (Founders, Bells, Short's) when I want something truly exceptional."
"I had no, or low expectations for this and came away totally shocked. This is the best Arcadia beer out there and a must get. WOW."
"D-A sipper. I could have more than one in a sitting, but at $6 a 12oz bottle its not likely."
"Notes: brilliant porter! the barrel aging does kinda mask most of the other porter elements but is well received. just as barrel flavor as BCS but not as rich and slightly less flavorful"
"The mouthfeel is heavy but very smooth and enjoyable. The drinkability is good in terms of the size of this brawny baddy. One is easily consumed and loved up until the last swallow, but two would be a gratuitous waste. This brew is substantial and would easily serve as a dessert brew. Expectations are surpassed with ease. Well done, Arcadia."
"D - This could use some age. Tons of bourbon flavor that I would like to see mellow out in time."
"D: I would like several more but at 12 percent..."
