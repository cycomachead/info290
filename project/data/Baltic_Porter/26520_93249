4.44,2.8,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,"my brother has really been coming through with the goods lately, so thanks man for pulling this one off. its as good as all the others, again blows me away that its a lager, and although the coffee is light on the aroma, its taste and contribution to the mouthfeel are very prominent. matte black beer, heady and thick, inviting like a guinness really, lighter head, but similar vibe. the nose is mild on the coffee, way more barrel and lager yeast here, vanilla is as prominent as it was in the vanilla edition, not sure how they got all that from the barrel, but they did. in the flavor, the coffee is darkly roasted, earthy, and bitter enough without being harsh. its smooth and full bodied, and the booze is invisible. i definitely feel it after half a bottle though! stunning in its depth, awesome in its slick richness and dry finish, like no other in the feel. the coffee does add a little acidity, but its mild and actually helpful here. the barrel is more pronounced in the nose than the taste, but it definitely adds that sweet oak to an otherwise dry finish. expertly made, this is one of the best series in beer right now!","StonedTrippin","Dec 14, 2014"

Forms a smallish darker tan colored head that fades away fairly quickly leaving just a trace around the edge. Minimal lacing. Aroma is wonderfully potent: coffee, espresso, dark fruits, dark chocolate, and alcohol. Taste is also pleasant, but falls off a little. Again, there is coffee and dark chocolate along with a moderately sweet dark fruits and a rich maltiness. But the flavor seems somewhat thin, presumably from the alcohol. On the heavier side of medium. Lower carbonation. Mild bitterness. Overall, a very nice beer. Complex yet drinkable. A great complement to a chocolate-centric desert.","Florida9","Oct 25, 2014"

Breaddy and with some cold coffee to come forward. Silky and a bit of creaminess lend this beer a long lasting palate with not too much bitterness. A flourish  of alcohol dryness and bitterness from roast in the finish. This one is not as sweet as the vanilla after all and that gives it a more unique character as you drink. .

Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, coffee bean, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, coffee, and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of wood bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

Incredible nose - roasted coffee, bourbon, vanilla and toffee notes. Taste follows nose, but is not as rich and bold as anticipated. That said, everything coalesces together nicely without one aspect being too assertive. There's also a thread of milk chocolate that also weaves its way into the flavor profile and finishes with a robust, roasted coffee character. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a pleasant, even carbonation; however, the overall representation comes off a bit thin. One of my favorite styles, and this beer really holds its own. Not only one of the better Baltic Porters out there, but also one of the better coffee-based beers as well.","Jwale73","Mar 05, 2014"

Lots of coconut in the aroma, some roast and coffee, chocolate and malt, slight alcohol. Less coconut in the flavour, moderate bitterness with cocoa and malt, alcohol and chocolate, mild coffee and roast, balanced sweetness. Nice texture, creamy and smooth, moderate carbonation and full bodied, a little warmer than regular Framinghammer. Quite good, but the coconut in the aroma was turned up a little high in the balance.","DrJay","Feb 28, 2014"
