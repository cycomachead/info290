4.06,-4.9,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Very excited to try this beer - one of my original 'wants' from when I joined BA and I was fortunate to procure a bottle at the State Liquor Store in Stowe, VT on 12/24/14.  750ml caged and corked bottle served in a tulip.  Pours the color and clarity of cola with a loose, fizzy, quarter inch, khaki-colored head.  Head quickly dissipates into oily droplets and specks and strands of lacing. Nose is vinous and roasty with kiss of smoke, cocoa and booze.  Taste consistent with nose; however, you definitely get that lagered quality in the flavor profile (hard to describe what it is, but it's there).  There's a bit of a medicinal grapey quality that comes out towards the back and lingers between quaffs.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a carbonation just shy of lively, a light acidity and a residual burn at the back of the throat.  Overall, not my favorite Baltic Porter, but very much true to style.  Not something I would recommend for extended cellaring as I can see this oxidizing with time.","Jwale73","Dec 16, 2014"

Pitch brownish-black brew with next to no head, just a stippling of dark rusty brown bubbles against the sides of the glass. Intensely sweet nose of dark dried fruits (cherries, prunes), toffee, rum, licorice candy, and enough roasted malts melding with the sweet elements to evoke coffee liqueur. Wonderful stuff. The taste does not disappoint either, although be forewarned ... This is SWEET, like in Samichlaus Classic Bier territory. Flat, almost non-carbonated, and drinks like dessert, although there is a roasted licorice element that engages the palate after a while. Coffee toffee, black forest cake, and molasses with just the barest hint of smoke (at first). Apparently there's hops in here but I do not taste them. This is a challenging brew to rate ... One has to evaluate on the basis of the style guidelines and what the brewery is intending to execute here. Far too sweet on most nights for me, but sipped slowly and shared this is a sublime brew ... Earthy, rich, and fruity, with a slow building alcohol warmth like a high end rum and an emergent cigar-like smokiness.","CalgaryFMC","Sep 13, 2014"

4.41,3.3,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.25,"PBGC poured an opaque black..back lighting did nothing more than lighten the beer around the edges of the glass to a dark brown. The aroma was fabulous, a combination of chocolate, alcohol, dark ripe fruits and wet autumn leaves. Pouring produced just over 1"" of crema coloured, creamy head which lasted for 4-5 minutes before disappearing completely, leaving no lacing or spotting down the glass. It's flavour was as wonderful as the aroma, with sweet, dark malts, chocolate, and dark fruits, ending with a modest bitterness. As the beer warms, the alcohol aroma becomes more noticeable, and the already modestly bitter finish mellows further. A bittersweet aftertaste lingers, and though I'm not normally a fan of lingering aftertastes, it was a shame that I eventually had to brush my teeth before going to sleep. Trois Mousquetaires has the carbonation just right on this one, and PBGC is full bodied with the creamy mouthfeel of an oatmeal stout. One thing that struck me about the beer was the variability in taste...one mouthful the chocolate dominates, in the next the dark fruits are more pronounced, in another the malt sweetness is front and centre. PBGC is a complex beer, but not so complex that the individual aromas and tastes get lost. In summary, a wonderful beer...the only area in which it falls down is the ""value for money"" factor. At $9.95 a bottle, I'll have to put this beer in the ""special treat"" category. In a 750 ml bottle, PBGC is best shared...or at least stretched out over a long winter night.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Jun 14, 2014"

The taste is similar to the aroma, the brew tastes like roasted malt, milk and bittersweet chocolate, tart cherries, plums, smoke, molasses, wood, and a bit of coffee.

Smells of dark chocolate, roasted malt, pine nut/nutty, mocha and a lingering alcohol. On the palate there is coffee, a bittersweet chocolate presence, a woody presence almost like oak, a firm bitterness and a mild alcohol finish. Medium to thin mouthfeel that is quite pleasant, perfectly carbonated and as a result is very smooth. Great slow sipper, definitely a bottle to split. Good stuff here.","peensteen","Dec 24, 2010"

4.23,-0.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"As I drank it, I was reminded of why I chose this beer in the first place. The beer brought a party of classic flavors to my palate; it opens with creamy fudge-like espresso, very dry yet matly sweet the whole time, flowing with light spice, rummy alcohol which was tamed by a molasses sweetness, lots of roast across my cheeks, and a clean bitter finish. It was smooth and much lighter than I had expected from a beer of this stature; but all the flavors are so well balanced it makes perfect sense. The combination of coffee, chocolate, cream and a touch of black liquorice does make this beer among my favorite porters, and is a classic in my mind.","StephenRich","Aug 08, 2010"

ABV comes on a bit hot, slightly medicinal at first, but much better upon warming. Very interesting but not necessarily in a good way. I'm all for lots of flavor but not if the flavor isn't good. However...this one does get much better upon warming. More sweetness develops into almost an aged porter taste. Interesting.","KickbacksSteve","Apr 24, 2010"
