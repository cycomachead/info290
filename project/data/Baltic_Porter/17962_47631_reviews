"Overall: Very good, one of the better porters I have had.  Very easy to drink, nice flavor and mouthfell (4.5/5)"

"Very enjoyable."

"Overall, a very nice brew. I love the Baltic Porter style, and it can be hard to come by. Glad I had this one."

"This was pretty typical in terms of the strength of the booze but didn't pack a terribly strong punch. There was enough to like here but nothing major stood out from start to fnish. A bit less carbonation and more body would have made this stand out but as is, this was a Baltic Porter that most people should easily enjoy, once the novelties are overlooked."
"Overall: this is an interesting beer; it really does remind me more of a phenolic, hot dubbel than a Baltic porter. Unfortunately, it's just a little too hot and messy to be great."
""
"Update on 8-15-2013: Suffering from a sore throat and tonsillitis I decided to try a can of the Baltic Porter instead of licorice root tea. Not only did I feel better, but the next day my throat infection and pain was much better. Now I plan to keep a few cans of this around for medicinal purposes."
""
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass, developed a nice full head, tan in color. Appearance was dark brown to black with an aroma that held hints of malt and spice. Taste was of a pronounced malt and chocolates with hints of caramel and cpice. Mouthfeel was moderate with a tangy, licorace aftertaste."
""

"pours black with a giant cola head with big bubbles to match that quickly dissipate to leave a brown, actively fizzy right. No lacing. This carbonation is the number one reason that i usually hate porters (i don't really have a number two reason). However, that is the style, so i'm not sure what i expected. The nose is pretty nice, you can sense that there is going to be an alcohol burn not unlike that of a dark scotch ale-loch down comes to mind. Subtle to medium hops, toasted malts, vanilla, maybe a little coffee or its just a confusion of the toasty notes and the vanilla. either way, quite nice. Taste, goddamnit bubbles, fuck off, i'm trying to taste this beer. again, this is what i hate about porters, they're good but you have to TRY to taste them through a thick electric fence of abrasive carbonation. The taste follows the nose exactly and its very good. I suspect i might have scored this part higher if i could actually taste it more through the assault of the novelty children's drink this is bred with. Maybe thats just me, and this is just a porter for ya. So, i don't think i really even need to address mouthfeel at this point. I love all beer just for the sake of variety and when i want dark i typically stick to my stouts but every once in a while i just have to remind myself that porters aren't my thing... backtracking- definitely some coffee."

"Date on the can is 9/12 which is usually the canned date since it doesn't say best by. Tried not long after but can't help but think it's a bad batch or can but other offerings from this brewery have been just as bad. Just a heavy dirt and adjunct alcohol throughout."
""
"o: not a huge or terribly complex baltic, but nicely structured and well-designed, the additives give the aroma a little push but aren't noticeably integral to the success of this one"
""

"Very nice Baltic Porter. I'll definitely grab up a 4-pack."
""

"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark ruddy brown amber with a nice finger of light brown head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of chocolate, toasted mallt and a hint of cherry and anise. Flavor of light fruit esters, toasted malt, licorice and hint of chocolate and cherry. Finishes with an interesting wave of toasted malt and more fruit, leaving a long, pleasant and spicey aftertaste. Medium bodied with light creaminess. Not quite a traditional Baltic porter, but I found the uncharacteristically estery fruit component was very nicely balanced with the malt and spices. Pleasant and well done."
""
"The pour yields close to two fingers of active foam, plenty of larger bubbles and snap, crackle and pop across the whole surface, very dark brown color, given that fizziness not surprising head retention is average at best. The liquid is equally dark and opaque, stays more in the brown than black range, this supported by the orange aura around the outside, appears clean and unblemished, hard to discern any bubbles present. The nose loaded with roasted coffee, mocha and chocolate notes then moves from toast into sweeter caramel, licorice, banana bread and lower levels of peach, apricot fruit and orange zest, not that complex but highly pungent and lingering. Medium-bodied, creamy in texture with a fair degree of booziness to it, evokes something close to vanillin oak, coconut and butterscotch. Piles on the roasted chocolate, coffee and the licorice a major factor too, almost minty at times, pinch of nutmeg. The carbonation is on the low side and tends to accentuate that creaminess. After awhile, hard to really register much past the chocolate element, minimal cherry and peach fruit flavors as well as little hoppiness. If you like roast and can see past the booziness it’s easy enough to pound down."
""
"The taste was of a mild coffee and a musty chocolate combo followed by just a hint of earthy hops to balance it out. it is very clean and somewhat refreshing. medium mouthfeel with a head that sticks around for a while. enjoyable for sure. ill set a couple of these down for a year and see what happens."
""
"Fortunately, the beer has redeemed itself by the end. That nut character which appeared out of nowhere provided coherence and structure, and blended the flavours of the beer into a sensible whole. Without it, it would be a very different story."
"Overall, this is decent enough Baltic Porter. Then again, I'm a sucker for a Baltic Porter."
""
"A serviceable Baltic Porter, picked up fresh recent trip to PA. Pours a bit thick with a bittersweet chocolate scent. Above average mouthfeel. Very drinkable, a little bitter it could use more, a nice roasting. Nice drinkability, 473 ml can provides a good amount to be be shared by two."
""
"O: Seems a little off from the traditional Baltic Porter style, more of a combination of an American/English Porter and a Russian Imperial Stout. The alcohol is well hidden in the flavor though slightly present in the aroma. Not the easiest beer to drink but can be enjoyed by slowly sipping - also, the flavors are much more pronounced as the beer warms."
"O: This beer tastes like a hybrid between a classic English porter (given its lighter body and lack of bitterness) and a Russian Imperial Stout (with the flavors of licorice and roasted malts). Any traces of alcohol are well hidden from the taste. You really need to let his beer warm up in order to enjoy its aromas and flavors."
"O: Looks, smells and tastes great. If it weren't for the mouthfeel this would be an excellent instead of a very good beer."
""
""
"The can states that generous amounts of licorice and anise were used in the brewing process, but, I did not get strong notes of either. This is a minor criticism, however, as I enjoyed my first offering from this brewer very much."
"This is a pretty decent baltic porter. I know it has about a year on it, but the licorice is still fairly present and an added bonus. Solid baltic porter on all fronts. Tasty."
""
""
""
"Lol. A baltic porter in can?? Gotta be a first. This is a rare style to see in production. And this one certainly does it justice. It certainly is carrying all of the trademark characteristics I expect for the style. Profile is smooth and consistent. I like this one a lot. No, it doesn't really hold up perfectly against the many other examples of the style I have had, but it is definitely a well made interpretation. Not many American brewers can really touch this style, from what I have seen. (This is an exception.)"
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color with a khaki head. The nose is roasted malt, dark fruit, and some mild licorice. I get a bit of coffee, maybe a little bit of chocolate and grain sweetness. Light bitterness on the palate, presumably from the roasted malt. Licorice, burnt sugar, and dark fruits give some sweetness."
"An agreeable old-world porter, jazzed up with the proclaimed, and indeed actual (yay, truth in advertising!) licorice boost, which plays out in an even-handed manner, so much so that I don't even really notice it after a while, which is another feather in this offering's collective cap. Worthy of a try, if not more."
""
"Another can offering and it pours a dark jet kola hue which leaves a creamy three finger head that stays and some clingy lacing,the smell is star anise,liquorice,aniseed,dark plums and roast coffee,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice medium carbonation and has tastes of liquorice,dark bittersweet chocolate,roasted malts,dark fruits and finished with a dark coffee bittersweetness and overall its definately a step up from my last offering from these guys and yeah i like it as its definately easy to drink to drink while still having some substance to it cheers."
"reminds me of pop but the booze hitting my head reminds me that this is strong beer, a little over the top with the adjuncts but a respectable beer"
"Pours an opaque black with a 2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cookie dough, and some herbal/spice/licorice notes. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, cookie dough, and just a slight hint of the licorice/anise it was brewed with. There is a mild roasty and herbal bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some really solid aromas and flavors. Quite tasty and easy to drink."
""
""
"Poured from can into NB globe. Pours dark brownish black with light brown highlights at the edges. 1 finger of head upon pour, this settles to a thin covering and leaves a moderate amount of lacing. The nose features a ton of licorice and roast, notes of vanilla in the background along with a little bit of chocolate. There are earthy notes at the finish reminiscent of tobacco. The taste starts off with moderate sweetness which gives way to loads of licorice and anise along with tobacco and chocolate. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side for a baltic porter with mild carbonation. Overall, not a bad value.... a 4 pack of pint cans for 11 bucks, can't beat that. The beer doesn't stand out as being amazing, but it certainly offers some unique qualities."

"D - Very drinkable. Nice Baltic Porter with a good body and balance."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I would definitely drink it again."
"A little oily palate, but thinner than I expected for the style."
"Overall. I enjoyed the taste of Megadestroyer's big anise last night, but the smaller Uncommon anise is very enjoyable as well. I'm probably a bit biased with both of these though, I've always been an anise man."
""
""
""
"D/O: A nice brew... something I'd love to try on cask."
""
"16oz can, pours dark mahogany, near black with a ruby tinge while being poured and when held to the light. Thin tan head dissipates quickly and leaves little lacing on the glass. Aromas are roasted malt, smoke, and faint anise. The anise does fill the nose more as the ale warms. Tastes are complex with anise dominating the palate, but has roasty notes, char, smoke, dark fruit, blueberry perhaps, dark chocolate, and finishes with a sweeter black licorice on the back of the palate, reminiscent of a candy cigar. Mouth-feel is thick and chewy, creamy, and smooth - really nice and full. Overall, I did enjoy this for its uniqueness, but a whole pint of an ale that is too heavy on the anise gets to be overkill pretty quickly."
"Simply an amazing baltic...I love stumbling across a brew that blows me away in the genre. Looking forward to other offerings of theirs...sorry for lack of detail, but if you enjoy FFF Topless Wytch, you won't be disappointed. I would seek this one out and let it warm for a spell to appreciate the full flavor of this beer."
""
"Overall: I get the idea, but it loses a little in the long run. Great flavors, but they're muddled. Maybe I'll take the cans advice and snag another one and throw some age on it."
"O - an interesting take on a baltic porter. Not my favorite but certainly well made."
"O: We quite enjoyed this one. Big and assertive without being ""extreme"". Good times! Would like to try one a little closer to the canned on date to compare..."
"O: Not exactly the licorice bomb the can says it is, but tasty nonetheless."
"9 September 2012 EDIT: Can stamped 26 June 2012. This is much, much better. Bumping up the Overall from 3 to 4.0; too lazy to re-review."
""
"O. The alcohol I feel overtakes any of the complexity. It a bit to port wine-ish as a porter beer. It's not bad, but it lacks a certain something."
"Uncommon Brewers Baltic Porter pours to fairly standard appearance for a porter. The body of the beer is pitch black, with maybe a finger and a half of caramel foam sitting atop it. Head retention is definitely on the short side, and lacing is pretty much nonexistent. The nose is a blend of milk chocolate and black licorice, with the licorice probably standing out a little bit more. The flavor lets the base beer shine through some more, as coffee joins the milk chocolate from the nose. At the same time, the licorice fades a bit more into the background, which is just fine with me. The body is nice and full and chewy, and carbonation is just a touch dull, leading to a decent mouthfeel. I was a bit apprehensive about trying Uncommon Brewers Baltic Porter once I saw star anise and licorice mentioned on the can, but they manage to use it to add a nice subdued note to a solid porter. I’d definitely pick up some more if it were locally available."

"Canned on 5/14/2011 and still this carbonated GAWDamn!"
""
""
"Notes: An amazing creamy, drinkable beer that I will pick up again. Cheers."
"As a dissenting opinion, I find this tough to drink. I admit it's interesting and spicy, and the frothy mouthfeel is nice. However, the bitter, metallic finish is harsh. 16 oz cans from the Jug Shop in San Francisco."
""
"16oz. can served in my DT tulip. Pours one shade shy of black with a loose, half inch khaki-colored head that disperses towards the edges leaving a dollop of foam in the center before dissipating into a thin tight band. No lacing on this one. Nose expresses dark malts, anise and slightly vinous notes. Taste follows nose with the addition of a roasted character and the merest hint of cocoa; however, the flavors are somewhat watered down and there's a bit of wet cardboard happening as well. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a mild, even carbonation and a trace of acidity. Overall, not a bad example of the style, but a bit dull and lacking any bold flavors. Not something I need to revisit again, particularly at over $4.00 for a single."
"There are some flaws, but the aromas and flavors make this one enjoyable. Great use of anise."
"(Edit: as this warms, faint traces of the liquorice flavours develop)."
"O - My first from Uncommon, definitely makes me want to try another."
"The flavor is a full semi-sweet chocolate flavor. The aftertaste is chewy from the thick body and lots of cocoa. Predictable flavoring of cocoa and mild alcohol. The body is neutral with an average carbonation."
"M: Good until the heat wave arrived. After that, I was sold by the peppery heat. Uncommon indeed, I wish that I had a few more cans lying around."
"O/D-Overall, I was not impressed with the first beer I tried with this brewery. This one is much better. The feel stands out the most to me personally. Drinkability is pretty high. I got a single can of this for about $3.25 which is pricey. Definitely worth a try. This may make me try another beer from this brewery."
"Split a 16oz can with a friend. It poured dark brown with a light tan head. I liked the mix of roasted, cocoa barley and mild esters in the aroma. The flavor, however, gets a bit thin for the style and the fruit falls out with just the roast left. Something's off, maybe a little too much alcohol taste, or maybe it hasn't aged well. It's close to being a good beer, but isn't quite there."
"Overall very impressed actually, wasn't expecting much from a brewery I have barely heard of and from a can, but they did the malts very well without the burnt roasted flavor. Nice chocolate, black patent, light coffee vanilla and caramel, and light nutty, light hops, creamy smooth and drinkable with a light booze kick. Very nice."

"Not usually a big fan of anise and licorice forward beers but this one drinks fairly smoothly and I like it."
"Overall - very good. You've got to know a little bit about this particular style of beer to full appreciate it. Uncommon Brewers does this one well, perhaps well enough to be the best of their canned offerings so far. Well done."
"Notes: Nice canned offering, first try from Uncommon Brewers and while maybe not the Porter I would that eagerly pick up again I´d sure be glad some of the rest of their brews."
"Roasty malts, chicory, ashy, bakers chocolate. Lingering bitterness from the roasted malts, lending an impression of mild coffee and dark chocolate. This was surprisingly good, medium bodied and easily drinkable."
"16 oz can from ""Lifesource"" Salem. $2.95 Again ,as with the Siamese Twin, the pour is horrendous..a gentle pour ensures a glass 90% foam. Is there some sort of trouble with transportation or at canning..oh well heres another 10 minute wait to taste the stuff. OK after a long thirsty wait here goes. Typical baltic porter body..almost black yet with mahogany aspects on the edge. Actually a nice ,tight,creamy tan head..when its under control. Aroma is pleasing.. fresh ground coffee bean,cocoa nibs,,touch of aniseed, a faint aroma of medicinal liquorice. Very nice. Taste is the same as the aroma basically..with a little alcoholic warming and some blackcurrant. The mouthfeel is slightly over carbonated for style but OK and finally get some strong liquorice goodness. Over all a nice beer..but i dont know if i want to buy anything else from this brewer to drink with friends..as waiting for the froth monster to shrink isnt really my thing."
"Of the Uncommons I've tried, this is less interesting, but on the whole, it certainly has its merit."
"O - Not pasteurizing this brew makes it very nice and drinkable and adds a certain level of raw freshness that helps the ingredients come through. Above average for the style and nice flavor additions."
"I first had Uncommon Brewers Baltic Porter out of the can while poolside on a very hot sunny day and it was terrific. Later, I had one poured into a glass for the purposes of this review, and it wasn't quite as good. Context means so much; this is a great experience out of the can, when aroma and appearance don't matter so much, and a pretty good Baltic Porter from a glass."
"Pours deep, deep brown, basically black. Thinnish, tan, fizzy head that dissipates fairly quickly. Bounding with coffee and dark chocolate aromas, very roasty and malty. Smooth, dark chocolate flavor with good complexity. Earthy, roasty and malty. Fruity and quite sweet, almost cloying on the back end. The mouthfeel is rather watery."
"funny, still getting used to pouring black beer out of a can. a pretty good beer."
"Darkness fills the glass, lacing drapes the top. Smells of spice, licorice and anise with suggestions of vanilla and white peppercorn, plus a bonus of melon fruitiness. Creamy, smooth medium body. Roasty char goes right to a licorice root and anise that build and then stick to the palate. Dry charred graininess. Treacle or molasses sweetness in the middle. Fruitiness is vague, but rises up a bit with the mild heat from the alcohol. Burnt finish is semidry. A good twist on a traditional style; spice additions are at a perfect level to compliment rather than take over. Tallboy cans FTW!"
"I mostly liked this, with the fruit, roast, hops, and sweetness, all coming together to give this a relatively full flavored ripe and bitter feeling tanginess. The lightness of the body does hurt this a bit but the alcohol is well hid, which helps out in the long run. It’s not the best example of the style but it’s worth checking out if you run by a can."
"O: Pretty good. I'm not sure if I'd get it again, but it was worth the four-pack."
"The Crack & Glug produced one of the most intimidating beer that I have ever had come out of a CAN! It was dense and black with a finger of defiantly thick deep-brown head that seemed impervious to humidity or anything. It had the best staying power of any head I CAN remember. Color was a deep, dark brown/black with only cola highlights at the edges. Nose smelled like licorice, simply put. I was reminded of my mother's love of Twizzlers Nibs when I was a kid, but I had to be desperate to want to eat them as black licorice was not my bag as a kid. Nor is it today, but in terms of innovation, I have to give the brewers major props! Damn, this beer really made my taste buds sit up and take notice. I really could not get much more than the anise flavor from this beer, but that, coupled with its thick mouthfeel, was enough. The finish was like I had just chewed up a bag of black licorice. Phew! One was puh-lehn-tee, but what a one. No way is this going into any cooler but the one for Hula in the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually), when it will help to break the winter doldrums. Kudos for taking such a chance!"
"The legend woodychandler hooked me up with yet another canned beer. Poured from a 16 oz. can. Has a pitch black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some licorice. Taste is of roasted malts, some anise and licorice coming through. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality brew."
"A return to Santa Cruz and its Uncommon Brewers has come in reward with this Baltic Porter. Glad my spontaneous instinct got me into that bar in the first place."
"If you see it, get it. it's an adventure!"
"Overall. Decent baltic porter, Though I was not a fan of the bittering on the end. Overall an average style beer, unsure on price point as it was a gift."
"Pours dark brown with a nice maroon touch. No real haead. a bit flat but looks pretty. Smells great. Lots of dark fruits. Tastes sweet and full bodied. The malts are very complex. Overall super thick and rich for a blatic porter. Because of that I'm disappointed in it. More of a sweet/milk stout. But, very tasty!"
"Overall a fantastic Baltic Porter this is most likely my favorite Baltic Porter to date."
"This is a great winter warmer beer at 7.8%. But I also think it is refreshing enough to drink anytime. A very pleasing drink."
"This brewery always turns out interesting beers. Flavorful, to say the least, whether or not its to your liking is another matter."
"D-Would be curious to try it on tap. Don't care for it out of the can. Not a great representation of the style, and too many off flavors."
"Very easy to drink, and I had around three samples at the beer fest before they ran out of it."
"Notes: To me this beer is really dominated by alcohol presence which is both good (great bourbon and brandy qualities) and bad (very prevalent in the smell and dominant fusel alcohols in the finish). Definitely not my favorite though."
"D: This is a real nice beer from Uncommon, probably my favourite from them so far. Just a beer to enjoy and think about."
"Draught at The Red. Black with a small tan head. Sweet coffee and licorice aroma. Full bodied with a very silky texture and dark chocolate flavor. Lots of dark, rum soaked fruits, coffee, and a bitter finish. Very smooth, rich, and boozy in a good way. Great baltic porter."
"The taste is similar. It's very rich and strong and pungent, restrained just before becoming truly intense, with a lot of rich complexity, and very full-bodied, well-rounded, and very well-integrated. It has strong, fermented, caramelized fruit, dark dried figs, prunes, etc., fermented ginger bread with black-strap molasses and hints of bdark toast, rum, dark chocolate and coffee, all interplaying harmoniously. The feel is rich, oily and extremely silky and smooth, with a little liveliness nevertheless. It's hints at its alcohol and one can easily guess from the robustness, etc., that this is pretty high, but the alcohol itself is well-hidden. This is a wonderful strong porter, very rich and complex yet incredibly balanced and well-integrated. It's amazingly easy to drink despite its strength and robust flavour."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Pitch black with a cocoa colored head and slight red hues with backing light. Nose of roasted coffee with some cream and sugar. Some licorice and bourbon character as well, similar overall to coffee liqueur. Flavor is very similar to the aroma but there's a huge roasted character with moderate bitterness and nice dryness. Very interesting and tasty. A very good beer and another step in the right direction for Uncommon Brewers."
