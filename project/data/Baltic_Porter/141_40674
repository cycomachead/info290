4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, it had petty much all the aspects that I look for in a good Baltic Porter and it didn't have any off flavors and anything that didn't fit into the style and it made for a tasty Baltic Porter.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, slightly sticky, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think one would be the perfect amount for me, but I wouldn't rule out drinking two, but that would be my limit.  What I like the most about this beer was that it was a very true example of the style.  What I like the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad at all, but I thought it could have a little more head.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a Baltic Porter and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the style or dark beers in general.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it had all the things that I look for in the style and in the end it was just a tasty Baltic Porter.  It's one of the better Smuttynose beers I've had and it's one of the better Baltic Porters I've had.  Good job guys this was a good Baltic Porter, keep up the hard work.","StoutHunter","Mar 04, 2015"

4.2,-1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled in 1/2015. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, raisin, plum, fig, licorice, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, dark fruit, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, plum, fig, light licorice, light smoke/char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of roast/char bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, plum, fig, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Baltic porter. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt, earthy hops, and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 15, 2015"

The next couple of these I find are going to be laid down for a couple of years to see if that's what can turn this promise of a delicious brew into an actual one.

Pours thick. Aromas of roast coffee, bittersweet chocolate, a touch of smoke, and a hint of old world fruit sweetness. Flavors are rich and bold, with a solid dose of bitter dark chocolate and a rich sweetness of raisins and dates. The coffee character is there, but it takes a backseat to this one. There is a touch of heat from the increased ABV, but it helps to enhance and balance the flavor profiles. Very smooth in mouth, with a transition to a clean, dry finish. Very well made brew. Roasted and slightly boozey aftertaste, with a mocha twist. This is a great beer!","GarthDanielson","Apr 25, 2013"

4.3,0.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic baltic porter; I was pleasantly surprised. I have no good reason as to why I never drank this, but didn't realize it had such a good score until I came to type in my review. I thought it was supposed to just be an average porter but turned out to be one of the better baltic porters I've had. Looks great, has a near perfect mouthfeel, and has a ton going on in the taste. Not sure how much "aging" it helped as it is probably 1.5-2 years old at this point, but it's drinking near perfect. As normal, non-barrel aged baltic porter's go (still like Dark Knight and BBA Shipwreck the best), this might be the best one I've had....I like it more than the Ølfabrikken Porter. Would like to have it again.","mdfb79","Mar 27, 2012"

The beer pours a deep rich dark brownish black with a nice 2 finger mocha tan colored head with nice retention and lacing throughout. When held to the light the edges are a deep mahogany. The nose is a rich blend of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, with hints of vanilla. No alcohol detected. Smells great. Similarly the taste is dominated by the roasted barley and coffee flavors immediately. The chocolate, vanilla, and malty sweetness soon follows are present a full bodied and enjoyable beer. Mouthfeel is supreme, excellent creaminess. Again, no hint of alcohol whatsoever. Finishes with a mildly sweet, though not overly so, flavor with a mild bitterness of the tongue. Overall, to say this was a treat is an understatement. Best Baltic I've ever had. Highly recommended.","hopfacebrew","Mar 13, 2012"

The distinct soured milk flavor is actually rather welcome with the roast in this version of the style. I like this beer, I find it to be very good.

I think the brew tastes just like the aroma, but with the roasted malt, dark fruit and coffee flavors being the strongest. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's creamy and rich with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is amazing, it's very smooth and goes down quite easy. The 9% ABV isn't noticable at all in the aroma or taste, which also helps make this beer easy to drink.

The taste follows suit, with the brown sugar, now joined by molasses, and the pine standing out at first, with glimpses into the malts, toffee, and debutante figs coming into focus shortly thereafter. As Toto's "Africa" begins, I notice the body: nearing heavy, it has a good amount of carbonation, but it's just the right amount to "guide me toward salvation". Though somewhat chewy, the incredibly smooth finish (spiting the carbonation in a grand stroke of defiance) makes this brew one that "will take a lot to drag me away from".

A little bit of alchol lofts off the surface of the beer. The flavor is also rich and malty. Surprising amount of dark fruit comes through that compliments the bitter chocolate and licorice. Just the faintest sign of alcohol in the finish. The sweetness is a bit cloying as well. A wonderful mouthfeel that features the best carbonation for such a large beer. Soft and delicate carbonation compliments the rest of the beer perfectly. I doubt any beer in the BA Top 100 has a better mouthfeel.

It actually tastes pretty dry and it's really well balanced with some bitterness. There are flavors of licorice, wood resin, coffee and dark chocolate.

Full-bodied, sturdy and broad-shouldered, has a dense muscularity rather than just be "big" per se. The carbonation is made up of larger, slow bursting bubbles which fit the feel, no fine fizz or extra effervescence. Toasted malt, roasted coffee, butterscotch and cocoa, adroitly maneuvers between sweetness and dryness. Raisin, date, fig, plum, cherry and even some apricot fruit there for the taking.

Flavor also is quite lacking, just sort of your typical roasty stout character but very, very subdued. The mouth and body of the beer are that of a chewy imperial stout, super robust and viscous, but this also highlights how lacking the flavor is.

Very different, complex and definitely one of those you want to savor and sip. Tasted great, no matter the temperature (of the beer). The unique lager process was obvious in the smoothness of the beer, but the smoke taste was, after half a glass, a bit much. Enjoyable, but not as drinkable as I would have liked.

So well joined are the array of flavors including rich chocolate English toffee, anise, toasted sweet bread and a nice powdery spice profile. Joy is a beer such as this with complexity and balance. Alchol warms the belly but is otherwise well hidden. Mouthfeel is big, thick and richly welcome. Boldly drinkable. Goes to show why I continue to love this style more and more.","SPLITGRIN","Jun 13, 2008"
5,17.4,5,5,5,5,5,"Appears a pitch black hue, this one is like a black hole absorbs every bit of that visible light spectrum. Large dimpled thick tan head at least two fingers with a nice resiliency. Left behind are even thick scattered lacing strands with each sip. Aromatics are intense, upfront with dark roasted malt bringing together nearly burnt coffee roasts and dark bitter chocolate to the forefront. Luscious fruit from the vine ripened and soaked with fortifying amounts of alcohol, hints of berry, plum, and grape(raisins). Sultry charred wood characteristics with soft vanilla balance, a touch of sea breeze or saltiness reaches the nares as well. As the last amounts of yeast sediment find my pint glass I detect a toasted nuttiness and herbal mint quality. Flavors equally if not more so impressively mind blowing. Starts off big and sweet with malt and fruit characteristics plum and raisins namingly. After the sweetness descends along comes more burnt toffee and molasses like notes coming off rich and sugary yet fruity and complex as ever. Herbal bitterness is detected along the way but a dry bitter dark chocolate and coffee astringency definitely land a trademark on the overall flavor profile. A slow charred oak alcohol burn brings to mind the finest single malts aged to perfection, warming in your gut and tingles the throat and the sinuses. Anise and fruit notes flow seamlessly together bringing to mind old fashioned Italian cookies that go with black coffee. Mouthfeel is big and chewy coats the palate with pure girth. Loads of malt equal great texture and the yeast sediment in this bottle conditioned version really gives it some redeeming qualities. Drinkability is effortless despite the complexity and pure amount of body this beer has to offer. All aspects are a cohesive driving force in providing balance and smoothness in an intense usually abrasive style. When done right however like Heavyweight Perkuno's, Sinebrychoff, and Okocim this style provides pure bliss. Of course this year was hyped with this style, Victory brought the "hammer" back with their version of the style. As the widespread knowledge of that release occurred and people vied for a taste of it, this small adventurous brewer from New Hampshire decided to nail the style completely. So by chance this perfect version of the style was brewed and barely noticed while most beer folks lined up in anticipation for a taste of Perkuno's in Victory's version. This is Baltic Porter in all it's glory if you find a bottle snatch it up and sit on it, or drink it now that's up to you. Bottom line I need more Big Beers from Smuttynose, send them to the Burgh god knows we need some BIG A IPA, bring on the hops.","WVbeergeek","Jun 10, 2008"

Mind you, the abv is right up there where it belongs for the style but I still find it quite drinkable as the alcohol shows itself as just some warming after the swallow. It's pretty close to being full bodies and the carbonation, I'd say, is about medium. The finish has a nice bitter coffee finish that lasts for quite a while. I like sipping on this one and it will probably take me a while to finish the bottle.

4.46,4.7,5,4,4.5,5,4.5,"22 oz., bottle conditioned in 2008 and brewed with lager yeast. The beer pours quite black, topped with a three finger chocolatey brown head of medium froth that reduces to a small cap and leaves a few wisps of lace. It sits in the glass with a regal air, giving the impression of an imperial stout. In the nose there is a lager cleanliness, with lots of dark malts, a dash of leafy hops and some late anise. On the palate, there's a big blast of chocolate, roasted and black malts that lend an espresso astringency, along with some leafy/floral and oily hops that impart a mild bitterness. Eventually dark chocolate-covered raisins emerge, riding the warming (never hot) alcohol all the way down. On the palate it almost feels too thick to be a lager, silky smooth, with fine carbonation - again, reminiscent of an imperial stout. A great lager, and one of the meatiest I have ever come across; it starts very malty, but the hops gradually emerge. The flavor is so close to a five, but it falls just a tad near the end. Regardless, one sip just begs for another and this is definitely a beer to seek out.","mmmbeer","Apr 11, 2008"

The downside is this was a limited release so if you weren't able to score any of the bombers out there on the market you are out of luck. Unless maybe you can find a willing BA trader.

The first aroma I got was malty along with hints of molasses/raisins. The flavor is heavy on the malts, in a good way. There were also tastes of coffee and cocoa mixed in. You taste this and know it's a baltic. The mouthfeel was suprisingly sharp for a porter at first, but mellowed a bit throughout the glass.

Bitterness was balanced with the malt character. Quite nutty. Finishes with a bit of roasted bitterness. Creamy, full body with smooth carbonation.

If it's any higher than that, however, it's concealed well. Definitely drinkable, although not for those that aren't fans of the style. I could probably do two in one sitting after a well-digested meal.","sawbones420","Feb 18, 2008"
4.4,3.3,4,4,5,4,4,"Poured into my Spaten mug the brew is dark as ink and comes to a large coffee colored head . I am a big fan of the Smuttynose brewery .Coffee , chocolate and roasted malt flavor . Brown sugar , " mapley " flavor. After a few sips there is wonderful lacing and the Smuttynose Brewery has made another great beer . As for the ABV there is some redness to my cheeks which means by my account that is over 7% . Creamy and smooth . As with most of the " Big Beer Series " from Smutty this will be another that I will be more than happy to purchase . Total class from Smuttynose . Cheers .","Kudashov","Feb 17, 2008"

3.7,-13.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Flat black color with a light tan head. Aroma of roasted grain and baker's chocolate. More roasted malts and bittersweet chocolate in the flavor with the added character of a lager's rounded, firm, smoothness. No hot estery/ alcohol wildness here. Very nice - medium-full body with a nice dry, roasty finish. I used mine to polish off some sausages and whole grain mustard with onions, sauerkraut, pumpernickel and Appenzeller.","dedrinker","Feb 14, 2008"

4.03,-5.4,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 2" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head holds strong, with ample lacing. Aroma is rich dark grains, with hoppy touches. Taste follows along, dark roasty maltiness upfront, melded with some hops in the middle, and then back for some coffee bitterness at the close. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, with drinkability excellent for the style. Another great Big Beer.","ppoitras","Feb 13, 2008"

4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark cola brown/black with a light tan head of foam that rises steadily and leaves decent lacing. Aromas are all roasted malts, some cocoa powder, a bit of warm alcohol, and a faint medicinal resin hop. Taste is very chocolate/coffee/roast with a dry almost lactic hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium/thick which lends a good drinkability. Not too far off from an Okocim and that's saying a lot for this style","francisweizen","Feb 11, 2008"

4.52,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Drinkability: For around $5 or $6 a bomber, the Smuttynose Big Beer series is one I'm always into purchasing. For the most part I've yet to be even mildly disappointed and this brew is no different. This seems a style that a lot of breweries are trying, which is great, since you need some deviation from the RIS every once in a while. Certainly an awesome sipper for a cold evening, and one that I highly recommend.","asabreed","Feb 11, 2008"
4.5,5.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"An opaque dark brown color that you barely see through the pour. A full finger stiff tan colored head fades slowly to sheets of lacing, some 3D. The smell is an aggressive creamy Tootsie roll chocolate with a light roasted malt character. Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied, creamy and silky smooth with a slight tingle of alcohol on the tip of the tongue. Full flavored, the sweet chocolate taste is quite similar to the smell and complemented nicely by the feel. There is a lightly chewy milk chocolate after taste that lingers nicely. The Alcohol is integrated well, yet provides a subtle warmth on the way down. Way too easy to drink! Highly recommended.","jjayjaye","Feb 10, 2008"

4.3,0.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"overall, an experience. there's plenty to like her for the dark beer lover, though not a style for a weak palate. lots of nuance and discreet alcohol for such a bomb. try alongside something sweet and creamy, a mocha cheescake or a plain one with red fruit on top.. maybe even just the fruit with some chocolate (white!)","beerbutcher","Feb 09, 2008"
4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Great drinkability. Not too rough on the palate, but a sipper in my opinion. Overall a pretty good Baltic Porter from Smuttynose. Curious how this would be with a little age on it.","jaxon53","Feb 08, 2008"
4.2,-1.4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Finish is a little hot, which hurts the alcohol. Despite the apparent lack of hops it does not come off as cloyingly sweet.

It has a rich black and chocolate malt scent that warms even the nose. This is one intense beer. The taste is perfect. This one is black to the max. It's rich and smooth going down with bitter black malt flavor. It warms a bit in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is the best Baltic I've ever tried. It leaves nothing to be desired; a truely balls out beer. God Bless America!!! Cheers.","WesWes","Feb 06, 2008"

4,-6.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Have been looking forward to trying this for a while now. Pours a very deep black, with a lightly tanned head that lasts. Smell is big on roasty burnt coffee and bitter dark chocolate. Taste is along the same lines, with some fruit in the middle. Bottom line is that the bitter coffee takes center stage with this brew. Mouthfeel is somewhere in the realm between medium and heavy. I could probably put back more than one bomber. This is a fun style to visit from time to time, and Smuttynose has once again proved itself worthy of it. Not the best from their big beer series, but still remarkable.

Aroma is sweet almost a lactose sweet smell with some roasted grain, coffee and some faint raisin in there too. The taste hits you with a lot at once. First I got some hops then chocolate then coffee then some alcohol. Roasty bitterness in the end sits in your gullet just begging you to take another sip. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy.

Smells of chocolate, coffee, and a little rasin. Nothing too strong. Overall smell is really the only thing holding me back from giving this an A+. Taste is unreal. Creamy milk chocolate initially, with roasted malt as it goes down. Flavor stayed in my mouth for what seemed like forever. So smooth and delicious, I wish I had another.
