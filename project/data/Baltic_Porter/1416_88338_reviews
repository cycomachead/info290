"Pours a black color.  3/4 inch head of a tan color.  Great retention and great lacing.  Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, alcohol, hops, slight yeast, and a hint of tart.  Fits the style of a Baltic Porter.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, hops, hint of yeast, and slight tartness.  Overall, good appearance, average aroma and body, (but too much roasted malt and not enough tartness), and average feel."
"O- lots of raisin/fig sweetness mixed with big barrel notes. I have to wonder if this is an older keg, as the beers has a stake taste that I've experienced from BA beers that sit too long after bottling"
"Beatiuful, outstanding beer! I'm absolutely in love!"
"Its full body is lightened considerably by the ample carbonation to keep the ale creamy and aloft. Stern alcohol warmth amplifies the spiciness of the porter and highlights its oaky tannins and sultry bourbon caramels and vanillans."

"Flavor is leather, cocoa, toasted malt, butter, and a roasty, lightly bitter. Fairly boozy. That damn diacetyl comes back too prevalently."
"The taste is very good with semi-burnt sugar flavor and dark toasted grain with slight mineral aspect in the yeast with slight caramel taste mid palate and gentle woody accent adding to the complexity with a mostly dry finish in general. Easy to quaff overall I really enjoyed this take on the style with wonderfully tasty profile with not too much barrel character, yet 3 years has given this a smoothness and made it highly drinkable."

"Nice roasty malt, big oak,  hints of chocolate, subtle bitterness at finish.  Excellent for the price at TJ's."
""
"Look:almost jet black. smell: vanilla, chocolate, roasted malts. Taste: roasted coffee, light oak, semi sweet chocolate. Feel full body great carrbonation  smooth texture. Great trader Joe's beer this is great."

"Seemed to be a bit thin..."
""
""
""
"Pours a pitch black with a thick, frothy tan head. The nose is fantastic. Chocolate, roasted barley, nutmeg, anise, coffee, vanilla, toffee. The flavor pretty much follows the nose with an emphasis on the roasty notes. There is a good amount of sweetness present. The bitterness closes the show very elegantly.  I can't believe how full and creamy the mouthfeel is considering the abv is only 8%. This is truly an outstanding beer."
"This is an enjoyable beer but I expected a bit more barrel characteristics as supposedly it's 12 months in a barrel."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent beer with a near perfect blend of hops, residual sugar and alcohol content.  Complex yet highly drinkable. Perfect for sipping over a long time.  The alcohol content is high but not off the charts and nearly completely disguised.  It is  an imperial, but is not overwhelming.  A bit pricey, but worth it.  Get this one if you can find it."

"Overall: it's a great Baltic Porter. As I recall, this is probably only a few of the Baltic Porters I tried. I can't help but find a lot of similarities between this and black IPAs with the exception for the richness Sea Legs offer. Very tasty beer! And as far as I know, this beer is seasonal, not only brewed once as stated on this website."

"very oaky flavor, though not harsh. the mouthfeel is soft and airy. limited kilning astringency. hop flavor up front: woody and blackcurrant"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes:  It hides it's alcohol extremely well."

"Cheers"
"IMHO:  do not age this brew, it gains nothing and thins out after a year."
""
"Taste is dry roasty malt with itâ€™s sweet underpinnings. washes over the palate with a surprising milky sweetness. Strong bitter coffee, dry bittersweet chocolate, subtle vanilla and tempting bourbon. There is a wood so light on this that it seems to be  afloat, weightless on the beer. A slight warmth from alcohol as this one finishes crisp, dry, thinnish to the palate but with a medium mouthfeel and with some hop bitter to linger alongside all that smooth caramel."

"O- A good beer but I remember it being close to perfection on my first try. I guess my taste has changed or evolved."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this brew has some great qualities! Porters tend to be thin bodied but this one has a nice viscous feel. The whiskey barrel is subtle and well played. The vanilla and chocolate added worked out pretty well. Nice brew, glad i had the opportunity to try!"

"Pours dark black, light tan foam. Top layer. Creamy chocolate and vanilla nose. Coffee too. Smooth creamy layered taste. Very even. Modest, if any, bitter. Subtle bourbon taste at the close. Alcohol picks up steam. Light cream. Good."

"This seems to be what happens when you drop a porter into some American whiskey barrels - the base beer's robust (I'm assuming, here) attributes, while not exactly disappearing, still have to endure a large dose of the ol' thinning barrel treatment. Yeah, that's the flipside of the whiskey-cask aging coin - if the big caramel, vanilla, and oak woodiness don't honour their paychecks by doing their song and dance, we're left in a fix. Not a bad thing, per se, but a reduced one, all the same."
""
"Poured an almost black body with gushing head that dies quick with an aroma of roasted malts that have a hint of chocolate. The beer is smooth and a little oaky with the vanilla coming in real good and sweet, minimal bourbon notes and chocolate that are balanced with roasted (not smoked) malts and there is a slight slickness to the beer. ABV hidden and this is an easy sipper that hits the spot."
""
"Looks close to BBA when stout when poured with just a slight bit thinner texture. Nothing to amazing here with the smell. Same with the taste - seems like somthing is lacking. Very subtle hints of vanilla, almost no bourbon and barrel, some char and roast."
""
""
""
"Pours a very nice dark brown/black color, very nice carbonation, with a really awesome thick creamy two-finger plus light tan head, which leaves some very nice thick sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, slightly smokey/roasty notes, slight vanilla, chocolate, toffee. The taste is very nice as well, malty, slightly smokey/roasty with lots of dark stuff. Medium body. Overall a very nice brew, glad I finally got a chance to check it out."

"Overall a strong Milk Stout flavor wise. Pretty much a bittersweet ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a lightly foamy (3/10) and otherwise smooth (7/10) mouthfeel that is very soft and suitable for a higher ethanol-content beer, and within expectations for the style. Ethanol is generally well-hidden, with a subtle burn on the throat and light heat in the nostrils. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness clinging to the palate."
""
""
""
"This was nice, will stash some in the cellar and see how they develop."
""
""
"O-Was surprised to see this beer was 8%. Hides alcohol beautifully. Light carbonation round this beer. out. Even more delicious as it warms."
""
""
"I recommend it to any beer enthusiast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great sipping brew, but I can see how it is easy to just down it because the alcohol is so well-hidden. Loved every sip of this fine beer. Great for a cold February evening."

"`Overall, this is such a big beer I regret choosing it as the second beer for the evening. Big beer, big mouthfeel, damn."
""
"Overall- Good, solid beer. Doesn't deviate too much from a standard Baltic Porter. It should perhaps be a little sweeter but that aspect does begin to show itself and gives this beer a little more complexity. Worth a try but if the tap price is reflective of the bottle price, I could understand passing on it."
""
"O- Uinta has yet to disappoint...Sea Legs is a very enjoyable and highly drinkable offering. Extremely well-balanced with the flavors from the dark malts and oak barrel aging. At 8%, the alcohol is completely hidden. Although the first batch of Sea Legs (ca. 2012/2013) was aged in bourbon barrels, the 2013/2014 batch is aged in virgin wooden vessels. For those who are fans of Uinta's Oak Jacked (one my favorites, ever), I am certain you would like this. Despite the description on the label, I did not get any hints of smoke in either the aroma or flavor. Great stuff and highly recommended."

"O: A pretty interesting, complex, subtle beer that opens up a bit more with warming but doesn't have a signature flavor or aroma. It has a woody, oaky note that is pretty strong and adds a slight sourness and smokiness to the beer, but it works pretty well with the musty, molasses, understated dark malt quality. Definitely not a dull beer and probably merits revisiting after a year or two of aging."

"Solid stuff. I would've liked to try this one fresher, but it seemed to age alright. It's definitely a porter and will not be confused with a stout. Nice craftsmanship with this one."

"O/D-Quite enjoyable as a breakfast beer on a chillier morning. I would like a bit more of the wood barrel in the flavor. Overall, little to bitch about with this one."

"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, cookie dough, bourbon, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with bourbon, dark fruit, and cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty and woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a slightly better barrel aged presence in the smell."

"Uinta Crooked Line Sea Legs Baltic Porter. Wrong on pretty much all counts here. Barrel aged, yes. Added chocolate, no. Tasty beverage for sure. Never seen this one around. Cool."
"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/21/2012. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, vanilla, oak, bourbon, light coffee, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted and dark malt notes with moderate barrel presence; and good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, toast, caramel, toffee, cocoa, roasted malt, oak, clove, vanilla, bourbon, light coffee, and roasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, toast, toffee, cocoa, roasted malt, vanilla, oak, clove, bourbon, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark and roasted malt flavors with barrel presence; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, smooth, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged Baltic porter. All around nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark and roasted malt flavors with moderate barrel presence; and very smooth to sip on for 8%. A very enjoyable offering."

"D - Great barrel aged baltic porter. Good balance and mouthfeel."
"Overall â€“ A tasty and very easy drinking brew. There is almost no detectable alcohol taste even at 8 % abv. The nice roasted malt and drier finish of the brew make this one a quite delicious and a dangerous brew. Quite nice."
""
"o - exceptional beer. doesn't fall short of a baltic porter. slightly more roasty than i would have anticipated. however, doesn't bleed into the 'stout' realm, and is very enjoyable. rich with malt complexity. extremely enjoyable, and would definitely purchase again."

"Be careful as it pours a gargantuan head, easily fills half a pint glass with creamy dark brown foam, even mix of larger and denser tiny bubbles, fair amount of dimpling give how airy it is inside, better than average retention, same for the lacing, good thickness to the streaks and sticks well. The liquid is more black than brown, opaque enough to be a stout and with little hint of any orange or any true color. The nose has a natural feeling fullness to it but in no way heavy, the milk chocolate, cocoa powder and vanilla remains semi-sweet at most, Brazil nuts and cashews, some peaty smokiness but stays pure, keeps the toast on the down low, passing waft of flowers, any fruit scents stay muted, develops a sort of mineral water tang to keep the nostrils fresh. Medium-bodied, compact and polished, impeccable balance and completely devoid of ostentation. Chocolate, caramel, toffee and a hint of toasted coconut and scone, just the right amount of booziness from the wood. Again, has a peat, grass, earth side, here you get some cherry, apricot and peach fruit, more snap than sugar. Soft, refreshing and ultimately about as well-mannered as any guest youâ€™d invite to your table."

"O: Uinta's barrel aged beers tend to take the 'less is more' approach, and this one is no exception. A very subtle incorporation of the barrel means that the wood takes on a strictly complementary role. Nice balance and restraint displayed here, and the beer benefits from it."

"Another fabulous beer from Uinta in their Crooked Line series. Poured this one at a good temperature with an enormous, foamy, thick, creamy, fluffy, tan head that settles so slowly and good lacing. Color is a barely translucent black brown. Aroma is a nice blend of roast, malt, cocoa, old leather, a small amounts of coffee, dark ripe fruit, tree bark, earth. Body is excellent but carbonation is a bit soft. Finish is like flavor, slightly boozy, easy drinking."
""
""
"O: There is a good amount of complexity. Well balanced, no single flavor really dominates and quite smooth. An excellent sipping beer and the alcohol is well hidden - I could really see this one sneaking up on me."
"O: Thiss beer is very complex but is also very balanced in the sense that not one flavor stands out in particular. It is quite easy to drink and completely hides the alcohol."
""
"A fairly rich beer, one that wanted to be sipped."
""
"O: Impressed, this is a solidly put together brew. Exactly what I would want from a partially barrel-aged Baltic Porter. All the components of this beer are very unified."
"The taste is smooth as hell with more subtle coffee tones, plenty of malt upfront and a nice oak finish. The 8.7% isn't even noticable. The bottle date is 11/26/12 and is just a really solid brew."
"Flavor brings easy drinking roast with a good balance of sweetness. Vanilla is used with skill and restraint and you almost have to look for it to find it. Reminiscent of dark chocolate desserts at a bakery. Some alcohol heat stiffens the flavor up and mingles well with the roasted bitterness and vanilla sweetness. Finishes dry and clean."
""
""
"I was a bit disappointed by the beer. I expected a richer chocolate, and a smoother taste with vanilla. I switched glasses for a difference. The stein produced a smoother, more malty taste, but the pronounced tang remained."
"O: This is a very solid oak-aged baltic porter. Very imperial stout-like, even at 8%. Another too-often-overlooked beer from a more than solid lineup a la Uinta's crooked line"
""
"Overall I really like this porter, well rounded and flavorful, the cork was really hard to remove, but awesome taste I will have another"
""
"Overall: A decent sipper. I think I like it. I think?"
""
""
""
"overall: Another nice addition to the crooked line series."
"Overall mixed. It has some great parts, but also off points, maybe the yeast in the bottle went too far, but if it wasn't for that yeasty and dank wood esters out would be quite nice."
"O - Overall this was a solid beer with very nice roast qualities. Would like to see a bit more barrel come through but still a damn good beer from Crooked Line."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very drinkable and enjoyable porter. It's a nice mix of complexity and drinkability, a bit strong but also on the light side of mouthfeel. Worth trying."
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad porter but has more of a stout feel to it."
"The 7th beer I've tried in the Uinta Crooked Line series, and possibly the best."
""
""
""
"The body is medium with soft carbonation. Overall this is a good brew; would gladly try it again."
"This is full bodied with a fluffy mouthfeel. This is super delicious. The only way it could improve is by being rarer."
"A very well-made Baltic porter that melds well across the board of flavor, aroma, and feel. Very well-balanced, deeply complex, and goes down well while nipping at some Old Forester Signature bourbon. Yes, a nearly exceptional porter...hell, scratch that -- definitely an exceptional porter..."

"Really awesome aesthetics. Beautiful artwork of a sailor in some dark weather meeting a mermaid. Â "

"the newest in the wonderful crooked line series, and probably my favorite thing ive ever had from uinta. a oak aged Baltic porter, with all kinds of oaky and vanilla smells and flavors, but very little sweetness. its really malty and thick, less like a porter and more like a stout. the feel is amazing of this beer, not quite creamy, but definitely frothed, its light of its color and thickness, but isn't particularly carbonated. silky might be a better way to describe it. the malt flavor is crazy roasty, but without any bitterness, and the oak is fresh and clean, not charred and bourbon laced, but organic and fresh cut. the alcohol is invisible, and this to me is a sort of genre transcending brew, its absolutely fantastic. its a matted black color, mysterious and deep, and sitting in my globe next to the bottle it came from (with gorgeous artwork), with its milky foam head, its a sight to behold. as close to full marks as i usually go, this beer is just sensation, super complex, woody, and neither sweet or bitter. its a heck of a combination, and you should not let the price deter you. its magic, best beer ive had in awhile."
""
"A top notch Baltic Porter, another winner from the Crooked Stave line, this one drinks so easy, yet highly complex"
""
""
""
""
"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing opaque black in the glass. Fine one finger brown head with good retention and great lacing. Aroma of toasted malt, chocolate, vanilla and mild dark fruits. Flavor dominated by toasted malt, charred coffee and bitter chocolate with light vanilla, dark fruit and a hint of citrus. Finishes with charred malt and light hops. Medium bodied with pleasant creaminess. A really nice porter. Somewhat less light fruit / cherry flavor than I'm used to from Baltic porters, but not complaining, this is really well integrated and tasty. Another winner from Uinta's Crooked series."
""
"Dry chocolatey taste, toasted almonds and mild coffee notes. Pleasant and straightforward, the abv isn't too noticeable. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, almost like the consistency of hot chocolate. Medium bodied with a milky character. Overall an enjoyable beer."

"Very, very good beer. Delicious and well crafted with flavors that compliment and balance one another."
""
"750 ml caged and corked bottle, bottled on 12/04/12. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch and a half frothy tan head that stayed around for a very long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. The aroma is nice, it smells like dark fruit, roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, wood, vanilla, and some coffee. It tastes like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, coffee, burnt/charred malt, dark fruit, molasses and a bit of licorice. Nice balance between the sweet and bitter roasty flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and a bit creamy with good carbonation. I liked this brew a lot, I think I'll have to pick up another bottle soon. $11.99 a bottle."
""
""
""
"This is an interesting beer. It has most of the typical notes that one would expect from the style, but there is an intense citrus character throughout. I won't say I didn't like it, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Once I came around to the blend of coffee, citrus, and some burnt sugar notes all blended together, I really enjoyed this beer. It's worth checking out."
"12/18/2013 update: On tap at Tiger Tiger. Not so tasty as I remember. A hint of plastic. Woody."

"O-really good Baltic porter. It's a bit sweeter an maybe more artificial than a typical Baltic porter, but it's still amazing and I definitely recommend it!"
