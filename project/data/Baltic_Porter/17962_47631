This carbonation is the number one reason that i usually hate porters (i don't really have a number two reason). However, that is the style, so i'm not sure what i expected. The nose is pretty nice, you can sense that there is going to be an alcohol burn not unlike that of a dark scotch ale-loch down comes to mind. Subtle to medium hops, toasted malts, vanilla, maybe a little coffee or its just a confusion of the toasty notes and the vanilla. either way, quite nice. Taste, goddamnit bubbles, fuck off, i'm trying to taste this beer. again, this is what i hate about porters, they're good but you have to TRY to taste them through a thick electric fence of abrasive carbonation. The taste follows the nose exactly and its very good. I suspect i might have scored this part higher if i could actually taste it more through the assault of the novelty children's drink this is bred with. Maybe thats just me, and this is just a porter for ya. So, i don't think i really even need to address mouthfeel at this point. I love all beer just for the sake of variety and when i want dark i typically stick to my stouts but every once in a while i just have to remind myself that porters aren't my thing... backtracking- definitely some coffee.","Monalenard","May 07, 2013"

Aroma of chocolate, toasted mallt and a hint of cherry and anise. Flavor of light fruit esters, toasted malt, licorice and hint of chocolate and cherry. Finishes with an interesting wave of toasted malt and more fruit, leaving a long, pleasant and spicey aftertaste. Medium bodied with light creaminess. Not quite a traditional Baltic porter, but I found the uncharacteristically estery fruit component was very nicely balanced with the malt and spices.

The liquid is equally dark and opaque, stays more in the brown than black range, this supported by the orange aura around the outside, appears clean and unblemished, hard to discern any bubbles present. The nose loaded with roasted coffee, mocha and chocolate notes then moves from toast into sweeter caramel, licorice, banana bread and lower levels of peach, apricot fruit and orange zest, not that complex but highly pungent and lingering. Medium-bodied, creamy in texture with a fair degree of booziness to it, evokes something close to vanillin oak, coconut and butterscotch. Piles on the roasted chocolate, coffee and the licorice a major factor too, almost minty at times, pinch of nutmeg. The carbonation is on the low side and tends to accentuate that creaminess. After awhile, hard to really register much past the chocolate element, minimal cherry and peach fruit flavors as well as little hoppiness. If you like roast and can see past the booziness itâ€™s easy enough to pound down.","farrago","Jan 15, 2013"

Tastes are complex with anise dominating the palate, but has roasty notes, char, smoke, dark fruit, blueberry perhaps, dark chocolate, and finishes with a sweeter black licorice on the back of the palate, reminiscent of a candy cigar.

The body of the beer is pitch black, with maybe a finger and a half of caramel foam sitting atop it. Head retention is definitely on the short side, and lacing is pretty much nonexistent. The nose is a blend of milk chocolate and black licorice, with the licorice probably standing out a little bit more. The flavor lets the base beer shine through some more, as coffee joins the milk chocolate from the nose. At the same time, the licorice fades a bit more into the background, which is just fine with me. The body is nice and full and chewy, and carbonation is just a touch dull, leading to a decent mouthfeel. I was a bit apprehensive about trying Uncommon Brewers Baltic Porter once I saw star anise and licorice mentioned on the can, but they manage to use it to add a nice subdued note to a solid porter.

3.85,1.9,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"The flavor is a full semi-sweet chocolate flavor. The aftertaste is chewy from the thick body and lots of cocoa. Predictable flavoring of cocoa and mild alcohol. The body is neutral with an average carbonation.","smcolw","Jan 02, 2012"

3.93,4,4.5,4,3.5,5,4,"O/D-Overall, I was not impressed with the first beer I tried with this brewery. This one is much better. The feel stands out the most to me personally. Drinkability is pretty high. I got a single can of this for about $3.25 which is pricey. Definitely worth a try. This may make me try another beer from this brewery.","VelvetExtract","Dec 13, 2011"
3.4,-10.1,4,4,3,3,3.5,"Split a 16oz can with a friend. It poured dark brown with a light tan head. I liked the mix of roasted, cocoa barley and mild esters in the aroma. The flavor, however, gets a bit thin for the style and the fruit falls out with just the roast left. Something's off, maybe a little too much alcohol taste, or maybe it hasn't aged well. It's close to being a good beer, but isn't quite there.","tempest","Dec 11, 2011"
4.25,12.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall very impressed actually, wasn't expecting much from a brewery I have barely heard of and from a can, but they did the malts very well without the burnt roasted flavor. Nice chocolate, black patent, light coffee vanilla and caramel, and light nutty, light hops, creamy smooth and drinkable with a light booze kick. Very nice.","jlindros","Dec 02, 2011"

3.92,3.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Roasty malts, chicory, ashy, bakers chocolate. Lingering bitterness from the roasted malts, lending an impression of mild coffee and dark chocolate. This was surprisingly good, medium bodied and easily drinkable.","emerge077","Oct 07, 2011"
4.03,6.6,4.5,4,4,4,4,"16 oz can from ""Lifesource"" Salem. $2.95 Again ,as with the Siamese Twin, the pour is horrendous..a gentle pour ensures a glass 90% foam. Is there some sort of trouble with transportation or at canning..oh well heres another 10 minute wait to taste the stuff. OK after a long thirsty wait here goes. Typical baltic porter body..almost black yet with mahogany aspects on the edge. Actually a nice ,tight,creamy tan head..when its under control. Aroma is pleasing.. fresh ground coffee bean,cocoa nibs,,touch of aniseed, a faint aroma of medicinal liquorice. Very nice. Taste is the same as the aroma basically..with a little alcoholic warming and some blackcurrant. The mouthfeel is slightly over carbonated for style but OK and finally get some strong liquorice goodness. Over all a nice beer..but i dont know if i want to buy anything else from this brewer to drink with friends..as waiting for the froth monster to shrink isnt really my thing.","Reidrover","Oct 01, 2011"

Later, I had one poured into a glass for the purposes of this review, and it wasn't quite as good. Context means so much; this is a great experience out of the can, when aroma and appearance don't matter so much, and a pretty good Baltic Porter from a glass.","MetalHopHead6","Aug 14, 2011"
3.89,2.9,3.5,4.5,4,3,3.5,"Pours deep, deep brown, basically black. Thinnish, tan, fizzy head that dissipates fairly quickly. Bounding with coffee and dark chocolate aromas, very roasty and malty. Smooth, dark chocolate flavor with good complexity. Earthy, roasty and malty. Fruity and quite sweet, almost cloying on the back end. The mouthfeel is rather watery.","goldbot","Aug 12, 2011"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Darkness fills the glass, lacing drapes the top. Smells of spice, licorice and anise with suggestions of vanilla and white peppercorn, plus a bonus of melon fruitiness. Creamy, smooth medium body. Roasty char goes right to a licorice root and anise that build and then stick to the palate. Dry charred graininess. Treacle or molasses sweetness in the middle. Fruitiness is vague, but rises up a bit with the mild heat from the alcohol. Burnt finish is semidry. A good twist on a traditional style; spice additions are at a perfect level to compliment rather than take over. Tallboy cans FTW!","BeerAdvocate","Jul 28, 2011"
3.82,1.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"I mostly liked this, with the fruit, roast, hops, and sweetness, all coming together to give this a relatively full flavored ripe and bitter feeling tanginess. The lightness of the body does hurt this a bit but the alcohol is well hid, which helps out in the long run. Itâ€™s not the best example of the style but itâ€™s worth checking out if you run by a can.","Kegatron","Jul 25, 2011"

4.67,23.5,4.5,5,5,5,3.5,"The Crack & Glug produced one of the most intimidating beer that I have ever had come out of a CAN! It was dense and black with a finger of defiantly thick deep-brown head that seemed impervious to humidity or anything. It had the best staying power of any head I CAN remember. Color was a deep, dark brown/black with only cola highlights at the edges. Nose smelled like licorice, simply put. I was reminded of my mother's love of Twizzlers Nibs when I was a kid, but I had to be desperate to want to eat them as black licorice was not my bag as a kid. Nor is it today, but in terms of innovation, I have to give the brewers major props! Damn, this beer really made my taste buds sit up and take notice. I really could not get much more than the anise flavor from this beer, but that, coupled with its thick mouthfeel, was enough. The finish was like I had just chewed up a bag of black licorice. Phew! One was puh-lehn-tee, but what a one. No way is this going into any cooler but the one for Hula in the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually), when it will help to break the winter doldrums. Kudos for taking such a chance!","woodychandler","Jun 15, 2011"

2.76,-27,3,4.5,2,3,2,"Notes: To me this beer is really dominated by alcohol presence which is both good (great bourbon and brandy qualities) and bad (very prevalent in the smell and dominant fusel alcohols in the finish). Definitely not my favorite though.","4000qtrap","Jan 02, 2010"

4.85,28.3,4.5,4.5,5,5,5,"The taste is similar. It's very rich and strong and pungent, restrained just before becoming truly intense, with a lot of rich complexity, and very full-bodied, well-rounded, and very well-integrated. It has strong, fermented, caramelized fruit, dark dried figs, prunes, etc., fermented ginger bread with black-strap molasses and hints of bdark toast, rum, dark chocolate and coffee, all interplaying harmoniously. The feel is rich, oily and extremely silky and smooth, with a little liveliness nevertheless. It's hints at its alcohol and one can easily guess from the robustness, etc., that this is pretty high, but the alcohol itself is well-hidden. This is a wonderful strong porter, very rich and complex yet incredibly balanced and well-integrated. It's amazingly easy to drink despite its strength and robust flavour.","Offa","Apr 22, 2009"
4.2,11.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Pitch black with a cocoa colored head and slight red hues with backing light. Nose of roasted coffee with some cream and sugar. Some licorice and bourbon character as well, similar overall to coffee liqueur. Flavor is very similar to the aroma but there's a huge roasted character with moderate bitterness and nice dryness. Very interesting and tasty. A very good beer and another step in the right direction for Uncommon Brewers.","illidurit","Feb 06, 2009"
