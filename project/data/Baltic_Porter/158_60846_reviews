"I'm guessing I'll rate this fresh and give it a higher rating, but for the style and overall flavor profile, at this age, it's remarkably wonderful."

"3.54/5.00"

"O: A decent beer. Drinkable. Wonder if this one would be better fresh. When it gushed, I feared it might be infected, but I don't get that impression."
""
""
"Overall, a really nice rendition of something that usually doesn't work for me. I think the smoke and the sweetness helped make this enjoyable for me. I accidentally bought a second bottle of this and now I'm glad I did."
""
""
""

"O: not a very good beer. The flavors clash in unpleasant ways that make it difficult to drink."
"I like the feel of this beer which fit the style greatly."
""
""
""
"O: Nice. I would buy again, but I wouldn't order a second pint."
""
""
"Tasty, and certainly smoky. Quite sweet, with dark malt notes and a smoky character. Similar to a Schlenkerla brew, but less intense. As a lager it's similar to dark lagers from the Baltic region, though I don't reckon any of those involved Bamburg malt. A solid effort; the only weakness is the slightly subpar mouthfeel. Worth trying if you come across it."
""
"Overall: I don't know if this is what I get for aging this one a little, but it is only OK. I am not sure I would buy this one again with the intent to age. I need to seek this one out fresh or on tap."
"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours an dark red brown, small brown head with very light lacing. Smoke and prune juice aroma. Light smoke, light flavored dark malts and dark fruit. Finishes a bit dry. Subdued flavors. Tastes more like a lightly smoked English export stout to me. Adequate, no off-notes, but not a top tier smoked porter."
""
"This was absolutely wonderful. A real treat. I hope to find this one again."
"O: This is a very nice Baltic Porter, but the smoke could have been stronger, though."
"Great Divide's Smoked Baltic Porter is quite drinkable, but I would prefer it with a whole lot more smoke and intensity. These guys make some fantastic beers but this one is fairly mediocre."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice smokey porter with a nice overall balance of flavors. Good body and mouthfeel."
""

"Good Baltic porter, with a bit of smoke."
""

"Hmmm. I like smoked beers and I like Baltic porters, but this wasn't quite as good as I had hoped."
""

"Although an enjoyable beer from a great brewery, Smoked Baltic Porter left me somewhat disappointed in that it had neither the thick complex flavor of a great baltic porter nor the meaty, smokey flavors I had hoped for on reading the label."
"Bottled on August 6, 2010! Served from bottle into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Poured a deep ruby red brown with a half finger tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and smoke. The flavor was of sweet malt, smoke, roasted malt, subtle dark chocolate, and cream. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. The smokiness on this one really made this brew stand out from other Baltic Porters I have tasted in the past. This added a nice complex, but definitely covered up a lot of the nice flavors that makes the Baltic Porter great to me. Still a fairly well done brew that I wouldn’t mind having again in the future."
"O- Disappointed. This beer is exceedingly drinkable but not at all complex."
""

"The beer poured a very dark shade of brown, with a beige colored, two finger thick head. The smell was that of cocoa, coffee, and a hint of cinnamon, but sadly there was not much smoke smell. The taste confirmed that the smoked malt was all but drowned by the (very good) Baltic Porter flavors of chocolate, toffee, and roasted grains. There was a creamy finish with a touch of hops and some lactic acid sourness, and the aftertaste was somewhat spicy. As nice as it was, I kept wondering, ""where is the smoke?"""
"Overall - This is a solid Baltic Porter if that is your style. I prefer American Porters myself, but this is a good representation of the style. I probably won't buy it again, but that's just because I can get an American for the same price. Overall a good beer, nothing wrong with it. Certainly much better as it warms."
""
""
"O: Not a truly great beer, but an incredibly well-crafted one. A creamy-smooth, sweetish-dry Baltic Porter. Highly recommended. Will definitely buy another one if I see it."
""
"Overall I'm not wild about this one. Lacks complexity, just not that enjoyable. It's my first Baltic porter so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I'd pass on this again."
""
"I would actually like to see this beer done with more traditional lagering practices and to develop the aged fruit and sherry notes that would smoothen the rougher edges of smoke and char."
""

"Overall, pretty nice!"

"Poured from a bomber into a tumbler pint, the beer is a very dark brown coloring, with hazelnut highlights and a crystal clear look when held up to the light. There is a nice, fluffy, light, off-white head on the pour of about a half an inch, but that settles fairly quickly out into a sparse covering of foam. The aromas are rich and smooth, with a good smokey presence, some char and dark roasted coffee, meaty characteristics, and some dark chocolate highlights. Flavors are smooth and subtle, with some slick chocolate notes throughout. The dry body gives a sharpness to the smoke and char characteristics on the palate. There are also some very dark sweet fruit notes in the backbone, with some currant and plum present. The aftertaste is fairly nondescript, with some of the fruit and chocolate hinting around. The finish is slick and quick, with a slight drying feel to it. Decent brew, and light enough in body to drink in quantity. Would match up well with a hearty, rich, meaty meal."

"Overall – very good-tasting brew, and quite interesting to think about while tasting."
""
""
"Beer drinks much easier than anticipated. If you are looking for a good smoked beer, this may not be for you. However, this is a very well done porter that has some really good flavor."
""
"Deep dark porter with a nice tan head and light lacing. Very muted nose, disappointingly so with roast and not much else comic out. Some licorice and light smoke along with roast in the body. Mild lacing. A nice and subtle beer that IMO was hurt by sampling a stellar porter right before it."
""

"(153rd)"
""
""
"A very inviting beer. The smoke is strong but it's more of a dry smoke and not a meat smoke flavor. Nice smoked fruit in the aroma. Would be good to split the bomber w/ someone."
"Mouthfeel is okay, I might be way off base, but I felt it was a tad undercarbonated. A balanced beer. I can't decide if it's balanced because all the facets are mediocre or because they did a nice job putting the beer together."
"Dr: Quite drinkable for the ABV. I might have it again. Well executed for the style, but not without its flaws."
"Drinkability: Typically not a huge fan of smoked beers; they are more to my wife's taste. However, this one was a good mixed of smoke and roastiness that complemented the style well. Could stand to have another."

"I received a bottle as a gift, and I'm certainly heading for this during my next trip to the Good Beer store."
""
"Weird beer, this. Nothing about it is bad. Nothing is ungood, actually. But the best part is just a wee little wisp, which frustrates me."
"Light mouthfeel with good carbonation."
"Overall. A good porter with a nice amount smoke and little alcohol taste."
""
""
""
"Overall a drinkable porter, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Overall a fantastic Porter with just a slight touch of smoke, actually more in the aroma than the taste."
""
"Well balanced, a rewarding porter experience."
""
""
""
""
"Cost: $6.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle."
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty tasty beer. Everything is kind of on the moderate side, nothing’s too big, it’s not a smokebomb, etc. Maybe not super exciting but well made and well balanced and drinkable. Went very well with pastrami on marble rye!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another good beer from Great Divide, I'm just not a big fan of smoked beers."
""
"Overall a good version of this style but I would prefer the smoke to not be as strong."
"From the 650 ml. foiled capped bottle. Sampled on November 25, 2011. The pour is dark brown to black with brownish hues in the light, some clarity, and a small head. The aroma has an anticpated smoky malt sensation but there is something else that I cannot quite define. It may be the yeast but it makes me think of olive oil. The body is thin to medium. The taste is far superior to the aroma with a solid smoky maltiness and a lightly balance hop finish. Not bitter but not sweet. Somewhere in between. This was a likeable, drinkable beer."

"O: Hmmm – smoked Baltic porter. A little of the sweet side but the smokiness balances out nicely. Great Divide never disappoints."
""
""

"O. A style that's fairly new to me so I don't have much to compare it to. Strange to think of a porter as a lager, but that's what this is, and it works very well indeed. One more instance of how beer can be the world's most interesting and varied beverage."
"Taste actually shows a bit more sweetness than I anticipated and helps firm up the body a bit. Smoke is there a little bit, but as a smokehead I am disappointed. More smoke dammit! Malts have a fairly pleasant feel to them and are really neither overly roasty nor chocolaty. More of a honey-charred biscuit flavor. Its not too shabby, but its one of those beers where 1 bomber to try is enough to satisfy the curiosity. If it was in sixers for 8 or 9 bucks...yea, I would probably go there again; especially as a fan of the smoked porter style. Sometimes I dislike the bomber format, this beer is a prime example...21 bucks a sixer equivalent? No thanks."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good beer overall. It is very drinkable. That said, it subtly showcases the flavors that are so boldly printed on the label. I like this fact, but you may be disappointed if you are looking for these flavors to dominate. I wouldn't seek this one out, but I'm not going to toss it by any means."
"Happy Halloween....prepping for a cold night of trick or treating with the kids, so I am starting with the Great Divide Smoked Baltic Porter. It poured a deep rich dark opaque. The ecru head was nices and laced. The smell included smoke and earth/peat. The taste had mostly earth and peat with only subtle hints of smoke. The mouthfeel was good...decent carbonation and balance between flavor and ABV content. The body was medium so it makes for a great session beer. Overall it was quite a good beer and certainly congratulate GD on it."
"edit: this does really well with some age, i just had a bottle maybe five years old, and it holds up incredibly well, meaty and refined, i really like its mature status."
"smoke might not be the first thing that greets my 'buds but it's darn near close. a measured sweetness rushes the door, too. hops remain mostly out of the way. the lingering effect is somewhat strange. i struggle to discern if it is an effect of the smoke or if the malt bill or hops (or whatever) produce almost a cola aftertaste"
"Not a bad beer overall. I wavered in a couple of these ratings, so it probably is +/- a complete rating."
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, somewhat smooth on the tongue. This is alright, but I didn't find a ton of depth in the flavor, and I tend to go for a legit Rauchbier if I want something smoked."
"Great Divide Smoked Baltic Porter is a dark brown/black ale with a caramel brown head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is pretty much just smoke. It's a dark smell with perhaps a touch of peat. Medium bodied, it seems a little flat at the beginning, but there's sharp carbonation at the finish, which is a little watery and silty. Dark caramel malt, burnt sugar and smoke give it a sort of dusty flavor with a warm, almost sweet, center. It leaves a sort of burnt cardboard flavor in my mouth, which makes me thirsty. There are notes of black currant, leather, hay and grass. Yeah, this is a pretty manly beer. Twenty-two ounces will grow your stubble at least a millimeter. if it were any any smokier, it'd be out of control, but it ends up tasting like iron, leather, dark wood and smoldering embers. Seriously."
"This is certainly a smoky beer. In fact, the smoke is so dominant it almost makes it truly a smoked beer first, and a Baltic porter (a very distant) second. I actually genuinely love the smoke character, but I appreciate the style on which it is based as well."
"Taste-Roast coffee, woodsmoke. Bamberg smoked malt noticeable but not overpowering by any means. Tasty and tingly with a very dry black coffee finish. A nice match for grilled meats."
"Overall: Has a great body with good malt tones. The smoke flavor is just enough to balance this brew out. A great beer to have with cheeses. Cheers!"
"O: Not bad...solid example of the style. I'd have to say that I enjoyed this more than most rauchbiers...just always have a hard time getting past that pork aftertaste. If it were more char and less ""slow-cook", I'd probably dig it a bit more. But I found myself enjoying it after a few sips once I knew to expect it. Not Great Divide's best beer, but no worse than any other Smoked Porter I've had."
"O- Great Baltic porter, very smooth and I like the addition of the smokiness, This is the most impressive great divide beer I've had. Then again i'm a sucker for Porters. I can't wait to enjoy this again on a cold rainy night... or morning with a nice buttery thick whole wheat toast."
"O- Good porter here for sure. Fairly simple in flavor, but it works. The taste falls a little short of the nose, as this had a great smoky aroma, just not so much on the taste buds. The abv is not noticeable and this is very easy drinking."
"Overall: I liked this one. Only my second baltic porter but a beer I would like to have again."
"overall, my expectations may have affected my enjoyment of this beer. i've begun a bit of a love affair with smoked beers, and honestly, this beer just aint that smokey. it also aint that portery either. still drinkable and not too shabby."
"Bottle shared at the September iteration of the Santa Cruz tasting series. Pours a deep black-brown with a fluffy tan head. Aroma is smokey but not burnt or roasted. Black malts and meat in the nose and the taste, with the lack of roast and char once again emphasizing that this is firmly in the porter camp. No mistaking this one for a stout. Light and airy mouthfeel with a slightly mineral finish."
"Pours an opaque super dark brown with a 1 inch puffy tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Random patches of lace stick to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, roasted nuts, and some smoky aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, roasted in-shell peanuts, and some campfire smoke flavors. A mild smoky and roasty bitterness quickly fades from the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp carbonation level but a slightly thin, watery mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good smoked take on the style but the mouthfeel is a bit thin for my liking."
"O: Overall I really liked this beer and it was a style I would definitely try again. It was my first foray into a baltic/smoked porter and it was a positive experience."
"Note: BA has this beer listed at 6.20% abv however my bottle i believe said 7.5% abv. Maybe i had a newer batch than was previously submitted."
"O= a disappointment overall for me."
"Over all a solid beer and not many examples in the style but not my favorite."
"O: Smoke id definitely prominent. Good malt character is not masked. Moderate ABV makes it drinkable."
"The flavor is also hammish, but much sweeter than I would have guessed. The roast comes in late in the flavor, but it somewhat clashes with the hamminess. I'm having a hard time coming up with more flavors because of the overpowering hand of the smoke. This is interesting stuff, but it's not going to be that easy to finish the bottle and I feel like they could have balanced the smoke a lot better."
"O- very drinkable with a light smoke taste roasted malts"
"O - Always enjoy a nice smoked beer, especially when it's a porter. Worth a try if you see it on the shelf!"
"O: I liked this much better than Stone's Smoked Porter. Much bigger nose and taste. Definitely a good beer."
"This is great. Nothing is over powering, but everything is there in great balance. A hell of a Baltic Porter with just enough smoke for the non smoke head like me. Well done Great Divide, and something I would highly recommend."
"Pours a mostly black color (with dark brown around end edges) and an okay tan colored head which does leave a lacing. The smell is pretty good, a little smokey, some dark roasted malts, and some coffee. The feel is medium to light with a little carbonation. The taste is pretty good, I've never had a smoked beer before so I don't have a comparison to another, but I can definitely taste the smoked flavors reminds me of being next to a campfire, in addition to that I get some nice roasted malts and coffee flavors. Overall this is a pretty tasty beer and another good beer from Great Divide."
"Overall a a nice smoked porter, with a little more body would be a great smoked porter."
"Overall: No problem finishing the bomber, but will reach for the Yeti over this every day. Not quite smokey enough for my tastes."
"The mouthfeel's good. It doesn't feel overly thin that I'd expect from lagers and some porters. It does feel a bit more malty than usual. Overall, it's a decent beer, but I'd like to have more flavors being infused into this beer to balance out the smokiness."
"22 oz bomber poured into Sam Adams glass. Nice tightly bubbled two finger head, with nice lacing. Bready smoked malt aroma. Taste was a bit bland overall - seemed to lack punch and the ashy smoke addition detracts rather than adds to the flavor. Smoke hurts the mouthfeel as well. The back of my throat is feeling the way it gets after spending an evening around a smokey campfire. I've had other smoked porters which seemed much better balanced. This was a pretty pricey bomber at $8.99 and I spent the dough thinking I was going to see Yeti quality from Great Divide. This fell short for me."
"Overall it is a pretty good beer, but not great."
"Light to medium mouthfeel helps separate this from a stout. Not too bitter, not too sweet, this is a rock solid baltic porter."
"O: The beer is very easy for the style, especially since it has a relatively low alcohol content."
"A good beer, but not GD’s finest. A bit too heavy on the smoked aspects in my opinion to the point that I lose sight of the porter. More of a rauchbier/porter highbred with hints of chocolate than what I expected. I was thinking more of a traditional porter with focus on the charred malts."
"Black night in color, dark amber copper to the ligth.Creamy foam.1cm thick layer quickly dissipated.Slightly smoked character,noticed coffee & toasted grain notes on nose.Enters malty in flavor,light body.Foam tastes smoky.Intense cofffee on the aftertaste.Looks like an Schwarz,foam as a Brown Porter,Lager alike body,Rauchbier aroma.Ligthness make it very drinkable.Finally mistery has been revealed."
"Well done with a light and well integrated smoke that plays well with the bold coffee and cocoa ntoes. Background bread pudding and toffee show support. Hops are mild and yeast clean thanks to the lager strain. The biggest drawback is the thinnish body."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was an excellent smoked beer. The smoke was very evident and flavorful but yet still subtle enough to integrate into the beer flavors. The dark chocolate and vanilla really complimented it nicely too. Very taste beer overall and one of the better smoked beers I've had in a good while. I'm very surprised this one doesn't have better reviews, as far as smoked lagers go I can think of very few that I've had that were better."
"Great Divide’s large, hulking beers have been a constant companion on my beer drinking journey. The Yeti beers boxed me around the ears when I was a beer nebbish, and the Baltic Smoked Porter is my most recent reminder of the excellence in Great Divide’s big bottle beers. The Baltic Smoked Porter is a real treat - from the beginning it is a rich, well balanced and uniquely delicious beer sporting some strange but attractive flavors. It’s a predictably dark beer, midnight black in the glass, crowned with a thick pumpkin orange and tan top. From this curious cap vents a delicious aroma, thick with barbecue smoke, the unctuous aroma of ham, a bite of cumin and the sweet but vegetable sugary taste of Japanese pumpkin, or kabocha. This Baltic Smoked Porter practically plugs the nose with its aroma. A light but creamy beer unrolls onto the palate, soft but stong enough to deliver the flavors. A light to moderate smokiness forms the backbone of the porter’s flavor, accented with a touch of hops in the aftertaste, and a well balanced porter quality that, notably, is not beaten down by the smoke flavors. Smoked beers can often find themselves suffering from a surfeit of suffocating smoke and even a kind of palate smog, but the Baltic Smoked Porter doesn’t suffer any of that. It is an excellent beer for delivering the promise of porter flavors paired with a dimension of smokiness - an incredibly drinkable beer, and another notch in the successes Great Divide has accumulated in their bomber beers."
"Shrug. While not one of the better domestic porters I've had, I still thought this a pretty decent effort from Great Divide."
"The yeast character in this beer is strange. The aroma is off and the taste is not very interesting...there just isn't much going on with this beer. It is an OK, simple beer, slightly sweet with some roast and not much else."
"In general smoked beers aren't my favorites but this example changes my mind. The smokiness is the perfect counterpoint to the lightly sweet non-bitter dark malts. A very clean tasting dark lager I could easily drink more of (and I think will be the perfect accompaniment to the whole wheat spinach mushroom pizzas I'm about to have!)."
"This beer pours a light to medium in body dark, dark brown that turns to almost a black as it pools. It features a slight beige colored head that laces the glass. It initially smells of bacon but as it warms and the carbonation ceases it turns into more of a lunch meat esque ham. It eventually even picks up some light chocolate, in both sweet and bitter manners. It tastes of light, both sweet and bitter chocolate with a moderate amount of smoke and wood characteristics. It's pretty solid. It drinks somewhat light but is what should be expected for the style. Overall this is a pretty good smoked porter. I'm surprised it doesn't have better ratings. I'd recommend it."
"Black at the middle and lightens up to a dark reddish brown at the edges. The foamy tan head breaks apart slowly and unselfishly leaves a lot of its sticky self behind. An initial whiff brings to the nose some molasses, dark chocolate, cocoa and a very distant wood pit charred smokiness. Sweet and dark chocolates mix with dark fruits, black licorice, cocoa, more molasses and a huge hit of smokiness that envelops it all. Creamy in the middle, and a thinner than expected body leads to a straight medium mouth-feel. Has a woody edge on the throat, plenty of candy stickiness to the lips, and the alcohol is well-concealed. Good showing from one of my favorite breweries, but could use a bit more body to substantiate the complexities of aroma and taste."
"Pours almost black, there are red hues in the glass with a soapy, lofty tan colored head. It has a big campfire aroma consisting of mostly wood and smoke with just a hint of chocolate. The taste is very smooth and smoky with hints of coffee, wood and dark chocolate. This beer is medium bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation and a dry finish. I thought this was a great porter, one of the best I've had."
"O: Great Divide's Smoked Baltic Porter isn't a standout in any way. It's easily forgettable and not something I'd reach for again. Not a bad beer, it's simply jogging right down the middle of the mediocre highway."
"Overall this is an ok beer. It's nothing special and the smoke kills anything else going on here. If was classed as something besides a Baltic porter I would rate it higher. If it was cheaper and I was in the mood I would drink it again however at the price its not worth it."
"O: This beer has its faults, but upon completion I still felt satisfied which is saying something."
"O: This is a damn fine smoked porter. I never knew I'd warm up to smoked beers, but I seem to love them. This one is a bit muted in terms of the non-smoke aromas and flavors, but still a fine offering."
"While I'm not sure it would go well with a campfire itself, it is reminiscent of being there. A decent substitute if you're not able to make it out to the grounds."
"Overall, this ia good, drinkable, but not great or the pinnacle of this style. Somewhat lacking the complexity of a ""classic"" Baltic porter, such as Sinebrychoff."
"D: Definitely drinkable and tasty too, though aside from the smoked flavors, not a whole not going on."
"Overall I think this is a great beer. Good flavor and balance. Smoke isn't overwhelming like some smoked porters can be. I do think the price point is a little high for this beer. I recommend a try. But I don't see myself getting another one due to it being about $1-2 overpriced for what it is."
"Overall: this beer isn't necessarily bad, but it really doesn't appeal to me. It doesn't have the fruity complexity I love in a Baltic porter and it doesn't really seem to be getting anything out of the smoked malt, either."
"The body was a bit on the thin side of typical for the style. Drinkability was good, the beer went down smooth and easy, and I might have it again. Overall, a pretty average take on the style. Often I find that the smoke overpowers the taste of the beer, this is the rare occasion that I think the beer could have benefited from some more smoke. Worth a shot if you see it."
"Overall I think this is an okay Smoked/Baltic Porter, but I do think there are many better examples of this style out there. If you get the chance try it but don't spend a bunch on it."
"O: This beer is tasty. It would be a great beer for cooking a food pairing. However its not a sipper and not a session beer."
"(22oz bottle). Pours near black with thin khaki head. When held up to the light there is shows a nice ruby hue and active, but small carbonation bubbles. Aroma has caramel, savory smoke, and dark chocolate. Nice! Taste is a sweet dark chocolate backbone with some bitterness. Thin bodied with an oily texture. Smooth finish. Nice beer. I don’t know why I let this sit for so long."
"On-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Pours dark brown, almost black, with ruby highlights and a tan head. Some lacing. Smells roasty and with some light smokiness. Relatively light and smooth tasting, with about the same combo of light roastiness and smokiness found in the nose. I'd love to see more fruit here- it really doesn't seem reminiscent of a Baltic Porter at all, more like a somewhat weak rauchbier."
"O: Everything about the beer is good. Good aroma and flavor and easy drinking."
"O - It doesn't hit on all cylinders, but the smokiness is very nice and it's a tasty brew. I'm glad I got the chance to try it and would definitely have regularly."
"Not bad by any means but it's simplistic and wears on toward the end. It seems to become muddled as it warms up."
"A fine drinking porter but I don't really find it to be an excellent Baltic porter."
"O: Overall it's a nice Baltic porter. Not a huge beer, and the smoke is subtle after awhile. Solid, if not lacking a bit of complexity near the finish."
"Has cocoa and light smoke on the nose, medium body, taste reminds me of a smoky chocolate milk with heavy lactose presence. Lingering flavors of smoky malts and milky mouth coating."
"Label states ""this dark lager"" uses ""Bamberg smoked malt"". A fine addition as I like the Bamberg beers but I know porters are NOT lagers, they are ales. As the label says dark lager twice I suggest the name should be changed. It doesn't drink like a porter but is quite good as a dark lager (which it is). If it were labeled accurately, my scores would be higher for both mouthfeel and overall."
"Drinkability - great one to have fireside once temps warm up a bit."
"Expected more but it's still good."
"I don't think this has held up very well over 7 mos. despite proper storage conditions. Maybe it's better fresh and I'd probably have it rated higher if classified as a dark lager. But definitely not on par with the other Great Divide beers I've had."
"O:I was really looking forward to this one. But it tasted a little bit thin and wasnt really all that enjoyable. I prob wouldnt purchase again."
"O: I really like smoked beers and this one disappoints a little. A bigger grain bill would add to a better flavor profile and result in a more full bodied beer."
"Drinks very easy, smokeyness is well done, would've liked to try a bottle back in September or October to see just smokey this mamajama was. No Alaskan Smoked Porter, but a respectable, tasty stab at the style"
"7/10"
"Drinkability: Good drinkability for this beer. 22 oz is easy to do on your own. Very enjoyable, but nothing complex going on here."
"And where's the smoke?! Rookie level for both smoked beer and so-called porter. Good to knock back, but doesn't deserve to be called ""Baltic"". A beer with an identity crisis."
"I'm always excited to try new porters, and this one did not let me down."
"D- Overall, Great Divide Smoked Porter is a solid brew that is worth trying."
"A dark roasted malt backbone with hints of espresso, molasses and chocolate with a distinct and somewhat odd green olive flavor mixed in. Smoky and earthy in it's own way."
"Quite drinkable for a smoked baltic porter, and one of the better smoked beers I've had."
"A very nice smoked porter. Try it sometime!"
"The smell of this one was it's strong suit. The mouthfeel it's weakpoint. While I liked drinking it with my diner (steak) I don't think this a beer that I would buy again. If you like (light) smoked beers this one could be great for you."
"Right on the edge of being black-deep, dark brown color with a somewhat sizeable head. Ok aroma-mild smoke, some roasted and chocolate notes. I was expecting more smoke actually. Nice, mild smoke flavor. Lingering roated character. Distinct graininess. Body is rather thin. It really could use a boost here. Overall I find this quite drinkable. The flavors are nice and defined-the body could really use a kick as it comes off quite thin. Sure it does not fit the definition of a session beer but it is very drinkable and I could see making an evening of this."
"Realize that this beer is more of a lager. This is not thick as you may expect for a Baltic porter. The beer label states a dark lager. This is a perfect way to describe the beer and I don't think this should be considered a pure bred Baltic. The influences are there but this is in a category of its own. Nice job Great Divide."
"Great Divide has really ventured out and tried some new things over past year or two. I like the trailblazing spirit, but the results have been mixed. Smoked Baltic Porter is not one of Great Divide's finer moments. It's a little too smoky and ashy, the nose is weak, and the body's too light. It needs work all the way around. It might be worth a try, but that's about it. I wouldn't suggest picking up multiple bombers."
"Thin in feel. Overall, this doesn't wow me, but at the same time I am finding it very easy to drink. I like what GD has done here with the low-ish ABV - it was a lot easier to reach for this bomber knowing that it was in the low 6% range rather than a 9% monster of a porter. Increasingly, I'm looking for ""beers with flavor but not too high in ABV," and this bomber fits neatly in that category. I could see myself having another or two in the fridge."
"Very easy drinking, and light for the flavor punch it packs. Wicked tasty, smooth, balanced and complex. Really good beer. Worth a try."
"Mouth: Surprisingly light for the aroma & aesthetic. Chocolate & roasty. Some lacto type flavors. Mouthfeel is over carbonated and somewhat explosive in the mouth."
"I really like the low alcohol on this, it can seem to lack a little bit in the richness department (which would help the bit smoke character), but the quaffability more than makes up for this. This is quite nice and I definitely wouldn't mind spending a long session with a couple 22oz bottles of this brew. Somehow, despite my liking the quaffability of this beer, the body can seem a bit thin at times, but I seriously think this might just be my palate at the moment"
"OVERALL: Quite a tasty porter. The palate could be a little bigger for the style, but for a lighter version of a Baltic porter, this is a pretty good beer. One I'd gladly pick up again if I saw it. Another good one from Great Divide. Recommended."
"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, oatmeal, slight smoke, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of a Baltic Porter, barely. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Only the slightest acidity noticeable. Tastes of sweet malt, oatmeal, slight alcohol, slight smoke, hint of roasted malt, and a hint of acidity. Overall, the sweetness is strongly present, the smoke is more subtle, but there. It's the acidity that is lacking, especially for a Baltic Porter."
"D - Very easy drinking. The light smokiness on the finish and the clean dark chocolate flavors that imparted a slight bitter chocolate note made this quite enjoyable. Kept the glass and had the beer for roughly $7 at a bar/restaurant - and I believe the bomber is around $6.99-$8.99. A nice treat."
"Drinkability is good. This is a very solid porter with a nice twist with the smoked malts."
"D- Not outstanding but not offensive and a solid baltic porter"
"D: Pretty high, for a smoked beer. I might suggest this to those who aren't big on in-your-face smoked beers. As it was a gift, I can't comment on the value, but with Great Divide, I'm sure it's worth the price."
"Competent smoked porter. Smoke and roast aromas, nothing a coffee drinker would not experience. Black as night, with foamy off-white head. Mouthfeel is slick oily, average oevrall, actually expecting something thicker. Roast is balanced, nothing too complex here. Very decent drinkability."
"Conclusion: This is an interesting beer and is quite tasty. If I brewed it I would be pleased but not joyful. Take out the phenolic flavors and replace them with toasty malts and this would soar (in my opinion)."
"D - Easy enough to drink, but it isn't something I would seek out or try to obtain in any fashion. Not a bad beer, but many other things I would rather drink."
"D: fairly drinkable... nothing exciting, yet enjoyable."
"I was really excited to try this because I typically love GD stuff. The beer, though, was a bit of a let-down. Pours dark with little head. Nose is of simple roasted malts, with a bit of smoke to it. The smoke isn't ashy, which is a good thing (because bad smoked beers often taste ashy to me and it's just gross). Taste is ok, a mild porter with pretty mild smoke to it. Nothing too special. MF is a bit light, which makes for some easier drinking, but also combines with other underwhelming factors to make this beer a bit run-of-the-mill."
"It goes down easily because it's thin and has no strong flavors. Great Divide has a miss here, only made worse by the fact that they call it smoked. St. Bridget's was a much better beer. Why not bring that recipe back or just add smoked malt to that recipe and bring it back?"
"Future outlook: A bit thin and uninspired....not terrible, but not worth bothering with again."
"D - mild enough but good enough to have a few of."
"Notes: I expected much more from this beer. The nose was very promising, but the complexity was just not there in the taste. All other aspects of the beer are average at best."
"D - The smoke is very subtle but a nice addition. It works well this way but I would be interested to try it with more smoke to it. The flavor is very smooth and clean. Great and easy drinking."
"Mediocre beer from a great brewery. Waa waa."
"22 ounce bottle, bottled on September 9, 2010. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is smoked malt, roasted malt and chocolate. It's a nice aroma, but a bit weak. The brew tastes like smoke, coffee, roasted malt and some dark chocolate. The smoke flavor is noticable, but unfortunately it's not as strong as I expected it to be. Mouthfeel/body is medium, but it also seems thin at times. Moderate carbonation. Drinkability is OK, it's smooth and not hard to drink. Not a bad brew overall, I would try this again in the future. However, I was a bit disappointed because it wasn't quite smoky enough for me."
"D - Very enjoyable, this beer balanced its rich, sugary malt profile perfectly with the smoked malt character. The smoke is strong enough to leave no question that it is the major focus of the beer, but it never becomes overwhelming or excessively bacon like. This is a really nicely make and drinkable smoked porter."
"D: Not Bad, not great."
"Drinkability: While I certainly won't go out of my way to get this one again, I guess I wouldn't turn it down if offered; the style applied by the brewery doesn't fit it, and I would rather they called it something else so I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up, and it may have actually helped its scores. However, it's not too heavy and the flavors aren't bad, and the ABV is actually quite light, so it's easy enough to drink, just not especially desirable."
"Dark crimson/ruby body. Fluffy and airy light brown head. Lacing is pretty full. Nice blend of smoked malts and roasted malts on the nose. A little dose of chocolate as well. Chalky cocoa powder flavor to this beer. A little soapy. Not much depth or complexity. A Smoked Baltic Porter from Great Divide sounded like it had some great potential....great style, great brewery. But this one fell short of the mark. Merely average."
"Drinkability is ok for me. I would honestly never buy this again in the same setting (beer bar w/ 50 taps). But, I would happily enjoy this for free at a party or something."
"T: very happy that this doesn't taste like pure alcohol, like so many real Baltic porters do; this has ""smoked Bamburg malt," but if I tasted this blind I'd be hard-pressed to guess ""smoked"" - I might lean more towards a lean Stout; a touch of salinity; hint of sweet bourbon essence (as opposed to bourbon booziness); 6.2% abv.."
"d - A decent smoked porter. I enjoyed the vanilla in the taste and enjoyed the smell, but not sure how much of this I could drink; 4-5 oz. was plenty for me. Would try again but wouldn't tackle the bomber by myself."
"This doesn't quite drink like a baltic porter, which traditionally is going to be in the 8-9% ABV range, sweeter, and denser. It's quite a bit more light bodied, and something I'm not inclined to buy again, especially considering the $8.99 price tag."
"D. Its drinkable for sure. Pretty average well balanced beer. Not a mind blowing beer, but it is good."
"D- This was an excellent find. The only Great Divide beer that I had previously been familiar with was Yeti, and was excited to see this on the list while on the Mainland. Very good for a smoked porter. The smokey flavor wasn't overpowering and was offset nicely by the chocolate and vanilla flavors in the beer."
"Taste: Cocoa powder, bitter chocolate, smoke. Really disappointed it's not smokier."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a deep almost opaque black with a thin diminishing off white head. Aroma is a bit of smoke in front of dark malts. The taste is a nice amount of smokey dark malts with mild coffee and a hint of leather. The beer is on the light side of medium with mild carbonation. This is a great brew for a cool Autumn afternoon."
"Drinkability - This was mediocre at best and not at all what I've come to expect from this fantastic brewery."
"A respectable but somewhat uninspiring offering from a brewery I like."
"drinkability: a sessionable porter with smoke. bad description on beer, but a good one. love the nice smoke flvaor, perfect touch."
"Quite drinkable with lots of taste yet not overwhelming. Clean flavors without the raw grains that come through in some dark roasty brews. While not a standout, it's another reason I that Great Divide is one of my favorite brewers."
"The beer pours out a nice dark blackish color with lots of red coming through the edges and through shallow parts of the beer. The head is weak but has a nice grayish color. It subsides too quickly. In the nose smoke and roasted malt dominate. Slight lager-y aromas appear as well. The taste is similar in flavor but it has such a nice mouthfeel and drinkability. At 6.2% it is super drinkable and I highly recommend this beer as a smoked beer."
"Popped this bottle open for Thanksgiving. It pours a barely translucent dark ruby-brown topped by nearly a finger of wan ecru foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, charcoal, molasses, brown sugar, and wood. The taste elevates the roast and molasses to the forefront, while a healthy cloud of smoke follows in its wake, creating a lovely dichotomous flavor. The body is a straight medium, with a light carbonation and a light syrupy feel. Overall, a very nice smoked porter, with the smoke playing a properly supporting role."
"Drinkabilty - Its rather low alcohol for a baltic porter, but it needs some work. You can handle this 22oz in a sitting but honestly, i dont want this again. Stones smoked porter is far superior. Great divine has a decent beer that needs a little work"
"Poured a nearly coal-black with a wonderful head of off-white foam that left beautiful lacing. Smoky aroma with dark chocolate, toffee, and espresso notes. Smoky as advertised, but only a little bit of the other flavors you would expect in a Baltic porter, much less a smoked one. Light-medium body for the style, with some smoke in the aftertaste. Very crisp body allows for this beer to drink easily, and is very enjoyable- but since I'm rating for the advertised style, the grade may not reflect my appreciation for this delicious dark lager."
"Had on tap at Memphis taproom in Shaker. Very dark brown, almost black with small tan head. Nice mild roasted smoke aroma. Crisp, light to medium body with lots of carbonation but somehow manages to retain some smoothness. Taste is very nice with some malt, coffee, fruit, oat with a smokey finish. Not overpowering, refreshing. My companion had three of these in a short amount of time so I'd say it is quite drinkable. I looked at the tap list the next morning and noticed the keg had kicked."
"D - This is pretty easy drinking for a smoked beer. Again, nothing fabulous but it has good balance."
"This well crafted beer opens wonderfully dark porter that begins with a rush of beige head that slowly subsides leaving some thick, but splotchy, lacing. The nose is overwhelmed by intense wafts of cocoa powder; meanwhile, the hard working palate gets busy tearing through some sweet chocolate that kicks in with a malty finish. Wonderfully (did I use that word already) balanced smoothness makes for a deceptively sessional quaff. Loved this one. Excuse me while I go grab a cold shower."
"Cheers!"
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter. The pour is murky and muddy with a nice 2 finger white head. The aroma is smoked folgers, heavier on the smoke. The taste follows the nose, with the addition of some dark fruit. The lingering finish is bitter and smokey. IMO the beer is light for the style. A decent beer, the smokiness takes over, it loses most baltic porter characteristics."
"Drinkability: Not as big and bold as I would have expected from Great Divide, the beer is eminently drinkable nevertheless"
"Mildly staining. I'd say over-carbonated but it needs more definition to make a call on that. Consistency and texture won't be the reason I don't go back to this one."
"Taste finds smoke moderate, from beginning to end. Beyond that, starts sweet, goes lightly bitter at the close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is great. It's no Schlenkerla, but what is? Worth a try, for sure."
"overall it was decent, but a baltic porter is one of my favorite styles and it could have been done better."
"22oz. bottle served in a Blvd. Tank 7 tulip. Pours a deep brown/black with a finger of tan head. Smoke is fairly light in the aroma, also a little chocolate malt. Chocolate malt in the flavor. Medium to light bodied. Some smoke in the finish. Smoke comes out more in the aroma as it warms, but I thought the smoke was a little lacking."
"Couple fingers of light brown foam, most of which are big bubbles eager to pop their way into oblivion, very good stick to the lacing and more retention than expected once the head gets down to the surface. The liquid pushes into black territory with a very dark brown circle around the outer edges. The nose is almost entirely coffee and dark chocolate, however, neither is especially potent, whiffs of oatmeal, golden raisin to fig fruit, very light orange citrus but a more pronounced metallic ring to it. Medium-bodied, the smokiness here is not sweet, more like wood smoke, kindling ash and charcoal. Over time you get more coffee grinds, bitter dark chocolate, hard caramel candy but never sweetens much. The carbonation is round and full, at time fluffy, a bit more of a presence than desirable. The fig, raisin, apricot, apple fruit sit in the corner most of the time. Overall, it's dry but not finding many distinct hoppy flavors. Oatmeal, scone and some straw accents. Has a mineral water character to it, yet, not as metallic as suggested in the nose. Trails off during the finish, would likely be more noticeable were there more flavor intensity at the start."
"Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Good beer, but for me and it being a Baltic Porter, I felt the finish seems a little light and thin."
"Aroma is strong, smoky and oily with tones of roast coffee and anchovy - odd, but not repulsive. It pours a rich, opaque dark coffee brown with a fairly thick, though not too persistent, tan head. Flavor has tones of quality coffee, unsweet chocolate and malt with hints of licorice and miso and a faint fishy touch. Texture is smooth and quite fizzy, leaving behind a nice tingle."
"bomber from Bruisin'"
"D: Despite its flaws, this beer is still drinkable."
"D - Easy drinking, but not brutal enough to quench an 'Imperial' thirst."
"D - Smoked is not my favorite style. This one is pretty good to me, though."
"D - Drinkability is ok but I will echo the fact that I was disappointed with this beer."
"As always, I'm glad I got to try something I haven't had yet. I simply didn't care for it and I don't think Great Divide did a very good job on this one. I *know* they can do better."
"Anyhow, if you like mellow dark lagers, this may be good for you. If, on the other hand, you buy this thing thinking you're getting a smoked baltic porter, forget it. It's thin, light, smokeless and certainly porterless. It *is* dark, and the color is nice. But that's not really worth the cost of the bottle."
"Served dark brown with a small grey head. Lacing is decent. Sweet nose with some chocolate and a hint of roast. Smoke is more prevalent than I remember in the bottle, both in nose and flavor. Dark fruits are moderately pushy as well. Bacon is a major player here, while I barely noticed the smoke out of the bomber. Body is still pretty light, with the low abv helping out drinkability big time. Bitterness is well restrained, as is any lingering alcohol presence. Bottom line: the tap is a little more assertive, but this is still a low end porter, a nice sipper for afternoon or after dinner."
"Overall, there is nothing really that stands out to me about this beer. The smoke notes where quite lost to me. Not bad by any means, but nothing too interesting either."
"Lacks real depth of flavor, especially compared to the better examples of the style...decent but rather disappointing compared to the rich offerings I've otherwise sampled from Great Divide."
"Flavor is right where I thought it would be. Great Divide makes solid beers, so I expected this to be quality...and it is. Not exceptional, but very solid and a good drinking porter. Medium to light mouthfeel, decent carbonation, loads of coffee flavors throughout. The over roasted and burnt characteristics are a good thing...but could use just a bit more sweetness. Slightly above average...but glad I got to try none the less!"
"Pours a deep black color with hints of brown and ruby, with a small tan head and good lacing. Smells of smoke, charcoal, ash, and some dark fruit. Quite nice. Tastes of smoked meats with figs, plums, and maybe prunes. Rather good. Mouthfeel is very nice and smooth. Drinkability is nice as well."
"M- Low carbonation and nice and smooth."
"drinkability is good and i would buy this again if only they would make this brew in 12oz bottles"
"Finish is a decent mildly bitter black coffee."
"Drink: a juxtaposition -- this is a big, flavorful lager, but it's easy-drinking and crisp. Not super memorable, and as rauchbiers go, middle of the road. But I bet it would be good with a steak."
"Overall a nice smooth non-offensive smoked porter. Worth trying. A great smoked beer with balance."
"D: Good thing I like this flavor profile, but this certainly is not a Baltic porter. Drinks quite easy seeing as it barely tops 6%."
" D- This beer is a bit thin and the coffee malt really is the strongest flavor/aroma. The smoke is very light which is to bad because it is a nice hardwood, non-peat smoke that is very tasty. I don't think this beer has enough depth to age and there isn't any alcohol heat or big flavors that would settle with depth."
"Poured almost black with brown highlights that had a half finger of brown head and left a little bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma on this beer is really nice to me cause I like smokiness which it had but was not so overpowering alongside chocolate malts, slight toffe and cofffe but faint hops as well. Like the nose smoke character was definitely there but it was really tasty and well balanced by the malts and chocolate toffee accents. On the back end it did have a touch of hop notes that were very subtle but there; great flavor on this one. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a slight sweet, silky, but smokey finish. It drank really good and always enjoy a good smoke beer. I wish brewers made more of these smokey offering. Good job great divide."
"D: This is a great go to smoked brew. The smoke is not over powering, indicating a BBQ, but hold nicely during the aroma and off tastes."
"D: This is a beer that is more than the sum of it's parts, each of which is quite good on it's own. As a whole, though, it is a wonderful beer that I will hopefully be drinking a lot of this fall."
"To be fair, this was preceded by a Mikkeller Black and a good stogie. Thought it would go good with a New York Strip."
"The lighter aspects of this do however make it go down like water. If it was more available and substantially cheaper I could use this as my common drinker."
"Black with brown highlights, this is what I'd expect for this beer. There's a dense, light brown head with good retention and lacing. The nose really reminds me of Surly's Smoke. Smoky with a very clean and neutral (almost neutered, if you ask me) yeast profile, there's some caramel, toasted bread, and water coffee. The palate opens with mild coffee, a little smoke and light cocoa. While clean, the lack of yeast expression is rather disappointing. Again, this could just be my lack of experience with the style, but the Olfabrikken Porter doesn't make me feel this way, I could see this being described as lightly fruity and almost butterscotch-like. Light in body with mild carbonation, the finish is fry with some roast and a touch of fruit. Solid stuff, but not something I'd pay the asking price for ($7/22oz?). However, as a free pour at the brewpub, i did quite enjoy it."
"D: After the underwhelming showing of Hibernation, I'm glad another new beer to the Southland from Great Divide, the Smoked Baltic Porter was stellar. Not nearly as good as Alaskan Smoked Porter, but this is a damn good beer."
"Overall, a very pleasant beer, though not as robust as I would have liked. I am happy to have tried it, but will probably not seek it out again."
"Overall, not my type of smoked baltic porter. Just didn't have a lot going on with it. Good smoke flavor, but that's about it."
"A little on the tame side for a Baltic Porter. It was not very memorable, even though there were three of us sharing the bottle and commenting on it. The conversation just kinda went off topic from there."
"Average in every way."
"A decent drinkability for how heavy the beer is, creamy and a little sticky, little lingering smoke but finishes pretty clean."
"A super solid porter by GD. Nice to see, get, drink, and enjoy something new from GD. This Smoked Baltic Porter is a yummy drinkable treat that I'll definately get again."
"D: Overall, this is a decent Baltic Porter, although it won't be confused with a Rauchbier as it is not smokey enough."
"- Overall it's very tasty, but a bit thin, light, and not so robust."
"With the abv lower than 7%abv, I dont think this could be considered a Baltic Porter, but a great porter nevertheless. According to the bottle, this is a lager, but the style guidlines state this as an ale (with which I agree)."
"Pretty easy to knock back. Nothing too impressive. Just a decent baltic porter all around."
"Overall, a decent smoked porter."
"Appears a dark cola brown with a light beige head, fine speckled lacing forms. Aroma has a nice stong smoked malt character, hints of smoked meats and charred wood. Dark chocolate and roasted malts play nicely with a bit of dark fruit. Mellow dark chocolate malts and roasted hnt of coffee and ripened fruits noted. Smokey ballsy balanced smokiness. It works well, I will try to get some more of this stuff. Mouthfeel is easy going with the carbonatin and medium bodied, the smoke clears quite nicely from the palate. Drinkability wise this is a stand up version of two great styles kind of a hybrid Rauchbier/Baltic Porter. Definitely a nice brew, many rauchbier enthusiasts are going to want more smoke."
"D - Fairly easy to drink. Doubt that I would buy it again but wouldn't turn it down if it were offered."
"D: One of the easiest drinking smoked beers I've ever had."
"D: Good overall"
"I think this beer is a good take on its style, and the little smoked malt conceit is pulled off nicely. It's not my favorite Great Divide beer, but they set the bar pretty high so that's no great failure."
"Very easy to drink. The smoke does not get in the way of enjoying the glass."
"My struggle with this one is that they called it a Baltic porter and it doesn't stand up to most Baltic porters out there in terms of complexity and body. That said it's very drinkable (to be expected with the low ABV) and compared favorably to most smoked porters of the lighter variety."
"Overall this was a well done smoked porter and one of which I could drink a lot. Well worth a shot."
"I got this as a part of a mixed sixpack. I like Great Divide a lot but this was not among my favorite beers. It looked and smelled like a porter but there was not much in the way of taste. Perhaps it was also the fact that it was summer but it was not my favorite porter and certainly not my favorite of the Great Divide line."
"Drinkability: Man oh man, Great Divide is just churning out the new brews. Some might prefer something a skosh more bolder, bigger, but I'm digging the especially easy drinkability of this new offering."
"Pretty interesting but lacking in some Baltic Porter characteristics. Haven't really had many smoked beers to offer much comparison of that aspect."
"Pours an impenetrable black with a thin tan head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is really nice with a complex smokiness that is reminiscent of both smoked meat (like bacon) and wood smoke, along with some coffee and dark chocolate, molasses, burnt bread, some piney hops, a bit of dark fruit and alcohol. The flavor also starts off with an intense smokiness, with notes of bacon and smoked sausage along with alder wood and charcoal, some molasses, dark chocolate, coffee, plum and date, and a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is smooth and appropriately light (this is a lager after all), and drinkability is excellent. A very nice baltic porter, with a complex smoke flavor and restrained fruitiness)."
"Had this one on tap at the brewery, and although I doubt I will by a bottle, I may have to head up to Ratman's for a growler. Poured a nice black color, with a decent amount of almost white foam on top. The smoke doesn't overpower on this one, but it is certainly present, along with baker's chocolate and roasted malt."
"Bottled on August 6th 2010.Nice to see this brand new offering from GDB here in Greensboro so quickly.Poured into my Red Oak pint glass a deep chocolate brown with a one finger tan colored head that lasted quite long leaving a smattering of lace as it settled pretty slowly.Aromas are lighter on the smoke with much more molasses,chocolate, and roast.Flavors of sweet molasses,bitter chocolate,and dark roast coffee hit well from the onset,the smoke comes thru in a lingering finish.A little on the light side but its quite drinkable,subtle smoke,maybe not enough for me but its quite good."
"D: This is a nice Baltic. The smoked malts add a nice touch. My favorite of the two beers at the party."
"Flavor consists of some black plum, faint chocolate and distant smoke. The body is a bit thin which doesn't accentuate the flavors much. It lacks richness or depth or something. This is almost more like a dark, but light Rauchbier. I had this twice to make sure, and the body is thin. The feel isn't smooth, but it's not biting enough for the style methinks. The alcohol doesn't come into play and is a touch low for the style; according to BA. I'm glad I had this one first. If I had the Rumble first, this one would be overpowered."
