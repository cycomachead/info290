Aroma dark roasted malts, a hint of pumpkin spice, raisins/plums other ripened or dried dark fruits.  The spice is very minimal with pumpkin notes in the finish upfront dark chocolate, roasted malt character with a hint of coffee and dark fruit especially raisin notes.  Mouthfeel texture wise silky smooth even flowing carbonation medium to full bodied really nice light spice finish which doesn't linger, absolutely no alcohol burn at all very smooth.

Slow recession of the head as you drink. Aromas of coffee roast , earthy notes, and subtle pumpkin notes. Pretty subtle notes past the coffee. Flavors are a little more pumpkin heavy, with rich notes coming forward in front of coffee bitter and roast, as well as some cinnamon and nutmeg spicing. Bittersweet baker's chocolate notes are present throughout the palate, also. Pretty dynamic, and more flavorful than I was expecting. Tasty brew. Robust flavors on a mid-bodied, dry feel throughout, with a tangy, rich sweet and fairly rigidly bitter undertone all through the aftertaste.

It were a witches' brew, indeed, with a deep, murky brown color (SRM = 44 +) that burbled and popped until I came near its mess. The smell emanating from it was of Hell itself - roasting pumpkins, cinnamon, allspice, eye of newt and tail of frog ... Whoops! Satan got ahold of me briefly. Suddenly, that temptress whom I CANnot rid myself of memory, The Old Lady, appeared before mine eyes. ""Get thou back, thou reddish wench!"" I cried out. She merely smiled and beckoned me to take a draught from her chalice, somehow replacing mine own. It were as thick as baboon's blood and as spicy as her nether regions, from which I had partaken in oh, so many weak moments! I were naught but a fallen minister and she straddled atop my mouth, pouring the CANtents of CAN after CAN into mine orifice. I cried for help but none was forthcoming. The light and love that suddenly appeared from the glass demanded that I look not directly upon it. I wept whilst The Old Lady laughed but she poured yon luscious beverage into mine gaping orifice and soon we were alone.

Relaxed body with palming weight, but not tension. Gives up slowly, but surely, in the mouth with a pleasant release of gases. The body of the beer is exceptional and really plants on the taste receptors. Spices are overmatched with a great malt base. Aged hops bring forth some young pine and a twist of orange peel.

3.9,4.6,3.5,4,4,3.75,3.75,"Dark brown with some light passing through the edges. Thinning tan head. Nice aroma with a bit going on: milk chocolate, nutmeg, touch of smoke. Am I actually smelling pumpkin, our is that just malt sweetness? Taste is more intense than expected with plenty of bitterness throughout. Chocolate becomes darker in the flavor, and anise pops up. Pumpkin is subtle on the tongue initially and in the finish, and I prefer not being knocked over the head with it. Sweet cinnamon, mmm. Just enough to leo you drinking this heart brew. A nice one to run into--try it.","qchic","Oct 27, 2013"

Nice creamy sugar cookie aromas,dark berries and slight alcohol. Nice Taste is the same as the aroma but with pumpkin showing..salty pumpkin with some cinnamon. Nice mouth feel smooth and silky. I like Baltic Porters and this is OK..sadly would have been better without the pumpkin IMO","Reidrover","Oct 26, 2013"

Overall this is interesting and worth trying...I like the concept more than the actual beer but if you like spiced beers or strong porters it is more enjoyable than most.","Slatetank","Oct 26, 2013"

This beer is sold in 4 packs of cans. Two cans are this beer and the other two are a Belgium style ale with pumpkin spice. Both are phenomenal and if you are into pumpkin beers, you must try these.","HSGB1316","Oct 22, 2013"

3.75,0.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"D - This one is certainly more Baltic Porter than Pumpkin Ale... Similar to it's Tripel counterpart the pumpkin plays a subdued second back seat... This is still a respectable, but unremarkable offering... There's nothing wrong with it by any means, but it certainly isn't an autumnal seasonal that I need to seek out each year...","philbe311","Oct 19, 2013"

The brew smells like chocolate, cinnamon, pumpkin spices, dark bread and caraway. It tastes like cinnamon, caraway, chocolate, pumpkin, nutmeg, roasted malt and a bit of licorice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating with a moderate amount of carbonation. I liked this brew, definitely worth a try. $8.99 a 4-pack (2 cans of the He Said Baltic Porter, 2 cans of the He Said Tripel).","bluejacket74","Oct 11, 2013"
