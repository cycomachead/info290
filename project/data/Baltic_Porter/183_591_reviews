"Pours out dark with an oily skin of a head. Dried fruit aroma , hint of molasses. Taste is on the sweet side, fruit, sugar. Taste dissipated quickly, overall mouthful is slightly watery."
"One of the most interesting beers I've ever had.  Can't say I enjoyed it too much, but it was a dark porter that was SWEET.  I could definitely taste a perfumey, fruity sweetness with every sip.  It's almost like licorice.  It was a taste I've never had before, but after a while, it started to get to me.  The unique flavor threw me off, and I was unsure if I wanted more."

"O: The price discourages regular purchases, but besides that point this beer is very good. Not a must-buy, since there are cheaper beers that I'd argue do it better, but it's well worth a shot."

"Overall a good beer. It's not something I would seek out, but still worth trying."
"Would I buy this beer again? Probably."

"Pretty nice drinkin' here. Seems more like a Belgian Dark Ale than a Porter, but who's counting?"

"O: A bit underwhelming, but the bottle makes up for it."

"O - Not what you would expect from a porter. The Belgian yeast makes for a surprising palate."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, dark fruits, and some cocoa aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but the mouthfeel needs improvement in my opinion."

"Review from 2/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a dark red brown amber with a vigorous off white head leaving nice lacing. Malt aroma with a bit of a sour, mineral component. Tastes of light sweet malt and light and dark fruits with Belgian spicing. Thin bodied, and sweeter and lighter than most porters. Nice strong carbonation is refreshing. A pleasant Belgian take on a porter, but not outstanding."
"O - Overall not too bad, not what I was expecting for a Baltic Porter, but it's still a good brew, I thought the bottle looked cool and the beer behind it justified my purchase"
""
"I'd still call it a Belgian Dark Ale instead of a porter. Soft flavors, not much of the really dark roast and certainly none of the charred malt we usually find in porters and stouts. The big ceramic bottle from Mega Liquor in Hemet, Calif."
""
"Overall, maybe not worth the price, but still a very very very good porter to try even if you don't like most porters are this one is much lighter and thinner than most porters you see. Give it a try even if you like pale ales."

"Overall pretty average, which means not good since the quality of beer these days seems to be quite good and improving."
"D: Not very porter like but a decent tasting beer overall. The aroma and taste match up very well without much difference between the two."
"D - Very brown and bready, not really what I think if when I think porter. Drinkable, but the bottle is more attractive than the beer inside."
"Overall, a good beer, but if I didn't see this listed as a Baltic Porter, I'd just have called it a normal ""Belgian Dark Ale""."
"Summary - This ""Poorter"" is pretty nice. For the price, however, I would expect a better brew. Personally, I prefer Fuller's London Porter, which is a little heavier. I do love the bottle though."
"O. If you want to lay down close to $10 for a very drinkable but quite average brew that comes in a useful bottle (if you're a homebrewer), be my guest. I'll probably buy it again but only if it's on sale."
"Not bad."
"O: Smelled quite nice and tasted pretty good as well. Not a bad beer."
"Aroma is smoky and chocolaty with yeast and caramel hints. It pours a dark chocolate brown that is opaque save at the edges and has a very thick, if not persistent, tan head - the sample I got fizzed like nobodyâ€™s business. Oh noes, wasted beer! Satisfying flavor is malty with smoky, chocolate and nutty tones and just a touch of caramel. Texture is quite fizzy, leaving behind a rather persistent tingle."
"D - easily drinkable, but there are many better options out there."
"the hoogstraten poorter pours a dark brown a the glass with a creamy white froth. Amazing aromas of black cherries, black raspberries, cassis, caramel, belgian waffle, roasted nuts, some baking spices, and belgian yeast that follows through on the palate. The beer has a medium light body, creamy carbonation, & long finish. There is a definite sweetness to this beer, however the beer dries the palate on the finish (not bitter, just dry). Overall, I really liked this beer & would love to drink it again, but, unfortunately, this beer is way over valued at $10 a bottle. Because of the cost, this beer is Not Recommended....unless you have a ton of extra cash burning a hole in your pocket."
"Overall, this beer is reasonable to drink but has several aspects that could make it very good. Not hard to drink, just not outstanding."
"Im not gonna lie i do love beers that come in these bottles there is definately some love shown in presentation thats for sure,a gentle pour leaves a frothy creamy coloured two finger head with heaps of lacing and the beer underneath is a very weird dark cherry colour with nice ruby highlights,the aroma is chocolate,dried dark fruits and sugary malts with a tinge of alcohol,it has a full mouthfeel first up followed by a easy medium finish with nice tastes of raisins,dried apricots and some strong yeasty notes with only a touch of brandy flavoured alcohol present on first couple of sips,i know this beer says on the back of the earthware bottle STRONG BEER but to me 6.5% isnt what i call strong beer and the alcohol isnt a major taste on the palette so it is amazingly enough very drinkable for my tastes."
"D - This tastes like no other porter that I've had before and thats not really a good thing save your money and pass by this one"
"Drinkability: Entirely unimpressive and not a beer I could honestly recommend; it's one of those beers that were it not for these notes, I would have absolutely no memory of this thing. Somebody deserves a well-earned high five for the joke of classifying this a ""Baltic Porter"". Good one!"
"it goes down smooth but is a little overcarbonated for me, not as thick as most baltic porters but certainly makes up for it in smell and nice taste. an absolute must for porter fans"
"Drinkability: This is very good, and with a wine bottle size serving left to consume, that is a good thing. Easy to drink and very malty, just like I like beer. Would I seek it out again? Probably not. The serving size is a little too restrictive."
"OVERALL: This is definitely Belgian in style, more like a Belgian double or strong dark ale than a Baltic porter. Given how Belgian porters and stouts come out, this is to be expected. It's enjoyable, drinkable, and tastes very nice, even if it isn't really a porter as most of us known them. In fact, the thin feel was the only thing that really hurt the beer. In the end, if you're in the mood for a good, interesting, and unique Belgian, like a strong dark or a dubbel, then give this a try. On the other hand, if you're looking for an English or American style porter, try elsewhere."
"Future outlook: Hard to say. A bit cost-prohibitive given what it is, but a solid drinker. I would never shun partaking in this brew, but it seems doubtful that I will purchase it again in the near future."
"Taste is very fruity with mango and other exotic fruits. A bit of a metallic taste, probably from the dark malts. The beer is dark brown, but lacks a real roasted taste, to be expected from a Porter, which it obviously isn't. Body is thin. It is a strange Belgian experiment that doesn't harm, but enjoyable is a different thing."
"Easy to drink and enjoyable as hell."
"D - Not what I was expecting but still decent. Easy to drink but only kind of enjoyable. Probably wouldn't buy again"
"A touch expensive for what you are getting, but a damned fine beer nevertheless."
"D- If it weren't so costly, this would be the only porter I would ever drink again. I highly recommend reading Classic Beer Styles ""Mild Ale"" by David Sutula, and then enjoying one of these. You'll have a more defined understanding of how a real porter, a pint of plain, should taste."
"I don't normally ""grade to style", but when a beer is so far off the mark what else can I do?"
"D: This is a pretty tasty beer, though not what I expected from the style. One of the only problems with this brew is that it seems to lose its punch the longer you drink it. Not a bad beer, though."
"D - Not really what I was expecting. Not many porter qualities to it...More of a watered down abbey."
" Although neither ""Baltic"" nor ""porter"" describe this brew aptly, drinkability is fair to good."
"Slightly disappointing mouthfeel. Again heavily Belgian in character but little to do with a porter in texture. Brighter and crisp with high carbonation and a mellow thin finish. Certainly low gravity and somewhat lacking. Interesting, but not exceptional."
"A dark brown beer with deep ruby highlights. Has a big foamy beige head, but not much lace. The aroma is spicey and sweet with dried fruit backbone. The flavor profile is pretty much that of a Baltic porter but with a spicey Belgian style twist. Hints of cinnamon and clove in the background. Light and smooth in the mouthfeel with a nice prickly carbonation. A tasty treat that I have been waiting years to try (I picked up the glass for this about 3 years ago)."
"D: First time Belgian porter, will have to revisit, not impressed."
"Moderate carbonation, fairly smooth. Pretty tasty."
"Drinks alright, but off style IMO, can't really recommend this, especially for $9 a 750 ml"
"Note: A decent brew, but not the best....not the worst either."
"Drinkability: I need a fresh bottle. I can imagine this being good but the one I had definitely was not."
"Wow! My experience with this beer started off very differently than everyone else's, but then in the end I drew a lot of the same conclusions. I don't know if the bottle was just very shaken up or what, but it poured with two-three fingers of thick mountainous head, almost like an ice cream soda. Rosewood color. Looks great, and the head remained all the way to the bottom of the glass (if there'd been some lacing, this would have been a perfect score). Smells richly of malts and yeast, prunes and (didn't think of this at the time, but agree with the reviewer who wrote) butter. As everyone else said -- not like any other porter you've ever had -- more like an abbey brun. Tasted good, rich and sweet, and sips of the thick head provided a bitter yeasty counterpart to the malts. A big body that goes down smooth -- if I could find this beer at a more reasonable price, I'd buy it now and again (would be a nice winter warm-up), but as is, I think it's more of a one-timer. Very cool bottle -- is it made of stone?"
"This is barely a porter, and probably only classified as such because it says PORTER on the label. There is not one characteristic in this beer that says its a porter. However, this one is a new category. An English Porter has a strong malt presence, an American Porter has a strong hop presence, and now a Belgian Porter has a strong yeast presence. The amount of diacetyl (a yeast byproduct) is very prevalent. There is also a fruity characteristic that is similar to the one found in Belgian Ales. If you're looking for something traditional, you may want to try something else. But if you're looking for something new, this is right up your alley."
"Had this beer the other evening, took it home as a sample from the distribution company. Nice pour, head didn't last though, still a very drinkable beer, made better by being free. Fairly rich flavor, very little bitterness, definitely a good one to go with a meal of meat and cheese or the like. Nothing fantastically special, and I know that the price tag will definitely deter me from purchasing it anytime in the future. Good stuff though"
"Sterkens should ditch the ceramic bottles. They just don't work well."
"A thin body, with faint smells of roasted malts, light bitter unremarkable taste that is fairly easy to drink but not exactly pleasant enough to justify a second bottle. I shared mine and that is it."
"D: Easy to drink but why waste the time?"
"Pours a deep mahogany color with a foamy and bubbly tan head that fades into a thin lace. Nose is sweet and sugary with some fainter notes of alcohol present as well. Taste begins with brown sugar and semi-dark chocolate followed by some lightly fruity yeast and some mildly spicy notes. Not sure IÂ’d call this a porter, but IÂ’m not sure what else IÂ’d call it either."
"M/D- Medium bodied, fairly high carbonation for a porter....smooth and easy to drink. I have not had very many belgian porters, but this is much lighter than most porters that I am used to....maybe almost a dark brown ale...its good, but not worth what it is priced in the store....this makes it slightly less drinkable."
"Drinkability- For a porter I would not buy again, but for a beer just at that, it's a possibility. Rather odd tastes, but pretty good at that. Interesting for sure."
"Overall, i'm impressed with this beer. I had concerns buying it at only $7 with this heavy ceramic bottle, and with other reviews, but i'm really liking this smokey flavor right now."
"As a beer it is not terrible - but if you are in the mood for a porter - this is not the one to have - too caramel-sweet and lacks richness or the complex flavors of a porter."
"A heavy pour from a ceramic 75cl bottle resulted in a very small head on a dark brown beer. Aroma is interesting, seemed a bit estery at first, now I'm getting figs, and maybe some chocolate notes. This beer is very low in carbonation. Doesn't really taste too much like a porter, more like a brown ale IMHO. Some raisin in the taste. Definitely interesting, but not compelling. Worth a try."
"Aroma is mostly caramel malt that imparts slight raisin notes. Cloudy brown in color with a firm two finger thick head. Flavor is candy sugar and caramel malts. There is a raisin bread and sugar syrup flavor in the finish. It finishes pretty dry with only the malt as an aftertatse. ItÂ’s not a bad beer at all it just doesnÂ’t have any range in the flavor."
"Clear, dark brown/amber with light tan head composed of fine bubbles. Good head retention and very nice lacing that left rings around the glass. Light chocolate and raisin aroma with a bit of cola and slight funky cheesiness. Interesting. Plenty of malt sweetness with some chocolate, grainy malt and low bitterness. The finish is very short. Medium body and carbonation, good texture and a bit dry. It seems to be a little light on the dark malt for a porter, but it's very easy to drink and fairly interesting."
"Truth be told, I purchased this beer on a whim, for the bottle alone. I was amazingly surprised and pleased with the contents. A heavy, chocolate nose greeted me, while the lingering taste spoke more of maple fading to a light hoppy finish. Truly a delight to drink, I'll be buying more...for the contents this time. Cheers aye!"
"Poured into a pilsner, had a translucent brown color with close to an inch of beige head. Lacing on the glass was medium, didnt stay for to long. It pretty good to me, a medium malty smell. Taste of coffee and caramel with dark fruits. The carbonation was light, they should add a little more bubbles to this one. It is really easy to drink and has a good aftertaste. I enjoyed this beer and the bottle that it comes in is nice, its reclosable which is nice if you dont want to drink all of it in one sitting. Overall I give it a good rating, definately wish it was a little cheaper, guess the bottle makes it more expensive, worth buying though."
"It definitely showed signs of being a porter, with the roastiness and all, but the overwhelming characteristic I found was molasses. It was quite sweet but the roasted malts balanced some. No real hops to speak of. Then again, it was next to a big IPA at the time. (Poor planning?) Beautiful black with amber colors, very little head. Drank well, if a little sweet."
"I guess I could finish this glass of this beer but I don't want to. There are 24 different beers in my refrigerator right now all of, which are more enjoyable than this. I can't recommend this beer at all."
"Comments - Never underestimate the power of importation to wreak havoc on a beer. Still, this beer is worth a try."
"This is the pinnacle of average for the style. OK, but no keeper."
"Fruit juice, strawberry, cocoa, pizza dough, earthy taste. Some hops but they're mainly in the aftertaste and don't contribute much to the aroma or taste."
"Notes: Not very porter-ish for a Baltic porter. It's lacking the roastyness. Also the body is very thin. There are some flaws, but good flavor nonetheless."
"Head is noisy, fizzy, and light tan. Second pour head is fluffy, still and dense. The beer is a rich, clear, dark walnut with ruby highlights. There are a few swoops of lacing. Gorgeous nose: sweet, bready toffee. Sweet toffee and chocolate up front. A thick, buttery, malt middle. A strange, buttery, non-sweet fruit in the finish. Really, not sweet at all, but fruity. Also: alcohol and spice. This beer starts great, but finishes a little disappointing. Still, good, interesting."
"Reflection: It seemed to be more of a dark ale than porters I'm used to, but it was a very pleasant beer nonetheless."
"This is a Belgian porter ?"
"750 ml bottle, ceramic with a bail top. No real complexity to note and this beer should probably not be in the Baltic Porter style, more of a regular Porter. Easy to consume."
"Pours with a two-finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Deep red/amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is malty. Starts with a roasted hazelnut sweetness and finishes smooth with no bitter aftertaste or hints of alcohol. A very good porter, quite different from typical American porters - Stone, Heavyweight, Redhook etc. 750ml bottle for $10.99 at Hoosick St Discount Bev. Troy, NY."
"This beer poured a copper brown color with crimson highlights. Solid dark white head that soon faded to just covering the top of the beer. Tons of lacing. This doesn't look like a porter but it still looks nice. The smell is strongly yeasty and slightly bready, probably a little too yeasty of an aroma for me. The taste begins really sweet with caramel malts, its almost cloying but the yeast comes and stops that. There's a tart flavor from the yeast that holds throughout. More sweetness comes in with a fig newton like taste. The finish is yeasty and figgy and it holds in my mouth for a long time. Not a porter in the classic sense but I still liked it."
"There is no way I am dignifying this lack luster beer a porter. It does not share any of the qualities that a porter should have. Much like Saku Porter, it does not have the porter look to it. Clear red with little head that is gone in a blink. The taste is citrucy with mild malts. This is a big let down. Don't even get me started on it."
"Pours a clear amber hue under a 2.5 finger tan head that has marvelous body, great staying power and superb lacing. It is too pale for a porter, however. The mild nose features caramel. The mouth is pretty well carbonated and too light for a good porter. The taste is watery, but there are caramel flavors here, with a slight hoppiness in the finish. The sweet caramel dominates the aftertaste. This is a very drinkable beer, but it has little in common with what I expect from a porter. If they renamed this a brown ale, that'd get much higher marks."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a frothy off-white head. The aroma is decent. It has a malty/roasted barley scent that is very pleasant. It has a sweet aroma. The taste is good. It is a light tasting dark beer with malt character and a fruity yeast finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine porter style Belgian ale. I think I'll have another."
"The malt has a wheat and edgy rye-like taste. Flavors of clove, coriander, orange zest and a lemony bitterness gain in stature as the brew warms. It also improves in drinkability. This is more a Nut Brown than a Poorter."
"A dark brown pour with ameadium tan....although, this place (Pelgrom) is so friggin dark inside, i can't even see my beer!!! A sweet chocolatley nose with light hints of dark fruit. The body is also of dark fruit such as plum and raisin but the taste fades rather quickly leaving me wanting more. It looked nice and smelled ok but the taste left much to be desired. A very average beer."
"Drinkability Â– This is almost like an AprilÂ’s Fools joke. The bottle is stone brown with an authentic Belgium label listing the breweryÂ’s origin as 1210, but its contents is macro-flavored, Â“Belgium Strong Dark Ale . . . by Budweiser!Â” It has a cap attached to the bottle . . . as if itÂ’s going to fill you up with one glass and youÂ’ll want to save the rest for later. Egad!"
"Not your typical Porter as I have experienced them to be. This Porter was much to my liking as I like a very smooth beer that goes down easy with no bitterness or sharp aftertaste. This beer poured a small tan head with a cloudy body and a brown hue. There was good lacing with this beer. The mouthfeel was smooth."
"This brew poured a small head of light brown fine to medium bubbles which left a nice lacing as it receded. It has a cloudy brown body with fine particulate. It has a smooth malty flavor but is a little weak for a porter. Very smooth though and I found myself liking the flavor and the taste, just hard to call it a porter."
"Overall, I am enjoying this beer but the mouthfeel is a bit unsettling...I love the nose and the taste is pretty good but it is not very porter like in my opinion...definitely worth trying once..."
"All in all, a subpar porter/belgian beer."
"The pour a cloudless sanguineous color, the head slight, and the lace patchy. The nose is mostly malt, fresh and clean smelling with the start thickly malt, lightly sweet and the top middling in its mouth feel. Finish is penetratingly acidic, the hops toothsome, also a bit vinous and lightly tart with the aftertaste exquisitely dry and long lasting. Different front the run of the mill porters, and the 6.5% ABV adds a bit of warmth to the tummy, well worth a sample, as a change of pace from the American Style Porters."
"An interesting beer, may well be in a Porter style as indicated by the bottle (crock).  Clear darker ruby color, small head but pretty dense and creamy.  Doesn't last a real long time.  Yeasty and sharp citrus aromas.  Nice mouthfeel, malt dominates flavor and is in the brown-sugar and caramel range.  A little hoppy squeeze, slightly tangeriney, and helped by moderate carbonation.  Not hugely complex, could use a little more body but a unique brew from Belgium.  The thick, light brown, swing-top crock rocks!"
"Notes: Sip and savour brew, a highly drinkable Belgian brewed ale that shows some alcoholic girth so beware."
