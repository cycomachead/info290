"Fine example of a nice well-rounded porter. Sweet toasty chocolate malts are perfectly balanced by a bit of cola, black pepper, some nice walnut, and a bit of spicy floral hops on the backside. Only had this beer and One Oatmeal Stout from Dark Horse but I will be looking out for them in the future. These guys seem to really know their stouts."

"It was ok. I would order it again if it were all that was available. Not Dark Horse's  best."

"A fairly overrated beer, I'd say. it's definitely good, but not by any means exceptional."
"The bottle opened with a very strong rush of air. Not a gusher, but it's hard to pour without excessive head. When in the glass, it does look good - a toasty brown and black color with a khaki head. There is something off about the smell, I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's a bit more acrid than I would like. The taste is moderately roasty with some nice acidic notes; tastes pretty style-appropriate to me. Mouthfeel isn't up to par, the massive amounts of carbonation are overwhelming the medium/heavy body. Overall, it's a miss."

"Not one of Dark Horse's best offerings, I felt this did not meet my expectations for a Baltic Porter, let alone a good porter itself."

"O - Very good and drinkable porter, though not necessarily a Baltic porter. The thing is (and here I go blowing my hot air) that it really has the taste of the other Dark Horse dark beers. There is something identifiable in the recipe that one can specifically say is Dark Horse, as it is a profile that they have in their other beers. And that is not to say it is a bad thing - it is refreshing to drink something that you know where it came from and it is a trait that they carry over from brewing to brewing - and its nice to have a consistent friend to come back to from time to time."
"This is a fairly complex porter, that disguises each note until the beer warms up. Chocolate malts and brown sugar/molasses forward. Dark fruit and anise notes come out in the back end. Think of a dried fruit covered in bakerâ€™s chocolate. Thin in body yet creamy in mouthfeel - toes the line between porter and stout quite well. The 7% is not overly noticeable here."
""
"First Baltic Porter, so I'm not sure yet what I'm looking for in the style. I like cold black coffee flavor, but it doesn't hang around. Wouldn't mind a few more of these."
"Dark Horse does it again. If you see it buy it!"
""
"Nice porter! 12 oz. bottle. Good smell."
"The late Micheal Jackson, hailed as the original and still greatest beer writer of all time, said of the difference between stout and porter that it was ""as unambiguous as a horoscope"". Imagine then the difference amongst porters themselves! This review should have focused less on categorizing this beer and instead taking it at face value - Thirsty Trout is a nice offering, simple as that."

"Really tasty, complex enough and extremely quaffable. One of the most thirst-quenching porters i've ever had, i wonder if there's any relation with the name in this matter."
""
"12oz bottle, poured into my favorite tulip.  Nice black color with reddish hue when held to light.  Aroma of chocolate, roast and coffee.  Nice smooth porter that has a very nice mouthful and feels highly drinkable despite its 7.0% abv.  Nice effort from Dark Horse yet again.  Salute"

"O- A great strong porter at 7%. I would have this again."

"Overall (4) : This beer is like what you'd get if you had an iced coffee with malts and alcohol - but done right. It's a total campfire, sit and roast marshmallows, cuddle up and read a book (I sound like a friggin' girl), or comfortably watch MacGuyver (there we go, that's more man-like) beer. It's very roasted, very chocolate-coffee, and very dark beer all at the same time. One of the better porters I've had."
"nice porter with a smooth creamy taste"
""
""
""
"Very malty smell. Dark dark black pour with little head. Mmm, nice smokey taste. Easy on the taste buds. Lots if roasty malts. I like it."

"O: A good porter, tasty but I wish the flavors were at the level of the nose"

"Great malt character, with a nice balance between chocolate and roast, though chocolate outshines the roast. The nutty, toasted malt is a nice treat. The dark fruit adds interesting complexity. Becomes a touch metallic late."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A vigorous pour led to a pseudo-cascade which settled into a finger of frothy, deep-tan head with limited retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing zero light penetration. Nose was very roasty with a deep charcoal aspect. Say, is the Trout a Stout? Hmmm. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was very much of charcoal and dark chocolate. Finish was semi-dry with the roastiness leaving a bitter, smoky flavor as its aftertaste. This beer leaves me with a conundrum, since it is not really what I would consider a porter, but more towards a stout. I did not dislike it, but it was not really what I was expecting, either. I guess that you will have to try one and gauge it for yourself."

"Overall, not the greatest Dark Horse offering, but good as a one off."

"This is a complex, rich, well-balanced porter. Easy to drink, especially for the abv. Well-made and certainly enjoyable!"

"O - very good baltic porter. I'd definitely buy this one again, but a little more booze might have done it some good."
""
""
""
"I can see where they were going with this but the end result just didn't pan out. Either I just don't like this beer or I got an infected batch. Either way, I won't be visiting this one again."
""
""
""

"good complex porter as they go. this one features some vanilla and some spice in both the aroma and flavor, a nice twist on the classic style. its dark but still lets some light in to give it the faintest amber glow at the bottom of the glass. not much head on it, but its got a creamy enough mouthfeel and I don't wish for more carbonation at all. its only mildly bitter in the finish, with subtle spice wafting throughout. earthy malt vibe, not as dark as some, and certainly not as full bodied. I also get a lager yeast vibe, especially in the crisped up finish, but maybe my palate is playing tricks on me. a good porter overall, on par with the other quality dark horse brews, but this one didn't stand out to me the way some of the others did. maybe just a little light for the style in winter time."
""
""
"It's a porter, but it doesn't have quite the heft or build a Baltic porter ought to. It's mildly dry off some char. Carbonation and crispness are kept in check and, while it could use a bit of a more well-rounded smoothness, it isn't lacking too much."

"O - Easy drinking Baltic Porter. Nothing memorable about it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good porter. Big flavors."
""
"It's got some interesting qualities for a baltic porter, but even though this isn't a prefered style of mine, there are others that I would probably choose over it."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown with ruby edges.  Good roast profile with a touch of smoke upfront.  Hearty for a basic porter but a touch light for a Baltic."
""
"Bro-in-law comes through with this brilliant porter from DH. The beer rated low on appearance because there wasn't a decent head present..nor did it lace. The smell and taste however were very good. The scent had dark roast chocolate. The taste was slightly sweet yet bitter....somewhat like the semi-sweet chocolates used for chocolate chip cookies. The mouthfeel was full body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a great porter....sessionable for sure."
""
""
""
"To the Point: nothing special; a serviceable porter;"
"O: Any beer that I can pick up a lot of licorice flavors in is likely to get a big fat 'meh' from me - the only reason this doesn't is because of how damn drinkable it is. Even still, I wouldn't seek this one out in the future."
""
""
""
"O - Pretty good porter, but nothing Earth-shattering going on here."

"O: There's nothing groundbreaking about this beer at all, but that doesn't make it bad by any means. I could see myself going back to it if I saw it on draft (which I never will), but I doubt I would buy it again in bottle form."
"O - great Baltic porter, dark horse continues to impress me with all they put out"
""
""
"Very dark chestnut color with only a slender, creamy line of a head. Aromas of salted dark chocolate, caramel, nuts, and berries. Rich, malty flavor transitioning to dark fruitiness. Sweetened coffee, tobacco, molasses, faint licorice, caramelized sugar, and vanilla bean. Dry in the finish and creamy, but thinner than expected. A very tasty, big-ish porter and yet another malty success from Dark Horse."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Despite this one being seven percent it's very drinkable. Cheers."
""
""
"The scent it mostly burnt malt with hints of chocolate and char. The taste does not follow as strong charred malts and coffee sit on the tongue. The feel it very smooth and a touch dry, its light but charismatic."
"Overall: A nice BP in my opinion. It good to see more breweries try this style out as compared with the Eastern European breweries."
""
""
"This is a nice porter. It has a nice flavor profile that is intricate but simple. The body offers great drinkability. Overall, a good, well-rounded porter. It probably won't please everybody, but for me this is a porter I would go back to."
""
""
"Overall: I enjoyed drinking this porter. I like getting tons of roast malt in the flavours and nose of the porters I drink, and this delivers in that regard. For the most part it's a good solid porter, nothing to write home about. If it was a bit creamier and thicker, I'd consider putting it up there with some of the better porters like Eddy Fitz (even though they are in different beer styles) (4)"
""
""
""
"Goot schtuf! Served at a good temperature with modest head that soon settles to a light cover that lasts forever and good lacing. Color is an opaque black brown. Aroma is malt, roast, dark ripe fruit, molasses, cocoa. Flavor's like nose with all the above characteristics amplified plus the integration of sweet, carbonic tang, and bitter. Body is good but carbonation seems a little light. Finish is like flavor, longish, and a touch boozy."
""
"At this point I've had enough baltic porters (from both sides of the pond) to know the difference. This one is thick as it should be. That someone berry kind of robust sweetness is there. Smooth feel. Minimal carbonation. An easy drinker and a good example of the style."
""
"Overall not bad, more like a milk stout than baltic porter, but still fairly tasty and drinkable, nice robustness, just a bit light overall feel and carbonation."
""
""
"Overall another great beer from Dark Horse. In a way if made me remember how good the series of the ""four"" beers are."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/3/2013. Pours fairly pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, toast, light char, molasses, light raisin, floral, and hop earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance, strength, and complexity of dark malt notes. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, toast, toffee, molasses, light char, light raisin, floral, and hop earthiness. Light earthy coffee bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, light coffee, toast, toffee, light raisin, floral, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of flavor with good complexity; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice porter. Very nice flavor balance and robustness; and very smooth to sip on. A very enjoyable offering."

"All in all I thought this was a very good beer and a very good example of the style, it had everything that I look for in the style, it call came together nicely with this beer and it's just how a good Baltic Porter should be. This beer had great drinkability, it was very smooth, with lots of nice roasted flavors that really held my attention and the alcohol was hardly noticeable, I wouldn't mind drinking a couple of these, it would make for a nice beer to have by the campfire, one of the most drinkable Baltic Porters I have tried. What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was and how drinkable it was, those aspects really made this a nice beer. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there was nothing that I thought was out of place or needed to be improved on. I would for sure buy this beer again when looking for a nice and roasty beer, I consider it a bargain for $1,89 and you can be sure that I will be stocking up on some in the near future, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Porters and Stouts. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, it's one damn good Baltic Porter and I would put it right up there with Bridge Brew Works Baltic Porter as my favorite of the style, they are both very good but this one is a little more drinkable. Dark Horse can make some pretty damn good beers and this is no exception, I'm glad they finally decided to bottle this, it's a great addition to their lineup and it will be a great addition to my fridge, great works guys, this one's a winner."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is nice and sweet, the brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and a bit of dark fruit. It tastes like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and some licorice. The aroma is sweet, but the bitter roastiness really shows up in the taste of this brew. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. I think this is a good brew, I'd definitely like to try it again sometime."

"Dark Horse lives up to its name. So much good stuff coming out of sleepy Marshall MI. Maybe it's just first impression, but I love this beer."
""
""
""
"Taste-Dark toasted malt, faint coffee, smooth, easy finish. More of a classic porter taste than a Baltic porter, but a nice offering none-the-less."
"Nice example of the Baltic Porter style, but it doesn't exactly stand out. It's traditional and well executed, just a little one note."
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, chewy and smooth on the tongue. Well-crafted, albeit fairly standard porter. I'd drink this again, but there's definitely some better ones out there."
""
""
"O: This beer tastes a little heavier bodied compared to regular porters but is very drinkable when compared to other types of Baltic Porters."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Where Thirsty Trout draws in inspiration from several porter sources, it doesn't really resonate with the palate as a Baltic porter any more as it does for American porters, robust porters, or English brown porters. But it is a pleasant flavor profile that makes it a joy to drink."
""
""
"M - Medium body, moderate carbonation."
"appears almost black, with off-white head. nice lacing as I drink the glass. milk chocolate in the aroma. slightly roasty taste. thicker body, lower carbonation. I'd say it's to style as a Baltic Porter. I'd drink it again."
""
"O: I like this a good deal. Dark Horse seems to make stouts and porters that are geared to my taste-buds. I'd drink this again in a heartbeat."
""
""
""
""
""

"Memories of somehow drug-free arguments about Spongebob episodes come to mind here: How can a trout be ""thirsty""? Anyway, this stuff pours a straight obsidian topped by a finger of dusty tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate (both dark and syrup), molasses, and roasted malts. This stuff smells damn fine, I tell you what! The taste holds notes of dark chocolate powder, roasted malts, light coffee, very light molasses, and a kiss of maple syrup. The body is a sorta-light-medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a generally smooth feel, and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a very nice porter, one I wish I could find regularly in bottles out here. Let's go, Dark Horse!"
""
"Very dark, nearly opaque black body with a thin head and no lacing. Not much carbonation, but about as expected for a Growler. The pint I had at the pub was a bit more lively, but not much. Slightly toasty, coffee, malty flavor. Well balanced. Not really what I would call a Baltic porter, but a very good beer."
"First draft on site at Dark Horse, and it's a pretty good start. Poured in a pint glass right up to the rim with very little head, yet it lingers a bit. Solid coffee and malty roast in the nose with a bit of light hop as well. Very easy drinking, even in the heat of the summer swelter--mouthfeel is chewy and light at the same time--malt, coffee and roast settle and linger in the mouth--same hop spice on the tongue. Nice beer that would be better on a cooler day or with a bit more AC in the bar. This pitch black 7% porter is more than worth the effort but moved on for the next pint."
"On tap at Hop Cat in G.R. Very murky dark brown pour. Not a substantial off white head. Sticks to the glass ever so slightly. Rich malt aroma with quite a bit of chocolate, less roast. Taste does kind of match that, with some earthy peat and tobacco, but quite a bit of molasses and chocolate. Barely enough bitterness in the finish. Just medium bodied, with adequate carbonation. The only thing preventing an excepetional in drinkability is the slight over sweetness. Otherwise, well worth trying. This had a tough road to hoe following a Founders KBS, so another good brew from Dark Horse."
"More of a porter slash brown than a baltic porter, on tap at Hopcat. Brown with carbonation bubbles. Average mouthfeel. Malty. Licorice brown taste. A little roast, more licorice than chocolate, and a tad coffee. Much better at the brewery, better mouthfeel.."
"Anyway, it's a nice black with slight ruby hints and a thin brown head. Nose is malty molasses with almond, vanilla, and maybe even slight cardamom. Quite delicious! The taste is mild malts, some hops. Nowhere near the complexity of the nose. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, but drinkability is pretty good. Nice brew."
"D: I am hoping that I do not finish the whole growler tonight, but hell that is just a good reason to make the trip right."
"Poured from Growler into Snifter glass and about an inch of creamy tan head appears. Beer itself is quite dark. When I hold it up to the light there is the slightest red that gets through bur hardly anything. Creamy smell with slight roasted coffee notes for smell - it is certainly inviting... Taste is sweet creamy with a bit of a rich fruit taste with some roasted background. Mouthfeel seems a bit thin to my taste, but admittedly this is to style. Drinkablity? Beer Me again."
"Deep formulation of every color except black. Fruity, lacking aroma of dark fruits (blackberries, cherries) with scents of roasted malts and coffee. Nice underlying dark fruitiness is all over the palate, along with deep roasted malts, bitter chocolate and coffee. The coffee in particular lingers on after the swallow for seconds and is ignited once again after a simple lick from my tongue. Lacking in body and texture but still true to the style and pretty delicious."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, creamy, sweet, balanced, and getting the job done."
"A workingman's thanks to inebrius!"
"A great beer from a lil known brewer in Michigan."
"A traditional porter with a twist."
"Creamy and viscous on the palate, it expands generously to reveal sooty, seasoned wood flavors intermixed with charred blueberries, cocoa, palm leaves, baked coconut and roasted shoes. Very impressive and very faithful to classic Porter - as well as Dark Horse's mission to summon all of the delightful bitter flavors from the bowels of the earth and put them in beer."
"Thanks to CRJMellor for the bottle."
"A good, but not spectacular porter. Pours out to a dark brown to black color with a slight head. Despite the slight head, carbonation is fairly active in the glass. The aroma is that of malted milk balls. The taste interesting. There is a definite coffee/expresso taste present that borders on burnt coffee and finishes as such, bringing down its drinkability score to the average range."
"Drinkability is solid but wateriness makes it an unspectacular offering."
"This one was super dark in appearance and the head was almost totally absent from my vigorous pour. Where is the carbonation? The smell is intense roastiness. The taste brings about a burnt coffee/espresso flavor that I feel is too blunt. Chocolate mixes slightly as well as some earthy flavors. This one is too one sided and intense to really be enjoyed. Not a bad offering but I was hoping for more from Dark Horse here."
