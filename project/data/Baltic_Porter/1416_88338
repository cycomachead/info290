Smells of sweet malt, roasted malt, alcohol, hops, slight yeast, and a hint of tart.  Fits the style of a Baltic Porter.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, hops, hint of yeast, and slight tartness.  Overall, good appearance, average aroma and body, (but too much roasted malt and not enough tartness), and average feel.","Tone","Friday at 07:41 AM"

Easy to quaff overall I really enjoyed this take on the style with wonderfully tasty profile with not too much barrel character, yet 3 years has given this a smoothness and made it highly drinkable.","Slatetank","Mar 17, 2015"

Strong bitter coffee, dry bittersweet chocolate, subtle vanilla and tempting bourbon. There is a wood so light on this that it seems to be  afloat, weightless on the beer. A slight warmth from alcohol as this one finishes crisp, dry, thinnish to the palate but with a medium mouthfeel and with some hop bitter to linger alongside all that smooth caramel.","utopiajane","Aug 24, 2014"

Yeah, that's the flipside of the whiskey-cask aging coin - if the big caramel, vanilla, and oak woodiness don't honour their paychecks by doing their song and dance, we're left in a fix.

Extremely well-balanced with the flavors from the dark malts and oak barrel aging. At 8%, the alcohol is completely hidden. Although the first batch of Sea Legs (ca. 2012/2013) was aged in bourbon barrels, the 2013/2014 batch is aged in virgin wooden vessels. For those who are fans of Uinta's Oak Jacked (one my favorites, ever), I am certain you would like this. Despite the description on the label, I did not get any hints of smoke in either the aroma or flavor. Great stuff and highly recommended.","threeviews","Jan 18, 2014"

Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, vanilla, oak, bourbon, light coffee, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of roasted and dark malt notes with moderate barrel presence; and good strength. Taste of milk chocolate, toast, caramel, toffee, cocoa, roasted malt, oak, clove, vanilla, bourbon, light coffee, and roasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, toast, toffee, cocoa, roasted malt, vanilla, oak, clove, bourbon, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark and roasted malt flavors with barrel presence; with good robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, smooth, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent barrel aged Baltic porter. All around nice balance, complexity, and robustness of dark and roasted malt flavors with moderate barrel presence; and very smooth to sip on for 8%.

The liquid is more black than brown, opaque enough to be a stout and with little hint of any orange or any true color. The nose has a natural feeling fullness to it but in no way heavy, the milk chocolate, cocoa powder and vanilla remains semi-sweet at most, Brazil nuts and cashews, some peaty smokiness but stays pure, keeps the toast on the down low, passing waft of flowers, any fruit scents stay muted, develops a sort of mineral water tang to keep the nostrils fresh. Medium-bodied, compact and polished, impeccable balance and completely devoid of ostentation. Chocolate, caramel, toffee and a hint of toasted coconut and scone, just the right amount of booziness from the wood.

Very well-balanced, deeply complex, and goes down well while nipping at some Old Forester Signature bourbon.

4.3,5.1,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.5,"the newest in the wonderful crooked line series, and probably my favorite thing ive ever had from uinta. a oak aged Baltic porter, with all kinds of oaky and vanilla smells and flavors, but very little sweetness. its really malty and thick, less like a porter and more like a stout. the feel is amazing of this beer, not quite creamy, but definitely frothed, its light of its color and thickness, but isn't particularly carbonated. silky might be a better way to describe it. the malt flavor is crazy roasty, but without any bitterness, and the oak is fresh and clean, not charred and bourbon laced, but organic and fresh cut. the alcohol is invisible, and this to me is a sort of genre transcending brew, its absolutely fantastic. its a matted black color, mysterious and deep, and sitting in my globe next to the bottle it came from (with gorgeous artwork), with its milky foam head, its a sight to behold. as close to full marks as i usually go, this beer is just sensation, super complex, woody, and neither sweet or bitter. its a heck of a combination, and you should not let the price deter you. its magic, best beer ive had in awhile.","StonedTrippin","Feb 02, 2013"

Aroma of toasted malt, chocolate, vanilla and mild dark fruits. Flavor dominated by toasted malt, charred coffee and bitter chocolate with light vanilla, dark fruit and a hint of citrus. Finishes with charred malt and light hops. Medium bodied with pleasant creaminess. A really nice porter. Somewhat less light fruit / cherry flavor than I'm used to from Baltic porters, but not complaining, this is really well integrated and tasty. Another winner from Uinta's Crooked series.","LiquidAmber","Jan 27, 2013"

Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch and a half frothy tan head that stayed around for a very long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. The aroma is nice, it smells like dark fruit, roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, wood, vanilla, and some coffee. It tastes like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, coffee, burnt/charred malt, dark fruit, molasses and a bit of licorice. Nice balance between the sweet and bitter roasty flavors. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and a bit creamy with good carbonation. I liked this brew a lot, I think I'll have to pick up another bottle soon. $11.99 a bottle.","bluejacket74","Jan 20, 2013"

I won't say I didn't like it, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Once I came around to the blend of coffee, citrus, and some burnt sugar notes all blended together, I really enjoyed this beer. It's worth checking out.","tdm168","Jan 19, 2013"
