The taste follows suit with lots of fresh roasty coffee up front along with hints of hazelnut, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, cocoa, and brown bread.

4.39,8.9,4,5,4.25,4,4.25,"Can: Poured a dark clear brown color beer with a generous light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of sublime coffee notes with well-balanced caramelized malt notes. Taste is also dominated by great coffee beans notes with almost no astringency or overly dry notes. Malt backbone is solid with good caramelized notes and no overly dry roasted malt notes with light residual sugar notes. Body is lighter then I was expecting for a 10% ABV beer with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. I find it hard to distinguish the porter and thought this was more akin to a strong brown ale with loads of coffee.","Phyl21ca","Oct 25, 2013"

The taste was out of this world, with a perfect balance between sweet chocolate, toffee, dark cherries, and figs; and bitter coffee, hops, and burnt toast flavors. There was hint of lactic sourness in the finish. Very creamy in the mouth at first with and astringent punch at the end.

Taste: Sweet cocoa and a touch of molasses up front followed by roasted coffee and a nice woody character in the middle before ending with a high amount of bitter piney hops at the finish. Aftertaste is roasted, very bitter and quite long-lasting. Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a fairly high amount of carbonation. Not quite as thick and creamy as I would have wanted. The hop oils really coat the mouth. Drinkability: Good drinkability. This is a sipper, but it’s one you’ll enjoy until the last drop. Overall: Very good beer overall.

Full bodied, thick, a little sticky, still goes down easy, the coffee and dark chocolate and something akin to molasses or even syrup (I guess licorice could be here instead but I'm not sure) sweetness blend together for a coffee like stout that maintains a java like sweetness.

There is good earth and a little bitter from the hops and a touch of dark fruit on the back palate that makes this seem very decadent. The coffee is extremely well done and not the slightest bit burnt. The cocoa is like silk up next to it.

I've see it also called an imperial stout (not even close) or a generic coffee stout (lacks some of the coffee punch for me). So it is a solid, drinkable, enjoyable beer with some good but not overly potent flavors. Would love to try it on tap some day to see if I feel differently. Interestingly, I often feel this way about Sixpoint's cans, that they lack the flavor punch that I am hoping them to have. Except for Resin.","dheacck11","Mar 17, 2013"

Taste is all of that, vanilla leads the flavors, with some roasted coffee in the finish. Body is maybe medium, plenty of life, on the dry side, and easy drinking for its heft. This is a solid brew.

Tons of bubbles rising from the bottom, to a nice solid 2 finger thick head. Head was rich and thick, with a fair it of side cling. Aroma was a slightly sweet, chocolate smell, with a very small hint of acidic in the backend. Taste had both coffee and chocolate, without either overpowering the other or being the main focal point. The coffee notes kicked in first, with just a tab of bitterness, but then mellowed out and left a nice sweet cocoa flavor on the tongue. Coated the mouth extremely well, not overly bubbly with a bit of chew. Overall a very solid beer. Perhaps a bit expensive ($3.75 for the single can) but a very solid beer, right up my alley.","mountdew1","Mar 08, 2013"

And that the good people over at Sixpoint should send a pint glass in my direction! Ooops, was that out loud.","sinstaineddemon","Feb 25, 2013"

Finger length off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a thick lacing around the edges. Smells of mostly coffee beans, as well as some vanilla/carmel, bakers chocolate, and some roasted malt. Taste starts with intense, roasted coffee beans. Much stronger taste than the aroma suggests. Almost imparts an earthy flavor from the coffee beans. Then smooths out in the middle. Get some vanilla or carmel that acts like a coffee creamer and lightens the intensity of the coffee. Then the finish brings back some intense coffee flavors, in addition to some carmel, some bittersweet chocolate, as well as some bitterness from the fairly heavy hop presence. Sweetness increases as the flavor profile moves on. Pretty full body with a creamy and slick mouthfeel. Lively carbonation that reminds you that this is an imperial porter, not an imperial stout, and makes the beer much more refreshing for a full-bodied beer. No alcohol detected in the smell or taste.

Two dense, unmoving fingers of deep-tan head sat atop a bed of deep, dark liquid. More precisely, a deep, dark-brown liquid that, stingily, would not allow any light to penetrate its depths. The nose smelled like the moment this afternoon that we walked past a a coffee roaster's shop this afternoon in Fell's Point. You have to be a coffee drinker to appreciate the Pavlov's dog-like response that the smell of coffee elicits in a coffee drinker and ever since BMCS (SW) Gerard Wargo got me drinking black coffee in the Deck Department office of the USS Fulton (AS-11) in 1984, I have been hooked. Now, as the head fell, I began to foam at the mouth like a rabid dog. Mouthfeel was thick and full, like a mouthful of pudding and the roastiness of the coffee hit first, followed by a chocolatiness and finally, a smooth vanilla flavor. The finish lingered with a coffee roastiness along with a bitterness of dark chocolate.

Smell of bitter roast and ground cocoa bean and espresso bean, light nuttyness, mild sweetness and some berry notes.

Fuller side of medium, dry and lingering fruitiness. Solid selection, smoother cocoa and coffee notes preferred but makes this interesting.","rfgetz","Feb 11, 2013"

Aromas of creamy, smooth, blended and balanced vanilla and chocolate, with an undertone of bitterness from both chocolate and coffee. Very well blended and complimentary aromas as you consume. Flavors of rich, dark roasted coffee and bitter cocoa nibs right off the bat. Wow...this is damn tasty! Creamy backbone of vanilla and oak support the rich and bitter forefront attack on your tastebuds, and there is a strong, solid, boozey tail-end flavor that bleeds into the aftertaste. Some earthy and woody highlights help to add depth to the overall character of the beer. Creamy and slightly boozey aftertaste, with a lingering mocha charateristic. The lighter body lends itself to a clean, slightly dry finish. Great beer. Well crafted and very well balanced. Bravo!","GarthDanielson","Feb 10, 2013"

It offers a very interesting balance between coffee, chocolate (but chocolate in a way that feels different), malt, and some other aspects as well. The alcohol is noticeably present, but suitable and welcome for the size and character of the beer. But what’s really great is that this beer really opens up into something different and thoroughly enjoyable as it warms. Flavors re-arrange, the feel transforms, and it just becomes something different and definitely tasty. Recommended.","fmccormi","Feb 10, 2013"

The taste is reminiscent of a cold ""hot chocolate"" with huge amounts of chocolate sweetness upfront that transitions to a hoppy-coffee bitterness. The mouthfeel is velvety smooth, but drinks like most coffee porters- slightly watery, but lacking the body you'd expected based on the smell and taste. The aftertaste is huge gush of roasty, bitter chocolate. I enjoyed this beer and it was surprisingly flavorful.

Nevertheless the lacing is fantastic, sticking heavily to the sides of the glass as the beer goes down. The aroma is very intriguing... At first there is an almost maple, or molasses scent, but then the milk chocolate and boozy bourbon kicks right in. A vanilla bean sweetness is faintly detectable in the background. For the taste, I agree with other reviewers who find this to be coffee-forward. The dark chocolate aspect competes however, wrapped in a more subtle smokiness, and a splash of bourbon. The finish is a bit wood-y and dry, and has a medium mouth feel. Very warming on its way down but stops just short of having too much alcohol heat. Overall an interesting beer, definitely worth trying. It's different, but could be more balanced.","Neorebel","Feb 02, 2013"

It's a little more bitter and roasty than sweet tasting. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and has moderate carbonation. I think this is a good brew, although I'd like it better if it was in 16 ounce cans instead. $8.99 a 4-pack.","bluejacket74","Feb 01, 2013"

4.02,-0.2,3.5,4,4.25,3,4.25,"Poured can into Great Lakes snifter. Pours a cola color with clarity on the pour. As it collects in the glass, it appears dark brown with a tan head. Decent amount of lacing present on the pour. The nose starts with bold and bitter cacao nib character. This comes off a bit harsh up front but fades into a more decadent coffee aroma. The nose definitely leans towards the bitter side of things with a dash of earthy huskiness and an ever so faint hop presence. The taste is a bit more refined than the nose led me to believe. The cacao again is present first followed by a nice bold and robust coffee character. Leaves more of an espresso quality as the bold roasted beans linger through the palate. This is a little drier than most coffee chocolate brews I have encountered and at first left a little to be desired. As it warms and develops in the glass, I rather enjoy the bold and bitter onslaught of coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is lacking in my opinion. It is simply too thin to hold up to the presence of adjunct ingredients. Overall, this is a unique offering that is better than the other Sixpoint stuff I have had. It seems to grow on me with each sip. Worth a try.","homebrew311","Jan 29, 2013"

The nose comprises mild coffee, roasted malts, cocoa powder, light cola, light molasses, and a pinch of brown sugar and clove. The taste brings in more of the same, with both the coffee and the chocolate coming through grainier, more bitter. In fact, nearly all of the sweetness inherent in the smell has been drained out here. There's also a vague sense of spruce or something similar thereto hanging around as well. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation, a slightly creamy feel, and a drying finish. Overall, an interesting concoction, one that seems to make good use of the combination of ""beans", somehow simultaneously focusing on them and not letting them overpower all else.","TMoney2591","Jan 29, 2013"

A complex blend of coffee, cacao and roasted barley. The coffee flavour is round, soft, and apparent. The cacao/chocolate is subtle but present. The roast marrys well without being acrid. I detect no oak. If this is in fact a baltic porter it makes sense. There is a cleanness to this beer obtainable only through lagering. For a ten percent beer the alcohol does not get anywhere near detectable. The beer is clean on the palate, not cloying, slightly roasty and pleasant.
