"Overall, IMO the aroma is rather subdued, but the flavor definitely makes up for that. The mouthfeel, though true to the style, was a little thin for my taste, very good though."

""

"4.3/5: Pretty much exactly what I want from the style"

"O:  Great beer, but a little deceptive."
""
""
""

"Overall another dark beer tending toward the even to slightly hoppy side. Good, but I prefer to lean the other way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This might be the best baltic porter I've ever had, at least the best non-barrel aged one I've had. Just a really, really well crafted beer. This is what I've come to expect from Smuttynose."

"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of the style, it had petty much all the aspects that I look for in a good Baltic Porter and it didn't have any off flavors and anything that didn't fit into the style and it made for a tasty Baltic Porter.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, crisp, slightly sticky, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think one would be the perfect amount for me, but I wouldn't rule out drinking two, but that would be my limit.  What I like the most about this beer was that it was a very true example of the style.  What I like the least about this beer was the appearance, it wasn't bad at all, but I thought it could have a little more head.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for a Baltic Porter and I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the style or dark beers in general.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it had all the things that I look for in the style and in the end it was just a tasty Baltic Porter.  It's one of the better Smuttynose beers I've had and it's one of the better Baltic Porters I've had.  Good job guys this was a good Baltic Porter, keep up the hard work."

"I prefer the malts used in the Robust Porter more"

"Delicious! Pours very dark, tastes of chocolate, mild tobacco and coffee and excellent drinkability for close to 10% beer."

"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled in 1/2015. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger fairly dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, raisin, plum, fig, licorice, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, dark fruit, and earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, plum, fig, light licorice, light smoke/char, herbal, and roasted earthiness. Good amount of roast/char bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, dark bread, molasses, raisin, plum, fig, light smoke/char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate dark fruit flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome Baltic porter. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/roasted malt, earthy hops, and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Dark black-brown in color with a tan mocha head and only traces of lacing.  Smell is of roast, dark fruits, and maybe dark chocolate.  Tastes of cherries, bittersweet cocoa, coffee, roast, and tobacco char.  Some carbonation and coats well on the palate.  Sweetness mixed about the aroma and flavor and combine for quite the epic porter imo!  No expectations but if I had some they were completely blown away!"
"Taste: Smooth dark burnt malts. Some feint sweetness. Good, dark bitterness to finish."

"2013.  Smells like milk chocolate, dark fruit and maybe a bit of toasted coconut. Taste is lighter than I thought it would be. Higher carbonation than traditional style. Finishes clean. On the thin side."

""

""
""
""
""
"YES PLEASE. I get so excited when I can find some of this."
""
""
""
"O- My first Baltic porter experience was a great one! Definitely a style I can get into and brew at some point."
"overall great, but too expensive."

"O - Tremendous effort, with a very big, bold brew that manages to deliver imperial stout flavors via the distinct style of the baltic porter."

"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a foamy (1/3) and otherwise smooth (2/3) mouthfeel that is appropriate for a sipping beer and this style in general. Closes dry, with heavy stickiness lingering on the palate and lips."
""
""
""
"Black covered by a creamy looking, patchy head. Rich dark fruit and bread aromas with a bit of oxidation from age...raisins, prunes, figs, molasses, and port becoming increasingly chocolaty towards the end of the glass. Big malty flavors of dark, bitter chocolate, dry roast, and some vinous fruit. Silky smooth, somewhat oily, with a light acidity. Nutty, creamy malt and some char. Full-ish yet fluffy in the mouth. Really excellent as it warms and starts to open up."
"O: Drinkability is right where it should be. Very nice overall."

"This beer is Big, tastes great and has tons of character."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I might need to grab another bottle, this stuff is nice. One of the best Baltic Porters I've had. Really hits all the marks. Worth a try for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- this is a big porter, loaded with flavor. The alcohol is noticeable but pairs well with the big flavors, and the multi-dimensions of flavors and aromas make this one a standard for the style"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Bordering on too rich,doesn't cross the line. A full, hefty porter."
"This is a great beer. It has alot of similarities with their Imperial Stout, in my opinion. There's not much to complain about and it's extremely enjoyable. Recommended."

"A truly exceptional beer. This is what I think of when I try to imagine the perfect baltic porter. Very complex yet perfectly balanced. A liquid dream!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Smuttynose killed it with this one. Epitomizes what a baltic porter should taste like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a big beer and a sipping beer even though the alcohol is extremely well hidden - lots of complexity and richness to the flavors of this beer. A really nice example of the style."
"Pours a total eclipse jet black with huge persistent head. Aroma of figs, raisins and rum-soaked fruit cake. Taste is a blast of sweet rum soaked figs and prunes with a strong, lingering burnt wood finish. The alcohol has a strong presence but is overcome by the roasted wood. Not an easy drinking beer, but a good pick when your taste buds are compromised."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice beer, drinks more like an imperial stout to me. Wonderfully combines roast, chocolate, dark fruit flavors. Very well done."
"O/D - A nice baltic porter. Tasty and nice to sip. Complexity was good but didn't go the extra mile, but the beer was enjoyable overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a surprisingly incredible beer. It balances sweetness, has that interesting fruit note, but also cleans off well with the alcohol and bitterness. Truly a world class beer."
""
""
"Big is an appropriate word for this. Really a nice porter to add to any lineup. As always priced to move!"

"A very strong beer. Smells rich and there is hint of chocolate, coffee, and cherries. Pours very thick and dark black. The color of coffee. The head of the beer was thick and very brown. The taste is good and very flavorable and thick when tasted. Worth trying."
""
"O: A nice complex and well balanced baltic porter. Good variety of flavors and they complement each other nicely. I'm not a fan of smoky beers, but this one has some well integrated smoke. This is up there with Surly Smoke and Alaskan Baltic Porter."
""
""
""
""
"T: Opens with a rich blend of roasted malt and coffee. Mocha, fudge, and dark chocolate come in the middle with a finish that's roasty and a touch bitter and laced with tobacco, blackberry and dark bread."

"This was as strong as needed to be, but I wouldn't want it to be any weaker as well. Polishing off one of these was easy and given the time, I'd easily buy this again. There's no doubt as to why this is the highest-rated beer from Smuttynose and for any Porter, Stout, or Dark Ale fan, this is must-have. Really great stuff!"
""
""
""
"Overall: Really impressed by this beer. I was expecting a lot and was not let down. Looks great, smells delicious, bold flavors. You can't ask for much more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Brewed well in my opinion- there are a lot of flavours that come together in a way that I haven't had in a lot of porters. It's a bit too sweet which I'm ok with but its really the dry boozy feel of this beer that turns me off on it. For the price I think it'd be a nice experiment to have a second one to age, but having it a few months fresh like I did was not the experience I expected. (4)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D/O: This otherwise-good porter is diminished considerably by the extent to which tasted and felt acidity is present. Like other high gravity dark beers with similar failings, the mood is turned a bit schizophrenic by the acidity that simultaneously sends heavy flavors scattering and sears the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Vanilla and coffee heavy. Nice Baltic Porter that drinks really easy."
""
"Overall: Really good beer though a bit boozy for being ""only"" 9.8%. Definitely worth picking up now, but I'd also be interested to see what some age does to this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Drink- I can see why this was in the Top 250. A good beer for the style with semi. Good balance, large aromas and flavors and warms on a cold CA night."
""
"Nice porter. Little on the bitter side for my preferences, but excellent complexity and flavor. Would do better with some balance on the sweetness side."
""
""
"O - Rich and full in ingredients, this beer needs to age to let the alcohol integrate into them and mellow it out. A drink to warm your tummy on a cold winter night. The next couple of these I find are going to be laid down for a couple of years to see if that's what can turn this promise of a delicious brew into an actual one. If it does, this is easily a beer that will score well into the 4s. The components are clearly there - they just need more time to come together."
"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, thick, brown-to-black coloring with a frothy, dense, light brown colored head that settles into a quarter inch layering. Pours thick. Aromas of roast coffee, bittersweet chocolate, a touch of smoke, and a hint of old world fruit sweetness. Flavors are rich and bold, with a solid dose of bitter dark chocolate and a rich sweetness of raisins and dates. The coffee character is there, but it takes a backseat to this one. There is a touch of heat from the increased ABV, but it helps to enhance and balance the flavor profiles. Very smooth in mouth, with a transition to a clean, dry finish. Very well made brew. Roasted and slightly boozey aftertaste, with a mocha twist. This is a great beer!"
"O: Solid brew. I'm not an expert on the style, but I didn't find this as anything special. I'm glad to have tried it and enjoyed it, but the carbonation and acid taste take away from what should be a mellow experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A complex beer needs balance to broaden its complexity. This beer achieves this balance. Smuttynose is an excellent brewer. I have never had a mediocre beer from the brewery. This is one of my favorite beers from the brewery. I may buy another bottle to cellar."
""
""
"Roasted malt and coffee bitterness up front. Dark fruits and milk chocolate sweetness fills up the palate. Cocoa nib bitterness and licorice mix in. Light notes of malted milk and caramel. Woody, herbal hop bitterness comes on toward the finish and mixes with the roasted coffee nicely. Very nice! Medium-full body with a smooth, creamy feel. One of the better Baltic porters I have had."
""
"Pours a deep black with tan head. Looks more like a barrel aged stout. Awesome barrel alcohol booze and roasted malt aroma...slight chocolate. Taste is very boozey bourbon barrel with roasted bitter and slight chocolate notes. I cant believe this hast been barrel aged. Its awesome. Well worth the sub $6 price tag."
""
""
"The finish was clean just as the initial taste. So, from beginning to end, tis beer was so very nice start to end."
"O: Without a doubt, one of the best for the style. Didn't expect the full, rich mouthfeel and was delightfully surprised. This one is great right out the gate, and I can see this one aging beautifully. A must-try"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the few from the Big Beer Series that I actually enjoy. I love plenty of their regular offerings, but have found many from this series ho hum and bland. However, this is very good, and recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really nice, a special beer if its firing on this many cylinders after 2+ years. Really glad I got to try this one. I've had this one and Uintas Sea Legs relatively recently, and while I think I like Sea Legs a bit more, Smuttynose's offering is quite obviously more robust than Unita's. A dynamite Baltic."
""
""
""
""
""
"You can't see thru this. You can't. Opaque as the pants I wore to my wedding. Here's the kicker in tow: the head doesn't pretend to be white. Straight deep brown. Smell is what you'd expect from a porter: toffee, coffee, dark. Taste simply cannot be written home concerning. Tasty? Yes. Notable? Surely not. Mouthfeel just ain't porter. Carbon conquers cream. I won't admit this is a poor beer, but it doesn't hang with superior porters."
""
""
"O- very good porter. Nice roastiness with enough sweetness to balance it nicely."
""
"Overall, absolutely fantastic Baltic porter, and beer in general. I love this beer. The only other Baltic I've had that comes close to this is Sinebrychoff, and that's a tad hard to find around me. I'll also add that this beer is EXTREMELY cheap, just under 6 bucks for a bomber. If you see this or Sinebrychoff and want to know how some classic Baltics taste, you know what to do."
""
""
""
"O: ""Big Beer Series"" is aptly named. The flavor is bold. The gravity is high. And the alcohol is loud. You need to be a fan of porters to enjoy this beer. It's all about sweet and charred malt flavors."
"Overall – Quite a delicious brew. Medium sweetness with a thick body and a nice roasted flavor profile. A very nice cool weather sipping brew."
""
""
""
"Overall: typically I disregard smutty nose because I've had to many bad beers by them. This is just a really solid Baltic porter though. It's a little boozy but I have another bottle I'm aging until next winter where I expect an even better version if this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: interesting, not bad, but more like a brown ale than a Baltic porter."

"Pours a thick, dark black with a dense mocha head that fades to a thick collar and wispy streaks of lace. Nose of caramel malt, licorice, baker's chocolate, pine, and brown sugar. Medium thick, moderate carbonation, full on palate with a sweet, sticky finish. Flavor is sweeter than expected, more chocolate, licorice, raisin, rich malt and only trace bitterness on backend finish. Also still has a little warming booze in the finish."

"O: this one is damn near perfect for me. this is my first offering by Smuttynose, and this one is very well done. The big foamy head that never seems to dissipate, the amazing balance of its components in both the nose and the taste is great, and the ABV is spot on for this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fantastic interpretation of the style with all the flavor, booze, and body that you want. Well done, Smutty!"
"A nearly pitch-perfect example of a Baltic porter. Great balance of sweet and smoky."
"This is a monster of a porter, super flavorful and complex, I'm really digging this."
"O- vrooom, vroooom. Whats that? I just ran to my local store to strip the shelves of the best Baltic porter ever made. Try this and you will agree. A combination darkened fruit and caramel tones make for a great treat in the winter time in the northeast (or summertime of the northeast)"
""
""
"Pours a black color with a small ebony head. Foam fades quickly. Smells of coffee, raisins and hints of chocolate. Malts are also noted. Taste is quite smooth for the alcohol content of this. Nice hints of dark fruits with a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Overall, a nice drinkable after dinner beer. Ages nicely."
""
""
"Overall as good as any Baltic porter I've had: Smutty's Baltic Porter is indeed a world-class beer. Flawlessly crafted, it has excellent aroma, taste and mouthfeel; looks great too. Wish I had bought another one to tuck away for a year."
"Overall (4.5): Plenty have said it already about Smutty's Baltic Porter, and I have to agree with them: this is a world-class beer. It has virtually no flaws–an excellent aroma, taste, and mouthfeel and looks great in the glass. Impressive and imposing. But don't be intimidated. Buy it if you stumble upon it at your local store."
""
""
""
"This was damn good. A big beer that really packs a wallop."
""
""
""
""
"O: Rich, sweet, chocolaty porter. Great dessert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable, very pleasant. I'd love to get another bottle. And the bottle art was pretty cool, too!"
"Palate is oily and warm."
"Medium-full bodied with medium carbonation. Finishes fairly dry. Maybe a touch lighter and bubblier than I’d have wanted, but pretty tasty overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: sounds like this beer should be somewhere between the and English porter and a Russian stout - flavor imitates geography? Well, I'd say this beer hits that mark pretty spot-on: it was like a slightly lighter imperial stout, slightly more on the dry (rather than sweet) side"
"Wow, what a great baltic porter. Nice and dark and rich in appearance. Smells great, like dark fruits, chocolate and coffee. The taste does not disappoint! The flavors mimic the nose with a light touch of char, nice coffee (not too much) and a wonderful vanilla/chocolate taste. Super glad I picked this one up as it is the first time I have seen it. I will be going back to get a couple more to enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Extreme smooth, drinkable, and tasty. A fine treat; one of my favorite porters. I don’t think I’ve ever had a Baltic porter I didn’t enjoy, but this one is truly wonderful. Decent price as well."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is just about a perfect beer. Sadly, I haven't had much experience with Baltic porters, but if this is any indication, it's a marvelous style. For such a dark, heavy beer, it's amazingly drinkable and refreshing. Bravo!"
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasty malt and dark fruit aromas. Taste is the same with a nice roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a nice balance of roast and fruit aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
"O: Glad to have tried it fresh. I look forward to try it aged, as I have a bottle from last year as well."
"O/D - This one is great. The balance of malt, sweetness and bitterness is among some of the best beers I've had."
"Overall this is a solid beer and I assume it's pretty representative of the style."
"o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic baltic porter; I was pleasantly surprised. I have no good reason as to why I never drank this, but didn't realize it had such a good score until I came to type in my review. I thought it was supposed to just be an average porter but turned out to be one of the better baltic porters I've had. Looks great, has a near perfect mouthfeel, and has a ton going on in the taste. Not sure how much ""aging"" it helped as it is probably 1.5-2 years old at this point, but it's drinking near perfect. As normal, non-barrel aged baltic porter's go (still like Dark Knight and BBA Shipwreck the best), this might be the best one I've had....I like it more than the Ølfabrikken Porter. Would like to have it again."
"O- Definitely a sipper. Kind of wonder if a year of aging would even things out in this one. A bit overpowering, but maybe it's what a true Baltic Porter should be."
""
"O - a very flavorful version of the style. All flavors are there in balance and seem to be highlighted nicely."
""
"O- pretty much perefect. Inviting from start to finish and a very sublime brew. It falls just short of perfection in its complexity, but makes up for it in it's awesome ability to perform exactly what I think the brewers wanted it to: a sublimely rich and smooth Baltic Porter"
""
""
""
""
"I would buy this again as it is so easy to appreciate this well made brew."
""
"Overall. What a great tasting brew. Maybe not the most mind blowing, but an excellent beer I would have again anytime over many others."
"Dino hooked this up in our trade, thanks man! Bottle notched 2012 poured to Duvel tulip. The beer pours a deep rich dark brownish black with a nice 2 finger mocha tan colored head with nice retention and lacing throughout. When held to the light the edges are a deep mahogany. The nose is a rich blend of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, with hints of vanilla. No alcohol detected. Smells great. Similarly the taste is dominated by the roasted barley and coffee flavors immediately. The chocolate, vanilla, and malty sweetness soon follows are present a full bodied and enjoyable beer. Mouthfeel is supreme, excellent creaminess. Again, no hint of alcohol whatsoever. Finishes with a mildly sweet, though not overly so, flavor with a mild bitterness of the tongue. Overall, to say this was a treat is an understatement. Best Baltic I've ever had. Highly recommended."
""
""
"Smuttynose Robust Porter is one of the best American porters I've ever had. I guess it makes sense that Smuttynose Baltic Porter is similarly great. I should age one of these."
"22oz bottle, 2012 release. Pours black with just a tinge of dark brown, but still opaque. A pillow of light brown, creamy head holds good retention and leaves some nice chunky lacing on the glass. Aromas are bold with dark chocolate and coffee filling the nose. Tastes are also bold with rich dark chocolate and coffee dominating the palate. Mouth-feel is thick, creamy, and smooth. Finishes slightly peppery. Alcohol is non-existent and this is incredibly easy to drink. One of the better beers I've had in awhile!"
""
"O – Damn fine brew here with great taste and balance. Sweet but not cloying. My favorite baltic to date. Must get more. Go get em."
""
"Overall: Solid all around. The water makes it unique. Big without being over the top in any way. Nicely balanced."
""
"Overall: I need to pick up some more of this beer on an annual basis for nights such as this. It's really an excellent beer and receives all of the accolades it has received on this site. Excellent all around, and the only thing that could foreseeably slow anyone down is the weight, but that's what I want in a beer that has a Father Time/Grim Reaper that looks like it's going to kidnap the child on the label."
"Overall - Definitely a big porter, but lacks some of the complex dark fruit flavors evident in the classic examples. A nicely made beer, but a bit off style wise."
"The nose is not very strong at all. The flavor profile includes a mild chocolate flavor with some dark fruits and perhaps a touch of coffee bitterness at the finish. Not nearly as roasty as I would like, but a solid effort nonetheless."
""
"This is definitely a winner...a must-try if you haven't yet. Think I'll buy 2-3 more and cellar for a few years...If I can wait that long :)"
""
"O- A great Baltic Porter, the roasted and fruity flavors are done very well, this is a really delicious beer."
"Notes: This beer is one of my top 25 personal favorites. I can't praise it enough. No hype, just a great beer at a great price ($6 bomber) with wide distribution. An absolute must-try."
"One of my personal, favorite tasting porters. For what its worth, this is an incredible beer. Been wanting to try it for a while and was pleased to do so. Well worth a try."
""
"Overall a very solid beer indeed. Also a great value at $5.99 for the bomber. I'm not sure I like this as much as some, but I'll definitely drink this again."
""
""
""
"O: Awesome brew from smuttynose. Quintessential Baltic porter. Different flavor profile from RIS (More hops, less roasted). Highly reccomended, would love to do a vertical with a few of these and see how it ages. Must buy."
""
"Lingering sherry notes on the palate. Very easy to drink throughout. Complex beer but still very approachable and delicious."
"O- can't believe this beer is so good and affordable at the same time. Love this one."
"""I want to brush my teeth with it""!"
"O: a great example of the style i was really impressed with this. had it on draft a the Capital Alehouse in Fredricksburg after a night of inventory at Total Wine a great way to end the night."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - really nice, this has obviously aged well and the raisin and sherry notes only add to the complexity of an already dense beer."
"Overall: not too bad. Thick like most baltics and fairly drinkable. A little oily in the finish"
""
""
""
""
"Overall an excellent product. I am new to the New England breweries, but this is the best regional brew I have had to date. Highly recommend it. Cheers!"
"OUTSTANDING, MUST TRY!"
""
""
""
""
"Great stuff."
""
""
""
""
"Wow, this is one amazing beer from Smuttynose. Pours a deep dark black with brownish highlights. A nice chocolate milk colored head tops the brew with decent lacing. The smell is an enticing bouquet of roasted porter goodness, with a nice dose of dark fruits. The flavor is pretty bitter but still rich with dark chocolate and lots of fruits and nuts. The mouthfeel is a soft, yet full and rich. The perfect baltic porter."
""
"O-Another great Baltic Porter. Not as good as the Long Trail, but marginally."
""
"So, the beer's got an incredible price ($5.99/22oz bomber), and it isn't ridiculously over-hyped...so I'll actually be able to grab it off shelves & count on more being there next week. Profound concept. I would highly recommend this beer and already plan on getting a few more bottles myself."

"All in all a wonderful beer and one of the best porters you can get for a great price (5.99 for a bomber)."
""
""
""
"D: The lighter (for a big porter/stout) body and somewhat masked ABV make this fairly easy to drink, I generally nurse my big stouts/porters but I found myself almost gulping this down."
""
""
""
"O: Overall I thought this was a really good beer. I'm glad I got this one because it was a random pick-up. I would buy this again and recommend it to others. It would go great with some grilled steaks or something. Very tasty."
"Pours Dark Brown with a foamy brown head with a good amount of lacing left on the glass. It is sweet and malty with a hint of chocolate and a little roast, as well as a touch of Dark fruit, light smoke, faint hint of a hop finish. Medium to full body, Delicious. so far my favorite of the Big Beer Series, although this is only my 3rd one."
"Poured into a 20 oz Duvel tulip glass. Poured slowly down the middle of the glass and got a huge four inch dark tan head, that has excellent retention, and leaves lots of lace on the glass. Smell is dark chocolate, leather, raisins, tobacco, and coffee. Taste is very well balanced with each of the flavors in the nose, very big flavors, but nothing dominates. Body is thick and creamy, like no other Porter I have ever had. Plenty of life, on the dry side, and drinkable for a large ABV beer. This is a great beer and a must try if you love porters."
""
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was a great beer of the style. It had lots of flavors coming out in it but managed to bring everything together nicely. Excellent beer overall"

"O/D-Smuttynose's beers are up and down with me. Some of their Big Beer Series I really wasn't a fan of. However, this company knows how to brew some seriously awesome porters. This is up there with Finest Kind IPA as the best of their beers. Big, complex, rich, and delicious. Great beer, and at $5.75 a 22 oz., this is a relative deal."

"This is an excellent beer. The ""baltic"" elements are just enough to earn the name. It could almost land in the Imperial Stout zone. I look forward to having some, and would lay some down annually if I had the chance."
"Tasted of dark roasted malts with a complex fruitiness and bitter chocolate. Very thick mouthfeel with sweet, smooth finish. One of the best!"
"Drinkability and Overall Impression: This one is excellent for drinkability. None of the flavors overwhelmed and the complexity, along with the dry finish invites one to take another sip, and then another sip. I’ll certainly be looking for more of this beer in the future. My overall impression is that this is a truly excellent beer that is very well made and there is no question in my mind that it has earned its high ratings."
"Taste has roasted coffee, creamy dark and milk chocolate, and red cherry notes. Dark fruits underneath. Alcohol isn't noticed. As it warms and thins a bit, the chocolate fades into the background leaving a somewhat bitter roasty finish. Excellent example of the style."
"O: A really rich and bold sipper. Great complex flavors and very smooth. One of the best of the style."
"OVERALL: This is a solid, solid imperial porter. Great flavors, balanced, with lots of complexity. The flavor profile really moves from beginning to end as well. The look is no better than average and the feel could definitely use some beefing up, but otherwise this is an enjoyable brew. Thanks again guys for doing the legwork. Recommended."
"O - A good Baltic Porter, not outstanding but solid. A tad overcarbonated but not too bad."
"This lived up to my expectations and am happy I have a couple more to enjoy."
"Taste is medicinal when cold, moxie, amaretto, hazelnut. Chocolate malt and roasted coffee beans as it warms. Fruitcake, fermented raisins and more coffee. Sharply carbonated, greasy mouthfeel. Dry finish. Doesn't linger on the palate. Clearly a porter, not one that blurs the lines between a porter and a stout."
"Pours black color with a large frothy brown head that was lasting with excellent lacing. Heavy toasted dark chocolate, coffee and dark fruit aroma. Medium to full body with a thick smooth texture and flat carbonation. Heavy toasted sweet malt bittersweet flavor with a medium to heavy bittersweet finish of long duration. This is a standout porter."
"D-I really wanted to like this one but couldn't get past the very overwhelming roasted bitterness."
"O: Smuttynose's Baltic Porter is a classically rustic presentation of the style. It's well done, though I bet this would be even better on a nitro-tap."
"Overall: Really tasty beer from smuttynose. I love baltic porters and this beer is better than average. Cheers!"
"O- This beer was a surprise to me, really complex, the aroma was slightly better than what it actually tasted like. Solid porter but not one I would revisit any time soon."
"O: Very enjoyable beer overall. Perfectly balanced and 100% traditional porter, great stuff."
"O - A great Baltic Porter, wish I had picked up some more while it was still around. This is a tad sweeter than I'm used to but a little heat made this beer much better."
"Damn fine beer and one of my favorite styles."
"O- This is a pretty big beer with a nice alcohol component that really worked. The booze helped smooth out some of the roast and more harsh flavors to bring everything together. For the value ($5.99) this may be one of the best beers I have had in awhile. Though it doesn't quite stand up to some of its imperial stout brethren, this was by far the best Baltic Porter I have had."
"Drinkability: Its a really great beer and a reasonable value. Maybe a bit too big, dark, hoppy, and roasty for style, but I'm no expert."
"I've found precious little to fault with this beer and, as with Really Old Brown Dog, I'm ashamed for having passed on it so many times. Highly Recommended."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Pours almost black, with a brown head, initially towering above the beer with massive bubbles which eventually settle. Big fat, lacing and a creamy head is retained. Nose holds some chocolate, caramel, light brown sugar that's pleasant and understated. Taste echoes the nose with some velvety milk chocolate, some roastiness, brown sugar and hints of vanilla. Mouthfeel is silky and creamy, relatively full with no alcohol detectable. I love the balance and contrast between the brown sugar and sweetness with the roastiness in this one, it just feels great. Quite impressed for picking this up on a whim."
"I thoroughly enjoyed my first glass of this excellent baltic porter. Not surprisingly, it was a bit of a challenge to finish the bomber, I wish I had a friend or two around with which to share this big and rich porter."
"Pours a black. Really black. Huge head, mocha colored bubbles cascade down glass. Scent is not huge, not like I expected, subdued. Tastes like the crust of an artisan black bread. Roasted malts, but that bready flavor keeps coming. Mouthfeel is thinner than you'd expect, not bad. Overall, really nice Porter."
"O - Really quite good. I like the acidity, which ostensibly comes from stale grains. If this is a quintessential baltic porter, I want more!"
"Overall a nice representation of the style. Too much molasses flavor, but otherwise spot on."
"D: Great drinking porter. Strong, but you don't realize it when you're drinking it. Wish this came in 12oz bottles"
"A great beer but the hops are a bit too much in my opinion so it may improve with some age on it. But either way, really good stuff."
"Excellent. I'm going to be sipping on this bomber and loving it."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a serious head of beige foam. The aromatics are rather smoky with some caramel and a touch of soap in the background. The taste is pretty darn good there is a moderate mixture of smoke and roast. I actually detect a bit of lactose in the flavor as well. The distinct soured milk flavor is actually rather welcome with the roast in this version of the style. I like this beer, I find it to be very good. This isn't the best of the style that I've had in the past. I do however think that there is something missing here, and I don't know what that is. This beer is close to being great, but it's not there yet."
"D - The drinkability is good. This is a great baltic porter. The taste is just amazing. I really enjoyed it. It was smooth and very easy to drink. I definitely recommend giving this one a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
"Cheers!"
"Baltic Porter is easily one of Smuttynose's finest beers. I'm actually a little surprised that it's as good as it is. It's chock full of explosive flavor, and delivers in just about every way. The nose could use a little more volume, but that's really my only complaint. Overall, it's an easy-drinking, delicious beer. Highly recommended."
"Pours black with a one-finger brown head. Quickly goes away. Aroma of espresso beans, dark chocolate and molasses. Nice. Big roasted malts to start. Espresso and dark chocolate pick up in the body. A nice cream flavor as well. Dark fruits and an acidic note to a lesser extent. Dry hops give this beer a pretty quick finish. Big tasting Baltic Porter and very well constructed."
"Says bottle conditioned in 2009. So I guess it's 2 years old. Thanks to Schreibeers for the trade. Pours pretty much black with thin tan head. Smell up front is coffee and chocolate, a hint of caramel and maybe something fruity. The taste is great coffee, chocolate, not to much carbonation. Just the right amount of bitterness. Truly a great beer."
"D: An amazing and highly addictive Porter. I've had plenty of porters that were concentrated on the ""roastiness"" side, this dark fruit character makes you want to drink plenty. Flavor, mouthfeel, aroma, this beer is very drinkable."
"Drink is good, light booze, little sticky, nice bitterness"
"D: Very drinkable beer and probably the best Baltic porter I've had to date. This beer goes down very easily with no unpleasant aftertastes or strong alcohol burn. Overall, an amazing beer."
"Overall- I love to savor this for as long as I can since we don't get it around here. This is probably my favorite baltic porter. I can not get enough of this. HAVE. TO. GET. MORE."
"poured from a bomber into my pint glass. this beer pours pitch black with a nice thick mocha color head. the smell is roasty malty sweet with hints of dark fruit and a slight hint of alcohol. the taste is very close with the dark fruits being more pronounced in the flavor than the smell. this beer has a full mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. this beer is very very drinkable. This beer is absolutely amazing and i have never tried it until now. its a real sleeper as most people would likely walk by it, but don't. buy 2 today and drink one now and cellar one as i will be cellaring a few to see how they are with some age on them. they definitely seem like they could improve with age."
"M/D) Full bodied beer. The body is heavier then most porters; more stout like. Slight prickle from carbonation on the tongue. The drinkablity of this beer is also more like an imperial stout then a porter. One of these is enough. This is a good nightcap or dessert beer and not really sessionable."
"Full bodied, a little rough at first but goes down smooth.n Alcohol provides a warming kick at the end. Overall a decent strong porter for a cold and windy winter night such as this."
"Black beauty with a brown head on her shoulders. Strong coffee, chocolate, malt smells with a matching taste profile. There are enough hops in there to balance the sweetness and keep it from being one-sided. The body is not too thick as you may think, the carbonation lifts it from being considered cloying. Nice beer."
"This beer is nothing short of spectacular. Dark color with a head color that tend toward brown. Slight chocolate ans prominent sweet notes. We enjoyed it as a desert beer and liked it so much we stocked up at the local bottle store. A seasonal selection so dont miss the opportunity when you find it."
"D: A nice sipper on a cold night. Definitely a beer I would seek out and drink again."
"D: Very difficult to put down a large bottle in one sitting. The alcohol is not masked very effectively as it is in some other examples of this style."
"Pours a very dark brown getting close to a black-out, creamy medium brown two finger head forms and then settles to a quarter inch leaving wisps of sticky lace. Smell: rich roasty aroma, baker's chocolate, raisin, black plum, earthy, leafy and slightly lemony hopping. Taste: big time roasted grain with burnt edges, semi-sweet dark chocolate, raisin, date bread. Enough earthy hops to cut through the sweetness. Mouthfeel: medium to full bodied, creamy carbonation upfront, alcohol starts to cut through mid sip but still really nice. Drying finish leaves sticky and slightly boozy chocolate behind. Really tasty and almost flawless. 2010 edition."
"D: Good drinkability. Tasty and smooth with some good boozy warmth. Great for a cold winter night!"
"Drinkability: Goes down exceptionally easy. Very little alcohol flavour. A little too sweet for my own personal taste. Overall, a very solid beer."
"D: Excellent. This is going down fast notwithstanding the high alcohol."
"D- totally drinkable. taste is spot on, not too heavy, well rounded. i wouldnt wanna pound this in the middle of the summer at a cookout but fantastic nonetheless"
"Small dark brown head. Medium carbonation. Clear dark brown color. Aromas of coffee and molasses. Molasses, some chocolate, dates. Slightly bittersweet finish. Medium body. Warming ethanol."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours very dark brown with about a finger of light tan head that settles down to a creamy layer of foam that sits through the whole drink. Really fruity aroma, I kind of get raspberries and dark bitter chocolate. Toasty dark malty flavors with a slightly bitter coffee flavor to round it out. The feel is pretty good, it's fully and creamy with soft carbonation. Drinks nicely also. One of the best of the styles that I've had."
"Bottle. Poured into a Duvel tulip glass a dark brown color with some reddish mahagony highlights. Nice tan head that collars around the rim but fades rather quicker than I had expected. Nice aroma of dark chocolate, slight roast, and brown sugar. I really am hoping this thing tastes just as good as it smells! Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Very smooth drinking is the first thing that comes to mind for me. The dark chocolate notes are sweet with very little bitterness. Some dark fruit notes as well blended into the flavor. A hint of smokiness/roast as well in the finish. Overall, pretty pleased with this one."
"D- A fantastic beer. Baltic Porters are one of my favorite styles and this beer was crafted exceptionally well. The silky smooth mouth-feel was out of this world"
"Poured from bomber into dimpled glass. Pours a very dark brown color with a nice sized foamy, tan colored head that leaves nice rings of lace around the glass. The aroma is nice and shows dark chocolate, toasted caramel, roasted coffee, and bittersweet cocoa. Some earthy hops come through as well. The flavor is just as malt forward as the nose lets on with rich chocolate and sweet caramel up front followed by roasted coffee, and some earthy hop bitterness. Medium to full bodied and really smooth and easy drinking with good carbonation with a lingering roasty finish."
"The beer pours a darkish brown color with very good head retention and considerable, dark, mocha colored lacing. The nose is likewise attractive, consisting of coffee grounds, dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla. While the flavor profile replicates the nose, there just more of everything on the palate. The intensity of flavor is very impressiv in this beer, and the moderate sweetness (balanced nicely by the underlying hops) seems perfect for the style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a long, somewhat dry and slightly bitter finish. There is some nice milk chocolate in the finish as well that I really like. Drinkability is good, though you can sense the alcohol is on the high side in this well crafted beer. Still, this is a delicious, well made baltic porter that was a pleasure to enjoy on draft."
"D - This is actually very drinkable for as dark as it is. I would definitely be better with some age on it."
"drinks rather well with some booze heat throughout, but not harshness. very flavorful and impressive."
"Now we're talking. For $6 range Smuttynose has delivered a tremendous value of a Porter. Poured a slow to emerge 2"" head which took quite a while to settle down to a trace. Looks dark as coffee of course. Fantastic smells and tastes heavy on the chocolate side and light on the coffee side. Not as rich as a Russian Imperial Stout but hanging right in there."
"Pours engine oil black with full head of brown foam that settles into a thin layer. Rich roasted smell like a cup of coffee. Chocolate hints. Thick Chewy taste. Roasted but fruity tones - dark fruit. Smooth and creamy. Light residual bitter taste, very balanced. Plummy. Full of flavor good drinker."
"D: high for a high abv....loving this one, can see myself buying 4 or 6 packs of this"
"Overall, I'm not a big fan of Baltic porters in general but if Baltic Porters are your thing, this is certainly something you might like. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is thick and rich but still drinkable and doesn't get too assertive until it warms up to room temp."
"Enjoy."
"Drinkabity-Quite drinkable, a bomber goes pretty quickly."
"D: Very drinkable; alcohol is well hidden and even if the taste didn't wow me, this is a well balanced beer with no elements getting out of control (as it seems like sweetness easily could have)."
"This is one hell of a porter, a definite winner from Smuttynose. A must have for every porter lover. Highly recommended."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is very full and silky smooth. This was exactly the beer I was hoping for this morning. A very easy to drink treat from start to finish."
"D - Well overall I would say its the best porter I ever had! And very affordable for 6 dollars a bottle. In a way my review is kind of construed due to the fact I had an Old Rasputin before sampling!"
"D: A very nice baltic porter which is a nice winter sipper, but it could use a more powerful presence of roast in the aroma and flavor. Still, solid all the way around like Smuttynose offerings always are."
"Medium to full feel with a modest level of carbonation. This brew is quite drinkable. It coats the inside of the mouth with a burnt layering of grains. As fitting as the label states, this is a bold brew with the abv right out in the open."
"22 ounce bottle, from November 2010. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch and a half tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, caramel and dark fruit. I think the brew tastes just like the aroma, but with the roasted malt, dark fruit and coffee flavors being the strongest. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's creamy and rich with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is amazing, it's very smooth and goes down quite easy. The 9% ABV isn't noticable at all in the aroma or taste, which also helps make this beer easy to drink. I think this is a fine Baltic Porter, and a great overall brew too. Definitely recommended, and a great deal at $5.99 a bottle."
"If you like big dark chocolatey stouts with noted of coffee you will like this Baltic Porter from Smuttynose. Very nice!"
"D - Practically perfect. A great balance of flavor and BIG BEERness to make this a fireside sipper or a more regular drink."
"Drinkability: Yep, without question this ones smooth and dangerously drinkable at 9.0%(2010 version). One on top of the other in one sitting is not a problem. By far my favorite offering from Smuttynose. Well done guy's."
"Drinkability is great wonderful favorable hell even affordable what more could you want. Don't know if I was just in the mood for this but finding it excellent."
"D - Very tasty and will have a second. But the style leads to not having too many."
"Nothing short of outstanding."
"It's quite drinkable for such a big beer. I'm downing the 22oz. bomber all by my little ol' self with no trouble what so ever. I don't have another, but two would probably be too much for me. This is a great beer for the end of the evening on a cold winter's night with my pipe clenched between my teeth."
"D: This a little heavy on the dark fruit taste for me, but an enjoyable beer nonetheless. I will be sure to grab this next year as well."
"Overall impression: This one caught me by surprise. Excellent brew."
"22 oz bottle. Pours black with a thick, brown, long lasting head. The aroma is chocolate malt, dark fruit and brown sugar. Full body, some tartness. The flavor is chocolate, coffee, dark fruit. Fruity sweetness nicely balanced with coffee bitterness. Finish is enormous, long lasting and very balanced. Simply great!"
"draft at ChruchKey"
"Possibly my favorite beer of winter so far, and it's not even winter! And that includes Bitches Brew."
"D: How did beer escape my attention all these years? This my be my new favorite Smutty brew... even better than the IPA (which is a bit overrated IMO)."
"the year of aging has mellowed out any booziness from the 8.7% abv that the 2009 version was. great complex brew that only got better as it warmed."
"Overall Smutty did a nice job with this year's batch, and I highly recommend this to porter lovers and dark beer enthusiasts. Perhaps I'm finally sunsetting my IPA jonze until springtime..."
"After a bit of trepidation at the start for the overpowering bitterness, the beer settled down, and finished out nicely balanced though the bitterness is always evident. The 8.7% ABV is well hidden until inebriation sets in."
"Smuttynose, if you see this, please consider making BP one of your regulars!"
"this is smokey and digestive but rich like a dessert. i would still recommend food with this. something hardy to back it. particular pork as meat or goulash. goat may work well too. even something pickled to change the palate up a bit. but a dense beer made for dense food."
"D - This is a fabulous beer. I'm glad I finally picked one up on a trip."
"D: I didn't have trouble putting down a bomber of this, but I think it would be best served in a 12oz bottle."
"Drinkability: Pretty solid: it's a solid beer, and a bit of a sipper, but it generally represents the style (it should be a little bit lighter, less roasty, and less hoppy). It's quite tasty though, and really nicely malty. Worth trying."
"Bottled in 2009. Poured into a Great Divide glass jet black with a thick foamy three finger tan head. Good lacing and retention. I can't get much of a scent because it's allergy season. The taste has notes of dark chocolate, carmel, and smoke. It's rather odd because the taste is very powerful yet the mouthfeel is slighty thin. Nothing that takes anything away from this Porter. The alochol does leave a slight burn in the aftertaste."
"D: This isn't very boozy and I could go for another."
"Thick and rich, this is a great sipper. I'm going to revisit this one on a cold winter night."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied with a crisp finish. Very easy drinking with a well masked almost 9% ABV."
"Notes: I have to say that I love this beer. I love big complex dark beers and this one delivers!!!"
"D - the strength of the flavor and feel might limit how many you could have, but you certainly want many."
"This is an excellent beer, great flavor, pretty easy to drink, though it is filling."
"D--Love smuttynose, lets party!!! Highly recommended."
"D- a sipper for sure. Open this one when you have the time to enjoy it. I had no problem killing the bomber."
"Robust, roasty and sweet...chocolate and coffee with some dark fruit. Has a grassy bitterness that dries things out fairly well, but still finishes on the sweet side. Mouthfeel is decidedly full with a welcoming creamy aspect. Not smooth per say, this one still has some rough edges, but in this beer it seems to work in it's favor. Vanilla, rich molasses and even a hint of smoke comes out as it warms. Excellent, satisfying beer that the last quarter of the bottle paired ridiculously well with cheesecake."
"Overall this was crisp, sharp and smooth. A medium bodied beer with a warm alcohol presence; which increased as you progressed. This is a fabulous beer, especially for the price, worth the purchase 10 times out of 10."
"i will definitely pick this up again."
"D - Great, great beer. Was really excited to see it out of season and grabbed it without hesitation. I'll probably stock up this coming winter as it seemed to take the age pretty well!"
"D: The alcohol is fairly well hidden but this is definitely a sipping beer given its strength."
" Feels wonderful in the mouth - full up front, lighter at the finnish, but with flavor that coats and lasts. A heavy but drinkable beer."
"Another nice extra from an east coast trade. This one has been sitting in the back of the refrigerator for a while now, so I figured I should pull it out tonight. Pours a nice rich, dark brown, nearly black, with a good two inches of medium brown foam. Aromas of molasses, dark fruits and dark chocolate. Nice flavors of roasted malt, port wine and stewed fruits. A solid example of the style."
"D Decently drinkable for the style but not an easy style to drink. Would pick up again if in the mood for this style"
"Yeah, the subtle underpinnings of a sweet tasty beer packed into a darker, more robust hamper."
"Very drinkable for its breadth and depth. To be completely fair, I've had better and richer dark, strong beers. This is a very nice one, but I must have had unreasonably high expectations."
"The ashiness brings down the drinkability, but it seems about right for 8.5%"
"Highly carbonated and medium bodied. Drinks well for what it is. Overall a very decent example of the style."
"MF is a bit over-carbonated IMO, but still smooth and light. A bit dry on the finish, with some hoppy bitterness coming in just a tad. Drinkability is off the charts, this is just a damn fine BP, one of the best I've come across."
"Beer is medium body, finishes nicely, mostly sweet and a mild bitterness and roastiness at the back end. Drinkability good and mouthfeel is good."
"Excellent beer. Lots to explore, with a dome of simple good taste. Very nice."
"Overall, one of my personal favorites and regular drinkers. Fantastic job once again by Smuttynose!"
"This is not a bad beer. This is not a good rendition of a baltic porter. You can have both better beers and better baltic porters. I don't agree with the preponderance of ecstatic reviews."
"This is very full flavored and doesn't blow the taste buds out. The alcohol will limit consumption, but a bomber is a pleasure."
"D: A nice sipper. Probably my favorite Smuttynose beer to date."
"D- not easy but not hard. bolder beer for a porter, but decent drinkability for this style of beer. nice to try once might drink again if was offered to me and other styles were given that are not appealing."
"D: A huge roasty experience definitely worthy by all regards by style making for a great sipper that finishes every bit as good as it started. Solid and worthy of repurchase and praise."
"D= only the high ABV% would limit consumption. Probably great with anything from dark dessert to roasted meats."
"Drinkability - This is incredibly tasty. Just like their robust porter, but bigger! Almost too easy to drink. The higher ABV keeps this from going down too fast, although the flavor is so tempting. The alcohol is noticeable halfway through the bottle, but only acts as a compliment to flavor. Another fantastic beer from Smuttynose."
"This ""big beer"" makes for a substantive quaff on any cold New Hampshire night."
"Overall:The mouthfeel is rich, creamy, and dry. The body of the beer is medium thick and the finish is medium full. This beer has a lot of flavor, depth and complexity to it. It is very well balanced and was very easy to drink one of the better Baltic porters I have had the pleasure of drinking."
"D-really great tasting, the best Baltic porter I have had yet"
"D-Alcohol is nowhere to be found. The balanced taste makes this easy to drink. One of the best interpretations of the style."
"A more crisp baltic porter than I was expecting, and well-carbonated, which gives this beer somewhat of a thinner overall mouthfeel. Still, sticky notes of Baker's chocolate coat the palate with lots of dark, roasty flavor. Earthy hops chime in for the finish with a medium-bodied consistency. Definitely a beer I hope to encounter again sometime. Nice job, Smuttynose."
"Nice and drinkable considering the APV. I think I may actually prefer this to the Smutty RIS."
"22 oz. bottle, ""bottle conditioned in 2009."" Pours a completely opaque dark black, nice frothy light brown head, good lacing. Aroma is chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, roasted malts, and citrus. Flavor is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, a hint of alcohol, and fruity. Mouthfeel is on the closer side of full bodied, creamy, and bitter. Good beer, lots of flavors, warms well, very nice."
"SkÅL!"
"A very rich and full beer. Nice balance between dark fruit, malt and hop bitterness. The alcohol is hidden very well. I with the chocolate flavors were slightly more, but otherwise a great beer."
"Pours an opaque black (it could be brown, but, without the passage of light, there is no certainty here, brother) with a finger of solid burnt umber head that leaves only a trace of gossamer lacing behind. The nose is toffee, caramel, dark malts, figs, brown sugar, and a subtle hint of pine...and I just realized I used the word ""gossamer"" in a beer review...right on... The taste follows suit, with the brown sugar, now joined by molasses, and the pine standing out at first, with glimpses into the malts, toffee, and debutante figs coming into focus shortly thereafter. As Toto's ""Africa"" begins, I notice the body: nearing heavy, it has a good amount of carbonation, but it's just the right amount to ""guide me toward salvation"". Though somewhat chewy, the incredibly smooth finish (spiting the carbonation in a grand stroke of defiance) makes this brew one that ""will take a lot to drag me away from"". Ah, the '80s..."
"One pint at a time, but what a time it is. Savor each sip, and cozy up with someone you love, and enjoy the day. The next chance I get, I'll try this in a snifter glass."
"This is a great beer to have on hand. I am not sure what the ABV is, but I would like to cellar a few of these."
"The best American interpretation of a Baltic Porter that I have had. Damn near black in color with a large brown head that had good retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Rich, complex aroma that features the dark malt. Hints of chocolate, licorice, and raisins. A little bit of alchol lofts off the surface of the beer. The flavor is also rich and malty. Surprising amount of dark fruit comes through that compliments the bitter chocolate and licorice. Just the faintest sign of alcohol in the finish. The sweetness is a bit cloying as well. A wonderful mouthfeel that features the best carbonation for such a large beer. Soft and delicate carbonation compliments the rest of the beer perfectly. I doubt any beer in the BA Top 100 has a better mouthfeel. Drinkability is good thanks to the pleasant flavor and fantastic mouthfeel, the only hinderance is the ABV."
"Whoa, serious beer. Served with a nice sized, light tan, fine foamy head and good lace. Aroma is malty, sweet, dark ripe fruit, a bit roasty and good. Ditto flavor and all of that comes out much more boldly. Body is great and carbonation too. Finish is mainly sweet with some bitterness to temper. A bit too big to be a session, but nevertheless a major, world class brew."
"D - Very drinkable. A great dessert drink as well as a session beer for me. A little high on the abv's so I'd watch it of course.. But otherwise this is very drinkable for me! Another great beer from Smuttynose!!!"
"It's hard to put a label on porter, with so many styles out there. This one is close to stout like in its richness. Very good."
"Thanks to thechrislife for this fella."
"Full-bodied, creamy, smooth with a very slightly dry finish. Slightly warming. Good stuff, Maynard."
"D: Pretty drinkable even for a beer of this magnitude. All the flavors are there and they blend well together, really nice beer."
"Another great offering from Smuttynose, I can't wait to try the imperial stout in the cellar"
"d- look forward to every sip, delicious, another winner for the best northeast brewer"
"Overall, a very nice baltic porter. Lots of flavor and very drinkable for the abv. I think 12 oz bottles would be a much better size, unless splitting with a friend. Luckily I had a friend to enjoy it with me. I recommend this one."
"D - I'm not sure I'd need a whole 22oz of this, but a glass was quite pleasant. This is a good no-frills Baltic Porter that can serve as a baseline for those interested in investigating the style, especially with it's eminently reasonable price of $5-6."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle. The label states - ""Bottle conditioned in 2008"". Uncapped and poured into my Smuttynose shaker glass. The porter appears an opaque brown color with a good two fingers of tan foam. The nose and flavors consist of raisins, prunes, molasses, dark cherries, bittersweet and milk chocolates, plums, and caramel. Just about full bodied with ample carbonation and very little alcohol heat to speak of. If you happen to have a 2008, by all means, enjoy it now."
"D: Wow, I am definitely a big fan of this one. I usually like to split bombers of big porters and imperial stouts with comrades (like the bottle suggests), but I just made this one last an entire Friday afternoon. Thanks for another amazing beer, Jason."
"Alcohol is quite well-hidden on the palate, though after a while it begins to show itself in earnest in the head. This is likely one of the most enjoyable ""imperial"" type beers I've enjoyed as of late, with a spectacular balance of character combined with a rich decadence that perfectly suits it as a nightcap or dessert beer. And at under six dollars for a 22 oz. bottle, it is quite the bargain. Spectacular."
"D: A solidly drinkable Baltic Porter. As I said, not exactly in keeping with the style, but very well made."
"Very creamy body. Carbonation level is low. This is just silky smooth. This is a very sweet Baltic. Mild coffee bitterness present, but this has notes of vanilla, chocolate milk, and a little grape on the finish. This isn't as bold as I expected, but it is still good nonetheless."
"Drinkability- Pretty damned tasty brewski. It's fairly easy drinking and it's just chocked full of chocolaty goodness. It can get ever so slightly cloying towards the bottle of the bottle but nothing to crazy. Thanks much Aliza!"
"Smuttynose Baltic Porter is a dense, brownish black beer with a tall, dense brown head with oily bubbles. It leaves very nice, even lacing. The aroma has notes of licorice, wood resin, molasses, dark roastiness and chocolate. It's pretty full bodied, smooth, fluffy, chewy, a little bubbly and the finish is slightly acidic. It actually tastes pretty dry and it's really well balanced with some bitterness. There are flavors of licorice, wood resin, coffee and dark chocolate. The slight sweetness comes in the aftertaste along with a resiny bitterness... and alcohol. It's very enjoyable and very drinkable. You could pass this off as an imperial stout. I got this 22 for four and a quarter."
"D: I've had a few different Baltic porters and this one is easily the best. Great flavors and a nice body (rather than being thin and ""lagery"")."
"Appearance 4, Smell 3.5, Taste 4, Mouthfeel 4, Drinkability 4, Score 3.9"
"2009 vintage. 22oz. bottle served in my New Belgium Globe glass. Poured the color of cola with a frothy, 1.5 inch tan-colored head embedded with craters and ringlets. Head eventually settles into a sold skim, with spots and slashes of lacing exposed during the tasting. Nose reveals dark chocolate up front with some dark fruit in the background. Taste follows nose, with the addition of a creamy quality, as well as a metallic hint, barely detectable towards the back - still mighty tasty I have to say. Mouthfeel is medium and lively with a slightly creamy texture towards the finish. This is a really delicious beer I have to say. I can't believe I waited so long to try this. A nice sipper on a cold night and a bargain to boot at $5.99. I love this brewery."
"I could probably kill two more of these bombers and be good. This drove me to put on my Weakling ""Dead as Dreams"" record and rock out. Any beer that brings out the black metal spirit is probably good one. Baltic, indeed."
"D - It is truly on of the world's best baltic porters in my opinion."
"D - A highly drinkable Baltic Porter, very smooth and clean, with mild alcohol effect on the palate - highly recommended"
"Smuttynose makes solid beers. Though it is is not a great beer, it is a solid one that I will seek out again."
"Very enjoyable beer. Worth looking for it.. put it on the top of your beer search list!"
"D- one of the best baltic porters, not even a blink when asked to drink"
"Next Review!"
"Bottomline: this is a big, bad-ass beer that gets up every morning and eats Jagermeister covered pancakes while listening to Slayer."
"Overall a wonderful beer and, imo, a great buy at $7 per bomber. Wish it was more available in California."
"This is an excellent example of the style, absolutely tasty and full of character. The flavor is rich, the brew is easy to drink and the 8.7% abv is buried."
"Drinkability on this is on par for what one would expect for a 8.7% baltic porter. Cannot drink it all night, but would love to be able to"
"The taste seems more like a classic RIS than a baltic porter. I often find this style to have an odd sweetness that turns me away, but this one is damn nice. Good chocolate cake background with a nice balance between the dark malts and hops. The body is nearly full, and there is tons of carbonation--perhaps a tad too much but the body makes up for it. This is a very solid beer. I really didn't have any expectations and came out of this wanting more."
"The smell is really roasty. Some nice bitter chocolate and a roasted saltiness really stand out well. These same characteristics carry into the flavor. Matched with a silky smooth mouthfeel, the flavors go far. Once again, Smuttynose fails to disappoint in their big beer series. I'm really falling for this brewery."
"Looks like a struck match when poured into the glass with a thick, creamy brown froth, great retention, & above average lacing. The nose is pretty & sweet with aromas of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, coffee, alcohol, molasses, smoke, baking spices, dark fruit, & chocolate cake follow through on the palate with a pronounced roasted malt smokiness. The beer is dry, but sweet with a syrupy texture, creamy mouthfeel, long finish, and a smooth hop bitterness from beginning to end. Due to it's hop presence and roasted flavor, I could easily confuse this for a RIS in a blind tasting. From the Baltic Porters that I've had in the past, I would be looking for less of a hop presence, less of a roasted flavor, & more of a dark fruit characteristic found in traditional styles. Still, this is a fantastic beer & highly recommended!"
"Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and oily with a good tight bite from the carbonation."
"Drinkability: I jumped back and forth between 4, 4.5, and 5.0 on every single category on this beer, and I mention this to suggest that there are a lot of intangibles about this beer. It changes a lot as it warms, and I believe the whole here is greater than the sum of its parts. A quintessential Baltic porter, this one hits all the right notes with few missteps, and comes highly recommended at a very reasonable and drinkable (stylistically speaking) 8.7% abv. Excellent."
"Drinkability: Goes down very easily. Excellent, and would love to have again!"
"The only thing making me hesitate to call this an 'Imperial' Porter is that, even now that the beer has reached room temperature, it hides its alcohol masterfully. As much as it trumpets its big flavour it has managed to ditch the alcohol (or any perception of it, anyhow). I've come to expect nothing less from a brewer who has proven a master of both versatility and consistency. Another stellar offering from one of America's most stellar breweries."
"this is a huge baltic porter with tons of robust flavor. it was pretty easy to drink although a bit of a sipper at the same time. superb!"
"D - Not what I would call sessionable, but an excellent brew!"
"D- Probably one of if not the best baltic porters I have ever had. This is ridiculously drinkable. I would strongly recommend this beer if you enjoy porters or any dark beers."
"22oz bottle pours a dark black with caramal/brown two fingers foam. Smell is of dark roasted malts. This taste is much thicker then their imperial stout, so a much heavier body. Definately the best porter I have had, but I much prefer they imperial stout by Smuttynose. Quite easy to drink considering the abv%. I'm already buzzing off just this bomber. Good beer overall."
"Though there are a few relatively insignificant imperfections, this is an awesome porter."
"The mouthfeel is great, and its highly drinkable."
"Drinkability- As I said before this is a really good beer to sip or even put down a few with a smoke."
"D-quite drinkable with the smoothness taken back slightly by the hops/carbonation combo"
"Of the baltic porters I have had, this is certianly the most drinkable. The alcohol is slightly detectable but does not dominate or fatigue the palate. Most baltics seem to be really sweet and overly alcoholic; this one is not. A really nice representation."
"D - awfully rich, but still very drinkable because of the delicious taste and fluffy texture. i would seek this out again for sure."
"D- Moderate. The bomber went down with no problem. Another tasty treat from Smuttynose... which is quickly surpassing DFH as my favorite East Coast brewery. Seriously, as a NH native at heart, I am thrilled to be within the distro. of Smuttynose. Truly a spectacular beer and another notch on the well-worn belt of Smuttynose!"
"Overall I find this beer to be a pretty decent Baltic Porter, but it in no way wowed me as it has others. Worth a try."
"This is an excellent beer. It has been a long time since I have had a porter and this is one that will have me wanting to try many more. It is highly drinkable and the alcohol is masked amazingly well by the flavors."
"The feel is of this beer is medium and is not too big for a big beer. A great beer for the cool fall night and those even colder winter hibernating months."
"This is a full, rich, big beer. Feel is massive. Drinkability is very good, limited more by the strong, bold flavor (which you want to slow down and savor), rather than any perceived alcohol presence."
"I really enjoyed this and will look to grab another couple of bottles when the time comes."
"Drinkability is moderate. The rich roasted flavors and aroma are really greatly representative of the style. The heavy alcohol and stickiness is all that slows me down."
"Outro: ""Can You Tell"" by Ra Ra Riot"
"The taste is very creamy, very smooth, and dangerously drinkable at 8.7% ABV. There is a very nice cocoa powder flavor to the beer, lots of roasted sweet malts, chocolatey flavors, some slight cherry dark chocolate. There is a warming thick and chewy syrupy consistency to this full bodied beer. It is quite substantial, full palated. There are plenty of roasted notes, but the beer is very sweet. There is an oily mouthfeel going on, just a touch of the throatiness due to the high ABV, and lots are charred creaminess in the finish. This is very worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"D- Really nice brew that is packed full of roasted bitterness."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a deep opaque black with a decent dark tan head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight brown malts and cocoa, but does not do the taste justice at all. Taste is a wonderful blend of bitter cocoa, brown malts, molasses, and dried fruits, very enjoyable and complex. The beer is on the heavy side of medium, but the alcohol is not intrusive at all, a very enjoyable sipper. This is a truly spectacular Baltic Porter."
"All in all, another solid offering from Smutty's Big Beer Series."
"d: a great beer for the style and an overall great beer; i couldn't believe it when i found this at my local beer shop"
"Wow, what a tremendous brew, probably the best Baltic porter I've had the pleasure of sampling. A real treat."
"Overall) Before this I had never had a Baltic Porter. Needless to say I am very impressed with this example of the style and would love to try others."
"Poured a deep, deep brown, sluggish with good carbonation, brown head. Nose is big roasted and choco malt with dried fruits. Taste is cocoa, roasted notes, raisins, figs, alcohol and oh so good! Mouthfeel is creamy, well balanced with a big taste. Drinkability, is well, probably one of the best Imp/Baltic Porters I have ever had."
"This is a very drinkable porter that covers up the 8.7 percent ABV well. I wish I had ready access to it."
"Food Pairing: Grilled or smoked beef, chocolate and or coffee flavored rich desserts, lightly smokey, nutty and rich cheeses."
"Make Mine a Smutty!!"
"M/D - A bit silky but otherwise thin. Easy to drink and quite tasty."
"Would recommend."
"Simple one finger head of mainly tiny foam, very dark brown in color, leaves a credible amount of lacing, however, the head does not seem that interested in sticking around. Little to say about the color except that it is pitch black with no evidence of any other hue. The nose possesses great penetrating power without any sign of showing off, carob, coffee bean, dark chocolate and butterscotch meld into black raisin, date, plum fruit, thick streak of black licorice, doesn't show much esters, if you can hold off from indulging in it you can find some orange citrus and pressed flowers, hops were indeed used in making this beer. Full-bodied, sturdy and broad-shouldered, has a dense muscularity rather than just be ""big"" per se. The carbonation is made up of larger, slow bursting bubbles which fit the feel, no fine fizz or extra effervescence. Toasted malt, roasted coffee, butterscotch and cocoa, adroitly maneuvers between sweetness and dryness. Raisin, date, fig, plum, cherry and even some apricot fruit there for the taking. Again, licorice and flowers seem to be next in line. Just the right amount of bitters and grains on the finish to reset the palate for the next sip. This is close to benchmark shit."
"drinkability is great. nicely balanced, great depth. good stuff."
"I owe David a big one!"
"The drink is medium-bodied with mild carbonation and highly drinkable for the style and ABV. One more good reason to ""Make Mine a Smutty!"" anytime."
"D) A delicious porter. I'd definitely have another and pass along the good word to a friend."
"This is a deep, bold, and complex brew, a real sipper that took me a while to work my way through. Alcohol warmth is quite obvious on the finish but the alcohol itself is exceptionally well hidden within the beer's huge flavors. Darker, denser, and decidedly less sweet than last night's long trail imperial porter (which I also enjoyed greatly), this is a real treat."
"D- Not the most drinkable porter out there. I think this could improve with some short term aging, perhaps 9 months to a year. The flavors are just not integrated very well at this young stage. The ABV while high is not so high that it scares me, id say it's at the perfect size. It took some time to get through my glass. Good stuff, nothing mindblowing, yet."
"Drinkability was awesome I easily drank a couple glasses. Looking at the two years side by side, I will say I liked this years a little more than last."
"Good drinkability. Good beer overall. I'm not sure why it took so long for me to try this one, but I'm glad that I did."
"For Baltic lovers or the uninitiated, this brew belongs in your portfolio!"
"D- No way I could drink more than 2 (?) of these....but very tasty concoction here. I really enjoy the smokey booze here."
"The more I drink of this, the more I fall in love. The only knock I have is that it's roughly twice the price of some of the beers that it emulates so well. Still, $6 a bomber is money well spent."
"The flavor is chocolate with a little sweetness and a touch of coffee. The flavor is somewhat bland. The sweetness wears on me as I progress through the glass. The finish is sugary sweet chocolate. The beer is full bodied with medium carbonation and a really watery mouthfeel. Blah. I've had 10 or so beers from this brewery and haven't liked any of them."
"Thanks to atsprings for sharing a bomber."
"Full flavored, balanced, and with a mouthfeel that just absolutely nails the style. What little alcohol there is will probably get more integrated with time. This is a world-class beer from a fantastic brewery."
"Drinkability: The bottle was rather large, and the drink very filling, so I could only take one. For what it was worth, that one was very drinkable."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of aromatic coffee with notes of creamy black chocolate. Taste is very well balance between aromatic coffee without any dryness with some great creamy black chocolate notes with some subtle dry raisins in the finish. Body is quite full with a creamy texture and no apparent alcohol. Another very nice beer from a great brewer."
"Big flavor--lots of chocolate and black patent malt. Subtle (comparatively) hop finish, although the aftertaste is great blend of all of the flavors already mentioned. Full bodied with distinct alcohol warmth without being oily."
"Typical excellent Smuttynose."
"overall a top notch brew from smuttynose...i prefer this leaps and bounds over there fruity imperial stout"
"I was happy to finally see this in my local bottleshop. I've seen many other Smuttys there over the years but finally got this one, very much worth the wait. I wish I had another one or two to hold on to for a year to see how it ages. Highly recommended."
"Cheers!"
"D: Gone before I knew it. Almost didn't leave enough to review it with."
"D- Drinkability is pretty good for this ABV beer. The alcohol isn't very apparent, but this is a big beer and very complex so I wouldn't want more than one in a sitting. A very good sipper."
"22 oz. Very nice looking dark pour, nearly black with some brown head. Chocolate, molasses, peat and roast malt aroma. Flavor matches these well. Plenty of dark chocolate, roast malt and some coffee. More coffee and licorice in the finish. Thick full body, good carbonation. Gets a little more bitey when it warms for a while, only because it was still near 80 out and I drank the whole bomber. Drinkability is excellent, abv not noticeable at all. One of the better Baltic's I've had for sure."
"Drinkability: Great beer. Heavy as all hell, but in a good way. Situational sipper. I don't think I could handle more than one of these in a sitting. It's like a delicious meal that you finish, wish you would want more, but it's satisfied you enough that you don't. Great beer."
"Aroma is strong, malty, slightly smoky and chocolaty with a hint of yeast and quite appetizing. It pours an opaque dark chocolate brown, just about sable, with a very thick, if not too persistent, tan head. Flavor is chocolaty and a little sweet with an undertone of roast coffee. Texture is thick, oily and strongly tingly so it practically dances down the pipes. Recommended!"
"Enjoyed on-tap at Cole's. Aroma of chocolate, and roast. Black, but reflecting light. Brown soapy head, some alce. Full mouthfeel, carbonation is right there. Fierce chocolate is right in front, the finish is coffee, with some sourness running through mid-sip."
"Overall this is a solid effort and is my favoriate Big Beer of Smuttynose's to date. Worth a shot."
"Drinkability: A year of aging has turned this beer into a superb drinker; gone is the warmth and bitter hop flavors (not that those are all bad); but what remains is a blend of chocolate and fruit that knocks the style profile out of the park"
"NOTE - this was a 2009 bottle ... I'm betting it would be wonderful and improve substantially with some age as the heat mellows. Give it 1-2 years and I would imagine mouthfeel and drinkability to each creep up at least 1/2 a point, if not more."
"Very tasty and drinkable. Will need to stock up on a few of these before they're gone."
"Drinkability: Pretty solid: it's a solid beer, and a bit of a sipper, but it generally represents the style (it should be a little bit lighter, less roasty, and less hoppy). It's quite tasty though, and really nicely malty. Worth trying."
"D - Nice representation of style would most likely only drink one at a time as this feels very strong and more than one would be a lot."
"D- Smuttynose Baltic Porter certainly did not disappoint. This is a very tasty brew that is highly recommended!"
"22oz bottle obtained at McKinnon's in Salem, NH. Pours an opaque black body with a good half inch or so of light tan head. Chocolate, black licorice, with some banana, nut and bubblegum notes comprise the aroma. Black licorice with some banana, nut, and bubblegum notes hit the palate initially, with strong dark chocolate and coffee hitting later toward the finish, bits of vanilla throughout. On the heavier side of medium-bodied with ample carbonation to clear the palate, but not too much. One sip definitely invites another, with the complexity and medium body. Possibly the best example of the style I've found thus far, and leaps and bounds better than Smuttynose RIS. Good stuff!"
"Thanks Mikey711!"
"Pours black with a reddish tinge and and a nice full head that settles to a ring. Beautiful dark fruit, port notes, a slight roasty note, and a touch of vanilla in the finish. Very nice. Deep and well rounded flavors of dark fruit, roastiness, more vinous port-like notes, raisins, and a touch of chocolate. Textbook Baltic Porter. Exuberantly fruity as compared to a RIS, but with some of the same roastiness and dark chocolate notes. Smooth and long in the mouth. Very nice."
"Finishing off a bottle that I gave to my dad from yesterday and this beer was still great. It has a nice brown lacing and good carbonation considering the bottle had been open for a day. It's a viscous black with lots of roast and chocolate hitting the nose. The chocolate is both sweet and bitter. Very well balanced with a creamy full body. The bitterness lingers longer than the sweetness, but is very pleasant. My favorite beer by the folks at Smuttynose."
"Overall, a genuine sipper -- but one you are eager to get through quickly. The alcohol is a factor that keeps this one from being too quaffable, but that is not the purpose here. Not one that you'd swill around the barbeque, but rather the one you crack and savor at night when the rest of the house turned in for the evening. From the Smutty perspective, I take this brew Hands Down over their Imperial Stout. Grab one when available if you like big robust strong beers. Enjoy!"
"D: Very nice and pretty much all that I expect. Aroma and flavor sure as hell was on point and did not disappoint. With that said, this is a sipper and is to be taken slow and savored. This makes this brew a very nice cooler weather brew that warms and satisfies. Flavor and aroma lived up to expectations, but the alcohol was a bit heavy. This lowered my scores on feel and drinkability. Still, I would absolutely drink this again and will always be open to pick up a bottle. Another great porter, and another great beer by Smuttynose."
"A very fine beer, lots of flavor and elements going on in this beer. Definitely a sipper."
"This is an excellent regional example of the style. Very drinkable and will only improve with some age."
"This beer has many of the characteristics of a robust porter or stout, but not the flavor or aroma to match. Pours like an imp stout, super dark and viscous with a dark brown head. Not too much aroma to pick out really, just a slight toasted presence which is barely detectable from the glass. Flavor also is quite lacking, just sort of your typical roasty stout character but very, very subdued. The mouth and body of the beer are that of a chewy imperial stout, super robust and viscous, but this also highlights how lacking the flavor is. Drinkability is questionable, its not a bad beer by any means, but as I said, it is quite thick and without even the richness of flavor to back it up. Not bad, but disappointing."
"Fresh! Pours a very deep brown, borderline black in color with a small brown head. Sweet dark malts, no bitterness. Smokey in flavor with a slightly toasty malt character, subtle coffee and chocolate malt notes, more so tootsie rolls, but not ST Choklat extreme, some leafy bitterness late on the finish. Medium/full body, no alcohol heat, smooth as all hell. Amazing for the style, i will be purchasing at least 6 of these."
"Drinkability is good, since it's very delicious and complex at the same time. One of my favorites of the style so far. Cheers Smuttynose!"
"D - Too big and palate killing. Would still try. LOL."
"Thanks again Todd for the opportunity to try this one!"
"Full bodied with a good level of carbonation. Drinkability is maybe a touch higher than it should be, but that is because I am basing the drinkability on my desire to drink it again...as frequently as I can. I would gladly drink several bombers of this a night, but I am realistic and will restrain myself"
"Pours pitch black almost opaque with a beautiful one inch caramel colored head. Smells only of raisins and alcohol. First sip is bittersweet raisins with a ton of tobacco and burnt malty dark fruits. Bitter from start to finish. I have never had a beer with this much tobacco flavor."
"D: Drinking a bomber of this is pretty enjoyable. Ultimately, I find the sweetness a bit much but that's just my beef with the style rather than this beer itself."
"Just a great Baltic Porter. The best I've had so far."
"A very drinkable beer from Smuttynose. This was one of my first experiences with them and look forward to trying some more."
"Taste is as described on the bottle-very robust and rich dark roasted malt up front. There is a slight fruity aspect like berries and it finishes sweet. A little syruppy on the mouthfeel but nothing that detracts in any significant way. Definitely improves as it warms and breathes and is perfect for a cold winter night."
"Reviewed on 4/22/08. Bottle. Pours a dark black with a beautiful dark tan head that persists until the very end of the glass. Aroma of coffee and roast. Flavor of coffee, roast, chocolate, slight raisin as the beer warms. This is a thick, rich beer, very reminiscent of an imperial stout. Very creamy. Excellent. 7/5/7/4/16 (3.9/5)"
"This one really looked great in the glass. Rich black to brown with a brown/tan foamy head that disappeared fairly quickly. Smell of chocolate, smoke, and raisins in the nose and the initial taste is both rich roasted malt and a somewhat bitter nutty taste that balances the very dark roast in the nose and ends with a sudden burst of smoke (like a campfire) in the mouth and nose. Very different, complex and definitely one of those you want to savor and sip. Tasted great, no matter the temperature (of the beer). The unique lager process was obvious in the smoothness of the beer, but the smoke taste was, after half a glass, a bit much. Enjoyable, but not as drinkable as I would have liked. The alcohol wasn't noticeable with the slower pace I was drinking, but I noticed after 30 minutes or so."
"This is a great example of an American Baltic Porter. I certainly enjoy Okocim, Zywiec, and Baltika but this is not that similar. Very good stuff."
"A fantastic beer. I'm really enjoying the big beer series from Smuttynose. Kudos. Distribute to California. Now. Thanks. Go vote."
"This is starting to remind me of some favorite Baltic Porters of mine. (Though it still tastes too much like ashtray.)"
"Dark brown color, but appears black in the glass. Very large, frothy and well developed dark tan head. Vibrant nose, but lacks a bit of depth. Still has some pleasant notes of chocolate covered raisins. Flavor is very complex with notes of chocolate, pit fruit, toffee and a touch of coffee. Very nice finish as well on this bad boy."
"This is an excellent Baltic Porter and may be my favorite from the Big Beer Series with the Imperial Stout giving it a run for its money. This could be my new favorite domestic Baltic Porter. Thanks for another great beer Derek!"
"D: The booze is present but doesn't plod into the taste. The parallels between this beer and Russian imperial stouts are amazing. If I didn't know better (based on the label), I'd've rated this as an impy."
"Pours a clear dark brown, some red in the edges, thick tan head forms and drops some lace spots, settles to a thin ring, looks quite nice. Smell is good, sweet and caramelized, nuts, roast, toast, chocolate, very clean aroma, almost like chocolate milk, lots of dark fruit, alcohol is hidden. Taste is nice, toasty, lots of fruit, raisins, chocolate milk, caramel, cherries, brown sugar, very nice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, alcohol is totally hidden and this is some smooth stuff. Smuttynose puts out some great stuff at more than fair prices, I need to grab some more next time I'm in NY."
"Other than Imperial Stout, I haven't been blown away by any of the Smuttynose Big Beer Series. Baltic Porter not only gives the stout a run for its money, it just might be the best beer that this brewery has released. If you're lucky enough to have access, buy all you can carry. In fact, taking a pack horse wouldn't be a bad idea."
"fairly bitter, this one, actually. no sign of smokiness, but plenty of caramelized 'ose"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, strong kick, good representation of style, this is a nice higher-powered porter to drink for a while, but it's definitely more of a sipper than a pounder."
"Still, not bad, I'd recommend it. I found this pretty enjoyable. I bought this bottle at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee."
"Impressive. This is definitely on the short list of authentic-tasting American-brewed Baltic Porters. I'd have this again for sure."
"Just further proof of the sometimes overlooked excellence of Smuttynose."
"A-/A beer for sure."
"GratefulBeerGuy hooked me up with a couple bombers a while back and tayner hooked me up with the bomber that I just had recently...this is a terrific beer. Thanks for the chance to have this as #400, Dana!"
"Drinkability: Smuttynose always makes high quality beers and this one is no different. I got what I expected, a great dark roasted Baltic Porter. If you're ever in the mood for a thick chewy roasted Baltic Porter, then you should clearly pick us this winner!"
"Pours a very nice black color, nice carbonation, very nice small fizzy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. Then nose is big on malts, toffee/chocolate/coffee, slight vanilla, and some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, very malty, very nice notes of dark chocolate, with some caramel notes. Medium body, the alcohol is hidden very well with this one. Very drinkable, man this sucker is very tasty. Smuttynose does not disappoint at all. Highly recommended, thanks Tom and Joe."
"Big chocolatey taste, full bodied and lactic, almost more like a milk stout. Very full and roasty, rich feel, sweet enough to count as dessert. A decent amount of charred malt character without getting bitter. Some earth and grain notes, long flavorful aftertaste. It's a little too rich to session (with subtle boozy notes), but it's tasty. Again, it veers more into milk stout territory, but works great as an imperial robust porter."
"I see it was only $4 for this bomber - a darn good deal, the eastern BAs whom can get this regularly are a fortunate bunch."
"Absolutely beautiful pour gets three fingers of chocolate brown dark head. it takes a couple of minutes to fade leaving no lace. Body is a jet tar blackness. Nose is rich and full of carmel, buttered toffee, sweet honey glazed biscuits and a trace of spicey alchol. Creamy smooth as you take first sip. So well joined are the array of flavors including rich chocolate English toffee, anise, toasted sweet bread and a nice powdery spice profile. Joy is a beer such as this with complexity and balance. Alchol warms the belly but is otherwise well hidden. Mouthfeel is big, thick and richly welcome. Boldly drinkable. Goes to show why I continue to love this style more and more."
"Appears a pitch black hue, this one is like a black hole absorbs every bit of that visible light spectrum. Large dimpled thick tan head at least two fingers with a nice resiliency. Left behind are even thick scattered lacing strands with each sip. Aromatics are intense, upfront with dark roasted malt bringing together nearly burnt coffee roasts and dark bitter chocolate to the forefront. Luscious fruit from the vine ripened and soaked with fortifying amounts of alcohol, hints of berry, plum, and grape(raisins). Sultry charred wood characteristics with soft vanilla balance, a touch of sea breeze or saltiness reaches the nares as well. As the last amounts of yeast sediment find my pint glass I detect a toasted nuttiness and herbal mint quality. Flavors equally if not more so impressively mind blowing. Starts off big and sweet with malt and fruit characteristics plum and raisins namingly. After the sweetness descends along comes more burnt toffee and molasses like notes coming off rich and sugary yet fruity and complex as ever. Herbal bitterness is detected along the way but a dry bitter dark chocolate and coffee astringency definitely land a trademark on the overall flavor profile. A slow charred oak alcohol burn brings to mind the finest single malts aged to perfection, warming in your gut and tingles the throat and the sinuses. Anise and fruit notes flow seamlessly together bringing to mind old fashioned Italian cookies that go with black coffee. Mouthfeel is big and chewy coats the palate with pure girth. Loads of malt equal great texture and the yeast sediment in this bottle conditioned version really gives it some redeeming qualities. Drinkability is effortless despite the complexity and pure amount of body this beer has to offer. All aspects are a cohesive driving force in providing balance and smoothness in an intense usually abrasive style. When done right however like Heavyweight Perkuno's, Sinebrychoff, and Okocim this style provides pure bliss. Of course this year was hyped with this style, Victory brought the ""hammer"" back with their version of the style. As the widespread knowledge of that release occurred and people vied for a taste of it, this small adventurous brewer from New Hampshire decided to nail the style completely. So by chance this perfect version of the style was brewed and barely noticed while most beer folks lined up in anticipation for a taste of Perkuno's in Victory's version. This is Baltic Porter in all it's glory if you find a bottle snatch it up and sit on it, or drink it now that's up to you. Bottom line I need more Big Beers from Smuttynose, send them to the Burgh god knows we need some BIG A IPA, bring on the hops."
"2008 22oz bomber poured into a pint glass. Pours black with a nice 2inch tan head that dissolves quickly into a light lacing on the beer. Tremendous smell of mocha, dark chocolate and coffee. The taste is very rich with notes of dark chocolate and raisin. Their is also a taste of coffee and espresso lurking in the beer that finishes with some excellent sweetness of dark chocolate. The beer is smooth with a light creaminess and low carbonation which adds to a nice mouthfeel. This is a nice beer that goes down a little to easily."
"No matter what happen to this brew, I don't think this will taste much like the classic baltic porters that taste more like a mixture of fine red wine and chocolate. Give it some time, I suppose, and enjoy what might be more accurately called a baltic stout. Prost."
"Drinks great for the style & ABV. A great Baltic Porter! Smutty is probably my favorite New England Brewery & can hold their own with of the big boys"
"Overall I thought this was really excellent. I was shocked to see it rated so high, but now that I get to try it I would whole heartedly agree with this assumption. This is a very solid offering from a very solid brewer. I would love to be able to try this one again, it was really very good and very easy to sip."
"This was a breeze. A great example of the style."
"D - A nice Baltic Porter that is very true to style."
"Excellent. If I see another one out there, I would grab it."
"Pours dark dark brown with a tan head. Aroma of toffee, chocolate, caramel, and roast. Taste of chocolate, toffee, and dark fruit. Has a bitter, but not overwhelming coffee finish. Velvety mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Another winner from Smuttynose. Excellent beer"
"Drinkability waas only OK. I may not have served it quite as cool as it should have been, but it was still at about 60 degrees F, which is my cellar temperature throughout the summer."
"D: This is one of the better baltic porters I have tasted and I would seek this one out. Highly recommended!"
"The taste...Roasted malt is nicely done here followed by notes of coffee, caramel, and dark fruit. The flavours are really big but I'm surprised how smooth the overall drinking experience is. Mind you, the abv is right up there where it belongs for the style but I still find it quite drinkable as the alcohol shows itself as just some warming after the swallow. It's pretty close to being full bodies and the carbonation, I'd say, is about medium. The finish has a nice bitter coffee finish that lasts for quite a while. I like sipping on this one and it will probably take me a while to finish the bottle. Not a negative comment regarding its drinkability, more of a I don't want to see the end of the contents of the bottle. That's always a good thing. ;^) I think Smuttynose did one hell of a job here."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable, very enjoyable brew from Smuttynose."
"Pitch black with no carbonation whatsoever and nothing more than a thin pond scum head. Nose was strong black licorice anise. Taste reflects the nose; anise like black licorice; a very fat f-ing brew in the nose. Ditto for the mouthfeel. 'Nuff said. This is not a very drinkable brew. I much prefer it on tap since the nose and body are fuller and smoother than what comes out in a bomber. It's a good but not great interpreation of the style."
"Big flavor and big alcohol, but it drinks incredibly well. Luxuriously smooth and a total pleasure. Try to give it time and warming. My first one was merely OK--this time it's hitting all the right spots, the way most other Smuttynose stuff does, and certainly right in line with the high quality of the other beers in the Big Beer series. Seek it out."
"D-I am starting to love Baltic Porters and wish that more craft brewers were taking on the style. Baltics are a wonderful relaxation sipping beer and this one hits it spot on for the most part. Add in some brandy barrel aging and this one would be phenomenal."
"Cheers."
"D: Very tasty, easy drinking... quickly becoming one of my favorite styles. This is a pretty good take on it."
"One hell of a brew!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sugary, sweet up front, with bitter cocoa, ripe fruit, and toasted nuts lingering."
"Very good baltic porter...one of the better ones I've had. A fine offering from Smuttynose...well worth seeking out."
"D - Warming my stomach as I write this, and I've only had a few sips. Definitely a bottle to work on in a recliner over a rental, or, as if you're like me, Saturday Night Live."
"The body is big with a robust texture. Light carbonation feel. Overall an enjoyable beer that should age very nicely."
"22 oz., bottle conditioned in 2008 and brewed with lager yeast. The beer pours quite black, topped with a three finger chocolatey brown head of medium froth that reduces to a small cap and leaves a few wisps of lace. It sits in the glass with a regal air, giving the impression of an imperial stout. In the nose there is a lager cleanliness, with lots of dark malts, a dash of leafy hops and some late anise. On the palate, there's a big blast of chocolate, roasted and black malts that lend an espresso astringency, along with some leafy/floral and oily hops that impart a mild bitterness. Eventually dark chocolate-covered raisins emerge, riding the warming (never hot) alcohol all the way down. On the palate it almost feels too thick to be a lager, silky smooth, with fine carbonation - again, reminiscent of an imperial stout. A great lager, and one of the meatiest I have ever come across; it starts very malty, but the hops gradually emerge. The flavor is so close to a five, but it falls just a tad near the end. Regardless, one sip just begs for another and this is definitely a beer to seek out."
"Overall: The Baltic Porter is a great offering from Smuttynose. Rich and complex, but amazingly drinkable. Dangerously so at 8.7% ABV. The downside is this was a limited release so if you weren't able to score any of the bombers out there on the market you are out of luck. Unless maybe you can find a willing BA trader. If you are lucky enough to stumble across it in a store or if you are even luckier and find it on tap this is a must have."
"This baltic porter pours thick and syrupy, deep black with a thin, medium brown head, the color of coffee with 1 cream. The first aroma I got was malty along with hints of molasses/raisins. The flavor is heavy on the malts, in a good way. There were also tastes of coffee and cocoa mixed in. You taste this and know it's a baltic. The mouthfeel was suprisingly sharp for a porter at first, but mellowed a bit throughout the glass. Although it was a nice feeling, that along with the abv kind of rule this out for a session beer, but delicious to have one or two. Great offering from the Smutty big beer series."
"Final Note: last time I was at the beer store (3 days ago), there were 23 more of these left on the shelf, I bought the first one and I'm going back for more!"
"Deep, dark black in color with a nice sized cocoa head on top. Moderate amount of aroma. Black currants and mellow chocolate tinge. Has a somewhat, faint inky smell to it. Heavy dark chocolate flavor. Great taste of anise and roasted malt. Not overly harsh or astringent. Ever so slight espresso and quite grainy. Good mouthfeel. A decent Baltic Porter. A style that more brewers need to try. Well worth trying for sure."
"In addition: Having a bottle almost one year later from the vintage and it's just beautiful. Amazing beer. More spot on interpretation after it gains some age. Highly suggested."
"I wish I had bought more of this."
"Beer is good. Happy imperial beering."
"Drinkability is good. I have yet to have been let down by any of the Smutty offerings. And this one doesn't let me down either. Probably second only to Duck-Rabbit when it comes to Baltic Porters that I have sampled."
"This is a chewy beer. No better way to describe it. Its rich, thick and very, very flavorful. Dark chocolate combined with rich maltiness and a nice bitter taste of coffee and hints of licorice. They really did a great job with this new release. It will be something to look forward to each January from now on!"
"VERY rich and flavorful."
"Pours a one finger, light brown head that goes quickly and leaves a good lace. Black as midnight. Nose is slightly malty. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Flavor is roasted molasses. $3.99 for a 1L flip top bottle from Capitol Convenience Concord, NH."
"The beer is a very nice sipper and I enjoy it. I feel it is much more imp stout like than baltic proter, but just my opinion. It is a very nice beer for sure, but the roastiness wasnt expected."
"Superb mouth feel, a full sensory experience. The after taste is delicious, tongue coating, coffee, full bodied. A very nice example of this style."
"22 ounce bomber, ""Bottle conditioned in 2008", pours inky black, cafe au lait head, quickly settles and then leaves just moderate lacing. The excitement starts here with the luscious chocolaty nose and the full bodied flavor assault that is encountered on the fist sip. Be sure to allow this fresh young beer to warm up. Gobs of rich flavors here, chocolate malt balls, mocha, vanilla and light burnt smokeyness. A tasty rich chocolate milk shake of a brew. Nice. Highly recommended."
"This is a very robust and palate-exhausting beer. This is one I'd enjoy at the end of the night, but be sure you're in full control of your faculties to apprecaite this one."
"This can certainly disappear quite quickly despite noticeable alcohol. True to style and delicious!"
"This is unquestionably an extreme version of a baltic style porter. As intense as it may have been, this beer truly won me over with its grace, finesse and overall balance. Definitely the most impressive example of the style I have tried to date."
"Poured into standard shaker pint glass. Beer was a completely solid black color with a reddish brown frothy head. The head dissipated quickly and left minimal traces on top. Smell was clean, almost equal touches of wheat bread, green olives with a touch of molasses. Taste had touches of vanilla and raisin bread along with burnt coffee. Felt good in the mouth. Slightly heavily carbonated, but well coating. Easy to drink despite the reasonably high ABV, but hit quickly afterwards."
"The beer had a rich brown color. After pouring some into a glass, there was an impressive thick coffee colored head. I could smell something, but I couldn't identify it. Whatever it was, the smell was weak. When I drank it, I noticed a wide variety of flavors. Roasted coffee, malt, all with a slight bitterness. I think I picked up a little fig in there... but I'm not sure. Maybe I should have another... The beer felt rich and creamy. However, I wouldn't want to drink a whole lot of this in one sitting. It was a bit heavy to knock back more than a bottle at once."
"Pretty much black, but with ruby edges. A thick, light brown cap formed off the pour and settled to a thin skim and solid collar. Lots of spotty lacing. Rich malt aroma with plenty of roasted malts and sour cherry. Notes of bittersweet chocolate and plums were evident as well. The flavour was chocolate and malt with a cherry background. Bitterness was balanced with the malt character. Quite nutty. Finishes with a bit of roasted bitterness. Creamy, full body with smooth carbonation. There's a hint of dry astringency from the dark malts that works well. Really nice. It's got complexity that's sometimes missing from big porters."
"This beer is a good candidate for aging because I find it only gets better with a year or two on it."
"Drinkability - Excellent beer but I'm probably good for about two at the most. It's very filling."
"If I could give this beer higher than a 5.0 on mouthfeel I would. It's amazingly creamy and rich. This beer is a desert for sure. The alcohol is apparent more as the beer warms, but it's not overpowering and it's certainly not enough to detract from the beer. I hope they bring this one back next year, I'll buy a case."
"Full in body - thick, creamy, and super smooth. Not too heavy or syrupy - very nice mouthfeel. Great drinkability for a full-bodied brew. A sipper, but difficult to put down. Alcohol is noticeable, but pleasant and not overpowering. Flavors are clean and to the point. A top notch Baltic Porter."
"D: It's very good. Big bold flavors. I just wish the alcohol was more restrained. Still, it makes an excellent sipper."
"Served in a tulip, this was a black, black beer. It had a thick coffee-colored head, with lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass. It had a coffee aroma, as well as some sweet fruitiness. The coffee taste lingered well. Also some noticeable raisin/dark fruit taste. The sweet fruit combined well with the coffee, making this a mellow, eminently drinkable beer. Would drink this beer anytime, anywhere. Cool label, too."
"Very drinkable for such a full-bodied beer. I definitely put this one back pretty quickly."
"Many thanks to Xumbi for the bottle."
"This is a hard beer to set down. It's very enjoyable beer so I had to try to pace myself so I could actually enjoy it. It's not the most complex beer, but these never are. Recommended."
"Reasonably easy to drink, the taste is not complex but very pleasant, with the same chocolate, dark fruits and coffee notes suggested by the nose. Very good."
"Pours a very dark brown with about a finger and and a half of thick brown head. Aroma is quite complex, rich malty sweetness, definite caramel notes, some dark fruits (prunes, raisins, dark cherries) and hints of dark chocolate. Taste is reminiscent of the aroma. There is more roastyness in the taste. The malty sweetness, caramel, and dark fruits are still present but joined by some hop bitterness and a pronounced roasted character, that is just short of acrid, in the finish. Mouthfeel is good, very smooth with a full-ish body, a slightly noticeable alcohol presence and about medium carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, however I thought that this was certainly a bit too roasty for the style. Overall this is a damn good beer that is quite complex and very enjoyable."
"enjoyed how the flavor characteristic changed with warming. this is a fairly tasty brew. suprisingly light-bodied. might buy again."
"This is a really nice Baltic Porter. It's much more along the lines of what Perkuno's Hammer used to be and more of what I was expecting and didn't get from the Baltic Thunder. If you've the choice of the two, definitely go for the Smutty and try it for sure anyway as it's just a solid brew."
"Man, what a good beer. That's all I kept thinking as I kept sipping. Pours a diesel oil black color into the glass. The head was huge and puffy, and brown as leather. The smell was of roasted malt all the way up my nostrils. The taste was immense, with ample notes of chocolate, coffee, and black licorice all over the palate. I never thought a beer could be that ""burnt"" tasting and still taste so delicious. That might be it's only fault, its taste was so powerful it might be hard to drink more than one. And since the abv is unknown, you'll need to be careful. I kicked myself when I remembered that I only bought one. If I had known it was this good, I would have definitely bought a few more. The best in the Smutty Big Beer Series thus far."
"D: Drinkable- yes. It's a big complex beer that needs to be savored"
"Very nice beer here. This has everything you could want in a Baltic Porter. I'd also guess that this would be good with a year or two under its belt. Overall, a great example of the style and one that I will be happy to revisit in the future. Recommended."
"Definitely recommended..."
"I really like this , but a bomber is a bit too much....the intensity wore me out."
"Tremendous drinkability - had three pints and was three sheets to the wind... Highly recommended!"
"Unless it's hiding it well, I'd guess this beer clocks in roughly around 6% ABV, although I'm not at the bottom of the bottle yet. If it's any higher than that, however, it's concealed well. Definitely drinkable, although not for those that aren't fans of the style. I could probably do two in one sitting after a well-digested meal."
"Poured into my Spaten mug the brew is dark as ink and comes to a large coffee colored head . I am a big fan of the Smuttynose brewery .Coffee , chocolate and roasted malt flavor . Brown sugar , "" mapley "" flavor. After a few sips there is wonderful lacing and the Smuttynose Brewery has made another great beer . As for the ABV there is some redness to my cheeks which means by my account that is over 7% . Creamy and smooth . As with most of the "" Big Beer Series "" from Smutty this will be another that I will be more than happy to purchase . Total class from Smuttynose . Cheers ."
"Very good beer experience."
"D:Before I took a sip I was really exited about this beer. I had to abandon my half after about 5 sips. If they remove the licorice/anise from the recipe I would go back. Until then this beer just isn't for me."
"Flat black color with a light tan head. Aroma of roasted grain and baker's chocolate. More roasted malts and bittersweet chocolate in the flavor with the added character of a lager's rounded, firm, smoothness. No hot estery/ alcohol wildness here. Very nice - medium-full body with a nice dry, roasty finish. I used mine to polish off some sausages and whole grain mustard with onions, sauerkraut, pumpernickel and Appenzeller."
"Pitch black, completely opaque with medium tan head and a carpeting of lace. Mild coffee chocolate aroma. Smooth charcoal and coffee, licorice raison. Average drinkability for this style but not something I would get too carried away with in one sitting. Excellent full body. Yummy."
"Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 2"" dark brown head over the opaque dark brown/black brew. Head holds strong, with ample lacing. Aroma is rich dark grains, with hoppy touches. Taste follows along, dark roasty maltiness upfront, melded with some hops in the middle, and then back for some coffee bitterness at the close. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, with drinkability excellent for the style. Another great Big Beer."
"Great to see Smuttynose make this part of there new ""Big Beer"" series and for my money this is the best.Poured into a 22oz nonic a rich and dark nearly opaque black with a large blooming mocha colored head that settled rather quickly leaving no lace behind.I had to give the aroma a ""5" because not only are they incredibly appetizing but they just jump out at ya,big juicy prune/raisin dipped in dark bitter chocolate with a hint of dry wood.Great balance of sweeter dark fruit and dark chocolate and a dry leafy,woody finish there is a large dose of hop but it still stays pretty true to style.A great new addition Smuttynose great work."
"Dark cola brown/black with a light tan head of foam that rises steadily and leaves decent lacing. Aromas are all roasted malts, some cocoa powder, a bit of warm alcohol, and a faint medicinal resin hop. Taste is very chocolate/coffee/roast with a dry almost lactic hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium/thick which lends a good drinkability. Not too far off from an Okocim and that's saying a lot for this style"
"Drinkability= Too bad this is a seasonal brew. I would like to drink this all year 'round."
"Drinkability: For around $5 or $6 a bomber, the Smuttynose Big Beer series is one I'm always into purchasing. For the most part I've yet to be even mildly disappointed and this brew is no different. This seems a style that a lot of breweries are trying, which is great, since you need some deviation from the RIS every once in a while. Certainly an awesome sipper for a cold evening, and one that I highly recommend."
"An opaque dark brown color that you barely see through the pour. A full finger stiff tan colored head fades slowly to sheets of lacing, some 3D. The smell is an aggressive creamy Tootsie roll chocolate with a light roasted malt character. Nicely carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied, creamy and silky smooth with a slight tingle of alcohol on the tip of the tongue. Full flavored, the sweet chocolate taste is quite similar to the smell and complemented nicely by the feel. There is a lightly chewy milk chocolate after taste that lingers nicely. The Alcohol is integrated well, yet provides a subtle warmth on the way down. Way too easy to drink! Highly recommended."
"Rich, thick, viscous mouthfeel, prickly with tiny bubbles from the good carbonation, semi-dry finish. Warming effect in the belly. Extremely tasty and enjoyable, Highly drinkable. Ahhh, Smuttynose."
"overall, an experience. there's plenty to like her for the dark beer lover, though not a style for a weak palate. lots of nuance and discreet alcohol for such a bomb. try alongside something sweet and creamy, a mocha cheescake or a plain one with red fruit on top.. maybe even just the fruit with some chocolate (white!)"
"Drinkability: Great drinkability. Not too rough on the palate, but a sipper in my opinion. Overall a pretty good Baltic Porter from Smuttynose. Curious how this would be with a little age on it."
"Finish is a little hot, which hurts the alcohol. Despite the apparent lack of hops it does not come off as cloyingly sweet. Some time with this one may smooth things out, but it is still undeniably enjoyable. Worthy of a Russian or New Jersey winter evening."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a rich black and chocolate malt scent that warms even the nose. This is one intense beer. The taste is perfect. This one is black to the max. It's rich and smooth going down with bitter black malt flavor. It warms a bit in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is the best Baltic I've ever tried. It leaves nothing to be desired; a truely balls out beer. God Bless America!!! Cheers."
"A big flavorful Porter, slightly out of balance but pretty damn good anyway. I can only imagine this would get better with time."
"This is a great offering, very full, sweet and rich character, a good example of the style. Worth having around and most definitely worth looking out for."
"as dark as brown can be without being black and opaque, this one has a nice, tan head that holds well and leaves great lace. very nice to look at. nose is coffee with cream, chocolate, roasted grain and faint hop goodness. very nice indeed. taste exhibits the same, and the lager yeast definitely plays a part, giving it a weird edge in the finish and mouthfeel. very full and creamy, but not overboard. very drinkable. abv isn't posted anywhere, and i don't detect much booze in the taste. smuttynose steps it up on this one."
"Although I'm comparing a Baltic Porter to a RIS, I would say it could possibly be called the poor man's Kate the Great?! I don't know, just buy it and enjoy! Delicious!!"
"Drinkability: superb. I had this alongside the new Victory Baltic Porter for a tasting comparison, and this one was far superior IMHO, even though the Victory version was also good. An absolute must have for all BA's. This is my new favorite in the Smutty Big Beer series."
"Pours dark dark brown, with a pretty dark, full head on it. Smells of sweet malt, coffee, and smoke. Tastes similar, I really like this beer. This is something I could drink a bunch of, too bad it's only around for a bit. Definitely going to put a few of these in my cellar."
"I need to stock up on this!"
"Mouthfeel is wonderfully creamy and full bodied. Very chewy and filling. I do so wish Smuttynose was local to me. This is another winner."
"Have been looking forward to trying this for a while now. Pours a very deep black, with a lightly tanned head that lasts. Smell is big on roasty burnt coffee and bitter dark chocolate. Taste is along the same lines, with some fruit in the middle. Bottom line is that the bitter coffee takes center stage with this brew. Mouthfeel is somewhere in the realm between medium and heavy. I could probably put back more than one bomber. This is a fun style to visit from time to time, and Smuttynose has once again proved itself worthy of it. Not the best from their big beer series, but still remarkable. Cheers"
"brown pour with a reddish-orange foam, unique. wet wood aroma. super thick, tickling carbonation and quite boozy when slightly cold. finishes leathery without astringency. flavors of plum, port, oak and roasted malts flourish. some metallic nonsense, but not overwhelming. not as good as i remember last year's being, but pretty good still. if i gave it an great last year, it's a solid good this ano."
"1041"
"I can see this becoming a crushed velvet tongue tickler after a couple of years in the cellar."
"Pours a solid black with a thin mocha head that doesn't stick around long, but does leave some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet almost a lactose sweet smell with some roasted grain, coffee and some faint raisin in there too. The taste hits you with a lot at once. First I got some hops then chocolate then coffee then some alcohol. Roasty bitterness in the end sits in your gullet just begging you to take another sip. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is an excellent brew! I better buy up some more before they are all gone. Great cellar candidate too. Another excellent brew from Smuttynose."
"i love this brewery."
"Poured slowly into an Imperial pint glass. Thick, black and creamy, is this a porter or a stout, haha? Very thin, brown head with no lacing. Smells of chocolate, coffee, and a little rasin. Nothing too strong. Overall smell is really the only thing holding me back from giving this an A+. Taste is unreal. Creamy milk chocolate initially, with roasted malt as it goes down. Flavor stayed in my mouth for what seemed like forever. So smooth and delicious, I wish I had another. This is a real bargain at only 3.99 for a bomber."
"This is an exceptional beer. It pours almost black with a great pillow head and great lacing. Smell is an excellent blend of smoky malt, raisins, molasses. taste is smoky, with coffee elements, hop notes on finish..a treat to the palate. Mouthfeel is creamy, full-bodied with a dry finish. Drinkability is extremely smooth especially for a Baltic Porter. Put this one in my top 10."
" This is a brilliant, heady brew that is just right for this classic New England winter were having."
