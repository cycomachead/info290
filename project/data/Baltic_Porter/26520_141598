Tan head that fades quickly leaving a thin ring of bubbles. Aroma is sweet, sugary bourbon, caramel, roasted malts and cocoa. Flavor is much of the same, with the roasted malts and cocoa coming through more. Roasted malts, sugary bourbon and lots of boozy heat. Feel is very syrupy, with low carbonation and a potent alcohol burn. A solid barrel-aged porter, but I expected a little more after how much I enjoyed bride maker.","stephenjmoore","Mar 02, 2015"

First sniff, holy hell, this one is a bourbony, alcohol-dripping monster (pun!). Lots of bourbon barrel character. Big, rushing malty sweetness. Almost smells like a liqueur. Roast, brown sugar and sweet syrup. The flavor strikes with a brash, continuous trio of alcohol, oak, and sweetness. Irish coffee, burnt caramel, cooked brown sugar, more and more oak, liquor-soaked dark fruit. A mean brew! Hot and oily feel. Lingering barrel flavor. I had a large sample pour of this one and I think that was the perfect amount. It's big and bold but its power didn't necessarily translate to pleasure in my mind.","VelvetExtract","Jan 04, 2015"
