"Overall - This has a great whiskey flavor.  The grain character of the whiskey actually comes through really nicely."

"O - Outstanding beer!"

"First & second impression confirmed. This is a pretty good beer, but really nothing special in my mouth. Glad I got that one nailed down."

"A darn impressive beer. The first barrel-aged baltic porter I've had, but it far surpasses many barrel-aged imperial stouts. Smooth, rich, and flavorful, with great barrel integration. Yum."
"O - overall really tasty, almost tastes like half whiskey, half Baltic porter."
"Lighter to medium bodied with a smooth light level of carbonation. As preiously stated, this beer is pretty darn good with nothing bad or off about it (except for the unreasonably high price in my opinion.) My only gripe is that this beer's character is totally dominated by the barrel presence and doesnt leave much room for the beer's base to come through. If the opportunity presented itself i would certainly drink this again but not at $70+ a growler."

"O - I really loved this one. As some of the other reviews have said it kind of smells and tastes like Bourbon County. It has everything I love in a bourbon barrel stout and yet it remains quite drinkable. I would love to have this one again in the future."
""
"O: This is an excellent big bourbon stout. Unsurprisingly Barley John's has another peerless beer in their line up. The only downside is the price at over 9 dollars for a small tulip! Was worth it though."

"Thanks for the hook up on the growler, Mike!"

"On tap at the Great Taste of the Midwest. Pitch black pour with a small brown head that fades quickly. Awesome aroma of bourbon, vanilla, oak, and more. Amazing flavor of wood, chocolate, coconut, and lingering roast coffee. Awesome flavors and perfect balance. Stellar."

"Pours a very dark brown with a minimal amour of tan carbonation. Smells is dripping with bourbon and chocolate. Taste is more of the same, with light carbonation. Smooth with a little dark fruit in the mix. Really good. Thanks liquor barrel!"
"O: this is a good beer. I assume it lost some carb in the growler."
"Overall: A bit boozy in the flavor, but still excellent stuff. I don't understand why this is so expensive."
"Dark Knight just gets better and better as I go through the glass, but there could be more balance and a better show of porter flavors. Tone back the bourbon just a bit and we're in business."
"Looks dark with a very light dark brown head. The nose is big roast and bourbon, cocoa, chocolate, oak. Yum. Smells really good. The taste is huge, roasty malts, sweet bourbon and maybe just a hint of booze. Really big beer that is somehow only slightly boozy in spite of its obvious size. Impressively put together. Creamy and smooth, lower carbonation. This is a pretty great beer that is unfortunately is a hard one to get. Not perfect, but very enjoyable."
"So glad I got to try this. This is one big brew. After five ounces, I was feeling it. According to the bartender, this could weigh in anywhere from 13% abv and up. I believe it. A very good beer that is worth a try for sure, but not worth the $70 a growler price tag in my opinion. That is unless you can split it up amongst several friends. Believe me, you will need to share this high octane beast."
"o - Overall this is a great barrel aged porter. There is some definite heat to it, but the nose is fantastic. Would certainly love to have this one again some day."
"Had several pours of a growler shared by Brad. Again, fantastic stuff. Would love to have this again."
"Viscous body with lots of boozy heat and bourbon flavor.  Way too hot with lots of burning alcohol that overpowers the other flavors and tons of warmth/burning in the finish.  Underneath the strong barrel/spirit presence there is some chocolate, toffee and toast.  Way too much bourbon and alcohol sweetness resulting in a one dimensional beer that isn't very interesting.  Thick and viscous mouthfeel helps things a bit but there is no depth or complexity."
"O - Good beer, it was a bit much at times, and can really only do it in small doses, but I liked it and as far as imperial BA porters, this is about as good as it gets."
"O: A powerful bourbon filled sipper that I enjoyed and would have no problem drinking again. Thanks again, Jeff."
"O: This one lived up to expectations for me. Just an awesome beer."
"Tried on tap on three occasions. Almost black appearance with a small brown head that dissipates relatively quickly. The smell on this beer is absolutely stunning with sweet bourbon notes. Taste and mouthfeel is silky smooth. Could drink lots of this on a nice winter evening! The alcohol and bourbon flavor are very well integrated into the finished product. I think the porter and bourbon barrel combo work really well together and I haven't seen a better one done than this one."
"O - Very hot and needs some more time before really hitting its prime, in terms of taste. It would be nice to age this one for a while, but it's hard to do considering the vessel and how fast it goes. Good, but not outstanding."
"overall a massive beer, alcohol is not soo upfront as you can just feel this one ripping you apart. one of the biggest things i have had in a while."
"Pours nearly black with a small mocha head that lasts for a bit. Few legs on the sides of the glass and a spot or two of lacing. Thin collar throughout. The nose is heavy on the malt and bourbon with some good notes of roast and brown sugar. Some vanilla and oak go with the bourbon. Dark fruits in the background. The flavor has a really incredible bourbon presence with some dark fruits backing things up. Nice oak. Roasted malt is nice, and there's a bit of chocolate as well. Moderate sweetness on a full body with a creamy texture. Really solid and well done. It was worth the wait."
"Thanks again Tony!"
"Beer is medium in body and really sweet on the lead off, immediately gives way to the liquor character of the beer. I really liked this beer a lot. Truly incredible. This would have been the star of any other tasting or night except for some of the ridiculous shit we had next to it. I would have this again in a second."
"Jet black pour with a reddish head. They pour it with very little head to get the maximum amount of beer in the glass. The head was about a 1/4 inch. Big bourbon on the nose. It demands center stage of the smell. Fig and dark fruit with a touch of chocolate are faint but there. Very little carbonation. I was expecting as much. Bourbon in the mouth as well. There is a slight burn but not off putting. This beer is 15% folks, it's bound to be there but the taste is so damn good. I've noticed certain bourbon barrel beers taste like roasted coconut to me. This one does as well. Bourbon, roasted coconut, char, and some bakers chocolate. Heavenly. Glad I finally had this and I hope the people I sent the growlers to enjoy it equally as much."
"Dark Knight Returns: Smoother than the Dark Knight with similar taste profile but the differences is the barrel aging makes a world of difference."
"This has to be one of the best porters I have ever tried..The Dark Knight is worth the hype..glad I tried it."
"A very good bourbon bomb. Served in a small chalice with one finger of head that held on for a little while. Just light sticky lacing is left on the glass. Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, oak, and alcohol. The effects of the bourbon barrel dominate the aroma and flavor. The flavor consists of bourbon and vanilla. Overall it is quite sweet and hot. The body is not as large as I would of liked with this type of flavor profile. Gentle carbonation and soft texture. This is a beer for bourbon lovers."
"Bottle shared with Sparky27...never thought I’d get a chance to try this...THANKS ERIC!!! This one packs a Mike Tyson-like uppercut...will knock you on your ass if you aren’t paying attention!!! Not a sliver of light is able to escape this black-hole colored beer. A diminutive burnt caramel head builds but quickly recedes. Aroma is brown sugar, heavy bourbon, dark fruit, molasses and vanilla. Heavily charred oak, bitter chocolate, and aggressive bourbon flavor. Warms the belly and numbs the mind. A truly great beer."
"If you find yourself in MN, go out and get yourself a taste of this. One of the finest bourbon barrel aged beers I have had (right up there with BCS, KBS, Backwoods Bastard), but be warned, this one is HOT!"
"O- Solid brew, big big beer, the bourbon really takes over this beer, would like it to be a little more balanced, but overall was worth the price for the small pour."
"Harsh at times, but enjoyable nonetheless. Every element of this monster is tainted by booze AND it's working as far as I am concerned! This is the thinnest and most dry barrel aged ""dark"" beer that I have had, and I am liking it. Recommended."
"Overall, a really nice beer. The barrels show nicely. I can see some people being overwhelmed by the bourbon and the abv, but I really enjoyed it. The bourbon flavors are delicious. It is very drinkable, but I am trying hard to make my small glass last."
"O/D A bit heavy on the booze. It didn't bother me as I love bourbon, but I feel like it probably did mask some of the other characteristics. I would think that a year or two in the cellar and this would be outstanding."
"O - I loved this last year and am happy to have it again. The nose is spectacular and richness on the taste is close behind. I'd love to cellar one of these for a few years and see what happens. Another great beer from Barley Johns"
"D: What a beer! Nine times out of ten I would prefer the bourbon notes to be more restrained than they are in this one, but for some reason I think this one manages to pull such a bold character of. Although the beer is completely dominated by bourbon, it's still rather complex (wouldn't dare to call it balanced though). It's also important to note that you can really tell that it's an imperial porter rather than an imperial stout; it doesn't have the big body, nor the massive roasted malt character of an imperial stout. And I think this plays an important part in the success of the beer, since a bigger body, stickier texture and bigger roasted flavors would probably be to much with all the bourbon. With the porter backbone, it actually manages to come out as almost easy to drink."
"Overall I'm sad that this wasn't better. I had such high hopes."
"I sat on the patio outside Barley John's on perhaps the nicest day of the year in MN so far, sipping on this delicious brew while unwinding from a day's work and enjoying the sunset. Not a bad way to spend a late Monday afternoon at all."
"Overall- This is a big beer, very complex with a lot of bourbon alcohol and sweet malt. This is a great beer."
"For most people the 6oz serving is probably sufficient, but for bourbon-lovers this is a must-try."
"This one is special but isn't for everyone."
"Big props to Todd1 for hooking up some thirsty South Carolina beer geeks!"
"D- It's a sipper not doubt but it's wonderful. Just remember to let it warm up they tend to serve it a touch cold."
"Enjoyed on-tap at the brewpub. This is a refermented Dark Knight, and uses $250 bourbon bottles' casks. Wine colour, virtually no head. Above-average mouthfeel. Complex bourbon lavours, a bit of oak, a sipper Great aroma from the quality bourbon. Served too cold,so much better as it warmed."
"It's not possible to drink a lot of this. It's so overwhelming, I daresay, that the only thing I can compare the drinkability to is Mikkeller Black. I wish I was able to have more, and fresh, so that I could have a proper impression of what the drinkability was supposed to be. As it is... this is a headache in a bottle. So boozy, sweet, bourbony, and oaky that it's impossible to judge this along the lines of most beers. I can say that it's excellent."
"Overall this was a nice treat I'd love to see bottled."
"A good brew, but a bit too hot for my full enjoyment."
"Ordered it with an IPA so it could warm up a little and I could sip it from time to time. Nice Black pour, but no head to speak of, but it did leave a nice lacing down the glass. Aroma is dark malts, wiskey and oak. At first the taste is malty, I get a real nice chocolate flavor mixed with the whiskey and just a touch of bitterness from the hops. Smooth feel going down and warming, this is a very drinkable brew and would go nicely on a cool night out on my deck (or by the fire at BJ)."
"This may have just been too big of a beer for me, but I didn't like it at all. Appearance is good, very black and thick. A bit of tan head and no real lacing. Smell and taste are very similar. A lot of alcohol comes through right away, with a bit of coffee malt. Mouthfeel is good, nice and thick with just a bit of carbonation. Drinkability is not that great, largely due to the overwhelming alcohol content."
"D: Somehow really drinkable. The smell scares you but once you dive in it is a really nice treat. Awesome beer with an awesome name."
"If you have an opportunity...try this beer."
"I had this on tap at BJs in May while visiting a friend. I didn't know what I was in for! It was served in a small glass (maybe 8 oz. or so?) and was as DARK as DARK could be. Smelled great and looked the part. What I couldn't get past was the strong alcohol flavor - seemed a lot more than the advertised 13.5%! I have had beer with high ABVs but the bartender may as well have put a shot of bourbon in this one! Apparently some people rave about it, so it's worth a try..."
"D-Great--but you better like your bourbon son! This brew is so BIG that it could put a halt on drinking too many of them. A true sipper thru and thru."
"Pours black with a small dark tan head that quickly fades. Aroma hits immediately after pouring, huge sweet maltiness, dark fruits, leather and wood, a strong bourbony alcohol singes the nose. Taste follows with a rich sweet maltiness, strong vanilla notes, dark berry fruitiness, strong alcohol warmth in the finish is very large but on par for the size of the beer. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, low in carbonation, but the carbonation that is there is creamy and adds to the fullness on the tongue. A bit of a bite from the alcohol at the back of the throat before it warms into the somewhat dry finish. Great beer, the barrel ageing comes thru very well, and though the alcohol is quite present it fits the size. Put this in a bottle and watch me go broke. Thank you to Eben!"
"Fantastic, really gives the other heavy hitters a run for their money. Even though a baltic porter, would stand up well in a RIS tasting."
"I had the fortune of trying this the day after drinking Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout which provided a nice comparison for another bourbon barrel-aged beer. The Dark Knight is heavier on the booze with the alcohol present in the aroma and flavor while bourbon dominates the flavors. In the taste, a little cocoa and coffee back up the liquor, but I think the BCS is much more balanced by comparison. This is still a great beer and a wonderful sipper, but I'd recommend The Dark Knight Returns, which has a great deal less bourbon, over the original."
"Very boozy and warming. Good amount of oak character, but not quite overdone. Very sweet, almost cloying. A bit thin in the body for such a beast. Nicy roasty component. Some fruit as it warms. Ends up pretty nice."
"Huge amounts of residual sugar in this brew. Slightly cloying and sticky. Very oily viscous mouthfeel just as it poured in the glass. Only a thimble of carbonation, not sure if this is a culprit of the hand bottle. Very sweet concentrated vanilla flavors. Bourbony with a stomach turning type alcohol or it could be from the overly sweet elixir. However the beer is very good and desserty. Dark chocolatey ver dark fruits and brown sugar/mollasses. Creme freche. Thin and oily, and too sweet to drink many of."
"I had this on tap at Barley Johns and again at the Autumn Brew Review. Very dark/black in pour. Overpowering bourbon and oakish aroma with some dark fruit as well. Slightly sweet prune or molasses with a heavy bourbon overtone and the alcohol is noticable."
"A nice treat for sure."
"Hand bottle courtesy of Stine: Poured a pitch-black color porter with a small dirty brown foamy head. Aroma of bourbon is quite overpowering with some sweet malt notes also noticeable. Taste is overpowered by bourbon and I had a hard time picking-up other flavour. Body is quite full with alcohol from the barrel really coming out. I was a bit surprised as I was not expecting so much bourbon to come out in such fashion and I am probably not the biggest bourbon fan around."
"Its nice when you get a whiff of a highly rated beer and know instantly it isnt all hype. Rich milk and dark chocolate, blueberry, coffee, cream,fudge brownies, molasses, caramel and vanilla. The chocolate/fudge and coffee elements are strongest, but the blueberry fruity notes make a decent showing. There is a slightly dusty note in the tail end of the aroma. Quite varied and concentrated though. The body is deep black and holds a slowly diminishing thumb thick mocha head that compresses to nickel thickness. Slightly hot boozy notes in the first sip followed by burnt/bitter roast and coffee notes. Unsweetened bakers chocolate, low sweetness dark fruits, very light bourbon notes. The mouthfeel is actually very porter-y despite the massive un-porter 13% abv. which youd think might make it more an Imperial stout in thickness. The finish is vanilla, sweet cream, brown sugar and some more dark fruit notes this time lucious grape, raisin and prune. Doesnt dissapoint. Great range. Seems to dip slightly in inteisity through the middle ranges, but the finish is very enjoyable and it drinks damn easy for a 13% abv beer."
"Mouthfeel is viscous, very full bodied, along with an alcohol, boozy burn that is outweighed by the delicious flavors and stickiness of this concoction."
"While picking up a growler for hopdog, figured I'd sample this fine brew myself. Glad I did too. Into a snifter glass, pours a thick black mess of liquid and massive bubbles and head, lacing all over the place, loverly. The nose is one you could just hook up to your nose and sniff for hours on end, roasted malts and grains, thick, delicious. Tastes fantastic, richly malty, slightest hint from bourbon oak aging, wonderful. Full body, could almost call it thick and creamy, but the slightest tingle of carbonation, quite nice. Now i have to ask myself, why am I not buying a grolwer for myself? Oh ya. At $1 an ounce, that adds up and it ain't cheap, but for a treat every blue moon, there is nothing better."
"Oh yeah: the alcohol, while well-hidden, is VERY warming."
"Smells of tiramusu cake soaked in light bourbon, covered with chocolate sauce and decorated with toffee, cherries and coconut flakes, with a side of sliced apple and red wine. Near opaque black color. Initially vinous, like sweet dark fruits and red wine, whichs then falls into a roasty blast of malt, with chocolate and roast. Grapes and bourbon on the finish, with light vanilla and coconut, although not as profound as I usually prefer in a bourbon beer. Soft texture, seemingly better when served at the brewpub. A really enjoyable, unique beer."
"Boo-yea."
"Honestly, this beer may be a bit mature for me. It's nothing like I've ever tasted before, and as time goes on, I may come to like these kinds of beers. But I'm glad I tried it, if only to expand my horizons."
"Rosie who?"
"Shared a hand bottled sample.Poured a very dark black color with a small brown head. Aromas and tastes of dark fruits (plums and raisins), vanilla, apples, and a little woody and smokey. Sweet. Molasses. A lot going on here. I will definitely have to try and get some more of this one."
"Absolute black, opaque. It was served with a tiny beige head; the retention was fair as it faded to a foamy collar, sparse in the middle. The appearance is impressive. Great color and all but the small serving glass seems to up the ante. For such a high abv beer I am impressed with the subsequent lacing, it was spotty but fairly widespread. The nose starts off with Jim Beam-like aromas with hints of cheap whiskey (possibly Old Crow), raw alcohol notes as well. Actually the nose seems like bourbon soaked mocha-chocolate coffee. The roasty coffee aromas are way in the back and just not loud enough. Regardless this bouquet is still very inviting. The potency is solid. The palate has its raw moments, they are not overwhelming, and the alcohol flavors add plenty of depth as does aging this beer in bourdon barrels. I get a lot of Jim Beam-like flavors. Awesome. The porter aspects are too secondary and mostly hidden. The chocolate, coffee notes are too weak. I am surprised that this beer is not very sweet and it is actually very dry. Quite flavorful! The finish is warm and alcoholic, bourbon, faint hints of charred wood. This is a lovely beer, something to sip and savor. I am impressed at how easy going this big, complex beer is. The mouthfeel is good but ordinary; honestly I wish it were chewier. It is a little fuller than medium, low but natural carbonation. Very good stuff here, Im glad I got the chance to try it."
"An amazing beer, one that would start a riot if they put it in bottles!"
"Dark and opaque, thin spidery head with simple string lace. Heavy malts mark an aroma that only hints at what's to come. Husky carob flavors, almost chocolate but not, backed by a dried fig fruitiness. Impressive mutating flavors, switches emphasis to a more highly bittered roastiness on later sips. Substantial alcohol is decently well-hidden. In another switch, by the end of the glass (and its only a small snifter), there's a distinct sense of Oreo cookies and cream with some spiced pear up the nasal cavities. This brew is quite layered and impressive."
"Taste is complex, rich, and invigorating with a ton of deep dark chocolate, some molasses, fruity-like alcohol with a dark earthy quick bite of woodyness finding some hold about midway finishing with more complexing woody earth features of sweet malty tang and bitterness with notes of flowery spice like that of dulled mustard or ginger. Wow! The bourbon barrel worked its wonders on this brew. Fantastic! Very port-like in its character. Packs a big punch in flavor and alcohol, you can tell the alcohol is there but is mildly mellow and lends the feel to be smoother then you would think. Very rich, nearly full overall in mouthfeel with a welcoming smoothness that makes this dark knight a deadly easy drinkin' Porter. Super Yum!"
"My cuz STUBOB and myself swung by Barley John's today and sampled this one. It was all in all a great beer. We had the pleasure of being able to talk with the brewer, head chef, and owner, John. He was a really friendly guy who was happy to talk about his beers. Anyway, on to the beer. This one came in a little snifter. It was as black as midnight with a brown head. The aroma was great. It was port-like and oaky with a nice roastiness and a bit of alcohol. My anticipation was growing. The taste was amazing, with the port, oakiness coming through. There were also flavors of dark fruits, such as figs and dates. After talking with the brewer we found that he used a high gravity Trappist yeast for this one that gave it the estery dark fruit flavors. It also had a nice roastiness to it. All in all it was a high octane brew, one to be sipped, but it was still easy drinking. An exceptional brew, probably one of the best brews I have ever had."
"It'd be nice if you could get more than 7-8 ounces for $5.25. Or get 7-8 ounces for less $$. A bit spendy indeed."
