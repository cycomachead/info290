"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce aluminum can, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"O-the roast, coffee and chocolate sweet blended great and was a great buy"
""
""
"Pretty sure it was a bad batch."
"V - Medium low. Not really worth it unless you're a local or just really love this brewery."

"Decent head on this. Aroma was very subdued until it warmed up. Started out nutty and turned into caramel. Tastes dry and roasty and very smooth, light mouthfeel. A little alcohol stays with the aftertaste. I want to really like this beer but the dry aftertaste as it warms up reminds me of cheap liquor."
"Poured into a tumbler, this beer is a very very dark brown with a dense finger's worth of head on top of it. The nose is disappointingly weak but gives some pleasant sweetness, a little doughy. Very good flavor. This is definitely a sweet stout, with little to no roast. Good black patent malt flavor dominates. Bitterness is pretty low, giving the malt overtime to deliver a lingering thick bready taste. Decent offering from Deep Ellum, though nothing unusual."

"A solid Crack! was followed by an inverted Glug, resulting in both a pseudo-cascade and two rocky fingers of deep-tan, NOT deep ellum, head with good retention. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing only minimal light penetration at the edges. Nose had a roastiness underlain by a light chocolatiness. I just had chocolate chip oatmeal for breakfast this morning and I am beginning what has happened to me as a self-avowed hophead. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was VERY roasty, initially, giving 'way to a pleasant smoky chocolatiness. My my. I just looked at the style - a Baltic Porter! The site's descriptor for the style mentions ""bitter"" and ""acidic", both of which I experienced, especially on the finish. It was much akin to a cup of coffee. Wow! Good stuff. One would probably be plenty for me, but YMMV."

"O: This was actually an awesome beer. I live in Texas and am usually not too blown away by the locals, but I like this one a lot and will definitely get it again."
"Tastes better than the scent. I suppose the earthy nutty roast translated poorly to me into the aroma, but here it starts off decent tasting, but then finishes much more nicely with chocolate and nothing dry. Choco-hazelnut if anything. Feels great though. Creamy enough, mild stickiness yet not so thick. Finishes well, sweet with nutty overtones. Solid brewery."

"o- i think it's a solid beer. if i were out and about and wanted a stout this would be a top choice, just not the top choice. i think deep ellum brewing company did a great job with the Double Brown Stout."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Light head, and no real lacing. Nose is chocolate, coffee, and peat. Pungent and a little sweet, chocolate, raisin, and coffee. A little boozy feeling. Overall, this is a good quaff."
""
"Pours a hazy crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, toasted oat, and chocolate syrup aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, oat, and cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a smell that is much better than the taste."

"I have two issues with Double Brown Stout: first, the fact that even the brewery acknowledges that, despite the name, it's not technically a stout; and second, more people should have access to this wonderful beer (and the other, equally great offerings in the Deep Ellum portfolio). This Dallas brewery is damn good and it's high time more people know about it!"

"A black, nice brown head leaving some nice lace. S pecans, oatmeal cookies, brown sugar. T lots of great brown sugar oatmeal pie sweet malty cookie goodness. M excellent drinkability, nicely carbonated with silky mouthfeel and brown sugar aftertaste. O this is a stellar knockout of a beer, definitely a winner and one of my favorite beers"

"Enjoyable local beer. Not one of my favorite porters, but very drinkable."

"Taste is cocoa dusted strawberries and maybe a touch of Hershey's bar with almonds. Its an easy drinker that begs to be quaffed at a high rate of speed. Me thinks I will oblige. Its one of those beers where the sum is more than the parts...just enough leafy greens on the back end to keep it from being simple. Id buy this again, good beer here."

"First (and only so far) beer from Deep Ellum. Very happy to have tried it. Solid oatmeal stout/Baltic porter. Up there with some of the most memorable I have had. This could be a good breakfast beer on the right occasion. If ever having the chance again, I would certainly have this beer again."
"Creamy and remarkably smooth for a beer of this strength, this sweet porter is a little different in that it calls itself a stout and is brewed using lager yeast. But in this instance, different is good and this is certainly a beer I recommend trying."

"Of course it's dark brown with a dark tan head. Obvious notes of chocolate and caramel to the nose. Tastes of sweet chocolate, some grain, a bit of vinegar and subtle hops. Smooth as hell and creamy for sure. Has semi-dry finish. Thoroughly enjoyable brew from start to finish."

"Poured from a can into a tulip. Deep, rich brown, that ends up looking almost black unless held to the light. Head is a khaki/brown crown of foamy goodness. Smell is not very strong, but you get hints of a nutty, brown ale quality, mashing with the roasted malt undertones. Tastes very much like a blend between an oatmeal stout and a brown ale. Traditional nutty malt flavors, with a touch of caramel, immediately followed by rich roasted coffee and some creamy sweetness. Goes in kinda thin but thickens up as you swallow, very refreshing with some heft to it. Robust and enjoyable beer."

"o - really diggin this one. surprised the reviews aren't nicer. chocolate, nuts, brown ale, porter...robust-ness. just enjoyable. i could drink this all night since it isn't too heavy. nice intro ""dark beer"""

"Surprised at the easy drinkability on this."

"Generally underwhelming. Not bad, but there was little remarkable about it. If you're in the mood for a Baltic porter, this will do the trick, but it made me switch to a wheat beer. Maybe I just had it at the wrong time. There wasn't much depth to it, though on the front end it was pretty good."

"O: The infection ravaged this beer. It seemed so inviting and I seem to be the first to report any infection here on BA. Hopefully this is an isolated incident for this newer brewery."

"O- This was a nice stout. Definitely easy to drink and very enjoyable. I would definitely drink this again. Nice balance between hazlenuts and creamy chocolate. A little bit too light on the mouthfeel in my opinion but not bad. I would recommend trying this out."

""

"Another excellent beer from Deep Ellum. I am not sure how much of a Blatic Porter this is, but considering more than half of the beer drinking world does not know either, I would say this is a hit. Something I really enjoy and would recommend."

"The taste is like a big porter. It has a chocolatey taste with a smoky finish. There's also a nittiness in this that reminds me of the (512) Pecan Porter. In fact, I think that's the best comparison for this beer. It's the Pecan Porter of Deep Ellum, but it's different on the dryness and sharpness. I'd usually prefer the Pecan Porter, but I wouldn't be sad to see this on my glass. Solid, but not great."

"On tap at The Common Table. The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma is great, with a ton of chocolate up front and a little bit of roasted malt also mixed in. Definitely the aroma of a big, flavorful beer. The flavor doesnâ€™t disappoint. I get a lot of roasted malt and chocolate notes, as well as some oaked notes and some lactose. The beer is very creamy and all of the aroma and flavor notes seem to go very well together. Medium to thick, creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
