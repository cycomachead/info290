"Pours with an undersized, bubbly weak head ... and that's the end of my noteworthy complaints.  The body itself is a dark ruby-brown color.  The rich aroma is loaded with dark fruit notes, particularly raisin and dried plums, and has hints of chocolate, dark bread and coffee.  The flavor does not disappoint.  It is rich and fruity, with hints of dates, raisins, dried plums, toffee and faint coffee.  The high ABV is a bit too obvious here but there aren't really any overly boozy aspects. e.

"o: A curious brew for a Baltic porter, more a barleywine/brown ale/porter hybrid.  Flavorful and eminently sippable.."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, caramel, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, brown bread, brown sugar, raisin, plum, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of dark/toasty malts and light yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, toast, biscuit, caramel, nuttiness, brown bread, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness on thin finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malts and moderate fruity yeast ester flavors; with great malt robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Baltic porter. All around nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"One of my favorite beers over the years, but it seems to be changing , ie getting cheapened. The maltiness and creamier textures of previous batches seems to be declining – it seems less complex."

"The beer's aroma is full and sweet. It's promise is borne out in a flavor that, while possessing dusky, malty elements, veers toward the confectionary. It might be a little too sweet--and perhaps simple--for some, but I find it fun and satisfying on a winter evening. The beer's impressive texture is smooth and frothy."
"Interesting. I don't think many people would disagree with me if I were to say this is not to style (light in color, minimal roast, no black currants, raisins, prunes, late addition hops), but it's still a good beer...it just tastes more like an imperial brown. Nothing like Sinebrychoff, Okocim, Zywiec, Baltika #6, Carnegie Stark or Aldaris, but I still enjoy it on it's own merit. Rated here ""to style""."

"O - 2012 vintage. Not sure how age has affected this as I've never had it fresh. I'm typically not a fan of the sweet/fruity porter renditions, but this seems mostly well executed."
""
""
"Medium full bodied, a hint of warming alcohol and quite quaffable brew. Best by date of aug. 2012, so this brew did well with aging. Prost, victory!"
""
"Nicely done."
" was it the best in this class no, for one I think the BJCP is full of shit. but I used their scale and this beer pass on that, except on 1. Even then I think is a decent beer not much to say, cheers! oh I may be overrating it cause I like boozy beers."
""
""
""
""
"A tasty beer that I am going to try and find a fresher bottle as I think I may have an older bottle, but this is still a really tasty baltic porter. Heavier alcohol on this at 8% than I would expect, but a good beer for these upcoming winter months for sure."

"Intense strong flavors of sweet roasted malt, dark fruits, a hint of smoke and intense long lasting dark chocolate finish. Alcohol is strong as is typical for the US version of this style. Actually, I prefer the lighter, lower alcohol Lithuanian version of Baltic Porter exemplified by Utenos Porter. Why is it US brewers generally have to brew over-the-top high alcohol beers."

"Poured bomber into 34oz mug. Dark brown, slightly cloudy, showing lighter brown at the edges. Fizzy medium head from a careful pour that dissipates leaving no lacing so far. Smell is heavy on bitter chocolate, with the other roasted/coffee scents as expected. Taste is like the smell; coffee and chocolate, heavily roasted, a bit acidic/sour. Mouthfeel is a bit fizzy, but very full-bodied. It's a perfect example of the style as described."

"Overall I wasn't too impressed with this beer and I thought it was an average at best example of the style, all the aspects of this beer seemed to be much lighter then they should be and it didn't come together the way that a good Baltic Porter should. This beer had ok drinkability, it was pretty smooth and on the lighter side, but the flavors just didn't hold my attention and one is enough for me, I wouldn't want any more than that. What I liked the most about this beer was price, if this was $10 I would be very disappointed, but I think it's priced reasonably. What I liked the least about this beer was how much lighter most of the aspects of this beer were compared to most Baltic Porters, it just seemed to be lacking in every aspect. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I would much rather have a Thirsty Trout Porter and it's a way better Baltic Porter and it costs less, I wouldn't recommend it to my friends. All in all this beer left me wanting more and I don't think it did the style justice. IT seems like Victory is pretty hit or miss for me and this was another miss, better luck next time guys."
"Overall: aside from the good texture, this beer is kind of blah for me. There's nothing really wrong with it, but it really doesn't tickle my fancy the way Baltic porters usually do."
""
""
""
"O: A really nice dark lager with plenty of flavor. Easy to drink, especially given the 22 oz. format, and priced very well at $3.99. If you like baltic porters, I'd recommend trying this one"

"O: I obviously need to visit, swim in, and take a sip of the Baltic Sea to affirm my comparisons. I'll get back to this review in the future. Until then, if you're reading this, buy this beer when you see it. It's a delicious beer by itself and a great representation of the style."

"Overall: A complex malt bomb of a beer, and a quite good one at that."
""
""
"A well crafted beer, just not one that necessarily appeals to me. Can't knock it, but probably wouldn't get another one. Would certainly drink it if offered, though. I think my mom would like this if she could drink it..."
""
"Poured into a snifter, the color is very dark brown/black with a garnet hue when held to a light. There is a khaki colored moderate head that diminished to a ring around the glass. The aroma is moderate-high sweet, roasty malt with some chocolate and ash, a nice nose. The flavor is roasty, chocolaty with a slightly ashy, dry finish. The hop bitterness is moderate and blends well with the acidity of the malts. There are hints of the alcohol toward the swallow as well with a long lingering, bittersweet, roasted malt flavor. The body is medium with moderate carbonation; the beer drinks fairly easy. Overall a flavorful, complex, yet not tiring beer, well done."
""
""
""
"Beer is medium bodied with medium intensity carbonation that creates a slightly foaming sensation on the palate. Resulting mouthfeel is primarily smooth and a bit creamy. Ethanol presence becomes noted by mid-palate, with warming sensation in the nostrils and later in the back of the throat: it is never particularly boisterous or annoying. Closes out with a slightly dry finish, not particularly so, and with a bit of stickiness on the tongue and lips."
"I'm sorry I waited so long to try this beer, next case will come along shortly."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: very drinkable and perfect degree of sweetness"
""
""
"O: This is an excellent beer. Drinkable, delicious, and excellently balanced between fruity and bitter. Utterly delicious."
"Pretty decent brew. Not the showiest of styles, and this one keeps it on the straight-and-narrow. But, it’s well executed."
""
""
"Overall – This is a very nice example of a porter in my opinion. Nice robust sweeter and darker flavors with hints of fruits and booze. It makes a great drinking experience overall and is a beer I would recommend."
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"Beer appears dark brown with ruby highlights when held up to the sunlight. The head died rather quickly and was off-white. The beer smells very malty and chocolatey with tiny wisps of alcohol in the aroma as well. The taste is big and full of bitter chocolate and cola. It is heavy and flavorful on the palate, rich and creamy. This beer is a delicious dark brew."
"O - I was very impressed by the full flavors in this beer. In my experience Baltic Porters have left something to be desired in this category. Great sweetness, while not being overwhelmingly so. I bump up the overall category a half a point for the $5 bomber price. Unheard of in PA for a beer this good with 8.5% ABV. I highly recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Descent. Less roasted flavor and hop bitterness than expected. Tastes a lot like a wee heavy. Still good though."
""
"Dark mahagony color. The malt aroma is light, has a hint of cookie, and caramel. The hops are lemony, and the yeast has a tinge of cheese. The body is medium, the texture is thick, no carbonation, and the flavor’s duration is long; sweetness is light, as is acidity and bitterness. Perhaps a hint of coffee in the taste as well."
""
""
""
"O: Not too complex and is overall a collection of roasted sugars and coffee. What is does have going for it is its easy drinkability. The 8.5% abv is hidden extremely well."

"Overall: Pretty damn good beer will drink again"

"Poured from a brown 22 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of roasted malts, a bit sweet. Taste is malty, sweet, some smokiness, a touch of chocolate. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a quality brew worth checking out."

"I finished the pint faster than I thought I would, but I am not in a big hurry to have another pull off this keg. Would like to try it again sometime, though."
"Overall - It tastes good, but it's not what I expected at all. Not a lot of porter character. In between a porter and a barleywine, without the best characteristics of either."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a tan head. The aroma if full of coffee and roasted malt with some dark fruit mixed in. There is also a little bit of alcohol in the aroma. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of coffee and chocolate up front, with some roasted malt and dark cherries and prunes in the background. There is also some nice mint characteristics in the flavor which I really enjoy. The alcohol is present but doesn't hinder the drinkability. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice Baltic porter."
"A nice, smooth, malty ale with good, appropriate flavour for style."
"O-drinks easy as can be for it's size, tastes great, and pairs well with my favorite Alaskan foods (smoked fish, Salmon, Halibut, Game meat like moose, etc.) and being that it's on sale up here now, I may grab a few and see how it does with a year or 2. I really like this beer."
"Overall a very nice Baltic Porter. Probably my second favorite. Nice robust flavor and balance without the negative tendencies that others of the style sometimes have. I highly recommend this one."
"Pours a dark chestnut hue which leaves a creamy two finger head that dissapates slowly to leave a layer of cappicino froth and a rim of lacing,the smell is roasted malts and barley mixed with dark plums and milky chocolate,the mouthfeel is between light and medium bodied and has tastes of chocolate coated cherries,roasted dark malts,toffee,raisins,milky coffee and finished with a nice toasty berry finish and overall i quite like this drop as its very sessionable for its style and would buy again definately its one of those dark brews that u could drink all night cheers."
"O - Pretty good. I could do with a little less alcohol bite, maybe a little better balance between the sweet and roasted malts, and then it would be pretty damn good."
"Solid, really enjoyed the subtle chocolate notes. Creamy smooth."
"OVERALL: The look kind of hurt this one, and it could be a little more forthcoming in the nose, but this one was tasty enough to be interesting. Bigger body helped out a lot as well. This porter uses lager yeast, and from my experience, lager yeast moves an imperial porter closer to the Belgian strong ale zone. This is a style of beer I really enjoy, so I enjoyed this one as well, but it didn’t quench my thirst for an imperial porter brewed with ale yeast, which is the type I enjoy more I think. That said, this is a quality brew in its own right and is worth checking out. Thanks again for the trade kv84."
"O: A very smooth and easy-to-drink baltic porter that I would have again. Certainly not the most complex, but nonetheless a solid and tasty baltic porter with a very good taste profile."
"Poured a dark cola brown with a dense crown of tan bubbles. Good head retention and decent lacing. Roasty malts in the nose, tones of coffee, chocolate and leather. Taste of dark, roasted malts, dark chocolate, licorice, plums, coffee, and some smokey leather. Very nice and complex. On the heavier side of medium-bodied, and very drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"There is an odd taste in there that is a bit off putting for me, really to the point that i wish not to have another. I suspect that it's something with the hops."
"The mouthfeel is a little too thin for my liking. Decent, but not great beer."
" ~ For a Baltic Porter with an ABV of 8.5% I have to say this is a great drinker. It has a light feel, look and flavor allowing it to go down real easily. While I consider that a good thing, some folks may see it just the opposite."
"O: This is a pretty good porter. I still think the best I've had was stone's smoked porter, but this one is definitely a fine ale. I'm warming up to the style as well."
"O - Overall it's a very solid Baltic Porter distracting me from the American Porters I so easily and readily purchase and consume."
"A pretty solid baltic porter, definitely worth a taste if you like the style."
"A pretty good baltic porter that finishes very nicely from the lager yeast. I'd buy again, especially for a snowy night."
"o- A solid porter at a reasonable price for a 22oz bottle... something I plan to try on draft next time I visit their brewery. Another good brew from Victory."
"...and then in very very small letters and numbers...""Enjoy by January 27 2011""....I bought it in April....grumble, mumble....are you kidding me?!!"
"Appears translucent dark brown during the pour, black in the glass. Short yellowish white head that vanishes quickly, not much lacing. Smells like roasted malt, toffee, caramel, ground coffee and dark fruit. Tastes like bitter chocolate and roast malt, sweet caramel and brown sugar, toffee and grain. Slightly thin-bodied for the style, low carbonation, silky with a bitter sticky lingering mouthfeel. Tasty but not the most drinkable."
"O: Overall a pretty good beer. Luckily the taste was good enough to make up for the flat beginning."
"overall i loved the flavor and this might be my go to beer when i need a good malt fix - good price for a bomber $6"
"Drinkability is good and despite a little lacking looks wise, quite a nice Baltic Porter."
"O: This is terrific; it is delicious and a hell of a bargain at $5."
"This porter chugged it's way out of the bottle as a dark brown color with some red hues along the edges. The head was pretty thick looking for a little while until is settled down and left just a thin brown coating over top of the beer. The lacing wasn't too bad here, kind of sporatic. The smell of the beer has some old wood aromas, some earthy and smokey aromas as well. There's even a touch of sweetness on the nose too. The taste is pretty good, mostly of brown sugar and some roasted malts. The mouthfeel was on the thicker side and had a light carbonation, just enough to keep it interesting. Overall it's not a terrible Baltic Porter, but not the best I've had either."
"Many thanks to Mdaschaf for the chance to taste this. Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a murky dark brown color, but not completely opaque, about 1 finger of white foam that quickly recedes, but stays around the circumference of the glass. Smell- toffee, some grainy notes, with chocolate, maybe an oaklike quality. Taste- definite milk chocolate notes, some roastiness, nutty flavors. Some hops are present at the end and I get a roasted lightly bitter finish. This is my first Baltic Porter, so I'm not sure how to judge it on style characteristics, and will judge it purely on taste and experience. Mouthfeel- nice carbonation, and with the medium body, this is pretty smooth and easy to drink. Drinkablity- at 8.5 percent, I get absolutely no alcohol warmth here- I would say that this is about 5% if I didn't know better. It actually reminds me of CCB Maduro Brown in its nutty characteristics more than anything. This is an interesting beer, I would have it again."
"Pours a semi-opaque dark crimson amber color with a 1 inch light beige head that fades to a small cap. A random distribution of lace spots forms here and there on the glass on the drink down. Smells of roasted dark malt, dark fruits, and some subtle smoky notes. Taste is of dark chocolate pudding, dark cherries, dark malts, and alcohol. A bit of cocoa nib bitterness on the palate after each sip. Slight alcohol warming in the throat. This beer is smooth and creamy with a medium body and a good level of carbonation. Overall, this is a solid baltic porter from Victory but nothing too exciting."
"Victory has come a long way with their beers. When I opened the bottle there was a definite, delicious, smokey aroma. When pouring into a glass, it's color was a deep, dark, brown with a nice darker thick head that quickly dwindled to nothing after a few minutes. I tasted hints of fruits, but was mostly a roasted malty flavor. The alcohol percentage of this beer is 8.5% which was surprising because it didn't at all have a taste that would have indicated this. It was a very smooth and filling beer. Overall, while this wouldn't be something I would seek out, it was a beer that I did enjoy but would not be at the top of my list of Porters."
"O – Touch sweet. Would pair well with spicy dry rubbed ribs."
"glassware: tulip"
"Served on-tap at the La Jolla Brewhouse in CA. The beer was poured in a pint glass, and it presents a darkened amber coloring, brown in the middle, with a thin, filmy head. Slight chocolate and coffee nose, with some dark cherry notes. The flavor is a bit cherry and a bit coffee, and the bitter and the sweet balance pretty well. It tastes a little bit like Cherry Coke. The body is light, but syrupy at same time. Dark caramel and coffee on the aftertaste with a mid-length linger to the finish."
"T: A quick hit of coffee bitterness, then a lot of roasted malt flavor with some good caramel and toffee sweetness. Mouthfeel was a little thin, but I got used to it and it seemed to thicken up a bit as the beer warmed."
"Being a bigger beer, this is easier to drink than one might expect for the style and the ABV, which I attribute to it being, while not lacking in body, not overly filling, and with a flavor easy to swallow."
"Overall wow I can't believe how awesome this beer is! Great flavors subtle but many and the overall great price. Worth picking up if you like well masked high ABV porters. May have to go back and grab a second..."
"D-well i drank this for awhile before seeing the ABV and I could not believe my eyes. this honestly drinks like a 4% beer. i am so amazed with how drinkable this is. it is definitely filling but wow so good. the tastes just become more and more complex as well."
"O - Overall I like this beer very much, I would certainly buy it again and may be a favorite porter for me."
"Taste is soft and lightly sweet malt, watery coffee, cherry. Some bitter hop presence balances things out. Finish brings out the background roasty-ness. Feels nice in the mouth. Heat from the alcohol builds up after several sips. Definitely a sipper."
"D - Honestly, I think I was expecting a bit more from this one. It feels very ""minimal"" to me, and the solvency seemed to build over the course of the drink. Sweetness also seemed to build over time...not a bad beer by any stretch, but one I'm not likely to revisit"
"Pours dark dark ruddy brown and clear with a minimal head. The smell is quite nice, reminds me of winter with some alcohol warmth, roastiness, caramel, molasses molasses molasses. Tastes similar to its smell, it is sweet but not syrupy, with hints of black cherry, something of a thinner body, bubbly as opposed to frothy, with a dark malt bitterness to it. It is fairly easy to drink and it warms the belly but it would nice nice with a little more thickness. A nice cold weather brew. Would buy again."
"Overall: Quite good, very complex. It seems like all of the flavors have married well. I wish there were more Baltic Porters available so I can compare and see how this falls within the style."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a moderate off-white head that sticks around for a bit and comes back up with a good swirl. The nose brings forward a good amount of roast along with a bit of dark fruit. Mild chocolate there as well. Interesting. Taste brings forward quite a bit of dark fruits along with a hint of molasses. I would guess that there was some Special B used in this. Quite tasty and the yeast is bringing a nice presence. A touch of chocolate and roast as well. Medium body with low-ish levels of carbonation. Drinks really quite well. A touch of booze in the finish; I really like this beer. Drinks quite well and figuring out the style is a bit difficult."
"Excellent."
"D-High drinkability for a porter. Could drink a couple of these through out the night. My dad who does not know that much about beer said that it was a very drinkable beer and hes right!"
"Drinkability is quite high for such a high ABV. Goes down smooth, almost too smooth."
"It's 8.5%abv is masked nicely. Not sure I'd have more than 2 at a time, but the alcohol is just not persistent with this one. As far as Baltic porters go, this one is a winner in my book."
"D- Easy to drink, but nothing stood out"
"This beer is amazing on the mouth and under the tongue, and VERY drinkable for it's ABV. I had about 22oz of this beer within about 15 minutes and I usually never do that, it was just that dern delicious."
"This was my first experience with this style; I didn't even realize there was a ""Baltic"" Porter style. Really nice style, though. Sweet, complex porter flavors but with a lager cleanliness to the finish."
"This is a decent drinking beer, for sure. The 8.5 is hardly noticeable and, therefore, this can be enjoyed in mass quantity."
"D: um... a little boozy and sweet for me.. this is lower than avg."
"Enjoy this on a cold night with a head full of memories."
"Drinkability: A very solid beer. The hop presence is rather strong but it is balanced pretty well with the roasty flavour profile. A fuller body may be nice."
"This is a very nice baltic porter."
"Thanks Bry."
"The hop presence keeps the weight down. For a porter, I could keep this glass full."
"Drinkability: Nice sipper but comes across as more of a sweet Doppelbock, as the roasted qualities are a little too restrained. Not Victory's shining moment, but still quite tasty and good to try."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black. Has a low level of carbonation, average-size head. Looks nice, like an Imperial Stout but perhaps not as dark. Aroma is similar, lots of roasted malts and coffee/chocolate in the taste as well. I think it was less bitter than I expected, and at 8.5% abv, it seems surprisingly drinkable. I enjoyed the flavors, although as other reviewers have said, it is on the sweet side. This is a good porter, would be a good intro to the style or perhaps before trying an Imperial Stout."
"Steve"
"The flavor perhaps doesn't go as far as it could with a Baltic porter and it is a bit over roasty for the style, but it is a very nice beer."
"I am really impressed with Baltic Thunder, as I have been with all the Victory beers I've had. This one is right up there with all my favorite porters and Baltic porters. I'll be buying more that's for sure."
"Drinkability: I probably could have finished this bomber on my own. Loved it. I think this is a really great offering!"
"This is an excellent porter, certainly one of the better I've had this year. Full and delicious, I would absolutely have this brew again."
"Another solid beer from Victory. Recommendable."
"D - This is one of my favorite styles of beer and this didn't let me down. Most assuredly a sipper, delighted in sharing thoughts will I sampled this selection with my best friend. Check this beer out."
"Verdict: Delicious and worth tracking down."
"I really enjoy Victory's take on traditional beers. They are very innovative and put a great spin on traditional German/Belgian style brewing. While I found this beer to be no different (the smoke nuances are very interesting), I did not pick up on the fruit notes I typically expect to find in a porter, which was a bit of a let-down. Good beer nonetheless."
"Overall, decent but not exceptional. I think I might've enjoyed it more but in my mind I was comparing it to Storm King and that's probably an unfair comparison. Still, it was a good porter and hit the spot nicely. I would recommend giving it a try. Cheers!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, although there are better beers in the style, this is still a solid porter worth drinking for a long time."
"Very rich and chocolaty. It's no Perkuno's Hammer, but then again, that was one of the best beers I've ever had. All in all, very tasty! Totally worth taking beyond the ""best by"" date..."
"Drinkabilty - Well, its strong enough that this 22oz is enough for sure. This is borderline about as weak as you get for a baltic porter for its bitterness and kick. Great winter beer, will drink again"
"D - For a Baltic Porter, high. The clean finish coupled with the absolute masking of the ABV makes it above average for the style."
"Served in non-standard glass, no head, runny lacing, Color was like that of Coca-Cola (the bar was dark) with a touch of maroon. The aroma consisted of slight bitter hops, coffee, and over-roasted malts. Taste is overwhelmingly coffee, some toffee (like that of a Heath bar but not sweet), a touch of caramel, and slightly over-roasted malts. Only a little bit of alcohol hotness was present. This was a medium-bodied beer with roasted coffee flavor that hangs out in your mouth. Not sure that I can drink more than one of these beers per season."
"Notes: Pretty good. The nose does not do this beer justice. Not as bold as some of the better Baltic Porters out there. Probably more akin to how I imagine some of the older recipes to have tasted. Darkfruit tastes are prominent. Very malty, and certainly complex in that right, but it all seems to live in the shadow of the darkfruit esters."
"Poured a pleasing deep, dark brown with an almost non-existent head. Not totally opaque. Smelled of chocolate and coffee. The taste was not as bold as I was anticipating. The mouthfeel seemed thin. It didn't feel like a stout in my opinion. As for drinkability, it was a little rough around the edges while cold. The beer mellowed as it warmed in the mug, but it was not the most pleasing introduction to the style. Would I drink it again? Maybe, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a one finger espresso crema head that fades into a nice foam. On the nose it's a pretty distant but pleasant group of notes, mostly roasted malt and burnt coffee, some dark, wet grass. On the tongue those flavors come out much more distinctly, a big roasted presence up front with some combined hop and roast bitterness at the back. In the mouth it's a good deal thinner than I associate with the style, but pleasantly fuzzy on the way down. It's plenty drinkable and the price isn't outrageous. An up and down beer but pretty good."
"This is a very good beer and could really grow on me. A bit thin for the style, but I enjoy things sometimes differing from the norm. I wonder if this was fermented with lager yeast and not ale yeast in the same way I brewer my Baltic porter because it has the same muted malt taste."
"D- This was a bit of a disappoint for me. It wasn't bad, but it just didn't excite me. Maybe I just have such high expectations out of victory and baltic porters, but it didn't really merit a second purchase. It did hide the abv well though."
"d- okay, decent beer, i wouldn't seek this one out probably, but i'm glad that i had the chance to try this."
"D: A good overall brew, the good flavors make this an easily drank 22oz bottle. It goes down very smooth and the ABV is hidden very well and its presence is barely shown."
"Baltic Thunder is a very dark brown that appears black, but it's not, you can see some redness when held up to light. Either way it looks like a baltic and comes with a pretty foamy dark tan head up top with slight stickage. Smells include deep roasted malts, chocolate, peat, licorice and some olde porter qualities. Very refreshing, I've been staying away from the dark beer lately and this is a nice welcome back. It's not very gooey thick, like alot of baltics out there. The feel is pretty much medium, it's not that huge, carb is no problem here. While the body is a bit thin per style, the taste is not, Chocolate, traces of vanilla, cocco beans, roast, malt, peat, a touch of dark fruit and some licorice. A bit high in alcohol, I could probably drink two pints of this stuff. The lighter body makes for easier drinking here."
"Overall it is very smooth and easy to drink with nothing unpleasant and a lot to like."
"cash and wanted something decent to drink"
"Porters are my least favorite style, but I did enjoy this one. Victory is one of my favorite breweries."
"A mild on the baltic zest porter. Pour is a weak head of about a half a finger. Between dark amber brown and black. Nose of a bit of coffee and brown sugar. Palate is a baltic understated by and american porter. Sweet and warm, but no zest of baltic sour to clean the palate. Nice molasses. A tad boozy which is expected but the sweet isn't balance like a baltic with a leathery bitter sour earthy quality. A nice twist at most to some yes american porter aspects. Some anise to make things interesting."
"This is a really really good beer from Victory. I can't believe I've never had this before. I will definitely drink again and I highly recommend this one."
"Like a lot of reviewers I expected a bigger bolder beer but once I let it warm up it had lots of nuances and really worked as a food friendly Baltic Porter. Not in your face like a lot of takes on this style but rather a classy big beer with dark fruit and some chocolate on the finish."
"D: The beer is very drinkable for the style; the alcohol is well hidden from both the aroma and taste."
"I'm usually into the style but this is not for me. I can tell its put together well for a desert type pairing but for gobbling during a ball game it does not fit. Save this one for a nightcapper with some rich cake etc..."
"Drinks well for 8.5% abv. Solid flavor profile; quite enjoyable. Considering the bottle indicates it's nine months past its prime, it's all the more impressive."
"Delicious. Very rich with pleasing malt complexities. Excellent for pairing with a dessert or even as a night cap."
"That said, it's a delicious beer, whatever it is. I enjoyed it considerably."
"(3rd)"
"D- Smooth and not overly complex. I noticed hints of the alcohol now and then, but it doesn't show its higher alcohol content. I was quite surprised and enjoyed this beer a lot. Definitely drink it closer to room temperature otherwise you're not doing this brew justice. I don't know how often I would pick this up, but I would definitely drink it again."
"I would rate the drinkability of this beer as pretty good. I wouldn't mind having it again, and it was an enjoyable exploration of the style. A good beer to use as an introduction to porters."
"I liked this baltic porter. It isn't too complex but it has an all weather feel to it. If you can find it for under $5 I'd say try it out."
"D- A very very drinkable porter. This is a smooth drinker and the ABV is the only limiting thing on this. I would have no problem drinking a couple of bottles of this."
"fruity, toffee dry chocolate (you know, not a chocolate bar but the cooking stuff) flavors. deep roasts with some astringency add depth. the mouthfeel is robust enough but feels a little flat at the end"
"Pours a very dark brown with some reddish highlights and a fluffy, white tan head. Aromas of dark and caramel malts, Hershey's cocoa and hints of dark fruit. Good flavors here, chocolate, plums and molasses. Well balanced, with the alcohol hidden, and a nice dry finish. Glad I got to try this one, but I doubt I will go out of my way to track down another."
"D - fairly easy to drink, no hint of the slightly higher abv"
"Overall, I'm a little disappointed that I didn't take better notes. This was toward the end of a long tasting night, so I think I may have been getting on the drunk side. I do know that I enjoyed the beer quite a bit..."
"drinkability: good overall impy porter"
"To summarize - if you like oxidized beer with a ton of dark fruit character, you will like an aged Baltic Thunder. If you want more - probably not. Having tried this side by side with the Perkuno's Hammer, there really is no comparison, this beer is inferior in every possible way"
"Overall, a very nice beer that I look forward to having again."
"Overall, a very tasty porter with a nice fruity character. I like the dark fruit character and the bitterness of the roasted malt and hops. The heavyness of this one makes it a good beer for the end of the night."
"Thin mouthfeel, lacking body. Above average drinkability, well balanced but could use more character."
"D - I am in for one every now and then for history, but that is about it."
"There is some mild carbonation that gives a little bit of tingle early in the sip, but the finish is smooth and almost creamy. I don't doubt that there are better baltic porters out there, and I may have to return to this one later to re-review it to update my evolving palate and understanding of the style, but for now, this is pretty darn solid, and I look forward to really digging into this style. This is not a bad place to start."
"Lot of complexity in this beer. Pours a very dark brown that allows a bit of light through at the edges. Head isn't impressive though. Nose has roasty components with a suggestion of dark chocolate. On the palate there's ample malt and roasted malt to sweeten things, with again some dark chocolate, and some balancing hops. Overall I'm surprised of the malt slant. Finish is roasty."
"It isn't a terribly complex beer, but I still found it to be quite enjoyable. The wife likes it too, which is always a plus."
"Drinkability was high although I would have preferred a slightly less stout beer."
"edit almost a year later: this one resembles an old ale in some aspects. leathery and fruity (dark fruits)"
"Bottle, home. Disappointing baltic porter. This beer pours a translucent mahogany with very little head and what's there dissipated quickly, leaving a liquid looking more like wine than beer. There's so little head that I have to wonder if this is an off batch or something (will re-review in the future). The aroma is just ok for the style. It's a malt fruity version without too much roast. There's some chocolate and caramel in the mix, but it's mostly apricots, apples, plums, etc. The flavor is rather average, sweet and lacks a hook. There's just no real oomph to the beer. It's not bad, per se, but a distinct disappointment for the brewer and style, both of which I quite like normally. The mouthfeel is thin. The beer is drinkable and hides the alcohol well, but it also smells and tastes like a smaller beer. Not sure what happened here."
"D-with a name like Thunder I would think the beer would pack a bit more of a punch, overall a good beer, just wish there was a bit more to it"
"Pours a very dark ruby brown with about a finger of tan foamy head that dissipates fairly quickly. No real lacing is produced. The nose is dark malts, coffee, smoke, molasses, and chocolate. The taste somewhat follows, with notes of molasses, dark malts, brown sugar, light coffee, maple syrup, and some pine. The body is a heavy medium, with healthy carbonation and a thick, smooth feel, leading to a rather high drinkability."
"D: A decent, drinkable beer, but not the best Baltic Porter I've ever had. Victory has done better work in the past."
"D - very pleasant, was worried this could have been a disaster and a drainpour. i have had this beer fresh, just not recently, its definitely earned a chance at a fresh review. this one gets half a bonus point for aging gracefully."
"This is my first experience with the Baltic Porter style and I like it. This is a very good beer and could really grow on me. Knowing it's history I really wish I could have tasted it's predecessor, Heavyweight's Perkuno's Hammer."
"Overall, a respectable beer, though not outstanding."
"D= 4.0 Good beer love the brewery. This brew tasted a bit light to me but that also follows the style. I was expecting more of an american style porter. I just wanted a little more body. Good brew though"
"Pours to a real dark brown color with a smallish tan head that had great retention and left some nice lacing. The aroma seems very sweet, more of a roasted malt with some caramel coffee and chocolate coming through. An inviting brew for me. The taste is actually better than the nose, sweetness comes through more here with the chocolate and carmel flavor also a slightly burn brown sugar flavor. I am hard pressed to pick up coffee here though it seemed to be in the nose. There seems to be some dark fruit characteristics that meld with the sweetness. The feel of this brew is very smooth drinking, astringency is at a minimum for me. Overall a nice brew, a good brew by victory, but it is not the Perkuno's Hammer of years ago unfortunently, that brew just kicked it and is really missed. Someday I do hope that one can be recreated. Again nice brew by victory and am glad to see this one."
"D-this is a pretty easy drinking beer for all of the alcohol, it is not present at all. it doesn't really stand out, it takes a pretty standard attempt at the style; but manages to do standard quite well."
"D - Really enjoyed this one. I am not a huge Porter drinker, however, I like this a lot. The alcohol is well hidden in this, but also helps bring out some interesting notes with the yeast that are usually not present in a lower alcohol porter. More complex."
"Eh, I've had better. By no means horrible but also, by no means the definition of the style."
"Drinkability is pretty good. No alcohol presence, combined with pretty good flavor makes it go down easy."
"I really enjoy this well crafted big beer. Quite complex and dangerously drinkable! WIsh I had another bottle in the cellar."
"D- Very drinkable. Wouldn't think there was that much alcohol in this until you finish the bomber and stand up. Plus, I got this 22 for $3.49, excellent! Definitely worth checking out, and I'm glad to see you can get good beer without paying $10+ for a bomber. Definitely work getting!"
"D: Not up to snuff for Victory offering but not terrible -- it just seems uninspired."
"22oz. bottle served in a tulip. Enjoy by Jan 02 09 indicated on the label. Poured the color of cola with a half inch tan-colored head embedded with ringlets. Head sizzled and popped and lost its cohesion as it settled into a skim and thin band around the edges. No lacing on this one. Lots of dark fruit in the nose (plums and prunes), as well as some molasses. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a roasted quality, as well as some toffee and a hint of cocoa. Mouthfeel is light-medium (a little watery), with a light carbonation level and a little bit of heat at the back of the throat. A decent Baltic Porter; however, it didn't quite come together for me. Well worth a try though."
"The smell was toffee just as advertised with a sweetness dark fruit in the background. It smelled delicious and into the taste you got the molasses and prune fruits come into play. It finished semi dry and had a tad of burn hit the back of the throat on the way down. Overall very impressed. Not much for a porter fan but this is definitely one of the better porters to date."
"I like Okocim Porter best, but this is pretty good. The style is still pretty rare, so if I had a craving for one I'd give this another go. One problem is that it's a little cloying and a bomber feels like a lot of this. It really lays everything out there. I had my review 90% done after four ounces."
"Feel and Drinkability: Finish is dry and roasty. Acidity seems to heat the nostrils up a bit...carbonation carries it up the back of the throat when first starting to swallow then it seems to linger just back there where the nasal passage meets the throat...thats a new sensation...first time I've ever had that from a beer! Body is medium-light, I honestly expected something a bit heavier. Carbonation is light, as far as this beer is concerned...which is good since the body already seems light enough, much more carbonation and this would be obnoxiously prickly and would feel even lighter. This one is easy enough to drink but I think that I'd rather go with others over this one, I think that there's better out there and will continue to search for a better example of the style."
"D: solid brew from Victory, I enjoyed this more than Storm King as it has more of a roast character and less of a hop bite. The thin body makes it a bit more drinkable than some imperial stouts."
"3, 3.5, 35, 3, 3.5, Score 3.35"
"Hearty, full-bodied, rich, and delicious. Mmmm. Bitter meets malty and smooth, roasty meets sweet, ...it does represent the Baltic Porter style admirably. ""tempered with a touch of turmoil", eh...someone likes alliteration with their hyperbole. In this case, it works. Damned good."
"Clear and dark tone of burgandy. Big ol whipped crop of brown froth on top. Retention and lacing are outstanding. Big aroma of baltic goodness....chocolatey, roasty, bready. Nice. Flavor is very, very good too. Nice toffee roast malt base. Clean dark malt flavors intermingle with some dark fruits and a little black licorice. Velvety smooth mouthfeel. Creamy and easy going. And for 8.5% a/v, the alcohol is not detectable. It is integrated so finely into the fabric of this beer it is reduced to nothing. This is an excellent baltic porter."
"D- I could drink one or two before getting bored with it."
"Notes: This is a pretty solid Baltic Porter that went down really easily. Is it a world class effort? No. But for $5.99 a bottle you really can't go wrong if you're looking for an easy drinking, full-flavored porter. Just don't expect to have your socks knocked off and you'll be satisfied. Solid"
"Tasty but at the same time not really a stand out either."
"Baltic Thunder drinks well for sure as its soft milky smoothness and airy drying complexity offers a tasty and manageable beery treat. Sure, not quite the Baltic it could be but is quite nice as is; no matter what the style differences may calculate."
"Overall - Average"
"Pours a clear very dark brown with a good sized head. Nice lacing on the surface. Smell is malty with fruit notes. Toffee. Taste is sweet. Caramel and dark fruit flavors. A little balancing earthy hop bitterness in the finish provide some balance. Quite tasty. Full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Easy to drink. Very nice overall."
"Drinkability is good its an enjoyable porter even if I was expecting more."
"But I could drink it often."
"From tasting notes 2/22/09"
"OVERALL kinda big and bold for more than sipping. But very rich, complex and balanced. Well done representation of the style."
"Pours a clear brownish copper color, rather light for a porter. After one sniff it's immediately clear that this porter is a lager. Very clean scent with cocoa, dark chocolate, and a touch of smoke. Flavor is a little muted. Dark bread crusts and cocoa, with a crisp and clean finish. Drinks like a schwarzbier despite the high alcohol, which is imperceivable. Nice but needs more complexity and robustness."
"Ovreall: Very drinkable. Feels much lower than abv. Also very drinkable despite chocolate and roasty notes."
"I have been wanting this beer for a long time. After drinking it I wonder why I bothered. A lager interpretation of the style. Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head. The head settles to a thin cap. Just a little lacing is left on the glass. Has a clean lager aroma with hints of nuts and toffee. The flavor likewise clean and non offensive. It also lacks charactor. Hints of roasted nuts and chcolate. The body is really weak. This is suppose to be a bigger porter. It is thin and watery. Really weak. Thankfully the carbonation is not overdone. I am not impressed at all with this beer. Could use a lot more flavor and interesting flavor at that. Drinkable for sure but I will not be coming back."
"Drinkability:I'd definitely drink this again, my first baltic porter experience. Really sweet brew with a great finish, expected something with ALOT more viscosity but was pleasantly suprised with this actually."
"Overall, yet another solid offering from Victory. Before I had this, I had plans of buying a bunch for cellaring, but I just don't think this would benefit much from cellaring. It's a little watery, and the flavors could be much more pronounced. Still, it's a very good baltic porter, and I'm glad I tried it."
"Deliciously malty, but a well-rounded BP overall. Could definitely go for another."
"Pours a rich mahogany with a thick tan froth. Aromas of roasted hazelnuts, toffee, coffee, subtle dark fruits, molasses, chocolate covered raisins, light smoke and sweet alcohol follow through on the palate. The highlight of the beer is the incredibly smooth and creamy textured mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good (not great, but good) beer that, unfortunately, doesn't taste as good as it smells, but is incredibly well built and I'm at least happy to see another great brewery make a beer from an under appreciated category."
"The ABV is 8.5 which surprises my tongue, yet not my brain. Fuzz crept in nicely which could be scary if I had 3 of these around. Definite keeper, yet a ""treat"" brew."
"D: For a fairly big porter, this is surprisingly drinkable. The flavors mask the alcohol well and they are quite pleasant as well. I would definitely pick this one up again."
"D - Easily drinkable for a porter, not quite sessionable, but could do a few."
"This 22oz Baltic Porter pours a rich but not heavy dark, almost black. The head is dark tan and the stay is long, however there really is any lacing to speak of. The smell is of roasted malt with a bit of sweetness that politely asks, not begs, for you to take the first drink. Carbonation is medium and it rolls across the tongue fairly smooth with a subtle aftertaste that is nothing to be disappointed with. No outstanding alcohol flavor present which is good. This is one that could be drank on a regular basis and at any given time. Can't say that it is especially designed for but a good one to drink if you have it around. Unfortunately it is not a regular offering around here so this may be my only visit. Glad to have had the opportunity though."
"As for drinkabilitiy,I would say I didnt notice the high ABV when I was drinking this one."
"I love porters, I enjoy baltic porters, and I have enjoyed baltic porters poured into weizen glasses. Baltic Thunder must have gotten lost during the storm, because this beer is not working for me."
"I feel like this beer isn't very porter-like. The label claims it's a lager, which would make it pretty not-to-style then. Come to think of it, this beer is actually more reminiscent of German doppelbocks (which are lagers) to me. Still good beer though."
"Overall a fantastic beer. The only qualm I have with this particular offering is that there is little variation in flavor from start to finish. The initial malty sweetness that hits the palate initially is what continues to linger into the aftertaste."
"Overall, I enjoy this beer on occasional basis. Not one of my top favorites from Victory, but I wouldn't hesitate for a second if someone offered up a bottle."
"PS: I don't think I've ever reviewed a beer without repeating at least one of the scores twice, 3.0, 4.5, 4.0, 2.5, & 3.5, but this one was all over the board for me."
"Dr. A very nice porter that I could drink way too much of too quickly."
"Nice example of a nice style."
"The body is moderate. I would like a bit more depth there. But the complexity from the malt helps out. Carbonation is a bit low but ok for style. Overall some really nice malt notes but could be a touch more astringent and would like more body but still a very good beer."
"Drinkability: This is not all that great, really. Its not at all bad either though. It drinks pretty easy, and is cheap too. Give er a try."
"Carbonation is spot on for the style, and its not too slick in the mouth. This beer has a certain smoothness to it that keeps the sips in quick secession."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass; near-black with almost no head or lacing. The smell was near-sickeningly sweet, with raisin, overripe plum, dark chocolate, wood, and alcohol. Smells like an imbalanced dubbel or a decent Russian imp. stout. The flavor was dominated by syrupy-sweet chocolate-covered raisins soaked in alcohol, with an after-burn. There really isn't any qualities about this beer to call a 'porter' to mind; even the texture seemed a little off; more syrupy like an RIS rather than a creamy porter. I realize that this is supposed to be a hybrid style, but a hybrid usually exhibits qualities of the two styles in question, and this one doesn't. Thankfully I had some Hop Wallop on hand to bat clean-up."
"D: I could drink it all the time."
"Drinkability- This beer has a decent drinkability considering how big the alcohol is you dont have that much of a sense of it, you get a bit of back end warmth but its certainly drinkable, really more of a sipper and one you have to savor the complexity of the finish, not the greatest porter I have ever had but still a very respectable example of the style, kind of walks the line very closely between you making you feel your having a stout or porter, worth a try as a fan of victory they usually never do you to wrong : )"
"Between the bitterness, warmth, and body, I wouldn't say it has the most drinkability. Containing almost no carbonation after pour, this is a heavy drink."
"I gotta say I'm a fan of the style. I don't drink porters too often but when I do I usually wish they were ""bigger"" like this beer. It reminded me of a Lion stout - sweet dark fruit flavors followed by some alcohol kick. Definitely going to seek other other examples to do a comparison, but I liked this beer alot."
"D: This is a dangerously drinkable and tasty dark lager. I'm glad they finally brought it out here, I've been wanting to taste this legendary brew for a while, it didn't disappoint."
"Not creamy enough, and mouthfeel a bit light for what I like in a porter, but fairly drinkable nontheless."
"Very drinkable for a porter."
"- Bit filling and hard to drink very much, smooth and hides its strength... overall just an 'ok' porter.. not very impressed."
"D - good, flavorful porter... nice dark fruit tastes make this stand out"
"Pours a solid dark brown color with a deep ruby highlights and a small tightly bubbled tan head that shows poor retention. Smells of chocolate, toffee, caramel, cherries, ethanol. Taste is caramel and toffee up front. Chocolate and fruit come out midway but give way to a bit of warming heat and a long lingering caramel toffee on the palette. Fairly dry finish is a bit surprising. Medium to thick body, light level of carbonation, sweet creamy mouthfeel. I think I enjoyed this much more this time around. I guess fresher is better with this brew."
"Pours a deep brown/black, almost a dark cola, with a thick, fizzy tan colored head that quickly dissolves into a fine ring and head that remains atop the glass. The aroma is slight roasted malts, burnt toast and vanilla extract. Flavor is roasted malts upfront followed bitter chocolate, cocoa, more vanilla extract and finishes sweet and a little dry. It has a thin body with a great deal of carbonation. The vanilla extract feature in this beer is overly pronounced and the body is pretty thin. Besides those downfalls its not a bad beer and has some other tasty features but I think I may pass the next time I see this available."
"This is decently tasty, but not as complex as expected. Easy drinking considering the 8.5% ABV. An enjoyable beer, just not something I would prioritize in my beer drinking agenda. Worth trying."
"This is a pretty decent offering from Victory. Drinks easy enough at 8%. Worthy."
"Drinkable as a nightcap or dessert beer, but I think I'd be happy with just one. A decent version of the style, but not a favorite. I'd drink it again if it was the best one I could find and/or it was on sale, but I wouldn't put too much effort into chasing it down."
"Nice big 2 finger head thats very dark and creamy. Very dark and roasty color with some hughes of red. Nice and smooth body, suprisingly light for a porter. Light amount of sweetness and carbonation. It's got a great amount of alcohol as well at 8.5 abv, it's warming but not overpowering. Overall it's a very solid porter and really close to the style with the exception of the high alcohol, but it's so well done it's very welcomed."
"D- Yet another enjoyable beer from one of my favorite breweries. Was it the best baltic I've ever had? No. But it was good, good enough to have again and recommend trying."
"Pours deep and black with an off white head that hangs around for awhile, moderate lacing. Subtle ruby notes appear when held to the light. The smell is understated toffee and dark fruit and the alcohol is there, with just a soft warning.The flavor starts with dark cheeries and chocolate, rolls into toffee malts and finishes with a burst of hop bitterness. There's a nice vanilla to the midbody and the flavor makes you sit back and try again. It's not too heavy or surypy like many imperials or east euro porters and my 22 is almost gone already. I could go for another. This is a great beer."
"Good but not great, this offered a solid drinking experience but just doesn't compare to some of the better Baltic Porters out there. I was a bit disappointed in this, considering the pedigree that it came from."
"Pours roasty dark and mysterious. Some light head, nothing lingering. Smells sweet, roasty, a bit smokey. Not much in the way of hoppage, but this is an older bottle (drink by Dec 08), so my guess is any hops have faded. It's got an earthy bitterness to it, a sweet earthiness. Toffee mingling with smoke. Mouthfeel was less than expected, it almost felt a bit thin, not nearly as chewy as I was hoping. Very drinkable, though, surprisingly. Bitterness really doesn't give a kick. Now I wish I had tried a fresh one, to compare."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. The porter appears a clear dark brown color with about two fingers of light ecru foam. Nose and flavor are of nicely roasted grains, caramelized malts, mild milk chocolate notes, somewhat bitter, a pleasant sweetness comes through as it warms. Alcohol is not noticeable. A notch or two more than medium bodied with adequate carbonation for a baltic. Tasty and drinkable."
"Picked this up in Chicago, I have never seen it in the Twin Cities. Another great beer from Victory, just about everything I've had from them hits the mark. Maybe I got an older bottle, not a lot of hops, more of a smoky sweetness."
"All in all it's quite enjoyable and certainly something I would look forward to consuming again... and again."
"D: well done in the drinkability front considering it's a high gravity and pungent. One bomber is plenty, though. I'll return to this one, just not today."
"1143"
"Drinkability probably a little heavy for a day like today but I've been wanting to try this beer. Not really a session beer but definetly good for a tasting."
"This is a fine beer from an always dependable brewer. While, I would not quaff this as a supplement to a hot day of mowing the lawn, it will definitely go well on any cold winter night - unless you tend your lawn on a winter night. Enjoy!"
"This beer was a dark brown/black color with a very small tan head. It had the faintest aroma of sweet chocolate. Fortunately, it tasted far better than its aroma suggested. Mostly cocoa, a little bit of espresso, lingered well on the palate. The more I drank it, the better I liked it."
"D - Pretty drinkable - not something I would choose often, but not so coating or overbearing that I could not have a few."
"Opaque black color, with a creamy light caramel colored head, thick in nature. A malty and chocolaty aroma with touches of raisons, with currants as well. The maltiness comes through very strong, with a strong chocolaty flavor. A strong, hearty dark bread flavor comes in halfway, then a mild bitterness comes in on the back of the palate. A touch of a boozy flavor at the end. A medium to heavy body, it coats the palate and lingers there for some time, with chewy finish at the end. Avery strong beer with a robust aroma and flavor, along with a thick mouthfeel, makes one to sip this beer slowly."
"Very, very nice beer. I may to seek out some more of the style if the two I've tried are a fair representation."
"D - For a porter, its certainly drinkable. It's fuller bodied I'd say but it drinks like a medium bodied beer."
"Mouthfeel was adequately zippy. Light to medium in body."
"very recommended"
"M: medium bodied. mild carbonation level and ridiculously smooth."
"Drinkability: A decent Baltic, but lacks the depth of flavor and complexity of the best examples of the style"
"Thickness is good but they downplay the carbonation a bit too much for their own good. Still, a nice and unexpected stab at the style from one of my favorite breweries."
"Drinkability - At 8.5% abv, it's incredibly drinkable, didn't notice the alcohol at all. But at $7 for one bomber.. I feel it's a tad overpriced and would rather go for a six of an American porter instead (Anchor, Smuttynose...) Definitely worth a try"
"Pours from the 22oz. bottle a root beer-ish dark brown with a one finger tan head that quickly fades away into almost nothing. Can't tell what degree of carbonation is going on in the darkness. Aroma is of smoky yet sweet toffee-ish malts. Taste matches the aroma exactly...a pleasant, damned near perfect mix of smokiness & sweetness! There is a nice ""sparklyness"" on the tongue that is not too fizzy. The mouthfeel is down the middle...not too heavy, night too light. Now I see why there was such a clamor for this beer. I'm really not a porter fan, but if there are more like this, I soon will be! Cheers, Victory!!!"
"Good brew - Yet another stellar beer from Victory."
"D: While Victory's hoppy pale ales and lagers rarely miss the mark, I've found their stouts and porters to be a bit disappointing thus far. That's not to say this isn't a pretty good beer, but the look and mouthfeel are a bit weak, and the flavor profile seems somewhat unbalanced."
"Tasty mild baltic porter, I liked this one a bit more than A."
"This beer is exemplary of the style. The typical smokiness is definitely present here. Definitely recommended to fans of smoked beers or those who find English or American porters to be too heavy."
"22 ounce bottle, best before 3/26/2009. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours black with about a half inch tan head. The head went away pretty quickly, and there isn't much lacing. It smells like roasted malt, dark and milk chocolate, and a bit of coffee. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some dark fruit and smoke. Good mix of sweet and bitter in the taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and a bit slick with average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink and the 8.5% ABV isn't very noticable at all. I think this is a good brew, I'd definitely buy this again."
"Bottle: Poured a black color porter with an average size foamy head with average retention and some light lacing. Aroma is a mix of roasted malt with light bitter notes and medium black chocolate. Taste is also a nice enough mix between some roasted malt with notes of black chocolate. Body is about average with no apparent alcohol and some good carbonation. I was expecting a lot more character and must admit to having been slightly disappointed."
"Pours out a very dark brew with light barely visible throught it. Small tan head. Smells lightly of alcohol,sweetness and a bit of hops mixed in. Sweet tasting brew with a lingering bitterness.After a while the bitterness becomes annoying.Hard to describe. Mouthfeel is ok . Drinkability suffers due to earlier mentioned lingering bitterness."
"Nice roasted flavors as well. Some toffee, chocolate, and coffee in the flavors as well. Well done. Great beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with just a touch of carbonation pop. Recommend."
"I'm not too familiar with Baltic Porters, but there seem to be more breweries putting them out so I am interested in trying more, any suggestions?"
"This is one hell of a beer. Nice creamy head, disappates quickly, however. Dark roasty malts on the palate, with a good balance of hops on the back end. Strong as hell. Black color on the pour, some frosted coffee on the nose. Dark chocolate also on the palate. Well balanced beer, needs to come in sixers."
"All around not a bad baltic porter at all. I do think it was much better on tap, so I'll have to try that again sometime soon."
"The aroma is nice with chocolate, toasted malt, and some dark fruit. The appearance is brown with an average sized head. The flavor is like the aroma with plenty of alcohol. The palate is a bit thin. Overall it's a fine beer. I would drink this again."
"I have tried many porters but this was my first Baltic. All in all fairly good."
"Overall, I don't think this is one of the best Baltic Porters out there but it's not bad either, especially considering they aren't the easiest style to find, unfortunately."
"This is a good beer, a little misleading in the aroma, but excellent until the end in all aspects. This offers a great flavor equilibrium leaving you to pine for another sip."
"22 oz. bomber, best by 12/31/08, sampled many months before that date. Brewed with European whole hops and imported German malts. It pours very near black, with a two inch, foamy beige head that quickly recedes to a quarter inch, leaving some lacing along the way. Very clean, lager-esque aroma, with a touch of roasty malts and slowly emerging hops. Roasted and chocolate malts on the palate, lightly astringent, with gentle, mildly bitter hops, and a bit of heat. The body starts lightly tingly, dry and powdery, but becomes smooth and silky with a roasted finish. Overall not terribly complex, and a bit more mild than I'd like, but it's tasty and pretty damn drinkable. Would definitely revisit."
"D- This beer has a very smooth fresh flavor with great dark malt flavors but still keeping it to the porter flavors with not that char of a impy stout."
"Pours a clear dark cola color with reddish hues and a shallow foamy tan head that fades slowly with little lacing. The smell is nice; a rich malted-milk ball and molasses. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is medium-light textured with a rustling tang (from the alcohol?). A real nice drinker, the 8.5% ABV is well integrated with a slight warming sensation on the way down. The NECCO chocolate flavor and malted milk thing in the nose is true to the taste. Not my favorite, but not bad."
"Pours black with appropriately minimal head for a porter. Nose is faintly sweet with chocolate and a barely-there roasted quality. Roasted barley jumps out on the tongue, grows stronger at the finish. A little thin on the mouth, but not disappointingly so. For 8.5%, this is a very drinkable porter."
"Overall a very good brew, not one of my favorites of the style, but still good."
"Overall good drinkability. Not my favorite, but still good."
"D - A good example of a Porter, a little more carbonation than I like in my porters, but overall a good beer"
"D- High alcohol makes this less drinkable than other styles. Pretty decent drinkability for this kind of beer."
"Pours dark with a tan head - nothing too spectacular. Smell is malty, with caramel and roasted aromas dominating. Flavors of mild roasted/smokiness and slight bittersweet chocolate notes. Full-bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Probably not the easiest beer to drink but not terribly harsh either."
"D: Drinks pretty easily and goes down smoothly. An enjoyable smokey treat that definitely has the characteristics to please the palate and warm you up during the winter months."
"Very dark, more purple than black though. head is big and frothy, sticks around for a bit, then dissapears. Nose is fruity, figs and cherries and raisin. very little hop aroma. taste is chocolate, with cherries and plum in the middle. toffee finish. mouthfeel is really nice. thought it was going to be more syrupy, but it is pleasantly creamy with a chewyness. a touch syrupy, but it doesn't detract at all. well carbonated to carry off the booze. booze is pretty well hidden, though it does show itself in the back of the throat as it goes down. all in all, pretty tasty."
"22oz bomber into a Duvel tulip. Pours an almost opaque black that shows an ever-so-slight trace of ruby highlights when held to light. The beer is topped by a thin barely-there head that lasts as a thin layer. Aroma is a decent amount of brown malt and a hint of powdered cocoa. The taste is more balanced between brown malt and bitter cocoa with a trace of hops in the background. The beer is on the high side of medium with decent warming alcohol. This is a decent Baltic, but since I live in Duck Rabbit country, I'll be sticking with theirs."
"D: Very drinkable example of the style, good flavor combined with lighter MF makes for great experience."
"The hops in the porter are very well done. Nicely incorporated and sneaky. Recommended."
"Solid beer that is worth trying. A great example of the style."
"More spoils from Ryan--I can no longer in good conscience discuss fantasy sports conquests on this location... pitch black body with a two-finger brown head... head is creamy and settles evenly--adorns a Hop Devil glass with attitude... malty presence is obvious.... no scent of peas or olives (!?).... clean and a bit toasted... smooth, medium-bodied, slightly effervescent at the throat... strangely no hints of alcohol mixed beautifully... consistent malty character with a toffee sweetness at its finish.... exhales reveal some grapefruit/citrus hints, soft and understated.. my first opportunity to taste a Baltic porter, I can admit my expectations were somewhat accurate, but the citrusy finish is a surprise. What isn't is Victory crafting a nother winner..."
"Spotless and squeaky clean brown color, dark red-amber at the rims, thin, if persistent, brown colored head of tiny bubbles. While the roast and coffee obvious in the nose, the nuttiness is the leader of the pack, adds a brisk vibrancy which is followed up on by baking dough and flour notes, barley, oats and brown sugar, even with much hops presence has a sinewy, muscular feel in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, yet lighter than expected, goes for smooth fluidity over resonance. The carbonation is strong enough that it disperses the flavors to create an inner mouth airiness and perfume rather than soaking presence. Coffee, butter, cola, brown sugar, would be sweet if not for the aforementioned, polished malty oats and dough. Nothing bitter here, lightly roasted with only a gradual uptick in hops at the end. Drinkability key attribute."
"One of the better American examples of a Baltic porter, certainly, but doesn't equal its mythical ancestor, Pekuno's Hammer."
"I tried this side by side with Perkuno's Hammer(Thanks Beerloco!) and it wasn't nearly as good as Perkuno's, which reminded me a bit of Okocim. It could have just been the age on the Hammer though."
"Has a roasty, toasty hoppy flavor. Why does the label claim this is a lager? Not sure, but the light nose and the thin body would make more sense. Alcohol taste is pretty prevalent, a bit too boozy for me. Alot of fruitiness comes forth as the beer warms. I also get some oak chip like lingering effect in the throat. Has some astringency as well. It's a decent enough beer, but I cant say that I love it."
"D_Pretty spot on style-wise. Another good brew from Victory and on par with some of the better Baltics."
"I compare all porters to Perkuno's Hammer, which, in my opinion, is the gold standard for modern porters. This however, is quite worthwhile if you cannot get your hands on the Hammer. No Victory beers will let you down."
"This beer pours a clear dark DEEP brown, that when held to the light has some reddish tinge to it. A thick light tan head forms with decent retention. Lacing is left the entire way down the glass. Smell is of caramel, light chocolate, very malty, aroma is subdued for its strength though. Taste leaves a bit to be desired. It is a bit nutty, caramel, a bit of sourness in the finish, malty but really bland. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. Not a bad beer, but not one that I will pick up again."
"Great drinkability. Very tasty and very smooth. Wish I had a couple more of these."
"Date consumed: 25 August 2008"
"D: probaly won't go back for another due to my not liking the taste very much and lack of mouthfeel."
"D: Good, a solid example of the style."
"Pours a pretty dark brown with garnet highlights. Just a quick film of head after the pour that goes down to nothing in a flash. Muted roast, maybe some black currant nuances. Just a touch of bandaides though. Maybe some marshmellows, roasted pumpenickle bread. But some medicinal flavors sour the atertaste. The palate is a little bitter and choppy. The alcohol breathes some warmth through the nose. A little hard to drink."
"M/D: Full bodied and a bit prickly. Drinkability is alright. Overall, just a better than average beer for me, but the taste does carry the beer somewhat."
"Pours a black drink with a dissipating cinnamon head. A flavorful creamy chocolate aroma flows very well. Flavors of chocolate covered black cherries, malty, toffee, alcoholic burn. That alcoholic burn lies in the aftertaste and lingers at the back of the tongue for a while which is a big turn off. Heavy, milky body with an alcoholic sting. Not my bag baby but some palates could love it."
"The lighter mouthfeel only makes this brew easier to drink. Especially since the alcohol is completely masked. I literally don't detect it at all - even in the finish. Very easy to drink, sip on. In my opinion, Victory is hit or miss - this is one of their hits. Recommended."
"Hand-carried from Pennsylvania to Vienna (thanks Jeff and Chris!), the bomber looks just like the picture here. The brew pours a very dark but clear cola brown under a two finger deep tan head that fades a bit too quickly and fails to muster any lace. The nose is rich and strong, full of caramel and nuts, with just a touch of smoke. The mouth is thick, but not sticky, leaving the palate rather clean. The taste is as a porter should be, but not knock-your-socks-off good. There's roasted nuts and caramel, plus a touch of plum in the opening, chased by a respectable, certainly not overwhelming hops presence that leaves a coffee bitter feel in the aftertaste. The fruit and coffee linger in roughly equal proportion long after the liquid is gone. This is a solid, but not a spectacular product."
"Aroma is rich and smoky, and has hints of coffee and molasses. Color is a barely translucent dark brown with a thick, tan, fairly persistent head. Flavor has quite a strong nip to it, like hard liquor. Other than that, it is somewhat typical of a good porter, like roast coffee with hints of molasses and unsweetened chocolate. Texture is smooth and tingly, very pleasant to swallow."
"Drinkability is pretty good, even if this isn't the greatest example of a BP, it's very smooth. Haven't had it fresh, but it certainly seems to have held up well after almost a year, though I'm not sure I'd let it run to much longer, but who knows? Not a great BP, but a tasty beer. I followed the hype on Heavyweight redoing this one at Victory, living in PA in the past, and then the discord on this rendition...while I wish I had the first version, and love a real deal BP, I enjoyed this, and if it was in a more reasonably priced 12 oz. package, I'd probably pick it up again. I grade everything else by style, but not here - it's a very good beer."
"(rated May 29, 2008)"
"Doesn't have a long-lasting head and the smell is less than what I would have expected. However, the malty/coffee taste was appealing. The biggest surprise of all was the lack of a higher alcohol feel even though it was 8.5%. Obviously not a session beer but, despite my preference for IPA's, one I might purchase again particularly if it came out in 12 oz. bottles rather than bombers. If nothing else, I'm no longer intimidated by the label."
"Notes: Never had Perkuno's Hammer but I can only imagine how good it was."
"Pours thickly, black, medium head, quickly dissipating. Aroma is malty. Flavor is roasted, coffee beans, some chocolate sweetness. Thick mouthfeel, creamy, good finish, a tad bit too much carbonation. Very good, worth the try."
"taste is of chocolate, coffee, some nuts, touch of licorice, and malt in the back, ends a little bitter and somewhat dry."
"I was looking forward to this beer and feel disappointed. I took this from a 60 degree cellar and only refrigerated for a half-hour. I think it should have been served a little colder, but I don't think it would have changed everything. I'm not against trying this one again, as I am usually happy with the Victory line on beers."
"Admittedly I'm not very familiar with this style. It was a full beer, tasty and easy to drink. I enjoyed it, but one is good for now."
"The drink is on the lighter side of medium-bodied with nice carbonation and feel. The alcohol is well-hidden and the beer quite drinkable."
"Very dark ruby body that looks dark brown at first. Resists head formation, but it retains enough of it to remind you that it isn't flat. Oaky vanilla and sugar right away, hints of coffee and plumb closer to the finish. Light anise flavors come and go. It all works together very nicely. Definitely some roasted qualities, but not as much as I was expecting. Just enough booziness to remind you that you are drinking a baltic porter. Not bad at all. Bubbly mouthfeel, with a little viscosity. Alcohol gets to your head before you even realize it."
"Clear black pour with nice dark brown around the edges. Minimal head. Roasty malt, chocolate aromas. A fair of carbonation in the mouth. Very nice standard porter flavors. Malt, peat, chocolate and a small amount of coffee. I wouldn't say this is outstanding as a baltic, but a really good flavored standard porter with some extra alcohol. Should be heavier bodied. A bit of a dangerous drinkability for the abv."
"Deep dark brown with black highlights, topped with a two finger thick head that disappears into a thin ring. Aroma is not as creamy as I was expecting, I mean it smells creamy but in a chemical sort of way. Husky sweet malt, bits of chocolate chips. Slightly boozy, a bit grainy, just feels lacking all around, like a watered down version of a Baltic porter. there are a lot of just plain old porters with a bigger body and flavor profile than this beer. Frankly I am disappointed in this beer because this style is one of my recent favorites. Would not recommend, many better options available for the same price or less."
"Pours pitch black with a huge frothy beige head. Aroma of roasty malts, chocolate and coffee. A ton of oatmeal up front followed by roasted coffee and chcolate maltiness. Hints of caramel and toffee with a sweet yet bitter dry finish."
"Baltic Thunder has the misfortune of being compared to one of the best beers of all-time. Even so, I've given it a more than fair shake when it comes to scoring. It's a shame that this big ale couldn't have recaptured the magic of the original, but then life doesn't always work out the way it should."
"One last kudos to Victory for putting this into bombers, a decision which I could not be happier about. With plenty of flavour (but still no alcohol) coming with warming, this sized serving is perfect to cuddle up to on a cold, rainy night. I'm a big fan of Baltic Porters and this is not only true to style, but also one of the best examples I've come across."
"D- this one almost drinks itself. very easy to finish and im kicking myself that i only got one bomber of this. another win for victory, check this one out of you get the chance. a great example of a decently rare style. too bad this one isnt year round."
"22oz bomber from the Liquor Shop in Tyngsborro, Mass. My first Victory beer! Pours a nearly opaque black body with ruby-red highlights and a quarter inch of short-lived light tan head. Hints of chocolate, caramel, and coffee characterize the aroma. Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, a tinge of grassy hops. Full-bodied with ample carbonation. Way too drinkable for the flavor and ABV. Wow. A phenomenal beer; flavorful, balanced, one sip definitely invites another. The best Baltic porter I have ever had."
"A very nice midly warming porter. Tobacco flavors a bit strong for my taste, but not so as to detract from beer. A style to which there is not much to compare, but an overall enjoyable beer."
"I poured a bomber into a 23 ounce glass. It is a pretty impressive pour, jet black with a thin white head. I enjoyed the smell, rather boozy. There are hints of chocolate, but alchohol wins the day. This is a true malt bomb. There are hints of chocolate, coffee and alcohol in this brew. The finish is crisp and smooth. This beer is a medium bodied sipper and a damn enjoyable one."
"D: Holy crap, give me some more. I could drink this all night and that's something I can't say about nearly any other porter - usually all the sweetness gets to me after a bit. Finally, a delicious winter brew without all that spiciness."
"Essentially an understated drinkable Baltic Porter. The normal sourness of the style is understated and balanced. Chocolate malt,Licorice/anise,a dash of coffee, its in the smell and the taste. Basically a decent porter with high abv (undetectable).Average plus mouthfeel."
"MF&D - Overall a pretty nice porter. The ABV is high preventing this one from being good for a session. Much better warmed that straight from the fridge."
"M a little too carbonated for the style, a little too bitter."
"D - Drinkability is very good and where this beer truly starts to shine. This one does not come across as even close to 8.5 %. That, along with the relatively light body make this go down way to quick. No problem at all recommending this brew."
"Not bad, but plenty of better Baltic Porters out in the market to sample."
"Victory did a nice job with this one. It really doesn't have any glaring flaws and is an all around solid beer. It's not one of those beers that ""wows," but it is so straight forward and solid that it impresses. Easily recommended."
"Bomber- pours a dark ruby with two finder beige head. Nose- sweet dark fruits, faint sweet malts. Taste- earthy, medium roast, stale sweetness. Light to medium body, roasty finsih. Nothing too exciting here, but drinkability isn't too bad. Not picking up the beans that have been added"
"I have been looking forward to this beer since it's been released. I've had my eye on the Heavyweight version since I've joined this site and was expecting a lot out of this beer. I have to say I was let down. Baltic Thunder doesn't live up to Victory standards or the standards of the few Heavyweights I've sampled."
"This is a delicious porter and I'd love to get my hands on more of it. Typical high quality well crafted Victory beer."
"This is a wonderful example of the style. Poured up extremely dark, but when held to a lamp, lit up a dark burgundy colour. Smell was faint chocolate, coffee, whiskey, freshly sawn oak, and a bit of a damp, black, soil smell. Very nice. Most of these were reflected in the taste, too, with the addition of a smokey flavour that isn't really detectable in the smell. Mouthfeel was better than average, but in a Baltic Porter, and an 8%abv+ Baltic Porter,I would have liked to have seen this substantially thicker. Over all, though, I found this to be a wonderful American example of one of my favourite styles."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkablity: The beer seems to have an anemic body. I need a porter with some back. I am like Mixalot in this. Baby has to have back. The beer isnt a total chore to drink. I wouldnt have had 6 of these except in the excitment of Hammer reborn hype I got a case. Hoping the next 6 gather more character with a year in the cellar."
"Dark roasted malts with hints of coffee. Alcohol is quite hidden. Dark fruitiness and creamy bakers chocolate."
"Drinkability: Big time flavor and fantastically smooth. Watch out for the ABV, but other than that, DRINK UP BABY!"
"22oz bomber: This one pours an opaque dark brown. there was a decent tan head on it, but it dropped away rather quickly. It leaves no lacing. Really rich aroma. Chocolate and maple are predominate. The taste is quite complex. Hints of chocolate, roastiness, coffee, some dark fruits. There are some hops in there that balance out the sweetness nicely. This is a really good brew."
"Overall this is a solid Baltic Porter. Victory does nothing but impress me time after time. Definitely give this one a shot."
"Comments- A terrific Baltic porter. I wanted another..."
"I'm not really crazy about this beer. It's decent and definitely drinkable, just feels very much out of balance."
"A creamy roastyness up frount with a layered dark fruitness followed by baker chocolate has a nice sharp clean dry bitterness,tangy with a chocolaty fade. A lighter body than expected nice creamyness.The alcohol was well hidden. Still not a beer i could drink a lot of. A nice Baltic would prefer Duck Rabbit if i had to pick from the two. I bought a case when it first came out, it had mellowed a bit yet still close to when it was fresh.Not a beer that's worthy of aging to me, said drink by Dec08 on side of case."
"Pours clear dark mahogany with a finger of foam that disappears too quickly. Not much lace on the glass either. Smells like grainy chocolate milk with coffee overtones. Flavor is much better than suggested by the aroma. Strong coffee and chocolate malts blend into a very fruity center. Plums and raisins abound, with hot alcohol becoming prominent over time. Finishes with dry burnt toast notes. Excellent creamy body with balanced weight and carbonation. Underwhelming at first sip, but becomes significantly better over time."
"Drink ability - A good beer that I am glad I tried I suppose I would buy again."
"Drinkability - gets better as it goes, I ended up really savoring the olast half of the bomber. Big thumbs up to this and to kkipple for the hookup at DLD08."
"Pours a clear dark reddish brown, quite nice held up to the light, very thick light tan head forms, drops some decent lacing on its way down, sticks to a solid layer and ring around the glass, nice retention. Smell is neat, caramel, dark fruits, raisins, light chocolate, very malty, cake, bit of vanilla, some floral, almost a light smokiness, aroma is subdued for its strength though. Taste is not too pleasant, a bit nutty, caramel, roast, bready, raisins, iron, a bit of floral and a light sourness in the finish, malty but really bland. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light to medium carbonation, goes down easy for 8.5% but I was expecting a lot more considing how genius Perkuno's Hammer was, quite a let down by Victory. I was going to do a side by side with Perkuno but Baltic Thunder is not worthy of that."
"An ok beer that is burdened by its history and suffered a difficult birth. Expecting far more from the next batch."
"Excellent beer. I've had a couple ""Baltic Porters", and to me the style is essentially a slightly lighter Russian Imperial Stout. This was a strong dark, malty beer with a lot of chocolate/coffee flavor. Strong but drinkable. Very well done."
"I'll be picking up an armful of these to cellar away for the coming months. I can imagine this working well sitting around a campfire on a cool autumn evening."
"D: The abv is high but there is no evident of the boozy heat. I could have had another bottle of this."
"Pours a very dark brown, close to being black in color. Nice one inch head sits atop the glass. Smell is very roasted and dark malts. Taste is more of the roasted malt and some light coffee flavoring. Taste is rich and creamy as well. This is a solid porter. I had an aged bottle of the Perkuno and I prefer this fresh bottle to it."
"This beer is actually quite quaffable, which can be a little dangerous in a beer of this strength. A tasty beer, but it perhaps doesn't quite live up to the original; perhaps it is that extra 1/2% of attenuation, as this seems like it could have used just a touch more body and malt richness."
"Pretty good Baltic porter. Worth a try."
"The mouthfeel is good, not too thick though, which actually increases the drinkability. There is a great richness and smoothness that goes down very easily with this beer, especially at 8.5% ABV and I could definitely have some more of this beer."
"d - Very high. I really like this beer. Lots of great flavors, not too heavy, nice alcohol buzz."
"D: Very drinkable, even at 8.5%. Man, I love me a good Baltic Porter. Another great brew provided by my good buddy, Alan. Thanks, bro!"
"Pours a clear dark purplish brown with a good 3 fingers of foamy tan head. Good lasting retention leaves a thin ring of lacing. Smells of toffee, apricot, black currant, chocolate, and coffee. Tastes of grain malt, caramel and toffee up front followed by a nice assortment of fruits like cherries, figs, apricot, and black currant. Finishes with flavors of chocolate and coffee with a touch of smokiness. Medium semi-thick body with low carbonation. Roasted flavors with a touch of smoke with nice citrus tones. I had hoped that with some age it would be more like Perkuno, but it just isn't the same. Still, not a Baltic Porter that I would turn up my nose at."
"this is a forehead warmer... its good but its a one and out, i'd be struggling to drink another glass. id say if you've already eaten your bowl of gruel and can sneak out to the docks on your wife and 5 children then get a bottle of this and drink it..."
"Notes: Got this one as an extra from Azurelimits, a great new trader. Thanks!"
"nothing spectacular, but a great value."
"22 ounce bomber. The beer poured with a smooth black appearance with hints of amber easily shown. Brown, frothy head evaporated eventually, leaving little to no lacing. Aromas were wonderfully rich of malts, alcohol, dark fruits (grapes, cherries). The general taste was mildly sweet with a lagging bitter aftertaste. I would say it definitely had typical Baltic Porter acidic dimensions, especially from its fruity ingredients. Slightly woody and smoky. Mouthfeel was very smooth and the texture helped give it a nice, almost wine-like feel to it. Overall, a great drink."
"this one is not black enough, and not hopey enough for me, a bit to sweet for me to, ther porter is a far better brew, now for the good, this is better than any fizzy yellow lager hands down and the abv is nice, i would have anouther if it were given to me but i dont see myself to buy another one of theese"
"d: This was pretty good, but I won't hurry back."
"Drinkability for me is good. I like this and I'll get more as long as my store still has any. Had this with ribs, and I'd reccomend this with any barbecue."
"Drinkability is good. It's an interesting sipper that hides it's ABV well."
"D: It was not torture to finish off a 22 oz. bottle, but it took effort. The drinkability of Victory's Baltic Thunder is not going to rank very highly in this reviewers mind."
"Overall not a bad beer, there are better ones. This beer is the equivalent of blue balls."
"Pours a deep black with reddish tint along the edges of the glass, thick, soap bubble, latte colored head. The aroma is an inviting mix of malts and spices. The flavor was very nice, had only tried a very aged draft of the Perkuno's Hammer, but can see what sets this style apart. There are bold flavors of coffee, chocolate and molasses on top of the traditional porter style. The mouthfeel was surprisingly smooth, thought it would have had a little more bite as an ale with a higher abv, very pleasant though. I could drink these all night, i heard they had to blend this first batch so am really looking forward to how the new batches come out, this one was a solid offering from good ol Victory."
"A fat carmel brown three finger head shows active carbonation and dances down in about 3 minutes. Body is bold jet black and lets no light through. Nose is full of spicey zest, minerals and some roasted nuttiness, and maybe a hint of sweet alchol laced toffee. Enters the mouth very smooth with some zesty smokiness and then a layer of flat burnt crust buttered biscuit like sweetness. There are some dark dry fruit notes that show themselves on the second half of the palate. A dark alchol feel mixes with a dry bitter on the end of the palate to create a rather thick mouthfeel. Good drinkability overall."
"A very enjoyable beer. Rich, and full-flavored, but smooth. Could pair nicely with some chocolately desserts. Definitely recommend."
"Didn't this was a one-shot; I feel far more privileged than I did three minutes ago. It looks how a porter should: a deep brown color with a big three finger tan head that takes it's time dissolving and leaves solid lacing as it goes. Nose is tons of roasted malt, with nice swirls of dried fruit on top. Sweetens up a lot as it warms. Some light spiciness in there as well. Flavor's similar, and quite delicious. Tons of chocolate malt, with a good bit of caramel, and then all kinds of fruit flavors: raisins, prunes, and maybe even a little apricot. Not even a hint of alcohol. Definitely starts drier, with coffee bitterness, then gets more fruity and complex as it goes down. Body is nice and thick, with a near perfect carbonation level. I hadn't really considered it before, but I guess the Baltic style of porter is really the ""Imperial"" version, what with the high alcohol and the huge flavors. This one really is delicious, and an excellent offering from Victory (although their track record is pretty impressive, in my book, so it doesn't really come as any surprise)."
"Drinkability: The got surprisingly better from what I remember tasting upon it's release. Still not as good as Perkuno's Hammer. A good brew!"
"Medium body with a slick thin mouthfeel. Drinkable for the abv. A good beer for the style. But in my honest opinion, not quite as good as the now extinct brew it tips it's hat to."
"Very good beer, im a big fan too bad it's not available in minnesota"
"D'ablity - a bit subdued compared to some examples of the style, but a highly drinkable 8.5% porter. Almost more of a big robust porter, without lots of crazy ""Baltic"" character. Not a shining example of the style, but a very nice beer."
"Pours dark brown/black with a medium tan head. Aroma of chocolate, toffee, and malt. Very nice taste with dark chocolate sweetness blending nicely with with hops. Notes of dark fruit too and winter spices too. Beer is very big, but the tastes are on point. Very nice, very flavorful beer."
"A very fine porter."
"Notes: A very, very nice porter from one of my favorite breweries. Good dessert beer as the malt sweetness is dominates. Would recommend and will definitely try again."
"Good example of the style but not quite up to Sinebrychoff or Duck Rabbit. Still, this is a worthy brew. I certainly wouldn't turn it down if I could get another one."
"this one threw me a little. doesn't really smell or taste like any baltic i've ever had. carbonation is high. blindfolded i'd swear it was a decent doppelbock, but not even a great one. pretty disappointed in this one as i was really looking forward to it and it just didn't deliver."
"OVerall a very nice baltic porter and pretty faithful to the style."
"D - Not a bad beer but somewhat boring and lacking a little in each area. I was disappointed expecting it to be similar to Perkuno's. I cracked open my last Hammer for comparison and the 3 year old Hammer is still much better and much more flavorful. I am really going to miss the Hammer."
"This is another great offering from Victory."
"Drinkability: My first of the sytle, I enjoyed it a great deal. I was trying to split the 22oz bomber between lunch and dinner but found myself yearning for the last half long before dinner. Another winner from Victory."
"Pours a one finger light tan head that fades quickly and leaves a little lace. Deep amber almost mahogany color. Strong carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Flavor is almost burnt, sweet coffee, slight bitter finish. Decent Baltic porter. $6.20 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Not a bad beer, but a little more character in the flavor profile would be welcome. Nonetheless drinkable and enjoyable."
"D - Good brew. EGledhill was gracious enough to send me two bottles so I'm anxious to see how this ages."
"This beer came highly touted as the reincarnation of the now defunct Heavyweight Brewery's Percuno's Hammer. And anyone who's had the pleasure of Percuno's Hammer would certainly want to compare. I found the beer pours nice and dark with an almost invisible head, Tastes of fruitiness abounds with a slightly hoppy taste. I'd recommend this brew to any fan of Victory!"
"This poured an opaque cherry black with tan head. It smelled like faint, watery plum and currant with some yeast. It tasted like earthy malt, chocolate, and a bit of cherries. It was slightly thick with no carbonation and had a semi-sweet chocolate aftertaste. Overall this wasn't necessarily a bland beer, but its flavor (and scent) just never grabbed me. At least it was well rounded and easy to drink, and entirely unoffensive."
"D: The alcohol warming makes you slow down a bit on this one. For such a dark thick beer its relatively drinkable."
"Bottle picked up for me by my dad. Pours dark, almost black but not opaque or murky at all. Short tan head. Rummy, plummy, and chocolate odor. Notes of toffee and vanilla. Smells pretty darn good. Taste is also chocolatey and plummy. Coca-cola and malt flavors and a slight charcoal note. Raisins and vanilla too. Pretty good for the style, becoming fruiter as it warms. Not a massively thick BP, but thick enough. I think its a good interpretation, though it doesnt beat out Sinebrychoff or Okocim, IMO."
"Overall, not bad - but I don't see myself coming back to it either."
"Definitely interesting. I haven't had a whole lot of beers in this style, but I've had a few. This one shares characteristics with the others I've had, but isn't really like any of them. I feel like the ones I've had before are more stout-like, whereas this one definitely establishes itself as a porter. It's very good, and I'd definitely have it again. Recommended."
"Thanks again to George for this unusual brew. Never had Perkeno's Hammer so I can't compare but hell, this is pretty good."
"Pours with a thin fizzy tan head that falls to a small ring quick. Opaque brown, not as dark as I'd expected. Smell is somewhat light and not too appealing. Light roast, sweet sugared fruit. Reminds me of a cherry/grape mixed popsicle with some dark malts. Taste isn't much better. Still sweet and fruity but toward the end a decent depth approaches. Good chocolate, caramel, and light touch of coffee. A nice roasty, almost smokey aftertaste. Mouthfeel isn't quite as close to the full side as I'd hoped, either. Actually pretty thin. Average at best overall. Not the greatest take on a Baltic Porter, sorry to say."
"Notes: I've never had Perkuno's Hammer, so I don't know how this matches up. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't overly impressed. Probably won't get it again, especially at $6.49 for a bomber (at Westmere Beverage Ctr in Guilderland) -- I can find porters I like better for less cash."
"I'm sure this beer has been compared to Perkuno's countless times and yet I'm going to do it again. Nice offering from Victory but I don't think it lives up to Perkuno's Hammer. At least it doesn't live up to what I remember Perkuno's Hammer being. Don't let that discourage you from Baltic Thunder as it's a worthy purchase."
"Body is creamy and rich with a velvety smooth mouthfeel. Quite drinkable despite the richness."
"Color this one disappointing. Either way I'm glad I got to try this one."
"Baltic Thunder is solid and sturdy. The expectations were very high, and it may not have met those very high standards. Judge it on its own merits. I liked what I found."
"D - This is actually quite drinkable for a Baltic Porter with a big ABV. It's very smooth and goes down easily."
"This long awaited brew pours a black/brown with a medium tan head and slick lacing. It brings a thick raisin prune aroma and herbal hops, pretty nice. The flavor comes on with grassy licorice and coffee with a sharp cheddar bite at the back and a dry nip on the tongue. It's drinkable enough for the style. Pretty good but I would have to say it doesn't quite live up to expectations. I do enjoy the sweet and bitter blend which gradually suggests some chocolate highlights. Worthy of recommendation for sure. Thanks Rubby!"
"Picked up a 22 oz bottle at Bauer for $5.99. Poured into pint glasses. Dark as molasses color, with a decent sized head and good lacing on the glass. The smell was of roasted coffee. While the beer was cold, the major flavor was coffee. But as it warmed up, a real milk chocolate aspect emerged. Pretty good flavor the whole way down. The body was a bit thin in my opinion for what a baltic porter should be. I would drink this again, but for the same price, there are better baltic porters on the market."
"The flavor is worthwhile, but it's uneven in spots and a little less than a strong overall experience. Really, I was expecting more. Still, even a warm ABV weighs little against a willingly drinkable flavor profile. So I knew Perkuno's Hammer, and this is no Perkuno's Hammer, but hey, without the gaudy expectations it's by no means a disappointment."
"D = This has decent drinkability, but I think it would be vastly improved if the alcohol was lowered a little."
"This medium bodied brew is chewy enough and has some nice carbonation. Nothing mind blowing but all around pretty good. I enjoyed this but just nothing over the top good as far as my palate goes."
"I disagree. Enjoy by sometime on or near Dec. 31st, 2011"
"Pours a nice dark brown/black color, nice carbonation, little fizzy off-white head, minimal sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, nice little touch of toffee/chocolate/caramel. The taste is sweet on the lips, malty, slight bitterness, with the nice tones of toffee/chocolate/caramel. Medium body. The alcohol is hidden very well with this one. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew, recommended."
"Quite easy to drink, if it has one flaw the taste could be a bit more complex. Still this is a good beer."
"Overall a very good BP and another great brew from Victory."
"Pretty damn tastey porter. I've never had the Hammer, but this is a damn good porter. Glad for the opportunity to taste it. Would love to have a session with this baby."
"Thick and oily. Chewy. A little burn on the way down. Really strong but full of flavor and balance. A very very nice brew."
"D: Poor, would not buy this one again. Save your hard earned cash for some of victory's better efforts."
"Poured this beer into my Val Dieu goblet (3 pours altogether). When I poured this beer, all I could think was that it looked just like Pepsi when it came out. Its cola brown with a lot of carbonation, and leaves no head or lacing. There are big bubbles that burst when they hit the surface but don't agitate a head. The aroma is very smoky off the bat. Meaty, like bacon comes through overwhelmingly. There are also notes of toffee and a bit of coffee. The taste again is really smoky. The coffee comes through much more in the taste then in the aroma. A salty, chocolate flavor is also in there. Mouthfeel is fuller then most porters but the carbonation kind of throws it off. I am glad that I was able to trade for this beer, but if it were released again I would pass."
"Taste was a sweet grape koolaid i find prevalent in all baltic porters i try, a flavor i cant seem to get past. this one is very savory and would pair well with a grilled steak of you like baltic porters. i cannot get past the odd flavors of grape i tend to pick up from this style though."
"Pretty solid beer that's definitely worth a try. Quite tasty with lots of malt flavor."
"Mouthfee is medium bodied with a relatively low carbonation, and a good drinkability."
"D: Definitely do not notice the alcohol. The balance of flavors is just right for me to drink a few of these."
"D: It's not overly enticing, but it's not harsh either."
"Taste: This reminds me a lot of a local beer, Craftsman Smoked Black Lager. On one hand, I wish this was smokier and more chocolaty, yet Baltic Thunder, as is, is a dangerously quaffable dark beer- much more drinkable than anything coming in at 8.5% has any right to be."
"A nice Baltic Porter, as expected from Victory. No problems drinking the entire bottle, and will certainly get this one again. Not quite the same as the Hammer, but at this point my memory of the Hammer may not be entirely accurate."
"Pours a clear dark brown to black color with a light tan head. Smell is cardboard like stale dark malts and not much else. Flavor is roasty with an ashy flavor component as well. Higher than average hopping as well, but the flavor of this didn't do anything for me unfortunately. Wouldn't recommend."
"D: A very drinkable beer. I would recommend this to someone who likes Baltic porters. I am becoming more and more of a fan of Victory Brewing."
"Rather filling, but that was expected from this 8+% ABV porter. My first of this style, and I found it quite enjoyable."
"Roasted coffeeish bitterness up front. Sweetbread and milk chocolate sweetness follow. Some dark fruits come through with a little warming alcohol. Tobacco, leather, and vanilla accent a mildly dark chocolate bitter finish. Medium-bodied with a slightly over-carbonated feel. It's been a long time since I've had a Perkuno's Hammer, one of my favorite beers of all time, and although this is good, it's no Hammer!"
"Just as good as I remember it back in January. I'll be buying this again for sure, especially since it supports one of my favorite local breweries."
"A bit coarse and not as rounded/creamy as other better versions of the style, so I wouldn't drink it often. Decent stab at the style, but it never goes in for the kill. Not as bad as my lousy wordplay, but far from the most enticing Baltic porter."
"Baltic Thunder pours a clear red black with a foamy brownish head that fades quickly. The aroma is chocolatey dark malt with a hint of caramel and some dry, metallic hops. The flavor starts with dark toasted malt flavor with a nice balance of astringency and bitterness from the hops. Sweetness and dark caramel come through in the finish with just a touch of fruitiness. The beer is smooth and the alcohol is almost completely hidden."
"I am kind of a novice when it comes to Baltic porters, its a style that I've rarely had the chance to drink. This is a very good beer and a great opportunity to try out the style."
"(original date of review: 1/13/08)"
"I guess I thought this was the collaboration to make Perkuno's Hammer, so I went for it. Overall it was very good but not quite the same as my memory of the hammer."
"This isn't a bad beer at all, it's just a little bland for the syle. From my experience with the style, I feel a Baltic Porter should be a thick and chewy lager version (although Porters are generally ales, most BPs use lager yeast) of an RIS. That being said, it's still enjoyable, and it's sure to please someone's palate. Recommended (barely)."
"D: It was decent, but lacking the complexity of the more interesting baltic porters"
"Nice thick mouthfeel but lacking that creaminess that the Hammer had, decent fruity flavors from the malt/yeast, but dark malt flavors were a bit one dimensional (carafa?). A bit unbalanced for my tastes since it was laden with sweet malt without having good balance from hops or alcohol which made it cloying after a half a pint. Couldn't finish the bomber, but saved the rest to make french onion soup."
"At first I got a big, juicy sweet cherry flavor, followed by chocolate (chocolate covered cherries maybe). Then there was a little bit of toffee grains and a bit of alcohol. I also pulled some vegetal DMS aroma out of here and didn't get much of an aftertaste. Overall, I was disappointed, but this found it to be an agreeable beer."
"Overall, this is an enjoyable beer. Not the most complex of the style, but certainly one worth picking up again"
"Mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated, somewhat smooth in the finish, which leads to it being quite drinkable. Nothing impressive on the appearance, taste and mouthfeel side but it is pleasant in mouthfeel and is quite drinkable."
"This is a great example of why hyping up a beer can be a bad thing. The amount of beergeeks excited to try this was insane due to the brewing press release, big news to see Tom Baker teaming up with Victory. Then the wait with all the legal bullshit, and what follows is a blend of trying to get this one right before the big release. Well, they didn't get much right in my eyes and I'm going to try it again. Had it thrice on tap and I will be investing in a bomber, but I'm weary. No many gripes with appeaance except for head retention, poured pitch black in body much like I recall the Hammer forming a thin tan head leaving thin scant speckled lacing. I remember the Perkuno's to have texture all day with lacing throughout each pint. I think the change of the beans altered the protein count therefore affecting head. Aromatics I'm getting sweet dried fruits with some tart acidic mild offensive tones going on, chocolate roasts play nice with figs and plum fruitiness. Some mild booziness with lingering herbal hop notes comes late. Flavors insert ripe or dried concentrated fruit flavor whether it comes off plum, fig, or raisin I'd definitely call it some what vinous. Dark dry roasted malt lacking the complex mix of flavors the Hammer always provided but my point is that fruit and dark chocolate with a mildy cloying dark chocolate syrup comes off one dimensional in the flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied assertive carbonation a bit unnatural with words like thin and blah entering my brain. Drinkability, no doubt any brew from Victory is going to be a solid player, good dark beer but never try to relive a classic craft brew like Perkuno's Imperial Hammer if you're not going to truly bring it to the table. Definitely not our beloved Hammer but Baltic Thunder I'm sure will be getting better with some age, right now it really lacks complexity."
"The alcohol is very hard to notice from the taste, but begins to warm towards the last third of the bomber. I'm not very familiar with the style, and I'm a bit confused by the label, which refers to it as a dark lager. I thought all porters were ales? Anyways, I may not seek it out again, but if a couple more were in front of me I could definitely make a session of it."
"Overall - This beer stands somewhere in between a porter/stout and a scotch ale/wee heavy. This could be an excellent example of a Baltic Porter because I've never had any others. For me, it rates a little better than average, although it never quite satisfied my tastes."
"Medium body. Alcohol is well hidden for the strength. This beer just seems to be missing something in the middle that could make it special."
"Medium body, not really creamy, carbonation somewhat forceful. The flavor is all about roasty toastiness, with a bitter coffee aftertaste that lingers nicely. Not sweet at all, which improves drinkability. Not as complex as one might hope but solid and well made."
"Too be honest I'm dissapointed. I was expecting much more from this. But what can you do."
"Enjoy!"
"T: somewhat estery for a mere 8.5% there is the obligatory slight coffee and dark fruits...its good but not exciting. i must admit i feel ho hum about this beer overall. I will say this, its very good, but based on previous reviews i guess i expected more? I would absolutely have it again and would recommend it, maybe its just me"
"D: A very clean brewed and flavored beer with a very good drinkability and a very good example per style. Highly recommended."
"Final Note: Thanks George!"
"Interesting that this is a Lager (and truly tastes like one), and I always thought that Baltic Porters were a member of the Ale family. Nonetheless, a pleasant brew that accomplishes what I think Victory set out to do."
"Pours a dark brown with a small head, yet with a good lacing quality. Smell is a rich malt with a light hop note. Taste mirrors smell with a robust malt presence and a light grape-like quality and light hop finish. Mouthfeel is creamy, a bit chewy. Drinkability is exceptional for such a high abv///very smooth."
"It's not a bad brew, but it's nothing special either - and I was really looking forward to this one. I'm shocked Victory didn't do better."
"Overall I think this one was a little too sweet; I was also thrown off a bit by the grape-like flavor. Not bad, but something I probably wouldn't seek out again."
"Notes: I've got to think something was lost in translation here. The old feel of the Hammer, as well as the flavors, seem to be gone here. Oh well, R.I.P. Heavyweight."
"Has a dark chocolate appearance with a hint of chestnut. Almost a cola-like look. Poured a rich head that went away quickly. Smell has hints of malt that are not strong and very pleasing. Great smooth taste for being 8.5%, very drinkable. Wow! Very flavorful. Has a subtle toffee flavor with hints of fruit and spice. This beer is awesome! Very litle bite with a load of alcohol content. Great for an after dinner drink. I'll definitely be picking up more bottles if I can."
"Drinkability was good. Overall a nice solid example of a baltic porter. I imagine this could be amazing on tap, but perhaps just a little bit overrated from my experience with the bottled version."
"deep, dark, mahogany black with a nice, light tan head that holds very well and leaves nice lace. nose is roasty malt, a lager yeasty smell, some sweetness (dark fruit/toffeeish), and a faint but pretty, hop scent. well balanced, and good representation of the style. a little thinner than i would have hoped for, but smooth and very enjoyable. i detect almost no booze in the taste or finish except a little warming sensation as it goes down. dangerously drinkable. i like this new baltic porter trend. gogo victory."
"Had this on tap at the Brick Store Pub a while back. I like this a little better on tap than in the bottle, but not by much. Pours black with a moderate head that fades to a thin ring. Smells vinous primarily, but there are also notes of prunes and some roasty notes. Tastes about the same- winey and roasty in about equal parts. Light chocolate and prune, a trifle sweet. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but smooth and still fine for the style. Nicely drinkable, but a bit on the lighter side for the style. I never had the old Perkuno's Hammer, so I can't compare the two. Quite nice on draft."
"I have one bottle of Perkuno's Hammer in the cellar. If it is better (like most seem to think it is) it must be wonderful. Ill post my comparison in that review. Great beer, well worth the trade. Thanks again to Heath."
"The beer poured a slightly opaque black with a dark brown head into a 12-oz pilsner glass. A slightly sweet caramel aroma, with undertones of roasted malt. The initial flavor impression was of alcohol, but transitioned into a very nice full-bodied roasted malt finish. The flavor profile highlighted the black and dark malts, with a fairly low hop flavor and bitterness presence, as it should be. Low carbonation and minimal lacing. Alcohol nicely masked. An excellent high-gravity porter."
"overall this is a nice beer, but wasn't that above average, but is a tasty offering if available to you."
"It poured a deep dark mahagony brown that had a few dark ruby red highlights along the edges. It had a foamy 2 inch head of tan colored foam that had good retention. When it receded all the way, it only left behind a handful of tan colored foamy rings along the edge and just a few spots of tan lace around the glass. It had a strong cocoa based aroma to it. Behind the cocoa was some sweet caramel, dark roasted malts, a tiny pinch of roasted hops, a dab of sweet alcohol, and the slightest touch of rust toward the end. I thought it had a very interesting taste to it. In the beginning it just had a heavy taste of cocoa powder and rust. Somewhere in the middle the taste had completely changed. The cocoa powder had turned itself into dark chocolate and the rust had left the taste all together. After the cocoa powder had transformed into dark chocolate, more flavors emerged from the background. What came out was dark roasted malts, dark fruits, roasted coffee beans, crispy roasted hops, and the slightest touch of alcohol. It you couldn't tell already, it was a full bodied beer that had a delicious full flavored thick aftertaste of dark chocolate, roasted hops, and a pich of alcohol. It was a great beer to have on-tap, but I'm sure it's the same story if you get it from a bottle."
"Overall, I thought this was an excellent beer, though I will say there is just no way has it held a candle to the original. I really admire victory for putting this out, and attempting to resurrect one of the greats, however they just needed a little bit more and it would have been outstanding. Still a very good beer and one that I would definitely recommend trying."
"D - pretty solid. As I said, I really love Baltic Porters and I'm a big fan of Victory. This goes down quite well and I look forward to finishing the bottle. Definitely hides the 8.5% pretty well. Would drink again."
"Had on tap at the Flying Pig in Malvern, PA. Poured into a pint glass, it was a reddish black pour with no head by the time it reached my table. The smell was of burnt malt, sweet molasses, with some metallic twange to it. The taste was a roasted malt flavor that was rather dry. Not overly sweet at all, like a lot of porters it was dominated more by the dark roasted malt flavors. A good beer that I was excited to try on tap."
"Overall, this is a dangerous brew. Fairly high ABV coupled with incredible ease of drinking means a few of these might end up going down without being moderated. I think Victory really did a nice job balancing everything in this one."
"Drinks fairly easy, a fairly good Baltic porter. The 8.5% ABV is well concealed"
"For the ABV level it's rather light and easy drinking."
"Medium bodied brew. Decent carbonation level. Easy to drink. Nicely lingering flavor that is just a subtle hint of roastiness. A pretty good beer, I like this one more than most other Baltics."
"I poured this big beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was really black with a dark head that did not last very long at all. The smell was of coffee and roasted nuts smelling also and sour slightly. The taste was kinda flat and had a harsh alcohol burn aftertaste. I will not buy again."
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts: Another winner from Victory! Overall a very well balanced, smooth, surprisingly easy-to-drink beer. Not nearly as monstrous as it's made out to be. I could easily enjoy 2-3 bottles over the course of a winter's evening with a couple good cigars."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. But don't take my word for it - drink and enjoy!"
"I grabbed a case of these from Victory on release day and I've been drinking them on and off for the past few weeks. Poured a clear, deep brown with a thick cap of brown/beige bubbles. Good head retention, thick lacing to start, becoming more spotty towards the end. Nutty aroma, some caramel and cocoa, light roast with a hint of grassy hops. Same in the flavour, but with more sweetness, milk chocolate, more grassy hops (surprisingly), and a bit more roast. Nicely balanced, with bitterness and faint tartness lingering, along with a delicate spicy warmth. The body was just above medium, carbonation was moderate, decent texture. Alcohol is well hidden. Highly drinkable, especially given the abv. It's definitely nice having (part of) a case kicking around the house."
"Pours a dark brown/black with a ruby outline. Creamy one finger light khaki colored head that slowly descends to a thin frothy layer. Some thin layers of stickiness left behind, not a whole lot though. Smell consists of butter, milke chocolate, and dark fruits. Some woody scents with a touch of vanilla extract as well. Very smooth aroma, and very enjoyable. Sweet coffee flavors up front with hints of vanilla and maple syrup. Caramel malt and a slight citrus hop bite find their way on the tongue as well. Brown sugar and molasses in the aftertaste. Smooth light to medium body with a tingling carbonation. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this beer is pretty damn good. Very solid brew from Victory, I'm curious as to what some age would do to this one."
"I have had the chance to try the heavyweight version that inspired this beer. the young version was to raw, the aged version (6 years) was spectacular. This new brew seems to cut down the middle and produce a nice baltic porter."
"Overall: Very easy drinking for the style, although this beer left me wanting more. For a BP it just wasn't bold enough in my opinion, still an enjoyable beer."
"Bomber poured into a gobblet. Ruby brown in color, 1/2 a finger of head quickly fading to a thin presence around the glasses edge. Fruit and malt in the nose. Sweet, roasted coffee and a pleasant bitterness in the finish. Smooth carbonation. Overall, lighter than expected."
"Overall, I was pleased with the Baltic Thunder, but I wasn't blown away. The bittering hops in the finish disappointed me. I am cellaring another bottle, so hopefully the rough edges will fade away."
"Goes down easy enough, not as heavy as I expected. No alcohol warmth or flavor."
"Pours a very dark brown, not quite black but very close, in color with mahogany hints at the edges and about a finger of tan head that really didn't last all that long. Nice aroma although it isn't very strong. Seems fairly average. Malty sweetness, raisins, and a slight toasted character. The taste is another story however, assertive with some complexity but not overwhelming. This is a solidly malty beer. The first thing I am hit with in the taste is malty sweetness. After the sweetness some caramel and toffee notes meld nicely with raisins. Very little yeast character here, very clean thanks to the lager yeast. There is a bit of bitterness in the finish, not too much, just enough to balance this beer out. In the late finish I pick up a few fig/plum/raisin notes, quite nice. Also in the finish I detect some alcohol. The alcohol is just noticeable enough here to detract slightly from my enjoyment of this beer and makes this more of a sipper. Mouthfeel is good, medium-full body with moderate carbonation. Very smooth but comes across a bit thin. Drinkability is ok, I really enjoyed the sweet malts and esters in this beer but the alcohol had a tendency to be a bit ""obvious"" if I took a larger sip."
"Mouthfeel is light for this style, just an easy drinking and most enjoyable brew."
"There seems to be quite an influx of Baltic Porter style beers showing up on the beer shelves lately...not that Iam complaining.This poured into a .5 liter stein a deep dark brown with creamy-like beige head atop that settled slowly leaving a minimal amount of lace behind,heavy on the espresso roast coffee in the nose with lighter notes of caramel and molasses.Nice full mouthfeel very lush,flavors are dominated by the dark roast coffee with the sweetness held in check well just a little caramel that goes well with the heavy handed roastiness,a mild dark fruit note comes thru but its rather mild.A solid Baltic Porter quite roasty and sustaining with a great mouthfeel."
" I love this style, this one is highly enjoable, maybe a bit low in the complexity department but I'm thinking this one will age really well."
"Well balanced smells of chocolate, coffee, a little booze, molasses and plum. What you smell is what you get. The taste is a little richer than I expected. A bit of complexity as all the flavors come together. Smooth drink but I felt the mouthfeel was a bit thin. Good drinkability."
"D: It took a while for me to finish the bottle and I didn't particularly enjoy it. It's a nice beer, subtler than I expected, but overall I'm just not impressed."
"*Taster's Note: Special thanks to markgugs for the bottle."
"Very likable. Poured into a pint glass with virtually no head to speak of. Thewre was definately a lot going on in the smell. Dark brownish black color that seems lit somehow. A little thin in terms of mouthfeel, but I certainly liked it. The toffee shows up very hard in the aftertaste."
"One of the best porters I have ever had."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 2 1/2"" light brown head over the clear burgundy brown brew. Dense head gradually transitions from foam to liquid, with sticky lacing. Aroma is moderately of dark grains and fruitiness. Taste is dark maltiness upfront, intensifying in the middle coupled with some light fruitiness, and goes bitter for the close. Mouthfeel is alright, but seems a bit thin, and drinkability is pretty good. Not as hearty as I'd expect for the style, but not a bad brew by any stretch."
"It's nice overall, but not quite as full as I was hoping. The touch of carbonation and astringency slow it down more than the alcohol, which is pretty well covered for the abv level."
"D: Very good! I think that it is definitely worthy of it's status."
"Don't drink and review."
"And the drinkability is insanely good. As I said, the best of two great brewing traditions in one. Soooo good."
"22 ounce bomber, ""enjoy by Jan. 2 '09"" (almost 2 years away) dating on the label. Pours very dark, near black, under a dark tan head, showing retentive powers and leaving thick ringed sheeting and respectable lacing. Nose of sweet malt, powdered sugar and a hint of cocoa. Smooth and tasty on the tongue, with notes of dark grains, mild coffee, chocolate and hints of vanilla. Very easy drinking and enjoyable porter, the label calls it a lager (?) hmmm. Well worth getting a few bottles and enjoying."
"I suggest anyone that finds this should try it. Its not too far off in left field so that anyone would enjoy it. Baltic porters are among my favorite styles and this is a perfect example of that style"
"Overall, a very enjoyable, surprisingly drinkable porter. Looking forward to having it again."
"Pours a dark brown with a hint of ruby. There was hardly any head on this one. Smelled very sweet. There was a hint of roasted malts as well as licorice and molasses. Taste started out very sweet. Caramel coming through and very well balanced with roasted flavors and hops. The flavors play off of one another which makes this brew very pleasing to the palette. The wait was worth it. I could drink more than one of these at one sitting. Even though its 8.5% there is harldy no alcohol present in the smell or taste. I will definitely be getting some more of this."
"Drinkability: High, full flavored and very smooth, no lingering bad aftertaste. Was surprised to see beer was 8.5%."
"Baltic Thunder is sort of like a baltic porter with a shot of brown ale... it's thin and accessible but doesn't quite reach greatness. Glad to see Victory resurrecting this classic brew in any case."
"D- i would def recommend a six pack of this beer. It has full flavor yet it goes down pretty smooth. No bad aftertaste and it is a victory brew."
"D - Quite drinkable and unusually complex. This is easily the most interesting of the handful of baltic porters I have tried. I think this could benefit from a few months of aging that might mellow out some minor fusel alcohols in the flavor."
"On tap at Monk's, pours a dark, inky brown with thick, tan head aft first, but shrinks into a very faint covering. No lacing here, the head all slides ride down into the beer. Smelled like chocolate and coffee-- like mocha or something. Tasted like chocolate and caramel malts, really malty and sweet. Smooth, not very carbonated mouthfeel. A rich drink, somewhat drinkable though."
"I would most certainly have another. It's a great beer to take your time with, to blow an afternoon with. If I had to describe BT with one word, I'd choose ""smooth."" It's not a startling, in-your-backyard thunder but rather a distant low-rumbling after the storm thunder. This is the smooth jazz of beers."
"Taste is, again, very subdued. I was expecting a lot, but i was disappointed. Pretty similar to the smell. At least it wasn't an alcohol bomb. Very smooth. Pretty drinkable, but boring. I wouldn't refuse another, but i am going to stop looking for this one, especially since now i have the bottle."
"Cheers."
"D: Not a favorite and a bit too chocolatey and chewy for my liking."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a robust black and roasted malt scent that's dry, but with some sweetness. The taste is great. It has a silky smooth flavor that goes down easy and finishes a bit on the sweet side. It hides the 8.5%abv well and provides a complex array of malts. It's complex and quite rich. There are hints of roasted malt as well as chocolate and crystal malts. Damn, this is one smooth drinker. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. I've been waiting for the release of this beer for some time now. It definately lives up to the hype."
"1 Pint, 6 fl oz bottle copped from Oak Tree in South Plainfield... pours a jet-black, ebony hue with minimal reddish-tan head that soon dissipated and lacked staying power... smell is replete with toffee, caramel, and dark lattee nuances... taste complements the aroma with a dark espresso, cocoa, butter, caramel, slight vanilla, and chocolate flavor... nice, smooth, rich mouthfeel that really satisfies... another top-brew from Victory... a good beer for the Winter with a nice, warming 8.5% ABV... good drinkability and the alcohol is hardly detected behind rich dark, roasted malts, and cocoa flavors... I really liked this one... Recommended..."
"I love Victory. They make two of my favorite beers. This was a disappointment, I have to wonder if I just got a bad bottle."
"Drinkability: a nice version that is easy to quaff despite the alcohol levels. Defintely worth picking some of this up."
"Like nothing I've tried before. The Thunder makes me dream of trips to Downingtown."
"Overall, this isn't a bad beer by any means, and is actually quite good at times. The problem is largely that it doesn't hold a candle to the original Perkuno's Hammer, justified criticism or not. Yes, they are two different recipes as noted, which makes them two different beers, but the influence of one on the other is so great that one can not help but compare the two. The original came at you with a near jet-black, engine oil color and balanced the dark fruit notes with more of a coffee base and even threw in a fair amount of smoke flavor. There's just none of that here anymore. I'd liked to have seen them tweak this one a bit more here and there for a more dynamic brew overall, especially in regard to the appearance and mouth feel. It's certainly worth a try and shows promise here and there, but Baltic Thunder is perhaps a bit over-hyped in the end."
"A little too hyped and not as good as Perkuno's Hammer, but still a very good beer."
"Thanks to Deuane for the nice extra."
"D- easy drinking with no aftertaste. I could enjoy a few of these in a sitting."
"extra in a trade with BeerBeing, bottle states a best by date of Jan 02, 2009"
"Solid black in color, and opaque, the body had a smallish head, and unlike several other Baltic Porters I've sampled, the head was not brown in color. The smell was roasty and somewhat hoppy. Some chocolate aroma was present, but it was mostly light. The taste was sweet and sour in a classic Porter manner. Chocolate was more prominent in the taste as were notes of lightly roasted coffee. The astringency was mild, but the carbonation was a little prickly. Well done representation of the style IMHO."

"D- Too much alcohol taste to have many, but a good example of the style all the same."
"Have to say great label to start. Very dark in color-a deep, deep mahogany when held to the light. Huge tan head that quickly receedes though leaves a nice 1/8"" layer. Quite complex aroma-chocolatey and somewhat sulfury. A dried fruit and vanilla tinge. Strong malty flavor. Powdered cocoa sort of flavor. Bittersweet, caramel taste. Very muted alcohol-its there but its not. Becomes part of the overall scheme. Quite dry in the finish. Decent body. The dryness lends a sort of ""rough"" patch to it. Very drinkable and enjoyable. A lot of hype surrounds this one. While it is no Perkunos Hammer it is still a great example of a little known or brewed style."
"Drinkability: It's been a while since I've had Perkuno's Hammer. However, I'm not judging anything based on that in the first place; I just wanted to make it clear. But the fact that I still have a 4-pack of Perkuno's in the cellar makes me happy to eventually compare the two. But for around $5 a bomber, it's beyond extremely worth it for such a flavorful brew. Sure, there are better examples of the style out there, but I can certainly that say that I'd make this a winter staple if they ever decide to do 6-packs. Not to mention, honestly, how does this go down so easily? It seems almost impossible that the ABV is almost at 9%. Bravo, Victory, for putting your own spin on the resurrected recipe."
"Pours pitch black with a tan head. Thick malty nose with tones of coffee. Just loads of malts in there. Flavor is thick. Very full body. Easily noticed malt presence that keeps a firm control over things. Minor coffee tones. Thicker earthy edge. Mild tar going on. Very smooth on the liquid. Very easy to drink. It's definitely good, but I have had a chance to sample a lot of the eastern European baltic porters and there are several others that shine a bit brighter than this one. Still a damn tasty beer though."
"D- The upside to the carbonation is that it makes this 8.5% alcohol beer extremely drinkable. My first pint went right down. The second began to catch up with me but it is was still very drinkable. If you can get our hands on this beer grab a pint or growler or keg!!"
"Overall: Fairly one-dimensional -- pleasant, but without the malt complexity that normally characterizes style. Roast is a little overwhelming -- needs a lighter touch."
"D: Good brew, this one's been pretty hyped in our local area, and while I'm not blown away, I'm certainly not disappointed."
"Taste is very smooth and creamy, chocolate caramel and malt presence hits first, bit of an alcohol taste in the back but is mostly masked by the creaminess, some nuttiness as well as a slight bitterness."
"I've never had Heavyweight's Perkuno's Hammer but if this homage to it is any indication, I think I've missed out on a pretty good beer."
"I'm going to try a different kind of review for this beer and just do it stream of conscious: Forgetting the history, nice label. Resolution could be better. Bill should have seen that. 7:04 pm. This one will put me to sleep. Imperial pint glass. Thinnish brown caramel as seen through the stream of beer at the pour. Yeah, somewhat light in color in the glass as well. Nice creamy tan head. Excellent retention. Smells like an average dark-roasty stout. Kind of smokey in the flavor. Lots of fruit upfront. Brown sugar across the middle. Alcohol. Background notes of thin black coffee. Somewhat similar to Perkuno's but not nearly as rich. Smooth, but also a touch raspy with alcohol. Bitterness is as I remember Tom's. Balanced. I'd like more malt though. Surprising medium body. Perhaps a bit too much zest on the tongue as well - but the carb's OK, I guess it's just lacking body. Dark fruits... is it that burnt currant I'm looking for? Yes, a little. Also bitter, sticky prune skin. Again, smokey or deeply ashen-roast in the finish. It seems something's lacking across the middle. Head retention is average - it's high alcohol so that's expected. Nice rings of thin lace at the outset. Decent spots and splashes. A ring of orange and ruby can be seen peeking through the foam at the surface along the glass. Hmmm, a kind of a burnt chestnut in the aftertaste... like that acrid note that you smell on the streets of Manhattan in late November and December. I'm not feeling like I want to finish this first glass. There's not enough malt to balance the alcohol. The fruit note is nice though. Lacks body, malt balance, complexity."
"A pint arrived in front of me, not so dark as to be completely black, but not at all transparent. Pillowy tan head nearly an inch thick, with minimal etched lacing as the glass emptied. Carbonation leaves a slight tingle on the palate but finishes smooth. Much sweeter than I remember the Hammer being, and a touch more estery up front...sour, raspberry-like fruitiness. Cocoa is very evident, and the malt profile somewhat overshadows the mild, lingering bitterness in the finish. Alcohol hides itself well, moreso than I remember from its predecesor. All in all a very tasty beer - another excellent brew from Victory, and worth seeking out - but also in my opinion not a dead-on clone of the Hammer."
"Pours a mahogany-brown color that is translucent at the edges. A large bubbled beige head forms and then fades to a thin ring. The aroma is of chocolate and molasses and is somewhat reserved. The taste is chocolate and roasted malt with some lingering sweetness and molasses. The mouthfeel is light and pleasant, though a bit thinner than I had expected. The 8.5% ABV of Baltic Thunder is very well-masked. I didnt detect any alcohol burn."
"Again, thanks to my friends at Victory for ressurecting this recipe for year-round sale. It was truly a pleasure!"
"Go Scandinavian power!"
"IMHO, just a close relative of Perkuno that isn't as attractive and doesn't have the charm, or personality. I've heard that this particular bottling was a bit of a mix-match of a few different batches that the brew house ran. Perhaps future bottles will be more to my liking...not that this is that bad but when lined up side by side with the other aforementioned Baltic Porters, this one fell short of the mark."
"Needs to be cellered for a bit to become very drinkable."
"Very interesting brew, I am not sure how it compares to the original due to my being on the other side of the country, but this is very flavorful and smooth. Highly recommended."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"D - I remember loving Perkuno's hammer, but bummed that the only place nearby that carried it was 45 min away back then. I enjoyed the revival immensely. Kudos to Victory for bringing this gem back and to Heavyweight for allowing them to keep it alive. A great beer, nowhere near the flavor of an 8.5% beer, very nuanced and well blended. It gives credit to Victory for allowing nature to take its course lagering the big beauty. I was jazzed to try the reborn Perkuno's and found it to live up the memory."
"Overall- Good, not great. Definitely recommended though!"
"D: Since this is my second 22oz. I guees this will be a go to beer for me (especially at $5 a bottle.)"
"Way too drinkable at 8.5%. I'm glad I bought a case to take home."
"Overall though, not that impressed. I don't know if it was me or the beer. With all of the press and hype this beer was getting, it really didn't live up to it. It was good, but it definitely didn't wow me. I'm gonna grab a bomber when I see them on the shelves, see how the flavors and scents change with some time in the bottle."
