"O - While I'm not sure it exactly delivers as a pumpernickel beer, it is still a solid porter-leaning-towards-stout, the fennel and spice elements add a unique touch."
"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours pitch black with a healthy, fine, two finger brown head with great retention and lots of lacing. Good aroma of dark toasted malt, chocolate and a touch of spicy rye. Flavor is smooth milk and dark chocolate, toasted malt with a hint of char, mild toffee. Finishes with very mellow blended dark malt, chocolate, char and light hop bitterness. Nice medium creamy body. Wow, a beautifully balanced and well integrated porter. The malts are some variety of chocolate malt that is great. Deceptively smooth and mellow mannered, but with interesting additional light flavors of char and light rye spiciness. Really nice. Stumbled on this on a trip and hope to find another bottle."

"Overall - A porter that sits right on the borderline between stout and porter territory. Very nice roasted malt flavour with the rye and fennel seeds to accompany. Perfect companion for the changing seasons in Alberta."
"An agreeable porter, big and brash, chocolate up the yin and the yang. What I'm not really seeing, hearing (?), smelling, and tasting, is the pumpernickel, beyond a timid rye participant in the overall malt interplay. Ah well, still good for what it is, though, and not for what I thought it might be, I suppose."
"It's been a while my friend and man you look impressive not in a gay way just pure admiration dark kola hue with a khaki laced three finger creamy head and clingy lacing everywhere very good looking,dark chocolate,rye and hops are the main aromas and the mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation the tastes are dark chocolate,bready bready malts,rye,spice and finished with a herbal hoppiness and overall it's a very unique drop that I'd buy again cheers."
"D - very tasty. Baltic porter with rye and spice replacing dark fruits."

"Mouthfeel is round then dry."
"Overall: Would have gone great with some blue cheese! Pleasantly surprised as I was not expecting much. The addition of the rye is what really made the beer for me. Loved the label artwork. Recommended."
""
"overall im thoroughly impressed and say this one borders on world class. its a desert, a real treat. the bottle artwork is what drew me to this one and im so happy i bought it. amazing beer."
""
"As it warms up the spices come out more. Giving it a slight liquorice aroma, added to the ones I mentioned earlier. Good stuff!"

"O: Rye is a nice addition to a pretty traditional porter. A little too smoky for my tastes though it isn't overpowering. Just kinda masks the spiciness that I was really looking for. Mouthfeel is good, nice and creamy and slick. Overall quite a good and easy-drinking porter."
"I didn't taste any pumpernickle whatsoever, but this was one of most balanced, tasty porters i've ever had. Nice and chocolately, great mouthfeel, not too thick, not too thin, hints of coffee. Just a really great choice if you are in the mood for a porter."
""
"Overall I got this for 5 bucks and even though its no different than most Baltic porters it drinks world class."

"The beer pours a black color with a tan head. The aroma has a lot of chocolate and roasted malt in it, as expected. The flavor is a bit different. There are still a lot of porter qualities such as the chocolate and roasted malt, but there is also a spiciness and a pumpernickel character which goes very well. The alcohol is definitely noticeable. Medium to thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
"Beer's body has medium levels of carbonation with a medium weight; not watery around the edges at all. Resultant mouthfeel is fairly smooth and creamy, with a semi-dry finish and just a bit of stickiness from sugars. No ethanol detected."

"a personal favorite... if you can come across it, like baltics, and want to spend the scandinavian price tag. all the notes you would expect out of a good baltic porter but the quality of this brew is key in its breadiness. body is glorious. beautiful yeast resilience. this is a density that carries everything alone so nicely. nice mesquite. meatiness, molasses that doesn't dominate like a lot of the porters i've had from the region. nice and dry mineral heavy. again this beer is quite earthy yet balanced and malt complex that no one quality is particularly dominating. balance of bitterness, minerality, smoke, molasses, leather, apple pie, and fluff. the beer is held in a time lock with the use of the minerals causing complete stagnation. but its has life in the 'pumpernickel' richness. yes... baltic porter drinkers, the six of you out there... this is a must."
"500 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Gusher upon opening. Pours pitch black color with a nice 2 finger dense and creamy tan head with amazing retention that reduces to a nice thick cap that lasts that whole glass. Some beautiful dense soapy lacing on the glass. Aromas of dark chocolate, caramel, molasses, toasted malt, dark biscuit, prune, raisin, herbal spiciness, light smoke, and coffee. Nice and well balanced aromas with decent strength and complexity. Taste of big chocolate, molasses, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, toasted biscuit, raisin, prune, coffee, herbal spiciness, and light smoke. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, molasses, dark fruit, coffee, toasted biscuit, and light smoke on the finish for a while. Very robust flavors, with great balance and complexity. Medium carbonation and medium body; with a huge creamy and slick mouthfeel that is wonderful. Alcohol is completely hidden with hardly any warming noticed at all at 7.5%. Overall this is a seriously delicious porter. Great robust and balanced flavors; with an awesome mouthfeel that is super smooth to drink."
"This one is better with food, but still not what I have come to expect from a porter."

"M: deep, roasted taste, full and rounded"
"O - Very enjoyable Baltic porter. Nice and creamy. Would definitely get this again."
"This is hardly a news flash, but Scandinavia is the place of beer renaissance right now...taking styles which the Americans have mutated and amplified from their English and Belgian origins, turning it all around and putting their own twist on it. And Beer Here -- aside from finally offering us U.S. Scandi-beer fans a brewery name we can pronounce -- have added themselves to the list of greats with this one."

"Dr: Relatively high ABV, good drinkability, and a high price."

"This one really made me happy. I was split on my decision to try this one and I'm glad that I decided to."
"O: A wholly enjoyable beer."
"Overall, a very nice Baltic Porter. I'd happily drink this one again, interesting, unique, and tasty."
"CHEERS!!"
"Excellent beer. Let it warm a bit out of the fridge and upon opening it was a low gusher. Poured with a medium sized, thick, Color is an absolutely opaque brown black. Aroma is cocoa, dark ripe fruit, roast, malt, slight anise, and yes, pumpernickel bread. Flavor is similar with only very slight sweetness, some astringency, and very slight tang from mild carbonics. Body is full, lush, with a few high points and soft carbonation. Finish is like flavor, has medium length, and some alcohol warmth. Slow drinking session beer."
"Pours deep dark brown in color.Creamy,medium size bubble,light brown crown.Lasting froth & nice lacing rings left.Yeast & toasted malt aromas.Mildy sour at first taste followed by spices,coffee & choco hints.Dry nut smooth bitternes & earthy sensation.Good carbonation.Toasted coffee aftertaste while dry bitterness remains.Balanced flavors & aromas.ABV is well hidden so drinkability becomes extremely pleasant."
"M - Light to medium body; moderate carbonation."
"This beer poured out as a heavy looking black liquid. The head was brown and thick looking also. The smell of the beer was roasted with a touch of spice on the nose. The taste of the beer was good but I felt like it was missing some of the rye flavors. Perhaps I have a difficult time picking up that specific flavor. I always seem to struggle with rye for some reason. It's a good tasting beer overall though. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, I'm surprised this is still a porter and not a stout. Overall this beer is pretty good. I would drink it again if it was around."
"Enjoy!"
"In short, a roasty-sweet Baltic Porter verging on Imperial Stout."
"O- Great Porter! very nice how they manage to capture the essence of Pumpernickel. I want to drink this again, and will."
"Cracking beer; great use of unusual ingredients to spice up what is already a smooth, drinkable brew."
"Pours pitch black with a nice dark tan head that evaporates quickly. The smell is a pleasant dark porter with dark sugary notes. Mouth feel is dry rather than creamy, and the taste is all dark, heavy, oily, and rich. A little sweetness upfront, with a tame aftertaste coming more from the mouth feel than the flavor. Very nice to drink, and very heavy for a 'porter'."
"Nice and approachable, with the pumpernickel character pretty well nailed. However, the background is a bit unremarkable with not a great deal else going on, and no real surprises as you get through it."
"Fine line between Porter and stout. Nice black body with only a thin film of tan head. Dark roasted malt with chocolate flavor and a mildly bitter aftertaste. Thick smooth almost oily mouthfeel. This is a really tasty thick porter. Loved having on tap at 775 in Reno."
"Overall, just a wonderful beer. Not sure that this reminds me of pumpernickel bread, but it is very drinkable."
"On the whole this beer is not entirely satisfying. There is nothing particularly wrong with it but the flavours fail to excite and the hotness is a bit of a letdown."
"Pours a pitch black with a very thick and creamy 3 inch dark tan head that fades to a small cap. Nice rings of lacing around the glass on the drink down. Smells of dark breads, roasted malts, and some toasted nuts. Taste is of dark crusty bread, dark malts, and spices. There is a sourness to this beer and a bitter aftertaste that I can only attribute to spices that were used to try to get the pumpernickel flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit flat and the beer is thick and creamy. Overall, this was an interesting beer to try. A good attempt to try to get a dark bread flavor but the sourness and spices aren't that great in my opinion."
"As a homebrewer, I truly which to try and remake the flavor of every artisan bread as some point in time or another. Pumpernickel appears to me to be one of those more difficult ones. This is a very dirty deep dark brown color with a sandy foam. The aroma is really really pleasant. There is the sour from the rye some interesting spice notes that I almost attribute to caraway. Along with a good amount of molasses. It's the next best thing to fresh baked. The flavors are a rich dark chocolate flavor mixed with what I taste as caraway seeds or black pepper. Then it's all finished off with a sweet dark bead molasses. It's a touch too harsh on my tongue, but it's still a very well made beer, and rather enjoyable."
"A couple bottle of this made their ways to me in NoVa last year, but I was in the midst of a reviewing hiatus. Good to try it again. It pours a sleek obsidian topped by a finger of dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate, cracked black pepper, clove, brown sugar, and charred pretzel. The taste brings in more of the same, with some more pepper and some bitterer dark chocolate. The body is a solid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a very enjoyable Baltic porter, but I'd have to admit that I feel it to be a bit much to have more than one of these things at a time."
"Conclusion: I love traditional Baltic Porters, and this beer tastes like one with the additional bonus of extra-bold chocolate flavors. I do not get pumpernickel per se, but I do taste layers of complexity and well-balanced excellence. In my opinion; an outstanding brew."
"O: This is a good beer to sip because the flavors keep the taste interesting."
"Moderate low carbonation could really be higher."
"Overall: Rich, roasty, completely full bodied - a sipper to be sure! The spiciness lends it some delicate, but much needed character. I think a slight drop in the original gravity might conjour a little more magic from it, but it's fairly impressive as it is based on girth."
"O- Very decent porter, nothing thats going to blow your mind."
"Taste is a bit more boring that the nose, but has a lot of porter characteristics coming through, a bit thinner, but has a nice velvety consistency, smooth as hell. a bit of spice and rye on the palate as well mixing with the dark roasted, slightly burnt flavors."
"Oh, so yum. As I sip, I ponder the thin line between stout & porter. This is called a porter, but also a stout brewed with spices(?). I guess, technically, it's a thick Baltic-style porter (with ale yeast?) and really, who cares? It's really good. Bready pumpernickle that suggests dark roast coffee and creamy well-crafted dark-as-hell chocolate."
"drinkability is good. pretty well balanced, just a little of the alcoholic heat coming through. nice depth. the extra dimension from the caraway and spice mixes well with the base beer. good stuff."
"Mouthfeel is nice, medium to full bodied, very slick and lightly oily, low to medium carbonation. Goes down pretty easy and mouthfeel is great. Nice stuff. Thanks Russ!"
"The aroma is very large, but the taste is not as powerful. The most impressive portion is the smoothness."
"D: medium plus."
"Poured a massive 4"" head with a malted milk chocolate color. Not much bouquet but a very complex flavor with chocolate and coffee as well as rye bread. Nice zing in the aftertaste. Really a prime example of a deep dark flavorful porter, and with a great name as well. Keep 'em coming Morke."
"I have been intruiged by this beer,I was glad to grab a few bottles over this weekend.Poured into a imperial nonic dark chocolate brown with a toasted almond colored head atop,the dark bread (rye) really makes a big presence in the aromas,bitter chocolate is almost as big and goes well up against the sharp rye.Alot going on palate wise,big dark bread and bitter chocolate,mild fruity esters,and char round out the complex flavors.This is one damn good beer,flavorful as all get out and complex as hell."
"Overall I feel as though the pumpernickel influence is larger in the tap version than in the bottle, almost as though it was dry-breaded. It reduces the nose slightly, but anyway you can find it, it is worth a shot."
"D- Amazing porter, highly drinkable. Booze is not present at all in this one. The smell was a bit of a let down considering other porters reputation, but still one of the best tasting porters I've had."
"Nothing extraordinairy, but I thought this nevertheless a pretty solid beer."
"D: My first from Beer Here and it was quite a treat, hopefully some more from them will show up soon."
"Bottle was a bit of a gusher upon opening. Once that was handled, it pours an incredibly dark brown with thick tan head. Lots of lacing on the glass. Smells of chocolate and roated malt. I don't get pumpernickel, but maybe that's just me. Smooth mouthfeel, as you'd expect from the style. Very nice baltic porter."
"D- this is one killer baltic porter. One of the best I've had in fact. On this cold winters night it hits the spot."
"Reviewed on 12/31/2009. Bottle. Pours black with a pretty thick, dark tan head. Aroma of rich bitter chocolate (with some saltiness like a chocolate-covered pretzel) and roasted malt. Flavor of sweet roasted malt and some salty chocolate in the finish. Some bready, pumpernickel notes in the finish. Very enjoyable porter with complex flavors."
"Pours black with a fine tan head which fades quickly leaving a trace of lace. Smell is a combination of minty spices and hops with a bit of smoke. Taste is faintly smoked peat, roasted malt and earthy grains. Mouthfeel is full, like of like chewing tobacco in an odd but good way with a nice creamy texture. Overall, very interesting and enjoyable."
"Because Mørke Pumpernickel Porter straddles the boundary between an American porter and a Baltic porter, yet is categorized as the latter, I might have been a bit overly critical of it. Regardless, this beer is enjoyable but nothing worth going out of your way for. Furthermore, if the taste or aroma showcased more rye character, I would have perhaps given it higher marks."
"Overall: Judging from the two beers I've had from them. This along with Dark Hops. Beer Here is easily one of my favorite breweries. Mørke is easily one of my top beers from 2010."
"Very solid beer. Pours black with a thin tan head that sticks around. Really does smell of pumpernickel- and licorice. The taste exhibits more of the pumpernickel and still has the licorice, as well as some spice. Nice and dry and spicy with caraway and Swedish licorice. Rich flavors without sweetness in a porter/stout- I like it! Chewy in the mouth, but finishes smooth. An interesting beer, and well worth having."
"Notes: This porter is outstanding in my opinion and would definitely recommend it. I will also have to seek it out again as it was the last bottle at the beer store and it has not been restocked."
"D: Yay for my mouth! Yay for my soul!"
"Jonah's beer, opaque black with a big head. Very smoke. Mouthfeel is creamy. Sourness, it is a baltic. Good with food. Big lace. Like an RIS porter. The chocolate, the bitterness, licorice root, wanted by beers, altogether good. A must try porter. T"
"Certainly not a bad beer. In fact, it's one that I enjoyed a great deal, and would enjoy again. Possibly a beer that didn't quite live up to its potential in my mind, but certainly a worth brew nonetheless."
"D- A bit of a sipper but very well executed. I have trouble finding faults in this beer. Worth seeking out."
"D: The pumpernickel flavor, while interesting, detracts a bit from the drinkability...but it's still a very good porter."
"Overall, for a spiced beer, this is pretty great. Nice flavors all around with the spices not over powering the other flavors. Very happy with this one."
"500 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgård. Batch #425. ABV is 7.5%. Pitch black colour, huge brown head. Moderately roasty aroma, notes of mild coffee, chocolate and fennel seeds, possibly other undefined spices too. Rich and creamy mouthfeel. The flavour has notes of pumpernickel bread (no surprise!), fennel seeds, coffee and dark chocolate, hints of liquorice. An impressive, well made and tasty beer, but (if anything) I would perhaps recommend going a bit easier on the fennel seeds."
"It's been a while since I've had something that blended and changed so much as it warmed up just over 5 minutes. Loved it. Went great with cheddar."
"Pours a nice dark chocolate brown body and a drity brown head that settles quickly. Smells of sweet alcohol and fruits, maybe a little coco and fig. Surprisingly not too much roasted / toasted malt. Tastes a hint of bitterness up front balanced with the alcohol, maybe a hint of coco. Again not too much roasted / toasted malt up front, lighter then what i was expecting. The finish is a hint more bitter than the middle, but in general a decent balance with a firm hop finish. Overal a lighter beer than what the eye may tell you, the lighter character of the pumpernickel versus malt may be why. Mouthfeel is oily and think and drinability is better than average. A solid beer with no complaints"
"D: I really enjoyed the way this beer smelled, but the flavor was just off in some way. It did not seem to match up with my expectations from the nose."
"500 ml bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about a 2 inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is roasted malt, dark chocolate, pumpernickel bread and some caramel. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some coffee and charred/burnt malt in there. The brew has a good lingering bitter roasty/burnt finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and creamy, and it's well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it goes down easy and it's smooth. I think it's a pretty good brew overall, I recommend it. Due to the price it's not something I'd drink all the time, but I would definitely buy this again in the future."
"Notes: Eh. It's not the great for me. A little too dark, a little too bitter for what I feel like drinking right now. I split a bomber and definitely was not looking for anymore"
"Pours a two finger light tan head that fades quickly to a ring leaving traces of lace. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Black color, no highlights. Nose is roasted chocolate. Flavor is slightly bready, but mostly roasted chocolate. Pricey at $8.45 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Rye bread spice and dark chocolate nibs coat the palate with each sip. A bit grainy, with an earthy hop bitterness and fresh Orange peel on the finish. I taste Juniper in here somewhere, too. Again, the sweet-spice combination is unique and very tasty, but eventually wears out my palate. Mouthfeel is thick and chalky at times, but well-carbonated and light on the tongue at others. To say this beer is 'all over the place' wouldn't be too far off, but most of the elements really work well together to make for an enjoyable, original beer experience. Really been impressed with the two offerings I've had from Beer Here, although I shouldn't be too surprised--the ex-Ølfabrikken brewer now makes Beer Here. And both have put out exceptional Baltic Porter's."
"D: Whoa! This was my first Beer Here beer and it was so good I want to go right out and pick up a bottle of Dark Hops."
"Mouthfeel is heavy and coating; almost chewy. This is a rather thick, solid porter. All things considered, however, this was quite drinkable. One the right night, preferably in the Autumn, I could see drinking two bombers of this. It's fairly heavy, but this is a very well crafted Porter by the Danes and absolutely fantastic. Brilliant!"
"Drinkability I thought was pretty good. Probably a nice sipper due to the big roasty malts and spice. Overall a very good offering and one that I would purchase and drink again."
"A tasty Baltic Porter, but one that should be shared."
"Drinkability: Very impressive, though I would not have called it a Baltic Porter; another one of those beers that defies a style but is still very, very good"
"The beer is super creamy and it has all of the characteristics of a fine porter, caramel, roasted grainy malts, chocolate flavors, some mocha. There are lots of charred notes to this beer, some hard to pin down spices, and a slightly biting hop presence. There is a bit of spice in this beer and plenty of smoked woody flavors. There is plenty of ABV present on the tongue, and some sweeter malts underneath. This is a very characteristic and assertive Baltic Porter. I'm not all that crazy about the too-up-front ABV presence and the smoked woody flavors I'm also not a particular fan of. If its a Baltic Porter that you want, than this is one hits the mark on the head. The aftertaste is slight, the mouthfeel is a touch creamy but quite mild overall. This beer is quite chewy and milk shake like thick."
"D: Good I liked both Beer Here beers I tried tonight."
"A really well done balanced stout or porter. Worth trying if you can."
"Very well done, but would remain a 'special occasion' beer for me."
"Overall I was very pleased with the Morke. Great aromas, flavors, and (gasp) drinkability."
"500 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Dark opaque brown with an insanely creamy head that looks like coffee foam. Epic retention and lacing. Aromas of milk and dark chocolates, rye, fresh dark bread, iced coffee. A touch of smoke and roast. Flavor is deep dark chocolate, medium roastiness and bitterness, faint berry note, light spicy acidic rye note, licorice. Mouthfeel is unparalleled. The beer is very rich and heavy but it just glides over the palate with exactly the right amount of carbonation (low and restrained). Really a joy to drink."
"Drinkability: An interesting tasting beer that does not taste like any other Baltic porters I have had. This has several layers of flavor and is very complex. Very good for the style, but probably not good enough to justify me getting it again at the highish price."
"Overall, this is a really bomb ass beer. Bomb ass. Hopefully these guys start sending more of their ""Beer Here," because the two I've had so far have been great."
"d - not overly drinkable, though better than average for the style, dry and bitter finish, but not overly so, somewhat boozy for the abv, taste is interesting"
"D - It's no surprise that Christian (formerly of Ølfabrikken) knows how to make a mean porter. If not for the premium import price this would be a regular in my fridge - it's a tasty porter that offers some unique and well-integrated flavors. Alcohol is well-hidden, texture is excellent, and bitterness is well-attenuated. I also dig the 500ml serving size - big enough to share, but small enough to kill by myself."
"This is one nice porter (although tastes full on stout to me). You feel like your drinking liquid rich flavorful Russian pumpernickel with all the black molasses character that's indicative of such a bread. A real winner if you like big, bold and rich coffee/chocolate brews."
"A slow sipper but nicely drinkable."
"From where I sit, on the strength of this beer and Dark Hops, Beer Here has entered the upper echelon of Scandanavian craft brewing, right alongside Olfabrikken and Nogne. Bottom line: Morke Pumpernickel Porter is the first great beer of 2010."
"Very smooth and drinkable while maintaining richness and body. Well done, I've been impressed with their beers so far."
"Comes out of the bottle (foaming like nobody's business!) a very dark sable, only a whisker above black, with a very thick, fine-bubbled, light beige head. Rich aroma is smoky with an overtone of fresh pumpernickel bread and hints of malt and molasses. Mouth-filling flavor is like liquid pumpernickel with mocha and molasses undertones and just a teeny hint of hops and a whisper of sweetness. Lively, fizzy texture is fairly smooth and leaves a nice tingle."
"The palate opens big and roasty with plenty of sweetness as well.Spicy rye, dark chocolate, molasses and roasted barley-like bitterness are all present and well balanced with the rye and molasses characteristic most prominent. There's some licorice too. Mildly minty towards the finish, I'm guessing that's the rye. Again, I can't discern a significant spice component and that restraint makes for an excellent beer. A touch of juicy pine hops appear on the finish before a dark chocolate and rye finish takes over, coating the palate along with a little licorice. Medium bodied with a deceptively soft carbonation (the large hiss when I opened portended the possibility of an overcarbonated beer, but it wasn't so), the palate is spot on for the style. Thoroughly enjoyable, thanks for the recommendation, guys!"
"Drinkable? Yea. How many? Probably one or two in an evening tops. It tastes a bit stronger than it actually says it is. Overall though, a very solid offering."
"D - strength and spice keep it from being super drinkable"
"Contract brewed by Nogne-O - in small letters says it's a stout brewed with spices. To me, more of a stout than a porter, though in that boderline between the two (and the name fits better with porter, anyway). Definately recommended!"
"Not as distinctive as some examples of the style, this still does most everything right."
"Very creamy, dextrinous, slick mouthfeel makes the caramel, chocolate, and dark bread flavors pop. Spicing is faint but brightens it up further. A touch of roastiness balances moreso than any hops. Dark raisin/plum flavors poke out with warmth. Carbonation is slight, letting the flavors linger on the palate longer. Could use a bit more bite, but makes for a highly drinkable beer. Alcohol warms subtly. Definitely check it out."
"D: Not super high like some porters because of the amount of flavor here, but still very nice"
"Drinkability: Rich, roasty, and enjoyable without anymore alcohol than needed (or wanted, really). Given a couple minutes to warm, it does indeed settle into a fair taste of pumpernickel. Happy to have Beer Here available in the Great State of Georgia and I'm looking forward to trying a bottle or two of that Dark Hops I also saw available at Hop City."
"a little light and over carbonated, but nothing too seriously detrimental. drinkability is pretty good."
"pours a nice black with a tan head that doesn't leave any lace, but does float along the top of the brew for the entirety of the experience. smells very ""baltic."" heavy on malts and grains with a slight alcoholic aroma. some rye present in the nose, but nothing overwhelming. tastes slightly smokey and has a lot of leather. very little rye, hardly noticeable until it actually warms up. It's got a big malt backbone with slight bitterness from the hops. A slight spiciness rounds this out to make a pretty tasty beer. It has that typical ""not that heavy"" porter feel, which for the style is very good. This is a fairly drinkable beer, I just wish that the rye was more prevalent than it is."
"Drinkability: nice flavored beer that is a bit of a slow sipper, but interesting throughout. Worth trying this one."
"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit as I think the pumpernickel really brings some complexity to the flavor and mixes well with the heavy roasted malts from the porter. Very unique."
"Very nice, unique porter with good rye charachter. Wish i had bought more then i had, or atleast didnt share my second bottle!"
"D: This is definitely a different beer. The pumpernickel brings a nice interesting twist to the beer. Very tasty, goes down easily. I'm not sure that I could sit with it for a night, however a pint or two are highly enjoyable."
"D: Very easy to drink, and the uniqueness of it seperates it from many beers in my opinion. Could I have this everyday, probably not, but is it an excellent porter, yes. I believe this would go great with food, just not sre what exactly. Someone ponder that for me."
"D - This beer was great, I hope others have access to this beer, this was great and looking forward to hording many of these beers"
"I'm calling it a Baltic Porter because Ølfabrikken's is there, but I'm not really sure if that's correct. Also, I have no idea about availability. This beer was brewed at Nøgne Ø."
