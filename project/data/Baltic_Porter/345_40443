The rich aroma is loaded with dark fruit notes, particularly raisin and dried plums, and has hints of chocolate, dark bread and coffee.  The flavor does not disappoint.  It is rich and fruity, with hints of dates, raisins, dried plums, toffee and faint coffee.  The high ABV is a bit too obvious here but there aren't really any overly boozy aspects. e.

Pours lightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, caramel, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, brown bread, brown sugar, raisin, plum, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity of dark/toasty malts and light yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, raisin, plum, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, toast, biscuit, caramel, nuttiness, brown bread, light roast, herbal, and toasted earthiness on thin finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malts and moderate fruity yeast ester flavors; with great malt robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Baltic porter. All around nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 11, 2014"

Nothing like Sinebrychoff, Okocim, Zywiec, Baltika #6, Carnegie Stark or Aldaris, but I still enjoy it on it's own merit. Rated here ""to style"".","Mitchster","Jan 24, 2014"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was pretty smooth and on the lighter side, but the flavors just didn't hold my attention and one is enough for me, I wouldn't want any more than that. What I liked the most about this beer was price, if this was $10 I would be very disappointed, but I think it's priced reasonably. What I liked the least about this beer was how much lighter most of the aspects of this beer were compared to most Baltic Porters, it just seemed to be lacking in every aspect. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I would much rather have a Thirsty Trout Porter and it's a way better Baltic Porter and it costs less, I wouldn't recommend it to my friends. All in all this beer left me wanting more and I don't think it did the style justice. IT seems like Victory is pretty hit or miss for me and this was another miss, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Jan 28, 2013"

The aroma is moderate-high sweet, roasty malt with some chocolate and ash, a nice nose. The flavor is roasty, chocolaty with a slightly ashy, dry finish. The hop bitterness is moderate and blends well with the acidity of the malts. There are hints of the alcohol toward the swallow as well with a long lingering, bittersweet, roasted malt flavor. The body is medium with moderate carbonation; the beer drinks fairly easy. Overall a flavorful, complex, yet not tiring beer, well done.","uwmgdman","Jul 14, 2012"

Bigger body helped out a lot as well. This porter uses lager yeast, and from my experience, lager yeast moves an imperial porter closer to the Belgian strong ale zone. This is a style of beer I really enjoy, so I enjoyed this one as well, but it didnâ€™t quench my thirst for an imperial porter brewed with ale yeast, which is the type I enjoy more I think. That said, this is a quality brew in its own right and is worth checking out. Thanks again for the trade kv84.","Jeffo","Sep 08, 2011"

3.88,0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This porter chugged it's way out of the bottle as a dark brown color with some red hues along the edges. The head was pretty thick looking for a little while until is settled down and left just a thin brown coating over top of the beer. The lacing wasn't too bad here, kind of sporatic. The smell of the beer has some old wood aromas, some earthy and smokey aromas as well. There's even a touch of sweetness on the nose too. The taste is pretty good, mostly of brown sugar and some roasted malts. The mouthfeel was on the thicker side and had a light carbonation, just enough to keep it interesting. Overall it's not a terrible Baltic Porter, but not the best I've had either.","Knapp85","Jun 07, 2011"
3.97,2.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Many thanks to Mdaschaf for the chance to taste this. Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a murky dark brown color, but not completely opaque, about 1 finger of white foam that quickly recedes, but stays around the circumference of the glass. Smell- toffee, some grainy notes, with chocolate, maybe an oaklike quality. Taste- definite milk chocolate notes, some roastiness, nutty flavors. Some hops are present at the end and I get a roasted lightly bitter finish. This is my first Baltic Porter, so I'm not sure how to judge it on style characteristics, and will judge it purely on taste and experience. Mouthfeel- nice carbonation, and with the medium body, this is pretty smooth and easy to drink. Drinkablity- at 8.5 percent, I get absolutely no alcohol warmth here- I would say that this is about 5% if I didn't know better. It actually reminds me of CCB Maduro Brown in its nutty characteristics more than anything. This is an interesting beer, I would have it again.","lnashsig","May 20, 2011"

A random distribution of lace spots forms here and there on the glass on the drink down. Smells of roasted dark malt, dark fruits, and some subtle smoky notes. Taste is of dark chocolate pudding, dark cherries, dark malts, and alcohol. A bit of cocoa nib bitterness on the palate after each sip. Slight alcohol warming in the throat. This beer is smooth and creamy with a medium body and a good level of carbonation. Overall, this is a solid baltic porter from Victory but nothing too exciting.","UCLABrewN84","May 18, 2011"

When pouring into a glass, it's color was a deep, dark, brown with a nice darker thick head that quickly dwindled to nothing after a few minutes. I tasted hints of fruits, but was mostly a roasted malty flavor. The alcohol percentage of this beer is 8.5% which was surprising because it didn't at all have a taste that would have indicated this. It was a very smooth and filling beer.

Slight chocolate and coffee nose, with some dark cherry notes. The flavor is a bit cherry and a bit coffee, and the bitter and the sweet balance pretty well. It tastes a little bit like Cherry Coke.

On the tongue those flavors come out much more distinctly, a big roasted presence up front with some combined hop and roast bitterness at the back.

Very refreshing, I've been staying away from the dark beer lately and this is a nice welcome back. It's not very gooey thick, like alot of baltics out there. The feel is pretty much medium, it's not that huge, carb is no problem here. While the body is a bit thin per style, the taste is not, Chocolate, traces of vanilla, cocco beans, roast, malt, peat, a touch of dark fruit and some licorice.

It's a malt fruity version without too much roast. There's some chocolate and caramel in the mix, but it's mostly apricots, apples, plums, etc. The flavor is rather average, sweet and lacks a hook. There's just no real oomph to the beer. It's not bad, per se, but a distinct disappointment for the brewer and style, both of which I quite like normally. The mouthfeel is thin.

The taste is actually better than the nose, sweetness comes through more here with the chocolate and carmel flavor also a slightly burn brown sugar flavor. I am hard pressed to pick up coffee here though it seemed to be in the nose. There seems to be some dark fruit characteristics that meld with the sweetness. The feel of this brew is very smooth drinking, astringency is at a minimum for me. Overall a nice brew, a good brew by victory, but it is not the Perkuno's Hammer of years ago unfortunently, that brew just kicked it and is really missed. Someday I do hope that one can be recreated.

Body is medium-light, I honestly expected something a bit heavier. Carbonation is light, as far as this beer is concerned...which is good since the body already seems light enough, much more carbonation and this would be obnoxiously prickly and would feel even lighter.

The flavor was dominated by syrupy-sweet chocolate-covered raisins soaked in alcohol, with an after-burn. There really isn't any qualities about this beer to call a 'porter' to mind; even the texture seemed a little off; more syrupy like an RIS rather than a creamy porter.

Chocolate and fruit come out midway but give way to a bit of warming heat and a long lingering caramel toffee on the palette. Fairly dry finish is a bit surprising.

Medium-bodied, yet lighter than expected, goes for smooth fluidity over resonance. The carbonation is strong enough that it disperses the flavors to create an inner mouth airiness and perfume rather than soaking presence. Coffee, butter, cola, brown sugar, would be sweet if not for the aforementioned, polished malty oats and dough. Nothing bitter here, lightly roasted with only a gradual uptick in hops at the end.

The brew pours a very dark but clear cola brown under a two finger deep tan head that fades a bit too quickly and fails to muster any lace. The nose is rich and strong, full of caramel and nuts, with just a touch of smoke. The mouth is thick, but not sticky, leaving the palate rather clean. The taste is as a porter should be, but not knock-your-socks-off good. There's roasted nuts and caramel, plus a touch of plum in the opening, chased by a respectable, certainly not overwhelming hops presence that leaves a coffee bitter feel in the aftertaste. The fruit and coffee linger in roughly equal proportion long after the liquid is gone. This is a solid, but not a spectacular product.","Globetrotter","Dec 24, 2008"

Tons of chocolate malt, with a good bit of caramel, and then all kinds of fruit flavors: raisins, prunes, and maybe even a little apricot. Not even a hint of alcohol. Definitely starts drier, with coffee bitterness, then gets more fruity and complex as it goes down. Body is nice and thick, with a near perfect carbonation level. I hadn't really considered it before, but I guess the Baltic style of porter is really the ""Imperial"" version, what with the high alcohol and the huge flavors.

Meaty, like bacon comes through overwhelmingly. There are also notes of toffee and a bit of coffee. The taste again is really smoky. The coffee comes through much more in the taste then in the aroma.

3.25,-15.8,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"This is a great example of why hyping up a beer can be a bad thing. The amount of beergeeks excited to try this was insane due to the brewing press release, big news to see Tom Baker teaming up with Victory. Then the wait with all the legal bullshit, and what follows is a blend of trying to get this one right before the big release. Well, they didn't get much right in my eyes and I'm going to try it again. Had it thrice on tap and I will be investing in a bomber, but I'm weary. No many gripes with appeaance except for head retention, poured pitch black in body much like I recall the Hammer forming a thin tan head leaving thin scant speckled lacing. I remember the Perkuno's to have texture all day with lacing throughout each pint. I think the change of the beans altered the protein count therefore affecting head. Aromatics I'm getting sweet dried fruits with some tart acidic mild offensive tones going on, chocolate roasts play nice with figs and plum fruitiness. Some mild booziness with lingering herbal hop notes comes late. Flavors insert ripe or dried concentrated fruit flavor whether it comes off plum, fig, or raisin I'd definitely call it some what vinous. Dark dry roasted malt lacking the complex mix of flavors the Hammer always provided but my point is that fruit and dark chocolate with a mildy cloying dark chocolate syrup comes off one dimensional in the flavor. Mouthfeel is full bodied assertive carbonation a bit unnatural with words like thin and blah entering my brain. Drinkability, no doubt any brew from Victory is going to be a solid player, good dark beer but never try to relive a classic craft brew like Perkuno's Imperial Hammer if you're not going to truly bring it to the table. Definitely not our beloved Hammer but Baltic Thunder I'm sure will be getting better with some age, right now it really lacks complexity.","WVbeergeek","Mar 17, 2008"

Pours black with a moderate head that fades to a thin ring. Smells vinous primarily, but there are also notes of prunes and some roasty notes. Tastes about the same- winey and roasty in about equal parts. Light chocolate and prune, a trifle sweet. The mouthfeel is a little thin, but smooth and still fine for the style. Nicely drinkable, but a bit on the lighter side for the style. I never had the old Perkuno's Hammer, so I can't compare the two. Quite nice on draft.","Georgiabeer","Mar 04, 2008"

The initial flavor impression was of alcohol, but transitioned into a very nice full-bodied roasted malt finish.

4.4,14,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"It poured a deep dark mahagony brown that had a few dark ruby red highlights along the edges. It had a foamy 2 inch head of tan colored foam that had good retention. When it receded all the way, it only left behind a handful of tan colored foamy rings along the edge and just a few spots of tan lace around the glass. It had a strong cocoa based aroma to it. Behind the cocoa was some sweet caramel, dark roasted malts, a tiny pinch of roasted hops, a dab of sweet alcohol, and the slightest touch of rust toward the end. I thought it had a very interesting taste to it. In the beginning it just had a heavy taste of cocoa powder and rust. Somewhere in the middle the taste had completely changed. The cocoa powder had turned itself into dark chocolate and the rust had left the taste all together. After the cocoa powder had transformed into dark chocolate, more flavors emerged from the background. What came out was dark roasted malts, dark fruits, roasted coffee beans, crispy roasted hops, and the slightest touch of alcohol. It you couldn't tell already, it was a full bodied beer that had a delicious full flavored thick aftertaste of dark chocolate, roasted hops, and a pich of alcohol. It was a great beer to have on-tap, but I'm sure it's the same story if you get it from a bottle.","AltBock","Mar 02, 2008"

Nutty aroma, some caramel and cocoa, light roast with a hint of grassy hops. Same in the flavour, but with more sweetness, milk chocolate, more grassy hops (surprisingly), and a bit more roast. Nicely balanced, with bitterness and faint tartness lingering, along with a delicate spicy warmth. The body was just above medium, carbonation was moderate, decent texture. Alcohol is well hidden.

Very smooth aroma, and very enjoyable. Sweet coffee flavors up front with hints of vanilla and maple syrup. Caramel malt and a slight citrus hop bite find their way on the tongue as well. Brown sugar and molasses in the aftertaste. Smooth light to medium body with a tingling carbonation. I'm not a huge fan of the style, but this beer is pretty damn good.

Nice aroma although it isn't very strong. Seems fairly average. Malty sweetness, raisins, and a slight toasted character. The taste is another story however, assertive with some complexity but not overwhelming. This is a solidly malty beer. The first thing I am hit with in the taste is malty sweetness. After the sweetness some caramel and toffee notes meld nicely with raisins. Very little yeast character here, very clean thanks to the lager yeast. There is a bit of bitterness in the finish, not too much, just enough to balance this beer out. In the late finish I pick up a few fig/plum/raisin notes, quite nice. Also in the finish I detect some alcohol. The alcohol is just noticeable enough here to detract slightly from my enjoyment of this beer and makes this more of a sipper. Mouthfeel is good, medium-full body with moderate carbonation. Very smooth but comes across a bit thin.

Yes, they are two different recipes as noted, which makes them two different beers, but the influence of one on the other is so great that one can not help but compare the two. The original came at you with a near jet-black, engine oil color and balanced the dark fruit notes with more of a coffee base and even threw in a fair amount of smoke flavor. There's just none of that here anymore. I'd liked to have seen them tweak this one a bit more here and there for a more dynamic brew overall, especially in regard to the appearance and mouth feel.

Sure, there are better examples of the style out there, but I can certainly that say that I'd make this a winter staple if they ever decide to do 6-packs.

3.73,-3.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"I'm going to try a different kind of review for this beer and just do it stream of conscious: Forgetting the history, nice label. Resolution could be better. Bill should have seen that. 7:04 pm. This one will put me to sleep. Imperial pint glass. Thinnish brown caramel as seen through the stream of beer at the pour. Yeah, somewhat light in color in the glass as well. Nice creamy tan head. Excellent retention. Smells like an average dark-roasty stout. Kind of smokey in the flavor. Lots of fruit upfront. Brown sugar across the middle. Alcohol. Background notes of thin black coffee. Somewhat similar to Perkuno's but not nearly as rich. Smooth, but also a touch raspy with alcohol. Bitterness is as I remember Tom's. Balanced. I'd like more malt though. Surprising medium body. Perhaps a bit too much zest on the tongue as well - but the carb's OK, I guess it's just lacking body. Dark fruits... is it that burnt currant I'm looking for? Yes, a little. Also bitter, sticky prune skin. Again, smokey or deeply ashen-roast in the finish. It seems something's lacking across the middle. Head retention is average - it's high alcohol so that's expected. Nice rings of thin lace at the outset. Decent spots and splashes. A ring of orange and ruby can be seen peeking through the foam at the surface along the glass. Hmmm, a kind of a burnt chestnut in the aftertaste... like that acrid note that you smell on the streets of Manhattan in late November and December. I'm not feeling like I want to finish this first glass. There's not enough malt to balance the alcohol. The fruit note is nice though. Lacks body, malt balance, complexity.","NeroFiddled","Jan 22, 2008"
4.13,7,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"A pint arrived in front of me, not so dark as to be completely black, but not at all transparent. Pillowy tan head nearly an inch thick, with minimal etched lacing as the glass emptied. Carbonation leaves a slight tingle on the palate but finishes smooth. Much sweeter than I remember the Hammer being, and a touch more estery up front...sour, raspberry-like fruitiness. Cocoa is very evident, and the malt profile somewhat overshadows the mild, lingering bitterness in the finish. Alcohol hides itself well, moreso than I remember from its predecesor. All in all a very tasty beer - another excellent brew from Victory, and worth seeking out - but also in my opinion not a dead-on clone of the Hammer.","IrishRedRock","Jan 22, 2008"
4.05,4.9,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a mahogany-brown color that is translucent at the edges. A large bubbled beige head forms and then fades to a thin ring. The aroma is of chocolate and molasses and is somewhat reserved. The taste is chocolate and roasted malt with some lingering sweetness and molasses. The mouthfeel is light and pleasant, though a bit thinner than I had expected. The 8.5% ABV of Baltic Thunder is very well-masked. I didnÂ’t detect any alcohol burn.","davidt","Jan 21, 2008"

3.92,1.6,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"IMHO, just a close relative of Perkuno that isn't as attractive and doesn't have the charm, or personality. I've heard that this particular bottling was a bit of a mix-match of a few different batches that the brew house ran. Perhaps future bottles will be more to my liking...not that this is that bad but when lined up side by side with the other aforementioned Baltic Porters, this one fell short of the mark.","weeare138","Jan 16, 2008"

4.35,12.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"D - I remember loving Perkuno's hammer, but bummed that the only place nearby that carried it was 45 min away back then. I enjoyed the revival immensely. Kudos to Victory for bringing this gem back and to Heavyweight for allowing them to keep it alive. A great beer, nowhere near the flavor of an 8.5% beer, very nuanced and well blended. It gives credit to Victory for allowing nature to take its course lagering the big beauty. I was jazzed to try the reborn Perkuno's and found it to live up the memory.","Slatetank","Jan 07, 2008"

It was good, but it definitely didn't wow me. I'm gonna grab a bomber when I see them on the shelves, see how the flavors and scents change with some time in the bottle.","ColForbinBC","Jan 05, 2008"
