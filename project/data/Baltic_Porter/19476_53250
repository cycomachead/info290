4.34,4.8,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours pitch black with a healthy, fine, two finger brown head with great retention and lots of lacing. Good aroma of dark toasted malt, chocolate and a touch of spicy rye. Flavor is smooth milk and dark chocolate, toasted malt with a hint of char, mild toffee. Finishes with very mellow blended dark malt, chocolate, char and light hop bitterness. Nice medium creamy body. Wow, a beautifully balanced and well integrated porter. The malts are some variety of chocolate malt that is great. Deceptively smooth and mellow mannered, but with interesting additional light flavors of char and light rye spiciness. Really nice. Stumbled on this on a trip and hope to find another bottle.","LiquidAmber","Mar 16, 2014"

Nice and well balanced aromas with decent strength and complexity. Taste of big chocolate, molasses, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, toasted biscuit, raisin, prune, coffee, herbal spiciness, and light smoke. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, molasses, dark fruit, coffee, toasted biscuit, and light smoke on the finish for a while.

I always seem to struggle with rye for some reason. It's a good tasting beer overall though. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, I'm surprised this is still a porter and not a stout.

There is a sourness to this beer and a bitter aftertaste that I can only attribute to spices that were used to try to get the pumpernickel flavor.

There is the sour from the rye some interesting spice notes that I almost attribute to caraway. Along with a good amount of molasses. It's the next best thing to fresh baked. The flavors are a rich dark chocolate flavor mixed with what I taste as caraway seeds or black pepper. Then it's all finished off with a sweet dark bead molasses. It's a touch too harsh on my tongue, but it's still a very well made beer, and rather enjoyable.","Vdubb86","Apr 15, 2011"

It pours a sleek obsidian topped by a finger of dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dark chocolate, cracked black pepper, clove, brown sugar, and charred pretzel. The taste brings in more of the same, with some more pepper and some bitterer dark chocolate. The body is a solid medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a very enjoyable Baltic porter, but I'd have to admit that I feel it to be a bit much to have more than one of these things at a time.","TMoney2591","Beers"

4.32,4.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Very solid beer. Pours black with a thin tan head that sticks around. Really does smell of pumpernickel- and licorice. The taste exhibits more of the pumpernickel and still has the licorice, as well as some spice. Nice and dry and spicy with caraway and Swedish licorice. Rich flavors without sweetness in a porter/stout- I like it! Chewy in the mouth, but finishes smooth. An interesting beer, and well worth having.","Georgiabeer","Nov 04, 2010"

4.21,1.7,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"500 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgård. Batch #425. ABV is 7.5%. Pitch black colour, huge brown head. Moderately roasty aroma, notes of mild coffee, chocolate and fennel seeds, possibly other undefined spices too. Rich and creamy mouthfeel. The flavour has notes of pumpernickel bread (no surprise!), fennel seeds, coffee and dark chocolate, hints of liquorice. An impressive, well made and tasty beer, but (if anything) I would perhaps recommend going a bit easier on the fennel seeds.","Sigmund","Aug 06, 2010"

Surprisingly not too much roasted / toasted malt. Tastes a hint of bitterness up front balanced with the alcohol, maybe a hint of coco. Again not too much roasted / toasted malt up front, lighter then what i was expecting. The finish is a hint more bitter than the middle, but in general a decent balance with a firm hop finish. Overal a lighter beer than what the eye may tell you, the lighter character of the pumpernickel versus malt may be why. Mouthfeel is oily and think and drinability is better than average. A solid beer with no complaints","danadeny","Jul 03, 2010"

Aroma is roasted malt, dark chocolate, pumpernickel bread and some caramel. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some coffee and charred/burnt malt in there. The brew has a good lingering bitter roasty/burnt finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and creamy, and it's well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it goes down easy and it's smooth. I think it's a pretty good brew overall, I recommend it. Due to the price it's not something I'd drink all the time, but I would definitely buy this again in the future.","bluejacket74","Jun 25, 2010"

I taste Juniper in here somewhere, too. Again, the sweet-spice combination is unique and very tasty, but eventually wears out my palate. Mouthfeel is thick and chalky at times, but well-carbonated and light on the tongue at others. To say this beer is 'all over the place' wouldn't be too far off, but most of the elements really work well together to make for an enjoyable, original beer experience. Really been impressed with the two offerings I've had from Beer Here, although I shouldn't be too surprised--the ex-Ølfabrikken brewer now makes Beer Here.

There are lots of charred notes to this beer, some hard to pin down spices, and a slightly biting hop presence. There is a bit of spice in this beer and plenty of smoked woody flavors. There is plenty of ABV present on the tongue, and some sweeter malts underneath. This is a very characteristic and assertive Baltic Porter. I'm not all that crazy about the too-up-front ABV presence and the smoked woody flavors I'm also not a particular fan of. If its a Baltic Porter that you want, than this is one hits the mark on the head. The aftertaste is slight, the mouthfeel is a touch creamy but quite mild overall.

Flavor is deep dark chocolate, medium roastiness and bitterness, faint berry note, light spicy acidic rye note, licorice. Mouthfeel is unparalleled.

Rich aroma is smoky with an overtone of fresh pumpernickel bread and hints of malt and molasses. Mouth-filling flavor is like liquid pumpernickel with mocha and molasses undertones and just a teeny hint of hops and a whisper of sweetness. Lively, fizzy texture is fairly smooth and leaves a nice tingle.","Cyberkedi","Dec 16, 2009"

There's some licorice too. Mildly minty towards the finish, I'm guessing that's the rye. Again, I can't discern a significant spice component and that restraint makes for an excellent beer. A touch of juicy pine hops appear on the finish before a dark chocolate and rye finish takes over, coating the palate along with a little licorice. Medium bodied with a deceptively soft carbonation (the large hiss when I opened portended the possibility of an overcarbonated beer, but it wasn't so), the palate is spot on for the style.

It's got a big malt backbone with slight bitterness from the hops. A slight spiciness rounds this out to make a pretty tasty beer.
