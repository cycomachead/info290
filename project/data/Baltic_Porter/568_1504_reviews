"Definitely needs to sampled out of bottle. In bottle has the taste of cap ( metal ). Loved this beer from first , 5 years ago. Great flavor that reminds me of Guinness Stout only sweeter. Like Guinness has a thick head when poured carefully in the glass. Has become very difficult to find in Peoria area."

"Beer is medium bodied, surprisingly, with moderate carbonation to propel this along the palate quite nicely. While the body feels a bit thin, it's still quite drinkable. Finishes dryly, with a small bit of residual stickiness on the palate."

"This was my first experience diving into a European porter or stout, and it was everything I could've hoped for, and more."
"O: Overall a tasty EuroPorter but not one I would pick over a fresh US version of the style. Too much alcohol and not quite enough hops, or even malt to balance it IMO. But I think that is just the style. Funny I am realizing it isn't easy to balance ABV with flavor. But this beer or two would go really well on a lazy Saturday afternoon BBQ when you have nowhere to go or no work the next day!"

"O: Doesn’t have the complexity of Olfrabrikken, but damn if this isn’t a good Baltic Porter. For $2.99 for 500ml you can’t really go wrong. I think this is my first Polish beer too. 4"
"500 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle date. Clear dark brown color with a dense 1 finger light tan head with nice retention, that reduces to a thin lacing cap. A nice amount of lacing clings to the glass as well. Aromas of big dark fruits, roasted malt, caramel, molasses, chocolate, coffee, wood, and a bit of booze. Nice aromas here with good strength and complexity. Taste of nice chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, and dark fruits; with a bit of wood and smokiness as well. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish that lingers with some caramel, and chocolate flavors with a bit of hop spiciness. Very malt forward, but also has a nice balance of all flavors. Medium bodied with a slightly higher than medium amount of carbonation. The carbonation does not really detract anything, and the beer still has a fair amount of creaminess in the mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden, only a small warming after the finish. Very good drinkability for 8.3% as well, nice and smooth. Overall this is a great Baltic porter, with a lot of complexity and nice balance."
"O - Nice flavor, a bit of a sipper, but enjoyable and something I would have again."
"I know it's a matter of taste, but this stuff is really sweet. It's educational just to taste the powerful malty sweetness without the distraction of hops."
"The body is on the lighter side of medium and, for all the sweetness, this beer's semi-dryness is dryer than I'd expect. A light alcohol kick finishes out every sip."
"Drinkable overall, and at the price point a pretty good beer but nothing game changing; just fit to style."
"O/D - Not a chance I would finish this. Too sweet. I was able to drink a quarter of the bottle. I'm not sure what the deal was with this but I just couldn't handle it. Pop instead maybe?"
"This is a really tasty Porter. Tastes very good, feels good in the mouth, some warmth going down but that's okay. Subtle alcohol, otherwise pretty well hidden for a 8.3 abv. If you're a fan of porters check this out for sure."
"On a Side Note: It was cheap, flavorful, and loaded with alcohol - it will get the job done. I would purchase this if I was planning on getting drunk on something with flavor and on the cheap side."
"Well, I guess I'm going back to Nagolskis to pick this thing up quite a bit. And to think, all I stopped in there for was andouille sausage!"
"D: medium to high"
"D - I could have a couple."
"Note: After writing this review I ate a bowl of soup and went back to finish off the last of the glass, and I got the strongest bourbon and oak flavors that I have ever tasted in a beer. If this were oak aged or bourbon barrel aged I would praise it for showing such clear bourbon flavors. Anyway, needless to say I was surprised considering that this probably never touch oak."
"Lower carbonation and a medium full body gives this beer and decent mouthfeel and good drinkability as it hides the ABV really well. As for the value, this is an insane great deal. I've passed it up many a time since I normally buy US crafts, I'm glad Dan threw one in as an extra for an IP trade."
"Totally drinkable considering the style and heft."
"This stuff is awesome. It starts off with a toasty flavor and then finishes with chocolate notes. The only way to drink this beer is at Room Temp. This is truly a meal in a bottle and it would also make a great dessert. People from Poland know how to eat good and drink good and this beer is no exception."
"This is a real dessert beer if you base that solely on the level of sweetness. It's growing on me and it's very rich. The alcohol is too subtle, some more warmth or burn would balance or cut through the sweet."
"The body is just about right for the style. It's smooth, liquid and nearly oily. This particular Okocim offering is always very consistent. I look forward to drinking it when in the mood, and it never lets me down."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I thought this was a nice change from my IPA cravings. Overall, I will come back to this porter, it was a great price and had a nice taste and feel to it."
"Drinkability is pretty good, thanks to the sweet taste and smell. Great experience for my first Baltic porter. It's cheap too, meaning I will definitely be revisiting this tasty brew."
"Mouthfeel is a typical porter-like: just about medium-bodied and soft. Drinkability is moderate. The flavors are all there, but maybe the alcohol will be the factor that limits the amount of glasses you'll have of this."
"Overall, a pretty nice baltic porter. A lot of solid flavors. My only complaint is that it ends really dry. Fairly drinkable."
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a big fluffy tiny bubbled tan head. The aroma is slightly malty, light roast coffee, touch of smoke, and milk chocolate. Medium mouthfeel. The roast is nicely balanced with a sublt sweetness that lasts throughout. Ends rather dryly and cleanly. Has a smooth velvety quality to it that is really nice. Fairly sweet and I could see how this would detract from the overall enjoyment but I actually like it as fan of sweet stoutts/porters. No real bitter or leather tastes at all. Alocohol is well hidden."
"Drinkability: Goes down nice and smooth. Belly warmer all the way down. Gives you a nice contented feel."
"B'ham UK Oct 2010"
"Used a Mug and it poured a dark brown brew with an amber medium crown. Nice blend of dark coffe, both dark and sweet cococa beans along with dark malts on the nose with no signs of alcohol. The coffe, chocolate duo greets you at the very first sip, then the flavor develops into the darkend malts ending in a roasted coffe mellow caramel mix in the aftertaste. Very refereshing with great drinkability despite its 8% abv."
"This was a well done, very smooth, medium high gravity Baltic Porter. I enjoyed it very much. Just deepened in smoothness and flavor as it warmed. Certainly worth the price for less than US$3.00 for 500ml that I paid."
"While this might be a cult classic from Europe, the bar has been raised by American craft brewers, so what was awesome years ago is just plain good today. A sipping Porter, better to pair with than drink on its own."
"D- I really like the taste of this porter and will revisit often!"
"Drinkability -- WHOA! This is a total sleeper beer. I picked this up because: 1) the name sounded familiar, 2) I'm on a Baltic Porter kick, and 3) because it was $2US for a 500ml bottle. This one has great depth of flavor, incredibly easy-drinking for the abv (nearly unnoticeable), and goes down smooth. If you love Baltic Porters or just like them, this cannot be missed. World-class."
"A solid Baltic Porter, very, very drinkable."
"I'm seriously surprised how high this beer is rated. The brewer's other beers aren't rated anywhere as high as this Porter offering. I would expect a beer of this mixed quality from some local micro/craft brewer who hadn't quite gotten it right, not from a 150+ year old brewer. But--- apparently some reviewers think better of this Porter. I don't."
"D: For its strength, the beer is relatively easy to consume because the alcohol is well masked from the taste."
"Good drinkability. Not the best porter out there - but pretty good."
"The body, though creamy and smooth, was much lighter than I expected. It was a little thin for my liking. Could have used a bit more 'chew.' Great flavors of dark fruits, candied licorice, light milk chocolate, and the finish was a tad sour and soy-sauce like. All in all, not a bad Baltic. It was cheap and decent. I'd have it again."
"D: As someone said before me, the aftertaste does have a bit of a metallic taste, as if each bach is brewed with a handful of pennies. Overall, the excellent taste and mouthfeel do make this a highly drinkable beer, and at at $2.50 a bottle, won't break your bank (and will likely get you going at 8.3%)"
"D: well this beer is a great value at 1.99 a bottle, but I can't see myself drinking it too often as the metallic taste is prominent and unpleasant. Interesting example of the style but not my favorite."
"Pors a dark, dark brown, almost black with some red tints. A frothy,tan head tops this beer and has good lacing. Milk chocolate and caramel take over the nose, with an undertone of toasted dark malt. Dark chocolate is upfront on the palate followed by caramel and toasted grain flavors, rounded of with a slight hoppy bitterness and a touch of sweet malt. Medium body with lasting residual flavors. Not a bad porter at all, one I will enjoy over and over again."
"D: what a tight beer and solid drinker. I must say that the amalgamation of flavors help shield the presence of any alcohol. It might be a bit rummy but I find that it hides in the shadows and might even help accentuate some of the other flavors. One of the better baltic porters out there...that I have had"
"Dark brown pour with chestnut highlighting. Tan head about a finger in thickness, but it doesn't have a lot of staying power. The smell is cocoa, coffee, Dr. Pepper, and used motor oil. Vanilla was the first flavor I got in the taste. Then comes some cocoa, dark fruits and, completely agreeing with a reviewer right below this, root beer. I'd like this to be thicker, but I enjoyed it otherwise."
"Decent value (500ML bottle for $2.49), 8.1% abv and a good tasting porter, never had anything from Okocim before, but I like their take on the baltic porter. I'd definetly drink this again."
"Na Zdrowie!"
"Another good baltic provided by MDs, thanks Mike! Opaque pour, with a thick mocha cap. Coffe, roasted malt, milk chocolate, and campfire all fill the nose. Nice! Sweet roasted malt and dark rum are all here for the mouth party, and are welcome! Bitter coffee, chocolate too! A good flavour profile. Boozey and warming. ABV is noticable, but pleasant. Thanks mike!"
"D - Yowza! The alcohol is completely hidden. One and done on this bad boy though, just too sweet and too strong."
"Drinkability I rated low because I woudn't have more than 1 in a night. It's the type of beer I would nurse over an hour and enjoy it as it warms up."
"Drinkability is wonderful. What an excellent porter. If this was available at home, I'd grab it often. This is a great example of the style, goes down easy for such a high ABV beer."
"D - good drinkability."
"D=4.0 Good beer at 8.3%. Taste a lot like an imperial porter. Nice back end bitterness but wouldn't want to sip on it all night"
"A dark coffee brown color with a tan head that was extremely short lived. It had a very malty aroma with a touch of something on the sweet side not exactly sure of what it was though. The taste was very strong on the malt side. Then came a little bit of sweetness a hint of chocolate or molasses. Not really a great beer but also not a bad one. I would rate this at a middle of the road kind of beer. I would drink one again, but I will not be in a hurry trying to rush to the store to get another."
"I spent 2 weeks in poland and drank a lot of Okocim but never came across this porter. Appearance is very dark almost black with a fair off tan head no lace. Smell of sweet light roasted malts, chocolate with a dark fruit note. Taste is sweeter than expected from start to finish with the dark fruits, light chocolate and alchohol. Mouthfeel has a good chewy smooth medium with good carbonation. A little sweet for my porter palate, but overall a nice porter."
"D-Really easy drinking considering the ABV, but I think I'd be hard pressed to finish two of these due to the richness of this beer."
"This was on sale for like $4. I'm glad I bought it as it was worth more than its asking price. I'll have to look into this style more."
"A personal favorite, I've had many, but never done a proper review. I prefer this a little bit chilled, but it is good any way you have it. I remember the first time tried it, it was because my friend didn't want to finish it. I'm not sure if it was too rich or sweet for him, but keep in mind it does have a sweetness that some may find overbearing."
"Bottle from Keg Liquors, IN. Deep brown with ruby highlights. Tall tan head with fine bubbles, medium carbonation that fell quickly. Aroma of chocolate and toasted malts with a bit of caramel. Tastes of chocolate, roast, some sweetness like toffee; low to no hops; balanced toward sweetness. Very drinkable, could have another."
"D- pretty well for the style, good as a sipper, enjoyable even when it was a little cooler"
"Overall, this is a solid, yet ultimately unimpressive Baltic Porter in my eyes. The major upside for this is the price, as I could drink this daily and still spend less on beer than I do now. I will definitely be buying this again, although there are other Baltic Porters that I'd rather have than this."
"I love Okacim's Lager but this one while good it is not great."
"The Polish obviously know a good bit about brewing (and drinking). This is a most excellent beer that I will hope to enjoy again sometime. A nice strong winter beer."
"Drinkability: Not quite sessionable, due to alcohol, you'd be tempted to say it is, but by the time you finished it you'd change your mind."
"This beer is extremely sweet and pure cream on the tongue. There are loads of sweet and dark malts going on here. There is a slight chicory flavor, lots of sweet chocolate and brown malts, a roasted malt note underneath, some charred flavors, some cocoa powder flavors too. This is a surprisingly sweet, yet complex porter, that is a pure sweet delight. It is strong, but deceptively so, with no real indication of its strength, beware. The charred and more drying hop characteristics, what there is of them, comes through more in the finish. There is definitely an oily finish on the tongue, but very little aftertaste and just maybe the slightest ABV warming notes in the finish. This beer is a treat. L'Chaim."
"Very lagerish in general, but in the body particularly. I wouldn't be surprised if a lager yeast was used or if it was an ale yeast that it was cold stored at the brewery. Like I said, my attempted research was thwarted."
"I would have liked the body to be chewier, but really, there's little to complain about in the mouthfeel."
"drinkability: Wow... what a great beer for the price and it's an import too. This is goignt o be a staple for me now. great beer!"
"M/D: Nice full mouth on this one, accompanied by just the right amount of carbonation. Highly drinkable, and a great bang for your buck."
"Overall, very drinkable and delicious. The mouth feel was pretty full-bodied, while still being pretty drinkable. A little bit of heat in the finish, but not enough to make it unbalanced."
"Decent body to this one. Can't knock it, although it doesn't really facilitate the drinkability. Body makes the sugar cling to the mouth. Alcohol cuts some of the sweetness, but overall, this is lacking. $1.95 for 1 pt. 0.9 oz., so it was a deal, but no way am I buying this again. Nothing off on this one, just very differently crafted. Not my taste/style."
"Drinkability is good. Very pleasant to drink. I wouldn't mind having a few of these. A pretty nice example of the style in my opinion."
"Would definitely buy another, very good porter."
"D- Pretty easy to drink and I would recommend to anyone who loves"
"Mouthfeel is a little disappointing, not much there but allows you to drink a lot of it."
"This beer pours a impressive jet black colour which lets absolutely no light thru and leaves a one finger creamy head with beautiful lacing everywhere,the aromas are strong dark coffee and dark chocolate,it has a full mouthfeel which finishes medium bodied with big tastes of dark fruits,dark chocolate and coffee on the palette which finishes a little bitter but not extreme,quite a nice brew that would be beautiful for sipping on a cold winters night in front of the fireplace."
"Drinkability - Would definitely buy another, very good porter."
"Solid, really good, very excellent priced. Nice creamy mouthfeel, if not overly thick."
"Drinkability-pretty good, It shocked me because it was so sweet. I'm so used to bitter beers that I nursed it because it was so sweet and rich. It was a good beer though. I would drink it again."
"Oh I forgot to mention one of the best parts of this beer it is relatively cheap. The only reason I stumbled across it was because I was put off by the price of other specialty beers and wanted something that was a little more cost effective."
"Great porter, will buy agian."
"I bought this based upon a previous recommendation and at $2.69, why not? Dark black, looks like a porter to me. It smells like syrupy molasses but it is faint yet sticky. The flavor is super malty and complex, fruity, nuts, molasses, brown sugar, what the hell? I guess I don;t know much about Baltic porters because this is much different than what I expected but it is still good. My first Polish beer!"
"everything you would expect from a baltic porter and then some. malty molasses that hits the nose first followed by bitter chocolate then coffee. Just as I thought there's no way the taste could compare to the nose I was beside myself. So much more going on. In my book a truly epic brew"
"Drinkability: it's tasty, but not exactly a session beer. The high alcohol and relatively complex fruit flavors suggest to me a dessert beer -- of which I'd probably have just one."
" ~ This is not a brew for the meek. If you're interested in trying an interesting and complex brew I suggest you give this one a try."
"This one is special! I've just started sampling some of the porter beers. Some that were even rated very high. This one stand out. Coffe, caramel, aroma, flavor...it's got everything. I don't know if it was a super fresh batch I picked up, but I'm heading over there tomorrow and picking up a whole case."
"drinkability is good. the brew seems to do all the right things in the wrong way. too sweet, a touch metallic in the nose and not enough roasted malt to sustain the rich and sweet character. hopefully these negative thoughts are from a bad bottle. oh well, that just means another bottle is going to have to make its way in front of this BA."
"D - Well, it's delicious, and has a great mouthfeel. I keep feeling challenged to find more aromas and flavors in there so it makes me want more and to experience it at the full range of temperatures. 8.3% says the label. A good time had by any who drinks this."
"It was pretty cool. I like these Baltics, and for a macro owned brew this seems to nail the style well. Cheers D!"
"Not something I could drink every day but a nice change and would go great as a nightcap or with a rich dessert."
"A juicy mouthfeel with a slightly bitter aftertaste on the palate. Very little heat, if any. Other than the overly intense fruit juice sweetness that pervades at the latter end, this is a well-refined B.P. for an 8%-er, and a classic that deserves to be called so. Good job Poland."
"a decent value."
"Drinkability - A pretty good beer, actually. The high ABV was hidden quite well in my opinion. Will definitely grab another next time I run to BevMo just to have around the house."
"Overall, this is a wonderful baltic porter. Great with dessert or just dandy by itself, as I am enjoying it now. This is going to be a frequent resident in my fridge from now on."
"D: Deducted some points for slightly odd flavors and noticeable alcohol."
"Drinkability is really nice for a baltic porter with an ABV of 8.3%. There is some very nice taste to this beer, but it all balances together making this a high alcohol beer that is easy to drink. Very nice beer that I would definitely try if you can find it..."
"If you like sweet beer, I would recommend this!"
"I'm not usually a big porter guy, but I think this is a pretty drinkable brew."
"Overall: Amazing drinkability. None of the flavors are overpowering, the texture matches the flavors very well. Nice sweetness balanced by roasty dry flavor/feel. No alcohol detected!"
"Sorry Okocim - this one is not worth the trouble to find."
"The first Baltic porter than really piqued my interest was Ølfabrikken, so I suppose I've been a bit spoiled when it comes to the style. This isn't a bad example, just a bit too cloying for my taste. The bleach on the nose didn't help (what's up with that?)"
"D- Well its drinkin' darn fine for right now I'll have to see what I feel like afterward."
"Definitely a beer for a colder evening or watching a late night game of rugby on the TV."
"I don't consider this highly drinkable: 500 mL was far too much for me to finish."
"Pours to a dark brown with a ruby tint at the bottom and a thin tan head that lingers thru mid-glass and leaves decent lacing. Aroma right out of the bottle is a malty mix of chocolate, toffe and dark fruits, and mouthfeel is full and sweet. Taste follows in step with the nose and the 8.3% alcohol enters into both the nose and mouth at mid-glass. This all rounds off to a nice, long warming finish."
"I really liked this one, although not one I could drink a lot of, aminly due to the high alcohol content. Very much a sipper, take the time to really enjoy this one. Not what I'd call a subtle beer, this one lets you know right from the start this is a beer not to be taken lightly. My first Polish beer, and I am glad I tried this one."
"Has a chocolate maltly taste that the smell hints to but it is much more pronounced in the taste"
"Drinkability is lacking for me due to the high abv and overall sweetness."
"The first time I tasted this porter I thought I died and went to heaven. Dark reddish brown with rich tan head that lingers. Full mouth feel and smell with the dark malts coming through. Not overly hopped but well balanced. If you like baltic Porters or would like to try one this is a good first go."
"D: Does not feel like a 8.1% ABV. Quite drinkable, but it'll knock you off your feet quick if you're not careful."
"D: This is a very good and classic example of this Eastern European style. One of the easiest to drink 8+% dark beers I have had. Paired well with some French-made Gruyere style cheese I was eating. At less than $2.50 for 500 mL/calculated to $3.25 a bomber, one of the best values out there."
"Poured from tap into 12oz hourglass. Pitch black with a little bit of a white head. Smells a little grassy and grainy. Dark but not heavy. Didn't seam to hold a lot of carbonation and I don't know if thats intentional. The taste is very sweet and simple. Low bitterness and light mouthfeel. Might be a nice option on a hot day."
"D - A higher alcohol content than your average beer (a little over 8%). Of course, it is not a beer to get drunk to, even though its possible. Someone who is not accustomed to beer may not enjoy it - but for those of us who are, it is very enjoyable."
"Overall great bang for the ol' buck brew, will have again just not a lot at one sitting!!!"
"Solid brown pour, off white head. Earthy/peaty roast malt aroma. Sweet malt and chocolate up front. Some slight dark red fruit. Pretty carbonated medium body. There are hints of malt liquor throughout, there is alcohol warming from this. Very clean finishing. Solid eastern European version of the style. Pretty drinkable and not too tough to find usually. A good standard standbye for those that enjoy Baltic Porters."
"certainly a good beer, but 500ml was a bit much for me. a bit disappointing but i had built it up for a while."
"I don't think I could get through more than one of these since its such a strong tasting and high ABV baltic porter. That being said, I am definitely enjoying the one that I am drinking."
"Very good. I could drink quite a few of these."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit watery."
"Sweet and clean on the tongue with a good viscosity. Chocolate, hint of coffee and cinnamon. A bit of graininess on the finish gives it more body. Carbonation is appropriately light to moderate. Slightly chewy in the malts on the finish. Decent feel and drinkability and quite robust. Obviously a different animal than your typical American Porter. Worth a try."
"i could easily drink these all night. i would pay because these are so heavy and evil. there is a beautiful demon inside every bottle, mean and full of flavor. highly recommended."
"Overall - A little too simple and inoffensive to be the best porter in the world, but still an excellent beer."
"(rated Jan 3, 2008)"
"This is a great brew - flavorful and complex. I would surely recommend based on flavor alone. At the price, I paid I think $2.50, I would highly recommend. A must try. Not to mention the 8+% alcohol means one 16 oz bottle and you are set for the evening."
"mouthfeel is awesome, creamy roasty, light bitterness, highly drinkable!"
"Okocim Porter is good. Alright, there, I said it. I prefer more roast and bitter character in beers of this style, but if you haven't had this fruity malt-bomb, you should. At around $4 a bottle there is barely any reason not to give it the ole college try."
"Just to warn--I've had this quite a few times now, and serving temp makes all the difference. Be sure to have this on the warmer side."
"To be frank, I haven't had a better-tasting baltic porter than this. No noticeable metallic tinges with other BP's from the same region (I'm looking at you, Baltika!); instead, luxurious notes of port-like dark chocolate and raisin rum bread coat the palate. The middle is sweet and complex, as nuttiness and hops drop in before a finish of warming booze and fig. Body is medium in thickness and nicely carbonated, but the highlight here is the flavor. Paired superbly with a plate of pork tenderloin and potatoes, and I'm sure it would go well with other meals. I'll definitely be having this again sometime."
"D - A bit too much for great drinkability, but still enjoyable! Much more accessible than the smell suggested, I will have to pick this up again sometime."
"Drinkability is good, even though I've only had just this one bottle. Great price, not that heavy or strong, tasty and well made, what more can you ask for? I'm not sure when this was made, but it has that rounded feel that either comes from age or is a huge testament to the brewmaster! Sure it's a bit thicker then Palone, but if you've had that beer, then you realize how expertly crafted this is. From now on, when I think BP, I'm thinking Okocim."
"Smooth, creamy, full-bodied with medium effervescence. Very high quality beer, good stuff."
"500ml bottle 8.3% abv"
"D-Easy enough to drink but this one is almost too sweet for me"
"D: A deceptive 8+% It seems a lot smoother and lighter. It's easy to suck it back like there's no tomorrow, but don't expect to do so without feeling the results! Good stuff."
"Pours a dark brown color with ruby highlight with some tan foam that left very little lacing. Aroma of dry chocolate, some dark fruit, slightly sour smelling. Sweet flavor, slightest hints of coffee, rum soaked fruit, raisin, dark chocolate flavor is nice, but not overpowering. Slightly sour taste as well. I think this bottle might have some age on it. Nice creamy mouthfeel, carbonation is just right. It was an ok brew, but would probably be much better fresh. Drinkability stays low because of the funkiness and high ABV."
"D- This is a baltic that will stick to your ribs. It's very thick and sweet and will warm you up with ease on those chilly Midwest winter evenings."
"Drinkability....If you want to tie one on, this is the beer for you. Very high Alcohol content. However, this isn't the reason why I drink beer. A cheap macro would do this for you."
"D- It's a slow sipper all the way as it started off a bit assertively. The alcohol didn't seem all that well hidden until the beer warmed. It's a good cold weather warmer. I'd try it again."
"D: For the price this was a great deal and a very delicious night cap. Straight from the motherland so it is my intention to try many more of these in the future with some quality Polish metal."
"Ok, so this brew is fantastic. If you like porters this is a must try. It has a nose that is very roasted barley and dark coffee and cocoa but the taste is extremely chocolatey. I love this beer, it is really a great example of a good porter. Get it, drink it, love it"
"Great stuff. Will buy again. The dark and sweet characteristics are perfect for when you want to drink solely to drink a really good beer. One of my favorite porter's for sure and I wish I would have found it sooner!"
"D: A deceptive 8+%ABV beer, drinks very smooth, add to that a great taste and eexceptional mouthfeel and you have on your hands one spectacularly drinkable beer."
"On the right side of this site, it says that all 5's should be very rare. Well - I think I've found an opportunity to give a few out. Though I've not heard of this company, I'm a big fan of the style. I picked this brew up at a local liquor store out of mere curiousity. For what you get, this is a GREAT deal - it's about $2.99 for 0.5 L of this wonderful beer. As one reviewer below me put it - ""it's the cheapest ticket to Heaven that you'll ever buy."" I'll have to check for both other beers of this style and other beers from this brewery."
"A nice beer here. I felt the alcohol was a bit forward for my tastes and this tended towards cloying at times, but worth looking to try."
"The taste is spice, prunes, and hints of chocolate, coffee, licorice, and a daint hint of port. It's mostly sweet with no clear bitterness except a spicy bite, is full, rich, smooth, and a bit oily, with a noticeable but pleasant alcoholic warmth from start to finish. The finish is long but suprisingly clean and chocolaty with fruit and warming alcohol."
"This stuff really only has a couple of flaws. First and foremost, the 8.3% alcohol keeps it from being sessionable. Secondly, it's such a rich beer that one is really all that you need. Other than that, this is the porter that all other porters wish that they could be. Drink it. Love it. And do it with gusto, folks. At $2.99 for a 500 ml bottle, it's the cheapest ticket to heaven that you'll ever buy."
"This beer had a nice, black pour with a thin, tan head. The aroma had caramel and alcohol, with an underlying note of plums. The body has a nice bready maltiness with some chocolate in it. It finishes well with a slight smokiness. This is a very tasty beer."
"Very crisp finish for a dark, 8% abv beer. Body is oddly light and airy. Good drinkability, but a little cloying."
"D - To be a dark robust beer with an 8.3% ABV, this is damn drinkable. One of my first ""WOW"" beers in awhile. I can't believe I've overlooked this for so long, and at the price, this is one of the best values out there. Highly recommended."
"D- I wish that I bought more than one of these! This is definitely a great surprise at just about $2 per 500ml bottle!"
"Overall, this is one the best beers that I've ever tried. Complex yet easy to drink and very enjoyable. I will seek this one out on a regular basis."
"Nice full mouthfeel that makes this a sipping beer."
"Baltic Porter's are always bold adventures; it is a notably distinct style. Okocim's example is perhaps one of the most magnificent I know of. It's also an excellent candidate for the cellar (this bottle drinking better than ever at one year past the 'best before'). This was one of the best beers I could find in my travels through Poland; If Polish brewers are gifted in one style, surely this must be it."
"Poured almost black in color that had a good head that was caramel in color. Kept some bubbles around the glass as drank. Also a little lacing. Smelled of alcohol, chocolate, malt, and sweet. Reminded me of a wine smell. Tasted a little on the sweet side. Also chocolate and malt. Then again, tasted a little on the wine side. Felt excellent in the mouth. Carbonation was good. You could tell that you had something in your mouth. Felt a little thicker. I could drink these all the time. You would have to be carfull, the higher alcohol content was evident."
"A good Baltic Porter. Not something I would want to drink all the time but nice if I wanted something sweet and slightly boozy."
"D - Not impressed. It was too sweet, way too sweet."
"Sweet vs. bitter, good battle great porter. There's something about this that captivates me. Not what I'm used to this bottle kept me intrigued. Nice roasty aroma with a powerful sweetness reminiscent of dark fruits. Pour is nice and medium dark with a great tan head and lots of visually wonderful lacing. Moderately thin compared to American porter standards but very creamy and fullfilling afterwards. Interesting flavor, really sweet considering but it works nicely. There is almost a port quality here. Bitter and amazingly sweet this one is very good."
"D- Drinks great for such a high ABV%"
"Picked up a 500 ml bottle of this beer in Davis Square. Poured in to my Ommegang Chocolate Indulgence chalice a near black complexion, that has hues of ruby at the bottom of the glass. Nose was strong, with dark fruits such as cherries and prunes. Rich dark chocolate and a perfume of alcohol are also there. Taste is pretty amazing, with much of the same, plus cola and a nice caramel flavor that is mildly reminiscent of a Doppelbock. Body is heavy, hoppy, and bursting at the seams with complexity. Drinking Okocim Porter should be a process of sipping and savoring, so that all of those interesting traits come to the forefront. I am very impressed with this beer. This is a style that I have been losing faith in as of late, as many of them just do not seem all that complex. This is an exception."
"Drinkability: I thought it pretty darn good for a style I usually don't drink much of."
"I'm sold. Terrific porter, all the complexities of ale brewing with the painstaking caretaking of lagers evident as well."
"D - This beer hits you hard and fast. Mainly an after dinner treat as it would be a bit cumbersome to drink more than a few."
"Notes: Its overall drinkability for me was low due to its unchecked and unbalanced syrupy sweetness. The alcohol had some ruff edges as well; still this is a very interesting brew."
"There is a khaki colored head sitting proud over an near black body. The strong aroma gives off a bouquet of cherry, currents and booze with a hint of vanilla. The body is thick and silky but it doesn't stick to your mouth. There is a lot of complexity in this porter with big fruit flavors balanced by chocolate and coffee. There is enough alcohol in it to warm you all the way down but you can only detect it in the aftertaste. This is a standard barer of this style for me. Try it with dark chocolate covered strawberries or tofu in a brown mole with roasted corn."
"Another decent Baltic Porter from Eastern Europe. I can't say that this one possesses any special qualities that make it stand out from the others, but it's a good beer. If you like the style, give it a try. Recommended."
"Overall, a great beer that I would certainly drink again."
"D - Yes. It's a very easy drink."
"Dark rich opaque brownish-black color with a tan head. Aroma is raisins, plums, roasted malts, caramel, and chocolate. Taste explodes in your mouth with nice texture, extremely flavorful with malts and chocolate most prevalent. Really nice porter, definitely recommended!!!!"
"Drinkability: I paid around $3 for the bottle, and I think that's a great price. Despite it being on the sweeter side, with less hops to counterbalance, it's not overpoweringly sweet, and there are a lot of complex malt flavors. The roasted and darker flavors seem to combat the sweetness a bit too. I'd certainly buy this again, and as a dessert beer after dinner this was ultimately very satisfying."
"this beer is super easy to drink albiet sweeter than any porter i can call to mind at the moment."
"D - Excellent drinking beer - goes down smooth. This is the first time I've ever pondered a vacation to Poland!"
"Overall, this is probably the best malt-bomb I've ever had. It's packed with the flavors all dark beer fans want - dried fruit, coffee, chocolate, and maybe a little licorice/anise in the finish as it warms."
"D: I think I could drink this until I was dreaming. The flavors are beautifully matched and the alcohol is kept at bay with the velvety goodness that grabs your attention. Absolutely enjoyable and highly recommended!"
"Smooth and rich in the mouth at first with a relatively clean, watery finish."
"D= I have become a fan of brown Porters and this Baltic Porter falls right in my comfort range. I have and will purchase this beer again (and again)."
"D - Closer to a stout than most porters I am used to, but that seems to fit the style. Alcohol is high but not much of a factor in taste. One of the most sessionable beers compared to its ABV I can think of. A beer I would love to try fresh on-tap. -"
"D - Delicious for an end meal or end of the night beer, this would be a wonderful nightcap (and it was), but I would not want to drink more than a full bottle in one sitting. That said, I would probably purchase this beer again, but for the specific purpose of celebration or nightcap."
"Overall, Baltic in Baltic porter. Very heavy, very strong, very potent, and very warming. This beer would have been alot of fun in College."
"D- A nice fire-side warmer. 500ml bottle that can be split or consumed solo."
"D: A good night cap beer. Would be nice on a cold night in front of a fire. I wouldn't want more than one."
"A well done Baltic porter for sure."
"Drinkability: very tasty. Not a subtle porter, but one that delivers higher alcohol and big flavors. This won't be my last bottle."
"This tastes exactly like a baltic porter should. In fact, all porter should taste like this. Hell, all beers should taste like this! Well, perhaps not, but as for tonight, this beer is divine. The malt comes a bit sweet and chocolates come around, and hints at molasses, pine, hop oil, coffee, toffee, and dark skinned fruits. Fan-friggin-tastic. The body is solid, the carbonation is fine and feels silky smooth all the way down. I did a double-take when I wondered about the ABV. 8%? Don't even feel it till well after, but still manages to warm the soul. I'll have to visit this one often!"
"D: It's rich and creamy making it a nice taste treat that is a wonderful winter warmer or late cold night brew."
"In the world of BJCP judging, a 50 is the top score and never assigned. A 45 is as high as one normally goes. This beer is a 46. If it was a Spinal Tap amplifier it would go to 11. Get my drift? Don't pass this up if you have a chance to get a bottle in good condition."
"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this porter. Worth trying for sure."
"Pours a virtually opaque black with a great tan head that sticks around. Nose is sweet like chocolate would be, but is overall mild and has no extreme character. Flavor is very smooth, but at the same time is very sweet. I want to say it is bordering on too sweet, if it has not already crossed that line. Slight malt tones underneath all that sugary sweetness. Mouthfeel is low with carbonation. Drinkable, sure. But for some the extreme sweet might be a turn off."
"The 8.3% is extremely well-incorporated. (That's the ABV given on this bottle.) I won't say well-hidden, because it's there as a warming undercurrent. Overall an insanely delicious offering. I'm not uber-crazy about typical porters, but once you put ""Baltic"" in front of it I'm in. This is by far one of the best I've had. Like the best doppelbocks, this is what I'd call ""comfort beer"". Time to stock up."
"Suprisingly drinkable for its sweet malt structure. The taste is kept in good balance by the bitter hops and alcohols. I can't drink this fast, but can drink it all evening long. Another factor contributing to the drinkability is its price. At only $2.50 a bottle(without case discount) this is a great value. Delicious porter, highly suggested."
"Pours a mahogany almost black with a tan head that dies instantly and doesnt lace. Smells roasty with a little cocoa and dried dark fruits. Starts mild with sweet fruit creeping on the palate followed by a roasty, dry hoppy finish. Medium in the mouth with a tickle of carbonation. Drinkable as can be. A delicious porter."
"Okocim simply bursts with flavor--roasted coffee, chocolate, a hint of caramel. It also finishes well, leaving me with the roasted flavor. I find that it goes well with smoked mozzarella, and I have also had it to follow up a sumptuous roast turkey dinner with all the trimmings. Having more than one of these would be all too easy. A gem from mother Poland, very smooth and a beer that easily masks its rather high ABV (8.3% according to its label). Just outstanding, a must try and, to me, a very close second to the Taddy Porter atop my own list of preferred porters. At $2.29 at the local Piccadilly, this is an absolute steal."
"This is a pleasurable, but sweet, porter."
"D-first one went down faster than expected! on to the next!"
"Drinkability: Excellent. This beer manages to maintain a sense of balance despite its heavy ABV and bold flavorings, making it very drinkable for a beer its ""size."""
"A liter in, & I'm done. The boiler isn't working, but my belly is warm. Time for bed. :)"
"Overall, a nice complex porter. A little too far on the sweet side."
"Dark coffee-colored porter. There was barely any head but what was there was light brown. Nice lacing on the glass. I smell a sweet molasses-like aroma combined with an almost smokey roasted malt smell. Perhaps I detect chocolate as well. I could be fooling myself but I could swear I smell the alcohol content. Tastes like a very good porter. Semi sweet and warm from the 8.3% alcohol. Slight bitter aftertaste. Hint of smokey roasted malty overtones. Very smooth and heavy with little carbonation like a good porter usually is. The high alcohol content and heavyness makes this beer a two-beer-a-night kind of beer. This is a very good beer that would make an excellent appetizer to a meal. I like it a lot."
"Opinion: This beer is pretty good and has a deep depth of flavor and is really deceptively drinkeable for being such a strong beer. The fruity notes compliment the whole ensemble, and this ends up being really refreshing...if it weren't for the 8+% alcohol. This beer is bordering on a dark lager, but the fruitiness sets it apart from that category. Either way, I would definitely drink this beer again if given the opportunity."
"Not as fruity as I was expecting, but quite something of a style I don't seek out often. This beer went very well with a few pieces of Cacao Reserve extra dark chocolate."
"Drinkability: superb tasting beer that is very easy to drink. This is a great example of a wonderful porter everyone should try."
"Pours a nice dark brown. Head is modest and dissipates quickly. Aromas of vanilla, nicely roasted malts, toffee and dried fruit. Flavor is nicely balanced... there is definite alcohol here, but it is in harmony with a sweeter malty profile with nice accents of espresso. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I crave, but still quite respectable. All in all a very nice Baltic Porter. I think Sinebrychoff has more depth, but at $2.25 for a pint bottle of Okocim versus $3 for the smaller Synebrychoff, this is an excellent value."
"Had this at the Emerald Coast Brew Fest in Pensacola, FL. Poured a dark brown color with a nice tan head that dissipated slowly. Aroma was chocolate, roasted malts, and dark fruit. Flavor was sweet, featuring raisins and roasted malt. Mouthfeel was good and drinkability was high. Pretty good stuff"
"D- Wow, I can not believe this porter is at 8%abv it is too smooth, the alcohol presence is superbly masked and I could drink this all night long. I would pick this up again when in the mood for a solid, tasty, easy drinking baltic porter"
"Pours jet black with a tan head. Aromas of coffee and alcohol, hints of vanilla and even bourbon. In the taste, malty coffee and sweet alcohol. Small amout of vanilla, yet yery hidden. A malty mouthfeel and an aftertaste of chocolate and alcohol. I like the sweet alcohol and smooth bourbon-ish charicteristic alot. A very nice porter."
"The mouth feels fantastic holding the beer, crisp as a beer should taste, but somewhat understated, to my palate very agreeable. I would rate this as a very drinkable beer, certainly wouldn't mind having another, and would highly recommend anyone, especially those that like the darker beers, pick one up."
"(EDIT) Per the new BA magazine, some Baltic Porters utilize lager yeast. Maybe that's why I'm picking up all of the doppelbock similarities?"
"In closing, this is a great drink. The warmth at the end really sells this drink to me and I look forward to keeping a few in my minifridge for after a long day of work. The mouthfeel leaves a nice feeling that reminds me of when I drank more hard liquor and it's a feeling I enjoy"
"Cheers!"
"Pours dark brown with mahogany highlights from the 500 ml bottle. A thick, tan 2 finger head quickly fades to a persistent foam ring. Aromas are dark chocolate with brown sugar and toffee. Dark fruit aromas mingle with a hint of the alcohol. Smells really good! Initial taste is sweet... nearly too sweet... but followed by roasted malt, chocolate and alcohol. Alcohol is not well hidden, but adds a welcome warmth on the swallow. Body is slightly thinner than expected carbonation is fairly low as expected. Drinkability is good despite the sweetness and alcohol."
"500ml bottle label state 8.3 abv. chilled and poured into a nonic. Head rose to approximately one finger of thickness and now lingers about a centimeter off the surface with a milk chocolaty, tan wonderful wall of sticky lacing. Body is completely opaque black and shiny. Smell is complex and well shaped by bottle conditioning. The aroma of fruit mingles and is eventually over taken by beautifully showcased roasted barley and thus displays a great nuttiness, dry roast coffee and hints of chocolate. Hops are subtle in the aroma if even present at all. Taste is very quaffable with subtle bitterness coming to ward the finish and a slight sweetness through and through. There is a great deal of complexity to the taste both dark fruit and roasted malts are present with a very pleasant touch of acidity toward the finish. Great subtly and flavor in this. The ABV seems right for the style I am happy especially with the price, for that and every thing considered you can't beat this beer. If you see it and you pass it up your loss and more for me."
"Taste is heavy and leans on the sweet side, but not cloyingly so. Lots of roasted malt bitterness with an acidic bite on the finish. Alcohol certainly hits the tongue as well, but that's not a bad thing. Molasses, Brown Sugar, Chocolate, vanilla bean, and caramel dominate with a subdued fruitiness showing up in the background. This isn't the most complex beer I've ever had, but it's very nice, almost like a glass of dessert that's not so sweet you'll hurt your teeth. Mouthfeel is heavy and very thick with a medium carbonation. Drinkability is limited by the heavy ABV. Two of these would do me in I think, but it might work best to share after dinner."
"D - Decent enough but there are more interesting, lower ABV% & cheaper porters out there."
"Notes: Sweeter than other baltic porters I've had, this one screams ""dessert beer."""
"Got in trade with Bort11 - thanks! Poured from a 500ml bottle with no dating info into a pint glass. It was a dark, dark brown with deep mahogany highlights. It had an average head that whittled down to a collar of thin foam. The smell was roasted malt in the back with a dark fruitiness, raisin maybe, dominating. As I'm not a fan of the raisin smell in beers, it took a hit in the rating. The taste was pretty good but again dominated by the raisin taste so hard to enjoy. This is my first Baltic Porter so I'm hoping this isn't standard for the style as I've really gotten into American and English Porters this year. Overall, I'd give it a mild recommendation and one is probably enough for me. (3.5, NA-BOT, ML, O)"
"It's boldly malty, craftily complex, and blended and meshed and artful. It's a shameless malt monster, down to earth and gutsy with assertive character. The ABV is brassy, but it's so integrated that it's just a happy warmer, is all. The great reputation is one thing- the reality may just be even better."
"Thick, and in your face. If you drink more than one, trouble might be right behind. High alcohol expressiveness, so know your limitations. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Well, despite the fact that it is May, the weather is cool and this seemed liek a perfect drink for the fall like day. Nice and tasty, a porter in steroids, without being over the top."
"Poured a deep dark brown, near black with a nice creamy head. Light through the edges of the glass. Roasted (funny word) malts with chocolate, fruits, and maybe a hint of coffee in there. Darn good taste. Chocolate and caramel malts balanced by a sweet, fruity taste after. Mouthfeel is good and medium to full. I really enjoyed this beer overall and will have to pick it up now that they have it in my former home, NC. Quite drinkable if you didn't get the point. Big thanks to Bort11 for this bottle that he got for $1.99! Drinkable and affordable is never a bad thing."
"This poured a a deep opaque. There is a very light tan head that isn't too thick and doesnt leave too much lacing. As it warms the aromas turn to a nice roasty chocolate flavor. There seems to be some slight DMS to this flavor. There is a slight hop aroma as well. The flavor gets stronger as wel as it warms. The chocolate and bready roast comes out and balances well with everything in there. Warm silky chocolate roast and the light slight bready taste come together great with the light creamy mouthfeel that is something to really take in. All in all it is a very drinkable porter. One of the best."
"D - Obviously not a session beer. I'm loving this one, but I can't see having more than one a night."
"Definitely recommended."
"i don't typically favor porters or stouts and also wouldn't expect much from a beer that was not from one the top beer countries but, wow! this beer was, of course, quite dark with tan head. smell was of huge dark bready malts with espresso and chocolate notes dominant. big, malt sweetness upfront balanced out well by the bitter roasty flavors and the hops which play a supporting role in this beer. can't detect much from the hops other than their background presence to provide balance. somehow manages to finish crisp enough to leave you wanting more. slightly heavy mouthfeel. if i ever want a dark, malty, big beer this would be a top choice."
"Thanks to the Florida Gators for the beer."
"Drinkability: I honestly don't know if this has benefited from age or not. It's a different experience, but not necessarily better or worse."
"Highly recommended! One of the absolute best porters I have ever had."
"A pour into nonic glass from .5 liter bottle produced huge 2"" head with a perisistent head and good lacing (head eventually collapsed to tight 1/8"" on 2nd pour into 12 oz. glass. Very dark brown w/a off white to tan head. Minimal, fine carbonation. Smell is a mixture of very slight roast, some slight sourness, very sweet malt and medicinal qualities. Taste is very medicinal, cloying and barleywine-like initially some stone fruit elements. Some hop attack there. On the finish, medicinal note finally gives way to a good roast quality with lingering hop bitterness. The 8.3% alc by volume listed on the label is very evident, contributing, I'm sure to the barleywine-like characterics of this beer. On a winter's night a good quaff but not to be considered sessionable by any stretch. It has a more roast finish, I find, than other Baltic porters I've tried (Utenos, Liviske). Complex flavor profile indeed; would be on my winter drinking list."
"But the quaff, wow, what a mixture of anise, plums raisons and chocolate. Is this a RIS or a porter? Thick and chewy, I could sip these for quite awhile, being careful of the 8%."
"D- It is very tasty. I am not sure how many of these I would buy though. I think it is good but at same time it just doesn't seem to be my true style."
"ABV isn't much higher than Sinebrychoff, but once again I find this affects me quite a bit more...I can't have nearly as much of this as I'd like."
"The Okocim Porter pours impenetrably black with a thin tan head. As you reach the bottom of your glass, it reveals a much less ominous reddish brown hue. The smell is mostly that of roasted malt, coffee, cocoa and a hint of sweetness. It has moderate carbonation and is medium bodied, but the mouth feel was thinner than I expected. The taste is mildly sweet roasted malt that is offset by alcohol and some hop bitterness that reminds me of dark rum based deserts. There is noticeable heat on the semi-dry finish. Overall, I found this to be an intoxicating, but not exceptional, example of a Baltic porter. Maybe I was expecting too much, given some of the stellar reviews from other BAs. I just wasnt bowled over by this beer. Its certainly a good Baltic porter; I just dont think its anything more than that. I'll take a D. Carnegie or Sinebrychoff over the Okocim any day."
"D - Unfortunaly the alcohol does cut into the drinability a tad, however this is still a very good sipper and a beast of a porter. I enjoyed, just needs to tone it down a tad. Overall very nice though."
"This is a wonderful sipping brew. IMO - one of the best in style in the world (coming in a very close second to Zywiec Porter). Complex yet drinkable."
"Pours a very dark brown to black, but looks a little thin. It has a thin offwhite head and minimal lacing. The smell is quite winey. There are also notes of dark malt, sweet dark fruit like prunes and dates, barley syrup. The taste is similar with soft notes of roasted malt and chocolate tossed into the equation. Very creamy mouthfeel and a medium body with lower levels of carbonation means that this one slips down extra easily A very nice Baltic Porter, well worth seeking out."
"The alcohol makes it's presence known immediately and after a couple of nice swallows of this beer, you reallize it has turned into a sipper to be enjoyed over a long time."
"Pours a dark brown with much carbonation and little hops or malt aroma. Taste is roasted sweetness with alcohol coming through in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and drinkability is high. ""Traditional Polish Taste""-wow I would like to try some more of this ""Polish Traditional Taste"""
"What a pleasure this will be to drink. Immediately soft and creamy mouthfeel sucks you right in. Toffee, sweet caramel, and chocolate, cappuccino with an underbelly of figs and raisins coated in sweet sugar. Sweet caramel and molasses notes stick to the tongue and are noticeable in the aftertaste. Fluffy nestle chocolate powder flavors. Slight bitterness towards the back of the mouth. Medium to full bodied. Smooth and easy drinking. A hint of spicy alcohol becomes apparent as it warms. A very excellent porter, especially for the price. Worth picking up if you see it."
"for anything more more than average drinkability, it's a little too sweet and the smell a little too dairy. an interesting beer, but not one i'll rush back to."
"I continue to be amazed my how different each Baltic Porter is that I try. The wine characteristics of this one really set it apart. Definitely worth seeking out. Just don't grab Okocim Lager by mistake."
"Deep chocolate colored body topped by a long-lasting tan head. Beer is very bright where the light shines through, no haziness whatsoever. Aroma has a nice sweet plum note. Flavor is impressive. Up front the sweetness hits me first, then some nice fruit and caramelized sugars. Clean, toasted malt flavors intermingle perfectly. Slightly smoky note as well. Finally, some herbal bitterness comes through, and it persists well after I swallow. Mouthfeel is smooth. Drinkability is very good, especially given the higher ABV. Really a wonderful beer. I've known about it for year's but this is my first experience with it. Amazing how we sometimes take the commonly available splendors for granted sometimes."
"Brew pours to a black color that is nearly opaque in appearance but does let some red highlights through. Gas a nice medium colored tan head that has pretty good legs and left a good amount of lacing down the side of the glass. Over all this is a very good looking brew. The aroma was noticeable right from the poor, with a strong scent of alcohol mixed with licorice and coffee. As I took a deeper smell I also notice chocolate, dark fruits and maybe a sherry scent? Very complex smelling brew, which is nice on a cold snowy night. The taste is also very nice with a sweet flavor that seems to dominate with brown sugar, licorice, malts, dark fruits and butterscotch then breaks to a roasted flavor, which is somewhat surprising as I figured that it would be more of a burn flavor. Over all this is a great brew but for some reason I was expecting more but it is hard to specify what that more is. I guess after hearing about this brew for a number of years and then actually being able to give it a try, it did not live up to all the hype. Still a strong brew (no pun) in my book."
"Dark malts are simple but very effective as the backbone flavor with some light fruitiness and a slight smokiness in the finish. Wonderfully free of alcohol notes. Finish is dry and balanced and mouthfeel is creamy and velvety smooth. Plenty of flavor but not too overpowering or unbalanced. Wow, this is really good, probably Poland's finest beer."
"D - Porters aren't my favorite because I find their bitterness displeasing, but this one is excellent. Taste is really fantastic. Good stuff all around."
"Feel is stiff carbonation, dry bitter finish.Creamy body."
"Notes: I knew this was a highly respected beer going in to this sampling but I""ve had this many times and every time I come out of it dissapointed. I think this may be my last attempt. Its ""OK"" but there are many, many, porters worthy of my money compared to this."
"Creamy, feminine and quite tasty. Again semi sweet chocolate with sweet coating toffee/caramel that intermingle quite well. Hints of dark fruits mainly black currant, with a slight roast. Could have benefited from the addition of more hop balance. Still a very solid easily drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: Good. It's different from every other porter - and even baltic porter - I've had, with those marine and extremely subtle anise notes. That said, perhaps a bit overrated."
"Pours a nice dark brown/black color, nice carbonation, nice tiny head which leaves some lacing. The nose is of sweet sightly roasted malts, toffee/caramel, and slight alcohol. The taste is very sweet/malty, nice toffee/caramel taste. There's a nice warming effect from the higher ABV in this one. Medium body, very well rounded. Very drinkable, one of the best porter's for me too date, glad I had a chance to try this one."
"A very great offering. This one is a bit too sweet to be enjoyed with anything but itself. A definite must try for anyone looking to try a great beer."
"Aroma was of strong black malt with some chocolate and mild espresso notes. Taste was almost like a Hershey's chocolate bar, probably the closest resemblance to milk chocolate I've ever tasted in a beer. There was a decent black malt backbone to it, but chocolate dominates the taste. The mouthfeel had a pleasant light carbonation that went very well with the chocolate taste. The alcohol was very well hidden and there was a decent level of bitterness. I must say, at just $2.49 for a half liter bottle, this a great value for a great beer."
"I have a feeling that this is one of those beers that I'm going to enjoy more every time I drink it."
"D - Very interesting. Lots of big flavors make you want to sip this one over and over."
"Deep black with slight red hints, and a thick foamy brown head. Very nice. Aroma is sweet earthy plums and alcohol with roasted malts. Taste is syrupy and sweet, with malts and coffee flavors. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both slightly above average."
"Poured into a pint glass. This beer is dark - when held up to the light it looks like blood/on the the table it looks more deep brown. Small white head to start that quickly leaves a bunch of lacing with some slight stickness on the side of the glass. Smell is sweet roastedness up front followed by a little dark chocolate or coffee. The taste is absolutely tremendous - sweet chocolate, roasted maltiness, and a nice bitter coffee finish. If only the mouthfeel was little creamier, this would be heaven in a glass. Regardless, I could drink this all night long - great stuff and a perfect dessert beer. Highest recommendation."
"Pour from 500ml bottle. No head. Has my beer gone flat or is this normal? the smell is quite refreshing, with a early promise of bitter coffee, yet slightly raw. The taste is great: a roasted bitterness along with a raw malt taste. Not to mention, the obvious roasted coffee or chocolate notes. The alcohol taste is conceiled very well in the bitter finish. No lacing. The only downside i must add is the high degree of thin tasting sweetness. Pretty rich, so not too drinkable in a way."
"One of my very favorite porters and arguably the number one in its class, Okocim have brewed an absolute belter of a beer here, and it's one i'm hoping i'll be seeming on my local bottle o shelves for a long time to come."
"Hand carried back from Kansas City: Gomers."
"It's as smooth as silk - perfectly suited as a dinner and desert sipper and easily the best porter I've had the pleasure of tasting."
"Overall, this was a very good beer that would pair perfectly with a hearty, stewed meal on a cold winter night."
"Rich taste, but the sweetness becomes prohibitive in the drinkability. I easily finished the bottle, but could not drink a second one in a row."
"While I usually cling to my father's Irish roots I will admit to having Polish blood in me with this beer in hand!"
"Rich, warming and full bodied, I can easily say that this is the best Polish beer I've ever had."
"drinkability is great. very tasty and well balanced. i definitely need to get some more of this one."
"Pours a grougeous dark ruby red with about an inch of tight head. The head has good retention and laces the glass as it is consumed. Has a sweet malty smell to it, no hop aroma detected. Thick and tangy on the tongue with a roasted taste as goes down the palate. Can't quite figure the taste out just nice and smooth, would love to replicate this one."
"A nice chocolate flavour comes in this dark brew. it has ruby tones when held up to the light. The head on mine was very thin and tan (sounds like I'm writing about a model). This one is also sweet. It would be nice with a meal or with vanilla ice cream even. A fine beer but one is enough due to the sweetness."
"M&D - overall very smooth and flavorful, and easily drinkable, well blended and layered flavors give this porter a great mouthfeel, a marvelous beer"
"I love it. I'll be drinkin' this bad boy again and again and again . . ."
"Smeels okay, but not really distinctive. Looks good though. Deep dark brown with a decent head and good lace. Too sweet to make a habit of."
"the flavors is rich and chocolately, but buffered by balanced bitterness. the mouthfeel is perfect for a rich brew, yet lively. there's a hint of dark fruit"
"This beer is a fantastic example of what a porter can be."
"The appearance is very nice with a little head retention and very nice lacing. The smell is slightly funky sweet with some dark roasted coffee malts. The taste is sweet and it's a little overwhelming. The taste is a litte off with it's sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine, but I don't think I will be having too much of this beer anymore."
"Interesting, the flavor is much less complex than the aroma. Thankfully, this was not as sweet as I anticipated. Good carbonation, and no lingering sweetness as I anticipated. This is very well balanced, and one I will seek out again. Thanks to Dog_food for the recommendation of this tasty brew."
"Slainte!"
"Pours a clear very dark red-brown with a bubbly tan head that never completely goes away. Aroma of olives, slightly winey, dark chocolate, roasted malt. Taste was a coffee front with lots of bittersweet chocolate and warming alcohol. The finish was bitter like raw cocoa, and lasted pretty long. Mouthfeel was quite thick and warming, the high ABV noticeable but not overpowering. This is a good dry porter and the first Baltic Porter I've tried, good stuff."
"Yummy yummy yummy."
"Mouthfeel is mildly grainy with lingering of cocoa, and sweet cola on the tongue...weird that hopdog also got the cola thing as well."
"A very tasty and drinkable big beer. Rich and full bodied, but would make a tasty, slow paced decadent session. Approachable yet complex, ill be enjoying this one again!"
"Pours very dark brown with a light tan head. The aroma is very chocolatey with some roast for good measure. Very chocolatey flavor with some dried dark fruits. Lingering bitterness and alcohol. Very rich and full bodied. Lush on the tongue. This is good stuff."
"Poured out black, but looked more dark brown when held to light. Had a beige colored head left some good lacing around the glass. Smell was sweet, maybe had some chocolate and a slight roastiness, but it seemed a bit weak. Taste starts of with mostly caramel and a touch of toffee, a little bit roasty before the finish, then the sweet caramel comes back to join in. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. This was certainly different than I was expecting, but was still enjoyable. The place I got the bottle didn't seem to have very good conditions, so maybe this one is even better when taken care of."
"Pretty good."
"Poured a deep brown with hints of red along the glass, with a beige colored head about an inch high clings to the glass as well. A fragrant sweet aroma hits the nose, with coffee, chocolate, and malt. Then a dried fruit scent comes through, much like currants or raisons, very surprising. The malt dominates the flavor almost till the end, when that surprise of aroma comes foward. A dried fruit flavor lingers on the palate after each taste. A rich mouthfeel, it coats the palate nicely, till the burning sensation of alchol hits the throat. Still, this fairly easy to drink beer, very surprising in taste and aroma, for a porter. This beer should be treated as it were a imperial stout, drink slowly and enjoy the complexity that it brings."
"Overall, a very interesting beer. Quite different from a more traditional British or American porter, and not in a bad way. I live in near a small Polish enclave here in Brooklyn, and Polish beer is very cheap, so I will likely be picking this up again. Recommended."
"There's tons of this beer, along with just about every other polish brew imported to the states, in the vast eastern european section at Liquor Depot in New Britain, CT."
"Deep dark brown, nearly opaque, with some frothy tan head. Dark, quite dark. Smells allllmost sickeningly sweet, and malty. Dark fruits come to mind. Taste is... nice, but potent. Raisins, coffee, maltyness all come to mind. The first few sips are quite nice, but it quicky becomes overly sweet. Mouthfeel is nice, but... overall, I'd like to have a tiny sample of this with or after dessert, but the whole bottle I'd never get through. I'd rather have the Finnish porter in the top 10."
"There are meatier, ballsier examples of the style in my experience but this is good stuff."
"Drinkability: For the most part, this beer was all alcohol and sugar. Finishing the 500ml bottle was a hard-won battle. An appallingly syrupy beer with no redeeming qualities. I much preferred the Sinebrychoff Porter and Duck-Rabbit's Baltic Porter over this mess."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a very dark brown with a small tan head. The main aroma I smell is caramel, and there's also some dark fruit, molasses and chocolate. It tastes the same way to me, except with a bit ofnoticable alcohol in the taste. It starts out sweet, and finishes with a bittersweet aftertaste. Also as it warms, I can taste some licorice too. The taste gets better as it warms up a little bit. The mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, and it's also creamy and smooth. The drinkability is good too, even with the high ABV. I should have bought more than one bottle of this, overall I think this is pretty good."
"Notes: Simply fantastic. Very few beers have a mouthfeel as heavenly as this. So delicious and quite drinkable as well. This will become another regular in my home."
"Dark brown in color with a tan head. The aroma consists of caramel and milk chocolate with dark fruit in the background. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with a nice carbonation to it. This is a big, malty Baltic porter. Vinous through and through. Chocolate and coffee emerge behind the fruitiness of it all. Finish leans toward the dry side with anise in the background. This is more of a slow sipper due to the high alcohol content. It's something nice to warm you during the cold winter months, but I see this more as a night cap due to its hefty body and higher alcohol."
"Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a nonic pint glass. I've been waiting a while to try this Baltic Porter and was finally able to bring it home with me. Poured a gorgeous deep translucent brown with a finger of tan, creamy foam. Smells of molasses, dark brown sugar, alcohol, licorice. Taste is sweet at first. There's that molasses again followed by black plum, sugary malt and mocha. Alcohol is present but in a good way. Medium mouthfeel with carbonation lingering between light to medium. This is a world class beer and I was not disappointed in the least bit. I look forward to trying Okocim's other offerings."
"Nearly pitch black with a creme-colored head. It smells of chocolate liqueur and port with a hint of cherry. Overall, Okocim feels quite sweet, featuring tastes of cocoa, toffee, roasted grain and wild fruit, with an undertone of dry coffee. A smooth drink, it has a bit of acidity and minimal bitterness creating an experience more like a lightly carbonated red wine than beer."
"D - A bit sweet to be able to drink several of these but a great porter none the less."
"I tried this beer after a good recommendation from a Polish collaborator of mine. I now consider him more of a friend because of this beer. way to go, Lukasz! Pours very nice and creamy-looking with a solid-looking head. very dark brown body. looks great. Odor is all roasted malts, a little chocolate, maybe a bit of fruitiness. Taste really is fanstastic. Tried it two days after having some Baltika #6 Porter and this blows it out of the water. Very chocolately, slightly burnt and bitter, nice hops which are mostly noticeable during the requisite burps. creamy, milky, foamy mouthfeel. perfect for the style...and almost stout-like. goes down very easlily, despite the high ABV. makes me want to drink more Baltic Porters...or maybe just more of this one."
"D: Watch out. This does not drink like an 8+% abv beer. It's sweet, it's creamy, it's big on flavor, and sneaks up on you. This is a really approachable, friendly, comforting beer. I'll be getting this again this winter for sure."
"D - Very good. It is the first and only (for now) Baltic Porter that I've sampled, but I'm impressed. Great sweet taste."
"Very creamy and balanced. Nice carbonation, medium bodied. Very drinkable for the high alcohol and robust flavor. I could see myself drinking alot of this if I lived in Poland."
"Overall impression: A wonderful porter. A world class beer. This would be a regular for me if I could find it around town. No alcoholic harshness at all despite the 8+% ABV. Strongly recommended."
"This is a particularly rich Baltic Porter. Very dark, dense, and well crafted."
"Good Baltic Porter, a style I like a lot. Not my favorite from what I've tried but well crafted. Very sweet and probably and ideal chocolate cake dessert beer."
"I wasn't quiet expecting the intensity, so I'm a bit ill prepared for the onslaught of flavour and alcohol in this. Next time I'll limber up beforehand with a Rochefort 10 or something."
"Wow - this is one spectacular beer. Not a session porter, but a good beer to finish a night off with. $2.99 for a 500ml?! What a steal!"
"Still a good brew."
"This brew is very complex in aroma and flavor. Rewarding. The alcohol is 8.3% ABV but it is very well hidden. I feel it but the ETOH smell and taste are barely noticeable. I would recommend this offering."
"Notes: What a great suprise and treat, It has been a while since I have been really happy with a non american beer, maybe just cause we get them so fresh over here.. I find a lot of the good over seas products to finish with that trash flavor that ruins an otherwise great beer, lots of the sammy smith products I purchase are just ruined, clear bottle, shipped stored.. and its a porter, AND I dont hate it, I even really like it.. top 10 or even 20, NO WAY, but its good, and different and I am happy. I would call it a must try it if you can beer. GOOD CALL!"
"Overall, I felt this was a very well-constructed and tasty brew"
"d - not very drinkable, more owing to the style than to the beer itself"
"D: Very tasty, not as filling as most beers in this genre and although there is some alcohol sting in the taste, it does not feel like it has an 8.30% ABV (as listed on the bottle). I had intended to drink this beer slowly thinking that it was a sipper, but I found myself drinking it very quickly."
"500mll brown bottle, no freshness indication offered.. Pours very dark honey amber/brown, with a dark tan head,showing decent retention,disolveing a nice looking tiny bubble film that leaves some blotchy scattered lacing. Nose is cola, smoke. Full flavor brew, notes of caramel, near burnt grains, dark berry jam, dark chocolate, smoke and perhaps some figs. Full bodied and revealing dense layers of dark malty goodness. Complex, flavorful brew. Bring on the beef stew, dark bread and sausages. NIce stuff"
"This is dangerously drinkable at over 8% ABV. This is definitely the best regular porter I have had so far. I look forward to having it again."
"D: This porter is a winner. Seriously delicious."
"Pours a deep dark brown that is nearly pitch black with a creamy tan head that sticks all over the glass. First time I held this up to my nose all I could say was WOW! Aroma is sweet roasted malt, caramel, chocolate and dark fruit. The taste is absolutely delicious! Starts out sweet and finishes roasty with many of the same flavors as in the nose. Mouthfeel is delightfully smooth and creamy. Overall, this is one hell of a fine brew that is definitely highly recommended to anyone who enjoys porters."
"D: A beer to savor and to seek out. Great alone or (I would think) paired with dessert, maybe even meat (BBQ?). I'll give it a strong recommendation."
"packs a wallop in both taste and strength. If you love malty, strong, sweet beer you can't go wrong with this one."
"I could drink this all night. It is the best beer I've ever had!!! As I mentioned above, this is the first perfect 5 rating I've ever given a beer, and this one truly deserves it. Wow! What a beer!!"
"Body is quite big, with a soft as velvet texture and creamy, slippery mouthfeel. Warming and dangerously drinkable. Seek one out!"
"Smooth and creamy, warm, roasted, and a little sweet. My fiance likes to microwave her soft-baked chocolate chunk dark chocolate brownies, and this strikes me as a similar experience. This beer is forcing me to eat, because the bottle says 8.3% alc./vol., and I need another one!"
"*Note: My bottle says 8.3%abv vs. the 8.1% on BA. A recipe alteration, perhaps?"
"Give me sinebrychoff any day."
"D = Very drinkable. Easilly drink two a night."
"Not a bad beer but not my favorite porter. I'll definitely have this one again."
"This beer poured a dark brown color, nearly black, with a 1 finger light tan head that hung around. Aroma was malty and chocolatey with hints of coffee. Taste was of espresso coffee, chocolate, ripe fruit and licorice. Hop bitterness was barely present. The finish was sweet with a pleasing alcoholic warmth at the end of each swallow. Mouthfeel was thick and creamy. Drinkability is good if you like a robust beer. This is damn good and not a beer for wimps. A wonderful example of the style and a bargain at $2.39 for a 16.9 ounce bottle."
"Aroma - 5; Appearance - 2; Flavor - 9; Mouthfeel - 4; OI - 7 (27/50)."
"i really enjoyed this beer, great porter, close to best of show for the tasting. then i started drinking the belgian beer. oppps."
"Good mouthfeel though, a bit thicker than other Baltic's I have had. Fairly creamy really. Okay drinkability in my book, this seems like a good beer but doesn't quite do it for me. It has some high points but the flavor doesn't suit me."
"This beer really improves as it warms. A cornucopia of flavors boarding on aged belgian dark ale but still completely retaining it's porter quality. Pretty damn good beer."
"Every bottle of this I've had show ABV at 8.3%"
"D: For an abv of eight and change this is one deceptively drinkable beer. I will happily finish this glass (quicker than I should for 8.3%). I can see this becoming an addiction..."
"As the Polish say.... NA ZDROWIE! (pronounced na-strovia, it means...here's to your health!)"
"This is a great porter overall. Almost kind of seems like an imperial once it's all said and done, and it is in the 8% range so watch out. But I thoroughly enjoyed it overall. Thanks to the wife for tipping me off on this one. She was right."
"Good thing I have located a source for this one in MA....it will be purchased many more times in the near future."
"Overall this is a winner. I am going to compare it to Heavyweight's Perkuno's Hammer because that was my favorite porter before this one. This one is as tasty an cheaper. Plus it isn't disappearing because Browar Okocim has definitely not gone out of business!"
"It is amazingly tasty and equally drinkable Id love to drink this on draft. What a great nightcap. I suppose this beer would work well with fresh fruit and creamy cheese. Id love to travel back in time and try this beer about ten years ago. I wonder how much better it was then. Maybe it is the same. I guess it really doesnt matter because this is one ass kicking beer! I purchased my bottle in Kansas City, MO. I hope to drink this again soon. Worthy of its praise, IMO."
"Purchased in a half-litre bottle for around $2. Poured a dark-brown color with a decent sized tan head. Little visibility and good lacing. Smell was very deep roast malt, accompanied by nut, chocolate, caramel and coffee. A good and complex aroma. The taste was mostly malty. Robust and sweet. A very rich, initial taste is followed by a nice sweetness--mostly chocolate--and coffeelike presence. Bold and flavorful. In the mouth Okocim Porter is full, carbonated and biting. As it warms the presence of alcohol is notable, but not overwhelming. Overall, this is a very good porter. More bitter than most, but quite tasty and impressive. Dangerously drinkable for such a potent and high abv brew."
"Very drinkable, but definitely a sipping, rather than quaffing, beer. The alcohol can sneak up on you. Not for the uninitiated."
"True classic!"
"This is everything a Baltic Porter should be. Complex, challenging, and inviting. Excellent drinkability as a sipper."
"Pitch black with muted brown around the edges, one finger, ugly, foaming, bubbly head. Aroma is mild, of faint alcohol given the 8.3%, light german hops and lager aromas, nothing too intense, good stuff here. Taste is true to style, and is german dopple/schwarz like; sweet caramel flavor mostly, with a distinct roasted malt note that is delayed and swells on the palate into the finish when the sweetness fades. Alcohol is there but not flashy. Hops are minimal in taste. Too sweet in the dopplebock way for me to really enjoy. Mouthfeel is full and creamy on the tounge, but on the medium-high side as for carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer, but for me, why bother, with other more flavorful options and styles, particularly less boozy ones? This is tame in taste, though good (that little roasted note saves it from being booring). Drinking this made me wonder if it is more highly rated due to it being fairly tame and for how well it hides it's dizzying alcohol content. This is just not for me."
"Maybe not as rich as it used to be, because we had no trouble pounding down a couple pints."
"Drinkability: This porter is quite drinkable, with the malts and yeast making for a smooth drink."
"Pours very dark maroon with ruby amber highlights. Creamy biege head of three fingers, good retention and a nice coating of sticky lace. Roasted and vinous aromas dominate the nose with english hops, soy sauce and chocolate malt in the background. Articial sweetener flavor upfront is probably the only flaw. Rich with malt flavor like crystal sweetness, roasted notes, faint coffee, and suspect stale dark malts. Drying herbal hop aftertaste balances the flavor very well and lifts some of the residual sweetness to form a marvelous execution of the style. Medium in body and a mid-level carbonation allow a creamy mouthfeel with ample crispness. Finishes sweet, but not cloying with a touch of dry fuggle hops and a trace of alcohol. Very drinkable considering the alcoholic strength and robust malt profile."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is very mellow and smooth. The beer is just shy of medium bodied. I wish the beer had been a bit fuller on the body. Perhaps a bit of oilyness on the mouthfeel would have improved the beer. The beer is a dam fine beer drink. This beer is extremly drinkable. It was a pleasure to smell and taste the beer. The alcohol is well covered up in the smell, taste and mouthfeel. If it wasnt for the buzzing warming alcohol I wouldnt know this was 8%. This beer should be lightly chilled for best drinking. I will buy this beer any time I see it."
"500 ml bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Very dark rich brown color, completely opaque. Only a slight glint of light comes through as a mahogany speck when held to the light. The head is a rich creamy mocha color about a fingers width.It maintains a good lace. Smell is quite intense with roasted malt, fig, and licorice well blended. Taste follows up the smell accurately. Moderately sweet with an unusual bitterness. I am used to American porters that can have a coffee or chocolate taste. This is quite different and pleasant. Licorice seems to be dominant, but there are some other floral and herbal notes. Mouthfeel is very full and creamy. This is a very pleasant porter, and a real value too. I am able to get these for less than $2, seems a bit of a steal. I will definately be getting this again. Major improvement over Okocim Beer."
"A well-done, robust, dominating porter. One or two would be it for me, but I think that's how its meant to be with this one."
"Great beer. Recommended."
"Slick mouthfeel. Carbonation not evident in the mouth, the it is there. Drinkable, but served best as an after-dinner dessert beer. The alcohol can creep up on you. I like Sinebrychoff a bit better, but this is still very good. Bigger serving size!"
"I won't pass up the opportunity to drink again, but I'd save it for the Fall/Winter nights when I'd be more in the mood for this style. Would be great with a cigar too."
"Taste: Oh! It's been years since I've had one of these, and I remember liking it well, but this particular character disappeared from my cognizance. Amazing stuff! Tastes like an Imperial Stout in many ways, so thick, rich, roasted, toasted and buzzing with dark, delicious flavor. Sits very hard upon the palate, becomes firmly ensconced in the senses. Some hoppiness at first, but afterwards dominated by sweet, raisiny, rummy maltiness and the definite feel of alcohol (a mere 8.1 %, this)."
"I'll recommend this to everyone. It was pretty cheap but apparently not widely distributed. Now that I can recognize the bottle I'll be looking for it."
"Mouthfeel- A nice silky profile coats the tongue nicely and went very well with my IKEA Swedish meatballs with a lemon pepper salal dressing. This beer has rich flavors but allows them to be washed away to be enjoyed with other flavors on the palate."
"Very drinkable."
"Has a beautiful chocolate color with an awsome tan head. Smell of Nuts, chocolate, and fig are present. Has a very smooth cahracter when you taste it. Seems to age pretty well. My dad and I had a bottle that was a year old and it was excellent. 8.1% ABV is nice and it finishes well. Awsome job Poland."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Will certainly buy this again. Okocim definitely stands out among most European Baltic/Imperial porters as a one-of-a-kind. But probably wont be drinking too many of these over the summer."
"500 mL bottle, 8.3 % abv. Pours a deep mahogany color, with russet highlights and a dense beige head. Nose is an over-the-top vinous affair with dark fruits like plums, Bing cherries, and prunes reconstituted with Port. A roasted chocolate aroma is detectable as well. Big flavors of cherries and plums with a mineral twinge at the finish. Sweet dark fruits linger in the aftertaste. Molasses and currants. Some roasted malt bitterness provides a subtle bulwark against over-sweetness. Aside from the mouthfeel, which is certainly full for a porter but overall closer to medium-bodied and quite smooth with some very slight alcohol warming, Okocim Porter reminds me quite a lot of a Russian Imperial Stout (although I like my stouts to lean more toward the roasty side of things rather than darkly sweet). Not sure when this one was brewed/bottled, but I believe I prefer Baltic Porters with a bit of age on them. Overall, a very nice example of the style, but not quite my favorite."
"rich, sweet, and raisiny taste. finishes like a sweet port or sherry. rich, velvety mouthfeel despite a medium-high, prickly carbonation. a damn good beer."
"A very complex beer that saves European Porters from the dismal abyss of American Marcos."
"D - Goes in and down very easily, warranted though a 16.9oz bottle at 8.3% has the ability to sneak up on you. Hindsight is 20/20 however, when a beer, much less a porter, is this easy to drink."
"A completely enjoyable beer is about all you really have to say about this one. It is very highly rated for good reason. The only reason you might not like this one is that is on the sweet side, if you hate sweeter beers then this probably isn't something you will like."
"Because of the sweetness, it would be very difficult to have more than one bottle. Hence, the drinkability suffers. However, it still stands as a very unique and delicious porter."
"Pours a nearly opaque black with a slight tan head. The aroma has notes of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, molasses and alcohol. The flavor starts off with milk chocolate, roasted malt, molasses, toasted bread and alcohol. The mouthfeel is light, but appropriate for the style and drinkability is good. An enjoyable baltic porter, but seems one dimensional to me."
"I found this to be very drinkable and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this. Not that I didn't expect to enjoy it but I enjoyed it very much"
"Very, very good porter. Probably the best that I have had to date."
"Perfect dark mahogany body, plenty of bubbly, huge, frothy tan head. Retention is good with a medium ring. Vinous aromas of burnt fig, prunes, raisons, nuts, licorice, and mocha coffee. Warming alcohol borders on intrusive. I would say one needs to be in the mood for strength to enjoy this one. The 8.1% is only partially covered. Flavors are all burnt fruit with an almost peaty, Scotch Ale like sensation. Drinkable considering the strength and very affordable."
"D: I wish that I had had this beer before reviewing the other Baltic porters under my belt so far, as it seems that this could be the standard. A bit to sweet for this to be a session beer or one that I would like to drink regularly, but at $1.82 a bottle, this is a fantastic beer."
"D - Too sweet to be excellent in the drinkability category. Definately not a session beer."
"This stuff has changed since my last review.. Still pours a brown-ruby hue with a lasting tan head. The aroma is great: coffee, chocolate, notable bright hops, burned toast. This stuff is pretty sweet in the mouth, but is otherwise well balanced with hops and thick coffee. Rich chocolate, caramel also noted in the flavor. The alcohol comes through more towards the end."
"This is an extremely smooth and delicious brew. I am a big fan of Zywiec Porter, and this is similar, but not as harsh. It pours a very darka amber with a pillow head and very nice lacing. The smell is sweet, malty, with hop undertones. You can note the smoothness that is to follow. The taste maintains a maltiness throughout, with a hint of hops underneath to provide a nice balance. Mouthfeel is smooth, almost creamy. This brew is best in teh drinkability area. It is smoooth. The 8.1 abv doesn't get up and hit you either. Outstanding. A must try for Baltic Porter fans."
"Nearly opaque black color, with a white and quickly diminishing white head. Moderate burnt currant and roast aroma with a light hint of smoke and coffee. I found the flavor overwhelmingly cloying and I usually dont enjoy a lot of hop flavor and aroma in stouts/porters, but the additions here could have been more substancial. I found it pretty timid overall, with a fairly light body and light raisin, coffee, roast flavors. Not really enjoyable and a bit hard to finish."
"I really like sweet beers, but this is over the top with sugar."
"Half liter bottle list as 8.3% ABV. Pours a deep cola color with a light brown colored head. Nice lacing and stickage. Aromas of caramel malts, light toffee, raisin, cocoa, hearty bread and a slight hint of star anise. Solid baltic porter qualities all around. Roasty, hearty, chewy, a touch sweet but has a decent dryness in the finish that keeps it nice and easy-drinking. Slick on the tongue. Hopping is mild, as with a lot of Polish beer. They like the low alpha hops. Good beer."
"The smell is amazing! Chocolate, dark malt, maple syrup, caramel, and all kinds of other gewy substances. Poured a nice solid dark cream colored head that held strong, and as time went on reminded me of nitro stouts. Opaque black beer with a faint copper hue around the edges left sheets of lace as it was consumed. Soft, creamy mouthfeel smothers my tongue with flavor. Charred malt up front. Creamy flavors (vanilla?) mix with cocoa in the middle. There was a slight metallic flavor at first, but after a few sips it's gone. The sweetness really kicks in towards the end and holds well into the finish allowed in a faint bitterness. An amazing beer in many aspects, but it tastes a little too sweet for me. I would definitely recommend this beer to anyone interested."
"This dark brown, nearly black liquid has a beautiful reddish hue and a creamy, dense head. What an aroma! Lots of highly roasted malt. Theres a solid black-patent smell thats the centerpiece of the nose, surrounded by coffee and chocolate aromas, sweet-smelling malt, and a fleeting fruitiness. The taste is first classa lot of burnt and roasted character, with a nice hop flavor. Its a little drier than the aroma lets on, but its full and very creamy. I love the complexity of the specialty grains in this one. Again, its full and satisfying. Moderately low carbonation. Hides its ABV very well. Simply solid and very enjoyable!"
"Notes: My first Baltic Porter, and wow. This would be a great end to a meal or any night. Delicious beer."
"BTW, this beer's website is extremely interactive. You should go there!"
"Drinkability- This beer was truly a pleasure to drink. I love how the taste goes from a nice bitterness to a full on sugary and creamy chocolate taste and then fills your mouth with espesso. This beer is truly amazing. Had a real hard time not giving this ones 5's across the board. Highest recommendation here."
"This beer pours a dark brown almost black with ruby highlights and a thick tan head from a half liter brown bottle. Aroma at first seemed a bit estery, now it is more like molasses. Flavor definitely has roasted malt, chocolate is a minor note, a hint of sawdust (if that makes any sense?). This is definitely an interesting interpretation of the style, well worth trying, definitely recommended."
"thanks to BigErn for the trade."
"Fairly dark black in color, the light only creates slight red hues around the edges. A short tan head covers the top like a crust, and it dissipates fairly quickly. Smell is not particularly strong, but yields hints of a nutty, chocolate aroma. Taste starts out a bit hoppy/spicy, and becomes very sweet, a very strong chocolatey flavor. Not as bitter as some porters. The alcohol doesn't taste as strong as it is labeled. The mouthfeel is great: thick, perfect carbonation, coats well. I enjoyed this brew immensely. It might be just a tad too sweet to be perfect, but its still a great flavor. I recommend it..."
"Hopefully some of my local shops will pick this up. I liiike."
"D - Well, I can't session it and it is too sweet for food. I'm not going to hunt it down in the future either. Finishing one is not difficult, but it is a bit of a chore with the blood and drying character. I guess that it is sub par in this category."
"I heard a rumour (true or not?) that the LCBO in Ontario will no longer be stocking this, so I went and bought a bunch more. While I was there, some other guy was clearing out the entire stock! Guess I'm not the only paranoid one..."
"Edit: May 29, 2006: I had to give 1 of my 2 remaining bottles a try and I have to say the flavour has evolved enough to make a difference. I note a more sweetish malt with anise tones and the body is bordering on syrupy...aging is doing fine so I'll keep my last bottle for say, the end of the year."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" brown head over the barely translucent dark brown with burgundy highlights brew. Frothy head lasts well, with ample dark lacing. Aroma is hearty sweet dark grains, with hints of alcohol. Taste is the ideal combination of dark malt sweetness and seductive alcohol. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and drinkability is also very nice. This one has been worth the wait to find, hopefully I'll be revisiting it soon."
"Rich raisin and chocolate aroma dominate. Deep black in color with a beautiful three finger thick mocha head. Lots of roasted malt, raisin and chocolate through all flavor ranges. Pleasing creamy mouthfeel. Good lacing and the carbonation level is spot on. Excellent brew."
"Really easy drinking in spite of the 8% ABV. This rivals Storm King for a dark sipping brew."
"I would love to do a side-by-side comparison with Sinebrychoff Porter. Even without doing so, it's obvious that this beer is at least that beer's equal. Okocim Porter is world-class and was a pleasure to consume. One of the greats, without question."
"This survived the crossing and thrived at $2.20 a bottle I'll be hoarding. Super drinkable for its strength. This was the closet I've came to giving as a BA, nuff said"
"In comparision to the Sinebrychoff, I much prefer this one. It may be have a little more alcohol, but I find it MUCH more drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is wonderful...rich, creamy and chewy. This does not fail to please, spot on for a porter in my mind. The 500ml bottle disappears almost as quickly as it's poured into my glass. Dangerously drinkable at 8.3%. This one is well worth exploring...I'm interested to see how the other 3 bottles I have do with some aging! Thank you Okocim for bringing this one back to the states."
"Poured into 1.5 liter stein a real dar brown only reddish light shown thru when held up to the light with light brown 1 finger head atop.A malt aroma wise french roast coffee and unsweetened bitter chocolate dominate with a touch of alcohol but not strong,flavors start out somewhat sweet caramel and bitter chocolate upfront with a very nice drying earthy slightly medicinal finish.A Polish beer worthy of high status complex and flavorful it might go well with my moms duck soup."
"An absolutely stellar beer, even more so during the cold Chicago winter."
"Thanks to LuckySevens82 for the 500 mL bottle."
"I kinda expected this beer to be in your face and slightly crude but instead this is one of the most refined big porters I have tasted. Black as night with a roasty coffee nose, the first taste is almost underwhelming in its approach. The cool thing is that the coffee and complex malt notes build up on the finish until you sense the lurking bigness of this beer. Very good, very refined and way too drinkable."
"I could easily have a couple of these. This was one of the beers that proved to me that I could like Porters. I now buy this once or twice a month. I can now thank Poland for something other than Pierogies."
"Taste; roasted malts, coffee and chocolate stand out at first, followed dark dark fruits (plums or raisins) along with just a hint of toffee. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and smooth, and it gets slightly richer as it gets warmer. This is one hell of good porter."
"Same luxurious rich chocolate body and the same great mellow drinkability that made this porter famous in Europe."
"I will be partaking again."
"Highly quaffable, especially for an 8%+ brew.... the only reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because of its sweetness. Nevertheless, far and away the best beer from this brewery, and an extremely solid example of the style."
"Overall, this is an absolutely wonderful brew i would recommend to pretty much everybody."
"I'm glad it's back."
"Another big thanks to northyorksammy for the trade!"
"This brew pours a solid, opaque black color. the head is large, fluffy, tan, and dissipates slowly leaving good lacing. The aroma is of cream, butter, toffee, with roasted malt lying underneath. The taste is of toffee and cream with burnt malt. The mouthfeel is slightly thincker than medium bodied, with low carbonation. Overall, this is a very good beer; difinately something to keep you warm on a winters night."
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black porter with a medium dark head with pretty good retention. Aroma of rich chocolate with some roasted malt. Taste is sweeter then I remembered (I had this last time about 7-8 years ago) with lots of chocolate flavour. Very little bitterness or hops are noticeable and alcohol is well hidden. Rich creamy body make this quite enjoyable overall."
"Drinkability: Absolutely wonderful with none of the phenolic off flavors I sometimes get with other Baltic porters"
"The lactose leaves a sweet film on your mouth, and the hops a slight prickliness. A hearty beer, for sure. Great with charred meat on a cold day."
"Wow. This is good stuff. Pours an inky black into my pint glass, and good lacing with a tightly compacted head. Aroma is slight cocoa with more coffee tones going on. Taste is sweetened coffee predominately, but wtih some chocolate notes included. Mouthfeel could stand to be thicker and less carbonated. This is a great beer, and one of the best I've had in a long time."
"Pours a thick dark brown/black with a couple fingers of coffee brown head and big black chunks of yeast settled at the bottom. Nose is robust with toasty barley malts, rich coffee, creamy dark chocolate and hints of anise and ripe dark fruit puree. Taste reminded me of a refined cross between the Baltika 6 Porter and Black Boss Porter - taking the grainy barley malts of the former and the prune, raisin, fig, and anise of the latter with a hearty smattering of chocolatey coffee. Mouthfeel is thick and gets chunky with the last few sips. This was a tasty baltic porter, up there with the Sinebrychoff."
"16.9 ounce bottle at The Brickskeller in DC. Bottle said 8.35% ABV."
"Overall, an exceptional beer. Well worth the hype that this one gets. I need to make my way back to the store for more."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability were both high. It was sugary sweet, smoky, and bitter all at the same time. Additionally, you had an oily texture that went smooth and quick with a tingly carbonation. One of the few beers Ive had lately that lived up to the preceding hype."
"The mouthfeel is very viscous and oily with a big body, and as I mentioned earlier, a brilliant sweetness. Not too overwhelming, but the alcohol can be detected through a dryness over the tongue. No noticeable hop bitterness or flavor. Very highly drinkable for such a robust, high proof beer."
"Note: my bottle said 8.3 ABV"
"Drinkability and Overall: An excellent Baltic Porter. The balance is untouchable, and while it tastes fabulous, I don't know how many more I could have of these. Either way, this one is quite hyped, and it's worth it."
"It was good to find this beer on the shelf again in time for winter."
"The taste was a rush of flavors very sweet with a hint of chocolate in there. Very sweet malt flavors and a tartness as well possible coffee taste to. It was for sure smokey in the aftertaste and slightly tart/sour. A nice dry finish with a lingering sweet tounge. A very creamy smooth and full flavored beer."
"The milky foam of a porter over a chocolate body is always pleasing. This brew had a sizeable head, but it dissipated in under a minute. The odor promised chocolate, with some fruitiness, and alcohol. Yep. The label of my 500 mL bottle says 8.3 % abv. There is alcohol in there. The butterscotchy sweet taste was a little overwhleming, but there were moments where I got chocolate liquor. There was little bitterness, and the last taste I detected was the alcohol. The beer had a nice body to it -- creamy velvet in the mouth. Because of the sweetness, I'm having a tough time finishing this 500 mL. I like sweet beers, but this one is unbalanced in some way. I wouldn't kick it out of my fridge, but if I were given the choice, I'd pick another porter (probably Anchor)."
"Dark reddish brown with a light brown head that left lace along the sides of the glass. Dense malt aroma, the smell of toasted base malt is intense, giving the porter a scent reminiscent of barley wine. There is an underlying blanket of roasted malt there too, like mild coffee and dark chocolate. The flavor is sweet malt and roasted malt with balance coming from the black malt bitterness. This beer doesnt give any hint of 8%. The sweetness in the flavor gives plenty of body, but the density of the flavor goes beyond that with a nice lingering roasted chocolate flavor. This is my first true Baltic Porter, but it will bring me back for more that is sure. An excellent beer."
"Highly Recommended!"
"Pours with a frothy light brown head that sits atop an opaque black beer, that shows a brilliantly clear brown when tipped and put up to the light. The aroma is concentrated and malty with notes of alcohol, espresso, concentrated malt extract, dark chocolate, and burnt raisins. The beer is quite sweet up front with a burnt roasted note throughout as well. The roast flavors dont quite balance the initial sweetness though. In some ways it tastes like an over-sweetened cup of espresso, lots of sugar and bitter burnt flavors. It is still tasty, just not as well balanced as I would hope. What is lacking here is a thicker body, this is fairly thin for the style, and with the sweetness verges on becoming a bit cloyingly thin. What has happened to this beer?"
"By the way, Okocim has absolutely the coolest website of any brewery Ive ever seen. Check it out."
"From a 500 ml bottle. Dark cola brown, near black with a dense head of chocolate like black foam. Aromas are all dark roasted patent malts, a bit of chocolate, coffee, and caramel, and some nice hops in the mix as well. Taste is roasty, with chocolate and coffee notes as well as some greenish hops and some nice caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite nice. Drinkability is damn good. I'm glad this is back, makes me proud to be Polish, and at $2 a 500ml bottle this is a bargain as well!"
"The drinkablity of this stuff is excellent. The alcohol is very well hidden and the taste keeps you coming back for more."
"Other than those little complaints, very nice."
"Baltic Porters always give interesting and unexpected flavors. This one is no different. Looks similar to all other Porters. Basicly black with tan at the edges. Smells sweet and malty, nearly molassas. Not as much sour aromas. Flavors open up with bold sweetness. Grape Kool-aid, chocolate, barley, light coffee, toffee, and a hint of soy sauce. A little acidic. Weighs heavy on the toung. Goes down smoothly and sweetly. Sticks with you for quite a while."
"The body is moderate and very smooth, perfect for style. Maybe a touch astringent for me but still a classic example. Well done."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby hues when held to light. A finger of head falls to a moderate covering over top. Nose is very nice, with light notes of dark fruits and a sweet chocolate and roasted base playing underneath it. As good as I remember it being. The flavor is right there with the aroma. The chocolate is imediate, followed quickly with a light roasted coffee and fig. The flavors are very tasty, but very smooth and not offensive at all. The feel is very smooth and creamy, with a moderate body. Just awesome. No hint anywhere of over 8% ABV. Incredibly good all around. By far one of the best robust porters around. Very happy it is back on the shelves."
"Not a bad porter at all, just not the Valhalla-in-a-glass I had heard it was. Not bad for the price, as most Baltic porters around here tend to be a little more expensive. A very good beer, not a great one."
"Dark brown and nearly opaque, but still clear. Ruby red when held up to the light. Thick lacing and the light brown head sticks around for a long time. The roasted aroma is just short of coffee and there's plenty of malt and bitter chocolate. Moderate cherry fruitiness and light alcohol as well. Low bitterness compared to the sweet and roasty malt. Cherry flavour is light and seems to turn a bit acidic at the finish. Chocolatey middle with some anise. Very nice. Full body with lower carbonation gives is a creamy chewiness. Quite viscous. Slightly slick and oily with some alcohol tingle and warmth. I've been waiting for this one for a while now and it didn't disappoint. Very distinctive. Thanks Viggo."
"Pours a very opaque dark brown, nice and clear, some orange around the edges, big creamy tan head, lots of lacing. Smell is a lot of roast, cherries, chocolate, sweetness, molasses and alcohol. Taste is bitter chocolate, roast coffee, cherry middle, dry roasted finish. Mouthfeel is very full, really coats the mouth, nice alcohol warming, low carbonation. Excellent beer."
"incredibly drinkable, smooth, rich, deep reddish brown. Well carbonated to tongue tingle and fresh. Intense flavour with chocalatey, bourbon, secondary brown sugar and date, on sweet side but not cloying. Satisfying. Stouty and alcohol in nose. Will have again."
"First, this is totally creamy. That meringue coats the mouth like a milkshake. Picture raspberry sauce over a burnt chocolate pudding. For garnish there's a single long strand of curly lemon zest. This is an impeccable beer. It's so soft you could use it as a pillow, and it's got a perfect acidity to inspire interesting dreams. I suggest you pick up a bunch of these very reasonably priced beers so you can sleep fitfully tonight."
"I found this to be a very good, if somewhat sweet baltic porter. Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle. Chocolate complexion, decent bubbly head. Aromas are sweet, chocolatey. Taste is definitely on the sweeter side, with chocolate, coffee, some fruits present. Nice malt profile. It lacks any bittering effect though to counter the sweetness which reduces its drinkability. I prefer Boom or Alderis to this one, but still a nice example and worth trying."
"Bubbles tingle the front of the tongue and sparkle down the sides. Mouthfeel is creamy upfront, and becomes more viscous and flows through the mouth. Very drinkable. Awesome beer. Thanks to cvschaller for sending this one along, I can only hope that I sufficiently returned the favor."
"Poured a dark brown, reddish color with a large light tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. Roasted malt, mocha, and milk chocolate aroma. Taste was that of chocolate, coffee, and toffee, some roasted malt, and light alcohol in the finish. Thanks EDA!"
"Great porter, this. Goes down like warm chocolate."
"Deep and clear brown color with a thick clumpy tan head. The clumps cling to the side of the glass in a thick lace. Wonderful chocolate nose. It doesnt have the chocolate cherry of a double stout, but it is close. The finish has a little espresso, and just a hint of orange. Nice mixture of chocolate, brandy, cherries, and espresso in the flavor. Definitive alcohol warming, but the chocolate stays true throughout the drink. Smooth, slick mouth feel leads to a high drinakbility. Amazing porter, one of the best."
"I will leave this one to the heavyweights."
"Overall, the variety of chocolate characteristics are astounding (more dimensions than I described here) and they blend very well with the other flavors. This beer was quite tasty, but doesn't have many dimensions other than chocolate. I think this beer will age really well and plan to pick up a case of this original re-release for the long haul."
"The mouthfeel is just a little bit scratchy at first, but it mellows just before swallowing. Not a great session brew, but there's enough flavor and complexity to make for a good sipper."
"Drinkability is excellent on this beer, I couldn't beleive it was as strong as it was labeled, never tasted hot or alcoholy at all."
"Pours a dark black/brown color with ruby red highlights when held to the light. Clear. Little brown/tan head with medium bubbles. Smell is of roasted malt balanced by caramel sweetness. Nice mouth feel. Not too thin, but not too heavy. Cant quite place the flavor, but the roasted malts really come through in the finish. As I drink and the beer warms, the flavor changes a bit. I couldnt place the flavor at first because it is such a perfect blend of flavors that no one flavor really stands out to me. Some coffee nutty malty brown sugar plays great together. Defiantly a world class porter. Perfect for sitting by the fire on a cold winter night, although I also enjoyed it on a 90 degree summer afternoon!"
"Drinkability  Ive had some killer Porters over the years, but I just cant remember having one this refined and so well put together. You almost need to create a whole new category for this one."
"D- This beer is complex yet has a clean lager character to it. Very nice beer and it will be great on a cold winter night. I would like to see a bit more malt and a bit less sweetness over all. But this is a wonderful beer and I can see why it is a gold metal beer."
"Na zdrowie!"
"For 8.1% this beer is fairly easy to drink, would definitely enjoy quaffing another if given the opportunity!"
"Thanks, fmonk!"
"Thanks to faernt (Chip) for the generous gift!"
"Oh man, what a brew. Half a liter bottle poured into a thistle glass. It pours a jet black color with three fingers of medium tan foam. There is a great deal of lacing on the glass. It smells like malted milk balls with a hint of alcohol and a bit of raisins as well. A great aroma that fills the nose well. The taste has lots of complex dark fruity characters, including dates and raisins. Just the slightest dose of alcohol on the finish, just to keep you in check. The mouthfeel is exceptionally thick and coats the tongue well. The drinkability is awesome for an 8% brew. Brewdlyhooked13, thank you so much for this awesome and rare treat!!!"
"Budgood1...you're the man for sharing this incredible beer...thanks a billion..."
"Drinkability - a great beer. I have only one more and if it was cold it'd be in serious jeopardy. 'nuff said..."
"Recently finished my last one and feeling a bit melancholy. The aromas and tastes in this black beauty are so complex, yet they deliver a simple drinking pleasure. Figs, chocolate, biscuits, soy sauce and sherry dominate the palette. Highly drinkable for 8%. I want more!"
"The quintessential porter color an occluded brown to black with a rich and full chocolate head with the resultant lace a glutinous curtain to drape the glass. Rich roasted grain aroma with a sweet and fresh malt under pinning all combined with hints of coffee and chocolate, start is ambrosial and the top thick and rich in its feel on the palate. Finish is spirited in its spiciness, pleasantly carbonated, bittersweet chocolate aftertaste with a hint of alcohol bitterness to cap it off. As far as Im concerned the best Baltic Porter on the market today, sad to say no longer available here."
"pours out an opaque dark brown color, a thick and luscious tan head, leaving thick rings of lace. aroma is absolutely decadent; almost winey...chock full of rich, thick, darkened and ripened fruitiness...molasses, raisins, prunes, coffee, chocolate covered cherries, brandy, dark rum. tastes so much of a boozy and fruit dark malted milk concoction. quite yeasty, too. imperial in so many ways...very rich, with definite alcohol and roasted tones with bitter notes. a perfect dessert beer, nightcap, or apertif before eating. a treat no matter when you might one. this is such a good brew. lots of gooey booziness to boot. one of the absolute best brews i have ever tasted. good thing i snagged a handfull of these."
"This one pours a dark dark brown color with a small head that left a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was very strong - chocolates, coffee, and some other stuff that I didn't care much for - still decent and very complex. Not being a fan of the average porter taste, I didn't get too much enjoyment out of this one. I'll give it plenty of credit for being very complex and interesting, but the taste was just not to my liking. It tastes like an imperial stout mixed with a porter mixed with rum(?). The alcohol is present in the taste and has a lot of roastedness in the taste."
"Poured from a stout-looking 16.9 oz bottle with a goat on the label, it pours a deep, dark brown that shows a little garnet when held up to the light. The smell is just amazing, with notes of chocolate, coffee, ripe fruit, molasses, and traces of caramel. A torrent of flavors are also present. In addition to those found in the smell, the taste tingles the tongue with just a slight medicinal taste that only makes the whole thing more enjoyable. It's belly-warming, but the alcohol is well hidden The mouthfeel is creamy and almost encourages use of a spoon. It's no session beer, but it's very drinkable for the style and abv. It doesn't quite match Carnegie Stark Porter, but it's not far off."
"Well, I was lucky to find a couple of these (I only had two, I'll wait for a special occasion to drink the last one). Pretty much lived up to the expectation. Kind of an ""Imperial Porter"". Strong, full-bodied. Extremely well balanced. Some bitterness to go with the chocolate flavors. Really a stout, IMO. Fits right in with the better stouts, porters, and doppels. Excellent all around beer. Hides the alcohol very well. Ordinary appearance, and maybe just a tad on the bitter side. If I could get it regularly, I certainly would. Why D/C such an excellent beer? (the best baltic beer I've ever had)."
"Notes: Sharing is for the weak. If you find this beer, take it from Mustard: horde it like the greedy pig that you are. The best porter I have ever had, by far."
"Many thanks to cokes for this extra gift in our trade."
"Pours black ruby in color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that sticks to the sides of the glass as it recedes. Nose is very reminiscent of Kahlua and crème de cacao. This is a full-bodied brew and is oh so very smooth and creamy in the mouth. Taste is rich dark malts, lots of chocolate syrup, and dark fruits followed by some notes of chocolate coffee liqueur and noticeable warming alcohol. An excellent choice for a nightcap, and once this gets 30 reviews, its sure to make the Top 50 List. Purchased from Liquid Solutions."
"I remember hearing that this beer was not being brewed anymore. If that's true, it's a sad day for beer lovers everywhere..."
"I have found the beer of the Gods and its Baltic Porters..beautiful"
"Well well, what do we have here? Answer: another exceptional Baltic/Imperial style porter. Incredible depth of aroma and flavor. The black and chocolate malt, ripe dark fruit - plum, prune, raisin must be slowly savoured. Rich, full bodied. Semi-sweet with the strength of 8+% abv to balance things out. Sit back, relax, look, smell, taste...repeat. Outstanding."
"The tan dense head settles into a thin uniform layer that leaves sparse lace.  Deep ruby hue when held to light exhibiting excellent clarity.  Assertive caramelized sugar, deeply roasted malt, dark toffee in aroma w/ a candied fruitiness emerging at the end. As the beer warms, a touch of heaty fusel alcohols add additional complexity.  The flavor is dominated by tremendously smooth and rich dark coffee and chocolate-- there isn't the slightest hint of astringency to be found. The date - like malt sweetness overpowers the understated hop bitterness and is thus quite high, but isn't cloying. Full bodied but not overly rich. The finish is sweet, lightly roasty and a touch fruity.  This is one tremendously flavorful brew-- the myriad of flavors hide the high relative alcohol content.  Delicious."
"Consider me a convert to the church of the Baltic Porter...this is gooooooood stuff."
"An absolute classic. I've been intrigued by the Baltic porter category for some time, and am truly glad I am getting the chance to finally try one. It's hard to rate this beer against other Baltic porters (since this is the first I've tried), but that hardly matters; this is a terrific beer regardless of category. Almost pitch black, though if you look closely through the light a beautiful ruby glint will come through. Huge rocky dark tan head that reduces, but doesn't quite disappear. It's got aromas somewhere between an imperial stout and a sweet barleywine (not like Bigfoot, more like Victory's Old Horizontal; then imagine it combined with Storm King). Tastes of slightly burnt raisins and prunes, with a bit of licorice and (maybe?) a touch of chocolately sweetness. Nice alcohol burn in the finish; not too strong, but definitely there. Whoa baby, this is a treat, and I like it."
"My first and definately not last Baltic Porter.  Drinks much like an imperial stout, as it should.  Great nightcap beer."
"I had earlier rated this beer pretty as being pretty poor, but wondered if I had gotten a bad bottle, given other BeerAdvocate's favorable opinions.  Consequently, I decided to give it another chance.  Glad I did, and I do believe there must have been a problem with the last bottle, which I described as tasting like Sam Adams Tripple Bock gone bad.  On second try, this beer has a very nice burned prune character and a solid alcohol punch.  Lots of depth of flavor."
"Brent from Kentucky is dead wrong. He must have gotten a bad bottle or he is not familiar with the Baltic Porter style. These porters are strong (Okicim being at 8.1%) with an aggressive (sometimes sweet) roasted malt profile. Okicim is a fine example of the style not as sweet as Dojidily (sp) and not as aggressive on the roastyness as say Sinebrychoff. If you like a nice aggressive porter definitely give Okocim"
