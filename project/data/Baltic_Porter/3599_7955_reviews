"Very dark brown, almost black when poured. Low creamy head that dissipates quickly. Decent smell, though not strong. Delicious tasting porter; full of flavor. Nice rich taste with flavors of chocolate and coffee, slightly smoky. I enjoyed the beer a lot; though I did not find myself craving another immediately - probably because I found this beer filling. Medium to heavy body; slightly grainy."

"O: an excellent porter."

"Poured into a pint glass. The beer pours really dark brown to black with a thin, light tan head and some visible rising bubbles along the side of the glass. The aroma is of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and dark roasted malt. The taste follows the nose. There's some rich bittersweet chocolate and coffee with vanilla and dark roasted malt. It's straightforward and delicious. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry and the beer goes down smoothly. This is an excellent beer."

"O - Overall, between the over carbonation and the metallic this just didn't do it for me. Least favourite Baird beer."
"Overall - Quite surprised with this one. I've had a few of the Japanese craft brews from Hitachino Nest and was very impressed, and so far Baird seems to be an excellent brewery as well. One thing I enjoy about the Japanese renditions on porter/stouts is that they don't over do anything...just a nice complimentary blend of flavors whereas some american stouts tend to be uneven and/or too heavily hopped"

"Wouldn't say this was necessarily a top ten favorite, but definitely wasn't bad. I had a delightful time being surprised with the complex olfactory/flavor journey on which it took me! Wouldn't mind drinking again, but probably won't go hunting for it."
""
"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with a half finger, fine tan head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit and a hint of cherry. Flavor of toasted malt, coffee, chocolate, sweet fruit, slight cherry and finishes with mild hops, coffee and fruit juice. Medium bodied. Sweeter and with more fruit flavor than most porters, the flavors are well integrated and very tasty. This is a well made, different and flavorful porter. Nice."
""
"Compared to most porters, this smoother, sweeter, and fruitier taste is sometimes attributed to lager-like conditions in the cold Baltic regions. This keeps the beer tamer in taste despite its uptick in strength."
""
""
"Appearance is very dark brown to almost black in color. The only real ding I have for this brewery is the carbonation is fairly light and disappates somewhat quickly - likely due to the water. Smell is of coffee and mild cocoa - sweet aroma. Flavor is more of the same with lots of malt balance. Slight bitterness likely from the hops on the back end but the star is the up front malting."

"Thanks, Brian. This beer didn't disappoint. It has that coastal city/port ocean water vibe with a semi-fruity character that makes it a nice rainy weather beer. Doubtedly so, but if I ever saw it on a shelf again, I might pick it up--or give one of their other offerings a try."
"Overall it's a little non-matching from the nose, but it's kind of an interesting porter to be drinking, and certainly doesn't taste like any other baltic porter I've had before, I could have this again."
"worth a shot for sure, I've had some pretty decent brews from Japan and a range of styles many wouldn't guess, this is not your standard rice lager"
"O: This beer has some nice flavors of roasted malts but seems to be a bit too over carbonated and lighter-bodied compared to other Baltic Porters."

"Had a pint of this on tap at the Baird Beer Harajuku Taproom. A squid-ink black porter with a beautiful cocoa head that coats the glass in a nice lacing. A bit thin on the aroma, but still wonderful dark notes of chocolate and roasted almonds. Nice and thick mouthfeel in the way a good porter should be. Overall, I would recommend this as a great after-dinner drink or even with a nice lamb/red meat dish."
"O - This is my first Baird beer that isn't part of some collaboration, and I was expecting a little more (especially at $5 for a 12oz bottle). It looks great but there's just not much in aroma, taste or mouthfeel."
"A 6% abv is low for the style, but that being the case it makes it easy to down 2 or 3 at a session. Oh wait, $4.99 for one bottle! I think I'll stop at one. It's good, but not THAT good."
"O: This was an alright Baltic porter. The metallic taste did bother me. Overall, I liked the Flying Dog Gonzo better."

"T: I really liked this one. Roasted malt, toffee, espresso, and some hints of dark fruit. A really nice baltic porter."
"The rich, syrupy nose is bigger than the taste, which has a lot of the molasses in there but isn't too sweet overall. Medium bitterness, just really trace amounts of roast, coffee, alcohol. Ultimately a bit shallow, like the mouthfeel, which is thin but a touch sticky. Fades a bit quickly from the palette, and from the memory, unfortunately."
"Not very long, but pleasant, with ligh burnt and toasted notes."
"12oz bottle. Pours a dark brown with a chill haze, khaki colored head. Aroma of roasted malts primarily. In the taste, a nice mellow roast, faint chocolate and a complimentary presence of tea like hops tasting pretty fresh for a bottle coming from the foot of Mt.Fuji. Roasted malt, sweet grain and a mild hop flavor, without much alcohol showing. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, somewhat smooth, but surprisingly light. Overall, a pretty well done porter, one of the better beers I've had from Japan."
"Overall: Honestly just an average porter. I have no reason to drink this one again"
"O: This is a good offering from Baird. Not their best but a solid porter."
"Doesn't quite have me sold as a Baltic Porter, but this is a decent Porter through and through, hits all the right spots and delivers the goods with a refined balance. Once again the Japanese prove their finesse when it comes to tackling dark beer varieties."
"Overall: Although I don't have a great deal of accolades for this beer, I rather enjoyed it; I don't think it comes close to being a Baltic Porter so I haven't rated it to that style"
"For being on the opposite side of Russia from the Baltic (sea and culture), Baird does a more than adequate job recreating the real deal. A pleasant surprise, and agreeable enough for a day where spring seems to have taken yet another detour on its already delayed arrival."
"The gf like this, but I'm not a fan."
"This beer is good enough that it's enlightening me to the fact that all beer that comes from Japan doesn't have to taste like Sapporo! Love it!"
"Very drinkable, and a very pleasant, solidly crafted porter."
"Pours a brownish red color, pretty uncharacteristic for a baltic porter. Smells like soy and chocolate milk with a solid roasted maltiness. Tastes more like porter-flavored mineral water or maybe porter tea than it does baltic porter. Rather watery with roasted malt and cocoa notes. Barely tips the scales as a porter, much less a baltic one."
"Drinkability isn't bad."
"Average Baltic-style porter. A little on the light sight - more dark brown than ruby black, with a thick, light tan head. Light, mild chocolatey scent and barley. Dry, baker's chocolate taste with some hop bitterness floating around. Coats the tongue a bit, nice and smooth but a bit thin. Not a bad beer, but could be beefed up a bit."
"D - the flavor is just not good enough."
"Taste is perfectly sweetened dark chocolate with a nice touch of smoke and rye bread. Has an unfiltered sake taste that may or may not be my imagination with Japan on the mind. Has a nice, smooth bread dough aspect with a decently bitter roast and hop finish. Nice, nice beer that was an impulse purchase in central Louisiana. Glad I did, as this is an excellent beer and much better than I expected."
"Overall probably one of the best beers I've ever had from Japan. I wouldn't mind another some time soon."
"Not bad, not bad. Not too much into the sweeter beers, such as this - still, not a bad brew. Poured with a gigantic foamy frothy light tan head and lotsa lace. Color is a very dark brown with walnut highlights. Aroma is big malt and some roastiness plus a little caramel. Flavor's about the same but it's more sweet. A little too sweet for me. Body's not bad, a little chewy, good carbonation. Finish is decent and medium in length."
"It's pleasant. I wouldn't buy it again being stateside, but it's worth a taste if you're into seeing what these ""new school"" breweries are producing."
"All in all, this was a great experience. Kurofune Porter is a well-crafted beer from a place you would least expect - Numazu, Japan. ~"
"Overall: Pleasant porter, nice taste, though not to strong, just like a porter should be. A nice surprise from a country that tends to focus on hops or crisp lagers."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable brew. Nice and balanced with some good flavors to back up the pleasant nose and the great pour. Definitely worth a try if you can. Thanks again BJ!"
"D - A nice, drinkable porter that has some dark malt character that borders on becoming a stout. The aroma is a bit weak but is made up for by the dark chocolate in the flavor. Well made and highly drinkable, this would make a great session beer if it was more widely available."
"Drinkability: Whew at 6 ABV and with this much sweetness and weight Im not going to be pounding a bunch. But one pint is totally drinkable, and I wanna finish it."
" Body is full and creamy, with just a touch of oiliness. An interesting interpretation of a porter, and although I wouldn't say it fits the traditional definition of a baltic porter, it's good nonetheless."
"Coffee subsides in the taste and an English nutty porter comes through. Hops give it some zip. Slight sourness on the end, leaves a malty residue. Easy drinking. Very solid English regular porter...no baltic, though."
"For $5.99 for a 12oz bottle, I am expecting a beer to be in the 8.5% range or higher. If this isn't the case, it better be a damn fine brew for me to justify purchasing again. I do not believe this falls into that category. A fine beer for $3, not $6."
"An interesting beer, but not what I think of for a porter. Worth a try because it is unique, though I prefer much more roasted malts."
"Brewer's description: ""This classic dark English ale is flinty, oily and wonderfully smooth. It is teasingly acrid with notes of bitter chocolate and coffee. The inclination is to resist; the result is acquiescence and embrace."""
"Drinkability: I respectfully disagree with this being entered in as a Baltic Porter, but that's neither here or there. Recommended! Overall, an enjoyable, flavorful, well-balanced beer and another solid effort from Baird."
"I like their ales better and will go back to them before this decent, but not inspiring brew."
"According to the bottle, Baird Beer is a Japanese craft brewer, and if this beer is an indication of their either offerings, I'll have to give more of their work a try."
"I had the Baird Red Rose amber and was very impressed so I grabbed this today.Poured a deep cola color with a thick creamy one finger off white head that never settles it stays thru the duration of the pint.Very fruity nose with a bit of char,the fruit is not that of dark fruit,almost tropical in nature wich was very different.Very smooth creamy mouthfeel it just glides down with ease and is not overly full.Flavors are of caramel/butter up front with some hefty fruit,the finish is lightly charred with a little bit of wood.This porter has some complexity,doesnt have alot of traits of a Baltic porter so Iam not sure thats what I would put it in,either way very nice."
"Beer poured into a Rochefort beer chalice. Black beer forms a tan 2 finger head. Great lacing spiderwebs itself across the glass. Smell is dominated by milk chocolate as is the taste and the finish is mildly bittersweet. Beer has a medium body and is very, very easy to drink."
"D: Overall a very good beer, and the label kicks ass! A good beer for when you don't want to be flattened by an RIS.. Nice deep, mellow and delicious."
"Quite drinkable, overall. A very solid brew."
"12 oz. Nearly opaque black pour, slightish white head, lasted half way through the beer. Solid roasted malt and coffee nose. Similar in taste, with some mocha and a light hop character. A bit light bodied, with a clean but slightly watery finish. Good drinkability, but much more standard porter likeness than Baltic. Still one worth trying from this brewer though."
"M + D: Medium body, reasonable carbonation, a touch of slickness. Nice to see a good brewery coming out of Japan, though it appears it is an American 'displaced in Japan.' Either way, he makes a decent beer, and I'd be looking forward to the next."
"I'd say this is more of a dry or possibly export porter more than a Baltic Porter. That said, the pour is nice, with a very dark brown color with some garnet highlights and a moderate head that fades to a thin swirl. Smells toasty and yeasty with some dark fruit. Even slightly jammy on the nose, but not sweet. Tastes very nicely balanced with a nice roastiness, some earthy hops, a bit of ash, and some restrained dark fruit. Quite dry and with a light, lingering bitterness that is quite pleasant. Some slight bitter chocolate notes creep in as well. Quite pleasant and a good porter all around."
"Chocolate comes through as the beer reaches room temperature."
"Probably the best Japanese beer I have had. Makoto should be proud. He would give one of these the ol, kumpai! I sat on this for almost a year, so maybe that's why it turned out so good. It has a nice scent. Sweet but in a mild hoppy way. The taste is rich with chocolate coffee type tannins coming through. Nice creamy full flavored finish highlights this beers extensive armamentarium of tantalizing tastes. Not too drinkable because of the richness, but I could eat through about three or four in a sitting."
"Taste: A funky spice with some wood, tannin, musk, tobacco and dark fruit. Very dry finish. Feels a bit thin for a porter but nice enough to sip. Thanks mcallister for sharing."
"Pours a beautiful brown coca-cola color with a frothy tan colored 2 finger head that does not want to recede. Smells of sweet coffee, roasted malts and hints of chocolate complete the nose. First sip is both sweet and bitter with coffee and chocolate mixing in balance with neither being too over powering. The sweetness gives way to a bitter finish. Even though it is bottle conditioned, the brew is slightly under carbonated. The body is on the thin side but still this beer is somewhat creamy. Very tasty and easy to drink."
"My first whiff when I opened the bottle was rather fruity, more like a cider than a porter; the next whiff, though, was smoky and had a coffee tang. It pours a dark chocolaty brown with a fairly thick pale tan head that does not stick around for too long. Flavor has a strong burnt coffee component and a fruity, slightly sweet undertone. Texture is smooth and quite tingly, but not nice and thick like the best porters I have sampled. All in all, not a great porter, but definitely enjoyable."
"Kurofune is a fun beer, tough to pin down but every bit as good as the craft porters coming out of the best breweries in the USA. At nearly $5 a bottle it's a luxury, but you'd better believe that if this came in cheap 6-packs I'd be all over it. One of the better beers I've had from Japan, and recommended."
"Pours very dark brown, almost black with thick uniform off-white to tan head that leaves rings of thick lace around the mug. Good roasted malt aroma. Nice roasted malt flavor with decent bitterness in the aftertaste with chocolate and a little licorice. Medium to full bodied with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Very drinkable and worth trying."
"Pours near black with a light tan head. The lacing lingers until the last sip. The nose has mild chocolate notes, along with some fruity esters - dates, raisins - almost belgian-esque (similar nose to a dubble). The taste is mild, some roasted maltiness up front and a lingering bitterness. Not much chocolate or coffee in the flavor. The carbonation seems a little high and fine, which is expected in a bottle conditioned beer. Overall, a decent beer and an average porter, but I would recommend many others over this one."
"D - I would recommend this to a freind."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth."
"D: This is a drinkable beer, but not my favorite as porters are concerned. Still, not without its charms."
"Notes from 6/14/08"
"Even though Kurofune Porter is too expensive for regular consumption (and isn't widely available anyway), it's a classic English porter that is some kind of enjoyable. I'm looking forward to seeing what else Baird has up its brewing sleeve. Kampai!"
"This is a lovely porter if you prefer to have no coffee flavors in this style."
"Enjoyable brew. Would gladly have again."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a frothy 2 inch tan head (the pour was a bit vigorous). Head retention and lacing are both excellent. Aroma is coffee, bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some caramel malt and smoke noticable too. Very nice. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit oily and smooth. Drinkability is good, the smoothness makes this easy to drink. I just bought this today, and I'm glad I drank it today too. I think it's a pretty good brew, I definitely recommend this. This is the first Baird beer I've tried, hopefully their other ones are this good too."
"ABV: 6.0%"""
"This is my first sample from Baird Brewery and I'm looking forward to trying others. I really like the unique but subtle twists and turns they took when brewing this porter. It goes down easily and is very enjoyable."
"A very good porter that doesn't quite taste like Baltic porters but has a nice character of it's own. A bit pricey but worth trying if you get a chance."
"Chocolate and roasty malt notes, some tobacco and mild bitterness. Even carbonation, feels very good. Fairly light, but above average in body. Overall this was very enjoyable with no flaws at all. Thanks to autumnaldave for recommending it."
"Pours a dark but kind of clear brown when you really look at it. Tannish/crème-ish head. Caramel malty nose. Flavor is very smooth. Caramel malts abound. Crisp and a bit dry. Very defined character, but not blazing away with things. It's nice. Feel has a lower but biting carbonation to it. Very pleasant to drink. Well done. (But not so much a Baltic Porter really)"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a sturdy carbonation. It hits a nice stride with how I like a porter to be...not too light and not too heavy. Overall, a great smooth porter from Japan. Very glad to see this brew make it over here and I hope more Japanese beers make it this way, as there are brewers doing great things there!"
"I'm not so sure if I could drink this often, but a well done porter nonetheless and the pace at which I finished it surprised me. If you're into porters, try to check this one out."
"Intense black color, with a very dense creamy head and a nice lacing. The smell shows some red fruits, oranges, chocolate, trufle like, some milk chocolate powder. The taste is of roasted coffee, with hints of smoke, chocolate and oranges, and still some red fruits. THe mouthfeel is great: the beer's almost melting in the mouth; a bit powdery with the chocolate thing, but it's not a problem, it's even enjoyable. Quite drinkable."
"Easy drinking, 6% alcohol is covered right up."
"Kurofune means the black ships and it refers to the Comodore Perry's fleet with which he threaten Japan to either open its ports peacefully or have them opened, thus opening trade with the rest of the world."
