"Complex flavor, but too much jelly"
""
"Outlier. Pretty noticeable alcohol and I did't get any peanut butter. A little berry flavor late. My least favorite of the framinghammers. Still really good, just more of a J than a PB&J."
"O: This beer is one of a kind. I know there are a lot of PB&J beers this doesn't have much peanut butter but the awesome jam taste and the bourbon crank this beer to another level."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: the gimmicky one of the framinghammer and easily the worst of the bunch. strong artificial fruitiness and over sweetness make this beer almost undrinkable."
""
"Appropriate name, and the PB&J is there, but just not my cup of tea..."
""
"Grape jelly all the way. Sadly, I'm not a fan of grape jelly."
""
""
"Sad stuff. I really was looking forward to this beer but I can't hardly drink it. I keep hoping some warmth will aid its drinkability but it seems hopeless after a solid half hour or so."
""
""
"O - This was pretty good and I waited 6 months. It could have used another 6 months to temper the BB flavor."
""
"Very smooth and Jammy. The Porter roast compliments the jelly."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another fun Framinghammer variant and one that I'm thrilled to try, but not my favorite on the bunch. The jelly parts of this are too present while inhibiting some of the finer elements of the base/barrel."

"Overall pretty nice but missing real Peanutbutter, nice raspberry jam and overall base beer with chocolate, etc, but just missing the Peanutbutter."
""
""
"Serving type: Bottle"
"Enjoyable and unique, but dial up the P, and dial down the J in the mix to make this Baltic Porter what it could be. Still recommended, but a touch let down."

"These type of beers are cool and this is a better version of this style, but alot of jelly."

"O--Very interesting beer.  If you are in the mood for a beer outside the box than this beer is for you.  I thought it was very well done but could understand if this wasn't for you.  Would have liked a little more peanut butter taste but overall this was pretty solid"

""
"Well hidden ABV - drinks like 7-8% ABV and alcohol esters contribute positively to the overal flavor."

"Overall: the PB&J flavors are there...As long as you like your pb&j with rasperry jam, which I do. Hilarious how well it works here. The level of flavors work nicely. I really like the residual barrel notes. I think this was a big success, but Im not sure the flavorshere would be to everyone's preference. I hope they brew this variant again in the future."
"This is delicious in spite of how weird it is- the guys at jacks Abby really blended these unusual flavors together well. It smells of bourbon, peanut butter and jam. It tastes like all of those things fuzed very well into a serious Baltic porter. Smooth mouthfeel,just delicious. The reason I didn't give it a five all around is because the peanut butter is strong at first in smell and taste and then is overcome by the jam as the beer warms. It's delicious though. Buy it."

"A bit disappointed with this one. Flavors aren't really harmonious. Vanilla, subtle peanut, hint of raspberry, smack of bourbon at the end. Finish is medicinal an lingers."
""
""
"I'm torn with this beer.  I wanted a more Peanut butter and jelly focused like no crusts and its definitely heavily barrel aged.  PB is heavier in the smell and taste and aroma cold, but gets light as it warms.  Jelly is subtle throughout.  Around 55-60, it gets to be bourbon heavy with subtle hints of pb&j.  I want more.  There already is a barrel aged framinghammer.  And coffee and vanilla are so strong.  Torn damnit."
""
""
"Defintely get hints of peanut butter but the finish is an awesome blend of chocolate and dark berry flavors.  I wouldn't describe it as grape but more like blackberry."

"Had after no crust, this is a better beer! lots of peanut in the nose, lots of kelly in the taste. Not artificial, very well intergrated and yummy."

"O-When it's at its perfect temperature, I find that the peanuts are more noticeable in the aroma and the jelly comes out more in the flavor. As a whole, this beer is absolutely boss. I love Barrel Aged Framinghammer. I love Peanut butter and Jelly sandwiches. It seemed like a stretch but I loved this beer. Far-out, zany and excellently crafted."
""
"O: Welp, certainly a unique combination and one that was executed quite well. The bourbon is a little too harsh and overpowers the beer to an extent but a couple months of age on this should mellow it out. Raspberry is wonderful and really adds a nice layer of complexity to the beer. Peanut butter could be a little stronger but regardless of the nit-picking, this was a nice unique take on a delicious base beer."

"Edit: I tried a second bottle on 11/10/14, about 5 months after the bottling date, and the only difference I noticed was a slight bitter, raw peanut note came through a lot more as it warmed.  I'll chalk it up to my palate."

"Overall this is pretty good, and tasted better out of the bottle than the sample I got at the brewery."
"Very unique , but they really hit the peanut butter and jelly flavor on the head. Worth a try! Seek it out."
"O - As a fan of Jack's Abby, this sit pretty well. Surprisingly balanced blend here, very complex flavors bouncing off each other. Very well done. Without the power of suggestion, you could still pick up PB&J here."

"I wish the raspberries came through a bit stronger, but the peanut butter flavor is very strong, real-tasting, and awesome."
"Overall a fun beer to try just if you hate chocolate and raspberry like my girlfriend you will be disapointed. Peanut butter needs to show more."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark, opaque milk chocolate, auburn tinges and a light tan head. Berry nose, peanut, malt, dark fruit. Jelly and dark fruit dominates flavor up front, chocolate peanut butter, roast malt, bitter finish. Thicker body, low carbonation."
""
""
""
"The flavor follows of peanut butter then chocolate, bourbon, and then a nice hint of grape jelly. We had this after Cocoa-Nut, and this blew that out of the water. This is an extremely successful flavored attempt at the BA base beer."

"Overall: Fantastic. I've never had a ""peanut butter"" beer and didn't know what to expect. The peanut butter comes through fantastically, being subtle enough not to dominate, but its presence is welcomed and adds substantially to the flavor profile. The raspberry is very subtle but also present and gives just a little extra surprise to make this something special. I had this at the brewery and thought it was great, but out of the growler - a little warmer - this is amazing. Let this one warm up to get the true experience."
