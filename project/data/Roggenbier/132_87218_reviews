"Like this beer. Suprised the abv was just 5.5"

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, some interesting flavors but it didn't seem to blend very well.  Each was a distinct piece rather than melding together into a whole."

"Overall, I like this, it has more to offer spice wise than the Hazelnut Brown, but is different in its own right.   I think the use of quality ingredients is what sets this apart.  I would go again on this one."

"O- this is my first roggenbier, so I didn't know what exactly to expect.  It actually drinks like a hoppy, peppery brown ale.  Overall, it's not very complex, but quite drinkable   3.5"
""
""
"Final thoughts: Although this may be my first roggenbier, and not even a German-made one at that, it was highly enjoyable and brought together the flavors of a few different styles. My one caveat would be that the rye, while in the name of the beer, was not entirely present in the flavor. However, it did not stop me from fully enjoying the experience. Nicely done. Would I drink it again? Yes. (4.25)"

"Very sophisticated drop. Smoky, curious, but ultimately finely balanced and nuanced."
""
""
"This is a well-balanced brew (despite my misapprehensions about Rogue's smoked malts) and perhaps a good an introduction to this style, which I had not tried before."
""
"pours a cloudy hazy medium brown color with off-white colored head. thin layer of head hangs on until the bottom of the glass. some lacing. aroma is earthy, herbal, but subtle. taste is well balanced, starts a bit sweet, finishes drier, long finish. rye is definitely highlighted. medium body and carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is very good and smooth, but I wish there were a little more flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a bit too heavily carbonated in a medium body. It gets crisp but can't fully achieve a firm bite before the carbonation gives way to a smoother undertone. It thins out some in the end after it gets a little tinny."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't know much about this style, but this version doesn't impress."

"Overall â€“ A tasty and easy drinking rye that is a little more on the mild hop side. Quite enjoyable."
"In the old days, we could rate a beer for ""drinkability"". This would be one of my top 5 beers from 2013 in ""drinkability"". If I could get this in 6-packs, it would be in my regular rotation."
""
"Put this up against your favorite weizenbock and I don't think you'll be disappointed."

"I think this is my first Roggenbier and I rather liked it, just Sahti and Happoshu to go and I've tried every style listed on BA"
""
"Overall, I very much enjoyed this beer. It had a lot going for it, and managed to package it into a very neat and coherent brew. Another sign of the solidity of Rogue."

"Poured from a 22-oz bottle into large tulip glass. Leftover from NHC 2013 grand banquet. Drinking with charcoal smoked ribs tonite. Should pair exquisitely."

"Pours a dark brown hazy root beer hue with about four fingers of tan head. Aroma does evoke weizen yeast spice and dark sweet malts with a whiff of smoke and fruit. The beer starts with some caramel and biscuit malts and a vanilla bourbon-like rounded sweetness that is really quite nice. The smoke is subdued in my view; do not be deterred by this. The weizen yeast flavors are also subtle, at least to my palate. I don't get much banana but there is some plum on the finish. Peppery spice makes an appearance but once more is mellow. The malts add coffee flavors and the rye adds a grainy spicy bite but overall the beer is smooth and balanced. Think brown porter with weizen yeast rather than a dunkelweizen."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a dark mahogany brown amber with a one finger off-white head with good retention and lots of lacing. Aroma is caramel malt with slightly sour, spicy rye and light grassy hops. Flavor is a very well melded caramel and biscuit malt, rye and slight nuttiness that is somewhat subdued, but so nicely integrated that it is quite satisfying. An unexpectedly nice medium creamy body with excellent mouth feel. A nice, understated roggenbier that seems a bit bland at first, but won me over with a very satisfying balance and flavor. A nice roggenbier that I will buy again."
""
""
"Medium bodied with a little bit of an acidic mouthfeel. Medium length."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is the first rogenbier I have had before, so it makes things tough to compare with others. Still an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
"Alright for the style, wouldn't buy it again. Most of the ""special"" releases from Rogue are underwhelming me. Drinks easy but doesn't really entice you to want more"
""
"O: My first of the style, this is a very solid brew. I really like how the spiciness of the rye, the smoke, and weizen yeast all work together to provide a nicely complex and enjoyable beer. Comparable to Schlenkerla Weizen with a heavy rye presence. I can see how the smokiness might be a bit polarizing if smoked beers aren't your thing. If you're a fan of smoked beers, then I'd recommend this"

"The spice and pepper are muted but present in the smell. Hopes make a secondary appearance. Malt is a much larger part of the taste, and it balances quite nicely. Mouthfeel is decent, perhaps a touch too much pepper for malt and hops to stand up against. Overall, this is the sort of flavor I look for in a rye beer."
""
"An enjoyable drink."
""
""
""
"Pretty boring."
""
"O - I expected a ton of rye flavor. I thought is was sort of bland. It's cheap enough, but I do not foresee purchasing any more of it."
"O - definitely a tasty brew and a style which I don't recall having tried, although I was surprised on the amount of yeasty esters it did seem to work well to compliment the spicy grain, not a mind blower but another solid offering from Rogue"
""
"O: Probably one of the more drinkable beers in the style - not that I have had the opportunity to have many of these. I think this beer is easy to drink and one I could enjoy several of during a session. Definitely worth grabbing (and I am not always the biggest fan of Rogue's offerings)."
"O: I thought that this beer was really drinkable compared to the other beers I've had in this style."
"Overall i am not sure if other Roggenbiers are like this, but I like the diversity and balance in this beer regardless and the smokey touch is a real treat to me also. I could have this again."
"NOTE: There is a duplicate of this one, called ""Roguenbier Rye"" and categorized simply as a Rye Ale. These should be combined. They have stopped calling this one Rogue Farms, now they use the title ""Rogue Chatoe"" for the series."
"O: Roggenbier is a super rare style, so I had to pick a bomber of this up. Finishes a lot better than it starts. Go for it for a unique experience, though it still has that Rogue house character."
"22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass; no bottle date, but a late 2012 release. Pours lightly hazy deep reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big spicy rye, caramel, toast, brown bread, smoke, light roast, pepper, clove, light citrus, floral, and roasted earthiness. Nice, pleasant, and unique aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes with moderate hops; with solid strength. Taste of spicy rye, toast, brown bread, caramel, smoke, light roast, light clove, pepper, floral, pine, light citrus, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of rye, caramel, toast, brown bread, light roast, pepper, floral, pine, light citrus, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of flavors with good malt complexity and robustness; nice hop/malt flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good Roggenbier! Nice balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate hops; and very smooth to drink. Never had this style before, but this was very enjoyable."

"Overall: Appallingly bad."
"Overall, It's a fantastic rye beer and one that isn't overly hoppy or noticeably ""rye"" on the palatte. The subtle flavors come through but aren't in your face, you might even have to think about what's being presented to you. It's definitely one to try on it's own or with food. If paired, I might say some pizza, chicken, or even some non spicy chinese food."

"Overall, I am perplexed. This just feels like a complete miss to me."
"Thanks to buschbeer for the try!"

"Poured from a 650ml bottle. Pours a brown, slightly cloudy colour. The nose is amazingly complex with aromas of cloves, spice, grapefruit, ginger, peppered beef jerky, smoked meat. The taste is similarly intense, dry and smoky. There are notes of grapefruit and peppery spice. The creamy mouthful makes it remarkably easy drinking."
"Poured into a snifter glass. The beer pours clear dark toffee brown from the bottle, but collects into a near opaque brown in the glass. There's a thick, off-white head that dissipates slowly. There are aromas of rye malt, brown bread, smoked malt, and earthy hops. The dominant flavor is an interesting mix of the spicy rye character and smokiness. There's some brown bread and earthiness. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. There's a lingering earthy and smoky aftertaste. The beer does go down smoothly and pleasantly. This is a good beer."
""
"Overall - It's hard for me to gauge how true to the style this beer is, because it's the first and only roggenbier I've ever seen available. Based on what I've read though, it does sound like it stays true to the style. That said, I doubt I'd buy this beer again. It's fair, but this isn't a style I can see myself getting into and, based on the lack breweries producing it, I think a lot of people feel the same way."
""
""
"Well, that's one way to get pronunciation right... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset topaz topped by over a finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises rye bread, light black pepper, and a vague sense of some sort of orange character. The taste keeps some of the spiciness and breadiness and adds a decent helping of soap. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly chewy-ish feel. Overall, this beer just didn't sit right with me. There's no real sense of weizen-yeast character, the rye doesn't meld well with anything else, and the flavors just fall flat."
""
"An ok-ish rye beer, how this is a German Rogenbier, vs. an American Rye Ale, I don't know. More rye than most beers and whiskies alike, so points abounding there, I suppose, but there's not much more worthy here beyond that pithy foreign reference."
"O - My first Roggenbier. Well balanced with a nice flavor profile. Just wish the nose wasn't so unpleasant."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely worth a try, as it's so unique. Probably wouldn't drink this again in the near future, but still very good."
"The first taste of the Roggenbier style, but it seemed to fit the descriptions of the style fairly well and was enjoyable to drink. It really makes me wish there was a more readily available example of the style."
"Cheers"
"This beer really showcases the rye's grain profile. By itself that quality will probably make this beer a cult favorite and despised by others. But this beer is also the CDA of rye beers, judging from color and aromatic profile. And a good CDA at that."

"TLDR: A heavily smoked belgian IPA with a tart red-apple bitterness that you will taste the next morning."
"3.5's across the board.... I wish I could have given higher numbers, but personal preference definitely came into play with this bottle."
