4.3,3.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"O - Very nice. I am glad I started with this one. I typically don't enjoy too many "chewy" beers but this one was a revelation. I really liked the flavors and it never got to the point of being overpowering. Great stuff.","orangesol","Jul 23, 2011"
4.42,6.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Similar but distinct from the draft version. The softer carbonation and lack of C02 brings out the rye spiciness much stronger than the draft. Pour is similar to draft, opaque and murky copper brown with a bubbly, fleeting clear head. Initially has traditional dunkelweiss flavors; clove, fruit, banana, and yeast. The rye spice and breadiness of the caraway. I liked the base and I like this treatment even more. I've only previously had Troegs Scratch Roggen, but I'm very impressed by both versions of Iron Hill's.","yourefragile","Jul 17, 2011"
4.08,-1.4,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"M: A sweet mouthfeel that yo-yos between weizen and rye. Super added awesomeness points for the caraway.","akorsak","May 12, 2011"
4.5,8.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"o: This is becoming a favorite style of mine, one I rarely get to try unfortunately. This was well worth ending my long standing boycott of Iron Hill growlers for. In fact I'll probably go back for another fill of my new IH screw top.","DIM","Nov 09, 2010"
4.05,-2.2,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"A very tasty rye beer. Poured a cloudy burnt sienna with a healthy white head that retained well. Light spices and banana aroma. Toasted malts up front on the taste, very organic and earthy, with a thick banana taste coming through, and rye sourness in the finish with a hint of spice. Smooth, medium body, and very drinkable.","Rifugium","Feb 18, 2008"
3.89,-6,4.5,3,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: A nice alternative to a hefe. I like how the rye is there but not too overpowering. A sipper due to its heaviness but a beer I would like to have again.","tigg924","Aug 04, 2007"
4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"D: Easy drinker for the change of winter to spring. Sourness is balanced and does not build.","Biscuit033","Beers"
4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Very hazy caramel colour topped by a short cap of off-white foam. Good head retention. The aroma was mostly bread crust with some spicy rye and mild banana character. Mild bitterness with sweet caramel, rye, and mild banana notes throughout. Bread crust appeared at the end and it finished quickly with a burst of spicy rye. Slick, oily texture with moderate carbonation and medium body. A little creamy. Quite an enjoyable pint. Lots of interesting flavours are present, but they don't tire the palate. If this shows up again, definitely try it.","DrJay","0"
