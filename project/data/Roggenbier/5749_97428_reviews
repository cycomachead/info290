"Pours a slightly hazy dark amber with a hint of garnet.  World class head volume and retention, but almost no lacing. Light nose of molasses and burnt sugar over a slight note of spice with a hint of prune.  Very light medium body with a bit of smooth texture.  Above normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.  The flavor profile is reasonably intense (but picks up as it warms), somewhat balanced but lacks the complexity of the nose.  It begins with mild rye, then flows into a mild spicy bitterness.  In the middle a hint of sweetness comes through as the bitterness fades.  The finish is a slow fade that ends with a slightly sour burnt nut off flavor.  In short, a disappointment."

"Doesn't taste like other rye styled German varieties or Roggen's I've had, but makes for an interesting brew that's for sure.  Just wished more of the aroma gave a better sense of what the palate should expect, comes off a bit disappointing."

"Overall: Not what I was really expecting overall but really enjoyed my first of this style. The rye and sweeter malts play along well together here. I highly recommend letting this brew warm a touch as that opens up a ton of the dark fruits and herbal notes."
"This is pretty much alcoholic Kvass. It's the same bright, refreshing, crispness with the distinctive slight tartness and spiciness. Unlike traditional Kvass, the hops keep this from being sweet. I really like it."

"Overall though, it's very drinkable, well-crafted and undoubtedly interesting. It's not as complex as it could have been, I feel, but who am I to say what a roggenbier should be. At least now I have a legitimate benchmark."

"O: I would say this beer is the definition of ""rustic"".... hearty and messy (which does seem to hinder greater definition of the complexity of the individual flavors).... this was right up my alley and certainly something I will try again soon to see what else it may reveal"

"On the fuller end of medium body with a spicy rye presence that's countered by some sweet malt before a lingering buttery diaceytl presence comes in on the back end.  Peppery spice and rye followed by bready yeast, caramel malt, toffee and biscuit but the finish is really buttery, metallic and astringent.  Even without this, the rye is kind of tame and the malt profile needs a touch more sweetness.   The odd flavors in the finish make it really harsh and unpleasant. Tough to finish.  "
"Not sure how I feel, as this is my first Roggenbier. It's a different type of funk, and I'm trying to be open-minded. In the end, you feel like you are drinking a living thing, one on the edge of decay. It feels like it has some age, and the qualities that exist have been nurtured out of the brewing process. Very interesting and worth a try for the curious or adventurous."
"Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy dark burnt caramel amber with a half finger light tan head that dissipates to a thin film leaving light lacing. Aroma of rich caramel malt, cooked caramel, nuts and a hint of rye sourness. Flavor is lighter caramel and light toasted malt, rye with light rye sourness; flavor is light compared to the aroma and harder to determine because of very active and peppery carbonation, which was not obvious in the pour, but sadly detracts from the intensity of flavor. Light to medium bodied. An interesting traditional rye ale that is so actively carbonated that it is hard to savor the somewhat subtle flavors. The rye and caramel malts are nicely balanced and this is a tasty rye beer that I wish I could have savored a bit more."
"This beer is quite sour, far more than the smell would lead one to expect. The more roasted malts are lost in this--it's not extreme, just dominating. Think SweetTart without the sweet. The swallow and aftertaste are more of the same. The body leans to the thin side while the carbonation is quite high."

"Overall- Just a little bit above average. If this is typical for the style, it is not a style I will be pursuing. I would like to try other examples though. I would give it a try if you've never had a roggenbier but I would pass if you have."
""
"Overall, an interesting beer and a style I don't see as often as I'd like. Definitely something different and refreshing. It was just missing too much body and the flavours only really came through on the initial sip. Definitely try this one if your up for a lighter feeling rye beer, but don't go out of your way."
"O: Not a bad beer, if a bit on the uneven side. Still, pretty drinkable."

"Tangy and flat, mild maltiness and an off-putting twang that is either from rye malt or a sign of infection. Thin lifeless feel like uncarbonated wort. Mild flavors, light fruitiness from the yeast. Sort of basic, the carbonation and tanginess seem to be flaws that make this one to pass on."
