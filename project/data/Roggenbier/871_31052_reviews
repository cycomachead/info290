"Perfectly nice - plenty of spice, decent body, reasonable depth. Just not especially a rye beer. No closer to having insight into this style..."
"D- A light refreshing profile, just a bit thin in the flavour profile and poor appearance - possibly due to age. Will need to revisit with a fresh version"
"Taste-well, lets just call it pretty hollow. So disappointingly little stuffing that it borders on anorexic. There is a slight trace of dark mealiness but in general it is just dominated by a flavour of bubble gum. Ends with a degree of sweeetness but it just lacks density, weight and substance."

"Great BBQ beer!"
"Nothing too exciting here. I'm glad I found this Roggen, though I was expecting something with more spicy rye flavor."
"D - pretty fresh and drinkable, especially in summer season"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and quite sessionable."
"D- Very interesting beer that I think everyone should give at least a try. A little bit for everyone in the flavor of it."
"Cola black with a nice pearly, champagne coloured head that rises above the lip of the glass like bread, but then collapses like souffl√©. Nicely layered aroma with chocolate and raisins coupling with honey and rye. Flavour is similar, lightly fruity and full of earthy, bready rye flavor. Nuances of cherry, banana bread, and walnuts appear as well. Dry and somewhat fizzy, and ultimately quite interesting and drinkable."
"The body is for it quite light, with a pleasant caramel, spicy notes. On the sweet, but not heavy at all."
"It's a style I hope to revisit someday, although this beer and the Paulaner version (rumored to be identical?) are the only common examples."
"We were in Regensburg and the women were doing a little shopping. I spied a courtyard entrance with a Roggen sign next to it so I told them to find me inside. There was a shaded courtyard with a fountain and I plopped myself down and ordered one. It came in the prettiest 1/2 liter goblet (which you can see on the T & T website) and made this beer all the more enjoyable. Very dark ruby in the glass with a generous head which eventually faded away to a tawny ring. There were nice banana and clove smells. Even with the full body, this beer was a little drier than I expected. I took my time with this one, enjoying the a lingering finish. I'd have liked to have tried another but had to move on! A wonderful beer drinking memory."
"Drinkability : a very good beer in the Roggen style."
"Taste is caramellic with a clean yeast profile. There is no bitter and body is thin, which takes away the attention of the nice taste. Again I do not get any roggen, maybe a little oiliness, but this just guessing, I want to believe... Mouthfeel is velvet smooth. The thin body is a real turndown, every sip starts out good untill I swallow and find very little body and aftertaste."
"Zum wohl!"
"*Taster's Note: My bottle listed 4.7%ABV"
"In all, it lived up to expectations, and was worth the search effort."
"Aside from the winey flavor, which I assume shouldn't be there, it seemed like what a german lager style brown ale would be. Slight toasted malt character, with some rye rough-edgedness. Fairly clean and dry. Hops come through lightly in the finish, serving mostly to cut the sweetness of the malt. Carbonation is mild, particularly for a german style. Tasty, even though I think it was past it's prime. I'd definitely like to try this again when i know it's fresh."
"Hazy, very dark-orange-honey color with a huge, tannish rocky head that drops shortly after pouring but leaves an excellent collar and some good lace. Unusual aroma -  a citrusy ""weizen-like"" character, along with some ""mintiness"" (I assume from rye). The body is medium-light with a high level of carbonation that gives a zest on the tongue and a drying, grainy mouthfeel. The flavor is more subdued that might be expected, starting with a crisp bitterness, showing some smoky chararacter and spiciness along with some softly sweet fruit notes as it crosses the palate, and finishing dry and clean. There's a lot of complexity here but it's not readily apparent."
"A different beer, sweet spicyness, definitely with a rye aroma.  The abv is 4.7% and the US importer is United International."
