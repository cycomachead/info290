"Flavours are a little short-lived but include banana and bready malt with a hint of a toasty note."

"Tho the rye isn't extremely obvious, the result is a very tasty dunkelweizen. Really good."

"Overall: I was very excited about this one but felt a bit let down, which probably led to the relatively low grade. Was hoping for a finnish rye bread and wheat sweetness but ended up with a rather strange, flowery and perfume-ish beer. It's drinkable though."
"Rye and wheat in the same beer? I don’t know about this one…"

"I like the idea, and it's pretty well put together, but it does feel like a bit of a blind-man's-bluff experiment, and they could have leaned a bit heavier on some elements to make it pop out."

"Not overly complex but a decent balance of banana/yeast/wheatness with caramel maltyness. Malt flavor is more honey caramel as opposed to much darker/roasted flavors. Some spicyness in there, not nearly as much as american rye beers though. Different, i guess its not a typical roggenbier in that its wheat based."
"This brewery is for sure hit or miss, this one seems ot be more of a miss."
"However, when I was state side, I managed to have a fresh glass of the Bruery's Rugbrod on tap at the Ginger Man in NYc, and I remember a slightly more spiced character, but this is every bit as good, and unlike Rugbrod, not so strong, so a glass doesnt overwhelm you tastes. I would award 5 on smell and taste, but I havent tried all Rye beers in the world to try, so maybe a edit in the future, but for now, a strong contender for the best! Cheers, heres to a good discovery."
"D: If all Roggens are like this... This was a great beer, in my mouth at least."
"The mouthfeel is very full and creamy and i could drink this again"
"O: Decent beer. Different and interesting, though I wouldn't jump at it."
