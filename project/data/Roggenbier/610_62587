3.76,-1.6,4,3,4,4,4,"Overall: Bear Republic know how to brew with rye. I enjoyed this one and is a good example of the style. I still prefer German versions of this style, but would pick this up again.","tigg924","Apr 08, 2012"
3.67,-3.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the malt profile, enhanced by all of those nice aromatic spices. The robust nose also helped lend an appreciation to the malt profile, but in the end, the flavoring was a bit thin around the edges, the total refinement was simply not there, all while missing those big, characteristic rye inclusions.","TheBrewo","Mar 03, 2012"

3.75,-1.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I really did like this beer almost as much as the change in Kim's demeanor. She was quite pleasant tonight and, once we got used to it, it was pretty refreshing. The same can be said of this beer. If you get used to the rye coming through then you'll find this pretty refreshing as well.","Naugros","Feb 15, 2012"
4.05,6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a bright copper color with a big white head; a good bit of lacing. The smell is mildly herbal, with some fruity notes and something like bread dough. The taste is a little spicy, with banana notes and some sweetness like shortbread; a little hop bitterness in the finish. It's crisp for an ale, with good carbonation and a thinnish body. A very nice beer, incredibly easy to drink. I'll get this if I see it again.","gory4d","Feb 02, 2012"
4.35,13.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a cloudy brownish amber color. There is about a finger of white head resting on top. The head has good retention, and there is some scattered lace left behind on the glass. The nose has a good bit of rye and spices. There is also fruity juiciness to the nose, as well as some banana. I am getting a little bit of yeastiness as well. The taste follows the nose pretty well. It starts off with some rye and maltiness. There is a nice fruitiness and banana flavor. There is some clove and other spices present, as well as some yeastiness and a mild hop presence on the back end. The finish leaves some lingering rye and spices behind on the palate. This has a medium body and the carbonation is on the lower side. It goes down easy and has a really nice smooth feel to it. There is some rye spiciness and some fruity sweetness to it. There is a really mild hop bitterness on the back end. It has a nice refreshing quality to it. This has really good drinkability. It goes down really easy and has a really nice flavor. Overall, I think this is a just a solid easy going beer. It is almost like a rye hefeweizen. This is my first Roggenbier, but I am definitely looking forward to trying more. I definitely recommend trying this one out. I would buy more of this one.","JizackFH","Dec 11, 2011"

4.67,22.3,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Served out of a pitcher at the brewpub in Healdsburg. Very nice appearance with lacing that runs down the glass. Not an overbearing Rye smell but enough to take notice. A welcome change when one gets tired of all the great IPA's in the area and a great choice when 3 or 4 beers are whats called for. Nice to see an underrated style get put on tap, and a great beer to enjoy on their patio... Glad we got it instead of 2 pitchers of Racer 5.","Norica","Jul 22, 2011"

4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a dark yellow with almost three fingers of head that actually sat upright over the rim of the pint glass. Smells of straw and peppery rye. Taste is wheat, lemon, and rye. As this is the only roggenbier I have ever tried I'm impressed with the combination of sweet and peppery. The rye really comes through as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Not sure I would want more than one in a sitting, but glad I had it while on the West Coast.","tdm168","Mar 26, 2011"
4.13,8.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Hugely quaffable and perfect for a lunch on the patio during the summer. A very nice beer. In fact, I sipped from a friend's sampler of Bear Republic's other beers and I'd choose this over any other, at least on this day.","Verecund","Beers"

3.15,-17.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Enjoyed on tap at Rattle 'N' Hum. Medium yellow colour with minimal white head. Sharp apple is how the taste comes off. Average mouthfeel, not very drinkable.A bit of spicy nose, featuring the rye.A little yeast that contributes little.Would like less cloves more hop.","Sammy","Oct 13, 2010"
