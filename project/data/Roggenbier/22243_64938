3.82,-3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This rogeenbier comes amber colored with a thin off-white head. The aroma is rather malty, spicy and sweet with that unmistakable hefeweizen yeast character--spicy, cloves, and banana. The flavor is much like the hefeweizen, sweet and malty, with spicy, slightly dry character from the rye. The beer finishes just slightly dry and makes you want more. The carbonation is moderate and body medium, maybe medium-thin. In fact that might be the one thing that could use some improvement. Overall a very tasty beer that I would like to enjoy again.","uwmgdman","0"
