"From notes at the brewery: Pours a slightly hazy copper orange with a spotty-lacing off-white head. Aroma of lightly sweet caramel malt and Bavarian yeast with a touch of lemon and banana esters. Starts with average fullness and mild toasty malt and rye sweetness with a hint of clove toward a dry crisp finish. A pretty unique and drinkable brew with good authenticity. Enjoyed the cheeseburgers here!"
"Beer is medium body (a little heavier than expected), nice wheat like character (or is that the rye). I was expecting some more rye spice to this beer but I didn't get it. There is some banana ester flavors in the back mouth / aftertaste, not unpleasant. Good drinkability, good mouthfeel. Overall a good beer."
"D - Only available at Sweetwater Tavern, so yeah..."
"Definitely an easy beer to drink. This is the first beer that I have had from Sweetwater. I'll definitely have to try some more down the road."
"Overall, I liked this. This would go great with a burger or steak. The rye is very apparent and has a great taste, not overpowering at all."
