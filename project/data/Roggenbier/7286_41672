4.05,8.6,4,4,4,4,4.25,"Notes: Very hazy brass body beneath a two-finger-thick head of white. Very good retention and lacing. Aroma of a weiss bier w/ yeast and phenols. Flavor also phenolic: a bit of banana and some slightly burnt plastic. Tartish and juicy fruit - apple. Mildly caramelish. Rye is present and adds spiciness that balances it. Mild, perhaps moderate bitterness balances - not much is needed given the spiciness and subtle tart note. Unique. Charming. Somewhat complex. Certainly worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Dec 01, 2013"

3.75,0.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a cloudy pinkish gold under a one finger off white head that settles fairly quickly to film and collar, leaving no appreciable lace. The nose is strong and enticing, full of plum and a bit of candy. The mouth is light and very prickly. Interesting and unusual taste, with lots of yeast and slightly sour fruit. The hops are very subdued at first, but come on strong at the swallow, dry and bitter. The yeasty sour fruitiness reminds of a Hefeweizen, but this is heavier and much more bitter. Definitely refreshing, this brew demands slow enjoyment.","Globetrotter","0"
