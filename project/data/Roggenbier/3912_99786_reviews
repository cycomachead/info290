"Purchased in a sampler pack. The rye is not overpowering like it is in some rye beers"

"I don't have a whole whack of examples of this style upon which to draw, so I can't say how well this one falls into the canon as such, but this is certainly sweeter than (my) average Roggenbier.  Worthy of giving a go, nonetheless, even if any brew from this outfit reminds me of kicking it in the bar of my fancy Victoria St. hotel with my future wife a number of years ago."

"Final Grade: 3.84, a B+. Resurrection Roggenbier is the third rye-focused brew I've tried from Cameron's, and as far as I'm concerned it's yet another winner. This beer has a decidedly hefeweizen-esque vibe to it, and for that reason I must strongly recommend it to fans of that style, as they are sure to appreciate the spicy finish and banana esters that characterize this solid, sessionable rye beer. I can't say how this compares to other examples of the style, but I knows what I likes, and I doubt that this is the last my glass will see of this beer before the end of the year."

"O: Never had this style before, but it is certainly unique. I love the idea of rye beers, but I don’t have anything really to compare this with as its my first Roggienbier. Dry and unique, but nothing really standing out to make it interesting. It wants food, and by that I mean I see myself not drinking this for the outstanding flavor, but more for its unique even keeled character, or perhaps as refreshment on a hot day. Cool label."

"Cameron's Resurrection is a considerably unique offering; you don't find many roggenbiers. Indeed, there is far too much clove and peppery yeastiness to appreciate any of the conventional pumpernickel or sweet, toasty graininess that many (myself included) have become accustomed to tasting in rye beers. Ja, gute Arbeit sicher!"

"A decent rye heavy beer with lots of spice and herbal notes, it's a fairly good all round beer, rye is very evident but there isn't a ton else going on, balance is good and it's got a herbed/tonic character that is cool but not really what I was expecting. Worth a try but short if outstanding."
"Bottle: Poured a light brown color ale with a generous head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of rye malt with light spicy notes. Taste is quite smooth with some spicy notes and a smooth finish. Body is about average with good carbonation. Maybe a tad too dry for its own good and a bit too much notes of unrefined grain to be highly drinkable."

"Spicy nose like a weak-kneed weizen. Comes across the same way tastewise, spicy, banana-fruity, but a touch metallic with a thin brittle mouthfeel. Slightly sour finish. I just found it too understated to be interesting or satisfying. Nothing in it that pops."
""
"Overall - A decent very drinkable and well balanced beer, but nothing that is all that exciting. Worth picking one bottle up but not something I'd buy again."

"Not all that rye and using a banana imparting yeast. Lacy. The Only Café. So-so drinkability, ok as a beer. Brown coloured body, small head.Somewhat rough.Clove and spice. Toasted malt, not that interesting a rye beer, needs something else to make it interesting."
