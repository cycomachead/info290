3.63,-7.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.75,"Hazy amber in color. The aroma has some wheat and rye notes, but what really comes through is the clove character. The flavor is similar. I get some rye and clove notes, as well as the addition of some banana. The yeast really adds some nice flavors to this beer. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Likely the best Abita beer I have tried.","Mora2000","Nov 22, 2012"

4,1.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Another My Place (Newtown, CT) find, this one is a very cloudy murky tan color with a decent white head and a goodly wall of lace. The aroma is interesting with significant clove and bacon and mild citrus-malt highlights. The flavor brings on an intense, sweet grass malt and clove combo with the hint of banana. Very nice and a pleasant surprise for sure. Clove and bright citrus bite dominates with a mellow wheat malt background and just the suggestion of some booze. The body of this brew is medium with a light, crisp feel from tiny bubbles. Drinks nicely though probably not an ideal session beer. Restores my faith in Abita.","Durge","Oct 17, 2012"

4.3,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a great golden hazey color into my pint at Bulldog Midcity, NOLA. Great banana clove and malt aromas. Taste is very very amazing...surprisingly amazing and full of perfect hefe flavors and aromas. Really surprised by this brew. Its truly an amazing hefe and full of perfect banana and clove flavor, perfect balance, great feel, some rye bitters,...if you see this brew; get it. Although I am failing to find a real difference with a Roggenbier...","DrinkSlurm","Sep 25, 2012"
