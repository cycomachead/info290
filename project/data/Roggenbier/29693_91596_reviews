"I'm unfamiliar with the style, but this one seemed enjoyable enough."

"Overall: this beer has a je ne sais quoi that appeals to me, although it also seems like it could be cleaned up a little. I'm not a pro on roggenbiers, but this one seems decent to me."
"Overall - All over the place. Individual flavors are interesting but doesn't work at all together."

"22 ounce bottle poured into a Unibroue tulip. Thanks Cheesemoose! Minimal head, some clear, oily lacing. Murky brown body. Aroma includes caramel, overripe banana, brown sugar. Taste follows suit with a little spice not on the back end and maybe a touch of smoke. New style for me, very interesting and quite tasty actually. I would think this would be extremely drinkable to most people, particularly those who like a nice dunkelweisse-like flavor."
"Had wanted to try this style after reading about it a few months ago. Thanx to Lets Pour for the chance. A very interesting style, I can't wait to try some others and see how they stack up to this one, which was very good."

"O - Rye and malt heavy, but a nice change of pace. Solid."

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a reddish coppery amber with a thin head that dissipates quickly to a thin film and ring around the glass. Aroma of wheat, banana, cloves with a hint of sourness. Flavor is mild wheat with a mild rye sourness with light cloves and hints of banana. Light bodied with better carbonation than the head indicated. This is exactly the way I would have expected a rye hefeweizen taste. I have never had a roggenbier from its native home, but this is what I would expect. A nice refreshing change of pace light ale. One of three rye beers from this brewery that were just released and I'll be trying over the next week. Glad to see more rye styles available."

"Overall a great introduction to the roggenbier style. Well-crafted and tasty."
