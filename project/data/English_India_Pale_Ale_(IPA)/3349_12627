Ovearall this is one of the best English IPA's I have tasted -it has an authentic English yeast taste with great complexity and very drinkable strength-wise with 5.6%.

There are lots of visible tiny bubbles rising in this beer. Some lacing is left behind on the glass during consumption. There are aromas of brown bread and toffee. I also detect some floral and citrus notes along with the English yeast. The first sip brings that brown bread and toffee, but the toffee notes aren't too sweet. I get the citrus and some nice back end hop bitterness that isn't too bitter and the English yeast comes through pretty well. It has that unmistakable Burton ale flavor with a good mineral quality. The long lasting head actually adds a bit of creaminess that I'm just not used to when I take a sip of this beer. The flavors are wonderfully well-balanced. The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry and smooth. This is a highly drinkable beer. This is an excellent beer that I would recommend.","acevenom","May 19, 2013"

Very pretty beer. Lots of English hops in the aroma; I'm not good at this, but my guess would be Goldings. It has a sweet citrus aroma shot through with a peppery spice. I'm not enjoying the malt contribution as much. The caramel sweetness is a bit limp and doesn't quite have that luxurious quality of that I love in other English beers. Perhaps, a touch of diacetyl, not that it's a problem, just a little English twist. The taste adds an interesting mineral note but loses some hop brightness. The malt is still a bit underwhelming. The bitterness seems to have that lasting dry flavor that I think of coming from Burton's hard water. Still, the beer either needs a richer malt sweetness or a drier profile. The malt bill kinda plays the middle and doesn't do a great job of it. Good yeasty, mildly bitter finish, though. It's an easy drinking beer. Mouthfeel is relatively gentle. The attempt to mimic cask ale doesn't work all that well, but it's a good thought - I recommend a relatively hard pour and patience. The drying finish helps a lot. Drinks easily. It's always fun to try a good English beer. Too few make it across the Atlantic.","popery","Feb 19, 2013"

It tastes like earthy hops, fruit, toffee, tea, toasted and bready malt, and a bit of peppery spice. There's a nice bitter finish, too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and has nice, soft carbonation. I think this is a good English IPA. At $3.99 a bottle, it's worth trying.","bluejacket74","Jan 17, 2013"

Flavors are subdued and the body, while being a little thin, is almost too big to allow these soft flavors show. It does a good job of having that cask ale mouthfeel out of a bottle but its just a little dull. Bitterness is nice though. Could be my new world palate trying to review a true old world style.

This is exactly what it's style should be and immensely drinkable. Is it big and bold like most of the higher-ranking beers on this site? No, but it is just as, if not more complex and arguably tastes even better. I'll be buying more of these without hesitation. The only downsides are its fairly limited availability and that it's a little high in ABV to be considered a session ale. But it's still an amazing beer.","Phocion","Dec 23, 2012"

This surprises me as the label claims "Closer to Cask for a fuller flavor"...I expected something low on carbonation and richly malted. It also boasts "Our finest IPA for true IPA connoisseurs" and I surely didnâ€™t find that to be the case. Upon even further inspection, this particular bottle was brewed by Tenth and Blake Beer Co.
