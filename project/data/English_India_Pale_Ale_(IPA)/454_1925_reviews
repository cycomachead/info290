"O - good enough."
"Throughly enjoyable. Not a big hop bomb of an ale, but enough bitterness and maltiness to be very enjoyable."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/6/2014. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, toast, biscuit, and floral/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops, bready malt, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, toast, biscuit, and floral/yeast earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, pine, floral, grass, toast, biscuit, and floral/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Good complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops, bready malt, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good English IPA. All around good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops, bready malt, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall – An alright IPA that is slightly more dank and resinous in hop profile.  It was alright, but nothing too special overall, with me likely taking other IPA’s of comparable price and abv. over this one."

"O: It is standard, but this is a very well done IPA that is vibrant enough to make it worth your while."

"O: Great everyday ipa. It's mellow and drinkable. The malt balances the hop nicely making it extremely versatile. The only downside to being a well rounded beverage means that it doesn't stand out in any particular way in the hops department."
""
""
"Don't know why this beer garners such unenthusiastic reviews. I just had one, bought at random, and it's a delightful surprise. The flavor is citrusy without being over the top, and there is enough hoppiness and malt to be rewarding. True, it doesn't really come across as an IPA, and I think that's part of the problem: what is it, exactly? Honestly, I don't care - it's worth having on hand."

"This beer is a little different from other IPA I have tried, but I must say that I find it agreeable and like it more as I drink more. At first, I was a little put off by the buttery component to the taste, but I took a liking to it once I opened a second bottle and actually find it interesting. The taste is less bitter than others of this style and it seems like an IPA that most will find at least acceptable. Give it a try and let us know what you think."

""

"Not bad, but a bit of style confusion. At first a mango citrus like west coast style IPA, then the buttery malt tries to balance. Not the best example of the style, but enjoyable for what it is."

"Overall, this is a grand beer; I'd buy a sixer."

"An orange amber hued color with a medium off white lasting head with some light lacing. Aroma is of pine and floral hops, some grapefruit notes with caramel malt. Taste is sweet caramel malt, yeast fruity grapefruit notes with some floral pine hops bitterness. A medium body, smooth sweet bitter flavor with good carbonation on the palate. Ending is a combination of sweet caramel malt, yeast, mild grapefruit with some floral pine hops for balance. A very good, tasty and enjoyable brew."

"O - A drier English IPA, but its very clean and crisp. Nothing too exciting, but decent."
""
""
""
"Overall, a quite solid EIPA, good clean malt flavors and subdue hop presence with strong bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"I like this one quite a lot... a rather unique take on an IPA (yet again, could be because it's of the English variety), and it's very easy drinking. Would be pretty much the perfect IPA to drink after a long summer day, as it's not cloying, isn't too bitter, and is insanely drinkable. Very tasty IPA."

"a very standard ipa, very easy drinking. nothing too special, but not bad by any means."

"Nice three finger head with scattered lacing and decent retention on a cloudy copper body. Lots of pear in the aroma, more so than any other IPA I have had. Also with some orange peel and little on the malt side. More pear heavy in the flavor with a lot of green apple again light on the malts. Some caramel and floral notes as well with hint of metallic flavors in the finish. Medium body and fairly highly carbonated. Not a bad IPA, certainly unique with nice flavors. Not a malt forward beer but enough malts are there to provide some flavors."
""
""
"Pours a darker, almost brownish rusty copper, cloudy, and unfiltered. Head is modest, and lacing is punctuated as fine foamy dots. Nose isn't recognizably floral IPA like, actually showing more malt and sweet than anticipated for an IPA. Mouthfeel has lower carbonation for this bottle, but is fine in character, like champagne. Bitter notes are late, a sweet, not too dry note early, the echo of bitter notes not well extended. This won't last long for an IPA, which for an IPA is usually not the case, in its echo, I mean. Perhaps this is better considered a mild session ale, to my tongue the hop notes giving is a lower IBU if I were to guess. I wouldn't pass this up on tap, or at a party, but given other IPA's out there, I wouldn't take six."

"I'd drink it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again. I've had a few English IPA's that were hard to drink, this one is no problem. Can't really taste the alcohol either. I'm certainly not an English IPA expert."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a good IPA, but not an outstanding IPA. It has a good, strong hop forward flavor, but nothing to standout in a crowded field of IPA's."
""
""
""
"O - Enjoyable with some uniqueness to the flavor with the fermented-peach flavor. Not overly complex."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was quite good, and gave me more than I was expecting out of an English style IPA. It stood up well to some habenero-jack cheese."
""
""
""
"Once it settled own I saw it was a tan-amber color. There’s a faded but still noticeable hop presence with a citrusy aroma. The flavor has a nice hop bitterness. I pick up a subdued citrus hop flavor with a mellow bittering and a pleasing malt finish. It’s a testament to the malt profile that it has held up even as the hops have faded. I shared this with my pops!"
"Overall: Great session IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was hoping for more from this one. I have a sneaking suspicion that this may be old, but without a bottle date I have no way of telling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I feel this is a pretty good interpretation of the English style IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:	I was not overly fond of this beer. The flavor was the best part but it was mainly just above average."
""
""
"O: As is, this is a solid English-style IPA. If the flavor profile weren't so odd and off-putting, it would potentially be a wonderful take on the style. I feel that this one needs a bit more work to reach its full potential."
""
""
"There are better examples of the style out there. I personally recommend the Brooklyn East India Pale Ale and the Sam Smith IPA if you're looking for a good English IPA."
""
"D: A blend of English and US styles. The malts are a bit dry and it lacks the caramelly richness often associated with British interpretations. But though it might lean toward being clean it does have hints of esters and diacetyl. The hopping is done to a bold US level. However it is not a cascade clone or super dank. It does have some citrus, but mixed right in with an herbal, earthy, resiny profile that is more UK. Nicely drinkable."

"It's very smooth and slick, there's enough body and carbonation to keep things positive. Not the best beer to come out of the woodwork."
""
"This beer pours a slightly hazy orangish amber color. There is about 2-fingers of off-white head resting on top. The head has decent retention, and it leaves some scattered lace behind on the glass. The nose has a nice citrusy piney hop aroma to it, and there is a good amount of malty sweetness here as well. There are also some scents of caramel, fruit, and some toffee. The taste follows the nose pretty well. It is hop forward and there is a sweet malty backbone. There are some other flavors of caramel, toffee, citrus, and some fruity esters. The finish leaves some lingering hop bitterness, citrus, and a bit of sweetness behind on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy, and it has a nice smooth quality to it. There is a good amount of piney hop bitterness here. Some sweetness is in the background, and it balances out the bitterness pretty well. The hop bitterness lingers on the palate for a bit. This has pretty good drinkability. It goes down good and the flavor is nice. I could drink a few of these in an evening. Overall, I think this is a good beer and a nice example of the style. I think it is worth checking out, I would drink this one again."
""
"O: I really like this beer. They don't distribute this in upstate NY, so it's a treat I will buy again when I visit my brother in Cleveland."
""
"O: Interesting style. It's basically halfway between a milder english pale and a hoppy india pale ale. Not bad but not spectacular."
""
"Trying the Arcadia IPA...which is an English Style IPA...so there is not much scent or taste outside of what you would call normal. The beer poured a tan clear with very thin white head that is not lacing. The scent and taste are a fresh hop with a slight malt balance. The mouthfeel is medium to light beer with good carbonation. Overall, a tasty beer that is worth a try if you like English style IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured this IPA from a bottle into a pint glass. This IPA poured an orangish color and produced an off white head. Good Head retention and lacing. The aroma of this IPA is decent, not as strong as I would like it to be for an IPA. Notes of malt and citrus grapefruit shine through. This beer is medium in body, malt backbone and bit on the sweet side. Decent amount of citrus grapefruit hops. Decent mouthfeel, good starter IPA, nothing that makes it stand out however."
""
"Overall: Its a tricky style, where you have to balance the delicate (not overly-assertive) hops perfectly against a fragile malt profile. This one doesn't screw it up, but doesn't shine either. I much prefer Goose Island's IPA to this one."
"Overall, while this is a decent stab at a traditional India pale ale, the excessive bitterness holds it back from being great. I'd gladly drink this if it was offered to me by a friend, and would probably grab a half pint if I saw it on tap, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy a full 6-pack. It's a quaffable IPA that could use some tweaking."
"O: I can't recommend any IPA fan to buy this beer. My initial impression from the nose and taste was this seems an awful lot like a homebrew. Oh well..at least I got a sweet cap out of it."
"This brew poured out as a decent looking copperish gold color with a fluffy white head on top. The lacing was pretty good looking on the glass. The smell had a good amount of hoppy aromas and to it along with a nice balance of malts. The taste of the beer was hoppy and finished with a good amount of bitterness to it. The mouthfeel of the beer was pretty smooth with a nice little hop bite on the sides of the tongue. Overall this brew was pretty good."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange in color with a dense, rocky off-white head. Smells of vague citrus fruit rind. The taste begins with a sweet orange, followed by a very herbal, caramel middle, and a hint of rye bread. The finish is citrus fruit rind. Mouthfeel is creamy, pretty high carbonation. Overall a good beer."
"Overall: This does not fall into the explosive IPA category, but it is pleasant and drinkable."
"O: I don't hate it as an IPA, I just don't love it as an example. It reads pale ale all over it."
"Overall it's on par with a lot of the English IPAs I have tried. That's not necessarily a good thing. You know, now that I think about it it kind of reminds me of a watered down English barley wine. Bah."
"O- Solid beer for the style, The abv makes it a good session-able beer. Will buy it again"
"Overall, a solid beer and one that I would expect myself to buy again."
"O: definitely something off here, not that i am a huge fan of english ipa's to begin with. drain pour unfortunately."
"Overall, this isn't one I'll be buying again, but it isn't entirely unpalatable."
"Overall/notes - Well, this is a bit surprising for me, as I've enjoyed this out of the bottle before. It's a nice beer, but I'm not so sure I'd call it a go-to IPA. I wonder when this batch was actually brewed, as the malty finish overpowered the hops. I'll have to try it again."
"It has a nice unique, refreshing taste. One could easily drink a lot of these, and I recommend everyone to do so."
"Pleasant, almost easy enough to be a session beer but for the 6% abv. Purchased as part of a mixed 12 pack, this is a tasty beer. I'll be rating the other beers from ths 12 pack later, but I've tried them all already, and can without hesitation recommend that mixed 12 pack, whether to stock up for yourself, or to have on hand for a party."
"The feel of this beer is rather smooth and has a medium drinking with it is going down easy."
"A very smooth and CRISP beer. Very balanced flavors as well. Great beer Arcadia Brewing Co!!"
"This beer pours a hazy orange color with a little bit of white head with little lacing. The aroma is strong with floral hops and that's about all. The taste starts with floral hops and then ends with some malty sweetness. The mouthful is slightly harsh with overcarbonation but I would recommend trying this IPA."
"D- I would pick in up for price (9 for 6), but overall I prefer the 400 Pound Monkey and a few other English IPAs. Well worth the price if Arcadia ever distributed to Indiana again."
"Drinkability- Not bad. I wouldn't have more than one at a time but a great 4th or 5th beer during a session. Arcadia has always brewed great beer."
"D: The drinkability on this is pretty high, I could easily go through a couple pints of this at a bar, and for and IPA the alcohol is not too bad either. Overall very nice."
"Another great beer from South West Michigan where the best beer in the world is brewed. This IPA is a lush copper color with a great creamy head. Just a wonderful blend of hops and malt to give it easy drinking session beer. Over all not the best IPA out there but not to shabby either."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel but almost a bit watered down tasting (kind of contrasting I know, but hard to explain better than that). Not to knock this beer. Would be a very sessionable IPA. Nothing over the top. Mellow, but good flavors. If I were looking for a nice pale ale with a little extra twang. I would keep this in mind."
"Pours a somewhat-cloudy orange-copper color with a good white head and a small amount of lacing as it goes down. Thick collar and a spotty cap. The nose has a bit of caramel and British pale malt along with some herbal and earthy hops. Pretty tame, but not bad. The taste is pretty different from the nose, actually. The caramel fades to the background and there are some hops, but the dominant flavor comes from a frutiy English Ale strain. The back end is pretty bitter, showcasing the hops again. Interesting and a decent take on the EIPA style; certainly pretty drinkable."
"A delicious offering from Arcadia Brewing, and is definitely worth a try."
"There's very little that detracts from this brew's drinkability. Either this is underrated or all the reviews are old and it's been tweaked."
"Overall this was a Mediocre IPA, the flavors were they were just a lot more weaker then they should be. A good choice for someone getting into the style, but it's just no my cup of tea."
"Pours into an orange body with a thin white head with some good retention, decent lacing and little carbonation. It has an orange-citrus smell with a hint of pine and some floral hops. The taste is an orange taste with some grapefruit, grape, pine, a little floral hops and a slight hint of malts. This IPA doesn't seem to leave a strong after taste and is a smooth, crisp and very drinkable beer and is by far the best of the three IPA's I had tonight from three different Michigan breweries. The only thing is that the other two are American IPA, while this is an English IPA."
"Poured a cloudy orange w/ a good one-finger head that died slow on top of a real citric lemony aroma along with orange peel and some sweet malt. A mellow hopbite but the citric and spicy notes are perfectly noticeable and there's a hint of grape in the flavor as well. Real smooth, light-bodied, a hint of sweetness as it passes over and then a nice, crisp dry finish. A simple yet thoroughly enjoyable IPA."
"Overall- this brew and company blows. the only thing i ever tasted that was worth anything from arcadia was their scotch ale. i'm gonna give the last 4 out of the 6 to my cousin cuz i would rather have my huma's. i really had hopes for this company. i heard within the year or so they got a new headbrewer. i thought of that and their new labels might have been better but still the same... THEY SAY ENGLISH BUT THEY MEAN CRAP!"
"drinkability - takes a hit over the the mouthfeel - while the taste is good i do not want to drink a flat beer of this style"
"Unimpressed by Arcadia IPA. There are some very obvious defects in this beer, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like this. First and foremost, in the aroma, I smell that plastic-y, band-aid, chlorinated smell that I usually correlate with contamination or a hot fermentation. Also, the fact that it's overcarbonated means that it could be an infection. There is bitterness, but this is not a good tasting beer with characteristics that I like. If it's not contaminated, then this is a poorly made beer and either way, I recommend against buying and or drinking this beer."
"if you get a chance."
"D_Very easy drinking."
"D- This is very drinkable. I could tear through a six pack of this in no time."
"M/D - Mouthfeel is full, rich and creamy. Very enjoyable mouthfeel. Drinkability is good, could possibly be a bit fresher, but overall not a bad EIPA."
"English IPA indeed. A little bit on the malty side, almost bordering on ESB, but hoppy enough to be as advertised. Dark amber, almost brown. , no head and no lace. Smells of an average IPA although there was a bit of the alcohol in the pour. Mouth was average IPA. A touch of candy, a touch of licorice but the malt washed through and very little after to speak of. Mouth and earlier pretty much sum this up. Good English IPA, but lots of others out there."
"Overall, not a bad Michigan IPA, but there are so many better ones to be had from this great brewing state."
"D-A nice change next to all of the IPAs I've had lately. Although it has some different aromas and flavors going on, the bitterness is still nice and defined."
" Body is nice and lively, a bit creamy. Good for the style. This is a very good example of an English-style IPA, which is a nice change of pace from the west coast hop bombs I'm used to. Well done."
"Overall, not my type of ipa. Not overly hoppy like an American and it had some off fruit flavors here. Somewhat drinkable if one likes these flavors."
"Taste, a good deal for the English version. Not as good as hopmouth, but more in line with tradition (which is a negative). It is definitely better than your standard English ipa from the island(s), but in the end, you just want them to push the envelope more into West Coast ipa territory if that's your bag. Toffee is nice and all, but I'd like a little more."
"M/D - nothing too overwhelming, or exciting, but if you want a mild, nicely balanced IPA, this is a good start"
"D: A decent English IPA despite the slight unbalance in the hop/malt dynamic. Quite refreshing and I could knock a few back no problem."
"Drinkability: A decent brew, if it a little boring. I could certainly drink a few of these, and it's tasty enough for a session, but nothing really makes it stand out. I've had better from Arcadia and hope to keep trying some more, however."
"The color is honey-amber, coupled with a quality off-white head. A nice level of lacing acts as if it is stitched to the body of the beer. An excellent medium body, and an extremely clean finish makes this a highly enjoyable beer for me."
"D - Did I get a bad bottle or is this just the weirdest IPA I ever had? A step up from west coast hops and soap flavor yet no where near what an IPA should be WTF?"
"Poured a bottle from the sixer i bought a week ago into a tulip glass and was impressed with the honey gold color and light creamy head. Light lacing dissipates quickly as does the head. Smelled malts predominantly followed by hops with a slight pine twang. Tasted like it smells with a bitter aftertaste and a citrus bite. Average mouthfeel a bit on the light side. Drinkability is good for me and i would recommend this beer to others who like the style."
"Highly viscous, with a few tannins to remind you that you are indeed drinking beer. I have had this on tap, and just bought a six-pack for a party tonight, and I'm sure this won't be my last glass of this IPA."
"Poured to a nice two fingered head. IPA was light brownish gold in color. Head was white with some overtones of gold. Head hung around for a while. Lacing I thought was average. Smelled slightly sweet. Also noticed some citrus going on. And of pine. Had that piney taste and citrus. Also malt. Had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was right. I think this would be a good session beer. Doesnt have the big ABV some other IPAs have, so you could enjoy a few."
"This is a solid, easy drinking IPA. Nothing really jumps out at you but I expect it would be very easy to polish off a few of these."
"Overall Arcadia IPA does not quite meet my expectation. Arcadia is a fine brewery putting out many quality products, IPA included, though this is not one of my favorite. With that being said it does drink quite well. There are no offensive qualities and the attributes do work well together. I would fine drinking a few of these in a given time period. Good beer and worth a try, just not my favorite."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very nice flavorful session beer with some substance and is worth drinking for a very long time."
"Drinkability: This beer was pretty drinkable thanks to the malt backbone and the good amount of carbonation. Just a general solid mouthfeel."
"I had this from the cask at the Berkley Front in MI. The beer is bright orange color with a fine haze, nearly clear but just enough to haze to disperse light. Not much foam but this is a cask beer so... The aroma isn't really all that strong for an IPA, it's hoppy but more like an aggressive pale ale. Mostly citrus-style hops in the smell and taste, but not strong enough for my tastes. Near perfect mouthfeel from the cask, creamy and smooth with low carbonation, goes down like water. Overall this is solidly average, like most Arcadia beers I find this is middle of the road, it will only do in a pinch. Or if it's the only thing on cask."
"Pours a cloudy, brown color with a maize color along the bottom of the glass. 5/3 inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of floral hops, pine nuts, slight wet hop, slight citrus, and sweet malt. Fits the style of an English IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong floral hops, dry hops, slight citrus, hint of alcohol, and slight sweet malt background. Overall, a good blend and body. Strong hop flavors like an American IPA, but the malt background is clearly English."
"Notes: Hmmm, maybe a touch of a minor let down after expecting something a bit richer from the cask. Other than that it was a decent, if fairly forgettable, drink."
"Libation: I like it. The price is good, the brew is a well balanced and it certainly satisfies my hop-tooth. The alcohol wasn't even noticeable, and I easily downed half the six-pack. I'll be back for more."
"D- Goes-down easy enough... but the hops seem to become more and more astringent with time... making this a *little* less quaffable than I would like..."
"This is a solid, easy drinking IPA. Nothing that jumps off the page but it's quite tasty and I'd be very pleased to be presented with a pint. As mentioned a few times before, it seems much more American than English in the hop department, although the hop flavor is not over the top so maybe they were just going for some modesty. Good stuff."
"D Fair or less drinkability. This IPA was really not inspiring. Kind of a one-note IPA. 2.5"
"The flavor is interesting, very malty, almost tastes like a DIPA, or something similar. The hops are more citrusy and not that bitter in the actual beer. No aftertaste at all. The second taste was better than the first. More bitterness than the first but it still finished cleanly. Overall a very good IPA."
"Decently drinkable, but seems more like an american IPA than the english, minus the quite funky ale yeast componants."
"D: not bad and somewhat of a staple for Arcadia's line up. I would reach for other Arcadia brews before this one and when in the mood for an IPA this one is further down the pecking order"
"D- Overall a very drinkable IPA. Nothing out of the ordinary.Had worse, had better"
"D= Very sessionable and a lot better beer than the Arcadia pale ale (which I have had side by side with this). I would happily drink more of this."
"From tasting notes on my blog Pilgrims Pub. This beer pours a hazy copper color with frothy white head, that settles down to oily rings on glass. Has a soft citrus and floral smell. The usual IPA flavors of pine and grapefruit. Medium body, zesty carbonation. A toned down IPA, but never less enjoyable. This beer is not a hop bomb and may be a disappointment to those who look for that. I found this beer to be a good English IPA."
"Highly sessionable, a balanced medium-to-big beer taste at a reasonable ABV."
"Drinkability: Not bad, but there are certainly some more flavorful IPAs out there."
"Drinkability is pretty nice, a fine example of the style. A pleasant surprise, well done."
"I had seen Arcadia's beers before in Wisconsin, but was surprised to see quite a few of them in the Chicago area. I had the IPA from the beer engine at Sheffield's in Chicago. Not sure if I'd feel differently about this beer if I'd had it from the bottle or from a conventional tap, but this beer struck me as being nothing special. Color was a hazy straw color with the smooth head of miniscule bubbles that is typical for a beer-engine poured beer. Aroma was virtually non-existent, and taste was only slightly more pronounced. It wasn't quite a widgeted can of Boddington's in terms of its mild-mannered-ness, but throw in some discernible amount of hops and you've got a pretty good approximation of my experience with this beer. Pretty unexciting stuff. The high marks in my review (aroma, mouthfeel) come from the beer-engine pour primarily, rather than the beer."
"Jordan."
"Bottle. Pours a deep amber, almost brown, with a thin head. Very strong hoppy, citrus and pine aroma. Taste is fairly astringent and follows the aroma, with hops and pine predominant with some citrus as well. Mouth feel is medium and dry. Bitterness is very much there but not overpowering. I need to drink more IPA's to get a better sense for the style."
"Cheers!"
"T- The hops, which comes through through on the smell, is very balanced. Not a lot of spice for an IPA BUT, it's very high quality beer. I like a nice, bitter, spicy IPA, which this is not, but I like this beer."
"Nose is a little grassy and lemon. Taste is moderately hopped with good citrus blends. Mouth feel is medium but not remarkable. Overall a pretty good tasting beer."
"Always been of fan of Arcadia, and that doesn't stop with the beer."
"In the end, the question of drink ability is, am I looking forward to drinking this beer again? no. Way better IPAs out there."
"Medium bodied and lightly creamy. Smooth and clean. But this beer gets kind of heavy toward the end, especially for what it seems ought to be a somewhat sessionable beer."
"Nice dark bronze color and opaque clarity. Moderate off-white head with big IPA bubbles. Smells like sweet pine and lemony hops. Kind of like Fruit Loops and pine cones... In a very good way. Mild hoppy bitterness in the flavor with a sweet fruity citrus note and a touch of pine. Very pleasant and not overpowering in the least as some IPAs can be. Good moderate body and carbonation and easy to drink. Very good beer."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not band, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to purchase this beer. This sample was given to me, as will be the case with my next one."
"D - this is a great IPA and one of the better tasting ones I have tried"
"D- While there are other IPA's here I like more...for the price you can not go wrong with it. I could drink a whole sixer of this without even thinking about it twice. Nice beer Arcadia!"
"Big hop bite, slightly bready note. Lots of bitterness up front and a lingering bitterness to follow. Not a bad imbibe but not real subtle in its approach. Good, but there's better big hop ales out there with added dimension."
"Pair well with Jamaican Jerk wings."
"Pours a clear amber with a thin creme head. Nose is citric bitter hops. One dimensional, but full enough to keep it interesting. Flavor is more hoppy than I would have imagined for the style, but it's nice. Salty and earthy tones that appear and then fade fairly soon on. Though as it warms the piney, citrus, and salty tones show more so and even longer on the flavor ride. Feel has a fairly nipping carbonation. Liquid is well bodied. This is a decent session ale. Nothing crazy, but enough to keep it interesting I think."
"very drinkable, i could have several in one sitting"
"The beer is a tad syrupy, very sweet in parts but balanced nicely against some leafy and tart hops. This is a complex beer and well worth seeking out. The slightly syrupy sweet maltishness complements the slightly bittering, slightly acerbic leafy hop. The beer is bittering in the finish, but it carries with it the apricot sweetness and a slight liqueur like consistency and character into the finish as well. If nothing else, this is a very interesting beer that demonstrates how the sweet malts, and the bittering hops can really play off each other. L'Chaim."
"First beer after a long night on the second shift. Boy, this beer tastes wonderful. I picked up a six pack of this Arcadia offering in Bridgman, MI on March 14 and WOW, what a wonderful beer. I had heard of Arcadia, but never tried a beer from them, so I asked the sales clerk at Mid-Town Liquors and she said this IPA was a top seller from Arcadia and I can see why. Poured into my Sam Adams sensory glass and viola, the beer looks wonderful. Smell, too, doesn't disappoint. But the best thing going for this IPA from Arcadia is the Taste, Mouthful and Drinkability. At 5.9 ABV, I could drink this all night. Thanks Arcadia, for a wonderful IPA."
"And thanks to Arcadia for the freebies for ""working"" for them for a day"
"Mouthfeel is on the light side- not a big dextrinous English beer but the pretty neutral character makes the flavor profile come out nicely. I wish I had about 50 bombers of this lying around at all times."
"Nikki"
"Mouthfeel is a little cloying but quite palatable, medium body, a little chewey, but the bittering hops keep it all in balance on the tongue. I find this ale highly drinkable, either cooler, where it imitates the western IPAs or warmer, where its truer, more English PA character come out. All-in-all, tasty and satisfying. Recommended"
"Drinkability: A very nice English IPA. Love to try it on-tap at some point."
"Recommended"
"Very drinkable. But not the best IPA I have ever tried."
"A decent IPA that is not overly hopped so bitterness is lighter- making it easy-to-drink."
"Pours a hazy copper into my pint glass. Good sized head and decent lacing. Aromas of non-lemon citrus (grapefruit???) and piney hops. The taste is a decent, yet somewhat unexpected balance of malt and some hops bite - definitely not an American-style IPA. Overall, good version of the British IPA, not my favorite by any means."
"D- Quite a delicious IPA, not a hop bomb like its American counterpart. Solid hop flavor backed by an English malt flavor."
"7/4/8/3/14 (3.6/5)"
"D: Slightly above average drinkabiliyt. Nothing special and wouldn't go out of my way to buy again."
" Pours cloudy amber with a decent offwhite head that laces well. Aroma is citrus and hoppy.Flavor is citrus and grapefruit with a decent sweet malt background,and maby some bready tones as well,quite balanced and tasty. I enjoyed this,and thought it quite drinkable"
"Review meet drain. Good bye Arcadia IPA. Nice to now know you any more."
"Notes from 6/17/05"
"Pours an amber clear color body with a big frothy head, white & creamy. Has a hoppy aroma, sweet but very weak. Hoppy sweet taste, a little bitter but not over powering. Somewhat bitter - balanced aftertaste."
"D - Not my favorite. Feels a bit harsh."
"I really liked the aroma and the head retention. Good looking."
"Drinkability - great stuff from Arcadia here, dial me up a few more..."
"D--This is a very nice beer. Good version of the style that everyone claims is original. This one may be of of the REAL closer ones. Very nice session beer."
"Pours orange/copper/dark amber with a good head, moderate lacing remains. Aroma is good, floral hops mainly. Initial taste is very good, great balance of hops, mild citrus, and biscuity malt; but this all diminishes soon. After taste leaves something to be desired, can be very dry. Mouthfeel is ok, almost too much carbonation. Overall this is a decent pick for an averaged price IPA."
"3.0 D: Aside from the MF, this beer has a decent flavor and is balanced enough to warrant another one."
"D - This beer was poor in the approach but good in the finish. It was a strange tasting for me."
"Pours a hazy copper/ orange-ish color, with a white head. In the aroma, a mix of citrus and piney hops. In the taste, mix of ctrus and piney hops, and a mellow sweet maltiness. A bitter and medium mouthfeel, with a dry, hoppy aftertaste. Nice hops and a good malt backing."
"Clean malts again, with a medium amount of hops. They are slightly grassy with a little bit of spice. Medium bodied with good carbonation. The hops linger for a while after each sip."
"mouthfeel is good, nice weight and carbonation, great explosive flavors, overall quite nice!"
"The drinkability goes only as far as the mouthfeel in this one. The flavor is quite varied and subdued in the aftertaste, working in its favor. Yet, the medium body reins it in from being a runaway slammer."
"D: A nice, smooth IPA. Nice combination of mouthfeel and taste. The alcohol receded as I drank the beer and was indeed quite warming and welcome. Definitely a nice IPA to have as the fall months start to cool off."
"Pours a golden amber with low transparency the head is a delicious looking almond,with good retention and some lace that slides away with the head. The nose is hoppy sweet and fruity. This one tastes extra malty for an IPA,with less hops than I expected judging by the nose. I taste orange rind along with some fresh fruity hops,and a light caramely finish. The body is medium and pretty sticky with carbonation being on the lower end of the spectrum,slightly dry finish. For me this offering by Arcadia misses the mark when it comes to hoppage,the rest is acceptable."
"Drinkability: Sure doesn't taste like an English IPA to me; the website says that Columbus hops were used and that doesn't sound very English to me either; aside from that, I am not thrilled by the lemony element to this beer"
"D- Not to bad fairly easy to drink I guess I'm just a bigger fan of the American style. Overall not to bad."
"On tap at the Maproom. Pours a rich hazy amber with little head. Smell is like band-aids and malt with no real hops in the nose. Taste is thin, gooey, stale malt and again just a lackluster hop profile. This one was pretty much undrinkable as it was served to me. Thin flavor aside from what was already unappealing."
"Glad I tried it but won't be looking for this again."
"I'm liking this one more and more every time. They could've packed in a bit more alcohol, however."
"Nice work. I would buy this again."
"It pours hazy amber, almost orange, with a decent head (but poor lacing. The aroma is faint and has a whiff of something difficult to identify, perhaps a slight smokiness. As it warms, it opens to a spicy orange character, sort of a marmalade effect. The flavor has an odd bite - a bit of smoke, a bit of marmalade, a hint of apricot, but of a bitter sort. It finishes with an herbal bitterness, almost like a musky rosemary. The mouthfeel is decently firm, but slightly over-carbonated, which highlights the spicy marmalade effect to bad effect. This is an interesting beer, but unsuccessful, in my view. Not what I am after in an IPA from either side of the Atlantic."
"An easy choice to make for a summery brew when you still want some hoppy flavors going on. Nice balance and easy to drink. Good brewing."
"Had this a many-o times. It pours thick, cloudy copper with a solid head. The hops waft strongly from this solid Michigan brew. The hops are definitely apparent in the taste and it finishes with a delicious but mild bitterness. It's a pretty heavy brew but still drinkable. It's good, but I've gotta take my time with this one."
"Gotta admit, I have not been impressed with Arcadia's brews in the past. Oddly sour and unappetizing would be my standard assessment. Wow, good start. Pours a nice amber color with a huge frothy head on top that leaves solid lacing as the beer drains. A nice surprise. Nose is fairly mild toffee malt, and then a touch of smoothish hop bitterness to close out. Flavor is similarly mild. Light caramel malt, light sourness (much milder than in most Arcadia offerings), and then light floral hop presence. A definite woodiness in there as well, as another reviewer noted. Overall, not bad (which is honestly better than I can say for a lot of their beers), and fairly in keeping with the English IPA style (although I could have done with a touch more hops). A solid brew that I could definitely have again."
"I look forward to trying their other British styles and hope that other American Brewers begin following in"
"Pours a nice slightly hazy orange with a decent frothy head that leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is some biscuity malts and mild citrus hops. Taste is an interesting balance of sweet malts and subtle earthy hops, just a little on the watery side. The beer is crisp and light with low carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, but not that far over average."
"I've had other beers from Arcadia that have been very good, not sure what's going on here."
"Worth a try..."
"This poured a dark tan with tons of light orange head. It smelled like mild orange hops and lots of sweet malt. It tasted like an interesting mix of citrus hops and sugary malt. It was watery with a little carbonation and a solid bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very drinkable beer with an enjoyable and unique flavor. Nice change of pace for an IPA!"
"Whoa...pours with an absolutely huge head...this bottle is definitely over-carbonated. A few minutes later, the foam retreats enough for me to get my nose in the glass of this light orange ale. Lightly flowery aroma. Buttery on the palate with butterscotch and honey. Hops are flowery and buried under the butterscotch flavor. Heavy carbonation leaves nice lacing halfway through. Not bad, but more an English Pale Ale than an IPA to me, as this beer seems to lack the powerful bitter finish of its namesake. Reminds me a bit of Fuller's London Special, but with more restrained hops and more diacetyl (too much). Perhaps some age on this one? I had the Arcadia Starboard Stout earlier and prefer that to this one. Have to give this one low marks on the appearance due to over-carbonation."
"D: Very nice and fresh and strong hop aroma but that is where the goodness ends for me. The hops are a bit out of balance and undermines everything else that might have been in this beer. Still there are worse IPAs out there than this one."
"I could drink a few of these in a sitting. Good session beer."
"A good IPA and one that I won't avoid, but one that would be vastly improved with more hops, without question."
"I had a few pints of this last night at Dek's American in Rocky Point NY, which received a dry hopped cask of this. It looked good in an orange and brown way and the aroma was getting the attention of the hop heads in our crowd. The grapefruit and lemon twang of the aroma came through in the first taste, which had a slight malt character to it. The taste was merely plain to me in a light to medium body. It took three pints for me to say it was an average ale and the reason I had so much of it was my beer group sanctioned the event of the cask arrival, so we were supporting the team, so to speak."
"From a 12 oz. bottle with C/04 notched on the side, whatever that means. Brewed with English 2-row barley and Pacific NW hops. It pours a lightly-hazed amber, with high carbonation that accumulates three fingers of almost frothy head, which deposits lots of lacing as I drink. Earthy and citric in the aroma - nice, but could be more complex. Tastes of citric, piney, earthy and lightly spicy hops that contribute a medium bitterness atop lightly toasted malts; there's a touch of heat in there as well. The body is medium and drying, with a fairly long finish. Pretty good IPA - sessionable for sure - but in the oversaturated IPA market, there are certainly better ones out there."
"D: A different tasting IPA for me, but I did enjoy it while I was relaxing and catching some TV. Would recommend for someone who enjoys a wheat beer but would like a little more kick."
"pours a real pretty copper color with a huge white head that laces all the way down, its really pretty. the smell is just as good, lots of piney hops dominate the nose. taste is pretty good, has a nice piney hop taste to it, has a strong bitterness to it, almost too strong. mouthfeel is fine and so is the drinkability."
"Drinkability is low to moderate. Tatse is pretty average."
"Good, solid choice for an IPA. Pours a darker amber color, almost a copper. Lots of foam. Both good signs for an IPA, IMHO. Nice aroma, can pick up the hops, slightly floral, but not too strong nor overwhelming. The taste is this brew's strong point. Strong hops, excellent aftertaste. No sweetness nor noticeable alcohol burn. Made me want another."
"This is a fine IPA with a welcoming nod to its origins. While the hops dominate, they are not overpowering like some. The malt is also on the low side, providing for a relatively nice balance for this style."
"Good beer overall, but not outstanding."
"Going to finish drinking this one,but I will not be heading back out to the store to get any more. I would expect a different taste and a lot more out of an IPA"
"D-not bad I could have a few."
"D - A good middle of the IPA, not to strong and very clean on the pallet."
"Damn! Just as I barely cracked the cap on this beer and it blasted CO2 all over. It didn't overflow at all, but it took a long time to pour into the glass. The body is a nice amber color with an (as mentioned before) overwhelming white head. This had a little age on it, so the hops were probably a bit subdued from their fresh state. There was just a hint of hop aroma left. The flavor had a lot of caramel in it with just a little bittering in there. This beer is on the wrong side of the hop/malt scale. The mouthfeel is pretty much the only redeeming quality. It is medium bodied and it works well. If this wasn't billed as an IPA I would have rated it much higher."
"Sizable cream colored head tops off a hazy coppered color brew. Fair amount of lace. Nice floral hop scent eminates from the glass backed by sweet malt. Taste is fronted by a sweet caramel malt, but is dominated by a nice predominately floral malt, with some bitter elements as well. Nice berry tones as well. Medium bodied with a creamy feel. Pretty solid IPA."
"over all a fairly average beer, not awful but I can't say I'll be picking this IPA up again any time soon"
"D - This is a average-ish English IPA. It's definitely British...it's got the fresh springtime flower garden and perfume thing going on, and it lacks the American citrus and pine hop flavors. I think that this is a good brew to outline the difference between American and English IPA's. A side-by-side tasting of this and something like Sierra Nevada IPA should clear up any confusion between us and the Brits."
"Drank easy, a solid EIPA, that I could session on, no problem"
"This kinda leaves me in a conundrum because this is a decent tasting beer...if it were sold as an Amber I'd probably be getting a little more excited about this but since it says IPA on the label and has both a Union Jack and a tallship on it-that's enough indicators to me be expecting one in the English style and that's not what I got."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a murky golden-orange color with a huge, frothy cream colored head. The smell is not overwhelming, obviously hoppy (citrus) but also slightly sweet. The taste is similar to the nose, not overpowering. The hoppiness is citrusy, slightly piney and there is a pretty good malt balance. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a frothy carbonation. Overall, a drinkable beer and while it isn't an ""extreme"" IPA it is well done and enjoyable."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew, went very nicely with hot wings"
"Pretty drinkable, and approachable for the style. Would make a great introduction to the style. A little too substantial for session fare, but it would be easy enough to knock a couple of these back. A nice brew that i will remember in case i need to introduce someone to the style, or feel like a solid APA (which is more where this fits in my opinion)."
"The beer pours a hazy dark gold color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a mild malt scent that boasts of pale and light crystal malts. The hops are present and seem to give off a grapefruity aroma along with a fruity yeast element. The taste is average as well. It has a pale and light crystal malt flavor along with mild hop flavor. It's not overly bitter, but the yeasty finish spoils the taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent IPA. It's true to the English style, although it's not a very good representation."
"Overall a drinkable brew, but doesn't quite fit the style. It gets better as it warms. Certainly worth a try."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The body, in my opinion, is medium with just a bit too much carbonation-especially when you've got that large head in front of your nose, though it lessens a bit as the head gets a bit smaller. Finishes semi dry leaving a spicy hop aftertaste and feel in the back of your throat after each swallow. I'd not be opposed to buying this beer again, however I much prefer American IPAs to English ones, and even more so I'd not come back to this brew until I've sampled some more of the English varieties."
"Drinkable, yes. But it doesn't excite me like other IPAs. In fact, this doesn't really seem like an IPA to me. It's got an oldish-tasting malt that throws me off. It's not bad, just not a good IPA selection."
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy dark golden color, nice carbonation, a nice two-finger creamy off-white head, lots of sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, hoppy, citrusy, slight piney, and some caramel. The taste is malty, hoppy, slighty citrusy/piney, some caramel. With almost every brew I've had from Arcadia, there seems to be a sour note thrown in, in some brew's way to much. This brew has a slight sourness to it, this should not be in a IPA. Medium body. Drinkable, I was really looking forward to the Arcadia brew's I got in trade, so far a bit dis-appointed."
"OK drinkability... but not something I'd crave."
"Poured a hazy, amber with steady, visible carbonation and good head development. Smell is fairly mild with a spicy hoppiness more akin to an American IPA instead of the English style. Taste is earthy and slightly bitter with a sour, off-flavor that I just can't place. Mouthfeel is very dry and somewhat slick. Drinkability is okay, but I wasn't very impressed with this offering. I find that Arcadia's Angler Pale Ale is a better choice."
"Cheers!"
"This brew poured to cloudy amber/dull golden color with a pretty good sized white head that had some nice retention and did leave a good amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma has a noticeable hop scent, mostly citrus with a light but sweat malt smell, but also has a slight off scent that I can not put my finger on, slightly sour? The taste is pretty nice, a lot of hops are noticeable giving it a grapefruit like favor and the malts are there as well but somewhat hidden. Over all the taste of this brew seems to be better than the scent, the off scent that I continue to notice does not translate to the taste. Over all this is a afar brew, just think that there are many more English and American IPAs out there that I would grab first."
"Overall, I didn't really care for this one. It had a bunch of strange notes to it."
"D - Decent beer, not hoppy enough for an IPA"
"D: Nothing too shocking here. Easy to drink, but not spectacular which is like most of the Arcadia beers I've tasted. Mild recommendation."
"There is a light to medium aroma of citrus oil, leafiness, but sweeter smelling than most IPAs. The flavor is slightly grainy at first with only a minimal amount of hop bitterness. It is just not apparent like most of the style. More like a pale ale than an IPA, though it is not bad."
"Wouldnt go outa my way for another."
"As with each Arcadia brew I've had, this has a very ""English"" character throughout the aroma and flavor. It is very nice to see an American brewer successfully attempt such a style in the English tradition!"
"A good easy to drink IPA, very English in style and balance. Nicely done."
"Overall , just not that great...too weak is all aspects. Thin."
"An overall lackluster IPA, an a poorly made one at that. Way too much diacetyl/butterscotch. Zero hop aroma or flavor. I'm glad I got this bottle for free.... I would have been severly disappointed if I paid for it. Even getting it for free, I wouldn't take another free one home if it were offered. Don't bother..."
"Pours a murky copper with a massive rocky head and thick lacing. Aroma is pleasant blend of pine and grapefruit with an offputting dishsoap smell. Taste is grapefruit, and pine with mild malt sweetness. Very dry bitter finish. Mouthfeel is rather thin. Wouldn't want to drink more than one. Relatively average IPA."
"Overall a disappointing beer from Arcadia. I need to stop trying these English IPAs."
"Overall, this is a great English style IPA. The classic peach flavors are there. Soft and subdued British style. English IPA's are one of my favorite styles, so a bit of a skew in the scoring, but even for the style it gets strong points."
"Thick and bubbly, sticks around after the facst, but doesn't leave a film or anything. A strong, flavorful IPA. The oak does a nice job of dulling the sharpness of the hops. It's a very nice beer indeed."
"A truly average beer. This one would work with grilled jumbo shrimp. Nothing to challenge the style or impress the tastebuds. You won't miss much if you skip this one."
"Hazy peach with a formidable off-white head, creamy and cratered. Barrage of grapefruit pith in the nose, with a caramel sweetness lurking underneath. Bitter and citric, but with somewhat ""watery"" flavor. This is not unpleasant, exactly. In fact it's sort of refreshing. But it still subtracts a bit from the overall force of what seems to have been conceived as a tasty hop bill. We've got grapefruit and slight spruce notes, as well as a satisfying biscuit malt finish. Lovely pine burps. Thinnish, juicy mouthfeel; nothing stellar but very quenching all the same. Without a doubt, very easy to drink. 5.9% abv makes for a sure-fire session IPA. Not the sort of IPA to blow anyone away, but it's as fine an example of a solid craft brew as any."
"Real good IPA that I will try again soon"
"It's not a great one, but a nice one, nevertheless, especially if you are looking for a milder, easy-drinking IPA with enough taste to be satisfying."
"The taste is creamy with a mild citrus hop flavor that is very drinkable and delicious. There's not much spice or bitter hops,making this very drinkable with a m/f that's light and well balanced. A very good over all beer that could be an everyday lawnmower brew. Not great,but very drinkable in the English style."
"It gives off a good floral hops aroma, and a slight bit of orangish/lemony fragrances. Tastes extremely fruity, a bit of grapefuit characteristic here. It finishes with a slight sweet malt flavor. This starts off with a swift kick to the palate and finishes moderately warm. Overall a good version of IPA, and I'd never snub my nose at this."
"Pours amber/orange. Thin head, with some retention,and good lacing. Smell is of malt, and earthy hops,with a hint of citrus. Body is medium, and creamy.Taste is sweet up front, with a slightly bittered finish. Nice refreshing citrus through out. Recommended!!"
"Not bad, would be a nice ""background"" beer to drink with a hearty meal."
"D - Great English IPA. Very impressive appearance and good taste."
"Cheers."
"Light orange, has a laid back iced tea appearance with a 1/4 inch well maintained frothy head. Citrus hops and sweet malts coupled with some caramel, not as juiced up in the aroma department for the IPA style. Mellow fruity hops, apple peel and warmed orange juice. Caramel malts, and fuggles hops are blended well together, very little carbonation, creamy backbone. A very cleansing palate and a finish that is reminded of a decent slice of apple pie. A great English IPA."
"Arcadia's big beer (Hopmouth DIPA, Imperial Stout, London Porter) is outstanding, while their less than big beer is merely good. This offering is a pretty good American IPA that has the unfortunate luck to be brewed in the same state as Bell's Two Hearted Ale and Founders Centennial IPA."
"Overall a decent EIPA. Certainly drinkable."
"Full head of steam released with the opener. A bit of a gusher. Apricot golden body with a giant, rocky, yeast-flecked head. Looks like a goddamn Belgian brew! Nose of sugary malts, some Belgian funk yeast, hay, and biting, slightly vitamin-y hop fumes. Interesting. Is this an old bottle? I bought it 5 days ago from a reputable store Biscuity, lightly fruity and sugary malt base up front. Overcarbonated feel that lifts the beer off the tongue before it should. Hmm Tart, staleish, piney hop bitterness finishes. Off, but drinkable due to the fact that it kind of reminds me of Orval. Better ask the store about this one."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Pretty fizzy looking head about a half inch high, which recedes to a 1/4 inch cap that lasts to the end. Color is a coppery orange. Smell is a little sour and bitter. It's not bad, just not what I'm used to in an IPA. Taste is nothing like the smell, weird. Taste is floral and light. A bit of coriander and herbal flavors. Mouthfeel is light and a bit on the creamy side. I'm feeling very middle of the road with this one."
"Notes: Good, but not knockout. If I was craving hops, this would do, but I'd head for Two-Hearted Ale first."
"Mouthfeel is much better than the bottle as well. Round with a non-obtrusive level of carbonation. Very drinkable, and a very nice dinner companion."
"Violent uncapping, opening with a loud pop. Pours with a huge white head, medium amber with flecks of yeast settling to the bottom. Looks like it should be past date, but the aroma suggests not. The packaging code is F4, which according to the website means it was bottled on 12/23/05. over 6 months old? What gives? F-you, CT distributors. Citrusy hops, orange and lemon. Meek malt presence. The flavor opens with modest malt, pale and crisp, followed by gentle pear fruitiness and modest citrusy hop finish. Altogether mild and sessionable. Not a lot going on, but solid. Probably better when it's not elderly."
"Medium body. Tons of prickly CO2 stomps all over the flavor and greatly reduces drinkability. This is a good IPA anyway, but it could be a great one with less carbonation. This bottle sat in the fridge for three months before I got around to trying it so I should get a fresher bottle in the hope that it will have less CO2 and more hop presence."
"Pours cloudy and golden amber with lots of sediment and a dusting of a head. Aromas of white pepper and touch of lemony citrus; very active, zesty aroma here. On the palate, big bitter bite at first, the lemon and pine. Some nickel comes through at the midpalate, followed by sweet alcohol and a very bitter finish. Mouthfeel is quite rough and harsh, but drinkability is still high enough. This is an interesting enough brew, a bitter enough brew. Everything is enough but not superlative. Good session beer."
"Beer pours with a voluminous head that a 16oz glass cannot contain. Otherwise, typical IPA appearance. Hop aroma is intense, perhaps bright is a better term; floral and orange smells; maybe more nectarine than orange. Flavor is hops, with a great sweet-citrus hop flavor balanced with pine. My first thought is Amarillo hops, but I'm sure they use Columbus in this. Really nice. Mouthfeel is good. Could maybe use just a touch more malt to support the hops, but the hops are not intense, just pure. Slight lack of balance keep it from being really drinkable for me. That being said, I wouldn't turn one down in the future if it was offered to me. I just may not buy it again either."
" I managed to drink enough to properly review it, and down the drain she goes. Apparently these guys have some bottling issues, as it's mentioned by a lot of reviewers. For shame.."
"A light amber color with a half inch head that laces nicely along the glass. Floral, piney and earthy aromas are very strong. The scent can be smelled before you even get the glass to your nose. The taste hits you with a citrusy, grapefruit flavor, but has a nice malt flavor at the end to finish it off. In the mouth it feels medium bodied with a slight bit of heaviness towards the end. This a very drinkable beer, good flavor, with very good aroma, makes this an excellent pick up at the store."
"A very drinkable IPA. Definitely an English style IPA, not an American hop monster. Very true to style, very tasty, worth the cost of a sixer."
"Pours a nice amber color with a nicely formed head that has decent retention. Just off-white. Nose is as expected for an IPA ... floral, hops, slightly malty sweet as well. Palate is betrayed by the nose ... citrusy hops balannced with a fairly strong malt background. Definitely not a hop-bomb, but well balanced really. Beer is medium bodied, and finished dry with residual hop flavors. A good, standard IPA in all respects."
"drinkability: high"
"Good drinkability, but I wish Arcadia would do something about the overcarbonation that seems so prevalent in their bottled line."
"Da little too flowery for my taste, I wouldn't turn it down, but other hops heads might find it more enjoyable"
"Foam filled the glass on a not-too-rough first pour. After I allowed it to settle I was able to complete the pour, but the beer still retained an impressive two-finger head throughout. Very bright, fresh hops flavor with grapefruit and a bit of resin. Nice malt in the background. A nicely done beer, and, if this were more available to me, I can see it showing up in the beerfridge."
"Nice clear copper color. Perfect 2 finger head and nice lacing. Smell of citrus hops leaning toward the grapefruit side. Also some mild spicyness. Taste is not as bold as the smell. Again, mostly citrus hops but not overpowering in the least. A little thin in the mouthfeel. Finishes dry with a faint bitter aftertaste. An ok IPA that I would drink if offered but there are so many better choices out there that I doubt I would go out of my way to chase this one down. Worth a try if you are in Battle Creek and want to stop at the brewery. From what I remember, this tasted much better fresh from the tap."
"Overall: Its a decent IPA. I wouldn't rush out to find it in the stores but I would drink it if it was available."
"A nice IPA, nice that they shipped to NJ. Not a real ""gotta have / gotta have more", but worth trying."
"Solid but not spectacular."
"After letting things settle for a quarter hour I was ready to indulge. Good, strong hop smell which is par for the course. The flavor was more subdued than I expected, especially given the bold aroma. Powerfully bitter citrus with some various spicy odds and ends lingering. Slightly grainy background provides decent balance. Once a guy has tried a couple dozen American IPAs it becomes more difficult to differentiate between the large pool of mediocre choices out there. This lands right in the middle: good, but nothing great."
"This one was pretty good. Probably the most drinkable of the three Arcadia brews I recently sampled. Nothing overwhelmed me about any of them but a couple had some decent characteristics, including this one."
"The finish is slightly dry, light/medium bodied and very drinkable. Definitely worth a try for hop lovers. Are you sure this isn't an American style IPA?"
"An above average IPA in my opinion very smooth and easy drinking."
"Overall- A nice IPA, not too strong but a solid IPA that doesn't get very complex. Its nice to have a good ole' IPA once in a while."
"Final Thought: An overcarbonated beer that still tastes good."
"Drinkability: slightly better than average. With the wealth of great IPAs out there, this is so so."
"strange for an IPA with all the orange tones popping.. but it worked for me mostly. not an all time fave but a nice refresher/change of pace to try if you see it. not worth going out of your way for but not bad either."
"I have had an Arcadia IPA pint glass for months that I got in a microbrew pint set, so I figured it was about time I actually tried one. I'll probably revisit this one over the summer when we start grilling out again!"
"A drinkable IPA, may get more in the future"
"Definetly a beer you could enjoy relaxing or socializing. A good base to work off of if you are searching out the hop giants as I am always doing."
"Rich copper color. Ruby red grapefruit, pine and papaya hop aroma, oily and pure. Oily texture with a lightly silky feel. Extreme bitterness, which is a bit rough beginning to end. Lightly toasted malts underneath mildly herbaceous, somewhat medicinal, but juicy and lingering hops."
"A decent little punch for a standard Micro IPA. Light caramel malt body allows fruitiness and hoppiness to shine. The barley sugars gives way to a noticable alcohol flavor that weaves with the hops for a pleasant boquet, citrus, and drying quality. Smells quite citrus and caramel / toffee-like. Tastes boldly bitter under light malt profile with enough sweetness to balance. Feels light (almost thin) with a clean and modestly dry finish. A good session beer. Throw'em back and enjoy."
"Good news is, I've got some Goose Island IPA waiting for me in the fridge."
"This IPA is delicious. The resinous hops add a very pleasant piney smell and the taste is just as pleasant. It has a clean finish and in my opinion is good till the last drop. It is a good ale to just chill with. After a few of these I felt like taking a nap. At 5.8% abv it's not super strong but something about it just made me feel extremely relaxed."
"This brew pours a semi-clear reddish-ornage color. The head is huge, do to the bottle, like many others I have had from Arcadia, was highly over primed. The aroma is very nice, with citrusy and spicy tones. The taste isn't quite as strong as the aroma, but is nice. The sip starts out citrusy, and finishes with some spicy notes and some moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is meium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a solid example of an English IPA. The only thing I don't like about it is how all six bottles in the six pack I bought were over primed, and took too long to pour due to the huge head."
"Slàinte!"
"12 ounce bottle. Arcadia IPA pours out a clear light copper color with a rapidly diminishing head. The aroma is mostly hops, with a little bit of a medicinal quality. Biscuit malt flavor with floral hops and some citrus flavor. A little buttery. Light to medium mouthfeel. This is an alright IPA. A little malt flavor, a little hop flavor. The flavor is mild and inoffensive. You probably won't hate it or love it. It couldn't be more average."
"Acquired via a trade with TheBlackMallard, the beer came out clear pale amber, with a tall off-white head and lots of carbonation streamers. After the foam on the initial pour settled down, the last few ounces brought in a lot of yeast sediments into suspension. The smell was rather mild in character with some spicy hops riding atop caramel malts. The taste was also lightly hoppy and mild in bitterness. The yeast did impart a peppery tang to the taste, making it a little more interesting. Malts were typical pale and caramel. Aftertaste was a little to metallic and mineralized. Whoever calls English style IPAs nothing but glorified bitters is right on the money with this beer."
"Clear, light amber with a full, dense, off-white head. Some lacing. Grapefruit and biscuity malts balance nicely in the aroma. Medium bitterness, with pink grapefruit to start and a slightly stronger citrusy finish. Medium/light body with a pleasant hop dryness. Great balance with plenty of hops. This is a very good offering from Arcadia."
"and thanks to that fine Gentleman Sir Joe of Minnesota for this one!"
"High quality IPA. Cloudy with lace. Grapefruit aroma, moderated in taste by carmel and being well malted. Juicy peach and piney. Heavy carbonation. Thanks Dr. Jay for sharing Medium mouthfeel. .Better than average brew and decent representation of style, and would like to try on tap."
"As an IPA this just ain't cutting it for me. Puzzling really. Even as an English style? As an amber this could be something worth while. As a beer to drink and enjoy its still a bit underwhelming and plain though. Likeable, but passable, yet better then most. One of those right-in-the-middle brews."
"Pours a hazy orange brown, big off white head forms, laces well. Smell is citrus and floral hops, some toffee notes. Taste is sweet caramel,orange, then a citrus/grapefruit/pine hop blast near the end, with some nice bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, high to medium carbonation, pretty good."
"Pours a nice amber-copper color with a very full tannish/white head. There is quite a bit of bubble action, ascending, very visibly throughout the glass. A really nice looking beer. It smells nice and hoppy. A bit biting to the nostrils at first, then followed by citrus aromas with a hint of floral presence as well. Somewhat bouquet-like. Again very impressive. This is a sharp, bitter tasting IPA. Most obvious are malt and hops. Followed by citrus. The bitter aftertaste here, is not what I expect from a British style IPA, but not as caustic as other highly hopped Americans. In the mouth Arcadia is crisp, and pretty highly carbonated. Bitterness remains on the tongue for a while. Overall, I am pleasantly surprised by this beer. Again, for a British style it provides more hops than one would expect. A very good session brew, that will not scare off non-hop heads."
"This is one of my favorite session beers. Drinkability is therefore very high in my book!"
"Thick, and I mean oily thick IPA here folks. Not a whimpy IPA in the least. This bitch kicks ass and takes names. Not for the ""eh yeah, I guess I like hops sometimes"" crowd. This is a solid IPA brew."
"Pretty light body for an IPA, rather PA like, with a light copper color. Head is almost non-existant, even after an aggresive pour. Very nice smell, though. Lots of grapefruit ad citrus to enjoy, like straight up lemon juice. Taste is rahter displeasing. Flavors are bitter and hoppy, but also sour and unpleasent. Lots of hops, though, which makes this beer drinkable. Still, much better IPAs exist."
"Dark amber appearance and essentially clearish. Milky head, clings to the glass in pretty nice partial Belgian lace patterns. Flowery aroma, almost similar to a cheap cologne. Pretty full in body, the carbonation is there but quite low in its assertion. First impression nice flavors in some aspects, especially at first (it gets a bit annoying) -- thick and malty but buttery with caramel. Its IPA status may be confirmed by aromatic floral notes that almost verge on candyish overall. Seems schizophrenic in many ways, diacetyl in character and thickish, the English hop profile doesn't quite drag it back and it seems overall odd for the style in a number of ways."
"Its sessionable, but nothing special overall."
"Tasted: 05/27/05"
"This beer has the beginnings of a great IPA but it can't put everything together and balance. The appearance was really nice with a crisp deep golden color with a furiously sticky white head. This baby left lacing all over the glass. The aroma was also very nice and was one of the best ""fresh"" smelling hop smells that I have come across. The problem is in the taste and mouthfeel. The hops come across too harsh and make the beer unbalanced. I love hops with a passion, but I think the flavoring hop choice (which I cannot pinpoint) may have been a mistake. Overall, this is a decent IPA, but not a refridgerator staple by any means."
"Malt is big and rich enough, a caramel character carries through...with fruity rind dripping over...very nice ale, I applaud Arcadia for it."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mellow carbonation. Quite easy to drink. I could have a few of these no problem...it's a nice, enjoyable English IPA."
"Lets hope this is better than their nut brown. This pours a hazy peachy color with a small head that falls to coat the top of the liquid. The nose is a light citrusy combination of orange and grapefruit. Its just okay. The flavor is decent. The orangey quality is big and there is a slight peppery hop in there as well. The feel is a light moderate. Not as thick as I would like it to be. Overall, this is an average beer. Nothing really grabs me and draws me in."
"The taste was good. I still kept getting green apple vibrations from her for the fruit aspect. A smooth to bitter shift followed up by a tongue stinging sweet faded into a minimal aftereffect of bitterness. This girl isn't as surly as some of her cousins from the American school, but she seems to be above her competition over on the English side. I like it. I had this one a long while ago before the madness began. I thought I would revisit her and jot down some memoirs. Still as good as I remembered."
"Pours a hazy golden orange with a foamy eggshell colored head. I was surprised to see some sediment floating around after the pour. The sediment settles to the bottom, it looks like small chunks of yeast. I don't really like that - it looks like wet sand in the bottom of my glass. Smell is grassy with pine and citrous hops (lots of grapefruit). Some smooth malt, though not much, is present in the nose. Taste begins on a bland note, then fast forwards to some eye squinting astringency. While I usually like high IBU American IPAs, this brew's taste seems to focus too much on that bitter grapefruit/pine flavor and lacks the cleaner hop bitterness that I crave. On the upside, the mouthfeel is creamy and the finish is pleasantly dry."
"received as selection of brew-of -the -month club.Poured a a nice amber color with slightl head. Mild slightly sweet taste with touch of hops. Enough flavor to enjoy without being over powering. Good taste in mouth that remains for a while. Would like to try again"
"Sampled on tap In Ann Arbor , MI., Poured honey/apricot amber, tiny bubble head and then film, left a delicate coating of fine lacing, nice. Grainy, leafy hop nose. Medium bodied IPA, lots of grainy hop flavor. NIce malt counterpoint adds up a balanced, smooth drinking ale. Slightly watery in the center, but finishes with more hops flavor flowing on the tongue. Pleasant sessioner."
"Poured a hazy light amber color, with a small white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops. Low carbonation and smooth medium mouthfeel. Taste starts out a little weak, but finishes with a good taste of hops which fades fast. Overall a very drinkable IPA, but nothing spectacular."
"This is an okay IPA. It is not a standout. I might recommend it to someone who is exploring different beers as a starting point. This would NOT be a beer I would offer one of my hop head friends."
"The Beer of the Month club brought me this surprisingly nice IPA. poured great copper color with nice head, lacing and carbonation. Coming off a cold, I did not distinguish the cascade hops noted in other reviews. Taste and mouthfeel was very hoppy with a stinging sensation on the tongue, respectively. Easy down the throat. One of the better IPAs I've tried in quite some time. Not for the light beer drinker, though."
"Pours a clear copper with a large peaky off-white head. Leaves a moderate blanket of foam with pretty persistent lacing. Smells of fresh and spicy citrus hops with piney undertones. Quite weak initial flavor that develops a somewhat astringent grapefruit and pine hop taste. Nicely bitter finish however. Mouthfeel is a touch light and a bit under-carbonated in my opinion. Easy drinking, but with a disappointingly limited and restrained flavor. Slightly above-average overall."
"There is a good blast of cascade in the nose. The 3 hops used give the character a great depth of smell and taste of the almighty hop spectrum. The English malts really give this thing some good shoulders too, and just a touch of sweetness in the middle. This is surprisingly full bodied, with a slight oiliness clinging in the end. I didn't really have any expectations of this beer. What I got was a hell of an English IPA that I strongly recommend."
"This was a good IPA although a little different than your typical traditional one. I found it to have an unexpected floral or citrus aroma with a very subdued hops taste for an IPA. There was a little bit of honey in the flavor and the mouthfeel didn't zing like a a traditional IPA either which made it very drinkable. Not bad. I would most certainly have it again."
"This isn't an over-the-top IPA but a well blended interesting IPA."
"not too drinkable, it is okay for a one or two beer session but i'm not drinking these all night."
"Drinkability is OK. It is an unoffensive beer that doesn't seem to try to hard."
"Have to note the excellent lacing. Aroma is lightly hoppy, with some sweetness apparent as well. Taste is not as hoppy as I would expect, even for the usually more sedate EIPA. Seems more generic bitterness than hops character. Mouthfeel is ok, that bitterness kind of knocks it down for me, but the brew remains drinkable. Not a bad brew, but not one I'd be shaking the BA trade tree for..."
"Appearance: Copper slightly hazed tone with a full bubbly cream tinted head leaves impressive patches of well dispersed lacing. Aroma: Herbal, floral, and citrus mixture of hops with a tone of nutty caramel malt sweetness chiling there. Taste: Bitter upfront with a citrus twang absorb most of the malts here not as English as I was expecting. Hop flavors are muted a bit by the bitterness I feel that there many other IPAs out there I would go for over this one. Mouthfeel: Medium body slightly sticky enjoyable but a bit forgettable evenly carbonated can't complain too much. Drinkability: A beer that I was happy to try, but I can't say I will miss having a steady supply of this one."
"I feel like I'm being generous here, maybe it's that golf course thing."
"Pours with an orange hue, has a huge head and excellent lace. Smell of hoppy citrus - definate cascades here. Tatse is quite nice as an American IPA goes. I'm not a huge hop head and this one is nice, verry hoppy but not too much. Nice citrusy, lemony flavors. Nice carbonation. Nice malty fiish - a bit chewy. A good buy."
"Sunset orange, slightly cloudy with a lightly hazed orange head. Bold hoppy nose that blasts like a tidal wave the minute the glass nears the nose, heavy. Lemon, and cascade hops swell to a storm leaving no taste bud untouched. Finishes nicely with a smooth flow of malt, a hint of molasses. Fantastic.Slick oily mouthfeel, vague chewiness and a clean finish makes this an excellent brew for anytime."
"staring at it in the glass i see a cloudy, orange soda colored brew. A dense, off white head at the beginning that settled slightly but stayed until the end. Lacing was good, left rings in the glass. Smell was of a typical IPA, spicy and citrusy. Taste was tart (grapefruit taste), with hints of an unidentifiable spice. Good though. has a nice bite to it. Mouthfeel was medium, stuck in your mouth if that makes sense. Finish was dry and tart. One of the better IPAs i have had. ill keep it around if i can get ahold of a few bottles."
"Another run of the mill brew from Arcadia, a local that has yet to blow me away."
"Pours an orangish-copper with a rocky white head. Mild aroma of pine, grapefruity citrus, peach, cookie, & sugar. Caramel flavored malt base with moderate bitterness. Interesting blend of citrus hops with candied sugar & a soapy flavor that approaches unpleasant. Medium bodied with active carbonation. Finishes dry with spicy/peppery hops and some toasty malt. Not one I would seek out."
"Like many IPAs, this one grabs me by the tounge and begs me to drink more. Wish I had some more, actually. Good stuff."
"A very interesting beer to look at, with fine sediment in suspension in the golden body. Thick head, left chunky lace as it receeded to a thin filmy covering. Piny, with a touch of malt as you stick your nose in the glass. The hop profile starts a bit watery, but ends nicely hoppy, with a good piney bite. Slightly tangy, it feels like drinking a beer, nothing too different there. Overall, a nice beer."
"Murky looking orange. Very thin off white head. Lacing is minimal. The aroma is very fragrant. Minty. Lots of bubblegum. Piney. Decent, but not exactly what I'm looking for in the nose of an IPA. The flavor is full of bubblegum. Some pine sap as well. A bit of an astringent bitterness. Malt base is primarily toffeeish and a little biscuity. This one is striking me as much better than average. And that's being generous."
"I do think this beer is worth trying and some might really like it...I personally wouldn't buy it again but I have 2 bottles left and I will certainly drink and enjoy those enough..."
"Drinkability - It'll do in a pinch."
"Great looking beer with golden body, slightly hazy with a bit of fine sediment suspended stirred up by my ham fisted pour. Very clean, pronounced hop aroma. Grassy, citrucy, and a slight maltiness in the aroma. Flavor is slightly malty with a healthy dose of hops. While the primary focus is on the hops there is an appropriate malt base. Well balanced and quite drinkable."
"Not a bad IPA from Arcadia. It's not an imperial monster, but just the nice everyday drinking type. I'd be happy to see Arcadia's beers in Western PA...someday, I hope."
"Overall, this struck me as a relatively likeable IPA but nothing awe-inspiring. The flavors didn't mesh as well as with other IPA's I've sampled. That said, this offering from Arcadia's is a mid-level entry in the IPA style."
"Poured a hazy orange color with a moderate off white head. Smell almost seemed bready to me. This was definitely a more balanced IPA. I think it is really more of a pale ale. Hops were there but faint. I noticed more caramel flavor and some buttery diacetyl. Hops seemed to provide a base and were estery and floral. This one was also somewhat thin in body. A good introduction IPA and nothing more."
"This might be a good IPA to initiate newbies who are interested in learning about real beer and leaving the mass production stuff."
"Pours a orange/golden color with a white foamy head. Head lingers for some time. This beer was not cloudy, instead you could see a suspension of particles. Not a great look. Smells of citrusy hops. Tastes slightly sweet malt with a dry hoppy finish. Perhaps a little thin. Something about this just didn't seem right. Not a horrible beer by any means, but I was hoping for better."
"Not a great beer, but not all bad either. Actually maybe a preferred pick for those gradually making the step up from pales to IPA's."
"A solid example of an IPA, yet for more missing just a little bit of something to make it memorable."
"Arcadia IPA: Nice thick, clinging head that is slightly off-white. Hazy, nica tan color. This is a nice looking beer. The aroma is sweet and flowery, clearly nice hopped for flavor. And the taste is pleasant, and I've not been the biggest fan of Arcadia brews. Nicely hopped brew, not bitter but floral, somewhat citrus flavors as well. Very well balanced as well, there are nice bready malt flavors that come through as well. I enjoy this beer."
"The beer pours a slightly muzzy deep amber color with the head portly in size, frothy in texture and a winsome tan color, lace is a thick and clinging curtain to obscure the glass. Nose is floral with a slightly musky malt backing; crisp and inviting, front is nicely malted, somewhat sweet and the top medium in body. Finish is loaded with the Fuggles hop spicy bite, crisply acidic and a fine example of an American IPA."
"Medium gold color. Medium head. Aroma is floral hops and malts. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are nutty and slightly sweet. Hops are floral and a touch resiny. Not too bitter for an IPA. Nicely balanced, slightly towards the hops. AH Fuggels.. Slightly orangish taste. Interesting beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"This Michigan IPA pours a hazed copper color. A rocky head forms, leaving subtle trails of lace down the glass. The nose is lively with notes of fruity esters, citric Cascades, and very minor caramel malt. Taste-wise, pronounced Cascade and Columbus hops overpower what little caramel malt profile exists in this brew. Don't get me wrong, I love my hops, but this needs a bit more balance malt-wise. Finish is dry with lingering hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin due to the lack of sturdy maltiness. As a fan of hops, I could drink quite a bit of this, but overall, I think it's a bit too hop-heavy to be considered a classic. Very good, though, nonetheless."
"A good part aftertaste, Arcadia IPA is a tough beer to love. But it's fun, so what the hell? Disturbingly spot-on in appearance, it's head is a magnificent exercise in grandeur -- thick, off-white, aromatic. Bitter citrus aromas. Lavender. Lacks malt character -- or any character really -- up front, but annhiliates the palate with a destructive hop endgame. If only it had more backbone or more flavor in the midpalate, it wouldn't seem so overwhelming. It's probably not, really. In short: Could be better, could be worse. The Michigan IPA to try if you're looking for something a little unusual. Never disappointing locally in terms of bottling or skunkiness."
"Deep hazy orange-copper color, huge frothy off-white head that clings to the side of my glass, sweet citrusy hop aromas, resiny grapefruit flavors, some what thin with a watery mouthfeel and a bit unbalanced it is lacking malt balance, finishes harshly bitter."
"Semi-clear golden bronze color with an average tight, white head that disappears quickly but nonetheless clings nicely. Distinct floral hops smell is pleasant but light, given its domination of the nose. Some lightly toasted malts are detectable as well. Hops are on the tongue from start to finish--more bitter than most IPAs I've had. Citrusy flavor is pleasant but needs more balance. The intense hoppy flavor aside, this beer comes across as somewhat watery, like Arcadia's pale ale."
"Pours a good, white head that leaves a lot of lace. Hops throughout, the malts are trying to come through but just don't make it. Don't get me wrong this a good IPA, light to medium bodied - I just don't like them. Bitter finish with a lingering aftertaste."
"Light bronze in hue with a slight murk. Impressively thick, stiff, off white head retains well and leaves densely patterned lace. The aroma is a combination of sweet, tangerine citrus and ripe peach esters interlaced with pine sap. Malt character is only of a muffled light biscuit note... but it works. Incipient light lovibond caramel malt sweetness in flavor persists transiently until offset by a perfumed, slightly soapy, drying hop bitterness. Constituent pale malt breadiness persists as a functional undertone. Hop flavor gains structure late, being composed of tame sweet citrus zest with a peppery edge. Lightly bodied overall and well attenuated, (perhaps overly so) and passably dextrinous in mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly bittersweet, with fleeting hints of pink grapefruit and refined sugar. Arcadia IPA is an odd, nearly esterless brew somewhere between a standard American pale and west coast IPA in overall character. It's somewhat of a jack of all trades and a master of none, but quite likeable nonetheless. Innocuously good."
"Poured a golden orange color with a large head that had good retention. The aroma was very hopped, definite of the IPA style. The taste was very smooth, with a full hop bite just like the aroma suggests. Although very bitter and hoppy tasting, this brew goes down smooth and easy and is very refreshing. The head stayed around for almost the entire glass and left plenty of lace on the way down. If I had to compare this to more well known beers, I would say it is a cross between a Sierra Nevada PA and a Harpoon IPA."
"Ever slightly hazy golden color with a thin yet dense head, lace ringed the glass to the end. The smell was bready and mild. The taste was amazing. Initial taste was smooth and refreshing, becoming sweet and floral bitter in the middle. the finish was mildly sweet with a citrus floral hoppiness that lingered pleasantly. Very drinkable beer."
"Well, it looks great. Big ivory head crowns the hazy amber body very nicely. The head retains well and laces with gusto. Very nice. The nose gives some nice hints of citrus and cranks in some hoppiness. The first taste sensation is of sourness, not like citrus sour, but like mash sour. Hops kick in an unabashed way to create a harsh, bitter finish. This is over the top, not so much in total hopping, but rather in poor balance of the hops among themselves. Mostly a grapefruit sense, but not one that's clean and neat. Not a beer I'd drink very often or with great relish."
"Overall pretty good, I won't turn it down and may seek it out again."
"Pours with a nice foamy head that quicky settles to about 2mm. Taste is bright and crisp with strong hops bite, but it quickly dissipates and the flavor gets thin. This was my first IPA two years ago, but I find the logical progression took me to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and then to Bell's Two Hearted Ale for the high water mark of a well-balanced IPA style brew. As others have said in prior reviews, this is a great ""starter IPA," which is good advice. Overall, a quality brew for those who appreciate a strong hop presence."
"This beer is quite a treat - its very difficult to find a good English-style IPA in this area. Special thanks to my little sister for bringing this one from Michigan."
"Golden caramel in color, slight chill haze, really very clear considering it's not filtered..bits of yeast swimming like fish in a sea of beer. Forms a white, rocky 2-finger head which sticks around and forms nice lace...meringue peaks on top of LARGE bubbles. Fairly well carbonated. Aroma is of cascade hops, but has a certain Tettnang/Hallertauer spiciness, esters, a lemony sourness, and..what is that?...bavarian wheat yeast? Interesting!. Smells quite nice, gets the salivary glands working overtime. Taste is rough around the edges...I think the hopping could be better...it is a bit more hoppy in bitterness than in flavor, and the finish is somewhat astringent. Basically, it has an amateur homebrew taste to it, but a knockout aroma. I'll stick to Bell's Two-Hearted Ale, my favorite IPA."
"A very enjoyable IPA. Not as good as a Bell's Two-Hearted or Victory, but still delicious. Aroma is that of pine and grapefruit with a nice, bitter hop presence. This would be a decent session IPA as it is easy to drink."
"Golden with a slight orange core and a hazy appearance. Very creamy one fingered head sits on top. Smells of grapefruit. How many ways can I describe an IPA? Citrusy grapefruit taste without too much bitterness. Not the beer for you if you are looking for a very bitter IPA. It is the 2nd best bottled IPA from Michigan that I can recall. Bell's Two Hearted gets my first place vote."
"Part of and Arcadia sampler: This is a decent IPA but really doesn't compare to some of the better ones I have had lately (Ruination, 90 Minute etc). Dark murky orange/copper color with a thin off-white head. Very thin lacing. Aroma was somewhat hoppy (are those fuggles?) with a little citrus. Flavor was hoppy with a light malt balance and a light toasty finish. While on the weak side there was really nothing offensive going on here. This would probably be a good starter IPA."
"Buttery and hoppy aroma was found to come from this copper-colored brew. It was solftly carbonated and had a decent head. Fruity hop flavor weighed in heavy against the soft malt in this IPA. This beer had a hard water aftertaste."
"The color was a  copperish gold, but the head was small due to how they poured it and only formed a small white head with not lace. The aroma was of hops and slightly of citrus. The flavor was malt, hops with a hint of a burnt citrus?. There was a nice hop bitterness to the finish.  Not as good as some of the others, but a good beer."
"Hazy, marmalade color with a dense ivory head that drops to a collar but leaves some good lace. The nose displays notes of fruitiness and lightly sweet malt. I think there may be some citrusy hop contributing to the fruity aroma but it's unclear. The body is medium-light and smooth with a creamy mouthfeel and just a light zest on the tongue. This beer takes a turn for the better at tasting, revealing much more character than the appearance or aroma does. Bright hop flavor hits the tongue first, mellowing into a gently fruity malt at the middle, and finishing with an agreeable, long lasting dryness. As you progress through the tasting the malt and hop flavors trade places, playing off each other, always complimentary. Not a big or complex I.P.A, but one with a great balance and interplay of flavors."
"This IPA has a prominent grassy grapefruit aroma and mellow pale golden color.  Subtle butter flavor and a strong but smooth bitter quality round off a nice representation."
