3.84,8.5,3.5,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"This very unfiltered beer ends up quite hazy in the glass with a dull copper color and an off white head that laces nicely.  The smell is dominated by light floral and grassy hop notes with a base of crystal and biscuit malt.  While on the tip of the tongue, caramels and biscuity malt shine through but are quickly replaced by a strong bitter character that doesn't come with much in the way of hop flavor other than perhaps some floral spice.  At the finish this is quite puckeringly bitter which lingers nicely inviting the next sip.  Moderate to high carbonation and the lack of an overly sweet malt character make this lively in the mouth.  Overall this is a pretty good English IPA, quite different from the more common American style that we've all grown so accustomed to.  It is nice to get a taste of something a little different like this every once in a while to remind you how IPAs started out.","fank2788","Jan 02, 2015"

The sweetness balanced with the mild bitter is really nice. The body is fantastic along with the mouthfeel. This is a really enjoyable IPA. I would definitely drink more or share them. This is a beer that an early IPA padawan might like - as they develope their palate. It is a good intro to the style - without being a hop bomb.","fscottkey","Jul 22, 2014"

I get just a touch of grapefruit in the finish. there is a ton of body here, a few of these is ample. nice carbonation and clean finish give it some drinkability though. ive learned that even well made versions of English ipas are not my favorite. this is one of the few times ill ever be patriotic, but the American ipa style, to me, is a much more enjoyable brew than even the best of the English persuasion. this would be a textbook example of the style though, and is worthy of higher praise.","StonedTrippin","Jul 01, 2013"

Aromas of subtle sweet caramel, resiny, fresh hops, and a light, citrus highlight. Smells very well balanced and very palatable. Flavors are light, with a resiny and peppery hop forward presence that is quickly followed by a light, sweet malt backbone. Much lighter flavors than the aromas lead you to believe. Very smooth and balanced, and very drinkable. Citrus highlights join the party at the end of the palate, and the blend goes right into the aftertaste, with the citrus and spicy hops holding most of the flavor profile at that point. Very tasty and well blended. Light bodied throughout, but still manages to support the flavors. Resiny, slightly bitter finish that dries the mouth. Very tasty IPA.","GarthDanielson","Nov 25, 2012"

Yeah, on the taste you don't get nearly as much hop taste as you should. It tastes fairly watered down to be honest. Instead of a lot of hops it just tastes like water with a little sweetness and a little malts, and then a tiny tiny bit of hops. This should not be considered an IPA.

Things are downplayed, though, compared to a lot of IPAs, and the major effect is one of light, sweet malts with a light dose of hops in the background that lighten the proceedings and give an impression of aromatic suspension. On the palate, malt sweetness first off before the hops come through midway in. From the middle to the end, there's an excellent integration of hops and malt, with each one showing its character while meshing with the other. Well done.

Things improve as the beer settles, but the opening act is critical for me. That said, the appearance is the high note. The beer is a nice amber, with a bubbly white head, moderately carbonated, medium bodied, a bit syrupy in consistency, and well balanced. You will get some grapefruity, slightly tangy hop tastes balanced against some bready sweet malts, maybe some dextrin malts. The aftertaste is mild, and this is a drinkable beer, but not brilliant.

The aroma just adds to the suspense with an incredible carmel and butterscotch sweetness mixed with malt. The hops are a little tough to detect in the aroma, but there is some piney presence, but it smells like it's more toward a brown ale than an IPA. But then the first taste brings out a unique blend of the bitter hops and the creamy butterscotch. Good stuff. It has a slick and silky feel, full bodied, milkshake-like. Just a slight bite from the hops but for the most part this is a mellow mouthful of complex flavor. This is a great change of pace in the world of quality IPA's.

Bitter lemon iced tea flavors and the unmistakable flowery, herbal aroma and bitter taste of Hallertauer hops mix well with the perfectly malted barley aromas and flavors that include caramel and toasted grain. A slight alcohol warmth rounds out the flavor. Great head, lace and carbonation, which is smooth to creamy show this really is a well crafted brew.

Taste is very bitter-oriented, not as much bright hop flavor. The flavor that is there has a sour, kind of burny character that I think I was smelling. I kind of disagree with the characterization of this beer as an American-style IPA; it may use American hops, but the bitter-balance and relatively tame hop taste make it seem more like one of the Brits.

I do recommend that you eat at least one hops cone in your life, just to see what it's like and to say that you did, but I can't recommend that you try this beer.

Starts apricot sweet and malty with a hint of caramle. A faint hop bitter comes in the middle carrying hop orange and woody qualities. Grassy cohumulone is low. Immediately after swallowing, I get a moment of grapefruit hop, but this quickly changes to a more metallic and woody hop that starts the aftertaste. The aftertaste is more bitter than during the taste and is accompanied by a pleasing gentle caronbation sting on the whole flat of my tongue. Md mouthfeel and mildly cabonated. The final sips were taken after allowing the beer to warm a while. Grapoefruit pith is more prevalent and hits earlier.

It's solid malt base is peppered with grassy and spicy hops; and it's delicately zesty carbonation and solid bitterness help to bring that spiciness out before it fades into a long lasting, bitter end.

Taste - well, if I didn't know better, I'd say this beer had some wheat in it. But other than a body that was a bit too light, the beer is quite hoppy and a good session beer.

It is a batch of only four barrels called Cask Conditioned Wolvers IPA and from what I was told they where aged/matured in Chardonnay Barrels. It definitely had the qualities of the Wolvers IPA but also did poses a Chardonnay like aroma and taste. The brew held up nicely in the growler for a few days and when poured had a slightly cloudy orange/yellow color with a nice sized white head that had pretty good retention and left a fair amount of lacing. The aroma had a very robust hop scent that did dominate but you where able to pick up notes of malt and toffee and the Chardonnay aroma that I talked about before. The taste was also dominated by the hops but did seem to be more refined than with the initial smell. The hop flavors are of pine and citrus but I feel that the pine notes win out. Also notice some nice fruit like characteristics that go well with the hop taste, also notice a pretty good amount of malt that balances it out quite well. I must say that this was a good brew, wish that I lived closer to Middlebury to try some of the other brewery specific concoctions!

The head did dissipate some leaving a nice edge layer around the top of the beverage. Taking a few whiffs, I was pleasantly suprised to find that this IPA was not all hops as I had suspected, but had more hints of fruit (white grapes or plums) and even had some semblance of chocolate in there somewhere, which I found very intriguing. Slight alcohol tingled my nosehair a bit as well, which is always fun for me when I drink a beer! TAking a sip, it came to my palette very sweet natured, with little hops at first. The white grapes really jumped out at the tip of my tongue w/ some sugary taste, but then gave way to a nice earthy hops flavor that covered my palette on back until the swallow. Upon swallowing, this left a nice sweet floweriness (if I can describe it any better) and left a nice grassy aftertaste reminding me of cut grass in spring or summer! One knock on this one was the feel of it however. It's high carbonation beat on my palette pretty hard, and it never really gives way until the swallow, which may have taken away from some of the flavor. However, I got much more than I expected from this one, and it was a very nice crispy ale w/ a sneaky little 6.5% alcohol that I would recommend to just about anyone!","Fish113d","Jan 19, 2005"

The beer itself is quite light, in color and maltiness, to make way for a hop showcase that is neither flashy nor gaudy. Just a brisk, enjoyable crispness and a bit of grapefruity prickle. A solid beer, not very characterful, but definitely tasty. I would like perhaps a somewhat larger malt profile, but this is a minor quibble. I first had a Wolaver beer a few years ago and thought it was insipid, lacking flavor, perhaps due to the organic ingredients. This is happily not the case now. I don't know if they have improved their craft or if it was the switch to Otter Creek in Middlebury, VT, but this beer has as much substance as need be.","Thrasher","Oct 14, 2004"
3.18,-10.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"This is a fairly mild IPA. I expected more from Otter Creek. It pours a dark golden color with a medium head and little lacing. There is more of the malt in the nose than the hops that I expected. It is a nice rounded pale ale but not what I was expecting from an American IPA. Where are the hops?","rdrummer","Sep 28, 2004"
4.22,19.2,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pleasant floral smell. I enjoyed this thoroughly. Good white head on top. Taste is good bitter with light floweriness. Not much malt sweetness, but malt presence is noticeable. Much more of a Britishy IPA than an American IPA. This is a great session brew if you're into pale ale.","benmiliron","Aug 17, 2004"
3.4,-4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"An American IPA much more English in character pours a medium golden with an average head that left a little lace,aroma is leafy and lightly herbal with a dry biscuity malt hint.Taste is really subtle a little minty and herbal with the dry malt coming thru more as I drank more.Iam not a hop head but when drinking an American IPA would like more hop presence,not horrible by any mean just seems a little off.","oberon","Jul 03, 2004"
3.3,-6.8,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pale golden amber body and a thin head. The bubbles rising up from the sides of the glass are pretty large, almost like soda bubbles. Dried apricots and grassy hops make up the bulk of the aroma. More apricots and grassy hops are found in the flavor wiht a bit of pepper.","aracauna","Jun 23, 2004"

The body is slightly malty with slight citrus and pine. It is hoppy and bitter, but nothing that wows me. A solid beer that I could drink a few of, but it is average and I would not go out of my way for it again.","ark57","May 27, 2004"

3.88,9.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Great stuff, a solid american IPA. I haven't had great experiences with organic beers, but Wolaver's makes a credible brew with this one. Tasty hops, which linger in the aftertaste for hours. Yum.","UnionMade","May 05, 2004"
3.17,-10.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,3,"I was really excited about trying this one for some reason. Maybe because it is made with all organic ingredients. Pours an orange coppery color with very little head. The lace is there for a while then slowly dissipates. The taste is surprising at first in that it sort of hits your pallette with something different. Bitter with an orange peel flavor. Very hoppy. This is a good beer and for me it was a different taste. I think over time and a few more bottles, I will find it to be better than average.","abcsofbeer","Apr 23, 2004"
4.07,15,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Emerges from the bottle with a gently rocky white head, slowly settling out on clear and bright golden liquid. Nose is sweet malt and fresh hop flowers with a touch of grassiness. The taste is first sweet, then a growing bitterness asserts itself. Bitterness abounds without really dominating the palate, just flowery with a definate hop punch. Light fruity yeast esters noted at this point. Finshes bittersweet and somewhat clean, with an ultra slight alcohol tinge at the end yet superbly drinkable. More flavorsome than looks would lead you to believe.","beerluvr","Mar 22, 2004"

3.18,-10.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"My second Wolavers beer. A 12 oz bottle that pours a deep rusty beige coloured brew with a small, fluffy, white head. The aromas are of grains, and light hops. The taste is malty, with some hops in the middle, and a dry, grainy finish. The mouthfeel is thin, because this brew is just too grainy. The drinkability is OK, but this is more of a decent pale ale, than an IPA. Plus the graininess is just a bit much for my taste buds.","francisweizen","Feb 09, 2004"

4.07,15,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"The mouthfeel is smooth and dry. Medium bodied. The bitterness rides the tongue softly for several seconds. Extremely drinkable and solid IPA I will look for again.","Gavage","Jan 22, 2004"
4,13,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a cloudy golden with a copper tinge without too much head to be seen. Smell was buttery and nutty with leafy floral hops and a dosage of caramel to round out with some sweetness. Taste was very crisp and hoppy with a good amount of pine flavors and a more butterscotch and nutty finish but not overly so. Mouthfeel was creamy as it warmed. Another good offering from the Wolaver line.","GreatPondBrewer","Jan 13, 2004"

3.72,5.1,4,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Startlingly clear with very little head, there's a strong maltiness to the aroma, almost overpowering the hops--it is a kind of tart bubble-gum smell. I'm intrigued. The taste: completely unexpected; there is no sharpness at all, instead there is a muted bitterness balanced with a slight malty backbone--very much like a light Eastern IPA (closer to the English style but without the creamy thickness). A thin mouthfeel. This was a bit of a disappointment after such a promising start, I'm afraid.","longpondbeerman","Dec 29, 2003"
3.71,4.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The light amber body supports a huge billowing head of off-white, creamy foam. The good retention guarantees superior lacing and even when it lessens the lace is outstanding. The nose is surprisingly more malty than hoppy, giving fine caramel notes. The flavor is lightly hopped along the English style and with very fine balance between the malt sweetness and hop bitterness. a very good dry finish with a very nice mouthfeel. Good session brew, for sure.","AtLagerHeads","Dec 21, 2003"
3.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This is a nice IPA - true to style and easy to drink. It doesn't wow you or leave you dissapointed at all, just a good drinking IPA. Pours a murky pale orange with minimal head. good fruity, citrusy nose and a decent, though somewhat thin mouthfeel. Decent dry tangy residual aftertatse, classic IPA aftertaste. Overall well balanced beer with decent drinkability. I like the organic "angle" and it is priced similar to the other craft IPAs. I think it would be better if bottle conditioned. Why the heck not support some organic farmers.. enjoy it!","counselor","Dec 21, 2003"

4.1,15.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"By the time I near the bottom of the pint I'm appreciating the mouthfeel more. First it hits me with a pleasingly creamy wave that's somewhere between woody and nutty. This gradually gives way to a tingly, bitter middle which in turn eases into a tart, crisp, dry, hoppy finish. As a bonus, it not only changes during each sip; its taste evolves during the course of a pint. As I drain this one I gradually taste less creaminess and more woodiness. I will be having more of these.","Weissenheimer","Dec 12, 2003"
4.3,21.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Really nice rocky head and a nice burnt orange color. Nice nose of fresh zesty hops and buttery malt.

Very little carbonation rising up to the top. The malt aroma is kind of funky. It's pretty sweet smelling, no hops, grape juice, it smells like artificial grape juice. That's just wrong. It has a born on date of 8/5/03 so I don't think it's too old. Holding my nose the taste continues with the malt trend, a little bit of caramel in there, and even less hops. The aftertaste lightly bitter, with just a touch of metal. There's definitely something wrong with this beer, but even so I don't see this being all that great.","HappyHourHero","Nov 10, 2003"

Very crisp in taste, this beer. Sharp pine resin and citric hop tones hit me first. Then the bitterness, which is quite noticeable and enjoyable. The malt foundation is toffee, toasted and biscuity. There's actually a slight lingering sweetness to the aftertaste if you look hard enough. Body is about medium and mouthfeel is carbonated nicely. Solid effort here.","Bighuge","Nov 05, 2003"

This beer had a medium sized ivory head that mostly dissipated with fine-medium sized bubbles. The body was clear with fine carbonation and an orange-gold hue. The nose was malt and hops with a very bitter taste to it. The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth, dry textured and medium bodied. This IPA was just way too bitter tasting for me.","hotstuff","Oct 30, 2003"

There is a bit of a piney aroma surrounding it along with a hint of Carapils malts. The taste is really good. It is hops all the way. The beer is quite bitter and flavorful. There is a strong hop content in this one. Yeah Hah! The beer has a med mouthfeel and is a sessions beer no doubt. Wolavers (Otter Creek) make a few good brews.

3.56,0.6,4,3,3.5,4,4," Not as complex and malty as the draft version but still an above average IPA. German hops are a unique twist I dont particularly care for. I liked it much better on tap. More sweetness and balance along with fuller mouth feel and less carb bite.","Shiredave","Jul 14, 2003"

Medium-bodied with a nice mix of hops, citrus and light malt. Not as hoppy as most of the better IPAs out there but not a wasted attempt either. The finish is bitter although it fades throughout the glass. I'd get it on draught again.","Dogbrick","Jul 06, 2003"
3,-15.3,3,3,3,3,3,"This pours a clear strawberry blonde tinged with orange. The head is pretty nice nd thick falling to leave a complex lacing down the glass. The nose is very noticeable on this one. More like a light fruity hop bouquet of flowers. The maltiness to the nose is very strong and fruity. The Flavor on this is a heavily contrasting and complex one on the palate. My first impression was What is going on, Then the hops come along and straighten you out. There is such a distinct contrast here between the sweet fruity malt and the extraordinarily bitter hops that leaves you with a pleasantly distinct beer. But sadly this is not a great beer.","AtrumAnimus","Jul 04, 2003"
2.68,-24.3,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,2,"Poured a very lightly oranged pale amber color; very odd hue to it. Had a decent amount of carbonation and nice thin head, though it looked a little strange to me, like a clumpy sort of foam. Not much lace. Its scent was dry and earthy in a "green" way, as the hops smelt bairly floral, more herbal. The scent almost had a malty sense to it but was funked out by the hops. The taste was bitter as usual but with a hardy earthy tone. It developed a light fruit taste, though again funked out. Pretty zingy on the tongue, its long finish shortened as my palate adjusted to the high IBUs and particular funky bent of this whole beer. The drinkability was decent, but in general it was too raw tasting, and so needs better honing of many parts of it. Cool idea to go organic, though - purity in beer is a great thing!!","nomad","Apr 17, 2003"
3.31,-6.5,4.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"This beer poured a copper amber color and formed a nice foamy white head that left thick circular lace as it subsided. Some carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, hops and a touch of caramel. The flavor was of malt, hops and caramel. The finish was a touch bitter. Okay, first off when it comes to IPAs, I confess, I am a "hop head". This beer had none of the characteristics that one usually finds in American IPAs. That being said, this beer didn't seem to even carry many found is a tradional English style. I don't know if this was in it's attempt to be organic, but for me, it fails for this style.","Wildman","Mar 27, 2003"
3.58,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Pours perfectly clear pale amber with a nice white head. This is an untra filtered brew. Hops is the first taste out of the gate. A nice malt balance keeps that in check. Not a hop head's IPA, but certainly not without its charm. Actually one of my favorite Otter Creek brews. I'm excited to see a brewery actually start up an organic line. I try to stay as organic as possible, but it's just so hard these days. I hope to see a Wolaver's Stout someday.","scottum","Mar 26, 2003"

3.38,-4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"There is a wonderful bitter hop flavor that dominates this brew. The malts are there, but they are hidden a bit until the grainy flavors come out just before the aftertaste. After the first few sips, I was not impressed with this brew, but after that it just got better. Citrus starts to come out of hiding adding to the crispness provided by the carbonation. The body is pretty light, but there is not a real lack of flavor. I was happy, to say the least with this brew. It is an interesting one that is certainly worth trying.","ElGuapo","Feb 23, 2003"
3.55,0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a slightly hazed golden/brown with a small white head that shrinks down to a lasting thin layer. Its smell consists of light hops and a burnt earthy grain. The taste mirrors the smell although the hops are more pronounced. It is light bodied and finishes with a dry hop bitterness. This beer is just a little bit too lightly hopped for an IPA, but still pretty tasty. It does however have a strange twang that I pick up in the after-taste albeit briefly. Aside from that, it is not a bad brew and it's organic. Cheers!","BeerAngel","Feb 01, 2003"
4,13,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a light to medium golden color with a tall creamy white head and has very good retention. The aroma is a grainy maltiness with notes of citrus and fresh baked bread.

Nice citrusy and slightly spicy bitterness that is well balanced by the established malt backbone.  There is a lingering tingly hop taste on the tongue for several minutes after drinking the beer.  The brew is slick and dry and very drinkable.  For my first few sips I wasn't crazy about the very abrupt change from malt to hop flavor in the taste, but with every sip I loved it more and more.  It definitely grew on me and I would suggest this to any hop heads.  As a not this one was brewed by Otter Creek in Vermont.","Murph","Apr 28, 2002"
