"o: A good British-style IPA which probably was not as fresh as it could be, thus little in the way of hop bite.  The slight sharp tartness is assumed to be from age."
"a lot better than i expected . smooth and rich for this style"
"A delightful English India Pale without the over hopping of an American IPA"

"O: I get the feeling this bottle's probably seen some shit, green bottle not helping things, but still, it's pretty rough overall. Neither the hops nor the malt give the impression that even in peak condition this would be much better. Not a fan of this one."
""
""
"O: Drinks more like a double IPA, albeit without the American hops, and only 5.5%. Very nice. I'm yet to have a bad one from this brewery. It's like a lighter version of Yorkshire Stingo. I think some of the other reviewers have been drinking old bottles."
""

"It's a good beer; very drinkable, but not a good IPA for an American palate."
""
""
""

"Fine, but surprisingly uninteresting beer from this top-grade brewer. Lacks sharpness and intrigue of more floral/American hops. Tastes like standard pub draught fare."

"Overall a great beer"

"My opinion of this beer may have been tainted by the fact that I was looking for a more modern, American IPA and this wasn't it, but you should definitely be warned that this is pretty far from what most people think of when they think of an IPA. Not an awful beer necessarily, but perhaps a little misleading."

"nice enough but have had better. I Like a good malty English IPA but this one lacked something in the aroma and flavour."
""
""
"Overall: A beer I'd have again. Tasty, toasty, and enjoyable. Still, the bitterness could be more pronounced for the style, and the diacetyl is this close to being a fault. It lends itself to the beer to a point, however, giving off a cozy, buttered toast impression."
""
""
"This is certainly an unusual one. It's different than any English IPA I've ever had. In fact, it tastes more like a German lager to me. It's enjoyable, but I wouldn't give it to someone wanting an EIPA experience. However, there is no question that the most wonderful thing about this beer is the gorgeous, flask-shaped bottle that contains it. I probably won't get it again."

"I see the potential in this to be a pleasant, solid English IPA, but unfortunately with no easy way for me to guarantee a fresh bottle it's really not worth the risk, and even fresh I don't know that it would be really anything great."

"Poured from a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass, unknown bottled date. This pours a slightly hazy brownish color with a smaller med lived head which leaves a lacing. There is a little green bottle skunk, rubbery smell, lots of malt, little hops. The feel is medium. The taste is okay, you have the skunk funk, some weird bitterness, but not quality hop bitterness followed by some malts."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - There just isn't much to say about this brew. It's not bad, per se, but it certainly isn't good. Not recommended to even try, if you have to pay for it. I think if you try it once, you'll decide that is enough. Just not interesting at all."
""
"O: Easy drinking British style session Ale. Could be better but still an honest one"
""
""
"Overall: kind of a plain beer, with not much to recommend it. It's not bad, but it's just kind of boring and uninspired."
"O- nice EIPA, nothing too amazing but a decent session beer."

"It was a good beer, but not one I'm in a hurry to get again."

"Green bottle from a local shop in Ann Arbor. Pours light golden with big fluffy white head. Aroma of skunk and hay, no hops to be found. Flavor follows with pure skunk flavor, dry finish, and a bit of hay. Mouthfeel is light. This is honestly one of the worst beers I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
""

"Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation."
"Overall: I bought this one because I have never tried it before and the bottle was quite intriguing, but I will pass up on their IPA again. I will try the other ones I saw like the cream stout from St. Peter's brewery in hopes that I like them more."
"The beer pours a deep orange color with a finger of white head. Not much lacing. The aroma is English hops, a faint floral scent. Biscuity malt and a bit of caramel are evident as well. Taste is of bready malt and caramel up front. Mildly citrusy hops enter mid-palate. The finish is semi-sweet with a lingering bitterness. Quite nice. The beer is medium bodied with a nice medium level of carbonation. This is a pretty enjoyable beer. Great malt backbone and tasty hop profile make it quite drinkable and refreshing. I'd have this again."
"D ~ This was very hard to drink until it warmed up substantially. I am a big fan of EIPAs, but Will definitely not revisit. I'm definitely thinking I got a lightstruck bottle...but why take the chance?"
"Definitely picking up a more pronounced hop profile on this bottle. The first time I had it I thought it was excellent, but not anything like the West Coast hop bomb IPA style that I’ve grown accustomed to—tho’ it did make me imagine that this was what a British-style (perhaps cask conditioned) IPA was actually like. Now I’m thinking the first bottle I had was just plain old. Thankfully not skunked. This is still great, but now with hops! Very citrusy, refreshing, light but flavorful hops."
"A pretty good IPA in keeping with the English style, and nicely balanced. I wish it had more aromatic hops to round out the bitterness. The diacetyl is palatable but a bit of a flaw. Worth trying, but I reckon there are better examples out there."
"7/24"
"O: The beer is easy to drink, but I wouldn’t consider it to be sessionable (despite the low alcohol content) because the taste doesn’t capture my interest long enough to have more than one of these in a sitting."
"Well well well. This beer really delivers where it has to. Seriously enjoyable and well made. Reinforcing my admiration for English ales, especially the ipa."
"Dark amber almost copper with white foamy head that stays around. Subtle aroma that's undeniably English: wood, herbal, dough reminiscent of unsweetened cookies, slight mugwort. Muggy flavors of herbs, dough, dirt and grass, soft malt sweetness makes an appearance, toffee, slight citrus note towards the finish with some welcomed hop presence. Dry and lasting bitterness. Thick body with light carbonation. This transports me to old England. I'm enjoying the trip."
"D: Very easy to drink. Could be sessionable since it won't overwhelm one's palate."
"Some bitterness in the tasting, otherwise kind of maple-like, acidic. Likely past it's prime, and barely even drinkable in this state. Beware of aged & light-struck bottles."
"Drinkability: Will be buying again and again. very nice beer."
"D- Very nice, a decent English IPA, could drink several of these."
"On-tap, this beer is a lot of fun. It's tastes extremely fresh and balanced, considering how much of a hops presence it really has. Most reviews are from the bottle and the average grade is spot on. A green bottle is no way to treat a beer as good as this."
"Aroma is quite strong and, surprisingly, more fruity than hoppy, having apple, pear and a hint of banana. It pours an average clear dark amber with a fairly thick, fluffy, off-white head. Flavor is hoppy, somewhat bitter, rather fruity and just a bit syrupy, quite different from most IPAs I have sampled - this is almost like a blend of an IPA and a cider. It has a yeasty, earthy undertone, and overall is rather satisfying. Texture is fairly smooth, just a little tingly, and a teeny bit slimy."
"D: This is a much appreciated trip in a glass across the pond for me into the history book of IPA and what it may have tasted like back in the day..."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all night. The balance of malt to hops is much more even compared to American IPA counterparts. This is definitely a beer on my list of ""I wish I could try this on nitro!"" beers. I drank this while eating homemade curried lentils. It was a fantastic pairing!"
"Notes - This beer is slightly below average. Its not horrible. Then again its just not where it should be."
"D- Sweet and bitter at the same time, nothing special."
"Will not purchase this again. Have enjoyed St. Peter's brews, but not this one."
"Good moderately high carbonation."
"Big mouthfeel. Light carbonation makes it feel thicker than it really is."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English Indian Pale Ale."
"Mouth is on the light side of medium, carb low, drinkability is high for a mediocre beverage and probably the strong suit."
"What a nice beer this is! Seriously, it is delicious, an excellent balance between the hops and malt, both kind of up and in your face, but neither dominating so much as to make it either sickly or like sucking lemons, there is a noticeably bitter aftertaste which I really enjoyed. A beautiful beer."
"This poured a very tall, thick and foamy head. There was also a lot of visible bubbles in the glass. Clear, vibrant light amber color. Slightly skunky on the nose, then aromas of citrus and some faint toasted malt. Tasted of caramel, toasted malt, subtle dry hops and a faint and unpleasant bit of soapyness that did not linger. A very easy drinking beer that had a smooth, somewhat light mouthfeel."
"D- Sweet, buttery, and forgettable. More bitter and rich than the ABV lead me to expect."
"Drinkability: I'd guess this one's probably not too high in abv. Easy to drink."
"Toasted malt dominates the aroma, and maybe the faintest hint of grassy hops. There was a hint of skunk when I cracked the cap, but I don't smell it in the glass. Light amber colored beer is still, and the short white head doesn't last very long. Malt dominated flavor is a mix of biscuit malt and caramel. Finishes quite bitter. Low carbonation and moderately full body make for an easy drinking beer. A flavorful malty beer, but the hops are no where to be seen :("
"OVERALL: A very good job here. A bold and bitter English IPA, showcasing the English version of this style well. If it wasn't for the sub-par looks, this one would have gotten a much better overall score. Very drinkable and enjoyable; one I'll have again."
"As for St. Peters IPA, I find it a very nice, mild IPA that really does showcase what we might have seen in the earlier days of the ""style", but I would love a larger sense of oak and a bit more aroma. It has such a bold flavor, that I would think that the aroma would have splintered my nose, but no such luck. I do love the beers flavor profiles as well as its mouthfeel. It has a nice resonance, and it provides a decent lace about the glass that I love to see with a beer. Price is a bit much for a pint, but such is the way of the world!"
"St Peter's IPA gives a hit to our friends in the New World how this style of beer appeared in the first place, to preserve it through harsh shipping envoirments. Hops make great presevatives and while it is not as hoppy as an IPA from Oregon it will please with its assertive profile."
"big off white creamy head, very hazy dark orange body. no real discernible nose, slight slight hops. taste is a decent bitterness, nothing exterme, but nothing really noticeable or impressive. slight malts and a straightforward mild bitterness. the feel is fine and as is the drinkability. perhaps it is a bit too thick and not carbonated enough for such a feel."
"A nice Pale Ale that is very easy to drink, skunkiness a little but still decent."
"I don't know exactly what they were trying to do here, but this 'mellow' IPA had a bland flatness to it. In the absense of that traditional hop/floral essence that I look for in the genre, I would have hoped for some redeming quality or some other flavorful malt--but none existed."
"A light amber, gold color with a nice creamy 1 1/2 finger head with a light carbonation and a strong presence in the lacing. The smell is of corn and malt acids. A bit grainy and pervasively thin. Almost punishingly so. Almost all carbonation sits at the head. This beer is crisp and clean, but the hop structure is (by American standards) remarkably weak, and by English standards, on the light end. The pungent hop oils are there, but the body is again too light to allow the malt structure to really grab and render flavors beyond the corn and grains that I taste. A bit calcic and the finish is kind of awkward. A bit more sweetness would really round this beer out better."
"Cheers!!!"
"NOTES: BBCSD-0907-PatM"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Thin and easy, the texture compliments the relative simplicity of the beer's overall presentation. It never gets above the most gentle prickle in the mouth. For an English IPA, it quenches and would be a solid choice with most foods."
"Overall -- I enjoyed this beer. Not an overpowering IPA by any sense of the imagination, but very interesting and enjoyable."
"D - Fairly drinkable and easy going. Could see myself drinking this as a session beer. There are better English IPAs out there, for example Worthington White Shield and Greene King IPA but this is still an decent beer in its own right."
"Drinkability> Sure. I'll have another."
"Mouthfeel is ok. Medium bodied."
"I have seen St. Peter's beers around for a while but have never taken the plunge. The bottle is a unique shape and it is not brown. I typically steer rather clear of clear or green bottled beer to avoid getting a skunky light struck beer. Every place that I have seen St. Peters, the display is usually rather dusty, not a good sign. But, since I have been meaning to try them for a long time now, I thought what the hell, get the IPA and see what its all about. I poured the beer into a St. Bernadus goblet (my favorite glass). There was little carbonation, low head, mild aroma, not much like an American IPA. It was dark in color, not a brown but maybe a copper-ish brown. It was smooth and had a nice mouthfeel to it. The hop character did not show up until the aftertaste at first. My fears that the green bottle and age had caused the beer to be skunky were well founded unfortunately. Even though this beer may have been past its prime, I still recommend it to everyone out there. Years ago, I had the Bert Grant's IPA in the bar ""The Cellar"" in Mesa, Arizona. I was big into hops at the time and would try anything that I thought would have an overpowering hop character. The Grant's IPA was mellow and really mild. The representative from Grant's that was present said that their IPA was from the original recipes used for the British IPAs. I did not believe him and found the beer rather boring. This beer is more hopped than Grants, maybe this is what they were shooting for. Anybody that is making a study of IPAs (specifically British IPAs) needs to check this beer out. I'd try it again if I could get it on draught or knew that the bottle was relatively new."
"A fairly clear orange/chestnut color with a decent big bubbled off-white head and good lacing clumped throughout. The aroma is pretty pungent with honey and an odd mozzarella cheese, even some pepperoni! I mean it's odd but I can't really say I don't like it, just not too sure. Very edible but it's freaking me out. I have let this one sit unrefrigerated for nearly a year, so maybe that's a good thing? Well, the flavor somewhat follows suit. I now can identify some hops, again sort of an odd, but kind of an herbal thing I would say. There's a bit of soapiness but not too much. Malt and caramel blend in a mild sweetness behind the herbal glow. The body is midland and pleasant and depending on how you find the taste, it's drinkable, but generally a bit too odd to encourage any sessioning. Probably not the best one in their line. I probably won't revisit it but you might want to venture a try if you are an IPA guru. It may grow on you."
"Taste is also quite adjuncty, with a sweet, chemical flavour on the front. Dirty bitterness at the back, tastes kind of like drinking regurgitated bleach. Adjuncty sweet but with a funky, dirty hop flavour predominant. Mouthfeel is reasonably good though, certainly appropriate, quite full and smooth. But this is just overpowered by hops, which are not complex or pleasant enough, just a high acidity."
"I'm afraid it's just a little too similar to every other English Ale. While there's things to like about the generic English Ale, this is unfortunately not much more than the generic example. Drinkable enough, but not anything other than a solid and predictable English hopped ale."
"Overall, decent beer and a good representation of this style, but not impressed. it lacks flavor."
"D - Not really a bad beer, just sort of lacks the hoppiness of a lot of IPAs, even other English IPAs I've tried. I had trouble getting beyond the slight ""Heineken-like"" funkiness and there was a bit too much yeast for my liking as well."
"Nice beer. Got this bottle at Sam's in Chicago couple weeks ago. Upon opening immediately smelled skunk. That quickly faded. Poured with a nice frothy light tan head and good lace. After skunk faded picked up good fresh hop. Color is a clear coppery amber. Flavor is like aroma with more emphasis on malt and hop; nice bittersweet. Easy drinking. Good finish. Session beer."
"Good brew; glad I tried it. High drinkability makes this an easy session beer, if you can afford a bunch of them!"
"D: pretty good, not something i'd get on a regular basis, but not a bad drink"
"mouthfeel is pretty smooth and creamy. maybe a session brew."
"Goes especially well with fusilli in fresh pesto and tempeh."
"Not a bad brew: balanced, flavorful, and enjoyable."
"Not bad, but far from a world eding IPA like I was expecting."
"The taste is jam, especially orange marmalade, fruit, citrus (lemon and orange), yeastiness, sweetness with a bitterness that grows towards the finish, which is dryish, lightly bitter, with citrus, fruit, and toast."
"Not the halfhearted watery nonsense which sometimes passes for an English IPA but a little too yeasty for me to really enjoy."
"Pours a redish orange with a huge frothy two finger tan head that sticks around for a long time before leaving a nice jagged lacing behind. A waft of skunk is the first thing I notice, then some malts and grain maybe. Why the heck do breweries insist on putting beers in green bottles? Skunk is so easily avoided, and there's no excuse. Anyway, I expected this to definitely be different than what I'm used to in the IPA department, but there's really not much going on here except a slight bit of citrus and some bitterness, which is not at all pleasing. Has a hoppy floavor but it just seems to be missing a lot."
"Nothing wrong with it, just not as exciting as I'd hoped for. I prefered the old bottle style too."
"Drinkability? An easy drinking brew and tasty enough to my liking. And..head retention and lacing are very good. I'm glad I revisited this IPA after many a year. Like many breweries I've tried, it has a ""family"" flavour, or what ever you call it, that sticks out so that you almost know what to expect and can easily identify the brewery. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. With St Peter's, it works for me."
"Cool looking stubby, slightly green bottle that holds just over a pint. Pours mostly transparent copper gold with a foamy snow white head that subsides somewhat quickly. Smells of roasted malts with a caramel sweetness and spicy hops in the background. The taste is smooth and spicy followed by a moderate sweetness balanced with a strong bitterness from the hops. Well balanced and tasty. Pretty low carbonation and low alcohol would make this a good session beer."
"Drinkability: Politely excusing the touch of skunk in the nose, it's a decent English-born brew; simple and pleasant."
"Pours a pale yellow colored body with a creamy white head, diminishing. Has a somewhat skunky English hoppiness in the aroma. A lot of maltiness. Watery taste, malty. Not much flavor. Somewhat dusty. Not much flavor, weak."
"drinkability is ok. not all that exciting, and the taste/aroma don't seem all that befitting the style, but it was decent enough. i seem to have a love/hate relationship with this brewery..."
"This was one of the two St.Peter's Ale's i tried last night. Anyway, this IPA pours out a nice orangrey, color, not dark, but light, with little to no head, and no lacing, but vigorous carbonation. The smell of this beer was just amazing, smelled of fresh fruits, kind of spicy and hoppy. Smelled very fresh, was fantastic. The taste was great too, im new to IPA's so i found this one a hop blast from usual czech pils. Goes down smooth, then finishes with a spicy and fruity, grapefruity taste, then a lingering hop bitterness, and then it just finishes after all of that bone dry. Mouthfeel was full and carbonated, no complaints. Drinkability, i deducted .5 from it, because honestly after one of these I didnt want another, not that it tasted bad, i just didn't feel like another pint...and thats rare. I enjoyed this, but i still need to get used to the blast of fruity citrusy hops, definatly hoppier than a pils, overall i enjoyed it."
"Taste is sweet and full of malt. The bready and light husky taste combines really well with the English hoppiness. This is just an amazing beer, with everything British in it. The malt is fitting the hops so well and I can't wrap my head around this beer being only 5,5%. It tastes so much stronger and has so much taste. OK, mouthfeel is just a little sweet, but this adds to the maltiness. Great UK beer!"
"Really good atmosphere, good flavor and feel. Hops not as sharp as many IPA's, which probably improves drinkability a bit, especially for those that may not be IPA fans. Good quaff."
" A very good choice for drinking multiples of. Very easy going down, and not very heavy at all at any point."
"d) Lovely drink, interesting notes, and easy to drink several."
"Consumed: 12/26/08"
"D - Taste kinda old. I wouldn't be drinking it hard if I had options."
"Won't drink again because there are so many better beers out there, but glad I tried this English IPA."
"English style IPA isn't anything I'm spoiled with so this was interesting, but I think the English IPA brewers have to work harder to keep up with the American IPA's."
"(rated Dec 25, 2007)"
"Poured a medium amber color with an averaged sized off white head. Aromas of grassiness - straw, toasted caramel, and a little bready. Tastes of caramel, toffee, and some citrus. There was just something about the tastes and the way the interacted that just kinda of put me off on this one."
"very cool old-styl bottle. A mild English IPA. Orange pour with sediment and an average white head. Musty aroma with some flowers and grass. Watery taste of hops, earth, and light pine. Wanted so much more. Just another ""organic"" beer gone awry."
"500 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 5.5%. Amber to brown colour, moderate white head. Moderate aroma of toffee and hops. The flavour is distinctly hoppy from start to finish, with a substantial bitterness. Also some notes of toffee. Very bitter and sharp aftertaste. A solid British IPA this one."
"Bottle: Poured a light amber color ale with an average foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of floral hops with some dry caramel malt. Taste is also a mix between some dry floral English hops and some light dry caramel malt. Average body with some good carbonation. English hops are dominant though not as extreme as an US style IPA."
"Pours yellow, slightly hopped aroma. Good effort at an IPA here but more matly than I'd expect and not nearly as hopped. There's a strong early spring beer influence in here, moreso than IPA influence. Enjoyable, but relatively bland, nothing too special here to be honest with you."
"D: A decent british ipa, light in body and hopping warranting a decent session ipa."
"It pours a nice amber color with a two finger head that sticks around. Has a nice hop aroma and flavor. Taste is pretty simple, but satisfying. It drinks very easy and does not have a bitter finish. One of my first IPA that I've tried. So far so good."
"Perfect IPA for the Australian climate actually. Not overly powerfully hoppy like the American counterparts, but some very good fruity flavours and aroma."
"Pours a ligght, hazy golden-orange color with a very thin head that quickly dissapears with no lacing. Earthy aroma of hops and soil. Very malty tasting with an earthy flavor that is not to bitter. Dry hoppy aftertaste. Kind of bland like most British IPAs that arent' cask-conditioned."
"The taste is dominated all the way through with very bitter hops. The bitterness isn't pleasant in a citrus or fruity way but astringent and biting. For a proper kind of hop profile I think there needs to be some kind of malt there to balance out the sour bitterness and that usually means an increased ABV, which this doesnt have. Really unbalanced. The mouthfeel is medium and somewhat creamy. The carbonation is light to medium."
"Very enjoyable foe a pint or two but would not be a readily drunk session beer"
"do a bad pint but not the best from this brewer's lineup"
"Very strange take on an EIPA. Balance makes the English IPA one of my fave styles but this is out of wack, very difficult to nail down the malt."
"A normal yellow body with a foaming, disapearing white head. Smells like cheese, uh oh but could still be a decent bitterness. And it is. Medium mouthfeel.Understated carbonation.A little sugary sweetness. Drinkable English IPA, but nothing exceptional."
"There are better tasting and balanced intense IPAs around for my dollar."
"This beer is an homage to English hops. Its not a hop bomb, much more subtle, but pretty bold nonetheless by English standards."
"Pours a hazy light golden orange, amber highlights, decently thick white head forms, drops down to a thin layer, some nice lacing on the glass, good retention. Smell is weird, a bit skunky, caramel, grains, dough, some apricot and light fruitiness, herbal hops, light bit of sourness, not so great. Taste isn't much better, same caramel and grain malt profile, minerals, light fruit, sour and medicinal finish, lots of herbal bitterness, but not much else to balance, almost a grapefruity character, but definitely not pleasant. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low carbonation, almost a minerally/salty feel to it which makes it a bit hard to drink. Not a fan of this one."
"Overall, I think this is a very well put together English IPA - and that is the important distinction: it is not an American IPA. Smooth, faintly carbonated with a rich hop character layered on top of a fine pale ale. Easily drinkable but fairly complex at the same time; something that can be had in a session or a quiet reflection. Serve warm for it's true character to shine. This is definitely something to check out, but don't go in expecting your standard American IPA."
"Taste is subdued - the hops are there but not abundant. There's an herbal/medicinal quality to the ale that is difficult to place. Mouthfeel is light and carbonated. A mediocre ale through and through. I won't get this one again."
"Basically: A good example of how not to make an IPA."
"D: Poured this one out, I will be having and reviewing again as I'm pretty certain I got a bad bottle."
"D: Drinks alright, but is not as refreshing as some other IPAs. It's really sugary. I may buy again, but I would opt for quite a few others before doing so."
"D - Very high, I'm a big fan of this brew and St. Peter's in general."
"D - One of the most unusual IPAs that I've ever had, even for an English one. Not a beer I'll regulerly stock, but I might try another because it was so different."
"The hard bitterness in the beginning and the end is not at all appealing. On the bright side, as one continues to drink, the malt flavor becomes a little more apparent and brings some balance to the flavor. However, the aftertaste is a real bummer. Hate to say it, but I couldn't bring myself to finish the entire pint."
"taste is grainy up front, malt, roasted nuts, some caramel, becomes more bitter as you drink, a slight dry finish."
"Pours redish orange with a huge frothy two finger tan head that sticks around for a long time before leaving a nice jagged lacing behind. A waft of skunk is the first thing I notice, then some malts and grain maybe. Why the heck do breweries insist on putting beers in green bottles? Skunk is so easily avoided, and there's no excuse. Anyway, I expected this to definitely be different than what I'm used to in the IPA department, but there's really not much going on here except a slight bit of citrus and some bitterness, which is not at all pleasing. With all the good IPA's around these days, there is absolutely no reason to try this one. I'll stop there, because if I said anything else it might get ugly."
"First impression: what the hell went wrong ... pours a clooody haze dirty brown... smells of dirty water, soggy used hops, and dusty old bones fill of green dust ... low medium..lacing is actually very good ... a kind of dirty ugly beer ... has this strange bitterness.. to queer for me.."
"Pours slightly cloudy, light gold with foamy white head that dies down rather quickly. Aroma of toasted grain. Flavor is medium-full with bitter hops and yeasty maltiness supporting notes of flint and copper. Sour hops taste much like a Heineken. Overall, an interesting brew. Not what I expected in an IPA, certainly different than an American IPA...no fruity, citrusy hops here. Goes down easy enough."
"Forget everything you know about american IPA's. This is a damn tasty beer."
"Pours a medium amber brown with a medium tan head. Smells of sour beer, really skunky, not good at all. Taste is much better. Tastes of earthy hops, a nice malt flavor with just a touch of sourness. The hops leave a nice bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation levels are medium as well. Drinkability is pretty good, this is a decent English Ale, I suspect if I had it on cask, fresh, I would like it MUCH more. I think the green bottle combined with the long trip may have degraded the quality a bit, but even so, its still worth a try."
"I think this beer suffered a bit on the journey over. It seems to be quite musty in all phases. It pours a copper amber with a nice frothy and soapy head, good lacing, decent carbonation. The smell at first was very skunky, although it mellowed a bit and more biscuity grains came through. There are some hop aromas as well, but this isn't endearing me to the beer. The taste has a back bone of some nice biscuity and bready malts, but it is overshadowed by very acerbic, tea like hop bitterness, that just seems like its been sitting around too long. The biscuity flavors give me a hint of what this beer would be like if it were fresh. The hops are pronounced, not oily or estery, but more the traditional English Fuggles type. The beer is just a bit too musty for my tastes. The mouthfeel and consistency is a bit thin. The aftertaste is cloying hop that hangs on just too long."
"An good English IPA with generous amounts of hops."
"Drinkable, but not recommended."
"Good, almost translucent rusty colred amber. Very few and sluggish bubbling. Only a ring of foam and some slight foamy film forms in the shape of small islands. Very sparse lacing after each sip. The aroma is medium citrus hops with some faint biscuits. The taste starts with light orange jam on a hard English biscuit. The hops come out halfway through the taste in agreat mildness. that gently blend with bready malts in the finish. Great blendig of English malt and hops. The great first IPA to baby step new craft beer fans. Very easy to drink."
"I wonder what this would be fresh. However, in the US, this bottle was a clear miss."
"All in all, an odd beast. Very tame and totally offset from my expectations for an IPA, but good nonetheless. Very true to the brewery's style, from what I can tell. Worth a try."
"Exceptional drinkability but I really can't say that this is an IPA. Good pale ale though."
"Overall, Drinkable, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Drinkability: Another Euro brewer that refuses to learn its lesson about green bottles - drain pour"
"Good brew, not great, good session beer."
"D = I liked this beers appearance, smell and mouthfeel but the taste could not be overcome. Only average drinkability for me."
"Pours a nice orangish amber. Nice sticky white head, leaves some nice lacing around the glass, great retention. Aroma is slightly skunky, a bit of toasted malt, apple, and maybe a touch of citrus. Not much hops here, not what you would hope for from an IPA. Taste isnt much better than the aroma. A little fruit with a lingering, somewhat unpleasant bitterness. Not a good IPA."
"I don't know if this was a bad bottle or what... but it really wasn't very enjoyable. I have -never- had a skunked pilsner-type flavor in an IPA before, though, so this has me a bit worried."
"D - I think that this is a good example of an English IPA good taste with a malt start and finishes bitter this one is worth trying sometime"
"A golden yellow beer with a slight haze. Has a foamy off white head and some nice sticky lace. The aroma starts with a light sweet malt note and quickly gives way to a nice hoppy profile, with tea like and piney characters. The taste starts with the piney hops running all over your tongue. Followed by a light caramel malt character and a finish of the tea like hops and piney hops coating the back of your throat. An English style IPA all the way."
"500mL bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a nice cloudy dark gold. It has a light English hop aroma along with some maltiness. The flavour has decent bitterness and well-balanced maltiness. Nice aftertaste. A typical, good English bitter. Not so much different than St. Peter's Best Bitter though."
"O - Good for a few..."
"D - I would definitely recommend this. Very drinkable and besides, the bottle is way cool."
"Notes: This one tasted very fresh and that made all the difference. The first one I tried tasted dumbed down. This version was hoppy and alive."
"Drinks very easy, not the best put together EIPA there is, but pretty damn good. A little more malt presence finesse with the hopping is what the doctor ordered. If this were an AIPA, I'd knock those down a few .5s to 1 points, people need to drink some EIPAs at the source to understand the English don't usually subscribe to the more is better philosophy, think restraint & finesse"
"D - A fairly good beer overall. Would be very easy to drink several."
"Bought in Wisonville ,OR. pint and a bit bottle Slightly hazy orangy/amber colored ale with a very nice rocky/frothy off white head. Typical English malt aromas, very pleasant,sweet with a good sniff of grassy hop in the back. Semi-sweet malts dominate, almost honeylike in some areas, but there is very nice mellow hoppy bitterness throughout and eventually takes over on the back of the mouthful. Nice on the palate, Very drinkable example"
"The appearance is a clear golden amber with thick lacing and head retention. It's smells of sweet, creamy English yeast character. The malt is a very subtle caramel and then grassy and herbal hops kick with with a touch of citrus and then the candy-like yeast flavors. Very smooth drinking and a fine session beer. My only knocks are that there's no hops in the aroma and that the flavor is a little mild."
"Drinkability - 4.9% seems a little weak with the alcohol for an IPA, but all the better for session drinking. I like it. It isn't Meantime's IPA, but still a good easy-drinking beer I'd session any day of the week."
"Drinkability: Not the hoppiest IPA out there, but it did make for a somewhat refreshing lighly hopped IPA. One bottle is good enogh for me."
"St. Peter's India Pale Ale pours an golden color, body with a nice creamy head of medium thickness which turns lacy after a few minutes. A faint scent of citrus is detected in the nose and the hops is well...missing. Honestly, it tasted more like a malt liquor than an IPA. Terribly disasatisfied in this beer."
"Regardless, the bitterness is nice but the rest of the beer feels unbalanced."
"This is a very sessionable IPA and a good example of the English style."
"although quite hoppy as well, the flavor tips the balance back towards the malts. dry and biscuity. bready. it must be said, however, that is is a hop-focused brew. the hops used are something i am used to smelling/tasting in a tripel, as well, so i am assuming they are a continental variety like tettnang or hallertau. there seems to be a suggestions of spice as well, most likely coming from the hop"
"I could see how some might like this IPA, but it's not the hops choice I care for."
"Drinkability- Actually was a bit refreshing on this 1st week of football. Crisp and clean, but also very Bud like. Lawnmower acceptable."
"Yellow with (I'm pretty sure here, and it's not the olive colored bottle giving this effect) green hue. No lacing, aroma, or head. Hazy like an IPA. Ok, so I'm an American; I'm used to big hop flavor so this was like an IPA LITE for me. Slick palate, slight diacetyl undertone. Ladies and geltlemen, I present to you the Budweiser of IPA's!"
"mouthfeel was smooth with medium/low carbonation and a medium body. Enjoyable overall."
"M&D: the texture is softly fizzy and not harsh, while the body is at most medium for a 5.5%abv. pale ale, which helps take off the weight a bit. Overall, this is an extremely easy-drinking, delicious, and more-ish type of EIPA, but not as complex as one might expect from this renowned micro-brewery. I hope to taste it on cask, if it's ever available!"
"Poured into my Samuel Adams Glass. Amber color with a white head. Pour gives a flash of the hoppiness to come. Very drinkable, very East English toned down IPA. Antithetical to a Burton or an American IPA. Chunky lacing on the way down the glass. A definite re-buy. BTW this is one of the 'new' St. Peter's bottles which are round rather than their iconic oval bottles."
"D: This beer is pretty drinkable. Smooth, nice malts, and slightly hop bitterness. No high IBU content to ward off the drinker. Despite being an unorthodox IPA, I still think it is a good brew."
"IMHO, an IPA (or any hoppy beer) should never go into a green bottle, but I managed to grab this bottle fresh before it even hit the shelves which, I feel, made for a more enjoyable experience."
"I wouldn't pick this beer as the representative for all IPAs but its not bad. The extra malt differs this brew from others of its ilk. I like malt so that's good for me, but I bet a lot of IPA aficionados would not care for it so much."
"for an IPA, this brew is well crafted. the hops are strong, but do not overpower the subtle sweetness that gives it balance. a good example of a good IPA."
"Gets better as we go...but I'll never forget how unpromising the aroma was when I first cracked it. Drinks down nice and mild, lightly hoppy, not bad overall, but nothing I'd recommend."
"Notes: A decent IPA, but at $4 a bottle this is nothing I'd care to revisit."
"Drinkability of this beer is pretty good, could be a good session beer with fresher samples."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Pours a nice golden with a big rocky head. Aroma is overpowering skunk with some hops in there somewhere. Taste is skunk with some mild floral hops. This beer comes in a really cool bottle. The bottle is the best thing it has going for it. Unfortunately, they need to change the color of the bottle. Painful drinking."
"Brew poured to a golden color with a very good sized off white head that has excellent retention and left a great amount of lacing. The aroma has issues, this is where the wheels start to fall off in my book. Very strong skunk scent, guess that is what you get for a bottle that is more or less clear. I am able to pick up some malt scents as well but it is difficult through the skunky smell. With this being a English IPA I was expecting to pick up some hops but I cant. It has a good bitterness taste to it what is welcome, but to be called an IPA seems to be a stretch to me. Some malt flavor comes out to play which seem to be more on the toasted side. Overall this brew is not too bad of a tasting brew, just does not seem to fit the style and I still have a hard time getting over the scent. Not worth the 3.99 I spent on it."
"Why oh why would you go through crafting a beer and putting up with all the red tape of shipping it overseas only to ruin it by putting it into a crappy bottle? Avoid, unless you find it on tap or in a can."
"D: Somewhat drinkable in its composition, with just enough bite to keep you coming back, and just enough of a crisp and thin flavor to preserve your palate."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but not very IPA-ish. Poured a caramel with moderate head. Malty with toffee overtones and not nearly enough hops to qualify as an IPA - would struggle to fit into a pale ale category, and might rank as an ESB. Overall quite mild and understated, without much depth of flavor. Still one of the coolest bottles on the market, though."
"It does have a decent body (though not much more than that, IMO), and has something of a drinkability to it. The aroma leaves something to be desired. Overall, it's a rather average-ish English PA...(IPA?)"
"Poured out a murky orange brown with little to no head. The nose is orange and piney, with some malt and yeast playing backup. The taste is harsh, scuzzy with piney hoppyness. This has a slightly slick mouthfeel. I would not call this a particularly drinkable beer."
"Medium bodied mouthfeel, overly sweet for an IPA. Medicinally hoppy with flavors of metal and lawn clippings. Not bad, just not for me."
"Nice and balanced flavor, very english in nature with medium-low carbonation, lightly toasty malt, and a mild leafy hop presence that only turns slightly bitter in the very finish. Fairly mild ABV makes for nice drinkability as well -- nice example of the style."
"Wow. This was an impressive IPA. It's not a hop bomb like some of the better American IPAs, but this seems to be a pub IPA, and if I was across the water, this would be a good pint to drink for the night."
"This finishes a little warm and is quite clean."
"I love the unique St Peters bottles; I feel like Im medicating myself. Anyway, this poured a nicely active bright orange brew with just a thin veil of white bubbles. The lightly hoppy aroma is nice ... summer-time flowers. The first swallow is sharply bitter, much starker than an American IPA. This is woody and tangy more than the citric fruitiness we Yanks have come to expect from a beer labeled IPA, unfairly. With a solid malt undertow and a nicely balanced bitterness, I feel this is a very under-rated offering. Quite good in my book. (#2688, 2/6/2007)"
"The St. Peter' IPA pours a nice golden orange color into a .5 liter glass mug. A casual, whispy head bubbles up top and thins out rather quickly. The aroma is light and hoppy, but not as citrusy or as floral as a lot of the American counterparts are doing these days. But a nice, mild hoppy aroma nonetheless. Very pleasant. The taste here is delicious. A smooth hoppy brew with a nice malt balance. Nothing too fancy here, just a solid example of how the Brits do a good IPA. I lived in England for 6 months back in college, and it was this kind of beer that really turned me on to hops. A proper classic IPA here. Very nice. Sturdy mouthfeel, though a bit thinner than I would have thought. Overall, I think this is a fine beer. Like the other St. Peter's that I've had, this one is an extremely well-crafted beer."
"Possibly a little more balance would've helped me enjoy the actual taste and smell of this one, otherwise, I thought this was a pretty solid English IPA. Definately has the piney hops to it. The cardboard notes were also a bit unnerving."
"St. Peter's India Pale Ale pours a light copper color with a thin white head from a green 500 ml bottle. Lightly hoppy aroma that doesn't do much to excite. There is a nice hop bite, but this is not an American IPA by any means. This is a more subtle beer than the American versions and I find it's nicely balanced. Enjoyable, but don't expect a hop bomb."
"Fairly typical of many English Pale Ales. Standard fruity malts (peached and pears). These are pronounced in the aromas as well as flavors. Aromas quickly turn to grassy, pine-ey. Flavors do the same, but fade further into a sharp metalic hop flavor that is not prefered. The beer holds together nicely, lending a firm malt presence and hop balance. Finishes with a lingering metalic bite. Otherwise a nice brew."
"I wanted to like St. Peter's IPA, I really did. If the brewers had no intention of creating a true, honest to God and Queen English IPA, then why did they put India Pale Ale right there on the label? As far as I'm concerned, Cream Stout is still the cream of the St. Peter's crop."
"Pours faintly cloudy pale copper. Thin wisps of foam quickly devolve into a white film and scattered thin lace. Aroma is composed of light-toasted biscuit malts and moderately strong leafy hops on metallic water. Flavor is rather poor. Sparse malt is rapidly overtaken by metallic hard water and completely unbalanced by sour leafy hops. Also full of bitter dirty copper notes. Average body is lightly carbonated and tends towards creaminess. Not very good. Expected better from other St. Peter's brews."
"A clean crisp hops taste, easy to drink and enjoy. Nothing wrong with this brew, although it seems more like a pale ale or ESB than an IPA though."
"I raise this pint glass to Glenn ""BO"" Schembechler,this poured a dull light light golden with a thin wispy head seems to be very lightly carbonated.""Full bodied and generously hopped pale ale"" per label,hmm wrong on both counts in my mind thin almost watery mouthfeel not much carbonation to give it any life the hop profile is light and more herbal than anything,a decent toasted malt base is there with a touch of sweetness.Eh pretty boring and not enjoyable,I expected more from a pretty good English brewer."
