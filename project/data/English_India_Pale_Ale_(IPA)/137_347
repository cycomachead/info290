4,18.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured on-tap at the Sea Dog in South Portland. The beer was served in a pint glass, and it presents a caramel brown color that is crisp and vibrant. No head on this beer. The aromas are a blend of coffee, nut, and caramel, overall rich and sweet. The flavors are rich, sweet caramel malt with a strong, deep hop presence in the foundation. Very smooth and round. The aftertaste is rich and sweet, with a heavier hop presence, both moist green and slightly spiced. The beer has a dry, clean finish. Not too shabby.","GarthDanielson","Sep 02, 2011"

2.9,-14.2,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,2," The taste is mildly hoppy no big deal, it has some hops up front with a slight caramel-like flavor which starts to take over with a slight cloying effect which makes it pretty average as far as flavor, almost as if the yeast gave up 3/4 of the way and left the residual sugar there and this doesn't bother that much because it tastes ok, but it does distract from the hops that are apparently there, just muted by the malt. Overall bottom line is this is a pretty poor IPA English or otherwise, it just lacks an assertive hop flavor and the bitterness it does have is negated by the overtly sweet malt finish, caramel is too high. I recommend trying anything else but this if you are looking for a decent IPA, the hops take a backseat which is dissapointing.","Slatetank","Jul 25, 2011"
3.67,8.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Copper colored brew, largely clear but with a bit of haze. Small white head proves fleeting. Scent has a lot of caramel malts and some nice bitter hop. Nice caramel maltiness, a fair amount of bitter hop, kinda has a unique taste to the water too. Not to say that its watery, just that its a individually noticed ingredient for some reason. Mouth is pretty full and smooth. Kind of a unique brew in its own regard, not too bad.","Tballz420","May 24, 2011"
3.65,8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O= great nose but just not quite balanced in the drinking. Grassy belches.

3.32,-1.8,3,3.5,3.5,3,3,"12oz bottle of ""Kennebunkport IPA"" from Traders Joe. Pours copper with a short lived white head, lots of carbonation. Aroma is perfume hops and biscuit malt. Medium, oily body. Not very sharp. Flavor of biscuit and caramel malt with a medium, lightly hoppy dry finish.

It does have elements of a British style IPA, such as the more muted hop flavors. Pleasant but not special.","smcolw","Sep 05, 2009"
3.03,-10.4,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Drinkability: This is a very average IPA that almost drinks more like a regular pale ale. I do not get the hoppy bite that I am accustomed to with this style. It is not overly distinguishable. One is enough.","tigg924","Sep 04, 2009"
4,18.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Sampled at a beer tasting at Barb's Beer Emporium on July 2, 2009. The pour is amber with a beige, foamy head. The aroma has a sugary sweetness about it, whcih makes sense since Sea Dog specializes in fruity beers. But this one was not fruity. The taste was more sugary sweet than hoppy like most IPA's. I could drink this one because the hop bitterness is more subtle.","puboflyons","Jul 05, 2009"
3.38,0,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Poured with a small, off-white head, and a light amber colored body. Good carbonation, slightly hazy. Good hops smell, maybe a bit malty as well. Pretty good hoppy taste... not the hoppiest IPA I've ever had, by any means, but not too bad either. Again, there's notes of malt in there as well. Slight lacing left on the glass. Overall, not the worst IPA I've ever had... it has potential, but there isn't a whole lot to set it apart from other IPAs. Reliable, but slightly boring.","berley31","Jun 22, 2009"
3.76,11.2,4,3,4,4,4,"Ran into this on cask at the new Sea Dog Brew Pub in South Portland. A slightly hazed copper-amber color with a good off-white head and modest lace. The aroma is very faint and hard to pin down, just a vague wheat grass malt at best. The flavor is a very mellow blend of cotton candy malt and floral/herbal hop bitterness. It's very smooth with just a slight hint of carbonation. It's quite drinkable, somewhat like an English bitter. The bitterness doesn't hit hard but it prevails tastefully. The sweetness suggests orange and pear syrup. A decent cask offering.","Durge","May 28, 2009"
3.83,13.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours a deep clear amber, with a 1 finger off white head. Head receded very quickly, not much lacing to speak of. Nose is of citrusy hops and faint malt. Taste is very bold, but not brash citrus hops, that are well balanced against some pale malts. It's not a typical IPA - and may border more on an APA but it is a very drinkable beer. Definitely one that you can sit with for a session.","Jayli","May 25, 2009"
3.53,4.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark orange amber with a fizzy,light tan head that leaves a little sticky lace on the glass. Smells fruity and buttery with some imported smelling hops. Tastes fairly bitter up front with caramel malt, citrus and sweet fruitiness leading to a crisp and somewhat buttery finish. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Pretty average EIPA.","biggred1","Apr 16, 2009"
3.53,4.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Off the tap this beer was a true amber color with a khaki-colored, two-finger head. The retention was good especially as a clingy collar that left good lacing in 'torn curtains'. The aroma was dry and piney with some herbal elements as well. The flavors were similar, piney and resin-like hops (Simcoe?) with some woody elements. The malt backbone was not quite big enough to stand up to the hops and it thus lacked balance. Distinctly bitter without sweetness. The mouthfeel was good, the carbonation fine and the acidity high.","thekevlarkid","Jan 21, 2009"
3.2,-5.3,3,3,3.5,3,3,"12 oz from Trader Joe's. Pours light amber with a short off-white head. Floral, citrus aroma of hops and some strawberries with caramel. Light mouthfeel.

Not syrupy, but something like caramel or butterscotch seemed to permeate, and there was a dry finish that reminded me of coffee/roasted malt.

Not so; it's how the hops interact with myriad ingredients and flavors, combined with a felicitous texture for the palate, that make an excellent IPA to me. This isn't bad, to be clear.

Caramelly segue to a toasted, herbal bitterness. Maybe some mint in there too. Not bad, but I'm not wild about the Twizzlers taste. Light bodied, with a bubbly feel. Wouldn't mind if it were creamier. Not bad for the price (at Trader Joe's), but certainly not a go-to IPA (English). I'll stick with the Dragonmead Crown Jewels for now.","alexgash","Feb 20, 2007"
3.63,7.4,3.5,3,3.5,4,4.5,"Poured from the 'fridge into a Libby pint. A brilliant, hazey copper in color. A medium-firm pour produces a rocky, pale tan head of medium to lengthy duration and a moderate degree of lacing. Nose is acidic, yeasty, and brimming with a slew of American hop varietals - Cascades and Chinook? Seems a bit brassy/brashy, not quite as laid back as the style tends to be. Caramel malt on the nose seems a bit confounded. Malt and yeast cover the tongue on first sip, followed by a pungent yeast characteristic and fairly assertive bitterness. Seems creamy.Second sip brings out a bit more: notable malt and yeast interplay, bittering hops become brighter and less restrained, some aromatics developing. Dry, biscuity malt lingers along with the hop bitterness. Definitely creamy, coating the mouth and palate. Medium bodied. Alcohol isn't too pervasive, but it is there, creeping up slowly. Citrus notes from the hops are minimal, and seem offset by the yeast (Ringwood, either ya love it or hate it), but the malt really shines here, with a fruity, juicy character and mild notes of strawberry, grape skin, and green apple. The smallest traces of diacetyl do not detract, but seem to be more a functional component of the brew. Drinks a bit bigger than it is (to its credit) and definitely tastes better on the warm side. It's also more of a sipper than a guzzler, and I can appreciate that as 6.2% can occasionally make for a tough session. Best-by date of 7/07. Although I know that the British IPA style doesn't exactly float American boats, it's still nice to see an established Maine craft brewer return to Minnesota.

Flavor is just a little watery, though not as much as it is in some Sea Dog offerings. Probably the best Sea Dog beer I've had thus far. Most interesting, flavorful one to be sure.

The beer arrived a dirty brown color with little head and a hoppy aroma with just a touch of sweetness.

Hops, sour malts, spice, citrus and herbs all had their moments in this brew. Bitter aftertaste was not overly powerful. Mouthfeel was ok, could've benefited from better carbonation though.

Caramel and fruits hit you first in the flavor before the balancing but a bit weak hops come through with a nice bitter taste. There are also notes of spice as well.

3.58,5.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a clear copper with a small but persistent head that leaves a fair amount of lace. Aroma is a mixture of toasted malt and some spicy herbal hoppiness. Flavor begins slightly sweet, with caramel and citric notes, then has some balancing herbal bitterness. Flavor isn't very complex, and could use a but more hops to be considered a really good IPA. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy... almost like drinking a cask-conditioned ale. All in all, not a bad beer, espcially considering that it cost $4.99 for a sixer at Trader Joe's.","zerk","May 18, 2004"
3.6,6.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This beer poured with a nice big fluffy head with big fluffy bubbles which only lasted a short time. It was a clear copper color with a gentle hop aroma which seemed more floral than fruity. There was not any lace to speak of. It had a medium body to it. The taste was a pleasant floral hoppiness, but not ultra present. There were some malty undertones, which actually became more prevalent as the beer warmed up. The malty undertones left a nutty aftertaste, also particularly as it warmed up. This is not the most striking example of an IPA, however, it was still very drinkable.","gueuzegeek","Mar 19, 2004"

3.68,8.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12oz. bottle: There is a nice, clear copper color to this one. It has a bit of a head. The aroma has some citrus and malt to it, but is a tad light. The taste is medium-bodied, with a bit of bitterness. Could be a bit more hoppy. I also think it is more of an ESB. A good drinker, nonetheless.","Boto","Jan 12, 2004"

2.5,-26,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Average. Not horrible, and certainely not great. Pour was a slightly cloudy copper color, with a clean aroma. I thought the taste was rather fruity: seemed like 1/2 grapefruit, 1/2 beer taste...almost like the taste came from juice and not hops, very strange. Interesting floaties in the beer at the end as well, I hope it was yeast. pat","PatandDavid","Dec 02, 2003"
3.3,-2.4,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Clear classic copper color. Little head, disappeared quickly. Carmel light fruit peach/apricot & orange. Toasted malt with sweet(cascade?) hop taste. Taste disappeared quick though. Lite creaminess & kinda syrupy. Watery to some extent, Surprised by the ABV. Not ruhing out for another one , but not on my do not bother list.","oldgrowth","Sep 28, 2003"
3.63,7.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"It has a little fruity smell of oranges and apricots. You can also smell the alcohol. The taste is bitter with alot of hops and alcohol with a hint of oranges and apricots. Not a bad beer, it has a good bitter taste but the alcohol taste is a little to intense for me.","anders36","Sep 09, 2003"
3.92,16,5,3,4.5,4,3.5,"From a 12oz. bottle, best by Feb 2004. Pours a sparkly, light amber with a half inch of head. Nursed this one for about an hour and the a nice head remained, some lace but quickly dissipates. Smells of hops, pepper and cinnamon. Taste is sweet and malty but quickly gives you a strong bit of hops. I found it extremely hoppy but that may just be because heavily hopped brews are difficult to come by in Maine. A medium body with legs, aftertaste lingers on the palette for several minutes. Certainly drinkable but a bit too hoppy to be truly smooth. A very good product from an underappreciated brewer (at least within Maine.)","ViveLaChouffe","Aug 31, 2003"
2.97,-12.1,2.5,3,3,3,3,"Served on draught at the Clarke Cook House in Newport RI. A clear deep gold in color with a thin white head. Faint hop aroma and a bit of citrus with malt in the background. Light bodied and effervescent. Flavors not really big but a well balanced IPA. Are cascade hops the only available hops up here?","BierReise","Aug 03, 2003"

3.92,16,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Limpid deep amber to burnished copper color on the pour with a planetary sized head, the structure frothy, the color a light tan and the lace formed a thick and clinging sheet. Nose is sweet malt, under pined by a light hop aroma, citrus crisp and clean. Start is malt rich, sweet, the top middling in feel with a prickly acidity, the hops pertinent, but not over powering, spicy but nice, quite dry lingering aftertaste. A fine quaffing beer, maybe a first timers American IPA?","Gusler","May 12, 2003"

3.23,-4.4,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"Notes: Not as hoppy as I expected from this IPA. Big on the malts and fruity flavours, and in comparison the hops played little more than a balancing role. Interesting, but it stops there.","Todd","Nov 12, 2002"
4.32,27.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"From my notes from my trip to Maine this summer. I just realized I forgot to review it. Deep golden copper clear color. Thick bubbly beige head. Smells were a combination of toasty carmel malt and lots of oily hop resins. Hop bubbles bust through. Great tasting oily hop kick, crisp and bitter. Fairly good malt sweetness finishes strong. Slightly thinner feel than I expected, but makes for a very drinkable IPA. I look forward to this one next summer if I make it back to Maine.","StevieW","Nov 09, 2002"

A little more malt and a lot of hops and it would be perfect.  But then it would be something from Stone Brewing.","gwfrankpsu","Mar 01, 2002"
