"This very unfiltered beer ends up quite hazy in the glass with a dull copper color and an off white head that laces nicely.  The smell is dominated by light floral and grassy hop notes with a base of crystal and biscuit malt.  While on the tip of the tongue, caramels and biscuity malt shine through but are quickly replaced by a strong bitter character that doesn't come with much in the way of hop flavor other than perhaps some floral spice.  At the finish this is quite puckeringly bitter which lingers nicely inviting the next sip.  Moderate to high carbonation and the lack of an overly sweet malt character make this lively in the mouth.  Overall this is a pretty good English IPA, quite different from the more common American style that we've all grown so accustomed to.  It is nice to get a taste of something a little different like this every once in a while to remind you how IPAs started out."
"Different label than shown ""Fine Organic Ales"" now on the label. 12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Really enjoyed the flavor and smell."

"Too smooth for the contemporary IPA scene; traditional and very good, but without the cheerful finish that I like in any IPA"

"This recipe has changed and this beer is a lot better than it used to be. It now uses Magnum, Fuggles, and Centenial hops with a lighter malt character. Try it again!"

"O: This is a great East Coast Style IPA. I would put the ABV estimate at 6.2% or lower. There is a slight alcohol presense - but nothing distracting. The sweetness balanced with the mild bitter is really nice. The body is fantastic along with the mouthfeel. This is a really enjoyable IPA. I would definitely drink more or share them. This is a beer that an early IPA padawan might like - as they develope their palate. It is a good intro to the style - without being a hop bomb."

"Don't hate on it because you can find it in supermarkets and it's not named Heady Topper."

"very clean tasting bitter ipa. good amt of caramel malt shining through the hops but still hoppy as hell and balanced, clean tasting and a dark orange/amber red color, pretty foggy and unfiltered looking. just a nice one. slightly above average but not a mind blower"

"A GOOD English IPA and a GREAT session IPA. A perfect beer to spend a night with and not regret it in the morning! Definitely a repeat buy!!"

"the English ipa has not been a go to style for me, and they have been increasingly popular in the northeast it seems. this one though, is a winner. a version far superior to its peers. it pours a hazed orange to brass color with a lasting inch of khaki fizz. the nose is nicely hopped, more bitter than anything else in terms of aromatics, with a sturdy but clean rather than filling English malt vibe. less caramel in the malt flavor, more fresh bread, a nice combination with the lightly citric hopping. I get just a touch of grapefruit in the finish. there is a ton of body here, a few of these is ample. nice carbonation and clean finish give it some drinkability though. ive learned that even well made versions of English ipas are not my favorite. this is one of the few times ill ever be patriotic, but the American ipa style, to me, is a much more enjoyable brew than even the best of the English persuasion. this would be a textbook example of the style though, and is worthy of higher praise."

"Poured into becker pint glass; dark orange, slightly cloudy, with a thick fluffy white head that sticks around and leaves nice lacing. Smell is well-balanced, lots of malt with some crackery notes, and some attenuated floral hop scents. Taste is spot on the nose; crackery, slightly sweet malts, and floral juicy hops on the back end with a full, creamy mouthfeel and a wet, crisp finish. Certainly nowhere near as hoppy as its American-style counterparts, but a fine beer."

"Overall: Not one for the ages but it might get you through in a pinch. In the end there just isn't much to write home about in this beer. Very average"

"Overall – Very original, refreshing, made in Vermont IPA. Subtle and good starter IPA. Personally I like the piney crisp complexities of Dales Pale Ale, Stone, Troegs. This one less citrus and more earthy. It is a nice break from the more traditional. Every hop head must try it. Organic! Made in Vermont!"

"Not a bad IPA at all, just a bit boring and bland."
""
""

""
""
""
""
"o - Overall not a bad beer, but a very malty IPA; I was hoping for more hops. Fruity malts throughout and some light citrus hops, Easy to drink and again, not a bad beer, but if you're looking for a hoppy IPA this isn't the one for you."
""

"Overall, this beer is pretty ""meh."" It's okay, but this Wolaver's line is not really impressing me so far."

"This is an easy to drink beer with a decent flavor. It's not very forward, but its enjoyable. I could slug a few of these with ease."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a hazy, bright, peach-copper coloring with a fluffy, white, frothy head that clings all over the glass. Aromas of subtle sweet caramel, resiny, fresh hops, and a light, citrus highlight. Smells very well balanced and very palatable. Flavors are light, with a resiny and peppery hop forward presence that is quickly followed by a light, sweet malt backbone. Much lighter flavors than the aromas lead you to believe. Very smooth and balanced, and very drinkable. Citrus highlights join the party at the end of the palate, and the blend goes right into the aftertaste, with the citrus and spicy hops holding most of the flavor profile at that point. Very tasty and well blended. Light bodied throughout, but still manages to support the flavors. Resiny, slightly bitter finish that dries the mouth. Very tasty IPA."
""
"Overall - definitely a surprisingly tasty beer for it's organic status and I would recommend to an IPA connoisseur looking to expand their palate"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – It is actually quite different then the “more standard” ~ 6-7 % abv IPA. Not nearly as citrus and much more earthy. It is a nice break from the more traditional and is well worth a try."
""
""
"O: A pretty decent IPA with a nice hops flavor that unfortunately isn't to lively. I'm hoping this is a result of not being all that fresh because if the flavors poped it would be an outstanding beer. There is a bit of astringency, while not that bad, that could be reduced by using a high alpha acid hop variety."
""
""
""

"Taste goes from malt to a grassy bitter lemon rind. Not really that appealing. This one for me is a thumbs down. Will not try this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really nice brew here; I really like this one. Case worthy sessionable stuff here. Very good."
"From the 12 fl oz bottle stamped: 32960151712. Sampled on June 9, 2012. The pour is a slightly cloudy medium to dark amber with a foamy beige head that lingers. The aroma is rather hop-free but I get a nice sweet malt note along with a clean, crisp feel. Overall mellow on the nose. The body is light to medium but leaning more to medium. OK, the hops announce themselves with much vigor as early as the first sip. It is moderately bitter toward the end. This is a decent enough IPA."
""
""
""
"O: this was a decent brew. I'm pretty sure I would have this again."
"An ok, but lesser IPA, grab yourself some Broken Halo instead."
""
""
""
""
""
"Moderate carbonation and body, smooth mouthfeel, and easy to drink. Overall I would say this is a very good beer!"
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps I have palate fatigue from all of the heavily hopped West Coast and piney IPA's that this one was a welcomed changed. Very well balanced, easily drinkable, not too English. Suits me well at the moment."
"O- good, but not great. Certainly different from the litany of west coast IPA's out there."
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle purchased at Market Basket in Somersworth. Murky yellow-amber body with a half inch of off-white head. Grass, grapefruit, and lemon waft from the aroma. Lemon, pine, and grass with slight grapefruit notes comprise the flavor. Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Not bad."
""
""
"O - This IPA let a lot to be desired...I really wanted more hop aroma and flavor...the malts got the best of this one"
""
""
""
"Overall damn 2 for 2 but I like this even more than the Southampton version since it has a deeper level of sweet malts next to bittering hops. Six pack would be easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This definitely wasn't the most hoppy IPA that I've had, but it was definitely easily drinkable. Very well balanced between the malty sweetness and the hops, definitely an IPA that I would try again but not go out of my way to buy."
""
""
""
""
"Refreshing, organic, easy drinking. Perfect use of some Vermont water. Good brew, below avg IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark golden color with about a centimeter of head that quickly dissipates. Did not get a strong aroma of anything, but a slight hint of hops. Right away, you taste the hops, but it is not overpowering. Also a slight citrus taste which adds to the overall taste nicely. Carbonation is right and it goes down smooth with not much aftertaste. Definitely one that you could drink all night. A nice IPA, and organic to boot. However, it is like many out there."

"This is a very glowing orange with a nice translucent body and the smell of orange rind. The taste is almost overpoweringly bitter orange--not orange rind, but orange pip!--earthy/herbal hops, and some malt sweetness. Light body that could use better carbonation, finishes quite dry. It's pretty much a middle-of-the-road IPA for me."
""
""
"Overall meh, very little on the hop profile, more bitterness, nose is practically non-existant, and sticky sweet."
""
""
""
"D: Weakish nose, simple malt profile, but flavorful and dynamic hops. Nicely straight forward interpretation of an American IPA."
""
""

""

"O - Overall, this beer was a big disappointment. Was looking forward to having this beer, but regretted getting it."
"This is a session-able IPA; I really hope I don't finish the six pack all in one shot but I might have to. Tasty, nice looking, pleasant smell and easy drinking make this a IPA to try if you see it around."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops. Taste is very hop heavy, considerably bitter, really not much else going on. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall this is a decent beer."
"This is simply a good IPA."
"O: Very good IPA. Not overly hopped. Easy drinker, good for a few anytime."
"This is a pretty decent, albeit average IPA. It's fairly bitter, with the one-note hoppiness overshadowing the malt as expected. Not a lot of detail in terms of flavor. Moderately carbonated and crisp, pretty refreshing overall. This one really doesn't stand out amongst a crowded field although I guess if you're looking for an organic beer than this might be your choice. Not super impressed with Wolaver's offerings to this point, unfortuneately...I have been a patron and visitor to Otter Creek for a long time."
"This is a nice, bitter but drinkable, IPA. Not over the top on aroma and hop flavor, but certainly scratches your hop itch."
"If you want a certified organic IPA I guess this is the one, though it is decidedly average, and surounded by stellar, though not organic, competition on the shelf."
"O: Not a standout IPA but a pleasant, balanced one nonetheless"
"Poured from bottle with minimal head and good amount of lacing. Smell is minimal floral hops, some hay. Hoppy with good malt compliment. Slightly dirty hop/ malt profile. Good balance. Palate is good. Nice bitter dry finish. Good for an organic IPA. Not in my top ten IPA's maybe but a good choice if you're into ""organic"" products."
"o-glad to find an ipa thats a little lighter on the hops. although some people may discredit this beer for not being as hoppy as a traditional ipa, i like it."
"O) A nice IPA not too ridiculous on the hops but a notice dose of them. I'd definitely have another."
"This is an all-around good IPA. It's not too crazy, and it's not boring. I could drink a lot of it. I'm confused by the 14.85% pDev... Maybe this beer is inconsistent? I've had this a few times, and it's always been all-around good."
"O: OK. I've had better, that's for sure."
"Cheers"
"My first organic beer, and I have to say it's not too bad. Poured a nice honey gold, with creamy white head that held on for a good bit. Smell has vibrant citrus mixed with a little vanilla. I got a bit of a chemical taste on the first sip, but the lemony hops jumped to the middle of my tongue quickly. Good bite, nice dry finish that lingers just a little bit. I have a six in my fridge and I'm happy knowing it's there; ready and willing to spend the rest of the weekend with me..."
"O - Overall a very impressive IPA. I'm surprised at the relatively low scores. This is a beer that smells divine and has a taste that matches it. Not the best ever, but I'd be happy to have this in my fridge each day."
"O - Very well balanced for an American IPA. That is not always a compliment but for this beer it is. Even certified hop heads like myself should check this out. Solid ABV% as well."
"12oz bottle pours a hazy golden amber with minimal head and some decent clinging lacing. Aroma is light, with some pine, earthy hints, yeasty, and maybe a faint nit of citrus. Mouthfeel is medium bodies, and with a fair amount if carbonation. Taste is like a sweet bread, with some earthiness, and a hint of pine and orange peels. Very dry. This is a slightly different tasting IPA. It is worth drinking again, I prefer many others of this style."
"This is pretty easygoing for an IPA and although I couldn't taste the alcohol, I could certainly feel it once I finished the contents of my glass. This isn't a bad beer but with so many other IPA's on the market, there's no real reason to seek this out. I could picture myself having one of these on a summer day since I didn't need any water to wash this down but otherwise, there's nothing particularly memorable about this beer."
"12oz bottle. Pours a cloudy burnt orange with a medium sized head. Fair amount of lacing. Aroma is bready, sour, orange peel and maybe a bit earthy. Flavor is like a bitter brown sugary bread kind of taste. Some hop flavor but its mixed in. Fair amount of bitterness. Somewhat sour. Orange peel flavor peeks out at the end. This doesn't quite taste like a lot of the IPAs out there. Overall, it is decent but I've had better. Not in a rush to have it again."
"O Average nothing to write home about but nothing to run out and buy either It's OK"
"D: Very drinkable, could definitely down this one quickly if I wanted, and could definitely drink a couple of these in an evening."
"Pours a one finger head, body is copper in color and is too cloudy to see through. It looks okay. On the nose I pick up primarily a sweet smell, which I fear is the malts. I also pick up a small hop smells, but not nearly as much as I should be smelling in an American IPA, I'm worried this beer will have too much malts, not enough hops. Yeah, on the taste you don't get nearly as much hop taste as you should. It tastes fairly watered down to be honest. Instead of a lot of hops it just tastes like water with a little sweetness and a little malts, and then a tiny tiny bit of hops. This should not be considered an IPA. For sure the most disappointing Wolaver's I have had, all there other beers have redeeming qualities, the only redeeming quality to this beer is it's drinkability."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer, but not for the right reasons. It is a goog tasting beer and pleasant to drink, however it just doesn't stick out from the pack. Drinks more like an English bitter than an IPA."
"D: Considering its strength, this beer is rather easy to drink because the alcohol is hidden from the taste."
"d=4.5- simple taste and medium body make this very drinkable"
"Drinkability is ok. It would have been higher except for that weird tinny taste that isn't going away."
"Caramel and a decent amont of hopping. The malt structure is too much though for this. It clouds the hops, weighs on the mouthfeel, grows into the heavy woody feel. Too bad how it finishes, it starts out with a little promise."
"Drinkability: This IPA was just alright. The heavier body and dulled flavor profile definitely hurt the beer's drinkability, but I still had no problem finishing it."
"D - This is a very enjoyable beer. Very different for an IPA - I would like more hops and less malt, but still a good beer."
"Meh."
"Taste has a yeasty mouldy feel to it throughout, in spite of a dominant red ale maltiness it holds. very light bitter finish, more of an aftertaste than an actual finishing edge. medium bodied, rather refreshing than filling. well-carbonated, nice brunchy blend."
"quite a drinkable beer, I enjoyed this more than a brighter, more hoppy IPA."
"D - Not particularly great but not bad by any means. Decent drinkability; fairly solid throughout."
"Pours a hazy light orange color with a finger of white head. Little bit of lacing and even less retension. Slight malty sweet aroma coming through the citrus hops in the nose. Taste is bitter upfront and has a nice lingering bitterness in the finish that clings to the tongue. Thin bodied and low carb but still enjoyable. Not much of a wow factor but a soild example for the style."
"drinkability is good - while i am not blown away with the flavors - there is something that made me drink this one pretty fast"
"D: Lackluster for the style as this would fit into the APA category."
"Pours a deep copper color with a slight white head. The aroma is of citrus hops and some piney hops along with a sweet malt smell. The taste has a sweet caramel backbone with a nice citrus and pine hop bite, however, the bite fades quickly. The mouthfeel is of moderate carbonation. Overall it is a solid beer, but not one of the best ipa's that you will ever have. Nothing to stand out about it, but nothing to make you dislike it either."
"Notes: Always a pleasure to find this craft brews sneaking into less savvy tap selections. A nice IPA that with a smooth and apparent lighter early taste is great to share with friends starting to approach the style."
"While this is easy drinking and pleasing, it is not outstanding. I don't really consider this an IPA. There is not bitterness. If I had to guess without seeing the bottle I would say I was drinking an APA."
"D: Drinks great - will definitely be getting again. Not too filling or too rich."
"D - If you take it slow it's pretty good."
"The taste is a very hoppy with substantial grapefruit overtones. Lots of fruity overtones. This is a very refreshing beer on a warm day, I could drink these all day long. I'm not sure if I prefer this to SN Torpedo or Commodore Perry, still excellent."
"Poured a copper color with a tiny head; nice aroma of hops. Crisp carbonation with nice malt and hop combo, but not extremely hoppy; somewhat of a metal taste mixed with the hops flavor, but overall a pretty good beer. Went down easy and is quite drinkable."
"Other comments: A modest, well-balanced IPA with fantastic drinkability."
"Pours a pale copper hue with a large off white head, nice retention going on. Aroma has some muted pine cone with a spice citrus note, but overall has a sour twang with earthy hops almost tobacco notes. Flavors have sugary pale malts with a burst of light alcohol, hops have citrus rind and pine cone tip bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied carbonation is prett lively, nice dry aftertaste. Drinkability is solid but definitely my least fave out of the 3 I tried from the sampler compared to the pale and the brown ales."
"D: Very much so. This is a nice touch on the American IPA style. The organic factor gives you something to thing about while sipping. Recommended to those ""green"" IPA fans around the nation. I might drink again, but will most likely opt out for more punch. Still not too shabby."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, it's not one of the better IPA's that I've had but it's still a decent beer to drink for a while."
"Of the many IPAs I've had this one is definitely lower tier I must say. Has a high ABV but.. where are the hops? Both in aroma and taste, you don't get too much... very malty. I also found this beer a bit watery. I mean don't get me wrong, it's a good tasting beer.. just there's a lot of other craft beers that taste much better. The whole organic thing is phooey to me, I don't believe that makes anything taste better, but look to Otter Creek or Long Trail for better Vermont offerings."
"Highly malted for an IPA. Where's the hops? Some spiciness with swallow. Thin, grainy mouthfeel."
"D - This is a very nice IPA. Yet another good one from Otter Creek."
"A fine member of the Wolaver's family or certified organic brews. The flavor might build and be too much for some ale drinkers, but there's more here than just the alcohol bite and notable hops."
"Overall - Very interesting IPA. The flavor is phenomenal."
"Light, clear orange body with sparse effervescence... short-lived white head clings to glass in large bubbles... perfume scents flutter with butterscotch (?) and vanilla--quite aromatic.... soft and bright on the travel through the mouth... quite ""noisy"" at the throat--overall, an active yet unsettled body... vanilla oak, spruce and lighter hops mix nicely--little alcohol aftertaste--with a medium-bodied weight... perhaps enough of an IPA to demand a snifter, but not as on-point as their pale ale and not as malty either...."
"D-Critiqueing this style is tough. The beer is not hoppy enough for a West Coast APA and lacks the malty goodness of a true British IPA. I think that a beer that wants to be organic is great, however, it tastes like a standard recipe with organic ingredients. It seems like its weak on all fronts. Good flavor, don't get me wrong, just not enough of it."
"D: Overall not bad just a bit tame per style. An organic beer should focus more on malt quality then producing a middle of the road standard west coast ipa that gets lost amongst the numerous others."
"D: It's a good try. I've definately had much worse. All these organic beers seem to always have something off about them. There are better/cheaper ipas out there, so I wont be buying this one again."
"Kudo's for the organic thing though."
"Mouthfeel was fine, as was drinkability. But not a great IPA. Overall, disapppointing as I've had other organic IPA's and really enjoyed them."
"Pours an orange yellow color with a haze and a nice white head that hangs around for a bit. Smells of spices and hops. Actually a pretty crisp and refreshing taste, of there were hops but not overpowering. It was a good blend with the spices too. Went down on and mouthfeel was alright. I won't be seeking this one out again, but I'd say give it a shot."
"Pours a clear lighter amber. Nose is very similar to the pale ale. Light with a slight nutty tone. Flavor has an earthy brightness to it. Very well balanced. Real distinct mature flavor tones. Thick but not overdone maltiness. Feel is thick on the liquid body and an even carbonation. Hmmmm. A tasty ipa. Another nice one from this brewery."
"Like this much better than the PA from the same brewery. Still leaning towards the Brit style of hoppy ale. Lighter in color than the PA as well. More head and lace too. Alcohol is very noticable. Biscuity character of the Munich malt stands out. Ok beer."
"A pretty good beer because I do like the style but not really anything special. Golden, almost orange color, with a nice head and lots of lace. The aroma is very fruity with a little hops and vanilla. The flavor is sweet grapefruit but not as hoppy as I thought it would be. Some crisp bitterness."
"Bottle: Poured a light brown color ale with some orangey notes and nice foamy head with good retention and no lacing. Aroma consists of very light bitter hops which are disappointing considering the style. Taste is a mix between a bland light caramel malt profiles with a very light bitter finish. I expect some bitter or citrus flavour in my IPA which I didn't get here. I have to admit that this one was a big disappointment."
"Drinkability- I liked it. It is an overall good balanced beer."
"D: Very drinkable. Hey, it's certified organic. Pass the tofu."
"This poured a clear gold with a bit of off-white head. It smelled like barley malt with citrus and copper hops. It tasted like bold copper hops and earthy malted barley, with some licorice. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a somewhat lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this had pretty good flavor and a clean taste, with decent body. But it didn't have any real depth or unique character."
"Drinkability is very nice. The good hop taste is dimmed down by the caramel malts balancing the beer very nice. A very impressive IPA, especially for an organic."
"I guess you could drink a few of these because it is a bi muted in flavor. Decent representation, but you can do better."
"D- Nice and drinkable. Maybe more of a birtish IPA. Out of the mixer I think I liked the Pale Ale the best, but over all I think this is a nice branch of Otter Creek."
"Don't drink and review."
"I dont knowif the surroundings had anything to do with it or what, but this wasone fine beer."
"Overall, pretty good. One of the better organic IPA's that I've had. It still has a little ways to go to be a truly great IPA, but it is more than acceptable. If you're into the organic thing, (which I am as far as food is concerned), this is well worth trying. Otherwise, I'd recommend getting some, but don't go out of your way for it."
"D: Very drinkable, 6.5 is surprising, but will help you get to where you want to be, heh. Overall not a bad beer, but there are much better."
"Feels fizzy with a bite at the end. It's really more like a pilsner than an IPA. Better as it warms but disappointing."
"D - A pleasant surprise, and a pretty tasty brew. This is a mild IPA and doesn't really compare to the west coast styles, but all in all it is very good and definitely worth a try."
"I dould drink several of these bad boys"
"D - This is the definition of a session IPA. I really can't say a negitave thing about this beer. This is the second Wolavers I've had and both have been outstanding. I mean, are there better IPA's out there, of course there are but this is straight and to the point enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"It does flatten a bit near the end, a disappointment. In sum, a decent IPA, one worth trying. There are far better examples of the style for certain."
"Overall a nice and fresh beer. I enjoyed the caramel and floral mix. Not as hoppy as most IPAs."
"Recommended..."
"Pours a medium amber with bright, lighter amber highlights. Little head, but nice lace. The aroma is a very balanced blend of caramel malts and lifting, citrusy hops. Things are downplayed, though, compared to a lot of IPAs, and the major effect is one of light, sweet malts with a light dose of hops in the background that lighten the proceedings and give an impression of aromatic suspension. On the palate, malt sweetness first off before the hops come through midway in. From the middle to the end, there's an excellent integration of hops and malt, with each one showing its character while meshing with the other. Well done. Mouthfeel is very good, with an excellent balance of carbonation, acidity, and weight. Overall, this is a damn tasty beer. Very good!"
"The low point is the aroma, which to my olfactory senses is slightly skunked until the beer settles in, a bit too grapefruity, slightly cloying maltishness, and not enticing. Things improve as the beer settles, but the opening act is critical for me. That said, the appearance is the high note. The beer is a nice amber, with a bubbly white head, moderately carbonated, medium bodied, a bit syrupy in consistency, and well balanced. You will get some grapefruity, slightly tangy hop tastes balanced against some bready sweet malts, maybe some dextrin malts. The aftertaste is mild, and this is a drinkable beer, but not brilliant. This beer definitely improves with settling, with more balance and more moderation in character."
"Mouthfeel is rich enough and crisp. Drinkability is great. No hint of higher alcohol, smooth and rich enough with a very pleasant taste."
"Drinkability is solid, a great beer from Wolaver`s."
"Overall, I was impressed with this beer. Not a hophead's IPA, but a very well done and highly drinkable version."
"D: Easy to drink but not tasty enough to think about. But it was free!"
"Sad to say but this IPA that I looked forward to due to using some of my favorite varieties of hops was kind of a let down."
"D - If you like IPA then I say this one is a good all around because it's not as heavy as a regular 8-10% IPA. Great beer."
"Eh, it's a passable IPA, but not anything worth seeking out. I've found this to be the case with every Wolaver's I've had, which is strange because I like most of Otter Creek's stuff."
"The balance of flavours makes this seem a little too bitter for my liking. Otherwise a smooth, slick body with a bright carbonation."
"Overall this was a nice IPA. I have of course had better, and also had much, much worse, but this one will definitely work. I was surprised by the balance it posed, not simply relying on a ton of hops to push through the flavor. A really nice choice and a good call."
"Overall, this is an above average American IPA. I wouldn't seek it out unless you were looking for an organic brew."
"It poured a nice copper color with a nice fluffy white head that had some pretty good retention to it. Nice and malty and moderately hoppy. The after taste was about the same. Over all it the flavor was a tad watery, just kinda bitter. The beer had a medium body to it and was drinkable. Maybe not my favorite IPA but it was a solid beer regardless."
"At one point, I actually went and looked at the bottle to see if it really was listed as an IPA, could have much more easily passed as an English Ale. Again, not bad, just not an IPA."
"Overall, a solid IPA. Probably not as bold as other hoppier IPAs, but this is a nice change of pace, and probably a good introduction to the style for folks who aren't usually into hoppy beers. Nevertheless, this brew can stand out on its own for exhibiting a solid balance of hops and malts with a pleasurable tangy/sweet taste."
"This is a good looking beer. Nice darker amber beer under a good head that sticks to the glass. Smell is sweet with herbal, pine, and some citrus, everything an IPA should be. Taste matches to the T. Hops hit the palate first, but sweet malt flavors show up later on. Just a great tasting beer. Mouthfeel was moderate with enough carbonation. Easy drinking for an IPA. Balance all around. Unique as well."
"Recommended"
"very smooth, with appropriate carbonation. nice - and organic to boot"
"Wow. What a pleasant surprise. This hazey amber ale had a big beautiful off-white head with great frothy lacing. Chewy looking already. The aroma just adds to the suspense with an incredible carmel and butterscotch sweetness mixed with malt. The hops are a little tough to detect in the aroma, but there is some piney presence, but it smells like it's more toward a brown ale than an IPA. But then the first taste brings out a unique blend of the bitter hops and the creamy butterscotch. Good stuff. It has a slick and silky feel, full bodied, milkshake-like. Just a slight bite from the hops but for the most part this is a mellow mouthful of complex flavor. This is a great change of pace in the world of quality IPA's. There is an unusual Dr. Pepper like quality, but I obviously like it, very different, very good."
"Overall: A very good, well balanced IPA."
"This beer is not only hoppy, not overly so, but extremely flavorful. It has a very very small hint of sweetness. Very full flavor. It has been a while since I have had one of these ales, but I am enjoying one now, and it is delicious. I am an avid IPA drinker and rate this one in the top 2 or 3 on my list."
"This well made india pale ale could pass as a superbly dry hopped pale ale because of the malt balance in the nose and flavor. The hops used(Magnum,Crystal and Hallertauer) give a unique hop profile not usually found in domestic IPA's. Bitter lemon iced tea flavors and the unmistakable flowery, herbal aroma and bitter taste of Hallertauer hops mix well with the perfectly malted barley aromas and flavors that include caramel and toasted grain. A slight alcohol warmth rounds out the flavor. Great head, lace and carbonation, which is smooth to creamy show this really is a well crafted brew. Oh, and it's organic which means little to some and much to others. This along with the Oatmeal Stout Wolaver's produces ends the question of whether superb beers can be made organically. The answer is yes."
"More rich and malty than expected, still a smooth and enjoyable brew."
"Flavor sports the hops up front with a subtle sweet malty character in the back. Hints of orange, freshly cut wood, earthy spices. The fact that the hops are not as intense allows some of the subtlety shine through. As it warmed the hops became stronger and spicier."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. A bit syrupy. It's not very drinkable as it just doesn't taste all that good. Overall, it's very average."
"D- A reasonably well balanced IPA, not overly hoppy nor sweet."
"Drinkability- Not too bad for an IPA but nothing special either. I know I've had better organic IPAs but this one does try."
"This is a nice, clean, but average IPA. It's good, but not great if you know what I mean. There's a nice caramel malt backbone over American citrusy hops that's fairly drinkable to anyone that's into the style. Try this one if it's local or if you're into organic beer, otherwise it's just another good IPA."
"I'm on record as deploring the ""breakfast citrus"" trend that seems to be taking over so much American craft beer. But this one isn't overdone."
"Retry 3/9/2007: This bottle sploded with a huge white cratered head. Sharply acidic aroma. Tangy pine hoppiness, grassy, earthy. Puckeringly tart finish. Only slight score adjustments. (Original: Brilliant light orange with a slightly rocky white head. Little aroma, really. A relatively robust grassy hop flavor with an almost spicy finish. Very earthy, this one.)"
"I hope to find a fresher batch to sample, but this one even being almost 6 months old, held onto its hop character. Go Organic!!"
"Overall, this is a decent IPA of the ""it's ok to be malty"" school of thought. If the lack of overwhelming American hops doesn't bother you, then give this beer a try. All the more so if you find the organic philosophy attractive,"
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, astringent, with generous and pleasant carbonation addiing to it. Drinkability is OK, but this ale seems a little one-dimensional to me. The flavor is nothing extraordinary, and the lack of balancing malts is disappointing enough that I don't know if I'd get another sixer of this. There are plenty of IPAs out there that offer more for my tastes."
"From the brewers of Otter Creek, this ""certified organic"" IPA pours a golden orange color. Thin head and a noticeable, but somewhat watery, lace is left as it drains. Floral hoppy aroma with hints of citrus deep down. A nice hoppy flavor, with a decent malted undertone and a slight alcohol finish. Kind of a woody aftertaste, which I'm not all that crazy about, but isn't offensive. I feel like I'm missing something else here, but can't put my finger on it. Not a bad mouthfeel, and an entirely drinkable IPA. There are better IPAs out there which are readily accessible, however, and while I like the Wolaver's line in general, I wouldn't specifically seek them out. But a nice beer nonetheless."
"Halfway through and there's very little trace of hop aroma and then the malt takes over. Tastes o.k., but there are plenty of better options for an American IPA. I will not seek this out again, but if we cross paths I can consume it. I guess I'm indifferent."
"Solid IPA bitterness and finish, a little astringent in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is okay but could stand to be a bit dryer. Among the best organic ales I've ever had, although that's not really saying much. This is a drinkable brew but not quite top notch."
"The smell has plenty of hops but it isn't a good combination. Also, it has a burnt and stale flavor. The taste is no better. It starts with burnt malt flavors and an unappealing type of bitterness takes over in the finish. The mouthfeel is fine, though."
"So far, where I'm from this beer is easy to get-- a plus."
"Pours a clear copper color with an eggshell white head that leaves a soap-like lace. Aroma is a floral hop bouquet, with a few malt notes in the background. Taste is a generous floral hop flavor up front, with a toasted breadlike malt background. Finishes clean with a mild hop flavor left to beg for the next sip. Well balanced for an IPA, maybe not the most impressive sample of the style, but still a solid one. A 6-pack of these would go down very easy on warm day with a juicy burger, or any good barbecue for that matter."
"Great with a spicy burger on a sunday afternoon!"
"Pours a clear copper color with a two finger width white head that fads to a film over time. Smells wonderfully hoppy with some malt thrown in. Taste is nicely balanced with good malt and nice hops that are overly bitter but very flavorfull. The mouthfeel is good, could stand to be a little heavier. A very drinkable IPA."
"Cheers!"
"In short, it's local, cheap, organic and a tasty beer to boot. What's not to love?"
"A good, drinkable IPA - not something to have if you are really a hop fanatic - but especially enjoyable if you like more mild IPAs (as I do). And, if you are organically-inclined it's even more of a reason to try it."
"What started out as a very attractive beer slowly (or maybe rapidly) went downhill. Poured a deep amber color with monstrous slightly off-white puffy head. Beautiful lacing. Smell is a a bit hoppy, a bit malty, mixed with alcohol notes. Taste is very strange. I detect a strong hop bitterness which slowly fades into a very unpleasant taste that is difficult to get out of the mouth. Each taste erases it, but then it slowly resturns. Gets a little better as it warmed to at least allow me to finish it. Never again."
"Rich, burnished gold with a short, eggshell head of tiny bubbles that quickly collapsed leaving a single disc of fine dust. Several jetting carbonation streams are visible. Thick strands of lacing trailed the sides of the glass. Rich resiny pine and citrus notes with some residual malt dominate the smell and there is also a spicy hint as well. Rich with lightly roasted malt up front which is quickly followed by the piney hop bite. Finishes with a slight citrusy edge, but that is balanced with the modest malt body. The crispness lingers in a pleasing way. Medium body with a light, tight mouthfeel, relatively gentle carbonation. Well done and enjoyable."
"This is a drinkable beer. Not great, but drinkable. The taste is a bit off for an IPA, long on malt and short on hops. This beer is not available in my area, so I probably wont have it again."
"CRUX: ORGANIC IPA IS A PALE ALE...must've been an organic hop shortage when they made this brew...when they throw a lot more organic hops into this beer, i'll gladly buy it and drink it without reservation....guess i'll stick with my arsenal of ""non-organic"" IPAs for now...."
"This is, as stated, a decent but basic brew. Hops and malt are well balanced and it definitely falls more in line with an English-style IPA as opposed to an American-style one."
"freshness date of 2-15-06, poured with an inch of white head, raw hops and earthy aroma, pale orange in color, very clear, bitter and dry, lacks a balanced and distinctive hop flavor that i have come to enjoy in other IPA's, and from what I read the choice of organic hops available to brewers is extremely small, i hope this changes in the future as I believe there is promise in this brew, not as sweet as other IPA's which can be a welcome change. Overall it wasn't quite what I expected being my first organic beer, I was expecting more of a robust flavor, the ideal of organic products does appeals to me and I hope more breweries will try their hand in the production of organic beers in the future"
"This beer had little head. The color was an orangish amber and it was slightly cloudy. The smell is a sweet piney smell. The taste is fairly bitter with a nice lasting bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth. There is a bittersweet that lasts for a while. The drinkability is good. I could certainly drink this brew again. Another fine offering from Vermont. A good representation of the style."
"Pours a golden/orangeish color with a poofy white head- super clear- kind of reminds me of a pilsner or lager. Smell is sweet and hoppy, some sourness in the form of a zesty citrusness. But something is a bit off. And it's kind of boring. Taste is not as hoppy as an IPA should be. Grassy and floral, and kind of bitter. Mouthfeel is oily and slick, and very wet. Bubbly and sort of frothy. It's an easy to drink brew, but this is no IPA."
"Clear, golden yellow with a small film of off-white head. Nose of candyish malt sweetness, grain, and peppery floral hop aromas. Lightly sweet biscuity malt, some graininess. Hops come on peppery, spicy, with a touch of floral. Bitter enough. Finish is fruity with lingering hop burn. Light-medium bodied with a tad creamy feel. A pleasant, if a bit rough, IPA. Organic is a bonus!"
"Pours crystal clear amber/copper with a thin-ish head. Smell is very yeasty and not much else, oddly. A bit of ... toasted hop aroma? That's all I can think of to describe it. Taste is very bitter-oriented, not as much bright hop flavor. The flavor that is there has a sour, kind of burny character that I think I was smelling. I kind of disagree with the characterization of this beer as an American-style IPA; it may use American hops, but the bitter-balance and relatively tame hop taste make it seem more like one of the Brits. Interestingly, this all resolves to a splendid aftertaste; I like each sip better after it's gone. I'd try it again but won't go out of my way to find it."
"On a different note, kudos to Wolaver's for putting the ""bottled on"" date on their beers... this one bottled on 11/10/05."
"""Organic""? thanks for sharin' but this camp ain't carin'. seriously the whole organic campaign is a joke. There are tons of beers that are organic and don't put it on their label. Who cares."
"Overall: Nothing to see here, please move along."
"Pours a pale copper color with a thin white lace of foam. Strong sweet smells hops. Smells a bit spicy with a little citrus. There is also a graininess to the smell. Very strong hop bite with a bready taste of grains. There is also a taste of the alcohol as it warms the belly. Nice hop aftertaste, a good blend of strong/spicy hops and carmalized grains. The hops are pleasing without being overpowering and taking away from the beer. Nice mellow but far from bland IPA by Wolaver's."
"A good flavored IPA; not a hop monster by any means, but flavorfully hoppy and organic is a good combination in my book."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is good as this is a well balanced beer with a pretty good hop malt relationship. The dryness of the finish was unexpected, but welcomed. I would think the drinkability would be high on this offering from Wolaver's. A pretty solid IPA."
"I was pleased with this beer. I'm sure it would be much better fresh; mine was from the dollar bin of assorted singles."
"It has everything I love in a good American IPA, perhaps not in perfect balance, though. Nevertheless, I'd buy it again."
"In any case, it's an ok attempt at the style. I wouldnt go out of my away to get this one though."
"Easy to drink and reasonabley refreshing, but not quite right for the style."
"***revisiting this 2 yrs later, I enjoyed it much more. A good solid IPA delivering an abundant yet not oppressive amount of hops balanced by just the right malt profile. Becoming my regular drinker at a local hang-out. Best had on-tap."
"This copper colored brew was served with a two finger head that left plenty of lacing. Nose had a citrus floral hopped aroma-very nice. Taste started with a biscuity malt but was taken over by a light floral citrusy hops. Mouthfeel was a bit thin and the carbonation was OK. Overall drinkability was OK. This was a nice beer."
"Biscuity sweet grain blend with a slight bitter finish. Fruity apricot flavors. This reminds me of an English IPA. Good drinkability level at a surprising 6.5% ABV."
"Let's start with the smell? It's strong, but what is it? Burnt corn stalks? Burnt newspaper? Something burnt...something not right. Then, the taste--yeah, it could be corn stalks or newspaper. It's the hops that are the culprit--they don't taste like hops in beer, more like hops eaten straight off the cone, which I did out of curiosity at a recent Sam Adams brewery tour. I do recommend that you eat at least one hops cone in your life, just to see what it's like and to say that you did, but I can't recommend that you try this beer. (Apart from the hops, this beer looks and tastes weak and thin...just in case you were wondering)."
"Overall- Not a good 1. Sometimes Organic isn't always better!"
"Drinkable, yes. I would have to rank this as an entry level IPA however."
"I know this bottle of Wolaver's India Pale Ale is reasonably fresh and has been well cared for. That's because it was hand carried from the brewery to me when it was less than one month old. More's the pity (and the sheer, stupifying wonder) that it tastes so bad. I'm still willing to give Otter Creek/Wolaver's more chances, because a good portion of what they brew is decent. But this one? Never again."
"This is my first Wolaver's variety from Otter Creek and first strictly ""organic"" beer in general. A very agreeable IPA - not anything amazing but I could drink quite a few of these and be perfectly happy."
"This is the first of the Otter Creek organic beers that I've had. I wasn't sure what to expect, but was pleasantly suprised. I'd get it again. Another tasty beer..."
"Its an easy drinking beer, worth a try."
"Pours a white, two finger-head that vanishes slowly leaving some lace. Clear amber color. Light carbonation and light bodied. Nose is faintly hoppy. Starts with more malts than hops but sweetness fades to a hoppy finish. A mild and not overbearing IPA. $1.60 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Drinkability- It looked so nice....but alas, looks can are in some cases are, very deceiving. Onward in my quest to find a decent tasting organic IPA."
"Aroma of piney hops, grass, and floral notes. Very crisp clean flavor, with a long-lasting, tangy hop finish. Medium body is about right for style. Improving as it warms ( malt base emerges). Drinkable IPA."
"Pours a clear apricot gold body with a small bonewhite head that retains well and leaves attractive patchy lace all over the glass. Aroma has a subdued note of pine cone hops, but is mostly citrus fruity. Orange notes dominate, complimented by a hint of grassy clover honey. Mouthfeel reveals a light medium body with moderate carbonation. Taste is grassy and fruity, with orange esters providing a sweet citrusy note. Good pale malt base with a bitter closing that resurrects the pine cone hoppiness. Very tasty and enjoyable, but not exactly to style. Thanks to mtnlover for this bottle."
"Thanks to Sulldaddy for providing this one. Pours a half-finger white/lightly tainted yellow head that quickly settled to a ring over the crystal clear light-rust-orange liquid. Smells of honey, oranges, apricto, peaches, caramel, and a hint of grapefruit pith. To taste, the hops are too mild for an IPA. Wet sweet with fruits mostly. Starts apricot sweet and malty with a hint of caramle. A faint hop bitter comes in the middle carrying hop orange and woody qualities. Grassy cohumulone is low. Immediately after swallowing, I get a moment of grapefruit hop, but this quickly changes to a more metallic and woody hop that starts the aftertaste. The aftertaste is more bitter than during the taste and is accompanied by a pleasing gentle caronbation sting on the whole flat of my tongue. Md mouthfeel and mildly cabonated. The final sips were taken after allowing the beer to warm a while. Grapoefruit pith is more prevalent and hits earlier. The malt and fruity sweet are still there and I'd say all is in balance...for and APA. A pleasure to drink on a hot summer evening."
"Mouthfeel is good, decent carbonation, nothing really to get worked up about. Drinkability is good, this would be a decent session beer although the ABV might put it out of that realm for some. Over all a good to solid IPA, nothing to go nuts over, but a decent choice."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a big white head that leaves spidery lacing down the glass. Smell is floral hops with a light biscuit background, pretty average for an IPA of this strength. The taste is grassy, resiny hops with a light floral background and a bready malt backbone that balances the beer a little. The hop's werent really as big or complex as i was expecting, really a middle of the road ipa in my book. The carbonation is somewhat high for an IPA and it makes it refreshing and crisp but the finish is dry and not bitter enough in my opinion. A descent brew but nothing special."
"Wolaver's IPA is a crisp, flavorful, and rejuvenating golden ale with a long-standing head of bright white froth and a nose that welcomes you without screaming at you. It's both malty and hoppy without particularily leaning to either side. It's solid malt base is peppered with grassy and spicy hops; and it's delicately zesty carbonation and solid bitterness help to bring that spiciness out before it fades into a long lasting, bitter end. It may be a bit mainstream as far as IPAs go, but it's certainly very well done!"
"Wolaver's Organic IPA pours a very light clear golden color with a thin white head. Small bubbles rise throughout the beer over the course of the pint. Aroma is hoppy and citrusy, with some slight buttery/wheaty notes. Not as agressive in the nose as I would like to see in an American IPA. Taste - well, if I didn't know better, I'd say this beer had some wheat in it. But other than a body that was a bit too light, the beer is quite hoppy and a good session beer. I have heard that ingredients for organic brewing can be limited, and this is a pretty good stab at an IPA. I'll definitely pick it up again, but it is nowhere near as good as their organic oatmeal stout."
"P.S., after reading other reviews, I don't know what to say, whether there were issues with other batches or freshness problems, but this bottle was nothing but fine!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" off-white head over the clear golden brew. Head is fluffy and fades relatively slowly, with nice lacing. Aroma is lightly of sweet pale malts, with a touch of citrusy hops. The taste is upfront with slight sweetness, quickly giving way to somewhat grassy and citrusy bitterness of the hops. Mouthfeel is knocked due to the mundane bitter aftertaste, I expect so much more from well-hopped IPAs. Drinkability is alright. I know the ""organic"" label sells a product for some, but to me we're looking at the final product, not necessarily how what went into it was grown. In my mind, there's better IPAs to check out before this one, but it's still not a bad IPA. Just could be better."
"Drinkability is well ok wouldn't be my first choice or probably any choice again but it is a change from the West Coast IPA's I happen to love."
"This beer seems more of the English style than the American, and that's cool. Caramel malts and mild hop varieties make for a refreshing brew."
"This is not the typical hop dominant beer that I look for in an IPA. It was fairly tasty and easily drinkable, but also nondescript and easily forgettable."
"Bottled on: 11/09/04"
"A nice head, about 1 1/2 fingers, that held up well and left clinging rings. A very floral aroma with no detectable alchol tones. I was quite excited to take a sip. The taste is equally floral and starts out a bit sweet. Much weaker hop impact than I had hoped for. Where are my hops? The beer feels smooth in the mouth and finishes clean, with no lingering hop aftertaste. There are much worse, but for the price there are also much better IPA's on the shelves."
"Not sure if I should actually list this brew here but will. It is the Wolvers IPA but is from one of the special batches that is only available at the brewery to bring home in growlers. It is a batch of only four barrels called Cask Conditioned Wolvers IPA and from what I was told they where aged/matured in Chardonnay Barrels. It definitely had the qualities of the Wolvers IPA but also did poses a Chardonnay like aroma and taste. The brew held up nicely in the growler for a few days and when poured had a slightly cloudy orange/yellow color with a nice sized white head that had pretty good retention and left a fair amount of lacing. The aroma had a very robust hop scent that did dominate but you where able to pick up notes of malt and toffee and the Chardonnay aroma that I talked about before. The taste was also dominated by the hops but did seem to be more refined than with the initial smell. The hop flavors are of pine and citrus but I feel that the pine notes win out. Also notice some nice fruit like characteristics that go well with the hop taste, also notice a pretty good amount of malt that balances it out quite well. I must say that this was a good brew, wish that I lived closer to Middlebury to try some of the other brewery specific concoctions! I was told that some of the brewery only offerings could possibly make its way out into distribution as a special/seasonal series, lets hope so!"
"Pouring from a bottle into a goblet, it poured a beautiful golden/amber color w/ a nice 2cm of foamy, sticky looking head, that clung to the glass like Spiderman on Jane, leaving nice latticework or lacing on my glass. The head did dissipate some leaving a nice edge layer around the top of the beverage. Taking a few whiffs, I was pleasantly suprised to find that this IPA was not all hops as I had suspected, but had more hints of fruit (white grapes or plums) and even had some semblance of chocolate in there somewhere, which I found very intriguing. Slight alcohol tingled my nosehair a bit as well, which is always fun for me when I drink a beer! TAking a sip, it came to my palette very sweet natured, with little hops at first. The white grapes really jumped out at the tip of my tongue w/ some sugary taste, but then gave way to a nice earthy hops flavor that covered my palette on back until the swallow. Upon swallowing, this left a nice sweet floweriness (if I can describe it any better) and left a nice grassy aftertaste reminding me of cut grass in spring or summer! One knock on this one was the feel of it however. It's high carbonation beat on my palette pretty hard, and it never really gives way until the swallow, which may have taken away from some of the flavor. However, I got much more than I expected from this one, and it was a very nice crispy ale w/ a sneaky little 6.5% alcohol that I would recommend to just about anyone!"
"One inch of creamy, dense foam sits on a slightly hazy, reddish brown beer. Sticky strata of lacing. Sweet milk chocolate aroma. A chocolate, floral front with a deep, malty, milky middle. Fairly bitter, tangy, chocolate finish with some celery. I kind of like this: a chocolatey, bitter, hoppy beer."
"Final Thought: Not a bad brew from the OC-Wolaver group..."
"this doesn't bowl you over but is done well in all categories, good session beer in the fall/winter. just enough to cut spicy foods imo."
"sampled a few 12 ouncers, with bottled on dating, yeah fresh beer! Pours a clear golder amber, white head. Leaves light wispy lacing. Full, hoppy, grainy nose, maybe also a note of rye. Medium bodied, grainy dry hops up front, maybe a tad thin in the malt to smooth this one out, still a drinkable ale, Long lasting bitter and drying hops on the tongue. Worth a try, decent sessioner"
"Clear reddish gold under a one finger off-white head that lingers nicely and leaves very good lace rings. Nice crisp clean nose, with a touch of sweet malt and a good dose of flowery hops. The mouth is very prickly and fairly heavy. The taste character is strongly of flowers, with a touch of pine and espresso. The malt is subdued, but noticeable, sweet on the front of the tongue while the hops bite at the back. The aftertaste is slightly dry and mildly bitter. The whole thing is quite smooth, more a British IPA than an American."
"Really, straight fours down the line. Nice pour and lacing, but nothing too remarkable. Taste is good and citrusy without being overly piney. Actually, the malt reall balances it out, but I think it's just a wee bit too much malt for my liking. Reminds me of other nice IPA's in this style, nicely balanced and as malty as they are hoppy. Quaffability is nice. The organic designation doesn't really affect quality, but it's nice to have such environmentally conscious brewers."
"Medium bodied and mellow maltiness usher in the first sips and mix with notes of caramel and light dried fruits. No real sign of hops but a subdued bitterness lurks in the back to remind us that this is an IPA. Finishes rather cleanly. Would definitely like to sample a fresh example, and when I do... will update this review."
"This is a good beer from Wolaver's, pouring medium gold with high head and excellent lacing on the inside of the glass. Bright hop aroma with citric flavors. The beer itself is quite light, in color and maltiness, to make way for a hop showcase that is neither flashy nor gaudy. Just a brisk, enjoyable crispness and a bit of grapefruity prickle. A solid beer, not very characterful, but definitely tasty. I would like perhaps a somewhat larger malt profile, but this is a minor quibble. I first had a Wolaver beer a few years ago and thought it was insipid, lacking flavor, perhaps due to the organic ingredients. This is happily not the case now. I don't know if they have improved their craft or if it was the switch to Otter Creek in Middlebury, VT, but this beer has as much substance as need be."
"This is a fairly mild IPA. I expected more from Otter Creek. It pours a dark golden color with a medium head and little lacing. There is more of the malt in the nose than the hops that I expected. It is a nice rounded pale ale but not what I was expecting from an American IPA. Where are the hops?"
"Pleasant floral smell. I enjoyed this thoroughly. Good white head on top. Taste is good bitter with light floweriness. Not much malt sweetness, but malt presence is noticeable. Much more of a Britishy IPA than an American IPA. This is a great session brew if you're into pale ale."
"An American IPA much more English in character pours a medium golden with an average head that left a little lace,aroma is leafy and lightly herbal with a dry biscuity malt hint.Taste is really subtle a little minty and herbal with the dry malt coming thru more as I drank more.Iam not a hop head but when drinking an American IPA would like more hop presence,not horrible by any mean just seems a little off."
"Pale golden amber body and a thin head. The bubbles rising up from the sides of the glass are pretty large, almost like soda bubbles. Dried apricots and grassy hops make up the bulk of the aroma. More apricots and grassy hops are found in the flavor wiht a bit of pepper."
"I wasn't too happy to see that this actually came from Otter Creek, good thing I only bought a single. While they brew high-quality beers, I tend to not enjoy their yeast choices."
"12 ounce bottle. Bottled on 12/23/03. Batch 1474."
"It pours a clear gold with a nice two-finger sized head. The aroma has some peach and citrus with some malt. It is not as hoppy as I expected for an IPA. The body is slightly malty with slight citrus and pine. It is hoppy and bitter, but nothing that wows me. A solid beer that I could drink a few of, but it is average and I would not go out of my way for it again."
"Conclusion: I should trust my instincts more often. The next time I stop by the states, this one is a lock in my grocery cart."
"Great stuff, a solid american IPA. I haven't had great experiences with organic beers, but Wolaver's makes a credible brew with this one. Tasty hops, which linger in the aftertaste for hours. Yum."
"I was really excited about trying this one for some reason. Maybe because it is made with all organic ingredients. Pours an orange coppery color with very little head. The lace is there for a while then slowly dissipates. The taste is surprising at first in that it sort of hits your pallette with something different. Bitter with an orange peel flavor. Very hoppy. This is a good beer and for me it was a different taste. I think over time and a few more bottles, I will find it to be better than average."
"Emerges from the bottle with a gently rocky white head, slowly settling out on clear and bright golden liquid. Nose is sweet malt and fresh hop flowers with a touch of grassiness. The taste is first sweet, then a growing bitterness asserts itself. Bitterness abounds without really dominating the palate, just flowery with a definate hop punch. Light fruity yeast esters noted at this point. Finshes bittersweet and somewhat clean, with an ultra slight alcohol tinge at the end yet superbly drinkable. More flavorsome than looks would lead you to believe."

"My second Wolavers beer. A 12 oz bottle that pours a deep rusty beige coloured brew with a small, fluffy, white head. The aromas are of grains, and light hops. The taste is malty, with some hops in the middle, and a dry, grainy finish. The mouthfeel is thin, because this brew is just too grainy. The drinkability is OK, but this is more of a decent pale ale, than an IPA. Plus the graininess is just a bit much for my taste buds."
"Hazy copper color with a nice foamy head that leaves a good lacing in the glass, citrus and piney hop aroma. Hoppy citrus flavors with a nice hop bite, medium body with a full yet rough mouthfeel, finishes with a clean and strong lasting bitterness, a decent IPA."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and dry. Medium bodied. The bitterness rides the tongue softly for several seconds. Extremely drinkable and solid IPA I will look for again."
"Poured a cloudy golden with a copper tinge without too much head to be seen. Smell was buttery and nutty with leafy floral hops and a dosage of caramel to round out with some sweetness. Taste was very crisp and hoppy with a good amount of pine flavors and a more butterscotch and nutty finish but not overly so. Mouthfeel was creamy as it warmed. Another good offering from the Wolaver line."
"The organic hops may be a little light in the shoes for an IPA, it's not a hopheads dream, but still a good session beer."
"Startlingly clear with very little head, there's a strong maltiness to the aroma, almost overpowering the hops--it is a kind of tart bubble-gum smell. I'm intrigued. The taste: completely unexpected; there is no sharpness at all, instead there is a muted bitterness balanced with a slight malty backbone--very much like a light Eastern IPA (closer to the English style but without the creamy thickness). A thin mouthfeel. This was a bit of a disappointment after such a promising start, I'm afraid."
"The light amber body supports a huge billowing head of off-white, creamy foam. The good retention guarantees superior lacing and even when it lessens the lace is outstanding. The nose is surprisingly more malty than hoppy, giving fine caramel notes. The flavor is lightly hopped along the English style and with very fine balance between the malt sweetness and hop bitterness. a very good dry finish with a very nice mouthfeel. Good session brew, for sure."
"This is a nice IPA - true to style and easy to drink. It doesn't wow you or leave you dissapointed at all, just a good drinking IPA. Pours a murky pale orange with minimal head. good fruity, citrusy nose and a decent, though somewhat thin mouthfeel. Decent dry tangy residual aftertatse, classic IPA aftertaste. Overall well balanced beer with decent drinkability. I like the organic ""angle"" and it is priced similar to the other craft IPAs. I think it would be better if bottle conditioned. Why the heck not support some organic farmers.. enjoy it!"
"Drinkability  I liked this one a little better than my fellow BAs. I thought it was well balanced, refreshing, and would make a terrific session beer."
"By the time I near the bottom of the pint I'm appreciating the mouthfeel more. First it hits me with a pleasingly creamy wave that's somewhere between woody and nutty. This gradually gives way to a tingly, bitter middle which in turn eases into a tart, crisp, dry, hoppy finish. As a bonus, it not only changes during each sip; its taste evolves during the course of a pint. As I drain this one I gradually taste less creaminess and more woodiness. I will be having more of these."
"Really nice rocky head and a nice burnt orange color. Nice nose of fresh zesty hops and buttery malt. Real nice hop character that is not over done, flovors of floral and leafy hop oil. Good malt balance and toasted buttery flavors. Great session IPA, and would love to taste this one on tap."
"Mouthfeel strikes a perfect level of carbonation and fullness and drinkability is excellent. Good for Wolaver's. If I could get this without driving to Missouri, it would definitely be a common presence in my fridge."
"Sure, I'd buy a sixer of this if given the chance...nice beer.."

"After a pretty hard pour an off white head formed and stood for the better part of a minute. The beer is dark straw in color and just a little bit hazy. Very little carbonation rising up to the top. The malt aroma is kind of funky. It's pretty sweet smelling, no hops, grape juice, it smells like artificial grape juice. That's just wrong. It has a born on date of 8/5/03 so I don't think it's too old. Holding my nose the taste continues with the malt trend, a little bit of caramel in there, and even less hops. The aftertaste lightly bitter, with just a touch of metal. There's definitely something wrong with this beer, but even so I don't see this being all that great."
"A very pleasant beer, this bottle won't be my last."
"Clear light copper appearance. Thin white head. Streams of CO2 bubbles surface gradually. Pretty good blend of resinous hop character and toffee based malt character. Very crisp in taste, this beer. Sharp pine resin and citric hop tones hit me first. Then the bitterness, which is quite noticeable and enjoyable. The malt foundation is toffee, toasted and biscuity. There's actually a slight lingering sweetness to the aftertaste if you look hard enough. Body is about medium and mouthfeel is carbonated nicely. Solid effort here."
"I am not a hoppy beer drinker, but I am willing to try any style of beer even if it's not a style that I like. This beer had a medium sized ivory head that mostly dissipated with fine-medium sized bubbles. The body was clear with fine carbonation and an orange-gold hue. The nose was malt and hops with a very bitter taste to it. The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth, dry textured and medium bodied. This IPA was just way too bitter tasting for me."
"Light brown color, small white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Malty, slightly sweet, caramelized. Full bodied, but its not very hoppy or bitter for an IPA. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and very crisp. Aftertaste is malty, wild a mild sharp bitterness."
"Not my favorite IPA. Would not have it again."
"An ultra dense and creamy head tops off this deeply golden and very clear brew. The aroma is one of a newly mown lawn and a flower garden. Bitter grapefruit spiciness comes through a soft and warm malt body. Nicely bittered from the first sip until the last. A fine and pleasant drinking IPA. This is one I would definitely have again. Too little time and too many good beers to try!"
"a nice drinkable IPA.. a nice one for those late summer nights."
"($1.49 / 12 oz bottle)"
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a bone white head that settles for nice lacing. The nose is of pale malts and bitter hops. There is a bit of a piney aroma surrounding it along with a hint of Carapils malts. The taste is really good. It is hops all the way. The beer is quite bitter and flavorful. There is a strong hop content in this one. Yeah Hah! The beer has a med mouthfeel and is a sessions beer no doubt. Wolavers (Otter Creek) make a few good brews. This one stands out among them."
"Under-rated as far as IPA's are concerned in my opinion. Pours a light amber color with a white head. Very well balanced. One of the more mild IPA's, but the hop aroma and taste is still dominant. This is one very drinkable IPA. Not sure what makes it organic though."
" Not as complex and malty as the draft version but still an above average IPA. German hops are a unique twist I dont particularly care for. I liked it much better on tap. More sweetness and balance along with fuller mouth feel and less carb bite."
"On draught at Lazy Chameleon in Powell, OH. Dark orange-amber color with a thin off-white head. Lacing is very light. Nice hoppy citrus aroma. I was pleased by the flavor. Medium-bodied with a nice mix of hops, citrus and light malt. Not as hoppy as most of the better IPAs out there but not a wasted attempt either. The finish is bitter although it fades throughout the glass. I'd get it on draught again."
"This pours a clear strawberry blonde tinged with orange. The head is pretty nice nd thick falling to leave a complex lacing down the glass. The nose is very noticeable on this one. More like a light fruity hop bouquet of flowers. The maltiness to the nose is very strong and fruity. The Flavor on this is a heavily contrasting and complex one on the palate. My first impression was What is going on, Then the hops come along and straighten you out. There is such a distinct contrast here between the sweet fruity malt and the extraordinarily bitter hops that leaves you with a pleasantly distinct beer. But sadly this is not a great beer."
"Poured a very lightly oranged pale amber color; very odd hue to it. Had a decent amount of carbonation and nice thin head, though it looked a little strange to me, like a clumpy sort of foam. Not much lace. Its scent was dry and earthy in a ""green"" way, as the hops smelt bairly floral, more herbal. The scent almost had a malty sense to it but was funked out by the hops. The taste was bitter as usual but with a hardy earthy tone. It developed a light fruit taste, though again funked out. Pretty zingy on the tongue, its long finish shortened as my palate adjusted to the high IBUs and particular funky bent of this whole beer. The drinkability was decent, but in general it was too raw tasting, and so needs better honing of many parts of it. Cool idea to go organic, though - purity in beer is a great thing!!"
"This beer poured a copper amber color and formed a nice foamy white head that left thick circular lace as it subsided. Some carbonation was present. An aroma of malt, hops and a touch of caramel. The flavor was of malt, hops and caramel. The finish was a touch bitter. Okay, first off when it comes to IPAs, I confess, I am a ""hop head"". This beer had none of the characteristics that one usually finds in American IPAs. That being said, this beer didn't seem to even carry many found is a tradional English style. I don't know if this was in it's attempt to be organic, but for me, it fails for this style."
"Pours perfectly clear pale amber with a nice white head. This is an untra filtered brew. Hops is the first taste out of the gate. A nice malt balance keeps that in check. Not a hop head's IPA, but certainly not without its charm. Actually one of my favorite Otter Creek brews. I'm excited to see a brewery actually start up an organic line. I try to stay as organic as possible, but it's just so hard these days. I hope to see a Wolaver's Stout someday."
"I think that there just wasn't any one characteristic that really jumped out at me...it was a bit bland. I think there is a place for IPAs that are not out to overwhelm you with their hop profile, but there really wasn't anything to recommend this beer as one you'd want to have again and again."
"There is a wonderful bitter hop flavor that dominates this brew. The malts are there, but they are hidden a bit until the grainy flavors come out just before the aftertaste. After the first few sips, I was not impressed with this brew, but after that it just got better. Citrus starts to come out of hiding adding to the crispness provided by the carbonation. The body is pretty light, but there is not a real lack of flavor. I was happy, to say the least with this brew. It is an interesting one that is certainly worth trying."
"Pours a slightly hazed golden/brown with a small white head that shrinks down to a lasting thin layer. Its smell consists of light hops and a burnt earthy grain. The taste mirrors the smell although the hops are more pronounced. It is light bodied and finishes with a dry hop bitterness. This beer is just a little bit too lightly hopped for an IPA, but still pretty tasty. It does however have a strange twang that I pick up in the after-taste albeit briefly. Aside from that, it is not a bad brew and it's organic. Cheers!"
"Pours a light to medium golden color with a tall creamy white head and has very good retention. The aroma is a grainy maltiness with notes of citrus and fresh baked bread. It has a bread-like malty sweetness with a mildly bitter hop finish. Based on its smoothness, youd never guess that its 6.5% alcohol (well, until you drank several that is!)."
"Cheers!"
"3.8"
"Comments: Flavorful considering its light color. the hops are spicy on the toungue but not overpowering. Hops, then beer, then hops. The way an IPA should be. Overall would be 3.5-4.0 of 5 in my humble opinion book. U.F."
"Clear amber in color, the head is beige, creamy, and moderate in stature, the lace is in dense sheets upon the glass. Nose is malt, lightly floral, hints of citrus. Front is inordinately sweet, light top, the finish is moderately acidic, modestly hopped, and a tad dry, more English IPA, than American, as with the Rogue Imperial IPA, nothing to be discomfited about."
"Pours a vast, towering cloudtop head that lasts to the bottom of the glass.  Lace is left in huge chunks on the glass walls.  Pleasant, slightly hazy golden orange color.  Aroma is of strong floral hops and citrus aromas.  Brief moment of maltiness in the taste is soon overwhelmed by bitter hops and citrus notes.  Lots of bitterness in the lingering aftertaste.  A good example of the style."
"This is good but not great IPA. It has a nice orangish amber color. The smell is great light fruity aromas. It has a light hoppiness with a more outstanding roasted malty flavor. The mouthfeel and drinkability are just average. This is a alright india pale ale and I'll probably come back to it occasionaly."
"Nice alcohol bite, balanced with a firm malt and defining hop character. Just a good, solid IPA in my book."
"The beer is a clear dark golden color with a small white head and a great lace.  The smell is a great floral/spicy hop bitterness.  The taste starts off with a nice hearty malt background and then the hops come and announce, very loudly, their presence.  Nice citrusy and slightly spicy bitterness that is well balanced by the established malt backbone.  There is a lingering tingly hop taste on the tongue for several minutes after drinking the beer.  The brew is slick and dry and very drinkable.  For my first few sips I wasn't crazy about the very abrupt change from malt to hop flavor in the taste, but with every sip I loved it more and more.  It definitely grew on me and I would suggest this to any hop heads.  As a not this one was brewed by Otter Creek in Vermont."
"Notes: Very rich and very tasty, and at 6.5% abv it warms the body a little."
"Very good everyday IPA. Fresh tasting and well balanced. Inexpensive too."
"Edited to knock numbers down more in line with my other reviews. This is good but not that memorable."
