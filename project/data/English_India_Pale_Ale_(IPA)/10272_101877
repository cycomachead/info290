3.51,2.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Pours crystal clear pale gold producing 2 fingers of frothy, white, shortlived head that leaves webby lacing. Aroma is citrus, honey, oaky vanilla & thin caramel, the hops are restrained for an IPA. Taste is sweet fronted but quickly gives way to balance with the wood & hops & then a bittersweet finish that becomes mostly a bitter-oaky aftertaste. Citrus & floral/herbal hops, boozy alcohol, vanilla, sugar & just a hint of butterscotch. Alcohol is prominent for a brew of this ABV. Mouthfeel is moderate-heavy bodied, low-medium carbonation, tongue coating thickness, oily. This puts me more in mind of an ESB instead of an IPA.","mothmanscott","Feb 26, 2015"

It has a clear bright golden to orange color, no haze at all.  The aroma was very hoppy and pleasant to me...though it has that strong green onion-grassy smell that some European beers have ( sorry...that is the only way I can think to describe it ) to it that some might call skunky...which surprised me.  I repeat i found it pleasant and pretty complex. You can also discover the woody notes. The mouthfeel was a little lighter than I expected.  The head was a bright white that started strong and dropped away after a minute or so to a thin lacing.  It was not as hoppy on the tongue as most IPA's.  I will buy again....","UKBeerman","Beers"

AROMA: medium-low hop aromas of floral and citrusy character. mild sweet malt background and some wood barrel. APPEARANCE: pale golden color and translucent. Thin white head with poor retention. TASTE: mild floral hop flavours with a very faint malty background. background shows a mild oak barrel flavour. medium-high bitterness that lingers into a almost dry aftertaste. PALATE: medium-light body with medium carbonation. OVERALL: a supposed barrel aged IPA that needs more assertive ""aged"" notes.","titvs","Nov 19, 2014"
3.08,-10.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Things have been slipping lately between I/G and myself, but we're gonna keep trying to make things work, continuing the process here.  This stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of dirty white foam.  The nose comprises mild balsa and very light grass.  The taste holds notes of flowers, vague young wood, and vague stonefruit.  The body is a light medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a dry finish.  Overall, this beer didn't do it for me.  Maybe it was the oak-aging, maybe it was a weak base to begin with; whatever the case, I/G just haven't been getting it done for a while now.  Shame, really.","TMoney2591","Nov 19, 2014"

Pours slightly hazy deep golden color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pine, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, toffee, toasted oak, light vanilla, and herbal/oak earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and oak notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, light pine, toffee, cracker, bread, vanilla, toasted oak, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/oak earthiness. Light herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, light pine, toffee, cracker, bread, toasted oak, vanilla, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and oak flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice and pleasant oak aged English IPA. All around good complexity and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and oak flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 25, 2014"

3.39,-1.2,3.75,3.5,3.25,3.75,3.25,"Overall I thought was nice beer, but I didn't think it was the best example of a oak aged IPA, the toasted oak showed up nicely and it ended up imparting some really nice flavors to this beer, but the IPA base was lacking and it ended up tasting more like a Regular Innis & Gunn beer with some orange peels thrown into the mix and I ended up missing those hoppy and bitter flavors. This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth, a little complex, a little creamy, fairly crisp, not too filling and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention and I think I could drink a couple, but after that I'm pretty sure the lack of hops would start to wear on me. What I like the most about this beer was the toasted oak aspect, I thought it was really nice and it worked well with this beer and the mouthfeel was also good. What I liked the least about this beer was the hop profile, the orange rind flavors tasted like they were actually from oranges and they didn't taste like they came from hops and I didn't really get any other hoppy flavors. I might buy this beer again and I wouldn't turn one down, but it isn't too hard to find a Oaked IPA that still has some hoppyness to it and I think it's worth a try, but I can't say it will be an instant favorite. All in all I was a little disappointed in this beer, I still liked it, but it didn't deliver the hop flavors and aromas that I was hoping for and that left me wanting more out of this beer. It isn't my favorite Oaked IPA or my favorite Innis & Gunn beer, but it isn't bad. I appreciate the effort, but this one could use just a little bit of work, better luck next time guys.","StoutHunter","Jul 11, 2014"

With this one, the hop bitterness is definitely the star, albeit in an old-world, English manner, which is a-ok. The toasted wood is understated to say the least, which is another plus.

3.82,11.4,3.75,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Innis and Gunn is a great brewery that I constantly come back to. This one is new to CT so I thought I would try it. I was happy to see that they are using colored bottles instead of clear glass which doesn't eliminate any sunlight. The appearance was a nice dark yellow with a lot of wood on the nose. The taste was a bit shocking to be honest. There was little to no hops in it and was mostly the toasty flavor of the oak. But the flavor was really good. On the end of the taste you get a bit of a floral bite that gives a nice finish. I loved it. Also I liked the moutfeel as well as it was medium thick which complemented the mellow flavor. I would highly recommend.","WhiteHillsStore","May 24, 2014"
3.02,-12,3.5,2.75,3,3.5,3,"Overall not very good, I could see IPA as it's more original U.K. style IPA like, but hops are quite bleh, not the kind I like at all, and the wood is a little tannic and not so tasty, and even the malts are like raw molasses and also not so tasty. Nothing really much about this beer I like. They always seem to have interesting ideas and concepts, but either just use the wrong ingredients, or fail to deliver on it.","jlindros","May 24, 2014"

2.04,-40.5,3,3.25,1.5,1.75,1.5,"Pale copper completely filtered sad looking IPA actually, fine speckled bright white head speckled even lacing. Aroma hints of oak barrel aging, a bit of booze, charred oak, and fruit character going on. Flavors are bland watery bitterness with the oak barrel notes giving me hints of dirty socks aged on hop water and oak chips, it's just a sad experience overall. On the plus side I was excited to see this beer in a brown bottle, but the flavor is terrible I literally can't finish it there are no redeeming qualities to give the beer credit for a watery cluster of muddled hops and oak chips and faint booziness. Mouthfeel is thin higher than normal carbonation, the hops here may ruin someone who could potentially become a hophead. Overall, I'm pretty much done getting burnt by Innis & Gunn, pretty much mediocre to terrible across the board.","WVbeergeek","0"

3.27,-4.7,3.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.25,"Hmmmm - not much of an IPA. Looks OK, while the aroma and flavour are dominated by oak and harsh leaves. Aside from a degree of bitterness the hops are well hidden. Unimpressive body. Doesn't live up to its promises - there's too much oak and not enough hops. An interesting idea but poorly executed; no need to seek this one out.","jazzyjeff13","Mar 04, 2014"
