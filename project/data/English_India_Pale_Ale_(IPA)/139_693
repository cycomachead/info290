3.38,4,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,3.25,"Served from the bottle and poured into a standard shaker glass. The beer pours with a good 1-2cm of bubbly head that dissipates rather quickly and leaves very minimal lacing on the glass. The color is a pale amber color that reminds me of some cheap sun-bleached orange fabric. The light penetration is pretty good with some mild chill haze that clears as the beer warms a little bit. The nose comes right out and introduces itself as a big glass of fuggles. It really is like opening a package of fuggles hop pellets. It is very earthy and very vegatal like a freshly dug carrot or radish. It wasn't an unpleasant smell at all. There was also some mild sweet caramel to the background as well, but the fuggles were all over it. The tast was again very earthy and vegetal, but more like zucchini bread than the aforementioned carrots and radishes. The bitterness was smooth and easy. Mouthfeel was super-dry and fairly bitter; maybe a little too far on the dry scale. As far as an IPA goes, this is very British given the excusive use of the Fuggles hops. I really enjoy the single hopped beer concept, and this IPA really does give you a full dose of fuggles so that I will always be able to find it in a beer. That said, the vegetal side of this hops really needs something with it to cool it off.","estlinska","Apr 16, 2013"

Smell is a light toasted malt with some citrus with a small metallic note. Initial taste is a mildly bitter citrus, fairly thin. Generic IPA, nothing to write home about. Actually grabbed this one in Montreal, where they don't seem to know what IPA is, so it was a pleasant change of pace from the choices of Blonde/Red/Stout there.","Alexmc2","Apr 09, 2013"

There's a fair bit of butterscotch malt, as well. The flavor has good bitterness, but the hops are rather bland. There's a metallic tinge to the odd toffee/butterscotch malt.

The smell is of some lighter malt, very subtle herbal hops, buttery diacetyl, a little lacking in my opinion. The taste is definately a maltier IPA, as is more common in the English style, some herbal hops in the background - though I really had to reach to pull this out, some decent bittering, and some bubblegum/caramel sweetness, again from the diacetyl. This was medium/light bodied and a little overcarbed for me. This one did not do it for me, I know that it is an English IPA but I still had to work to hard to appreciate the hop profile, and maybe a tad too buttery for my taste.","GrittyMug345","Nov 10, 2009"

The draft pour was good and held a thin head but only long enough to catch a glance once the server set it down. The light amber/gold color was pleasing but did not seem dark enough to have a full bodied flavor profile. Body of the beer seemed to lack fullness and the hop profile was non-existent for an IPA. As I try more American IPA's from New England this seems to be common among the local brewers. Having such mild characteristics makes this an easy drinking beer with light body and only mild carbonation.

The way this IPA comes at your nose and palate is definitely different than many others, but I personally think the difference works here. Mouth-feel is light to medium bodied. It's not overly carbonated, but there's just enough there to keep a bit of crispness around. It goes down pretty smooth, with a very slight, almost indiscernible alcohol heat at the very back. If you're looking for a hop bomb, this isn't it.

Other than that it's a pretty disappointing IPA. There is almost no malt character to this beer, and because of it the body is lacking as well. Without an appropriate grain bill the hops will mostly contribute a considerable amount of bitterness creating a bitter bomb, and this at least approaching a bitter bomb. The hop flavor is there, but it is greatly reduced. A better grain bill would have brought the flavor and aroma out even better. I suppose my point is that this is a poorly designed beer.

Gentle hop bitterness and hard water overtones appear in the finish. Mouthfeel is as expected; clean, with moderate chewiness and good balancing carbonation. A session-able traditional style pale ale. Doesn't begin to approach the greatness of the best examples.","dgallina","Aug 27, 2008"

The beer is a pretty clear orangish yellow, some head, some retention, no lacing. The smell is a bit metallic, some tartness, but really nothing overly substantial or unique for aromas. There is a moderate amount of carbonation and this is a light bodied beer a bit on the watery end of the spectrum. The taste is quite bland. There is a tartness, as mentioned, but it is not particularly dry and enjoyable, definitely not hoppy and crisp, so where does that leave this beer? I'm afraid that it is just a mediocre, not very interesting, somewhat refreshing, poor imitation IPA that one would do better looking elsewhere for a more representative example of the style. As the beer settles in, there is an ever so slight tinge of malty fruits emerging, but nothing worth holding out for.

Good carbonation visible. Aromas of buttery caramel from the ringwood yeast and the malt. Subtle floral hop aroma. Tastes similar to many Shipyard/ringwood brews with a sticky, buttery, caramel malt base, but with plenty of bittering hops to tame it. Floral hops come through with every sip. Wonderful ale fruitiness(juicy fruit) from the start to the middle with a bittersweet finish. Mellow hop bite even by English IPA standards but flavorful none-the-less. Plenty going on to keep it interesting. Light to medium mouthfeel goes well with the smooth carbonation. An underated brew because it's compared to American style IPA hop bombs.

The mouthfeel is incessantly carbonated at first; it reminds me of drinking cola with a mouthfull of sweet tarts.

3.36,3.4,4,3,3,4,4,"Medium amber with a never-ending vortex of carbonation rising from the center of the glass, this shipyard product has the distinctive nose of Fuggles, as this is the only variety of hops used to brew this beer. With this being the case, dont expect to be blown away with the typical over-thetop assault by hops that you experience with most IPAs, especially those that are brewed with a wide variety of hops. You will have a beer with a finely tuned and well-defined hop essence that only this variety could emanate; sorta like you would experience with a single malt scotch rather than a blend of scotch. Warm nose of marshmallow, moss and fresh hay; bready and slightly yeasty. A well-mannered and understated IPA with a nicely delineated level of bitterness that makes for effortless quaffing with none of the associated turbulence that one might have from consecutive consumption of more well endowed IPAs. A winner due to its distinctive and non-conformist flavor profile. This beer is a stray from the fray of overweight and overabundant IPAs on the market today.

Smell was an array of hops with citric/floral and spicy aromas represented, the classic advantage of the Fuggle being a bittering and aroma hop, Slight malt aroma. Taste was as smell advertised, I paricularly enjoyed the earthy Fuggles hop finish which lingered pleasingly. Good malt hop balance as evinced by English ales. I have been told most and or all of Shipyard ales are fermented with Ringwood yeast. If so it is not a distracting component here, contrary to the element it lends to Old Thumper. A great example of an English style IPA.","alehopman","Feb 27, 2007"

Poured two bottles into the only glass I brought with me on the move, a 28oz chalice. Apperance is really nice. Nice one finger head that slowly fades with slight lacing as the beer recedes. Color of a brand new penny. Nose is quite pithy with a bit of citrus towards the end. Taste follows the nose quite well. A dry hoppy flavor dominates with pine wood and needles. A slick hop oil adds to the flavor and is very well balanced with good carbonation in the mouthfeel. I am definitley going to fill up my glass again. I really like the beers that use single hop variety. You really realize what that hop does and notice it more when it is used with other hops.

I was curious how this straight Fuggles IPA would be. First taste on the palate was almost astringent but mellowed quickly and finished nice. A little of the malt was detected but this IPA was hop driven with the malt being hard to come through, and that was good.

The taste is about the same, with mild fuggles and citric hops, a mild to medium bitterness, buttery/caramel malts, alcohol, and hints of lemon.

There may be a tiny trace amount of hops hiding in the very back of the smell. This is the most peculiar IPA I have ever had. There is some hop bitterness in the taste, but it's woven around a handful of other things that I cannot readily identify. Almost has a medicine like taste to it in the middle. So far, this is a terrible example of the style, IMO. The mouthfeel seems a bit heavy for the style, and the carbonation level is totally not where it should be.

I don't get much out if it, and usually, I get tons of aroma out of an IPA. Flavor is adequate enough, bitter, slightly earthy. Decent.

Tastes lightly malty and flavored with hops. Has notes of cider, caramel, grass, and yeast. Goes a bit flat in the body and continues to water as metalic flavors increase into the finish.

Very interesting, unusual taste: fruity tartness and flowery bitter, all rolled into a musty sock. At first I thought it had gone bad, but the flavor profile grows on you as you sip down the glass. The finish is musty, with a touch of what seems like melon. Then the dry bitterness kicks in, not parched but dintinctive.

Very faint floral hops with a small amount of bitterness. Diacetyl enters at the finish making the beer finish on the sweet side.

This is a perfect example of a beer that is technically a microbrew but doesn't really have any qualities that make it that much more interesting than cheaper beers.

Mouthfeel was light to medium and rather dry. To be honest this tasted like a macro stab at an IPA. Not as citrusy as others. The appearence and smell of the brew were Fantastic, but the taste left a little to be desired. i will still give this one a good rating, i did enjoy drinking it, i just got my hopes up a little more than i should.

The spicy hops hit you first, then a bready malty finish follows. It's almost backwards in flavor profile. The taste isn't bad either, just different.

A vanilla cream feeling, like cream soda, sweeps over my tongue. The hops really kick in on the long finish. This beer is unlike anything else I've tried, and I like it. Sweet up front, bitter finish. Good creamy mouthfeel. Decent drinakbilty, but I think think the bitterness would be distracting as a session beer. I'm going to let this warm a bit while I go turn up the thermostat on the DBF.... Still impressively bitter on the finish. Not bad, but hurts the pure drinkability just a bit.

Well rounded, but a touch understated aromawise. Slightly burnt toffee like dark caramel malt derived sweetness initially in flavor is superceded by drying, tracely astringent hop bitterness. Stately butterscotch and underbaked biscuit egress mid palate along with an agreeable suggestion of peach marmalade, lending a homely contrast to the incipiently rough bitterness. Sufficiently dextrinous to facilitate an agreeably fluid, but slightly thin mouthfeel. Finishes with a suggestion of burnt toast and margarine. Shipyard IPA is a touch rough around the edges, but is an enjoyable brew nevertheless. The diacetyl presence actually serves to soften the slight astringency. A unique example.

The smell was interesting; it was hoppy for sure, but with a tart cranberry-like tint and an undertone of rope (hence: Shipyard?). Intrigued, I took a sip: it was far less assertive than I expected, and the ropiness was even more evident in the taste. I found the mouthfeel light and tantalizing, but the finish, frankly, was a tad dull--there was some overlay of maltiness, but I kept wishing for something to express itself boldly. Alas, no luck.

This is not one of my favorite beers. It lacks all the key ingredients of a good IPA; elevated alcohol, a strong hop flavor, a strong and destinctive hop aroma . IPA's are supposed to be for the beer snob.They are for people who like hops, not the mainstream Budweiser drinker. Be creative.

At 5.8% it is not exactly your traditional kick-ass IPA but solid enough. Also good for boning up on your beer flavors if you are interested in knowing what exactly Fuggles hops taste like (delicate and piney, in case you're wondering, without the sap/sugar that pine flavor implies) or Ringwood yeast for that matter (any Shipyard brew will do).

2.56,-21.2,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Starts with a good head and a lace that lasts.  Light coppery color, the hops are there and dominate, of course.  No noticable malty sweetness but the malts are there somewheres.  The ABV is 5.8%.","jdhilt","Nov 14, 2002"
3.08,-5.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Pours super foamy, but bubbles fan out quickly and dissipate quickly.  Deep honey-oak color.  Smell is a little tart.  Small sips accentuate meaty, pale malts, and solid, hard-water profiles, but larger gulps bring in hop and/or grain astringency and a huge burst of phenols, which give it a definte boozy appeal.  Bitterness lingers, as do "meaty-malts."  Flammable phenols will probably tip the scale as to having another, based on individual preferences.","DarthMalt","Nov 12, 2002"
4.2,29.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Nice clear golden color with a good sized head of snowy white foam, leaves lots of sticky lace. Aroma of hops with a tendency toward earthiness witha bit of grapefruit rind thrown in. Well balanced flavor with a good citrusy hop start and a nice bit of caramel/toffee sweetness in the malt. I keep reading about the slick feel and buttery flavor of Maine beers with Ringwood yeast and I think after tasting this again, I may have found what everyone is talking about. This is not your typical IPA, but it is one of my favorites, big on the hops but the malt makes enough of an appearance to balance it just enough.","MaineBeerMan","Nov 07, 2002"

3.85,18.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"It pours with a massive rocky white head over clear, light-golden liquid. Nose is lightly fruity, biscuity, then hoppy. Taste is initially big bitterness followed by the Ringwood yeast flavors & malty/fruity sweetness. The bitterness of this ale is upfront, yet not overpowering or "in your face" as some other IPA's can be. The finish is more hoppy than anything...nice and long. This is a great take on the IPA style.","beerluvr","Sep 22, 2002"
4.05,24.6,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This IPA is different because of the British Fuggles hops; not a Pacific Northwest Cascade hop dominated IPA, but something much more mellow and subtle.  The beer pours light copper with high carbonation and a tight white head.  The aroma is a blend of Fuggles hops and malt.  The taste is well-balanced dry, crisp, with fruit undertones.  The body does not have much mouthfeel, but overall this is a very drinkable ale, bordering on mass appeal.","brakspear","Sep 20, 2002"
3.93,20.9,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Creamy looking white lace and perfect clarity. Clean and crisp palate, nice uniform maltiness. Hops are clean and sharp with a woody earthy bite. Touch of buttery diacetyl towards the end which finishes mostly dry. Went very well with the catfish fingers.","Jason","Aug 31, 2002"
2.53,-22.2,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Copper body, with much carbonation. Slight haze. Just-a-little-off-white head featuring bubbles of all sizes. Some floral hops, but a rather subdued aroma for an IPA. First impression of taste is some citrus, but not the big grapefruit of some west coat style IPAs. Needs a stronger malt character. Hops should not dominate by default. Mouthfeel is a little too fizzy, between the carbonation and the hops. Again, needs more malt to smooth it out a little. Somewhat disappointing.","RonfromJersey","Aug 17, 2002"
4.35,33.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Bright and clear copper, nearly orange in color. I gave it a hard pour to produce a thick foamy 1/2 inch fluffy white head. Head stayed nicely and fell down the glass. Perfectly balanced hop nose and some balanced citrus undertones. Taste was noticibly hoppy as expected, but not bitter or spicy like some others, more restrained flavors, IMO. Nice malty midsection, but really lacked the big biscuit IPA feel. Medium to light bodied, really crisp dry finish. Easy to drink a few of these at a time.","StevieW","Jul 20, 2002"
4.8,47.7,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Pours a beautiful golden orange color with a nice creamy white head that slowly sinks to a film and leaves some lovely rings around the glass.  The smell is all fuggles as the names suggest, intense english hops with just a hint of sweet malt.  Beautiful creamy malt starts the brew off before it transitions into a nice mellow bitterness that the fuggles empart.  Extraordinarily creamy and smooth and yet very crisp as well.  This is one seriously drinkable brew.  It is just getting better and better as it warms too.  I have had two of my now favorite IPAs in the last couple of days.  Thanks to the Bierman for the bier.","Murph","Jul 11, 2002"
2.91,-10.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,3,"I don't think the Orlando stuff has consistancy.  This was a darker brew than most IPA's I have had.  It had a nice lasting head.  Average nose, fresh but the hops does not jump at ya.  Same upon tasting.. there is not a consistant hop bitterness or backbone to the brew.  Decent mouth and look, but for me this does not stand as a great IPA to me.. and I love the style...  Just your average IPA.","frank4sail","Jun 14, 2002"
3.63,11.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer's a clear dark golden.  Nice rocky white head.  Scents of pine and perfume seem to be present in small quantities on the nose.  Taste is very piney and citric.  Floral tones dance around in the mouth also.  This is a very hoppy beer, but not overly bitter, as I like my IPAs.  This is not too bad though.  Better than average.  There's some slight malt backing, but it doesn't seem to be quite enough.  I could knock off a few of these at a time if given the opportunity.","Bighuge","Jun 12, 2002"
3.48,7.1,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Nice amber copper color and with a sticky head, A good try at the IPA style.The hops was certainly present but not overpowering. If you have never had an IPA this beer is a good start.","Reverand","May 23, 2002"

I thought the mouthfeel was rather thin. Overall, not impressed with this brew. There are a lot of better IPA's available in my opinion.","LarryV","Feb 22, 2002"
