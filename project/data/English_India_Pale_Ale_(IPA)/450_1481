Taste is Bol and hoppy. A little sour but in a good way. Some grapefruit rind and maybe a little coriander. Dry after taste but very hoppy finish, almost too hoppy. The after taste is a bit too assertive. Medium mouthfeel, good carbonation. Solid beer, doesn't move the needle too much though.","MTLDOG","Feb 28, 2015"

3.77,0.3,3,3.5,3.75,4,4.25,"Pours hazy gold color with a small off white head that faded quickly and left good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, caramel, biscuit, lemon zest, floral hops, grains and some citrus fruit. Pretty basic nose, but very well balanced and better than normal for an English style IPA. Tastes like it smells, with malt, caramel, biscuit, lemon zest, floral hops, grains, orange peel, toffee, mild spices and some citrus fruit like orange juice or some citrus hops. It's sweet but the malt and hops taste is evenly divided for great balance and drinkability. Tasted much better than it smelled. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with average carbonation, a medium body that was a little chewy, and a malty aftertaste that was sweet with nice citrus accents. Overall this was a nice English style IPA that would make for a fine session beer.","CHickman","Jul 19, 2014"

Good foam head but the bubbles dissipated quickly. The lacing was thick with good retention on the glass. The bouqet was lacking for my taste with just a very faint smell of citrus but not enough to distinguish anything in particular. The flavor is very good with a good hop presence on the front and a malty almost biscuity lingering bitter tangerine finish on the back. The carbonation is a bit too much for me. It filled me up quickly. Overall a decent IPA but I couldn't n see myself drinking more than 2. Good summer IPA.","BeerHo","Jul 03, 2013"

The foam slowly reduced to a thick cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Pungent citrus hop aroma with orange, ripe pineapple and grapefruit. A light caramel and biscuit maltiness manages to show through as well. Medium-bodied with lazy, but rich, full carbonation. Pungent mix of ripe citrus and floral hop flavors right up front and through the middle. Hop flavors abruptly drop away leaving only bitterness through the middle to the end, although the citrusy aromas linger throughout. Finishes dry with a lightly sweet caramel maltiness and tapering hop bitterness. Lots of character and very drinkable.","IronLover","Apr 15, 2012"

The smell of the beer has a pretty nice balance between malts and hops on the nose. The taste of the beer had some good caramel flavors in it and a crisp hop bite also. The mouthfeel of the beer is easy going.

Not a whiff of alcohol, despite the high abv. Smell is very enticing. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Tastes is good, if somewhat simple.

Aroma of this beer is a pleasant mixture of citrus hops that lean slightly towards almost an orange-like fruit character and a bit of malt candy-like sweetness backing in the nose. Mixed in there is a bit of yeast character as well. Taste is pleasantly bitter with a good amount of hop flavors that again present themselves with a bit of bitter orange rind type of taste. Flavors also included are a bit of citrus and grass. Medium to light feel with a modest amount of carbonation. Fair amount of malt sweetness compliments the bitterness nicely.

Poured a translucent copper with a sudsy, half inch, off-white head that settles into a fairly consistent skim that coalesces around the edges. Thick strands of lacing were revealed during the session and exhibited excellent adherence. Nose reveals caramel/toffee and a biscuity quality with a detectable hops presence in the back - somewhere between piny and grapefruit. Taste consistent with nose; however, the hops comes out upfront on a malt backbone - a little bit of alcohol comes out in the mix as well. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an oily quality and a present background effervescence. Tasty brew. I've found the English IPAs I've tried to be hit or miss, but this one is really excellent.

Alcohol remains in the background. Mouthfeel is hefty due to ABV, but not overly so. Good carbonation level, but not quite crisp. Finish is bitter and dry. Drinkability is very good. Ahhh refreshing AND relaxing.","dude","Apr 05, 2009"

3.92,4.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured strong down the middle of a smallish tulip. Huge head that drained away quickly. Some lacing, but not much. Nice caramel color. Based on what others have said about this beer, I chose to let this sit a bit to force of some of the carbonation and to warm it to traditional British serving temps. The nose has a slight maltyness and a strong bitter hop scent. I'd guess lemon pledge, with a bit of pear at the end. The flavor is of toasty malts. A bit of biscuit with a medium hop finish. There are hints of esters and alcohol. This is not your traditional American IPA. Much more like a traditional British style. I am glad I let the carbonation wane as it is still a bit frothy. Another good beer from the folks at Yards.","Gilgemesh","Apr 01, 2009"

A hint of bubblegum as well. Taste is herbal/grassy hops with just a bit of malt sweetness behind it to balance it, as well as a slight tannic/grainy flavor. The bitterness lingers on the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium in carbonation, and the body is a tad on the light side. This beer is quite drinkable for one or two, but overall it comes across as a bit abrasive. A good take on British IPA, and if you don't mind some rough bitterness, you just might love this one.","Finn","Jan 20, 2009"

Stickiness is pretty damn good with a good amount of floaties in this one as well. Smell consists of musty dirt hops with a touch of fresh flowers. Crystal malts and faint citrus aromas tickle the nose as well. A good malty backbone up front on the tongue followed by sweet citrus. Bitter midway through to the finish with evergreen and a hefty amount of grains. Solid flavors from start to finish. Mouthfeel with this is much too harsh, leaves the tongue puckering. Body is medium with a steady carbonation. Not a bad brew overall, but the way it leaves the mouth takes away from the overall experience.

The smell is sweet with tropical fruit and orange aromas, some floral hop scents are noticable in the end. The taste starts off sweet then slowly turns bitter. You can almost feel it turn from sweet to bitter. Honey and tropical fruit flavors kick things off then are transformed into bitter citrus rind hops. The feel is light to moderate with fizzy carbonation and finishes bitter. Though it starts off sweet, it finishes quite clean with no slickness or stickiness. A muscular EIPA, seems a bit heavy on the malt and bitter hop. Not as carbonated as other Yard offering that I have sampled.","Gmann","May 01, 2008"

The taste is oddly sour with weak pine hops but some hefty grapefruit. There is again a sweet vinegar dominance, like a mash. The feel is very nice, a bit creamy but the sweet sour accent is a bit much for me. It mellows a little as you go. It is evenly carbonated and pretty easy drinking. This almost makes me think that it's a bad batch or maybe just spoiled a bit in this bottle. Not sure. If this is the real deal, then it's a litlle gnarly.","Durge","Apr 06, 2008"

3.57,-5.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Poured a hazy amber with a runaway head that was creamy white and fairly tight bubbles. It took a while for the head to settle in the glass so that I could drink it. Nice floral hop smell with some sweet malt as a base and a touch of vanilla. Maybe a little overcarbonated. The taste is a little strange at first. Up front is some slight sourness that almost has a hint of sour cherry, followed by an alcohol taste, followed by a long build of hop bitterness and finally an almost liquorice taste at the end of the hops. A little odd, but it grows on you. The mouthfeel has a slight amount of syrup to it but finishes quite dry, and the beer is not sweet at all. Given the abv of 8%, not bad. Its a little funky in its flavor and a little high in abv to drink much of this. Overall fairly interesting, but definitely a little different than most beers of this style. The fruitiness sometimes found in american ipas seems to be more of sour fruit flavor here.","Georgiabeer","Jul 08, 2006"
3.48,-7.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"The taste is initially sweet, but then starts to pick up some biting hop notes almost immediately. It finishes with a lightly herbal, lightly astringent, hoppy bitterness that lingers on for some time on the tongue. Perhaps the hop character is a bit grassy as well, but only just. Barring the initial sweetness, the malt character is actually quite dry. It leans towards the toasted grain side of the spectrum, with notes of biscuit malt, and perhaps even some notes of stale malt extract. Besides the bitterness, which seems spot on for an IPA, this beer seems to be missing quite a bit of hop character; choose either English hop character or American, but add something here to balance the bitterness and malt notes.","Gueuzedude","Jun 19, 2006"

There were plenty of hops on the nose, but you will have to forgive me since I (still) don't have the knowledge to be able to identify specific hop varieties. It had a medium mouthfeel and the hops were big in the mouth. The beer had a viscous, syrupy quality in the glass, but it did not translate to the mouthfeel.

The aroma is not very powerful, which surprises me, and its also a little "muddy", by which I mean its kind of hard to discern any real characteristics individually - everything kind of runs together. Its kind of herbal, thats' about the best I can do. The flavor is good, again a bit "muddy" but clean, featuring a prominent hop bitterness but not a lot of hop flavor or malty compliment.

The fragrant and minty characteristics are held in check on the tongue. Toasted malts form a very nice base. A little toffee and butter as well. The hops add a lot of character. In addition to the slight minty/perfumey tones, there's a nice flowery aspect. Some herbal accents as well. Just a very agreeable taste with me.","Bighuge","Feb 02, 2005"

Taste starts of with grapefruit bitterness but not a lot before a small amount of malt comes through. After taste was a bit dry and bitter, even at a whopping 8% alcohol for an IPA I could detect none in the nose or taste. Body is about medium with a clean fully carbonated feel to it.

However, the alcohol is quite evident in the taste; it is the first ingredient that I noticed balancing the hops. They say this has 70 IBU. That's clear. They also say (on the very British label) that the "agressive ale is fruity and balanced." Again, I'd agree. While individual aspects are distinguishable, nothing dominates. There's bitterness, and some fruit (more like cherry than anything). There's alcohol and even some underlying breadiness. The mouthfeel is prickly and medium thin.

Initially puckering because of the bitterness of the hops, but mellows a bit towards the maltier, sweet side, and finishes with the same dryness attributes by the hops.

The aroma is a sharp astringent nut sweetness with a discombobulated hop aroma that has me scratching my head, and there is also a meanstreak of metallic offness. Very unique IPA, not what I was expecting but it's not horrible or amazing, it lies somewhere in the middle of the road. The taste is full of bitterness, but it has a light almond astringency to it.

It's a beer that has a lot of potential but just doesn't seem to try very hard. If it were more full bodied, and had a more noticeable hop presence, it could be great.","HossMcGraw","Dec 13, 2002"
3.43,-8.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"This beer poured into the glass a apricot/burnt orange color. The head is a white/vanilla colored that seemed to start foamy and end as a skim. The lace surprised me and lasted quiet long. The aroma was fruit hops, and some yeast and bread malt. The taste started off slightly sweet then the yeast flavor came into the front. Then fruit dominated the rest with hops then ended a little dry and earthy. Some alcohol was present but very little. Not the best for this style, but I would give it another try at another time.","Jarod","Dec 09, 2002"
3.88,3.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy dark orange with a fluffy off white head that shrinks to a thin layer and leaves a lot of lace. Aroma was fruity hops with a nice bit of yeast and bread like malt smells too. Much more sweetness up front than expected, pears, plum and peach fruitiness with less truly bitter hop flavor than expected. Earthy hop bitterness on a drying finish that doesn't really last long. Good IPA, nicely drinkable without being over the top on hop bitterness as the trend seems to be for American IPAs. This tasted more like an English offering. I would drink more of this but only recomend it if someone was seeking a sweeter, less hopped IPA.","MaineBeerMan","Nov 19, 2002"
3.7,-1.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer started out as a nice, strong, flavorful IPA.  Big on the dried apricot aroma.  Thick mouthfeel to back up high english-style IBUs.  Alcohol is there.  But the beer's sryupy sweetness became too much towards the end.  Still tasty though.","pbrian","Oct 07, 2002"
3.77,0.3,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Rather coarse head, but nice, white, and fluffy. OK, the first one I had was definately bad. Fruit, hops, mango, still the same from the first time. The main difference was the taste. THis was so much better the second time around. It was bitter and hoppy, like an IPA should be, but not in the disgusting way it was the first time. I'm glad I gave this beer a second chance. I wouldn't call this trinkable in a tradiational sense, however it was appetizing in a hearty way. It had a lot of bitterness, along with toasted grains and a little malt. The dominating flavor, though, is certainly the hops. The only flaw was that I feel it was not as balanced, in maltiness, as an IPA should be.","yen157","Sep 27, 2002"
3.88,3.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Nice orange-copper color, but the fluffy white head dissipated almost immediately. The aroma is yeasty, earthy, mineral, fruity, light hop, some malt. The flavor is big fruit with a good mouthfeel, some maltiness, and an intense hoppy bitterness in the finish. Long lasting fruity/malt/bitterness but without being cloying. The alcohol is a bit too evident throughout but a good beer nevertheless.","NeroFiddled","Jul 23, 2002"
3.63,-3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Not a bad IPA, although I had hoped for more. The aroma is good, offering floral notes and some piney sort of resin to boot. However the flavor was, for whatever reason, a step or two behind. Very crisp and light on the palate. Still better than alot of brews out there. The head is nice and laces pretty well. Worth a try if you can get it. Prost!","goindownsouth","Jul 11, 2002"
4,6.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Quite  a good classic example of this style.  If lots of big yeast in your beer turns you off do not buy this product.  I can just imagine this is what they drank in tankerds on those saiboats to india in the 15th century.  If you want a good sturdy bottle conditioned IPA this is a good choice.  Watch out matey 8% ABV...","frank4sail","Jul 07, 2002"
3.87,2.9,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Notes: A really really good replica of the lost style, alcohol is quite noticeable from both warmth and ester. An IPA in the raw.","Jason","Mar 03, 2002"
4.07,8.2,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a copper-ish color, with a decent head. Tiny hints of fruitiness and citus in the aroma. Light but firm, crisp body. The same on the palate a mild citrus, fruits, alcohol noticed, herbal, earthy. Stays true to the original English style IPA. Really enjoyable!","WilliamPhilaPa","Feb 07, 2002"
