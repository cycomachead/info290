The nose comprises perfume-y flowers, light toffee, light menthol, and a hint of pine resin. The taste brings in more of the same, emphasizing the menthol and adding in some eucalyptus, making it seem as though I'm drinking some sort of Vicks Vap-O-Rub beer or something. (Note to Sam: DO NOT DO THIS!) The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a pretty weak IPA, English or otherwise, one that just plain doesn't taste all that good.","TMoney2591","Dec 14, 2012"

Having had lots of experience in IPAs and beer in general since then, my experience this time was not so great. I did a double-take when I noticed its low 5.2% abv on the menu. This is definitely an IPA meant for the first-time drinker. The IBUs and hop character are too low for my taste. It also tastes more like an American IPA than an English IPA. Overall, this is an average beer and a below average IPA.","JamesMN","Aug 13, 2012"

The head it produced was below average, as was the head retention. The aroma was very nice, it has lots of hop and citrus notes. The taste was not as pleasant as the nose. The hops did not shine through nearly as much as the aroma would suggest. There was some nice base malt that gave way to some earthy, almost grassy flavors.

3.58,8.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability- Not too bad I suppose for a English IPA. Not sure I've had a brew made with Apollo hops but I'm going to assume they are a lot like the fuggles also used. The cascades do nothing for the taste but whatever. Mildly enjoyable.","younger35","Apr 16, 2009"
1.8,-45.3,2.5,2.5,1.5,1.5,1.5,"A lightly copper,hazy Ipa that has no signs of carbonation & leaves a thin lace. Has very mild floral along with a moderate sweet hop aroma , malt aroma is a light grainyness. As for flavor the malt is very light not that much to notice. hops leave a heavy vegetation flavor as if they were freshly picked. Overall flavor of this beer you get mild sweet malt, then medium bitterness then a vegetable after taste. Mouthfeel: light in body, low carbonation & dryness in the end. Overall this beer could have been a lot better, wasn't awful but it could be balanced out a lot better. It is as if I were drinking a bitter grass beer.","simmons","Apr 08, 2009"
3.91,18.8,4,3,4,4.5,4.5,"Appearance is good, darker amber than expected but nice billowing head and lacing. Smell is pretty weak for the style. Almost smells like the hop characters are a mix of English and American. Taste is better, could have use a bit more hops but acceptable. Nice sweet aftertaste to balance it out. Mouthfeel and drinkability are fantastic for this style, right on par, nice work GCFB.","supercolter","Feb 26, 2009"

3.8,15.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Stopped in for a quick beer en route from the airport. This IPA was a clear golden color brew poured cold into a big pint glass at the Kansas City Brew Pub. It had a fair white head and polite lacing. The aroma was a certain high pitched citrus hop and not much else, though that's not necessarily a bad thing. And indeed, the first taste confirmed that this is pretty much about cat piss hops and it wasn't too bad. It's a bit thin in feel but it's just fine for a hop fix, very drinkable as long as you like your hops by the bucket. I enjoyed it, not everyone will, but the heck with them!","Durge","Jul 31, 2008"

There is virtually no smell. The taste has many of the right elements. There is a piney and grqpefruity hop flavor. There is minimal malt flavor to back it up. Yet, somehow the flavors seem dilute, as if the beer was watered down. The alcohol content is respectable(slightly more than 5%)The flavors are there, but the mouthfeel is thin.

3.22,-2.1,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"This beer pours a deep copper color with a 1" off-white head with some real staying time. EKG and Fuggles hops come through in the nose rather prominently... more than one might expect for an English IPA, but not really on the level with your average American IPA. Citrus and floral notes come through as well as a bit of sweet, caramel. More mildly sweet malt come through in the flavor as well as the caramel and a touch of biscuit. There's a bit of citrus and floral hops in the flavor as well as a grassiness that I'm not crazy about. Mouthfeel? Medium body... a bit less than what I'd expect in an IPA. Very drinkable, though it goes down more like a pale ale than an IPA. Regardless this is a decent beer. Not very adventurous or overly exciting, but not bad either.","bucko","Dec 07, 2006"
3.65,10.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall: The description in the Beer Menu had me looking for a Beer Engine. I actually mentioned to the woman serving that Duke of Wellington IPA on sale actually breached its cask conditioned description, maybe even legally, but I guess I laid off for fear of sounding nerdish. Anyways, this is darker than most and has a healthy malt base with a sharp tangy grapefruit and bitter pine finish. Far from a mainstream IPA, but this is pretty damned good and a very enjoyable detour from the usual IPAs about there. Probably not to everyones tastes but certainly fits in well with mine.","TheLongBeachBum","Jun 20, 2006"
3.42,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This came with a foamy, medium-tan head. It had a lightly cloudy, medium-amber color. The nose had a really good hop presence.

3,-8.8,3,3,3,3,3,"Remarks: The Granite City website lists this beer as a cask-conditioned offering. Im struggling with that notion, as it was pulled through a CO2 tap, and obviously force carbonated. Nothing about the taste, texture, or carbonation of this beer suggests cask conditioning. It was also served too cold, in a chilled glass, which seems to be SOP at Granite City.","grumpy","Oct 26, 2005"
3.64,10.6,3,4,3.5,4,3.5,"A nice, but not too impressive IPA. There's come good late and dry hopping here. Very strong english hops aroma and flavors, enoguh to make it an American IPA. Definately EKG and fuggles, but while the aroma and flavor is nice, the malt is too weak, leaving this beer without much of a body. Still not a bad beer, reminds me of a hoppy Redhook.","tempest","Aug 17, 2005"

3.86,17.3,2.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Coppery-bronze hue, it was served headless. Disappointing. Fairly aromatic nose, nicely hopped, undertones of citrusy merriment, plenty of caramel malt for support. The palate had decent bitterness, hints of caramel malt too; the finish is stronger, well-balanced even though the malt plays a secondary role. Dry. Slightly thin mouthfeel, not really a negative but a heartier body would have really propelled this IPA to the next level. This is a very respectable quaff; there is even a little tummy warming. Duke could have used a morsel more complexity but it works. Served too cold for my preference. Id drink it again.","bditty187","Aug 06, 2002"
3.68,11.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The Duke pours a simple copper color with little head or retention for that matter. Initial smell is of obvious hops and a bit grainy.
