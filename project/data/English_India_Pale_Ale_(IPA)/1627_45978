Smell is of malt, earth, floral, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and slight herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but has a better hop presence in the aroma in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 04, 2014"

3,-8.8,3,3,3,3,3,"Ok here is the deal with Eel River brews. The ONLY way to enjoy their beer is on tap. Several years ago I was the assistant brewer, and there are a lot of good things to say about the brewery in general. It is kept scrupulously clean, the ingredients are of extremely high quality, and the organic standards are militantly enforced. However the bottling line is pretty damn outdated and presents a lot of opportunities to create a stale, oxidized, almost undrinkable product. Try two bottles of the same beer from different bottling runs, I can just about guarantee they won't taste the same. Yes, this place makes beer toooo heavy on the malt flavor, and the IPA is wildly underhopped. The Acai Berry brew is an abomination that makes baby Jesus cry. But the Hef available only at the brewery and only seasonally is truly epic, and the imperial stout demands respect. The quality of the beers decreases rapidly with distance from the Eel River, and the smaller the bottle the worse the beer.","spongemonkey","Jul 10, 2011"

In the nose there's a thick presence of uncooked hops, wild field grasses and orange citrus, over time more territory acquired by cocoa, malt without any deep roasted qualities, a little cherry or fig fruit, persistent without trying to knock you over. Medium-bodied, above average foaminess during mouth entry, creates an initial impression of more heft. Dries out your mouth in a dulling manner, with each additional sip you feel you cannot register as many impressions as before. Still the pine resin, tea leaf, raw almonds and orange peel notes come through decently. At times minerally. Hard to get at that cocoa maltiness here, most there during aftertaste.

This is overshadowed by a lemony grassiness. Caramel darts about here and there. Mouth is nciely thick. I think this is a very nice IPA, one I would happily buy often.","TheBungyo","Jul 15, 2006"
2.52,-23.4,2.5,3,2.5,2.5,2,"Pours nice and clear, pale amber color with an ecru-colored, thick, rocky head. Smells cool and smooth, a little sweet and caramely, hops are prominent but not in my face. Tastes almost... roasty? Crisp malt profile is supported by a significant bitter backbone, but the hop taste is definitely less than overwhelming. I'm wondering if this is an old bottle, but it's not stamped with any bottling or expiration date. As I take several more sips, I realize that the most significant aspect of the hops is the grassy flavor -- but unfortunately it's not accompanied by the nice pine & citrus overtones that you usually get from dry hopping. Overall not especially good and I certainly wouldn't call it very drinkable.","PeatReek","May 21, 2006"
3.38,2.7,3,2.5,3.5,4,4,"It has a good full mouth-feel, and has adaquate hop bitterness. Great aftertaste. I think one of it's big claim/goal is it's certified organic wholeness. [and i'm ALL for that] A great session beer, and one to have on hand in the refrigerator.","ReDave","Apr 01, 2006"

3.65,10.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"has a nice hop finish with all the trimmings. Probably one of the stronger beers from them as the flavours where melded and prominent. worth a try if you can find this beer ( i got it from hawaii).","canucklehead","Mar 29, 2006"
3.95,20.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A middling to light body - surprising considering the high alcohol content (7%) and very drinkable at that. Nice session brew if a bit strong. Lightly, oily mouthfeel and a very enjoyable brew. I'll be seeking out other Eel River brews.","GimmeAles","Mar 24, 2006"
2.71,-17.6,4,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours a clear copper with a tight 1/2 finger white head,well really subdued aromas for an IPA the toasted grain aromas are stronger than any hop profile, caramel sweetness shows up as well only a very light herbalness shows up.A sharp,prickely mouthfeel really keeps the drinkability low not to mention the flavors are nothing to write home about.Caramelly sweet with more of leafy hop profile finishing rough and abrupt.No complexities to this beer just a rough edged lightly hopped IPA,man I have 5 more to drink I'll be giving these out to friends although that would be mean.","oberon","Mar 12, 2006"

2.8,-14.9,3,3,2.5,3,3,"Straw yellow color, a little bit hazy and with the slightest red tint. Sweet and floral nose, some bananas, pine and caramel. Pretty sweet for an IPA and the malts are rather light and one dimensional. Some hop dry finish, but the aftertaste is sour. A little but fuzzy and warm, palatable but not refreshing.","Bcant","Nov 19, 2005"
2.93,-10.9,3.5,3,3,3,2.5,"So what's up with this beer? The look is decent, hazy dark golden, with a nice looking creamy frothy head. Aroma is a non-descript hoppy, slightly sweet, brown-sugar malt, which is odd for an IPA.. Flavor is hoppy, but with an odd middle and aftertaste that I can't describe. Dark roasty malts are much more pronounced that I expect. Mouthfeel is moderate but I just can't get excited about drinking this beer. I can't say it's bad, but it just doesn't interest me.","Dukeofearl","Sep 28, 2005"

3.4,3.3,3,3,3.5,3,4," I guess i would say drink this if you are in the humboldt area otherwise skip it. When i drank this up thier it seemed right, but out of the area it doesn't seem to be that great. I don't know if that makes anysense. I'm kinda of getting tired of breweries slapping the words IPA on any old beer with extra malt and hops. This is really more of an amber.","pjwilson","Aug 12, 2005"
3.5,6.4,4.5,4.5,3,3.5,3,"Drinkability- Odd tasting brew that is interesting, but not really to the style of an american IPA.","GClarkage","Jun 08, 2005"
3.68,11.9,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Pours a lightly hazy ruby color, it is topped by a frothy four finger thick tan head. The aroma is lightly spritzy with notes of lemon, orange, and muted biscuit-like malt notes. The taste is sweet and malty with notes of caramel, which accentuates the fruity hop notes of orange and tangerine. This beer finishes with a fair bitterness, at least for an IPA, that dries my mouth out enough that you want to take another sip. The finish is lightly astringent as well. This beer is fairly light on the palate, and goes down quite smoothly. There is a bit of toasted malt that peeks through this hop dominated brew. This beer is pretty good, and the fact that it is organic is sort of cool.","Gueuzedude","Jun 06, 2005"
2.47,-24.9,4,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Overall drinkability: well, I'd drink it all if I bought a six pack, but thankfully, I didn't. I'm finishing the bottle, but mainly because I don't believe in wasting even somewhat decent beer. (Unlike BMC, which I'd wash my driveway with given sufficient quantity.) Ummm, a very ho-hum beer. Disappointing, too, since I think organic beers can be made to taste great. This was a half-hearted attempt at an IPA, first off, and also a lackluster offering in the organic market, which, sadly, isn't that broad to compete in.","warmstorage","May 22, 2005"
4.04,22.8,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4,"The beer departs the 12-ounce brown bottle a clear deep copper color with a mountainous creamy light tan head that lingers long on top the body with the residual lace a thick blanket to cover the glass. Nose has a sweet hop aroma, crisp and fresh, start is sweet with a good grain profile, top is middling in feel. Finish is prickly in its acidity and the hops dynamic in their spiciness, dry long lasting aftertaste, a fine drinking IPA, that satisfy your need for hops.","Gusler","May 06, 2005"
3.35,1.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Tap@Eel River. Pretty good for an organic beer. Lychee/pine bitterness, texture is a bit milky or something, which was a bit odd. (BTW, i am asuming this is the 'Certified organic' IPA that i'm reviewing this under). A pretty pleasant IPA, nothing fancy, just failr tasty/easy going.","rastaman","Feb 22, 2005"
3.74,13.7,3.5,4.5,3,4.5,4,"color shows up as a dark gold, reminds me of darkened apricots.. head is tight and thick and lasts... with traces hugging the glass and skirting the top.. the smell is very fruity, almost apricots (hmm, wonder if that is where the color came from) with a touch of bitterness and acidity. The first sip really filled the entire mouth with flavors that range from slightly bitter to fruity to end in musky. A decent feel of alcohol that doesnt interupt the taste.","schrist275","Nov 23, 2004"

3.03,-7.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Hazy, almost sandy look to the beer, which is amber in color. No head. No discernible hop aroma, and a slightly stale malt smell. The taste is similar. Quite sweet, but with somewhat dry, oxidized taste. Very slight bitterness that doesn't meet my expectations of an IPA. Tasted a bit like an over-aged bitter.","freed","Jul 23, 2003"
