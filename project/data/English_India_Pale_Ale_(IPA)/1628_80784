4.15,19.3,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"I'm pouring this into a plastic cup and it looks way too good for a plastic cup. Clear golden orange amber with a pure white head that has a good size and healthy retention. Beer stays covered all the way down. Nose suffers from the vessel but still has a delightful olfactory presence. Excellent malt presence and superb balance of caramel and grains. Hops are earthy and firm giving a mellower take on the American IPA signature while remaining quite hoppy. Taste is something that seems requires sophistication given the markedly different style British IPA are from American. The malt is lovely and multilayered with breads lightly toasted, light caramel sweetness, a mild English yeast fruitiness, covered by strong hops. Hops are earthy, (Fuggles I think) with a resiny oiliness that lingers cleanly. Some biscuit on the palate that makes me think Maris Otter malt as well. Feel is crisp  with an exceptionally drinkable weight. Carbonation is lively keeping it delightful on the tongue. This is a great beer that seems to be lost on a Neanderthal expectation of hops smakdown in a style that doesn't warrant it. It's hoppy while being decidedly reserved in the British tradition.","scootny","Jul 25, 2014"
2.78,-20.1,3.5,3,2.5,2.5,3,"Appearance/color good on pour (amber). Not much head. Smell is okay, but not really what I would consider typical of a good, craft IPA (ala Dogfish Head 60, Stone, BP Sculpin, or Lagunitas). Not really hoppy either. Would likely have a more mainstream appeal than to a hop-head or someone with a taste for a solid IPA. The closest comparison that I have would be Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale.","Guuggysdad","Jul 22, 2014"

Pours slightly cloudy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange zest, grapefruit, pear, floral, caramel, toast, bread, grass, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop and malt notes; with fairly weak strength. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, pear, apple, caramel, toast, brown bread, floral, pine, grass, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, caramel, brown bread, toast, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of hop and malt flavors with light yeast fruitiness; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good English IPA style. Nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 01, 2013"

3.11,-10.6,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops are present. Taste is bitter, some piney hops, a bit of malts, not a lot of flavor other than bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall I found this to be a mediocre beer.","tone77","Jun 30, 2012"

3.33,-4.3,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a clear copper color, with a small cap of white head. Aroma of bready malts, dull distant hops. Hmm...my fears of a malt-heavy IPA were confirmed on the taste. Toasty grains, nutshells, mild leafy and earthy hops. Fairly and smooth for the style, but not very flavorful or balanced. Solid overall but nothing tremendous. Aka, a British-style ale.","Rifugium","May 15, 2012"

3.36,-3.4,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"O: This is only OK by me. I've generally been pretty happy with Southampton's beers, but this one leaves me a little flat. I had a Middle Ages English IPA right before this one, and that one may have had an impact on how I viewed this one, as it was more American in style, and I liked it better.","Kendo","0"
