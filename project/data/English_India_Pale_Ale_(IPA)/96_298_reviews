"The body's on the light end of medium, with moderate carbonation giving it a good crispness and smoothness, but it ends slightly thin."

"This is my first encounter with Magic Hat aside from #9. This ale pours s handsome Hazy amber color with a thick and lasting slightly off white head. It leaves a slight amount of lacing and has nice legs to it. The aroma is quite weak but had notes of hop and citrus, mostly lemon. The flavor follows suit with some subtle malts underneath. It is a good tasting beer but nothing special. I hope that Magic Hat has more to offer than just this."

"Overall - Not bad, but certainly not was I was hoping for. I'm a little disappointed by this offering from Magic Hat. I've had a few of their sample packs before, and have been impressed by their style. This IPA is too strong with citrus hops, like a stronger version of #9, except more lemon and less grapefruit. Next time, I'll stick to their black IPA."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy orange amber with a nice fluffy white head. Smells of grain and slight floral hints. Tastes of ale yeast and citrus notes, very nice combination. Beer is carbonated a little heavily and is light bodied, could possibly be sessionable. Overall a very good beer."

"Overall, this is not a bad beer. When I want an IPA, though, I really want a spicy, exciting flavor profile that showcases hops. Hops should be obvious in both aroma and taste, and I think the Blind Faith misses the mark on that note."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a murky dark honey orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and fruity hop aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour citrus zest and malt flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with an unexpected sour flavor that is throwing me off of what would otherwise seem to be a decent example of the style."
""
"O: The smell and taste of this beer seem to be a bit muted for an IPA, even when compared to English IPAs. Nonetheless, it's quite easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not unpleasant, but not huge or complicated either. More middle of the pack for its class."
""
""
"A decent beer for the style. I kept trying to remember that it’s not an American IPA, but an English IPA. The basic #9 was the best of the four in this variety pack."

"I haven't had much luck with Magic Hat offering in the past, but this rotating IPA was a surprise winner. Right out of the bottle, it had a textbook IPA appearance and an inviting nose. The taste was very well balanced and yet distinctly an English IPA. Very well crafted. I would buy this again, especially since I was paying only around a buck a bottle with the variety pack it came in."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was very underwhelmed by this beer. It looks great, it drink great but the flavors and aroma just aren't there. almost more of a pale ale. I'd drink it again, or session it but there are so many better offerings out there. /73"
""
""
""
"This is an okay English IPA. The beer looked and smelled better than it tasted. Once again, Magic Hat doesn't totally impress."

"MF - Smooth and light bodied, dry finish, moderate carbonation."

"transfered to goblet from bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Tried again after T-giving. Same impression - cloudy, muddy look, muddy flavor profile, definitely more English in style, and farmy. But a good winter's ale. Not as bright as better IPAs."
"This beer has a semi- complex personality and, while not an amazing IPA by any means, is still a decent representation of the style. Many will find it too light and too basic to take seriously, but it’s really not a bad IPA and is worthy of a try if you get the chance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Seems a bit over carbonated to say the least and whether this is the reason or not the malts and or hops tastes are to light."

"I'm new to drinking IPA's, but this one is quite enjoyable. The appearance is a light orange/tan and holds a thin white head. This beer has a noticeably hoppy smell with a hint of citrus. The taste was surprisingly good to me. The initial taste is a bit citrus with a bite and the after taste is appropriately bitter from the hops. This IPA is not overly bitter like some of the others I have tasted. No complaints with the mouthfeel. Overall I'd give this beer a 3. As I mentioned, I'm new to IPA's and so far this is the first I've enjoyed. I would recommend this beer to a friend."
""
""
"Overall: I held out hope that this would be a more restrained IPA, without ""club you over the head"" hops. And perhaps it might have been, but it would be impossible to tell given the sourness problem. Can't recommend this."

"Magic Hat Blind Faith ---3/5."
""
"Overall - not the greatest IPA I've had, but does provide a more unique fruity experience, rather than a bitter overall complexion."
""
"Overall - Overall a disappointment. I remember it much more fondly than it actually is. I have also had some amazing brews since having one of these so it has a lot to live up to. Magic Hat is owned by North American Breweries who owns several brands who don't care about craft beer, such as Genesee and Labatt USA, but I figured since it was a subsidiary it might not brew sub-par. I was wrong and I am not a big fan of this brew or the brewery in general."

"Overall – Better than I had expected based on reviews. It's kind of like a fusion of English and American styles. I'd drink it again."

"My first English IPA. Pours and appears a dark orange, cloudy, low head tannic ale. Smells sweet really, and floral and some citrus, but not hop prominent like American IPA's. Taste is roasted malt and caramel and some citrus bitter, all modulated by a really busy, and creamy and effervescent mouth to the beer. Fun to try. Still, give me more hops!"
""
""
""
"There are so many fantastic IPA's out there that it is a hard category to compete in even with a top beer. Thus beer easily places well above other styles but as an IPA I'll have to place it only above average. Nice clean amber, with a tight froth and the welcome hop aftertaste. It only lacks an aromatic nostril sting I've come to expect with IPA's - especially double IPA's. But I don't think that was their brewing intention - NICE BEER!"
""
""
""
""

"Would i buy it next time. No, not because it ain't good. But there is a lot of excellent stuff available out there."

"O= This is a solid IPA. A little weird being the English style. A little bit of a step outside the box. Def worth trying though. Besides the sweet finish I liked it a lot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is chewy and has a little too much cardboard, with a medium body, mild carbonation and an overall grainy feel. Overall it was OK; nice for the style and flavorful enough that I’d have it again. They got this one right up in VT."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: This sort of tastes like an APA without any of the great hop flavor. I've never been a big fan of English IPAs (since the American version does a much better job with the hop selection) but this one is basically average for the style. I'd be interested to try the other Magic Hat IPAs but I wouldn't go for this again."
""
""
"o - Overall a decent IPA, though more on the malty side. A little hoppier in the taste, but not too much. Easy to drink, would have it again if it was in the fridge."
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a decent English IPA – that adjective in front of the “IPA” is an important one. Anyone who is expecting a hop presence similar to American IPAs doesn’t understand what English IPAs are and will be sorely disappointed. Sure, there’s a more subdued hop presence with more earthy and floral notes but that is to be expected with this style. There’s still not really anything special here, but it is not a bad beer at all."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- not a huge fan at all...but then again, Magic Hat. Not expecting much"
""
"Aroma has a hint of soap, like childhood bubbles. There is also a showing of pine form the hops. The flavor is pine resin and there is some faint citrus to be found. Not the best IPA I have had. For being a part of the Summer variety case, this was the weakest offering."
""
"With the proliferation of American styles, it's nice to be able to get an English style that's done well. This fits that bill. There are those mature refined tones that you expect; well rounded hop characteristics, but not pushing it to the levels that define American IPAs. This is a real nice easy drinker. If I could try this on cask, I'd be all over it."
""
""
""
"O: this is decent, but nothing spectacular, I'm not sure if I would have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very ordinary. Nothing to write home about. Just lacks character, like it doesn't know what kind of beer it wants to be. Goes down easy enough, but needs more bite for an IPA. The troops of lore wouldn't want much of this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all: A great beer to buy for the bottle if the spot next to #9 on the frat mantle is empty. Not worth money if you enjoy craft beer. And Anheuser Busch doesn't need it."
""
"O: Interesting twist on the style and definitely worth trying. It's not often I find an English IPA on the shelves. Good, but not something I will seek out."
""
""
"Another so-so beer from a brewery that puts out a lot of ho hum beers despite the fact they often use unusual ingredients and have wild and crazy labels."
""
""
"3.55/5.00"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an impressive effort from a brewery that I tend to hate. It's strong for an English IPA, but tastes pretty darn good. Magic Hat's best beer?"

"Overall, one of the better Magic Hat offerings I've had. Wouldn't consider it an English ipa. Hops were more American in style. Malt was a bit overly toasted, but the hop complexity was very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't really label this an IPA, more like a Pale Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is very much mediocre. It's not bad but it just doesn't have much interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - While this isn't a bad beer, it is far from an IPA, English or American. The malt character is subdued and too sweet for the style while the hops are almost completely absent until the finish where they contribute just a touch of flavor and bitterness. This would be a mediocre pale ale or a decent blonde, but it is a pretty poor IPA."
"(originally reviewed: 07-08-2011)"
""
""
"Overall: OK, I bought a six pack of Southern Tier ipa (STIPA) and STIPA won hands down. If you are an ipa fan you might not think this is enough. Well made and I have a lot of respect for Magic Hat. It just doesn't float my boat to use a cliche (sorry)."
""
"i like this one a lot in summer. not as aggressively hopped as a lot of other india pales, this one is very well balanced by some english and american malts. smell is quite zesty, some citrusty hops and earthy english malts. flavor is nice, plenty of hops in the finish, but the rest of the time they are quite subdued and only a little bit bitter. this is more of a session ipa than anything else. i like it in their summer mixed 12er, but i also like it from the brewery in a growler hand and half with number 9. they call it blind 9, and its an excellent blend. overall this ipa has a place in my annual beer calander, serves a special function in summer time."
"O- At first I thought this beer was a pretty good offering from Magic Hat (I usually think their beers are innovative and a little bit above average but nothing more), then I slowly started realizing the faults of this beer. There is a nice fruitiness to this beer, however it doesn't balance quite right and the more you drink it the more artificial and off it seems. This definitely has a taste similar to the #9 from what I remember, it has that same kind of apricot artificial taste (I think this one is a little bit better though). Overall not bad, but not great. Worth spending $12 and getting it in a mixed 12. This doesn't even compare to the other level of IPAs coming out of VT though."
""
""
"Edit: I've tried the most recent batch and refuse to believe it's the same beer. Whatever is in bottles now is not what I had then. This is the beer it should be."
"This has a flavor that seems to run through most of the Magic Hat beers. An herbal, earthy taste. It's a style, but I find I like those flowery hops better. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Trader Joe's in Washington, DC."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bitter herb and bitter orange, as the bitter hops roll around malt is faintly in the background, but does not show up enough for balance. The hops aren't good enough to carry this one on there own. This is a good beer but falls short of craft IPA expectations."
""
"Pours a dark burnt orange color with a rocky off white head that stayed solid. The smell is sticky caramel sweet with loads of citrusy hop aroma, with a hint of pepper. Taste is mainly piney hops with some peppery flavor as well, slightly sweet background and a little bread. It's light with a lot of carbonation and a hoppy dry finish. This is another of Magic Hat's better offerings, could've been a bit more balanced though."
"Dirty copper orange in color with a deep haze. Poured with a fluffy off-white foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap that left rings of sticky lacings on the glass. Citrus hop, ripe pineapple, biscuity malt, and grassy aromas. Medium bodied with a light resinous feel through the middle and assertive carbonation. Citrus hop flavor with a biscuity malt backbone from beginning to end. Finished semi-dry with a bready and light bitter pine aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty basic IPA, although it possessed a good drinkability it did not have any outstanding qualities..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent IPA. It definitely has some hop bite to it. The malt character is rather subdued so in the end the beer lacks balance. Just a little more malt would do wonders in taming the intense bitter finish. It's worth trying nonetheless. It's one of the better Magic Hat offerings."
""
""
"O: Not bad for an IPA. Bitterness isn't too potent and there are a few little flourishes that make it a nice change of pace."
"Overall like the other IPA on tour beers this one is very well crafted. Like the encore and HIPA better but this one is not bad."
"Overall this is a pretty nice and very pleasant IPA. I'm really enjoying the ""IPA on Tour"" by Magic Hat. Some good stuff! This is probably one of my favorites of the series thus far."
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange with one finger of cream colored foam, few spots left on the glass. Smell: orange peel, earth, caramel, biscuit. Not very pronounced. Taste: orange, herbal, toffee, some apple skin and earth in the finish. Medium body with creamy feel. So, basically, an American IPA with British Ale yeast... none of these hybrids really do it for me, but this one's not bad."
""
""
"Was orange-red in color with a slightly milky head. Does not seem to be highly carbonated. Slight pine and citrus smell, but not much at all. Tastes of grapefruit but slightly watery. Was a nice mouthfeel with decent amount of carbonation, but finished kind of watery. Overall though I did enjoy this one but would have enjoyed the hops a little stronger, I expected more bitterness than I got."

"Not a bad beer, but I'm not the fan of it now that I was last summer. Looking at Magic Hat's website, Blind Faith is the summer IPA on Tour, so looks like I'm a bit behind the curve on buying and drinking this one. Still a good beer, but I'll should pay attention a bit more when buying out of the way bottles at a liquor store that I don't know the reputation."
""
""
"This pours a light clear golden color with a white one finger head. Aroma is light fruits, some sugary citrus rind, and a little pine, with some pale malts. Flavor follows with light sweetness of citrus rinds and some honey, a bit of a flat flavor. Mouthfeel is rather light, with medium carbonation. Finish is more unpleasant than other in the style. Just not the hop profile I expect from an IPA. Plenty drinkable, especially when I was back in college."

"Starts mildly and never really takes off. Finishes better as flavors emerge, but it's unlike most IPAs I've had. Nothing makes it bad, but there's not really enough to make it great, either. A pleasant, if average beer."
""

"O- Overall a very average beer but certainly not offensive in any way."

"This is very crisp, even if tame. Refreshing. There's some rye flavor with a hop underpinning. It's well balanced. On the mouth it's bubbly and tingly. Very nice all around. An IPA mixed with a Rye. Nice."

"I was a bit surprised that I liked this. I would drink this beer any time and am glad I picked it up."
"Decent but a little dull. Certainly not a great example of what this style could be."
"Overall a pleasantly drinkable beer."
"O - Sorry for the short review, but there wasn't much to write home about...Magic Hat is always hit or miss for me and this IPA was a miss"
"I bought a mixed case of Magic Hat for $20. For that price, I figured whatever lame beer that was insided was atleast worth $20. This mixed case is worth $20 and not half a crown more. This beer was forgettable and not very good. Became kind of cloying at the end. Blech."
"I guess I just don't like IPA's. I bought this as a part of a varity pack. Wouldn't get it again."
"I was happy to see this beer come back, I hadn't tried it prior to it's retirement but when it was re-released I made sure to get some. Not sure if much changed because I have nothing to compare it to. Anyway, the beer poured out as a slightly hazy golden yellow color with a nice thick white head on top. The head is a little sticky and leave some lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is hoppy, there is a touch of malts in the background of the nose but mostly hoppy aromas dominate. The taste of the beer is quite nice, it's an easy going IPA, nothing too extreme here that'll kill your taste buds or anything. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and it's a bit refreshing also. Overall this is a pretty nice IPA. I enjoy it."
"O: Run of the mill ipa. Definitely not the best ipa I have tried nor the worst. Nothing really special or something I would grab again."
"Overall: This is a good beer. I think it fits the category perfectly, and is a good example of what to shoot for."
"A touch more malty than I was expecting, but that's true to style and not to my brain. Nutty but light in that department. Sweet, caramel/biscuit. Hops stir things up a bit, giving more zest and bite. This beer is good for conversation: you don't have to think about it until it's gone and you've talked for a long time while sipping. It happens"
"Overall, this is a good mid-level IPA, bearing many of the trademark flavors and aromas of the style, but lacking such finesse and creativity as would set it apart from its peers."
"Overall - Nothing special here. Too mild and weak, not enough complex flavors, and surely not enough hops. Malts are the one positive about this beer. Not worth drinking again."
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has amber color body with 2""finger white head that doesn't hang around long. The smell is a bit light on the hops and a little spice. The balance of hops and malt is nice, some spicy notes comes through. A decent mouth feel. Overall a decent beer, it is not my favorite of magic hat IPA tour, but good though."
"Overall: Not a good beer by any means. Wouldn't want to drink again thats for sure."
"Its a ""more drinkable"" IPA, by that I mean it has good balance, the hops are not through the roof, as such I actually find this quite a refreshing IPA."
"Nice coppery burnt orange with a decent whit head. Some lace to decorate the glass and quite a bit of carbonation evident. Smell is mild with light toffee and malt. Some buttery notes as well. A sweet fruitiness and some citrus. Taste is more of the nose with a bigger buttered toast/biscuit component. Malt gives a nice grain center to a bright and leafy hop finish. Dry with long notes of hop oil and grapefruit skin. As it warms the malt gets bigger and gives a broader platform for the well done hops to shine. Feel is a little light but the carbonation is spot on with a touch of creaminess. Overall quite drinkable and delightful. Sessions well and better than the sum of its parts."
"This is certainly not the most pungent IPA I’ve ever had. It would make a nice entry level beer for someone just staring out in the craft beer community (again, like the Sam Adams Latitude 48)."
"Overall a decent and very sessionable IPA, great for a summer night outside with a group. The smell leaves something to be desired for an IPA though."
"Pours a clear, pretty golden-orange. An off-white head laces well around the glass. Smell is super clean; high-tipped, mellow, leafy spices mixed with sugars. Taste has a fair amount of round caramel and butterscotch malts. Quite dry. Contained within is a more pronounced lite-grapefruit hop flavor. Finishes with more of the caramel. Only complaint is that the feel ""stops short."" Tasty and mildly complex.."
"Just another IPA but a good one."
"I have recently discovered Magic Hat through a friend and have been fairly pleased so far. The beer poured a medium-dark amber and left a 2 cm or so head, which disappeared quickly. The carbonation was nice and lacing was decent as well. The smell was very fresh and of course, the standard hoppy and citrus notes were present. The mouthfeel was light and crisp, and any movement of my tongue caused the beer to froth immediately. The taste had an initial sweetness, quickly moving to hoppy bitterness. I would put this in the mid-range for IPAs, it's a nice variation and very drinkable. Thanks."
"I purchased it as part of a multi-pack, but would buy a 6 of this."
"if handed this beer at a party i would happily drink it but wouldn't think twice about it. overall it's a notch above average, but no more."
"Easy drinking IPA. Tasty!"
"O: This is a nice example of an American take on the classic English IPA. Not hopped out of its mind or anything too crazy. Just a nice, easy-drinking IPA"
"The mouthfeel is middling with an appropriate level of carbonation. Overall, a nice easy drinking middle of the road IPA. Tasted pretty good on a cool night by the lake."
"I did not expect this. Wow, this was a very nice ipa. Poured a amber, little head, and not last. Smells of bitter hops, less citrusy than i thought it might be. Taste is of bitter hops, pine, resins. Has an tacky mouthfeel, my least favorite part of the beer. Overall, really nice ipa."
"D: This was a decent IPA, but nothing special. The scent and taste were enjoyable but not the cleanest or boldest. The body was a bit weak too. Surprisingly sweet, more than it was bitter, which is odd for an IPA. Hops seemed more American than English, but maybe that's just me. Easy beer to drink, but not recommended."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. A pretty average IPA, but drinks pretty cleanly at least."
" I would recommend this to my customers who want to explore the winding alpha-acid-road that is IPAs. Hell I'd recommend it to anyone."
"O: It's nice to see an IPA that doesn't blast your taste buds off with massive amounts of hops."
"Overall I don't think this one measures up to other magic hat beers that I have tried. It's decent, but that's about it."
"This is definitely the highlight of the Magic Hat 12 pack offering. As it warms the hops come out more and can really compete with some quality craft IPA's. It also tastes pretty unique because of the different yeast strain they use with the very leafy hop taste. I usually get very fruity and rich tasting IPA's but this is more crisp and herbal which is a nice break from the usual IPA. So pretty much if you want a bit milder but different tasting than the rest IPA go for this one."
"Poured out a deep burnt orange. A small amount of head is present but disappears quickly. A hefty amount of malts countered with some citrus floral hop notes. Flavor is hops right up front. A lot of citrus but some subtle fruitiness with some mango and melon. The hops are backed by a solid toffee malt backing. A small diacetyl taste but otherwise balanced well. Finishes with a hop bite but it doesn't cloy. The malt takes over for the finish making this a beer I could grab a bunch of at the bar."
"This is a pretty solid brew. Could use a bit more malt, other than that, this is good. Pours a hazy copper color...decent lacing and head retention. Pleasant scented and a nice hop nose. Very easy to drink, nothing offensive about this beer. Should be year round like it was, but still worth a shot."
"overall, an average beer, but seems uninspired."
"Not a bad IPA, but nothing to rave about. I will enjoy the rest of the 6-pack in a session at the pool."
"Pours a three finger off-white head that fades very slowly, leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Light-medium carbonation and light bodied. Grapefruit hop nose and flavor is same - grapefruit hops with hints of caramel, watery. Lingering bitter aftertaste. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. To be honest, this beer really surprised me. I wasn't expecting much at all as I haven't had a Magic Hat beer in a while, but I was surprisingly content with this offering. It is obvious in its English influences, and it's balanced to the point of almost being too malty. But the flavors are nice and the 6.20% alcohol is completely absent."
"Drinkability: A fairly sub-standard IPA. The flavor is a bit weak and it has that unfortunate, metallic taste that pops up every so often in some of Magic Hat's beers. Magic Hat is pretty hit or miss for me with a few great beers, a few duds, and a lot of mediocre ones. This one's a dud (if only barely). Skip it..."
"M - 3.5 the mouthfeel was nice could session if I had too"
"Pours with a generous head. Ample lacing. Looks the color of brewed tea. Not an overwhelming smell...some spice and bitter hops. Taste is bitter, hop heavy with not enough balancing malt. Not a lot of subtle notes in smell or taste. I'm not really picking up any of the nice citrus, floral, or grassy notes....just bitter. This one is just okay to me. I wouldn't seek it out, but I wouldn't refuse it either."
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Really solid appearance with a nice body and great head. Nose is not complex, but piny and malty. Flavor is bitter hops, sweet tone, and a dry, steely finish. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are nicely balanced and the hop profile is pretty solid. Very crisp and refreshing, especially with the bit of fruit flavor mixed in."
"SOLID, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"the more IPA's I try the more I like"
"CHEERS"
"Serving type: bottle"
"drinkability: very surprised at its quality characteristics, definitely above-average for Magic Hat, very good."
"O- i was surprised at how good this one was ..i was not expecting much..its a malt first ipa but has great bittering hops addition that works..it was tasty"
"Overall: meh. Nothing really stands out about this one and this beer is distinctly forgettable. Not as bad as some of the other Magic Hat beers but still a reminder why I never buy Magic Hat. I doubt I will get this one again. Cheers!"
"After having so many highly hopped American IPAs, it is good to try a more subtle interpretation. The ale is very quaffable for 6.0 ABV."
"but, coming from a die hard hop head. this beer just does not do the hop justice."
"Not a bad brew, easy to drink and one to just sit back and not think about too much, just enjoy."
"Taste-Upfront hopleaf bitterness,citrus peel, coarse, toasted malt, mineralness. Relativley clean finish. Seems to get more balnced as it warms. Grows on ya. Not bad."
"Overall, it's not a bad IPA, but I'd rather go with a few others."
"O - I like my IPA's with more of a fruit flavor, this seems to move the malt to the front. Still a good drinkable ale."
"Finish: Little bitter hops with some maltyness in the back"
"Hey, it's balanced. It works. I'd try it again."
"This beer pours a hazy orange-amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit, but is very faint. The taste is of grapefruit with a little orange, and some nice bitterness. There is some noticeable cardboard in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this beer seems stale to me. However, the date on the bottle reads June 30th 2011 so I'm not sure what to make of that. It is still decent, but I can't see myself drinking it again."
"The mouthfeel is rather on the weak side for bitterness, but appreciable for the low ABV in this beer. Overall, this is a great sipper for the warmer days we're starting to see here in the northeast."
"Enjoyable, if somewhat easy for an English IPA. It is almost like an EIPA with training wheels for beginners. Still, it is not offensive, and I would certainly have another."
"Overall, I wasn't really impressed with this one. Didn't taste much like any type of pale ale. Sorry magic hat, but this one wasn't very magical."
"Overall i would defiantly recommend this beer for someone new to the scene, it should open their eyes and taste buds for the spicy and hoppy beers."
"Pretty much a hollow shell of its former self, it is ok ... just ok. There are many other IPAs that have raised the benchmark a lot higher than this beer."
"Cheers!!!"
"This beer has a nice amber color with lighter red undertones good white head with good lacing the smell of aroma hops to this ipa. I would not expect anything less from and ipa especially from magic hat. The taste of this beer is not overly bitter like some ipas it is very well balanced. I really enjoyed the balnce of this beer. The beer was full bodied and overl this is a good beer to try and is a very good ipa"
"Pours clear dark orange in body with white bubbly head that leaves lacing. Aroma of spicy hops and lemon zest and vague apple skins. Tastes of spicy hops, slight veggies, some echo of citrus, bitterness comes through the finish leaving a lingering orange note in it's wake. Medium bodied with zapping carbonation. Drinkable but nothing special here."
"went great with brazilian black bean soup."
"What the hell is this? This year's batch tastes like watered-down malt liquor with some grass clippings thrown in. WHY."
"D - Fairly high on the drinkability scale as this was definatly a gulper. I could see myself throwing down quite a bit of these to be honest. Not bad at all but pretty average."
"drinkability: not much hop flavor, a mild IPA, decent break from a hop bomb"
"This is a very different IPA, as is usual with Magic Hat's style. It has a typical hoppy smell. It is quite bitter with the hops and not so well rounded with the malt, but still has a very good flavor. the bitterness makes it have a slightly worse drinkability than other IPA's i have had."
"Poured from bottle into your standard pint glass, has a nice burnt orange color and the look of an unfiltered wheat beer, light carbonation with minimal head and lacing. Smelled of fresh citrus hops and golden malts. First sip reminded me a lot of victory hop devil, great hop flavor with a bitter ending, good citrus/piney hop mix with minimal malt coming through. This is a very drinkable beer, could get a case and never be tired of blindly picking one of these out of the fridge. Leaves my mouth feeling quenched with a slight dryness on the tongue, recomend this to everyone to atleadt try once"
"I used to really like this beer back in 2004 / 2005...not so much these days. I know my palate has changed, but it really seems this beer has too."
"Drinkability is very god."
"It's not for everyone, but a very good back-to-the-basics EIPA, particularly as compared to its other bottled contemporaries."
"It's a shame this is a limited release, not to come back until whenever the hell Magic Hat feels like bringing it back. I'd session the hell out of this, but I only got my hands on three bottles that I've been clinging to ... this is my last one."
"D- I though this beer bee pretty good cuz it.s a IPA and man I was wrong. This beer sucks and I was hoping for sop much more."
"D - Good, but there's no balance to speak of."
"Dig it...so glad to find this beer!"
"D--Like I said, it's easy down. Drinking a bunch of these wouldn't be a problem for me. I really like this brew. That's surprising because I normally find the Magic Hat brews to be mediocre at best. Good job, guys."
"Picked this up in a sampler 6. Poured a hazy copper with thick white head. Great retention and lacing. Smell of citrusy hops and some mild bready malt. Taste the citrusy hops up front.. almost an off-metallic taste in there but it somehow works. Esters cling to the mouth. Malt comes to balance at the finish but is choked out by the hops. As far as middle of the road drinkable IPAs go, this is great."
"Not being a hop hound...I like this IPA as it is not over the top in bitterness."
"Slightly oily feel to the palate, but the carbonation help cut through that a little. I like how the bitter citric lingers in balance with the sweet caramel malt after each sip."
"Taste is pretty light, nothing overly hoppy, but pleasant. Light body, that balances fairly well with a fairly citrus and earthy flavor. This beer is drinkable, and but it doesnt really pair with anything and isnt aggressively good."
"Cheers!"
"Overall probably my favorite Magic Hat brew-"
"Pours yellow-amber with no head and a slight lace ring. Aroma is big - cascade hops that smell quite fresh and fruity, apples and pears that continue the fruit theme (though not as prevalent as the hops), and a light caramel malt to round out the body. Taste is dominated by apollo and cascade hops up front, and throughout the body - while the fruit flavors and malt come through a bit, they are overpowered by the hops and I wish they were a bit stronger as they contributed to a great aroma. Hoppy and smooth IPA mouthfeel, enough bite to be refreshing but nothing extraordinary. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer and a solid IPA."
"D: This is a well crafted brew, and one of my favorites from Magic Hat. The hops seem mask the ringwood flavor thats prominent in many of their beers. It's nice to see them release it again, but they should make this part of their year round line-up."
"D- Worst part of the beer, not awful, but not even great for the style. The aftertaste doesn't make me want to take another sip."
"An enjoyable brew from Magic Hat. Excellent balance of hops. Not too over powering but enough to let you know that your drinking an IPA."
"A dependable sort of beer."
"D- blind faith is arguably one of the best magic hat brews ever. This is so tasty and even easy to drink. I can slam a sixer without even knowing it"
"D- Makes a good session beer managed to to drink a few in one sitting."
"Overall this beer was solid, one of the better Magic Hat brews I've had. I'm not a huge fan of MH, but this beer was solid (not a superstar though) and one that I would drink anytime. I found this one the most enjoyable of the summer pack and would drink it anytime."
"Overall, one of the better Magic Hat brews I have ever had. I am gaining hope for them once again, assuming the other ""IPAs on Tour"" can hold up."
"Bocce Ball was in order and I had this fine beer as my partner"
"D - This is a nice English IPA. One of the better Magic Hat brews that I have had to date."
"I'm glad they brought this back for a short time. It's certainly better than Lucky Kat in some ways and worth trying while it's still on shelves."
"d- good, drinkable ipa here, could be sessioned, but falls a bit short of the mark on hop forward-ness, i would drink this again though."
"Cheers!"
"D-didn't like the taste. won't purchase again"
"D- Drinkable it is! I would like to get a sixer and see how it goes."
"Good drinkability. Light and refreshing. Overall, a decent beer and about what I expected out of Magic Hat."
"Pretty hazy pale-ale copper colored brew, small cream colored head sticks all over the glass. Scent is a very nice fruity hop oil scent along with some pale malt. Sweet malt front, lemon and citrus notes, biscuit. Some bitterness from the hops but it gets a bit lost in the other notes. Medium to full bodied. Interesting brew."
"It is a drinkable IPA, but the taste is not as clear ans sharp as other IPAs. Is not my first choice for an IPA at the beer store."
"Overall,"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is heavy of hops. Taste is also of hops with some malts, fairly well balanced. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"Nice amber color. Light tan head. Veey good esthery flavor. Really good beer."
"I like this one and have often contemplated making the knock-off"
"Its fairly well balanced but again..it's an IPA so hops are very prominent. I enjoyed this one!"
"A bit of citrus, but seriously, where are the hops? Is this one of those not west coast ipas from back in the day that use to rock the sox off the jersey boys or something? Seems commonplace and heavy on the malt and wood. It isn't a bad beer, just has big expectations, and it didn't meet them. Pricey for what it is."
"I just couldn't appreciate theis beer as much as I wanted. Maybe too unidimensional. It was OK, but didn't do much for me."
"Blind Faith poured a dark amber color, with medium sized head that stayed with the beer throughout. It had a little bit of a hoppy smell, with a bit of a strong alchool taste. It had a smooth taste, where the hop flavors, and alchool flavors balanced out. Not as hoppy as otheer IPA's which is a shame, but still a very good and different taste. It was rather easy to drink, and had a strong overall flavor. Overall a differnt take on an IPA, some may find this dissapointing, but overall a very nice beer."
"i really enjoyed this beer i am hoping that magic hat keeps this beer in there line up"
"This beer pours an orangey copper color with about a half finger of light head. It smells of citrus hops with a bit of caramel in the background. The taste is similar, but the malt character has a larger presence, balancing the hops very well. The beer is very smooth, but I would say a bit undercarbonated for my tastes."
"Drinkability- 4 out of 5. Not bad at all. It's rather strong on the hops, almost as if someone liquidated an entire hops farm for the purpose of producing this beer, so stay away if you aren't fond of hop-heavy beers; still, for the price, this is a great IPA that one could have a few of and be happy."
"D: wouldn't buy another, but would drink."
"Pours a copper caramel color that is slightly lighter on the bottom and a little darker on the top. The head is about two fingers and frothy and foamy. The head resides to a half finger and it leaves nice gobes of lacing all the way down with a ton of visible carbonation The aroma is of breadiness and earthy and citrus hops it also has a slight tea aroma to it. The taste has a slight tea and musty yeasty breadiness at the front end. It took me a while to get what the taste was at the front. The hop bite takes place in the middle to back end with floral and citrus hops. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated but very smooth. The drinkability is very high its not a hop bomb like some ipa's but more smooth and mellow. The taste is interesting. It is smooth enough and an easy enough drink to keep you drinking it."
"Notes: This is a decent all around IPA."
"Easy drinker, this I.P.A. is a great transition beer into the world of I.P.A's. I cant wait for hI.P.A. to return in the autumn of this year."
"Pours a nice amber / orange with moderate head and lacing. The beer has a good hop aroma with a light earthiness behind a slightly fruity hop aroma. A bit of malt plays behind that. The flavour has an enjoyable hoppiness to it with much of the same, but it is playing much more towards a pale ale as the bitterness is too light for my liking in an IPA. Nevertheless, an enjoyable and drinkable beer."
"I usually like IPAs so it was no surprise that I liked this on too. The color was a orangish tan & a bit cloudy. The smell was sweet hops. The taste started of a bit bitter the faded into some nice hops. but neither of those 2 flavors were too extreme but well balanced & a bit mild. A easy drink for a hot summers day."
"I am glad this is back even if limited."
"A great beer to start the day off with, a good rep of the English IPA"
"d - good EIPA."
"I'd say try it especially now that its back for a limited time, but Lucky Kat is much better."
"As long as you're not looking for a tongue-slashing IPA, you could do far worse than Blind Faith. I dig the balanced nature of this, and appreciate the fact that it doesn't remind of other Magic Hat beers (many of which are good but a bit samey). And it goes down WAY too quickly, so I guess drinkability has to be rated on the higher end of the scale."
"Drinkability- this beer would make a great session beer, its very easiliy drinkable not to heavy and not crazy complex but just easy smooth enjoyable drinking, a beer at a great prize too, relatively a very enjoyable ale, one you would drink as a great session with nice flavor and easy drinking, well balanced and worth another look again glad its back"
"Pours a hazy copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, piney hops and a gingerbread malt. In the taste, piney hops and a hint of grapefruit. A small bite, but mainly smooth, thin mouthfeel and a clean with a small hop aftertaste. Kind of thin, nice hops, but not much of a malt balance."
"This is one of the beers that helped get me acquainted with craft offerings, nice to see it back for a few seconds. Definitely in the upper quarter of middle-of-the-road IPA category."
"I was glad to see this back on the shelves if only for a limited time. Blind Faith was one of my gateway beers back in the day. Actually, Magic Hat's entire stable was pretty much my gateway. Upon this return visit, it definitely seems more tame, but that used to be the very reason I liked it. It was just about the only IPA I could drink before I got a taste for hops. We're all getting a little spoiled with some of the intensely flavored extreme beers and mini extremes out there, so it's good to return to a simpler, traditionally inspired brew. There is still a good amount of hops to go around in this one. The hop profile plays off the buttery aromas and sweet flavor notes well. Looks good and is very drinkable. A great one to have if you want some character without obliterating your palate."
"D: Mild body, a good easy drinking IPA. Nothing that has you rushing back"
"Pours a hazy orange amber color with a bubbly white head that dissipates quickly to a ring on the top. Smells of tart fruit, earthy floral hops, and a hint of caramel. Taste is caramel-ish toasted sweet malt with a bitter grapefruit/orange twang to it. Long lingering citrus fruit bitterness persists long after each sip. Light to medium body, resinous, watery mouthfeel, medium level of carbonation. I thought this one was just ok. While there was nothing objectionable about this brew there was also nothing noteworthy here either. Its certainly drinkable, but in the future I think I'd rather spend my money on something that wasn't so boring."
"D- a easy drink, relative mellow for an IPA, not to be sought after but a nice drink"
"DM: good carbonation and very drinkable. But not too strong as to overwhelm and ruin the palate."
"The taste is a tad biting, with lots of leafy and slightly harsh hops without the fruity and citrusy burst that I come to expect. There is a subdued citrus bite, but it lacks the complementary tang to make this a truly appealing hop bittering expereince. The dry bite, the slightly harsh herbal texture in the mouth, and the lack of some stronger bready malts in the mid section to pick up some slack, really bring out the flaws in this beer. I'm not a huge fan of this one, but it is okay."
"Had this beer for the first time when i went to the magic hat brewery . I am not a big fan of IPA's normally but this struck me as a great beer and opened me back up to the world of IPA's. First thought was that it was just because it was fresh from the brewery, but bought a mixed pack and it was still as good as it was from the tap. An after thought if you like both this beer and Number 9, do a 1/2 combination of the both of them, they do this at the brewery and they call it blind 9, its a great combination of flavor."
"Drinkability: It's got a good drinkability - it's not too sweet, not overly bitter, and not too booze-infused to dissuade me from downing a few of these guys."
"Off the tap at the brewery this English style IPA was a bright copper color with some tangerine highlights that appeared when held up to light. The head was slightly off-white, faded quickly and left thin ringlets of lacing. The aroma was a blend of citrus hops and herbal/grassy hops atop a crystal malt background. The flavors were at first very bitter with the orange rind and herbal hops elements shining through clearly. However, there was enough toasted malt and hints of caramel malt to give the beer a solid backbone and balance. Dry and just a little toasty; clearly English in style. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation good. As with all Magic Hat beers, I found this to be good but nothing stellar. However, this was one of the best I think they've produced in a while and I did enjoy it more than many of their more recent offerings. Props to South Burlington!"
"I was interested to try this beer a) because I have a nostalgic soft spot for Magic Hat having briefly attended UVM and b) because I am an adventurous hop-head with insatiable curiosity in new IPAs. Very simply, I thought the smell and appearance were decent, but uninspiring, and the taste was downright disappointing. The only saving grace was its drinkability."
"Cheers to Magic Hat for bringing back what may be the first IPA I ever tried. Blind Faith pours out a hazy, but glowing orange color, (lighter than I remember) with one finger of white heading. Sweet malt comes through in the nose, followed by faint hops and fresh grains. The hops are more pronounced in the taste, but still hold a milder flavor. I find myself wondering what types they are using, and if they are English. There is also some biscuit like malt flavor, and just a hint of fruit. Mouthfeel is very crisp, and easy on the palate. Finishing off this six pack should not be a problem. I am totally on board with MH with this IPA series."
"DB- Good priced IPA with a pretty good flavor. The bitters and hop flavors will become a bit much if sessioning is desired. Balance is lost even more with each sip toward the end of the glass."
"Magic Hat Blind Faith is a hazy, deep golden ale with a thin, dense, white head that leaves nice lacing on the glass. It has a floral, leafy aroma that's almost solventy. It smells like hop pellets. It's medium bodied and pretty soft. It has a pretty graceful finish, but it does leave the tongue a bit ragged after a while. It's quite bitter. It really reminds me of Ballard Bitter. It has that round, green bitterness that leans toward juniper. It's pretty well balanced with some peppery malt. Not too boring; Not too bad."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, bitter, and spicy."
"Overall: I'm thinking my bottles either got mislabeled or they brewed a batch where they forgot to do any hop additions. Tried it up against Harpoon IPA & Long Trail IPA and the clear lack of any hop presence in the Blind Faith was glaring. I would be fine with it if it was presented to me as maybe a scottish 60-"
"M/D - Full body but not really sticky, appropriate. Easy to drink, low ABV for what they call an IPA but that's not so bad. A surprisingly tasty brew from Magic Hat, who I generally stay away from."
"Good but better in memory."
"D: A pretty good English IPA and easy to have a few, as the 5.9% ABV is manageable for an evening. I could stand to have a little more balance and toastier English malt satisfaction, but its a good reprenstation of the style nonetheless. Would probably be good with some BBQ or Memphis dry-rub ribs."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a nice beige head that retains pretty good. The aroma has some minty and floral hops upfront, along with fruity esters, minerals, biscuit and caramel, and a little alcohol. The flavor has some fruit upfront (green apple and pear) along with some earthy and floral hops, esters, a little toffee sweetness, some biscuit and a wallop of alcohol. The mouthfeel is a little on the oily side, and drinkability is diminshed by the alcohol presence. A decent interpretation of an English IPA, but the alcohol is a bit strong (even for the style) and the complexity of the hop profile just isn't there."
"drinkability - i could relax after a long day at work and drink a few of these with no problem."
"Beer poured with decent amount of of white head. The body of the beer was hazy and slightly darker than expected. Smell was minimal slight hints of spicy hops and of malt. First quaff started and finished nicely bitter with malty flavors in the middle. The after taste hinted of spice and pine. The mouth feel was good but not great. I enjoyed Blind Faith, and was surprised by the complexity of this English style IPA."
"drinkability- a good drinkabilty i can picture myself sitting down and drinking a couple of these with no problem."
"Bitter finish"
"D: A solid IPA, one that might appeal to a large crowd. Still, not an IPA I would prefer over other, stronger, offerings."
"I must admit that as I was first discovering beer around my 21st birthday (and earlier), this quickly became a favorite of mine, a staple every time I went home to CT. I was pretty bummed out when they retired it considering how instrumental it was in starting this whole process. So, needless to say, mowing through this 6 pack will be pretty nostalgic for me."
"D - I treated this six pack like Larsonstyle treats a case of coors lights before a concert at the meadows. Very glad they brought this one back."
"D- one of the better offerings ive had from magic hat. something ill probably pick up more of if i can find it in a sixer like ive read others doing."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Glad to see it in 6 packs again instead of mixed 12 packs. Cant remember exactly the last time I had it, but I was hardly as into beer as I have been the past few years and it did not disappoint from my memories of it."
"D- I was very impressed by this beer. Magic Hat has a reputation for putting marketing before their beer... I'm now not sure that's the case. This beer is very tasty and one I will buy more of for sure. A very tasty NE IPA. Can't wait to see what the other rotating IPAs are like."
"The feel of this beer is pretty easy drinking. It has some kick but is only slight with a decent ABV that will makes this a bit strong but not too strong. A good beer."
"D- Each drink leaves you wanting more!"
"D) A nice IPA. I'd have another."
"Well, either my palate as greatly changed since this went off the market a couple years ago (which it def did) or this is not the same Blind Faith they brought us before. Maybe they're hoping we will believe them on blind faith (see what I did there), but I'm not buying it. Even the abv is different for this batch. Pretty bland I think. Plus it had almost no carbonation, what's with that... come on Magic Hat, what happened to you guys?!"
"D- i could drink a couple of these. im not usealy crazy about ipa's or i havent realy started to appreciate them. but blind faith is good start for me"
"Drinkability - A good, not great IPA, not a session brew, but I would easily drink more than one."
"Overall - A good American example of an English IPA up to the mouthfeel. Way too much carbonation for the style which makes the beer come off thin. I would likely, and probably will pick up another bottle of this in future."
"D: It's solid for a 12 pack offering, wouldn't go out of my way to get a six pack."
"Can't believe I have never tried this one before... this is a great New England IPA. Nice hop profile to this one, good bitterness to it, solid mouthfeel and body... I like it a lot better than Lucky Kat; wish they made this one available year round. Solid beer for sure, great drinkability... def. a good addition to the season 12 pack."
"it seems this beer just has an identity problem. it doesnt know if it wants to be an english ipa, a citrusy west coast ipa or a malty east coast ipa, and instead just hints at all of them without asserting its own identity."
"slight hop bitterness, but very drinkable and tame for an IPA. MUST be different than it was in 2002! a good balance for sure which is nice. but nothing stellar. thin mouthfeel doesn't help elevate this as it could've been. i'd be happy with plenty of this at a warm spring party, but nothing 'special'...i think this one needs some chocolate to bring out some nuances dancing about on my tongue."
"Drinkability - i'd have no problem having a few of these during a nice summer evening. It's a good beer for sure, nothing wrong with it, but nothing too great. Good all around beer."
"If a friend wanted to drink an IPA and wasn't used to them, this would be an excellent one to start with."
"I thought this was a decent brew, but nothing overly exceptional that would make me want this over others. The cactus fruit and honey suckle provided some oddball flavors for me here. But still did taste good."
"Feel/Drink: Great mouthfeel and drinkability is just right."
"Pretty drinkable. Magic Hat is many things, but not drinkable isn't one of them."
"D - Pleasant, not outstanding"
"D: Good balanced IPA. Good flavors and feel."
"9/28/2004. This is a nice all around beer. If not my favorite certainly one of my favorites from Magic Hat. Copper color topped with a medium white head that leaves a nice amount of lacing on the glass. Maintains a nice head throughout. A very smooth fruity, bitter hoppy flavor. The malts are there too which provide a nice backing and add balance to the beer. I liked it. Too bad it's now retired..."
"Taste is fairly herbal from the hops, little buttery but barely noticeable, decent citrus presence, nothing outstanding or noteworthy from this Magic Hat offering, certainly not my favorite from them."
"Pours a nice golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy off-white head, which leaves some nice small islands and sticky lacing. The nose is more on the malty side, but there is some hoppiness there as well, slight citrus and pine's, good dose of caramel. The taste is malty/hoppy, some citrus and pine's going on, and some caramel thrown in. The finish is slightly dry and bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice English IPA, glad to have had a chance to try out."
"Overall a very tatsy and well balanced IPA. Rumor has it that this beer will soon be made no more. That is too bad."
"Overall a solid IPA, that I could enjoy over and over again."
"I was dissapointed with Blind Faith this time around- it was lacking the strong hop character that I once remembered- nonetheless, I could still drink a bunch of these in a sitting, and that I did."
"Very boring pine hop profile. Caramel and some toffee with herbal notes. Thin in mouthfeel yett a modest finish. Not sure how much better if at all this would have been if served fresh."
"I miss this beer."
"I think this one may be bad and its not what its supposed to be.I may have to have this again when its a fresh bottle"
"poors an orange/ amber, with a frothy head that goes away pretty quick. Smells of sweet hops and citrus. The tatse is also mostly of citrusy hops, but in no way overpowering. Much more ballanced then th HiPA with a fair amout of malts. This is one of my favorite IPA's. Its not overpowering, and its well balanced, im sad to see it go."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass. Poured a clear golden amber color on top of which formed an off-white one finger head. Quickly faded into a thin ring of lace. Aromas of sweet malt, herbal and floral hops, minor citrus notes. Strong malty flavors followed by a strong kick of hops. Some piney flavors present. Was very smooth in the mouth. Mild carbonation. No noticeable alcohol. The severe maltiness throws this brew slightly out of balance. Pretty good though. Very drinkable."
"This is a mighty tasty ale plain and simple. Personally I would have classified this as an ESB but no matter it is just good."
"This is an alright brew. I usually am not big on drinking beer with food, but I don't think I would have this any other way. Nothing outstanding but it was worth trying. Definitely not as strong and full of character as others of the style."
"Served in a pint glass on draft. Appearance was very amber/coppery but clear, cream-colored head with some lacing. Aroma of citrusy American hops. Flavor was citrusy spicy hops in the beginning, a tangy flavor in the middle, and a dry bitterness in the end. Some caramelly/toasted maltiness also evident. The tangy flavor in the middle seemed inappropriate for the style and I hope it isn't the result of a dirty tap. Would be interested to know if anyone else detected this in this beer; if not I'd imagine it was an issue at the bar."
"this beer was just discontinued by Magic Hat after 12 years in the brew kettle. it's a unique beer that is easy to love and will be missed."
"It's a dry beer. Decent thickness, medium body. A little fizzy. Very drinkable. Has a sweetness that makes is a surprisingly nice summer beer."
"Blind faith pours a golden orange with a small head. Smell is a grainy maltiness, some faint buttery diacetyl. Flavor is better, nice citrusy hops, with an adequte bitterness and nice rounded malt flavor. This was one of the IPAs that got me into good beer, along with Harpoon IPA. I haven't had it in a long time (I would buy the mix packs much more often if it replaced Circus Boy). I should really pick up a six pack of this more often."
"D - I'm a pretty big fan of most Magic Hat beer, even though that seems fairly looked-down-upon in some circles; this is another solid beer that I could definitely drink all night"
"From the bottle, this poured with the as-expected visuals ... bronze/orange with a thin white head. Oddly enough, the hoppy aroma reminds me of my wifes hairdryer or a ladys hair salon (but no it didnt turn me off) ... but thankfully the flavors stray from that odd synapse in my brains smell factory. This has a solid, solid malt base with a light hoppy top-off, resonating citrus and pine. (#2681, 2/4/2007)"
"Drinkability - not exactly an IPA-light (or maybe I've been sampling too many DIPA of late). Regardless, I went through the other bottles rather quickly and had to hold onto this one until I could take some notes. A very sessionable IPA; a big shout out to beachbum for the trade. This beer kicked off the Great Christmas Wrapping Project '06, which went well. Sometimes you embark on such things with a bit of 'blind faith' that you'll be done before Santa's big night. We made it <aaahhh>..."
"Mouthfeel was light to medium, a little slick and quite pleasant. All added up to excellent drinkability. I will buy again, as that was the last of that sixer, and I want more...."
"D= very drinkable if you like some strong hops-bitters presence without pushing the edge."
"Pours a deep golden orange with a frothy white head. A very potent smell with a heavy hop bouquet with hints of citrus and some sweet notes. The taste is disappointing, not nearly as good as the smell. Starts hoppy and citrus and finishes sweet with very little bitter taste. This is a different brew, but I respect their venture. The mouthfeel is medium-light with a good carbonation. This is an easy drinker, a very inoffensive IPA (weak in flavor, but a good balance). I would suggest this for magic hat lovers or those who are afraid of IPAs. Enjoy."
"nice translucent medium amber color with a two finger head, nice sticky lacing. smell is fresh citrus and pine. citrus grapefruit up front with big piney hop finish. clean light dry hoppy after taste. great beer drank six just for the review definitely on the buy list."
"D: Tasty, easy-to-drink, not very filling, even though I prefer the American style IPA over the English style this beer is pretty good. It’s worth staying with for an evening especially if you like the style."
"This IPA poured a cloudy gold with some head and lacing- a sticky piney aroma was present, with some malted notes. The taste was not what I expect in an IPA- not much hop characteristic, very one dimensional in flavor and too sweet, the roasted caramel malt came on too strong on the back end. There was that signature macro-brew taste as well. Not too heavy, medium carbonation, fairly drinkable. Magic Hat needs another shot at brewing a quality IPA."
"D - I could drink these all day long. Perfect for an afternoon by the pool or thanksgiving dinner."
"Beer is a cloudy orange-honey color without much visable carbination. Creamy white head that condenses but never goes away. First smell of this beer is very dank and floral. For IPA lovers, this smell is pretty close to heaven. Beer has almost a sweet beginning which works well with the floral aroma. Citrus notes fill your palet. The hop bitterness comes through at end of the beer, rounding out the complete hop flavor from floral to bitter. Mouthfeel is quite smooth for an IPA with appropriate carbinaton. For an IPA from an American micro, this is actually pretty drinkable as it is well balanced and not over-hopped. Really a great IPA, TASTY!!"
"D - Much more enjoyable than HiPA in the sense that the flavors form a great balance with the hops...there's no pure-hop punch (not that lots of hops are a bad thing!). Definitely keep your eye out for this one."
"Nice orange color with a white head and lacing. Smells of nice hops and biscuit malt. Tastes of biscuit and caramel malt to start followed by strong hops. Hops flavors are of juicy grapefuit and spice with other flavors I cant quite describe. Just a good IPA here. Tasty, well-balanced, and very drinkable. Grab a sixer some time."
"It's a decent IPA. It could use more body and the malt is belated. Pretty good selection of hops, though. Not bad..."
"D - Easy to drink, but definately my cup of tea (or pint of beer)."
"D: Strongly lacking distinction and balance, probably nothing I would pick up again without a recipe change."
"D - It is easy to drink, but it doesn't taste that good really. It is a quaffable beer, but it lacks any meritous characteristics. Not terrible, but far from great."
"Cheers!"
"Taste is dominated by hops. I can't determine what hops, but they are certainly spicy and very hoppy,resinous and give the beer a blackberry, aromatic taste. Is this Brewer's Gold or Bullion? Mouthfeel is dry. Light caramel and bitter, do I taste liquorice? A wonderfull beer, which is surprisingly in balance."
"Final notes: I actually preferred this beer more as it warmed -- in my opinion, it became a little bit more like a traditional English IPA as the flavors melded together and sort of ""softened"" the hops. In some ways I think it feels closer to an American Pale Ale, particularly when it's cold. Like I said, I'd been a bit down on Magic Hat lately, but a thoughtful, deliberate drinking of the Blind Faith surprised me and reminded me why I liked this when it first came out years ago."
"A clear, copper brew whose head subsides to leave a trim, white ring around the glass, the Blind Faith doesn't look like much, but its aroma will give you a hint of what's to come. Sweet, crisp, hoppy, with the occasional whiff of a supermarket's produce section, I eagerly took a sip and discovered one of the most well-balanced IPAs I've ever encountered. A subtle aroma of mulched leaves highlights the Blind Faith. Lighter on the bittering hops, heavier on the finishing hops, this IPA is supremely drinkable -- even more so because of its fine carbonation. I drank mine without food to great results, but next time I think I'll have it with a meal."
"Amber/red body with almost no head other than a light tan film. Smells overwealmingly hoppy. Tastes bitter with some alcohol notes. Not sure what to think. I know IPAs are hoppy, but this ones not quite as well-balanced as I thought. Kind of hits you over the head with hop bitterness... Perfect for hop-heads maybe? While I like hops, Im not really one. Nonetheless a full-flavored, medium bodied, solid beer."
"Very drinkable. Easy to drink and flavorable. Very solid offering. I had some on draft in the past, and if I remember correctly, I was much more impressed with the draft, especially regarding smell."
"D - Pretty good. I expect more flavor after the smell but it still has a pretty good taste and goes down easy."
"D-very good"
"Drinkability? Very drinkable. Subtle, yet not underhanded, a kind of muted ale that chameleons itself to whatever you happen to be eating/doing. My deductions for taste are because I don't think this would be as good as it is in the summer, in the winter. But right now? Pass me another six."
"Pours a golden amber. Fluffy white head, with excellent retention and lacing. Aroma is subtle. Pine hops are most noticeable. Body is medium and carbonated. Taste is nicely hopped. Has a bit of a carmel apple thing in the finish. Did not knock my sox off, but worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"D: Despite having a strong preference for American style IPA's, I find this one quite enjoyable. This one has the subtleties of an English, but with just abit more hops than most. I would be very happy drinking this all night long."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. The hops really hung around in the mouth. The beer has a dry finish. The beer was very easy to drink. This is a highly drinkable and sessionable IPA."
"A nice IPA for the summer, light boodied but still flavorable."
"Drinkability: I like this a lot better than their APA, not that it means a whole lot. I guess one factor that keeps it drinkable is that you want to keep *drinking* so you don't experience the funky aftertaste."
"A good beer, but I was hoping to taste more maltyness for greater balance."
"Overall: This is my favorite offering from Magic Hat. An excellent sessionable IPA."
"Overall, a decent english ipa. tasty in it's own right, but i just prefer american."
"Sort of reminds me of Harpoon's IPA."
"well balanced, a little thin, but definitely a session IPA that I would enjoy more of. yumm"
"Drinkability took a bit of a hit here as I just don't like that buttery taste in my beer. All in all, Blind Faith is a solid representation of the style. It won't sear your tastebuds like most American (and West Coast, in particular) IPA's do so it's got better potential as a session brew. Just be ready for some diacetyl."
"A standard IPA copper color, nice looking head. A relatively low powered IPA, pretty weak hop presence. Smell did have light hop and grain smell that wasn't all bad. Taste was muted and hops were fairly weak, really needed an extra shot of hops to round it out. Dry and citric and still enjoyable, but far fro my favorite IPA."
"Approaches balanced for an IPA, and seems to me more of a ""pale ale on acid," as an IPA should be. Most IPA's are absolutely too mild in malt and/or too much in the hops for me, while most pale ales are often too booring all around, so I rarely crave them, but I like this. Makes me wonder if there are other IPA's that could satisfy equally and do this even better. Not exactly a spiritual experience as MH might suggest, but surprisingly solid."
"what a pleasant brew, will pick up a 6pack of this stuff at some point. well done Magic Hat."
"Crisp and pretty refreshing. An interesting brew, and it serves as a tasty opener to my journey into the New England beer scene."
"The crisp & clean hoppy taste really sets this one apart for me. Carbonation keeps it lively on the tongue, and it has a great drinkability. I would recommend this to any hop fans out there."
"Definitely not one of my favourite IPAs (and I do love IPAs), but honestly one of my first English (rather than American) versions of the style, so perhaps this is something to get accustomed to."
"D- High drinkability. Not too bitter for a session beer. this would be my choice for heading to a party. can enjoy it and drink a bunch of them. not bad overall"
"Tasted: 11/28/05"
"Mouth feel is thin with slight carbonation."
"This is a mild IPA - one that might be a good entry IPA if you are into yeasty beers. Its good, not great. I would drink it again. Would probably pair excellently with a good deli sandwich."
"This brew poured a copper with a minimal head that disappeared quickly. Nose is of floral hops. Taste is pretty much a blast of hops that fits the English IPA style. The mouthfeel is a little thin but nicely carbonated. Overall drinkability is good as this was easy to enjoy three in one session."
"Crystal clear copper colored ale. 1/2 inch white head with a heavy pour that disipates quickly but the heavy film that is left leaves nice lacing. Medium to light level of carbonation bubbles. Smell is a nice level of flowery hops. Taste is the same with the hops being the primary focus but not overpowering. Can't really distinguish any particular malt, but it must be there to provde some balance. Nice smooth mouthfeel with a medium body. Drinkability is good. Of the 4 in the Magic Hat variety pack (blind faith, batch 371, jinx and #9) this is my favorite."
"This is a good IPA but again, not really a sipping, session type beer. I could certainly recommend one on a hot summer's day but I wouldn't need a sixer of it unless I had a few friends coming over. Still, an excellent example of the style."
"This beer poured a dull brown color, which was hazy and murky. A nice thick rocky white head formed after a medium strength pour. The aroma is surprisingly malty considering this is an IPA. The hops are there though, and show up as a citrusy fruit aroma. The taste is extremely mellow. A citrus hop element rides in on a strong malty base. There is a slight hop bitternesss that comes in at the end and remains for the aftertaste. I'm not picking up any diacetyl, which seems common to Magic Hat beers, so that's a good thing. Drinkability is very high because there are no real off tastes that I detect and the hops are not raw or abrasive. This beer is not bad, there's just not a lot there. The hops really never assert themselves as you'd expect in an IPA. It almost seems like a pale ale."
"This is amazinly drinkable for an IPA. Hell, even the girl I was hanging out with when I got this loved it. This is the first IPA I've met that I'd drink all night long and not die from hop exposure."
"Once again, their labels are genius. This pours a nice orangey golden color with a strong white head. This smells hoppy as hell. The taste also is hoppy as fuck. The maltiness soothes a little bit at the end of a taste. Mouthfeel moderate but creamy-sticky. This is strong in flavor. There could be more alcohol in here! Very drinkable. After a night of Weizen mystery beers and other magic hatting my stomach needs a rest. Loving the night of the living dead mystery pack though."
"Drinkability: What a surprising English IPA, in my opinion. Highly drinkable -- not an overload of hop flavor, but enough to be balanced and delicious. Yet, don't be wary, you hophead, the hops are still there. This is a pretty great English IPA, and I'd surely try it again."
"I am not too sure, but I am a bit disappointed. Let me explain, this is my first experience with one of these east coast Ringwood breweries, and this beer has nary a hint of diacetyl, a noxious substance I am particularly sensitive to. Oh well, thanks to a recent trade I have a couple more shots to get a noxious butter brew :-)"
"A good lookingdark amber,but the one finger head is a little downer.The smell is good with some mixed spices,but nothing great.A very good hoppy taste with just enough spices without being too overbearing.This is a good solid beer from Magic Hat that is very drinkable."
"Overall = Two great Magic Hat brews in a row. This brewery can really be hit or miss but they certainly did right with Blind Faith. Highly recommended."
"Not at all drinkable. Maybe you'll like this style if you are really into English ales, ESB etc. but this had nothing in common with an IPA."
"good example of the style, comparable to locally brewed english IPAs that i drink fresh on tap. just might be magic hat's most overlooked beer with mainstream potential. why #9 and not blind faith???"
"This is one damn tasty English IPA. For some reason I forgot just how good this one is. Readily available in the NE, this is a great choice anytime. Pick it up and drink it down...highly recommended."
"Dense, off-white head faded slowly to a thick film leaving a sheet of lace as it faded. Chewy piney hop scents over a solid biscuit malt base. Transparent copper colored beer with barely a sign of carbonation. Solid hop flavor up front has both floral and resinous piney notes. There is a dense bready malt base that makes it self known at the same time as the bitterness kicks in. The bitterness is solid in relation to the rest of the beer, and remains quite tasty throughout. The mouthfeel is a bit watery, but the bitterness brings a bit of fullness to the tongue. A solid session beer with flavors and aromas that are solid and balanced."
"A good and an easily accessible IPA (in my area). Now I gotta get it on draught."
"If you like hops this one is very drinkable as it was for me. Right up there among my favorites in the style. Would pair well with anything spicy or pizza too."
"12 oz bottle best by Oct. Pours a nice clear copper with a finger off dense off-white head and a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is a strong earthy hoppiness with a slight citric note. Taste is very hoppy as the nose would suggest, with a doughy slightly caramel malt balancing upfront with a big dose of grapefruit hops which levels off to a nice piney bitter aftertaste. Body is a little on the thin side and the carbonation level is medium/light. This is an excellent English IPA which definitely exceeded my expectations, and it's certainly a great session beer."
"A smooth English IPA with a nice hop flavor. Quite drinkable as the hops are balanced well with the malt character. A good choice to fill a growler with."
"12 oz., best before April. I hope that means next April, not 3 months ago April. Pours an amber/chestnut with a 1 finger tan head that leaves moderate lacing. Smells buttery/nutty with caramel but not much hops. Tastes nutty with caramel, biscuity malts, pine/citric (grapefruit?) hops, and maybe some spices. It has a pretty good bitterness, I'm guessing 40-50 IBUs. The malts and the bitterness are up front and the flavor of the hops hide behind that. It is kinda tingly with a medium body and is pretty good despite the age."
"Drinkability is high. Its nice and refreshing on a hot day."
"Drinkability: While many folks like this beer (and perhaps it is much better on tap), I find it to be an unsatisfactory experiment; I just don't care for metallic IPAs"
"This poured with a huge light tan head. The color was a semi-cloudy orange/amber. It gave off a good hoppy nose. It had a medium mouthfeel with a decent hoppiness in the mouth. The finish was dry, bitter, and very hoppy. This is a good example of an IPA."
"A clean copper colored beer. Has a big foamy beige head with some nice lace. Nice floral hop boquet with some grapfruit and peppery notes and a hint of caramel malt in the background. A peppery hop bite at first followed by a smooth caramel malt sweetness. The finish is back to the hops with a light grapefruit zing."
"Pours a medium amber color with a short and sticky white head. Floral hops dominate the nose with fainter aromas of lemon zest and yeast. Taste begins with a sugary sweetness and maltiness followed by notes of citrus and bitter hops. A raw hop flavor remains in a lingering aftertaste. An easy drinking beernice on a hot day."
"This beer pours a nice clear amber color, it leaves a tan lace that sticks to the glass for a long time. As I smell the beer it smells like honey, lemon, floral essence and maybe plum fruitiness. Umm this beer has a great hoppy explosion, with a slight malty after taste. I taste a sweetness from fruit or honey and it also makes this beer go down nice and easy. This is a good beer, one that I will come back to again."
"Very surprising beer. It has a prominent bittering, pleasant hop aroma and flavor, good malt for balance, and hidden ABV. Poundable, but look out!"
"Not a bad IPA, but not the best. It'll do in a pinch. Not as strong as most IPA's and I felt a little ripped-off after reading the label. Blessed with hops??? maybe....just not enough of 'em. Nice color, hoppy nose, but the taste doesn't follow. I was expect something a little more bitter. I would call this an entry-level hopped beer."
"Drinkability - Very easy to drink, especially for an IPA. Almost more like a Pale Ale. It could be a good session beer in the right circumstances."
"Thanks to sulldaddy for sending this my way. Pours an orange color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a solid caramel malt character with a bit of spice. The spices come through a bit stronger in the flavor with the caramel bringing the backbone to tie things together. Medium mouthfeel and easy to drink. Tasty."
"Thanks to clvand0 and sulldaddy for bringing this my way. It pours a hazy orange with a finger of head that falls to coat the brew. The nose is nice, with nice peppery and spicey hop with an underlying caramel malt. The flavor is very on with the nose, with a spicey hop and a slightly grainey caramel malt. The feel is moderate, wtih a moderate carbonation. I like this brew. The flavors and the nose are nice. Good summer brew."
"Clear amber topped by an off-white head that leaves sporadic lacing behind. Carbonation visually aplenty. Alkaline in smell, something sour, and very earthy/woodsy. Taste is a sharp citric tang that rips right through your mouth. In the middle, some English ale fruitiness combined with some sulfur. Crystal malts come through just barely. Finish is mouth-puckering. Very dry in taste. Medium bodied and carbonated tightly. Feels prickly on the tongue yet remains smooth. Easy drinking stuff but nothing to write home about."
" It lacks the balance, complexity and ""Bigness"" of many of the IPA's available these days."
"Nose is bland, suprisingly devoid of any floral character. Smell is hard to identify-- maybe a little biscuity, or maybe it's just yeast-dominated? Minimal hops noted, more so just a pale ale (this is in complete contrast to the reviews I've read about it). Maybe this batch was just off or the bottle is old. Poured with a big thick head, but still tasted flat. Taste is mildly unpleasant, and lacking in complexity."
"The drinkability, head and of course the hops are most striking. Blind Faith is a hop bully in liquid form."
"The touch of diacetyl, and then the larger dollop in the flavor, lend this American-brewed IPA a distinctly English character. Beyond its appropriate copper color and fading-but-sticky white head, it's aroma grabs you with notes of citrusy and grass hops amidst a yeasty butter, mineral, and fruit combination over a lightly caramelish maltiness. It's easy in the mouth with a medium body and restrained carbonation. And although the flavor offers no more complexity than the nose presents, it is richer, and there's certainly enough complexity there to keep you interested throughout a pint or two. The bitterness is solid, but held back just enough to let the malt shine; and it finishes dry with some lingering bitterness, a splash of citrus, some yeasty fruitiness, a smear of buttery diacetyl, and finally, some lingering yeasty mineral-like bitterness and grassy/leafy hops. It's quite authentic really, and can easily serve as an excellent session beer."
"Poured a nice amber color with beautiful long-lasting head. The hops attack your nose with each swirl. Taste lingers in the back of your mouth and and has just enough bite to make you want to drink more. An excellent IPA and a great offering from Magic Hat"
"pours a nice amber carmel color, with a pretty white head. Very estery, smelling of citrus, and a flower shop. once you take a sip of this puppy and let it sit on your tounge a bit those hops come out and get you. not over powering hoppiness, however a good example of a hoppy IPA. This is an excelent offering from Magic Hat. Feels so good in your mouth with a bit of maltyness, followed by grapefruit sensation. leaves a nice aftertaste in your mouth kinda like a floral thing. it leaves a slight lacing, and isn't overly carbonated. This is good stuff."
"Blind Faith (sorry, I couldn't find any really choice lyrics) is a good IPA and is my second favorite Magic Hat beer behind Hi.P.A. Ringwood yeast is such a polarizer, I'm surprised that the brewery persists in using it. What do I know though? They're a successful commercial operation and I'm... not. Yet another good brew from far333."
"This beer is a copperish amber color with a medium-sized, rocky, off-white head that diminished before the first taste but left a decent amount of lacing 2/3 of the way down. The aroma is marvelous! Right up my alley. Strong hops over a good malt backbone. A little sweet-smelling with some yeasty bread (especially after it warms up a bit) and a hint of caramel under the solid fruitiness of the hops. The taste is surprisingly rather malty. Well, I guess its not THAT malty, but more so than I expected from an IPA. It has a nice fruity and slightly grassy taste and a bit nutty. The finish is where you know that it is definitely an IPA. The malt sweetness fades away leaving a lingering hops bitterness that stays around for quite some time, along with a little bit of yeast. And about 5 minutes after finishing the bottle, I had a little bit of a soft pretzel taste in my mouth. The mouthfeel is very nice, mildly astringent on the finish, the body is medium, medium carbonation. The aroma was what really sold me on this beer, and Im not sure why. A very satisfying ale!"
"It was very drinkable. It doesn't weigh you down. One must pace oneself with this one, though, because at almost 6 percent alc. by vol. one might catch a buzz faster than with other beers."
"Bottle: Poured a clear brown looking ale with a below average head with very little retention. Aroma is standard bitter for IPA. Taste is also quite bitter thought not as much as the west coast IPA. Little trace of water at the ends kind of ruin this one for me. Anyway, still better then some other Magic Hat offerings but nothing that I would really seek again."
"Overall: Everything seems to be in pretty even proportions here, which makes it a nice alternative to a lot of the big hoppy double IPAs I've been drinking lately. Good interpretation of the English IPA, definitely worth trying."
"I purchased a six pack of this while spending the holidays back on the East Coast. I popped the top to reveal the standard hippy-bullshit underneath the cap (Im kidding..kinda). After pouring this into a standard shaker pint the body is revealed to be a beautiful copper/amber. It is nearly crystal clear, evidently due to the fact that the yeast that bottle conditioned this were nicely compacted into the bottom of the bottle. The head rolls up perfectly to fill the rest of the glass, but does recede rather rapidly leaving only sparse speckles of lace and a thin clumpy layer in its wake. When the bottle was opened actual aromas of malts reached my nose from several feet away as well as the more stark aromas of hops that typically greet you when opening an IPA. Upon further inspectionthe malt aromas are nice. The hops I pick up in the nose however seem a little flat, I do pick up on some citric and light pine aromas but also a little sourness that seems out of place. A nice little fruity/nuttiness from the yeast rounds out the nose. The taste fairs a bit better than the nose in my opinion. Nice little layer of sweet malt up front. It seems the flavors of the malt layer nicely with the subtle nuttiness of the yeast. The bitterness levels are firm, but a bit light for what I find perfect in an IPA. The hops almost seem sweet, and although they have a bit of bite arent tongue stripping. About halfway through the last beer in the six pack I think I finally understand it. The sweet flavors of the hop (tangerine/apricot) compliment that nice midly sweet/nutty combination of the malts without totally over-powering them. This creates a balanced IPA, with layers of complexity that peel back revealing others. This beer leaves practically no aftertaste and the taste of alcohol is never even hinted at. As others have said, if there is a such thing as a session IPA than this would be it. Definitely try this one, dont be expect to have your teeth stripped of their enamel by alpha-acids, just sip on it and enjoy the nuances."
"Brownish red with a bold, creamy head. Smells of pine, pot, and mint. A well-balanced taste at first glance, with similar notes as the nose, plus a sticky hop character that stays on me. Alcohol taste comes through when held a moment. It's good, but unremarkable for its style. Good lacing and head retention, but really I can't find any specific cool tastes to mention. It's got lots of hops, but not a mind-blowing kick of it...and a solid malt contrast. But nothing out of the IPA ordinary. Maybe I'm missing something."
"Drinkability and Overall: Not a bad IPA, but far from the rest. I think this beer would be friendly to a palate that is not used too massive hoppage. I don't think Magic Hat found the hop-euphoria they were searching for in this one."
"Overall, it's a very typical offering from Magic Hat. It's non-offensive, and technically sound. Try one, you might like it."
"Pours out a nice clear amber with a white head. The hops come at you up front, but are balanced by a mouthsmacking malt bill. Mouthfeel is above average and the brew is highly drinkable. I'll often order this on tap around Burlington. A very nice mainstream IPA."
"Finally a beer from Magic Hat that I like. This was the last of the 3 that I picked up in Delaware. This poured a nice medium amber colour with a pretty good tight white head. Smell is hoppier than the others. But unlike the others there was none of the odd sweetness to be found. Nice balance between the malt and the Hops. Seemed like it was Cascade but I could be wrong. Over all of the three Magic Hat beers I have tried this was my favourite and by far the most drinkable to me. Now I think I only have the HIPA left to try"
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Taste is smooth grains, mild and sweet--but pronounced. Hops never manifest themselves in a fruity way but go bitter fast through out the drinking, shocking through the left-over cereals taste. Found this IPA to be starkly different from other, ""bigger"" IPAs, refreshingly smooth and mild."
"A very refreshing and hoppy IPA that I will definitely buy again."
"Magic Hat has a future award winner here.This is one pleasing ale."
"The inside of the cap reads, Help me Im trapped in the brewery interesting way to start off your first magic hat brew. This poured out a crystal clear amber color with a tall white head. As the head dies down some lace is left decorating the glass. A mild citric and floral hoppy aroma dominated this one with a bit of a malt backbone coming through at times. Light citric bitter flavors start this off before a slight malty sweetness joins in. A bit of earthy hops add to the mix and this finishes with a mild dry bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Pretty darn good English IPA, I am usually one for the more hoppy American IPAs but this was enjoyable and I would have this again."
"The beer pours a glowing orange with a fizzy white head. The aroma is very good with a nice balance of sweetness and earthy hops. The taste is much the same, biscuity malt and earthy and grassy hops with a dry finish. This is better than the other few English style IPAs that I've had. It is a well built beer that easy to drink and very flavorful while satisfying a craving for some hops."
"The body is full amd carbonation was lively to start but quickly slowed to a stop."
"Blind Faith IPA was served from a 12 oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a hazy, orangy-caramel color, and was topped by a nice and sticky, ample off-white head. The nose was earthy with a robust maltiness that overshadowed the subtle citric-piney resin hop bouquet. Taste-wise, a full and lightly roasty malt profile presented a weak citric-hoppy bitterness. The body was too light for the flavors and style. Blind Faith was a rather disappointing, uninspired IPA that I wouldnt bother with again."
"decent large bubbly head orangy copper color with some haze. grassy hop aroma, balanced and kinda hard to discern some of the aromas, very subtle. again a mild mouthfeel and slight hoppy taste, good one of the better's."
"A very drinkable beer, for the same reasons noted in flavor. Nothing too strong about it."
"Very good though one dimensional bitter IPA. Very hoppy to the extent it was bought past expiry date from the notorious Beers of the World in Rochester, yet still refreshing. Comparable to bigger name microbrewers, pleasant surprise and my first Magic Hat, hopefully of many more. Some malt and orange cream for bonus, great citrus hoppy aroma."
"Nothing chaotic about the chemistry here. This is an exceptional pale ale that is very tasty and enjoyable. Stands up very well to extra sharp, Vermont cheddar cheese."
"Personally I'd prefer a bit less of that mineral bite to make the final touch of the beer a good thing.."
"The mouthfeel was crisp at the start and finish. The tongue felt fry after swallowing. The bitterness lasted long on the tongue too. Drinkability could be higher if the bitterness wasn't so overpowering in this - some more sweetness is needed."
"I really like this beer and one of my favorites from this brewery in Burlington, Vermont."
"The aroma has a surprisingly strong coffee smell that masks almost all other aromas. There is a slight alcohol smell, but the hops are mostly hidden. The taste was disappointing. It had a very harsh bitterness that was not well balanced. I thought east coast IPAs where supposed to be less bitter?! There was also a hint of alcohol in the taste. I cant taste much, if any sweetness. The mouthfeel seems a little too carbonated. The drinkability is lowered due to the unbalanced flavor and high carbonation. Overall a disappointing IPA."
"Drinkability: This is the first 5 I have ever given. The hops are plenty strong and deep. At the same time, the brew isn't mouth-puckeringly over the top (not that there is anything wrong with that). I could drink this all night."
"Medium bodied and crisp."
"This is a pretty tasty, but mild, IPA. It has an amber color. The smell is even more mild than the taste. It smells almost floral, with citrusy hints. The taste is also citrusy, and the hops are complex. It is certainly not overhopped like some IPAs, but is has a nice flavor."
"Comments  Many thanks to francisweizen for sending me this bottle. I had a bad Hocus Pocus experience in NYC last month and was anxious to try another offering from Magic Hat."
"This beer poured an amber coloration. There was very little head and the carbonation was minimal. The smell was rather bland. No hint of the hops promised within. The taste was a diappointment. As with the smell, this was lacking in hoppy bitterness. I have sampled this beer a number of times and in a number of places and my personal palate is always dissapointed. Others enjoy this beer. I do not. There are significantly better beers out there to be enjoyed IMHO."
"Pours a nice deep gold with a tiny light tan head that disappears quickly. Hops hit the nose first, with the malt offering some depth and sweetness. Malt has a firm grip on the palate, with the hops offering some citrus tones. A malty, yet dry finish. Fairly light mouthfeel, with a dry, tannic feeling left. I would have pegged this one for a Pale Ale. Hops don't make themselves known as much as I would have liked. Glad I got to try this one. Thanks to UncleJimbo."
"The bottle cap said to seek malt. Seems the search continues."
"Pours amberish orange. The hops and alcohol odors are quite clear in the smell. I like less hoppy beer so this was a little strong. Not too strong, but strong enough. Toasty, bitter flavors. Has almost a fruity taste when left to sit and temper. A good choice for IPA in my opinion."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a slightly hazy medium red color with two fingers of head. There is a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell isn't too strong, just a bit of hops in there. A fairly nice hop aroma, but you really have to stick your nose down in the glass to get a good whiff. The taste starts fairly malty, with some caramel sweetness. The finish on the other hand, is full of hop flavor. Juicy citrus hops linger on the tongue. The mouthfeel is fairly strong and smooth. The drinkability is really good. A nice summertime IPA."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a complex malt scent, made up primarily of pale and crystal malts. It also has a pleasant floral hop aroma and fruity yeast finish. The taste is good. It has a smooth malty flavor with a mildly bitter hop finish. It has a fruity yeast flavor that is quite complimentary. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good IPA. It has smooth malty flavor and good use of hops; a good drinker."
"Beautiful dark chestnut color, tinted orange, crystal clear, with a half a finger of off white head that recedes quickly but sticks at a nice even top about as thick as the ring. Smell is nutty with roasted malts and a buttery yeast (ringwood, I suspect) and a decent amount of hops. Taste is on the bland side, with a burnt taste and some small hops and malts. Mouthfeel is light and dry, almost dusty feeling, with good carbonation. Its a pretty good beer, but Ive had many better IPAs. Its worth drinking though."
"While basic, it manages to maintain a genuine identity. The grain and narrow hops combo inks its own signature. Granted, the singular hops note might narrow the beer's scope, but if you like it, you'll probably really like it. And simply, I like it just fine. The profile is refreshing and the components make it drinkable and enjoyable. This one has the makings of an old stand-by, tasty and dependable."
"One of my favorite IPAs, as it shows more depth and brewing ability than just a heavy hand with the hops."
"Mmmm blind faith. What a good IPA by Magic Hat Brewery. I find myself craving this beer as the weekend approaches. Slight roasted, coffee flavor with a strong hop taste and dry finish. Gets better as it warms up slightly and other complexities arise."
"EDIT: New cap says, ""In Time, we all Rhyme."""
"this beer is clutch"
"Pours a orange color with a good sized fluffy white head. Not that strong of an aroma, some sitrusy hops but otherwise very laid back. Soft malty start blending into a spicy hop finish, a bit bitter. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Not the best IPA but this is very drinkable compared to some of the overhopped IPA that have come into style. Magic Hat always delivers a well rounded beer suitable for almost any taste, and this is true for Blind Faith."
"Overall: When I first sampled this beer I thought it was a maltier IPA but after trying it again I think it is a very well balanced IPA. There is enough malt present to stand up to the abundant amount of hops used. A well crafted IPA."
"Wyll-"
"Golden color with a huge, frothy head. Good lacing left on the glass throughout. Nice, balanced, floral aroma. The taste is smoother than your average IPA, but still noticably hoppy. Also tasted some apple in there. Left a silky feeling in my mouth and was not bitter in any way. I'm trying to find something bad to say about this IPA, but I can't. It's a great all-around brew."
"Clear, bright copper colored body is darker than most IPAs. Frothy head forms at an inch and a half thick and dissipates to a fine layer of bubbles, leaving lots of lace. The taste is dry, with some nutty flavor and citric tartness thrown in. The malts have a woody and smoky quality to them, and do not impart a lot of sweetness to the beer. Not all that bitter for an IPA and also a bit more complex like an ESB. This is a fine interpretation of the style in the English mold. Thanks AragornUnplugged for this bonus in the box."
"Large taupe head has good retention, leaving creamy lace all the way down the sides of the glass. Hoppy aroma reaches the nose, activating the salivatory glands. A deep amber color unlocks to a smooth and full body, hops standing firm. Aftertaste is excellently bitter, leaving not a memory but the full experience. Decent IPA based on hop amounts but carries none of the spice I'd expect, and in that sense, not truly an IPA. Still, a good offering in terms of ales."
"Strong bitter flavors throughout the tasting profile. The malt sneaks in mid-sip, but is more the accompanist rather than the hop soloist. Solid flavor with wonderful subtle changes prevalent from sip to swallow. The aftertaste is pure dry hop that lingers a long time. Very full bodied for the style. I envision that this would float to the top of any IPA session series."
"Served on tap at ""The Alchemist & the Barrister"" in Princeton, NJ The appearance was better than average. Copper, clear, smallish head. It left nice lacing clinging to the sides of the glass that lingered. That's what scored it the extra points. Otherwise it would have been just average. The smell was just average. To me it smelled like hops and alcohol. The taste was slightly better. Bitter hops, and a bit of piney/citrus bite. Not very complex, just up front hoppy then it fizzles out into a citrus pine flavor. Mouthfeel was good, just the right amount of carbonation to make it crisp, yet not too filling. The drinkability was not bad. I would have drank another, but there was a decent menu there of bottled beer so I moved on to something else. However, if it was this or a mega macro, I'd take this in a heartbeat. Not a bad beer by any means, a decent offering, just not terribly exciting. I tend to like Magic Hats brews better on tap than in bottles, but this time I was a bit underwhelmed."
"Poured a very slightly hazy deep copper color. Very thin head, almost nonexistent. Aroma is not overly hoppy for an IPA, but has some hints of citrus and pine. Some malty, caramel aromas come through, as well. Flavor is not overly hoppy, either. It has a very mellow bitterness with more caramel malt coming through. Very slight hops at the begining, leaving a malty aftertaste. This is a good beer, but not really an IPA."
"Blind Faith pours a light orange color with a some good carbonation that fades to a thin lacy head. Nose is full of hops, with a slight malty backgound. Taste is hoppy with a strong malt presence, maybe some roasted notes as well. Very nicely balanced. Dry finish. Much less assertive in the hop department than a West-coast IPA, but still pretty hoppy. Probably my favorite normal (i.e. <6% ABV) East-coast IPA. A great session beer."
"Eeh, I wasnt really blown away by this ""IPA"" tastes more like a ""PA"" Freshness dating only tells you this should be consumed before ""July"" wonder which July? NIce mouth feel and appearance, but tasted a wee bit skimpy on the malt and HOPS, not what I'm used to in a American IPA...may have been an old bottle (last July may have been the date in question)"
"Poured out a copper/gpld color with a nice head on it. Looks like it's a little darker than most IPA's, but maybe that's just me. This has some huge hop smell to it. I love it. Taste was very good. Nice dose of hops, then those hops have a little bite to them, and then finishes with some leafy/grassy taste. Hardly any taste of malts in this brew. NIcely balanced IPA from Magic hat. Lots of hops with the perfect balance of the citrus, grapefruit, and pine flavor in this beer. One of the best IPA's out there I believe."
"Pours a hazy light amber with a smallish off-white head. Good retention and lacing down the glass. Smells sweetly hoppy with a slight buttery nose to it. Tastes like an average IPA. A hint of malt meets you at first and then you get a sweet syrupy hop wave followed by the burn. Mouthfeel and carbonation are moderate and don't detract at all. Easily drinkable by those that dig this style. Seems like a good summer beer. Not bad, not stellar."
"A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut."
"One of my first IPA experiences. Clear amber colored, similar to cream-soda, with a thin white head. Had an obviously hoppy smell to it, with just a hint of barley hidden inside. Mouthfeel was sharp and crisp, but with slight oily and tannic qualities at the end. Strong presence of hops, somewhat bitter. Puckering aftertaste. Not exactly my cup of tea, but not something I'd turn down."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper with a thin head that leaves a fair amount of lace. Aroma is a mixture of toasted malt and a fair amount of herbal hoppiness with a touch of citrus. Flavor is well balanced, with some bread and nut flavors, some tosted malt, a bit of grapefruit, and a nice lingering bitterness. Well married flavors make for a very quaffable brew. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with medium to high carbonation. A very good everyday IPA."
"IThe Blind Faith I.P.A. had a cloudy golden amber color with a small head and streaks of lace. The aroma was a bit floral and citrusy with hints of caramel. While the taste was citrusy ( orange peels and grapefruit), it was not as bitter as many IPAs due to some caramel flavor. A mellow beer with a little more alcohol than usual. Not being a fan of bitter beers I might consider retrying this one again."
"The appearance was a darker amber color. The smell foreshadowed the strong hoppiness of this beer. The taste was strongly dominated by the hoppiness of this beer. I personally like beers on the hoppier side, so this was not a problem. A little bit thin underneath the hoppiness. No problem with the aftertaste. Fairly drinkable, I drank a few of these in a row. All in all, a nice offering, about on par with the other Magic Hat beers I have tried (#9 and Humble Patience). Another plus to this beer is that it is not terribly expensive, I found it for $5.99 for a cold six pack."
"Hey this is a top notch overlooked IPA....I'm shocked I liked it so much but the blind taste tests do not lie..."
"Blind Faith actually impressed me the second time around and gets kudos from me. It's no #9 but I wouldn't turn one down!"
"Pours your kind of typical IPA color; a hazy copper with a touch of orange color. Beige, off-white head that lasts a bit. Aromas of grapefruity hops and pine with some sweet maltiness coming through. Slightly floral. This IPA has a nice balance to it, not overwhelmingly hoppy or malty, just smooth. Easy on the palate, and very drinkable."
"Big thanks to Xgrigorix for the sample!"
"Poured out a semi-cloudy orange amber color, with a thin, but sustaining creamy head. Not too much going on in the aroma, nothing standing out. The taste is pleasantly bitter with a citrus tang to it. Light malt body, with some grapefruit coming through. Not that bad. Easy to drink."
"I think this is one of the better east coast IPAs. I do like Victory's Hopdevil a little more though."
"Very balanced for an IPA and very nice, not the big and aggressive west-coast style and not worse for it, though when its young in the bottle it can be quite bitter. An easy drinker because of the balance with interesting notes here and there - I like it on the colder side."
"Personally, I have never been a big fan of this brewery, but Blind Faith is a winner. All hop-heads should give this one a whirl."
"This beer pours a rich bronze-gold with a nice short-lived head. The aroma is most definitely hops -- citrus with hints of strawberry. I found this beer to be an excellent balance of spicy hops and sweet malts (heavy on the hops, of course), with a nice dry mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Initially sweet on the tongue followed quickly by that big smooth hoppiness. Balanced nicely, bitter but sugary sweet as well. Medium bodied with a nice hoppy aftertaste. A nice session beer, as they say. Very drinkable indeed. Magic Hat is hit-and-miss for my tastes but this one definitely hit."
"This beer really showcased for me the lingering difference between east and west-coast IPAs. On first sniff, this beer struck me as rather wimpish. The aroma seemed to have much more caramel sweetness than most of the west coast IPAs with which I was familiar, and the hop notes seemed to be mostly floral and fairly mild. The flavor, too, struck me as unassertive. But after a few sips to allow myself to get into the spirit of this brew, it really started to impress me. The body of the beer is, indeed, less ""punchy"" than a lot of West Coast IPAs, but has a delightful subtleness of its own -- a sort of buttery biscuity body, leading to a mostly grassy hop finish. And then there's the aftertaste -- toasty, just a bit bitter, long-lasting and lovely. Muted carbonation brings out the complexities in the flavor, and lends the beer a fuller, more oily mouthfeel. Copper in appearance with a thinnish, though sticky, off-white head. A very nice session beer, and an educative experience for a die hard left-coaster such as I!"
"On draught at The Old Bay in New Brunswick, NJ. Pours a rich amber color with a very thin off-white head. The aroma is very hoppy with a hint of malt as well. Medium body, with a lot of hops and not too much malt balance to begin with, but later on there seemed to be more. The finish is short and hoppy. Not too bad."
"After the Heart of Darkness, this is my favorite Magic Hat beer. A quality IPA, and one I'd have again when I'm in that IPA mood."
"Flavor is very hoppy. Defined oak aged flavor in the first sip, with tons of hops. Complex hop flavor, changing from a grassy herbal to a grapefruity citric tanginess. Solid pale maltiness, with light estery flavors. Apple and apricot, with perhaps a suggestion of kiwifruit. Mild breadiness towards the end. Medium bodied, with a full effervescent carbonation. Definitely a beer I come back to often. Incredibly good in this humid New England summer."
"A very nice IPA with a unique finish. Aggressively carbonated with a tight foamy head that took quite a while to settle down enough to finish the pour. A pleasant whack of cascades hops assails the nose. Flavor up front is sharp and tingly hops, a bit of malt at the middle and then the beer goes bone dry at the finish like dry white wine, yet the hops linger as an echo. A nice change of pace from IPA's that hang at the back of the tongue bitter as day-old coffee. This one gets your attention, then quietly retires."
"Beautiful large head with varied size bubbles. Smell was hoppy, but not overly strong. Taste was a nice hoppy zip, but a bit of oily residue left a bit to be desired. Mouthfeel was crisp, but oily residue lingered to reduce the after effects. Drinkability was average, wouldn't want to drink more than a couple."
"Amber body with sizable foamy head. Serious lacing all the way down the glass. Nice hop aroma (Cascade again???) Seems to be the hop of choice for Northeast brewers. Not a big aroma but enough to satisfy. I'm noticing the northeast IPA's are more balanced and not as big as the west coast IPA's. This is a refreshing ale but nothing really outstanding. Flavor is mild but balanced. Certainly more flavor than their Pale."
" ""Truthsayers beat soothsayers."""
"nice medium dark red tinged amber with a thick not quite white head. the smell is dominated by citrus and hops with some lightly toasted caramel malts in there as well, really appealing. lemony citrus tang to start, followed by light toasted malt taste, and finished with a strong dose of hops, with it's pretty strong distinctive ringwood yeast magic hat taste... very good. medium bodied, and quite smooth for reasonably strong carbonation. overall, a favorite of mine from magic hat."
"Much more malt than I expected in an IPA from magic hat this sure ant number 9 The hops do not dominate but theres enough to make most hop heads happy there is a good mouthfeel balance between the bite of the hops and the smothness of the malt. someone else wrote tat it reminded them of an ESB but i disagree there are way more hops than a true english ESB."
"This IPA pours with an attractive orange color with creamy head hoping aromas of earthy, English style hops that are slightly lemony. The flavor is very lemony almost tea like with a lightly toasty finish. The body is a little light for an IPA and the malt doesn't have much depth but still an above average hop drink that leans to the English side of the style with an unique hop direction."
"Some floral and fruity hop aromas emerge from this copper-colored brew. The head on my particular bottle was a little weak, but what was there stuck around for the ride. The taste is pretty compelling. Being ""blessed with hops"" isn't something I really ever considered, but the slogan is appropriate for this brew. The flavors are big, but they're present -- and they're layered. Grapefruity flavors up front meld with some very light graininess and an herbal sort of finish that lingers...and lingers. I enjoy hops but hardly revere them, and this one sat just right with me. Very tasty."
"It looks like I learned a good lesson today. My second tasting was better than the first. Maybe the first was a bad bottle or the food I was eating it with gave the beer an off taste. Either way every bottle I drank after that was magnificent. Pours with and amber color and a thick white head that lasts a long long time. Aroma is flowery and citrusy suggesting cascade hops. Bitterness from the hops, once again tastes like cascade. A well crafted IPA."
"The immediate aroma is of lychees. Quite floral. The moutfeel is softly carbonated, lightly citrusy and floral, with a touch of acidity. The flavour was less hoppy than the aroma suggested. A nice solid IPA, with a nice soft mouthfeel, enjoyable little beer."
"If I worked for Magic Hat, I would be genuinely embarrassed about Blind Faith's head. It's a joke... bad even for an IPA. If you want a head, you'll have to let it glug like crazy. The smell is on the plus side but it's nothing special. This beer is flavorful, but when I see ""India Pale Ale"" on the label, I want it to hop like a god damn bunny. Nevertheless, at the very least it's refreshing."
"Pours copper with a sticky white head. Definite hop aromas are present. Taste is mainly hops. In fact, that's all I could distinguish. Pretty strong hops, but not as strong as Hop Devil, or some others. Malts seemed almost non-existent. I was a little disappointed by this beer. I thought it would be so much more than it was."
"Much more malt than I expected in an IPA (maybe why HI.P.A. was brewed by MH with a huge hops whack.) The hops do not dominate: there is a great mouthfeel balance between the sting of the hops and the warm roundness of the malt. It really reminds me of an ESB more than an IPA. The alcohol presence is subdued for a 5+ abv beer. Tastes like a session ""non-big"" beer. Be warned."
"This is an excellent example of an American IPA. Full flavored, cascade freshness in taste and aroma and very drinkable."
"I've been a big fan of this beer since before MH was a popular brewer, and appreciate it even more now that I've finally poured one to review. Iced tea colored, with a gorgeous foamy head full of big bubbles. The head stays with me, and laces the glass as I drink. The aroma is hoppy, but not overdone, with hints of citrus. Mouthfeel is full and creamy and enjoyable, and the hop bitter is crisp, and is tasted throughout the mouth, with a lingering bitter in the back. Now I know why I've always liked this one."
"Delicious!"
"Overall I find this beer to be just another great beer from magic hat. From the looks of it it could be just another stock IPA from any brewery, but it's the clear tastes, the balance, and the way it plays with the subtle flavors that trick the drinker. This is what brings me back to this beer and brewery over and over again."
"Drinkability: Very good...I enjoyed this one"
"[Note to self . . . don't drink other IPAs after HopDevil. That's why I'm re-reviewing.]"
"Pours a medium copper color with amber highlights, and exhibits a slight chill haze. It is topped by a fairly dense, 3/4"" head that slowly fades to a thin layer of off-white foam, clinging to the sides of the glass as it recedes. It also leaves a nice lacing as you quaff. The aroma is nice and hoppy, sort of like a restrained, smooth Cascade hop aroma (just checked, actually it is Cascade), but it is mixed with a bit of roasted malt and caramel. Very seductive to say the least. The taste is very bitter, but it grudgingly gives way to a touch of sweetness. The lingering grapefruit in the aftertatse is very well done, as it is not as overpowering or annoying (to me at least) as many Cascade hopped brews. It is as refreshing as slightly sweetnened, fresh-squeezed lemonade. There is substantial malt to support the hops, and it lends a good mouthfeel to the beer. I could probably drink this all night, as it is both tasty and refreshing. Venom gave me three, so perhaps I'll have another this evening. This is a very solid beer, and I look forward to trying some more Magic Hat brews."
"This IPA poured a clear, amber color with creamy, white foam that left good lace down the glass. The smell was floral hops - citrus and grapefruit, and some biscuity malt. The taste was floral hops and malt with a nice citrusy (grapefruit) hop finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with medium body. Nicely hoppy, though not overwhelmingly hopped. The drinkability was good. A nice, easy drinking IPA."
"A 'thank you' goes out to pbrian for including this one in our beer trade!"
"F."
"I tip my hat to both purplehops and UncleJimbo, who both provided me with this one."
"Crankin' A-IPA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Mike"
"IMHO this beer could stand more body. It is more like a pale pale ale with lots of color than an india pale ale. The hop profile of an india pale ale is there but not the body. But it is very drinkable and an intriguing product. I wouldn't turn one down."
"Still, after all that, this beer's primary characteristic has yet to be mentioned--softness. This is perhaps the softest beer I've ever had. This beer might even make a real Czech Pilsner taste hard. I don't know if Magic Hat's water supply is completely devoid of minerals, or if the yeast employed at the brewery has an odd affect on the wort... In any case, this beer is so soft that it literally scoffs at the notion of refreshment... The interesting part? I quite enjoyed it! Very unique in a world full of cookie cutter IPA's..."
"Excellente! I was a little caught off guard with this one. It seemed super refreshing after being on strict diet of Chocolate Stout and Ruination. The aroma is what initially lures you in. It's very fresh and hoppy. Smells like a spring morning. The taste is very hoppy and complex, although definitely a little thin, which was actually ok with me considering what I've been drinking lately. The head retention in my beer was good too, despite what other reviewers have said. This is a definite must-try."
"Second review:Appearance moved up 2.0 points.Very bitter right off.Creamy texture with a dry finish.Too bitter to be a session beer.Rings of lace left with each sip."
"Pours a light amber hazy color. Nice head. Has a great ""pale"" taste followed by a bold citris taste. I downed three of these before I knew it. Good session or football beer, it is present, but not overwhelming."
"similar to Celebration Ale"
"Solid presentation, amber color that provides a nice glare. Strong hop aroma greets the nose then envelops the face. Malt presence is noticeable in a complimentary way. This is a great IPA, arrogant but not forceful."
"Pretty damn true to style. Nice to have a good British IPA around when the stores are crowded with mostly American IPAs."
"This is a very drinkable beer, one of my favorite IPAs and if you can get it in your area grab it quick!"
"All around good beer greate I p a not to hoppy butt the hops are their just not in your face!!"
"Handsome orange amber with white sudsy head that sticks around. Great, sharp aroma of hops. There is a good, British malt character that's quite subtle and then a big smack in the face of hops. Lemon and cookie flavors make up the profile. Refreshing at a quite cold temperature; as it warms the malts gain strength. Delectable hoppy aftertaste brings balance to the beer. Magic Hat makes great British style ales and then turns them 90 degrees on their side to make something unique, some of the best beers in New England (although that whole tired Burlington hippie image smells a wee bit phish-y). I think this beer would go with just about anything, particularly spicy Asian cuisine and maybe even sweet/tart desserts like lemon bars."
"Pours a clearish copper with a thin, off-white head. Leaves trails of lace down the glass. Smell is rather fresh and inviting, with notes of aromatic hops and citrus. Taste is quite similar, relying heavily on fresh hops, citrus (mainly grapefruit), and a sturdy malt backbone that keeps everything in place. Pretty smooth mouthfeel overall. This one could be quaffed over and over again. An excellent IPA."
"On tap at the Great Lost Bear...........Glowing copper color, perfectly balanced full beige head. Smell is full of cascade hop aromas, flowery, herbal, and rich. Initial crisp hop kick dances around on your tongue, then a medium feel, biscuit rich malty background. I guess the odd sourness is the Ringwood Yeast strain that others speak about, not sure, but is still pleasant and appealing taste. Crisp, dry, perfect for the style finish, no lingering bitterness. A slightly subdued, but very tasty IPA. One of the highlights of the summer. It lived up to the hype. This one on tap, prompted me to buy the sampler pack and lug it home to Florida."
"This beer has a serious, sharp hop aroma.  Spicy, floral, citrus, somewhat musty nose.  After the smell, the anticipation of bittering hops don't keep up with the promise of the nose.  Little malt sweetness to balance the hops.  The beer wasn't un-enjoyable, but there are countless better-made IPA's."
"first one was not ice cold and it definitely hurt it. when i had another much chillier, it was a pleasant surprise. pretty smooth, but a little spicy for me. i will have to give this another whirl to get a better sample. after having some good ipa's i will have to get this again to write a better review."
"Pours a nice darker copper color with a decent off-white head that does not stick around too long and a good lace.  Some hops in the nose but not nearly enough.  There is, however, a strange toasted wood aroma that I can only assume is coming from the ringwood yeast.  Very nice taste that starts off with some creamy maltiness with the trademark ringwood flavors before it transitions to a strong floral citrus hops flavor.  The hops are left sitting on the tongue and create a nice lingering bitterness.  The brew is creamy across the tongue but going towards dry at the end.  I would like it to e a little crisper but otherwise the brew is extremely drinkable.  Great version of an English IPA here.  Thanks to Bierman9 for the sample."
"This is my first taste of an IPA, and I was pleasantly surprised. A delicious ale. A nice amber color, very thin head, goes down very smoothly with a clean aftertaste. Nothing bitter about it. A very tasty India Pale indeed."
"Copper color with nice lace head and some serious hop aromas, a veritable hop farm in a bottle. This is probably Magic Hat's best beer. Very drinkable beer, and quite refreashing."
"My first experience with Magic Hat has been an enjoyable one."
"121"
"Cool label on this one...as are all the M.H labels I've seen.Poured into the glass with an average white head, good lace, a clear golden color...no yeast haze here. A nice citrus-y Cascade-y nose, some background maltiness with hops taking charge. Sorta on the light-bodied side, a nice drinkable IPA, good as a ""session"" beer. I like this brewery & hope their more unusual products make it to NJ."
"Very nice beer with hops everywhere!  Unlike some IPAs these hops are spicy in tone rather than citrusy/floral.  There's a substantial bitter aftertaste and a hard-water element in the taste and mouthfeel."
"This is one nice IPA.  Hops make their presence known, but not overwhelmingly."
"An excellent IPA. Maybe just a little more malt would help to balance out the equation."
