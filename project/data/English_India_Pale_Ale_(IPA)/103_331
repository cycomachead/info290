I had the cask conditioned version last night at Clark's ale house and my mind hasn't changed, this is just a run of the mill IPA.  The Late Knight DIPA is amazing and I wish they would change the recipe and kick this single IPA up a bit.  There are so many good IPAs available in the CNY area now and its hard to pick this on a menu","Dwkasper","Sep 11, 2014"

It really followed the nose nicely, and was equally as soft and sweet, but once the liquid dropped off, you got a more intense rumble of bittering phenols, wood, and piney bite. This is surprising when it happens, but it strikes a pleasant balance to the front of the flavoring, which is relatively sweet. The feel was a bit light, but not so noticeable as to wreck your experience.","TheBrewo","Nov 03, 2012"

We're talking pink grapefruit, fresh perfect citrus, combined with all the bitterness you want in a well balanced IPA.

4.05,6.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"The pour brings an orange-copper brew with a good white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward some slightly-earthy and floral hops along with a slight touch of diacetyl, though here it works well. Body has some semi-sweet bread and caramel plus light toffee. Some hop flavor, though that comes in more toward the finish, which has a pleasing dry bitterness. Good balance between sweet and bitter, and the yeast threw off a bit of diacetyl that was allowed to remain, but it fits well with the style. Another solid effort; I really enjoyed all of the beers I had from them.","Thorpe429","Jun 04, 2011"

3.61,-5,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Moderate pour gives a sticky cake of off-white head, a modest 1/2"" thick but with great retention that eventually settles into craters, looks like a big golf ball. Brew itself is a thin clear copper color. Smell is a blend of mildly sweet light malt, diacetyl, then mixed hop coming in third. Taste is much hoppier than the nose implied, a bitter inky generic hop takes control. Malt backbone gives it a moderate body, provides good support, but as far as taste it takes a back seat to the hop. A little candi sugar and even less diacetyl are present. The carbonation is a little heavy/ harsh, but not quite offensive, it keeps the finish clean.","BeerNinja007","Sep 05, 2010"

4.58,20.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Lotsa winter sun shining through this bottle, seems a clear brew, but poured into a pint glass, just a slight haze shows in copper, SRM 14 on my Beer Color Chart here. Very teeny tiny bubbles rise all the time, more discrete than good champagne. Excellent head shrinks slowly, leaving sticky lace on glass and persistent foam on surface. Smells yeasty to me, slightly greenish hop blossomy, don't smell malt. Tastes just great, excellent simple solid-block bitter with hints of yeast and caramel, only a beer pretzel and goat cheese nearby could possibly improve this delish mouth-watering happy/hoppiness. I also enjoy IPAs with more various multi-noted hop flavor, but this huge juicy simple unified hop taste is great, too. Mouthfeel could be too carbonated if you don't pour big head, so let it splash high from your bottle pour. Long lingering oily hop aftertaste just what hopheads live for. I'll admit I'm biased toward local beers, grew up in Syracuse, live in Ithaca now so this counts as locavore politically correct ale for me and I try to keep ImPaled Ale in fridge at all times.

The beer is quite sweet, with florals, oily and estery hops quite noticeable, and a slightly bittering hop presence in the finish. This is a good EIPA, but it is missing the bisquity malts, the more traditional leafy and bittering hops. The citrus and grapefruity tartness just predominates too much for this to be a traditional interpretation of the style. This is more of a nouvelle IPA in all of its citrusy hop zest.

The backbone lasts a good while before any signs of IPA resurface with a hint of peppery and floral hops and notes of butter to finish out the flavors. Medium in body with great carbonation.

4.42,16.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"On cask at Pizza Plant Walker Center in Williamsville. Golden amber with slow and slight but steady rising carbonation and a slightly grey dirty-dishwater head. Very English floral hop aroma, Fuggles probably, and a quite expected buttery scent, too. Mild soapy scent at the end. Reminds me of their 10th Anniversary Ale, except tamed down (duh). Bitter soapy floral hop flavors predominate the first sip with a distinctly mineral finish. Subsequently, a toasted biscuit malt shows, but the flowery English hops are all over this one. A peachy fruitiness emerges, along with a subtle butterscotch flavor, around mid-glass. Medium body and smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Despite slightly high abv, this strikes me as eminently sessionable, so long as one is in the mood for a bit of diacetyl -- and I think that Middle Ages uses that characteristic quite to their advantage, despite the dislike some may have for a ""buttery"" flavor in their beer. I'm far from an expert, but from what I know, ImPaled Ale seems pretty on-point for this style. Nice EIPA.","orfeu","Apr 07, 2006"

Great aroma, some citrus, some floral, full mouthfeel and good duration on the aftertaste, but not adhesive.

Taste is initially strong on hops, then some of the sweet caramel maltiness begins to present itself, and finally hops seem to again predominate. A deliciously complex ale.

Smelled of citrus pine-solishness (with tangerine and nectarine qualities). Way beneath are apricots and pear esters. Tasted flat hop flavor with a late malt accompanied by hop bitter. Not much at the start of the sip, but then a hop bitter and grapefruit slowly arose. Gosh, I'm so used to hop bomb explosions that this is a nice change of pace. This is, in some hoppy flavors, similar to Philadelphia IPA, but toned down a bit. Apricot and other light fruits appear once the beer is fully in the mouth. And then thehops come in, but never reach an overbearing stage. They eventually fade to leave a ptihy grapefruit in the back of the mouth that slowly rolls forward. It's a bitter unpleasant taste, but following its progress is interesting. Also at the end of the swallow, from the malt, is a pear character that helps to keep the pith flavor from killing the beer. Md-liht body that dissapates quickly once down the throat. Acceptable, but not one I will purposefully seek out in the future.","mentor","May 01, 2005"

The experience is overall well balanced though, with the nice malt flavor. The mouthfeel is medium and tingly from the carbonation.

The aroma from this brew is excellent, dominated by a citrus like hop aroma while still having solid malt characteristics. The taste is really good, great malt like characteristics that quickly break to a dominant hop taste that highlights a grapefruit like essence. I must really say that I am not sure what the reason is but my ratings for this brew just seem to be going up and up.

Flavor starts off with a bitter citric hop bite over a malty caramel backbone. A bit of odd flavors are present but donÂ’t detract too much from the brew. Finishes with a bitter citric hoppiness.

There are definate toasted, buttery malts (apparently from the ringwood yeast), but there is a sweetness, almost like rolled oats , and maybe even pine sawdust (probably from the hops). The first taste is a hit of hops at the back of the mouth, with the sweet buttery malts on the front of the tongue. A burnt piny, citrus rind flavor covers the whole tongue lightly.

Now, in the second taste there is a stronger suggestion of the yeastier after-effect of the British leaning American IPAs; like the Shipyard Fuggles, the smooth, caromel flavoring is evident.

It poured a light orange/ochre color with a decent off-white head that slipped away rather quickly leaving some bubbles and a decent ring of lace around the rim of my glass. The smell was not satisfactory. It contained no real aromas save a kinda bland beery malt smell and a little alcohol coupled with a antiseptic, soap like aroma.. The taste was far better than the smell led on with some zesty hop bitterness couched nicely by coppery malts. Not overly bitter, but definitely reminded me a little of bitter cold coffee. Still a little pine like medicianl notes emerging. The mouthfeel was thin and crisp, but nothing extraordinary. Overall this is a decent IPA, but it needs to shape up and become a fuller, richer beer for me to try it again.","GreatPondBrewer","Jul 01, 2003"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours an orange copper color with a creamy white head that quickly fades into a very sticky thin lace. Nose is sweet fruity malts, buttery yeasts, and floral hops. Medium in body and a bit chewy in texture. Taste has a good amount of bitterness throughout with notes of pine oil and grapefruit rind while at the same time there is a nice malt backbone to balance the bitterness. A very nice IPA. Thanks to Denali and stegmakk for the sample!","Morris729","Apr 20, 2003"
4.45,17.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"While English ale is my favorite, I'm also a hop head. This IPA falls in to the medium category as far as hoppiness goes but it sure bowled me over. Outstanding head retention sat upon a medium amber body, lacing was copious. Aroma was tremendous with notes of roasted malt and citrus. Taste was not over the top hopped, and had a nice malty base and as I said before a slight roastiness. Top notch drinkabilty from this east coat IPA, thanks McCall for this fine IPA.","Mark","Apr 06, 2003"

3.68,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Caramel-amber color. Moderate head that quickly dissolved into patchwork lace. Smooth and very much English-influenced in the good balance of malt and solid hopping, with just a touch of floral in the hops to lend some American innovation (or maybe I'm getting a hint in the Ringwood yeast?). Malt is very fresh tasting. Not a stand-out IPA, but quite pleasant.","Brent","Mar 21, 2003"

3.75,-1.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Vlad would have likely thrown back a few of these tasty copper-hued brews amidst the wails of his ill-fated victims. Big aroma of toast triangles beneath a bouquet of daisies and lemon pith. Layers of bitterness sit on top a smooth malt floor. Quite poundable, no doubt, just don't get lost in the moment and sit on the empty bottles for authenticity.","inebrius","Feb 18, 2003"

4.32,13.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"7% ABV. Pours a hazy, orange-tinted copper body that's topped by a frothy bone-white cap. The head holds well and leaves some fairly nice lace throughout the glass. The nose expresses a distinct note of buttery diacetyl that blends nicely with some apricot-like fruitiness and a soft & sweet floral hoppiness. It's very nice, and in fact, I think all of the Middle Ages beers prove that the Ringwood yeast strain can produce some excellent character. The body is medium, but its very fine carbonation is creamy in the mouth and gives the impression of a bigger body. The flavor starts hoppy and finishes hoppy! There's a nice jolt of fruitiness up-front, followed by some soft malt before finishing with a flourish of hop bitterness that leads into a long dry finish accented by lightly earthy and floral hops. Eventually a mild touch of buttery diacetyl also reappears. It's well balanced with a solid bitterness, but it never overwhelms the palate. It expresses much more character as it warms and that's attested to by the fact that it took a Silver medal at the 1998 Real Ale Festival in Chicago! Very nicely done, and well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Jan 19, 2003"
4.28,12.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"This beer pours a nice clear light copper color with a massive off-white head. The aroma is dominated by citrusy hops and has a light caramel that is barely noticeable in the background. Again repeated in the taste are the pungent citrus flavored hops, with a light sweet fruit, caramel, and roasted malts all lingering in the background. The creamy mouthfeel is something I havenÂ’t experienced in most IPAÂ’s, but is quite welcomed! Perhaps just slightly underhopped for an IPA, but it doesn't hurt this brew IMHO. This is a very impressive and fairly complex brew! Sent to me by a mystery BA (I will edit this when I find out who)Â…thanks! Cheers!","BeerAngel","Jan 15, 2003"

4,5.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a copper gold color and formed a nice bubbly white head that left some circular lace. There was a medium amount of carbonation present. The aroma was heavily hoppy, with traces of citrus. The flavor also was very hoppy with some grain elements present. The finish was a bit bitter, but not bad. A nice stab by an American company at an English style IPA.","Wildman","Aug 26, 2002"
4.45,17.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: Well crafted and well balanced ... maybe a little too fruity but what do you expect for the Ringwood yeast strain. One of the top IPAs in the US ... this is the real stuff.","Jason","Apr 01, 2002"
4.2,10.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Really nice on tap, review based on the bottle...very agressively hopped but more under control than some North American IPAs, this may be one of the most drinkable I've had...outstanding grapefruit (sort of a mild ""pink""?) without being unidimensional...smell is nice as well...","ADR","Feb 26, 2002"
3.73,-1.8,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Nice frothy white head that sticks around for a while. Pretty malty all around, with tasty bread and husky grain flavors following a fruity nose. Hops are big and give a very firm bitterness throughout; hop flavors are slightly vegetal and citric in the finish. Very well balanced- its a middle of the road style IPA that works pretty well.","bcm119","Nov 10, 2001"
