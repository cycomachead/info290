The aroma is packed with cedar wood and white pepper then there’s malt, bread, grass, and doughy yeast. Flavor is perfumed bitterness from the cedar, tea and white pepper, followed by citrus hop and caramel malts. Medium body, slightly thick but sadly without a resinous/sticky IPA character, lively carbonation, and a bitter, nearly astringent finish.","SierraFlight","Feb 09, 2015"

3.84,1.3,4,3.75,3.75,4,4,"Single bottle poured into a tulip. A cloudy orange-red with two fingers of creamy beige foam. Aroma is a compelling mix of brittle toffee, orchard fruit (peach and pear), earthy/slightly woody forest floor hops, nuts and pretzels ... Palate is similarly unique. Does come across as an English IPA but with a moderate degree of plum fruitiness, a rich toffee maltiness, unexpected almond and pecan notes, and more expected cedar or sandalwood aromatics. Some diacetyl apparent. A stark contrast between the dry woodiness and the rich sweet malts, somehow it works. Body on the thick side for the style, moderate carbonation and a malt-forward finish seasoned with a dash of woody spice. Unique brew like many of this brewery's other offerings. Not well-integrated yet one can switch between the dry floral fruitiness, the woody spice, and the sweet dessert backbone and not get the least bit bored.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 08, 2014"

APPEARANCE: amber color and hazy. moussy tanned head with good retention. TASTE: medium bitterness that lingers into a dry finish with no hop flavours. unbalanced high malt flavours. PALATE: medium-light body with moderate carbonation. OVERALL: although the comercial description says it is a IPA, this beer is unbalanced towards a sweet malt profile but its not that bad.","titvs","Sep 13, 2014"

4.42,16.6,4.5,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Poured a gorgeous fully cloudy amber with a thin white head that leaves some lacing. It looks like gorgeous, natural, earthy unfiltered apple juice. Just looking at it makes me want to drink it. Scents of caramel, earthy, herbal hops, earthy yeast, grape, slight citrus aromas in the background and faint undercurrents of cedar. A very nice, earthy, sweet, fruity aroma profile, different from a lot of IPAs, even English style IPAs, that I've had. Its pleasant and inviting. Taste begins sweet with caramel, moving into some nice herbal hops and a tea-like flavor. Throughout there is a nice musky, earthy, yeasty presence that compliments the herbal and tea flavors of the hops wonderfully. There are also slight undercurrents of cedar in the background throughout the sip and some light citrus peel bitterness on the finish. The aftertaste is mildly bitter, but not overwhelmingly so. A good, earthy, sweet, balanced flavor that avoids being both too sweet and too bitter. Very well executed. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and with low carbonation. It feels like a good, classic style ale should. Quite nice. Overall this is a very good take on an English IPA. It's balanced and malty, but with a good underlying bitterness and an aroma that is flat out amazing. Very highly recommended.","Auraan","Mar 10, 2014"

The hops are not overstated like many in this style and the cedar adds an exra which complements the hops and finishes this beer very, very well.

Interesting aroma, a combination of spicy wood and floral character. There's a mild nutmeg component and hint of citrus. The wood aging was a little overdone in the flavour - too much cedar and wood resin along with a dry astringency - but the hops weren't completely overwhelmed. Bitterness was light, as was malt sweetness. Notes of nutmeg and cinnamon appeared mid-palate. Slight warmth in the finish. The carbonation died down quite quickly, starting very high but becoming a bit low after 10 minutes or so. Overall it's an interesting beer, but the wood was too much for me.

It was fairly thick with some carbonation, and had a sweet and spiced aftertaste. Overall this had a very unique taste that's well constructed and pretty enjoyable.

Pours hazy pumpkin color, with a nice head, but it was a bit cold and my pour was weak, so I'm not going to take off for that. The aroma of cedar makes it smell like a closet... and I mean that in a good way. The taste is initially sweet, like many strong IPAs can be, but then it gives way to earthy, cedar.

Floral and aromatic hops throughout, bitter finish like a tangerine rind. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and stimulating. Malt body is light but present. Are these unique characteristics from rice?

Lots of citrusy notes, like strawberry-lime-orange juice, and dusty, black-peppar spiciness. Not very woody, but I would assume the spiciness comes from the cedar influence. On the palate, sharp juiciness and big carbonation first off, then some citrus, tobacco notes, and pepper. Big carbonation in the mouthfeel, sharp citric hops and a distinct lack of smoothness imparted by barrels.

The taste is quite dry, with a resiny bitterness that, at times, seems a little harsh. The wood quality is present throughout the beer.

The wood flavor is sharp and pervasive and adds an element Ive not found in any other beer. There is a fair amount of hoppiness, but it melds together with the cider notes as they both touch on resiny and piney flavors thought there is no mistaking the cedar presence.

Lots of citrus notes, orangey, very soft hops.. A treasure of an aroma, unarguably unique, yet it feels like an old friend immediately. Highly fruity, floral.. makes me think of spinach even and definitely algae. Firm and mellow bitterness at the same time.. Incredibly tasty and aromatic, lots of different range of flavours that youd never think match together, but you needed Japans advanced beer science to come ahead with that. Very small bubbles procure a biting bite everywhere at once, but it is comfortable if only for the flavors.. I want more in my mouth with every sip.

I don't go for IPAs, but this one is pretty swell. The mouthfeel is full, but not overwhelming. Carbonation is moderate, and drinkability is good.

There is a bit of fruitiness here in the nose as well, but it is almost not perceptible under the cedar. I get aromatic notes of strawberry, tamarind, almost like a rose wine underneath the cedar. The beer is quite spritzy up front, with a fruity acidity. The finish is astringent and hoppily bitter with a long dry note of cedar that dominates the finish. There are notes of cedar (obviously), citrusy hops, and mint. This is quite an interesting beer, it is a mix of solid hoppiness and cedar.","Gueuzedude","Apr 12, 2005"

It's hazy dark amber boddy teems with zesty bubbles beneath a huge head of frothy off-white foam that has amazing staying power and leaves rings of thick, fluffy lace about the glass. The nose is amazingly distinct and cedar-like, but there are other spice aromas in there as well including some nutmeg, a pinch of black pepper, a brush of cinnamon, a sprig of pine, and a spritz of citrusy fruit juice. Wow.... it's really interesting. Once it's settled a bit it's airy in the mouth rather than bristling (as the sight of the bubbling carbonation and rocky head might suggest) with a medium-light body that's slightly dextrinous and moves smoothly across the palate. In the flavor, the spices hit you right upfront; followed by a bit of gently fruity yeastiness (or is that citrusy hop?) and a delicately sweet maltiness that's similar to a glazed doughnut - and wham - there's the dry bitterness as some pine and a slap of cedar re-appear. As the botterness fades from the long finish some more maltiness becomes evident, and some prickly spice appears. It's intriguing and complex, but not particularily drinkable. I prefer the cedar in the nose.... but I guess the two go hand in hand. It's astonishing and mesmerizing in one serving.... let's just leave it at that.","NeroFiddled","Feb 16, 2005"

I swear I could catch a whiff of cedar in the aroma. A fairly fruity ale (I guess that's the English part) with a fairly sharp bitterness accented by the high carbonation. The finish is a bit tart and very dry (this is Japansese after all.) There's an herbal quality that emerges as the beer warms up in the glass. I really like this beer, probably becaue I like hoppy/bitter beers that finish dry. This beer is a fary cry from most English IPAs that I've tasted, but I do like the Japanese take on the style, and the unusual used of cedar for aging instead of oak.","marcobrau","Jan 24, 2005"

The gushing really tests ones patience. Eventually the beer settled down a little yielding an extremely dense white foam head atop a cloudy orange body. Smell has has wood notes which fight for dominance with the hops. Nose is a tad dry as well. I really got a large dose of woody/saltyness from my first few tastes. The saltyness eventually fades away to reveal a very crisp hop bite that ends up being quite refreshing and belies this beer's potency. There's no doubt that this is a very interesting IPA and if it weren't for the carbonation issues I would be sure to pick more of this up.","soper2000","Jan 23, 2005"

Taste is really interesting...starts out a bit sour intitially, then finishes with grapefruit, but minus the hops. It's like it's pure grapefruit juice, not an effect from the type of hops used.

Along with the hops you expect from an IPA, there was a spicy almost peppery taste up front.
