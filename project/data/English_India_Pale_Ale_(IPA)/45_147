It pours brilliant amber  under a persistent 2"" foam cap. On the palate it has a creamy malty attack with a pleasant hop accent and a dry finish. It is an easy drinking medium bodied beer with slightly above average carbonation.","pat61","Mar 05, 2015"

A little tricky getting the foam under control in the keg, but has a nice slow pour, 2-3 finger head out of the tap, dissipates quickly though.  Seeing some other reviews, I have to think it's a different experience out of the keg.  Nicely balanced hoppy/floral aroma, and the taste follows suit with satisfying carbonation as well.  If you have not had this out of the tap, I would recommend it.","KegJeff","Feb 10, 2015"

Although the initial taste can be bitter and frightening, we learn that the overall feeling is of a quite essential alcoholic necessity. In conclusion, the alcohol percentage was a plus, as well as the foreign aspects of the beer itself. George Hodgson should be proud.","JNisher","Dec 20, 2014"
3.4,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,3.5,"A bright but clear copper orange in the glass topped by a finger or so of off white head that falls quickly with some lace.  The smell is lemon citrus and grassy hops with some biscuit grain.  There is a bit of a metallic character in there as well to round it out near the end.  The taste is much like the smell with the lemon floral hops hitting up front and carrying a moderate amount of bitterness throughout.  The metallic flavor is there as well but it isn't bad as the malt comes through too but it doesn't quite do enough to balance the hops.  Crisp and clean at the finish and lively in the mouth due to a good dose of carbonation and the spiciness of the hops.  Overall this is pretty nice as the English IPA is often overlooked and quite different from the more popular American style.  The subtle hops combine nicely with the malt to provide a different but satisfying IPA experience.","fank2788","Dec 20, 2014"

Flavor reveals a strong caramel malt backbone, fairly sweet, which is contrasted by moderately bitter hops at the finish. Herbal hops provide a bridge mid palate and resurface in the aftertaste. The herbal hop character isn't my favorite, and bitterness is more than I'd prefer in the finish. Malt is a bit overly sweet.","barczar","Sep 29, 2014"

Well, again, where's the god damn date?! I have no idea, but the hops are just not there at all. This is more malt than anything to me and I have a feeling I just have an old, old, bottle but nonetheless. This was a pretty disappointing offering from Brooklyn for me. I'll only be seeking this out again to find out if this is a truly disappointing beer or if I got a bad bottle. Bummed for sure at the moment though.","Ngntjp","Sep 16, 2014"

English inspired yeasty esters as well as just a touch of butterscotch. The flavor follows the aroma. Sweet bready caramel malt with enough earthy hop to balance. Light fruity notes and a touch of butterscotch round this out. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. Decent English inspired beer with a bit more hop bite than its true English counterparts. I prefer an Americanized version honestly.","johnnnniee","Jun 14, 2014"

3.82,5.2,3.25,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Following on the heels of this brewery's amber lager, poured from a bottle enjoyed at a Calgary pub. A pale yellowish amber brew with a moderately large white head, nice IPA lacing left on the glass. Aroma is hops forward, smells like an admixture of British and American cones. Some pungent grapefruit and an interesting blend of herbal aromas and orange rind on both nose and palate (ever try a kumquat?), along with lemon grass, medicinal herbal tincture, sourish bramble fruit jam, green bananas, and a flinty earthiness (is there Goldings in here or is my palate playing tricks on me?). Brooklyn can sure generate some unique hop flavors ... This one is bitter but the hop flavors and aromas get center stage. What about the malts you ask? Quite nice actually, nutty brown bread and some classic old English tastes. According to the label the malts and hops are English but I taste and smell US hops as well, ""fo sho"". Semi-buttery mouthfeel with some diacetyl apparent, more carbonation than many English ales but the bubbles are not a nuisance element here. Interesting take on the style, a sneaky (or not so sneaky) amalgam of old and new world elements.","CalgaryFMC","Jan 20, 2014"

Smells of citrusy and piney hops with a slight sweetness and bread. Taste follows suit. Except the hops are much more in flavor and aroma than bitterness, which I really enjoying. A nice easy drinking hoppy beer, that is more about hop characters than bitterness, with mild malt starting and finishing with the mild bitter of the hops. Slightly creamy in the mouth. Really enjoyed this, very nice surprise.","Twobeards","Jan 16, 2014"

AROMA: crisp floral hops with caramel malts as a base; a bit of pine resin, but overall a relaxed, balanced IPA ... PALATE: medium-to-full bodied, with a strong presence throughout the mouth reasonable aftertaste...TASTE: a nice balance of sweet malts and bitter hops--not really pushing either aspect, to the point where this could be considered a straight pale by flavor... OVERALL: Having had many Brooklyns in the past, it was high time I rate some; the fourth in a series of IPAs this weekend, this brew doesn't stun or disappoint--it fulfills its duty and eases one into the evening with a sessionable sensibility...","dacrza1","Jul 31, 2013"

Crystal clear effervescent gold with a medium white head that fades into a disc of fizzy foam. Smell is crisp and clean, some herbal and skunkier hops with some clean malt behind it. Taste follows just about the same; crackery malt with herbal grassy hops, a good amount of bitterness but not unbalanced. It's funny, an English IPA on the lower end of hoppiness is almost the same as an APA on the higher end of hoppiness. This beer is great for the style, crisp and refreshing, even a bit dry.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jul 08, 2013"

Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of orange zest, pine, bread, citrus rind, floral, light caramel, and piney spiciness. Nice aromas with good strength and balance; a bit too piney. Taste of orange, citrus zest, bread, pine, floral, citrus rind, light caramel, and light piney spiciness. Good amount of pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pine, citrus rind, bread, light caramel, floral, and light piney spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice hop flavor balance and malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, sticky, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice IPA. Very nice hop and malt balance; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 02, 2013"

It fits the description of an IPA - plenty of aromatic, bitter hops and a hint of caramel malt, yet it lacks something. The hops are dry and overpowering - the malt just doesn't balance them out. There is a harshness that reminds me of stewed leaves; perhaps something brought out in the boil? A few off-notes also lurk, including an unwelcome whiff of solvent. A decent but flawed effort. If I had to make one suggestion, I'd say beef up the malt. Not world class, but worth trying.","jazzyjeff13","Nov 19, 2012"

This is clearly not a sessionable IPA at this abv, but I never would have known it was that high until I bothered to check.

3.92,8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The Crack & Glug produced two-plus fingers of dense, tawny head with very good retention. Nose had an earthy hop quality to it, not minty or pine, but more like freshly picked vegetal matter. As the head slowly fell, dense, sticky lacing remained in its wake. Color was an oh-so-slightly hazy deep orangish-amber. Mouthfeel was medium with a combination of grassy hops and honey-like sweetness on the tongue. I was reminded of tea at one point. Finish was equally mellow and certainly not indicative of the 6.9% ABV noted on the CAN. Man, I felt like I could easily quaff several of these without any problem. I remember the first time I tried an English IPA after many months of steady AmeriCAN IPAs and feeling disappointed. Not so in this case! Put some in a cooler and head to the beach!","woodychandler","Jun 20, 2012"

Not a lot of hop flavor beyond bitterness. There is a good amount of malt character. Reminds me of a very light version of their Monster Ale Barleywine. I would say that this beer is of medium light body. There is not enough hop flavor to justify the bitterness, in that way it is not very well balanced. This may be to style. If all we had were English Pale Ales, I may not have become a fan IPAs. I have had this beer a few other times and felt disappointed. But since I have become more knowledgeable of beer, I figured what I had had may have been too old, or too cold to fully enjoy. That was not it. If you like bitter beer and don’t like citrusy American hops this may be the beer for you.","omokoro","May 31, 2012"

Aromas of blended toffee and caramel sweetness combine with a slightly floral and citrus hops presence. Flavors are hop forward, with a peppery and bitter character initially balanced with a roasted caramel backbone. The sweetness becomes tangy across the tongue, with a more resiny and rich hops presence at the end of the palate, leading to a bitter and slightly dry aftertaste and a rich, slick, and somewhat dry finish. The beer's flavors are simple, yet tasty, and the body of the beer is dynamic throughout the tasting.","GarthDanielson","Apr 28, 2012"

This, however, never took away from the flavor, which was robust and present throughout. Everything balanced nicely, with the robust malts, and the bright grassy hops giving a unique product in the end. With such a big malt profile, we actually felt this to be rather similar to a Belgian IPA. Regardless of style, this beer was tasty, and perfectly complemented our jalapeno quesadillas.","TheBrewo","Apr 24, 2012"

Recommended as a curveball from US IPAs which still holds its own.","danieelol","Jan 19, 2012"

3.83,5.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Best by Nov 2011, thought I would give it a shot. Pours out a pale copper color with a somewhat creamy looking head. Some faint lacing on the glass. Smells like earthy, spicey hops and some biscuity malts, with some vinous aromas in there as well. Taste has a nice citric twang, with some more sweet pale malts to balance it, some acetaldehyde, and a bittersweet aftertaste. To me it seems more of an English style IPA than anything, no piney hops that I can detect, and it reminds me more of a English style bitter than an American IPA. There is more character from the pale malts than your typical IPA, and has that faint earthy, peaty flavor perhaps from the combination of the European hops and malts. It is decent beer, but personally I think Brooklyn's beers are decidedly English, which makes sense given the history of America. Moutfeel is pretty smooth, nothing to remark about. Overall this is a pretty drinkable pale ale, more English style in that the hops play a nice bittering effect rather than a highly aromatic and flavoring one. I like an IPA that I can get more from the hops than just the bittering effect. Anyway, a good beer probably more authentic to the original style than most, just I have grown to love the big dank, resinous, smack you in the face with hops, American-style IPA.","Star80","Aug 20, 2011"

But when I look at what I reviewed of this in a bottle vs. what others have said...I'm wondering if the tap was mislabeled. The handle clearly says ""Brooklyn IPA"" and it definitely has the classic Brooklyn logo - but it's not like the East India Pale Ale I had in a bottle, although it does appear to match a few of the reviews here. Well, regardless of if this is the right beer or not, it was a very good beer and I enjoyed it. I would easily have another. A solidly good American IPA and that's how I've rated it - as it is not an English style despite the ""East India"" title. I'd knock it down to 3.5 across the top if I was going for style, but I really can't here. This was a damn good beer.","damndirtyape","May 25, 2011"

It certainly was a bit hoppier and had more punch. A dark golden colour in my Mikasa goblet. Minimal head but did have some lacing tendencies. Smell is Malted, with mild pine scent. Reminiscent of Marston's pale ale but better. Taste is slightly malty with some bitterness. Mouthfeeel is light to medium bodied with some bite! Overall a good English IPA and a so-so American IPA.

3.85,6.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Brooklyn EIPA pours a hazy rich tangerine color. A thin, one finger, white cap forms (disappointing), but lacing is decent. The nose is bready malts and spicy/herbal hops. It's decent but nothing super impressive, and it's a little weak to be honest. Flavor is better, the malt backbone is a little more assertive. The appearance of bitterness from the hops is noticeable, but brisk and not in any way harsh. The classic English hop flavors as in the nose close things out (I'd say more flowery than spicy). Body is surprisingly light given the ABV, and that's not a bad thing. Carbonation is solid, it really opens up on my tongue. This beer drinks quite well, thanks in part to the restrained bitterness. I was surprised while typing this review to look up and see that the ABV is 6.8%, I wouldn't have guessed any more than 5.5% or so. I know English IPAs aren't in vogue here in the US, but for what it's trying to be this Brooklyn beer does its job admirably and is a refreshing change from the citrus hop bombs that most brewers seem enamored with.","axeman9182","Oct 07, 2010"

I get a lot of toffee and caramel malt, along with some grassy and earthy hops. The beer also tastes a little bit like iced tea. As the beer warms, I get some more pine notes in the flavor.

Lemony, grassy and herbal hops dominate the aroma. The flavor is quite strange. Very bitter, but the hop flavor is a flash in the pan that soon gives way to harsh, dry bitterness. What little hop flavor there is tastes like lemon grass. Not a bad flavor, but I prefer it less than either the usual American or British hop profiles. Alcohol is strangely evident even though this beer is under 7% ABV. Really not getting much malt at all, this beer seems buried in bittering hops. Very dry finish and a body that is on the light side of medium. It would be fairly drinkable if not for the fact that it really does not taste that great. Pretty disappointing coming from such a renowned brewery.","zoso1967","Mar 05, 2010"

Taste follows nose - more citrus revealed with a slightly medicinal bitterness that lightly lingers at the finish.

There's a funkiness to the hop flavor that I've never encountered before. Perhaps I've just become accustomed to American style IPA's and this one, which leans more towards the original British style is lost on me. At any rate, I'm not really digging the flavor provided by the hops. There's something muddled about it and I find myself missing the bright citrus and pine flavors that I've grown accustomed to.

This has to have the worst head and retention of any IPA I have had. This is shocking to me. Garret Oliver makes beautiful beers, and this is anything but. The aroma is sweet with just a hint of hops. Caramel malts drown out most of the floral hop aroma leaving it just at the end of the nose. The flavor follows suit. The hop presence is very subtle reminding me almost of a amber ale rather then a English IPA. The hops are almost non existent. Just a mild floral and grassy spice from the hops are present. The mouthfeel is light for how sweet the body and nose are. This would be a easily sessionable beer for someone getting into the style. This beer really reminds me of an American version of Keith's IPA.","hwwty4","May 12, 2009"

There's also an unpleasant quality to its aromas that I can't quite describe...reminds me of algae. Its taste, however, is not bad. Not overwhelmingly hopping but definitely emphasizing the hops in way that makes for an almost tart flavor with a quick, crisp, quenching finish. Its malts are pretty fruity.

As expected, a quality (solid) offering from Brooklyn Brewery, but as IPAs go, not quite what I had hoped. Wan yellow/amber in the glass, with a decent head that dissipated quickly. All hops in the nose and in the initial taste--a citrusy flavor that, while not bad, was not as balanced as other craft IPAs I've tried lately.

This is followed by that odd plastic like taste. The malt is present throughout the brew which gives a bready balance to the hops. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation; finishes crisp with a light bitterness from the hops and a subtle sweetness from the malt. A solid English IPA.

It looks promising enough in the glass. A nice orange-amber hue with decent head. Things go a little sour with the nose, though. Smells a touch sour, literally, and relatively one-noted with a light citrus dominating. The flavor is no saving grace either, as it disappointingly has that, in my opinion, Brooklyn house yeast flavor. There is some tropical fruit in there, mostly a bitter orange quality, some resins showing up as well, a touch of honey and a hop bitterness that rides the sides of the tongue. The finish fades fast and once again a sour character makes a ghostly appearance. This sourness I have refered to is not so dominant as to be an infection, which is good because I have noticed it in a number of the Brooklyn beers. It is just a 'house' flavor that my palate doesn't love. It is still a decent beer though and I am certainly going to drink the rest of its 12oz. friends. This just isn't one of my favorite IPAs.

This beer has a nice maltiness which gives it a nice flavor balance. The style is a bit different than most IPAs in the sense that it lacks that bitterness reminiscent of the typical IPA.

This is a medium bodied beer, a little chewier than most IPAs, and there is a little bit more sweetness on the front end than is often the case. There is also a slightly syrupy quality you'll find as well. The beer has a big malt character and it does get bitter on the back end, but not so much from hop esters; the bitterness has some tea like qualities, perhaps a slight nutty flavor emerges as things settle in too. There is some huskiness to this beer, but mostly just big malts come through. It is not nearly as dry as is often the case with this style. The ABV on the bottle is 6.8% ABV, slighly less than the 7% ABV noted above. I'm thinking that this beer has gone through some transformations since it was first introduced.

Wonderful hop aroma that reminds me of Chinook hops, very floral with a hint of citrus. The first flavor sip comes across as a shock, not as hoppy as the aroma with a very smooth well-balanced malt finish to it. Hints of grapefruit are present but not as overpowering as most of todays AIPAs. This makes me believe that this is very close to what the British were making when they brewed IPAs back in the day. Stronger alcohol content and a great use of hops makes this a great version of a classic beer style. I believe that George Hodgson would be proud that this beer is so close to the style that he once brewed.

4.29,18.2,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a clear copper in color with about a finger of creamy light tan head that quickly dissipates. Smell is quite hoppy with some caramel malts in the background. At first I can detect only floral and citrusy American hops (Amarillo) but as I take another smell the American hops have given way to earthy, fruity, and distinctly English hops (KG). As I drink this one the aromas blend together wonderfully. Taste is good, just a touch malty at first but with a malt backbone all the way through. After the brief initial maltiness this beer becomes distinctly bitter and hoppy. Hop bitterness is present throughout but reaches a crescendo in the finish. Hop flavor is also very present here with the American varieties dominant at first but then overtaken by the earthier English varieties as we move into the finish. Mouthfeel is good with a medium-light body and moderate-low carbonation. Drinkability is quite good. This beer is very complex and interesting. I didn't notice the 7% ABV at all. It's certainly an IPA but the use of both American and English hops makes this unique. It shows some of the more restrained hopping typical in English versions (compared to American versions) but the use of more ""aggressive"" American hops makes it more typical of the American style. Overall, this is quite a beer. If I were reviewing it very based on a style (English or American IPA) it wouldn't fare as well but more generically, as a simple IPA, this is wonderful. Strongly recommended.","mnj21655","Jan 04, 2008"

Low amount of bubble on the tongue but a slightly thicker liquid experience on the tongue. Definitely drinkable.

This beer has a crisp pale malt background that acts mostly to balance the hop bitterness and flavor profile. A round earthy hop taste is dominate and dances on the pallet for several moments after the sip is sipped. Gotta love dry hopping! The mouthfeel is light with sharper carbonation that helps pronounce a spicy hop flavor. This beer goes down well as long as you can handle hop bitterness. I might be bias since I love it. Brooklyn East India Pale Ale is an excellent IPA style beer. The hop aroma's are pronounced and the bitterness is relatively subdued. Damn good beer.","BeerLover729","Dec 20, 2007"

The flavor starts out with a strong bitterness that is somewhat overpowering at first but as I warm to it it fades a bit and allows the hop flavor and malt to shine a bit. There are similar citrusy hop flavors as the aroma, as well as sweet fruity and slightly biscuity malts.

But still, you can tell this was an IPA just by that bitter hop-taste lingering in the back.

Hop bitterness flavor is bright in the English style. More lemony than most US versions which tend toward grapefruit, orange and peach hop characters. Some mild mint and pine notes come through to reinforce the leafy, fresh hop cone sensation on the palate. Taste is lip-smackin' and dries out quickly giving a thirst for the next quaff.

This is a malt forward EIPA, as its style sort of designates. It is quite balanced, having the complex, toasty malts hit you first, followed by the floral hop flavor, finishing with a balance of crystal sweetness and hop bitterness. As there are so few good examples of this style, Brooklyn does it far better than the competition (Blind Faith, as I recollect was a damn good one too). My only complaint which affects the drinkability a bit is the overall feel is just a bit too sweet.

Caught me a little off-guard. Fruit and toffee malt follow. Toasted, minerally biscuit edge to it. Bitterness comes on stronger in the dry finish. A little alcohol detectable. Medium-bodied with a slightly sticky feel. I think a creamier feel would do this beer better. Not bad, but not great.","alexgash","Apr 03, 2007"

A good sticky bitterness remains as I swallow as well, so that is where I determine this deserves to be categorized as an IPA. That said it is super drinkable even at 6.8%.

A slightly watery to a light/medium feel, there is little bit of a tingle to the carbonation.

The clarity is well defined and the carbonation streams up in random jets from the bottom of the glass. Inhaling over the glass, I find strong vegetal hoppy aromas, almost piney, but not quite. The caramel malt base is strong, and the hop hits as a spiceyness on the end that adds a subtle pepperyness. It is interesting. Tasting it, there are notes of caramel and spicey/peppery hop that dominate, though nothing about this one is very strong. The second sip brings more toasty notes from the malt along with a mild piney to chewy resinous hop flavor. Seems that this one takes a few sips to really hit the tastebuds correctly. Pretty good. The moutfeel is on the thin side, with a very mild carbonation as well. Not quite the presence I was looking to find. I do enjoy the flavor profile here, and I appreciate how it didn't smack me too hard. I think it is well rounded and a very nice brew.

Apple skins in the nose, with a mix of citrusy/grapefruit american hop aroma and a whiff of floral english hops. Big toasted pale malt sweetness on the first sip. This is followed by a very robust Fuggles and East Kent hop flavor, and some mild fruity esters. Aftertaste is full of herbal hops and dry, but some cidery notes still linger. Low-medium carbonation and medium in body. The lower carbonation may be appropriate for and English IPA, but it could stand some crispness to combat the apple fusels and resinous hop oils. Esters turn the finish a bit harsh. Although a little off-balance, this one will surely satisfy the hop jones.","PBRstreetgang","Sep 11, 2006"

Besides, it doesn't have the heavy malt inspiration that I expect from an English. But, the hopping variety and rates do agree with the English recipe. Nonetheless, the beer does have a malty / caramelly base (although light) and the bready / toasty flavors and aromas play a back-up role. The hops, indeed, show an earthy bitterness (rather than the citrus flavoring espected from American IPA's) despite a light copper favor and feel. The bitter to sweet ratio is consistent with what I expect from good American IPA's. Nice stuff.

Nary a trace of fuitiness or floral characteristics. Spot on for this historical work. Mouthfeel light to mid. Drinkability is fine. Leaning toward indifference. A decent representation of the style.","SupaCelt","May 08, 2006"

This is a really nice IPA, a good change of pace from the American hopbombs I love, a great balanced session beer.

The flavor is very interesting and definately not your typical IPA, not very bitter (at least in the realm of IPA's) but with a big hop flavor, i guess it was all those low Alpha Acid hops they used. Taste begins with a citrusy(grapefruit and orange peel), spicy, minty, and slight pine resin like hops flavor followed by a barely noticeable toasted malt flavor that doesnt balance as much as it should.

I've never picked up a bad bottle from Beltway, but it's possible that this sample was past its prime. Alternatively, this could be an example of Brooklyn sticking to a more British style, as with the Monster Ale. Either way, this one has a slightly off flavor which makes it hard to recommend. Not a terrible beer by any standards, but my first disappointment from the Brooklyn Brewery.","jed","Sep 04, 2004"

Strong mid pallette shows some more of the herbal hop character, a pretty strong alcohol taste and a real zesty kick Finishes smooth and a bit creamy, tingling bitterness, slightly drying with a clean and slightly hoppy. Hops use in this ale is strange. Kind of a rough, leafy effect that I thinks hurts the brew in the long run Overall - I don't know what it is about this beer that I don't like. It may be what I detect as an intense earthiness that puts me off. Not sure how to describe it. It's probably the only beer I have ever had where I seem to like its component parts better then the beer as a whole. Sounds weird? It is. I don't get it either.","bmills1608","Aug 19, 2004"

Aromas are of citrus and floral hops, with a nice malt background. Initially this beer hits quite sweet with citrusy hops leading the way, but they definetly are not as pronounced as the bottle version of this beer. All sorts of malts show up after the initial hop burst, showing off some nice biscuity, dough, and bread like flavors. There's also a slight sweet caramel that fits in nicely to the picture. This beer finishes with a zinging hop bitterness and an oily almost juicy aftertaste that just sticks on the tongue. This beer is light bodied but super creamy and super smooth from the conditioning of the cask.

Smell was hops, citrus, piney and some peach and orange hints in there as well. Taste started out with some hops, but it wasn't overdone. Blended in with some orange and peach flavors along with some piney/wood taste. Reminded me a little of Dogfish Head's IPA's. But the wood taste wasn't overdone unlike Dogfish's IPA's.

There are mild buttery spice smells, with a hint of chocolate and coffee, and the roasted malt backbone, but there are also definately hops present, just not so in your face. The taste is nice, with a mix of citrusy tartness, spicy bitterness, and a nice aftertaste of hops. The mouthfeel is very nice. It bites at the back of the tongue in the throat, and the smooth carbonation fills out the feel.

Hops follow rather quickly. Seems like there might be a couple different hops here, but Im not all that proficient at identifying different types. A touch citrusy with grapefruit notes in the end.

Pungent combination of lemon drop like citrus and damp, wilted floral hops dominates the aroma. Ashen bubblegum esters and heaty, bittersweet alcohol are partially tapered by rounding diacetyl. Assertive, but bristly so aromawise. Floral component in hop nose augments as it breathes. Soft pale malt and stately light caramel malt upfront in flavor is quickly overrun by a bluff, lingering melange of sharply bitter citrus pith, peppery alcohol, and raw, honeyish sweetness. Hop flavor of a leafy, sweet fresh tabacco nature creeps in mid palate along with bubblegum and biscuit, further facilitating the abstruse flavor profile. Firmly dextrinous and smoothly viscous in mouthfeel, but not overly so. Finishes alcoholically hot, narrowly bitter, with trace hints of solventy fusels and caramel. A perplexing IPA, for sure. The alcohol presence is not at all hidden, thus hindering the potential drinkability. East IPA's choppy, hop driven complexity challenges, yet pleases the palate.

Aroma: Nice semi mellow floral hopping going down more of a British style but nothing off very nice with sweet malty backbone and citrus scented backdrop a nice solid aroma. Taste: Wonderfully balanced flavors between a great hoppy upfront flavor mellowed by sweet honey like shots of malts including caramel and other English specialties present here, all I can say is it would be hard to find somebody who didn't care for this brew. Mouthfeel: There's a definite silky texture going on within this medium to light bodied beer, not cloying at all great mixture of flavors within this beer. Drinkability: I enjoyed this sampling of it and I must say I will imbibe again maybe not a beer I would buy by the case but surely a great beer to be enjoyed when available refreshing in summer heat and warming in the winter chill.","WVbeergeek","Sep 02, 2003"

3.95,8.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"It poured a golden amber, much like a medium-strength iced tea, with an average head (which was quick to dissolve).

3.58,-1.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Medium dark gold color. Medium head. Aroma is very floral and grassy. A medium bodied IPA. Somewhere between the big hoppy West Coast IPAs and the mellower maltier British IPAs. Definite grapefruit flavor as well as a malty sweetness and hop spiciness. A very drinkable IPA.

3.95,8.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a dark golden color with a nice white head that fades to a pretty lace. The nose is of floral hops and malt complexity. It's a very refreshing smell. The taste is much the same. The hopping is noticable, but not overpowering. The malts stand out and create a unique balance that is not often displayed in most IPA's. The mouthfeel I found to be a bit heavy, but this can be expected with such a malty character. Not something I look for though when I'm throwing back a pale beer. It was a good drinking beer. I've been enjoying this brew for a few years now.","WesWes","Jun 23, 2003"

4.23,16.5,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Great clean finish, not cloying or film leaving, an attribute hard to find in many huge hop IPAs. Had an oily mouthfeel too that wrapped up my tongue and aided the hop flavoring. But, it was almost too oily. Good, different from Stone or Three Floyd style IPAs, and that's not a bad thing. Much easier to drink a couple of these than, say, a HopDevil.","nomad","Jun 19, 2003"

4.05,11.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Copper colored beer with amber highlights, topped by a thin off-white head. It shows a good, hoppy aroma with a touch of malt and fruit sweetness pushing through. The initial taste is all hops up front, but subsequent quaffs reveal more and more of the supporting malt and allow a touch more sweetness to tease the tongue occasionally. It finishes with a bitter kick, and the bitterness lingers pleasantly. A surprisingly creamy mouthfeel with great carbonation that rebuilds the head when swirled. The drinkability is also good. Overall, a surprisingly enjoyable beer.","aaronh","Jun 07, 2003"
4.07,12.1,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Translucent golden-amber hue, smallish thick white head, healthy retention, minimal lace. Inviting nose, prickly citrus hops, leafy, hints of caramel malts. The palate seems to boast an equally malty and bitter taste upfront but as you swallow the bitterness grows, prickly citrus, whisper of pine hoppy goodness! Leafy finish, dry refreshing & appetizing. Medium bodied very interesting mouthfeel, smooth & soothing yet roughly carbonated, a lovely dichotomy. The abv is ideal, hidden in the taste but nowhere else. Tasty! This was a quality beer; try one.","bditty187","May 27, 2003"

3.45,-5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"I am a big fan of IPAs and was not overly impressed by what Brooklyn is offering. They seem to make some great brews, but this was not one of them that had me crying out for more. It poured a relatively light golden color for an IPA, and for maybe ten seconds there was something resembling a head. After that it was like looking at amber water, which in itself was a little disconcerting. The smell was a tad sweet, with some apple flavors and some hops. Upon sipping it felt that the hops flavor tasted artificial. There was not an overly complex body with just a little bit of citrus flavor and some mellowed malts. Overall a decent brew, but like I said if I am looking for a Brooklyn beer I will stick with the Lager or the Pennant Ale.","GreatPondBrewer","May 04, 2003"
3.9,7.4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Dark golden color with a slight lingering head with decent lacing. There is a nice hoppy aroma with hints of pine and citrus. The mouthfeel is a bit tannic at the outset, and the flavor is very strong, but not intensely hoppy. Very well balanced with hops and malts. A nice, full mouthfeel as it finishes, despite a bit of a heavy carbonation. There is also a tangy hoppy aftertaste. Not your typical IPA, but a damn good beer. Love it out of the bottle or out of the tap.","far333","May 04, 2003"
3.09,-14.9,4.5,3,3,3,3,"Another beer from this brewery that is a beauty to behold in the glass, crystaline bronze and glowing. Moderately sweet malt flavors - hops were slightly floral. As an IPA, this beer was a little lackluster in the hops department, and seemed watered-down in the hops flavoring. Taken as a hoppy pale ale, it is quite pleasant.","Brent","May 04, 2003"
3.81,5,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"I had this IPA at the renowned Lazy Boy Saloon, in White Plains, NY. Don't know how this beer is in a bottle, but it was pretty durn good on tap! A lovely copper body, with a creamy tan head that didn't quit, lots of lacy rings on the glass as I sipped. Just like a beer-drinkers version of Victoria's Secret! Not too much aroma, just some dry hoppiness. Taste was just a hint of sweet malt, caramel, with some dry hoppiness troweled on thick over the sweetness. The finish was, once again, DRY HOPS, that came on strong, but fades fast. Quite pleasant, actually. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. My first Brooklyn, and it won't be my last, either!","WaltTrombone","Apr 25, 2003"
3.63,0,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a light copper amber color with a creamy and very sticky white head that fades into a heavy lace. Nose is floral hops and some notes of dried grass. Medium in body with a crisp and drying texture. Lots of raw hop leaf flavor in the taste without being overly bitter balanced by some slightly fruity notes. Finish is very dry with some notes of citrus rind. The 7% abv in this beer is well hidden. Thanks to francisweizen for the sample!","Morris729","Apr 20, 2003"
3.2,-11.8,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"The taste of this IPA is just a bit too over the top on the use of the hops. Though the hops should predominate, the hops here seem to lay over the malt base rather to balance it. There is a strong hop aroma early, but this fades with the moderate goldish tan head. The head fades somewhat quickly but leaves a slight layer that laces. A nice golden amber look that is slightly hazed. A pine and citurs sense in the hops.","AtLagerHeads","Apr 18, 2003"
3.64,0.3,3,4,3.5,3,4,"Pour is a medium clear golden, with a medium white head, diminishing to leave a good lacing. Aroma is a smackdown of hops - lot's of pine, citrus, and floral smells pouring from the glass. Flavor starts lightly sweet with mostly caramel coming through, finishes with a fairly strong hop bitterness. Medium body, medium on the carbonation. A yummy IPA, better than many, but not the best.","goz","Mar 19, 2003"
3.06,-15.7,2.5,4,2.5,3.5,3,"Aroma is buttressed by an underlying caramel malt, with mild citric and floral hop highlights. The appearance is clear copper, with almost no head at all. Flavor starts off malty and finishes with a rather harsh piney, lemony bitter finish. Grape and orange flavors stand out about mid-palate. This is a very acidic beer, probably too much so. Alcohol spiciness contributes to the problem, especially as the beer warms. There's just too many clashing assertive flavors here for an IPA.","mzwolinski","Mar 02, 2003"
4.1,12.9,4,4,4.5,3,4,"I was very happily surprised to find that Brooklyn did the style justice. A very nice hop aroma and a good appearance set the stage. The beer didn't disappoint. Very hoppy and strong, with a solid but not overpowering 7% ABV. Not much to the mouthfeel but nothing really negative either. Goes down well but there is a limit to the number of these you can drink ina session. I would certainly drink again, even though I've had better. Overall, a good but not stellar beer.","porter17","Mar 01, 2003"

The omnipresent yeast makes the flavor fuller with an almost peachy fruitiness, although this wouldn't exactly be called a fruity beer. Nice and easy drinking. The mouthfeel is a bit slick.

On the palate it is citrusy, orange, grapes, slightly stingy mouthfeel, alcohol spiciness, pineapple rind, sharp & sweet bitterness, hints of grapefruit, and a touch of caramel in there also.

3.77,3.9,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nice deep orange color; head was perfectly white and remained a presence (albeit a minimal one) throughout the (short) life of the brew. Major citrusy/floral aromas. Plenty of hops are at the forefront, and are balanced by a nice cut of malt, moreso as the beer warms. Creamy mouthfeel, and a warming effect is evident from the fairly high alcohol content (7.0%, I think). If you're into IPAs I think you'll enjoy this one.","doerickson","Sep 04, 2002"

The aroma offers a nice grassy hop and soft fruitiness alongside some firm, bready and caramel malt notes. The body is medium with a moderate carbonation level, and it's fairly creamy in the mouth. The flavors reflect what the aroma indicates: some very nice hop flavor and gently caramel malt well balanced by an assertive bitterness.

I was not disappointed in any way.  The aroma and head are indicative of a top-notch IPA.  The first sip provided a good hit of the hops that lace this beer throughout.  The hops are not too think or overpowering, which is a great characteristic for this brew.  It is aromatic, with a lacey head leaving its trail on the glass.

The brew is dry and slick on the tongue and very drinkable.  IPAs have to be one of my favorite styles.  While I prefer the more americanized versions the english style of them is very nice as well.
