It has a nice hop flavor focus (herbal, citric and rind) over a mild bitterness in the middle.  Caramel and biscuit sweetness appear in the finish, but are overwhelmed by rind and pine hop flavor.

The aroma is pretty mild, with some light malt aromas (think dried fruit). The taste is alright. There is neither the malt depth of traditional English IPAs or the hops of American IPAs. It's not a bad flavor, but it's not very complicated. The body is lighter, as an English IPA tends toward and it's not bad, but it's not really going to blow you away.","delta490","Jun 26, 2014"

Aromas of floral hops, subtle caramel backbone, light fruit esters, and subtle bitterness. Flavors are bitter forward, with a tart citrus character of tangerine and grapefruit, followed by subtle toasted and caramel notes, and some floral highlights. The body is smooth, with a sharp edge to it. The aftertaste is more floral and sweet than anything, with fruity notes up front. The finish is smooth, somewhat effervesced from the carbonation, and slightly bitter. Very drinkable English IPA.","GarthDanielson","Jun 21, 2014"

It is definitely on the lighter side of IPAs. The IBUs weren't listed on the bottle, but I'd have to guess that it is on the low end when compared to most. That said, it has a bright, almost citrus flavor that I liked. It also had a smooth finish, and was more refreshing than I think many IPAs tend to be. To reiterate, I think it's worth a try, but it won't be what most people expect out of an IPA....","MDM","Apr 14, 2013"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth and went down faster then I expected but not because it was good, but because I wanted to be done with it, the flavors were really bland and could not hold my attention. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was the only part of this beer that was true to style. What I liked least about this beer was pretty much everything else with the taste sticking out as being the worse, it was just way too bland and unappealing for my tastes. I would buy a single of this again if I knew it was fresh but other then that I am not really motivated to revisit this beer anytime soon and I can't say that I would recommend this beer to anyone. Their Oatmeal Porter turned out to be good but this beer was not and was pretty much a let down, I am kind of on the fence with this brewery but I got a few more of their beers to try before I come up with a solid opinion on this brewery. A pretty unimpressive American IPA, I hope their other beers are much beer since this one wasn't good.","StoutHunter","Mar 29, 2012"

Of all the beers I have tried from Highland, this is my least favorite. It is labelled as an IPA, so I am judging it based on that. To me, there are not enough hops in this. When I am opening an IPA, I expect a fair amount of hops. This beer did have a good balance and a nice citrus flavor, but just not what I wanted in an IPA, which I was actually pretty excited about beforehand. I would say overall this beer is about average and would recommend other selections from this brewery before this one.","BeerNoobNC","0"

The aroma shows heavy nougat up front, with toasted caramel and orange/grapefruit hops following suit. I even picked up a bit of chocolate, which seems completely out of place in an IPA. The flavor follows suit almost exactly. Nougat, caramel, biscuit, and citrus hops provide the bulk of the flavor, but that weird chocolate note is still in there. Medium bodied and very easy to drink, despite its weirdness.","ChrisSimpson1968","Aug 27, 2011"

As Highland claims, it's a wee bit different. Put me down as a big fan of the Highland philosophy of brewing. I'm lucky here in Atlanta to find Highland product just about everywhere, at least in the bottle. Finding it on tap is another issue. As it is right now for me financially, that's not a big issue. My beer consumption is mostly limited to buying reasonably priced bottled beer, and very little of that. Highland product is right down my alley.","airheadmtrcycle","Jun 28, 2011"

The taste is similar, fairly weak on the hoppiness for what I would expect from an IPA. It also seems a little empty and watered down. The mouthfeel reflects this as well, but is balanced alright regarding carbonation. Overall an ok IPA, but would call it more a pale ale myself... it's right on the threshold.","csiewert","May 22, 2011"
2.79,-20.7,2.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Color is a clear gold, with very little white head. The scent is some citrus and pine; nice but rather weak. Taste is mostly pine to grass up front, with maybe a bit of grapefruit. A surprising amount of malt flavor comes through in the finish, considering this is an IPA. Probably too malty for the style - this seems almost pilsener-like to me. A slight alcohol taste is noticeable in the aftertaste. Pretty average overall; not an IPA I'd go for again.","DeltaGolfSierra","May 12, 2011"

4,13.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Fairly malt forward brew for an IPA...nice hoppiness, alot of citrus character, carbonation brings about the umphh of the citrus nicely, lots of pine in the aftertaste, leaves a lasting impact on the tongue after each sip, slight floral notes accent the maltiness well. Not as hop crazy as other IPA's I've had, but at the same time it's very well balanced, as seems to be the case with most of highlands beers. Bready malt and slight sweetness with a touch of grain seems to mingle nicely with the hop character of this beer.

It has a solid pale and biscuit malt scent along with nice piney hop aroma. The taste is good as well. It has your basic East IPA flavor; pale and biscuit malt, piney hops. It's smooth and easy drinking with a hint of bready character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty standard IPA. It's balanced and true to style; a fine session ale.","WesWes","Dec 30, 2010"

Big hit of citrus, leaning more towards orange and some lemon zest. Nice hops here, very little malt detectable in the nose. Certainly hop forward in the taste, again significantly citrusy, with orange, lemon zest and some peach in here too. Not a ton of malt here, and feels quite unbalanced. Still quite a bit of bite to this one although it's probably a little past its prime. Good mouthfeel, medium-high carbonation and goes down quite quickly so it gets some points for drinkability.

3.12,-11.4,4.5,2.5,3,3.5,3.5,"The palate is quite a bit better. Very English in interpretation, this has a moderate English base malt character quite prominent. Quite bitter, the hops are a lot more noticeable than on the nose. They've used a blend of English and American hops in this brew, and it shows. A blend of a rather pithy bitterness and plenty of earthy and mildly herbal hops. Drying on the finish, there's a bit of malt character present along with a moderate bitterness. The palate is surprisingly slick and smooth, despite the carbonation. I guess it's all the dextrins in there. Decent stuff, I'm thankful I got a chance to try it. While not the best out there, the interesting hop character makes for a worthwhile drink. At least, it's not another indistinguishable Alpine citrus/ tropical fruit hop bomb.","DefenCorps","Jul 16, 2010"

Hazy chrome orange in appearance, traps the light inside nicely, lighter yellow towards the rims. The nose leans on orange, tangerine citrus, coriander, white pepper before allowing for scone, honeyed bread notes, general maltiness more than distinct scents, maybe cocoa, apricot and peach scents demure, more of a slugger than a puncher. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is very active, stirring things up throughout. Here the clove, coriander spice really takes hold. This pairs well with the orange, white grapefruit citrus, the latter not sweet. No lack of green grass, leafy characteristics. Spicier towards the end, as in peppery bite.

The hop is reasonably present, perhaps more along the line of a pale ale, but it's not particularly appealing in taste. It's a fairly thinnish brew, lightly carbonated and midland drinkable. Not very memorable but passable. Certainly not much of an ipa.","Durge","Dec 22, 2009"

Nose is nice, malts, oats really dominate this at present. I think I've had this for 6 months at least in the fridge; so I'm thinking the hop aroma has probably receded a bit. Taste is another story, lots of bitters noticed up front with a quick wash over the tongue. Mouth is actually a decent balance of malts and hops for an ipa, or a good English style IPA maybe. Body is perfectly carbonated and has a nice texture on the palette, but the flavors are pretty hidden and deep. Finish is almost pale ale like, hops are very mild in this one. Lacing is almost consistent through the entire drink too.","ballewblake","Dec 03, 2009"

Looks about average, nothing incredibly impressive. The smell is very earthy, different that I expected, and there's almost a kind of catty, skunky smell to it. Very low on the citrus effect you expect from an American IPA. I can also detect a moderate amount of resinous hop presence. The taste is a bit toasty and bready upfront, kind of stuck somewhere between dry and sweet. A kind of powerful malt backbone, with a light lemon and orange hop presence. Very low bitterness due to the moderate sweetness, low ester presence, and very low on the resins in the taste. I've had much worse, but there's room for improvement, perhaps a bit more flavor and aroma hops are in order. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but is carried through by the sweetness. The carbonation was kind of low, it started out with a slight prickle, and eventually was left as just a tiny rush of tingling bubbles by the finish. This beer is pretty easy to drink, nothing offensive, no harsh bitterness or odd flavors, but nothing really impressive in the flavor. Worth a shot, but it probably will not be a staple beer.","taylorhamrick","Jun 13, 2009"

There was some hop bitterness, and even the moaning ghost of citrus herbal hop character, but it tasted locked away and submerged beneath the bubbles. A little toasty malt rounds it out, but I'm missing the IPA part here, unless this one has already been on a sailing vessel all the way to India and back to North Carolina (where your not-so-humble hoss sits sipping this). I even smelled my clean shirt I put on a few hours ago after a shower, and it has more going than this beer. Medium body, bitter finish. I can drink this fine, but I wouldn't pay for it.

The smell is of toasty, biscuit like and staw like with an interplay of citrus and spicy hops. The taste is up front with the hops as would be expected, but the malt characteristics also have a significant role here. This is certainly not quite as assertive of an IPA in the flavor department as would be desired for an American IPA. The mouthfeel is dry and appropriately medium bodied. Overall, a good IPA.

Aromatics are muted here much more so than the dry hopped pale ale, some citrus and floral hop nose but not that impressive. Some fruity notes with a touch of alcohol make their presence known as well. Flavor is pretty much grapefruit pith and floral perfume tones an astringent bitterness lacquers the palate from the first sip to the finish a touch of balancing malt sugars provide enough sweetness to make this tolerable but this brew comes off one dimensional same flavor aspect working over and over again. Mouthfeel is oily carbonatin is sturdy and tickles the back of the throat definitely medium bodied some protein filled thickness is definitely welcomed in the texture. Drinkability is so so I'm not a fan of the one dimensional hop bitterness IPA that lacks in hop flavor, I'm a hophead but I like to see balance and harmony in the combonation of malts marrying hops that doesn't go down here.","WVbeergeek","Aug 28, 2007"

Nice two inch head slowly faded away to just a layer of lace on the top. Decent side lace on the glass as well, looks like a good IPA. Smell was very sweet and hoppy Lots of orange and tangerine, but a definate malty back was apparent and was obviously present. The taste is great, a nice light hoppy IPA. A touch sticky with a good bitter dry aftertaste. First flavors that come through are nice fresh citrus followed by a touch of sugar and a yeasty bread flavor that is lingering around in the back. Very well balanced. A nice smooth drink, good carbonation and easy drinker. This is a definate classic session IPA. I could really drink this all night long. One of my favorite local IPA's and a good representation of the quality brewing going on around here. If you gcan get it, go for its a definate winner.

I enjoy the taste of this beer. Crisp, fresh hops and a tiny malt backbone. More on the hop side but they aren't overpowering or intense by any means. Soft and delicate with a light biscuit essence underneath. Mouthfeel is a little light but quite refreshing and the carbonation is damn near perfect. Less bitterness than your typical. Drinkability is great and this one goes down as an excellent session IPA. Lower ABV and pretty good stats in other areas. Affordable, tasty, and quite drinkable.

This one finishes with an unpleasant blast of bitterness, faintly piney but mostly just bitter. I wish the hops had more of a presence up front and that it had more of the desirable bitter citrus or pine to it but it just finishes harsh. This one is really hard to get a handle on, my first impression was to lightly hopped to be an IPA and really more of a pale ale (and actually a nice one on first impression) but.... then the finish hits you with the blast.

Solid malt body throughout, but the finish is short and to the point and filled with more of those rind notes that do not linger. There is perhaps a touch of pine and grapefruit, but the hop profile is not overly aggressive, and seems to be missing its snap.

3.37,-4.3,3.5,4,3,4,3,"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a medium orange color with half a finger of head that dies off quickly. There is minimal lacing on the glass. The smell is fruity, with a good amount of citrusy hops. Lots of pineapple in there, with orange, and even some floral notes. The taste has lots of hop bitterness going on. It's juicy hop flavor at first, but gets a little bit on the harsh bitterness side on the finish. I seem to be detecting a bit of diacetyl in there as well. The mouthfeel is decently thick and heavy. The drinkability is just ok, due to the harshness and diacetyl. It's ok.","SheepNutz","Beers"
3.65,3.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 oz bottle, 6 oz pour. Beer is a light orange color with a light head that sits as a floating island over the brew. Clarity is moderate and only a small stream of bubbles is apparent. Nose is moderately caramel, lightly bready, and a little earthy. No real bright citrusy hop is hitting me, which I would like to find in my IPA. Flavor is representative of the nose. Caramel, earthy hoppy flavors, light breadyness. It finishes with a mild citrusy hop flavor and a moderate peppery bitterness that hangs on nicely after swallowing the brew. Not bad. Feel is moderate with a moderte carbonation that breaks things up nicely, keeping it from being too heavy. Overall, this brew is not giving me what I want from my IPA's, but its not bad. I'd like to see what this one is like fresh and on draft. I have a feeling that there is more brilliance to be found in this one. I'd like to have it again.","kmpitz2","0"

Malt comes through more than expected. Spicy bite from the hops with a bitter finish. Enjoying the sweet malt and zesty citrus combo. Mouthfeel is very good...medium body that's a tad slick from the hop oils and good carbonation. I could see my self having a few of these on a lazy afternoon.","Imstillthegman","Mar 20, 2006"

I can definately detect the spicy English hops and at the same time the Mt. Hood's pull through with their pine aroma. The flavor is about the same. A well balanced hoppy brew. The hops are a tasty mix of English raw leafiness and Mt. Hood sharpness. A sweet malt and light toasted grain balance out the hops. The drinkability is dangerous. Pint after pint can be consumed if you don't have anything to do the next day. I think my taste have matured since the last time I tried this beer. I love it!","Luigi","Feb 24, 2006"

As much as I was recently disappointed by the ""Über Pils"" from Clipper City (another excellent regional brewer) if it had tasted like this I would have been overjoyed. This is not your typical pine-n-citrus American IPA but it is an excellent showcase for bold hop flavoring. Also *again* proof that a big, flavorful beer doesn't have to be high in alchohol; this one's only 5.6% but you'd never know it from the taste.","RedwoodGeorge","Feb 19, 2006"
3.79,7.7,2.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This beer poured differently than i expected. It was a very light yellow color, only slightly darker than a macro brew beer. The head was very thin white color, and had a slight lacing around the glass. It had a mild hopy smell, much less strong than my normal perception of an IPA. It was mild for an IPA overall, and lad a nice hopy finishes with a bitter after taste. I am not normally a huge fan of an IPA, but this reminded me of a pale ale more than an IPA, and that is probably why I enjoyed this so much....It really makes me want to try their pale. If you are not a huge fan of IPA's this might be the first step to enjoying them....if you like sierra nevada, or highly hoped pale ales give this a try.","jameaterblues","Jan 12, 2006"

3.68,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" white head above the dark straw brew. Head is foamy and lasting, with average to good lacing. Aroma is lightly of pale malts, with some hops input, but not as much as I would hope for. Taste starts with some pale malts as well, which are quickly overpowered by hops bitterness. The hops character in the flavor is somewhat generic, but tending towards pine, and not so much the fruity. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, making the bitterness more palatable, and as such, drinkability is good as well. Reasonably standard American IPA, for better or worse.","ppoitras","Jul 15, 2005"

3.65,3.7,3,3,4,3.5,4,"This is a quite confusing beer. An IPA? really? It pours a pale straw yellow color with a pearl white head that leaves spidery lacing down the glass. The smell is pure pilsner, a spicy saaz hops smell with a bready malt background. From the looks and smell it could only be a pilsner. The taste is somewhat like a pilsner...starts with a bread-like biscuity malt and leads into a hoppy, spicy and slightly bitter taste and finishes dry, bitter and crisp. I can hardly believe this is an ale, much less an IPA. It's hoppy but this is definately a pilsner style beer. If it were labeled a ""pilsner"" or even a ""lager"" i would consider this a quality brew, even great but this appears to be the victim of sever mislabeling. Not bad by any stretch but most definaetly not an IPA, so be forwarned...a nice, complex hoppy brew but not really an IPA.","silver0rlead","Mar 31, 2005"

3.74,6.3,3,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a very pale golden color with a weak head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are a mix of earthy and resinous hops that almost give off a vegetal note to it. Flavors are an intermingling of citrus and spicy hop flavors. There is a slight backing of malts that give off a slight caramel flavor but for the most part they do not make themselves present. The finish is slightly bitter but follows along the citric hop flavor. Overall this is a fairly simple IPA but a quenching one at that.","bigbeerdrinka","Nov 22, 2004"

A good crisp flowery hops nose greets the senses, with a touch of citrus in the background. Yup, and pine, too. Very prickly, somewhat sticky mouth. In the opening, smooth, sweet malt blends well with a lot of flowery, piney hops. A slight espresso bitter emerges in the finish, while a dry bite charachterizes the aftertaste.

The aroma of hops, sweet malt and a lime like crispness greet the nose with the start sweet and rich in malt, top is middling in its feel to the palate.

The head was about an inch thick, and creamy, and hung around for a bit, leaving good lacing as the beer went down. Carbonation was medium to low. The aroma was subdued for the style, with very little aggressive hop character in the nose. The taste was bright, with typical citric-piney American hop profile with sweetish caramel malt giving a chewy toffee taste. The hops were a bit peppery in the mid palate. The aftertaste was chalky-dry with a creamy mouthfeel. A good, middle of the road IPA which is a recent arrival in the Jax in Cumming.

3.67,4.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pouring produces a bright white head, but the light colour of the beer was a bit surprising. The aroma contains a mixture of malty sweetness and fresh (green) hoppiness. Caramel malt predominates at first with little hop flavour coming through, but this leads to a light bitterness that lingers on the palate. The malt character of the beer is a little too strong for the style, but it's still a well-crafted pale ale with more flavour and body than expected in such a light coloured beer.","DrJay","Apr 06, 2004"

I really liked the change in taste that it did. First it was a smooth, clean, kind of hoppy taste. Then it bursts out into a hop/peppery rush. I guess that is what I liked about it, the multi-leveled tastes. If I can like it, then I am sure that a hophead would love it.

Its slightly hazy (bottle-conditioned) golden body is capped by a thin head of creamy bright-white foam that holds well, maintains a solid surface covering, and leaves some spotty lace about the glass. The nose is bright and fresh with floral & grassy hops over a sweetish, bready malt. The body is medium with a very fine and gently crisp carbonation that's lightly crisp across the palate. The flavor offers a solid one-two punch of floral and grassy hops over sweet malt that's well backed by bold bitterness.
