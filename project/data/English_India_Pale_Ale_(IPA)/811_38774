4.23,8.2,4,4,4.5,4.25,4,"Very clear amber body was topped by a one finger thick head, and had lots of carbonation streamers running through it. The smell of the beer was a little muted for the style, and I could detect mango, pineapple, hay, grapefruit, and some spice. The taste was nicely balanced between bitter and sweet, with none overpowering the other. There were some tropical fruit flavors, and a lingering spiciness, but the overall flavor profile was simple and bold. The feel was sticky, and mouth coating, and the finish dry. An unassuming DIPA with decidedly English take.","rajendra82","Jul 09, 2013"

Smooth, balanced, nuanced...this beer is an example of brewing excellence. The hops in this beer are all high-palate hops and I can recognize the ""3 C's"": Cascade, Chinook, Columbus. No funky, chunky or skunky hops in this baby. I have had other Highland Brewing beers and this bad mamma jamma is the Emperor of the bunch.

4.27,9.2,4,4.5,4.25,4,4.25,"A good amount of larger to moderately sized bubbles gives the head an irregular surface, little under two fingers high, clean white in color, thick sheets of lacing with excellent stickiness. Mild orange amber in color, not really golden, not especially clear and curious absence of any visible bubbles. The nose is extremely sweet with coconut custard, juicy pink grapefruit, molasses, flowers and apricot, peach fruit, balances this out with pepper and cut grass notes and lighter metallic earthiness, strong nostril presence with lots of length and staying power. Full-bodied, creamier and more carbonated than expected based on visual inspection, almost heavy at times. Here too it emphasizes its sweetness with pink and white grapefruit, mandarin orange citrus and pine sap in addition to pineapple, nectarine, apricot fruit. The florality gets lost in the mix. Maple syrup, molasses and brown sugar keep the love fest going but, at the same time, there a hardness to the finish, pepper, baked bread crusts, meadow grasses to green straw. It is boozy for sure and its syrupy texture keeps it adhered to your mouth pores long after you have swallowed it down. Likely over the top for many but if you enjoy the full metal jacket approach now and then this may be up your alley.","farrago","May 27, 2013"

Nose and flavor are of sweet caramelized malts, a nice dose of citrus such as grapefruit and lemon, medium toasted bread, earthy, bitter fruits, still quite a bit of alcohol lingering about.

Great balance. From start to finish it walked a fine line between bitterness, citrusy hops, caramel, and alcohol. Sweetness was a combination of fruity and sugary, well short of cloying.

4.2,7.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability - Damn good! Reminded me more of a barley wine, but was highly enjoyable never the less.","DavidEddie","Jan 31, 2008"
3.73,-4.6,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"OK but really tastes more like a Barley Wine. Malt is stronger than the hops here and leaves me want tropical fruit flavor in my glass. OK I guess.","Zorro","Jan 29, 2008"
3.53,-9.7,4.5,4,3,4,3.5,"Edit: Lowered taste to 3.0 - the flavors just do not come together or work well here after having finished about 12 ounces of it.","rallison","Jan 20, 2008"
4.1,4.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a cloudy golden hued caramel amber color with a full finger eggshell colored loose foamy head that fades to surface. Leaves a spotty lacing pattern in trail. The smell is really interesting. If i didn't know better i'd think that i was smelling a barleywine. A strong rich caramel malt dominates a bright floral note. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is heavy, creamy and sweet. Full flavored, the rich caramel malt dominates the taste. A complex blend of unbalanced maltiness over a fruity hop character that really keeps things interesting. Having a ton of fun with this one; it really caught me by surprise. Appreciate the opportunity to sample it thanks to drunkmonk.","jjayjaye","Jan 19, 2008"
4.15,6.1,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"D: This is a sure sipper. One does not rush through 22 oz of 10.2% beer. I expect this will last through at least the first half of the game (AFC champ) today.","ewright","Jan 17, 2008"
4.38,12,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Numbing, herbal, piny hop bitterness right off the bat. Sugary butterscotch and caramel malts fight back. Boozy-sweet fruits round out the palate. Herbal hop bitterness picks up again in the finish. Traces of butterscotch and pineapple in the end. Full-bodied with a smooth creamy mouthfeel. Not too hot, but 22 oz. easily warmed me up on this cold night in Michigan!","alexgash","Jan 16, 2008"
4.35,11.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" beige over the slightly cloudy orangey amber brew. Dense head holds steady, with sporadic lacing. Aroma is piercing fruity pine hops. Taste is sweet maltiness upfront, tart citrus in the middle, and closes with a plethora of pine. Alcohol and warming form an afterglow. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good for the style.","ppoitras","Jan 13, 2008"
3.61,-7.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I had very high hopes for Imperial Kashmir IPA. It turns out that it's my least favorite beer from what I think is North Carolina's best brewery. I don't really care if this 'Limited Edition 2007' offering sees the light of day in 2008 and beyond unless Highland does some major tinkering. Thanks Loki.","BuckeyeNation","Jan 08, 2008"

3.6,-7.9,4,4,3.5,4,3,"The flavor is significantly bolder, but I prefer the aroma more at this point. Its hoppy, its strong, its got a good solid bitterness, and its different. Not anything like your atypical West-coast variety, this is more green, earthy, and minty. An interesting beer but probably a little young to be really good when I cracked this bottle 2 or 3 months after its release.","wedge","Beers"
4.32,10.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Man it kicks ass to find this brew up here in western NY,poured from the bottle a deep slight hazed burnt orange with a tight formed 1 1/2 finger white head.Deep piney aromas in the nose with some grapefruit rind and caramel sweetness.Resiny flavors really hit up front like that of leather and pine with underlying grapefruit rind and a hefty caramel base.I have drank alot of Highland brews in the past but this takes the cake it kicks major arss.","oberon","0"

4.3,10,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice hazy dark golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is mostly hops, with a very nice touch of malts, not much pines, but some citrus, and the usual caramel. The taste is sweet at first, then some nice hoppyness, and then some malts, and some slight citrus. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very nice DIPA, would recommend.","Wasatch","Dec 05, 2007"

3.7,-5.4,4,4,4,3,3,"22 oz bottle split between three people. Color was ruddy orange with a good soapy head. The smell was intense hops but not pine or citrus. the taste was very hoppy with some tropical fruit flavors but not quite a West Coast. The only complaint I had with this beer was the astringency on my tongue. it got worse as I got to the bottom of my glass. Still, nice to be able to try this one.","ArrogantB","Nov 21, 2007"

3.93,0.5,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"The dominating flavor here is cereal-rich malts mixed with floral hops and fresh cut grass. It's certainly original as far as IIPA's are concerned. Some type of barley/organic greeneries are present too...a bit hard to place exactly where I've tasted it before, but it's familiar. The body is of medium-high thickness, and quite viscous across the palate. Well carbonated, too, and the warming note from the alcohol is an added plus. Drinkability is a bit limited...this is a thick, heavy double IPA. I'd be in real trouble trying to finish an entire bomber by myself...thankfully, trep was around to help me out.","wagenvolks","Nov 10, 2007"

4.62,18.2,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Best beer I've had from Highland.Nice to see them stretch their legs a bit with this. I'm only sorry its a one-off. I bought my bottles directly from the brewery on their release day. Pours a dark orange/amber with a decent head and some lacing. Not bad given the abv- this is a big beer. The smell is sweet, spicy, and quite hoppy with a nice range of hop aromas- piney, citrusy, and earthy. Very well balanced, and quite obviously lots of malt and hops. Extreme all around. The taste is heavenly. Beautifully balanced hop and malts. Quite a bit of hop bitterness that grows as you drink. Similar hop profile to the nose, with the finish especially earthy. Mouthfeel is substantial, with lots of hop oils and a creamy finish. Absolutely delicious and best fresh.","Georgiabeer","Oct 21, 2007"
3.38,-13.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nicely spicy and bitter finish. Alcohol is well hidden. A bit too 'balanced' for my taste.","MrBendo","Oct 21, 2007"
4.92,25.8,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Many thanks go out to my Aunt Marsha of Black Mountain for making a stop at Bruisin' Ales to score me a few bottles. Poured into a Duvel snifter a deep amber that was very thick and somewhat opaque. The frothy head slowly diminished to a thin layer and left decent lacing on the glass. Aroma was abundant earthy pine hops and burnt caramel. The taste was a wonderful balance of pine hops with a hint of citrus mixing wonderfully with deep caramel malts and a hint of brown sugar. The beer is certainly on the heavy side with some sticky alcohol, but even so, it is still very refreshing and not at all overbearing. I am willing to go so far as to rank this right up there with Dreadnaught and Ruination as one of my new favorite DIPAs, here's to hoping they decide to drop the limited status, or at least up the hops and alcohol a little on their Kashmir IPA as this one only proves that's what that beer needs.","atsprings","Oct 20, 2007"

3.7,-5.4,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a dark rich copper with a somewhat foggy look that has a big chunky two finger off-white head that slowly dies down to a nice layer that remains throughout. Smell is a light floral perfume like aroma with a bit of pink grapefruit in the nose as well. Minor caramel malt with a bit of dirty earth scent too. Taste is a syrupy pine hop flavor with a big caramel malt presence. Some earth hop flavors with a drying effect as well. Some dry wheat flavors seem to appear in the aftertaste that is a mix of dry hops and brown sugar. Thick almost full body with a tingle of carbonation. Some decent drinkability but it's big mouthfeel hurts it a bit. Solid DIPA, but there are many out there that surpass it.","BeerTruth","Oct 15, 2007"
4.69,19.9,4,5,5,4.5,4,"Bottle to snifter yields a light, ruby body with mild carbonation and leaves light seafoam retention that returns back into the body rather quickly. The smell is powerful in strength but light in substance with floral hops that are exceptionally sweet and oily. The smell is light with pine and grapefruit and then a nice sugary sweetness. The taste is also delightful with a syrupy sweetness and light floral complexities. Quite complex yet not overly bitter like its peers of the style. The 10.2% ETOH is magically hidden, nowhere to be found in the taste but it has a pleasant warming feeling on the body and tongue. A well-balanced oily mouthfeel and lightness makes this incredibly drinkable although the alcohol will catch up with you quickly. The only downfall of this beer is its incredibly limited availability. This one is a privilege to sample.","Neehan","Beers"
4.49,14.8,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Single bottle from Bruisin' Ales. I've got three more bottles picked up at the brewery this past weekend; only one is for myself, and it's gonna be hard to send the other two away.","blackie","0"
4.18,6.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"With great appreciation to Mike from Cole's for sharing his bomber. Soapy head. Yeast and complex meld of five hops, including dry hops. this is not a hop bombing DIPA.

4.08,4.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Drinkability: Quite nice. I look forward to seeing how this one ages and whether or not Highland will continue this trend of releasing an imperialized version of their current beer line. An Imperial Black Mocha Stout might be nice.","ChainGangGuy","Sep 25, 2007"

4.7,20.2,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"As the beer warms up the malt backbone starts to balance the mix and makes a big silky mouthfeel on the finish. Nobody list the ibu on the bottle but if I had to quess it would be 112 ibu ? Great to see this brewery flex some muscle!","athensbeermaster","Sep 23, 2007"
3.85,-1.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured a nice reddish orange with a fair head. The beer is clear with no cloudiness or suspended matter. The smell is bitter piney hops. Also some fruitiness as well. The taste is hoppy as one can imagine with the label stating 200 pounds of hops in 50 barrels. The abv is evident here as well. This is an aggresive beer that likes to show it's teeth. The mouthfeel is smooth with a abv bite in the aftertaste. Drinkability is fair but I think this brew could use a little shelf time to allow it to lay down a bit.","Enola","Sep 23, 2007"
