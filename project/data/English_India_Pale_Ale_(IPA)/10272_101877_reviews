"Nice smell,  toasty taste, not so bitter, a little sweet."
""
"Pours crystal clear pale gold producing 2 fingers of frothy, white, shortlived head that leaves webby lacing. Aroma is citrus, honey, oaky vanilla & thin caramel, the hops are restrained for an IPA. Taste is sweet fronted but quickly gives way to balance with the wood & hops & then a bittersweet finish that becomes mostly a bitter-oaky aftertaste. Citrus & floral/herbal hops, boozy alcohol, vanilla, sugar & just a hint of butterscotch. Alcohol is prominent for a brew of this ABV. Mouthfeel is moderate-heavy bodied, low-medium carbonation, tongue coating thickness, oily. This puts me more in mind of an ESB instead of an IPA."

"Hazy bright orange. Fruity and woody smell and taste. Too sweet and very low bitterness for an IPA."

"I liked this one.  I got mine at Jungle Jim's near Cincinnati.  It came in a bottled 4 pack...none on tap anywhere in the area I could find.  It has a clear bright golden to orange color, no haze at all.  The aroma was very hoppy and pleasant to me...though it has that strong green onion-grassy smell that some European beers have ( sorry...that is the only way I can think to describe it ) to it that some might call skunky...which surprised me.  I repeat i found it pleasant and pretty complex. You can also discover the woody notes. The mouthfeel was a little lighter than I expected.  The head was a bright white that started strong and dropped away after a minute or so to a thin lacing.  It was not as hoppy on the tongue as most IPA's.  I will buy again...."

"I agree with mister_moose post exactly.. Very drinkable, strong notes of buttery caramel with secondary notes of a golden rum and a light oak. Not for hop heads but refreshing for its style"
"Being a hop head of some degree, IPA is a bit of a misnomer on this beer.  Even the more reserved British style IPA doesn't accurately reflect this beer.  It's very soft on the palate, strong notes of buttery caramel with secondary notes of a golden rum and light oak.  It slides down without a bitter finish and leaves you asking for more.  There are only 2 beers I go outside domestic production for, Innis and Gunn, and Sam Smith.  Unique, well crafted, and apparently under rated.  Don't let the pedestrian score deceive you, go get some."

"Sour lemon cough drop; drain pour."

"very very light... Not much to this beer at all.  The idea of a toasted Oak IPA intrigued me"

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 14A. English IPA). Bottle 33 cl - Batch L4148 19:50. AROMA: medium-low hop aromas of floral and citrusy character. mild sweet malt background and some wood barrel. APPEARANCE: pale golden color and translucent. Thin white head with poor retention. TASTE: mild floral hop flavours with a very faint malty background. background shows a mild oak barrel flavour. medium-high bitterness that lingers into a almost dry aftertaste. PALATE: medium-light body with medium carbonation. OVERALL: a supposed barrel aged IPA that needs more assertive ""aged"" notes."
"Things have been slipping lately between I/G and myself, but we're gonna keep trying to make things work, continuing the process here.  This stuff pours a clear brass topped by a finger of dirty white foam.  The nose comprises mild balsa and very light grass.  The taste holds notes of flowers, vague young wood, and vague stonefruit.  The body is a light medium, with a rather light moderate carbonation and a dry finish.  Overall, this beer didn't do it for me.  Maybe it was the oak-aging, maybe it was a weak base to begin with; whatever the case, I/G just haven't been getting it done for a while now.  Shame, really."

"Not particularly impressed, if it is retired, I understand.  When the appearance is the best part of the beer, one might as well be drinking something less expensive.  Hop flavor does not meet expectations set by label, wood but little flavor compared to many oak aged beers that impart a greater taste.  Nicely carbonated and mouthfeel to match."

"Original English IPA. Reminds me of lumber yard, mill, wood shop, sawdust."
""
"Overall – This one is very good. Over all it has great hop flavour from the triple hopping method of the brewing process with some very fine malts underpinning the whole experience. All in all a wonderful beer I am sad to say is now retired. At least I got to try it once. And here is hoping I come across a rogue bottle or two in the near future before they are all snapped up."

"A nice take on the English IPA."
"Quote from the back of the bottle ""This IPA's intense hop character............add hops 3 times during brewing...", Not even close, this was a sweet, woody mess, no hops, flat citrus and should be ashamed to call itself an IPA, no matter where it is made.."

"Warming, spicy, bit average and indistinct. Where's the toasted oak?."
"330 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 4/2015. Pours slightly hazy deep golden color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange peel, pine, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, toffee, toasted oak, light vanilla, and herbal/oak earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of pale malt, earthy hops, and oak notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange peel, light pine, toffee, cracker, bread, vanilla, toasted oak, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal/oak earthiness. Light herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange peel, light pine, toffee, cracker, bread, toasted oak, vanilla, herbal, floral, grass, and herbal earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and oak flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice and pleasant oak aged English IPA. All around good complexity and robustness of pale malt, earthy hops, and oak flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Could have been drinking bud light"
"Overall – A decent IPA with a bit of an oaky flavor, but overall nothing all that exceptional."
""
"O: Overall it is fairly tasty, decent hop flavor, but I wish there was a little more oak to it.  I think it would do well from a cask."

"An IPA with no detectable hops.  OK.  At least it’s in a brown bottle instead of the usual clear."
""
""
"Ditto for the booze - which was light in amount and even harder to feel as I worked my way through this. I love most of what Innis and Gunn has put out, since I like Whiskey and Bourbon when the winter months roll around. It's nice to see them break out of that mold but this needed a bit more work to make it a truly enjoyable beer. True to form but not as tasty or memorable as the leaders in this category. Worth a shot once for anyone who loves what these guys do and wants to see what else they're capable of brewing."

"Overall -  Pretty much what you'd expect from I&G if they were to do an EIPA, but nonetheless it is quite tasty and is one of their most distinctive beers that I've had the pleasure of enjoying."

"Final Grade: 3.89, a solid B+. Innis & Gunn's Toasted Oak IPA may not have what it takes to satisfy fans of the American style, but it's still a great English-style IPA that I would absolutely pick up again. I'm not as high on this brewery as I was when I first discovered them, but it's good to see that they can still kick out more-than-just-serviceable products once in a while. Good sampler, with this beer probably being the highlight of it; pick it up if you spot it in Ontario."
"The taste has a fascinating array of flavors including some toasted malt, zesty citrus, grass, and vanilla. There is a kind of musty cellar bite to it too."

"Overall its a pretty great beer above average and definitely one of their better tries at an oak aged beer. Worth picking up for $2.50."
""
"Overall: It was hard to distinguished this oaken EIPA. Decent, but I wish I could try the non oaked version."
""
""

"o: A very nice summer ale, enough fruit to lend flavor without overpowering the malt. Did not get even a hint of the ""Toasted Oak"" though, despite the fact this is supposed to be oak aged. Still, this would hold its own with almost any American ""Summer Ale"" or light, low-hopped pale ale. Easy drinking and refreshing, and at 5.6% definitey sessionable and one of the lowest ABV I&Gs. However, at $2+ per serving there are a few comparable, American-made summer ales out there at a better price."
"The only real downside to beer is that it is a bit easy. Perhaps it would have had a higher alcohol percentage, but at the same time it will do with 5.6% pretty good."
"Overall I thought was nice beer, but I didn't think it was the best example of a oak aged IPA, the toasted oak showed up nicely and it ended up imparting some really nice flavors to this beer, but the IPA base was lacking and it ended up tasting more like a Regular Innis & Gunn beer with some orange peels thrown into the mix and I ended up missing those hoppy and bitter flavors. This beer had decent drinkability, it was smooth, a little complex, a little creamy, fairly crisp, not too filling and the taste did a decent job at holding my attention and I think I could drink a couple, but after that I'm pretty sure the lack of hops would start to wear on me. What I like the most about this beer was the toasted oak aspect, I thought it was really nice and it worked well with this beer and the mouthfeel was also good. What I liked the least about this beer was the hop profile, the orange rind flavors tasted like they were actually from oranges and they didn't taste like they came from hops and I didn't really get any other hoppy flavors. I might buy this beer again and I wouldn't turn one down, but it isn't too hard to find a Oaked IPA that still has some hoppyness to it and I think it's worth a try, but I can't say it will be an instant favorite. All in all I was a little disappointed in this beer, I still liked it, but it didn't deliver the hop flavors and aromas that I was hoping for and that left me wanting more out of this beer. It isn't my favorite Oaked IPA or my favorite Innis & Gunn beer, but it isn't bad. I appreciate the effort, but this one could use just a little bit of work, better luck next time guys."

"Well, they got me here - I would be hard-pressed to identify this as an Innis & Gunn product, given the lack of that overly sweet caramel maltiness and egregious oakiness that seems to be the house style. With this one, the hop bitterness is definitely the star, albeit in an old-world, English manner, which is a-ok. The toasted wood is understated to say the least, which is another plus. Worth seeking out to prove that tigers can indeed change their spots."

"Carbonation is too aggressive."
""
""
""
"Overall Even though its aged 41 days prior, and it may not be a typical IPA , Its very enjoyable. If it was just a few dollars cheaper on the four pack I would buy this again."
"Sessionable, sans the imposing flowery flavors. No noted strength. On the lighter side of medium, for body and carbonation."
"Innis and gunn are probably my favorite brewery from my home city."
""
""
"Here is a pleasing effort which harmonizes oak and IPA. It's not a top pick, but certainly different to warrant a pickup."

"Innis and Gunn is a great brewery that I constantly come back to. This one is new to CT so I thought I would try it. I was happy to see that they are using colored bottles instead of clear glass which doesn't eliminate any sunlight. The appearance was a nice dark yellow with a lot of wood on the nose. The taste was a bit shocking to be honest. There was little to no hops in it and was mostly the toasty flavor of the oak. But the flavor was really good. On the end of the taste you get a bit of a floral bite that gives a nice finish. I loved it. Also I liked the moutfeel as well as it was medium thick which complemented the mellow flavor. I would highly recommend."
"Overall not very good, I could see IPA as it's more original U.K. style IPA like, but hops are quite bleh, not the kind I like at all, and the wood is a little tannic and not so tasty, and even the malts are like raw molasses and also not so tasty. Nothing really much about this beer I like. They always seem to have interesting ideas and concepts, but either just use the wrong ingredients, or fail to deliver on it."

"Pale copper completely filtered sad looking IPA actually, fine speckled bright white head speckled even lacing. Aroma hints of oak barrel aging, a bit of booze, charred oak, and fruit character going on. Flavors are bland watery bitterness with the oak barrel notes giving me hints of dirty socks aged on hop water and oak chips, it's just a sad experience overall. On the plus side I was excited to see this beer in a brown bottle, but the flavor is terrible I literally can't finish it there are no redeeming qualities to give the beer credit for a watery cluster of muddled hops and oak chips and faint booziness. Mouthfeel is thin higher than normal carbonation, the hops here may ruin someone who could potentially become a hophead. Overall, I'm pretty much done getting burnt by Innis & Gunn, pretty much mediocre to terrible across the board."

"O: definitely recommended for fans of British/English/Scottish ales and IPAs. Classic flavors and feel; nice toasty aromas. Non-fans have no cause to steer away either - a very nice and approachable ""English""-style IPA."

"Notes: Dated Feb 15"
"Hmmmm - not much of an IPA. Looks OK, while the aroma and flavour are dominated by oak and harsh leaves. Aside from a degree of bitterness the hops are well hidden. Unimpressive body. Doesn't live up to its promises - there's too much oak and not enough hops. An interesting idea but poorly executed; no need to seek this one out."
""
"A nice beer without really standing out on its own right. The taste was a solid one but the balance let the beer down some with the bitterness and floral/citrus sharpness fighting it out and not really complimenting each other all that well."
""
""
"For once a beer from these guys in a brown bottle and it pours a clear golden hue with sudsy two finger head and lacing here and there,the smell is wow it's lemon and lime with mandarin and if u really have a good smell hiding is some oak and funk,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and the tastes are all about the hops with lemon,lime,sherbet,mandarins,a touch of caramel malts and finished with a warming oakiness with the bitterness there but a touch subdued from the oak ageing and overall it's quite a sessionable little drop and yeah I'd drink it again cheers."
