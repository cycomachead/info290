"Overall, this has tons of flavor for a 4.4% beer... English IPAs are not everyone's ""cup of tea", but this one is an authentic must-try from Scotland to help understand them."

"This develops interesting, wasn't thrilling initially, but afterwards it has much more richness and more complexity going on. Really nice to drink though, good session ale. A nice example of an english IPA that has some cool things going on."

"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of earthy malt, slight sweet malt, hint of yeast, and citrus hops. Fits the style of an English IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with low carbonation. Tastes of earthy malt, slight pale malt, hint of sweet malt, and citrus hops. Overall, good appearance, feel, and blend."
"Drinkability isn't too high for me with the aftertaste. A below average English IPA."
""

"The taste also had a hop front, side and back: not overly so, but it just seems right. A lovely couple of pints and although I've not rated/reviewed this in cask form before it is in fact a beer I often drink when in the UK, be it in England or Scotland."
""
"While I am a certified American Hop head and love the likes of Sculpin, Pliny and the American hop bombs, it was a real treat to try an English IPA as it was meant to taste. Just fantastic."
""
""
"Edinburgh. But I must admit I find the americas ipas much better. I probably will buy it again though as it is very reasonably priced compared to lower quality beers in Edinburgh and easily available."

"D - Drinkable session IPA with very little alcohol volume. Not my favorite but drinkable."
""
"A decent pale ale - it goes down easily and I rather like it. Not an IPA in the modern sense; the hops are very restrained. The aroma could be more distinctive, but the flavour is nice and distinctly yeasty. It's better on cask than from the bottle, but worth trying if you get the chance."
""
""
"I have a couple of bottles and they are alright, not quite as bright as the cask."
"Before I knew the style, I wrote ""this beer seems to be a British Bitter"". It is NOT an IPA. The hop is far too muted to qualify and the advertised abv of 3.8% is far too low. Still, I would say it is a good bitter--full bodied with a low carbonation."
"I like it and should probably rate it higher but I remember what it once was and it seems to have lost those IPA qualities.. Just re-insert all that stuffing and we'd be back in action."
"The beer is everywhere (in Scotland), but anyway, a pleasant and drinkable one."
"Dr: IPA fanatics might love it, but the mouthfeel brings this beer down severely. Doesn't hide its abv (which is quite modest in fairness) well at all. Not a good session beer. Move right past this one, lads, and grab something more worthwhile."
"Very drinkable and not too heavy. Not my usual style of drink but very much one I would buy again although it wasn't as good as the bottled version."
"Pint from ""spoons"" Copper colour,clear, no bubbles. It had a small head. Could detect a faint hoppy fruity smell. Tasted like slightly off pears and apples. Lots of hops. Quite bitter. Not much fiz. Decent IPA but i've had better. Could be one to session"
"Definitely something to try if you like Sierra Nevada or Rogue Dead Guy Pale Ale. It is very smooth and flavorful. I am unsure where this is sold (or if it is) in the USA. This bottle was brought to me from Edinburgh, Scotland."
"On-tap at the Duke of Kent in Toronto. Poured a golden colour with thin white head. Good head retention down the glass with some lacing. Lots of bready malt in the smell with some herbal/floral hops. Taste has mild bitterness with lots of the bready sweet malt. Carbonation level was nice. Easy to finish off the pint of this. I preferred this on cask in England, but still a nice find on tap in Toronto."
"MF/D: a warm, full feel fills the mouth with each sip. very low carbonation leaves the mouth wanting more."
"D - A nice IPA with a more herbal that musty character. There is a nice mineral quality to the bitterness that reinforces the hop qualities and works nicely with the malt. Not too bad for a relatively inexpensive, canned IPA."
"An excellent beer on cask. Caledonian really impresses me. Probably the best Englsih IPA I have tried. The hops are present and strong, but the tart apple is what puts this over the top. Excellent, and highly recommended."
"taste is blonde like at the front round and marshmallow, light toffee like - then kicks in with a pleasant hop kick at the end...not an IPA by ANY stretch of the imagination either in british or american terms...but still a damn good brew."
"Fresh, Floral and lightly bitter hops decorate a light smooth and biscuity malt body. Finishes biscuity and just bitter. Drinks as easy as you like. Fresh and delicious. A top ale."
"Served with a small off white head that mostly faded and no lace. Color is medium amber. Aroma is malt, toffee, British hop. flavor's about the same. Very good balance. Tad thin but good carbonation. Great finish. Easy drinking. Definitely a session."
"D: It's more of an English Pale Ale than an IPA for me and pretty average for either. I only really drank the whole thing to finish it, not because I wanted more."
"Mouthfeel - very smooth, watery with good carbonation. A little diactyl slickness."
"Overall, a fantastic and somewhat unconventional IPA. Judging from the almost bland, light appearance, it seemed that it would be a decent brew at best, but that was the only weakness of this beer. Taste was excellent, with the sweet malts claiming the spotlight and the drinkability was one of the best I've had for an EIPA. Another great brew from Caledonian."
"A delightful refreshing ale, eminently quaffable. I had several. Well, at 1.49 in Wetherspoons, who was I to resist. A great session beer."
"As far as UK-produced IPAs go, this is surprising vibrant - smooth flavours, balanced hops and grain - I'd gladly have this one again."
"Pours a crystal clear light amber, some orange highlights, very thin white head forms, quickly settles down to a thin ring around the glass, some lace spirals stick. Smell is nice, floral, herbal hoppiness, very fruity, mangoes, quite sweet, lots of honey and toast, nice biscuity maltiness, more floral and fruit, minerally, not bad. Taste is similar, sharp and minerally, some fruit, floral, caramel sweetness, biscuit, apricots, mango, herbal hoppiness, more fruity sweetness, decent bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. Definitely a good session beer, very refreshing and easy drinking. Thanks Neil and Maz!"
"Medium bodied with low carbonation. Smooth and creamy. An easy drinking session beer."
"Thanks Bobsy."
"Drinkability - this is far from offensive but I would definitely look in other directions first for a decent IPA."
"The side of the can lists this as ""2.2 UK Alcohol Units"" and that ""Responsible drinkers don't exceed 4 daily units"". At least that almost allows me another can of Deuchars, which I am just about ready for. Let me go on record as saying this: this beer is better in bottle, and it must be a dream on cask, but it is so good that (unlike most other UK offerings) even the dreaded pasteurized, preservative ridden can can't ruin it."
"At first glance, this beer doesn't seem like much of an IPA. Neither the 4.4% ABV or pale golden colour are giving me much confidence in the beer, though I haven't had many IPAs from the UK. The smell definitely gave of a nice presence of light hops. The first sips showed some solid promise... I picked out some light floral/citrus hops and a bit of malt to balance things out. I found soon after though that while the flavour is good, there just wasn't enough of it. Given the lower alcohol, this brew had a pretty nice flavour but it was too light and not quite what I'm looking for in an IPA, though it would make a fine session beer. Having mostly been exposed to American IPAs, I would like to try a few more British ones to see how they compare."
"From Scotland. Pours a bit flat. I'm drinking this a bit below room temperature. Has a pleasant smell of butterscotch, vanilla and an ever so ghostly waft of strawberry. Very smooth and refreshing with butterscotch being the predominant flavour. For an IPA it doesn't have a strong hops presence. I quite like it nonetheless and is perfect for this crisp October afternoon."
"D - A can do if you re set on an IPA and there s no better IPA around"
"A medium body with a light and soft carbonation further contribute to this beer's extreme drinkability"
"M/D: The beer had a medium body to it with the carbonation not that noticeable. It was smooth and creamy and very easy to drink, although I would think that this was more of just a pale ale than an IPA, but very sessionable."
"Very drinkable. An IPA by hop character more than strength or body. A very good choice for a ""sessionable"" English IPA."
"Being my first venture into English IPAs, I'd have to say I'm very happy with the beer and would suggest it highly."
"D: Drinks alright. Would go down easier if aftertaste was sweeter. Overall, pretty good."
"Pours a slightly cloudy pinkish orange under a one finger off-white head that settles very slowly, leaving some nice lace on its way out. Very enticing citrus and floral nose, with the emphasis on carantion. The mouth is mildly carbonated and surprisingly light. The taste brings a great deal to the table, including a minty note along with the flowers and the fruit. It is crisp and refreshing, rather than overly hoppy, in line with the British version of the style. Very nice and crisp, I could drink quite a few of these."
"overall i would not call this an IPA, more of an english pale ale. needs more hops."
"Pours a clear golden yellow colored body, somewhat reddish, with an average head, lasting, creamy. Has a somewhat hoppy aroma, and some malts. A nice creamy mouthfeel, with some hops on the end, but smooth. Has a sweet malt taste."
"Drinkability: was wrapped to pick up a box (12 pints) from the local First Choice Liquor for under $20AU...& thoroughly enjoying chewing through it."
"I was expecting a bit more hoppiness as it is an IPA, however not a bad session pint"
"This currently stands as the best beer I have tried in England so far, I actually enjoyed it a little more than Fuller's London Pride on cask. A little gem of a real ale."
"Overall, this was an interesting brew. Very restrained in the hop department compared to American interpretations of IPAs, but still great stuff. I would definitely recommend."
"Drinkability- An easy drinker, but not something I'd be prone to buy again."
"Super-enjoyable cask ale. Very easy to drink and come back for more."
"d) A good session ale, with more emphasis on light & fresh hop flavours than a heavy bitterness"
"This beer is a great beer for summer, with its refreshing flavours and crisp mouthfeel."
"Deuchars IPA is like furniture in every pub in Edinburgh. Nice golden ale with very little head which however leaves good lacing around. Smell is predominantly hoppy, slightly lemony also but taste is too bitter [even due to the lack of carbonation] to discern any malt associations or characteristic. A typical scottish 'real ale'."
"The beer is smooth, well-carbonated and clean, lending a very high drinkability to this beer. Highly recommended for a well-balanced and easy drinking but interesting English IPA."
"I drank this in my sister's local in Dulwich, South London; I add this to indicate that the distance from the source may be influencing my assessment of this beer. It is perhaps the least interesting of all the cask beers I had on my tour (about twenty). Orange amber colour with very modest head. Distinctive taste, very mealy and biscuity, dry hops. Personally I didn't like the style, but the weight of reviews suggests a flaw in my particular barrel."
"Boring."
"It was 4.4% ABV in the bottle."
"Taste is flowery, citrus and a little soapy from the hops, although the beer is not very bitter. There is nothing about herbs or special hops on the label, my guess would be Fuggle hops. The malt is light and toffe, light biscuity, that adds a great balance to the hops. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth, also by the (suspected) diacetyl. A somewhat sweet body comes from the yeast that is not known for it's great attenuation. Drinkability is great and every sip seems to taste different."
"Mouthfeel: Average carbonation. Light- medium bodied."
"500mL can purchased from LCBO in Toronto. I think I remember enjoying this beer during my year in the UK in 2001, but this example is making me doubt my fond memories. Appearance is light and clear and bubbly. Aroma is non-existent. Flavour is weak with just a tiny hint of fruitiness. Glad I only bought the single can."
"Tastes of grassy and earthy hops, pale malt and a dry lightly hoppy finish. A highly drinkable beer and on of the best canned offerings from the LCBO this year."
"Although the lack of strong bitterness makes this fall short of an IPA, it does put the drinkability way up there. This is a fine session ale. Refreshing with a wonderful balance of fruity malt and underachieving hops. My tilt is fairly high on this one, but I say it's a damn fine beer."
"Perfectly clear aburn-gold with a huge off-white head initially, moderate retention. Slow steady carbonation with lots of lacing. Smells like hay - a well-kept barn. Taste is hoppy but not overly so, barley malt, bitter, cashew nuttiness and dryness. Aftertaste is dried fruit and nuts. Mouthfeel is smooth, tart fruit, balanced bitterness. A very refreshing aftertaste lingers and pleases. I found this not as hoppy as some American counterparts I've tried, and not the same drawn-out kick, but it hit a very good balance and was very drinkable."
"D - Really nice, easy to drink and very sessionable. IPA though? I dunno."
"D: Very drinkable."
"Had this at Haket Pub in Gothenburg."
"Pours a deep, clear golden with a perfect fluffy head at nearly room temperature. Aroma is just the right combination of mild toffee malt and tangy woody hops, and it carries over into the flavour. Mouthfeel is just great, and accentuates the balanced, oily hop flavour of this IPA. Very little aftertaste compared to other IPAs and, as others have said, you could drink this all day long. A great cask session ale."
"Maybe Ive been having too many Imperial IPAs lately, but this IPA struck me as more of a pale ale or even a bitter than anything else. It has a golden ale color, and a moderate head with a soapy appearance. The aroma is very lightly hoppy and a little herby. The body is thin, and the taste reminds me of a mild bitter with some subtle pepper notes. Not much malt character to this one at all. A refreshment beer much more so than a sipping beer, and its only a so-so one at that."
"D - Extremenly drinkable and due to fairly common availability in Glasgow one of my beers of choice when drinking in pubs. Alcohol means that can count this as a great session beer. Have a laugh at the guys drinking their fizzy mass produced lager when you enjoy this."
"This is a must find. I drink it whenever I have a chance. It is a great example of a session beer. You can enjoy this beer all afternoon and evening long. I occassionally spot this on cask in the Midlands and in London, but it was terrible at the William Wallace in London. They obvously were taking care of their beers. Find this in a good pub though and you will enjoy a great beer. As they say...You are Due a Deuchars!"
"How does it drink, well ask any punter next time you see them ordering this in a bar, they will not deviate to any other beer if at all possible. This is highly drinkable and is a good all night beer as it is a very reasonable 4.4% abv, (in Scotland it is anyway, maybe the exported stuff is different). A very good beer, in fact most drinks from the Caledonian brewery are worth a try."
"Overall - An average IPA - nothing groundbreaking... Probably worth a try though..."
"D - Near perfect drinkability. Don't expect a hop-laden IPA, just enjoy it for the excellent session beer it is."
"Overall: A remarkable brew, truly refreshing and drinkable. A great session beer."
"D - Nice pint to have a session beer, just a beer to enjoy and not think about too much, a good sessioner"
"First of all, this was a nice change of pace from an American IPA. The hops were very upfront, but not overwhelming in the least and the dynamics were stellar. The 4.4% ABV was a nice change of pace as well."
"M&D: this beer on draught is distinctive from the bottled version, with a less aromatic profile, and somewhat less malty, but the lively and delicately bitter texture makes it an incredibly drinkable bitter-hoppy ale... Fresh and subtle on the mouthfeel, as a true real ale on form should be, superbly balanced... In fact, it's more like a cup of good quality Taiwanese high-mountain green tea if I may~~"
"smooth, light carbonation with an easy drinkability and a gentle hoppiness. same flavors come out in the taste as the aroma, with a hint of citrusy sweetness. an incredibly drinkable and enjoyable English IPA."
"Beer poured a golden orange with an ok head initially with splotchy lacing left behind. Nose was a bit malty but nothing else. Taste started a bit malty with a citrus hop finish. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and had a very nice smooth finish. At 4.4 abv this brew was extremely sessionable and pretty smackable to boot. This would be the perfect beer for going out with friends to socialize!"
"After three of these, I have to say a yummy ale quite tasty and obviously very drinkable."
" Moderate hop bitterness by American IPA standards, but eminently more balanced in my opinion. I don't generally like IPAs and avoided this brew for most of the time I was in Scotland in favor of the wealth of Scottish style ales, but once I actually tried this ale I loved it. It would probably be considered a Pale Ale by our hop-crazed standards. The room temp serving brings out the hop flavor complexity, which is quite nice without over the top bitterness. In fact it is supremely well balanced with a wide variety of hop characteristics working together with a flavor malt backbone that is still detectable. Scotlands ubiquitous cask ale (even the airport, where I got my final fix)."
"good thing its a 500ml bottle cause it goes pretty quickly. i've been interested in trying this for a while and am glad i finally did. now to try it on cask...i wish."
"Pumps into my glass a murky golden color with a dense white head. Aroma is full of fruity, grassy and floral hoppyness. Tastes of pine cone, orange zest and lemon balanced well with light caramel malt. Creamy and soft on the palate, finishes dry. I love this beer, I drank 4 imperial pints in one session! This is the ultimate session beer for a hophead."
"I'm disapointed"
"Overall: Dont worry yourself too much about the IPA moniker if youre not from the UK, this is just a damn good brew that should be enjoyed no matter what they decide to call it. In fact, such is its popularity that the Caledonian Deuchars IPA is now a regular beer at the Grove Inn, Leeds it seems. When on form, this really does take some beating from the Cask."
"Has a very quick mouthfeel and doesnt seem to have the body that Im used to with IPAs, which was disappointing, given the amount of praises the other patrons had."
"A delicious and very drinkable beer from the cask..easier to drink than spring water ."
"Recomended."
"Other comments: Poured quite a few of these out of a cask for people at the 2004 Norwich Beer Festival, but I never did get to try it. If the bottled version is this good, I'll definitely jump on it the next time I see it on cask. Very drinkable."
"I am still new at this and was suprised that pouring this beer resulted in a pale, gold beer with a milky white head. I thought IPAs were darker, this looked more like a pils to me. The head left excellent lacing. Aroma was mildly hoppy and the taste is quite nice, balanced between the malty body and hop finish. A very good session brew I am sure."
"Probably way better on cask."
"This is a superb pale ale but tis no IPA, plain and simple."
"Bottle: Poured a golden colored ale with a small head with minimum retention. Aroma is mostly comprised of floral malts with limited sweetness. Taste is lightly hoppier then your average English pale ale and a bit dry at the end. Overall, very refreshing but I feel again that this would be way better served fresh on cask"
"An IPA in the American style. Big hops in the bottle. Fresh at the LCBO. Chinook citrus smell. Bit bitter side, but easy drink. Wheat for fruit? Peat moss grassy. Tad metallic. Are they foolin' with the recipe? Pine, limes? Very decent, session ale."
"Pasturized bottled version at 4.4%....poured a gold color with a small 1 finger white cap that goes to a nice lace and sticky ring. Mild carconation. Aromas of floral hopping over sweet bready malts. Front is delicate with creamy sweet malts in balance with grassy-floral hops...light body, very smooth and mellow...finish is clean with a drying by the hops. A very refreshing light IPA...a very pleasnt way to slack a thirst on a warm day. I would recommend this IPA to both dry ale fanciers and light ale fanciers alike."
"500 mL brown bottle with a clearly marked freshness date on the side of the bottle."
"Very good at reproducing the cask version"
"A clean bright yellow body witha nice white foamy head that left some lace effects. Light citrusy notes in the aroma. The taste had a fruity characterisic, definitly grapefruit, at the start with agood sharp hop bite and a clean crisp finish. Previous tastes of English IPA's (Imported in bottles to the USA) led me to belive the the British did'nt like to use hops for amoma or flavor (not just bitterness). This ale proved me wrong. Hopefully if I get to try the bottled import I will not be disappointed."
"This IPA poured a slightly hazy golden color with thin white foam. The smell was modest: malty with a touch of hops. The taste was malty with a very low hoppiness. This has to be one of the least hoppy IPAs that I have tasted (it is listed as 36 IBU, but I find that hard to believe). The finish was slightly bitter and hoppy. The mouthfeel was clean and smooth with medium-light body and low carbonation. The light bitterness lingered a bit. A decent brew, though quite low in hops."
"Sunrise golden orange color, mild haze and a thin lace to boot. Tons of delicate hop oil aroma and flavor, suggestions of ripe pear and golden raisin come to mind. Light dough malt in the back with a mild bitterness to balance ... there seems to be more hop flavor than bitterness is provides a perfect base for such a tasty brew. Certainly not an IPA by any means ... regardless this is a great cask ale."
"Hand-pulled cask at Prince of Wales in London. Dark golden orange color with a minimal off-white head and almost no lacing. Aroma of toned down hops along with some fruit. Very smooth, with flavors of malt and hops at the forefront, along with some fruit and a pinch of spice. The finish is mild but insistently bitter. Pretty good offering from Caledonian."
"ive marked this down because one, its not an IPA, and two, its a boring, forgettable beer. mix this with the fact this brewer is capable of so much better, theres not much to talk about here."
"Decent beer, worth a try."
"This is a lovely real ale that I had on cask at the Wenlock Arms. This pale golden/amber beer has a nice cap of white foam on top. The aromas are of FRESH, juciy hops, and floral light malts. The taste is lovely. It's quite hoppy and a bit malty, but I would not call this an IPA, i'd call it a regular pale ale. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth and the drinkability? GREAT"
"Shiny medium copper color with an orange-like hue. Light frothy white head. Tight and compact with sticky lacing. Nice smell of moderate grapefruit and citrus tang. Taste is very hoppy, citrus zest and puckering bitterness at the end. Very lightly toasted malt flavors lie way underneath. Hop bitterness is present but not overwhelming like an American IPA. Moderate carbonation and crisp hop bitterness make it very refreshing and easy to drink. Very crisp and dry, cleansing the palate with every gulp. I had this one with citrus stuffed mini chickens (cornish game hens) and it went very well. This version of an IPA was more subtle, very drinkable, and very refreshing. Worth a try."
"I am addicted to heavily-hopped beers, and this has dryness (although not as much as my other favourites - including the bottled version)"
"Pours with a white head that stays and leaves some lace. Nose has a hint of skunkiness maybe it's the clear bottle - it's best buy date is Nov 03. Clear orange color, little carbonation, hoppy as it should be but not overpowering with hints of malt coming through. The ABV is 4.4%."
"Clear ( why???) 500ml bottle smuggled back from the UK. Perfect, high, frothy white head sits atop a bright, golden brew. Steady streams of carbonation. Slight skunk scent at first but fresh, grassy British hop aromas take over. Clean, light malt flavor with some fruity apple notes. Body is light, and quickly loses balance as the hops take charge and flood the mouth with great piney, earthy flavors and chewy finish. Not quite enough malt body ( or alcohol) to balance the hoppy presence for an IPA IMHO but a very tasty session beer for the hop lover."
"I'd recommend trying it on tap or cask, and if you find a distributer that has it, e-mail me."
"Hoppy like an IPA should be, hint of peatiness in the finish, combined with a nice bitter hop flavour, i really couldn't believe it had 3.8% (different to the the above ABV given, however i did sample it cask conditioned, so maybe its different from the bottle), this certainly was very tasty."
"126"
"Once again had this on my most recent trip to London. I was shocked that the color was pale straw, looked like a lager. it is hoppier than most English brews but still way below ours. A very refreshing beer with high drinkablity. I found it a bit unusual it was being offered in winter. seems better suited to spring and summer. My girlfriends favorite."
