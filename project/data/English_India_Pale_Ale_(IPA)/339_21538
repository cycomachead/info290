It has a strong maltiness and a very restrained hop presence. It drinks extremely well and tastes good, which makes this a prime contender for a session ale at a bar, but it's not something I'd pick up again for the pleasure of home-consumption. Good beer overall, slightly weak by IPA standards.","ThePaintedGrey","Feb 21, 2014"

The head, formed by lots of rising carbonation, was beige colored and displayed nice retention and moderate lacing. The aroma was of American hops, some orange and mango notes (Amarillo hops?) and a note of must. The flavors were rather average I thought, being mostly a blend of crystal malt, pale malt and citrus from the hops. It was not as bitter as most American-made IPAs and though sessionable it seemed uninspired. The body was medium, the mouthfeel average and the carbonation a little too high.","thekevlarkid","Beers"

Earthy citrus meets bready mineral water and a hint of yeast funk. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a slick mouthfeel. Meh. This one is ok, but there's either some wild yeast working in this bottle or the beer was kept on the yeast too long after fermentation.

I'd love to have this on tap and probably will since I live in NJ. My first flying fish beer and definitely not my last. The malt and unfiltered taste reminds me of the taste you get from the cricket hill ipa but this one has more hops to balance so I like this one better.

The crisp pale malts, citrus, and smooth floral hops all come together for a very easy drinking bitter beer. The aftertaste does have a bit of resiny hops to make this feel more like an IPA.

3.67,3.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"UPDATE: Tried this again - 08/25/10. It was bottled today. I was interested to try this fresh, for obvious reasons. I'll restate my previous opinion/observation that this beer has striking ESB qualities - in mouthfeel and flavor. If you take away the soft, tropical fruit essence to the hop aroma - different (unique?) but nice - you have an ESB. They nailed the mouthfeel and and flavors of the English ESB's I adore - one of the few US breweries I feel has done it. But, really, going into this, I'm thinking IPA and it doesn't meet my expectations (of American versions). I'm willing to offer, however, that the HopFish is best viewed as a unique take (strictly in the hop character) on a true English IPA. Unfortunately, I haven't had much experience at all trying English IPA's - Deuchar's IPA from Scotland is the closest I've come to it, and even that isn't exactly what I'm getting at here. The closest thing to Deuchar's IPA I've had over here is Left Hand's 400 Pound Monkey. The closest thing I've had to Flying Fish's HopFish has been Bateman's XXXB (excellent ale!). Anyway, if you can locate a bottle of the Bateman's XXXB, try it, and imagine it with an almost pina colada hop aroma and flavor. That's what I feel is going on with the HopFish. Interesting brew, for sure. Not what I'm accustomed to as far as American IPA's go.","Bouleboubier","May 08, 2010"

Also detected a malty sweetness. The flavor was very similar, with the fruitiness up front, giving way to malty sweetness, and finished off with dry hop bitterness.

It had a medium sized aroma of tea mix, toasted malts, caramel, citrus hops, and a slight pinch of grapefruit. The taste started off with lightly toasted malts and then out of nowhere, the taste shot into the hoppy/crispy side of the beer. That side of the beer was filled with citrus fruits, caramel, citrus hops, a small slice of grapefruit, and some pine needles at the finish. It was a light to medium bodied beer with a nice crispy aftertaste of citrus hops, grapefruit, and a slight touch of toasted malts.

4.05,14.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, good kick, good representation of style, although I like a little more flavor in my IPA’s and there are others that I’d choose in the style, this is a good beer that I could go with for a long time.","TheManiacalOne","Jan 19, 2007"
4.01,13,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D - I've been consistently and unexpectedly impressed with Flying Fish beers (especially given that I've been consistently underwhelmed with the counterpart, Magic Hat); this one is solid, not the best hoppy IPA I've ever had, but definitely a good beer with a nice solid flavor that I could drink for a little while","soupyman10","Jan 10, 2007"
3.63,2.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This poured a very clear orange colour with an off-white head about an inch high. Lacing immediately formed as the head slowly fell, a little clumpy and thick but not a great quantity. Citrusy hops were evident as soon as the bottle was cracked - grapefruit and sweet tarts for the most part, a little grassy too. Very grassy hop flavour with some grapefruit and pine resin backing, bit of malt and moderate bitterness. Quite fruity, actually, with a bit of spice in the finish. Lingering hops. Medium body and carbonation. Not bad, but the choice of hops doesn't quite work for me. It reminds me a bit of a double IPA that a bunch of us made a while back, I think the Centennial version.","DrJay","Dec 24, 2006"
3.38,-4.8,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Overall, I was disappointed after finally trying this one. Lack of full, robust hop flavoring common in IPA's left me wanting. I may try it again on tap somewhere, if only to support the local economy.","IgnatiusReilly","Dec 19, 2006"
3.62,2,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is a nice quaffable beer; it certainly strikes the balance between quaffability and hop character that should define the style. It is not one of the more aggressive versions of the style, but never fear, it is still enjoyable and hoppy enough for all but the seriously hop-deranged.","Gueuzedude","Beers"

I may try it again, but not anytime soon."". Now, four months later, and on cask, I find it a very good beer that I would be happy to have again. Not sure why the big difference, just glad I took a second chance on it.","","Oct 30, 2006"

4.02,13.2,3,3.5,4.5,4,4,"A solid beer. I did not pour it, but rather drank right out of bottle so I can't really judge the appearance. The smell and the taste were both sufficently hoppy without being over powering. This created a very smooth drinkable beer, with an execlent mouthfeel. If you like IPAs this is most certainly a good beer to try. Don't drink and review.","treehugger02010","Oct 09, 2006"

2.26,-36.3,3.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,"Cloudy glowing orange gold. Short sand colored head of mixed size bubbles with some staying power that eventually settles leaving a spray of dust. Steady streams of carbonation hit the surface. Light orange blossom and caramel aromas mixed some rind notes are present, but nothing overly IPA-distinct. The flavor starts with a light citrus rind element supported by a bit of malt sweetness. Finishes citrus juice  orange and lemon  tart and sweet with a minimal amount of hop bite. A lemon juice tone overlays it all, and the finish is short, thankfully, as this became less drinkable as it warmed ever so slightly. Medium-light body with a flaccid mouthfeel, the carbonation makes this barely tolerable. Utterly unenjoyable, with a preponderance of lemon rind/juice flavors. A disappointment.","hopsaplenty","Jul 29, 2006"
3.16,-11,4,3,2.5,4,4,"While not flawed, nor is it interesting. While the name HopFish calls to mind other locals like Hop Devil, Hop Wallop, Hops Infusion, and Hop Hog, its more in line with Cricket Hill's Hopnotic IPA, a self described training wheel IPA.","RonfromJersey","Jul 04, 2006"

Could have been a little more complex in the taste.","laintringulis","May 28, 2006"

3.08,-13.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Poured a decent sized, dense, cream colored head that couldn't quite hold onto the glass. Transparent, radiant copper colored beer requires patience to reveal any sign of life. Faint aroma reveals a touch of crisp hops. Huge bicsuit malt flavor barely lets the hops breathe. Hops are funky, a bit of metallic and tea-like. This continues into the finish without a drop of bitterness Body is light, and the mouthfeel is just a touch froathy. For some reason this reminds me of the Otter Creek Copper Ale, but I definitely wouldn't guess IPA.","HappyHourHero","Mar 18, 2006"
3.75,5.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"On cask at the Grey Lodge in NE Philly. I had a sample of this after thinking it was the Puckerfish. I was disappointed to not be able to try the Puckerfish but the Hopfish is also a nice beer. The beer poured a nice golden / amber color with a slight head. The aroma is of strong hops with a bit of fruitness and malts. The taste is a bit of a hop bomb but it balanced out well with the sweetness of the malts. With a medium body, this beer is pretty drinkable from what I had sampled.","ggaughan","Mar 17, 2006"

It was floral will not alot of bitter hop smell. Poured almost amber into my glass with a decent head that stuck around for a while. The taste was of a normal ipa yet there seamed to be alittle more sweet malts that gave it some small fruit notes. Mouthfeel was smooth and satistfying and even refreshing alittle stickire of an ipa ive had. The aftertaste is not lingering at all though. I'd say this beer is definatley very drinkable and i can't wait to have this one in summer.","mattpetti","Feb 06, 2006"

Flavor is a nice hop bomb, but not so much as to ruin other later tastings. Great floral flavors with some grapefruit and just hints of Christmas. Bits of caramel and some honey too. The hops left me smacking my lips. Nice heft on this beer with a very pleasant dry finish. Slightly oily though. Great carbonation, just enough to lighten this beer on the tongue and to keep the dry qualities from tiring out my tongue.","MuddyFeet","Apr 24, 2005"

The ABV is manageable, and while the elements don't blend so much as trade places, at least they're there and identifiable.

4,12.7,4,4,4,4,4,"I've never been overly impressed with Flying Fish and I hesitated to order this. Surprisingly though, it's a wonderful offering. Cloudy golden in color with a creamy white head that left solid lacing behind. Smelled fruity and malty with just enough floral hops. Taste was quite similar... juicy fruit flavors coupled with floral hops and a bittering that grows and grows and consumes the mouth requiring another juicy sip from its drinker. Mouth is full, smooth and creamy yet quite delicate. Really enjoyable stuff. I look forward to enjoying it again soon.","oxmasterscream","Mar 20, 2005"

Just a bit of medium/large white bubbles at the edges of the glass and a light dusting. Semi soured scents (alliteration anyone?) Cant really feel the carbonation in this version, but yet it doesnt feel flat, more like I am drinking a cold cask-conditioned. I like low carbonation, so this is good. Very smooth and low to medium bodied. Nicely hoppy, grapefruit and biteyness, tastes of gin.bit of caramel sweetness, almost honey-like. Lots of flavor going on. Easy drinker.","shapudding","Beers"
