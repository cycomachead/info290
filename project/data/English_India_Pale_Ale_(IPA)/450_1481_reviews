"Bottle. This is one of my favorite IPAs."
""
""
""
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Clear golden/bronze color. Less than a finger of head that disappears and has some light lacing. Smells hoppy and almost a little soapy. Taste is Bol and hoppy. A little sour but in a good way. Some grapefruit rind and maybe a little coriander. Dry after taste but very hoppy finish, almost too hoppy. The after taste is a bit too assertive. Medium mouthfeel, good carbonation. Solid beer, doesn't move the needle too much though."

"This was served to me on tap in a standard pint glass.  Poured a very dark copper with nearly no head and minimal lacing.  faint hops aroma with s gentle, mildly hoppy taste.  Mouthfeel was adequate, and that's overall what I consider this IPA to be: an adequate, drinkable beer, about on par with Sam Adams Rebel."

"T: Has a very rustic malt character and low diacetyl. Alcoholic butterscotches, but with really no sweetness. Estery, fruity, chewy biscuit. Grapefruit pith and citrus, and slightly astringent pine. (2.75/5)"
""
""
""
"O: This was a good simple IPA, nothing extravagant, it was pretty balanced and had some good flavors."

"Pours hazy gold color with a small off white head that faded quickly and left good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, caramel, biscuit, lemon zest, floral hops, grains and some citrus fruit. Pretty basic nose, but very well balanced and better than normal for an English style IPA. Tastes like it smells, with malt, caramel, biscuit, lemon zest, floral hops, grains, orange peel, toffee, mild spices and some citrus fruit like orange juice or some citrus hops. It's sweet but the malt and hops taste is evenly divided for great balance and drinkability. Tasted much better than it smelled. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with average carbonation, a medium body that was a little chewy, and a malty aftertaste that was sweet with nice citrus accents. Overall this was a nice English style IPA that would make for a fine session beer."
"Overall: Nice take on an EIPA. Next time in Philly, 'I'll check these guys out and this beer too."

"There's a sort of earthy dankness that even translates to the feel, though it doesn't weigh down the medium body or take away from the brightness that also translates. Crispness comes out strong on the palate from front to back, as does smoothness in the semi-dry feel."

"Pours a deep clear amber with a creamy white head that lingers and leaves big lacing. The aroma is good, with some light fruit, a little hops and a bit of bread. The taste is pretty much the same but it doesn't have a huge amount of the depth of an English IPA. It does have a nice weight to the body and a good silky feeling. A solid English IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours to a generous head and even lacing. Clear copper color. Aroma is whole leaf noble and PNW hops and crystal malt. Flavor is strong and balanced, a more British interpretation of IPA. Mouthfeel is medium to light. Overall a fine brew that satisfies without extremes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was impressed with this IPA. Very good taste. Definitely can tell it is an IPA. Glad I bought the 6 pack."
""
"O: Yards is local, so I absolutely love picking up their offerings. I've had this brew on-tap before and that seemed to be eons better than the bottle. For what it is, Yards IPA is a solid brew that feels quite sessionable. Might recommend this to those that prefer their IPAs on the less bitter side."

"Served on cask in Philly. smell is all resony hops, taste has some notes of caramel bread. A lot of raw hop oils on the finish. A tasty hopped up IPA with a strong balance of caramel, grainy malts. Enjoyable, would have it again to dig a little deeper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" The taste is good which is a surprise based on the smell- mix of sweet caramel with a light yeast up front leads to more of an herbal hop taste with slight fruitiness which seems to blend the hop and yeast flavors with a mild spice element in the finish. Overall this is pretty drinkable, could use more hop flavor than just bitterness, but considering it is an English IPA it is better than most of the style"
"TOTAL - 44/50"

"India Pale Ale pours a bronze color with a small lacing head. There is a subtle hoppy floral aroma, with a malty backbone; very balanced. The taste is balanced, with a mild hoppy flavor, and a sweet malty backbone. Nice full body, good taste. Overall a nice solid beer."
"Nice reddish/amber color with great head and good retention - great retention for a bottle, really. Good, hoppy taste and smell, overally very full bodied and filling, if not a bit narrow. Glass emptied with full lacing. A great quality IPA that can't be much improved on."

"O:No real complexities that I could detect. Mostly crystal malt and aggressive bitterness that lingers."
""
""
"Overall this is a brew I will continue to buy, and likely to try more from the brewer. Balanced would be the word I use to best describe this IPA."
""
"Appearance is copper with golden edges. The two fingers of head stays around for some time and leave nice lacing in its wake. The nose is distinctly fresh hops. The flavor profile blends mild malts with a pleasant, but slightly too mild hop finish. There is also a hint of malt sweetness on the finish. This is a good representation of the English-style IPA, but it is likely too mild to appeal to the advanced hop-head."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This beer is great its pretty much on par with their DIPA which I love but the lower ABV would make this more session able. Regardless Yards impresses me every time!"

"This is a very pleasant blend of english and american ipa styles that is easy to drink and has plenty of hop character without an excessive bitter. Friendly yet firm, this is a beer I could go for again and again. I am going to go out on the limb and call it sessionable because it doesn't wreck the palate and because it has a very casual flavor that I really like."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and has an excellent balance between the malts and hops."
""
"Pours a light amber, but looks flat. Some head, but very little. Some lace, somehow. Smells a bit better than a typical English IPA! Tastes and feels like an English IPA, which isn't my usual choice, but this worked well! Overall, not bad. Not great, but not bad."
""

"I had this beer on tap at the Hitching Post Restaurant in Bern Township PA and was impressed with the golden amber color. Good foam head but the bubbles dissipated quickly. The lacing was thick with good retention on the glass. The bouqet was lacking for my taste with just a very faint smell of citrus but not enough to distinguish anything in particular. The flavor is very good with a good hop presence on the front and a malty almost biscuity lingering bitter tangerine finish on the back. The carbonation is a bit too much for me. It filled me up quickly. Overall a decent IPA but I couldn't n see myself drinking more than 2. Good summer IPA."

"Medium amber with heavy foam. Sticky. Active bubbles. Bready caramel nose. The beer nicely balances hop with subtle malt sweetness. Juicy. Hint of pine. Really good ipa. 4 4 425 425 425"
"O-a decent IPA, a little sweeter than I prefer and not as hoppy"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer appeared an orange-ish color, slightly hazy, with a nice thick, white head that was decently retained. Citrus hops and slight bready aroma. The beer, for an English IPA is too hoppy, in my opinion. I expected it to be more balanced with the hops more muted. Nonetheless, citrus and earthy hops with some pale malts. The beer had a moderate feel and was easy to drink. Overall, a decent beer."

"I'm an IPA rookie having only tasted a total of 12 to 16 different varieties, but this has to be amoungst one of my favorites. I don't know if I would call it world class as that may be reserved for an imperial IPA like Yards' Cape of Good Hope IPA, but this one is definitely refreshing and not overly hoppy at all. I find it very drinkable and capable of satisfying a hop connoisseur (hop head) as well. I'm giving this a strong 4.4 out of 5! Cheers Yards!"

"Decent. Gets better as you drink. Not prototypical in the way that it should be more malty. Or that the maltiness would have that certain signature."
""
""
""
"O - Very enjoyable, easy going IPA. It's definitely on the sweet side, but the fruity hops come in and lend nice balance, making this a tasty, drinkable beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Distinctly English IPA flavors but with a bit more oomph. A little strong on the earthiness I think but pretty solid overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I liked this on draft, but I'd not buy this bottled again, due to a stale, edgy, sharp off taste that reminds me of the morning after frat basement."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"You can certainly taste an influence from the English/Euro yeast strain that must be used here, dark fruits and spices. Full flavored and well-rounded."
""
"O: I feel like this is a pretty good example of the English IPA. Drinkable and refreshing."
""
""
""
"Citrus flavoring hops and bitterness dominate. No real off flavors, but bitterness lingers a but much for my taste. Floral notes and earthiness are present, but are overridden by citrus."

"O- A really nice beer that has very nice balance. I am really enjoying this beer and will pick it up again. I have not had many English IPAs and ESBs but the kind of falls some where between the few beers that I have tried in those styles and I really like it!"

"Bottled in March 2012. Dark copper orange in color with a yellow hue and good clarity. Poured with a short, rocky, off-white foam with good staying power. The foam slowly reduced to a thick cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Pungent citrus hop aroma with orange, ripe pineapple and grapefruit. A light caramel and biscuit maltiness manages to show through as well. Medium-bodied with lazy, but rich, full carbonation. Pungent mix of ripe citrus and floral hop flavors right up front and through the middle. Hop flavors abruptly drop away leaving only bitterness through the middle to the end, although the citrusy aromas linger throughout. Finishes dry with a lightly sweet caramel maltiness and tapering hop bitterness. Lots of character and very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this beer is mostly hops and the associated floral hop taste. There is a good mix of bitter and floral hops as well as a few malts as well."
""
""
"O: Another good one from Yards (their pale, at least on tap, is amazing); it’s hoppy but not over the top. Don’t get me wrong, these taste buds enjoy a good walloping, but at 7% abv, this is a very sessionable beer if you want a good buzz for the sweet-sixteen... 4"

"clear amber gold with a big off white head. big citrusy hop aroma with some floral notes as well. Floral and citrus hops dominate the flavor at first before giving way to a sweet pale malt base. Some piney notes are present in the finish. medium bodied, slightly sticky with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty easy drinking. A nice take on the style but nothing extraordinary. I'm glad to have tried this and would drink more but wouldn't seek it out."
"O: Smells nice but doesn't last long. Flavor doesn't match aroma. Doesn't compare well to other IPAs like Stone or Avery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Yards IPA is a tremendous IPA and one of my favorites for a long time now. It pours a nice rich amber in a pint with a great off-white head. This is a very English IPA and that is what I love. Plenty of malt and rich citrusy hops with each sip. I consider a thinking man's IPA with plenty of zip but enough to contemplate and enjoy. A great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Solid IPA, even with the 'British' designation. Even though the malts can be strong and thick at times, the resinous hops always come out on top."
"O - Very well done English IPA from yet another great eastern PA brewery. I like the combination of citrus and english malt. Very smooth and perfectly hopped."
"Overall this beer is just okay not much to say kind of bland, probably won't purchase due to, to many other good beers out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good beer. Try it."
""
""
"12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark amber with a small head that dissipates quickly. Has a wonderful hop aroma with citrus tones, right amount of strength. Great taste with a perfect balance of hops and flavors from the malt. Goes down great and has a good carbonation. This beer is a great IPA. Definitely one that I could drink all night."

"6 pack given to me for Xmas from baby sis. Pours a translucent tan capped by a off white head with good retention. Light bubbling carbonation rounds the picture. Nose is full of flower and light caramel. Taste is balanced, almost malt centric with cracker sweetness, add caramel, dash of flower hops. Add undertones of peach. medium bodied. Thanks sis."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Solid English IPA, was expecting a little more bitterness, but an unknown freshness can be more the culprit."
"Overall: A nice beer that I would definitely try again, it reminds me of a more malty version of their Philadelphia Pale Ale."
""
"Clear as day golden straw color with a huge white headed foamy pour. Big soapy and grassy hop aroma. Head is slowly but surely snailing away. Very sticky lace. Flavor has some semi-sweet grainy malt on the front end with a big herbal and grassy presence. Pretty well balanced. Sweetness is subtle and so is the hop bitterness. Pretty nice yet subdued for an IPA."
"Carbonation is on the medium-low side; body is kind of average, but there is an appealing creaminess here. Very much in the British mold; this is an anti-West Coast IPA. The brewery's Philadelphia Pale Ale is markedly hoppier and more contemporary in both style and taste."
""
""
"Fresh bottle. Pours fruity, hazy orange with immense retained head, in my Sam Adams glass. Easy drinking, medium bodied, orange hoppy flavoured, with a pinch of fruit. Pretty good for the style, something I would recommend people try. Something I would keep regular in the fridge if available locally."
""
""
""
""
"Taste - doesn't really taste like an IPA but I guess if it is going for a traditional English IPA type it hits the mark. Good beer nonetheless."
""
"At 7% and hopped up with citrus flavors, I'm not sure what makes this IPA English rather than American. Maybe English malts? Regardless of classification, this is a delicious and well crafted ale. The big, sticky head and full, fluid body complement the balanced palate and hoppy nose perfectly. A worthy IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, really great tasting beer, rather liking this one and a nice take on the style. Very enjoyable would have again no problem."
"O: While this beer does have some good qualities, it falls short in some key areas."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a glass. Clear orange yellow in color with a frothy white head that stuck around for a while. Smell bready and citrusy, oily. Taste dry bitter hops then going to more citrusy oily, balanced out with some malt sweetness backbone, dry bitter finish. Simple enough to be drinkable but complex enough to be interesting. Reminds me of a beefier Sam Smith India Ale. Very good beer."
"NICE, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"I have been slacking in not reviewing this before, so I figured now that I had it on tap at home it is time to review it. A very nice IPA that is really, really drinkable and won't pound your mouth with hops. Nice."
"Mouthfeel is appropriate to the style. A tasty brew - I would try it again, especially if I can find it fresh on tap."
"Had this one at a small local brew fest. I made the mistake of having it right after having a double IPA right before it. However I must say that despite that I though the brew was pretty impressive. This brew poured out as a light golden amber color with a pretty decent looking head on top. The smell of the beer has a pretty nice balance between malts and hops on the nose. The taste of the beer had some good caramel flavors in it and a crisp hop bite also. The mouthfeel of the beer is easy going. Overall I think this IPA is a good social brew where someone can have several of them and still have their taste buds to try other things if need be."
"A pretty standard offering; nothing you haven't seen or tasted before, but it's still Yards, and still good. Pours a golden yellow, notably carbonation and slightly hazy, with a fizzy head that dissipates rather quickly. Aroma and taste are pretty hand-in-hand: a sweet caramel base, generously overlaid with citrusy and piney hops. Medium body, a bit filmy, but generally drinkable, and a fairly good example of the style, despite being outside the country of origin."
"Pours a hazy orange/gold color with about a centimeter of white head that fades fast. Smells of grapefruit, pine, orange and lemon peels, and hops. Tastes similar, with an initial emphasis on grapefruit and other citrus flavors, followed by a weird, almost soapy middle. Ends with a delicious hoppy, bitter finish. Mouth is bitter and dry. Overall, a good IPA."
"O: I could definitely throw back a few of these. I thought this was a solid brew."
"O- Easy drinking solid beer, enjoyed it after work today while sitting on my deck, perfect for a nice sunny day."
"O - Overall, this is a well done EIPA. Very balanced, drinkable, and enjoyable."
"Overall a really good ipa."
"I like this. I think their pale ale is much better with a lot more character however."
"I'm not all that well versed on English IPAs, but I enjoy this quite a bit."
"not bad at all the first time i tried it. not overly hoppy. decent texture and smoothness to it. normal appearance for an IPA. Not he best IPA but far from the worst. Having it by the shore in Wildwood, NJ helped though. good paired with a sloppy cheeseburger."
"Taste is orange and bitter, perfectly reminiscent of English style brews. Overall, a nice balance of malt and hops. If there's one complaint, there could maybe be a tad more hoppiness to it."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a burnt orange color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by hops. Taste is also very hoppy, some citrus notes, not much balance, finishes dry and bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"O: Very good IPA – very hoppy and decent amount of alcohol present just to make things interesting. Would grab for this again."
"O- a well balanced IPA, just like english IPAs should be. id try this again if i had the chance. another good experience form a Yards brew."
"Amber and clear with plenty of head and fair amount of lace. Aroma is citrus and earthy. Medium carbonation and light body. Taste leans toward the dry side with lots of bitterness on the finish. Malty start and middle. A very high hopped English IPA."
"Thank you PA for a great visit!"
"O: A really easy and balanced IPA. Not overly complex, but still tasty. Quite easy to drink."
"D: A well made beer with no real flaws. Refreshing and crisp without being over the top with bitterness. Well balanced and very drinkable."
"-Beer distributor 6th and moore, South Philly"
"O: Not a bad beer, not necessarily better than other IPA's from the area, but different than most east coast IPA's, plus it's super drinkable!"
"Beer is medium in body and mildly hoppy on the midpalate region. The hoppiness gives way ultimately to a heavy finish with a strong malt...sweetness?...that's not the right word. It's heavier on the back half than the front half. Overall it's a decent EIPA, but I doubt I'd drink too much of it."
"Overall- pretty tasty IPA. I would keep coming back to this one."
"Overall - Go buy this beer. Im partial since this is a local brew, and i met the owner a few years back and he seemed like a pretty cool guy, but all of that stuff aside this is a very solid beer. This is a go-to IPA for me. and i would recommend it anyone, along with most other Yards brews. Definitely a beer you can drink a few of."
"Very drinkable, I like the touch of caramel malt flavor to back up the big hop bitterness."
"HV"
"An easy drinking beer that would be nice on a hot summer day."
"Taste is of obvious Amarillo hops, which is unexpected for an English IPA. Not as much malt sweetness as expected, which I like. There is something present in the flavor that I do not like. Slightly medicinal flavor I just can't put my finger on. Overall this is a tasty beer that I could enjoy a few of. Mouthfeel Is sticky and slightly cloying. A decent beer at a good price point."
"M/D: Medium bodied. A nice english IPA. Once in a while, it is refreshing not to drink a hop bomb, and this one fits the bill nicely. That 7% is a bit sneaky too."
"Drinks pretty nice. A good beer."
"clear amber gold with a big off white head. big citrusy hop aroma with some floral notes as well. Floral and citrus hops dominate the flavor at first before giving way to a sweet pale malt base. Some piney notes are present in the finish. medium bodied, slightly sticky with a good amount of carbonation. Pretty easy drinking. A nice take on the style but nothing extraordinary. I'm glad to have tried this and would drink more but wouldn't seek it out."
"A good beer both to look at and drink."
"D- this is an easy drinker if I've ever seen one. Tasty and easy going is the name of the game. On cask and fresh is what makes this brew great. Killer stuff."
"D- Solid IPA that can be a staple beer in ones fridge"
"Local brew from Philadelphia ale, India Pale Ale style."
"Drinkability: Goes down ok, sorta tasty, not too filling, well hidden kick, but not a very good representation of style. Oddly balanced and the hop was just... off. I would pass on this in the future."
"A solid IPA that definitely deserves a shout if you run across it!"
"D: Excellent. I could drink these"
"This beer pours a cloudy, brownish-orange color with no head or lace. The aroma has hints of licorice, molasses, and pine. It's flavor is mainly molasses with plum and toasted malt notes. It leaves a mildly bitter aftertaste that lingers. It's got a medium mouthfeel. Yards India Pale Ale is an average beer that could be rated higher if not for the lasting bitter aftertaste. Slightly recommended."
"I've only discovered craft beers in the last 9 months or so, and my favorite is Duvel. I've tried many kinds, including doppelbocks, landbier, several IPAs, german and belgian wheat beers, and have asked employees for their recommendations. This beer is so terrific, I could not resist telling the forum about it. I think you'll agree - this IPA is fantastic!"
"Drinkability - Very tasty beer and a somewhat milder IPA. Definetely work picking up a six pack."
"All in all, Yards IPA is solid English IPA that I can see myself drinking again in the future."
"If you're a fan of ESB's or IPA's that are more on the earthy side, this might be something you want to check out."
"Boils down to an overall English ale base with a thoroughly invigorating jolt of zingy, citrusy hops. Every time I have this, it's so damn difficult not to down it with authority. Consistently very tasty. Alcohol is vaguely present at the end, but it doesn't come close to interfering with the flavor - only your sobriety. Love it."
"Pours a nice moderate gold color with a bit of a copper tint. Good lacig and bead. Nose is pretty hoppy with some nice floral, herbal, and citrus components. Taste isn't quite as hoppy and adds in a touch of caramel. Dry and bitter; a bit resinous. Drinks quite well. Their best offering, IMO."
"d- okay, not a wonderful ipa, but it's drinkable. i would choose many other ipas over this one."
"Wow. Have had this brew in bottles many times and always dug it. Tonight had on draft while enjoying a sheppards pie. Fantastic! Delicious! Sweet tropical fruit and killer hop nose. Taste follows suit. Fresh on tap-- this is a killer brew. I'll be back at same bar tomorrow for more!! Really, a terrific IPA that falls more toward American vs. English. Go find a tap!"
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, nice kick, very good representation of style, this is a very solid beer that is worth drinking for a long time."
"D: All too drinkable, a wonderfully well-balanced IPA. That Union Jack on the label should leave no confusion as to its stylings, but the generic 'IPA' might lead one to expect an even more powerful dose of hops, more like we Yanks are used to. In that regard, this performs well: amply hopped and full of citrus...7% hides very nicely, too. Sure, I'd love to have more..."
"D: Could always drink this very nice IPA from Philly."
"I poured from a 12 ounce glass into a standard pint glass. It pours a clear copper with a 2 finger white head. It smells more like an American IPA, than and English. It has big tangy citrus on the nose. The flavor has lots of herbal and citrus notes and a nice long bitter finish. It is medium in body and well carbonated. A very solid offering."
"Drinkability - I would have no problem drinking a 6 pack of these. The 7% is nowhere to be found, I was surprised it was that high, seemed more like 4.5% to me. Great beer I could enjoy at any time."
"Pours a clear copper with a generously sized frumpy head with excellent retention. The head gradually settles in bubbly clumps like islands in a sea. The nose is very hoppy, wtih strong (and appealing) tropical fruity notes and orange zest dominating the aromas; sweet, caramelly malt aromas bring up the rear. Not a whiff of alcohol, despite the high abv. Smell is very enticing. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Tastes is good, if somewhat simple. Citrus zest hits the front palate before sweet caramelly malts dominate the middle. The finish lingers long with flavors like mandarins and butterscotch. All in all, this is one of my very favorite everyday IPAs."
"the beer is a nice clear copper color, with a thin white head that remains most the way through drinking. while the head is smallish, it leaves nice lacing. aroma is piney hops, bitter. that carries into the taste, as loads of hops is the main flavor. but really the only flavor I detect. the carbonation is moderate, the body average for the style. unfortunately too unbalanced for me to drink more than one at a time."
"D- Sessionable with a lower APV. Definitely a different taste for an IPA, but welcomed."
"Poured a dark amber cloudy color. Thin head. Not as hoppy as I'm used to for an IPA. British malts stand out. some initial sweetness. maybe some apricot or grapefruit notes. Crisp with subtle carbonation. I'm not a big fan of english IPA's but this was OK."
"D: Extremely balanced and goes down deceptively easy for a 7% ABV. I'll readily admit that I'm a big fan of West Coast IPAs, but this is a great change of pace."
"Poured into an American pint glass; cloudy amber with one finger of white, and good lacing. Smelled of pine, bitter herbs, and grass. Tasted initially of pine and bitter herbs, then dissolved to apple and citrus, finishing on a sweet'ish note. Very nice and surprising flavor progression. Medium bodied; not overly carbonated. Well hidden alcohol content has you thinking that this is a great session ipa."
"D: Overall this brew hits an interesting spot between English and American IPA with the musky, malty aroma saturated in orange, herbal hoppiness."
"D: If you have an appreciation for the English IPA, this Yards is an excellent, highly drinkable choice. The hops and malts are both big, and they are balanced well. I'm surprised by my own ratings here, but this is one solid brew, and I stand by them."
"D: You definitely should grab a friend to share a 6 pack with, because drinking one by yourself might seem more like a chore than a pleasure."
"Overall a really solid and quite sessionable IPA. Would not mind having this one again at all."
"pours a lightly cloudy copper orange color with large white creamy head and fair lacing. straw like malt flavor. citrus fruity hop smell,taste is the same plus some piney perfume hints. light body, thin slick texture and lively carbonation. slight bitter finish with a short flavor duration. could throw this beer back all night long."
"This is a very good brew, the first of many I will enjoy from this local brewery. Very good to session."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Poiurs a hazy coppery color witha nice two finger head. The smell and taste are dominated by a nice citrusy hoppy flavor. Very smoothe beer for 7% ABV. This would be a beer which you could very easily have too many. I would definitely drink again."
"12 oz brown bottle with no indication of freshness poured into a pint. Appears a hazy golden orange color with less than a finger of slightly yellowish stained fluffy foam for a head. Fair amount of lacing on the glass and minor powers of retension. Aroma of this beer is a pleasant mixture of citrus hops that lean slightly towards almost an orange-like fruit character and a bit of malt candy-like sweetness backing in the nose. Mixed in there is a bit of yeast character as well. Taste is pleasantly bitter with a good amount of hop flavors that again present themselves with a bit of bitter orange rind type of taste. Flavors also included are a bit of citrus and grass. Medium to light feel with a modest amount of carbonation. Fair amount of malt sweetness compliments the bitterness nicely. This is an overall nicely well rounded beer. The hops linger in the mouth with their bitterness being slightly exaggerated by the alcohol warmth that is present."
"D: This won't jump on you right away, but this is a very well-brewed IPA. Flavorful and hoppy without an intense bitterness. Definitely recommended - a really pleasant drinker."
"Drinkability: An excellent beer and easy to drink much of it. Good pairing with spicy foods. Another fine pale ale from Yards"
"Well done."
"This poured a clear dark gold with moderate off-white head. It smelled like pine and grapefruit and orange zest, with a bit of honey malt and peppercorn. It tasted like pine and grapefruit and orange zest, with a little light caramel malt. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a good but simple flavor, although it got a bit dirty in the lingering aftertaste. It had a nice body and was easy enough to drink. An enjoyable IPA, but ultimately mediocre."
"D: I could drink a lot of these, although the hops might get a little too much for me after quite a few. A very good beer to enjoy a few of."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice tasting and drinking IPA."
"I would love a case of this dangerous stuff given the abv...very good..."
"Really an interesting IPA. Never really had an English IPA before this one and I'm pleased with the product. I'd definitely purchase this again."
"Medium body and as drinkable as any American IPA."
" D- This beer ha a big glorious full hops flavor with good depth and layers of hops, making this a nice sipping IPA."
"Pours hazy copper with fluffy head. Aroma has a promising piny hop aroma. Flavor however is fairly mild, with a smooth carmelly taste, with a slight toasted nut character, like almonds. A little whiff of banana ester comes through. but a deep piny bitterness redeems it, though it develops slowly. Mouthfeel is creamy."
"D: Really great easy drinking IPA. Very impressed."
"Thanks Bobfinkenaur!"
"Thanks to edbeer for the Yards fix. 12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Poured a translucent copper with a sudsy, half inch, off-white head that settles into a fairly consistent skim that coalesces around the edges. Thick strands of lacing were revealed during the session and exhibited excellent adherence. Nose reveals caramel/toffee and a biscuity quality with a detectable hops presence in the back - somewhere between piny and grapefruit. Taste consistent with nose; however, the hops comes out upfront on a malt backbone - a little bit of alcohol comes out in the mix as well. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an oily quality and a present background effervescence. Tasty brew. I've found the English IPAs I've tried to be hit or miss, but this one is really excellent. Well worth your time if you have the opportunity to give it a shot."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into a standard shaker glass. The ale appears a hazed muted amber color with about a finger of creamy off white foam. Aromas and flavors consist of a nice balance of caramel malts, citrus and piney hops, lightly toasted bread, a bit earthy with more malt sweetness than your average IPA. But it works for this beer. The ale is medium in both body and carbonation levels with no noticeable alcohol heat. Certainly worth a try."
"D: 7% is definitely a surprise. Drinks pretty easy and is pretty tasty, even if it really isn't to the EIPA style."
"D - This is a really nice English IPA...Yard's has done a great job in my opinion with brewing traditional styles...this one gives you some hops...but provides a strong malt presence as well"
"D: very good. Loved it."
"I'm not by any means an IPA junkie and so I don't drink them enough to call myself well versed in the style, but this is my favorite IPA that I've ever head save for maybe the Dogfish Head 90 minute. Hides the abv well. This would make a good gateway beer for non-hopheads into the style."
"Served at the perfect temperature, just below room temperature, it allowed the fruit and malt flavors of this beer to bloom and express"
"Don't drink and review."
"M/D - Nice light mouthfeel is not sticky. Flavor lingers, easily drinkable."
"This beer is as balanced an IPA can get. Never one sided and quite smooth. Is pretty light feel as well."
"Personally: This is my kind of IPA; I believer that because Yards understand the brewing of bitters and are students of history - they pay careful attention to brew a IPA that it is a complex tasting hoppy beverage, as opposed to a one-note citrus blast to your tastebuds."
"Pours a hazy light amber color with unfiltered particulate and a shallow foamy head and that fades fairly quickly. Spotty patterns of lacing left behind. The smell is timid but sweet and floral. Visibly effervescent, the mouth feel is medium bodied and creamy with less zip that the bubbles suggest. The flavor is sweet and lightly hoppy. A reasonable drinker. Thanks out to corb112 for this extra."
"D- Very good balance and session drinkability."
"Pretty drinkable, a decent IPA."
"Full bodied and delicious. I'm so sad this is the last one in the case."
"Overal good, but to follow the style its not good."
"Dr. Very good. I could drink several of these if I could keep awake."
"Mouthfeel is filling and enjoyable. I would enjoy having more of these ona regular basis."
"Cask at Union Jacks. Yards IPA holds a bright golden color with off orange tints, topped with a white head, quite nice off the firkin. Smells of floral hops with some grapefruit and slight pine, backed by a good malt base. Taste the same with a slight bitterness, but not over the top since this is an english version IPA. A great feel from the cask, smooth and brisk with a abv not over the top leaving it very drinkable. I wish I had more. I've yet to try a bottle from yards since they changed location but this intrigued me to search them out again."
"D - A solid offering from Yards, but not a very memorable one... Hides the 7% ABV exteremely well... Solid in all categories... A richer fuller slightly more carbonated mouthfeel would add greatly to this brew... None the less, I would gladly welcome the chance to revisit..."
"Smell is somewhat floral hops, but there's a very barley like, wet grass smell as well. Not so sure about that, it's a little off putting. Taste is more of the same. Some more wet and moldy barley, or spent grains. A decent amount of bitterness in the mouthfeel. A mix between an ESB and a Pale Ale. Decent beer, but I prefer the American, or better yet, Californian version."
"Not what I think of when I see an IPA but it is worth a try for sure."
"Drinkability: Tastes good, good mouthfeel. Recommended."
"I'm usually a little skeptic on IPA's but this one is easy to drink and goes down very smooth."
"To me this is a really good IPA from Yards. Since i live so close i'll definitely be sampling more from this Brewery."
"The taste is good and is strong on malt then finishes with a nice hoppy bitterness. For a beer that is 7% it hides the alocohol well. A good IPA and good on price, its not too much."
"$29.99 plus tax for a case. My cheap go-to brew isn't so cheap anymore. Oh well like goes on. Appearance is amber and mostly clear with some suspension. Smell is hoppy - citrus, pine and earthy aromas and a bready malt presence as well. Taste is hoppy, but more subtle than an American IPA and a good caramel-like sweetness as well. Alcohol remains in the background. Mouthfeel is hefty due to ABV, but not overly so. Good carbonation level, but not quite crisp. Finish is bitter and dry. Drinkability is very good. Ahhh refreshing AND relaxing."
"Pretty easy to drink. I went through the first one so fast I had to pour another one for this review. A good everyday ipa that won't assault you into a hop coma."
"Poured strong down the middle of a smallish tulip. Huge head that drained away quickly. Some lacing, but not much. Nice caramel color. Based on what others have said about this beer, I chose to let this sit a bit to force of some of the carbonation and to warm it to traditional British serving temps. The nose has a slight maltyness and a strong bitter hop scent. I'd guess lemon pledge, with a bit of pear at the end. The flavor is of toasty malts. A bit of biscuit with a medium hop finish. There are hints of esters and alcohol. This is not your traditional American IPA. Much more like a traditional British style. I am glad I let the carbonation wane as it is still a bit frothy. Another good beer from the folks at Yards."
"D - The 7% ABV is hard to detect, but I'm sure after a few of these would be noticeable. Fairly drinkable, but I probably wouldn't be picking up more than one of these in an evening."
"I'd say Yards has settled nicely into the new brewery and hope they continue for years to come. Now it is time for them to start putting a ""bottled on"" or ""freshness"" date on their beers."
"Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is pretty low. Relatively easy to drink. I thought this was well rounded and delicious."
"Poured into a large Guinness Pint glass.Nice thick creamy head, and the beer itself is of deep gold hue. light, grassy, fruity hops dominate the aroma, but there is a bready hint of grain behind it all. A hint of bubblegum as well. Taste is herbal/grassy hops with just a bit of malt sweetness behind it to balance it, as well as a slight tannic/grainy flavor. The bitterness lingers on the tongue. Mouthfeel is medium in carbonation, and the body is a tad on the light side. This beer is quite drinkable for one or two, but overall it comes across as a bit abrasive. A good take on British IPA, and if you don't mind some rough bitterness, you just might love this one."
"D: Drinkability was fairly good making for a decent session, not to big , not to light thou not to exciting as well."
"Pours a foggy dark copper hue with a two finger rocky off-white head that stays around for a while. Stickiness is pretty damn good with a good amount of floaties in this one as well. Smell consists of musty dirt hops with a touch of fresh flowers. Crystal malts and faint citrus aromas tickle the nose as well. A good malty backbone up front on the tongue followed by sweet citrus. Bitter midway through to the finish with evergreen and a hefty amount of grains. Solid flavors from start to finish. Mouthfeel with this is much too harsh, leaves the tongue puckering. Body is medium with a steady carbonation. Not a bad brew overall, but the way it leaves the mouth takes away from the overall experience. Don't think I'll be drinking anything after I finish this, my tongue needs to recover. Thanks again Josh for the opportunity to try this one."
"My favorite from yards, by far. Much different but equal to the new Philly brewings Newbold. Would love to have these in fridge and just screams Philly."
"Since it hides the 7% ABV, I could see this as some kind of session beer. If you like your IPA's lightly hopped and very citrusy, then you'll want to try this one. For me, I wouldn't mind having another one of these."
"This is a pretty solid IPA and I would be glad to have this again."
"Pours a hazy orange-brown color with a rather small off white head. The smell is sweet with tropical fruit and orange aromas, some floral hop scents are noticable in the end. The taste starts off sweet then slowly turns bitter. You can almost feel it turn from sweet to bitter. Honey and tropical fruit flavors kick things off then are transformed into bitter citrus rind hops. The feel is light to moderate with fizzy carbonation and finishes bitter. Though it starts off sweet, it finishes quite clean with no slickness or stickiness. A muscular EIPA, seems a bit heavy on the malt and bitter hop. Not as carbonated as other Yard offering that I have sampled."
"A solid amber colored ipa with a huge off-white head and plenty of fluffy lace. The aroma is a unique mix of malty pine hops and apple cider vinegar. The taste is oddly sour with weak pine hops but some hefty grapefruit. There is again a sweet vinegar dominance, like a mash. The feel is very nice, a bit creamy but the sweet sour accent is a bit much for me. It mellows a little as you go. It is evenly carbonated and pretty easy drinking. This almost makes me think that it's a bad batch or maybe just spoiled a bit in this bottle. Not sure. If this is the real deal, then it's a litlle gnarly."
"There seem to be some flaws here, and if Yards dated their bottles I would know if it were too old. Alas, I have to take this beer at what it is."
"A delightful scent (really, why can't other IPAs smell this good?), a bit weak in the mouthfeel, but a great drinkability. A session beer for sure."
"Very nice beer. Would hold up well to a spicy dinner or a good steak."
"Drinkability: This is a good beer with a nice English character for a unique change of pace from West Coast IPA's."
"Pours a very cloudy amber gold that is pretty dark on the brownish side. Nose is a touch of orange and very slight hops. Flavor is very thick and robust. Subdued, but still firm hops abound. Woody aftertaste. Feel is thick on the liquid from ingredients. Overall very drinkable. Very steady with it's hearty attributes, it delivers a good drinking experience. I really like this beer a lot and would love to try it on cask."
"Conclusion: I've been drinking this beer for years. As IPA's go, this is still a solid choice that I always keep in the fridge. Cheers!"
"Smells of a peppery, citrusy nose..very appealing..long lacing down the glass and a pretty full head on the pour..I actually enjoyed this one more as it warmed. Nice abv..perfect balance of malts and hops, very drinkable. Decently priced and actually warmed ya up as you drank it. Peppery, hoppy, dry finish..Very fresh and a nice overall beer."
"D - Not bad for an IPA. I wouldn't have more than one at a time. I've had better, more drinkable IPAs but this wasn't terrible."
"This will for sure be a must buy for me.When you see Yards ipa try it out and support Philadelphia."
"Final Thought: The best of the four in the sampler case from Yards, a very memorable IPA that will have me buying a case of this sweet nectar the next time I am in Eastern PA..."
"Pours a clean orange-ish amber color, with a white head. Aromas of grapefruity hops, actually quite surprising. In the taste, grapefruity hops and a bit malty. It also has a dry hop aftertaste. A mellow IPA, smooth and a good hop presence. I have not had one in a while and actually forgot how good it was."
"I've certainly had better Yards. They have a whole lot of hits. This one is just a miss."
"Overall: Nothing to really write home about here. I thought it was a weaker attempt at an IPA, but with all of the recent 100 IBU, 10% monster beer it was a little refreshing to have something that you could have a few in a sitting and be none the worse off."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and strongly carbonated. This beer hides its 8%ABV well, and is a nice, shut-your-brain-off IPA for a warm day. At three bucks on Saturday and two bucks on Tuesday (if you're a lush), this stuff is a steal."
"Extremely drinkable ale here and I do like it. Only spot on it would be the big butter flavor, you will either love or hate."
"A fine sippin' beer year round!"
"Recommended, both bottle conditioned and from a cask. Cheers!"
"fairly easy to drink, especially for being 8%"
"Light mouthfeel,tangy with a juicy feel. Easy drinking would be a good summer IPA with the light feel. Good English IPA not outstanding,but enjoyable and worth a try."
"Pours out a clear copper red, with some very small chunkies if you look real close. Has an off-white head. Nose is sticky hops and slight malts and caramel. Taste is a balance between a hoppy bitterness and a slight sweet sugarcane taste. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good. A solid IPA."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a hazy, orangish-amber color. There is a fairly substantial off-white head on it. The aroma is mainly citrus hops. They are potent, but not over done. The taste is good. There is a decent hop bite, but not overdone. Nice malt backbone. A hint of dryness to the finish. A decent enough IPA."
"D: I'd like to try this on tap to see if the freshness adds more depth. If it doesn't, I'd stick to some of Yards' other offerings."
"Very odd flavors in this IPA yet I think I like it. A belgian spicey quality is showing through far back on the mid palate with a bitter floral ending. Entrance and front mid are lackluster and really don't show any depth whatsoever. One flowery beer too say the least. Good and bitter."
"Ahhh who cannot enjoy a great IPA? Citrusy aroma, appearance was cloudy/coppery color. It had nice lacing on the glass, but a diminishing head. It is a medium bodied beer, but great IPA style flavor. Excellent hop flavor, and nice finishing aftertaste. It has a nice juicy hop flavor, but not over the top. Overall a great beer, but then again, who cannot enjoy a good IPA?"
"D: Nice IPA, slightly hoppier than expected for an English IPA. Not as much spice as expected."
"Highly drinkable and easy to drink. At 7% packs a little kick, but doesn't kick your ass. Session this baby!"
"Very interesting combination of fresh floral hops and biscuity malts. The aromas are all leafy green hopiness with a slightly green malt aroma- very alive. Extremely forceful bitterness on the mouth at first but then a subdued sweetness from the malts. Very refreshing- certainly a departure from the heavier american IPA but a very nice change from the regular and mundane."
"Drinkability - Those looking for an extreme hop bomb may want to look elsewhere. This is a well balanced brew with something for everyone. It's very drinkable for a 7% beer. Be careful though, they'll catch up to you. I will definitely drink this beer again. Cheers!"
"Bought a case of this after a recommendation from a fellow hop-head, and this certainly did not disappoint. While not quite as flavorful as Victory's HopDevil, this brew does not disappoint with its rich citrusy taste, oak aroma and bitter hoppy aftertaste. This beer is a great representation of a British IPA and is highly recommended to other hop-heads and others who appreciate the style. Cheers!"
"Overall: I did not expect such an intense green hop presence from an English IPA. This is a good beer though."
"Hazy and straw colored with about a finger of white head. Honey and caramel most noticable in the aroma along with some earthy hops. Malty sweet flavor with a grassy/piney hop finish. Slightly woody and maybe a little toffee too. Medium/full bodied and well carbonated. Interesting beer, seems mostly English in style, but also a little American IPA twist thrown in there."
"Overall a very tasty and highly quaffable IPA. Amazing drinkability considering the hefty ABV. Much thanks to Aprilluvsbeer."
"Bitter, baby. Brutally bitter for a standard IPA. Big herbal bitterness. The cirtrus is barely detectable on the tongue. I really look for the malt to round this beer out, give it some more body but it is underwhelming next to the hops. Mouth is almost thin feeling due to the lack of balance. A bit harsh for my tastes but a decent enough IPA, Good for washing a turkey sandwich dow."
"Orange-red in appearance, with a nice head of off-white foam. Smells hoppy and flowery in nature. Taste is very sweet and very hoppy; citrus and flowery hops win out. Finish is dry and bitter, and wants of another sip or three. Carbonation is good (not sure what all the negative hubbub is about), and mouthfeel is rich without being too syrupy. ABV is 7% according to the case box, bottle and Yards website. English, eh? I still like it."
"This is a good example of a traditional English-style IPA. Certainly one to try if you are a fan of hops."
"This ones just great by me, especially considering the price ($.83!)"
"I don't believe this beer is balanced. But that's just me. I think it needs more aroma and flavor in order to balance out the bitterness. If you like bitterness that isn't over the top then this is a good beer for you."
"Quite good...I'll snag a case of this one the next time I visit Shangy's for sure."
"Drinkability: Very unusual and interesting hybrid; just not sure the combination works very well"
"Poured a hazy amber with a runaway head that was creamy white and fairly tight bubbles. It took a while for the head to settle in the glass so that I could drink it. Nice floral hop smell with some sweet malt as a base and a touch of vanilla. Maybe a little overcarbonated. The taste is a little strange at first. Up front is some slight sourness that almost has a hint of sour cherry, followed by an alcohol taste, followed by a long build of hop bitterness and finally an almost liquorice taste at the end of the hops. A little odd, but it grows on you. The mouthfeel has a slight amount of syrup to it but finishes quite dry, and the beer is not sweet at all. Given the abv of 8%, not bad. Its a little funky in its flavor and a little high in abv to drink much of this. Overall fairly interesting, but definitely a little different than most beers of this style. The fruitiness sometimes found in american ipas seems to be more of sour fruit flavor here."
"The taste is initially sweet, but then starts to pick up some biting hop notes almost immediately. It finishes with a lightly herbal, lightly astringent, hoppy bitterness that lingers on for some time on the tongue. Perhaps the hop character is a bit grassy as well, but only just. Barring the initial sweetness, the malt character is actually quite dry. It leans towards the toasted grain side of the spectrum, with notes of biscuit malt, and perhaps even some notes of stale malt extract. Besides the bitterness, which seems spot on for an IPA, this beer seems to be missing quite a bit of hop character; choose either English hop character or American, but add something here to balance the bitterness and malt notes."
"I would usually want to put away a few of these, of course it would get the better of me, but darn it it's good."
"this is my favorite beer that i've had from yards, although i have enjoyed them all. pours with a nice white head on an amber body. fairly well carbonated. hoppy, kind of orangey odor. smells very fresh and clean. delicious taste...super hopped like the hops are still in the bottle. becaomes smooth and easy to drink after the first couple of quaffs. Very enjoyable and i'm glad i have a couple more in the fridge (thanks dad!)"
"A good summer brew, I think, especially with spicy food. I'm not much of a hophead, but this IPA would be well received by that demographic."
"D - SOOOO drinkable! Unbelievable that this is 8% abv. An outstanding PA beer! Thanks to Maltygoodness for the bottle."
"This is nice and drinkable, but I think it lacks a strong enough malt background, leading to a bit of an imbalance and some excess in bitterness. With warming, however, the malts begin to rise up and create a better balance which improves the drinkability. I enjoy the flavors."
"Essential."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink. Almost to easy to drink for an 8% abv, but I'm not complaining. I really like this one."
"I enjoyed this, even though it's not the best IPA I've had. A good brew certainly worth trying once, I plan on looking into Yards' other offerings in the near future!"
"This pours a reddish amber with a large foamy tan head. The smell has a real hop aroma. This smells just like grapefruit juice, cascade hops run rampant. A nice aromatic treat. The taste, like the smell, is a hop overload. The cascade hops make this a citrus marvel. This is very refreshing and delicious. The m/f is light and crisp with a well balanced flavor,but it could use some more body. This is a very good beer,but I could see were the citrus flavor could get a bit overwhelming."
"All in all a decent IPA. The previous version was a little more ""English"" in style which was a nice change of pace for American made IPAs. However, this one is very drinkable (despite the claimed 8% abv) so I will go back for it occasionally."
"Overall- an amazingly easy IPA to gulp down! 1 of the better IPA's I've ever had. Yards hasn't disappointed me yet!"
"Its Bitter and its good."
"This is a damn fine IPA, although it might be big for an English. Delicious and very well made. Hoppy, fruity, bitter, malty, and alcohol well hidden. Highly recommended."
"Strong bitter hops dominate the flavor. Quite spicy. The bitterness stays with you."
"D - Not my favorite for the style but definitely interesting. It might be the sweetest IPA I've ever had (American or English style) and I could see it as a great change of pace IPA every now and then. Thus it's uniqueness and balance make it very drinkable."
"Thanks to kafkaEsb (remember him?) for the chance to taste this. Yummy beer."
"poured a slightly hazy, medium color with attractive white puffy hwad that slowly fell to a light coating that lasted throughout the glass. Smell is a pleasant mixture of toated malt and hops. Initail taste assaults with much malt which slowly lessens as the hops take over. Excellent combination. Finished is a strong bitter hop presence. This is a very drinkable beer. I really could not detect the 8% alcohol."
"from the bottle poured a golden color with a off white head with some lacing. aroma citus a blend of grapefruit and lemon, with a touch of malt and fruity. flavor, citrus, pine, and caramel. good easy beer to drink. dont know if I bought this or got it in a trade, if it was a trade thanks to the one that sent it."
"Very nicely drinkable IPA. Had this one by itself on the porch, in a koozie on the boat, and in a plastic glass late evening on the beach. Very warmable to the mouth and head, but crisp enough to be a solid summer drinker as well."
"Great English IPA, which you don't see all that many of."
"Mouthfeel was fine, perhaps a bit viscous, but no real faults. Drinkability was nice and I would definitly have another. Too much alcohol for a session beer, but the taste is right. Kind of like a hopped up English Style IPA. Not really west coast due to the buttery and malty notes, but definitly more hoppy than the standard english style."
"This had a foamy, off-white/close to tan in color, head. It was not as thick, IMO, more fragile of a head than that on the saison. The beer itself was a cloudy orange/amber color. There were plenty of hops on the nose, but you will have to forgive me since I (still) don't have the knowledge to be able to identify specific hop varieties. It had a medium mouthfeel and the hops were big in the mouth. The beer had a viscous, syrupy quality in the glass, but it did not translate to the mouthfeel. The finish was an interesting intermingling of hops and malt. If only it wasn't 8 % ABV, I could rate ""drinkability"" higher."
"Not a lot of head, probably partially due to the higher alcohol content. The beer is slightly cloudy as well but that's not really a knock since its bottle conditioned. Cool label with the Union Jack under a pair of crossed swords. The aroma is not very powerful, which surprises me, and its also a little ""muddy", by which I mean its kind of hard to discern any real characteristics individually - everything kind of runs together. Its kind of herbal, thats' about the best I can do. The flavor is good, again a bit ""muddy"" but clean, featuring a prominent hop bitterness but not a lot of hop flavor or malty compliment. Overall, its a pretty good beer, but it doesn't exactly knock my socks off."
"taste was outstanding. The blend of malt and hop in the english style IPA was perfect. Teh blend allowed all the flavors to meld very well together and not be overly sweet or bitter at all. This one easily rivals my HopDevil for one of the best IPAs I have tried to date."
"Moderately thick creamy white head is really sticky leaving a thick coating of lace as it slowly fades. Mild citrusy hop aroma. The flavor has a light malt base with some tasty citrusy hops on top that become grapefruity bitter towards the end. Mouthfeel is soft and light. A solid enjoyable IPA."
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"Overall-another fine beer from Yards and a fine stab at the English I.P.A. not entirely balanced but the hop attack is appreciated from this drinker. Give this one a shot."
"Poured a hazy gold with a frothy head that stayed with the beer all the way to the end. Hoppy and slightly fruity aroma. Sharp and tingly on the tongue, with tangerine and a touch of apricot in the hops. Reminds me a bit of Bear Republic's Racer 5. Hops bittering flattens out at the end, and the finish is refreshingly dry, without astringency. Very nicely done - only the abv rules this out as a session ale. Thanks to bro far333 for this treat."
"Flavors carry through on the nose, with the caramel moving to the forefront. Bitterness is at a moderately high level and there is a good amount of malt supporting it all. Solid beer, and that 8% alcohol will definitely sneak up on you."
"Murky looking orange amber tone. Very slgiht off-white head. A bubbly collar leaves spotty lace. The aroma is fragrant and minty. Something I'd expect more out of an AIPA than an EIPA. Toasted malts are prevalent and all in all, this has a good nose. The taste is very pleasing. The fragrant and minty characteristics are held in check on the tongue. Toasted malts form a very nice base. A little toffee and butter as well. The hops add a lot of character. In addition to the slight minty/perfumey tones, there's a nice flowery aspect. Some herbal accents as well. Just a very agreeable taste with me."
"($1.43 / 12 oz.)"
"update 2/05: this beer *always* makes me want another one. Very dangerous."
"Drinkability and Overall: As with most Yards offerings, it's kinda bland. It's a solid representation of the style, but does nothing for me. The 8% ABV seems a bit too much, and really kills the drinkability."
"tasty to a degree, but too strong, and too carbonated."
"Yards IPA could be an excellent version with one simple fix. Repair the disaster that is the carbonation (bottle-conditioning) and the result could well be something worth celebrating. Thanks to blitheringidiot for the bottle."
"Pours a pretty orange color with some floaties with a nice fluffy 2 finger head man it looks good. Nice grapefruiety with some oranges thrown in on top of some sweet smelling bready malt after pour some floral notes also coming out this is a nice smelling beer. Taste is sweet crystal malt some caramel sweetness coming thru then nice hop flavors juicey not intense enough for grapefruit something like lightly bitter peaches finishes with a lingering bitterness and nice pine resin coating of the tounge. Mouthfeel is very solid for IPA very nice. Drinkability is good wishing I had more then this one sample have something else to put on the list I need to purchase on road trips. Getting to the point I want be able to try any new beers if I keep finding stuff I enjoy enough to buy more then one of :) life is hard. When I saw this was a English IPA was afraid I would not like it why are some the other English IPA's just bland pale ales?"
"Nothing too distinguishable about this IPA except for its drinkability, mysteriously high for its high ABV. It somehow manages to come across as mild despite its strength, which is a good characteristic."
"Apricot-honey colored, with an off-white weak head that settles unevenly. Aroma is low, and about equally malty as it is hoppy. Flavor is big hops, right upfront. Not big like a double IPA, but a good size serving of citrus hops right on the front of the tongue, and then it rolls nicely down the back and sides of the tongue, leaving a nice tingle at the back corners. Some malt rides beneath it, and an orange peel bitter lingers. The best I've had from Yards so far."
"Taste mirrors the nose, with bittersweet orange and grapefruit in the lead. Hops are rarely bitter, in spite of the IBU rating. Malt profile seems understated for an English style IPA, but this is a tasty brew from start to finish. The finish has a slight bitterness, that is more citrusrind than pine, and contributes to a good drinkability."
"Pours out a hazy amber color with about an inch of white foam head forming on top. Not much retention but it did leave a bit of lace as this was consumed. Aroma had citric hops and a fruity sweetness mainly. There were notes of floral hops as well but overall the smell was a bit muted. Taste starts of with grapefruit bitterness but not a lot before a small amount of malt comes through. After taste was a bit dry and bitter, even at a whopping 8% alcohol for an IPA I could detect none in the nose or taste. Body is about medium with a clean fully carbonated feel to it. Pretty drinkable stuff, a little sweeter than I like my IPAs but an above average brew."
"Hazy sort of copper color.Very slight head.Nice aroma-somewhat floral,citrusy and a tad spruce like. Big malty flavor-good sweetness upfront-grassy,grapefruit like on the palate.Nice body-very oily. Quite drinkable-the 8% would definately sneak up on you. Enjoyable all around."
"Finally Yards is in CT so I picked up a bottle of this stuff. Pours out a nice orange color with little carbonation visible but lacing was there on the glass all the way through. Smell was alright. Hops were in there, but it was yeasty and quite fruity. Some malts in the background could be detected as well. Taste was ok. Hops were there and quite a bit of fruit blended in as well. Bitterness did hit somewhere in the end, but not as big as I was expecting it to be. I would of liked to see a little more malt flavors blending in, but not completely taking over the hops in this brew. The 8%, which seems on the high end scale of a regular IPA can be noticed as well at the end/aftertaste. A little bit above average."
"Great hoppy bite, peppery and flavorful, grapefruity and rindy. Such great flavor and feel with the perfect amount of carbination and body. Easy drinking good IA. Yummers."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Overall I find this a solid English IPA and will go back to it on those rare days when I'm not in the mood for overwhelming hop flavor."
"I had this at the independance brewpub in the philly airport, that have a few other yards on tap including a flying fish tap and they also have some of the best roast beef sandwhichs that I have ever had, they even will give clarks ale house in syracuse a run for there money."
"Kinda cloudy light amber body. The cloudyness could be from pouring the whole bottle into my glass. It's bottle conditioned. Big light brown head with some lace. Lightly sweet floral hop aroma. A little sweetnes at the start and straight to the hops. Good smooth hop finish with a hint of grapefuit in the back there somwhere. Next time I'll be more carful with the pour."
"Drinkability: For the ABV, it's very drinkable, even down to the last drop. You definitely start to feel the alcohol by the end but the ABV is masked very well. I would drink another right off if I had one."
"12 ounce bottle. A nice English IPA."
"12 oz bottle, no freshness dating, English flag on label, so we know what kind of IPA this is supposed to be. pours orange light amber, cloudy, excellent head retention, extensive lacing. Soft, creamy mouthfeel. Soft malty nose. Balance in the British style is what we have going on here. Malt/Hops in balance. Well done, British style IPA. Hop cravers will feel slighted, but balanced beer lovers will rejoice. Tasty stuff, well worth a try."
"ng"
"pours a nice cloudy amber/orange colour with a nice big head and yeast floating about in the liquid. nice stuff. hops dominate the smell with malt and sweetenss in the back. there is a touch of spice present as well. the taste here is a solidly good one, but it's nothing outstanding. there is a hop/bread flavouring throughout with a sweet/semi-juicy middle and a decent dry finish. this is your pretty basic ipa. much more typical of the east coast versions (obviously, as that's where pennsylvania is) than the super hopped west coast ipa's. this one easy drinking and tasty over all. give it a shot."
"Some are maltier, and some are hoppier, but this one has found its way nicely. The balance and flavor craft a tasteful profile and the sassy hops bring a fresh and refreshing character to the fore. It does have a rather sneaky ABV, because I never noted it in the nose or the palate, but I did in my head after the second of these. Still, it goes down smoothly and gladly, and my hand just couldn't help reaching for another. While I know it's not everyone's cup of tea, I have to say, I'm glad this one's local and available, because it's destined to become a dependable favorite for me."
"D&N: A very nice IPA, sort of similar to a HopDevil in taste and aroma. Very drinkable."
"Fluffy, white, finger high head that leaves quickly. Hazy orange colour with a red tinge. Flower like scent with a touch of hops off in the distance. Surprised by the malt, it is blended nicely within the citrus this beer brings forth upon first sip. Subdued hop flavor then finishes with the bitterness. Smoothed out mouthfeel, this is when the alcohol makes its presence known. Not at all unwelcome as it is with some brews. I'm used to the super hopped up westcoast IPAs, but this is a nice depature from what i see as normal."
"a fruity ipa of soft bitterness, this one is english in style all the way. would be more quaffable if it weren't for the 8% ABV. nice change of pace from the alpha male-type aggresive american ipa's of today. i'd like to try it on cask."
"Drinkability: Really up there. At 8% ABV and 70 IBUs this is a big guy who drinks like a beer with half those numbers. Very easy to put back. Wonderful beer."
"The beer is the color of tanned leather with light head. The aroma is a little faint, but the flavor is very malty with a short bitter finish. This is definitely thicker and maltier than than most. It made for a nice change of pace in our IPA tasting."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent surrounded by floral aroma hops. The taste is good. It has an intense malty core which is quite tasty, but it also brags of an intense bitter hop addition; nice flavor. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a med/full bodied beer with less than adequate carbonation. This beer came straight from the brewery so I don't think it had enough time to bottle condition. This is a different tasting IPA, but it's good nonetheless."
"I'll be sampling this one again."
"Like the Dogfish Head 60, the Yard IPA pours a cloudy amber, but it has a voluminous white, pillowy head that recedes slowly and shifts shapes as it does. The small is singular: citrusy (predominantly lemon) hops--even the 8% alcohol is covered by this aroma. However, the alcohol is quite evident in the taste; it is the first ingredient that I noticed balancing the hops. They say this has 70 IBU. That's clear. They also say (on the very British label) that the ""agressive ale is fruity and balanced."" Again, I'd agree. While individual aspects are distinguishable, nothing dominates. There's bitterness, and some fruit (more like cherry than anything). There's alcohol and even some underlying breadiness. The mouthfeel is prickly and medium thin. It's a happy brew."
"Thanks to beerluvr for some of Philly's finest."
"This hit the spot in a way I can't really describe. It smells pretty good. It's head didn't last too long, but it had a nice lace throughout. The taste was pretty darn good. A nice hops taste but a strong malt profile as well. The hops didn't overpower, but it was strong at the same time. This was an excellent, drinkable IPA. Hopheads may want more hops, but this was just right for me. Relative to alcohol content, very drinkable."
"Pours an orangy amber hue with a thick, fluffy beige head that sticks around for a bit. Nice lacing left in the pint. Big hop aroma, zesty and floral. Crystal malts and alcohol also prevalent in the nose. Initially puckering because of the bitterness of the hops, but mellows a bit towards the maltier, sweet side, and finishes with the same dryness attributes by the hops. A bit on the alcoholic side for an IPA style, but by no means ludicrous. Pretty well rounded. Drinkability is moderate considering its ABV."
"This bottle conditioned brew poured a clear bronze with a small off white head and lot's of lacing down the glass. The smell was hoppy, earthy, grassy and a touch of sweetness. I love the taste of this brew. It seems very well balanced, not over the top with hops (which I also enjoy from Stone, Victory, etc...) but there was a really nice mesh of hops with malt sweetness. The abv is 8% but this seemed very drinkable. The mouthfeel was crisp in the beginning but mellowed out in the end. Overall, a ""milder"" IPA than I've had recently, but very nice drinking. There is a certain characteristic in the Yards brews (this and the ESA) that I really enjoy --- not sure how to explain it, but I like it a lot."
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 05OCT03, this post is based on notes from that review. -"
"Seemed to me like more of a British-styled version of an IPA. Not memorable, unfortunately."
"Although this isn't nearly as hoppy as most other IPAs, this surely isn't a bad beer. This reminded me more of the Sam Smith-style British IPAs than of most other American brews."
"Pours with a moderate caramel colored head over gently carbonated clear amber liquid with glimpses of red/gold seen within. Rich and malty nose with notes of super toasty and somewhat chocolatey maltiness present along with some yeast fruitiness. Some background hoppiness shows up late. The taste is strong and chewy maltiness, biscuity sweet and fruity , then a nicely intergrated hop bitterness intertwines into the proceedings to blend perfectly. Finishes balanced and utterly drinkable. The 8 percent alcohol is barely noticeable...so imbibe with caution!"
"Translucent, amber honey-golden hue. Smallish white head with fair retention that produced small webs of lace. Respectable nose, soft tropical fruit mixed with raw citrusy hops and kisses of malt, inviting. Superior palate fruity yet bitter with citrusy hops leafy, dry, and raw yet there are peachy undertones. The malt plays a supporting role. The alcohol is scarcely noticeable in the flavor but the high abv makes an appearance in your brain. Complex enough. Meager carbonation, medium-light body, thin yet the mouthfeel is decent. I really enjoyed this IPA hopefully Ill quaff it again."
"I love this beer! Bright copper with a voluminous tan head. Hop aroma smacks you around from afar, with malt sweetness noticeable from about six inches. All well constructed and inviting. The taste is very hoppy, with a distict sharp resinous note. Possibly single hopped? There's also some malt sweetness pushing through as well. This enjoyable power struggle between malt and hops is endless, yet the beer seems haromnious in its crafting. Huge malt base lends to a smooth mouthfeel. This is very drinkable. I was surprised to learn it was 8% ABV, but the strong maltiness should have been a clue. I did not notice the alcohol at all. Surprisingly drinkable, surprisingly hoppy, surprisingly good. I think I'm a hop-head."
"Poured a deep copper/orange color with medium head that left some decent lacing,smell was pretty balanced nutty malt with a herbal hp note.taste is pretty rough around the edges there is some zesty grapefruit-like hop hit ya first with a nice malty lingering taste.Pretty thick I think for the style,with a few tune ups this could become a really good brew."
"-F"
"Overall, this is an English style IPA I'm glad I tried but would not seek out again...I don't care for the ""bubblegum"" nose...and it finishes on a bit of a sour note...to me there is no real hop bite to it that I expect in an IPA...but as I mentioned this is a substnatial brew...maybe it's just not my type....real tart taste and finish...like raspberries...just not my bag of tea...definitely worth one try at least though.."
"Recently had a few of these with a nice steak dinner. Bottle conditioned, and really very carbonated. The head was tall, thick, and stable. Mild hop aroma, mixed with grass, resin, and mild fruit smells. Appearance is a cloudy, copper-orange color. Pleasant malt up front that dissipated into a closing dryness.again, the beer has a resin-like quality. Nice bitter and dry finish. Highly carbonated through the glass, the beer has a prickly, spicy character at times. This one hides its alcohol very well; I could have had these all night."
"On the tongue, big earthy (even peaty) malt character slams into pungent hops with a fleeting sour note. Man-o-man, anyone who's tasted enough IPA's knows we're straying into not-too-many-of-these-before-driving-or-even-talking-to-a-stranger territory. and knows that this is no standard IPA. Somewhat on the heavy side, wisely keeping the drinker from overdoing it. Big beer fans should find it interesting. Red Hook IPA fans might actually dislike it."
"Copper brown body with heavy deep ruby tint. Aromas are much more prominent--they just overload your nose with floral fragerances and smells of citrus and hops. The head just looms on top for what seems like an eternity. I though the bottle was kinda watery tasting in terms of mouthfeel but it is much, much better on cask. Its 'frothy' and has such a delicate balance on your tongue that every sip made you say 'ahhh'. Much more flavor comes out of the cask. Pretty much the same flavors as bottle but they just hit ya 5 times harder. Though it cost me 4.50 a pint it was damn drinkable to the dispair of my wallet. After two it was still interesting me more because it is THAT much different from the bottle."
"I like this IPA but not as well as others. The fact that it is so high in alcohol is intriging. The taste is great, but I can't seem to get used to the Yards yeast strain. The beer itself is extremely smooth and very drinkable. In fact, I would never guess the ABV. The hops seem to mellow out and give off a smoky character towards the middle of the beer. There are noticeable fruity hints that come to attention. The beer has a classic IPA dry finish that makes you realize the quality of this brew."
"Hops are most evident in the aroma when you pop open the bottle, but not as strong as I would have liked. This same subdued hop character is also present in the flavor. Malts are a little more dominant than I would like as well. Has a nice crisp dryness to the finish."
"A very interesting and a bold IPA."
"My understanding behind Yard's IPA was to create what they feel is a ""historically"" more accurate interpretation. A taste profile that attempts to come close to the original English style of more then a 100 years ago. Did they hit it?, how the hell am I supposed to know, but it was quite good."
"Very interesting to say the least, when I cracked the bottle the aroma is what captivated me. I just never smelled anything like this before, it's different. Pours a very nice copper amber tone with an off white nice full head, and it leaves nice even rings of lace down the glass. The aroma is a sharp astringent nut sweetness with a discombobulated hop aroma that has me scratching my head, and there is also a meanstreak of metallic offness. Very unique IPA, not what I was expecting but it's not horrible or amazing, it lies somewhere in the middle of the road. The taste is full of bitterness, but it has a light almond astringency to it. The sweetness comes in a very quick sprint that rapidly turns to a dryness of bitterness on the tongue. I am not loving this bottle, but it is alright. Can't drink this stuff, just to unbalanced between hops, metal?, nut flavors, and malt."
"I can only describe the mouthfeel is ""spritzy," like drinking soda. Dominated by hop flavor and a strange astringent metallic taste. This isn't a bad IPA, but it's nothing to rave about either. I've had much better American IPA's. I did appreciate the 8% ABV though, it had a nice warming effect."
"The flavor of this one is a little bit bitter. It has some spicy hops, and an unusual level of sweetness for an IPA. It was pretty crisp on the tongue which made it a pleasure to drink. I would have to say the flavor ratings were dropped because of the low hop level. It had an interesting flavor, but I want more hops."
"Acquired via trade. Blurry amber color with a thin off-white head. Very thin lacing. Mostly hops aroma with some malt. Flavor consists of hops, citrus and some malt. Actually there was more malt in the flavor than in any IPA in recent memory. It didn't hurt the flavor at all though, and actually made the finish more subdued than in most IPAs. The jury is out as to whether that makes it more complex or more boring. Maybe both. Either way this was decent."
"No head at all, with a medium-copper color. The aroma is a bit weak, mostly caramel malt and a decent fruity hop boquet. Flavor is big on grainy malt, more caramel sweetness, and a strong bitter finish. Medium-light body. Drinkable, but not especially memorable -- no real outstanding flavor characteristics, and not as smooth as some of the other IPAs."
"A very weak head. It's rather unfortunate about that, as it is a rather good beer that follows it up. Fairly clear and red. Wonderful spicy and hoppy aroma. The hops in the flavour are very well balanced by malt sweetness, with a good touch of spice as well. I was shocked to see the 8% abv when I looked at the bottle - this covers better than the equivalent strength belgians (& Unibroue) that I usually rave about in that aspect. Absolutely Fabulous (the beer is, I never cared much for the TV show...)"
"Overall a pretty tasty beer, but nothing spectacular. A little light on the hops for my tastes, seeing as this is an IPA. It leaves no lace and forms an insignifigant head. The flavor is thin, but complex with a nice bitter aftertaste. Hard to believe that this is 8.0 ABV. It's a beer that has a lot of potential but just doesn't seem to try very hard. If it were more full bodied, and had a more noticeable hop presence, it could be great."
"This beer poured into the glass a apricot/burnt orange color. The head is a white/vanilla colored that seemed to start foamy and end as a skim. The lace surprised me and lasted quiet long. The aroma was fruit hops, and some yeast and bread malt. The taste started off slightly sweet then the yeast flavor came into the front. Then fruit dominated the rest with hops then ended a little dry and earthy. Some alcohol was present but very little. Not the best for this style, but I would give it another try at another time."
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a fluffy off white head that shrinks to a thin layer and leaves a lot of lace. Aroma was fruity hops with a nice bit of yeast and bread like malt smells too. Much more sweetness up front than expected, pears, plum and peach fruitiness with less truly bitter hop flavor than expected. Earthy hop bitterness on a drying finish that doesn't really last long. Good IPA, nicely drinkable without being over the top on hop bitterness as the trend seems to be for American IPAs. This tasted more like an English offering. I would drink more of this but only recomend it if someone was seeking a sweeter, less hopped IPA."
"This beer started out as a nice, strong, flavorful IPA.  Big on the dried apricot aroma.  Thick mouthfeel to back up high english-style IBUs.  Alcohol is there.  But the beer's sryupy sweetness became too much towards the end.  Still tasty though."
"Rather coarse head, but nice, white, and fluffy. OK, the first one I had was definately bad. Fruit, hops, mango, still the same from the first time. The main difference was the taste. THis was so much better the second time around. It was bitter and hoppy, like an IPA should be, but not in the disgusting way it was the first time. I'm glad I gave this beer a second chance. I wouldn't call this trinkable in a tradiational sense, however it was appetizing in a hearty way. It had a lot of bitterness, along with toasted grains and a little malt. The dominating flavor, though, is certainly the hops. The only flaw was that I feel it was not as balanced, in maltiness, as an IPA should be."
"Nice orange-copper color, but the fluffy white head dissipated almost immediately. The aroma is yeasty, earthy, mineral, fruity, light hop, some malt. The flavor is big fruit with a good mouthfeel, some maltiness, and an intense hoppy bitterness in the finish. Long lasting fruity/malt/bitterness but without being cloying. The alcohol is a bit too evident throughout but a good beer nevertheless."
"Not a bad IPA, although I had hoped for more. The aroma is good, offering floral notes and some piney sort of resin to boot. However the flavor was, for whatever reason, a step or two behind. Very crisp and light on the palate. Still better than alot of brews out there. The head is nice and laces pretty well. Worth a try if you can get it. Prost!"
"Quite  a good classic example of this style.  If lots of big yeast in your beer turns you off do not buy this product.  I can just imagine this is what they drank in tankerds on those saiboats to india in the 15th century.  If you want a good sturdy bottle conditioned IPA this is a good choice.  Watch out matey 8% ABV..."
"Notes: A really really good replica of the lost style, alcohol is quite noticeable from both warmth and ester. An IPA in the raw."
"Pours a copper-ish color, with a decent head. Tiny hints of fruitiness and citus in the aroma. Light but firm, crisp body. The same on the palate a mild citrus, fruits, alcohol noticed, herbal, earthy. Stays true to the original English style IPA. Really enjoyable!"
