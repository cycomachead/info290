The depth of character found here; and the freshness that it displays are impeccable. The roundness of it running across wide swaths of malt, various hops, and a solid yeast character are rarely found anymore; and in combination with it's spot-on balance of sweet malt and raspy hop flavor and bitterness, it's an exceptionally drinkable English+American hybrid IPA. Brilliant!","NeroFiddled","Aug 12, 2014"

3.73,4.2,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"first brew from shed, a decent American English hybrid, with some of the best features of both. the nose is heavy citrus hops, but its balanced well by a sturdy dose of sweeter caramel colored English malt that's a bit sweet. the beer drinks on the heavy side, which is unfortunate this summer season. the malt just gives a lot of body, while the hops don't get to be fully bitter as a result. this is a heartier ipa, a mans beer in some sense. I do get some bitter in the finish, centennial or cascade style, with that oil component. Vermont makes some of the best india pale ales on the planet, but this isn't one of them, it is suited better for fall though, like most English styles I think, but maybe that's just me. I am still looking forward to trying the mountain ale, as the craftsmanship of this beer is solid, and perhaps another beer might be a better platform for it to work. a good widely available and affordable sixer though, and im sure ill be drinking this again while I am back east.","StonedTrippin","Jun 17, 2013"

3.68,2.8,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.75,"The label also read "Unfiltered" so I went with a medium-handed pour, not aggro but not gentle, either. This resulted in at least two fingers of dense, tawny head with great retention. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was redolent with grapefruit-citrus hops and my mouth was watering as a result. Mouthfeel was very soft, allowing the citrus hops to really shine. Finish was definitely dry, but not so dry as to leave me gasping for air. I did an agitation for my second pour and released the lees as a result. I guess that it depends on what you like. Personally, I do not mind the lees and like them as a separate/final pour. No problem there. One final thought - I am unsure that this is an EIPA. It tastes more like and AIPA.","woodychandler","May 12, 2013"

I can't quite understand how this can be called an ipa. It's a dark-colored malty ale, with very little hop character.

Aromas of grapefruit, light toffee, and floral hops. Very smooth and well balanced nose. Flavors of roast toffee initially, immediately followed up by floral and bitter hops that completely take over the palate. Cedar, cut grass, and sap all blend to represent the hopping in this brew, and the citrus tones shine through at the end of the palate to add some tartness to the bitter aftertaste. The malt profile literally disappears by the aftertaste. Light, crisp mouthfeel, with a bitter, slightly drying finish. Solid brew, with flavors stronger than the looks and ABV would lead you to believe.","GarthDanielson","Dec 05, 2012"

Smells of citrus and earthy hops with some bread and caramel maltiness to provide balance. A hint of mineral water and a touch of orange and lemon round out the nose nicely. The flavor is a bit more focused on the malt than the aroma lead me to believe. Sweet bread, cracker, and caramel malts countered with earthy and citrus hops. Long lingering hop bite at the end of every sip. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a bitter slick mouthfeel. I'm pretty impressed with this bottled version, its been years since I enjoyed any of the beer I've had at the brewpub. This is actually a pretty good gateway IPA.","johnnnniee","Nov 14, 2012"

Pours a dull, tangerine hue with a slightly hazy clarity and a dense, creamy, three inch, cream-colored head - this beer looks great in the glass. Nose expresses citrus rind and an earthy character. Taste follows nose; however, there is a pleasant, toasted malt character. Citric acid is interspersed throughout the flavor profile and finishes with a slightly earthy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body (but closer to light) with a lively, almost prickly carbonation. Acidity lightly stimulates the palate and sides of the cheeks.
