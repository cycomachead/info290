"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer to drink for a while but there are better choices within the style."
"O: very well done;"
""
"Great Amber color. This beer tries to go for the English style IPA but seems to have too much of an American taste. At first sip it tastes great but the after taste is very bitter."
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. Good herbal flavors, but a bit bland and heavy on the bitter. Far from being one of Victory’s best, but it’s hard to find anything by them out here on the left coast so I’m savoring it just the same."

""
"O: pleasant."
""

"This bottle was a good, other than not having a great head, this beer smalls and tastes great.  The hops are bright and clean for English hops.  Well made in IMO.  I'm surprised at the low ratings others have given this."

"O- If it wasn't for the grassy finish I will really enjoy this beer.  I feel this beer is a miss for me I still can't wait to try the next Moving Parts."

"Pretty good. Kept picking up a wintergreen flavor at the beginning."

"a very interesting english pale, drinkable by the gallon in my book. pretty classic look and aroma, but the flavor is something very different beyond simply the addition of more hops than the english ones usually have, more than just bitterness, but before the hoppy finish there is something else, almost a spice profile. i literally taste cinnamon and clove in the middle of the malt center here, it only flashes in for a second, but its a little sweet and does something interesting for the beer, brings richness out of the grain, and brings spice and zestiness out of the hops, not sure if its actually spiced or not, but it certainly seems that way to me, but its gone before the finish. the yeast profile is minimal, hard to even pick it as english for me, with all the other flavors going on, but this is really good, and its really cheap. im so glad we have fuller victory distribution here in colorado now, i have wanted these beers for a long time, all of their stuff, so its fun getting in to them a little bit. under 5 bucks is a steal for a bomber of this."

"Light on the hops which is typical of English beers.  A bit of sour fruit finish.  Just a so so IPA."
""
"There was very low aroma on the glass I had also the bitterness balance with the sweetness was a little off putting for me."

"The cask serving may have held back the look, it lacked the bubbly.  The style please me and this is no exception."
"This one is just not for me"
""
""
""
"This is really interesting American version of the English IPA. I hope this style might attract more domestic brewers to try a hoppy but less bitter quaff than the current ""Session IPA"" crowd. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Bottlecraft in San Diego."

"Had this on tap at victory.  Flavors were muddled, strong notes of tootsie roll and thick mouthfeel."

"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 2/26/2015. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, pine, light caramel, light toasted bread, herbal, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/earthy hops, bready malt, and fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, pine, light caramel, light toasted bread, herbal, grass, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange zest, pear, apple, pine, light caramel, light toasted bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity and robustness of citrus/earthy hops, bready malt, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Some light-moderate dryness as well. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice English IPA style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/earthy hops, bready malt, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"22 ounce bottle, best before 26 FEB 2015.  Served in a DFH IPA glass, the beer pours a hazy golden/orange color with a couple inch frothy off-white head that stayed around a long time.  There's also a lot of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like herbal/grassy hops, dried fruit, bready malt, and some apple.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some citrus peel, tea, woody and nutty flavors.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium.  It's smooth, a bit coating and is well carbonated.  I thought this was good.  If you're looking for a super hopped American styled IPA, this might not be for you.  But if you're looking for an English-styled IPA then you should definitely pick this up!  And it's priced well at $4.99 a bomber, I'd like to see this in 6 packs in the future."

" The taste is very good with prominent hop flavor with both herbal and floral qualities and slightly toasted taste and mildly sweet malt flavor to support but still more hop forward with dry flavor of yeast and tangy fruit in the middle with a subtle citrus hop flavor melding in the English hop profile with a subtle apple tanginess in the yeast  which compliments the flavor. The quality of malt hops and yeast is really noticeable and the ale seems dry/semi-bitter with fruity flavor not quite grassy in the hop flavor but certainly lots of herbal hop taste which is lingering in a pleasant finish. Very good IPA, an excellent example of an English style ale with what I imagine a fresh one would taste like from across the pond. This has a nice fresh hop presence w/ good English flavors w/ malt body sufficient yet not excessive -Kudos Victory!"

"overall  - this beer is a pima pils with english malts and i love it"
""
""
"O - A good beer, but not sure you would know it was an IPA.if it didt not say so.  Little to no hops. Easy drinking. Not what I was expecting though."
"Overall:  Surprised by the relative balance here in an EIPA that is as much about the malts as it is about the hops, perhaps even moreso; I would like to see more earthy bitterness here than I found"
""
""
"But the malt finally gives way with the beer's waning moments and allows the resinous bitterness of hops to cast a bark-like woodiness, freshly shaven pine sharpness and a pithy grapefruit rind bitterness that easily outlasts all other flavors in aftertaste."

"O: This is a solid enough beer. It won't knock your socks off, but it is likeable in its way."
""
""

"O- Unlike any IPA I've ever had, English or American.  Has a flavor profile that I don't necessarily prefer but I find quite interesting.  Kudos to Victory for managing to brew an IPA that's totally original."

"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazy, copper coloring, with a slow, steady flow of carbonation throughout the body, and a low profile, fluffy, chunky, off-white head. Aromas of tropical fruit forward, roasted caramel, pepper spice and bitter greens, apple sweet, and hints of toffee. Flavors are very tangy sweet forward, with a blast of tart apple, sweet pear, some tropical fruit notes, cut grass, mild bitterness, roasted notes, some melon characteristics, and a subtle caramel backbone. Smooth and light bodied, with a tangy, fruity aftertaste. Fairly dry, crisp finish, with a subtle resinous linger. Not bad."
""
"This was a nice beer, herbal and piney notes dominate the hop profile, with a sight hint of orange. The finish has a reminiscence of tea as well backed by a nice balance of malt sweetness. This was an interesting beer, nothing that wows, but it is well made, has good flavor and depth, and is a very nice interpretation of the English variety of IPA."

"Overall, this is a solid brew and very approachable.  Great for watching some football and getting the food cooking on a warmer mid autumn night."
""
""
"O: A solid English-style IPA with a good amount of herbal and earthy hops with just enough fruitiness. There is just enough crystal malt in there to give it a little lively sweetness as well. Solid job on this version of the Ever-Evolving IPA"
"Overall I liked this beer its not wet hop beer but a decent English IPA. I would get it again."

"It was so easy to drink, so good and so reasonably priced I gave away half the case to friends and went back to Victory a couple days later to get two more cases. Very well done!"

"Starts like a good ipa finishes with malty hops.  Almost green tea like finish."
