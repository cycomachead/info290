"Overall:  like this one on tap better than from the bottle.  More of an English IPA than an American because of its round mellow feel, but the hops don't entirely fit.  Even so, it paired well with my spicy Asian dish."

"Light brown in color with excellent clarity.  There's a fingernail of white foam covers the majority of the top of the beer.  Brussels lacing.  The hop aroma is faint at best.  There's little aroma.  There's a faint hop flavor present but it is fairly balanced with the malt presence.  The body is moderately carbonated and slightly sticky."

"A nice beer from a brewery I hadn't heard of before, and it went well with my sammich."

"My favorite IPA! Appearance was darker than expected and did not have the brash bitterness that often comes with the choice of a pale ale. The hops were delightfully balanced and gave a fresh punch at the front of my mouth and finished well. It paired exceedingly well with a medium salsa and the spice of South American cuisine. A prime drink indeed!"

"Some odd notes, but a steady IPA overall. Departs from the usual IPA profile, but I’m not sure how purposeful that is - why the all the dark crystal malts? Not very English either. Mostly sessionable, if curious."

"An okay beer. There are so many IPAs that you have to be great just to make it on the top 100 lost. This beer is ok, not great."

"Hazy dark amber in color. Thin cream colored head. Leaves nice rings of lacing. Suprisingly little aroma. Taste is well balanced. Starts a bit sweet and malty and finished bitter earthy hops. Nice sticky mouthfeel. Overall a nice beer, good restrained use of the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Sweet Child of Vine pours a cloudy golden color, with a small lacing head. There is a mellow smokey and sweet aroma. The taste has a mellow sweetness, with a mellow smokey flavor, and just the tiniest bit of hops; has a BBQ sauce like flavor. Easy drinking, a little light in overall flavor. Overall its not bad, unique smokey like flavors, but light."

"O: For all the label/description fanfare regarding the hopping of this beer, not much of it came across in the scents and flavors. Looks good, but not much of a drinker. Bubbles in excess. Probably won't be going out of my way to revisit."

"Mouth is slick and slightly coating."
"O – 3.75 – It's a good beer, and I would rate it higher if they didn't call it an IPA. It's more like an old ale or even a red/amber ale. Good beer though."
""
"overall it's definitely an English tasting ipa, medicinally bitter but not unenjoyable."

"Trying a bottle of Sweet Child Of Vine...like the name! This beer pours clear copper with rich white head that is leaving a spotty lace. The smell is true to English Style IPA...more of a bitter hop with hints of malt. The taste is slightly sweet yet bitter. The malt base really works well with the hops. The mouthfeel is medium to light in body with decent cabonation. Overall it is not a bad beer....relatively easy drinking."
""
""
"Good lawnmower beer. Not overly hopped. Sweet smooth non offensive. 6.4% abv hidden and non filling. Good food beer: Asian, pizza. Not an outstanding brew but very drinkable. I've run out of things to say about this beer but must keep reviewing to save this to my memory banks."

"While I prefer some of the other local Minnesota IPAs to (normal) Sweet Child — notably Surly Furious and Town Hall Masala Mama — I would add Fulton to the mix occasionally when I wanted a maltier, less hoppy IPA. But widely distributing a beer this far off the mark is seriously not cool — Fulton has lost me as a customer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While this is a good beer, I certainly would not reach for it for my hop fix. If I wanted more of a big APA I would grab it."

"Some advice. Drink this one slow and sip hard at the peak. Distracted by other endeavors while sipping the second glass, the warmth opens up the beer more than a bit. The harshness in the nose and taste mellows, and the sweetness grows in complexity with an underlying taste somewhere between burnt brown sugar and black strap molasses. With heavy lace on a beer clean glass, this IPA is growing on me by the pint."
""
""
"Overall: Not an overly impressive IPA. I thought it was a bit weird. I don't think I need another one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very memorable English IPA. Like this umami thick and rich sweetness and hop bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very nice English IPA. Exactly what it should be, balanced with earthy hops showing through."
""
""
"The pour is sort of a dark amber color with a white head. Quite malty and sweet with minimal hop aroma. A hint of floral hops and maybe a touch of citrus peel. The flavor is similarly lacking in the hop department. Bread and toffee are the prominent flavors with a little caramel, too. Mild floral hop flavor and very little in the way of bitterness."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: As far as English IPA's go, it's not bad. There's more spice in this brew than others of the same category. It's almost a hybrid beer: wheat and IPA. I'd probably go for it on-tap but not again in the bottle. I also noticed that with every sip the taste seemed to be a less satisfying. However, if you are a big fan of English IPA's and want a bit of a change from the everyday beer, then go for this one."
""
""
""
""
"As English IPAs go, it's a decent one, but probably not my favorite."
""
""
"Weak ""flat"" flavor profile doesn't do justice to either style this tries to incorporate. No real off notes, but the brewer has produced a bland product in an attempt at something sessionable."

"Pours a caramelish orange color. Nose is floral hops with some caramel malts and bubblegum. Taste starts of with soft citric notes that fade to a nice caramel grain malt. There are some notes of bubblegum and ends with a nice floral, earthy, citric hop flavor. Medium mouth goes down well. Overall, pretty solid English india pale ale - worth a shot."
""
"Nicely balanced, but probably less hoppy than most IPA connoisseurs are looking for."

"O- very solid ipa. Reminds me of another ipa but I can't put my finger on it."
""

"received this as an extra and always excited to try new beers. however i would of guessed this to be more an english mild bitter than an english ipa. a dark copper body with next to no head or lacing. the smell is very sweet with mostly caramel and bready malts, cant pick out any hops. taste is just as swet as the nose making this a malt bomb. mouthfeel is thin with a little spice like a mild bitter beer. if you like sweet beers this is easy drinkin, if not stay away. and dont expect much for hops in this one."
"Overall, this was a decent beer. Better than expexted, but it was a bit too malty for me. It is a very balanced ipa."
""
""
"I liked this one better on tap, much more balanced."
""
"Overall: Rather insipid for an English IPA; would not order again"
""
""
""
""
"O - A decent IPA. Not a palate killer by any stretch, which works well for it, but there is a nice hop presence."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice representation of the English style IPA. Though I prefer in your face hoppiness, this does justice to it's style."
""
"Was really excited to try this beer, got it as an extra in a trade, but damn, this is Kennebunkport-esque in terms of bad for an ipa. The thing is, I've had numerous K-port ipas, and they're just bad, this beer, was infected, so hopefully I'll have another opportunity to have one of these under proper conditions."
""

"O: A pretty decent IPA overall. Unfortunately the subdued aroma really holds it back, but it's still quite tasty with a pleasant, lively body."
"O - This is a good English IPA with a touch of American flair. Nice brew from Fulton."
"Pour was a nice dark copper with a half finger of foam that dissipated quickly but leaves decent lacing. Smell was, overall, very mild. Slight hints of citrus and malt and something metallic as well. Taste was a well balanced mildly citic hop and mild sweet malt interplay, mildly bitter, that finishes dry and clean with no lingering bitterness. Medium, well-crafted body with good level of carbonation let's one know this is a craft brew. Overall, nothing extraordinary here, but an easy drinking, mild IPA."
"O - Not as citrusy or hoppy, but I still enjoyed it."
"I have had this three times in the last three days in different settings and this is by far my best experience. I like the balance and the slightly different take to this. Just know going in this is not going to be a big west coast IPA."

"Toasted malts and mineral-like bitterness up front. Orange marmalade and mild herbal hop flavors follow. Fruit and biscuit malt fill up the palate, while the hop flavors and bitterness hang out in the background. Becomes mintier and vegetal in the finish. Nicely balanced, with subtle hop bitterness, and a very nice malt profile. Medium bodied with a very creamy feel. Would be nice to have this on cask!"

"O. Average IPA, label reads ""where do we go now?"" and I say more hops, more hops, more hops."

"Like It? For the Most Part, Yeah"

"Pours a nice amber-copper color with a thin white head that very quickly recedes into a thin collar. The nose has some slight floral elements along with a lot of bread and some caramel. Very reminiscent of Dogfish 60. Flavor is similar with more of a malt emphasis. Even for an English IPA, this is really malt heavy. Very slight dryness to the finish. Brew itself is rather chewy. Decent enough, but nothing out of the ordinary."
""
""
""
"Overall: A good take on a English IPA. Pretty well balanced with just enough hop flavor to keep it from becoming bland."
"D: Very pleasant beer. Enjoyed the cask a great deal. Would like to compare the cask to a regular tap to check out the differences."
"I'm feeling underwhelmed by this beer. Maybe I had unreasonable expectations due to my anticipation about the brewery. But regardless, it's rather dull, with low hop presence and nothing really remarkable. Where's the flavor?"
"O= I've had this on tap and it was much much better. I was at a beer dabbler event so I didn't bother to take notes or write reviews on it. This however is a much different beer. The flavor is muted and the hops don't dominate like most IPAs. This is more of a strong pale ale or something. Really not an IPA and really different than I remember it being on tap."
"Bottle poured into perfect pint glass"
"Have tried this a few times and was not too impressed. I’ll now chalk that up to the other beers I may have had prior to drinking this. Aroma is bland, but flavor/mouthfeel are spot on for me. This beer could get lost in the crowd of bigger, bolder beers but definitely a nice beer to start the night out with or if you’re going to stick with one beer."
"An OK brew that comes pretty close to the English style IPA with a bit of lacking character and complexity. It does have a nice simplicity about it that encourages itself to be a good session brew."
"My opinion has not changed about this beer. I know many people really love this but I find it a bit timid for an IPA, English or American. Well crafted as intended and the bottled product matches the draft exactly."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. A pretty solid IPA, although it could easily get lost in the crowd."
"O- This is not the greatest IPA ever made, but there is something about it that makes me want more. I prefer it on tap, but some of that preference may have come from having the sixer sit in my car for a while before getting home to enjoy it. If it is any different after having a colder one, I will edit my review accordingly."
"O- For me this beer was a great nose, but it lacked substance pretty much everywhere else."
"This is my first full Fulton beer.Recommended, definitely worth having, but not a great wow factor here."
"Not a bad beer overall. I think I need to give this one another go. Just wasn’t getting it going here."
"Nice solid drink overall. Worth giving it a go and probably a return."
"On tap at Bricks Pub in Blaine, Minnesota. This beer arrives a clear amber-orange color. The head is one inch of white foam that recedes slowly leaving rings of lacing along the sides of the glass until the beer is gone. The aroma is a mix of floral notes and grapefruit. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with a bit more grapefruit. Bitterness is rather moderate for an IPA. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with smooth texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but I can't see myself drinking it often. The mix of floral and grapefruit in the beer really makes me want to drink an IPA that is completely floral."
"It's got a decent body to it, and it should given the English-style malt bill. The carbonation is also solid. Overall, this is a solid beer. I keep using that word because that's all this beer is. It isn't good, exactly, not in the strict sense of the word. It is above average, with no real flaws apart from an imbalance towards the American hop flavors."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a fairly tasty British IPA, although so by the strength of the alcohol then the hop flavor, which could have been cranked up a tad, even if it was still the appropriate hop bill they used."
"O- a great session ipa with a nice floral hop taste ,nicely drinkable a nice representation that i will order again"
"The glacial hops blend well with the malt, but still remain at the forefront of both smell and taste. It tastes a lot like an ESB might if you juiced up the bitterness a notch, clearly letter the imbiber know that hops is in charge. I love balanced beers, as they provide me the best drinking experience."
"D- I like the balance in this beer, nice malt backbone stands to support the nice clean bitterness presented by the American hops. Very drinkable at 6.4% nicely fits in the range of most English style IPA's which allows having a few, but has a great American take on it, with the hop varieties used."
"I love the care put into this beer. The restraint to keep the hops at a level that is not over the top is commendable. Keep up the good work."
"I see a lot of new beers at Ed's but this is one of best of the summer so far. I never drank this before but I was instantly impressed by the flavor profile the mango and bitterness is great touch with the malt. I drank a few of these like others have said it can make you a bit of a bar fool. It certainly hits"
"I will continue to drink and enjoy this beer. Don't go into it, though, thinking it's something it isn't, as some do."
"Drinkability: Very well balanced and easy to drink IPA. Great flavor overall but could use a little more bitterness so I need to dock it a little. Just a touch too balanced for my IPA tastes."
"D: Very pleasant beer. Enjoyed the cask a great deal. Would like to compare the cask to a regular tap to check out the differences."
"I've enjoyed this a few places around Minneapolis. It's always reminded me bit of Brooklyn's East India Pale Ale, for the fruity and earthy pairing of hop flavors with a soft bitterness. Really, this is a more sessionable IPA. You can tell it has body and a little more alcohol than a pale ale, but it's not thick or overly bitter. I'd call it a tasty starter-IPA. Certainly worth a try for any beer lover."
"D: This offering, although light and mild, is still pretty easy to drink. It's a decent brew, but not one for the extreme hopheads."
"Overall, knocked me off my bar stool. Watch out world, Fulton will bring the pain. Killer IPA by my standards, excitedly looking forward to future releases from the little guys."
"M/D: Medium to lighter body, carbonation seems a touch on the high side. Good drinkability though due to the balance in the taste and the crisp finish. The muted hop flavors increase the drinkability for me as well."
"Drinkablity: Oh yes, very easy to drink and great flavor. Easily a session beer. Will definitely order this one again, or pick some up at the store as a summer refresher."
"A solid beer, quite drinkable, lower bittering, sessionable andlocal...all the better."
"Copper color with one finger head. Nice citrus hop scent with some sweet malt. Pretty balanced taste of citrus hops with a solid malt backbone. Feel is fine. Almost medium bodied, mostly smooth. A bit of prickly carbonation. Easy drinking IPA. Nothing crazy or outstanding, just a solid and easy going IPA. I would welcome this again."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin for me, but this is a pretty easy drinking IPA, and another good brew from a Minnesota brewery."
"Overall, kind of disapointed with this out of Fulton. I was looking for a really citrus and floral hopped IPA, and I didn't get it. I still have high hopes for the brewery, because their other offerings look tasty. I think this just needs to be tweaked just a little but, but then again I'm not the brewer."
"Medium mouthfeel, medium to high carbonation. Nice bitter finish. Not bad, but not the best I have had either. I wish the flavors and aroma were bolder."
