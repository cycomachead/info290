"12oz bottle poured into nonic. Hazy orange liquid with a a pillowy head that settles to a finger of foam. The aroma is packed with cedar wood and white pepper then there’s malt, bread, grass, and doughy yeast. Flavor is perfumed bitterness from the cedar, tea and white pepper, followed by citrus hop and caramel malts. Medium body, slightly thick but sadly without a resinous/sticky IPA character, lively carbonation, and a bitter, nearly astringent finish."

"O: Really enjoying this one.  I think it wasn’t intended to be an ipa, and if its thought of outside that box its really unique, labeled ‘Japanese Classic Ale’ for a reason.  Got on Wishbeer, don’t regret it as I’ve never seen it in stores. Drank in Kunming, Jan 26th, 2015."

"Food match: I know I have a habit of recommending cuisines from the same country as the beer but this would really hit the spot with green bean and shiitake tempura with ponzu mayo, kampai!"
"O- mixed feelings on this one.  Try it."
"Single bottle poured into a tulip. A cloudy orange-red with two fingers of creamy beige foam. Aroma is a compelling mix of brittle toffee, orchard fruit (peach and pear), earthy/slightly woody forest floor hops, nuts and pretzels ... Palate is similarly unique. Does come across as an English IPA but with a moderate degree of plum fruitiness, a rich toffee maltiness, unexpected almond and pecan notes, and more expected cedar or sandalwood aromatics. Some diacetyl apparent. A stark contrast between the dry woodiness and the rich sweet malts, somehow it works. Body on the thick side for the style, moderate carbonation and a malt-forward finish seasoned with a dash of woody spice. Unique brew like many of this brewery's other offerings. Not well-integrated yet one can switch between the dry floral fruitiness, the woody spice, and the sweet dessert backbone and not get the least bit bored."

"A nicely balanced pale ale. Wouldn't consider it a big enough brew to be labeled as 'IPA'. Nice and crisp, easy drinking. I tasted pear and mild vegetal qualities."

"Review based on the BJCP2008 guidelines (style 14A adapted). Bottle 33 cl - Batch J.14.02. AROMA: no hop notes with sweet malt aromas reminiscent of caramel. very low fruitness. APPEARANCE: amber color and hazy. moussy tanned head with good retention. TASTE: medium bitterness that lingers into a dry finish with no hop flavours. unbalanced high malt flavours. PALATE: medium-light body with moderate carbonation. OVERALL: although the comercial description says it is a IPA, this beer is unbalanced towards a sweet malt profile but its not that bad."

"This is an OK ale – not something I’ll ever seek out again, but one I’ll drink if someone offers me a free one."
""
"O: The problem here may lie with the English IPA style itself, which is a bit on the thin and uninteresting. Kiuchi tries with this, but it doesn't succeed all around."

"O: the bottle version didn't quite match the more distinct, dynamic flavors of the tap version I had years back - that being the first time I had tried the beer - it was a Hitachino event for charity, right after the tsunami - 7 or 8 of their beers on tap at Kraftwork... I could see flashes of that beer's greatness in this.... definitely one to seek out - it's different"
""
""
"O-This is a unique beer in both good and bad ways. I suspect that my bottle was old because it lacked any semblance of a hoppy punch and even the cedar had faded a bit into the background. That being said, I think I could get into this beer if I could find a fresh example because the citrus/cedar aspect is really intriguing. It seems like a good summertime combination."

"Poured a gorgeous fully cloudy amber with a thin white head that leaves some lacing. It looks like gorgeous, natural, earthy unfiltered apple juice. Just looking at it makes me want to drink it. Scents of caramel, earthy, herbal hops, earthy yeast, grape, slight citrus aromas in the background and faint undercurrents of cedar. A very nice, earthy, sweet, fruity aroma profile, different from a lot of IPAs, even English style IPAs, that I've had. Its pleasant and inviting. Taste begins sweet with caramel, moving into some nice herbal hops and a tea-like flavor. Throughout there is a nice musky, earthy, yeasty presence that compliments the herbal and tea flavors of the hops wonderfully. There are also slight undercurrents of cedar in the background throughout the sip and some light citrus peel bitterness on the finish. The aftertaste is mildly bitter, but not overwhelmingly so. A good, earthy, sweet, balanced flavor that avoids being both too sweet and too bitter. Very well executed. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and with low carbonation. It feels like a good, classic style ale should. Quite nice. Overall this is a very good take on an English IPA. It's balanced and malty, but with a good underlying bitterness and an aroma that is flat out amazing. Very highly recommended."

"Pours a nice light golden brown with a 1/2 inch head that quickly dissipates. Very mild lacing on the glass. First sip is fairly sweet and you can taste a little bit of cedar from the casks. Lots of yeast particles are visible through the glass. Has a great hearty mouthfeel. Some slight bitterness at the end and after awhile you can start tasting the alcohol at the end. Some slight citrus scent and taste. A very nice beer that's got some character to it."
""

"Very great beer, I love the spice and malty smell. The cedar lingers in your mouth, it's like sitting in a library with this beer, the 7% alcohol level really is hidden. It's a very effervescent beer, and that's pretty rare for a Japanese beer, but it also still retains a dry aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: With its unique taste, a sipping beer - and yet very drinkable as well. I could easily have another, or at least would not mind it if it came in a bigger bottle. I wonder how this beer is on tap. I definitely would buy this again. Overall it has aspects of a Belgian Pale Ale, and American IPA, and that distinct cedar aging that is like no other style. Well done!"
""
""
""
"While I wished there were more cedar in the aroma, it came through stunningly towards the back of the tongue. This is definitely a unique IPA (at least as far as I've tasted), but it's one that I certainly find myself enjoying. Cedar is a tree/aroma/...flavour I guess? that holds great personal significance, so I may enjoy it more than others because of the intangibles it evokes. Definitely worth your time, though, if you find yourself curious."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I was a bit put off by the malt in some way and the nose was a bit odd for me. It was unusual in a way that I was not sure of. Otherwise this was a fantastic English style IPA. I would buy this again, as I would many other beers from Hitachino."
"O: This brew totally blew me away. It was worth the $4.99."
""
""
""
"Amber body with thin head. Vanilla, caramel, and nuts in the smell. Taste is really sweet. Just very caramelly and malty. Some vanilla. Not getting much cedar (which I'd like to taste more). Too sweet. Mouthfeel is pretty thick and sticky, but some stinging carbonation helps with that. This is not so great. If the cedar were more prevalent, I'd like this more."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Small particles of sediment are seen floating around in the beer after the pour. Smell is of malt, grain, biscuit, and earthy and slight citrus hop aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and citrus fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a fairly subdued smell but the flavors are solid and tasty, especially as the beer warms up."

"O. It is a bit bland. A descent taste, but a bit overdone."

"Pours a cloudy, dark maize color. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, strong citrus hops, floral hops, yeast, slight biscuit, hint of caramel malt, slight pale malt, hint of grass, and herb/spice?. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Fits the style of an English IPA. Tastes of grass, sweet malt, hint of rye, slight pale malt, slight floral hops, hint of pale malt, slight caramel malt, and slight alcohol. Overall, good aroma, body, blend, and decent appearance."
""

"A beautifully colored beer, cloudy burnt orange with a million tiny bits of sediment floating around. Head is perfect for the style and the lacing is above average. Interestingly enough, I don't smell the cedar that others have mentioned at all. Instead, I get impressions of apricots, wildflower blossoms, a little ground white pepper, and hops. The taste reminds me of a more refined and interesting MH #9; apricot and flowery hops arrive first, but the overall taste is nicely balanced by the finish. Slight lingering taste of citrus left on the palate after each sip. Mouthfeel was a little sharp right out of the fridge, but it is becoming more soft and luscious as it warms up. I'll definitely buy some more."
"Given the price of getting it here in KC, I can't imagine I would drink this one often, but it's a very tasty beer and one I would recommend to someone wanting to delve into the Japanese microbrewery scene."
""
""
"When I tried to relate to people, and promote this beer, I never had to lie, yet I always had to be cheesy. ""Would you like to drink the scent of a cigar box?"" Honestly, I can't move beyond the cedar nose. And who doesn't love the mysterious scent of their father's cedar cigar box? This is also the only beer I've ever encountered with this flavor profile. So points for originality? And brilliantly, unlike a typical strange or experimental brew, it actually works and is elegant, and challenging. My personal favorite from Hitachino."
"This is definitely a beer to be drank and appreciated in small quantities amongst friends. I can say this is one of the beers that got me hooked on learning more about craft breweries. A real treat."
"This beer is really good. Truly an experience, and what picking out a single bottle is about: cedar? Awesome. Beer from Japan? Out of the ordinary. You should try this because I’d love to hear your thoughts."
""
""
"Overall, a nice treat, especially giving its regional location. It can act as a great way to start or end an evening, but with APEC assistance needed if the intention is to pull you through the night..."
""
""
""
"Bottled. Amber color, big off-white head. Aroma is fruits, marzipan, quite sweet nutmeg like notes as well as some mild spices. Flavor is wood, mild smoked wet things as well as spices and quite nutty. Mild vanilla. Very different, yet pleasant brew."
"O: Very enjoyable and the addition of the cedar is very interesting. Not quite sessionable but easy to drink."
"O: LOVE this one - it actually exhibits a balance and details that I prefer to my previous top ale, the Hennepin."
""
"O: I found this to be a very interesting beer due to the cedar aromas and flavors—it seemed like just enough cedar was added without being enough to completely overpower the beer."
"Overall: what a strange beer. It has kind of grown on me, but I feel like this brew could be an acquired taste. Definitely worth a try."
""
"Overall, I really like this. It would probably be a go-to beer if I could find it easily and at a reasonable price. It's a beer-y beer, without any crazy flavors, with enough complexity to keep me interested."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good beer; not amazing, not great, just a good brew, in moderation. I dont think id get again but I did enjoy. But would probably enjoy with a great cigar for sure..."
""
"I had this down as comparable to Meantime IPA, but it’s not there. Orange and caramel, sure enough, but needs to take the leash off."
""
"Aroma is typically malty with a firm hoppy and woody undertone and a touch of fruit. It pours a clear golden amber with a fairly thick off-white head. Malty flavor has appreciable hoppy and fruity notes and just a hint of hop bitterness. Smooth flavor has about average body and a good amount of ragged fizz. Though not spectacular, still an enjoyable brew."
""

"O: I wish it had less caramel flavor, but it's not bad."

"B-"
"Unique , distinctive and worthy of much more noteriety."
"Draft. Hazy, deep golden body. Frothy, off-white head. Aroma of toasted malt, cookie and bread, floral hops and earthiness. Noes of orange and honey. The flavor is lightly to moderately sweet and lightly bitter. It finishes lightly sweet and moderately bitter. Medium body, creamy texture, average carbonation. Sweetness and bitterness are nicely proportioned for an IPA. A softer presentation than American IPAs, especially in the mouthfeel which is less carbonated and less crisp. Very good."
"very tasty brew"
""
"Overall- What to make of a beer that breaks nearly every mold, refuses to fit in a neat category, and generally leaves as many questions as answers? My general rule of beer is that I would rather be shocked than bored, rather find something new than just another ""solid"" example of a well defined style. Average IPAs seemingly grow on trees. This beer, whatever it is, it anything but average. Maybe not the first choice for a hophead, but the ride is worth taking for anyone who loves beer."
""
"I was worried with this one. I usually don't like wood aged beers unless they're a strong ale or Burton Baton. On top of that, it's cedar; one of the strongest tastes a wood can have. The cedar came through well, bubbling up after a few sips, but it didn't take over. Whew. The harsh woody bitterness was there, but it wasn't overpowering. It just forced me to sip and enjoy this English IPA a little more over time. This isn't something I'd buy a 12 pack of, but it's a great beer of which I want more."
"O: Interesting beer - an English India pale modeled in Japanese tradition of being aged in cedar casks and then hopped with an American hops. It was good – but no where near what I would call an IPA."

"Drinkability: The best Japanese beer I've ever had, though it is my fist craft beer from that country. Great use of ingredients, good method and subtle wood experience make this beer a great drinker that I would seek out if available."
"O-- Probably really good fresh. Still pretty good for being a bit old. Has held up pretty well."
"O: Almost too grapey/Kool-Aid-ish. Otherwise good. Recommended. Will look for more of this breweries beers."
"A nice cloudy copper / amber pour with a lasting tan head with descent lacing. Aroma and taste of sweet caramel malt with some nice citrus piney hops and some spicy fruity notes. A nice medium body with moderate carbonation on the palate. The finish is sweet malt with some good citrusy piney hops for balance and fruity notes on the ending. Overall a good, balanced easy drinking IPA."
"Quite an interesting brew, this beer poured out as a nice golden color. The head was fluffy and white, it settles in a short period of time. The smell of the beer has some hoppy aromas mixed with the grainy malts. The taste of the beer is where I find this to be the best. The Flavors of wild rice, malts, black pepper and hops all come together here. I never would have guessed that this beer would have that much going on inside it. The mouthfeel of the beer is light and drinkable. Overall I really enjoyed the beer and would probably have it again one day."
"Tastes of lavender, chamomile, hopes, bitterness, malt, honey malt, fluff, flowers, rice, fizz, mint, citurs, plumy tastes and pure cane sugar. Smell like an IPA from Japan, LOL. That and plenty of malty good, hops, hops and hops. Pretty dope, y'all."
"The beer is a bit thin and almost over carbonated it's very dry and bitter the aftertaste that lingers a little longer than I would like. I enjoyed this beer for sure but would have liked a little more smoothness my throat felt super dry when done drinking this brew, just one of these in a sitting is good for me."
"Into a pint glass, this pours a glowing copper color, with a cloudy look if you let the bottle sediment in. Aroma is a modest yet inviting one with notes of toasted malt, citrus and floral hops. Sweet citrus hops gently mingle on the palate with a balancing crisp and refreshing malt. There's a noticeable sake-esque taste throughout, particularly with the dryness in the finish. Orange citrus noted hops resonate in the aftertaste. Smooth for it's 7.5% abv."
"Overall: A pretty good beer from Hitachino and even better when drunk during a hot day. I definitely recommend this beer to anyone interested in a break from hopped up IPAs that most people seem to prefer."
"Poured from a 24 into a Sam Adams glass. Dark yellow with lots of particulate floating around. Huge head that slowly fades to a heavy film. When I first poured it I got a huge whiff of hops but strangely it's not there on the first taste. Virtually no hop taste. Malty with bitterness a little pepper but the hops is subdued. After it warms a little I get some cedar and rosemary scent. Also a little more cedar in the taste. Unusual beer."
"O: really smooth and flavorful; exhibits the qualities of a traditional IPA, with a nice twist from the cedar"
"I enjoyed the beer, but on a take home scale, I would leave this on the shelf for another day."
"Other than that, really nice stuff. ♠"
"The mouthfeel is a bit thick, but it works with the heavy cedar flavors here. It's also a quite drinkable beer. I really liked this one, it's a unique take on the IPA style with heavy herbal aspects you rarely find in something like this. Recommended for lovers of herbal aspects or cedar."
"A nice brew, but does not do much for me personally. I wouldn't reach for this one in the future, but it does drink rather easy."
"D- although i rather liked this beer, i dont think i could have more than one in an evening, maybe its the richness. lovely beer though."
"Bottle solicited from Medi-ya Japanese Supermarket, Liang Court at Clarke Quay, Singapore."
"A unique beer from Hitachino. Their beers tend to have an interesting taste. In this case, I'm not sure if it's the yeast, the cedar casks, or the hopes, but either way, I like it. Essentially it is a solid IPA funked-up a little (in a good way)."
"A very nice and complex beer from Kiuchi Brewery. I'll try some of their other offerings when I get the chance."
"Piney citrus lingers in the aftertaste."
"The semi-high ABV is unnoticeable, but its heavy musty woody flavor make it far from session worthy. I liked this beer. But as another reviewer had said, ""It's one and done"" Don't really want another one of these for a while. Still a very interesting beer which I'm glad I tried. Perhaps a bit too woody and musty for my taste. Definitely worth experiencing. I may get it again in a couple months for another go.."
"D - i was a little surprised by the sharp mouth feel, but the flavours do make for a unique IPA, the hops are featured but not over the top, and the cedar again is subtle but present, goes down decently for 7% ABV"
"Overall, very drinkable. Another nice product from this brewery."
"D - Things just aren't working here for me the wood is too strong that its taking away from the beer instead of adding to it I've like everything else from Hitachino but this one will get passed over by me"
"Overall I found this to be an interesting beer but the flavors didn't work terribly well together. Everything felt like it could be taken up just a notch, including the wood influence. Still, it's worth a shot to see for yourself."
"It was my first beer from Kiuchi and I was impressed."
"This is an interesting beer. It certainly isn't an English IPA but it suits the name ""Japanese Classic Ale"" as it strikes me as the kind of flavour profile I associate with traditional Japanese food."
"A very unusual, and hard to describe (for the style) beer - the pepper essence obfuscating a lot of what is actually going on. In the end, the cigar-friendly wood conditioning helps to mollify the peppery astringency, making for a rather drinkable, if still weirdly intense offering. Might have to try this again, to really grok what's going on here. No idea why this is classified as any sort of IPA."
"For some reason my bottle says that it is 7.5% alcohol, not 7%. Dark orange color with a nice head. Smells of sake and wines. Taste it's just fantastic. It warms up your palate slowly and then you can taste some of the alcohol. This is sake meets beer! This beer is matured in cedar casks that are used in brewing tradition sake."
"Very nice ale - Hitachino Nest is a great craft brewery - find their beers and try them all!"
"Bottle: Poured a light amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of light bitter notes with green hops notes. Taste is not as bitter as expected though hops are clearly noticeable with a nice caramel malt backbone and some light cedar notes rounding things out. Body is slightly below average with good carbonation. Different interpretation of the style with cedar rounding things out nicely."
"D: An interesting ale that's definitely worth a try. Not necessarily something I would session, though."
"I had dinner last night at dbgb on Manhattan's lower east side and it's a great place. Great beers, amazing food. I highly recommend it. Among the beers I had was one the waiter recommended, the IPA. REally good beer and now what I expected from this brewery which is better known for unique tasting beers. This is a pretty classic IPA (maybe even a double ipa) and I will definitely get it again."
"This one drinks very easy, could be a nice session beer. This is one tasty beer, glad to get the chance to try it on tap."
"I like this a lot, but the imbalance does mean I Couldn't drink more than one or two at a time."
"Drinkability: This one could get you in trouble because it says 7% abv on the bottle, but it's so crisp and refreshing that one just won't do it. Besides, the cute owl on the bottle is telling me to go grab another...and this dude abides!"
"What an unusual beer, but a deeply enjoyable one. Crisp and rather refreshing. It's certainly not an IPA in the traditional sense as it's classified here, but I'd be hard pressed to find a better categorisation for it."
"this is a solid beer that I was quite intrigued by and would love to drink again. very mellow and easy to drink please try this beer if you get the chance"
" A great rendition of a UK IPA with mind melting innovations that make it so damn tasty, rounded, mellow and drinkable. If this were available all the time It would be my go-to IPA"
"I liked this offering.. These guys continue to impress the heck out of me. I don't have their beers that often but when I do I'm always impressed with them..."
"Strong, but appropriate carbonation. A bit too bitter, but not bad."
"Honestly, if someone gave me a glass of this, I might be tempted to guess that it was some sort of farmhouse ale. Perhaps this bottle was spoiled or badly handled. While it didn't taste bad, it was pretty far removed from what I was expecting."
"Drinkability: Unique beer with character and worth a try; very drinkable"
"Good drinkability, although a little thick for the style."
"It's a bright peachy-light orange colour with a woody-earthy, smokey aroma with touches of citrus and spiciness. Again quite a unique aroma. Not out there like the Red Rice. You can really smell that cedar aging. I've only heard of one other brewing practising cedar aging. They're in the states and I forget the brewery's name. When you drink it you can start to detect the hops and the smokiness picks up. The cedar is there throughout the whole thing with a light sweet malt mingled with it. It's beautifully balanced. Smooth. A delight."
"drinkability: good"
"Ive been hanging out to try this brew ever since my favourite bottleshop Cellarbrations Carlisle said they were getting their hands on some,it pours a nice orange,copper hue with decent carbonation that leaves a one finger creamy head and some decent lacing here and there,the aroma is really different and nice aswell at the same time it has hints of pineapple,apple,bubblegum and cedar definately makes itself well known,it has a nice easy mouthfeel which is very sessionable and has tastes of apple,peach,piney hops and of course Cedar,to be quite honest i know this is a Japenese version of an English IPA but its definately up there with the best of the English IPA's in my catergory and i highly recommend."
"A unique beer. The cedar aspect of this one really appealed to me."
"Notes: Very interesting and unique flavors, at least to me. Well worth trying."
"d: a good beer but weird especially if the style is IPA; very smooth"
"D: Very interesting beer that I would love to try again. Funny this beer tastes more like a Petrus Aged Pale that an IPA."
"Drinkablity: Not overly hopped, but an interesting IPA. A challenging blend of flavors."
"D: A solid beer that offers a fine alternative to the more commonly available Japanese lagers. While probably not my personal preference in the way of an IPA, I did appreciate the Japanese approach to an IPA."
"I'm not quite sure what to think of this beer, except that I like it even though my brain doesn't quite agree with me. All the factors, as odd as some are, come together and work together, although not something I can have on a regular basis, but worth revisiting. This time around quirky is a good thing."
"Very nice example of the style that gets a Japanese take. This is actually more drinkable than a few other examples I've had. Well done."
"Drinkability - This is my third Hitachino offering. All have been very unique beers and well-worth trying."
"D- Very unusual. I wouldn't drink this a lot or often. I'll say it does age fairly well and if you're into vintage and run across it, it's worth a try."
"Pours an interested cloudy amber, with a thick eggshell head that lingers, mild laceing. The aroma is a delicate blend of caramel malt and flowery hops entertwined, the cedar is present around the edges. The flavor starts with malt sweetness, bursting into flowery hops, with a touch of dry honey before a crisp cedery finish. The hops are not overstated like many in this style and the cedar adds an exra which complements the hops and finishes this beer very, very well. It's a little oily but the brightness of the cedar and the dryness honey finish overcome it well. I'm nearing the end of my 24.3 (extra points for haveing a really cool looking bottle painted owl dude) and wishing I had more."
"I'm not a big fan of this beer but I don't know if that's because it's a unique style and my first taste of it or because it's not very good. IPA aged in cedar. It' probably just not my style."
"This beer starts out light sweet with flavors of hops and ends with nice bitter touch like a typical IPA. This one is easy to drink, a likeable bitter end. Overall a very decent effort."
"D - This is a nice brew. It's almost too sweet to have more than one in a sitting."
"D: Not exactly ""sessionable"" due to the fact that this is such a unique and different beer. Still fairly drinkable. I'll definitely grab one of these again."
"Watch out for gushers with this one. I cracked a cold bottle just like I always do, but foam erupted right away and caused a bit of a mess. I only lost a couple ounces though and it calmed down right away. Once in the glass, it was a hazy orange with a fluffy eggshell coloured cap. Good head retention with a bit of chunky lace. Interesting aroma, a combination of spicy wood and floral character. There's a mild nutmeg component and hint of citrus. The wood aging was a little overdone in the flavour - too much cedar and wood resin along with a dry astringency - but the hops weren't completely overwhelmed. Bitterness was light, as was malt sweetness. Notes of nutmeg and cinnamon appeared mid-palate. Slight warmth in the finish. The carbonation died down quite quickly, starting very high but becoming a bit low after 10 minutes or so. Overall it's an interesting beer, but the wood was too much for me. If it was brought into balance it would be really good rather than a bit better than average."
" I have never heard of Kiuchi Brewing, now I am on a quest to find more."
"An absolute treat to try on draft."
"I'd almost say you could session this. I'll have to lay into a whole six pack next time I find it and try it out."
"more of a bitter than a IPA to me."
"D - I must get more. I had the Hitachino Nest Red Rice, and the White Ale, and was only mildly impressed...but this, this is excellent. At 7.5%, you are not going to pound this, but it is still very much enjoyable. My compliments to this Japanese brewer. How can this be this underrated?"
"Overall it's good and I'm glad I tried it. I won't be in a rush to get back to it though."
"Served very cold and poured into a tulip. Two fingers of resilient billowing white head formed supported by the glass and lively effervescence. Dull copper colored liquid with visible yeast sediment. The cedar smell is surprisingly obvious and strong. Also smells of grapes, and apples. Taste is tart with cedar and and some finishing hops predominating. Just a hint of malts near the end. A pretty straightforward beer in taste. Dry and light mouthfeel. Interesting beer to try for the cedar, but not really the most pleasing."
"Overall I'd say this beer is quite rich and flavorful. If you read the front label and ignore the back, then this is a very nice real ale offering. Trying to label this beer as an IPA is quite dangerous because the style guidelines are written around the American adaptation of this style. I'd say Hitochino's Nest is shooting for one of those neat CAMRA labels on their bottle."
"Drinkability: I have never tasted another beer quite like this one. To say it is complex in aroma and taste is an understatement. This one grew on me as I tasted it and could have several..I think this is a must beer if not just for its uniqueness."
"Notes: This is an unusual beer, but what did I expect from Hitachino? I think I like it, but would like to try it again another day, maybe with some food...but what to pair it with? Yikes!"
"Overall, quite an interesting beer. The drinkability score suffers a bit from the medicinal alcohol flavor, but the lovely aroma and the novelty of the cedar, which lingered pleasantly long after the glass was empty (I still can taste the forest on my lips), make this one I'd gladly try again, even given the price tag."
"This poured a slightly hazy copper color with off-white head. It smelled like mulling spices and cloves with overripe apple and orange. It tasted like sweet orange and overripe apple with mulling spices and green peppercorns and honey malt, and a bit of sweet brandy oak and rice malt. It was fairly thick with some carbonation, and had a sweet and spiced aftertaste. Overall this had a very unique taste that's well constructed and pretty enjoyable. It was clean, had good body, and was fairly easy to drink. If you like cider, you would probably really enjoy this beer."
"Overall a decent beer, but a little disappointing. I happen to know that the bottle I tasted had been on the shelves quite a while, so another tasting may be in the cards. For now I think I'll stick with Hitachino's White Ale and Red Rice."
"MF&D - a bit thin for an ipa, could be a bit thicker for me. the drinkability though is unhampered by the feel and carbonation. the only thing that holds it back is how odd the taste is."
"GREEN BOTTLES?!? WHY OH WHY?!? this might be an amazing beer, but i have a feeling i've missed out on ever really finding out..."
"EDIT: Seemed more like an American IPA than an English IPA."
"Got a bottle of this on Sunday, cracked it open, and wow, smelled like Grandma's house with the cedar chests for keeping the moths out. I am not really much for wood emphasis beers so this one left me kind of ambivalent, but it had an interesting sake aftertaste for me that kept me interested enough to finish it. Not a bad beer, just not a great beer."
"I know that we are supposed to rate based on ""true to style", but what the hell kind of style is this? It says IPA, and it looks like a double IPA, but that's about it. I got a bit of hops at the end, but overall... this one should be classified on its own. Pours hazy pumpkin color, with a nice head, but it was a bit cold and my pour was weak, so I'm not going to take off for that. The aroma of cedar makes it smell like a closet... and I mean that in a good way. The taste is initially sweet, like many strong IPAs can be, but then it gives way to earthy, cedar. It's interesting, and somewhat nice, but I doubt I would have more than one of these in a setting... A very good beer to experiment with to get different flavors than you would ever imagine in a beer."
"Bottle shared via fisherman34. Pours a brown straw colour with vigorous head. Nose is strong ripe pears. Taste- again significant pear taste then sweet malts followed by a dry wood finish. Minimal hops are present. Very unique brew and drinkability is good. Alcohol well hidden."
"Dark orange in colour with medium to strong carbonation. Strong pear-like aromas mix with some aromatic wood (although not distinctly cedar), and sweet pale malt notes. Fairly malt forward in the mouth, with more orchard fruit and wood. There's a touch of roasted malt character, and some latent drying bitterness. Not really hoppy enough for me to consider it an IPA (or to consider buying it again), but an interesting and fairly tasty beverage regardless."
"This review pertains to the aged 2002 version. Pours a cloudy orange/ golden amber color with a foamy cream color. Aroma of oak, apple and spice. Flavor is quite tart and is dominated by apple because of the aging in cider casks."
"d: This ranks as one of the most unique beers I've tried. It isn't necesarily something I'd reach for often, but I'm definitely glad I tried it."
" This beer was very drinkable. Would have loved to had more bittering hops. A bit pricey, but a very unique ale. Had to try it!"
"This was a very drinkable beer, and would be more so if it wasn't so darned expensive (almost $5 for an 11 oz bottle). All in all I really enjoyed it other than the price."
"I'm not blown away, but it isn't offensive or anything. Tastewise it is just a little sweet and heavy for me, aftertaste is pretty good though. This is a great looking beer in a glass. The aging didn't add a ton of flavor, but you can taste it and it does add to the diversity of the flavor."
"D: It won't be difficult to finish this one, but I'm not sure if I could drink more of this."
"D: good drinkability overall and worthy of seeking out."
"23.4 oz. bottle. Pours a cloudy orange-red color with a big, creamy off-white head, fair lacing. Aroma is cedar, caramel, apples, and pine/spruce hoppiness. Flavor is sweet caramel/toffee malts, citrus (orange), apples, and a finish of spiciness. Medium bodied, lively, and a slight astringent finish. Pretty good beer, bottle was a slight gusher, but it appears not to have affected. Very fruity, complex for an IPA. I enjoy the cedar aging. I hope to have this one again."
"Go try one. You wont regret it."
"another great one from kiuchi!!! glowing burnt orange with a slight haze and a cream colored head that has decent retention and lace. cedar hits my nose first, with a grassy lemon herbal tea hop behind itand a sweetness in the back that is 2/3 malt and 1/3 cedar wood. the sweetness reminds me of sticky rice or rice pudding made with brown rice wrapped around those sugary chalky funsticks dippers from childhood. slightly sweetened woody herbal tea with lemon emds up being the taste to me. kind of complex, and very well balanced. like voltron. a bunch of very unique seperate parts that all have their own personalities, but end up uniting to make one bad ass vessel. very good medium body with a near perfect carbonation level for an ipa. soft and silky. minor and very pleasant bitterness. flavors dance and linger nicely, producing a nice long finish. cedar is very pleasant, and a nice change from oak aged beers. still smoky, but not heavy. like beautiful, delicate, oriental cedar incense. more please."
"Ultimately, the beer is a little sweet over the course of the 24.3 oz bottle, but there seems to be a smaller version out there in the great big world. I don't love this beer, but it would be great for a tasting of unique or unusual beers. Wit a lot of sweetness and its funny cedar influence, it probably wouldn't make for the greatest beer for food pairings, but I know little about the subject of food pairing and am not even sure why I'm giving an opinion."
"D - Very interesting take on a pale ale. Easy drinking even for a 7% brew. I'm thinking I'd like to see more breweries use cedar for aging."
"Drinkability is fair, as it wouldn't wear on me too much. Overall a nice beer that is kind of interesting, but for $5 for an 11 oz bottle, I think I'll pass next time."
"The cedar is present in the taste as well, but isn't quite as strong. A boozy, saki-like alcohol heat follows a good hop presence, some vegetables, and earthy malt notes. Mouthfeel is a bit over-carbonated, and the medium-thin body finishes dry and crisp, with a nice hoppy bite. This was a decent ""JIPA", but I'll probably be reaching for my fail-safe american counterparts the next time I'm in the mood for a hoppy one."
"11.2oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a murky orangish amber color with a creamy off-white head that possesses some solid lacing and retention qualities. The aroma is a bit sour and musty with some noticeable wood characteristics from the cedar aging. The cedar is very apparent in the taste as well, but really not in a bad way. Overall, I enjoyed this brew for it's uniquenesses. It is not something that I would want to drink very often, but it is really unlike any other beer that I have tried which gives it points in my book. Definitely worth a try."
"Not sure if making it in cedar casks is the culprit, but something wasn't right. I didn't pick up much cedar, nor IPA flavor and the overall product couldn't rescue this beer no matter the style. I didn't ""hate"" this beer, but it was a challenge to finish and enjoy."
"Pours a glowing orange pour with a moderate offwhite head. Smell is musty, woodsy, and perhaps a touch fruity. Taste is dry, musty, and woodsy overall with a nice bitterness in the finish. Mild hop flavor overall for an IPA and it definitely has a unique woody flavor from the cedar cask aging. Interesting."
"Pours a hazy yellow-orange with some significant white crown that laces. Musty basement smell. Taste of woodened and decent English IPA, I do not know the vintage. Dry and drying, with hops and cedar. Sour finish. The bottle said 5% next to Japanese symbol. Bits of wood sediment at the end of the glass."
"D- Sherry-like. Great beer. I could drink one after another and not get bored. Perhaps not a session beer, but great to sit and drink a few and discuss with beer friends."
"D - The abundance of big, but not overwhelming, hop flavor helps to make this a highly drinkable brew. Overall I enjoyed this one, though I am sorry to say that the aroma is a weak point; it is nice but, for some reason, far too weak. I think the cedar adds some distinct flavor components, woodiness and tobacco, but it is subtle enough that it may only be a psychological effect."
"If you want a new take on an old classic, this one is certainly recommended..."
"update: better on tap, both in appearance and nose in particular."
"Poured 750ml bottle to tumbler at Swirl on Castro in SF. Thanks to Timmy Lou the buyer there for the sample. The beer has a nicely rounded amber body with plenty of large bubbled carbonation and a small off-white head that forms a constant smattering of lace during the whole of consumption. The nose is hugely floral - tons of perfumy hops like crushed marigolds and citrus rinds. Taste is also has a well rounded body, showing depth and character. Floral and aromatic hops throughout, bitter finish like a tangerine rind. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and stimulating. Malt body is light but present. Are these unique characteristics from rice? If so, more breweries should take up this practice. A very nice beer."
"Pours a cloudy amber orange. Citric nose with slight bubble gum tones it seems. Flavor is smooth with a touch of bitterness on the tip of your tongue that does not overpower. Even citric tones there as well. Feel is good with a nice bubble to it. Definitely drinkable. A nice smooth brew with even qualities. My first Hitachino. Glad to have gotten to try it. Not sure if Id ever go back to it because of the price, but it was pretty decent."
" You cannot sense that this is high gravity ale. There is certainly an art to this; a clean oak cedar taste prevalent; a smoothness, a lack of big distracting low end that screams for a sashimi combo and some negimaki."
"A very clean taste that begs to be drunk some more. Hey! my glass is empty already! Defiantly a beer to drink after a sauna session."
"Another interesting beer from the good folks at the Kiuchi Brewery. I never would have thought that a cedar-aged IPA would work, but it definitely does. This beer is quite complex and tasty. It's not one that I will be drinking frequently, but it would be nice for an occasional change of pace. I'd suggest trying it for it uniqueness if nothing else. Recommended."
"A solid amber color brew with a big white foamy head and very good lacing. The aroma is a pleasant light flowery cherry scent. The first taste is a refreshing mouthful of biscuit and dry grapefruit hops. The more I drink the more I get the sweet cherry suggestion which occasionally notes other fruit flavors while holding a nice, subtle ale maltiness. I thought this was intriguing. Not sure how much I would want to drink at one sitting, probably not more than a couple based on the unique flavor, but I definitely enjoyed this first experience and will want to try it again, along with some more selections from this Asian brewer. Recommended for a try, although you may find it a little pricey."
"Drinkability: Not an everyday brew, but I definitely like the effect of the cedar and overall the beer is quite complex."
"Drinkability: Flavor, refreshment, uniqueness... the Japanese Classic Ale is down on ALL of it. Paired remarkably well with some moo goo gai pan, too."
"Pours a very cloudy amber, yeasty looking, very thick off white head forms, lace spots, thick layer. Smell is very spicy, woody, yeast, caramel, some floral, nice malts, can really smell the cedar. Taste is bready, touch of caramel, floral, lots of yeast and pine/cedar, spicy alcohol, nice. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, dry peppery dry tea-like finish. Pretty interesting, very different, cedar adds a whole different element, would like to try again. Thanks K&C!"
"Explodes out of bottle all over the counter, five+ finger light brown head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Cedar nose. Flavor is sweet cedar and apple with spices - NOT apple pie, clean finish. $3.89 for a 330ml bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME."
"It smooth but has that hop texture like the American style. Thats really why I don't favor English styles because of the mellow texture."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a tan head. In the nose, cedar wood and slightly lactic. In the taste, a nice small presence of a grapefruity hop, and a woody/ cedar taste. A smooth beer with a nice bitter aftertaste. It actually taste bigger that it is in alcohol. Interesting flavors with cedar."
"All in all a very drinkable beer for such an 'experimental' brew. Unlike anything I've had yet, and considering that - not half bad. An experiment gone right."
"This is a unique and delicious beer, count me as a huge fan!"
"Don't know that I can really call this all that drinkable. This is unique to say the least but it is in no way as refreshing as your average pale ale. A novelty beer in my book."
"D- Actually quite drinkable for the ragion and style."
"Highly recommended. Quite an interesting take on the style. I can see this getting lower reviews from those expecting a straight English IPA - it's not meant to be one. Very enjoyable."
"I'm never disappointed with the Hitachino Nest beers. They craft some quality brews."
"D - Very good! It is extremely easy to drink with a mild flavor that is still unique enough to be worth seeking out - this Kiuchi Brewery is pretty awesome!"
"Not your typical 7% abv, English IPA. Very original on account of the use of cedar casks and very tasty."
"Pours a gorgeous translucent golden amber, cloudy with sediment, topped by a thick white head that fades quickly to just a dusting on top of the liquid. Very fruity aroma. Lots of citrusy notes, like strawberry-lime-orange juice, and dusty, black-peppar spiciness. Not very woody, but I would assume the spiciness comes from the cedar influence. On the palate, sharp juiciness and big carbonation first off, then some citrus, tobacco notes, and pepper. Big carbonation in the mouthfeel, sharp citric hops and a distinct lack of smoothness imparted by barrels. This beer is the antithesis of American beers aged in wood barrels -- rather than slick and heavy, it is light and fresh. Quite good, and very interesting. Well done."
"D- This beer is a nice soft and subtle pale ale with no real notice of flavor from the cedar."
"(forgive that rhyme)"
"The first thing I noticed in the aroma, flavor, and finish was pepper. White pepper to be exact. It was very strong in the finish. There was a wild spiciness that was intriguing, but not at all overpowering. There was some sake influence to the flavor as well. Behind all the pepper and sake flavors, the cedar taste really starts to develop. As it warmed and I worked my way through the beer, the cedar really started becoming prominent. It had a creamy, bitter body. This was very interesting and delicious!"
"a certain cloying richness as i referred to in the smell (perhaps from the cedar cask maturation) i would say keeps this one out of session territory. an odd little pale ale worth checking out though not something i would buy much of. you gotta love that little owl though."
"Drinkability - darn near $4 for a little stubby 12-ounce bottle, but a super beer-tasting candidate. I'll have to buy a few of these just to open a few eyes."
"Overall a nice beer. Easy drinking IPA for sure. I'm not all that confident I got the freshest bottle, since there is no date on the bottle. A good beer, but this brewer's wit is still tops in my book."
"Very interesting and pleasant but too expensive for merely an interesting and pleasant brew."
"The odd flavor really bitch-slapped me at first. I assume it is from the cedar aging but it took a few moments, and a few sips, to get past that."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is medium bodied. The beer is well carbonated. No off flavors or smells noted. This is an unexpectedly highly drinkable beer."
"Overall, I am a little suprised at this beer. I expected to like it, but i didnt expect to like it this much. I guess one thing is that i dont drink too many english ipa's, but i do thing the cedar aging makes this a nice unique beer. Very good."
"If they dont get it thats ok- more for the Magyar!"
"Extremely carbonated, this bottle suffered a brief eruption when opened. After settling down, I gave it a try. The brew is topped with a huge, rocky head, while the liquid is slightly orange and very hazy. The aroma is interesting, with a slightly tart, citric quality. This is joined with a rustic earthiness, a little wood (I couldnt discern cedar, but it was certainly wood  though not quite oak-like), fresh nuts (like chestnutsmaybe tannin), and yeast. The taste is quite dry, with a resiny bitterness that, at times, seems a little harsh. The wood quality is present throughout the beer. Theres a bit of astringency, and quite a lot of the citric quality in the finish. This is certainly an interesting beer, but it seemed pretty jumbled and chaotic."
"The taste had hints of cedar, smoke, mild hops, mild citrus and some roasted malts. The feel, however was nothing to write home about; the carbonation made a biting feel at first, but this quickly faded into a bland and mildly sour finish. In my opinion, this had real potential but was killed by a weak feel."
"Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale (Cedar Aged) pours a cloudly light amber color, at least it would if it weren't all foam. I popped the cap, turned and walked away for thirty seconds, came back and found the bottle overflowing all over the place. This bottle has been gently handled and has sat in my fridge for a month before drinking. So the gusher came as quite a surprise. The beer came in an eleven point two ounce brown bottle. The smell is fantastic, you can smell some cedar in it. The beer does have some ipa notes to it, but its not a traditional English ipa, this beer definitely smells better than it tastes, not to say it's bad, just not as good as it's aroma. Definitely worth a try, just be careful when opening."
"Drinkabilty: An unusual beer that I found rather disagreeable"
"strange beer but good beer. the cedar aging is a nice touch and really makes this worth trying, the nose gets better as you go on, a good drinking beer but one is enough (bomber)."
"Overall: A good interpretation of the English IPA style with an interesting woodiness."
"Hard to say about drinkability. On the one hand this is a truly unusual beer, and very flavorful. I'm glad I tried it. On the other, the cedar is really a little too intense for me to have more than one at a time. That doesn't mean I won't be back for more, though. I rank this as one of the more unique brews currently being produced. If this is an English IPA style, its like no other I've ever had- not even close."
"Definitely a unique beer. I've never really had anything like it, but it's flavors are somewhat harsh and unblended. It's a sipper and not easy to get through."
"D: Cedar flavor is a bit over the top and won't leave the palate. Didn't care for this beer. Started out on the wrong foot and never really got good."
"Certainly unique..and I'm glad I tried it. This isn't something I'd regularly spend $3.50/bottle for, but a solid beer out of Japan."
"A very unique and pleasing beer. Well worth the $9 a bomber. I'm glad I went out on a limb for this one. You should do the same."
"It was strange and unique, and I don't really want to try it again."
"Poured a a hazed peach with a nice tight well retained white head,aromas are somewhat muted in my mind the cedar notes show thru as well as a herbal English hop note but not really anything that sticks out.Flavors seem somewhat muted as well with the cedar dominating but its not overly strong if that says anything,the hop profile is not in your face by any means herbal,grassy notes mainly with a very dry cracker-like malt base.An uninspiring brew but not overly bad just wouldnt buy again."
"Medium body, decent ABV, good carbonation and a slippery, smooth mouthfeel make this an ale that's easy drinkin' and worth try for it's uniqueness."
"It had a orangey brown look. Beautiful smell of lighty citrus, cedar and caramel all blended well. The taste is the same as the smell, all three blended well and arriving on the tongue in waves. Creamy feel in the mouth. Almost too drinkable! I just wish the price tag was a little lower. $5 for 12oz is too high for me to make this a habit."
"The aroma is strong with cedar notes and then very faint notes of caramel malt. Dark cloudy amber color with a firm and lasting thumb thick white head. Smooth caramel malt in the fore is quickly followed by spicy cedar notes that affect both sweeter Italian vanillin flavors as well as medium spiciness. The wood flavor is sharp and pervasive and adds an element Ive not found in any other beer. There is a fair amount of hoppiness, but it melds together with the cider notes as they both touch on resiny and piney flavors thought there is no mistaking the cedar presence. This was a truly unique and rewarding suprise. Damn nice beer. Vastly underrated in my opinion."
"This beer delivers a serious punch in the kisser. The perfumy, woodsy aroma smacks ya upside the head even before you get a chance to look at the glass...(murky rust colored with good head retention, by the way). Smells promise a floral, cider bittering and flavor where the hops should be. Enough malt to make the beer palatable and rounded. But the story here is the solid hop flavors with the cedar amplifying the boquet and offering another bittering character. I've never ate a pine cone before, but now I understand what it would be like."
"Orange leather. Large, bubbly and frothy white head that lasts. Fresh aromas of cut grapefruit, cedar, mango and lemon rinds. Wow. A simply wonderful, coating hop and fruit flavor. Notes of pineapple, fruit and grapefruit but not the overlybitter and resinous kind of hop flavor in American IPAs. A unique and lovely beer that I hope to enjoy many more times."
"Edit: Try this with a very old Cheddar or a smoked cheese and it will blow you away!"
"Nice bottle-conditioned murky muddy yellow to amber. Plenty of lacing results from the initial gushing. Off-white head resolves to a cover after a few minutes. Incredible nostrils punching pineapple and cedar aroma. Pure spruce.. incredible. As if it werent enough, that funky yeast reminds me why I love beer (one needs that every once in a while, eh?). Lots of citrus notes, orangey, very soft hops.. A treasure of an aroma, unarguably unique, yet it feels like an old friend immediately. Highly fruity, floral.. makes me think of spinach even and definitely algae. Firm and mellow bitterness at the same time.. Incredibly tasty and aromatic, lots of different range of flavours that youd never think match together, but you needed Japans advanced beer science to come ahead with that. Very small bubbles procure a biting bite everywhere at once, but it is comfortable if only for the flavors.. I want more in my mouth with every sip. Light-medium body QuaffableOk, maybe not what most of us have come to expect from IPAs, but lets face the facts (or my biased opinion), it tastes better than any IPA Ive had. Tremendous beer!"
"Kiuchi brews great beer (White Ale), mediocre beer (Red Rice Ale) and not so good beer (Sweet Stout). Japanese Classic Ale occupies that vast middle ground. By its nature, it will be many different things to many different people. I can see how some will love it, even as others will hate it. I'm not quite sure how I feel about it, but it may just be too strange for its own good."
"(Perhaps my bottle has matured, I think, now that I have read other reviews.)"
"It's drinkable, yes. Interesting? I suppose. But many parts of this are a wreck, and beneath it all lies a pretty weak stab at an IPA."
"At the very least, it is quite an interesting beer. Not something that I would drink every day, but I'm glad I tried it once."
"Light/medium bodied and very interesting and nicely drinkable."
"Drinkability  This was a decent rendition of cedar-aged English IPA, but I just didnt much care for it."
"The beer pours a dark gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades. There are plenty of floaties present. It has a sweet pale and light crystal malt scent that seems a bit peppery. It must be the cedar casks. The flavor is average. It has a very bitter hop taste that is quite citrusy. It boasts of pale malts and has a slightly sweet, yet dry finish. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium bodied beer with way too much carbonation. This is an average English pale. It's way too bitter and overcarbonated. It's one and done for me."
"Hoppy, slight sweetness balances out an initially striking bitterness, followed by more hoppiness. This is solid. A fine example of the capabilities of the IPA, but nothing outstanding. I always find Hitachino beers really quirky, and this beer has impressed me more than the rest of the line. I don't go for IPAs, but this one is pretty swell. The mouthfeel is full, but not overwhelming. Carbonation is moderate, and drinkability is good. The relatively high alcohol content is very well-balanced, especially with the lingering hoppy aftertaste. Worth a look."
"If you are more familiar with this style of ale and/or type of finish, feel free to drop me a line."
"this pup really smacks me around a bit, hard woody/earthy up front with just insane spices at the end. I'd have to have this beer everyday for a year to figure out all the complexity. This is one of those beers that i'm definately intrigued by and would by again for no other reason than to try and figure out what they were trying to accomplish. Very nice beer and one I'll pursue."
"As soon as I pop the cap, the beer tries to escape the bottle. It is incredibly well carbonated with a 4 finger thick head that sticks around for a long time. The beer is a fully hazy, orangish red color that has large chunks of yeast floating in it, hmm healthy. The cedar is immediately evident in the aroma, quite interesting. There is a bit of fruitiness here in the nose as well, but it is almost not perceptible under the cedar. I get aromatic notes of strawberry, tamarind, almost like a rose wine underneath the cedar. The beer is quite spritzy up front, with a fruity acidity. The finish is astringent and hoppily bitter with a long dry note of cedar that dominates the finish. There are notes of cedar (obviously), citrusy hops, and mint. This is quite an interesting beer, it is a mix of solid hoppiness and cedar."
"D - This was an ok beer, but not a winner. Nothing I would recommend, even for a change of pace."
"Very very good and very drinkable. I find Hitachino beers can be very hit or miss. This one is a home run."
"I'd love to try this with some sushi."
"This is a very enjoyable beer."
"On first tasting Hitchino Nest's JCA I was reeled in by its spiciness, and blown away by its uniqueness! This has got to be one of the most original beers in the world! It's hazy dark amber boddy teems with zesty bubbles beneath a huge head of frothy off-white foam that has amazing staying power and leaves rings of thick, fluffy lace about the glass. The nose is amazingly distinct and cedar-like, but there are other spice aromas in there as well including some nutmeg, a pinch of black pepper, a brush of cinnamon, a sprig of pine, and a spritz of citrusy fruit juice. Wow.... it's really interesting. Once it's settled a bit it's airy in the mouth rather than bristling (as the sight of the bubbling carbonation and rocky head might suggest) with a medium-light body that's slightly dextrinous and moves smoothly across the palate. In the flavor, the spices hit you right upfront; followed by a bit of gently fruity yeastiness (or is that citrusy hop?) and a delicately sweet maltiness that's similar to a glazed doughnut - and wham - there's the dry bitterness as some pine and a slap of cedar re-appear. As the botterness fades from the long finish some more maltiness becomes evident, and some prickly spice appears. It's intriguing and complex, but not particularily drinkable. I prefer the cedar in the nose.... but I guess the two go hand in hand. It's astonishing and mesmerizing in one serving.... let's just leave it at that."
"Pours with lots of fizz and foam, almost sparkling like Champagne. The color is a hazy yellow. (I enjoyed this appearance, even though it doesn't match the style.) I swear I could catch a whiff of cedar in the aroma. A fairly fruity ale (I guess that's the English part) with a fairly sharp bitterness accented by the high carbonation. The finish is a bit tart and very dry (this is Japansese after all.) There's an herbal quality that emerges as the beer warms up in the glass. I really like this beer, probably becaue I like hoppy/bitter beers that finish dry. This beer is a fary cry from most English IPAs that I've tasted, but I do like the Japanese take on the style, and the unusual used of cedar for aging instead of oak."
"Picked up a bottle of this in Ohio of the weekend. Even though I was warned about excessive carbonation I was not expecting the gusher that I received from this little bottle. The gushing really tests ones patience. Eventually the beer settled down a little yielding an extremely dense white foam head atop a cloudy orange body. Smell has has wood notes which fight for dominance with the hops. Nose is a tad dry as well. I really got a large dose of woody/saltyness from my first few tastes. The saltyness eventually fades away to reveal a very crisp hop bite that ends up being quite refreshing and belies this beer's potency. There's no doubt that this is a very interesting IPA and if it weren't for the carbonation issues I would be sure to pick more of this up."
"Drinkability is damaged by the initial cat pee. I'll always be leary of this flavor and will definitely (note proper spelling of the word ""definitely."" There is no 'a' in the word, please learn to spell this word if you intend to write it. It is a pet peeve of mine. If I've misspelled anything in this review or any other review, it is a typo and not because I don't know how to spell.) be reluctant to try it again."
"the cedar doesn't bother me at all. except for the floaties- anxious to try this in the large size.. got one in my closet now!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit creamy....nice bubbly carbonation. This is easy drinking and I could easily have a few...however I think I'd get burnt out on the cedar after that. Overall, a very original brew that I highly recommend to one and all!"
"This is an interesting and extremely complex beer from my favorite Japanese brewery. Dark golden/amber with a huge head of rocky white foam. Nice lacing as well. Aromas are all over the place, but very nice. Cedar hits hard up front, but you also get pine needles, sap, citrus, hops, pepper, other spices, and more. Taste is spicy and very fruity with a unique peppery fruitiness, and a wood-laden, splinter-like dry finish. Unique. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, spritzy, and nice. Drinkability is good, but this could get to be too much for your palate after a couple. As it is, another unique beer from this very solid brewery."
"The beer evacuates the 330ml brown bottle a cloudy copper color with the head portly in size and the texture semi-creamy, the color a winsome light tan, after its demise the lace forms a thick and clinging sheet to circumambient the glass. Nose has a big cedar aroma, spicy and fresh; a different tone for a beer with the start sweet and the rice profile pleasant, top is light to middling in feel. Finish has a delectable hop spiciness and the acidity apropos to the style, once again a treat and certainly, a nice change of pace from the normal run-of-the-mill malt brews I drink, well worth a sample."
"Overall: I just cant make my mind up on this oneone minute I love it, the next I somehow find it just too much. Weird, yet somehow appealing!"
"EDIT: I just noticed that it's 7%abv. Incredibly drinkable for that alcohol. Unreal, actually. I never noticed a bit of alcohol because of all the other weird stuff going on in this one."
"Thanks to merlin48 and clvand0 for this beer making its way to my home. This head pours about 4 fingers with 2 fingers of beer underneath it. Lets hope ther retention is not so good...but this doesn't look like it will happen. After letting it sit, the head falls to reveal beer underneath it! The nose is actually really awesome. There is nothing but cedar in there. It smells a lot like the soda Squirt, wtih some citrus notes, but some real peppery grapefruit, but not like grapefruit from hops. Damn. I like it, but I don't know why. The flavor is full on wood and black pepper, maybe some ginger. The finish is really dry, leaving my throat wanting some moisture. Wow. I like this beer. The feel is pretty thick as well, letting me know I'm drinking a nice beer. Drinkability is good on this one as well. What a strange beer, but what a good beer. I sure hope I can find this one again. Nice nice beer."
"Very hazy beer, plenty of loose sediment. Pours very lively (gusher?), strongly carbonated with a huge cap of foam. Copper colored and murkey. Aroma is overpowering cedar, spicy and citruicy. Flavor is hoppy with a fruity, acidic bitterness and a sappy wood flavor. Crazy beer. Unique take on an IPA, great beer but I'm not sure I could drink more than a couple."
"This is one funky beer! Had on tap this past week at Redbones. Pour was the color of dark tangerine, with a tan head covering the beer. Aroma is full of fruit, but to be honest, I think one notices the pepper and spice in this one a bit more. Taste is really interesting...starts out a bit sour intitially, then finishes with grapefruit, but minus the hops. It's like it's pure grapefruit juice, not an effect from the type of hops used. Medium mouthfeel, prickly carbonation. I think the initial sourness must be coming from the yeast. A very unique tasting beer."
"Filmy ghost of skree of head to start. White grapes, sour green apples, and other fruity esters to nose. On the lighter side of a cider appearance to hue, with all of the accompanying haziness. Heated cracked black pepper to taste, which hides the tenuous malt character. Sour rind adds an undeniable puckering quality, and the heat combined with other earthy qualities imparts a tequila feel to the pour. This is a F-U-N-K-Y offering, with touches of karashi thrown in there  I want to see more folks taking chances like this one does. Ganbatte!"
"I had this on tap at Redbones. The color was hazy orange. It appeared that it was not or only lightly filtered. It had a full cream colored head with a light lace that maintained throughout the beer. It had a bright fruity nose with a hint of hop flower. The taste was not what I expected. Along with the hops you expect from an IPA, there was a spicy almost peppery taste up front. I couldnt identify whether a spice had been added or if this was from the hops, but it distracted me from the flavor. In fact this bite from the spice overwhelmed any malt character. I do feel the hops less than taste them. Light mouth feel average drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is wonderful. Not heavily carbonated despite the misgivings of the gushing bottle. Or perhaps this is why it's less carbonated. I really could drink this all night and keep the bitter dryness of the wonderful cedar lingering on my tongue for a while. Solid drinkability. If I ever end up in Japan, I'm going to knock pints of this like there's no flight out of that floating world."
"Lots of carbonation huge head on top of a hazy golden amber colored body lots of lacing. Just be careful pouring it. Aroma is good spicey and peppery on top of hops, malty woody earthy smell also but pepper dominates. Taste is good dry malt and cedar powered by intense carbonation tingles the taste buds. Hops, spice and pepper mingle together for nice finish to a good beer. Mouthfeel is good medium lots of bubbles to elevated the spices. Drinkability is good nice tastey beer love the pepper and cedar in my IPA. Don't know how this beer got only a 80 rating this is one everyone should atleast try."
"Fruit bread and some caramel malty sweetness are washed away by a fresh pine and citrus hop bitterness, itself falling victim to cedar. At times, the cedar actually gets lost as part of the pine finish. But at other times, it becomes almost astringent -- a cheek-puckering product to be sure. Drink this while in different moods and at different temps to get the full effect -- the cedar while part of a cohesive beer, and the cedar part as its own raucus, uninvited flavor. Interesting."
"Impression/Drinkability: I enjoyed this one quite a bit. The cedar aging lends a unique character that I've never before experienced. Definitely, this will keep Mothra away! I was not impressed with this brewery's sweet(lacto) stout, but this one is a quality product that is well constructed, in spite of the cedar slapping you in the face."
"Sedimented (yeast locked in suspension) medium bright brown color. Sparking head only rises to 1/4 of an inch but I poured it in a wide goblet. Laces are ample. Apple aromas, medium tart like Granny Smiths, some astringent tones. Good body, a little heavy, lower carbonation. Solid flavor, a little atypical, with fruit and decided pie spices, including a mace-like bittering and raisiny senses. Well-bittered, quite piney, very noticeable in the aftertaste. To me, the malt was adequate and interesting, but the hoppiness slightly harsh. An interesting take on an IPA derivation, while not suberbly drinkable to me, maybe among my favorite of the Hitachino beers thus far."
"The mouthfeel was grainy. Smooth at the start with a light crispness at the finish. Nicely drinkable, and a slightly different English style IPA."
"Pours a lazy hazy hazy amber with a huge thin white head which flows where I don't want it to flow. Tastes nice and hoppy, but well rounded to the malt flavors. Actually this is a very well crafted beer and if it were not for the slight over-carbination problems I would have scored it higher. A solid mellow IPA."
