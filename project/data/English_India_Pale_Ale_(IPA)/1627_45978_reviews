"Coppery Amber color. Mild flowery nose. Nice sweet malt taste with the hop bitterness in the background. Not a typical west coast IPA but still quite interesting. Not sure what the point of the organic certification means to most beer drinkers but it means nothing but a marketing ploy to me. Still, good and reasonably priced ($7.50 for a 6-pack)."

"I was hoping for so much more from this one. Only bright spot was the cost, I only paid $4.50 for the bomber"

"Not an ipa, taste more like a lager"
"Ps. would you really be that worried about organic after ingesting alcohol?! For hipsters..."

"A disappointing offering that really skimps on any malt character. One-dimensional hop bitterness with very little aroma is another bust. Despite decent looks and feel, the heart and soul of any decent beer is taste and aroma. This beer is sadly deficit in those areas."

"A decent IPA with some pine and orange characteristics."
"Overall: This is not bad, as in drain pour, it's just not as good as other IPAs I have tasted. I have been looking for a good organic beer I can enjoy everyday, and this failed. There are far too many IPAs with superior flavor that I would much rather drink."

"D: Not a great beer but drinkable and was actually expecting worse here. Didn’t really strike me as an English IPA however this might be one of the best Organic brews I have come across yet. Not sure why it is so hard to make a good organic beer but I applaud Eel River’s efforts. Not something that is going to be a regular although worth trying."
"O - a really good beer. Not an award winning IPA, but a really tasty beer. Couldn't taste the organic."

"Pours a hazy orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, earth, floral, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and slight herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but has a better hop presence in the aroma in my opinion."

"Kind of a strange brew. Not like Bob and Doug though. It doesn't smell like much of anything. Kinda yeasty I guess. No hop that I can detect. Taste is just muted. A little hop taste. Bread. Tobacco maybe. Just not a good choice when there are so many great IPA's out there. I really hate to not recommend a beer, especially when brewers put their heart and soul into their craft but I just cannot say I like this beer."

"Overall - I actually think this is a good beer, but not at all what I expected from an IPA. It's more of a slightly hoppy Belgian Wit. There is a distinct orange flavor with a little hops. A good beer, but for the style, not at all what I would be looking for if I'm trying to drink an IPA."

"If this beer were a woman, it would look great on paper. Nice liitle body. You'd have no problem taking her around you friends. but she's not very interesting, and you're asking the waitress what else in on tap."

"Light honey color, clear. Minimal cream head. Ew... smells kinda funky. Smells like alcohol (lots) and some citrus. Tastes of... maybe soap and hops? Citrus perhaps. Well, the mouthfeel is nice an bubbly at least. Not impressed. I knew organic was a mistake. Well, overall, about 3 of 5. That's being generous. Wouldn't recommend it. At least it was only $2.50."

"brutally underrated here on BA. it pours redish and clear with a nice two inch off white head. the nose is aromatic hops to the max, sticky and red and west coast in origin. they are sappy and rich, beautiful. the flavor is about the same, a little too sweet before the bitter, which is a minus, but there is also some neat red malts going on, which give a nice depth. some pine and some fruit, dense. the mouthfeel is thicker, maybe too much so, but the carbonation is good and the flavor stays in my mouth forever. its not the best ipa ever, but there is a lot to like here, and i think the masses have been too harsh with this one. it is organic and strong and pretty solid any way you slice it. ill drink it again gladly..."

"The beer pours an orange-amber color with a white head. The aroma has some perfume-like hop notes, as well as some light orange citrus. The flavor is a nice mix of orange citrus and biscuit malt, with a hint of bitterness. There is also a little grapefruit in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, it had its moments. The look and smell had me hooked, but something was off with the taste."
""
"Taste is really sweet with some caramel notes. Turns flat pretty quickly and not much going on. There are some decent hop notes but I find this beer to be pretty average and too sweet for my tastes."
""
""
""
"O - I would never get this again, though I appreciate the effort to go organic."
""
""
"O: A little bit too malty and stale for my tastes but not an unsatisfying beer. Not that all IPAs need to be hop-bombs but there's something that just isn't bright enough about this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall this is a pretty good representation of the English ipa style. Would not mind having this one again!"
""
""
""
"Another I bought accidentally again 2-1-2014. It is a bit easy drinking, but not bad. I'll stick with my review."
"This was an odd IPA. It smelled amazing. I was all in. But then after a few swallows I was confused. The flavor to me is backwards. The hops come first with a malty finish that's underwhelming. I think I'll pass in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a bit of an underwhelming beer. I am not sure I would classify this as an English style IPA because of the immense citrus, but it is definitely not a strong AIPA. Honestly, this is just a bit one-dimensional. This beer is refreshing, but really just weighs in at average for me."
"Update: Had this beer again the other night, it was much better and I actually liked it this time. Also, it's being organic makes me happy."
""
""
""
"O: Avoid this beer."
""

"Trying the IPA from Eel River and it probably should be renamed Imperial Malt Ale...cuz that's all I really smell and taste. The beer poured a clear copper color with thin white head. The smell is mostly malt not alot of hops. The taste is malty. The mouthfeel is medium body and low carbonation. Overall it is not a great IPA....seems more like an amber ale."
""
"O - I think this is a pretty darn good EIPA - dry caramel malt character, minerally yeastiness, firm bitterness and a medium body that means I can enjoy several in a session."
""
"O- Not impressed with this at all. first beer i had from eel river so i need to try others but this one is a big miss for me."
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down quite smoothly."
"Overall: I expected this beer to be disappointing. The sale rack is an iffy place to shop, and the first impressions weren't great. I was surprised. Nice bite, good beer."
"Pours a rich copper color with a chill haze and a nice soapy froth. Semi sweet nose, mildly fruity with some malt poking through. In the flavor, caramel, fruity hops (berry/mango/citrus) and a light roasted character. Bitterness is adequate for the style. Medium to full bodied brew, modest carbonation and a smooth overall feel. Overall, I thought this was a very fruity IPA which was alittle unusual but not bad."
"Overall a terrible beer, I will not try anything else by this brewery most likely"
"Poured from 12 ounce bottle into a generic tulip. Purchased from total wine in charlotte last week (no bottle date) Copper/gold on color, small head with no retention to speak of. Aroma is a very off-putting rendition of rotting vegetables. For the first time in recent memory, i don't want to taste a beer. I really don't. But I shall. Taste is also really bad, kinda like liquid socks. The after taste is also poor. This beer doesnt taste like an English IPA or any other type of IPA."
"If there was ever an idea of watered down flavorless IPA this has got to be it. Gives organic beer a bad name. Real bad. How and the heck can you release something this horrible tasting is beyond me."
"Ok here is the deal with Eel River brews. The ONLY way to enjoy their beer is on tap. Several years ago I was the assistant brewer, and there are a lot of good things to say about the brewery in general. It is kept scrupulously clean, the ingredients are of extremely high quality, and the organic standards are militantly enforced. However the bottling line is pretty damn outdated and presents a lot of opportunities to create a stale, oxidized, almost undrinkable product. Try two bottles of the same beer from different bottling runs, I can just about guarantee they won't taste the same. Yes, this place makes beer toooo heavy on the malt flavor, and the IPA is wildly underhopped. The Acai Berry brew is an abomination that makes baby Jesus cry. But the Hef available only at the brewery and only seasonally is truly epic, and the imperial stout demands respect. The quality of the beers decreases rapidly with distance from the Eel River, and the smaller the bottle the worse the beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, it’s a solid beer but there are other EIPA’s that I would pick first."
"O: Foul."
"Drink- I just didnt find this appealing to drink. Finished my taster, had some water, a couple of tasters of Sculpin and was happy!"
"Overall. Good tasting. Seems like an english ipa made by a west coast brewer that really did their best to restrain the hopping. Fine with me, hops kick ass."
"Overall, this is not worth checking out. I feel like they thought using organic ingredients meant the recipe only needed half the ingredients."
"Overall an ok beer. Probably wouldn't buy it again. But it did lift my thoughts that organic beers aren't that good. Gunna try a couple more now."
"D: Although the beer starts off very well due to the complexity of the flavors, it begins to lose the hoppy quality and begins to taste primarily like a brown ale by the end. Okay, I guess."
"overall im very regretful to buy this six-pack."
"Color: pretty, but not an IPA color, maybe a 15 on the SRM scale."
"D - I don't think I will be going back to this beer. For the price and organic label, I expected a fresh tasting IPA, and it missed the mark for me. I didn't hate it, but I feel like it's just not for me."
"served from 22oz bottle."
"Despite my low scores, props need to go to Eel River for providing widely available, reasonably priced organic beers. I'm thinking that at the moment their priorities may be focused on making the beer organic rather than making it the best beer it could be, but it's great to have options like this on the market."
"Not sure how the organic-ness affects this beer. Again, not bad."
"An orangeish copper beer pours clear with a decent amount of head and lacing. Citric hops are appreciated in the aroma. This beer is well balanced and not very bitter for an ipa. Overall, not a bad effort, but like most of this breweries beers, IPA is not very drinkable."
"The bitterness seems a bit too harsh here. Sharp is pretty much the one word that comes to mind with each sip, and it eventually affects the drinkability."
"D/M: smooth on the pallet, lack of nice taste notes hurt the drinkability, slight carbonation tingle, bought the 22oz bomber for 3 bucks so I'm not at all upset"
"As a side note - I notice this beer gets very little love here. I will say though, the bad reviews are generally the bottled version of this and most are east of the Mississippi. Like many IPA's, they are better when drank fresh and on tap. There's no way this beer deserves (when drank fresh) a C- as many of the reviews indicate. Try this one fresh and on-tap, you won't be disappointed."
"Resume: I am highly impressed with this beer. Great malts, great bitter levels, nose is spot on for style. Try a fresh (warm) one today."
"bought a whole case of eel river organic to share with wifey. We were not impressed with any of the offerings... some would say that organic beer doesn't deviate from the flavor... i'd beg to differ.. and I'd beg anyone out there, not to buy this case for me."
"End of story: I like this one... will I buy it again? probably not... I really, really like it but the IPA scene is really overcrowded with great beers in my part of the midwest. this is one of them, for sure... but it's hard to find and I would probably pick some of the cheaper options first... the Organic label doesn't really do much for the taste, and is therefore worthless in terms of the additional pricetag."
"Another good beer from Eel River."
"A drinkable IPA not a great one The organic properties do nothing for me."
"Mouthfeel is slightly creamy. Drinkability is middling because it is unbalanced."
"D: Apparently the brewery has said this is more of an English style IPA, but it doesn't state that anywhere on the bottle. My impression was that it just wasn't very fresh. Still, I found it drinkable enough, and I like that it's organic. I might pick this one up again if I get onto an Organic-only kick, but if I'm feeling nostalgic again I'll probably go for some North Coast."
"Nose is pleasant but quite tame. Sweet light malts and husky grains with hoppy hints coming in the form of honeysuckle floral notes and a bit of grassiness. Hints of citrus waft in and out. A touch of lemon bitterness shows up in the flavor profile. Hop flavors noticeably on the light side. Quite grainy and crisp with a slight medicinal quality creeping in at the swallow. Not a bad beer, but forgettable and too tame for an IPA, even an English one."
"Overall: I don't think I'll have a problem drinking the 5 remaining bottles, but I'm pretty sure there will always be something more desirable available, so I likely won't pick this up again."
"D:First and probably last time I drink this brew. Very mild, thin, and not very enjoyable"
"For an English IPA style it is drinkable. I prefer American IPAs, so this won't be on my repurchase list. But for English IPA fans it is worth a try."
"Tastes malty wet with decent hop flavor, mild hop bitter, strong carbonation, and a candy/sugar-like end that does dry in the finish. Like the sugary of a sweet-tart. Hop flavor is woody english, oranges, and baby aspirin. Hop bitter is quite clean and hits late. Esters are strawberry and muted apricot. The finish comes across much drier as I get farther through the bottle. Strong carbonation and md-light body that's a bit cream with fruit character. Overall, this beer is decent."
"Drinkability - Probably fantastic beer if you like really bitter ones, but this one's not for me I'm afraid."
"It's not my favorite IPA but it's alright. It also hides the 7% alcohol pretty well. One final note: Don't drink this one ice cold. The flavors only reach their peak as the beer warms up a bit. It's an entirely different and unpleasant beer when poured straight from the fridge."
"Not really impressed. More of a ""Session"" IPA. Hides the 7.2% brilliantly though! That's impressive, but not a West Coast style. I got duped in the store: knew nothing about it, saw West Coast & IPA on the label, thought it'd be huge. Apparently it's English. Oh well."
"Pours a straight amber with minimal head. Slight lacing. Smell is sweet caramel and bitter oily hops. Taste is not what I anticipated. Simply put, this is a very sweet malty beer, malts of maple and honey, there is a hops backbone. I am no hardcore ""hophead"" but this does not fit my idea of an IPA, and I don't like sweet beers--especially when I want a mouth of hops. Thumbs down."
"I don't know if it's phsycological, but because it's organic, I don't get the hangover of other IPAs. I drank 5 of 6-pack and was able to function the next day for the entire day!"
"Value: This brewery seems to get minimal love on this website, but I think this is another impressive beer for those of us who don't always want to spend 12 dollars on a sixer."
"This isn't a bad ""beer", but isn't a good ""IPA""."
"Drinkability depends on ones tolerance for the harsh bitterness which comes in at the end. It's not quite as balanced as one would like, but it's a strong, fairly agreeable IPA with a couple, er, interesting elements to offer."
"- Even for an English style IPA, this is still a very hoppy brew. I don't quite understand a lot of the comments saying it isn't. To fit the style, it could even be less hoppy. I just think many make the wrong assessment of sweet sugars etc as hops in mega IIPA's etc. The hops here play perfectly in the sand with the malts."
"Overall a good, standard ale."
"poured from bottle into pint...golden with copper hues under a finger thick white head. fairly lighter in color than i expected. has noticeable sticky lacing that should be hallmarks of any ipa. on the nose is a some floral notes and quite a bit of malt. nothing overwhelming. taste up front is hoppy at first but then gets quite tame. some mild citrusy flavors make an appearance then the malts take over and only a faint bit of hoppiness remain for finish. i feel that this is more in line with an apa, but then it is a west coaster, so i probably expected more aggressive dry hopping and more hops overall. does have an excellent mouthfeel. good medium body and carbonation lever is where it should be. i'd say overall a very mediocre and restrained ipa, won't become a staple of mine or anything i would look forward to trying again. not to say its a bad beer, its just far less hoppy than i was hoping for and expecting."
"M/D: It was pretty heavy I thought. I would have rather purchased as a single, and not a six pack. I will go with the organic aspect, but it was very one note."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Not an award winner, but a good beer without question. Would like to have again, and I may be editing this review if I can get my hands on a fresher specimen."
"It's very easy to drink, and a pleasant no thrills beer, aside from the aroma which was off IMO. More of a pale ale if anything, but a good one to lure a novice into a hoppy world."
"Drinkability??? Very given the ABV just look out!"
"D - An average IPA that I'm not impressed by. The malt is pretty big and the hops should come up more to balance. Not bad but it needs some work."
"Overall, friendly and well-behaved, very drinkable. A bit more like a standard pale ale than IPA. Would make a decent ""everyday"" IPA."
"I found this to be an enjoyable beer. The integration of ingredients certainly adds to the overall effect; it's a solid effort. However, nothing about it is so impressive as to encourage frequent purchase. It could be a lot worse."
"Jon's bottle. Golden yellow with a white head. A good bitterness, though no aroma. The hops do not really get there, the weakness of organics. As if watered down taste, yet drinkability is fine, mouthfeel is median. A bit below average for the style."
"D - I like it enough. I would have a few if it was what there was."
"Cool that it is organic, though. This is a quite drinkable offering, but not a standout."
"Excited about the idea of this beer. Not as satisfied with the taste. It is a good IPA, it's just nothing special. Occasionally when I eat organic foods they tend to have more flavor. It's not really the case with this beer. It's a solid IPA and if you want to support the organic ideal you should drink this beer. Not much smell. Has the bitter hops flavor, but not overwhelming. A little earthy tasting."
"This is an IPA? Wow - I've never tasted a thinner entry to the genre. I don't detect any hop presence at all, and resultingly, no hop bitterness either. The price is right, but this may be the Miller High Life of craft brews. I'm amazed at the 7.0 ABV, but this is a beer with almost no redeeming qualities. Avoid..."
"Overall, this is an alright beer. But, it didn't seem much like an IPA (and that's what it says it is right on the front!). Tasted like maybe a mixture of 2/3 pils and 1/3 IIPA... strange. I probably won't get again, but I wouldn't particularly advise against... just don't expect an IPA."
"This isn't a bad beer, really. It just doesn't measure up to my expectations as a 7% abv IPA. A Lagunitas IPA is just under 6% alcohol and it sips way better than this one. I would love this if it could have the same taste but be a 4.5% abv Ordinary Bitter . It goes down really fast and is neither a sipper nor a session."
"D-Constructed ""just fine"" but rather dull overall. Certainly drinkable but nothing I would seek out. Very balanced, not what I am looking for from an IPA made in California."
"drinkability: solid IPA, just not as powerful as I would like. then again it could have been aged, bo date. Oh well thats my score."
"D- This is a very drinkable IPA. It's well balanced and that makes it very sessionable. This won't wreck your palate although a little more hop taste in this wouldn't be a bad thing. Overall though this is a good stepping stone to the style or craft beer in general."
"This was a pretty good beer. Much darker than a typical IPA, maybe even darker than an amber. Good carbonation, excellent aroma and a flavor that was a little malty for an ip but very good nonetheless. I would recommend."
"A little light on the body, almost watery. Could be a little less bitter. Overall pretty drinkable IPA but probably wouldn't buy it again."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" beige head over the clear dark coppery amber brew. Head lasts very well, with lasting coating lace. Aroma is lightly of citrusy hops. Taste starts with some sweetness, which gives way to the citrus in the middle, where it sets up shop and intensifies through the close. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is great. Good brew, and being organic didn't even mess it up!"
"Its another ipa that doesn't bottle date, so that's probably where the inconsistency comes from."
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts - This IPA is very tame, and very very drinkable, it would be even more drinkable if the ABV was lower, but not to strong anyway. It offers fruity, pine like & floral hop characters while keeping the bitterness low, and balancing it all with lots of biscuit, caramel, and even molasses malty flavors. I really like this IPA as a more drinkable one, like if I wanted to drink 3 or more of them, I could no problem, and that's what's great about it. Id say it's worth a try for sure. Cheer!"
"Overall a drinkiable beer. Not a exactly a IPA in my book."
"This is definitely better than the last time I had it, and probably more better on draft than in bottle. I'm quite happy with the flavor and mouthfeel, drinkability is good, and it's an all-around good beer. Tasty IPA I have no problem recommending. Again, coming from a freshly tapped keg, my mileage may vary from yours."
"Very well balanced beer, a little too bitter."
"Flavors a good and bold but shortlived and a bit simple. A hit of malt gives way quickly to nothing and then, seconds later, leaves you with a dull grapefruit bitter finish. Actually tastes better than it sounds although not a typical IPA. A bit thin and short for me all the way around."
"D) A very good IPA and organic!"
"Very drinkable, but lacking in some big flavors. I'm all for organic, but it just lacks in the flavor department for me. Easy beer to session, might better fall into the category of a pale ale. It is growing a bit on me as I consume further."
"I am excited to see a USDA Organic beer. Mostly because I've read here and there, that hops are extremely prone to pests and disease and are subjected to a lot of pesticides and insecticides. I'm not an extreme health nut, but I'm all for a little less sodium cyanate in my brews :)"
"A bit thin feeling, medium conditioning."
"D- pretty average if you ask me. a little stronger than the average IPA. easy enough to finish. id probably have another if i was craving IPA that night."
"D: It provides a good flavor profile, rather deep, without being too aggressive. Nice and pleasant, though nothing special."
"Eel River's IPA pours a clean amber with a cream colored head that settles to a thin film. Carbonation is a bit vigorous for the style, but overall nice. The aroma expresses citrusy, piney hops, with a thick malty backbone. The beer's flavor begins sweet, with notes of caramel and toast, followed by a dry, citrusy hop finish. This is a full bodied IPA, and it coats the palate like oil. Overall, it's quite drinkable and is a good IPA to quaff."
"Purchased a favorite bottle shop after an evening of enjoying brews. Poured into glass after a gentle pour. Very little smell and nothing really to set this IPA apart from the other IPA's out there. I am enjoying it but I will probably never buy it again."
"A very nice looking beer that is well crafted and exemplifies what a west coast IPA has come to mean. Oh and its organic which is just extra cool in my book."
"D: not a bad brew, I guess. Something seemed awry with the hops, a real hop essence was not happening in this beer. I want to try the stout they offer and that is probably going to be it, I pass on this one"
"The above review is from some year old notes. I had a fresh one tonight and it was much better. Very nice floral hop nose. One finger off white head, fair lacings. Taste was more bold grapefruit hops than I expected. Most of the organic beers of various styles seem to be less satisfying than the alternatives. Anyway a nice hoppy IPA with a very nice malt backing. I recommend it. Only problem is how do you know it is fresh? No date could be found on the bottle."
"D: Easy to drink. I look forward to trying more form Eel River."
"The hop shows up in the taste, from start to aftertaste. The malt provides a solid base. Full bodied, with the richness of whole milk. The alcohol is well-hidden. Overall, a decent offering for an AIPA."
"The taste is not nearly as good as the aroma. Fundamentally, this beer isn't well balanced. There is too much biting hop bitterness that takes over from the otherwise nice orange blossom and rind flavors. The acerbicness is just over the top and rides herd over the better parts of this beer. It's too bitter, doesn't have the bready malts underneath to balance it out, and doesn't bring out enough oily and estery hop resin to make this one a keeper. It's not bad, it will clean off the palate, but it is a flawed IPA. The ABV is quite prevalent too and leaves a bit of a boozy afterfeel in the throat."
"Overall this a decent beer but it's nothing special. Not one to avoid but not one to seek out either."
"Too expensive for what it is, disappointing, no real hop component in flavor."
"At first I tasted some toasted malts with some caramel and toffee in the second part. Very little bitterness and in the very end a low-dry finish. Just a bit more complexity than the aroma. A touch grainy and lemon peel bitterness. To me the bitterness didn't hold on to the palate long enough. Medium-low carbonation. Very easy to drink as it tasted almost more like a pale ale than an IPA."
"Nice IPA here on the upper end on bitterness but it has the malt backbone and complexity to make it better than average. One of the stronger flavored examples this isn't bad at all and probably the best of the Organic examples of the style."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied with nice carbonation. Drinkability was good, probably could have had two or three more with my lunch."
"Edit: I'm bumping up the score. Gets much nicer as it warms."
"I keep drinking and thinking....rather flummoxed by what's here, or rather what isn't. I'm in an IPA rut. Whoa is me."
"This beer may be just a hair above average. I doubt I'll ever buy it again, but I wouldn't refuse if offered one."
"Poured into bubble pint glass. Poured with a white head that quickly dissipated, leaving a moderate amount of lacing. The beer poured a semi-hazy orangeish-amber color. Not as much hop aroma as a lot of IPAs, but a pleasant scent none the less. Much like the aroma the hop taste is not an overpowering kick in the mouth. Much smoother and has better balance than A lot of the style. Very drinkable, this IPA will not kill your tastebuds, allowing you to actually enjoy tasting several of these. Overall an average IPA that you should try if you see it, but I'm not sure it's worth searching for."
"Well balanced and easy to drink."
"d: Thanks to joepais for the chance to try this one. It wasn't bad, but there are plenty of better IPA options out there."
"Notes: A smooth beer with the expected hop bitterness.I really don't care about Organics for my beer,but I liked this beer and if the Organics made it better then great. This one will not blow you away but it beats having a SN Torpedo any day."
"Pours a deep amber with a nice 2 finger white head that dissappers very quickly. Has that english malt smell, with a touch of alcohol. No hops can be detected. Let me just say that I'm not a fan of english ipa's, but this one has enough going on to hide what to me is normally a poor malt choice. Very smooth drinking beer. Smoother than a SNPA. Has that wierd after-taste that all of the ""organic"" beers I've tried seem to have? The label says 7.2%, but I am really doubting that. I would reccomend this beer as a starter to a session since it's just all-around mild and not very flavorfull in any aspect."
"Eel River has a pension for pumping out decent organic beers every time. I wouldn't say that this beer is on par with, let's say Rubicon, but for the price I would say it is a definite contender if you want to drink five or six beers to be merry! Head lasts quite a while so even in the bottle so they have a good co2 system going..."
"Average of-white head, better lacing than foam, most of it all gone not soon after the pour. Very light haze to the amber red to orange color. In the nose there's a thick presence of uncooked hops, wild field grasses and orange citrus, over time more territory acquired by cocoa, malt without any deep roasted qualities, a little cherry or fig fruit, persistent without trying to knock you over. Medium-bodied, above average foaminess during mouth entry, creates an initial impression of more heft. Dries out your mouth in a dulling manner, with each additional sip you feel you cannot register as many impressions as before. Still the pine resin, tea leaf, raw almonds and orange peel notes come through decently. At times minerally. Hard to get at that cocoa maltiness here, most there during aftertaste. Has too much bottom heaviness to be that bitter, this requiring some lift and cut. A decent quaff, nothing more nor less."
"the beer poured an amber goled color with a white-tan head that left the glass thickly laced. there was hardly an aroma to speak of. a slight bit of hops and fruit was all there was to be found. the taste was the most disappointing aspect of the beer. minimal hops, which is naturally bad for an ipa, and possibly some fruits. it was smooth, i will give it that much, but it doesn't drink very well as a result of the flavor."
"This is a drinkable beer, and it goes well with Indian/Middle Eastern food. However, this is one of the strangest IPAs where the malts are just as prevalent as the hops."
"A good west coast IPA easy to drink and went down well watching the game."
"""I suppose I'll come back here if the price is right, but I doubt I'll make a special trip... the aroma really killed it for me, and there's simply not a whole lot going on, you know."""
"Picked up a single at Four Firkins. Poured a clear reddish amber with a tall white head. The aroma and flavor lack significant hops for the style, but there's still a nice mix of juicy orange-citrus an biting grapefruit flavors and sensations. For the strength (7.2% according to the bottle) it's quite drinkable, but really more a of a strong pale ale."
"D - This is a pretty good IPA. Very citrsuy."
"D - Good drinkability. Feels more like a 5% then a 7% to me."
"A murky copper pour finishes off with a two-finger thick tan head. Closer inspection reveals some sediment floating around. Head retention is quite good, with some rolling lacing left behind. Subdued aromas of citrusy hops and caramel rise to the nose. Tastes a bit odd at first, with the hops almost being hidden by the malts. Some spice and yeast reveal themselves after a couple of drinks, and some earthy vegetal notes work themselves in as well. As usual, I always respect what folks are doing organically, but it doesn't always suit my tastes."
"D- I really don't have anything bad to say about this beer. Its decent and drinkable and definitely and IPA. It fits the bill. It just doesn't have much...character. Worth a try an maybe good for an into IPA. It's certainly above average."
"D - Very average. Nothing outstanding about this beer. It may appeal to ale drinkers who are turned off by bitter, hoppy brews but it will leave hopheads (like myselt) quite disappointed."
"Overall not a bad beer, just not great."
"Other than that, the nose has nothing other than unexciting yeast. It kept thinking of a hot dog stand (probably the buns? i doubt they put pork hearts in it)...wierd i know. The hops are almost non existent, it tastes like an amber ale without any malt sweetness. Would not buy again."
"12 ouncer, w/o freshness indication. Pours moderately cloudy orangy medium amber, under a puffy oatmeal head, that stays and stays and then leaves just a smattering of lace blobs. Nose is malty and nothing special. This one is a little light in the hops and a tad watery in the mouth feel. Still surprised by the very low scores for this offering. Reasonable, sessionable ale. Could use some more hop jolt to fit into and compete with the heavy hitter of the AIPA world."
"D - I was disappointed with this IPA overall. While fairly drinkable, this was a pretty unbalanced and mediocre affair. This one could be cleaned up a bit with a more balanced flavor profile, more sturdy malt backbone and a finish that is less harsh on the palate."
"Overall: I might try it again but I hope I can find it in a sixer. Reminds me of Butte Creeks organic IPA, which also had a strange aftertaste, maybe it's because it's organic."
"ONCe again I don't know if there is a duplicity but I add the full name since I learnt there are the two kinds: organic and not. The taste is too bitter but that is the way it is suposed to be. Very strong in alcohol but it's not noticeable by taste. Great head and nice amber colour."
"A: Lightly tarnished copper, thin layer of foam - 3.75, S: Full aroma with more malt than hops, both bready and earthy - 3.5, T: Quite bitter, tastes of grapefruit and slightly dry and pungent - 3.5, M: 3.5, D: An above average IPA, nothing outstanding but drinkable - 3.75"
"Pours a cloudy coppery amber with a giant off white foamy head. The head is huge with great lacing. The smell is nice with a bread yeast scent and little else . The taste is crisp then bitter with bread yeast and some mild citrus hop flavors. The yeast and bitterness are pretty strong,but there are little else is in the flavor. The m/f is light with the mild flavors mixing OK. Not a bad beer,but organic beers are alittle weak in flavor."
"Medium-bodied, under-carbonated, not very good. Meh."
"d. Good, solid IPA that avoids being overly bitter and overly hoppy. It hides the 7% abv well. The only thing that greatly detracts from the ale overall is the biscut/yeast/must notes that follow through into the aftertaste in an almost offensive manner. Not bad, and worth a shot, but not really a regular or a sessionable one for me."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm, bisquity scent with nice hop bitterness and a touch of caramel malt. The taste is decent. It has a very bitter hop bite along with a roasted/bisquit malt flavor. The malt bill is complex, but the hops are overpowering. The mouthfeel is average. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average IPA, but nothing I'd look to buy again in ther future."
"The taste is also nice, very juicy with some caramelized fruit, a light raisiny sweetness a but dominated by hoppy taste and bitterness, mostly mixed citrus and pine."
"This beer is on the lighter end of body for the style. Easy mouthfeel, but that aftertaste made the beer a have one only in terms of drinkability."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ copper color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, piney hops, and gingerbread like maltiness. In the taste, same as aroma, with a bit of sweetness in the gingerbread maltiness. A hoppy bitterness and medium mouthfeel, with a semi dry piney hop in the aftertaste. Nice hops and balance, somewhat English like, and just above average for style."
"An above average IPA, very high in ABV and hoppy but also well balanced. This beer provides its self on being organic and all which doesn't really concern me too much as I don't believe that garbage. What is most is important is the taste and in that department this beer does well. I wish the brewery had more offerings at my go to store."
"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Poured into a pint glass. Golden copper color with a frothy off-white head. Modest lacing. Aroma is fruity, but not in an IPA way. I get cranberry and raspberry instead of citrus and caramel. Weird. Flavor is malty caramel, with accents of the cran-raspberry and a very weak bitterness. As it warms, I get vanilla and playdoh notes. This is at best a mediocre pale/amber ale. It's yeast- and malt-forward instead of hop-forward. Needs way more bitterness."
"D: Great tasting, plus it's ""brewed with the finest certified organic hops and barley."""
"It stands proud as an organic ipa that doesnt taste off, but it's really got nothing else to bring to the table. I will recommend it to others, but the fact that it's 7% kinda hurts it. I dont want to waste my sobriety on a mediocre beer. If this sucker were 5%, i'd buy it by the case."
"12oz brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a hazy amber-red body with a half inch or so of off-white head. Orange, grapefruit, and pith hit you over the head in the aroma, very pleasing and expected. Tastes like caramel malt with an equal parts orange and pith to balance it out. Full slightly slick body with surprisingly little carbonation. Clean on the finish, despite the lack of carbonation - this beer stops well short of viscosity, which helps. A solid IPA for sure, plenty of hops without losing a sense of balance. Good stuff."
"D - For an organic not bad. However, there are much better examples of an IPA, so I can't rate this one very high."
"Drinkability is just a tad above average. IPAs are one of my favorite styles of beer and I have to say that I prefer a lot of other brewers IPAs over this one from Eel River."
"Solid amber color with a fair off-white head and good lacing. Pretty non-descript aroma, a light malt and flowey hop perhaps, a little swampy. The flavor is a bitter herbal hops, with grassy background and a very light malt overtone. Fair carbonation and medium to thin bodied. Not bad, not great. Quite bitter, not much malt or sweetness. Medium drinkability."
"Rich and full mouthfeel, pretty satisying. Slightly above average drinkability, but not earthshaking."
"This is a pretty well balanced IPA. A bit strong on the bitterness but still very drinkable."
"I'd recommend this beer. I bought this bottle at 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"Plenty of bitterness from the hops, maybe some tangerine or grapefruit smell. Seems like bittering hops were the focus more so than finishing hops. The mouth feel is really sharp, it attacks your palate. There is a strange flavor, maybe wet paper? Bitterness dominates, not all that well balanced by the malt. The bitter aftertaste lingers for a while. For me, this one is too bitter to drink more than one."
"A nice beer but its not nearly my fave.I would have it again maybe from a tap.Good jon EEL RIVER."
"D: Good dry bittering ipa with above average drinkability. Not terribly complex but nice flavor and solid example makes it hard to turn down another."
"Poured into a pint glass on a sunny Saturday, with a ball game on the radio. Orange/amber in color with a frothy white head. Dominant aromas are citrus and malt. Taste is sweet malt, caramel, followed by a nice hop bitterness. With a medium body and moderate carbonation this tastes more like a good ESB than an IPA. Whatever they want to call it, it's good!"
"Overall- Big potent aroma and flavor make this Organic IPA quite tasty! Definitely find this 1 and try!"
"Had my first organic beer during a tasting event with a few friends. A slightly aggressive pour results in a two finger, white foamy head with a cloudy yellow body. A nice fruity aroma, but I'm having a hard time picking up the hops in this IPA. Thin mouthfeel with a mild hop taste and some malty notes. Not really what I was expecting and kind of lacking for an IPA."
"D: Very drinkable with a memorable bite. This is an organic ale that does a great service to the movement."
"Overall, this was a mediocore IPA and nothing to write home about, organic or not..."
"Drinkability: solid IPA that is very drinkable. This one will please the hophead looking for something that is not a DIPA."
"Pours a light orange-almost a yellow brown. Head is off white and disappears quickly. I can't pick up much hop aroma after the pour-but as the beer warms I get a good fresh hop aroma. Taste is some what astringent with light malt flavor and a slight bitter in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability good-I would like to try this on tap at the brewpub to see if I like it more"
"The taste is in your face bitter with a slight maltiness. In the mouth is taste of alcohol and gives a slight burn to the roof of the mouth and back of the throat while being pretty dry. One of the best organic beers I have had."
"It's a pretty average IPA. Good, but I don't think I'd remember or notice it above other IPA at the store."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of light auburn, with a thin off white head - nose of hops, mild malt, and something that I do not know  taste of floral hops, pretty perfume, and some malt - body is silky, and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of floral hops, and some citrus"
"D - I could do a few before getting bored. It's a good beer, I just think it's more of a pale than an india. I would've rated it higher had it been in that category, but as an IPA, it doesn't hold up. I'd take another one anytime, and overall I'd say it's worth a try."
"Nicely carbonated, this could be a much better beer, I feel, if they went back to the drawing board, minimized the diacetyl, and brought out more of the fruit in the hops, which blends nicely with the toasted malts."
"I found this at Fred Meyer. I've been getting some bad beer tastes lately. I nearly gave up on beer after a can of Sapporo. So I found this at the store, so I said, Well, let's try it. I am pleased. A nice bitter taste without the strong pine or orange peel taste I/ve been finding lately. It leaves a nice aftertaste that makes me want to down another. Enjoy."
"I'm not sure why so little love for this 7% IPA. Well crafted, balanced and flavorful, high side of the ABV. I feel for the brewers: to get more complexity from the hop bill, you need more hop strains, which are very difficult to get certified organic in enough quantity and consistency to have an unchanging recipe. Given the constraints of the industry, I give two thumbs up to Eel River for this effort, and as more growers continue to go organic (a near-certainty given recent legislative changes regarding hops and organic regulations), look for them to brew some damn good beers."
"Overall, a very interesting beer in for what it says it is. To me it is in between an english ipa and a double ipa, with some esb in it. It hides the 7%alc. quite nicely as well. But this bottle i wish i would have had a stronger distinct hop flavor (the last bottle i had certainly did...is this an incosistancy on me or the beer??)"
"Thanks to jcwatttsrugger for bringing back from his trip West."
"Smooth mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. I am definately not going to buy this again."
"O.K. this might not be what one expects in an IPA but do all have to be hop bombs? Some of my favorites are Acme from North Coast and Full Sail's versions. These are not over the toppers but are very good and drinkable. This one fell in to that vein. Orange amber had a thin head that left delicate rings of lacing. Aroma was surely not IPA like, not much evidence of any hoppy aroma at all. Not bad, but not good. Taste was better than the aroma, some hop but malt dominated for sure. I personally found it very refreshing though admittedly I probably would not buy it again. There just are a lot better IPA's out there, plenty of them. I bought it because I had visited their brew pub a few years back and thought it pretty good."
"With the exception of Certified Organic Porter, which I didn't love, I haven't had a beer from these guys that has even risen to the level of average. In the end, it doesn't really matter where they're located. However, in the craft brew paradise that is California, I'm surprised that Eel River sells any beer at all."
"Notes: A complete mess. This is one of those brews where I wonder how its released to the public."
"Drinkability: Nice and flavorful but a little odd for an American IPA; just OK"
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is an above average American IPA. Nothing special, but worth a try."
"Middle of the road."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice copper/amber color with a thick head. The aroma is of grassy hops. The taste is bitter upfront then a sweet maltiness followed by a hop bitter bite. Though there are flavors of hop bitter and malty sweet they aren't balanced (hard to explain). The body is sticky and coats your mouth. This is an IPA that you would enjoy a couple of at one sitting. The alcohol is well hidden. Not bad overall and it's certified organic."
"The smell has strong malt flavor along with a good punch of hops. The taste matches that. The mix of hops is pretty good. Malts are strong but the flavor isn't as good as the hop flavors. The mouthfeel is full."
"I'm not beer expert but I've tried just about every IPA on the West coast. This rates in the lower half. What's so different about orgainic???"
"This beer is a slight bit lighter than a typical IPA. The head is about a finger and a half and there is ample lacing. The smell is very hoppy and sweet. The taste is hops of course and a sweet aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and the drinkability is good. Above average for an IPA."
"do not think I will buy again, but I would try other organic beers, still trying to find that great northern Californian IPA."
"Amber copper in color. Nice fluffy head and lot's of lace. Smells pretty malty for an IPA. Almost like an amber ale. Taste is balanced but a little off. Almost like the sweetness and bitterness are competing instead of meshing. Mouthfeel is good. Smooth and creamy. Not a great IPA but a decent sessionable beer none the less."
"Bronze body topped by a small white head. Lots of lacing. Nose is faint grass with just a touch of pine. As for taste, I'm treated to pine and grapefruit mingled. This is overshadowed by a lemony grassiness. Caramel darts about here and there. Mouth is nciely thick. I think this is a very nice IPA, one I would happily buy often."
"Pours nice and clear, pale amber color with an ecru-colored, thick, rocky head. Smells cool and smooth, a little sweet and caramely, hops are prominent but not in my face. Tastes almost... roasty? Crisp malt profile is supported by a significant bitter backbone, but the hop taste is definitely less than overwhelming. I'm wondering if this is an old bottle, but it's not stamped with any bottling or expiration date. As I take several more sips, I realize that the most significant aspect of the hops is the grassy flavor -- but unfortunately it's not accompanied by the nice pine & citrus overtones that you usually get from dry hopping. Overall not especially good and I certainly wouldn't call it very drinkable."
"It has a good full mouth-feel, and has adaquate hop bitterness. Great aftertaste. I think one of it's big claim/goal is it's certified organic wholeness. [and i'm ALL for that] A great session beer, and one to have on hand in the refrigerator."
"Overall: An IPA that misses the mark in too many places."
"has a nice hop finish with all the trimmings. Probably one of the stronger beers from them as the flavours where melded and prominent. worth a try if you can find this beer ( i got it from hawaii)."
"A middling to light body - surprising considering the high alcohol content (7%) and very drinkable at that. Nice session brew if a bit strong. Lightly, oily mouthfeel and a very enjoyable brew. I'll be seeking out other Eel River brews."
"Pours a clear copper with a tight 1/2 finger white head,well really subdued aromas for an IPA the toasted grain aromas are stronger than any hop profile, caramel sweetness shows up as well only a very light herbalness shows up.A sharp,prickely mouthfeel really keeps the drinkability low not to mention the flavors are nothing to write home about.Caramelly sweet with more of leafy hop profile finishing rough and abrupt.No complexities to this beer just a rough edged lightly hopped IPA,man I have 5 more to drink I'll be giving these out to friends although that would be mean."
"12 ounce bottle."
"Straw yellow color, a little bit hazy and with the slightest red tint. Sweet and floral nose, some bananas, pine and caramel. Pretty sweet for an IPA and the malts are rather light and one dimensional. Some hop dry finish, but the aftertaste is sour. A little but fuzzy and warm, palatable but not refreshing."
"So what's up with this beer? The look is decent, hazy dark golden, with a nice looking creamy frothy head. Aroma is a non-descript hoppy, slightly sweet, brown-sugar malt, which is odd for an IPA.. Flavor is hoppy, but with an odd middle and aftertaste that I can't describe. Dark roasty malts are much more pronounced that I expect. Mouthfeel is moderate but I just can't get excited about drinking this beer. I can't say it's bad, but it just doesn't interest me."
"Drinkability: Kind of like a brain dissection...interesting but I'm glad it's over."
" I guess i would say drink this if you are in the humboldt area otherwise skip it. When i drank this up thier it seemed right, but out of the area it doesn't seem to be that great. I don't know if that makes anysense. I'm kinda of getting tired of breweries slapping the words IPA on any old beer with extra malt and hops. This is really more of an amber."
"Drinkability- Odd tasting brew that is interesting, but not really to the style of an american IPA."
"Pours a lightly hazy ruby color, it is topped by a frothy four finger thick tan head. The aroma is lightly spritzy with notes of lemon, orange, and muted biscuit-like malt notes. The taste is sweet and malty with notes of caramel, which accentuates the fruity hop notes of orange and tangerine. This beer finishes with a fair bitterness, at least for an IPA, that dries my mouth out enough that you want to take another sip. The finish is lightly astringent as well. This beer is fairly light on the palate, and goes down quite smoothly. There is a bit of toasted malt that peeks through this hop dominated brew. This beer is pretty good, and the fact that it is organic is sort of cool."
"Overall drinkability: well, I'd drink it all if I bought a six pack, but thankfully, I didn't. I'm finishing the bottle, but mainly because I don't believe in wasting even somewhat decent beer. (Unlike BMC, which I'd wash my driveway with given sufficient quantity.) Ummm, a very ho-hum beer. Disappointing, too, since I think organic beers can be made to taste great. This was a half-hearted attempt at an IPA, first off, and also a lackluster offering in the organic market, which, sadly, isn't that broad to compete in."
"The beer departs the 12-ounce brown bottle a clear deep copper color with a mountainous creamy light tan head that lingers long on top the body with the residual lace a thick blanket to cover the glass. Nose has a sweet hop aroma, crisp and fresh, start is sweet with a good grain profile, top is middling in feel. Finish is prickly in its acidity and the hops dynamic in their spiciness, dry long lasting aftertaste, a fine drinking IPA, that satisfy your need for hops."
"Tap@Eel River. Pretty good for an organic beer. Lychee/pine bitterness, texture is a bit milky or something, which was a bit odd. (BTW, i am asuming this is the 'Certified organic' IPA that i'm reviewing this under). A pretty pleasant IPA, nothing fancy, just failr tasty/easy going."
"color shows up as a dark gold, reminds me of darkened apricots.. head is tight and thick and lasts... with traces hugging the glass and skirting the top.. the smell is very fruity, almost apricots (hmm, wonder if that is where the color came from) with a touch of bitterness and acidity. The first sip really filled the entire mouth with flavors that range from slightly bitter to fruity to end in musky. A decent feel of alcohol that doesnt interupt the taste."
"Overall, a pretty nice IPA. Well crafted and possessing a tasty balance between malt and hops. Worth trying out."
"Hey, I enjoy this beer! So good marks it gets."
"Hops lovers rejoice. This one's for you. A bit too hoppy for me."
"Drinkability  This is not a bad beer by any means, but it is off-style enough to classify as being mislabeled."
"A very pleasing and, in my book anyway, high-ranking -- and underrated -- west coast IPA."
"a little dark for an IPA. the smell is a little sour but yet aromatic. its a little odd. the taste isn't very bitter at all, in fact its a little too malty and sweet. not characteristic of an ipa. more like an esb in taste color and flavor. overall, about middle ground for organic brews. a little disappointing."
"Hazy, almost sandy look to the beer, which is amber in color. No head. No discernible hop aroma, and a slightly stale malt smell. The taste is similar. Quite sweet, but with somewhat dry, oxidized taste. Very slight bitterness that doesn't meet my expectations of an IPA. Tasted a bit like an over-aged bitter."
"A very very drinkable IPA..i thoughroughly enjoyed this and its Organic ..wonders never cease."
