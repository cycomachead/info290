"Really enjoyed the feel and balance of this. Lot of bitterness with a dryish bubbly feel and sweet wet malty finish."

"Overall a good beer. Not the best IPA I've ever had, but a good six pack if you're looking for something good to drink while grilling, or to share with some friends."
""
""
"Overall: Pretty good, pretty thick for summer drinking though."

"O: I literally have NO idea what to think of this brew. I definitely don't think it's in the same league as some of Schlafly's other IPAs (namely, their wonderful TIPA), but after sipping it for a while, it grows on me slightly. Slightly. Quash some of the acidic qualities, and this would become a genuinely good English IPA. Try it if you can get a single, I guess."

"This English Style IPA has a cloudy copper hue that is capped by a soapy thin head. The nose is very subtle in bitterness with some herbal notes but it has more barley and bran grain notes. The flavor is very barleyesque, heavy on dry grain malt, bran flakes and a bitter herb tone. The feel is very dry, crisp, and a bit heavy on carbonation. I understand the style and like heavy malts but this seemed to rely heavily on a dry bran like flavor that just wasn't my favorite."
""
"As the finish comes quick, a crisp and refreshing taste of southern sweet tea, laced with fresh-pulled fruity tobacco gives final impressions along with the classic broad, grassy and woodish bitterness from noble English hops."
""
"Poured an orange-tinted amber with a clinging white head. There is significant detritus floating in this and settling to the bottom, a real negative. There is almost no aroma or flavor even as it warms. There is a nice weight to the body. Not even remotely like an English IPA. I don't know what happened to make this bottle that bad."
""
""
""
""
"O: Decent enough but when they put out stuff like their Tasmanian IPA, it is hard to compete."
""
""
""
"Rated to style, this beer delivers just as advertised. Woody, lemony, not too bitter and not too sweet. A big English bitter that will keep you sipping while trying to put a thumb on complex flavors."

"O: A really solid, authentic example of the style. I think this ale serves as an excellent counterpoint to Schlafly's American and Tasmanian IPAs. I could also see this beer being used to illustrate the differences between English and American takes on the style."
""
"O: Tasty, just a bit sweet for my palate. If that were toned down & the hop bill increased slightly I think it would accent the citrus/earthy notes even better... or perhaps it's a bit late past its bottling date"

"Overall, a reallly good beer from Schlafly and one of the better American made English IPA's I have had. A great style that is not brewed enough."
""
"O: I wasn't sure what to make of this at first as it is an unfamiliar style to me, and distinct from Belgian and American IPAs I've had - it had a textural and pastoral flavor and aroma that I warmed to quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall â€“ A rather enjoyable brew overall with a good dose of herbal, earthy, and lemongrass hop flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: The English hops dominate: they are spicy and bitter, with a touch of lemon. Mildly bitter and earthy aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of citrus hops, hops, sweet malt, hint of yeast, hint of alcohol, hint of caramel malt, and a hint of pine. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of a hint of grass, sweet malt, hops, citrus, hint of yeast, slight alcohol, hint of smoke, and hint of floral notes. Overall, complex body and aroma, smooth, and well blended."
"O: I would rate this a little lower, but I've had it on tap before and it was much better. Would much rather drink Schlafly's TIPA or AIPA."

"This really stands out as an exceptional beer from this brewery for me. It tastes more like an English hopped American IPA for me, as it has that light body of a West Coast style IPA. The hops used are extremely interesting with this strong pop of lemon and light citrus instead of grapefruit, but then the drying being later of herbs and grapefruit."
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with medium-low levels of carbonation that lead to a fairly thick, chewy mouthfeel that has some foamy smoothness to it as well. Closes dry, with substantial stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-For and English IPA, exactly what you'd expect; caramel and malt to begin with grass mild hops notes in the finish."
""
""
""

"Thanks to Kirk for the beer!"

"they are calling this one xipa now, as part of that new ipa series. this is a standard English ipa, quite heavy, and not as good as some of their other ipa work at schlafly. this pours a rich looking bronze color, with a creamy and robust white head. aromas of tired English caramel malt and bittering hops in equal proportion and a flavor that agrees. more sweetness from the grain than I need in an ipa, and the hops come across a little astringent. the beer is filling as a result, even though the texture is soft and delicate, and the carbonation is appropriately light, true to style. I think a cask pour would do wonders for this, but as it stands its sort of unimpressive, a beer ive had before and forgotten or something, just not distinct on its own. too bog to pair well with a meal, its sort of an oddball in the taproom lineup."
""
""
""
""
""
"Body is nice and crisp but also smooth and velvety. Overall, I've had this once before and enjoyed it very much. I don't know why I waited years to finally buy it in bottles and finally try and review it. This brew is worth it and Schlafly continues to do good by St. Louis beer geeks."

"Poured into a snifter from the bottle, the beer was a copper color with a white head. A slight lacing was apparent. The aroma was a faint grapefruit aroma, leaning more toward earthy notes. The initial taste was a sour, unrippened grapefruit. Big hops were present, but the hops were more tongue bruising than tasty. In some ways, the hops were almost medicine-like. Did somebody put Nyquil in my IPA? There was no real sense of sweetness or citrus as part of the hops, making the taste one-sided. On close observation, one might detect the malts and a certain biscuity quality that allow the taste to linger. In the aftertaste, the acidity of the hops becomes more harsh. While this has the texture of an IPA, it hardly has any of the taste characteristics."
""
""
"I really prefer American IPA and don't care much for their English counterpart, but this was pretty appropriate for the style. Not sure what the IBU count was, but it's up there, though it's still very drinkable."
""
"I've been impressed by the Schlafly brews I've tried in the past so I picked up this sixer for IPA day. It looks nice enough on the pour, a nice deep amber color with a good head that dissipated over the first few minutes of drinking. Smell was off on this beer for an IPA. It reminded more of macro domestic beers than any IPA I've ever smelled. It had a stronger malt character than I would expect from an IPA. The taste was off too. Strong malt and baked bread. Boozy with a not enjoyable bitterness to it. Overall, I can't say this will be a beer I purchase again."
""
""
"A good English IPA, not really where I lean to in the IPA world. Neat to try something out of my region."
"The alcohol is here but not noticeable to the taste. This reminded me of a strong English Bitter with just a bit more hops and kick to it. Fans of that style or English IPA's will enjoy this take by Schlafly. It warmed me up nicely without being too overpowering and served as a welcome refresher from domestic versions that are seemingly involved in the hop ""arms race""."
"As I just recently found myself enjoying IPA's, I cannot offer a extensive review of this beer. (I up to now have been devoted to Stouts and Porters) I can however say if one is fond of the Schlafly brand and IPA's rest assure they will find this beer to decent!"
""

"pretty good ENGLISH ipa... if you were expecting a traditional american ipa, you might be disappointed. i happened to think it was more of an esb than an english ipa, but the color is too light for that style i believe. anywho, this is a pretty good demonstration of the style. slightly bitter, slightly sweet, slightly burnt characters. overall a bit average tasting for me, but the style leaves a lot to be desired in general."
"O: A nice EIPA, which would be an original style IPA as the English invented the IPA. Ok, so there is ONE good thing that came from war. Alcohol is nicely masked for 7.2%. Flavors are in line with what I would think the original IPA's were. English pales tend to have a bigger malt base, but the IPA was hopped up for preservation puropses during transport. Negative points for the heavy amount of sediment present. I would have this beer again."
"D: This was more like a strong Heineken than a good IPA. I wasn't a fan of the scent or taste. The body was ok, and the finish was ok. Drinkable, but not very enjoyable. Not recommended."
"12 ounce bottle, bottled on 3/20/2012. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a lot of lacing left on the glass. The brew smells like herbal hops, bready malt, and some caramel. It tastes like herbal and citrusy (grapefruit) hops, along with some apricots, caramel and bready malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and smooth with moderate carbonation. I think this is a good overall brew, I'd buy a 6 pack of this the next time I come across it. It's a nice English IPA that I enjoyed. I either picked this up at Party Town or Liquor Barn, I can't remember which place for sure."
"M/O - Medium body with good carbonation. Neutral on the palate but maybe leaves it a touch dry. Finishes semi-sweet and the aftertaste doesn't linger. It's an okay beer and it almost tastes like it is past freshness which is odd since it's only 2 months past bottling date. Not bad for the style but there are better options out there IMO."
"This IPA that focuses on earthy and herbal tones with a slightly sweet and bitter finish hangs in the ""solidly good"" category of IPA's, but unlikely to ever be called ""great""."
"Pours a crystal clear golden yellow with a medium white lasting head, some lacing. Aroma and taste of floral citrus hops, biscuit malt, yeast and some fruity citrus and grapefruit notes. A medium bodied palate with good carbonation. Finishes with a floral citrus hops, biscuit malt, yeast and some light citrus fruity flavor. Overall a good ipa for the style."
""
"Taste is thick and sticky on the palate, notably with the pine resiny hops character. Finishes with a malty sweet spiciness. Smooth and easy to drink, and a pleasing IPA!"
""
""
"Pours copper-orange in color with a bubbly off-white head that holds good retention and leaves some lacing mainly at the top of the glass. The downside to the appearance is that there is a ton of yeast particulate suspended in the body of the ale. A more careful pour would hopefully have left it in the bottom of the bottle. Unappealing to me, but I know it doesn't bother some. Aroma is sweet, fruity, floral hops, toasted grain, and caramel malt. Tastes are similar to the aroma with some pine, apricot, and mango to boot; maybe a bit more bready. Mouth-feel is thin-to-medium, moderate carbonation, and finishes with some bitterness, but is very well balanced. Overall, it's a good take on the style, but nothing I'd search out again."
"Overall, fairly disappointing. Not very hop forward. Alcohol wa a bit obtrusive. I liked it a lot better from a bottle a year or two ago."
""
""
"O: Very good IPA. Seems to be very in line with the English IPA style, the first of this ilk I've tried. Nice work, Schlafly."
""
""
""
"O: I've alway's considered Schlafly a dark horse surprise brewery, and after this brew, I still do...."
""
"D: from what i understand, english IPA's should have a more prominent malt component, and this brew does not. however, the hop character is rather pleasant and this is a pretty drinkable brew."
"Overall, still wins for me, probably one of my favorite English IPAs even still."
"O- Some what refreshing, but I'm not overly excited about this one."

"aroma was a fine mixture of light piney hops, hints of fresh grass and a touch of tea leaves as it warms. this carries over very well into the flavor as each sip starts with a nice bite of hops which quickly mellow into a fresh meadow like flavor with light earthy tones, grasses, light grains and a smooth, light and dry finish"
"D - as long as you're not looking for an alpha hop bomb, any fan of pale ales and English ales would probably find something to enjoy in this one. I can imagine that being advertised as a true IPA might hurt its image for some, but if it was simply marketed as a regular pale ale, I think the story would be different. worth a drink"
"Overall - just an ok flavored IPA. Nothing worthy to seek out again."
"Overall: Not a huge fan of this one. There was an odd sweetness in the flavor that I didn't love. The alcohol is well hidden. Still really like this brewery."
"Mouthfeel/overall: Somewhere between a medium and a light body with crisp carbonation."
"Bright orange color with white foam. Lots of sediment in bottom of glass. Slightly sweet citrus aroma. Malty with a citrusy hop finish. Very creamy mouthfeel. Subdued hop taste for an ipa. Deceptively high alcohol content. This is very good with a meal of cold cuts, cheese, and crackers."
"O: Goes down easily, tasty, somewhat filling, good kick, decent representation of style. This was a bit heavy on the alcohol, although decently done, it's a one and done for me."
"Schlafly's export IPA is solid: certainly the best shlafley product I've tried. Bright, bold and bitter, the IPA is dry and finished slow as the hops do their thing: the flavor unwound slowly and brought it all together. Nicely balanced."
"O- I thought this beer was good but could have been better coming from this brewery. With this being an English IPA I still expected the hops to come out a little more than what they did. It wasn't bad at all just a little above lackluster. The ABV was well hidden enough that it crept only around in the ending which I liked."
"Overall: Meh. I could take it or leave it. If someone offered it to me, I'd drink it, but I likely won't be buying it again. Schlafly definitely has better offerings out there, so they're still definitely cool with me. This just isn't one of their hits."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel. A little hot. Not a bad beer, but i'd expect a little more flavor from an 8% beer."
"QUITE GOOD, GIVE IT A GO!"
"O: This is my first English IPA and it is quite a different taste than the American IPA's I am used to. The full bodied caramel malt backbone carries the hops well into the finish. The hop bitterness is not front and center initially. Smooth alcohol character with minimal alcohol warming. I think they did a great job controlling the hot fusel alcohols during fermentation. Overall a great beer but I wish it was filtered bright..."
"O - Great EPA. Could be a part of introduction of people to IPA and EPA. Great session beer, but pricing is a little steep for a session ale."
"Bottle to frosty pint. The beer would have been average in appearance, but I was disappointed to see particles of sediment in it. Smell was pretty plain; hops were present. Taste was alright, but not everything I'd hoped it would be. The hops are there, but they're balanced in typical English fashion. Mouthfeel is slightly above average. Overall, it's an okay beer that I might drink again, but I won't be buying."
"A nicely drinkable English IPA. Definitely worthy of a sampling."
"Medium body, with a slightly lower feel in carbonation. Not much alcohol felt here, making it pretty drinkable. A nice beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter. English IPA's are always interesting. Color is enticing golden yellow with a slightly off white one finger head. Pale malts lead the charge on the nose with a sweet aroma. Some bitter hops follow with a slight grassy, piney flair. Taste is sweet and malty. Hops are noticeable on the finish with some pine flavor. Smooth feel with some alcohol warming, along with a slight hop oiliness. Overall a very tasty India Pale Ale. Definitely a good example of the style from Schlafly."
"Overall it's pretty average, but I'll happily drink this one again. Schlafly's usually quite good and this one is decent, but it isn't one of their better creations."
"O: Good stuff, goes down easy and no problem drinking a few with out even trying. A good English IPA that is laid back and not an in-your-face style."
"O: Pretty drinkable as it well balanced between hops and malt. Also, the 8%ABV is hardly noticable. This is a nice beer that I might buy another single of, but can't see myself buying an entire 6 pack."
"As far as I'm concerned, it just does not get any better than a fresh IPA on a warm spring day and this beer delivers. I was really excited to try an IPA styled after the original English versions. I was not disappointed. A must try for any hop head. Sure to gain a lot of fans in the St. Louis area."
"O - Hm... It's really hard to judge this beer. It's certainly worth a try. Schlafly definitely brewed it well, but I can't say I've had anything quite like it before. Maybe it will grow on me in the future, as the second one certainly seemed more inviting than the first. Either way, it was a good way to end the night."
"These guys have made some far better beers and even better IPAs. I like this one though. It is bold and completely interesting, but far short of being exceptional."
"Above average carbonation. Thanks for the opportunity."
"This brew is just a little too carbonated for the style, and not as smooth as most British brands. It's a good interpretation of the style with a high ABV content. I'd drink this one again for sure."
"Overall this is more like an English Pale Ale instead of IPA. Decent but nothing exciting."
"Well done."
"Overall, a nice beer. Obviously different than an American IPA, and has a nice, English IPA flavor."
"D - Very nice beer, but a tad on the sweet side."
"A nice-enough beer - hanging in the balance between a strict interpretation of the IPA brewed for shipment to the far reaches of the British Empire, and a bit of Americanized tweaking of the hops. Big malt body, true to style. Hopping was firm and well-balanced, but seemed a bit more APA in profile. Alcohol was well integrated in the flavor profile. For all the positive attributes of the beer, however, it just didn't ever seem to find the right note."
"Reviewed on 6/6/2010. Bottle. Pours a clear light orange with a thick white head. Aroma of sugars, sweet citrus. Flavor of light citrus, almost a juice-like character, caramel malt. Very sweet, definitely more English pale ale than IPA, and just a little too heavy for me."
"D: One of the better examples of the style I have had as of late. This is a style that for the most part just does not work if made in the USA. This one does."
"Powerful beer though (8.0%) - strongly than I usually enjoy. But I'll make an exception for this. The booze and hops collide nicely on your pallet. I don't think I could handle more than two or three of these, but I do think it's a very enjoyable batch (bottle is date-stamped 03 24 2010)."
"It pours an orange tinted gold that is just about the haziest beer I've ever poured. I don't think it's yeast, just precipitated proteins from the high alcohol and hopping. The aroma is like a very malt like a toasted cracker with floral and tropical fruit perfume that hit hard in the end. The beer is smoothly bitter with a lot of toasted malt flavor, yeasty fruitiness, and a honeyed sweetness. The mouthfeel is nice, but the alcohol presence makes does numb and dry the tongue a bit."
"I love IPAs and really enjoyed this one. This beer has a nice balance of crisp hoppiness without being too long and bitter on the finish. I paired this beer with a chicken stirfry and was happy with the complementing flavors. It matches pretty well with garlic and ginger."
"A: Off a hard pour there is a thin head which dropped quite quickly, medium gold in color, some visible sediment floating in the beer - 3.50, S: Initial pour results in a biscuity and doughy aroma, hops are quite reserved though they do provide a nice herbal and earthy quality, slightly on the side of chalky - 4.00, T: Quite a bit of toasted malts and a bit bready, medium hop bitterness, a good deal of earthiness and also a little grassy, as the beer warms I pick up a faint golden raisin like sweetness and possibly some honey at the tail end of the beer - 4.00, M: Medium mouth feel and quite smooth - 3.75, D: Very nice example of the style, very enjoyable and drinkable - 4.00"
"Drinks very easy, nails the EIPA style. Would love to try this fresher & or on cask for what I bet would be even more enjoyment. Well done Schafly!"
"Kind of a hard beer to pinpoint. Light golden pour with a little head, smell was a light bready smell. It has a hoppy dry taste to it that finishes sweet and dry, a bit bitter. I found this interesting and glad i had it, it's just not the most drinkable because of the flavor, and being 8%, it needs to taste a little smoother to put down a few."
"D: Drinking this beer is a breeze and any presence of alcohol in the smell and taste is very well hidden."
"Nice interpretation (not sure where A got the bubblegum...)."
"D - Actually pretty easy to get down, could do another but I didn't care enough for the taste."
"It is not a bad beer, but not one I find especially refreshing."
"Draintime."
"I could learn to love it as a one-off home-brew batch that pride forced me to finish off, and throw out the recipe, but I won't pay money for this."
"D: A pint at a time is plenty but a nice IPA (all be it an english IPA)"
"Mouthfeel is rich and crisp. Drinkability is good. No hint of alcohol, the 8% is transparent. You could drink this until the inevitable happens. Good one!!!"
"Excellent beer."
"Overall I am glad I took a chance with this beer. I think most of the lower scores, such as mine, are attributed to the English style IPA as most of us are used to the American style. It is something I can get used to and would buy this again especially at the price I got it for."
"D: I prefer IPAs made with different hops. I wonder if this was even dry hopped or not. I definately get the hops in the flavor but the aroma leaves a little something to be desired. This isn't a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, however, there is so much out there right now in the IPA catergory and this doesn't stand out."
"Surprisingly easy to drink for an 8% IPA. Well worth a try."
"Tastes like it smells. Wonderful balance, medium boldness, cake and cookie sweetness backed up with spicy and dry hops and a butter toffee explosion near the end."
"mouthfeel is slightly resiny and medium bodied.easily my favorite english ipa i have had thus far.the balance of this beer makes it an easy sipper."
"12 ouncer, ""Bottled with love on 05 06 2009"" on the bottom of the front label. Pours darker amber, burnt orange, the head is light tan, frothy, leaves a thick collar, and ample sheeting down low and strands of stick. Mild hop nose, with some dough in the rear. Full bodied and coating on the tongue. Nice depth of flavors, plenty of sweet and then a soft yet quite drying finish. Full bodied and nicely flavorful. Almost tastes like an old ale or a lite Barley wine. Which I suppose is a compliment and means that this is a flavorful and moderatly complex Brit style ale. Well done, enjoyable night capper for me."
"This was an interesting beer, quite strange combination of flavors that ended up being pretty tasty. Worth a try if you enjoy English style IPAs, if you only like American IPAs you most likely won't enjoy this."
"A hazy amber color with a quarter inch head, cream in color, forms on top, then gradually dissolving away. Surprising strong bready and malty fragrance at the front of each scent, which is soon, followed by a citrus and pine aroma. The taste starts with a hearty bread flavor, staying there for some time. Then it all blends to a grassy, citrus, and pine flavors that take over and lingers for several minutes. A medium bodied feel, staying consistent all the way through, never thinning out. A very solid IPA, with a strong malty heartiness and a strong hoppy flavor, along with the consistent feel make this a good choice anytime."
"Mouthfeel is a little too overcarbonated for my taste, but typically oily and lasting in the finish. Drinks fairly easy but more than a couple is definitely out of the question. Not a bad beer but underwhelming non the less."
"Easy enough to drink but probably something ill never reach for again with many options availble"
"Conclusion: From a brewery that does some amazing stuff this is fairly mediocre and probably one I won't be going back to often...I think I'll keep a couple in the cellar though and see if a bit of age mellows 'em out at all."
"A very nice little brew that seems very true to style... Hoppy but not overly so... Rather nice for a change..."
"Medium bodied, with lots of tiny, almost prickling bubbles on top of a creamy base. Drying effect in the finish, furthered perhaps by the considerable bitterness. Makes me want another sip to quench my thirst. Somewhat heavy, but at 8% and with a considerable malt backbone I'm not surprised, nor does this seem entirely inappropriate."
"Holy Cow. What's goin' on with this? Color's rosy amber. Consistency is lighter. Head's light and lacy. Flavor is whole other ballgame. Complex is a subtle term. Fruity. Herbaceous. Reminds me of a badass Cali Syrah, for all you wine freaks out there who are into beer. This guy is something to bend your brain around. Thanks to Rob for bringing this back from the mid-west to Boone! Schlafly is definitely on my radar now."
"I don't really have much else to say about this beer, aside from hoping I got a bad bottle, and my next one will surprise me and be all I hoped for."
"D: hopheads are going to look for something else after a snifter of this one. That said, this truly is a center-of-the-road IPA worth the time if you ever come across it. Not spectacular, but pleasant. I think pleasant is the word for this beer. Pleasant and enjoyable. Perfectly serviceable. Cheers!"
"I found it to be a little sneaky for an 8% ABV, it drank very easily, and I could have had a few more with no problem."
"The beer feels a little thick on the tongue. I've never had an IPA that had this little hop character."
"Very smooth as a result of its lighter body."
"D - Easy to drink and a decent English IPA."
"I was really looking forward to trying this one. It had a nice clear brown color and an ample head. I did not catch much of an aroma from this, but my allergies have been bad and that may have been a factor. I really liked the body on this. It was full and effervescent. Nice flavor, very earthy. There is distinct hop bitterness but not in a bold manner. Slight alcohol taste but quite drinkable. There was also a mild oiliness to the texture."
"I'd have to put this IPA on the same comparable plane as that of Sierra Nevada and Sam Adams. Perhaps this is what people want and I'm simply looking for something more power packed. I sort of expect it from an IPA, but perhaps what I desire is more a double IPA rather than a traditional. Still Goose Island has produces and IPA I consider better than the Schlafly offering."
"For an 8% Imperial IPA, it goes down very easily. The size is well disguised and someone unaware could end up sessioning this gal and getting loaded."
"Cloudy pale gold with big white head that laces down the mug nicely. Bold spicy bitter taste with sweet chewy malt balancing and alcohol on the finish. Goes down smooth with a full bodied taste. This is a heavyweight in the category. Very good but @ $11.99/six, not something I would run out to buy again."
"D: I'm enjoying this, I think I'd drink another if i had one on hand"
"My tasting of this beer probably suffered from the constant eye treatment I kept giving it. Really, the looks were spot on for the style, perfect. Like trying to talk to a beautiful woman, it was hard to keep focused. This brewery goes on my to visit list."
"D: Outstanding beer, first Ive had from this brewery and if I could get them in Jersey, they'd have me sold. I dont think it is the role model of an English IPA, but one tasty hoppy beer."
"Schlafly Export India Pale Ale pours a light golden orange with a long lasting, froathy white head. Intial smell comes off piney with aromas of bitter and hops. The taste is moderately hoppy with a lingering bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light, smooth, and sports a mellow carbonation. Overall drinkability is good for the most part; its light, smooth, and easy to drink. I dislike the lingering bitterness, but that fades as beer gets to the bottom. A decent pick if I was looking for a lightly hopped beer, but ultimately not a go to choice for fulfilling a hop craving."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a golden yellow color with nice sticky lacing that clings to the glass. The aroma is sweet tangerines, a bit of pine, and just a hint of malt. The taste reminds me a water downed orange juice with just a hint boozy goodness in the finish. The mouthfeel is thin and the bitterness doesn't linger the way most IPA's do. Its drinkability is good but I think that they could have amped up the body as they took the ABV to 8%."
"Taste has some earthy hop bitterness, lots of caramel malt keeps everything in balance. Clean flavors, crisp and dry finish. Good level of carbonation, smooth, nice body. High (8%) alcohol is hidden, very drinkable. This would be a for-sure-go-to beer if it were available to me locally."
"Drinkability: I wouldn't mind if the ABV were toned down a notch, but this is a fine brew, nonetheless"
"Huge hops in the taste. Wasn't expecting that from the smell. Nice. Bittering and nice in the mouthfeel. This is a very good IPA. Decently priced and good. Good things are coming out of Schafly."
"My initial thought is how nice the beer looks. A slightly cloudy radiant orange sits below its hard-to-dissipate head. Little to no carbonation bubbles here. The scent is full of oaky, malty, earthy elements. This beer actually reminds me of the smell of a chardonnay. Whoa on the initial hops flavor! I thought it was supposed to mimic an english IPA! That one really hits hard, right away. Nice strong malt flavor as well. Not dry at all. For an IPA, this has a pretty substantial malty flavor. Great texture on the tongue as well. Slightly heavy, but really smooth and frothy. Absolutely the kind of beer you want to pack your fridge or cooler full of."
"D: Pretty damned good beer. The creaminess is quite impressive and really adds to the appeal of this brew. Very nice and no hint of that 8% ABV. Pick em up and slam em down."
"Overall it's a good tasting IPA that is quite drinkable."
"Mouthfeel was prickly at first but ended smooth. Medium bodied."
"Pours a nice golden yellow with a beautiful head. Smells of pine and grapefruit, common of its style, as well as sweet bread and a touch of malts. Starts off with a touch of sweet malt, which is followed by a grapefruit, hoppy taste and a tad bit of bitterness. This is a great IPA. It is not as over the top as many can be and the bitterness that is usually associated with IPA's is not overly present. Too bad this is only seasonal for Schlafly because it has become one of my favorite offerings by them."
"Another excellent Schlafly ale. I'm really starting to trust these folks to turn out high quality potables."
"Poured out of bottle into a New Belgum snifter type glass. Didn't pour too aggressive, pours a nice copper color, got about 1 finger of head which lingered around for most of the beer, leaving a bit of lacing behind with each sip. I smelled pine needles and a bit of hop initially, but I should have let it warm a bit before pouring. It was bitter tasting at first, with a touch of caramel, but it opened up quite a bit as it as the drink went on. I could taste the hop and a touch of citrus. It seemed to get smoother as it warmed in the glass. I was surprised at how smooth it went down from beginning to end at %8 ABV. This could be a dangerous beer for me."
"Pours a bright, slightly hazy golden orange with a big fluffy off-white head that lingers for a while leaving some impressive lacing. Smell is big on citrus and floral hops up front with oranges, lemons and grapefruit with a mild bready malt aroma in the background. Taste is also dominated by the big citrus hops with mainly grapefruit in the taste, definitely bitter and hoppy in very nice way. The malt background balances everything nicely. The mouthfeel is nice and prickly with hop oil with strong carbonation to tingle the tongue. This a very good beer and certainly not what I expected when I saw English IPA on the bottle."
"Nice english style IPA,very quaffable for such a high alcohol ale."
"D- Not a west-coast hop bomb but it is an English IPA. It really gets better just above the temperature of the refridgerator when the real flavor and aroma can show themselves. At 8% abv with how delicious this is seems like a dangerous combination. I recommend anyone in the midwest(or elsewhere if you can find it) to check this brew out."
"Medium bodied and smooth. Goes down real easy and uber-refreshing. I don't believe this is 8%, as it drinks as easily as a bitter. A session beer that you would have to watch yourself with. Highly recommended."
"Schlafly Export IPA is one of the Schlafly Spring/Summer seasonal beers. I poured it from the bottle into a standard pint glass after allowing it to warm to 55Â°. It developed 3-4 fingers of white frothy head with lots of retention and a fruity nose. The color is a dark honey. This beer is bitter but with a nice balance of malt. It is smooth in the mouth with some carbonation felt on the tongue. The bitterness is pleasant and lasts through the finish, but doesn't really linger after that. For an 8% ABV beer, the alcohol is not really noticeable, just a bit of warmth at the finish. The beer is tasty and well balanced. I wish this wasn't a seasonal beer because I could drink it year round."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. Alcohol is pushing the high side but flavors are good. I could handle another."
"thanks Ric"
"Thanks to beertracker for this prize from the National IPA Championship!"
"big ups to Goliath who sent me two more of these to enjoy."
"This beer is a clear yellow/golden color with a thick creamy head. The lacing is persistent. The aroma is initially strong of fresh hop - very inviting. It fades to some fruit and floral notes, but the hops remain. The taste is bitter and fresh with hops. The mouthfeel is medium and very well suited. This is an impressive IPA - bold flavors, but not overpowering and well balanced."
"One of Schlafly's better beers, not a bad way to celebrate my one year anniversary with BA."
"Hard to describe a beer that's so wonderfully balanced, but believe me, this is something special. Up there with the Coffee Stout as my favorite Schlafly beer."
"Drinkability- Quality English IPA here. In fact, I can't really think of any others except for maybe one or two that I have enjoyed more. Thanks again Ethan for all the wonderful brews you let me try!"
"Fuzzy orange in color. Quite the hop aroma going on-says fresh cut grass. Great malty flavor with a huge backdrop of hops. Very well balanced between sweet and bitter. Good mouthfeel. Very good beer and very, very drinkable. An easy going down 8% its almost scary. Seems more like a US version but who cares. Great beer."
"Pours a nice, semi-cloudy golden amber, with a tenacious white head. Evocative hop aroma featuring some earthy English style notes and some elements, such as the tropical fruits, that seem derived from American hops. Juicy malts come up first on the palate. They are joined by juicy fruits of multiple sources: citrus, tropical, stone fruits. Bitterness grows at the mid-palate but crescendoes quickly, leading to a smooth, tea-bitterness-and-nutty-malts finish. That finish is long and active. Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect -- rounded, juicy, and brisk, but not over the top in any way. This is a wonderful beer -- an IPA that is drinkable and has plenty of hop character in spite of not being a hop-bomb."
"Drinkability: Another decent brew from Schlafly."
"D: Straightforward, quite easy to drink. Flavorful-filled, nice to look at; this beer has many pluses and few negatives. I'd definitely have it again...another one courtesy of jpm30..."
"Pours a light amber color with a decent slightly off-white head that sticks around. The nose is all about herbal hops and a sweet malt accent underneath. Smells of fresh, juicy hops. The palate is really quite nice - a fine balance between a solid malty backbone and alive with hop flavors. This is a well-crafted beer. Finishes quite lively and dry. Ample carbonation. Mouth feel is medium-light and comes across as light enough on the palate. A very nice beer - maltier than an American style IPA, yet not as malty as a typical English style. A very good, happy medium here. Schlafly's is one of my favorite craft brewers. Being the only one in my region of the country, I could be biased however."
"Six-pack was gone pretty fast...an easy drinker to be sure."
"Quite tasty. I would certainly drink again."
"Overall, a good IPA, but perhaps more citrus hoppy than the traditional English style should be. Not quite as good as Goose Island or Dogfish Head."
"D - This is a pretty good IPA. It seemed fairly true to the English style. It wasn't overy powerful in terms of hops."
"Bottled on April 30, 2007. Received this bottle from bort11. Served slightly chilled in a pint glass, from a twelve ounce bottle. Poured a light golden copper color that was somewhat hazy. About two fingers of thick, tight bubbly head formed in the glass. Retention was decent and left some thick sticky lace behind. Tons of small bubbles of carbonation were noticed, quickly rising up from the bottom of the glass. Smell: Strong aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, a nice bready yeast, and nice thick malt. Maybe a little bit peppery and spicy in the nose. I really enjoyed the nose more than the flavors but not too bad. Sweet malts, semi bitter hops, some citrus noted. A strong, almost overpowering grainy flavor in the finish. Pretty decent balance to this one. Mouthfeel had a nice medium bodied feel to it that was sticky and bitter. Drinkability was pretty good."
"High drinkability except for the fact you can only get this near or in St. Louis."
"This is a nice IPA. Balance is dead on. Chewy toffee and caramel induced malt with a toasty mid palate, lead into the ripe, resiny, effervescent hop flavors. Layred hop flavors start and finish very floral, not overly bitter, orange peel and lemon, with dried apricots. Pine forest aspects with that resiny spectrum. A very find example of the style. Long finish, easy drinking."
"Mouthfeel is light/medium body and very clean. Very refreshing and quaff-able, even though the higher ABV puts it out of the ""session"" category. Schlafly is shining"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Bottled on 4/30/07. This IPA poured a hazy copper orange color with a thick, bubbly beige head that faded quickly. Some excellent lacing was left behind. The aroma is fairly laid back for an IPA with this high of an alcohol content. Some citrus hop notes are present along with a bit of caramel. The flavor is lead by sweet malts, then some light hop bitterness. A touch of alcohol is noticable, but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is slightly resiny with a good dose of carbonation. Somewhere between medium to full-bodied. This IPA is all about balance, but it doesnÂ’t do much to set itself apart from the crowd."
" Tons of woody and vineous hops in the aroma which donÂ’t diminish at all in the quaff. Massive amount of hoppy goodness in this one. Very crisp and dry, almost stinging in the body. No hint of a 8% undertow, this beer rates well as a sippinÂ’ summertime special. Glad I have a sixer, more will be consumed as the days grow longer"
"In my opinion, this is one of the finest beers to come from Schlafly. Sure, I'm partial to IPAs but this one can hold it's own. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a six pack to finish."
"On to the taste. First up on the palate is a rush of fresh resinous hops. There is a touch of pine along with some more of the grapefruit noted in the aroma, and some fresh pineapple. A strong malt backbone helps really balance this beer out in the finish with some nice sweetness. Mouthfeel is pretty full bodied and is very smooth and well carbonated. The 8% abv is very well hidden and this is an extremely drinkable brew. This is an awesome beer from Schlafly. I really wish they would brew this year round and make it a part of their regular rotation. The beer was bottle only ten days ago and I am on my second sixer already."
