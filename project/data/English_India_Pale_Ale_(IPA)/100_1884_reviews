"On cask at the brewery , nice body and feel"

"Was not impressed with this ipa. No info on can.. No date, abv, or ibu. I think I bought a old can. Info on the can helps."
"You know The Bros' Rankings are sometimes quite high on beers that don't overwhelm the denizens of BA. However, I think that they just nail a lot of them. They are not afraid to give high marks to stuff that is (in my experience) just plain good, without the hype. I'm in no way saying that all of BA is a bunch of hype helpers, but this is one case where it's like, wow, this is a really unique beer for many reasons and the Bros score is right in line with mine. Though, mine of course, is just an opinion and I will say that there are many , man, many more qualified raters than I. However, it's really all opinion in a sense. Blathering, but just loved this and like a very adept review  that is below mine, was blown away by the beer after I had seen such mediocre ratings. Sometimes you wonder how much thought is being out into the ratings. It's always like there is this regression to the mediocre mean...how many beers rank from 81-86...a huge majority I would believe. And many of us call this mediocre...well in this case you're missing out if you don't try it. Besides, it's got a dead horse on the bottle...what better to do than beat it, which is what I seem to be doing."
"I didn't expect that much, as this is not a particularly famous beer and the ""BA Score"" is rather low.  I was pleasently suprised by the strong malt and delicious hops of this English Style IPA.  Very clean profile, very different than most IPA's now a days.  Do yourself a favor and try it."

"Nice traditional ipa, bonus half point for the name!"
"Appreciate that they went for something different here but def not my style of IPA. All malt and no hops. Not a drain pour but the balance of the sixer may be giveaways."

"O: Why is it called 'Dead Horse IPA'? Because you can't beat a dead horse, rimshot. This is a brand that those who were around in the early days of craft beer will remember fondly. After a long hiatus the brand is looking to make a comeback, brewing and canning out of Wachusett. The liquid itself is tasting quite good. However, I worry about its potential to make an impact in the market again. The beer landscape has changed a lot, and it's so much more competitive now. McNeill's can't just rely on their old customer base to get by; they need to actively solicit new drinkers in a completely different and much younger demographic. Their name means nothing to these people, and without an active sales force and more aggressive marketing they will probably just end up as another hokey-looking can on the shelf collecting dust. It doesn't help that the market is preferring the more aggressive west coast style IPAs to the more English versions of the style these days. I really wonder what McNeills' current ambitions are."

"O: McNeill's Dead Horse IPA isn't a bad beer, it just is kind of average and seems like it hasn't been updated to keep up with modern changes in beers. Things like brightening the hops or adding a more poignant malt quality might go a long way to making this a more interesting and enjoyable brew."

"Cheers!"
"D: A bit rustic in hop character, look, and feel. Minimal caramelly, malty, richness for an English IPA. Sort of leaning a bit to an ESB or a big pale. Definitely English in character. I would like more umph from the hops and more richness to the malts. But, all said and done, This one is alright. Serve it on the warmer side though."

"DELICIOUS, MUST TRY!"
"Hazy Auburn pour, fluffy head that is quite resilient. Nose contains hops bread fruit and yeast. The flavor is a mix of fruit bread and hops, hops are minimal considering that it’s an ipa. Alcohol does make itself felt especially on the finish. Low carbonation makes this a smooth easy drink. It’s a pleasant brew but doesn’t stand out considering the great selection of ipas available, certainly worth drinking though. Handsome bottle btw…"
"This beer poured out as a straw yellow color with a very light haze to it. The head was a little thin on this one, kind of surprising I though for the amount of hops that was probably in it. The smell was hoppy and really gave off a nice inviting aroma. The taste had a nice hop character to it also. The mouthfeel was a bit in the watery or thin side I think... Could have been a bit thicker for me. Overall I liked the flavor of the beer a lot."
"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy caramel color ale with a nice thick foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of light bitter hops with light floral undertones with a rich caramel malt base. Taste is also a well balanced mix between some floral and lightly bitter hops with a rich caramel mal bill with just enough sweetness to balance the hops profile. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation. I understand this is not an IPA for hophead but the malt bill is quite incredible and I would love to have this more often."
"An excellent summer IPA when you want a tasty, hoppy, full-bodied beer without too much alcohol."
"O: With exception of the nose, an adequate ipa with moderate drinking results. Wouldn’t go out of my way to recommend, or buy again, but wouldn’t discourage for the english drinking ipa fan."
"Overall, a nicely drinkable mostly English IPA."
"Overall: I figured I try this one out since I have never had it before. The EIPA is pretty mild mannered compared to the AIPA I am accustomed to drinking. Maybe I was looking for more, but I was slightly amused by this beer. I would like to try this beer on draft someday to get a better feel for it. Maybe EIPA's are more mild and this is how they normally taste. I will have to try a few times to really understand this type of beer."
"D: A nice ale, chewy and hoppy without going overboard on either side. And another beer to check off in my Michael Jackson book."
"The beer pours a beautiful amber color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is average. It has a light pale and crystal malt scent. The hop aroma is faint at best. English noble hops peak through, but not as much as most traditional English IPAs. The taste is decent. It has a dry, bitter flavor that melds with a traditional pale and crystal malt character. It's not overly bitter and it finishes a tad thin. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average IPA. It's lacking depth and hop character. I won't search this one out again."
"D- not as good as the last mcneills brew I had. I could have another, but not craving it"
"This was a huge letdown after really enjoying the McNeill's oatmeal stout last spring. I will probably remain very wary of purchasing from them again..."
"Smooth and creamy feel, but just a tad bit too harsh and bitter for my liking. It was OK, but not something I'd seek out again."
"I had a sixteen ounce pour of this at the Amsterdam Ale House in Manhattan's upper west side. I was told by someone else that it tasted like an ESB, which made sense since it was an english style ipa. I liked it a lot. Like an English ipa, very dark in color and a little light on the hops. Very good flavor with a good malt character. I'll have this again."
"I did not know that Dead Horse IPA was an English IPA when I ordered, and only found now here on BA. I think that this beer could use a more complex and larger grain bill and hop profile, either to make it more like the english or American versions of an IPA. To me, it seems more like a standard Pale Ale."
"Drinkability: Very smooth. Did not intend to drink the 22oz, but it was too good to share..."
"Pours hazy orange with a medium head. The aroma is slight and steely. The flavor is malty and bready, with light caramel and some light floral hops. There is a strong metallic bite. A citrusy bitterness sneaks in late, with a sticky, thick mouthfeel."
"This is an interesting diversion for IPA fans seeking an alternative to the norm."
"Pours a hazy yellow-orange with a below average white head. Minor lacing. A bready, yeasty, buttery toasted malt starts off and some pine and citrus hops balance the beer decently. Nothing really stands out and even a little bland. Good balance, but lacking true flavor. Still a decent brew."
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink but it didn't seem interesting enough to make me want to have another."
"Hi folks, in NH for work and scored a bottle of Dead Horse Ale at a gas station quickie mart. My First review. I'm not impressed by cloudiness in an IPA. The bottle is marked best before last day of Feb, no year. It's June 2010. My take on this beer is very similar to the rest of the reviews. No excessive head, pours just fine. The aroma is a bit dusty to me and the flavor is dominated by a citrusy/belgian/spicy flavor that imo is not hops and detracts from the what I expect from an IPA. I can't (I don't think) taste cloudiness, but it looks nice and orange with a bit of lacing around the glass and the cloudiness is not right (IMO). If I was sitting in a pub in England and drinking this from a cask, maybe I'd think it was like an old time Ale, but it's way different from IPAs and bitters and best bitters and cask ales I've had in England. So, I'll drink it, but won't buy another and won't be requesting it in trade."
"D: Enjoyable, but nothing special here."
"A decent English IPA, nothing exceptional, but less than $4 for a bomber it's hard to beat that at price."
"This beer was muddy looking but had a nice bouquet and mouthfeel. It had a nice dry hoppiness at the finish with a breif maltiness to start. the drinkability was good so I could definately knock back quite a few of these! Overall an exellent beer. Apparently I need to be a bit more long winded with these reviews so I'll also say that having the name of the brewery etched on each glass was a nice touch. I think that makes 250 words."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid beer to drink for a long time."
"D: I could definitely have a whole bomber myself with no problem but i probably wouldnt want to"
"This is an interesting beer but the big Belgian presence doesn't seem to come together with everything else. The mustiness is really unique but no altogether pleasing. Pretty good."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light to medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Piney hop nose. Flavor is hops and tart citrus. Light lingering bitter finish. Similar to their DIPA but lighter bodied. Not as hoppy as some American IPAs. $2.99 for a 22oz bottle from Beverage Warehouse Winooski, VT."
"Overall a very solid IPA, I have been fairly impressed with everything that I have had come out of McNeil's so far I have to say."
"Liked it so much on tap, I wanted to see how it stood up in the bottle. 22oz. brown bomber served in a standard pint. Freshness dating not indicated on the bottle. Poured a hazy burnt orange with a rocky, three inch, off-white head - layers of bubbles formed the base while pock marks formed the cap. Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch layer. Thick, textured clumps of lacing were revealed as the brew was consumed. Nose is a little earthy & musty with a hint of spice. Taste consistent with nose - earthy and spicy with a peppery quality at the back; some floral hops character is detectable in the mix. Mouthfeel is light/medium, a little oily, with a carbonation level that approaches prickly. Fairly complex and interesting for the style - a little left of center, but definitely worth a try, although I have to say I enjoyed it on draft a little bit more (can't wait to try it on cask)."
"Hop oil and a buttery malt in front before getting whomped with a heavy woody hop and lemon pepper laden bitter in back. Almost like two beers in one."
"Reviewed on 06/05/2009. Bottle at PPRBSG09. Pours a cloudy orange. Aroma of tropical fruits, caramel malt, citrus. Flavor has a nice balance of the caramel malt and citrusy hops. Slight astringency and harshness in the palate, but overall pretty decent. I liked this one!"
"From the 1 pint. 6 fl. oz. bottle with a July-August notched off expiration date. Sampled on July 8, 2009. It pours a cloudy amber-orange tone with a frothy tan head that remains foamy and frothy through the sampling. The aroma is more like yeast, spices, and malts and the hops seem almost secondary, espcially as I am sampling an IPA. But the flavor tells a different story. The floral hops are omnipresent with every sip. A nice surprise."
"Gary's in Portsmouth has started carrying some McNeill's beers. So far I've had two IPAs and the porter. I hope they'll be getting more, because I'm liking this brewery and my likelihood of getting to Brattleboro is not great. In a pint glass this beer was a hazy amber color with a medium off-white head. It had a pronounced malt aroma and was also somewhat floral. Citrus, pine, and malt were all present in the taste. I thought this beer was well-balanced, and a nice example of an English IPA."
"This is clearly an English style IPA, from a very traditional interpretation of the style. If you are looking for a wildly hopped up american IPA or a nouvelle IPA with gobs of orange burst and blossom, than there will be some definite readjustment necessary. The beer is a lot more caramelly than one would expect. There is a wooden cask type residue underneath, with lots of phenols, bready citrus, a touch of orange rind, some earthy and grassy notes to this beer. My only real criticism is that the beer is way too watery for its own good. This beer needs some thickening up in the worst way. There is a cloying, almost syrupy sweetness to the beer, there are sweet malts running all over the place as well. It just needs a firmer body, maybe a touch more hop bite to balance out the sweet, almost bubblegum sugariness. The beer is cloudy, dirty water amber, with not much head retention and no lacing. The beer is definitely carbonated, easy to drink. If this had a higher ABV, it would have some brandy like qualities to it. There is also a bit of carboard mustiness in the nose."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a creamy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of malt and butter, caramel and maybe some floral hops if I squint, close my eyes and inhale. Taste is sweet malts, caramel, toffee and butter. Very little hops in the aroma or flavor. I had to call my wife over to verify that I wasn't nuts, but there is very little hops to be found. Medium body and carbonation, sticky mouthfeel. If they had called this a bitter I would have scored it much higher. An IPA this is not. Maybe there was some mix up at bottling time, but I have to assume that this is supposed to be an IPA. If I try this again I will re rate."
"Off the tap at Ri-Ra in Burlington this beer was a very cloudy/murky copper/amber color. The one finger yellowish-beige head displayed very good retention and very good lacing. The aroma was of citrus hops, some fruity esters and a little yeast. The flavors were quite hoppy at first with solid citrus definition before it went into pale malt, vanilla and wood. The finish was very 'green' with a lot of herbal (full leaf?) hops. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, the body medium and the carbonation medium. A solid Vermont offering."
"i would skip this one if served in a bottle but I'll certainly give it a try on tap. This one would greatly benificiate a second try, from a cask this time! Expect a second review in the future."
"The feel is milky but with a fizzy bite. Like a thick Belgian ale.A sipper. Could use a bit more ""liquidity."" Overall, it's funky like a Belgian ale, moreso really than it is an IPA. Good, but misleading. Doesn't quite live up to its appearance."
"Not a bad beer at all, but not one I'd seek out again."
"Bottom line: This is an interesting and tasty and very bitter example of an IPA. It's my first brew from this brewery and I like what they've done here. I've gotta try more East coast IPAs..."
"I went looking for the ESB at the booth and they did not have so I went with the next best thing I thought....I was horribly mistaken"
" Well done guys, keep it up. I wouldn't change a thing."
"Pours a medium amber with a medium lasting beige head. Smell is mostly hops, and somewhat dry. Taste is dry and hoppy with a light malt influence and moderate refreshing bitterness. Clean, refreshing, woodsy, lightly piney flavor. Medium body and carbonation. Nice."
"Overall mouthfeel is excellent. Smooth from start to finish, with a bit of bite on the side of the tongue. Yum!"
" Very interesting, if you love cask, you might dig this one, but it's hardly an IPA to me."
"An odd tasting English IPA. The flavors never quite come together: citrus solvency, burnt floral hops, tea, etc. One I'll pass on in the future."
"Overall a tasty EIPA. Good drinkability."
"Definitely tastes like an English version of the IPA. Malty, bready and not too much hop bitterness. I like it."
"On cask at the establishment last Wed. night,poured from the cask a lighter amber with a thin but well sustained head,English hop aromas somewhat leafy and floral with a bit of sweet malt intertwined.Pretty balanced IPA again the hop presence if leafy with a bit of citrus a firm sweeter malt base holds up to the hops through to the finish.Not bad it wont bowl you over with hops but its not bad."
"I love a well-done cask ale, and this is one."
"Had two years later and just as good or better. More sutable carbonation."
"Originally reviewed on July 22, 2006. 22 Oz Bottle. Aroma is a light misty dry hop, as of a barleywine profile. Profusive tanned fruits. Delicate. Pour of heavily clouded rich amber sienna, fogged with orange bursts of yeasts and hints of caramel. Bold tawny bowling over foamy head. Flavor is a magnificient run of malts and gentle fruit hops. Its like a wateredown barleywine, but not in a bad way. Flavor is an amalgamation of rich spice fruit, some bold yeast character and an astringent east meets west battle of the hops. Delectable and soothing. Some very light distant aged qualites, dancing with sherried persimmon and oxidized grain. This lends maturity and sophisitication. The malt is excellently constructed in this beer and thats what really shines. It also beams of balance, which I heavily appreciate. Smack is heavy of hearty hops resins and fleeting pipe tobacco. I can see why traditional american IPA lovers wouldnt like. Its not the typical clean, sweet west coast hop heavy animal that so many are. But, this is different. Better and far above, with more character than any other IPA can usually muster."
"Pours a cloudy orange/amber color with a small off-white head that fades away quickly. Smells mainly of citrus and grapefruit aromas and a stiff maltiness in there as well. Taste is of aspirin-like astringent hops, and some sweet malts, kind of weak though. I'm guessing this beer is kind of old as well. It seems almost flat...very little carbonation and pretty thick mouthfeel. The flavor ends very sharp with bitterness but doesnt stick around for too long. Alcohol is fairly detectable as well in the taste. Very balanced anyways. Not bad, not great either. But like I said, this beer is definitely old."
"Overall, I have a tough time getting fresh bottles from McNeill's. It doesn't help that I sat on it for a year but stuff happens. Well, it's either that, or that's just the way that they are supposed to taste."
"Drinkability: this was a bit heavier than expected, and was more meal-like than refreshing. Not bad, kind of unique, but not overwhelming."
"Pours an orangish red color with almost no head at all. The aroma is very fruity and pleasant. Slight grapefruit smell with the malts definitely present. The taste is very malty and sweet. Where are all the hops?! It has a very silky and creamy mouthfeel and is very easy to drink due to the low carbonation. Decent tasting brew, but an IPA this is not. Even by English IPA standards."
"As my previous review of a McNeills bottle productis there is a lot of inconsistency with them. But, I can resist buying them because when you get a good one, you get a good one"
"M & D: Mouthfeel isn't very good on this one. Not hoppy at all with a slight bitterness at the end. Not very carbonated at all--possibly this was a bad one. Would like to try it again, on tap. Drinkability on this is not very high."
"Picked up a bomber in Montpelier with a drink before date of the end of December (I think, the notch didn't line up perfectly). Pours an orangey brown with a fluffy off-white/tan head. Nice lacing on my glass. Aroma is very subdued, some tangy malt flavors, with some floral notes. Not much in the way of hops at all. Taste is toasty and nutty, with the hops making more of an appearance and nice spicy dry bitter finish. Medium carbonation, medium bodied, and extremely drinkable. Decent example of an English-style IPA."
"Drinkability: oh yeah."
"Utterly unimpressed. Expected much more. Usually like McNeill's brews. Been to the brewpub and walked out happy. Got a hunch this would be really good on cask. Poured absolutely flat. Cloudy orangey brown. No head (and I really, really tried). Nose is slihgtly sweet with a quick bitter pinch from the hops. Flavor is very malty, even for an English IPA. Hos are there but pressed underneath all the malts. Getting some overripe grapefruits and some other rotten fruits. Mouthfeel is very and wants to be chewy but falls short. Would work well in a pinch probably, but this is not a pinch."
"I wonder if this was a spoiled bottle, and if the real stuff on tap is what is giving it high ratings from BA's? All four of us agreed that this was the worst IPA of the 12 New England and Mid-Atlantic bottled beers in our blind taste test."
"Bomber bottle with freshness indicator notched onto the label. Pours into my Leffe challis with a rich almond amber tone, murky and cloudy, fine bubble film develops after the slim off white head dissipates. This one leaves alot of nicely striated and well dispersed lacing. Nose is mildly of soft hops and yeasty dough. Hoppy brew, but not overly bitter or harsh on the flavor receptors. English style all the way. The bottle I sampled was fairly fresh, the hops were well represented and flavorful. Malt is the also nicely in evidence, the result is a balanced, flavorful brew. Quite dry in the finish. Nice EIPA, get a fresh bottle and enjoy it."
"Drinkability- The worst IPA I have had by far. This one took the drain pretty quickly. Although, it's an English IPA, so....naaaa, this is just bad, no matter what style. Though, I thank spinlock for the effort in getting me a new beer to try. I just hope he didn't get one for himself."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over a smoewhat murky orangey amber brew. Head uneven, similar to a cask ale, kind of light and big-bubbled yet short-lived, fading to a small layer of bubbles, and laces average to well. Fruity aroma, coupled with ample malt character. Flavor is a letdown for me. Bitterness dominates upfront, not necessarily in a good way, which fades to a tart, almost sour, earthy malt taste. Mouthfeel is a bit lacking, in part due to extremely low carbonation, and drinkability is about the same. This one just didn't hit it off for me, will have to revisit and double-check that my observations were valid."
"Reflection: This is a pretty good beer but I like my IPA's loaded with hop flavor, this one was lacking in that area."
"Had this in a 22oz bottle with nice art of a dead horse on the label. This poured out murky amber with hardly a scattering of bubbles on top. No lacing of any kind. Smell is a bit of earthiness, mainly dirt. This smells like some on took half a cup of beer added half a cup of dirt and served. Well the taste follows suite with a funky dirt taste with a slight dirty bitter after taste. Mouthfeel is medium with more carbonation that I expected due to no head showing up. While not being particularly nasty this tasted like crap and is something I may have in the future since its possible I got a bad bottle. It was still before the best by date but oh well. Thanks to ppoitras for the brew."
"22oz: Rather dark orange. Fine off-white foamy cover. Very original smell for an IPA. This is bolder than most, extremely earthy, spiney, a spiciness (lemonspice type) that made me think of Amarillo etc. Good grapefruit flavour is gently complemented by an oregano earthy agressive bitter finish, rather tart at that. Very fruity, yeastier than most also. Firm medium body, lively carbonated. Definitely worth a try."
"Creamy, 1/8 inch head with full-on coated lacing. Kind of a thick, lazy amber hue, verging on light oak. Fruit punch burst on nose, with a strawberry Charleston Chew sugar underpinning. Crunchy, smoked flax and burnt malt taste at start, almost a soy sauce astringency to the whole concoction. Previously, I lived under the impression that I loved all things McNeills, but after this one, the spell was broken  caught off guard by the astringent notes."
"addictive scotch tape (mmmm, office supplies) quality of a good John Courage or Double Diamond on draft, the awesome balance and compelling tealike taste of Fullers ESB. All in all it just tastes like itself with the scale tipped a bit towards bitterness.This is one of the most unique and drinkable beers out there...but beware I have had more than one bad tap experience. It can vary greatly in in flavor and quality (like many beauties maybe it doesn't age well). I've sent a few back convinced I had the wrong beer but last Sat. at Redbones I knew it was the right one but I kept on needing more proof."
"The first few sips has a nice sharp hop bitterness, but as the pint goes down the sweetness of the malt starts to shine through. I really liked this brew at the pub, and the bottled version didn't disappoint either."
"I really enjoy this beer's aroma, especially when I'm taking a sip. The taste is fine, worthy of more than one."
"Taste: tiny tickle from hops at front, rides through the back of the throat, before disappearing. Light-bodied, minor mouthfeel...at first...this was a dud at first glance, but after a couple sips, it perked up, and the hoppiness became more prominent on the palate, juicy and fruity, zings on the buds, and plays nicely in the mouth. Still, lacks the bold bite I'm looking for, but pleasing enough."
"Drinkability: Its a tasty brew but with the minimal carbonation, this beer suffers a bit in drinkability.."
"Think I got a fresh bottle because this beer was kicking with flavor. An American-ized version of a British IPA, it fits neatly into neither of these polarized categories. Like its many bubbles, this brew is kickin'."
"Another good offering from McNeill's. Nice copper cloudy appearance with minimal head, but some lacing. Earthy and floral hops notes that are very nice. Taste had a citus hint and the finish kicked in a very nice hop bite. Mouthfeel was rounded and finish was dry. Drinkability was very good, considering the hop bite. If you like a nice hoppy finish this is worth a try."
"Served through a beer angine in perfect condition. Beautiful,cascading, very fine bubbles, builded into a nice fluffy white head that stayed for the whole pint. In addition to comments above this one was drier,crisper,fresher,and more floral."
"Zum wohl!"
"Thanks to mickeys01 for the samples!"
"This is a first class IPA and one I will be certain to pick up again."
"Id love to try it right from the cask."
"22oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy medium orange color with one finger of head. There is a bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly fruity, with a little citrus and a lot of white grapes, which is odd for an IPA. Only a little bit of hops present, but nevertheless a good smell. The taste is a little sweet and malty at first, but the hops really come through in the middle and finish. A bit of fruity esters in there as well. The taste could be a little bit more bold though. It seems a tad weak. The mouthfeel is very nice, heavy but still smooth on the tongue. The drinkability is fairly good as well, just a moderate amount of alcohol. Not a bad session IPA."
"F"
"Cloudy amber/orange color with a decent head and a little lacing. There was not much of a hoppy nose on this IPA but di detect some malty and bready notes. Nice thick and smooth mouthfeel with lite carbonation of tiny bubbles. Hop flavors were real nice with a somewhat mellowover all but left you with a strong presence in the after taste. Really nice bite to the hops anda nice grapefruit rind tart finish. Had some good chewy toasted grain and biscuit flavors in the malt."
"An amber/orange colored ale with a large head full of big bubbles. Also I am not sure is this is a bottle conditioned ale but there is certianly a fair amount of debris floating around. A nice light sweet floral scent to the beer. Initially light in the mouth but with a strong bitter after taste. I generally like Hoppy beers but this didn't suit my taste."
"Amber honey color, with some reddish hues coming through. White foamy bubbles sit atop, but I wouldn't call it a head. Spotty lacing down the glass. Aroma is of malt and hops, somewhat sweet, a little fruity. Mouthfeel is watery, with low carbonation. Taste is an even mix of malt and hops, with a bitter finish, like biting into an orange peel. A bit of smoke comes through as well. Lingering pine and citrus sticks in the back of the throat. Not my favorite from this brewer."
"It doesn't stand up to some of the other IPAs out there, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered."
" Drinkable, oh, don't get me started.. This is really a beautiful brew, well rounded and oh so tasty."
" Aroma is a nice blend of hops and malt, not overly powerful but lets you know it's going to be a nice thirst quenching IPA. Taste is very full, nice hop bitterness with plenty of english malt flavor and soem fruit esters mixing nicely - I taste a little bit of apple. Very smooth and alcohol is not noticeable, not as dry as some IPA's in the finish. Yummy...."
"Reminiscent of a british IPA, with an american twist."
"Bit of a one note beer...I thought it could use a bit more balance and have some malt characteristics. McNeills is probably my favorite New England brewery however, and I will always come back to this brew. pat"
"Umm! Lots of yeasty goodness floating about! This Cloudy Copper IPA holds a nice off-white head and trails of sticky lace. The aroma is of fresh hops, malt, yeast and alcohol. Medium malty and highly hopped with a strong grapefruit bitterness and mild citrus and metallic tanginess. The edginess mellows out towards the end of the 22oz bottle."
"If it was easier to find I'd be drinking this on those hot summer days!"
"Pours a hazy orangey brown, small tan head that leaves decent lacing on the way down. Aroma is lightly malt sweet, with some floral, pine and citrus hints from the hops. Flavor is initially sweet from the malts, then gets some good earthy, pineapple and grapefruit from the hops. Body is quite full, seems very close to a cask conditioned beer going down."
"Drinkability: This is a well done English-style IPA. It's not in the same league as the best IPAs out there, but it's quite drinkable and would match well with a variety of food."
"A very hazy brown with a small head. Quite fruity and a bit yeasty. The hops fit into the balance so wonderfully well. Very interesting IPA. Not supped up like most american IPAs these days. Mellow and very pleasant. Certainly worth your mouth's time."
"Pours a nice orange color, with a decent head. Hops, hops and more hops. They blast your senses from the opening sip to the last keptchap whacked drop from the bottle. The hops were not overwhelming, but rather delightful. A real man's beer, hearty and bold."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking. Not too acidic and no noticible alcohol taste."
"Cloudy copper/amber color with copious quantities of suspended and precipitated yeasties. Looks like someone stirred in a spoonful of horseradish. Multi-grain bread aroma, some oily hops as well. Flavors are pretty well balanced and the hops are fairly tame considering this is a McNeills brew and an IPA. Never fear though as the hops are the dominate player. Smooth, medium mouthfeel and relatively low level carbonation. Some tart/sour yeast flavor is noted. Good IPA but not quite what I expected."
"The beer as it sets in my glass a limpid copper color, the head is immature, and the lace satisfactorily covers the glass. Lots of malt at the front, lightly floral, somewhat sweet but all in all a great smelling beer. Top a bit slender in feel, sneakily hopped, moderate in carbonation, dry aftertaste. More an ""English"" IPA, than the over the top hopped American IPA's, but then I like both ""Sub-Styles", equally well for their own attributes."
"Extrordinarily drinkable, crafted IPA.  My new favorite IPA?  Could be.  This brew is everything great about IPAs.  Drink, Drink!  Cheers!"
"Notes: This is a balls to the wall English style IPA, perhaps they brewed something like this back in the day. Unfiltered and bottle conditioned for your tasting pleasure and it was certainly a pleasure for my taste buds."
"An interesting take on an IPA.  Very fruity tasting, almost like #9, with the fruit coming from the malt not the hops."
"29"
