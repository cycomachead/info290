"Probably not a good way to start, but I bought this beer on clearance. $0.98 per bottle a couple months after Christmas.  Going to stock up after tasting it.  Bad Elf pours a very interesting orange color and smell and taste are both bright and floral.  I appreciate this IPA for being less hop and citrus and more spice and rose.  I found it quite interesting and fun to drink.  Perhaps it's the season getting ready to change, but the beer speaks more of springtime than Christmas to me, although I suppose the spice may come through nicely during the Holidays.  Overall a unique an easy drinking brew, loved it."

"Overall / Drinkability:  Not an amazing beer, but definitely one that works to be drank in a full pint.  Any less and I think I would have missed something.  Works very nicely with food (cabbage and noodles).  I would not mind another small serving but I don't think I would want another full bottle."

"Pours a thin straw yellow with a little head that leaves a trail on the glass. The smell has citrus and bread scents running through. The taste was a bit underwhelming but the warmth from the alcohol was nice with the citrus from the hops. Not a bad beer to have during the winter months."

"O: Fizzy carbonation and sour mash and apple juice flavors put this one at below average for me. It wasn’t terrible, just not something I was that in to."

"Bad Elf pours a bright straw golden color, with a small lacing head. There is a sweet, cheap grain, and adjunct aromas. The taste is the same, a cheap grainy backbone, lots of adjunct like flavors, sweet apple notes too. Light, which is good, but has a nice crisp feel. Overall its watery, plain, and not too great."

"This is one of the better Ridgeway Christmas gimmick beers. Hoppier than usual for the style, but if you're not a fan of English IPAs this probably won't change your mind."

"Overall - A decent English IPA. Mild, smooth and drinkable, though nothing that really stands out. Reminds me a bit of Deschutes Chasin' Freshies, though not quite as complex, nor as assertive."

"This is actually a pretty good beer, and certainly drinkable. Nice hop presence and good balance. But who the hell brews a hoppy pale ale as a Christmas brew?! It just doesn't seem right - there's nothing linking it to the season other than the branding. I've marked it down slightly as a result; would probably be better in summer. Worth trying, but if you're expecting warmth or spices then you'll be disappointed."
"Poured copper with white head... forget it,I'm going to cut right to the chase, this is clearly a novelty beer and it was disgusting. Granted winter ales aren't my favorite, but this wasn't a winter ale, as the label claims. It tastes cheap and hits you like a cheap shot of liquor. It's a great Christmas gift but a terrible drink. Grab a anchor, bells, or Great Lakes Christmas instead."

"Ah, but it doesn't taste like a winter ale, or really look like one. That said, it is a fairly dry IPA with some bitter orange flavors and alfalfa. Golden orange color, a nice big head that fizzled away but left some nice lacing. I might just drink another one."

"O: A pretty nice and balanced English IPA. I could have stood for a little more malty, fruity esters and a stronger malt backbone, but it was still good. At 6% ABV, it reminded me more of a German Helles than an English IPA, but I do know that I liked it regardless."
""
""
"That bastard elf... This stuff pours a wan tawn topped by a finger or so of lightly off-white foam. The nose comprises musty orange peel, dark greens, dusty green apple, and dry biscuits. The taste brings in more of the same, with everything coming through blander, mustier. Gotta tell ya, it ain't all that satisfying. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a pretty sad EIPA all-around. Straight up."

"Dr: Decently drinkable. I wouldn't have it again; it's too simple and bland - especially for the style."

"O – Looks good, smells good….tastes bland."

"I would drink this beer if it was around but overall I felt it was fairly average."

"D - The aroma was typical and fine. The taste was quite underwhelming and got to the point of slightly gross near the end."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, vibrant, honey-gold coloring with no head. Aromas of dry, light hops, with an effervescent feel. Lemony citrus highlights on the nose, with a rich malt character, as well. The beer's flavors are light at first, with a dry, peppery hopping on the tongue, followed by a more full, robust, roasted taste that leads to a slight, sweet, malt flavor. Light bodied, with no cling to the glassware. The palate ends up being very well blended, with a spicy and slightly citrusy aftertaste. The finish is very crisp and clean, with a slight drying bitterness and spice that clears the palate for the next drink. Tasty."

"Overall very nice and well done Winter Ale. In my opinion this compares easily to some other easy winter beers such as Sam Adams Winter Lager: there is nice and rich flavor, easy to drink for every beer drinker and even suits very well with food. This is still far from the some dark, deep and even smokey beers which somebody may dislike."
"I was at the Kendall Pub enjoying themany fine offerings they have from Ridgeway which included the Bad Elf. The beer poured a copper color with a slight haze. There was a thin white head that provided good retention. The scent was slightly fruity yeast aroma and earthy hops. The taste was good, fruit and butter flavors are prominent with an earthy hop note beneath. Bitterness is moderate, a little astringent and at odds with the diacetyl. Overall not a bad beer."
""
"O -- Yes, I would definitely slot this into an English IPA and recommend it to anyone who likes the American cousin and would be interested in trying one brewed on original soil. The neat balance between biscuit malt and fruity to dry bitter hops is very appetizing."
""
""
"Drinkability: If this elf was bad (and the dude on the label looks pretty sinister), then he cannot be too far from good. It is pretty decent stuff, though."

"Overall: I'm not a huge fan of English style IPAs, in part because of the hops profiles, and in part because of freshness issues in imported beers. I do like the bitter citrus hops in this one, but I think it suffers from freshness issues. I need to go to England. Overall its a decent, drinkable IPA."
""
"Taste is very much in the English IPA spectrum of heavy bittering on top of breaded yeasty malt. Although once again I find that the yeasts and hops seem shelf-degraded. I'll have to come back and modify this review should I ever get my hands on a fresher example. The florals notes have been dulled and made sparse, but one can tell that the bittering of the hops has been carefully balanced against the sweetness. Too bad that's all I'm left with in this somewhat chewy, medium bodied brew. IMHO, the body could stand to benefit from either being much heavier or much lighter, this middle ground doesn't play right across the tongue for the flavors it carries. Of course, it might be just perfectly bodied for the flavor profile of a fresh bottle, but I am forced to review with what I have."
"This beer pours out as a light golden color. The head was soapy and white. There was a light amount of lacing on the glass. The smell is hoppy with some malts in the back end. The taste has a good bitterness to it and some grainy flavors in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was on the light side. Overall it's a pretty standard English IPA."
"While this beer is not ""wonderful"" or ""amazing," it is incredibly drinkable. Really pleasant all around and an almost ""quaffing"" brew that's just simple but good."
"Poured a murky orange-brown in color with virtually no head. Aroma was that of molasses and bread like malts with a light hoppy and doughy yeast scent.Tasted slightly bitter with a nice hoppy flavor and a hint of molasses and citrus.The aftertaste was sweet wit a touch of grapefruit which lasted a short while. Mouthfeel was full bodied and creamy with light carbonation. Overall a good beer Very Tasty!!"
"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Clear copper-yellow pour with big, fluffy two finger head with good retention and lacing. Hoppy, perfumy, floral nose with a malty backbone and hints of apples and caramel. Nice tangy, citrusy, bitter hop bite in the taste, well balanced by a sweet malty caramel base with a hint of apples and bubble gum. The mouthfeel is crisp and dry and slightly fizzy with a touch of chewiness. Slightly higher ABV then your typical English IPA, but you definitely can't tell. I'm thinking that some of the critical reviews were due to beer past its prime. This was extremely drinkable and enjoyable. It was closer to an American IPA then I had expected. Pleasantly surprised!"
"D: The beer goes down very easily and is quite sessionable."
"Stay away."
"D: a nice seasonal but there are that are better. I'll pick this up, but not in great qualities."
"The mouthfeel was smooth, really smooth. Medium body. Very drinkable."
"Pours a clear yellow. Much lighter than I would expect from a winter ale, which brings up an interesting point; the beer label says this is a ""winter ale"" while BeerAdvocate says this is an English IPA, so I'm not sure which style I should be comparing this too. The aroma has some spiced scents, but not nearly as much as I would expect in a winter ale. It also have very low hops aroma as expected in an IPA.l The same can be said for the taste, it has a hint of spices and low hops flavor. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth and crisp, this is a very drinkable beer. However, no matter which style this beer is judged on I find that it falls short on flavor."
"Drink- A little off to me but wasn't too bad. A gift from the wife. At least she tried."
"This beer pours with a golden straw color. A nice billowy head, with good retention, leaves little lacing. The aroma is slightly metallic with just a slight hint of hops. The flavors in this beer are hard to describe because they are all so weak. Mostly the flavor of unfiltered water with a touch of apple. The finish does have a faint hop note."
"Drinkability: For what appears to be a beer being sold for its amusing label, they certainly put a lot of good ingedients in it. Very tasty."
"Mouthfeel: medium-light body, pert carbonation, crisp"
"lighter body, higher carbonation. disapointing for the cost. I guess they rely on the gimmick of the labeling."
"D: This is tasty and very drinkable but pricey. I'm confused as to what Ridgway Brewing does the rest of the year."
"D - Very easy going, very easy drinker."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, there are better beers in the style but this is a solid beer worth drinking for a while."
"D - Recieved this beer from a friend, its not what I was expecting but a OK beer. I don't think I would buy it again but who knows. Theres just alot better out there in IPA styles and Winter Warmers."
"Atmosphere is very nice. Pretty decent appearance. Although not much carbonation or head to speak of. Nose is much better with a lot of varying grain notes, along with some sweet and spice. Flavor similarly is grainy, but less hoppy and more pungent. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"D: Not a bad winter IPA. I have not had many of this style, but I am starting to like it more. This beer did not wow me but it I do regret the purchase. I would not mind having this in front of the fireplace on Christmas Eve. Not too bad at all."
"D- Well balanced and easy to drink."
"Overall a decent English IPA, but needs just a hint more hops."
"Drinkability - Not a bad brew at all. Decently complex and good-tasting. Just wish I could narrow down the other ingredients in the taste."
"Pours a moderate brown color with a touch of an off white head and a bit of lacing. The nose brings a bunch of buttered bread lying underneath some mildly-appealing caramel and toffee notes. The taste goes down the wrong road, as the diacetyl really comes out here and takes over nearly everything. A bit of caramel, molasses, and maybe some spicing? It's really hard to tell with the butter. Mouthfeel is creamy and a bit gross. No reason to go through this whole beer; I did as much as I could to drink a few ounces but that was about all I could stomach."
"Copper colored with a slight haze. A gentle pour creates a thin half-inch head that shows decent retention. Fruity English ale yeast aroma; fresh stonefruit, bread, a bit of buttery diacetyl and earthy hops. Palate is decent, fruity and buttery flavors are prominent with an earthy hop note beneath. Bitterness is moderate, a little astringent and at odds with the diacetyl. Not a bad beer, but I wouldn't want to drink a full pint."
"Good drinkability, as well. I could have easily had a second, were one available. If the opportunity presented it, I would have this one again."
"D- The mouthfeel loses a bunch of points for me in this category. I wouldn't buy it."
"Overall, this is a reasonably drinkable beer but not something I would readily seek out."
"D- A really interesting and smooth beer. A nice treat to try."
"d - Overall this isn't bad, but it isn't great either. Way too much carbonation and the taste was lacking, but I could see a less carbonated bottle being easier to drink. Probably would not try and buy again."
"Overall- I'm a little bummed this in only a winter offering."
"D- Not much for this beer, it's very easy to drink but not too pleasing"
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a golden orange color with an off white head with decent retention and lacing. Bad Elf is not a bad brew, but nothing out of the ordinary either. The taste is dry buttery malts with peppery hops in the finish. Definitely worth a try. Cheers!"
"D-between its complex taste easy drinking body this beer is very drinkable i wouldn't mind drinking it all night"
"D Im going to want one of these yearly around dec. Im looking forward to trying the rest. its a nice package."
"I'm glad this was a gift, because i'm not into buying beers for the novelty labels."
"D: Quite drinkable, I really enjoyed this beer. Looking forward to trying the rest in the sampler from Ridgeway."
"D - My lips feel a bit sugar coated. Otherwise a nice beer. Easy to drink."
"Pours a macro lager yellow color with a white head. The aroma is very faint, with some slight hop character. The flavor is decent, easily the best of the gimmicky Ridgeway Christmas beers. You get some English hops and malts, but it is nothing spectacular. High carbonation and thin body."
"Overall I'm abit dissapointed with this one. I guess I just had high hopes after looking at the label. Drinkable but average."
"D- very flowery hop character blows out most citrus notes, imparting a very interesting flavor and aroma to this brew. good and drinkable, with well hidden alcohol. a nice holiday brew although it doesn't feel very christmasy."
"D: Eh. I wouldn't pass one up if you bought it for me, but I doubt I'd order it on my own again."
"Clear bronze with a fluffy off white head that leaves scaps of lace behind on the glass. The nose is bready and grainy with grapefruity hop notes. Candied orange and lemon zest with a rich malty backbone, pretty nice. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. a nice English IPA and my favorite of the Ridgeway holiday offerings I've tried."
"Pours a very clear golden color. Thin lacy head dissipates fast leaving a some oily looking bubbles. Smells like pale bready malt and a good amount of sweet piney hops. Not too much citrus flavors off this IPA, but a good amount of earthy tastes and piney tastes. Not bad. Very well balanced."
"D. i was impressed with this beer. it looked so simple and non impressive. the smell raised the bar and my eye brows promising a lot and i was hopeful that it would not let me down. this beer did not let me down, the longer i drank and thought about what was going on the more impressed i was. this beer seemed simple at first but was more complex than i have anticpated. i love pleasant suprises."
"D: very drinkable and enjoyable, glad I came out for this one. I could have a few of these as it was nicely hopped but balanced and pretty darn smooth. The bar was getting busy so my brain couldn't focus too much but I wanted to review it. Hopefully it will be there again on my next visit."
"Light amber-to-gold. smelled a bit of sulfur beneath the stone fruit and biscuit. Flavor is quite similar with a little dry edge from the hops. Kinda light-bodied for an English Pale Ale of 6% but it did make it more drinkable. At any rate they could easily achieve this body and flavor at a lower strength - say 4.5%, and that way I could make it my go to beer, and they would be filling kegs like mad to ship over here, and I wouldn't have to buy a retail pint bottle for the price a nice draft would cost in a bar."
"An interesting beer, i wouldn't think its an English IPA, very fruity, not sure if its from the malt, yeast, hops or a combination. Not too bad though, if you like english fruity beers."
"The body was typical for the style and drinkability was a little better than average. Overall, a very solid, enjoyable brew. Worth trying if you see it."
"on sight a nice pale amber, almost golden color. a good inch white head that lingers for a short while, small traces of lacing. aromas of fruity sweet malt. tastes a touch sweet at first, hops on the finish, with hints of carmel somewhere in the middle. overall i was suprised by this beer. i mainly bought it for the label and name, so Bad Elf is actually pretty good. cheers!"
"this beer is good to gooder. but it doesnt fit the winter warmer category. reminds me of what a ""double helles"" would taste like"
"Pours a very light golden traditional ale color. Small white head that quickly diminishes. Leaves a not-so-impressive lace. Not am overly impressive smell; very fruity. Tastes just as weak as it smells. Not too impressed by the smell or taste overall. Very smooth on the palette and goes down smooth as well giving way to a lingering aftertaste. Would have liked a little bit more quality for the $5.00 or so but overall not a horrible beer. Definitely won't be going out of my way to grab this one again with so many other winter style choices."
"Pours a clear amber, instafade white head. Smell: butterscotch, minerally, floral, grassy, lemon. Taste: floral, lemon, pine, buttery, slightly toasted and toffee but these are obliterated by a piney bitterness and big green apple. Finish like brushing your teeth, then biting into a granny smith, then rinsing with the hardest water you can get. Yes, it's hopped trending towards an AIPA, but the English characteristics clash horribly in the beginning of the nose and the end of the sip. F11-210. Not worth a try for $4.5/pint"
"Smells awesome. Tasts just okay."
"drinkability: wish this one was available year round because it is definately worth the price and it is very sessionable."
"It has a beautiful head and lace. They are both thick and full. It has a strong grainy and hop filled. It has a malty flavor at first but becomes floral and hoppy. It seems like they used a good variety of hops. It is mildly metallic. Other than the hops it the flavor was bland. It had a medium mouthfeel and was smooth. It was a pretty average."
"D - A very good beer. I have seen this in stores for a while so I finally bought it to try. I wish I had bought more to share with friends and family. Oh well, Christmas will be back."
"Pours a seethru orange-tinted gold with one-finger head that slowly receeds. A smell of mostly herbal and citric hops along with hints of bread and roasted malts, and possibly some caramel. A juicy, fruit-flavor bursting light body of lemon, pear, apple comprises part of the taste. A smooth and slick beer that finishes clean and has some minor sweet/chewiness from bread/biscuity maltiness. Also some minor spicing on the backend warms up the tongue a little. A simple beer but I could have this anytime; I really enjoyed it."
"D: Very drinkable. This would make a nice session beer. Will purchase again around the holiday season for comparison."
"Nikki"
"Pours a clear golden color. 1/4 inch head with decent retention and decent lacing. A thin film remains throughout the entire beer. Smells of sweet malt, some slight spice, a hint of fruit, and some yeast cleanliness. Fits the style of an English IPA, if not a weak example. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high level of carbonation. Tastes of sweet malt upfront, yeast flavors throughout, slight roasted malt in the background, sand some slight hops. Overall, a little weak in the hops than I'd expect and a little watered down. Still a pretty decent beer that's really easy to drink."
" ~ This is a very easy to drink brew. It has a mild feel and flavor but packs a solidness."
"Flavors are heavy on the light fruits...pears and grapes especially. I get some honey in there as well. Has the typical low carbonation of an English ale. Finishes clean and dry, but the taste is not really that bitter, more of a balancing hop presence. Damn close to having a soured beer flavor with all the fruits and acidity (thats a good thing for me). Thin bodied, but is a very relaxing and yummy beer. Appears to be a bit of Belgian influence here. A solid beer, but I dont like the 'winter warmer' claim on the label."
"Drinkability: What's not to like about this English Ale. Open and drink another."
"D: I'd definitely have this again, but as a spring or summer brew. There isn't anything here that indicates to me it needs to be consumed in the winter. Very light warming effect at best. Good solid English IPA."
"Pours a pure golden color with a rich creamy head. The head tends to dissipate, but still retains some good lacing. Not much going on with the aroma. Perhaps a slight banana presence. A very mineral upfront flavor that I would associate more with a German lager instead of an English Ale, but it works. Great mouthfeel. This is a beer you could drink throughout the night."
"This poured a clear, light gold with white head. It smelled like sweet yeast and lemon hops, with a bit of caramel malt. It tasted much the same, like lemon hops and sweet yeast with earthy caramel malt. It was watery with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very basic beer that wasn't bad, but was a bit dirty tasting. It wasn't crisp or clean, and had a mediocre body. This was barely worth finishing the glass, much less ever trying again."
"Drink ability - For the style, this beer is very drinkable, if I wanted to, I could have a few of these in one sitting. This beer says it is a ""Winter Ale"" on the bottle, but it could easily pass for a Summer Ale."
"I'm actually pleasantly surprised by this brew. My current bottle is part of a sampler pack, but if I could get this by itself I definitely might try it again. It's a good beer to start the night with."
"Got this in a Christmas gift set, probably a familiar story to beer nerds everywhere. The color is surpisingly light, it is very clear with a minimal head that soon leaves behind a thin sticky lace. Smell is honey and lemons, not the hops I would have expected. The taste is very smooth, malty, and with caramel and a nice hop balance. The mouthfeel is slightly sticky, slick, and slightly flat, not surpising for an English beer. Drinkability is good, as the balance and light flavor make for a very nice beer. I'd say the elf isn't as bad as advertised."
"It is drinkable and all, just hardly deserving of the (what i would consider) bold or extreme name ""bad elf"" and associated mischevous graphic. A better name for this beer should have been ""happy friendly little elf"". Yes, and im aware their other beers have progressivly sinister names."
"Medium body, but not what I would consider a ""Winter's Ale"". Nice smooth mouthfeel though, and definitely a good drinker. No problem drinking this big bottle."
"Quite easy to drink with a good flavor."
"Mouthfeel is actually pretty good - plays well on the tongue. And the drinkability is decent. Good while working on the car or mowing the lawn."
"For the English style it was ok but I prefer the American-ized IPA. Not bad to try, but would not purchase on my own."
"This was the favorite of the 4."
"D-This is a pretty drinkable beer...nothing to blow your socks off, but solid. Don't really understand why it is a seasonal...there is nothing ""winter"" about it, and I was expecting a higher dose of hops here."
"taste is oily, spice, fruit, bit of citrus, holly, caramel, somewhat bitter, hopy, and light malt, leaves the mouth on the sticky side."
"Other than the slightly higher abv, it's not particularly ""wintery", but who cares. A nice IPA that shows the English hops well, while being balanced. I could drink and enjoy in any season (though not ""session""). A very good representation of an English IPA."
"Tried laying one down from last year and the beer did not fare well. Won't do that again."
"Not a Winter Ale as I thought it would be... But very nice.... It would make a nice Christmas gift..."
"I like this beer. Not overly complex, but very tasty. Something I could drink more of."
"D: Easy to put down especially at 6.0% which drinks quite well though was only moderatly exciting."
"The drink is light-medium in body with minimal carbonation. A nice drink and very citrusy for an English IPA."
"The taste is initially pretty good but kind of fizzles and goes in a bunch of different directions. You get some up front alcohol and some malt sugars but the thin texture doesn't lend itself to the kick or flavor. There's a touch of hop bitterness for a flash but it passes quickly and the finish is sweet and just kind of fades away. I usually like English IPAs but this one doesn't really have the bitterness or hop profile or the malt or toasted qualities to be a winter warmer or strong ale. It's kind of a hybrid, but not something I'm going to search out again."
"I recommend this beer for those who want to try a winter type ale"
"M:"
"Nothing spectacular but glad I finally found a bottle to give this a try. I wasn't a huge fan of it but it was pretty good."
"This brew pours a nice orangy amber with a thick white head. Although it is an IPA, the aroma is surprisingly malty, with just a touch of sweetness. Flavor is richly hoppy, with a strong malt component, a hint of fruity sweetness, and only a whisper of hop bitterness. It goes down smoothly but with a good alcohol edge and a hoppy, mildly bitter aftertaste."
"D - This was okay. It wasn't as flavorful as some other of this style."
"Not a bad brew at all. I'm glad to have tried it."
"Well, i'd say this is more of a IPA than a winterale. Still, for an IPA it is not bad. Still, this is not something i'll go back to again anytime soon. Average."
"Although marketed as a ""winter ale", this is certainly an IPA... Pours a hazy, straw-colored hue with minimal frothy head that soon dissipated... Smell was noticeably an IPA... replete with hops, vanilla, and slight caramel... taste strongly complemented the aroma, with ultra-fresh hops, grains, citrus, and a noticeable bitter-sweet aftertaste that was rich, thick, and satisfying... first-ever brew from this English company, and I must admit that I was very satisfied... This 1 pint .9 fl oz was pretty pricey at almost $5 at a local store in Short Hills, but I didn't recognize the label or brewery, so I wanted to give it a try... all in all, an excellent IPA that really stood out due to its pure and fresh flavor... definitely better than the average depiction of the style... Definitely recommended..."
"This is a solid, well-rounded beer, not outstanding but good indeed. It's not a beer to quaff, but rather to patiently drink and enjoy. I would not characterize this as a Winter Ale per se, but rather a nice IPA, similar in hop allotment and style to, but different in flavor from Samuel Smith's IPA. It will come around."
"Its got very good drinkability, both single bottle or sessioning, but the problem with this brew is that it presents as being a special holiday brew, but all in all, its just another EIPA. Its very average."
"Not a whole lot of complexity on this one, it is however a tasty and easy to drink beer. Not bad."
"D - Mild flavor makes it go down faster than the usual sipping speed of the winter seasonal. Good winter session brew."
"A noticeable apple and butter is buried in this along with a biscuit like medium mouthfeel. Cheers but not for me."
"Overall an attractive and aromatice ale. The flavor and drinkablilty suffer from the acridness."
"Pours an amber that is clear with quickly dissipating head. Slightly hopped nose with a sweet edge and caramel influence. Flavor is bitter and sweet at the same time. Feel is slightly touched with bubble. Drinkable, sure. But this bottle cost me $6. For that price I could be getting a Rochefort, a St Bernardus, or a wide array of other home runs. Nice to try, but at this price I would never go back to it."
"Bottle poured a light red to copper hue with a small one to two finger white head that lasted for a few minutes leaving behind a little bit of lacing. It has a nice hoppy aroma to it, somewhat like a pine tree smell. It also smells of some citrus like orange or lemons a bit. It has an upfront hoppy bite to it that leaves behind a lingering citrus peel bitterness. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin, with a small amount of carbonation to it. Overall, it is a pretty good brew. Nothing real special but solid and drinkble."
"My first English IPA and I can now really see the difference between the traditional style and what it has become in America. This one looks, smells, tastes and drinks more like pale ales that I am used to."
"Clove and coriander in the sniff, then the quaff  semi-lame taste of light winter spices with a decent kick of hops. But this aint some bad arse winter ale, and at $4.50 a 500ml, not to good of a buy. If someone offers a freebie, grab it, but Im not looking for this elf again."
"Pours a clean golden orange-ish color with a white head. In the aroma, a sweet maltiness. In the taste, sweet maltiness again and kind of skunky even. A smooth, watery malt mouthfeel and a small dry malty aftertaste. Name sell this one, just an English ale, but not that great of an English ale."
"Eh. This beer is more of a gimmick than anything else, but its not bad. Its just that there are so many other Christmas beers that are better. Pours amber with a head that quickly settles to a thin ring. Smells of sweet malt and alcohol. Fruity with apple and apricot as well in the nose. Taste has flavors similar to the aromas with the addition of a fairly substantial breadiness. Plum, apple, and apricot flavors with a slightly bitter finish round it out. Mouthfeel is crisp with a creamy finish. Tastes a little hot and not very well integrated to make this highly drinkable."
"Pours a dark gold, very clear, with a small but persistent white head. Aroma is crystal malt, with subtle butterscotch and hints of earthy yeastiness, all mingling with rustic British hops. Flavor is strong caramel upfront, balanced with a pleasant hoppy bite, and with some distinct but pleasant butterscotch in the background. Finish is very clean, with a hoppy aftertaste leaving you wanting more. Alcohol is strong, but blends well and is not at all unpleasant. Overall, a very well balanced beer."
"over-rated cha cha chachacha over-rated cha cha chachacha! Is it just me or does the entire elf series taste almost exactly the same but with more alcohol taste as it goes along? Some breweries have similar tastes in all their beer (sammy smith, het anker, rodenbach, sam adams) but those are in a good way, this one not so much. They all pour a thick yellow/orange. they all taste like rotten alcohol, and they all have a funk to them that makes it hard to drink twice in a row. it tastes like heartburn in a glass. sorry ridgeway, I am not a fan. even the winter and santas but and lump of coal have the same thin yet thick funkiness that turns me off."
"Pours a crystal clear light copper color with a small white head that dissipated into a small ring. The smell was almost non existant; perhaps some light hop action. The taste was of very light caramel malt, has a slightly odd sourness to it. No real hop or winter warmer spicy flavor to this brew. The feel is light but not watery, soft carbonation, finishes neutral. A very disappointing brew as an EIPA or winter warmer but a very sessionable brew with no off-putting flavors."
"D = This is definitely a drinkable beer. I could imagine drinking it each year (and think I will from now on), but if I was planning on drinking several beers, I would probably pick something where the flavor and aroma had a little better balance."
"Although one can argue if this is a Christmas beer or not, it is a very drinkable and well crafted IPA."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden color, nice carbonation, nice little white creamy head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, slight hop, and lots of caramel. The taste is mostly malty, with some hops thrown in, and caramel. This is a very nice English IPA. Slightly sweet too. Medium body. Drinkable, recommended."
"Pretty much your standard IPA (which is a good thing). Most of the hype around this beer is from the label in the series of beers. Everything in this beer is where it should be. Recommended."
"Good. I want another one."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a thin head that quickly diminishes to a ring. The aroma was caramel malts and earthy citrus hops. The taste was citrus hops slightly overpowering sweet caramel malts. The beer is crisp and refreshing with decent warming alcohol. This one certainly makes for an interesting Winter brew."
"This is a nice English IPA. One shouldn't expect an example of this style to be ""over the top," but with a slightly lighter body and flavor profile. I enjoyed it, and wish I had another!"
"Upon the pour from the 500ml brown bottle, the beer appears a slightly hazy golden amber with a modest off white head that settles quickly, leaving a thin coating of lace upon the glass. Nose has a nice sweet malt aroma, with a pleasant hop flowery tone, citrus like crispness, also a wee bit of bread dough. Front has a delightful malt presence, the hops as spicy as any American IPA, top is medium in feel. Finish has a brisk acidity, the hops pound your taste buds, and the dry aftertaste coats your palate, a Damn Good IPA."
"Decent carbonation, but a little thick. An enjoyable beer, in moderation. Certainly not a session beer."
"Last swigs: Cherry 7-Up. Needs more depth."
"this fell a little flat for me. A very clean beer, tastes good but I wasn't overwhelmed by it a very ordinary beer. I may have overhyped it in my mind because of the cool bottle."
"I thought this beer was quite drinkable and did not overpower you with the hops. Very well balanced and the crisp toasted malt reminded me somewhat of a lager."
"not bad, not something that i would rush out to get. Got it as partof abeer of the month"
"D - Got this for free, and I'd drink it again for free, but not worth import prices, IMO."
"Drinkability - Good beer. Finds a nice balance, not too sweet, not overly hoppy. Plus it has plenty of alchol for a long winter's night. Mildly amusing Chrismas theme is a plus."
"I remember these being better when I drank them before. Maybe this wasn't a great bottle...my scores are a bit higher than my review may suggest based on my memory of the other bottles which i enjoyed a bit more."
"Imported bottle with the wonderful elf illustration on the label. Green cap. Enjoyed in a nonic pint glass. Pours a orange highlighted gold. Pretty clear throughout with some slightly cloudier areas as a light sediment clears. Weak head. Tried to force pour it but it wouldn't cooperate. Fuzzy white head which disintegrated after a few minutes...looks like a real ale. Nice fresh, floral aroma that makes me think of spring! Taste is full of citrusy hop flavor and an even hop bitterness. Slight malt sweetness to finish it off. Super smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel. Very slight carbonation like a good real ale. Quite drinkable to boot. Fantastic English IPA."
"Overall, this is a nice English IPA. It's flavorful and pleasant."
"A good version of an English-style IPA with no surprises, good or bad. This one will be most remembered for its balance."
"Another ""Beer of the Month"" sample. Had I not known this was from England, I would have assumed it to be a domestic craft beer. The beer surprised me. Medium ""orange"" in color with tiny bubbles streaming up the side of the glass, it poured with a smooth textured head that fell quickly and lace the glass. A definite hop presence in the nose, and the taste was at first malt then a definitive hop flavor that stopped just short of overpowering. A very fresh tasting, smooth, drinkable IPA. When I saw ""Winter Ale"" I expected something a bit darker and maltier. This was a refreshing surprise. And an import no less. Definitely one to watch for."
"Drank very easy, a bit pricey at $6 a pint. One of the better UK imports I've hade in a long while"
"Pours a clear golden amber color with a short white head that quickly fades into a trace amount of lace. Nose is floral hops with notes of lemon zest and bubblegum. The same floral hops in the aroma are the key players in the taste though they are nicely paired with a sweet fruitiness and toffee-like maltiness. More of a hop bitterness level than your typical English IPA offering. Easy drinking and refreshing."
"This ale poured a clear, golden-amber color with white foam that settled and clung to the glass a bit. The smell was a bit sweet and malty, somewhat reminiscent of a Belgian tripel. The taste was a little sweet and malty, and like the smell, it reminded me of a Belgian ale. The hoppiness seemed low for an IPA, but it came out a bit in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium-full body and modest carbonation. It was relatively clean. This was a very nice, drinkable ale, and the 6% ABV was not apparent."
"D:Excellent cold weather brew."
"Very easy drinking IPA - both due to the thin body and the very nice flavor. The taste more closely resembles an American IPA, so I'd recommend this one to enjoys an IPA brewed on either side of the pond."
"Medium body,a good sticky hop feel,a very drinkable beer,easy drinking,pleasing and satisfying. Nothing fancy here just a very good beer,wish I had another."
"Drinkability: A perfectly proper, English take on the IPA. Very subtle and balanced, but if you like bold hops, may not be your glass of beer."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance is excellent. No really noticeable alcohol presence. Not sure why this is a ""winter"" beer honestly. Crisp, pretty refreshing. Very drinkable..wouldn't mind having another."
"Without a doubt the best English IPA I've had."
"not sure the price justifies buying this every year, but at least i got to try it and keep the cute and cartoonsh x-mas themed bottle."
"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass. It had a dark amber color with a finger of head that slowly dissipated, no lacing. The smell was heavy on the hops as expected since the label says they put 3 pounds of hops into each barrel. The aroma started out strong then faded pretty rapidly as it warmed up. The taste was average and really didn't leave that great an impression. Since it was kinda weak, I could drink a couple of these except that they cost is way on the expensive side for what you get. The mouthfeel was also average with just a hint of creamy. Overall, a decent beer with great marketing (don't fall for it). Slightly recommend but don't hurt yourself finding it. (3.5, RB, T, Y, mini-session)"
"I like it a lot."
"(11.2 oz / 33 cl)"
"Pours a glossy orange, with a lightly white frothy head that relaxes into a thin top coat. Floral hops, some tender grapefruit and freshly squeezed lemons are all in the nose. Up front are some creamy hops, light citrus flavorings, a near sweet and sour feeling. An in your face bitterness as the malts develop; medium bodied. As she warms, some piney hops are formed, traces of alcohol. If you're a hops-head, you may be shaking for more hops, yet this is a nicely laid back E-IPA. Decent for the style, best when enjoyed fresh. Pretty good."
"Overall: Originally a little hoppier I recall, this years seems a tad more malty to the palate, but this is still a solid brew, despite the fact that I dont really consider this to be a traditional Winter Ale by any definition. That said, this is by far the best of the Elf range of beers from Ridgeway, for my money the Very Bad, Seriously Bad and Criminally Bad just get worse with strength. Bad Elf is the original and harks back to its roots and doing what Ridgeway do best. More of a premium hoppy English Bitter than anything to do with Christmas or Winter  a little expensive but a pleasant brew overall."
"I liked this pretty well. A bit pricey, but an enjoyable English import!"
"This beer is fab. No, it's not an American IPA. If you been to the motherland and enjoy British beers, you'll like this one. It's rather delicate for being a winter brew. Pours a lovely straw colour in a pint glass. There is light citrus and a tad of diacytl followed by solid bitterness. There are no rough edges, just a very civilized brew. If you don't like British beers, it's a waste of time."
"Appears golden amber in color with a quickly dissipating off white head. Smells of citrus hops and some sweetness like caramel. Tastes of grapefruit with the sweetness of caramel, with a little bit of bitter aftertones. Smooth and creamy with a little tingle, nice sticking feel afterwards. Very good English IPA, though not very Christmas inspired, and kinda expensive."
"Better than average, but not worth the $5/bottle."
"Taste was (thankfully) not as sweet as I worried it might be, though Id have expected a little more spice (orange peel, white pepper, coriander) for a winter ale. An English ale that is not at all unpleasant, even drinkable, but not spectacular."
"Poured a big head. It is living in a world of dry citrus and spciy aroma's. At first taste it was a english ale that had desires to become bigger. The mouthfeel of the beer is more rich than I expected, sort of creamy. It is definately an english ale. Further into the session it became increasingly hoppy to my palate and more complex. A good time!"
"Pretty good, a moderately hoppy beer. Not sure how it fits into the whole winter seasonal scene, but I guess even Santa needs a hop fix now and then. Competition for Celebration won't be coming from this direction."
"Overall, a solid, medium bodied beer, very drinkable, but somewhat expensive."
"Pours a golden-amber color topped by a smallish creamy white head that descends into a small halo quite quickly. Aroma of crisp English hops, lightly fruity malt, and a touch of light fruit (primarily apricot). Palate is nice and typical of a good English IPA - crisp fruity hops, light fruity malt, overall a nice tart fruitiness. Medium body has a pleasant creamy character to it. I could drink a lot of this if it weren't for the rather high price."
"Very Ale-like for a Christmas beer. In that, I mean a strong pale, estery, fruity, and hoppy brew without the amber or red malts that I expected. Instead, I found a pale malt brew with big fresh English hops that shows a lot of pine and earthy character. Mildly woody, but reliant on peach, appricot, apple and pear flavors to carry the brew. Spicy and mellowed with a nice maturation. Feels medium to the palate with a firm texture that rides into the finish. Finishes with a warm, hoppy flavor and feel. Good brew, but not what I expect from a Christmas brew."
"overall: drinkablility is good, will try this again, refreshing, don't expect hops like an IPA, almost has a cider quality. Has that Ridgeway quality to it."
" Yes, very drinkable. I wish I had gotten more."
"Refreshing IPA. I Like it, bit don't love it. good ber to sample every once in a while"
"Mouthfeel is medium and clean. Good as a beer, but this is much closer to a pale ale or golden ale than anything resembling a traditional winter seasonal."
"Mouthfeel is thick and creamy and would make a good beer to prepare for the transition from your heavier winter fare into those lighter brews for your warmer months ahead."
"Poured a perfectly crystal clear medium amber color. Head is a slightly creamy off-white and has slowly fallen to a thick ring with light surface coating. Nice creamy lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is hoppy with many citrus and piney notes to be found. Some summer fruitiness also present to form a nice combination with thhops. Initial taste is a medium bitterness that almost immediately fades to allow some fruity maltiness to show through. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Finish is a moderate dry bitterness that definitely beckons for another taste, whicj I will gladly satisfy. Some alcohol also begins to show itself at the ending with a nice warm feeling in the mouth. Very drinkable and superbly enjoyable. This is really an excellent beer. (And the label is nice too)"
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. A decent white head sits on top of a hazy amber body a steady flow of bubbles rising to the top. Nice lacing follows the head down. Some floral, earthy hops with some bready malt in the nose. The body was disappointing. Fairly thin lacking the malt backbone I would expect. Weak hop expression with some citrus hops bringing up the rear. Not one that I will spend my money on in the future."
"A good beer, enjoyable, but at its price, I'll have to pass this by for other good options."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom sixteen ounce glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Between this, Very Bad Elf and Seriously Bad Elf, this one appealed the to me the least out of the three. Can't quite pinpoint why that is, but for an IPA, this was nothing special and even less so as a winter release."
"Cheers!"
"cheers..."
"Overall, I did can really dig this beer. But at almost $5 a bottle, i might pass in the future. Also, saying a winter's ale on the bottle made me think it was a winter warmer, which it is not. I think i would enjoy this more on a hot day."
"A high quality beer. I'd love to try a cask-conditioned version of this."
"This brew is an orange color with a moderately sized white head. The liquid is very clear. The aroma is citric (decidedly, and almost sourly, grapefruit) and give the impression of freshness. Theres a little grain and malt underneath, but theyre hidden far behind the hops. The taste is similar to the aromaserious citric hoppiness with a faint undertone of malt. Its a little grainy, fairly dry, and decently carbonated. Its refreshing and cleansing, to be sure, but I thought that this one could have been helped by a little more sweetness and balance. Its drinkable and worth a glass. I wouldnt call it an English-style IPA thoughit sure seems to take its inspiration from the West Coast."
"D- This is a nice smooth English style IPA. It would be nice with a bit more body and if the malt had a bit more depth to enhance the hops. Very quaftable non the less."
"This one grew on me the more I drank it. Not bad."
"Extremely smooth on the drink. Creamy mouthfeel. Nicely done. Taste is slightly bitter and slightly floral. A touch of lavendar and clove. Some subtle hops. Better than I thought it would be. Flavors are small but complex. Well balanced. I like it."
"The taste is fairly dry with a nice sharp, almost biting bitterness that carries through to the end. The hop flavor is a mix of herbal, perhaps even grassy, and lemon like citrus notes. There is a touch of malt sweetness that sneaks in to the middle of this beer; it accentuates the citrus character a bit and provides some balance to the hop notes. This has a nice heft to it, that is not too light and yet not so heavy that this is not quaffable. This beer tastes quite similar to what I would describe as an American brewed English style IPA. Restrained crystal malt character with lots of hop character. As the beer warms up the simple grain sweetness picks up a bit and this in turn accentuates the citrus notes a bit; even picks up some notes of orange. This is definitely quite enjoyable."
"M&D: the initially smooth mouthfeel is balanced with the subsequent overwhelming bitterness and hops. Very satisfyingly hoppy strong ale, though Id expect its body to be a bit more rounded and better-balanced with more assertive malts, suppose in one more year of ageing it could just be like that?! Shall buy another bottle and age it. Solid brew!"
"This pours a dark bronze with a 2 finger head that disappears quickly.The mixture of malt and hops make this a nice smelling beer.However,this mixture is a little tough on the taste buds.This is very malty and very hoppy.Together,this makes a beer that is not very balanced at all.I think if they cut back alittle this would be better tasting.The m/f is medium and very unbalanced.This is not a bad beer,but the hype doesn't live up to the taste."
"M&Dr - Good carbonation and medium body. I prefer more hops in my IPA's but i know this is an english style so it's okay and it works. Nonetheless, this is a tasty brew."
"Lighter amber color, fairly transparent. Two fingers of pale head and average lasting-power. Laces fairly nicely, tendrils and incomplete rings. Hoppy aroma, leans on citrus with some impression of fresh gum turpentine. Light/medium mouthfeel, decently lively carbonation. Straightforward flavor, skewed toward the hops, fairly fresh and bracing with enough fruitiness to keep it from being overly dry. Decent but unremarkable malt balance, caramel and powdered sugar. Pleasant enough beer, drinkable, somewhat North American in many flavor aspects."
"Very similar to some west coast brews but still fairly smooth and very easy to drink. Medium bodied and decently filling but not heavy. You may want several.."
"I've never had any aged SN Celebration, but Bad Elf seems like what I figure a few years would do to that beer, mellowing it out. I like it. Quite drinkable."
"Very enjoyable brew. Although I wouldn't knock more than two of these back in rapid succession, I am keeping a few on hand for when the the typical American counterpart isn't what I am looking for."
"On tap at the Blind Tiger in NYC. Bartender Kate told me this one was ""a little flat"" I saw it as simply on the low carbonation side and that was just fine. Poured light honey golden amber, Mildly hoppy nose, minor head, natch, and no lacing. Agressivly hopped for a British IPA, thats a good thing!, Grainy hops evident and fresh tasting. Overlaid on a nice biscuity malt base. Long malty finish. Tasty and very pleasant, Brit brew with pleanty of character, I havent tried it in bottles, but the tap version is deserving of a try or two If you find it on at your local."
"This is a slightly hazy golden color, lots of bubbles rising up to a big white head on the top.Nice lace trails. Fairly light nose, piney hops. Light pale malts in front, fairly dry, nice levels of bitter and pine hops rounding out the backbone. Some spice involved. Bits of fruit as well. Exceptionally hopped for the style, at least compared to what i have had. Not quite as intense as the west coasters here, but a nice hoppy treat. Med bodied. Nice english style IPA."
"Drinkability: Just OK; marred by the alcohol penols that get in the way of the malt and hop flavors"
"A cloudy golden color, and if you put it up in light you can see tiny yeast particals. The head is very good. Not sticky but stays in place. I can smell a nice aroma of hops. The taste is very balanced. Malts hit the tounge first, but followed soon with a spicy hop flavor. The hops tend to stick around a bit. A very good English Pale ale, but I can't say it is a IPA."
"Lovely toast color under light, coarse froth. High head that doesn't leave any mark on the glass. Citrus aroma. Lemony resin in the finish. Perfectly tender mouthfeel. Lemon and grapefruit over slight toasty malt. Simple, clean flavors. Overall, so light and lovely, that despite all the other fantastic beers in this place, I must have another ."
"I had a small sample of this beer from what was left in the firkin after the big opening of Saturnalia last night at Rich-O's. The beer poured a nice yellowed golden color with a nice figer or two of head with some retention. The nose was full of grapefruit hop and some very earthy undertones as well. The flavor was really nice, with a great hop profile with grapefruit and caramel from the malts. How nice. The beer was moderate to thick and creamy. Nice. Overall, this is a fantastic brew, and I think I enjoyed it more on cask better than from the bottle."
"Drinkability - a great beer that would be tasty any time of year."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a nice 2 finger white dense head but lacing is light. Aroma is hops floral earthy hops musty grass lots of hops hard to find the malt in the nose. Taste is hops mixture of bitter grapefruit and musty grass leave a lingering bitterness that asks for more please, not overly bitter by any means just lots good hop flavors. I get a touch of sweetness from the malt at the start that is soon overtaken by glorious hops this is one serious English Style IPA must say I enjoyed it. Mouthfeel is little light but then again hops don't have much body. Drinkability is good it has restored my faith in English style IPA's."
"Overall, I was really pleased with this brew. I was expecting the same old ""Spicy Winter"" taste and was pleasantly surprised to find a really nice Winter IPA. Would definitely recommend anyone trying, no matter what time of year."
"50 cl bottle. Pours a straw gold color with some deeper golden highlights. Fluffy eggshell colored, rocky head. Fresh, flowery/oily hop aroma; notably Cascade. Hop bitterness that is herbal/vegetal and citrusy and lasts into the finish and lingers afterwards. Light maltiness, but only a glimpse that manifests itself as tea-like tannins that meld well with the hop bitterness. Minerally water portion. Lower carbonation allows the hops to shine through without becoming too acidic. Finely crafted and highly enjoyable for those that like hoppy ales."
"Drinkability is solid. Traditional English Ale well done for the most part but underlying note of sulfur and mineral water is slightly off-putting."
"I sampled this at the local pub - actually stole a drink from kmpitz2, as it was he who ordered it. It pours a golden color with a small head that dies off quickly and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is very hoppy - citrus hops, mostly, with some caramel malt backbone. The flavor was much the same. Definately an IPA, British hops. Nice mouthfeel and easy to drink. Very good beer."
"Off white head , a hazy amber hued pour.Aroma is kinda citrusy and yeasty.Ditto for the taste,though there is a slightly sour and alcohol finish.I like the label ,and that warning about driving and machinery. We need humor wherever we can get it.I was happy with this ,though, for a winter ale,I prefer SNCA.Unfortunately I haven't gotten hold of this year's version yet."
"Poures a light golden with a orange hue to it with a huge fluffy that sticks like glue to the sides of my pint glass that was a little unexpected,big aroma of lemon rind and some leafy hoppness very fresh and vibrant definently bold.A really dry brew some spearament notes and some grean leafy elements a big crisp dry malt backbone holds up well with the big bitterness of this beer.A real English IPA highly hopped but not over the top by any means dry and crisp a real drinker I wish I had more."
"Nice enough, but the grinning, evil elf on the label led me to believe something more sinister."
"Pours a bad (elf ass) deep honey color and displays ample sticky head and lace. Aromas feature lemony hop and sweet biscuit. In the mouth the beer offers more lemony biscuit flavors and a big kiss of bitter hop. While I find this beer attractive it seems to lack individualality, hence making it just another decent IPA in my book. Albiet, I love it when a Winter seasonal is something other than a spiced up load of..."
"Props for the 6.0 alcohol content."
"Appearance: Light golden amber tone with a full frothy white head leaves large evenly strung patches of lace, nice. Aroma: Hop cones fill the air very citrus in nature almost easy to call it lemon or lime blended with flowery hops and an easing light malt backbone definitely some hops in an English IPA oh yeah. Taste: Layers of bittering hops as for the hop flavor it comes through in micro bursts of zest from a citrus fruit and slight pine needles not bad just a bit unbalanced not enough sweetness to balance out the hops here. Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied ale not bad nice fine carbonation good stuff. Drinkability: Decent brew out of the UK thank heavens for American IPAs man am I thankful, this is good but it's not a Stone IPA or Sierra Nevada Celebration."
"Sampled 12/31/03"
"Pours with a two-finger white head that stays and leaves a nice lace. Nearly clear, golden amber color and nose is seriously hoppy. Medium bodied. Starts hoppy, finishes bitter. Unusual for a winter ale (no spices) but the label points out that they are heavy handed with the hops. $3.99 for 500ml."
"bad elf was probably a good choice for the name of this, because i could imagine a couple of elfs gone bad being squeezed into the mix of this concoction...i hate to be mean to beer, but the old saying too many spices ruin the soup..can be applied. I can't completely knock this advent beer...i can see where it was trying to go but maybe it shouldn't have gone that far. The beer does pour a decent orangy color with a good head, it's thick and coaty to the tongue which would be good except that the overrush of fruity, nutty, bready, and spicy just seem to remind me of a swedish herb cough drop, but hey if you are ever laid up in bed with the flu..it would make a great alternative to cough syrup and the buzz would be much better. sorry bad elf...but when people ask me what i think of you..the usual reaction is gak"
"Pours with a small-bubbled, bone-white head about a finger deep that slowly recedes to less than half a finger but regains some life with a good swirl. No cling to the lace; there are a few streamers. The beer is translucent amber-to-gold, but really kind of ordinary-looking. Smells of fruity, primarily lemony/citric hops; deeper down (brought out by agitation) there are almost tropical fruitnesses--papaya/mango? and sour apple. Nosefeel is leafy, long, and high. Taste begins with an element of sweet, tangy fruit (definitely mango now) overtaken by an emergent, rolling bitterness that ends up very smart on the midpalate. Here, the hops get herbaceous: fruitiness is by now powerfully displaced by a basil-bordering-on-rosemary, sharp herbal quality. Pretty well balanced; sustainedly bitter. Mouthfeel is somewhat foamy at the roof of the mouth; the rest of the body thinnish; light resins pucker the mouth for a few good moments. Wow, that bitterness just really has me coming back in the drinkability dept... invigoratingly refreshing! Personally, I find this brew's flavor and character more in fitting with the celebration of spring's thaw than for stretching out next to the fireplace in winter... but I still found this quite enjoyable. A pleasant surprise."
"On tap at Lucky Baldwin's it golden-orange with a thick white head the leaves lace all the way down the glass. The smell is decidedly hoppy with load of malt and some spice. The taste is on the bitter side, but certainly not over the top. Moutfeel is nice and it goes down well. I used it to wash down some chicken curry at Baldwin's. If I hadn't known, I would have pegged this as a Pacific Northwest IPA."
"Not at all what I was expecting, but very satisfying."
"Slightly hazed light amber tone. Small and disjointed bone white head. After a minute, a thin rimming is all that's left. The aroma is strong and upfront. And quite nice. Citrusy, resiny, pungent, mint and bigtime Bubblegum. The taste is stylin. This has got to be the most hopped up UK beer I've ever had. You'd guess it was from the West Coast USA if you didn't know better. The hop flavors are pungent and somewhat raw....bitter and piney...smoky and cannabis like...resiny and ctitc. Damn, this is pretty good. The malt backing proves to be more than capable and is toffee based. Body is a little better than medium and this beer flows over the tongue with ease. The one negative is the price tag...5.39 for 16.9 oz. It's good, but I can find IPAs from this country just as good for lesser $$$$. Glad I tried it once though."
"Hazy copper color with a large frothy head that leaves a good lacing in my glass, citrus and piney hop aroma. Hoppy fruity flavors with a nice hop bite, medium body with a creamy soft mouthfeel, fishes with a clean and pleasant bitterness, a decent ale."
"This beer is nothing like a traditional Christmas beer. I respect the brewery's right to call it anything they want, but they might as well have called it Crazy Cupid or Psychotic Bunny as Bad Elf. If you're in a holiday mood, drink a Troegs Mad Elf or any of the other spiced ales. If you want a respectable IPA no matter the season, reach for a Bad Elf."
"A rough pour brings up an inch thick head of frothy white foam that receeds to a shorter but denser, creamy layer in a few moments. The trade-off, however, is that it disturbs the yeast sediment and leaves it's golden-amber body somewhat hazy. Still, tiny bubbles are clearly visible climbing slowly towards the surface. What remains of the head leaves some nice lace about the glass, and overall, it's a very nice appearance. Hops are clear in the nose with a brightly citrus and piney character. It's bold, fresh, and inviting - the way a real ale should be! The body is medium; and it's very fine and natural (bottle conditioned), restrained carbonation is just lightly tingly on the tongue before fading away smooth. The flavor delivers the lemony-citrus and resiny spruce/pine-like hop flavors promised by the nose over a biscuity malt. A bold bitterness balances, and its fades away dry with a quick flash of juicy fruitiness followed by a residual note of bitterness in the aftertaste. Quite impressive!"
"Part #1 of the 12/8 Hebrew Hammer Holiday Threeway."
"I first tasted Bad Elf at a Christmas beer dinner at Max's on Broadway in Baltimore, MD. A participant (not I), known for his dislike of Cascade hops, groaned when he was told of the hop charge. He smiled when he tasted the beer."
"For you main-lining hopheads that thought the UK couldn't brew something to cure your hop-induced tremors. Find this."
"ng"
"Taste: English malt is the first gift of flavor to the tongue. Followed by a shower of minerals and floral, grassy hops. Dry mineral present came in the middle and one the end, very similiar to a true English cask ale. The last present is a slightly bitter, dry taste and clean finish. This present transports me to an English Pub during the holiday. A great escape and a great beer."
