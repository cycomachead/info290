"DATE REVIEWED: June 20, 2014... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint... OCCASION: O's/Yanks renewed, and Blatt is named new Cavs coach...APPEARANCE: light amber, effervescent body; creamy pure white head that stands firm; inviting with nice spiraling lacing... AROMA: sprucey with some citrus scents; a bit of grapefruit, apple, melon and otherwise, agreeable... PALATE: big, full-bodied presence that demands attention on the tongue and teeth; a pulsating aftertaste, almost an aftershock... TASTE: a well-balanced approach here,, with grapefruit,, apple, melon, mellow sweet malts and a bit of yeasty funk--a tasty balance... OVERALLL: a strong, memorable experience throughout, with enough punch and balance ti please the palate--a local brew delivers a winner...."

"I had this at an Irish pub in NJ. If this IPA is the best NJ has to offer, I don't think I ever want to try another beer from the state. This IPA tasted like hops mixed with vomit. Ok.... I might be a little too harsh here, but it was lacking severely. It's like an ingredient was left out. The potential was there, but never arrived. Almost like a sneeze that dies out right before it happens. Very disappointed with my choice, even more so since they had some fine Great Lakes beer on tap. STAY AWAY."

"O: easy to drink; balanced; nothing really exciting, but nothing really bad;"

"O - Just a really lame east coast style IPA"

"O- A real easy drinker. Nicely balanced. A good American example of the English style. Received as a sixer as a gift. Something I would buy if it were available."
"Overall - it's decent. I like a good amount of aroma and found that disappointing. Seems like a lot of cascade hops as well, which are a classic treat."

"Overall, the best thing about this beer was its flavoring. We had a bit of a shock when we first opened this beer, took a whiff, and sipped it because, generally speaking, it has that same luster of fresh hoppy goodness possessed by both Sucks and Heady Topper. Things were fruity, fresh, and confidently smooth, and it tasted just like it smelled. The hops throughout were thickly resinous and heady, with sticky oiliness that went on for days. That said, as the beer warmed, and with a second serving of it, it began to fade. The edges seemed just a bit cheaper, with more metallics and less smoothness to the sip. That said, we were transiently enhanced by this one, but it just didnâ€™t seem to possess that reproducibility and longevity that keeps you coming back to your favorite beers time and time again."

"Overall - I feel like the reviews on this beer are overly harsh, or perhaps the recipe was changed. Yes, it is definitely is a bread/butter IPA, nothing to interesting, lots of Cascade, but honestly, sometimes that's a good thing. It's a solid product, and I would probably buy it again. Great for introducing someone to a simple basic IPA."

"Overall - A light IPA, crisp citrus and refreshing. I am not seeing most of the same negative qualities on some of the older review, again I am guessing this is a reformulation attempt. I did notice that it is a little on the tart side, but otherwise this is a decent brew. Would not recommend this one to hop heads necessarily and if I did I would call the hops lemonade hops, not really my favorite style."
"O: Decent. Better than I expected, to be honest, given the reviews here and the reputation of this brewer. Maybe I got one that's uber-fresh (I'll check the bottle for dating info). I bought a single bottle at Price Chopper and doubt I'd buy a full sixer of this (there are so many IPAs that I like better than this), but I'm not unhappy with the purchase at all."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is probably a slight amount hoppier and more bitter than I expected in an English IPA but it is still enjoyable and pretty easy to drink. The flavors of the hops come through nicely and are not quite as subdued as some others in the style, Enjoyable and one I would likely order again."
""
""
""
"O: This beer seems a little hoppier and bitter compared to other English IPAs but has a nice amount of flavors of hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is almost what I would have expected. It's dominated by bready malts with a nice citrusy hop character. Unfortunately, it has an intense creamy, soapy, almost lactic off-flavor that ruins everything. This is definitely not a beer I ever want to have again."
""
""
""
"O - it's just ok."
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle. Pours hazy orange with a long lasting fluffy, white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy hops, biscuit malt pears and oranges. Body is medium and tangy. Citrusy hops, pale malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth. Long grapefruity finish. OK IPA."
""
""
"O: Please dont try this. I am reminded of one of my earlier home brews that was OK... for a homebrew..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not for hop-heads. Fairly sessionable ABV could fit in well at a barbecue."

"Overall: I was expecting a lot more, I am huge IPA fan and before getting to half glass this beer disappoints. I can't say I love it but I can't hate Cricket Hill for trying, Salud!"
"D - Wow, this is terrible. The hop character is almost non-existent except for a slightly harsh and fairly strong bitterness in the finish. It is equal parts odd and bad; and let me be clear here: I am not rating this poorly because it is an English IPA and I wanted an American IPA, I'm rating this low because it is a bad beer by any standard. If anything it tastes like a poorly conceived wheat beer."
"Overall: This is a strange beer. It would make a decent witbier but this one has little in hop character."
"Poured from bottle into glass- no bottle date visible. Pours a light orange/yellow color, pretty cloudy. Decent head, little retention. Smell- floral, tea leaves. Not what I like on my IPA's, but I guess to be expected for an English IPA. Taste- mild bitterness, some toffee, floral. Tea Leaves again. Bleh. All of this may be good for the style, but I really don't care for it. I'm going to plead ignorance for the style, not knock this beer too much for it, and move on to the next."
""

" This Ipa is semi-bitter with a floral hop taste and herbal tinge on first sip. The grassy astringent aspect comes toward the middle with a light toasted grain flavor in the background and mild citrusy acidic and light tropical accent. The semi bitter taste continues after the sweet balanced finish. Overall I found nothing to complain about, yet it is not a beer that is stellar in the realm of the style either. The taste and aroma are good, but nothing really sets this apart. There aren't really any apparent flaws it is just a good drinking beer with lots of bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""

"The flavor is a bit of a mess, with spicy yeast esters hitting the palate aggressively up front. Again, I'm reminded of a Belgian IPA (and not a good one at that). The hops provide enough tropical fruitness to save what is an otherwise unremarkable IPA. Malts are almost non-existent. The mouthfeel is a hot mess, with huge bubbles that loll across the palate. The beer finishes with a medicinal aftertaste. Not for me."
""
""
""
""
"Really not good at all. Not even remotely close to an IPA hop profile with off flavors and a thin mouthfeel to boot. It's a shame after how beautiful it looked."
""
""
""
"OK, NOTHING SPECIAL!"
"O: This isn't a terrible beer, but I wouldn't pick it up again unless I knew it was fresh."
""
""
""
""
"O - A very refreshing anytime beer!"
""
""
""
"I wouldn't consider this an IPA, it's closer to a Pale Ale. It actually tasted very similar to Appalachian Brewing Company's Mountain Lager, which is a completely different style of beer. There is nothing offensive about this brew, but there's nothing great about it either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one of those beers that doesn't try to do anything spectacular, but still manages to produce something drinkable."
""
"Picked up single bottle of this at a local store since I hadn't seen it in the state yet. I have to say, I was disappointed. Pours a quite hazy golden with very little head. What head there is does stick around as a light swirl and leaves some scant lacing. Light notes of citrus and paraffin in the nose, and not much else. Undercarbonated, and frankly, the beer seems unfinished with some raw wort notes of a sweet graininess and a bit of acrid bitterness. A tad grainy as well and generally it has flavors that can only be described as murky. There are some faint citrus flavors of lime and orange, but they're generally lost in the muddle. Meh."
"O: If you are going to call a beer an IPA you need to be able to smell and taste the hops. This was a far cry from an IPA. It was lacking lots of hop aroma and if I didn't know what style it was I would think I was drinking a light lager."
"Overall: Decent beer. Nothing I'd rave about."
"Final Thoughts: Very...interesting. I've been in the mood for a kind of funky beer, but I didn't expect it to be from a random IPA. The yeast on the bottom really changes this beer. The first time I had it I didn't realize it was bottle conditoned and it just tasted like a plain IPA. After that first, I realized it was BC, so this time I got at it and it changed the beer totally. I can't say I wouldn't buy this beer again, but I can say I will not buy it under the auspices of an IPA. A good post-post-lawn mower brew. One to have after that witbier, hef, or ipa you have after the lawn."
"This is a average tasting IPA. The flavor and aroma are on the bland side. Cricket Hill has so many better brews than this, like their: American Ale, Colonel Blides and their Shandy that they have only at the brewery. I wouldn't completely steer clear away from this IPA; I believe they're a lot better ones out there."
"O: If you are going to call a beer an IPA you need to be able to smell and taste the hops, this beer is lacking big time in the hop department. Its not a bad beer, if I were reviewing it as an English pale ale it would have gotten much higher marks but if they label it an IPA I will review it as such."
"I don't know how strong this is in the alcohol department but just like the taste, there's no punch to be packed in terms of the strength of this beer. It's not a bad choice for the summer and this would go great with Thai food but that's about all I envision for this beer. For the casual drinker, there are better and more memorable choices on the market. There's no doubt that this could use another dose of hops to up the ante."
"Pours a hazy yellow to orange-ish color with a small white head. In the aroma, sweet orange citrus. In the taste, orange citrus hops and quite sweet, with a lack of malt backing. A small hop bite and thin and lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry orange citrus in the aftertaste. Nice orange citrus, but sweet and lack of body and balance."
"Although this is not a strong IPA as some i have tried, it does have the same drawbacks and the rest of them. It had a hoppy smell and a stronger aftertaste then what im used to. Cricket Hill did do a good job with this beer, it is a shame that I did not prefer this beer"
"A good IPA, it just does not stand out."
"This beer was split from Cricket Hill's variety pack with a couple BAs at work. It poured a bright orange in color, very light, and very clear with a light off white head. It smelled of pale malt with a light orange twist. This beer literally just arrived but it smelled like a skunked Dortmunder. There was ZERO hop presence at all. This beer is definitely not an IPA, not even an English one. This beer has the hop profile of Miller Lite. It drank very light and thin. It didn't have any of the stickyness or dryness that you get from most IPAs. This beer was an awful interpretation of the style."
"Light orange with a fluffy eggshell cap that leaves some filmy lace on the glass. Herbal hop notes and sweet malt, pretty tame for any kind of IPA. White fleshed fruit and earthy hops with ample bitterness and minerality. Medium bodied and creamy. A decent tasting English style IPA and a nice lawnmower beer."
"Single, twelve-ounce bottle copped from Total Wine; overall, pretty good stuff; a light, satisfying IPA. Easy on the palate, not too pungent in aroma either. Hints of hops balanced with a mild backbone of malts evident. A local brewery comes good on this British depiction of a pale ale. Not bad."
"D: Very drinkable. If you're in a pub, and you see it on the hand pump, ask the bar keep to pour you one."
"Overall... I'm sorry. Its just somewhat below average for a craft beer."
"This beer has a few of the elements of a good ipa. The main thin that I felt that was missed was the big hoppy flavors. The color was on the copper side and fairly clear in color. The beer was just a little weak to me. Not the greatest IPA out there."
"D- First attempt at an English IPA. Interesting drink, but I'm still American, give me a regular IPA. Still a good drink though, just not my style."
"Overall, this is a smooth easy drinking brew. I am but unclear as to why it's called ""Hopnotica"" as it is definitely not that strong on the hops for an IPA. But, all the same, enjoyable and a beer I would drink again with a burger and fries."
"Overall this was a nice IPA. I have of course had better, and also had much, much worse, but this one will definitely work. I was surprised by the balance it posed, not simply relying on a ton of hops to push through the flavor. A really nice choice and a good call."
"This brewery is within 10 minutes of my house and yet this is the first bottle that I've bought. I had one of their beers on tap at Cloverleaf Tavern, but can't remember which. Their beers tend to be low in ABV and they claim to concentrate on flavor. If this is a concentrated effort then I'm a bit disappointed. It is good enough for me to seek out their other brews and give them a shot...a tour of the brewery is definitely in order due mostly to its proximity than the result of this offering."
"D: Pretty low ABV, but not as Hoppy or flavorful as I was expecting. Pretty average overall."
"Fairly easy to drink, if not for the utter blandness and lack of complexity, but I suppose that's the style."
"HV"
"D: Perfectly 'pub-like', a small-feeling IPA (ABV: unknown, but seems 4.5-5%) that's balanced and easy to drink. It's a bit of a misnomer to punnily call your beer 'Hopnotic' when there really isn't a big hop presence. Oh well, regardless of name this is a beer I like enough to have again."
"D: A little tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's a decent beer but there are others in the style that I would pick first."
"D - I guess it's not hard to drink, except you have to get past the bad taste."
"Very nicely balanced between hops and malt. Fits the English IPA profile quite well. Enjoyable."
"D: A pretty nice brew and really a nice representation of the English IPA. Not usually my cup of tea, but I have enjoyed each one of these from the 6-pack a little more than the last."
"Drinkable IPA. Tastes need to be more pronounced."
"This beer pours a georgous golden yellow orange color with a small 1 finger white head that leaves nice lacing down the glass. Really has no aroma. It's got a touch of bitter lemony cake on the nose but so faint. Really lacking, just a touch of sweetness that gives any aroma at all. No hops on the nose for me. Taste falls very flat. I really enjoy there limited release beers but this and the American ale really seem watered down and bland. Might have a touch of lemony woodiness with very light malt. Mouthfeel is again a touch flat as this brewery tends to be for me. The drinkability is high though despite the lack of flavor because it's very very smooth. It's been filtered to all he'll I believe which stole the hop bitterness I was looking for in an ipa. Worth a shot and I would take this over gmc products all day. Really the quintessential sports drinking beer."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a honey yellow with a slight white head, no lacing. The aroma is sweet and grassy. The taste follows the nose, the finish lingers with an appropriate amount of bitterness. Medium in body, average carbonation. IMO kind of sweet for an IPA, but it is nicely hopped and a solid brew."
"As a summer time beer I can warmly recommend this. While, for the most part, I do prefer richer, denser beer, for something on the milder, lighter side of the spectrum this is pretty good. While thin, flavors are clean and focused."
"Thanks to hopflop for this one! Served from bottle into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Pours a nice hazy yellow-orange with a minimal white head. Lacing was minimal throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt and subtle hop notes. The flavor was of subtle hops and malt. It had a medium feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this brew was very smooth for an IPA and is quite drinkable. If you enjoy IPAs with subtle flavors you owe it to yourself to try this one."
"Skol!"
"April 20, 2010 8:34pm, rocking soundboard Eyes of the World 11/13/73 on bose, clear spring skies, enough said....poured a clear mahogoney orange, very quickly disapating light head. Smell is a strange alcoholly/grapish mixture...in a agood way. First sip/first impression = this is the most poundable IPA I've ever had. Mouthfeel is that of a cool river downstream from choice hop factory. (---> China Doll btw). Hops are very tasty. Not overpowering by any means, but tasty in a kinda slow cooked way. Before reading the other reviews I'd assume that the knock will be it's lack of boldness, but I see that as a nice alternative to standard IPA's. Market this properly and you'd have a mainstream brew. (This song is too slow, fast forawrd --> Sugar Magnolia....much better). Anyway, yes, this is a well made lighter IPA. Perfectly balanced, tasty, drinkable and good looking. Sunshine daydream indeed."
"smells of sweet champagne and pours clear golden color with lots of carbonation looks nice. No pine or citrus like typical IPA's. taste is very mild. Toasted champagne flavors come through. it almost think they might have put the lager into an IpA bottle. not a bad beer but don't be fooled by the name this most certainly isn't an ipa."
"Overall - A good I[A for those who hate IPAs"
"Pours a pretty, clear orange with a large fluffy white head. The aroma is clean and citrusy, though not distinctive. Flavor, however, is not great. There is some light fruit, apricot and peach, with some delicate jasminy hop character. But there is a briny quality that overwhelms the beer - it is salty and a bit metallic. The mouthfeel is solid, dense and briny. Not so great."
"This is an easy-to-consume beer, best suited with food and casual situations."
"Drinkability: This is a workman like beer with nothing particularly outstanding or challenging in its character. It is a good session beer in that one can drink several of them at a sitting. Each sip leads easily onto the next and then the beer is gone. That being said there is no particular reason to seek out this beer or to have it again unless it is your local brew. Good but nothing outstanding. However it does match my expectations for an English style IPA intended to be easily drinkable and attractive to a local audience."
"Not really too much to get excited about here, and I had high hopes having spent my formative years in NJ."
"Thanks to caresville for the opportunity to try this brew. 12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured a translucent, light copper color with a slightly golden hue when backlit. Half inch fizzy white head slowly recedes into a broken skim - some strands of lacing evident during the tasting. Copious tiny bubble present in solution. Not much of a nose - light malt maybe. Taste - not really too IPAish. Malty, a little sweet, some citrus acidity, maybe a little bit of interplay of hops in there, but kind of like an APA. Mouthfeel is light and slightly prickly. Not really much of an IPA, but I could drink a couple. Just seems to be missing some of the qualities you look for in the style."
"poured from 12 oz bottle into a slender pils glass. pours a hazy orange to amber with some carbonation and decent sized white as cloud head. also some noticeable lacing is present. smell is mostly grass, hay, straw, with notes of oranges and faint hops. taste is surprisingly hoppy (i am saying this because of the faint hops smell) and crisp. notes of oranges, pears and grapefruit. not overly bitter, but it is there on the swallow. easily a great brew to throw down a few of, while doing yard work on a hot summer day."
"Pours a medium brown with a thin beige head. Nice lacing. Nose is quite grainy with some pale malts and grassy hops. Taste more like an English mild than IPA. Hops are quite mellow, as are the malts. Light body lacks carbonation and is thin in the finish. Not very impressed by this one."
"Overall a tasty and well balanced ale."
"D: Drink easy enough and probably has at least somewhat low ABV. Pretty good on style points. It's just not very tasty or interesting."
"Drinkability- Hop heads will enjoy this beer. Could be a touch more balanced, but still quite good."
"My first beer from NJ...not bad at all!!"
"Drinkability? Since I like English IPAs, I can say this is very easy to drink and very tasty. The abv isn't listed but I'd guess that it is under 6%. I could be wrong. Very good sessionable IPA in my book."
"Light to mediu bodied beer. Decent selection, but not my go to beer. Perhaps herea the bech it may become my goto beer."
"m/d - Light body. ends a little dry. A little sticky but seems reasonable. Really easy to drink, not sure on the ABV but seems low enough to session."
"This may not be everyone's cup of hops. Its much more of a subdued IPA than anyone jonesing for their hop fix may be looking for. This one makes me think of Fuggles IPA by Shipyard, another English-style IPA. I'll have to give their Jersey Summer Breakfast Ale a try next time I am down that way..."
"The feel is fizzy and decently bodied. It's a heavily-malted English-style IPA. The hops are but an accent. Not bad, but not exciting."
"Bottle. Pours a clear light orange with a very small white head. Aroma of sweet fruits, grapefruit, and light citrus. Flavor is mostly malty, with some melon and citrus too. Definitely not very hoppy, but it's still a pretty enjoyable beer. Easy to drink too."
"D: As IPAs go, this one is probably pretty average. Maybe a good starter for someone a little intimidated by bitter ales looking to try something new."
"On one hand, this is apparently supposed to be an English IPA. On the other hand, it doesn't say ""english"" on the label, plus it has a name like Hopnotic. So I think it's reasonable to expect some hoppiness. The color is a cloudy yellow with a minimal head. The smell is a bready yeasty smell. The taste is a yeasty breadish taste, with a fairly sweet malt component. Not much hops to speak of, though. Carbonation is about right. As a pale ale or maybe an amber, this would have gotten much higher marks. But even as an English IPA, it's sorely lacking in hop flavor. Still a drinkable brew, and enjoyable on its own merits, though."
"I might just pour this"
"Smells of oranges, all-spice, bananas, cream, and flowers. Well-rounded scent I'd say. Mouthfeel is crisp, yet creamy as it goes down. Flavor is of muted hop bitterness, finishing ever so slightly spicy. Nice malt balance on this one. If you were expecting a hop bomb, this is not it (as most of the reviewers apparently were). Remember, this is an English style, not American. And as an English IPA, this is spot on from my experience. It is perfectly blended with the hints of bitterness and malty sweetness. Recommend."
"The taste does have some bittering hop but it is leafy rather than oily or estery, and the sweet malt and bubble gum like candy flavored notes just shouldn't be there. The beer has a hop balanced with the malts, but the hop isn't dry enough for an English IPA, nor oily enough for a nouvelle American version of the same. There is just a leafy bitterness that isn't that special. The sweet malts, citrus, bubblegum in the background is just silly. This beer is okay, but Cricket Hill has a long way to go. There beer is very smooth and creamy."
"Poured a medium amber with a small head. Light citrus and floral aroma and tastes (neither over powering). I've had this on more than a few occasions, and each time I re-rate it, my numbers go down. Maybe I'll have to stop trying this one."
"ignoring the label, this is a fine beer. pours a orange hue with everlasting head. this is my favorite out of the sampler 12 pack from CricketHill. A hoppy beer you can drink a few of. this is what an IPA was 10 years ago before somebody decided to crank 120 IBU's in there beer and set the new IPA style."
"D: Ones enough, not enjoyable or flavorful enough to be a session or to justify a the cost of a six-pack."
"Overall it's a good beer, but fails as an IPA. Doesn't have the grassy, hoppy aroma that I've come to expect from other IPAs. Pours a cloudy pale yellow, small white head. Lightly citrus taste that lacks a hoppy punch. It's really not a bad beer, easy to drink and tastes good, but not a good IPA."
"Pours a golden yellow/orange with slight head that left minimal lacing. Slight citrus hop to the nose, leading to the same taste. Its not as hoppy as I had hoped but was just enough to leave me wanting more. This could easily be a nice session beer although its not remarkable."
"A traditional IPA- hoppy yet balanced. Not over the top like some IPAs have gone, but enough punch to let you know there's a good amount of hops in it. Nice color, nice hoppy nose, with a fairly malty backbone. You can have plenty of these without falling off your stool."
"A pretty good brew, not quite as hoppy as your typical IPA. It's very drinkable though."
"In the end, it's really nothing more than a session IPA. If you like your beers smelling like waffle cones and apple juice and tasting like grapefruit, then you really need to try this IPA."
"Body is mediumish with an average mouthfeel and less than average drinkability. No freshness date but it tastes past it's prime."
"I did not finish my 12oz bottle, it would be a waste of carbs."
"Pours a nice darker golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little one-finger creamy off-white head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing. The nose is mostly malts, but with a nice touch of hops, very slight citrus/pines, and some caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, nice little touch of hops, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, I like this one."
"D - Not a bad IPA, but nothing memorable. Perhaps a bit too malty for my tastes, but it is still tasty. Drinks a little more like a pale ale."
"New to the area, so I decided to give it a try. Pours a clear, copper color with minimal head that gives way quickly. Aroma is of weak grains and a very bitter and slightly metallic smell. Taste is of off tasting bitterness, slight citrus hop flavors, metallic notes, hop spices. Aftertaste is very metallic and off. Mouthfeel is very carbonated and light bodied. As far as drinkablity, I am going to have to muscle my way through this one pint. Their are tons of IPA's out there, and this one falls upon the lower rungs of the ladder, in my honest opinion."
"I like this beer more than I thought I would after the smell. At first, I found this beer to be relatively middle-of-the-road, but after each subsequent sip, it grows on me more and more."
"The sweetness in this beer makes it slightly more ""heavy"" I would still by no means call it heavy though. It finishes clean, and like the APA, sessions well."
"A golden colored beer with a decent citrusy smell.Taste is citrus with either honey or caramel,a good mixture for this beer.This beer holds it's taste from first to last sip.Definetly something I would buy and recommend.Makes me want to try more products from cricket hill."
"Don't drink and review."
"Overall, I found this offering from Cricket Hill to be a pretty good EIPA that is very drinkable, and that I grew fonder of over time."
"Poured a bottle of this out into a glass mug. Looked quite nice; amber body with a solid white head. Retention was very poor, but it slowed down to a decent lacing. The smell was slightly hoppy. The taste was decently hoppy, nothing too impressive. It definitely did not taste like an IPA; maybe an APA. The mouthfeel was nice a full-bodied like an IPA. The beer itself is pretty drinkable, even though I was not too impressed by this by this beer. I was expecting more hops in the taste, but they just were not there."
"drinkability is good. a touch sweet, but otherwise fairly balanced and enjoyable."
"I thought this was an English style IPA and research shows this to be the correct case. I think this is underated because people get a drier, pale plus hopped ale. This is somewhat leaf dry astringency and on the bitter side, it is malted to ease drinkability and nicely done.Lace and small head on orange."
"Nice beer. Well balanced."
"Had this brew at philly craft fest- wish i had heard of this brewery before- very nice E-IPA aromas, subtle citrusy hops with a malt backbone to back it up. The malts are slightly sweet with medium body, while the hops settle in on the end for a refreshing floral aftertaste. Not overly dry on the backend. Great flavors and mild taste make this a session IPA that will not destroy your palate."
"I may have had a different expectation going in when I ordered this one. Anything labeled Â“hopnoticÂ” would seem to imply being punched in the face with hops. Kind of a misnomer, but a good English IPA. I enjoyed it."
"2nd offering from this brewery. Somewhat hazy golden color. Nice sized head on top-decent carbonation level. Good grassy and citrusy aroma. Flavor does much to mirror the aroma-very nice. Quite grassy and grapefruit like. Not a full frontal hop assault but enough presence to make the whole package enjoyable. Some good lingering malt sweetness. Good body. Overall an enjoyable pale. I am suitably impressed for a brewery I have heard very little about. Nice job."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle I got from an in person trade with silks636 on a wedding trip to NJ. No freshness date on the bottle but it was fine. Appearance was good a nice pale hazy orange straw color. Nice fluffy white head that dissipated rather slowly. Nice lacing down the glass. Smells very floral with hints of citrus especially grapefruit scents. Slight malt hint in the back of the nose. Taste is very fresh, crisp and clean. Well carbonated with a nice flowing hop flavor. Milder hop bite but it builds as it goes down. Nice dry hop finish with many well constructed flavors. Nice aromatic IPA with good drinkability and taste. This is an enjoyable beer worth giving it a try if you like milder IPA's. Not a very overpowering hop flavor making it a very drinkable beer. I would consider drinking it quite often if I could find it near me. I would think it would make a decent all around everyday IPA."
"Slightly hazy peach juice with rocky snow-white head. Moderate and steady carbonation. Nice mild aromas of apricots and orange peels with a slight spruce sap scent lingering in the background amongst the faintest traces of sweet malts. Bitter orange flavors begin the sip, rounding out to a sharp mineral middle. Some crystal malt sweetness comes through near the finish, along with more citric hops, lending a fresh-squeezed orange juice quality to the final aspect of the flavor. Thin-to-medium body, overall juicy mouthfeel, somewhat sharp and off-dry. This really isn't a very ""complex"" IPA, but I think that's actually a very fine thing to be. Sometimes I don't want to be clobbered with astounding flavor profiles (and, of course, sometimes I really do!). It's refreshing to find a straightforward, solid-drinking IPA like this. I'm glad the nice folks at Oak Tree in South Plainfield, NJ, hipped me to this beer when they included a free Cricket Hill shaker pint with my last purchase (which I used to drink Hopnotic IPA, naturally). Anyway, this seems to be a pretty underrated beer, and it has my thorough recommendation."
"Cricket Hill's Hopnotic IPA is quality beer and is a more than credible version of the English IPA style. I could just as easily have granted the higher flavor score since I'm enjoying the bottom half of the bottle even more than the top half. What the hell. This is a well-brewed beer that is disappearing remarkably quickly. I thing I'll reward it accordingly."
"Overall seems to hit the English IPA target very well"
"It's pretty easy to drink, though the sweetness is a little to much for the style. Not one of the better IPA's out there, but might be okay as an intro to the style. It's a very mild IPA."
"Cloudy, honey golden pour with a head that dies on contact. Nose of hops and lemon. Tastes woody, with soome slight hops, but not really bitter at all. Totally does not fit the IPA mold. It runs down the gullet a little too smooth, no sprakly bite to pick things up a bit. Not an enjoyable beer."
"M & D: Mouthfeel and drinkability are both alright-not great, but just alright. Average more or less. Smooth and oily mouthfeel with not much aftertaste--malts are more lingering than hops. Carbonation is pretty good and not too pronounced. Drinkability is high as its an easy drinker. Pretty good, but there are better."
"I think I like the cricket better than the brews themselves, but this was a decent IPA. Had the necessary hoppy and citrus kicks with a fair amount of sweet malts, a decent frothy mouthfeel, and was very easy to drink. But it lacked depth for me. I'd love to have a sixer or two in the back of my fridge for everyday, thirst-quenching drinking, but I wouldn't order it if I went out. Still, nothing to frown at."
"12 ounce bottle. Cricket Hill IPA pours out a dirty looking orange brown color with a medium head. The aroma is fruity and herbal with just a hint of hops. The flavor starts out sweet and fruity, with lemons and peaches. Herbal, grassy flavors come in a the middle. This beer is not very hoppy at all. The mouthfeel is medium and there is a pleasant level of carbonation. A little buttery. Drinkability is average. Mediocre pale ale."
"Overall: Glad I tried this but don't know if/when I'll go for it again with the other great IPAs out there."
"This beer is really quite well balanced between the malt and the hops, it is almost more of a Pale Ale than anything. It is quite tasty though, and is definitely a good offering that I am happy to be drinking at this moment."
"amber bottle with bottled on date blank??. Poured a hazy medium amber color with slight white head. Smell is sweet and slightly fruity, totally lacking in hops. Smell is not very pleasnt at all, and each taste reminds me of it. Taste is very dry and bitter, with a low-level maltiness trying to break through. Finished th more dry bitterness. Not too good a beer. My first beer from ricket Hill and I'm very dissapointed."
"Easy to consume a whole lot of, and maybe a decent beer to introduce new micro beer drinkers to the style since the flavor is a little lacking (break them in). However, just boring IMO."
"A buttery flavor hangs around, making the mouthfeel slightly cloying and less then refreshing. Carbonation is a bit less than where I'd like to see it, making this one just average for me."
" I wont buy this one again."
"Overall- My 6 pack might be a little old, I don't know, but it has a slight skunky aroma. Otherwise the beer is an entry level IPA not very powerful. Perfect for your Budweiser buddies!!"
"12 ounce bottle I found in the cooler of the restaurant, Eccola Italian Bistro in Parsippany, NJ. The waitress originally said they had no microbrews but I saw the sixer in the cooler and asked again and got what I wanted!"
"I'd kick the hop flavouring up big time here and lay off on the malt a bit, but that's just me. Not bad (and far from great), but no where near what I was expecting."
"Beer poured up light amber to yellow with a frothy, white head. Nose is subtle and dry. This beer is billed as an IPA but I'm not really getting that. Hop flavor is very subtle. The after taste is a bit stale. This would be a worthy session beer but not much more than something to pound during the game. Would I reccomend this??? For $25 a case, probably."
"When in the area visit Cricket Hill"
"Very murky looking deep golden appearance. Thin bubbly white head that fails to leave much lace. The aroma seems more sweet than hoppy to me. Sweet bread type of sweetness. A little doughy on the nose. The flavor is sweet and spicy. Slighty bitter and not very hoppy at all. Sweet doughy tones dominate. And pepper yeastiness comes into play as well. Decent tasting beverage, but not what I would call an EIPA by any means."
"Although this beer is proclaimed as an English style IPA, it could just as easily pass as an American Pale Ale! It's slightly hazy, golden-orange body is capped by a frothy head of bright white; and bright, resinous, grassy, and citrusy hops (reminiscent of Nugget) greet you in the nose! In the mouth, it's medium bodied with a median carbonation level and fine bubbles that leave it smooth and gently creamy across the palate. The flavor is as might be suspected given the hoppy nose.... it's resinous, grassy, floral and mildly citrusy hops are interwoven throughout a blanket of bready and biscuity malt. The balance is impeccable, with hop and malt teetering back and forth over a solid support beam of bitterness! It finishes drying as a wave of it's hop-infused maltiness receeds to reveal the few sparkling gems of hop flavor still left on the palate. Quite drinkable!"
"Nice smooth, creamy mouthfeel that satisfies. Good carbonation. This could make a nice session brew, but it would need more hoppiness in there. Thanks to blitheringidiot for the hook up on this one."
"Beer is good. Happy local fresh beering."
"12 ouncer, pours very light and golden, minimal white head, quickly dissipates and leaves no lacing. Mild hop nose. Watery center, minimal grainy hop package. Malt for body and hops for flavor and complexity called for to lift this weak and lame ""IPA"" up to respectability. Not impressed, just slighly better then macro piss water."
"Pours with an average appearing white head settling over lightly haed bright golden toned liquid. Fruity and yeasty nose is replaced by lots of bitter smelling hops...perhapd some Amarillo & Cascades here. Some brief malt sweetness is washed away by lightly biscuity flavors then loads of hops. The hop bitterness is abundant and quite aggressive. The finish is long and bitter, with a fruity quality coming thru the hops at the tail end. This is for sure a hophead's quaffer."
"This poured out a clear golden yellow color with about 3 fingers worth of fluffy white foam. The head drops rapidly leaving some lacing about the glass as it does. Aroma is fairly mild with floral and earthy hops dominating and notes of citric hops are present as well. The taste seems fairly balanced with sweet malt being met by earth grassy hops blow for blow. A little too much emphasis on the malt in the taste but a pleasant mild taste now the less. The after taste is a bit dry and has a slight bitterness to it. The body is medium to light with a smooth creamy feel to it. This has decent drinkability with the mildness of it and nothing inherently flawed except the malt concentration. Not a bad beer but nothing to get excited over. Thanks for the brew Lupe and BIF 14."
"Licorice flavors appear towards the end along with an herbal presence. Really quite drinkable."
"Thanks Lupe and BIF 10 for this one."
"The mouthfeel is light - medium in body, with a smooth start and a long slighlty bitter finish. Drinkability is all right, but this IPA does not get the tastebuds hoppin'..."
"Leave off the label, and I would say this is a solid golden ale with an above average mouthfeel. Call this an IPA with a name like ""Hopnotic"" and in the summer of Smuttynose it seems to be a felony case of false advertising. Not a terrible beer, but not what it's made up to be."
