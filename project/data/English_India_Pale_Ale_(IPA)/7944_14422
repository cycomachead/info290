3.87,9,4,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Probably not a good way to start, but I bought this beer on clearance. $0.98 per bottle a couple months after Christmas.  Going to stock up after tasting it.  Bad Elf pours a very interesting orange color and smell and taste are both bright and floral.  I appreciate this IPA for being less hop and citrus and more spice and rose.  I found it quite interesting and fun to drink.  Perhaps it's the season getting ready to change, but the beer speaks more of springtime than Christmas to me, although I suppose the spice may come through nicely during the Holidays.  Overall a unique an easy drinking brew, loved it.","Foxybrau","Jan 30, 2015"

Lemony citrus highlights on the nose, with a rich malt character, as well. The beer's flavors are light at first, with a dry, peppery hopping on the tongue, followed by a more full, robust, roasted taste that leads to a slight, sweet, malt flavor. Light bodied, with no cling to the glassware. The palate ends up being very well blended, with a spicy and slightly citrusy aftertaste.

3.31,-6.8,4.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Taste is very much in the English IPA spectrum of heavy bittering on top of breaded yeasty malt. Although once again I find that the yeasts and hops seem shelf-degraded. I'll have to come back and modify this review should I ever get my hands on a fresher example. The florals notes have been dulled and made sparse, but one can tell that the bittering of the hops has been carefully balanced against the sweetness. Too bad that's all I'm left with in this somewhat chewy, medium bodied brew. IMHO, the body could stand to benefit from either being much heavier or much lighter, this middle ground doesn't play right across the tongue for the flavors it carries. Of course, it might be just perfectly bodied for the flavor profile of a fresh bottle, but I am forced to review with what I have.","WastingFreetime","Mar 15, 2011"

4,12.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Clear copper-yellow pour with big, fluffy two finger head with good retention and lacing. Hoppy, perfumy, floral nose with a malty backbone and hints of apples and caramel. Nice tangy, citrusy, bitter hop bite in the taste, well balanced by a sweet malty caramel base with a hint of apples and bubble gum. The mouthfeel is crisp and dry and slightly fizzy with a touch of chewiness. Slightly higher ABV then your typical English IPA, but you definitely can't tell. I'm thinking that some of the critical reviews were due to beer past its prime. This was extremely drinkable and enjoyable. It was closer to an American IPA then I had expected.

It also have very low hops aroma as expected in an IPA.l The same can be said for the taste, it has a hint of spices and low hops flavor.

It's really hard to tell with the butter. Mouthfeel is creamy and a bit gross.

This 1 pint .9 fl oz was pretty pricey at almost $5 at a local store in Short Hills, but I didn't recognize the label or brewery, so I wanted to give it a try... all in all, an excellent IPA that really stood out due to its pure and fresh flavor... definitely better than the average depiction of the style...

A definite hop presence in the nose, and the taste was at first malt then a definitive hop flavor that stopped just short of overpowering. A very fresh tasting, smooth, drinkable IPA.

The taste is similar to the aromaÂ…serious citric hoppiness with a faint undertone of malt. ItÂ’s a little grainy, fairly dry, and decently carbonated. ItÂ’s refreshing and cleansing, to be sure, but I thought that this one could have been helped by a little more sweetness and balance. ItÂ’s drinkable and worth a glass.

3.78,6.5,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"The taste is fairly dry with a nice sharp, almost biting bitterness that carries through to the end. The hop flavor is a mix of herbal, perhaps even grassy, and lemon like citrus notes. There is a touch of malt sweetness that sneaks in to the middle of this beer; it accentuates the citrus character a bit and provides some balance to the hop notes. This has a nice heft to it, that is not too light and yet not so heavy that this is not quaffable. This beer tastes quite similar to what I would describe as an American brewed English style IPA. Restrained crystal malt character with lots of hop character. As the beer warms up the simple grain sweetness picks up a bit and this in turn accentuates the citrus notes a bit; even picks up some notes of orange. This is definitely quite enjoyable.","Gueuzedude","Nov 29, 2005"

3.92,10.4,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours with a small-bubbled, bone-white head about a finger deep that slowly recedes to less than half a finger but regains some life with a good swirl. No cling to the lace; there are a few streamers. The beer is translucent amber-to-gold, but really kind of ordinary-looking. Smells of fruity, primarily lemony/citric hops; deeper down (brought out by agitation) there are almost tropical fruitnesses--papaya/mango? and sour apple. Nosefeel is leafy, long, and high. Taste begins with an element of sweet, tangy fruit (definitely mango now) overtaken by an emergent, rolling bitterness that ends up very smart on the midpalate. Here, the hops get herbaceous: fruitiness is by now powerfully displaced by a basil-bordering-on-rosemary, sharp herbal quality. Pretty well balanced; sustainedly bitter. Mouthfeel is somewhat foamy at the roof of the mouth; the rest of the body thinnish; light resins pucker the mouth for a few good moments. Wow, that bitterness just really has me coming back in the drinkability dept... invigoratingly refreshing! Personally, I find this brew's flavor and character more in fitting with the celebration of spring's thaw than for stretching out next to the fireplace in winter... but I still found this quite enjoyable.

You'd guess it was from the West Coast USA if you didn't know better. The hop flavors are pungent and somewhat raw....bitter and piney...smoky and cannabis like...resiny and ctitc. Damn, this is pretty good. The malt backing proves to be more than capable and is toffee based. Body is a little better than medium and this beer flows over the tongue with ease. The one negative is the price tag...5.39 for 16.9 oz. It's good, but I can find IPAs from this country just as good for lesser $$$$. Glad I tried it once though.","Bighuge","Dec 23, 2003"

The trade-off, however, is that it disturbs the yeast sediment and leaves it's golden-amber body somewhat hazy. Still, tiny bubbles are clearly visible climbing slowly towards the surface. What remains of the head leaves some nice lace about the glass, and overall, it's a very nice appearance. Hops are clear in the nose with a brightly citrus and piney character. It's bold, fresh, and inviting - the way a real ale should be! The body is medium; and it's very fine and natural (bottle conditioned), restrained carbonation is just lightly tingly on the tongue before fading away smooth. The flavor delivers the lemony-citrus and resiny spruce/pine-like hop flavors promised by the nose over a biscuity malt. A bold bitterness balances, and its fades away dry with a quick flash of juicy fruitiness followed by a residual note of bitterness in the aftertaste. Quite impressive!","NeroFiddled","Beers"
