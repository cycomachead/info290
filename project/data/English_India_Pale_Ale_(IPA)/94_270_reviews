"Nice unfiltered IPA with plenty of hops and none of that bitter finish. Good hot-day-drinking beer."
""
"One of the best IPAs around if just looking to pick up something that is not hard to find... but really tasty... with a flair of citrus... and very drinkable at under 7%. Solid IPA at a really good price."
""
""
""
""
"O: I would consider this on the milder side of an IPA.  Not too strong in hops, and very minimal on the malt. The look is not that appealing to me but I gave it leeway since it is unfiltered.  I would drink this again in spring and summer, specifically for the orangey/citrusy flavor."
"Drinkable, smooth but with a sharp hoppy kick. Great color and head."
""
"Coming it at 6% ABV and about 40 IBU's, this is a good IPA for those who may say they don't like IPA's."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: it's not too great but not too bad. It's easily session able but lacks some ipa flavors I look for. It's a little empty in flavor and the smell is really nothing to get excited about. Maybe more of an apa than an ipa. Good for people trying to get into an ipa or those that don't like resiny hop flavors"
""
"Very tame, easy drinking ipa. A good place to start for those new to hoppier styles."
"Not too hoppy for a hop-phobic. This relatively weak (for my latest taste standards) beer was a wonderful treat to alternate with Long Trail's much harsher ""Double Bag"". It offered a nice aroma and full flavor, and was even bearable un-chilled. Wish it was stronger, but I reccomend it just the same."

"Pours hazy orange with small white head, smells citrusy and piney, tastes of citrusy hops with a malt finish and creamy feel, average ipa."
"Poured from bottle into snifter. Pours an orange color with minimal head and decent lacing. The aroma is of bread and hints of Apple. The taste is of citrus, most notably grapefruit, at first and then finishes off with a slight malt taste. The mouthfeel is okay with just a little too much carbonation, but the consistency is alright. Overall nothing id get again. 3.25/5"
""
""
"Lacks depth. Not very well-balanced."
""
"Looks like there's a lot of sediment floating around. Pale, golden color. Smells slightly hoppy. Tastes less average than most IPA's. Bitter tasting..no real hints of anything else besides some hops. Not very pleasant on the tongue. Thin and carbonated. Maybe I just got a bad one, but it doesn't taste like it ""went bad"". Not a lot of flavor here, at least for my taste and the aroma wasn't anything special. At an ABV of 6, I'll pass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall meh, nothing too special, hops are just OK, malts are a bit too much, although fairly balanced and drinkable."
"A decent IPA. Aroma and look lacks the excitement that most really good IPA's deliver. Taste is ok, but leaves me wanting a little more hops and citrus. Ok brew!!"

"sort of shocked i havent reviewed this one before, but real cool they are doing it in cans now. a twelver of these is a nice buy anytime, and maybe the beer is even better in this format. they call it an english style, but its definitely not over balanced by grain, and it definitely doesnt have a ton of english yeast character to it. for me its a nice fluffy bodied juicy hopped ipa, with tons of hops but only minimal bitterness. the kind of hoppy beer you want to drink on a hoppy beer hangover. that sounds bad, but its true, so cold and refreshing right from the can, a beer that is appealing anytime, and i think the world needs more of those. the hops are west coasty in nature, not overly oily, but prominently pine forward, with a fresh squeezed character to them. clean in the finish though, maybe the most refreshing english style ipa on the planet. good for long trail for making this one in a twelve pack of cans, it could be the best beer in that medium going right now. if i lived back home i would be crushing these this winter."
""
"Overall, while I wasn't crazy about the taste, the other positive elements of this IPA give it a better than average rating in my book."

"Light-amber pour. Cloudy and slippery mouthfeel like all Long Trails. Decent head at first, then persistent but thin white lacing. Well-carbonated. Straight up hop profile (cascade I think), lingering bitter finish. Could be less sweet, even hoppier. But still very enjoyable."

"Once again, somebody filled a craft CAN to the brim, giving me a little spritz on the Crack! I went with an inverted Glug, especially since it is unfiltered and may need some rousing. This is precisely what #TheOldLady hates, but it did not say to pour gently. It settled into two-plus fingers of dense, eggshell-white head with great retention. What a difference from the earlier Saisons! Color was a cloudy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5). Nose smelled like the pine trees along The Long Trail! This really acted more like a bridge beetween an EIPA and an AIPA, but if you think that I am CANplaining, your are mistaken. Mouthfeel was medium. As it turns out, those were mostly aroma hops, so that the taste, while on the upper end of bitterness for an EIPA, was still more malty than hoppy. This made a nice segue from the Saisons and other Belgian-style beers earlier today into the hopped up beers that are on-deck. Finish was semi-dry with the hops ultimately winning out over the malts, but not by much. At 48 IBUs, this was not going to wreck anybody's palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very well balanced brew. The hops in this IPA are not overwhelming and add a very nice refreshing clean taste. The color is a lighter and the aroma is not bold but it is distinctive. The lacing left on the glass was beautiful. A good beer that is well worth your time."
""
""
""
""
"True to its claims, it is unfiltered, cloudy and orangey, with a soapy white head and lacing. The aroma is mild, with light citrus and bread notes. The taste is equally mild, with an additional earthy flavor on the finish. There is a fair bit of carbonation on the palate and it is a little thinner. A good not great IPA."

"Overall: Either the recipe has changed or there are a lot of old bottles out there but this beer is surprisingly good when fresh; I wouldn't spin it as an English IPA given the flavor of the hops in my sample but it definitely leans toward the East Coast with the balance factor"

"Overall: Solid IPA from the always reliable Long Trail. I paired this with some BBQ tofu, baked beans and potato salad and it worked perfectly. Is there such a thing as a ""picnic IPA""? If so, this is it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My first time trying an unfiltered English IPA so will have to try others to compare as I liked the fruit and citrus notes but not enough hop bitterness. Probably wouldn't buy this again and will stick with their limbo ipa."
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a huge bubbly off white head that persists forever. Smells of bread citrus and light caramel with a hint of fruity esters. Flavor is quite malty for an IPA with huge bread and caramel notes offset with just enough earthy hops to keep it from being too sweet. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet somewhat chalky mouthfeel. Middle of the road, old school, English inspired pale ale."

"this is a great beer. its super clean and well balanced. and with the right glass, has some terrific citrusy aromas. I can drink several and not be hammered so I think it falls under the session category and beats out all of its competition, especially for its price"

"Served very cold in a pint glass. Was a cold room and hard to evoke a scent from the brew. However, was poignant and a nice bit of bitter. Color was deep golden and transparent. Was the third of a set of beers at the Keg Room in NYC, and was the most enjoyable of the bunch. Will try again when the weather warms up a bit more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I poured this beer from the bottle into a traditional pint glass. The beer poured like most unfiltered IPA's with a dark copper like color with little head. The beer has a nice citrus smell that is mild. The hops are aggressively forward, as expected. Strikingly similar to the IPA of Yards. I enjoyed this beer a lot. I tend to like the English IPA's more than the standard American ones i've drank so i might be overly generous."
""
""
""
"Just got back from a ski trip to Stowe, Vermont, and picked up a six pack for the long-drive home. Good, not too hoppy taste, and nice amber color. Not much smell, but the taste and look made up for it. A very enjoyable beer. Need to go back to Stowe for an excuse to buy more."
""
""
""
""
"Not the most typical of IPAs, but still holds up, and it doesn't hurt that it's a little cheaper than lots of craft brews."

"This is my third offering from Long Trail. Had this out of the bottle. Very standard IPA, if anything, a little weak on the hops. I typically don't factor price into ratings, but Long Trail at the very least is a pretty decent value. Give it a try, but probably won't knock your socks off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a straw colored body with opaqueness similar to a hefeweizen. Decent head, nice lacing. Scents of faint grapefruit and a bit of pine but harder to detect than most IPA's. Very smooth and full malts complimented by a bit of hoppy bitterness. A little bit of an ""english"" IPA, not overly hoppy, which is good once in a while. You can actually taste something other than hops. Very smooth, clean, crisp and easy to drink. Medium bodied with a bit of chewiness. Another, not spectacular, but GOOD beer from Long Trail!"

"Bought at the store in Winooski. This is probably the first unfiltered ipa I've had. The sediment seemed slightly off-putting but I got over it when I took a sip. It's got a bit of citrus flavor with an earthy base. The finish is a tad dry. I'd probably have another."
""
""
"Excellent beer, best served slightly chilled, not real cold. Strong, hoppy taste, but it doesn't overwhelm the the other flavors. Great change of pace beer when you've hit the beer blah's. Aftertaste doesn't linger as the second beer tastes as good as the first."

"I sampled this beer, after drinking half of an Oktoberfest, and on first taste, I knew I needed to drink it on an ""empty"" palate. I bought a single bottle of it today and I will be putting this IPA on my ""yes"" list. When you first get a whiff of its aroma, you get a strong scent of pine and a lesser scent of fruit. I was quite leery of it upon smell, but quickly changed my mind after taking the first sip. It is not overpowering in the hoppy sense, but is nicely juxtaposed with an ever-so-light touch of citrus. This will become a favorite of mine, and will entice those generally opposed to IPAs to think differently and perhaps become a fan."

"Overall, I would recommend Longtrail IPA to anyone that likes IPA’s and are on a budget. I would say it is a really good IPA especially for beginners in craft beer. I really did enjoy this beer and I would order it at a bar, especially if it were fresh! CHEERS!"

"Decent enough IPA, perhaps close to a session IPA, but there is too much competition at this price point and this quality, especially in this area (Northeast). On par with basic Harpoon IPA and I actually prefer Harpoon. Your mileage may vary."

"A clear golden orange in color with a thin offwhite head. Aromas of fresh honey and citrus rind. Taste is a perfumy sweet flower flavor up front, then some water cracker, then a lemony, minty hop finish. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a nice ipa that I would get again."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is a well balanced malt hop mix with a faint buttery aftertaste. Nothing too exciting going on, but enjoyable. Mild lingering bitterness. Overall a pretty decent offering but nothing I'd go out of my way to order again. Would prefer more hop flavor."

"Pured into tulip glass. Nice hazy yellow,amber color. Two inch white foam head. Reduced to lacing. Sticky on glass.Fruity pine hops, little bite to the carbonation. Really good IPA. I would get this one again. Makes me want to eat seafood.. Give this one a try"

"(I bought this at a small package store that keeps all its beer refrigerated). The distinctive taste of this beer is its pine flavor, one of the few on the market that has not moved toward a pronounced citrus flavor. The beer is malty but the high ibu's and the pineniness give it a distinctive dry character that is great with Stilton cheese. I've also had this on draft and would rate it equally highly."

"O: I thought this was a pretty good English India Pale Ale. Looks really nice, has a nose that improves as it warms, and has a really smooth mouthfeel."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a pale, clear, goldenrod coloring with only a hint of sparse film on top. Aromas of cut grass, a subtle bitterness, and a light citrus blend. The nose is mild, overall. Flavors are a bit on the roasted side initially, but then the cedar themed hops come through, with some pepper and oregano spicing on the lateral tongue. Resiny and bitter, there is a hint of citrus blending that highlights throughout. The aftertaste is more of the bitter, resiny, oily hops, with a very green feel overall. Surprisingly quick finish, with a sharp charring and slightly drying feel. Bitter linger in the back of the throat. Decent brew, and light on the ABV compared to most IPAs, so this one won't get you in trouble as fast."
"Not bad, but really nothing to write home about."

"I have drank many an IPA, and I have to say If you're planning on having more than six IPA's... THIS is the beer to choose! I drank like, 7 without noticing! So good! The lacing is perfectamundo, and the head and body are perfectly to my liking. Seriously, get some of this stuff. My favorite beer is Stone Ruination IPA, and this beer semi-reminds me of it, as well as camping out in the Green Mnts. Goodtimes. Goodbeer."
""
"Overall even for English IPA nothing too impressive, but still a beer that's enjoyable, I could have this again."
""
""
"Nice hazy golden orange color. Decent head of thickish suds only piles up to about 1/2 inch even after an aggressive pour. Nose is dull. Faint smell of hops and fruit. Taste is not overly hopped but very bitter aftertaste lingers for a long (trail) time. As the beer warms is has a medicinal, cherry like flavor reminiscent of Shipyard IPA. I remember liking this a lot more in the past. It was always a great bargain at ten bucks a twelve pack. Obviously batch control is an issue and I would be hard pressed to purchase this again with so many better local IPA's to choose from."
"Does nothing outstanding but it doesn't do anything wrong either."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall a very solid ipa, could be considered a stronger pale ale in some regards as the bitterness and hop presence is a bit light."
"Overall just okay nothing special here."

"A nicely balanced IPA. Not overdone on the hops and the feel really makes it."

"This beer pours a slightly hazy golden amber color. There is about a finger of white head resting on-tap. It has decent head retention, and there is some scattered lace left behind on the glass. The nose has some caramel maltiness and a nice hop presence. There are some aromas of tropical fruit and citrus here as well. The taste pretty much follows the nose. It starts off with some caramel malt and a nice citrusy and piney hop bite. There are some tropical fruit flavors that come through as well. The finish leaves some lingering sweetness and hop bitterness behind on the palate. This has a lighter medium body and average carbonation. It goes down easy and has a pretty good feel to it. There is some sweetness, and the hop bitterness is there, but a little on the lower side. This has good drinkability. It has nice flavor and goes down smooth. It is a little light on the hoppy side of things, but it is a pretty nice IPA overall. I think it is worth trying out, I'd drink it again."

""
""
"O: A good beer. I wish I saw more unfiltered IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not the most fruit hoppy IPA, but a very well balanced easy drinking brew here. This is a very good sessionable brew. A nice change in the hop profile from the typical IPAs brewed in the states. A case worthy IPA and at this price point I could easily see this being in my typical case rotation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not a bad ipa. i would definitely drink this often. not too much to make me not want another, and not dry to make me choose something else. a good refreshing IPA. definatly needs more carbonation"
""
""
""
"Overall man long trail whats with all the numbers? If you just made it ""072011"" I would have known the date and would have found it fresher. Not bad old though..."
"Super clean and well blended flavors. Very nice change of pace from those super fruity american ipas."

"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 091511. Pours a cloudy brownish amber color with very little head. Good amount ofof lacing. Aroma is bready with some pine and apricots. Taste is a bit bready with some nice pine and floral hops. Slight amount of apricot maybe but more floral than the nose. Decent mouthfeel. Bitter at the end. Oily. Overall it is a pretty decent beer to have in a mix 12 pack and I would look for this on its own or on tap."

"O: delicious IPA, great paring of hops and malts and great balance. Definitely a go to and its available just about everywhere."
"O: Another really solid offering from Long Trail. I really like this brewery and they didi a nice job with this IPA"
"Overall this is a very good IPA. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys a good and simple IPA."
"This is my favorite IPA. Pine hoppy smell (and taste) right out of the gate. It feels a little watery but the taste and the super clean finish really help this. As hard as I try, I just cant make a head appear on the golden colored beer. There is no real carbonation, and that is this beers downfall. All that said, its one of my favorites. I just expect more out of my favorite brewery."
"o: It's easy to have 4 or 5 of these in rapid succession. I think it'd go well with a steak or burger. Enjoyable beer."
"Notes: Some more carbonation would go a long way here."
"O-The nose was fine but it was down hill from there. It needed some flavor in the taste, either citrus or grassy/earth tones. Both were present but not enough to make a flavorful beer."
"O: Not all that bad but the IPA is a little stronger then I like"
"O- real nice english/""east coast"" ipa"
"Overall, I think I would greatly prefer to spend an extra 53 cents per six pack to get the Mission Street IPA at Trader Joe's as my usual dinner-time beer. Too bad they are 30 minutes away."
"I can't exactly say this beer was a great IPA. It would actually make a better attempt at the Belgian style. Even though the bitterness is high, I still can't associate this beer with the IPA style. I have enjoyed everything from Long Trail so far, but his beer just doesn't do it for me. I think they either tried too hard, or got their batches mixed up. Be sure to try it and see what you think."
"Having this on draft at the brewery I think helped me appreciate this beer a bit more. It’s got a fresh English hop bill with a bit of an edge to it, yet still stays nice and approachable. This would be a good starter IPA to introduce someone to. I’m going to be giving this one a second look down the road."
"But, for tonight, I'm psyched, and recommending it to the peeps!"
"This IPA definitely stands up to a lot of the popular IPAs up there and it has a nice bitter hop bite to it as well. The unfiltered quality to this beer definitely adds to the flavor and I think if it was filtered would be a bit watery and not as much as hop flavor. The mouthfeel is saved by it being unfiltered cause it kinda has a thin body to it. This is one of the best sessionable IPA's out there in my opinion and definitely worth 7.49 a 6 pack."
"Nice middle of the road IPA, not among the top tier but definitely firmly in the second class. Aroma and appearance are right on for an AIPA. Taste is balanced, with medium hoppiness and floral/citrus notes. Subtle maltiness. Nothing breathtaking or particularly vivid but not bad either. Medium carbonation, modest finish without lingering bitterness. Very drinkable, alcohol is muted. Pretty typical for an east coast IPA overall. You could do better pretty easily but you could do worse too."
"A cloudy orange/copper with about a finger of foamy white head. Good retention. Aroma is malty sweet and orange citrus. A lot of fruit. Taste follows the fruity nose. Grapefruit and tangerine/orange. A light but sweet malt background and a bitterness that is strong but finishes quickly. Crisp and refreshing. A light body with good hop character."
"Hazy golden-apricot colour, thin soapy head quickly recedes to a fine film and ring. Floral, citrus hops in the aroma, which is nice and juicy. In terms of taste, a light amount of caramel malt provides some sweetness to help balance the light hoppiness which is citrusy and floral in character. Very light bitterness, and also shows some yeasty character. Medium-bodied and carbed, I enjoyed a few of these while in Burlington for the weekend, but not sure I would actively seek this out. Also, I don't quite understand the classification as an EIPA."
"Long Trail IPA pours a hazy golden color with minimal lacing and a quarter-inch head. A soapy film lingers. There is a faint lemon and hoppy scent here. A crisp and light citrus taste, with no hoppy bite, but the presence is there. More of a malty than hoppy aftertaste too which is surprising. A good session IPA and a quality Long Trail brew."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are nicely balanced and smooth, if not just a bit bland. The aroma was quite subtle and could have had a bit more punch."
"O - I liked this brew well-enough but there are many other IPAs I'd rather have."
"This IPA pours out as a golden yellow color with a decent head at first. The white fizzy head becomes a thin white line across the top of the brew. The smell is lightly hoppy, you can tell that it's going to be an IPA by the aroma it has. The taste has a decent hop kick at first that changes into some malt flavors with some dryness in the aftertaste. Overall Long Trail puts out decent beers. They're worth trying so you can get the picture of what they do there. This beer is t bad. I would drink it again."
"Pretty standard English IPA. Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow with a finger of well-retaining head. Piney hops in the aroma with some citrus notes. Citrus and pine in the taste with a sugary sweetness coming through; very light malts. Finishes a bit dry with some bitterness. Light-medium mouthfeel and average drinkability."
"D: this is my first EIPA review and i am enjoying this style thoroughly. it's nice to have a typically very mild style (EPA's) beefed up. good shit long trail."
"O - One of Long Trail's better offerings. A solid beer."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are good. I would consider this to be one of the better session beers. A very nice example of an English IPA. Definitely worth a try."
"A very drinkable beer that can be drank all night. Very refreshing and could easily be drank during the summer. Better than those summer ales."
"This is a very easy to drink beer, it has good flavor and is very refreshing."
"Light hazy orange with dissipating white head. Weak aroma of grass and lemons. Tastes of grass, mint, slight citrus/lemon, hop leaves, bitterness, and then dryness that makes you thirst and lemon skins to finish the drink. Light in body with light carbonation. A sessionable IPA with great dry characteristics."
"O: a good beer but one I would pass up given a moderate choice of other brews."
"Pours a nice very creamy one and half finger creamy white head. Smells very floral, earthy, cedar wood. Tastes lemony, earthy, floral (lavender), earthy. Very coating mouthfeel, oily, medium bodied, finishes powdery dry. Medium carbonation. I could drink only a few of these in a sitting. The dryness is a bit much for me. $1.50 a single at whole foods."
"D: This beer is very easy to drink and is also quite sessionable."
"D: I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this beer -- crisp and fresh hops flavors don't exactly punch you in the mouth but settle effortlessly for an enjoyable ride down the IPA trail. It's nothing world-beating, but a very solid IPA."
"It turned out to be a bit stronger in the alcohol department than I envisioned but I could have easily ha another one of these in a sitting. The wheat gives it a good touch and I could easily see myself having more of this when the weather warms up a bit more. This is a good east coast IPA and a nice change from the others I've had that blend into each other after a while. Worth a try for hopheads!"
"O - A drinkable, almost sessionable EIPA. A great represntation of the style. Tasty, and a breath of fresh air from the ""Bigger-Younger Brother"" American IPA's."
"Overall, a pretty average IPA. I like the brewery and other brews they make. This was just disappointing compared to those. Very eary drinking if others aren't available."
"A more subdued take on the IPA that keeps the hops from monopolizing the taste (which I actually enjoyed). A nice beer from Long Trail."
"D- I was torn on this one. On one hand it is unique with it's blend of floral hops and spicy notes while being easy drink all the while. On the other hand it's not quite what I look for in an IPA. It was left wanting more because I was in the mood for an IPA. That being said it is a good tasting beer, just not a typical IPA. On the IPA scale I give it a C+. The overall beer taste is a solid B. Together that makes it a B- in my book. An IPA for non IPA fans."
"(from notes - tasted Sept 2010)"
"D/M: slight carbonation tingle, smooth on the pallet, lingering citrus notes, nice drinking brew"
"The nose detects some faint whiff of tangerine, or something citrical; the palate perceives aubtle malt that finishes in a sweet fade followed by a wet bread washout. It does have a fine balance and could go down as a very easy sessional quaff. Not much else going on here. Next!"
"The clearest ""unfiltered"" beer I have ever enjoyed, however with uniformly large suspended solids?! Wonderful hop nose, but overly sweet taste which doesn't complement the bitter finish. Not a well balanced beer, but shows promise and certainly a pint I'd give another chance..."
"The beer did seem that it was slightly off I must have another and come back to my review"
"the only caveat was the mouthfeel part that was flattened a bit compared to other IPA's but I think if you considered that this is an unfiltered IPA resembling a wheat then you will find this an excellent beer."
"I'm really not too impressed with this offering though. I think that it's probably the yeast that I dumped in my pint glass so I'll have to try it again to make sure."
"Poured into a pint glass. The pour is a moderate amber color with a white head. The nose is really plain with a bit of bready malt as well as some very faint citrus hops. The taste brings some very, very mild grapefruit flavor and a bit of grain. Feel has a decent body but no indication that this is an EIPA. A decent beer but not up to par with better versions of the style."
"Pours golden-orange with a small, short lived, white head and lovely carbonation. Yeast settles on the bottom of the bottle. Aroma is of citrus hops balanced by biscuit malt. Citrusy hops and grapefruit dominate the flavor with biscuit malt provide good balance. Long, hoppy, dry finish. Nicely made IPA."
"Drinkability- A nice IPA not as in your face as Siera Nevada, more along the lines of Harpoon with a different hops flavor. Very easy to drink, love it!!!"
"Because this is a mild IPA that doesn't taste terrible, I would say the drinkability is fairly high. Nothing crazy awesome about it, but nothing crazy bad either."
"D - Very simple, enjoyable IPA. Would definitely recommend it."
"pretty drinkable, but there are much better ipa choices for the price. some ipas benefit from being unfiltered, but i think this would actually improve if it was filtered. also maybe some more late hop additions for more of a hop flavor would be nice. i wont buy this again."
"All right folks let me get right down to the nitty gritty of this terrible beer. Its smells bad, but it gets worse from there, it taste like they brewed right out of some India pond water mixed with 200 proof rubbing alcohol, it burns in your mouth, its that bad folks."
"D - Very refreshing beer and would be great to session. I will certainly grab some my next trip to the Northeast."
"D: Although a good example of the style, probably not the most exciting beer; I could probably have a couple, but after that, would want to move on to something else."
"D: A nice English IPA, although nothing is overpower, they flavors blend well which makes this easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel is average; there is average carbonation and a light body that leaves your mouth feeling wet (as opposed to a dry finish). Overall, there doesn't seem to be much to this beer (especially compared to Long Trail's DIPA which is a real winner in my opinion); I've had much better examples of the style."
"This would be a great session beer."
"I don't mind this beer because it doesn't pretend to be a flavor bomb. Its light and fairly enjoyable. Real easy drinking when its hot out."
"D-this is OK, but there are too many other great IPA's out there...why bother...."
"D- I'll have another please ! Good stuff, especially at $12.99 a 12-pack. A very enjoyable IPA. I'd have a few of these in the sun relaxing. But with food, I'd want something with a bit more bite."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle marked: 011309-797911. Sampled on July 29, 2010.The pour was a straw-yellow color with a thin fizzy, carbonated head. The aroma had a stronger malt note than hops but it was also a bit skunky. The look and smell reminded me more of a macro pale lager. The taste was a tick better with a more malty sensation but little in the way of hops. Long Trail usually satisfies my beer thirst but based on the other reviews I have read I had to have had a bad bottle because this really had no IPA feel to it at all. I hate to admit it but it tasted more like Colt 45 or OE800 although not quite as biting."
"Very cloudy for an IPA, pours an orange/yellow color with a decent head that quickly backs down, but doesn't recede completely. Decent lacing as well. Not as much head as most IPAs, but still acceptable. Faint smell of hops and slightly fruity though no smells are particularly potent. So far so good. Unfortunately, the taste is where this starts to fall apart. Again, weak on the hops although oddly still bitter despite this. Perhaps there is not enough balancing with malts going on, but it's hard to tell. It does feel nice swirling around though. Overall, I wouldn't say this is very drinkable for me as the beer seems to be only bitter with not much else going on. What impresses me about many IPAs is the ability to pound you over the head with hops while balancing it out in some way so that it's not unpleasant. This is unpleasant with no balancing and not even that much hop flavor."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full with a buttery quality: drinks bigger than 5.9% alcohol, and a welcome sessionable IPA, making the beer highly drinkable. Excellent."
"D - A very accessible IPA. If you're looking for a lot of hop, it isn't exactly here. However, I like how this IPA is more modest in presentation. There are more tastes and aromas that aren't masked by hops. A damn good beer."
"Drinkability: A pleasantly sessionable IPA. Not the most complex and not overly hoppy, but tasty and enjoyable."
"Drinkability:I like this IPA, but it's got some minor flaws that prevent it from being really great."
"D- Kinda' no frills as IPAs go. Nothing's too over-the-top. I can see drinking more than one in a sitting (and probably will with the 4th of July fireworks tonight). Not something that I'm going to seek out, but pretty good especially with a very moderate price tag."
"One of my favorite beers, inexpensive enough for everyday drinking and still great tasting."
"(D) this may not be the hoppiest or biggest IPA around, but I really enjoy it's moderate bitterness and simple bready malt profile. on another note: I really enjoy the charm of this cloudy beer in a supermarket full of crystal clear IPAs. definitely a beer I would buy again - cheap too."
"Not a terrible beer by any stretch. Quite drinkable, but this is not a good representation of the style."
"Part of their mix 12 pack, that a friend brought to my house. Poured into a British style pint glass. Yellow-orange color. Very hazy body for an IPA. Nice head and lacing. Got a nice grapefruit smell on the nose. Flavor was subtle, which is how I prefer an IPA. There was a nice dose of hops, but it was not overpowering. Mouthfeel was not bitter, which is what I wanted, but I found the beer a tad on the thin side. Drinkability to me was a bit higher than other IPAs because it was not a hop bomb like some consumers love. Just a nice IPA with a decent dose of hops. Fine by me."
"M/D - The somewhat thin body is compounded by under-carbonation, which may have been intentional based on the style. Easy to drink and great price as always from Long Trail."
"If I had a friend that is looking to get into IPA's, i'd probably have them try this out. It's an alright IPA, but too light of an IPA."
"Pours an orangy coper color with moderate head leaving ok lacing. Smell is of earthy and floral hops with a carmel and biscuity background. Taste brings the slightly bitter earthy and floral hops along with a carmel and biscuity malt background. Creamy body, lacking carbonation. Decent beer, nothing spectacular."
"Verry solid IPA but gets pretty boring with even a little to much ale so buy fresh!"
"Brilliant golden color, thin and lacy head that doesn't stay thick but leaves a bit on the glass. Smells strongly of hops, citrusy and herbal. Lighter malt taste, strong herbal hop taste with a moderate citrus/fruit flavor. Lingering herbal hop taste, smooth feel with the hop flavor balancing out the carbonation. Very drinkable in the style of Long Trail's other beers, but with more flavor and more body."
"Which is the best way to enjoy thsi beer. This is no super-hopped IPA, just a very nicely flavorful ale, and drinkable, good session/outdoor/BBQ beer. But I would almost not put it in teh IPA category as it is just mildly aromatic and hoppy. But I like it, although their signature alt is better."
"Drinkability: This maybe works as a session beer on a hot summer day, but I think I'll stock my fridge with something a bit more flavorful."
"CHEERS!!"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Deep rich golden yellow-orange color, cloudy, quite nice appearance. Aroma is fresh with combination of citrus and grassy smells. Touch of spice up front then mellows out with combination of hops and malt. Not overly hoppy which I appreciate. Crisp smooth feel. Easy drinking. Had not seen this one before, and glad I grabbed it. A very good beer."
"Unlike the nose, the bitterness represents in the taste right off the bat. Some buttery, nutty undertones that help the hops take flight are detectable but this is a bitter-sour English hops melange, as you would expect. I would cut the carbonation a touch but overall this is a servicable English IPA."
"Good for laid back drinking and enjoyment during the fall. If I had my choice I'd vote for more hops and less citrus."
"D -- Goes down easy. Good IPA for backyard barbecues with mixed company. Don't think anyone would be too sorry to try this one."
"Drinnkability"
"Overall - An IPA that does not seem to be a hops pissing contest"
"Czolor is on the lighter side, amber-maple brown. It has average carbonation, pretty average taste, and a fine mouth-feel. Because of the lower ABV (I think?) I could definitely session this brew. It's tasty, well carbonated, and from a fantastic state--VERMONT! I support it all, B+"
"D: Very easy to sit back and have a few of these no problem"
"Pours a very clear gold color with more than a finger of white head and pretty decent retension. Lacing all around the glassware. Nose has mild citrus hop aromatics and a bit of sulfur. Body of the beer is light with a low carb level. Fair amount of hop bitterness that lingers for a bit on the tongue. It's not bad, but not something I would seek out to drink again; one was enough."
"Pours a hazy honey color with a small tight white head that settled into a light cap. The aroma is of a light malt with a lemon or tea-like hop presence. Hop presence not very strong in the aroma. The taste is of a honey malt with some lemon and a grassy bitter hop. It has a bit of a sugary taste as well. Definitely malt driven but I figured there would be more of a hop presense, it is barely noticable. Moderate body with fizzy carbonation; nice balance. The drinkability is fine, actually drinks easy but the hop profile seems week even for an EIPA"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a rich golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is rather mild, some hops. Taste is of light hops with some citrus, a hint of malts. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this makes for a fairly enjoyable beer."
"This unfiltered ""Real IPA"" from Long Trail strikes a nice middle ground in the style. It's not quite as hoppy as most of the American ones out there but certainly hoppier than your average English IPA. A satisfying grainy finish rounds things out. Simply one of those solid brews you could go all night with."
"Long Trail Traditional IPA is an easy sipper and a solid beer."
"I'd have trouble with with many of these, due to the excessive gas."
"D: Highly drinkable, a good, solid IPA that one can enjoy all night."
"simply too drinkable and sessionable. the best LT i've had. the Ale is good, but this somehow is a great unknown to me i'll now never forget. maybe my tastebuds and this large pilsner glass helped...who knows. A+"
"T- For an IPA, it has a very berry taste to it. Not as spicy as you might expect from an IPA. It's a very interesting taste. It's worth a try because it's good, just not what I'm looking for out of an IPA."
"I was really pleased with this beer. I believe it has 56 IBU's making it a milder IPA, but its enabled me to ease some of my friends into drinking somewhat hoppier beers. The beer its self goes down very easy with a clean hoppy finish and an afater taste that doesn't linger too long. Good job Long Trail."
"mouthfeel is medium bodied,light acohol.this is a great session beer.wish i could get it in ohio.my parents bought this for 7 bucks. english ipa's are terribly underrated,they are very flavorful and refreshing."
"D- Easy to drink minus being overly carbed for me, which leaves my stomach feeling full like a balloon, ugh."
"Medium-light amber-gold with a medium-sized, white, foamy head that diminishes to a thick film. Good lacing. Smell is mild for an IPA, even for an English IPA, but the floral and citrus hops are balanced nicely by the earthiness and lightly sweet malt backbone. Taste follows suit, with good balance and some pine and resin on the finsh. It has a medium-light body, dry texture and moderate carbonation. Nothing to really wow you here, but nothing wrong either. A solid, drinkable beer."
"Not my favorite version of IPA by any means. As an ""unfiltered"" IPA, I guess it passable. I guess I was just shocked with the first one because they got somewhat better the more I drank."
"Pours a nice cloudy golden pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with some hop notes, some citrus. The taste is sweet, malty, nice little hop note/bite, and slight citrus. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty EIPA, thanks Erik."
"D: Very easy to drink, a good IPA to ease others into the class... but I prefer something with a little more 'oomph' to it, and I'm no hophead."
"The color of the beer is copper slightly hazy (due to unfiltered). The intensity of the aroma is light and mainly malty with some hops notes. Taste is slightly hoppy with some bitterness. A not so aggressive IPA for a change! I would say this is a good introductory IPA. A very refreshing beer, nothing out of this world but still good to drink during hot summer days."
"Mouthfeel is a thin medium; I would like a little more creaminess, but maybe that could be produced with a handpump. Drinkability is really nice. This would be a great summer beer for somebody not to into hefes. Recommended."
"D- Yes, this beer is drinkable...I am a fan of the English style IPA's but don't think this one really holds true to the style."
"This beer pours a clear lighter straw color with a small, offwhite head that lasts a few minutes leaving very minimal spots of lace. Nose is of a muted pine and floral hops, and grainy malt. Taste is relatively bland and muted - citrus hops start this beer, grain and caramel malts rest in the middle, and finishes with a touch of piney hops. Although decently blended, the tastes are extremely muted. Lighter bodied, medium carbonation, slight afterbite of hops. This is an average IPA that I wouldn't turn away but wouldn't go out of my way to purchase."
"Bottle from my mom- A deep orangey copper pour. A frothy white head. Nice piney and grapefruit pith nose, with caramel, bread crust, a bit of perfume. Taste of orange peel, caramel malts, grapefruit, some apricot, a bit earthy. Lengthy bitter citric finish. Good stuff."
"Cheers!!"
"D) A decent IPA, I would definitely have another."
" A well balanced IPA that can be enjoyed anytime."
"This beer is in my opinion best served cold, when not quite to refrigerator temperature the hop taste sticks around in the mouth a little too long."
"drinkable as an IPA could be, but its really just a really good pale ale."
"D- Not a bad IPA, but not great."
"light body, a tad thin, but some smoothness, w resinous flash in the finish. carbonation is moderate but with all the piney resins in the flavor, seems overly crisp at times."
"Out of a bomber this beer was a hazy, golden-tangerine color. The three fingers of light-beige head displayed very good retention eventually turning from a fluffy cap to little islands and lacing in consistent, sticky bands. The aroma was of citrus and floral hops with some grapefruit and tangerine atop a pale malt backbone. Well-balanced. The flavors were a little less well-defined than the aroma but still good. The juicy citrus came forward first followed by a bland, malty middle, a touch of alcohol, some herbal notes and a bitter, citrus rind finish that lingered. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation good. A very good I.P.A. but the flavors were slightly more neutral than I prefer in the style and did not quite live up to all the other elements that were quite impressive."
"I remember this was the first IPA I ever had back in college, I thought it was SO bitter and hardcore, but now that I come back to it it seems very mellow and tame and so very awesome!"
"D - This is a good representation of the English-style IPA. Certainly worth a try."
"Poured into a mug a hazy yellow/gold, with a finger of sticky white head. Head doesn't last very long, but does leave noticeable lacing on the glass. No real discernible scent. Taste is of hop bitterness, with maybe some citrusy flavors. A friend brought me a few of these from the states, and have been impressed with their drinkability."
"The mouth is thickish and slightly oily. This could be an easy beer to session. I made two disappear with my burger. This beer has enough flavors to stand up to most foods."
"This is an enjoyable beer, but not what I expect from an IPA."
"Update 9/25/08: Lots of floral hops in the flavor along with bitter grassy hops. Smooth palate and more full-bodied than I remembered. I guess I underrated this one, so I changed my scores. 7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"Notes: A well constructed IPA. Not extreme in any way, but a good session IPA. Would drink over most other NE IPA's."
"Poured into the center of a traditional pint glass. There was some sediment at the bottom of the bottle which I mistakenly poured into the glass, which made the beer mostly opaque. It has a straw color and a thick white head that leaves lace on the sides of the glass as it recedes to a skim of bubbles on the top of the beer. There is a mild hoppy aroma. The taste has a medium hoppy character, with some hop bitterness in the finish. There is mild to heavy carbonation and a light body that leaves your mouth feeling wet (as opposed to a dry finish). Overall, there doesn't seem to be much to this beer (especially compared to Long Trail's DIPA); I've had much better IPAs. I had this beer because it was abandoned in my fridge, I doubt I'd purchase one."
"A bit malt heavy. Refreshing in comparison to the now ubiquitous trend toward ultrahopped American IPAs whose dreadful mission it is to pucker the lips of all mankind."
"D- Very drinkable IPA. This will fit nicely into my regular rotation for session beers. Smooth and light enough to enjoy on a nice warm day."
"Poured a light gold with a frothy white head. Nice retention from what I can see (poured in a plastic cup, terrible I know) Floral citrus smell but very malty as well. A little flat tasting up front finished by a kick in the mouth from the hops, nicely balanced with a little grapefruit and malt. Slightly bitey mouthfeel but finishes smooth, I like this one and in the past I wasn't a big Long Trail guy."
"M + D: A 'spritzy' carbonation over a slightly slick body. I quite enjoyed having a six-pack of this and I will miss it, as it is the last one I am reviewing from and I won't be able to pick it up again until I return to New Jersey in August! Hopefully, there will be reason to head to an area it's available between now and then. Solid beer, and worth picking up."
"D- Without knowing that it's 5.9% ABV I would deem it an excellent session beer. Although 5.9 isn't all that high, it's enough."
"Feel is light but with enough body to not be watery, good carbonation keeps the flavors evolving. Very drinkable and maybe a new staple for the summer."
"D- The Long Trails I have had are all very drinkable and this one is the same. I don't know if I'll search it out but I won't turn it down."
"Prickly on the tongue, but creamy as well. This is very drinkable. The hops aren't too over the top. Malt character balances well. A nice offering from Long Trail."
"Pours a hazy golden amber color with 2 fingers of frothy white head, average retention and some spotty lacing, good at first. Smells of grass, pine, caramel, and toasted grain. Tastes of honey, grainy malts, dried grass, pine, banana, and yeast; a little disappointing for an IPA. Medium light in body, unbalanced with too much malt character and an off bitterness in the finish. An ok beer but not what I'd look for in an IPA."
"Pours a four finger white head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Cloudy light amber color. Piney/hoppy nose. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is piney/hoppy as expected, lingering bitter finish. Mellows a little as it warms. 12oz bottle part of 12-pak $10.99 Market Basket Concord, NH."
"A very unique take on an IPA---unfiltered & very malty. Apparently this is more in the English mode; guess I'm more of an American IPA fan. The appearance is very cloudy yellowish-orange, far from the translucent copper tone I'm more accustomed to. Being unfiltered, the yeasty taste overtakes the hops, with a slight banana flavor sometimes completely overtaking any bitter citrus undertones. The nose is pretty disappointing, more reminiscent of a belgian white than an IPA. It's drinkable, but not one of my favorites."
"Overall, I enjoyed this IPA a fair bit. There are many others that have much more depth to their flavor though. Not a bad beer to try, but not one I can see myself having too often."
"Drinkability: I could easily drink this IPA all night without tying my stomach in knots."
"Better than Keith's, worse than Meantime or Blackheart."
"D- Not outstanding for the style, but none the less a beer which I could drink a few of."
"D - I found this very drinkable...not the best IPA I've had...but it's a good one"
"Pours a hazy bright orange.. sort of like Blue Moon.. with a 1/4 cm head that holds up prety well to time with good lacing. Aroma is a little stale of grains and light floral hops. I'm not too familiar with English IPAs but this seems to live up to a good example of the style description as a ""tweaked pale ale."" A lot of nice malt character and body with a good balance with the flavoring hops- nowhere even near the blistering hop presence in the American versions. I think this would be great out of a cask."
"D: A quaffer ipa that drank more like a light pale ale."
"Pours a cloudy golden orange color that glows in the light. A small white head rests atop leaving consistent notching. Moderate nose of sweet cascade hop, subtle roasted malt and a fresh crackery yeast character. Great balance throughout, a bit soapy at times but overall bright in quality hop flavor with an excellent medium mouth feel and a long bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is high on this one, the definition of session-able, i highly recommend it."
"D: An ok combination of mouthfeel and taste leads to the beer being pretty drinkable. The beer could use a little bit more bitterness to balance out the sweet malt, but overall, a pretty good IPA."
"I really enjoyed this one. A unique IPA for sure."
"Long Trail needs to go back to the drawing board with this one. It's way too short on hops and overall flavor. The nose suffers a great deal just from its blandness. Overall, not very good. I won't be a repeat visitor."
"I've had better IPA's, but for the price this a good beer. It's definitely a regular in my fridge."
"(rated Jul 11, 2007)"
"Drinkability: Overall, a pretty good IPA that is a good companion to some lighter dishes like seafood or an antipasto. Not better then some other Pales on the market but a very good stab at the style. Refreshing and hoppy. Just right!"
"Ranting aside, if you want to try a mild, drinkable IPA that isn't trying to push the envelope, give this one a whirl."
"Really weak IPA. Not really very hopped at all, more of a fruity pale ale. That being said, it isn't bad. Smells average, little bit fruity. Tastes a little hoppy, but pretty mellow for an IPA. Some fruit comes through in the taste along with spices. Average IPA, there are far better ones out there."
"I like this IPA interpretation for it's lack of filtration and malt base. Not a fan of the dish soap though."
"D: Not very hoppy at all, and IPA's usually hit my mouth and stomach hard, but I could take this one in stride."
"Very drinkable beer. There is a very strong and fresh hop taste that hits nicely, but because of the appearance of the malts and wheat there is a better balance to this beer than most I.P.A. This beer is much more drinkable than the average I.P.A."
"Notes: Very well done in my humble opinion."
"D-One of the more drinkable IPAs out there"
"I found this beer to be quite good. I was suprised at how well it compared to most other beers. I will definitely consider buying this beer in the future. It poured a beautiful hazy amber. It smelled of pleasant hops. Tasted refreshing without being to heavy or light. Tasted unlike any other IPA and I could probably drink five or six of these without switching. Overall a really good IPA."
"After all the IPA's I've tried, this local one is stlll one of my favorites. For $11.99/12 pack, it's a great deal as well. A super hoppy beer with a great aroma and taste. Beautiful color with nice lacing and a great mouthfeel. All around just a great beer."
"Don't drink and review."
"D - Easy to drink but not an outgoing IPA."
"Drinkability - Yeah, I could drink these all night with a bottomless stomach. Points off for heavy residual yeast, otherwise a 5 in this catagory."
"D. This is uber-drinkable. I had to do a double take when I saw my glass half empty after the first couple of minutes. If you're looking for a not too intense, easy drinking IPA, this is it."
"Driving back from Robinson the other day I had to stop for gas off the Imperial exit of 22/30. so I figured why not take a gander at what was available at Essex Beer distributor. To my surprise Long Trail brews are now available in the Pittsburg market, and now my decision was split between the Harvest Brown Ale, IPA bottle on 8/4/08, their award winning hefe, or the elusive double bag strong ale. I was feeling hops and I'm glad I side with this one at just under 30 bucks that is quite a value. Pours a light bright slightly clouded orange hue. Head forms nice and thick depending on how vigorous you land it in the glass. Anyway a great collar of foam forms thick at the upper edge of my chalice while even lacing streaks a formed with each sip after. Aromatics provided herbal citrus and earthy notes. Upfront however is some grapfruit peel with soothing tea like edges, I love Nugget hops. Sweetness comes through as well, but no with the typical cloud of caramel this one has a much more clean biscuit light sweetness going on with some sugar coated hop action very nice. Flavor is mellow with hop bitterness but hop flavors like citrus peel and earthy herbal qualities flow throughout each sip. Moderate amount of dry bitterness finish is typical with really no malt sweetness in the end just citrus peel quality of the Nuggets. Balanced and more English/East Coast but it's so damn enjoyable who cares if it doesn't take a layer of enamel off of my teeth. Mouthfeel is solid crisp bitter hops and sweetness with a dry hop finish sticking around followed by welcoming hop burps. Drinkability, this brew is definitely case worthy I'm glad I decided to pick up a case blindly without thinking it's only rated a B on Beeradvocate. Damn good and a nice introduction to what I'm sure is a quality craft brewing company."
"I like this English style IPA, seems to be on its way to being an American style with the nice hop bite. Good easy drinker, I would like to revisit sometime."
"This was the 4th Long Trail beer I've tried so far. A pretty nice IPA. Copper color with a relatively small off-white head. Aroma wasn't the greatest however, slightly woody and grassy. Very flavorful sweet malty taste with a nice amount of hops but nothing out of the norm for the style."
"Pours a hazy yellow/ light orange-ish color, with a white head. In the aroma, fresh hops, like smelling a bag of hop flowers. In the taste, big on the fresh hops and balanced with a good English malt. A hop bite, with a medium mouthfeel, with a semi dry, fresh hop aftertaste. Nice fresh hop aroma and taste. Color threw me off, but a nice mellow IPA>"
"This brew is nothing to write home about. Very one-dimensional with a few off flavors. I could drink a few of these easily but there is a very long list of other IPAs I would have over this one."
"D-Its okay, I had several this session before moving on."
"Overall a pleasant beer and solid New England local, but nothing worth going out of your way for. This seems to be the case with most of Long Trail's offerings lately. I tasted this one last year and found it significantly better, based on memory."
"D-Actually pretty good, I'm a big long trail fan (Double bag, and hefeweizen-umm) and was all excited about a LT IPA. However I was disappointed while drinking it due to its rather uneventful flavors, but before I new it, the beer was gone, so it can't be that bad. Also seems like it has a lower ABV then advertised as it nothing to drink multiple LT IPA's. Lately been drinking Smuttynose IPA, possibly I contribute the somewhat bland flavor of the LT IPA and over all weak feeling ABV due to my overexposure to Smutty. Overall LT IPA is avg. in my mind, certainly wouldn't turn one down, but will reach for Smuttynose ipa when they are side by side in the cooler."
"D: I think that this was an old bottle, based on other reviews. But I could be wrong(it was acquired in a recent trade). I could drink several of these, even with the off flavors."
"Drinkability- A nice IPA not great but definitely does the trick."
"Recommended..."
"notes: A decent IPA not something I would seek out, but if you throw it in front of me...I'll take the bait."
"There is something wrong with this beer; bad bottle."
"A descent IPA but not my favorite. I would consider this a good session beer."
"D - Drinkability is good. Flavors are mild and balanced like I would expect from an English IPA. The aroma could have used a tad more malt and sweetness to balance the hops but that isn't really a deal-breaker for this beer. The alcohol is low and stays hidden well enough to drink a few of these. Good solid beer from Long Trail."
"D: Not a powerhouse IPA but very satisfying and drinkable in quantity."
"The hops bitterness lingers and is nice."
"not super hoppy, and overall a pretty refreshing IPA. i was expecting more of a hop overload, but instead long trail's traditional unfiltered IPA goes down crisp and was very drinkable. i could easily drink a six pack of these or more in one night, which usually isn't the case for me when it comes to IPA's."
"D_A nice tasty version of the style. I would get this again if Brooklyn's IPA were not available more often, and a slight bit better."
"Pretty drinkable as well."
"Drinkability - This is more of a 3-drink beer, as with most IPAs."
"D: The rest of the beer doesn't stack up to the initial appearance. It's a pretty generic IPA and I wouldn't go out of my way to get this one."
"Tolerable."
"Pours an orange-amber color with a short and medium bodied tan head that laces the glass ok on the way down. The aroma is of some sweet malts, and then piney and then citrisy hops. The taste is good. Nice malty base underneath a very piney and citirsy hoppy bitterness. The mouthfeel is very crisp and fresh feeling which makes the drinkability very good. A fine IPA"
"D: This is ok... but there are better choices out there.. check out Fuller's, Deuchars or St. Peter's to get a better idea of what this style is capable of."
"d: Big thanks to DrDogbeer for this unique IPA, I've never had anything quite like it and it was a real treat. Thanks Tom!"
"Basically, it wasn't bad, a nice cloudy orange pour with a pale yellow head that stuck around for most of the glass. Lacing is evident, and left rings around the glass. Anyway,smell was not as hoppy as I thought it might be,kinda pine scent, but got better once you tasted it. As far as drinkablility is, it's not bad going down, Hangs around a bit. Over all, pretty nice beer."
"Price $22.99 Philadelphia Area - nice price for a nice beer!"
"Drinkability is good. This would be a nice summertime session beer or lawnmower beer. I could drink a lot more than one. As an English IPA, I have had better, but not a bad beer overall."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice EIPA to drink a few of when you're in the mood for the style. It wouldn't normally be my first choice, but I wouldn't be too disappointed if I were to be stuck with it as my best option."
"Had this one in their winter pack, man was this good. Appearance was classy: murky, bright gold color with a good, solid head. The smell was quite sharp with aromas of citrus and definitely hops. The taste was a bit too polished: not too bitter, not too sweet. The mouthfeel was great at first. Awesome carbonation with some great fizzy bubbles rushing upward through the glass. However, I felt once I was half way through, it was getting kind of flat. Overall, this is one heck of a good IPA from my wonderful Green Mountain neighbor to the north."
"D: A dull beer that leaves you wanting more kick but I guess that makes it drinkable."
"This is from a winter mix pack I bought up at the Shaws. Pours a very hazy cloudy orange color, looks promising. Not much smell, a faint citrus, might be weakly smelling or my sinuses blocked (as usual) Tastes a lot better, a nice cirusy hoppy flavor that stands out very well, especialy if compared to their normal pale ale. Good mouthfeel. Overall I am impressed. Not the greatest IPA I've had but it is really good and flavorful. If I see this on the store shelves I will go get it again. Recommended."
"12 oz bottle into tulip glass. A: Cloudy orange/yellow, small amount of head that retains to a caked on layer. Some sparse globs of lacing. S: The hops are on the citrusy side, nothing to intense in there, lighter malts. T: Really solid hop profile with a slightly bitter, dry finish. Very simple and clean. M: Smooth, perhaps a tad thin. D: I think this is a really nice, simple IPA. Good balance, nothing too aggressive. The finish is particularly nice, and it's opening up more of the hop profile as I continue through the glass. I may not go out of my way to pick up a six-pack, but it's a solid offering and I'd probably buy it if I saw it."
"Overall, I like this Beer and think that it is a good Beer, but I don't think that it should be considered an English IPA because the hops seem too American and too aggressive, I also think that the malt characteristics should show through a little more than it does. The yeasty esters were English-ish enough though."
"Pours an orange haze with a small white head. Smells of grapefruit, and some citrus notes. Taste is well balanced. Not too bitter at all. Nice hop flavors. Citrusy, grapefruit, light lingering hoppiness. Mouthfeel is really thin but perfect carbonation. Very smooth, easy drinking, session beer."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, imo. There is a burning bitterness in the aftertaste that I am not enjoying very much. Overall, it's an ok beer, but not one that I would pick up again if I had a choice."
"Pours a totally fogged in gold with no head after it sits for a short while. Nose is kind of airy thin with a touch of mild orange. Extremely faint pine hop character comes through after it sits for several minutes. Flavor is odd for this style I think. Orange citrus is fairly heavy on there. Slight salt there. Hop influence, yes, but overall fairly mild. For some reason the flavor profile and feel remind me of a witbier. Feel is sticky on the liquid and good with the bubble on the tongue. Overall it is drinkable for sure due to the smooth experience it delivers. Nothing flavor fantastic, but still well made."
"the last f the vermont sampler was the IPA ; pours a light-med gold w/ a thin white head which dissipates quickly leaving little lacing in my nonic ; a citrusy hop aroma w/ a faint fruity alcohol undertone ; a thin flavor, a decent hop bite, but not much afterwards ; a rather thin mouthfeel as well, much lighter than most IPA's i've had, and a tad overcarbonated ; not an undrinkable beer, just not a standout IPA.."
"Overall this was a solid offering, and something that I probably would not have picked up had it not been sent to me. I am glad I got a chance to try it; it was a little more then your average, run of the mil IPA, but if you were to think of this as a pale ale, I would put it down as excellent. Either way this would make a fine staple and an excellent sessionable selection. Very nicely done and a good solid call."
"Drinkability- Overall a very drinkable beer."
"pours a hazy golden color with an average head. and some floating yeast. The smells is mostly sweet with a slight hint of hops. The flavor is dry with some fruity hops, and some banana flavor coming through, and finishes of rather crisp. The mouthfeel is average, and the drinkability ok. I would probably have enjoyed this more on a warm day, as opposed to a 20 deg snowy night."
"Pours a cloudy orange. Slight off white thick head. Nice lacing left on the glass when the head receded. Mild hop aroma in the nose. Nice taste of grapefruit upfront. Not too bitter but a decent presence. Finished with a taste of sourdough. Good mouthfeel not too much carbonation. I found this to be a very sessionable ale."
"A nice addition for Long Trail, who, IMHO, has a tendency to keep brewing its standard ale and slapping different labels on it. Not a bad representation for the style, though I prefer Brooklyn's take on the English IPA."
"A solid IPA, nothing that knocked my socks off, but a good beer"
"D - I like this a lot. It's hoppy, but balanced. Goes down smooth and is absolutely delicious."
"A murky yellow body with a small white fluffy head.As the head goes down,there is some lacing.Head falls to a cap that take up the whole top of my glass.Nice lace marks where I take my sip all the way down the glass.Smell of citrus and some malty goodness.The taste is a toned down cascadish taste,not overpowering in any way.Clean aftertaste,I cant really put where I taste the malt at in this beer.You sorda have to pull to get a good smell.The worst part about this beer is the watered down taste.All in all this beer isnt bad but I wont be going out of my way to try it again untill they make some changes"
"After drinking the LT variety pack, this one was a bit of a relief because I was tiring of the malty sweetness of the other beers. This is a fairly clear, light amber color, maybe a little off-yellow. It is medium bodied with some head, retention and lacing. The smell is the high point with a nice hoppy pine smell and oily esters. The taste does not live up to the very aromatic smell in that there is a malty sweetness and a weak hoppiness for an IPA. There really isn't enough going on in this beer to draw much interest, but the aftertaste is mild and the mouthfeel is inoffensive. Other than the relative hoppiness, which came as a nice change up, in comparison with the other beers in the variety pack, this one is decent but uneventful."
"Just like their hefe weizen it took me a few sips to truly start enjoying this beer ( I think it might be the yeast that I find a bit strange, but I could be wrong). It has a piny, citrusy, and malty taste. Also some fruits are noticeable ( reminding me of their hefe once again). It is very refreshing I'm glad to have a couple more."
"D- I like this one very much. It was included in the variety pack I picked up and it was the best of the bunch. I have had alot of IPAs and this is one of my recent favorites."
"pour into a pint with a copper/amber color, very clear almost clean looking. Head was highly carbonated , white,not very big but stayed consistent throughout, about a 1/4 inch. Smell was distinctive pine and floral undertones. Taste was pleasent ,mild hops yet not underdone - bitter on the end. Highly drinkable, definitely an AD (all day ) IPA. Leaned more towards a APA than an IPA. Wouldn't turn this down but wouldn't actively seek this one out. Overall- pleasing."
"Long Trail IPA pours a hazy light copper with a thin head. Aroma is mostly hops, grassy and herbal with a hint of citrus rind. Flavor is mostly dry with some hints of yeast. Plenty of hop bitterness with the same hop flavor as in the aroma. Nice to see this one around more often, it goes well with the Thai basil dish I'm eating."
"Overall this is the best balanced IPA I have had, Sea Hag is a close second but leans towards the Hops. Very drinkable."
"A hazy gold color with an average sized chewy head and good lace. It smells first of lemon and then some banana and floral hops. The taste hits first with a lemon crispness, also, with the mellow hops nicely blended in for a sweet, velvetty brew with very tasteful carbonation. Highly refreshing stuff with a touch of dryness to the finish. Well balanced though the accent is on the clean crisp treatment that is quite drinkable. Great effort here, especially as a summer ipa option! Hops are not real strong but very tastefully present for sure."
"I really enjoy the taste of this beer. Pleasantly bitter but not too much so. I would have guessed Northern Brewer hops but their website says they used Nugget and Cascade. Good balance of maltiness and hoppiness. The flavor of the malt, in addition to the lack of an over-the-top hop aroma, lets me know this is an English IPA as opposed to an American one. Lately I've been in the mood for English style IPAs, so this one is a welcome addition to my current ""go-to"" beers. I find it pleasant and quite drinkable."
"pours a cloudy golden color with a fluffy white two finger head and a fair amount of lacing. aroma of grapefruit and other fruity notes. malty, bready, grapefruit, lemon flavors mix well for a great taste. mouthfeel is medium to thick and carbonation is good. really liked this one, does not leave you with that bitter after taste that most ipa have. good session beer."
"I've been sampling this one for the past 2 months. An excellent brew - perhaps a bit too hoppy for some (like my wife) but it is very impressive that they left it unfiltered and so raw. There's enough malt to put up a reasonable defense to the strong hop attack. A true and unexpected treasure from an unexpected source."
"d- very drinkable, but could be thinner to make it more drinkable."
"D- the fact that the hop profile is so out of balance hurts this beer. I will finish the sample pack but that is about it"
"overall, this isnt the boldest IPA you'll have, but it has a nice balance of flavor and drinkability, which makes this IPA one of my favorites (ive never had their normal IPA, but I'm assuming this one is better because it's part of the ""brewmasters"" series)."
"A mild IPA yet refreshingly different from the norm."
"Drinkability: Oh, it's very drinkable indeed. Quite a nice warm-weather brew. Dare I call it sessionable?"
"This beer seems to be lost somewhere between a pale ale, hefeweizen, and IPA. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a different take on the IPA style. Nice beer overall."
"Pours a nice yellowish-gold in color with a finger of almost fluffy white head that disappated rather quickly leaving spotty lacing. Smells of some citrusy and floral hops and biscuity malts, fairly average but nicely balanced. Taste is better. Theres a decent malt backbone here but the hops, predominantly floral, run the show from start to finish. The malts do make a valiant attempt to come to the forefront at the finish but are stubborny turned back by the hops. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nice medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. At this abv and with this balance I can confidently call this a good session brew. If you're looking for something spectacular keep looking but if you want a nicely balanced and enjoyable IPA here it is."
"Pours a thin head that holds some lace down the glass, and dissipates by the end.. Aroma is pronounced with citrus, and ""green"" tones. Taste is bitter, but not overwhelming, almost too little for an IPA. Appearance is hazy with light orange shade. Very clean and drinkable overall. Would make a good first choice for IPA virgins."
"I wasn't crazy about this beer at first, but now that I'm taking another look at it I'm really enjoying it. Tons of Cascade hops without the massive bitterness against a beautiful clean spring water sort of backbone. Very nice."
"Mouthfeel- For an IPA this is really nice, sweeter with the yeast and some real nice citrus notes, I agree with tempest about the orangey taste that is there. The sweet flavors fade into the hops for a hoppier finish. Very good, quaffable."
"Damn, it's like this was mixed with orange juice. I'm used to citrus hops, but never anything so orange-like. Decent bitterness, nothing too powerful (or fun), but the flavor is still full of juicy hops flavors with a bit of biscuit malts in the background. A bit yeasty too as its unfiltered, which is a nice touch."
"Drinkability- I would say that it is very drinkable for an IPA. If you want something that is representative of what a good IPA should be, this is a decent choice."
"As smooth and creamy as can be,velvety. Very light for an IPA. Could almost pass for a wheat. Not like most IPA's i've tasted very light, pleasing and smooth nothing extreme,could drink this beer all day long on a hot summer day. The most drinkable IPA i've ever had. Would be a great starter IPA."
"Pale, slightly hazy golden color. Not a lot of aroma-muted hops at best. Slight piney aroma to it. Good malty flavor with a nice underlying hop bitterness. Lingering bitterness is nice as well. Decent mouthfeel to it-a touch of creaminess against the bitter flavor is well done. Overall a good beer though I would like something a bit ""bolder"". Probably comes from the full frontal hop assault I am used to. A nice english version though."
"Drinkability - Ahhhh I tink i'm learning I don't like IPA's. Good beer if you want IPA. I just don't like the bitterness at the end. I don't like grapefruit."
"I found it to be very drinkable."
"hitchhiker courtesy of Tempest. A minimalist IPA, with a lagerish taste, aroma, and mouthfeel. Its a lighter colour with a bit of grapefruit colour. There is above average carbonation and powdery citrus aroma. Maybe the unfilteredness contributes, it's OK but still below average."
"A fine IPA, and especially suprising to me since I am not all that fond of Long Trail's other offerings."
"Notes: I reviewed this beer based on the characteristics as opposed to the style guidelines because of the differences I mentioned."
"Had this on tap for the first time after enjoying several bottles over the last few months. It came to my table brilliantly clear, unlike the bottled version, and with a frothy, enduring head. Smells of wonderfully fresh malt and hops. Well balanced but still a good hop presence. Now my second favorite Long Trail brew, after Double Bag."
"perfectfly balanced and unfiltered to boot. kick ass. i'm kind of split down the middle with long trail but this happens to be one i could drink a keg of. well responsibly of course... but really, this beer is an awesome sessionable IPA that doesn't destroy your palate."
"Pours a cloudy golden. Thin white head. decent retention,and good lacing. Smell is of fruit,and candy,with a nice edge of hops. Body is medium,with a good amount of carbonation. This was truly a unique beer for me. Taste is fruited, almost like a Hefe, but has the hops flavor of an IPA. Excellent!"
"This stuff is good. It poured a nice foamy white head and had a golden coloring. Had a good malty smell to it too, with a nice crisp and refreshing taste. On the first sip, you the malts first and quickly following is the strong hops. Theres nothing incredibly special about this beer, I'd say its an average IPA, but average is fine by me. Worth a shot."
"Light bodied, pleasant enough. Nice aftertaste. Definitely don't have to choke it down. Could drink several of these in a row, but no real ""wow"" factor. Should be considered a regular pale at best. A nice beer, just not a great one, especially for style."
"This is one of those beers that I always think to myself that I should pick up, but usually move on to something else. Pours a cool golden color, with a really enticing creamy white head reminiscent of the retention on a guinness draught. It also sticks right uo until the bottom, which is pretty cool in my book. Oily hops dominate the aroma, with some apple rind as well as a slight mustyness in the background. A good dosage of fruit hits the palate first, followed by the hops, which seemed a bit more accentuated in the smell, but still nowhere near being weak. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, making it a very nice session brew. I don't get a chance to try nearly enough English IPA's, so im definitely glad i picked this one up. This is probably the best offering i've sampled from Long Trail. This one really seems like it supercedes their regularly rotating IPA...why not make this one a year round?"
"Poured a hazed near murky light gold with some peach colored hue a thinner quick to dissapate white head atop,mmm fresh nose quite piney and grassy a light toastiness underneath bu the fresh hops are the show here.Pretty yeasty and dry upfront the hops are in the pine needle variety flavor wise not enough citrus quality at least for me seems a bit lackluster compared to the nice hop prfile in the nose.Its a decent IPA but it left me wanting a little more flavor I guess,I wouldnt seek out again."
"Quite enjoyable! It's much fuller and rounder than the crisper, filtered version. Hopefully this will become the year-round IPA."
"D: At 5.6%, this beer is not too terribly high on the scale, helping the drinkability. The hops and malts work well together, creating a flavorful ale."
"A very nice offering. I would drink this with cheese and crackers or as a nice pairing for hors d'oeuvres hour at a party. Try this if you are looking for a new IPA."
"Everything here has been done before, but it does it all credibly, if without any spectacular fanfare. It's a by-the-book IPA that's moderate in its hoppiness but fundamentally tasty. It drinks smoothly and well. I won't shout its praises, but I have no issues with finishing this, and enjoying more when I come across it."
"Long trail has brought this beer on full time and as for an IPA i think it needs a little work. Not much hop character to speak of. Pours a clean amber color with not much head, (could have been from the pour). Clean taste with decent mouthfeel. A good middle fo the road, I would say but it if it was on sale but some others have a much more decent flavor, taste, and smell. I.e. Harpoon or Southern Tier."
"Looks like an IPA. Slightly red-tinged golden color with a great poofy head. Smell is hoppy but not overwhelmingly so, which is slightly surprising. Very sweet smelling as well, quite floral. Honey notes. Taste is quite lovely- not as hoppy as you'd expect, and again, quite sweet. Some spices in there, some floralness, some citrus notes. A unique IPA. Mouthfeel leaves a bit to be desired but is chewy enough to not be a letdown. Overall, quite nice."
"Pours a beautiful bright gold, hazed with yeast, with minimal head. Very pretty beer. Aroma is big and citrusy with ruby red grapefruit and blood oranges. The palate displays big bitterness up front, but not so big as to be unbalanced. Light malt flavors at the mid-palate and very distinctive grapefruit at the finish. Light on the tongue, but still substantial enough to earn the term ""beer," this is a solid session brew and one of the better Long Trails I've had."
"D - Nothing special about this beer but it could make a nice cold summer beer on a hot day."
"Very drinkable. A nice subtle IPA."
"This is an IPA to have if you're having a party. Everyone will enjoy it but will not really examine it."
"Drinkability was good. Dry hops faintly noticeable. Very simple, yet refined beer which could easily be a solid session brew due to balance and solid overall construction."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Great, soapy carbonation that allows the malts to fully express themselves. I wouldn't ever choose to session this beer, but with a slice of pizza... damn, bring on the pepperoni."
"Part of a Summer Sampler 12 pack. This was an OK beer. It was a slightly hazy yellow with a medium head that quickly dissipated. A mostly floral aroma, maybe a little grain. It was sweet, with a little hops. Pretty good, but I would like a more pronounced hops presence."
"Drinkability is pretty damn good. For this review, I had two 12 oz bottles (minus a sip) poured into the large 23 oz ""Vermont Pint"" nonic that they sell at the brewery, (great glass if you can find one). It was really quaffable and thirst-quenching."
"The beer poured a light orange color with a slight white head that didn't stick around that long. The aroma is a nice floral hop kick with a malty backbone. The taste is a bit dry but then you get the kick of hops and some malty goodness to round things out. With a someone light body I found this beer to be pretty drinkable."
"Drinkability: One of the most drinkable IPA's i've found, refreshing a bitter, yet not overwhelming."
"Poured golden with a bubbly white head. It didn't last long, but settled to a thin lace. Quite a lot of carbonation that settled to moderate carbonation. The smell was enticing, but nothing powerful. It smell of floral fruitness, especially citrus. The taste was refreshing. The citrus flavor (mix of grapefruit, balanced with an orange/lemon mix) was mixed with a fresh golden apple taste and a touch of alcohol flavor. The hoppiness was well balanced. I found it to leave the mouth feeling refreshed and quenched. It was highly drinkable. The only reason it was not a ""5" was that the yeast flavor became a bit strong as the drink neared the end, but that was to be expected because it was not filtered. It was released in the winter, but I could drink this any time of the year. Too bad that it is only a limited edition. It was not outstanding, but certainly good enough for a regular drink."
"I had this on tap at Ri Ra's in Burlinton VT. This pours a golden amber with a large white head. The smell is light malt with some hops,but not as much as you would think. The taste has some hops.but none of the bitterness of other IPA's. This is like a starter IPA or a ""light"" IPA. The m/f is light and well balanced. This is an enjoyable beer and I think I'll enjoy another. Cheers."
"Musings: A very drinkable and satisfying beer. However, the hops really take over. A little more pronounced malt base here would result in a wonderful beer."
"D- An all around good beer, I'd like to see it more often ... a richer flavor than their regular IPA. Very easy to drink, a glass full of hoppy joy."
"Thanks to chaduvel for smuggling this to me. Medium golden/bronze body topped by a fluffy, cottony white head. Muted biscuit and apple malt notes on the nose alongside a slightly citrus zest hop waft. Not too exciting aromatically. Toasted, slightly astringent (grainy) malt up front. Butterscotch and a hint of apples mid-palate. Moderately bitter, slightly herbal hop finish. Not bad, but underwhelming. Light bodied IPA with a subtle feel. Not as creamy or full as I like. Not a bad session beer though."
"Overall = a pretty average IPA. Nothing spectacular but it does the job. There's a lot better else out there though so I don't see why you'd necessarily seek this out unless your options are extremely limited."
"Drinkability: extremely enjoyable and easy to drink. Pick up a sixpack and enjoy. You won't be blown away, but this is a nice solid IPA."
"D - def. drinkable, would get it with a meal though"
"D- Well measured doses of hops paired with just enough malt make this one quite an easy drinker. After getting slammed with so many DIPAs recently, this one was a very welcome change. The addition of the yeast to this IPA adds a new dimension of drinkability in the same way it works for a good Hefeweizen."
"This easy drinking hoppy beer is not as bitter as other hop monsters. It's a bit thin in the mouth feel, but very drinkable. I'd recommend grabbing a six pack before it's all gone."
"Overall, it's...ok. Not one of my favorites from Long Trail. ""Brewmaster's Limited Edition"" is overselling it."
"Pours a hazy copper yellow with and truly is unfiltered as the last ounce or so of my pour splashed some yeast into the mix. With a quarter inch head and a fresh piney hop aroma this IPA seems truly inviting. Although it seems tame when compared to some of the california hop monsters I've been going through recently, it has a very smooth initial melon & citrus flavor followed up with an enjoyably hoppy finish. This has left essentially no residual foam rings on the pint glass, and doesn't have the sticky feel that many other IPA's have. A very enjoyable and incredibly drinkable IPA here, I'll definitely be going back for more."
"This offering from Long Trail poured hard out of the 12 oz bottle, has a golden dark blonde body with some small yeast floating around and leaves a fluffy off-white head about 1-1/2in thick. The head is sticky frothy with giant bubbles throughout. The nose of this brew is suttle faint grape, grassy essence, followed by a hint of morning dew and flowers after a heavy rain. The taste is average, it starts bitter on the palate then moves to a slight watery sweetness like the juice of a melon and finishes with a lemon rind bitterness. Overall decent brew, I guess on tap from the brewery is far superior so I'll have to try and update my review. I paired this beer with a grilled sirlion, baked then grilled sweet potatoe and sweet peas....the earthy flavors in the IPA paired nicely with steak and the rustic flavors in the sweet potatoe."
"Overall an OK IPA....not stellar, but worth a try."
"ll have to pick another bit of this up before it's gone, tasty and easy drinking, this would be great in the spring..."
"The beer poured golden in color that was effervescing with bubbles and had a big, bubbly and well sustained head. As I was soon to find out, the lace trail left behind was fantastic. The nose is out of this world, the freshness of it can just drive you crazy. The hoppiness is pronounced, but its the unbelievable freshness of those hops that's undescribable. While it displays a medium body, the hop explosion on the palate is unavoidable. Grapefruit and citrus notes blend well with the bread-like freshness (there's that word again!). The ""straight out of the brew kettle"" feel that it gives you is literally tangible. The finish is puckering and slightly dry, but not overwhelmingly. There's just enough of a lemon kick to remind you who's boss. Outstanding!"
"Wish that I bought more than the 2 bottles"
"Nice stuff. Very quenching. I'll have to pick up a sixer before it's gone. I don't recall their normal IPA being this good, although I haven't had it in a while. Maybe I should revisit it, if this is the same recipe. Very good, but i can imagine getting bored of this if I drank it all the time. Simplistic approach, but it gets the point across and it's plenty satisfying. Exactly what I wanted after a long day."
"Overall- a decent IPA. This could be best described as a ""gateway"" IPA. It seems Long Trail is Vermont's Micro for the beer neophyte as is Flying Fish (NJ) and Saranac (NY). Otherwise a nice session beer that you can throw back several!!"
"A bit more flavor and balance would improve this IPA. Still, not bad at all and a welcome (permanent?) addition to the Long Trail line."
"Gold cider color. Haziness makes it glow. White head fades to nice ring around the glass. Very light and relaxing aroma and taste. Balenced combination of citrus, pine, spice and slightly sweet fruit. Slightly bitter and spicey in the finish. Very mellow yet complete. Nice mouthfeel and very drinkable."
"Light floral scent, has a very plessant aroma with citrusy undertones. Fruity and light. Clean white head doesn't last too long though. Mild lacing of the glass. Nice deep golden/golden tannish color. Lighter haze for an unfiltered beer. Good mouth feel, smooth and enjoyable not over powering hop flavor. Rather mellow with nice hoppy finish, very refreshing. Overall this is a good IPA. It possesses the great qualities an IPA should have. It is a very pleasent and enjoyable beer. It has a great finish and it is very drinkable. I would recomend this IPA for anyone to try."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" off-white head over the slightly cloudy sark golden/light amber brew. Head fades over reasonable time, with prevalent hunks of lacing. Aroma is crisp pine hops over a pale malt base. Taste is reasonably well-balanced, the scale tipped lightly towards the sedate hopping, as one might expect from an English-style IPA. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, and drinkability is very nice. This will keep me looking for the next Long Trail special offering, as well as revisiting this with less adventurous friends."
"878"
"Pours a golden orange with a rocky head. The head lasts for a long time and leaves lots of lacing behind. Aroma is citrusy, hoppy and inviting. Taste is very nicely balanced. The hops are not as aggressive and meld nicely with the malt backbone. Mouthfeel is creamy, luxurious. A very nice IPA, easily drinkable and very tasty."
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks dmeadows and OneBoxBIF."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is very good-being very smooth and clean. Drinkability is good and easy. I can definately relax and melt into my couch with one of these."
"Cheers!"
"A golden yellow beer with a slight haze. Has a big foamy white head with some nice lace. There is a strong piney hop aroma (almost resinous) with a light malt note moving in as the beer warms. A light sweet biscuit malt note starts the taste off. Then a nice easy piney hop character creates a good clean crisp finish."
"D - Very drinkable. Not overpoweringly hoppy @ 56 IBU."
"Long Trail India Pale Ale poured a clear gold color with a snow white head. The head was about a finger thick but thinned quickly. The thinner head stayed throughout the pint and left lacing down the entire glass. The smell was almost non-existent. A few earthy hop tones but nothing pronounced and much less robust than I expect from an IPA. The taste went along with the smell, nothing jumped out. Not malty but also almost no hop flavor. This beer seems more of a standard English Bitter than an IPA. Light hop notes and not sweet, but in no way an IPA. The mouthfeel was average as was the drinkability. An unfortunately uninspired IPA."
"This is a very drinkable pale ale. Not sure it is strong enough or hoppy enough to warrant the IPA moniker. I really enjoyed drinking this fine brew. I bought my case at the brewery and was told it was the ""unfiltered variety"" that was served at a recent brew fest. all the labels were affixed upside down to set it apart from the filtered variety. I would buy and drink this one again."
"Go ahead and give this one a try, but don't expect a flavourful hop bomb."
"This one is a clear golden brew with a one inch head. The aroma is of hops and is a bit spicy to the nose. Its flavor is hopy, but is dulled a little bit by the malt. The hops do not realy come out until the aftertaste. Mouth feel is medium bodied and is generously carbonated. It goes down easy, as this is not an in your face IPA. I think that they should take off the statement on the bottle that says one of the hoppiest brews in the states. Blasphemy."
"This beer is decent (my review sounds really negative so far), but in the field of American IPAs, it doesn't even get an honorable mention."
"D: I'd been looking forward to trying this beer but it didn't live up to my expectations. It was fine to drink but I wouldn't buy another six pack. I would like to try a pint from the tap to see if the taste improves and whether the bottle I tried was spoiled."
"This is an interesting beer and a difficult one to review. Even as a 'pale IPA' (no caramel malt- which is quite legit) it seems to miss the mark by using a very neutral base malt, fairly clean yeast and not enough hops. On the other hand it is a refreshing and crisp beer that is pleasant to drink. In trying to be fair I am giving this one a high drinkability rating."
"Now Unfiltered! Flavorful and drinkable all around. Easy to sit around and have a few of these. Some fruity flavors chime in here and there which is nice to see. A nice change of pace in the face of all the hop bombs that are being brewed lately."
"Not bad, just ""curious"" enough to leave it off my own ""recommended"" list."
"This is a very good IPA IMO."
"Pours a beautiful copper with white head. Tasted hoppy. Not the hoppiest I've had, but just enough that it went great with the General Tso's chicken I was eating at the time. I couldve had a few more of these, and will definitely be purchasing this one again. Goes great with spicy food!"
"Light golden/copper with a nice head of white foam. Aromas are of sweet malts, and subtle hops. Certainly not a very HOPPY aroma. Taste is slightly sweet, malty, and more ESB like than IPA like, this is definately not one of the hoppiest beers in the state. It wasn't even one of the hoppiest beers of the night! Mouthfeel is decent, drinkability is OK. Not very impressive."
"This was a VERY good beer, one I would gladly drink several of if the opportunity arose."
"Medium bodied, there are better local IPAs but this is solid."
"This is not an over-the-top style IPA. Rather, this is a tasty English IPA style from a solid microbrewery in VT."
"Drinkable for the style, but I wouldn't waste my time having another one. This is just a very bland beer IMO; something to pass on."
"Not a true IPA."
"While there's a little bite to this IPA, it is not a particularly robust or hoppy entry into the American micro market, which makes it most decidedly an English IPA. It pours a light orange amber. The aroma has some citrus and hops, but it is fairly light. The taste is undistinguished: fluttering malts, a touch of hops, with some lemon and pine in the background and offset by mellow carbonation. Smooth and drinkable, but thin."
"This is an easy drinking, mellow brew, but it is definitely not ""one of the HOPPIEST brews in the states."""
"12 ounce bottle, with bottled on date of 5 wks ago, FRESH!. Pours amber, with some orangy, golden hues, white head and leaves some fine lacing. nose is hops and grapefruit. Fairly thin tasting IPA. Fairly hoppy, and griany but too watery and lacking in a nice juicy center. what were left with is a decent tasting brew, but not quite an IPA. Tastes more like a hoppy summer brew."
"A very intersting IPA, to say the least. I'm glad this is the only bottle of this one that I brought back from Vermont."
"amber with a white head that doesn't hang around. floral and slightly piney hoppy aroma with sweeter grainy malt characteristics as well. nothing special with the taste, seems a little off balance with hops dominating, usually not a bad thing, but it doesn't work well here. there's not enough else to make it satisfying. a little thin bodied, but not watery enough to ruin anything. a decent beer that i'm not gonna go out of my way for, but if in vermont and i see it on tap i will probably give it another try."
"7/24/04 - Wow, I had never tried their IPA and I have to admit I was really impressed. The label on the bottle announces it as ""one of the hoppiest beers we know"" and I was sort of hesitant but I gave it a shot. I loved this beer, it had a clean amber appearance and a great hop aroma. It really was a very hoppy beer with that great tongue lashing that lets knows you are getting a well brewed IPA. I need to find it on tap or head up to VT and check it out straight from the brewery."
"I used to hold this brew in higher esteem, I will have to try again soon just to make sure this wasn't just a bad batch."
"Long Trail India Pale Ale is a letdown. It isn't terrible beer, but it commits three major IPA sins: too low on hops, noticeable alcohol and a too-light body. Thanks to a great BA, mikeys01, for the bottle."
"Beer pours as a nice golden amber color with a good sized nice off white head that takes its time fading away to lacing. The smell is of what I believe to be spice and fruit, very pleasant. The taste is very hoppy on my pallet and over all good for an India. Can say that it is my least favorite from the mixed 12 pack, but over all it is not a bad beer, would not turn one down! Dont think that I would go out just to purchase this brew, but having it once in a while would not be bad!"
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy white head that eventually fades to lacing. The aroma is of hops and carapils malts. There seems to be a slight maltiness too it that balances nicely with the hops. It's a mild hop scent. The taste is decent. It is a bitter beer with good hop flavor. It is a bit piney, but not too bad. It also mixes well with the malt palate. The mouthfeel is not bad. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good sessions ale; a decent IPA."
"Long Trail Brewing Company has produced a good IPA, though not one that I'd drive to the New England to buy again. LT pours amber with a thin, off-white head. Its aroma is quite sharp and pleasant, reminding me of my mother's spice cabinet from years ago. It starts crisp with plenty of hoppy goodness and a bit cinnamon flavor. It is medium to full bodied without even the slightest bit of smooth character. The fact of the matter is, it's obviously hopped to the point of no return. The finish is dry, abrasive, and *very* bitter."
"Finally, an IPA that even I can like. This probably tastes like dog water to real hop heads."
"Light honey color with a low, beige, frothy head. Fine lacing down the glass as I drink. Aroma is low, but floral hop and sweet fruit can be detected. Flavor is delicate, with a surprisingly low hop profile, some pear and apple, and a piney finish. Lingering aftertaste is a bit metallic, which detracts overall. Many other stronger IPA's to choose from."
"Dirty white head that left a good amount of lacing. The smell is along the lines of sweet butterscotch hops. Light copper colored beer, nice and clear. There is a lot of diacetyl in the flavor with a little bit of citrus hops, and a lightly bitter aftertaste. The body is middle of the road, and fairly light. I prefer a bit more hopiness in my IPAs. It's not bad, just not all that great."
"Not my type of IPA...I generally like the beers this brewery makes but I would not buy this again.."
"Gotta thank my sis in one of these reviews. She picked up a case of mixed Vermont beers for me on her travels out East and this is the last I have to review from it."
"Nice hoppy aroma and decent color..dark yellow gold. Very nice hop smell with a semi-tart taste that lingers just the right amount of time. Hopped, but not to the point of distraction. Mouthfeel is smooth with enough body to be well-rounded. Not the hoppiest IPA, but very drinkable."
"Pours a pale amber with a small white head. One of the most hoppy brews in the states? Naw. But the hops are quite up front and tasty. a decent brew, but not an ipa to call friends about. stick with one of the maltier brews offered by long trail. . ."
"The taste is sweet, light crystal malt and upfront with hop bitterness that takes over as if an aggressive hop was used for bittering but not flavor. This makes it seem to have the bitterness, but not alot of hop taste. The taste of hops comes at the end where a sticky hop lasts to the end. The malt is over ruled. Very interesting in how this happens. When looking at specs, Pale ale and IPA have an overlap between high and low of the IBU's. This beer sits in that range, which appeals to me as a Pale Ale fan. Beef up the malt and not the ABV and this be great. Otherwise its good and I enjoyed it."
"NOT ""one of the HOPPIEST brews in the States," but definitely a drinkable IPA with a healthy wallop of bitterness that sits on the front rather than the back of the tongue. Some slightly citric resinous hop flavor, but also a lot of earthy bitterness as well. The malt is slightly grainy/husky, but has some slight, rather decoction-like sweetness. The finish is bitter, green apple/Thompson's Seedless grape skin and a whiff of alcohol. Seems to be a lot closer to an English IPA than a typical American IPA, but lacks some of the body & mouthfeel."
"This is easily the most average IPA I've had to date. The appearance was a little paler than I would have liked. It smelled ok, I've smelt better and worse beers. The taste had some hops and some malt, but they were just kind of there, they weren't really adding anything to this beer. I had no problem drinking this, but it did not make me want to drink more. I don't know exactly what it is but this beer just didn't do it for me. I didn't really like it, but at the same time there was nothing that I flat out didn't like about it. I just found it offered nothing new, interesting, or particularly good. At the same time there was nothing there that I really disliked. If I could be apathetic about a beer, I guess this would be that beer."
"I have to guess that this is part of a mistake-batch. The appearrance is fine, amber with a nice head, the bubbles are a little big. Smell has a little caramel and some hop spice. Taste - One of the hoppiest brews? no. one of the wateriest brews, yes. wicked thin mouthfeel, horrible aftertaste. If I could pick up any real evidence of spoilage I would not review it, but this is just sad. To call this an IPA is strange. I can tell you what would I call it, but...."
"An average pour delivered by Long Trail's IPA.Some white lacing and a light gold color.A light bodied IPA with a crisp mouthfeel.A long bitter and wheat finish.Not as hoppy as I would of thought.The neck label states it is ""one of the hoppiest brews in the states"".I doubt it can beat Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale for that tile.Citrus,malt,grapefruit are noted on the taste.Very good hop aroma and taste.An overall well crafted IPA.Well balanced but nothing exceptional.Pine taste with a real hop bitterness,and a dry finish."
"A nice IPA for those that may be discovering the style. Pours with a nice white head, giving way to a finely bubbled lace. Settles into a beautiful clear golden hue. Nose is a mixture of fresh hops & slightly biscuity malts, first taste is hops, some medium-bodied malt, and a nice crisp hop finish. I find this to be quite drinkable without being a hop-monster or highly alcoholic...not that I have a problem with those! On par with Harpoons version of an IPA. Good brewery, BTW, try the Double Bag ale!"
"Clear, golden color with a nice rocky head.  Aroma is all hops, and a long-lasting hop bitterness. Very one-dimentional, however.  Needs something to contrast the hops.  Worth a try, but not great."
"Notes: I've reviewed this brew before, and made mention that the hops overwhelms the malt. It still holds true. This brew, by no means, is a bad brew. It's simply that the hops selected for this brew tend to dominate, snuff out a nice malt profile, and linger too long. Still very much worth a try."
