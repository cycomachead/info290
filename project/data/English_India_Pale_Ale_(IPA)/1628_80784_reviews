"A decent beer, my first from this brewhouse. Color is a cloudy deep orange. Lots of malt sweetness at first and then it releases the hops, not too much, though. More hops come out as you progress throught the brew. Carbonation is good and maintains throughout the drinking process. Would like to have had more hop bitterness but I assume this is a pretty accurate English style beer"

"Drinkable, but English IPA? More like English Ale done with (heavy) American IPA proportions. Very B-."
"I'm pouring this into a plastic cup and it looks way too good for a plastic cup. Clear golden orange amber with a pure white head that has a good size and healthy retention. Beer stays covered all the way down. Nose suffers from the vessel but still has a delightful olfactory presence. Excellent malt presence and superb balance of caramel and grains. Hops are earthy and firm giving a mellower take on the American IPA signature while remaining quite hoppy. Taste is something that seems requires sophistication given the markedly different style British IPA are from American. The malt is lovely and multilayered with breads lightly toasted, light caramel sweetness, a mild English yeast fruitiness, covered by strong hops. Hops are earthy, (Fuggles I think) with a resiny oiliness that lingers cleanly. Some biscuit on the palate that makes me think Maris Otter malt as well. Feel is crisp  with an exceptionally drinkable weight. Carbonation is lively keeping it delightful on the tongue. This is a great beer that seems to be lost on a Neanderthal expectation of hops smakdown in a style that doesn't warrant it. It's hoppy while being decidedly reserved in the British tradition."
"Appearance/color good on pour (amber). Not much head. Smell is okay, but not really what I would consider typical of a good, craft IPA (ala Dogfish Head 60, Stone, BP Sculpin, or Lagunitas). Not really hoppy either. Would likely have a more mainstream appeal than to a hop-head or someone with a taste for a solid IPA. The closest comparison that I have would be Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale."

"No hints of alcohol and certainly not an american IPA. This is a well balanced beer. I find it enjoyable and extremely easy to drink. Well made just dont expect to get hop smacked and you wont be disappointed."

"An American interpretation of an English IPA, but besides of the US citrusy and a soft tartness, it ended up with milder flavors than the original reference."

"I like the concept, had a few burton IPAs over in England; this just seems like a very muted version, drinkable, but not worth buying"

"Remarks: very smooth and balanced; not in your face hop bite, but enough to know it's an IPA without overwhelming the maltiness"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 5/23/2013. Pours slightly cloudy orange copper color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange zest, grapefruit, pear, floral, caramel, toast, bread, grass, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop and malt notes; with fairly weak strength. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, pear, apple, caramel, toast, brown bread, floral, pine, grass, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, caramel, brown bread, toast, pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of hop and malt flavors with light yeast fruitiness; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good English IPA style. Nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Poured into a standard pint glass a clear light golden with a creamy-like thin top that did last through the duration of me drinking it.Aromas of biscuit malt,toast,and faint mineral with not much hop presence,still not bad for the style it is.Toasted grain and caramel toffee flavors with more of that light mineral element in the finish,again just a light leafy hops presence.You know for what it is it's not bad,don't expect a big hopped up IPA,it's not supposed to be."

"O/D-Did not like this one very much. Needs more hop! A bland cup of suds."

"Beer has a medium to medium-light body with carbonation of medium to medium-low intensity, leading to a feeling of sluggish, faint foaminess and slight wateriness. Closes quite dry, with low stickiness clinging to the palate after each sip."

"Tawny amber with a slight haziness. A definite mineral edge pops out first followed by a warm biscuit and sourdough maltiness. Hops give some peachy fruitiness along with some herbal and woody notes. Bitterness is sharp, accentuated by the mineral qualities. Very enjoyable for what it is, which is a great attempt at an historical style. Don't expect a modern IPA and you won't be dissappointed."
"Overall an enjoyable malt forward IPA."
"Overall whats the difference between this and their regular IPA? Maybe it's just the medium/thicker body that impairs drink ability but to me they taste exactly the same..."
""
"Pours hazy copper/bronze. Light layer white foam. Mild pine nose, very light. Taste has a mild bitter, a little gritty and annoying. Very firm bitter finish. Even keeled, but not remarkable."

"This is definitely an English ipa. I don't know if it's the beer that's lacking or the continued bombardment of my taste buds that is hampering my judgement. The beer has a thick malt base, though I'd probably say a bit too much really. Hop influence is calm. For an English ipa it works. On this one, it sorta works."
"notes:"
"On the whole a nice bitter beer, good with food. I prefer the AIPA style, but this is a pretty good take on an English IPA"

"Stopped by the publick house for a bite and to pick up some IRS bottles. Ordered a flight with bratwurst. Brew arrivedin a few ounce sample pour. Transparent orange yellow.. Smells of watered down hops. Tastes like an english ipa...which tastes to me like an old ipa. Bitterness is on the finish only. Easy drinking but when i want an ipa i like more of a hop assault."
""
"D - Nicely done, a little lacking in the hop character but otherwise quite appropriately British."
""
"Very thin head but nice lacing on a orange golden body. Very woody, mostly cedar and also very nutty with toasted bread and malts fr aroma. Flavors of English malt and yeast, very toasty buscuity and nutty but lightly hopped with an abrupt finish with the flavor being cut off immediately. Medium body and moderate carbonation, a little oily. The English character is excellent. Needs more hops even for the style it is under hopped."
""
"Overall â€“ A nice EIPA. I'm a much bigger fan of the American IPA, but this is still a tasty beer. Not something I'd rush out to buy more of, but still nice to have tried."
""
"Very balanced and easy drinking. A competent English IPA."
""
"An enjoyable English IPA. The taste was just a bit one dimensional in my opinion, but I would be willing to have another of these sometime."
""
"Pours with an amber color, crystal clear with desent carbonation. The head is smallish and white leaving some lacing. Aroma is mostly malt based with hints of hops and minerals. Taste is really good. Balance malts and hops that have a bitter and sweet aspect, sweet and sour. A very good EIPA"
""
"Not sure how this compares to the original Burton IPA, but the taste is close to what I expected after reading about them. Seek this one out if you want to see what the classic Burton IPA was like. However, don't expect it to be anything like the American IPA we have all come to love."

"O. Nice and flavorful. Nothing that really jumps outs except that it is a fruity IPA."

"D: i feel like this example may not have been the freshest, but it is a shame when there is no bottle conditioning to let the customer know! the acetaldehyde in the nose definitely threw me off as i felt some late kettle, or even dry hopping, additions would have really helped this brew out. not a great example of a not so great style to begin with."

"Pale orange in color with excellent clarity. Poured with a short white foam that reduced to a wispy, soapy cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass. Resinous pine and ripe citrus orange hop aromas with sweet caramel malt in the background. Creamy smooth feel with rich carbonation. Pine hop flavors are dominant throughout. Ripe citrus orange and pungent floral hop flavors up front and thru the middle with a sweet caramel malt bacbone. Finishes with a lingering pine hop bitterness."
"The body was smooth, even and well balanced. Drinkability was excellent, I could easily drink these all afternoon. Overall, a very nice take on the style. This is a must try if you see it."

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours clear golden with a white head and plentiful streaming bubbles. The head dissipates slowly as expected with this style. The aroma is a nice blend of sweet and bready malts with some earthy and citrus hops. The malt brings a toasted bread flavor with back end earthy bitterness from the hops. There is some citrus in the flavor as well, but this is mild. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is high. This is a good beer that is solid and true to style."
"Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a light golden orange amber. One finger fine white head with good retention and lacing. Looks good. Light aroma of pineapple and light caramel malt, not much hops present. Flavor is mild bready and light toasted malt, light citrus hops, low key, but well integrated. Mild citrus and hop aftertaste. The citrus has a mild astringent effect that slightly marrs the flavor. A bit of pleasant earthy spiciness developed in the finish as the beer warmed. Medium bodied. A mild English style ale that may well be true to style; unfortunately I've never had the chance to try a try early 20th century IPA, but this seems like it would be in character."

"an original IPA as an 18 yo many years ago and thinking ""what a bitter useless beer"". Boy how times have changed!"
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops are present. Taste is bitter, some piney hops, a bit of malts, not a lot of flavor other than bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall I found this to be a mediocre beer."

"Not my favorite style by a long shot but Southampton did a good job replicating an EPA/EIPA"
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink but seems like it could use a little more malts and a little less minerals."
"Poured a clear copper color, with a small cap of white head. Aroma of bready malts, dull distant hops. Hmm...my fears of a malt-heavy IPA were confirmed on the taste. Toasty grains, nutshells, mild leafy and earthy hops. Fairly and smooth for the style, but not very flavorful or balanced. Solid overall but nothing tremendous. Aka, a British-style ale."
"O - good example of the style."
""
"O- Pretty good, but didn't meet my expectations which were quite high."
"O: This is only OK by me. I've generally been pretty happy with Southampton's beers, but this one leaves me a little flat. I had a Middle Ages English IPA right before this one, and that one may have had an impact on how I viewed this one, as it was more American in style, and I liked it better."
