This IPA tasted like hops mixed with vomit. Ok.... I might be a little too harsh here, but it was lacking severely. It's like an ingredient was left out. The potential was there, but never arrived. Almost like a sneeze that dies out right before it happens. Very disappointed with my choice, even more so since they had some fine Great Lakes beer on tap. STAY AWAY.","Seanem44","May 27, 2014"

4.17,27.5,3.75,4.25,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Overall, the best thing about this beer was its flavoring. We had a bit of a shock when we first opened this beer, took a whiff, and sipped it because, generally speaking, it has that same luster of fresh hoppy goodness possessed by both Sucks and Heady Topper. Things were fruity, fresh, and confidently smooth, and it tasted just like it smelled. The hops throughout were thickly resinous and heady, with sticky oiliness that went on for days. That said, as the beer warmed, and with a second serving of it, it began to fade. The edges seemed just a bit cheaper, with more metallics and less smoothness to the sip. That said, we were transiently enhanced by this one, but it just didn’t seem to possess that reproducibility and longevity that keeps you coming back to your favorite beers time and time again.","TheBrewo","Nov 19, 2013"

Great for introducing someone to a simple basic IPA.","ny101","Oct 02, 2013"

3.74,14.4,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Overall - A light IPA, crisp citrus and refreshing. I am not seeing most of the same negative qualities on some of the older review, again I am guessing this is a reformulation attempt. I did notice that it is a little on the tart side, but otherwise this is a decent brew. Would not recommend this one to hop heads necessarily and if I did I would call the hops lemonade hops, not really my favorite style.","JMScowcroft","May 22, 2013"
3.75,14.7,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"O: Decent. Better than I expected, to be honest, given the reviews here and the reputation of this brewer. Maybe I got one that's uber-fresh (I'll check the bottle for dating info). I bought a single bottle at Price Chopper and doubt I'd buy a full sixer of this (there are so many IPAs that I like better than this), but I'm not unhappy with the purchase at all.","Kendo","May 22, 2013"

What head there is does stick around as a light swirl and leaves some scant lacing. Light notes of citrus and paraffin in the nose, and not much else. Undercarbonated, and frankly, the beer seems unfinished with some raw wort notes of a sweet graininess and a bit of acrid bitterness. A tad grainy as well and generally it has flavors that can only be described as murky. There are some faint citrus flavors of lime and orange, but they're generally lost in the muddle.

The beer itself is pretty drinkable, even though I was not too impressed by this by this beer. I was expecting more hops in the taste, but they just were not there.","maddogruss","May 19, 2007"

3.7,13.1,4,4,3.5,3,4,"I thought this was an English style IPA and research shows this to be the correct case. I think this is underated because people get a drier, pale plus hopped ale. This is somewhat leaf dry astringency and on the bitter side, it is malted to ease drinkability and nicely done.Lace and small head on orange.","Sammy","Mar 07, 2007"

3.95,20.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Had this brew at philly craft fest- wish i had heard of this brewery before- very nice E-IPA aromas, subtle citrusy hops with a malt backbone to back it up. The malts are slightly sweet with medium body, while the hops settle in on the end for a refreshing floral aftertaste. Not overly dry on the backend. Great flavors and mild taste make this a session IPA that will not destroy your palate.","kernalklink","0"
3.68,12.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I may have had a different expectation going in when I ordered this one. Anything labeled hopnotic would seem to imply being punched in the face with hops. Kind of a misnomer, but a good English IPA. I enjoyed it.","IgnatiusReilly","Nov 27, 2006"
3.97,21.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"2nd offering from this brewery. Somewhat hazy golden color. Nice sized head on top-decent carbonation level. Good grassy and citrusy aroma. Flavor does much to mirror the aroma-very nice. Quite grassy and grapefruit like. Not a full frontal hop assault but enough presence to make the whole package enjoyable. Some good lingering malt sweetness. Good body. Overall an enjoyable pale. I am suitably impressed for a brewery I have heard very little about. Nice job.","lackenhauser","Oct 31, 2006"
3.63,11,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured from a 12oz bottle I got from an in person trade with silks636 on a wedding trip to NJ. No freshness date on the bottle but it was fine. Appearance was good a nice pale hazy orange straw color. Nice fluffy white head that dissipated rather slowly. Nice lacing down the glass. Smells very floral with hints of citrus especially grapefruit scents. Slight malt hint in the back of the nose. Taste is very fresh, crisp and clean. Well carbonated with a nice flowing hop flavor. Milder hop bite but it builds as it goes down. Nice dry hop finish with many well constructed flavors. Nice aromatic IPA with good drinkability and taste. This is an enjoyable beer worth giving it a try if you like milder IPA's. Not a very overpowering hop flavor making it a very drinkable beer. I would consider drinking it quite often if I could find it near me. I would think it would make a decent all around everyday IPA.","bigone4","Oct 27, 2006"
4.1,25.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Slightly hazy peach juice with rocky snow-white head. Moderate and steady carbonation. Nice mild aromas of apricots and orange peels with a slight spruce sap scent lingering in the background amongst the faintest traces of sweet malts. Bitter orange flavors begin the sip, rounding out to a sharp mineral middle. Some crystal malt sweetness comes through near the finish, along with more citric hops, lending a fresh-squeezed orange juice quality to the final aspect of the flavor. Thin-to-medium body, overall juicy mouthfeel, somewhat sharp and off-dry. This really isn't a very ""complex"" IPA, but I think that's actually a very fine thing to be. Sometimes I don't want to be clobbered with astounding flavor profiles (and, of course, sometimes I really do!). It's refreshing to find a straightforward, solid-drinking IPA like this. I'm glad the nice folks at Oak Tree in South Plainfield, NJ, hipped me to this beer when they included a free Cricket Hill shaker pint with my last purchase (which I used to drink Hopnotic IPA, naturally). Anyway, this seems to be a pretty underrated beer, and it has my thorough recommendation.","orfeu","Oct 15, 2006"
3.88,18.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Cricket Hill's Hopnotic IPA is quality beer and is a more than credible version of the English IPA style. I could just as easily have granted the higher flavor score since I'm enjoying the bottom half of the bottle even more than the top half. What the hell. This is a well-brewed beer that is disappearing remarkably quickly. I thing I'll reward it accordingly.","BuckeyeNation","Sep 08, 2006"

3.07,-6.1,3,3.5,3,2.5,3,"Cloudy, honey golden pour with a head that dies on contact. Nose of hops and lemon. Tastes woody, with soome slight hops, but not really bitter at all.

Smooth and oily mouthfeel with not much aftertaste--malts are more lingering than hops. Carbonation is pretty good and not too pronounced. Drinkability is high as its an easy drinker. Pretty good, but there are better.","bjohnson","Jan 07, 2006"
3.6,10.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I think I like the cricket better than the brews themselves, but this was a decent IPA. Had the necessary hoppy and citrus kicks with a fair amount of sweet malts, a decent frothy mouthfeel, and was very easy to drink. But it lacked depth for me. I'd love to have a sixer or two in the back of my fridge for everyday, thirst-quenching drinking, but I wouldn't order it if I went out. Still, nothing to frown at.","scooter231","Jan 05, 2006"
3.22,-1.5,3,3.5,3,4,3,"12 ounce bottle. Cricket Hill IPA pours out a dirty looking orange brown color with a medium head. The aroma is fruity and herbal with just a hint of hops. The flavor starts out sweet and fruity, with lemons and peaches. Herbal, grassy flavors come in a the middle. This beer is not very hoppy at all. The mouthfeel is medium and there is a pleasant level of carbonation. A little buttery. Drinkability is average. Mediocre pale ale.","beveragecaptain","Dec 11, 2005"

3.11,-4.9,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3,"amber bottle with bottled on date blank??. Poured a hazy medium amber color with slight white head. Smell is sweet and slightly fruity, totally lacking in hops. Smell is not very pleasnt at all, and each taste reminds me of it. Taste is very dry and bitter, with a low-level maltiness trying to break through. Finished th more dry bitterness. Not too good a beer. My first beer from ricket Hill and I'm very dissapointed.","tgbljb","Aug 15, 2005"

A little doughy on the nose. The flavor is sweet and spicy. Slighty bitter and not very hoppy at all. Sweet doughy tones dominate. And pepper yeastiness comes into play as well. Decent tasting beverage, but not what I would call an EIPA by any means.","Bighuge","Dec 11, 2004"
4.1,25.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Although this beer is proclaimed as an English style IPA, it could just as easily pass as an American Pale Ale! It's slightly hazy, golden-orange body is capped by a frothy head of bright white; and bright, resinous, grassy, and citrusy hops (reminiscent of Nugget) greet you in the nose! In the mouth, it's medium bodied with a median carbonation level and fine bubbles that leave it smooth and gently creamy across the palate. The flavor is as might be suspected given the hoppy nose.... it's resinous, grassy, floral and mildly citrusy hops are interwoven throughout a blanket of bready and biscuity malt. The balance is impeccable, with hop and malt teetering back and forth over a solid support beam of bitterness! It finishes drying as a wave of it's hop-infused maltiness receeds to reveal the few sparkling gems of hop flavor still left on the palate. Quite drinkable!","NeroFiddled","Beers"

Fruity and yeasty nose is replaced by lots of bitter smelling hops...perhapd some Amarillo & Cascades here. Some brief malt sweetness is washed away by lightly biscuity flavors then loads of hops. The hop bitterness is abundant and quite aggressive. The finish is long and bitter, with a fruity quality coming thru the hops at the tail end. This is for sure a hophead's quaffer.","beerluvr","Aug 30, 2004"
2.96,-9.5,3.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"This poured out a clear golden yellow color with about 3 fingers worth of fluffy white foam. The head drops rapidly leaving some lacing about the glass as it does. Aroma is fairly mild with floral and earthy hops dominating and notes of citric hops are present as well. The taste seems fairly balanced with sweet malt being met by earth grassy hops blow for blow. A little too much emphasis on the malt in the taste but a pleasant mild taste now the less. The after taste is a bit dry and has a slight bitterness to it. The body is medium to light with a smooth creamy feel to it. This has decent drinkability with the mildness of it and nothing inherently flawed except the malt concentration. Not a bad beer but nothing to get excited over. Thanks for the brew Lupe and BIF 14.","meathookjones","Aug 13, 2004"
