"Just an outstanding take on the English IPA. Underrated IMO due to the expectations many have for an American IPA. Subtle."

"O - A good IPA.  I prefer the American style better though"
""
"Easy drinking ipa. Hoppy."

"Overall, this is a good, albeit fairly run of the mill, English IPA. Nice earthiness from the hops but lacks a bit of the maltiness complexity found in other examples. All in all a good beer."

"O- This is a bland, non descript ale with no complexity. After a couple of attempts at this one, I finally decided to pour this down the drain while remembering I had a Lagunitas on hand."
"O: Well done version of a traditional English IPA. Been a while since Iâ€™ve had this style, so its fun to recalibrate from the American spins on this classic. Well done."

"Not a bad IPA, for a local beer glad I finally got to try this one. I'm not a huge fan of the English-style IPA but this one is pretty tasty. I'd have another,"

"O- A very solid, sessionable IPA from one of Asheville's mainstay breweries. I like that they go the English route while a lot of other Asheville breweries do a decent American style IPA but they all end up tasting the same for whatever reason. This one sticks out."
""

"O - nice offering if not world changing."

"Came out a murky dark amber with a slight reddish hue on the edges. A large creamy beige head rested on top. Pretty lace sticks around. The nose pretty basic for the style. Some minor floral tones, mild citrus, and a sweet balanced finish. The body had moderate depth; decent carbonation. Easy drinker. Not too filling. Not a sharp IPA by any means. The hops are tamed down a bit. Well-balanced with toffee sweetness and mild citrus flavors."

""
""
""
""
"Overall: a beer that would do well if you are in the mood for a herbal/ crystal taste. But needs more distinction in its malt to hop profiles"
""

"Floral hoppyness, copper amber color, light head that lingered on the edge more than 3/4 of the glass. I will be seeking the beer out again. I am in Asheville NC for a conference, you can bet I will be doing all I can to find this beer in San Diego CA when I return home."
"O - Good representation of this style for sure. Well balanced."
""
""
"O: Overall a very good English-style IPA."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is an interesting and enjoyable ipa that is for the most part middle of the road, but without fault as well."
""
""
""
"Nothing special here, but a decent choice if you're a hophead. A nicely done, well balance IPA. It isn't a standout knock em out of the park brew, but for sitting around shooting the breeze and craving some hops, it gets the job done. Worth a try if you see it on tap somewhere."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. I'm pretty sure it was my first English IPA. If blindfolded, I would've been convinced it was an English Pale Ale by smell and just as equally convinced it was a piney American IPA by taste. I would definitely have this again."
"Mouthfeel is good medium body and small bubble carbonation give this a medium feel. Lots of hoppy resin and oil leave this slightly sticky."
""
""
"Overall not a bad try on the style not big fan of the English IPA's but this one is pretty well done."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a slightly hazed, auburn-copper coloring with a thin, filmy, bright white head that starts around a half an inch and settles quickly into a surface coat. Nose of biscuit and toffee in the backbone, with a sharp, tart, grapefruit character and some floral highlights. Smells bright and light. Flavors are bitter and tart forward, with grapefruit notes abound. Solid roasted toffee backbone, with a rich sweetness. Very well balanced, and some peppery notes at the end of the palate. Spiced and resiny bitter aftertaste on a light, smooth body. The beer has a crisp, drying finish. Very balanced and very solid. Good beer."

"Flavor is great and I keep coming back to it. Give it a try with the green at Tupelo Honey!"

"I'd put this in my fridge."

"Definitely an English IPA. Pours a copper color with minimal head. Smell is earthy, grassy, slightly sweet. Taste is also earthy - clay mixed with a bit of swamp water. Nice mouthfeel! Overall, this beer leaves a lot to be desired and this reviewer feels it's average, at best. Try something else."
"It's a solid English IPA, but the hop profile seems a bit off. Herbal and earthy without enough malt balance to keep it in check."

"O: The herbal and grassy flavors of this IPA make it a refreshing change of pace compared to the other traditional hops used in other beers in the style."
""
""
""
"O: a pretty standard English IPA."
""
""
""

"O - Very well balanced, smooth, fantastically drinkable. Nothing to crazy but just extremely well balanced in every way, great beer."

"O: very nice combination of the hop flavor of an IPA while also being a medium body beer it makes for a good combo unlike some other local IPAs where I feel the hops are designed for sensory overload and cause me to have a lingering aftertaste."

"The mouthfeel was medium with adequate carbonation. Solid."

"Reviewed from notes taken from serving at the Asheville Airport. Served way to cold, but as it warmed up, it showed its stuff beautifully."

"Just spent some time in Chicago drinking tons of 3 Floyd's alpha king and this beer compares remarkably well. Impressive."
"Surprised and impressed with this one - Triangle beer drinkers seek this one out!"
"Definitely worth trying if you like the style. I enjoyed this IPA and am looking forward to more growlers from these brewers."
"Not an awful beer. Definitely not what I was expecting. Malt character caught me off guard and the hop character was a little mild for my preference."
"Poured into a 12 Oz pilsner-like glass at vbgb in charlotte. Amber in color. Medium head and retention. Aroma is mild grass and mild caramel malt. Listed as an English ipa and it's obvious there isn't anything American in style about it. Taste is mild bitterness, touch of malt sweetness. Nothing over the top but quite drinkable. I would think this is a good gateway ipa."
"O. An ok ipa, go for their esb not this."
"Had while sitting at the brewery on a recent trip to Asheville. Served from cask into a Green Man shaker. Poured a slightly hazy red-orange with a one and a half finger bone white head that subsided to a one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bitter hop, citrus hop, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, bitter hop, and slight citrus. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice IPA. Definitely had a pretty nice citrus aspect going on in this one. I just wish the flavor would have been a little more robust in the citrus aspect. This one is definitely worth trying if you are in the area."
"On-tap at Jack of the Wood, in a shaker pint. Mostly clear dark orange with thin off-white head leaving a ring of fine lace. Smell: earthy, peach tea, slight grapefruit, lots of caramel. Taste: fruiy - peach and orange - herbal spiciness, a little grapefruit rind. Big toffee backbone. Nice lingering bitterness. Solid carbonation. A nice English-American IPA hybrid."
"Nope, not like this at all. Beer is thin and has nearly no hop flavor, some malt on the lead off but overall the beer is just a gross mess of off flavors. Why am I drinking this? Well I'm not anymore."
"The beer appears clear and orange in color, with a half inch of head that leaves some decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is odd, with scents of hops and weird herbal notes. The flavor brings more of the same, with a prominent taste of overly cooked vegetables. The beer is out of balance and off putting. An astringent bitter taste lingers on the tongue. Not recommended."
"d - Not a very good IPA. Smell and taste seemed to have a lot of grain/bready malts to it, as well as a small amount of vegetables, which I did not enjoy. Wouldn't seek out again."
"Pours a light copper color with a single-finger white head and a bit of lacing as it slowly falls down my glass. The nose brings forward some light malt and English hops--maybe grassy and herbal--but along with that comes a bit of an off care and slight vegetal notes. The taste is similarly lacking in any hop component and simply has a mild graininess with a bit of vegetable skin. Mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation for the serving type. Drinkability is not particularly good. I would not say that there were any straight-out flaws or off-flavors with this beer, just that there was nearly nothing in the way of hop or malt character to really hide any flaws."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. If I wasn't planning on driving home I would have drank a couple more of these. I loved it. I can't wait to drink more of this beer and more from Green Man Ales and Brewery."
"Green Man IPA pours amber and very clear, not a whole lot of head (but I had it on draught, and the bar tender wasn't trying to create any head). I couldn't smell a whole lot, but the taste was huge and delicious. It almost had a dirty rawness...similar to the Green Man ESB. There was so much flavor and it was surprisingly well rounded for a local place. This was the second sampling that I've tried from this brewery, and I have really enjoyed it both times. There is a nice bite, with a pleasant sweetness/bitterness combo. There was so much flavor in this beer that I wouldn't call it easy drinking, but I want to want more of it."
"The body had moderate depth; decent carbonation. Easy drinker. Not too filling. Not a sharp IPA by any means. The hops are tamed down a bit. Well-balanced with toffee sweetness and mild citrus flavors. This is not a 'hop-heads' IPA, but it is easily accessible and good. I liked it."
"Overall a really solid IPA and a great example of the style."
"Nothing special here, but it was a nice enough beer to have with some good pizza."
"pint at the brewery tasting room"
"Overall impression: Maybe I'll give this one another try, because it's hard to believe it would sell tasting like this all the time."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable and smooth; quite versatile as a sipping beer or with a meal. Try the cask over the tap if the choice presents itself"
"Another easy session beer."
"drinkability: good"
"On tap at 12 Bones barbeque joint in Asheville. The brew arrives as a mildly hazed copper amber with a small offwhite head. Nice sticky lacing is left on the glass. Aroma opens with pink grapefruit, quickly seguing into herbal and grassy hops with a hint of toasty caramel. Smooth and well balanced, with a medium body. Taste has a floral, grassy, and herbal hops bitterness that is balanced very well by a subdued toasty and caramel biscuity maltiness. Supremely well balanced even though the hops run the show. Wow! This one is a pleasant surprise. Very enjoyable, and ideal with the blueberry chipotle sauced rack of ribs."
"64oz growler from Bruisin' Ales into a Le Merle tulip glass pours a crisp dark orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a decent amount of Earthy hops (a hint of pine) and biscuity malts. The taste is a decent balance of Earthy hops and sweet malts, almost more like a standard Pale Ale, but the beer does leave a nice bitter hoppy finish. The beer is on the light side of medium with a touch of dryness and decent carbonation. This one is somewhat enjoyable, but I must say it's the weakest Asheville IPA I've had yet, and I've now had them all, at least until the next one comes around."
"Overall this is a solid English IPA, though it's nothing special. Very drinkable, and worth a shot if you're in the area."
"Drinkability: A pleasant surprise!! It was the end of the evening, we were wandering, not expecting to find anything ... and I came across this. It's not the world's best IPA, but it's a low abv%, tasty, sessionable brew, interesting and local, and I'm very glad to have tried it."
"A friend picked up a growler while over in A-ville and shared with me yesterday.Poured into a standard pint glass a clear copper with a tight 1/2 finger slight off white head,English IPA aromas more leafy with a hefty dose of biscuit malt.Slightly grainy mouthfeel,English character on the palate as well a hefty lightly sweet biscuit malt flavor dominates up front than it melds into a leafy somewhat herbal/minty hop finish.If your a big fan of the more subtle English variety IPA youll like this alot,for me it was ok."
"This one pours a nice amber in color with good carbonation and excellent lacing down the glass. Smell is a good balance of hops and malt. Somewhat piney and earthy with hints of citrus in there as well but malts are about as pronounced. Caramel malts and I notice the honey sweetness as the beer is described to have. Mouthfeel isn't overly bitter and pretty light. Not too drying and not the same feeling as an English or American IPA. Good drinkability but it gets you easier than the Porter will. A nice take on the English version of the IPA. I enjoyed it."
"I love ipas, but I wasn't impressed with this one. It started well enough with a nice pour, amber with a very good head, some nice retention, and a bit of lacing. The aromas were thin and grainy with a touch of bitter hops. A bit of sweetness as well, but not really integrated. Taste was similar. A thinly carbonated hop tea with no real malt nalance. Thin and watery, with one note spicy bitter hops and just a residual sweetness. Out of whack and quickly tiresome to the palate. Needs more carbonation, structure, and malt."
"Drinkability: Cask and you shall receive!"
"Even though the ale tries to balance with robust Amber Ale attributes, the hops stand proud and keep the focus on those classic American taste. Its a renegade IPA that gives no cares to the style police, but achieves a perfect balance and set of complexities that are unique onto its own."
" Good solid IPA worth a try if your ever in Ashvile."
