Aroma is citrus (mostly orange), leafy hops, bread, and caramel maltiness. Taste starts with caramel sweetness then is cut by grassy/leafy hop bitterness before mellowing to a citrus hop bitter finish. Medium bodied, slick and creamy, moderate carbonation.","SierraFlight","Feb 11, 2015"

This does not hold up well and I can't really see where the oak plays a part in adding on to the beer, to be honest. I realize that it's a "historical" experiment but these guys already make great enough beers to convince us that a lot of their experiments are as unique as they perhaps truly are. (However, I ALWAYS welcome experimentation in brewing.) Nevertheless, I would gladly revisit this in a fresher condition - it's comforting to drink and has a unique malt profile that shines above the hops. Worth trying if you want a FFF fix for something new.","magictacosinus","Nov 20, 2013"

The flavor is basically the same and follows very well with the exact same experience. Although good I don't really understand what makes this one English. It may use English hops but it basically came out as a malt forward AIPA from my experience. Medium to full body and moderate carbonation.","kylehay2004","Nov 07, 2013"

Here the English hops come off harsh and too bitter in muddy sort of way, and the malt tastes a bit too thick and chewy as well. The malt and hops don't balance each other but compound the assault on the palate with no contrast in sight. Oh well, not to my taste.","Georgiabeer","Oct 14, 2013"

Fitting I reviewed this on July 1st, because there is something that's very 'Christmas in July' about this beer. Wish I'd have traded for more of these! Everything I've imagined in an oak-aged beer. Can we have more of these please, and less 'boozy/bourbon' oak aged brews?","TheSixthRing","0"

Aroma is a bit weaker than I was expecting, getting a faint citrus smell and a hint of wood. Taste is a bit floral and lot citrus, defintely getting some oak, and balanced well between the malt and hops,. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky but dry, medium carbonation. Finish is definitely dry and bitter. Great offering from FFF. I’m liking this because the hops are definitely coming through but not too overpowering.","maxcoinage","Jun 23, 2013"

Flavor is BIG up front bitter with a sweet malty finish. Lingering honey pine taste on the palate. Alcohol warmth going down. Big slick mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation. Unique brew here, better than the rating that is lower than it should be thanks to the aroma (there just isn’t any). Worth a try. Yikes. As this warms up it the alcohol really comes out. Like vodka or rubbing alcohol flavor. That is unfortunate. Be sure to keep it cold and it is a solid beer.","BMMillsy","Jun 21, 2013"

Herbal, some floral accents, and light caramel malt. Finishes with a bit of apple peel, warm, toasty oak that combines with herbal hop bitterness and underlying hints of alcohol. Moderately carbonated medium body, that is smooth and creamy with hints of soapiness on the edges. I'm fairly surprised that I've never reviewed Blackheart, as it is among my favorites from Three Floyds. Certainly more bitter than your standard English IPA, this brew is fairly well balanced overall and the oak-aging is a plus.","chanokokoro","Jun 07, 2013"

Blackheart continues a big line of awesome beers the guys at Three Floyds have to offer. Nothing but world class here. This is a straight up flavor filled enjoyment of an ale. I'll buy this every year. A must try. As are all FFF brews.","BradtheGreat7","Aug 06, 2012"

4.5,11.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"a beautiful looking bottle label. poured a clean amber with a perfect 2 fingers of off white heat. great retention, greater lacing. smells of cascade hops.. more of a west coast smell than an english ipa. getting a hint of sweet caramel underneath the pine smell. tastes malty sweet and slightly bready up front. then you get a bitter blast of hops towards the finish giving you a piney/citrusy grapefruit taste. medium body with a nice creamy feel, moderate carbonation and a nice warmth from the alcohol content. this is a solid ipa, regardless of not really sticking to the tradition english ipa. i think they should consider making this one year round.. stands up strongly next to arctic panzer wolf.","facundoCNB","Aug 05, 2012"

4.1,1.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"22oz. bottle courtesy of CruisaC. Served in my SA Perfect Pint at 49 degrees. Pours a dull orange hue with a frothy, half inch bright white head. Clarity is nearly translucent; however, there is also a slight haze. Head eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch cap - thin, textured strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting and exhibit excellent adhesion. Nose expresses light, toasted malts, citrus and a trace of breadiness at the back. Taste is really interesting, toasted oak and caramel hit the tongue at first, followed by citrus, ethanol and an earthy/piny hops bitterness that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a slightly prickly carbonation and some acidity. Overall, I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this beer as I tend to not really go for English IPAs. The flavor profile is really quite multi-faceted and interesting. I'd like to see this beer with a little age on it as well to see how it develops.","Jwale73","Jul 09, 2012"

Great retention has it settles fine speckled patterns of lace cling to my Tripel Karmeliet glass. Aroma has citric and floral hop notes with a sweet lightly toasted malt base, and a touch of white oak notes with minimal oak on the nose. The barrel aging is so integrated in this beer, I usually hate oak aged DIPAs this is not the case here. Flavors from the oak give a nice earthy dry bitterness that lasts throughout each sip, earthy, grassy, citric hops blend so nicely with alcohol and sweet malts that bring out a honey toasted bread flavor that really keeps you wanting another sip. More toasted oak soft vanilla, juicy raisins, with warming alcohol in the finish. Medium to fuller bodied ale, brings out layers of flavor as it warms up a bit. Pretty clean hop oils flowing through not as sticky as some of these beers that have come out recently, I'm used to resinous hops. Overall damn good DIPA, English hops and malts collide with some oak aging that does the beer much justice, another great beer from Three Floyd's, no kidding?","WVbeergeek","May 27, 2012"

I'm really loving the oak flavors of this beer. Great citrus as well...orange and mango. A nice caramel malt backbone to this with some lovely butterscotch and toffee. There is some hoppiness...but very minimal compared to the other great flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that seems proper for this beer. Drinkability is pretty damn high.

4.35,7.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"It poured clear with a good inch of thick head. The coloring is a darker amber than most IPAs. The smell wasn't quite as strong as I had hoped - hops and sugar were present. The taste, however, was in full force - so many flavors that complimented each other like a great meal. There was a complex breadiness layered with brown sugar like a sweet bread. Add to that a solid level of hops and floral citrus aroma that filled my sinuses but didn't overwhelm. There were definite levels of flavors that worked together but didn't cancel each other out. It had obvious English characteristics that were simply accentuated rather than covered up by the more American style of being hop-forward. Throughout, it was very smooth and drinkable. The high ABV sneaks up on you. Overall, it was both the most flavorful and smoothest English IPA I have ever tried - and all at 9% - hard to top. Great job again, 3F!","BigBossMan","Oct 07, 2011"

Body is darker than their other DIPAs, also appropriate for the English style. Aroma has a lot of hops, but still a bit subdued. Hard to decide if it's right on for the style of if it's a little on the subdued side even. Well balanced aroma. Probably less hoppy in the nose than Alpha King (which is pretty dang hoppy), without that typical 3F's hop zing, but you can tell there were massive hops in the boil to balance the huge malt. Some complexity on the tongue, for sure. Mouthfeel is great, and overall I'd recommend trying this beer for a very big example of the style that hides the alcohol well, although for my part I'd rather be drinking a Dreadnaught or Artic Panzer Wolf right now for the price.","chicagoabbot","Jul 31, 2011"

And yes there is a good amount of bitterness in the end. Lots of grapefruit and tropical notes as well. Mouthfeel is very smooth, rich and creamy. The beer is a bit hot though. Outstanding beer! Really tastes more like a really good east coast DIPA than an English one. Hop bitterness is much more amplified. Seek this one out. And as always wish I bought more than one.","generalnotsew","0"

I do not want to negate actual English IPA's, but this American EIPA was an industry standard to me.

There is lots of kick from the carbonation, very alive jumpy feel. The overall, it's a good beer but for the price I'd almost always go with great lakes, if it was cheaper than 12 and some change for a 22oz it would great more attention.

The taste brings in more of the same, but the pine is nicely muted a bit, and some dark toffee moves in to balance things out much better than the caramel in the nose ever could. The body is a light-ish medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fairly creamy feel. Overall, a great EIPA.

The first sips confirm what the nose has suspected. This beer has a heaping helping of piny hops, but they are not overwhelmed by the caramel malt base and visa versa. This is how I like IPA, this beer has balance. The hops provide a good strong deal of bitterness that could be offputting to those who dislike the style, but for those who enjoy hops, this is pretty darn tasty.

Taste of grapefruit, pine, pineapple, and caramel, with a delayed bitterness of citrus and grapefruit, that lingers for a while after the finish, showing a strong use of hops. Very well balanced flavors, and it definitely reminds me of the Dreadnaught DIPA from them. Medium carbonation and a medium-full body. Absolutely no notice of the alcohol content.

I was expecting something akin to Stone's Emperial, but I'm definitely not complaining.

4.08,1.2,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Blackheart pours with a rich, thick head and long-lasting lacing. The brew is a bit darker than your average IPA, a rich mix of amber and honey. The scent is strongly citrus, with grapefruit being the star; there is also a bit of tangerine in the background, and a touch of honey. On taste, there is a lot more resiny malt than one may expect, which lends a subtle, not cloying, brown-sugar sweetness to each sip. While the flavor dominates throughout, the hops in the brew do strongly surface with predominant tastes of lemon and pine. Carbonation is quite good with this one, providing a strong presence throughout, though never overpowering the brew's subtleties. This is definitely a great beer, with it's strength being in the balance of the flavors, and a taste profile that is a welcome variant to the single-focused hop brews currently taking center stage in craft beer (which is certainly not a bad thing, but variation is good!)","sdawson","Sep 30, 2010"

2.9,-28,3,3,3,2,3,"Overall: This tasted so much like so many others of the IPA style that I found it forgettable. It seems like the syrupy malt/citrus-pine hop combination is becoming very common among American craft breweries that produce stronger IPA styles. What I'd like to see in this beer, as a supposedly English-inspired style, would be a leaner body; not necessarily lighter, just drier, not so excessively sugary and sticky. A drier body combined with a more earthy, herbal or spicy choice of hop flavors rather than the commonly used pine/citrus would, to me, taste closer to an English style and wouldn't eclipse the barrel aging so much. While this was an affable enough beer for someone with a taste for IPAs, the been-there-drank-that experience wasn't worth the high price to me (roughly twice that of nearly all other bombers at the store, including those of comparable style).","benjathelion","Jul 31, 2010"

There's a decent balance between the hoppy and malty flavors, and there's a lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and well carbonated.

It smells and tastes like an ipa, but a more refined one (guess that's where the "English" thing comes into play). Better than average, though not great.

On the nose, this beer immediately reminds me of the Alpha King, but with more orange citrus and less noticeable sweet malt (all positive differences in my book). Flavor profile replicates the nose, but the sweet malt in this beer completely dominates the hoppy bitterness. There's certainly plenty of hoppy bitter goodness in this beer, it's very prominent and noticeable, but at the end of the day, it's the sweetness in this beer that really stands out. On the other hand, while the mouthfeel is comes across as sweet and rich, and relatively full, I'm impressed by how well integrated the alcohol is in this beer. You can certainly tell the abv. is up there, but the beer is not the least bit heavy or tiring on the palate. The sweetness is a bit overdone I think, which ultimately hurts the beer's drinkability just a bit, but nevertheless, I found this to be a very interesting and enjoyable beer.

The taste is a little bit of a disappointment after the nose, with the hops and the oak not blending quite enough--in fact, even though this is an IPA, I'm almost tempted to commit the cardinal sin and age this one for a while to see what develops. The mouthfeel is thick for the style but well within range. Drinkability is somewhat hampered by what I feel might be a little too much oak for what it is right now.","Thorpe429","Sep 16, 2009"

The head has good retention before settling to a thick cap. Heavy spotty lacing is left on the glass. The claim is all English ingredients. Three Floyds must of used the English ingredients I do not like. Where are the floral and herbal hops I adore? Instead we get sickly sweet aroma and taste that is overly sweet and citric. Tangerine, pineapple, sweet malt, honey, all via for attention from the senses. Has alcohol warming in the finish. The aging on oak does add some interesting components if you can get by the sweetness. Adds a slight wood and vanilla flavor. The body is medium with a slick, oily texture. More like a barley wine than a pale ale. I did not enjoy this beer. I love English style ales but this is went into a direction I did not like.","morimech","Sep 03, 2009"

3.7,-8.2,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Looks good with a copper color, great clarity and very little head. The aroma is a complex mix of oak, alcohol, toasted malt and nuts. The flavor is quite intense with oak and alcohol in the lead giving it a bourbon like quality. There's a solid malt contribution (but to me it's overshadowed by the oak and alcohol) and a mild bitterness. After having had a few heavily oaked IPAs, I'm not so sure I like the combination. The mouthfeel is smooth and low in carbonation. This, to me, was the beer's best quality. Overall this one didn't work for me. The oak and alcohol were just too apparent.","GJ40","Aug 23, 2009"

It's a thick creamy white color. It hasn't receded at all so I will have to take a drink to talk about lacing. The aroma is hoppy but, sweet fruit shines through as well. Almost bubblegum like. The flavor is hops and toasted malt. It has a strange flavor that I can't seem to decipher. It's not a bad flavor but, I just have never had an English IPA before so it may be the style of hops.

Taste and mouthfeel are almost barleywine-ish. A little lighter, but the Malt taste is up front. Very dry, the beer leaves almost zero aftertaste. It's there and then gone.

The first time I tried it I was a little overwhelmed by the flavors I was experiencing and could not identify them. One of the unique flavors that I detect in this beer is an after taste of English Toffee. The mouth feel is smooth and creamy. It's not too carbonated, so I can get a better sense of the various flavors. As with many Three Floyds, this is a great beer, but I can only drink one or two glasses before I get overwhelmed by the flavor.","adamwonak","Jul 19, 2009"

I'll be damned if it feels or seems like a Double/Imperial anything, however - the alcohol on this one, though formidable on paper, is nowhere to be seen or felt. As many have mentioned, yes, the bottle artwork is grotesque, but it's in no way indicative of the contents. What's within is a well-crafted, unique, drinkable, and enjoyable brew from a great brewery.

4.02,-0.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4,"If Samuel Smith were to brew a DIPA, they could do worse than replicate this FFF effort. A slightly cloudy, coppery pint topped by a thin white head leads to a full-bodied brew perfectly balanced by a substantial hop presence in the back of the throat and the depths of the nostrils. The English hops lend a more subdued quality to this style than the left coast big-C hops typical of DIPAs. A nice dry oak flavor backs up the hops like Entwistle did for Townsend, keeping this extreme brew tamed and the taste buds clamoring for more.","MillRat","Jun 21, 2009"

I find most oak aged beers to feel this way. Hops were present in the taste but I think the oak pretty much took over. No hint of 9% alcohol whatsoever. I easily put the bomber down at dinner. I liked this beer but I would have preferred more hops and less oak taste. I thought it was good but as the beer warmed the oak was too prevalent. I love FFF beers and I was happy to try this.

4.35,7.9,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"From bottle into tulip glass. Pours a clear light copper with two fingers of head that slowly fade, stubbornly clinging to the sides of the glass. The smell presents mostly malt characteristics (warm caramel/creme brulee) with a pleasant whiff of grapefruit underneath and a touch of oak and vanilla. The mouthfeel is rich, medium-bodied, with enough carbonation to keep all flavors working at the same time. Sweet toffee takes the lead with some grapefruit tartness. The finish is a wonderful mix of bitter hops and light alcohol rounded out by the subtle oak characteristics of smoke and vanilla. This beer truly displays balance. No single flavor dominates and no IBU records are broken. Instead, this beer provides a complex balance of elements that seemlessly meld in every way (mouthfeel/smell/taste). If at all possible, this should be in your fridge right now.","chicagobeerriot","Jun 02, 2009"

It's straight grassy hops, with a little spiciness coming from some noble hops and really raw oak. Wow, the flavor reminds me of hop-laced ethanol. Up front, its big hops, on the tail it's straight booze. You would think that this beer would have somewhat of a malty flavor, just because of how much alcohol is in it but nope, I don't taste any malty sweetness.

4.5,11.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a bright translucent orange amber with a healthy 2-finger head and a steady stream of bubbles coming to the top. The retention is good and leaves solid lacing. The aroma is a balance of citrus hops up front and a strong caramel malt base. There is also a heavy dose of earthy hops throughout as well. The taste mirrors the aroma with a grapefruit and grassy hop kick giving way to the caramel malt base. There is a bit of spiciness in the finish as well as some hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation and leaves the mouth sticky with the earthy hop juice. The drinkability is fantastic on this one and I don't notice the alcohol at all. The best example of an English IPA (if you can call it that) I've tasted to date.","gford217","0"
3.88,-3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a cloudy amber with a medium beige head. Aroma is medium sweet with melon, light biscuit, some floral and earthy. Flavor is floral, earthy, melon and biscuity.

4.28,6.2,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D - This is definitely hoppier than I was anticipating for an English-style IPA, yet it still maintained an extremely nice balance between hops and malts. It also has a very unique flavor, and I can honestly say that I never tasted a beer quite like this one, and I've had a lot of IPAs. FFF is turning into one of my favorite breweries!","ffejherb","Sep 01, 2008"

3.75,-6.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ yellow/ copper-ish color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, small grapefruity/ lemon citrus, and a hint of black pepper. In the taste, pepper, lemon citrusy hops. A small bite and medium body mouthfeel, and a dry hoppy, peppery aftertaste. Nice English maltiness, and nice lemon citrusy hops. Very good.","OWSLEY069","Aug 29, 2008"
3.6,-10.7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,"Not at all what I expected -- a much bigger beer, heading in barley wine direction. The color was a pleasant russet, not much of a head to speak of. The smell is grassy with some pine notes; the taste kicks that up a notch, with the oak tones coming through, as well as some apple. It's a big, viscous, yet oddly quenching mouthfull, with the alcohol well hidden but warming after a few sips. A little of this goes a long way. All in all a very nice beer, but not one I'd come back to very often.","gory4d","Aug 29, 2008"
4.67,15.9,4.5,5,4.5,4,5,"D-Very good considering the ABV. This is a well-balanced beer for 3Fs and is very consumable. IN fact, I never leave my beer-fridge without a bottle of this at all times. This beer may be enjoyed by new comers as well as the experienced beer geek. This could possible be my favorite accessible beers at this time.","iuhophead87","Aug 22, 2008"
3.4,-15.6,4,4,3,4,3,"What a bizzare beer. Pours a dark orange with a big, big head. Lots and lots of lace. Smell is citrusy and funky. A touch of breadiness in there as well. Flavour is indescribable, but I will try. Its like pumpkin pie spices, mixed with cedar wood and lemon zest, I think. Bitterness is very aggressive. There is also a kind of funky twang to it. I would attribute that to the oak, but who knows. I think I like this beer. I just found it really off the wall. Glad I tried it.","mjryan","Aug 07, 2008"

Super happy to have given this a try... and I bet a blend of this (or a blend of these hops) with an Alpha King would be out of this world delicious. Just a thought for those of you who live close enough to the source to easily procure bottles.","errantnight","Jul 28, 2008"

4.03,0,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a murky orange haze with a fluffy off-white two finger head that stays for sometime before falling to a thin layer of foam. A good amount of webbing is left behind on the sides of the glass. Smell is light pink grapefruit with a pasty malt aroma as well. Some carboard and sweet floral scents in the nose too. Overall the hops are in check, especially for 9% abv. Spicy flavors up front followed by sweet caramel malts and woody herbs. Midway a touch of bitterness emerges with a touch of booze. Aftertaste has a hint of toasted grains with a bit more citrus and grit. Medium slick body with a soft and smooth feel. The carbonation is a bit on the strong side and prickly. A bit on the strong side in terms of abv for the style, but after further reading I guess that's how the original English IPA's were brewed. A truly unique spiced up IPA. I just can't get over how graphic the label is, sweeet.","BeerTruth","Jul 25, 2008"

4.2,4.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer poured a dark very cxloudy amber (always a good sign) The smell is limited but what I get is nuts/citrus. I was suprised by the taste I don't think I have ever had an english IPA before. To me it seemed like an american IPA mixed with an English Pale ale (with the nut flavors). The mouth feel is very pleasant, it is nicely carbonated. this is a very dinkable beer and I wish I had my wife pick up more than 2 of these for me!

4.3,6.7,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a light hazey, yet bright copper wih some cool bubbling, and no lacing. ONly a small film of bubbles greets you after the pour. Good color, but bad head and lacing for an IPA. The aroma is a straight forward orange zest, some chammomile and lots of bitter smelling bread. The taste is very sessionable for a 9% abv. Mild hops for an American, English IPA But a great malt bill. Hints of caramel, a touch of cinnamon and unrecognizable herbs. Very easy feeling palate. Great sessionablilty for such a high abv beer. Was actually very refreshing for such a beer.","scruffwhor","Jul 07, 2008"
4.05,0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Blackheart's a unique English IPA. Frankly, I'm not a huge fan of the style. I prefer the American variety much more. Though I still do, I can't help but feel like this is an English IPA on steroids. The sheer strength of it sets it apart from the masses. It also has a lot more character than its colleagues. I'm still not converted into a huge fan, but this is a good beer. Probably very good given the style. Recommended.","prototypic","Jul 06, 2008"
4.87,20.8,4.5,5,5,5,4.5," I was handed a Reddish Amber IPA supporting a pillowy head. The creamy mellow body that cresses yet covers your mouth in a silk. The aroma was mostly pina coloda but there was so much more subtlety form the cask it was overwhelming. I had two pints but still can't pin it down. What I do know is I need more cask ale. Real Ale now.","johanvond","Jul 05, 2008"
4.08,1.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Blackheart's label has to be one of Three Floyds most grotesque... in a good way.

I'm having a fantastic time with the bomber, but given the $9.99 price tag, I'd rather buy sixers of Alpha King or Gumballhead.","BuckeyeNation","Beers"

Flavor has a ton of character and is nearly perfect. Incredibly well balanced. Super hoppy and bitter, with a lot of juicy citrus character, a lush malt character of caramel and sugared fruits, and then on top of all that, it has well intergrated oak hints of vanilla and toasted wood. A surprise. What a well crafted brew.","Crosling","Jul 02, 2008"

This beer tasted wonderful! Hops at first with the sweet warming of alcohol going down the throat. Light in the mouth and just a hint of aftertaste make this one of the most enjoyable IPAs I have ever had.
