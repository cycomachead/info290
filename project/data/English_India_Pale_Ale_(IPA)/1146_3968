Aroma is of citrusy, piney, herbal hops and caramel malt and some fruit.  Body is medium and crisp.  Earthy, herbal hops, caramel and biscuit malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth.  Finish is long, dry and earthy.  Good English style, drinkable IPA.","mikeg67","Jan 21, 2015"

This, I feel, hits the bullseye for me - for sure, there are more aggressively hopped beers out there but this is a good introduction to the more bitter side of things.","interzen","Jan 20, 2015"

The aroma isn't overly skewed to the hoppy characteristics, with notes of citrus peel and pine contrasting against light bready malts. The flavor is a bit dull and earthy, although there is some bright pine character and a light bready sweetness at its base. The light, fine carbonation is nice, but there isn't as much lingering bitterness as I expected (although I'm not sure how I developed such an expectation). Overall, this is a solid but unremarkable IPA that I will gladly drink up but won't seek out.","devilben02","Sep 05, 2014"

It smells of light malt, a fruity essence mostly citrus notes, a nice smell actually. Tastes of light malt, and citrusy after tastes. Light bodied with a crispy carbonation mouthfeel. Overall a decent IPA the best part of it is it's aroma","anthony23cippy","Aug 18, 2014"

3.9,4.3,4,4,3.75,4,4,"Overall this is a very good representation of what an IPA should be. Not the best I've had, but a good option as far as easy to find supermarket beers go. Has a strong enough hops character to push it to the IPA level, but also has that malt backbone that is sometimes lost in an attempt to showcase the hops. With some better local options in NC, I probably wouldn't buy this one again, but still a good beer.","cottonkoozie","Jun 28, 2014"

3.74,0,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Overall 3.75: Very good IPA. Great balance of malt and hops and a very appealing blend of hops. Satisfying and perfect for sessioning. Will not make you re-evaluate your opinion of IPAs or life in general; just a good, solid beer. If you find it and are on the fence about whether you should purchase it, IMHO, it is certainly worth a try.","BeerDocT","Jun 21, 2014"

3.85,2.9,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Poured a nice clear amber with a half finger white head that dissipated leaving some lacing. It looks pretty nice, true to form for an IPA, but nothing standout. Scents of orange, grapefruit peel, some tropical fruit, peach, slight floral aromas and extremely faint pine resin. A very fruit forward aroma, yet also quite muted in its overall intensity for an IPA. Still very nice and appealing. Flavor begins with faintly bitter citrus, moving into strong floral hop notes and faint pine resin. Finishes with a nice hit of floral hops and citrus peel, with some slight pine. Aftertaste is floral with some hints of bitter citrus peel. A very floral IPA flavor and not as bitter and hop-forward as many American IPAs, but a good English IPA flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with low carbonation and a resinous feel. A good, true to style IPA mouthfeel. Overall this is a pretty good IPA, with a nice aroma and flavor combination, that while not the most pronounced and bold, are well balanced and pleasant. It's not the greatest IPA out there, even for an English IPA, but it is nice.","Auraan","Apr 16, 2014"

Nothing out of the ordinary in any department. What Goose Island IPA is, however, is an extremely approachable example of the style. It's perfect as an introduction to IPAs as well as a session IPA, I think. There's nothing overwhelming going on here, it's not sitting on an obnoxious ABV, and it's certainly not a polka dotted unicorn that's only found once in a blue moon. It's simply a middle-of-the-road IPA and I happen to love that. This always has a place in my fridge.","ThePaintedGrey","Apr 08, 2014"

AROMA: aromatic floral hops; slightly malty; piques the interest...PALATE: creamy, active and warming at the throat; the modest alcohol is properly situated--a balanced mouthfeel...TASTE: powerful,, cutting, arresting--any siege-like hyperbole aptly fits; wonderfully sprucey and citric without being overbearing...

Has my old friend been changed since the buyout? Not as of now anyway. Will it? I sure as hell hope not. Goose Island India Pale Ale has been a friend of mine as well as my close friends and family for years now. Whether its been a mid summer camping trip with those late night camp fire stories or a cold winter Friday night after a long week. I hope InBev never change GI. They are marketing people and if you buy a brewery with as rich craft beer tradition as this one you know the only way to sell it is to keep it the same. I can say though with confidence that India Pale Ale from GI hasn't changed as of now anyway. Lets hope it never does as it really is an enjoyable, flavorful, legend in our world of craft beer","BradtheGreat7","Oct 23, 2013"

The malt and bread takes over and tames any hop forefront is best as I can describe it. Now there is a pleasant citrus flavor going on that's zesty and refreshing. The mouth feels smooth and nicely carbonated, unlike how it looked upon pouring this into my pint glass. But all in all, this one is borderline for me. There's enough tart and rind in the initial taste to satisfy, nothing outstanding or complex, a good mouthfeel, but then a bland breadbasket of malty cardboard to remind me this is not my favorite example if the style. Is that last statement i just made a bit harsh? If it is, then it may just be my honest impression of what's left in an ipa's flavor when there aren't enough hops to taste! Still, im glad this respected brewery is now available in my market.","TBoneJones","Sep 17, 2013"

3.63,-2.9,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.75,"Pours a nice clear copper color with a bubbling 3 finger head that slowly falls but never departs. The nose is very nice. A balance between spicey, fruity, sweet hop and caramel malt base. I like the hop profile on this. Not too strong in any one direction, but with a lot going on in it. Flavor is not as nice as the nose. The hop is mostly spicey to a touch earthy over top a solid caramel base. Good balance, but not popping enough in the hop. It could shine, but it is a slight disappointment. The feel is moerate, with a light to moderate carbonation. The slighly light carbonation is probably from my aggressive pour. Overall, a very solid brew.","ExtraStout","Sep 14, 2013"

I believe this is the same yeast that they use in the goose island honkers ale (E.s.b.) which is very fruity also. fruity esters are out. ymmv. :)","bamafan","Sep 06, 2013"

Both the smell and taste I expected to be more malty than they were, as both I felt were too hoppy. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice citrus and pine hop to both the aroma and taste, but I thought that it should not be as pronounced. The beer had a light to moderate feel, nice carbonation and a nice dry, bitter aftertaste. Overall, a decent IPA, but certainly not an English IPA.","PhillyStyle","Aug 24, 2013"

Taste follows nose with just a bit of floral hops in there. Highly carbonated and below medium bodied. Overall, pretty average. The flavor is not enough to hide the hop bitterness, which makes it hard to drink. This beer is rated at 55 IBU, but feels way higher.","MisSigsFan","Aug 23, 2013"

The aroma is of faint citrus, pine, and some white bread. Taste is of citrus & pine, walking hand in hand with white bread and white bread toast. One would not guess this is a 55 IBU beer. Mouthfeel is light to watery, and Goose Island IPA finishes crisp, clean, refreshing, dry, and drinkable. Overall, this is most excellent. RJT","RonaldTheriot","Aug 18, 2013"

Finishes a bit abruptly with mild citrus, apple juice, but a faint residual grassy hop bitterness. Nice medium body with light creaminess.

It goes down easy with very little bitterness for my palate, which is accustomed to mouth-wrecking northwest IPAs. This one is more in the British style, with notes reminiscent of Belgian yeast: a bit of bubblegum and some tropical fruitiness. Alcohol warmth sends this one through the mouth smoothly as lacing lines the glassware. English-style Chicago IPA in the Seattle-Tacoma airport; just fine.","sam_bliss","May 10, 2013"

The taste follows the nose, with a medium, balanced hop bitterness, and a sweet malt character - a tad bit too sweet, but good flavor overall.

Taste starts with a creamy grainy delivery. Segues to a coarse middle of neutral grain followed by a watery flash and a decent lingering bitter orange character that doesn't have a harsh character to it. Medium bodied feel though it varies through the palate quite a bit. Overall a decent beer for the style and offers good drinkability yet doesn't quite grab you either.

The aroma hops were citric floral, and came across as sweeter smelling than a typical IPA. The taste was a combination of biscuit like malt and grapefruit from the hops. The body felt a little more thin than typical IPAs from the East Coast and Midwest, and leaned more towards the West Coast style of the likes of Stone and Rogue. It got fuller and rounder as it warmed up.","rajendra82","Mar 02, 2013"

Webbed lacing is left down the side of the glass in abundance as the head recedes. There are some visible streaming bubbles as well. There are aromas of sweet malt with some pine and citrus from the hops. The malt and citrus hop flavors tend to dominate up front. It's almost like a bit of orange and not so much grapefruit. It has some nice bready flavors from the malt and there's a touch of caramel. The hops yield a nice floral quality in the flavor and the back end bitterness helps bring some balance there. This is nicely done. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry and crisp. The smoothness of this beer helps the drinkability in many ways. This is a very good beer and would be a fine gateway IPA for newbies to the style.","acevenom","Feb 24, 2013"

I had it on tap at the stadium inn on evans. the pour revealed a amber tinted golden color with less than in inch of thick soapy white head. English malts and mild hop bitterness are well balanced in the nose. hops in the pine family, but nothing aggressive, and actually smells more like a pale ale than an ipa. the flavor is also well balanced, but sort of generic. more malty than most, even of the English variety. there is a huge bready body, its like taking a bit of sandwich in a lot of ways. the hops don't really present themselves until the end, where some bitterness appears against the caramel malt sweetness. lots of body, good carbonation, just a funny aftertaste holding this back. overall I am not super impressed, but ill take it over most everything else coming from Budweiser these days. it will have to work in a sports bar setting for awhile im afraid.","StonedTrippin","Feb 17, 2013"

Probably just lacking a bit in the flavor depth department but it's still world class. On a side note, after checking the hops used, i have got to say, they really achieved something special. For those of us who brew, to get 4 different hops in and make the hop character taste seamless, rich and deep is just nothing short of masterful.","endovelico","Feb 10, 2013"

There are those that reviewed this and commented it is closer to an English style IPA and I agree with that but the nose has a bit more aroma to it from the "" Styrian, Fuggle, Cascade, Centennial"" combination than the usual from that island nation. This is not a phenomenal beer to me, very drinkable 5.9%abv and not offensive in any way. Gotta like the price too.

Light amber color consistent and bright, mild yellowing around the edges, not a whole lot of bubbles but what’s there keeps coming, manages to catch your eye. Yeasty and honeyed in the nose while concurrently maintaining a bitters to peat and green hops edge, peppercorns, tangerine rind, as it warms more caramel and apricot to nectarine fruit scents appear, full presence and good lasting power. Medium to full-bodied, creamy mouth feel that has it both coating the palate and pushing outwards towards the cheeks. Perhaps slightly over-carbonated but depends on what texture you desire. Some mineral water, quinine, bitters through the attack then it’s warm biscuits, honey, caramel, orange to tangerine pulp, wet flower petals and even some mint leaf. Full peach, apricot, pear, green melon fruit. No matter how you slice it, not very herbaceous, not very toasty, not very spicy, neither sweet nor dry.

Aromas have a great citrus blending balancing out a floral hops presence. Tangerine and grapefruit dance around the nose. Flavors are more malt forward, with a strong hops presence on the tail end of the palate. Initial flavors are a subtle caramel malt, and then the green, fresh, and peppery hops attack the lateral tongue and the back of the throat with peppery spice and aromatic, floral, and resiny bitterness. Good flavor profiles. The aftertaste is bitter, with only a hint of the citrus sweet left behind to balance. Quick, slightly dry finish, leaving the palate with a slight astringency feel. Decent balance of flavors and an easily drinkable body and ABV make this a very sessionable IPA.","GarthDanielson","Apr 08, 2012"

A little bit of malt, but not as much as I was expecting from a non-Cali IPA. Taste is initially a little floral with some floral hop flavors, immediately followed by bittering pine notes. Some nice lemon and grapefruit flavors, but very mellow. A very easy-drinking, user-friendly IPA. Finish is sweet and not as bitter as most IPAs. Mouthfeel is light and creamy. Drinkability is very high. Overall, not the best IPA, but a very good one. Highly drinkable, but not very memorable.","DovaliHops","Mar 19, 2012"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"At Garcia Brogans this one is a clear yellow amber color with a decent white head and nice lacing. The aroma is of solid citrus-floral hop prevailing over lemon bread ideas. Sweet and hoppy, quite nice. The flavor follows with biscuit grapefruit and sunshine grains. It offers lively carbonation in a medium-light bodied brew though the feel approaches a slightly syrupy idea with fairly thick papaya/pineapple/citrus combinations. This is really a very drinkable IPA and entirely enjoyable. The IPA lovers will clearly enjoy this bitter brew. A nice surprise for me.","Durge","Dec 20, 2011"

Nothing objectionable here. Overall, this is one of the better Midwest IPAs, but that's not saying it's in the top 5 of that category and not in the top 20 US IPAs either (or English, for that matter, since this is described as an English Style IPA, although the hop profile resembles many US IPAs).

3.43,-8.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Goose Island India Pale Ale pours a crystal clear light orange. There's initially about a finger of dirty white foam sitting atop the beer, but it doesn't show much either in the way of retention or lacing. The nose is classic grapefruit citrusy, with a solid background note of orange. All in all it lacks a little punch though. There's a brief bit of bready malt at the open of each sip, before a little bit of bitterness rolls through mid palate. The close features the anticipated grapefruit and orange notes, but there's also something else, a slightly unpleasant aftertaste that at first I couldn't put my finger on. It was only in reading some other reviews after the fact that I was able to hit on what it was, and that was a bizarre soapy note to the finish. The body provides a solid frame for the beer, yet remains relatively light. That, combined with a nice lively amount of carbonation, results in a fairly spot on mouthfeel for an IPA. Goose Island India Pale Ale comes off as a beer that pairs American hops with an English sensibility as far as hopping rates. That makes the beer an American IPA in my book (despite how it's listed here), and one that just doesn't have the requisite punch to it. Still a fairly enjoyable beer to drink though.","axeman9182","Jun 23, 2011"

Goose Island has such popular beers and one has to wonder if the takeover by Busch has compromised the consistency of the product or not. For those looking for a mellow take on a strong style, this would be a great choice.

It smells like a herb garden with the piney penetrating me easily.It tastes wonderful, light, hoppy, citrusy with some fruit/floral qualities. Mouthfeel is splendid.

The aroma was of spicy, noble hops, grapefruit zest, hoppy resins and light mustiness. The flavors were on-point; it was full and inviting with an enjoyable, lingering finish. The flavors were built around a crystal malt backbone augmented by some Caramel/Caramunich malt. The hop profile was juicy, rich, spicy and noble-hop-heavy. Not as musty as the aroma and pleasantly so. The mouthfeel was quite good, the body med/full and the carbonation appropriate.","thekevlarkid","Feb 20, 2011"

With a thick head and inspiring aroma, the Goose Island looked good even in a plastic cup. Flavorful hops stand out on top of a luxurious malt base.

Weird! Anyway, I think this beer has changed over the years for the better. It starts off quite bitter, dry and hoppy, with a touch of malt sweetness to add some balance, very citric, lemony, and fruity. The mouthfeel is a tad on the watery side.

The taste is very bitter up front, not dissimilar to a grapefruit, with a lot of hop presence to follow. This is a good IPA, but I think I like the smell even better than the taste, not as a criticism to the taste. This beer is also very crisp and refreshing, drawing a connection to the Honker's. This is definitely very bitter rather than the expected sweet, it just depends on what you are after for that particular session. I'd have another...and another.

Upfront, there's a decent dose of pine and spicy hops that hit right away, fading into some bready, toasty malt that finish off the body.

Oily hops at the nose initially with some malt, some orange peel and very faint citrus in the back. First pull reveals a very smooth drinking IPA with a pleasant hit of citrus and light fruits followed by a balancing hop bitterness and a malty, somewhat creamy core.

4.27,14.2,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured a cloudy golden color into a pint glass, with a clean, white, persistent head. Pleasant citrus and floral aromas carried over to the taste, which was primarily bitter hops and citrus. This is not a particularly complex IPA, and one that definitely falls on the dry side of the spectrum. That said, it is very drinkable and, given the reasonable ABV, one that is a nice break from some of the more overwrought beers in this style. I would recommend it as a good compromise IPA, and one that would work well as a session beer.","malloyca","Aug 18, 2010"

Goose Island IPA is readily available in my neck of the woods, and, like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, is a reliable go-to beer for a hops-fix. Nothing flashy, but this beer hits all the points for the style, although perhaps a touch more hops and a bit less malt than the classic English style. Nice body, easy to drink with just a bit of a bite at the finish.","Brent","Jul 30, 2010"

4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a clear golden color with a nice sized frothy white head. The head sticks around all the way to to end and leaves nice lacing all around the glass. The smell right off reminds me of a lot of Goose Island brews I've had before with a lot more hoppy kick. Theres also some citrus aromas and it's a little floral. The taste is hoppy, citrusy, a tad bit malty. In the background there is a hint of pine as well which is more apparent as the beer warms up. As it warms up there becomes a small grapefruit taste too. Overall the taste is bitter but finishes smooth. Pretty good. Mouthfeel is nothing out of the ordinary for an IPA definitely not lacking. At a little less than 6% ABV and a great taste this is a really drinkable beer. This IPA isn't a hop bomb or anything but it's refreshing. I love to pick up some up when I can and I think it's great on tap. Overall another solid brew from Goose Island.","dismal","Jun 28, 2010"

Nose reveals some citrus hops, and an earthy/bready character. Taste follows nose - some caramel notes also come out in the flavor profile behind the biscuity character in the nose.

There is some leafy bittering hop towards the finish but it just doesn't sit well with that fruity mid section. There is a drying, almost saltene, flavor towards the finish that has some similarities to the Honker's Ale from Goose Island that I just had. This isn't a bad IPA but I was expecting better. The saltene end notes work better in the Honker's Ale than they do in this beer. The mouthfeel is about right, neither smooth and creamy nor prickly and husky. It splits the difference nicely.

Very crisp, sahara desert dry finish. Not as strongly hopped as other varieties, but plenty of grapefruit hoppy bitterness. Evidently this is an English IPA. I guess I like English IPA's. I could say it tastes like citrus, pine, rasins or whatever to describe the flavor. At the end of the day, it tastes like really good beer. Not as thick and intense on the mouth which makes for a smoother, more drinkable expiriance. This screams out for something really spicy to pair with it. I like it, it's good.","lester619","Dec 28, 2009"

There is a good amount of body here which only enhances the drinkability. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine example of an American IPA.

I often struggle to find other aromas on my palate and I can't identify anything else, but all I know is that this is what I want my beer to taste like.

Right in between an APA and an IPA, though I'd probably put it a little closer to the latter. Can't really compete with the more flavorful IPA's out there. A non-offensive beer to have while watching the game, but not one to sit down and enjoy on its own. There are more interesting English IPAs out there. Easily forgettable.","Jeffo","Oct 17, 2009"

It is brewed with four variety of hops: Styrian,Fuggle, Centennial, and Cascade. The slightest sweetness of fruit touches your tongue at first taste but is quickly held back by the dry malty middle, which is cut through by the medley pine from the hops. Nice and dry, with a good aftertaste. A great example of the style, and dangerously drinkable. While their are other examples of the style I still prefer, (Furious, Hop Ottin',Green Flash) this beer is quite tasty.

The beer has a nice cloudy orange/yellow hue and a well-retained large bubbled head. The foam sticks to the glass as it's drank down. The aroma is not overpowering, which is good.

I'm a big fan of Goose Island but feel a little let down by this offering. I think they didn't use enough bittering hops to really make this beer stand out. If they ever make a dry hopped version of this I think it would be a perfect balance. Overall a decent IPA but not one I'll look out for in bottles again.

This beer is very aromatic, a bouquet of spices, malts, and bitter hops fill my senses. This is a very traditional aroma that is well balanced.

There is a slight taste of malt at the beginning, then the hops take over from there, with some good bitterness and a citrus aftertaste at the end. The feel is medium bodied, but leaves a nice dry finish at the end. This beer is true to the style, immense hop flavor and aroma in a glass.","jayrod20","May 05, 2008"

The medium body displays buzzingly fine, creamy carbonation that tickles the tongue with a perfect amount of sharp bitterness.

Pretty nice for a simple IPA imo.

Taste is similar to the aroma as far as the hops go, but there's also some spice and matly sweetness noticable. Mouthfeel is light/medium, it's smooth and leaves a slight coating on my tongue.

There's an interesting flavour in the finish that is very green, and reminds me of eating peas in the pod, right off the vine. Little in the way of and IPA character here, it's more of a jazzier APA.

3.97,6.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Purchased at corner store, bottle stated best when consumed by 8- 19- 07. Chilled and poured into a nonic despite the suggestion of a tulip glass as specified on the label. Nice two fingers of gray-ish white head, which dissipated at a medium pace and lingers little more than a centimeter off the surface, leaving slightly thin lacing. The body is a very light amber color with a slight hint of peach and blond straw colored highlights. The body is translucent with decent clarity. Smell is spicy hops up front, slightly piney, big notes of grass and earth with a subdued malt character I get small hints of butterscotch and strawberry, not sure if this is strictly from the malt though. Taste wise the bitterness is not quite as assertive as I thought it was going to be, but in terms of balance it is quite adequate. Personally I might want a slightly more strong malt character/ alcohol to allow for bigger hop function, but as I said before it is well balanced. I guess Ive become so accustomed to what Id consider to be American style IPA where I feel this is more an English style. There is no question this is a very drinkable IPA, the alcohol is low enough to make this very sessionable. Not my favorite, but definitely a solid offering.","mmcave","Apr 09, 2007"

3.87,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours dark, slightly hazy yellow with a bit of a head. Some lacing remains after the beer is gone, comparable to English bitters. The most noticeable thing is the floral smell of dry hops, which is not overdone and very enticing. Taste is sweet at first, giving way to citrus flavors, lingering hop bitterness, and the floral elements noticed in the smell. Mouthfeel is nice since the beer is not overly carbonated and is very thick. The hops are strong enough that this is firmly an IPA, but they do not dominate the malt characters. A balanced, sessionable IPA.","Mickelswit","Apr 04, 2007"

It has a predominant pine hop flavor - but not too much. With secondary flavors being too low on the list to register, there isn't much to distinguish this beer from others. I'm sure the problem here is just that I'm not a huge fan of IPA's, and enjoy finding resonating flavors to perk up my interest. So it is only a quible.

Aroma is light and crisp, grapefruit and big floral hoppiness, paired with a yeasty breadiness. Spicy and grassy undertones with notes of piney hops finish out the nose. Taste is much of the same, grapefruit and floral/grassy hops matched with a sweet caramel-toffee malt balance, appreciative hopping not too much. Slightly drying bitter aftertaste resulting from the hop oils. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium levels of carbonation. Light, crisp and clean are the words that sum up this beer for me, displays all of the characteristics I like to see in a lighter IPA.

Lots of lacing in the pint glass. Nose is of citrusy hops, piney, and somewhat sweet. Palate is a very good balance of hop astringency and malty sweetness. Definitely an IPA, in that it leans heavily toward the hop presence, but isn't overpowering. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, some lingering sweetness on the tongue. To me, this is a great ""standard"" American style IPA ... very, very drinkable. This one is one of my staple beers that I like to have on hand at all times.

I don't have one, so this went into a 17-ounce snifter. Orange amber with a sticky white head, plenty of lacing, even after the foam settles to a thin cover. Nose is appropriately floral, citric, and piney, with a bit of underlying caramel malt sweetness. There is, however, very little sweetness to speak of in the taste. Rather, there is a bitter pine and grapefruit pith flavor up front with a toasted biscuit finish. No mineral content. Hops are right there the whole way through. Clean, snappy mouthfeel with a medium body. Not too juicy and just dry enough. Much better than I expected. I'm happy we're able to get a couple Goose Island beers here in Western New York now (this one and the Honker's Ale), but I'm hoping the price will come down a bit.

Flavor is not as nice as the nose. The hop is mostly spicey to a touch earthy over top a solid caramel base. Good balance, but not popping enough in the hop. It could shine, but it is a slight disappointment. The feel is moerate, with a light to moderate carbonation. The slighly light carbonation is probably from my aggressive pour.

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a golden yellow. It has a thick fluffy white head, with a slight yellow tint to it. It fades slowly leaving too few laces. The first scent I detect is a piney floral one. It smells hoppy. It has a citrus scent also. I also detect faint hints of lemon. It tastes piney. It has a citrus taste with slight fruit flavors making an apperance. It is not as hoppy as the aroma led me to believe. The flavor is actually quite mild. I think this might be a good beer for people, like myself, who do not usually drink hoppy beers. It leaves a piney taste on the palate. It goes down smooth. It is carbonated very well. I think this beer would make a good session beer because for an IPA, it is somewhat mild. Also, it is not high in alcohol. If you get a chance to try this one, give it a shot. You will probably be glad you did. Thanks to Mentor for providing this beer.","OStrungT","Jun 16, 2005"

For me floral hops and citrus come out in the nose. The flavor is refreshing. I can detect citrus along with the bitterness from the hops. It finishes well balanced. The beer feels medium bodied as it should but it also seems to feel a bit acidic which can take away from the enjoyment. This is a highly drinkable and all around well crafted session beer. I could see getting this again in the future. It is a good brew to relax with when you feel like something simple yet tasty.

4.13,10.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"12 oz bottle obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) and consumed the same evening (May 2005). Pours a 1.5 finger off-white clingy head over a light rust-orange liquid. Just a hint of chill haze. Smells co-ho citrus hop during the pour. Rich Amarillo hoppy. Citrusy and cotton candy. Orange and tangerine, not grapefruit. Sweet is quite below the hops. Pear and apricot. Tastes bitter hoppy carried later by a malt sweet then arises a floral hoppy from the back and concludes withe a delightful toasty & nutty. Really a nice progression. No single flavor is over the others and the flavors overall are pleasant. Great, as so many IPAs are 'in your face' hoppy. The middle, after the inital hops had some pear and apricot (not quite apricot...more honey-like, as if it was apricot jelly). This beer is tasty quality and highly quaffable. Md-light mouthfeel that has a creamy quality about it and is mildly carbonated with fine bubbles forming on the entire flat of the tongue and making an acrid burn in the aftertaste on the sides of my tongue.","mentor","May 30, 2005"

Smells of floral, mostly a floral aroma with citrus following behind, and then behind that too is the malt that does not want to be pushed aside by the hops. First drink, I'm surprised by how much of the malt comes through, but lets the hops come through too. Sweet malt over your tongue, but before you can get sick of the sugars, butter and caramels, you are greeted with the citrus, deep bitters and earthy tones of the hops. Nothing too hopped, too light or too malty. Will probably revisit this beer in the future.","HoboAGoGo","Apr 30, 2005"

I'll have to admit I was a little let down by the taste. Although by no means was it bad, it was simply a middle of the road example of an IPA. The trademark hops were there in the usual fashion, as well as a faint presence of toasted malt. Decent mouthfeel, easily quaffed. Dry hoppy finish.

Grapefruit, pine resins, good malt presense becoming more noticeable as it warms. Mouthfeel is thin and a little oily. As I mentioned this is not a hop monster.

The taste is of hops, but not overly hoppy as some IPA's tend to be. The Pale Ale taste still shows through in the aftertaste. I will definately drink more of this, particularly during the change from Winter to Summer when I will still be craving hops, but won't quite want such a heavy brew.","neonbrown82","Jan 10, 2005"

The fruity malt is a beautiful counterpoint to the citric hops, and tastes very English if just a little syrupy. The hops seem to be the main thing here, and they are very tasty.

Seems to be a bit lacking in body, but overall the mouthfeel is good and allows for easy drinking. After a few sips the bitterness comes through on the back of the palate a bit stronger...but not overwhelming.

The hops don't leave any room for malt in the flavour as well, this is a very citric IPA, starting with notes of orange and tangerine, and finishing more with grapefruit rind, with a sticky pine aftertaste. Still enjoyable for the hops alone though, if you're into that, they are not overwhelmingly bitter, but predominate the taste. Mouthfeel is a tad watery, but this is an easy drinker, I feel satisfied. A bit one-dimensional over all, or very lopsided. Yet I keep going back for more until the glass is empty.

All in all nice IPA a bit reserved and more English than American in nature, and it's not like Goose Island tries to hide this fact with the Union Jack flying on the label.

I got more pleasure sniffing this beer than I got from drinking it. Flavour is all hops (where are the malts?), dominant initial grapefruity bitterness like I expected (not unpleasant), quite drinkable, but the one-dimensional, medicinal and wormwoodlike bitterness that remains in the aftertaste is not to my liking.","Sigmund","May 18, 2004"

The hops don't dominate this brew but their presence is felt. It finishes with just a hint of citrus and malt. I should also note that this beer is extremely consistent, I have yet to have an off bottle or one that varied to an extreme degree. This will probably remain my summer session beer.","soper2000","Apr 08, 2004"

The nose delivers citrusy (orange, grapefruit) and spicy, piney hops over a delicately sweet malt. Bright and refreshing! It's similar to orange marmalade. The body is medium and it's very fine, natural carbonation leaves it gently crisp and then smoothing in the mouth. Citrusy hops return to dominate the flavor with its honeyish malt acting as a springboard. Some piney/spruce hops appear as its solid bitterness rises. It's really well-balanced and it finishes dry and lingering with some piney hops that last. Quite nice!","NeroFiddled","Apr 05, 2004"

Smells of citrus, and a little grainy. Taste has a nice grapefruit citrus hop finish. Not terribly sweet. Perhaps a bit thin, but certainly drinkable. I thought this was a good session beer. I have always been happy with Goose Island. It seems that I have never had anything over the top from them, but everything has been good every time that I have had it. That is important, and sometimes understated.","Bierguy5","Mar 30, 2004"

Appearance is a nice orangish amber that leaves a one finger tight white head on top that settles down after a few minutes. A citrusy, slightly floral hop aroma carried by a decent amount of carbonation welcomes you prior to first taste. Moderate bodied with a light grainy aftertaste competes with uninspired hops. Some lace clings to the glass as you move down the glass. An easy drinking beer but nothing to get excited about.

Some notes of pine and citrus in the aroma, quite a bit of hop floral nectar characteristics. A bit of fruitiness and sharp astringent hoppiness in the nose as well, but in a good way. Taste is sharp and bitter from the hops, supported by a biscuit like maltiness. Quite a dry beer overall as well, but quite a bit maltier than I at first realized. A good amount of hop flavor and a solid dry malt character in the middle is a counter point to the bitterness in the finish. The hops are sharp produce a tingle as this beer passes my lips, just like a good IPA should.","Gueuzedude","Mar 16, 2004"

Aroma is all hops, with spruce pine and sharp citrus assaulting the nose. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and has a sharp hops bite. Taste is grapefruit rind and pine, with hops resins coating the mouth. This has a fresh green hops sensation all the way through, but there is a hint of sweet toffee and honey that attract a bit of notice and lend a little bit of balance. Finishes with a piney hops twang that is dry and crisp. Very refreshing and nicely drinkable. A good American IPA.","merlin48","Feb 27, 2004"

Maybe a little too much hops, but I still love IPA's, and this one (which originally assaulted my tastebuds into hop-headedness) is no different.","TastyTaste","Jan 25, 2004"
4.05,8.3,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Clear golden-bronze with coppery highlights, the off-white head reached an adequate size of one finger in height. Fades slowly to a loose cap rather quickly but the remainder lasted well. A decent amount of webby lace was produced as the beer was sipped away. The nose leaves little doubt as to the style of this beer, IPA all the way. Loads of pine needles, grapefruit rinds, and dried wild flowers dominate the bouquet. I find the aromas to be very agreeable, albeit one-dimensional. Inviting. The palate proudly shows the 58 IBUs, the taste is slightly raw and unrefined, the perfect amount for my tastes; the hops are largely floral and piney with only traces of citrus flesh, more bitter rinds than anything. This is not really a juicy IPA; kind of dry actually, I find it pleasant. The maltiness is noticeable occasionally, hints of toasty caramel grains are detectable but they provide little in the way of flavor support. Id like to taste more biscuity-crackers maltiness in my IPA. The finish is heavy on foresty aspects, sap and needles. The abv is small enough to drink this back-to-back-to-back and there is enough flavors to want to do so. The lack of maltiness is noticeable in the mouthfeel, it is a touch to thin for me, vaguely medium, natural, low but embracing carbonation; a touch too slick on the tongue. As a whole I enjoyed this IPA, if it was available locally Id quaff it often, it is too drinkable to ignore. Purchased in Sioux Falls, SD.","bditty187","Jan 23, 2004"

It is a beautifullly poured pint that smells of the glory of hops as I bring it up to my nose. The first sip enervates my entire pallate and asks me to drink again. It is so tasty that I stop to enjoy it. What a great reason to stop... I know many of us are seeking the maximum hop experience but this is a wonderful session beer. I look forward to returning to try it again. It is low enough in alcohol to be a session beer, but good enough to find a designated driver. Take care.","faernt","Jan 04, 2004"

A nice fizzy head helps spread the hop aroma. Yes, there is hop bitterness, but as Dick Solomon on ""Third Rock"" said, ""Not in that fun, spanky way."" You also get a balanced fruity taste that matches the maltiness nicely. Well done, and in stores round these parts at popular prices.","DrunkMcDermott","Nov 12, 2003"

The nose is both mildly sweet in a fruity way and spicy in a ginger-esc sort of way. Some malty, bready notes are also evident on the nose. In the mouth more spicy gingery hoppiness. This is like an introductory IPA...and that is a good thing! Too many people are turned off by overly hoppy brews, yet if they warm up to them over time who knows, they may find they take a liking to the style. Another solid effort from a brewery that finds its niche in session styled interpretations of the great beer styles. And here in Chi-town the freshness and price of these brews is on target and represents honest value.","moulefrite","Oct 17, 2003"

The aroma is both sweet malt and strong citrus hops with just a hint of a nice sweet floral/bubble gum component. The taste is very balanced, with good malt sweetness up front leading quickly to the citrus hop flavors, but some sweetness slides in on the finish. The bitterness cleans up most of the flavor, but there is just a hint of sweetness, like a good pink grapefruit, in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very solid, with a moderate carbonation feeding the suppleness on the tongue. It all adds up to a supremely drinkable brew, a good example of the sum exceeding the total of the individual parts. This is a study in balance and quaffability. Probably the most enjoyable Goose Island offering I've had.","aaronh","Jul 28, 2003"

Aroma is spicy, floral, and just plain hoppy with a hint of malt sneaking in. The tase was what really impressed me, its not the ""more hops=better beer"" kind of IPA, its the ""correctly hopped=better beer"" kind of IPA. The hops are what this beer is about, with a good hop nose and flavor without an oppressive bitterness. After the first few tastes the flavor really settles in with a good bitterness, roasted malt, and oily hop flavor...in about that order. A pretty good session beer.","Sixpack595","Jun 26, 2003"

A pleasant flowery/orange (citrus) aroma is present, along with the smell of hops. Tastes very good, some sweetness and a nice hop taste comes forth (though not as hoppy as many IPAs).

Not too much head, and it leaves the tiniest bit of lace. The aroma is fantastic, very floral, very hoppy, very nice. The taste is not quite the standard, but I believe that it improves upon it.

Fresh hop aroma with a bit of a bready and an increasingly present caramel nose as the brew warms. Caramel, slightl diacety, and malt opens up the taste before being washed away in a tide of hops. Fresh piney hop bitterness with a bit of flowery/earthy hoppiness is present. The hops fade about halfway through the brew and let the bready malt gain the stage for a bit before they return for a bitter flourish at the finish that leaves a nice bitterness on the tongue. Although the hops are the main part of the brew the malt provides a nice medium body but also seems to get a bit cloying as well.

I expected more hoppiness on the nose for an IPA, they're there, but so is a sweet maltiness. After my first sip I wonder where all those hops were hiding. Resinous pine is the most prominent taste. Much hoppier than the aroma indicates, nice bitterness, but not very well balanced. The malty aroma fools me into thinking I'll taste some malt, but not with this beer. I think I just burped up a pine cone. Finishes dry. A beer for hop lovers for sure. Thin mouthfeel and decent carbonation for the style.

Hops are omnipresent at the front end, slowly yielding to the sweeter taste of grains. Finish is somewhat dry and bitter with detectable alcohol--less enjoyable than the rest of the drink.

Excellent texture for the hopheads, as each individual sip requires one to stop, savor, swallow. The hop attack is huge, and clearly, not for everyone. I enjoyed the hell out of this tasty IPA! Puts others to shame.","feloniousmonk","Jan 24, 2003"
3.43,-8.3,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Clear bright amber color, 1/2 inch small-bubbled head on a reasaonably hard pour. Zazzy hoppy aroma, some nose hair prickle...flavors start bitter and resinous, lemon pith and balsam-like characteristics that are just shy of mediciny phenolic. Malt never really asserts well, a touch of bread mid mouth before a warbling hop finish. Quenching if not delicious. This review might lead some to think this is a hop monster, its not...lower carbonation and overall muted flavors just leave this brew on the over-balanced to the hop side of the fence in my opinion. A later bottle was more malty, but almost orange soda in its take.","ADR","Jan 05, 2003"

4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"12 oz. bottle, pours clear light amber color, nice head, leaves a lace in the glass. A flowery strong piney aroma, medium body, balanced malt and alot of hops, I like this IPA one of Goose Island best brews. I can put down a few.","maxpower","Nov 30, 2002"
3.3,-11.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Coppery golden color with a whitish head. Nice floral aroma. Well hopped, but the malts don't seem to have a lot to say. Tastes good upfront and in the middle, but finishes poorly with lingering bitterness. A good IPA, but miles from the wonderful flavor of a Victory Hop Devil. Drinkability suffers due to the way the beer finishes.","PhantomVodoo","Nov 25, 2002"
2.93,-21.7,2.5,2,3.5,3,3,"Poured a pale amber, with good carbonation, but very little head. Hop aroma with slight citrus fruitiness (hint of orange). Very well balanced, yet bold hop flavor. Carbontation tickles the tongue. Salty bitterness beckons you to take another drink to quench it up front, only to be smacked with it again in the finish.","Winter","Nov 10, 2002"
3.35,-10.4,4,4,3,2.5,3.5,"Somewhat enjoyable...but nowhere near a great IPA.","cokes","Oct 29, 2002"
3.52,-5.9,4,4.5,3,4,3,"Slightly cloudy copper with a thin lace of white on top.  Beautiful floral hop aroma... with maybe a touch of spice.  Taste is slightly one dimesional... very hoppy with an oily bitter finish.  A touch of malt, but not really enough to balance this one out.  It has a medium body, and prickly carbonation.  Overall, a decent IPA, but not one I'd go out of my way for.","zerk","Oct 08, 2002"
4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Well, this is a very light copper colored ale with an initially  well-formed head that reduces but is everpresent throughout the tasting.  The thing that impressed me is the well-rounded floral hop aroma on top of the malt sweetness.  The taste is very citrusy, with orange the dominant taste: for an IPA the hops are present but not caustic.  This is an IPA that is very drinkable -- even with the high IBUs it is a mellow drinking beer.","brakspear","Sep 16, 2002"
3.25,-13.1,3.5,3.5,3,4,3,"Kind of thought this to be an mediocre, average at best, IPA. Hops are a bit out of place and the malts are uninspiring. Expected more from Goose Island.","Todd","Sep 10, 2002"
3.68,-1.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I'm not always a big fan of IPAs, but I could't find much wrong with this. Great hops ratio and better coloring than your typical IPA. This and Samuel Smith's are both IPAs that kind of transcend the norm.","Dogbrick","Sep 10, 2002"
4.12,10.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"The beer has a very small amount of chill haze evident.  Nice light copper tone.  Medium bubbly off-white head that is well retained.  Very nice grassy and herbal hop nose, which is the result of some hefty dry hopping I would assume.  Hops are earthy and perfumey at the same time, if that's possible.  Some slight pine tar notes.  Malt backbone is evident, but definitely in the background.  A nice lingering bitterness makes its presence known long after the drink.  I like it.  The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated.  Body is about medium-full.  This isn't one of my elite IPAs, but it is definitely a good effort.","Bighuge","Sep 04, 2002"
3.8,1.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"It poured a copper golden color and left a nice white head that left some nice lace.  A little bit of carbonation.  It had an aroma of hops and some hops and some citrus.  The taste was of hops, citrus and malt.  The finish was a touch dry and bitter with elements of the forementioned, which was good.  I found this to be a great IPA for the money(at least in my state).  While not the best by far, a good IPA for those that aren't trying to break the bank.","Wildman","Jul 09, 2002"
3.98,6.4,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"My first IPA, and its a good one.Poors a deep amber color with a good one-inch soft-fluff head that later laces the glass. Stronger than regular pale ales of coarse at 5.9 but maintains its smooth and crisp finish.I too noticed the mouthfeel. A malty, hopped-up aftertaiste on the mouth roof does last awhile. This is a good finger food eat'n beer or one to relax and sip awhile.","chilidog","Jul 05, 2002"
4.42,18.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: Damn good IPA to be had here, clean on the tongue with lots of hop flavour rather than going overboard with bitterness which rests at a substantial 65 IBUs.","Jason","Jun 01, 2002"
