"Citrus smelling - grapefruit, SRM 5 - pale gold, lace that last the entire serving, dry and plenty of hop bitterness. Another great beer from Highland!"
"Smooth, finishes a little bitter and a little oily. Enjoyable brew."
""
""
"The flavor profile falls just short of outstanding.  It is intense, but falls short in balance and complexity.  It has a nice hop flavor focus (herbal, citric and rind) over a mild bitterness in the middle.  Caramel and biscuit sweetness appear in the finish, but are overwhelmed by rind and pine hop flavor.  This hop flavor lingers."
""
""
""
"Typical EIPA with perhaps a bit more substance than many. Floral citrus (grapefruit) notes that linger for a couple of minutes."

"Harsh and unpleasant."
"If you can appreciate an EIPA, this is your bet. Great Lakes Commodore Perry is a bit too American to be a traditional EIPA, but this is spot on."

"Floral, grainy aroma, light citrus flavor, a moderately bitter finish.  Nice nutty malt backbone."

"Regular macro style straw body. Wonderful delicate hoppy aroma. Slightly bitter flavor. Very easy drinking. Light floral taste. Some sweet maltyness. Good sessionable beer."

"Poured out a nice deep gold with a slight amber tint. The head has slight retention, with a thin disc and some nice lacing. The aroma is pretty mild, with some light malt aromas (think dried fruit). The taste is alright. There is neither the malt depth of traditional English IPAs or the hops of American IPAs. It's not a bad flavor, but it's not very complicated. The body is lighter, as an English IPA tends toward and it's not bad, but it's not really going to blow you away."
""
"O: I picked this up in a mix six as I've been wanting to try it. As much as I want to encourage NC craft, I won't be repeating this one."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, crystal-clear, golden-yellow coloring with a steady flow of carbonation throughout, and a short, filmy, clingy, white head. Aromas of floral hops, subtle caramel backbone, light fruit esters, and subtle bitterness. Flavors are bitter forward, with a tart citrus character of tangerine and grapefruit, followed by subtle toasted and caramel notes, and some floral highlights. The body is smooth, with a sharp edge to it. The aftertaste is more floral and sweet than anything, with fruity notes up front. The finish is smooth, somewhat effervesced from the carbonation, and slightly bitter. Very drinkable English IPA."
"This beer could best be compared to a poor version of Sierra Nevada. Nothing new or exciting here. A truly prosaic and mediocre beer. After a few sips I poured this one out.There are too many decent beers out there so I recommend that you skip this one."

"O: Solid IPA that is well-balanced."
""
"O- Not sure what they were going for with this but it missed the mark for me. I did like it a bit better when I had it on tap but was still underwhelmed. For a better English-style IPA also brewed in Asheville, try Green Man IPA."
""
""
"Not bad at all. Very vibrant hop flavors and the hop bitterness is right on the edge of being too bitter without crossing that."
"This is one of my new favourite IPAs. I just recently started enjoying IPAs Im more of a Stout guy myself. I would highly recommend this for someone who is trying to get their feet wet with IPAs. It is not as bitter as some others. Another IPA I'd recommend is Sierra Nevadas Torpedo."

"D: not a bad IPA, but that unwanted lingering hop astringency is a bit of a turn-off. otherwise, super solid taste makes this pretty inviting."
""
""
"Overall - Not one of my favorite IPA's, I probably wouldn't buy this again. it's a little too one dimensional in my opinion. I think a little more towards the aroma side of the hops would make this a better beer. I wouldn't touch the bitterness, I think it's fine."
""
""
""
""
""
"My 100th IPA rate...maybe I should have chosen better for this. Pours a slightly hazy yellow with little to no head. Aroma of sweet malt, honey, and no hops at all. Flavor is a muddled mess of honey and dusty stale hops, I guess. Sweet malt all the way through with an unpleasant aftertaste. Light and a bit watery. What a disappointing IPA."

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall not terrible but not really something I would return to either."

"O. Solid east coast IPA. Not overly hopped. Very subtle. Nice malt character."

"Beer is a bright gold; it looks like sparkling apple juice. It has a thin head; leaves some lacing. Aroma is slightly toasty with some caramel and generic hops. Taste is crisp. Some nice malt up front with a pleasantly bitter and slightly astringent piney hops finish. Mouthfeel is good. It is pretty highly carbonated, and overall the beer is fairly light, without being wimpy. Overall, this is a decent IPA. Nothing out of the ordinary, but it is pretty crisp and refreshing."

"A unique spin on an IPA. Not quite in the ""session"" IPA territory and not quite a ""true"" IPA, and therefore confusing. Closer to a blonde, but still a nice beer."
""
""
"The scent and taste were somewhat cloned as I got cereal malt graininess or maybe corn adjuncts. No metallic taste synonymous with corn adjunct beers it was like a watery Heineken. Very light, easy to drink, it was better than Bud but not an IPA."

"This was my first exposure to a Highland beer, and to be honest I picked it up as part of a ""make-your-own-6-pack," and didn't know what to expect. It is definitely on the lighter side of IPAs. The IBUs weren't listed on the bottle, but I'd have to guess that it is on the low end when compared to most. That said, it has a bright, almost citrus flavor that I liked. It also had a smooth finish, and was more refreshing than I think many IPAs tend to be. To reiterate, I think it's worth a try, but it won't be what most people expect out of an IPA...."
""
""
"overall it's a good beer, but if you want a solid IPA go for something else. if you are new to IPA and/or craft beer this one will be a great stepping stone."
""
""
""
""
"Feel is smooth and light. Touch of citrus yet a bit thin in body though not out of balance for a 5.8% ABV IIPA. Overall not really sure where they're going here so off to thier web site I go. And yes as expected they are aiming more for an English IPA here. And still it misses to a degree yet by not so much as for an American version. Mediocre overall and a bit aimless yet ok in the end."
""
""
"This isn't a beer that I'd refuse if it were offered to me, but I wouldn't seek it out. It's not very representative of its style, but taken on its own merits, it's a perfectly good beer."

"This is more of an east coast style IPA. There is a prevalent hop bitterness with a very mild malt backbone. Honestly, this one could use more malt in the finish. There is a fruity undertone that goes well with the bitterness. Nothing overly interesting here, but it's still not bad. The head is fluffy white and leaves some nice lacing."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very well balanced and the alcohol is hidden - easy to drink and enjoyable with wonderful hop flavors and aromas. Another solid brew from Highland Brewing and one I would be happy to get again - I used to get this pretty often when I lived in NC and wish we could get it in NJ."

"Part of the Highland Brewing mixed 12 pack. Pours a light golden color, smallish white head to it. Faint hop aroma. Light to medium bodied, okay mouthfeel. A very malt heavy IPA, would have liked the hops to be a bit more upfront. Solid and well balanced, but a bit on the boring side and doesn't break any boundaries. Serviceable IPA, but nothing special."

"O- This was the 2nd IPA I'd ever tried when I had it about 5 years ago. I was not a fan then, and now that I've grown to love IPAs, I'm afraid I'm still not a fan. There would've probably been a point that I would've enjoyed this say 2 or 3 years ago but at this point it falls short. WAY too many other IPAs I would choose over this."

"Overall I wasn't a fan of this beer and I thought that it was a below average IPA, it just didn't have any of those great hoppy aspects that I look for in an American IPA, and the malt base wasn't that good either. This beer had ok drinkability, it was smooth and went down faster then I expected but not because it was good, but because I wanted to be done with it, the flavors were really bland and could not hold my attention. What I liked most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was the only part of this beer that was true to style. What I liked least about this beer was pretty much everything else with the taste sticking out as being the worse, it was just way too bland and unappealing for my tastes. I would buy a single of this again if I knew it was fresh but other then that I am not really motivated to revisit this beer anytime soon and I can't say that I would recommend this beer to anyone. Their Oatmeal Porter turned out to be good but this beer was not and was pretty much a let down, I am kind of on the fence with this brewery but I got a few more of their beers to try before I come up with a solid opinion on this brewery. A pretty unimpressive American IPA, I hope their other beers are much beer since this one wasn't good."
"O: Very run-of-the-mill IPA. Not sure if it was this one was a bit on the old side but not really too excited to try it again."
""
"Big thanks to Illudium for the sample!"
""
"This is a very malt-forward IPA. It's an easy drinking, smooth, refreshing beer that's both flavorful and balanced. It's definitely worth checking out."
""
"This is an extremely satisfying ipa. It doesn't look or smell like much, but when you drink it, everything comes together in this excellent beer."
""
"Astringent palate from start to finish. Slightly lemony and mineral earthy hop bite. Some mild toasted malt jumps in the middle of teh palate, but thats it. Pretty simple, easy IPA. Nothing special or bad really."

"O: As an IPA, I would rate this a 1.5. Style aside, it's more of a 3 beer. I would have guessed this was an English Pale Ale or possibly even a hopped up Cream Ale. This is not as advertised, and is very forgettable."
""
""
"o: Kind of a meh IPA."
""
"A very good IPA which I recommend."
"Overall a middle of the road IPA. One I would have again but not necessarily seek out."
""
""
""
"O: I enjoyed it, but it's a fairly mediocre IPA. Quite drinkable. Not particularly recommend. I might drink again, but probably not if I had other options."

"o - overall a tasty ipa, but rather muted all around. the flavor is nice and it is a good beer, but when looking for a knock out ipa, you should check elsewhere...however, the label describes the beer as a brilliant pale ale with an aggressive hop character. that kind of sums it up really well (but not like a sierra nevada pale ale, but a really great pale ale). as a pale ale, this is a better beer than as an ipa. kind of like a jai alai light? i have kind of mixed feelings on this beer since it is enjoyable, but i wouldn't reach for it when craving an ipa, but if i was craving a pale ale...this one would be way up there."
"This is an alright beer; I'm not going to pour it down the drain after taking a few sips, but I'm probably not going to jump to buy more of it. Of all the beers I have tried from Highland, this is my least favorite. It is labelled as an IPA, so I am judging it based on that. To me, there are not enough hops in this. When I am opening an IPA, I expect a fair amount of hops. This beer did have a good balance and a nice citrus flavor, but just not what I wanted in an IPA, which I was actually pretty excited about beforehand. I would say overall this beer is about average and would recommend other selections from this brewery before this one."
""
""
"Overall - It's by no means a hoppy IPA, in fact, I'd probably classify this more along the lines of a Belgian Pale Ale. However, for what it is, it's pretty good. The flavor, while nothing too spectacular is pretty good and it's fairly easy to drink."
""

""

"O/D - This is a solid beer in terms of looks and feel. To me, I would appreciate a bit more aroma from an IPA than this one has. The hop profile was a bit grassier than I prefer as well."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice and hoppy brew with a slight maltiness which allowed for superb drinkability and an excellent finish."
"The body is light and the carbonation is somewhat soft. Overall nothing offensive here but this one is a little bit boring. Enjoyable, but there are better IPAs on the market."
"Overall: Pretty decent beer--surprised me--not a huge flavor profile, but what is there is very good."
"O - A good drinkable IPA, nothing too crazy but well balanced and pleasantly bitter. Will defintely buy some more of these"
"Pours a crystal clear, medium-light golden body. A medium, foamy, white head settles slowly to a thin film with a prominent edge. Thick patchwork lacing coats the glass well. The aroma shows heavy nougat up front, with toasted caramel and orange/grapefruit hops following suit. I even picked up a bit of chocolate, which seems completely out of place in an IPA. The flavor follows suit almost exactly. Nougat, caramel, biscuit, and citrus hops provide the bulk of the flavor, but that weird chocolate note is still in there. Medium bodied and very easy to drink, despite its weirdness."
"Overall: A little let down by this one. The flavor is overall understated and watery."
"D-Pretty drinkable IPA especially given its abv. however, I would choose other options."
"Overall this beer was a disappointment and I probably wouldn't buy it again. Not terrible, but just not really any good."
"D - A fairly textbook slightly below average American IPA in my estimation... The nose and flavor are polar opposites which is probably the most off putting characteristic of this brew... Not terrible, but not something I would recommend nor seek out again..."
"Overall - This is a very well crafted IPA. I was glad to get to try one while on vacation in NC OBX as Highland Brewing doesn't distribute up in Maryland as far as I'm aware. Nice treat!"
"This is an IPA that you could drink 2 or 3 easily and not lose interest or get weighed down. Moreover, it's not the same old thing. As Highland claims, it's a wee bit different. Put me down as a big fan of the Highland philosophy of brewing. I'm lucky here in Atlanta to find Highland product just about everywhere, at least in the bottle. Finding it on tap is another issue. As it is right now for me financially, that's not a big issue. My beer consumption is mostly limited to buying reasonably priced bottled beer, and very little of that. Highland product is right down my alley."
"Overall a very tasty and drinkable IPA, quality beer from a brewery I give more respect every time I try a new beer of theirs."
"This IPA is wonderfully more hoppy than anticipated, a very noble effort."
"This beer pours a clear amber color with a finger of white foamy head that doesn't linger very long. The aroma has caramel malt notes, with some weak citrusy hop presence. The taste is similar, fairly weak on the hoppiness for what I would expect from an IPA. It also seems a little empty and watered down. The mouthfeel reflects this as well, but is balanced alright regarding carbonation. Overall an ok IPA, but would call it more a pale ale myself... it's right on the threshold."
"Color is a clear gold, with very little white head. The scent is some citrus and pine; nice but rather weak. Taste is mostly pine to grass up front, with maybe a bit of grapefruit. A surprising amount of malt flavor comes through in the finish, considering this is an IPA. Probably too malty for the style - this seems almost pilsener-like to me. A slight alcohol taste is noticeable in the aftertaste. Pretty average overall; not an IPA I'd go for again."
"Pours a crystalline clear gold with a small wite head. Smells weakly citrusy and a wee bit grassy. Slight yeast twinge too. Tastes nicley sweet and grassy. A scant amount of resinous pop. Really just a slightly over sour IPA. Mouthfeel and drinkablility are ok. This beer doesn't do a lot to seperate itself from the ""just another IPA"" herd. Could have choosen Harpoon IPA and been just as happy."
"O - Good beer but not a hop head's best bet. Well balanced and not overly demanding."
"Overall, not what I would call a noteworthy ipa. There are several I would take over this one as daily drinkers."
"O- Overall, a solid, refreshing IPA, but mellow in comparison with some other IPAs, which, depending on your taste, may not be a negative. A perfect beer for a spring/summer three beer session."
"O - I think I'll pass on this one again if offered, however, I've heard good things about some of their other beers that I am looking forward to trying."
"O - Not unpleasant, but nothing special. I'll be going back to Highlands other fine ales."
"Verdict: I didn't feel this beer. As fortune has it, I have another to help me draw a more accurate conclusion and clear up any confusion I may have had about this beer later on. In the meantime, I would recommend either some other American IPA or a Highland Classic, the Oatmeal Porter. Be wary. C+ (3.05)"
"Fairly drinkable. I'm more experienced with the hoppier brews, but this one could be one to have over a nice session."
"D - this might be the best offering from Highland that I have had. not a bad brew to pick up a six to share with friends."
"Not impressed. Considered a drain pour but man-ed up and finished it off."
"Good beer, I enjoyed it, I would like to see a bit more hop aroma."
"{Ratings confirmed on 5/6/11)"
"D - I didn't quite finish this one, just not appetizing."
"Light amber with a decent white head. Aroma is decent but fairly light. Taste is dry with a mild hop presence. Mildly sweet as well. Decent but overall somewhat underwhelming especially considering some other American IPAs being made. About average but nothing to search for."
"D: It's light enough without much bitterness so it is fairly drinkable. However, there just isn't much hop flavor there. I've had pale ales that were much hoppier than this beer."
"Fairly malt forward brew for an IPA...nice hoppiness, alot of citrus character, carbonation brings about the umphh of the citrus nicely, lots of pine in the aftertaste, leaves a lasting impact on the tongue after each sip, slight floral notes accent the maltiness well. Not as hop crazy as other IPA's I've had, but at the same time it's very well balanced, as seems to be the case with most of highlands beers. Bready malt and slight sweetness with a touch of grain seems to mingle nicely with the hop character of this beer. Drinkability is good, very balanced and enjoyable beer, not sure what was going on with the metallic taste in the last bottle, glad I re-reviewed this one."
"Notes: looks, smells, tastes, and feels like a really good German pilsner, but really lacks as an IPA"
"The beer pours a hazy gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale and biscuit malt scent along with nice piney hop aroma. The taste is good as well. It has your basic East IPA flavor; pale and biscuit malt, piney hops. It's smooth and easy drinking with a hint of bready character. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty standard IPA. It's balanced and true to style; a fine session ale."
"D - Low. This is not a very good IPA. Was hoping for more."
"Dave"
"D: Too bitter for my tastes. This was given as a gift and is not a beer I would seek to purchase."
"This is a session beer for sure, good solid offering from Highland Brewing. I really enjoyed this IPA!"
"D - another great offering from Highland. This was a flavorful IPA that is more sweet than bitter. Really glad I got the chance to try this one."
"I could literally drink this stuff all day. Guess it's a combination of the low alcohol and a pretty darn delicious beer. Good stuff."
"A solid entry in the IPA class. Nicely hoppy, with bright fresh hops notes. A bit of pepperyness toward the finish, with a touch of sweet malt. While I've found Highland's offerings to be a bit bland in their basic style offerings, the brewery produces some very nice products toward the ends of the dark and hoppy parts of the spectrum."
"OVERALL: This is an interesting IPA and I wish that I had more access to it. Living in Chicago, I cannot get it at the moment. I like it, but it has a unique taste in the IPA world and I feel that if I had a little more time to spend with it I would learn to appreciate it more. Maybe next year if I can manage to get into law school at UNC."
"So this was bitter and not sweet, which I like as a variety. It isn't my favorite IPA, and I probably wouldn't try it again until I had the opportunity to have it on-tap. Highland Brewing Co. hails from Ashville, NC. What is the point of enjoying craft beer if you can't find something to appreciate about the local folk?"
"Pours a pale yellow color with orange notes and a nice white head and some lacing. Smells of oranges and strong hop aroma. Tastes average with some strong bitter hops and floral notes. Mouthfeel is okay with a decent drinkability. I don't generally drink IPA but this isn't entirely a bad choice."
"M- Overly carbonated."
"Worth trying, not my type of IPA, but enjoyable."
"D - Smooth and mellow. A good session beer."
"Foul."
"d= just an average ipa, havent really had a bad one just ipas that are worth a shot but dont really compete with similarly priced beers"
"D- overall, not bad. Though I agree with other comments that the Highland's Gaelic Ale was better."
"Standard IPA - not offensive, but there are far better beers available."
"Pours a hazy, orange/tangerine with a finger of white head. Some lace, not too much retention however. Nice, but not overly impressive. Big hit of citrus, leaning more towards orange and some lemon zest. Nice hops here, very little malt detectable in the nose. Certainly hop forward in the taste, again significantly citrusy, with orange, lemon zest and some peach in here too. Not a ton of malt here, and feels quite unbalanced. Still quite a bit of bite to this one although it's probably a little past its prime. Good mouthfeel, medium-high carbonation and goes down quite quickly so it gets some points for drinkability. Decent IPA."
"Overall not bad. however, i was more impressed with their Gaelic Ale."
"D-This beer is pretty sessoinable. I suggest this beer to any hop lover."
"Sort of English in many ways. Decent ipa, but the hop selection is not optimal imo."
"D: Low ABV and solid flavor make this a highly drinkable IPA. I would almost tend to classify it in the English IPA camp because of the hop varietals and flavor profile, but that's probably a semantic issue. Kashmir IPA is a strong choice for anyone seeking a hop-forward, yet well balanced session IPA."
"Somewhat different from your typical American IPA, or at least a West Coast variety, but drinkable nonetheless..."
"Overall a subpar IPA. I'm having trouble downing the last few gulps."
"Poured from the glass with nice white head,aroma was a bit on the weak side.Got alot of hop at first,good bitterness,but lacking in any lingering hop flavor.Overall this beer was a little thin in malt character as well as hop character.Good for the golf course or watching the game,not so good to sit and savor."
"The last one of my mixed six pack while down on vacation. Poured a nice light color into a glass. not too much foam head to speak of and didn't leave any lacing. Overall its not too hoppy with a nice balance of malts. I prefer a more hop centered IPA but this one works well for people who arent as hop centered."
"The palate is quite a bit better. Very English in interpretation, this has a moderate English base malt character quite prominent. Quite bitter, the hops are a lot more noticeable than on the nose. They've used a blend of English and American hops in this brew, and it shows. A blend of a rather pithy bitterness and plenty of earthy and mildly herbal hops. Drying on the finish, there's a bit of malt character present along with a moderate bitterness. The palate is surprisingly slick and smooth, despite the carbonation. I guess it's all the dextrins in there. Decent stuff, I'm thankful I got a chance to try it. While not the best out there, the interesting hop character makes for a worthwhile drink. At least, it's not another indistinguishable Alpine citrus/ tropical fruit hop bomb."
"Overall, this is just yet another solid from Highland Brewery. It's a good, bitter IPA, though I wouldn't the addition of a few more hops. I can't complain though, this is a good IPA that I certainly would not resist drinking again."
"Drinkable for sure, hints of an English IPA given the hop profile."
"d- decent IPA that certainly won't replace any stand-bys, but I wouldn't be disappointed if I had picked up a 6pk. it is a very easy drinker, but I really don't see my self picking this one up again anytime soon."
"It seems that the REGION is a bit weak (the mid-south), but when I find myself thereabouts in the future I will continue to search for good local beer. Also, I would be willing to give any of the Highlands a second chance on tap. Some were pretty OK (the porter, especially)."
"Decent but not likely to get this again."
"D - If the hop profile was a little different I would have liked this beer a lot more if bitter beer is your thing this is worth a shot"
"Picked up a bottle from Corolla Wine and Cigar Gourmet. Poured with a short head and a bit of lacing. Immediately I was hint with a whiff of weed smell. Also mixed in is a hit of sharp grapefruit that continues and dominates the flavor. There's also a dry toffee malt flavor with clean barley notes. I appreciate that this isn't your average IPA, but it's also not the best I've had. All things considered, I recommend checking this out."
"Mouthfeel is great. Light, pale, well carbonated. This is a well brewed beer. I like it but don't love it. Solid beer."
"D: There's nothing wrong with this beer, but it's also nothing special. Curious whether this is better fresh or just is just way the beer is brewed. Drinkable for certain, but not a stand-out."
"@ flying saucer in Nashville. I asked the waitress to make sure I hadn't been served the wrong beer by mistake. Is this really an IPA? Where are the hops? Maybe I'm spoiled by living on the West Coast, but this just doesn't qualify as an IPA at all. It would be a decent Pale Ale. Maybe they need to change their recipe or rename this, but it's not an IPA."
"I want to like it, starts off interesting but gets a bit harsh, not sure what it is. Bitter but not hoppy, with no wonderful hop aroma. The beer seems stuck between styles, which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but I don't think I would want more than one at a time."
"I don't really know what to say about this one. Has to be the oddest IPA I ever encountered. The more I drink it the more I think I don't like it. I know it is fresh because the owners just brought all the inventory up to date. Could it possibly be my first bad bottle? I really don't think so."
"Close to two fingers of fluffy cream white foam, preponderance of larger bubbles has it quickly dimpling towards the surface, leaves a good deal of lacing behind. Hazy chrome orange in appearance, traps the light inside nicely, lighter yellow towards the rims. The nose leans on orange, tangerine citrus, coriander, white pepper before allowing for scone, honeyed bread notes, general maltiness more than distinct scents, maybe cocoa, apricot and peach scents demure, more of a slugger than a puncher. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is very active, stirring things up throughout. Here the clove, coriander spice really takes hold. This pairs well with the orange, white grapefruit citrus, the latter not sweet. No lack of green grass, leafy characteristics. Spicier towards the end, as in peppery bite. An energetic little cuss but could use more balance and smoothness."
"this is a typical east coast ipa...nothing terrible but nothing earth shattering either.."
"The taste is nearly all hops. Very piney and citrusy. As in the nose, there is also a good bit of sweet malts to balance the hops out. This is neither done in the tradition of west coast IPA's that focus more on huge hop profiles while completely neglecting the balance that a good malt presence can provide, or in the tradition of the east coast IPA's that focus too much on balance at the expense of the big hop presence that should define and IPA... I really enjoyed this IPA, another stellar showing by the guys at Highland."
"A good example of a pretty solid American IPA. Pretty big flavor, nice mouthfeel, decent ABV, I could definitely drink more than one of these in a sitting. My only real beef was with the appearance, but it certainly wasn't bad. Not a bad beer at all from a brewery that is slowly becoming one of my go-tos here in the Southeast."
"Overall a pretty good but not great IPA. Pleasant to drink if nothing else."
"Another average beer I poured into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was cloudy and golden dark colored. The beer had an average white head. The beer was a little hoppy smelling and tasting. I did not like the beer very much, just another IPA. average tio say the least. I will not buy again."
"Buy Again? Yes"
"Cheers!"
"D: Very drinkable. I would rate drinkability a bit higher if this beer didn't finish as bitter or at least balanced it with a touch of spice or sweetness."
"MF/D: Medium body, bittersweet grapefruit finish that lingers for a little while"
"Overall, a pretty decent beer which i'd have again."
"There's not a lot of carbonation, which I would have wanted more of, but it does have a good mouthfeel. The drinkability suffers a tiny bit because of the lower carbonation but it is a tasty beer."
"Very drinkable beer. It is not exactly what some would consider to be an IPA but I do enjoy this beer. I will definitely purchase a sixer when I get the chance."
"D - Very good drinkability. Though the date doesn't indicate ""bottled on"" or ""best by," I am assuming the former. When I can get a fresher bottle I may revisit & revise accordingly. In any case, this is the beer & brewery that got me started on craft beer; cheers for that."
"Value: I've seen this for under ten bucks a sixer. Great deal for this one."
"Definitely a must try."
"Average."
"D"
"As a matter of preference I don't particularly care for grapefruit, as it's flavors tend to be overpowering and leave an aftertaste, whether it be beer or the fruit itself. This however is very good well executed brew that goes down smooth and begs for more to be drank."
"A pale amber color, clear with a good off-white head and very nice lacing. The aroma brings a solid malty pine hop, bready and full, very decent with a touch of floral sweetness. The flavor suggests swamp bread and watery citrus hop with a weak malt hint. The hop is reasonably present, perhaps more along the line of a pale ale, but it's not particularly appealing in taste. It's a fairly thinnish brew, lightly carbonated and midland drinkable. Not very memorable but passable. Certainly not much of an ipa."
"Overall this is a pretty well-done American IPA. Not great, but would buy again."
"Light grapefruit body, mild white foam, but no real head to speak of on an aggressive pour. Some yeast like spores present in the top too. Nose is nice, malts, oats really dominate this at present. I think I've had this for 6 months at least in the fridge; so I'm thinking the hop aroma has probably receded a bit. Taste is another story, lots of bitters noticed up front with a quick wash over the tongue. Mouth is actually a decent balance of malts and hops for an ipa, or a good English style IPA maybe. Body is perfectly carbonated and has a nice texture on the palette, but the flavors are pretty hidden and deep. Finish is almost pale ale like, hops are very mild in this one. Lacing is almost consistent through the entire drink too."
"I would like to say thanks to Sholland119 for tossing this in as an extra. I am very glad to have tried it. It is worth a shot if it is readily available. Thanks Scott!"
"my 1st beer from North carolina, i'm impressed. thanks brent K on the trade."
"This is a VERY average IPA. I have been drinking a LOT of American IPA's lately, and this is probably one of my least favorites. Decent amount of hoppiness, but not much balance. The taste and smell is fairly average in comparison to most micro-brews I've tried. It's a good beer, but not worth the price of admission in comparison to it's competitors. I HIGHLY recommend checking out Bell's Two Hearted Ale, and Dogfish Head's 60 and 90 min IPA's. Stone makes a great IPA too, along with Smuttynose, and Anderson Valley. There are others too that I'd prefer over this one."
"Drinkability: A clean and solid IPA that needs a little more kick to it. Would reach for it over other IPA's but it still doesn't give me the kick in the ass I get from other IPA's. But, this is a good closer to a night of drinking."
"Drinkability: A very good IPA that is well balanced. It would be much better with a stronger, more pronounced hop aroma. However, this is a clean, crisp drinking IPA worth sessioning. Try it!"
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a small white head, decent lacing. Aroma is caramel malts, light citrus hops. Flavor is sweet malts, earthy, pine and citrus hops. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium, dry, pretty bitter at the end. Pretty good beer, well balanced, drinkable."
"Purchased at Derk's Fillet & Vine in Montgomery, Alabama. Highland Kashmir IPA from Highland Brewing pours a rich looking copper with a small but long lasting head. The aroma is malty with hops present. The taste is the same with hops really coming through on the tongue. Some oiliness is present which I like very much. I'd call this one a mild IPA. What a great surprise from a brewery that I'm not real familiar with. Can't wait to try other Highland products. Nicely done."
"More of a pale ale than an IPA. Not overwhelmingly bitter at all. A slight caramel maltiness in the beginning, with a nice bitter grapefruit-y hop finish. A good session beer, as it will not overwhelm your taste buds at all. Very tasty addition from the Highland Brewery"
"While not outstanding, this is a solid beer and better than I'd remembered."
"This is a malty IPA; unusually light hop for the style. But there is a solid level of a body. I can feel alcohol warmth in my mouth. It's a pleasant beer, but it's not like an IPA--closer to an Amber or a mild pale ale."
"Very nice brew, I like it."
"mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lightly dry mouthfeel and a semi-dry aftertaste. somewhat weak on the palate. drinkability is decent. as far as IPAs go, this is a weak example. not much hop quality and a finish of little hop bitterness."
"I've had this on tap and it is very good. I read some recent reviews and they are much lower than the ale deserves. It may have been a bad batch, so I hope you'll try it again because this is one of my favorites for a mild IPA. Not too piney or hoppy, but good."
"D: Drinkable, but dull and boring. Plenty of better IPA's on the market."
"This brew has a zesty hop smell with slight malt undertones. Pours to a golden yellow with a big highly structured head that holds and leaves lacing as it recedes. Taste is sweet and slightly bitter without much fanfare. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, despite the great head, this brew needs some more carbonation. Hops are way too subdued for a IPA. The bitterness is there but dull without aroma. This brew is in dire need of late stage or dry hopping. Nothing like I expected."
"Drinkability is high i guess. Not a very complex brew."
"I would try it again if i find it."
"Well, hell, I know what I'm drinking in session the next time I'm around Asheville. This must be very good out of the tap, too. Doesn't come out of the gates quickly but it's a marathon, not a sprint. Thanks Chris!"
"A yellowish-orange color in the glass, poured here with a moderately sized head, maybe 1cm, that left a little bit of lacing as I drank. Looks about average, nothing incredibly impressive. The smell is very earthy, different that I expected, and there's almost a kind of catty, skunky smell to it. Very low on the citrus effect you expect from an American IPA. I can also detect a moderate amount of resinous hop presence. The taste is a bit toasty and bready upfront, kind of stuck somewhere between dry and sweet. A kind of powerful malt backbone, with a light lemon and orange hop presence. Very low bitterness due to the moderate sweetness, low ester presence, and very low on the resins in the taste. I've had much worse, but there's room for improvement, perhaps a bit more flavor and aroma hops are in order. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but is carried through by the sweetness. The carbonation was kind of low, it started out with a slight prickle, and eventually was left as just a tiny rush of tingling bubbles by the finish. This beer is pretty easy to drink, nothing offensive, no harsh bitterness or odd flavors, but nothing really impressive in the flavor. Worth a shot, but it probably will not be a staple beer."
"12oz bottle. Pours a slightly hazy copper with a small off-white head. Smells slightly malty with some caramel notes, followed by piney hop bitterness. Nothing overwhelming. The taste is strongly malty with a bready character. Hop bitterness is strong in the background. Not terribly complex. Medium body with high carbonation. Not incredibly drinkable, though far from offensive."
"Drinkability: A smooth, pleasant, easy-going IPA that strays away from the excessively assertive, brutal hop doses that many West Coast IPA's deliver."
"D - For an IPA, this is really malt forward. I would prefer more hop flavor and aroma in this one. Maltiness makes it feel heavy, decreasing its overall drinkabilitiy."
"D- Overall, not a bad brew and easy to drink. Judging by style though, this seems a bit too balanced or at least more of an English IPA."
"D - Drinkable but a bit bland. Nice, if somewhat subdued hop character and powerful malt that leads to excellent balance. Overall, good but not great."
"Poured a golden body with two-finger head with tints of orange. A semi-sweet malt smell mixed with some floral hops. Taste is the same as the hops make their appearance, bring some herbal bitterness and citric quality, but this is a lighter IPA that has some good malt sweetness as well. Also some spicing as well (corriander?). Not a typical IPA but I enjoyed this beer."
"Lighter copper color, almost orange tint. Thin wispy head and not especially fragrant for an IPA. The taste is also on the lighter side - caramel malt and subtle grapefruit. Mouthfeel is pretty average, maybe a little thin. But all things considered, it's a smooth drinking beer. A relaxed refreshing IPA that's still lively enough to keep your taste buds interested 3 or 4 beers in. I could definitely lose track of how many of these I'd put down."
"It didn't start well, but halfway through it became a pretty decent IPA. This is probably really satisfying super fresh. :)"
"a great IPA although id like to see a bit more hop character. i may assume they are going for more of an English/Scottish style which would make this less hoppy but over all a good IPA."
"drinkability: an extremly easy drinkin IPA. Great session. great flavor and easy to pound. I really like it for that reason."
"D: Definitely hoppy with some malt character. Frankly, very drinkable for this style."
"Decent and one that I would consider ordering again. A little heavier than most IPA's, though."
"Overall this is a fine IPA and an impressive first Highland Brewing beer for me. I'm looking forward to trying the rest of their line."
"Overall, I did enjoy this beer. I would if I could get this beer here if I wanted something to enjoy over the night without worring about getting a big buzz."
"D= Great. I really enjoy this beer. The smooth maltiness is a great compliment to the hop dominance you usually get with ipa's the hops are great and it's just great. I love it."
"Flavor is of toasted biscuits, weird off-meat flavor, and some hints of sour lemon on the end. This tastes more like an APA in my mind. Nothing tells me this is an IPA. I'm gonna move on from this one, and avoid in the future."
"M: very clean and crisp. Solid and mellow, but with a nice bite."
"Pours a light orange color with disappearing head. Smells of light floral and slight citrus notes. Taste is a creamy citrus sweetness with an odd back bite of bitterness. Very odd ipa. Lighter mouthfeel almost a spiciness to it. Heavier maltiness but not overpowering. Allright IPA, nothing spectacular."
"odd bitterness takes away from drinkability a bit."
"Unsure of this beers age but the hop profile is non existant. As it is it seems more of an amber ale with very low hops characteristics."
"Pours a cloudy yellow in color. No head to speak of, only faint lacing on the glass. Smell is faint hops and some barley. Taste is of fairly weak hops. Crisp, refreshing in the taste and mouthfeel. A decent patio beer. I've had much better offerings from Highland so this seems to be a one beer problem and not a brewery problem for me."
"Getting some caramel malts, also a little biscuit, and some mild citrus hops. I'm generally looking for more hops in my IPA's but if you looking for balance this is the brew for you."
"The appearance was a huge letdown, but this turned into a pretty solid brew."
"Highland Kashmir IPA pours a pale orange with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a mild citrusy aroma. There is a very nice mouthfeel, silky and a bit on the thick side. The flavor has a nice hoppy thing going on, but it's also fairly spicy. Hoppy but not really a hop bomb. Pretty good, definitely worth a try."
"After tasting several IPAs from domestic breweries in recent months, I was very happy with Kashmir. It meets my expectations of aggressive hoppiness I expect from an IPA, but without overdoing it to the point that its hard to drink. I tend to find many IPAs lacking in drinkability to a degree, but Kashmir left me wating more. This is definitely my favorite Highland brew as of yet, and its pretty high on my list of IPAs in general."
"will buy again and suggest you try for yourself...(NOTE: i first had this beer on tap and suggest this over a bottle)..."
"Unfortunately, this one was a bit of a snooze fest for me. I wanted to enjoy it and give it a chance. I even finished the whole thing in hopes that I would be swayed at some point. It's just not realy an IPA to me. In fact, I'd say it's a bit of a stretch to call it a hoppy Pale Ale. The hops seemed ""stale"" to me but I'm unsure of the age of the bottle outside of when I purchased it (5 months ago in SC). Up the ante on the hops 3 fold and pump up the malt bill a bit and let's start talking IPA's."
"Pours a nice orangish amber color with an off-white head. The aroma is caramel, malt and some citrusy hops! The taste has a solid malt backbone for an IPA with a dose of citrusy hops in the finish. Overall, Kashmir IPA is a pretty solid IPA that is definitely worth a try. Recommended!"
"Even though this beer might not satisfy hardcore hop heads, it was a super tasty IPA nevertheless. Overall, a very sessionable and well crafted version of the style."
"D - This is a pretty mild IPA, and a very drinkable one. I could session with this beer, but it's definitely not recommended for the hardcore hopheads."
"A good, but not great, beer. I would drink this again."
"D - A rather tame IPA but also unique and refreshing. I can't decide whether I'd keep it mild or amp it up a bit, but as it is it's still an enjoyable brew."
"Good mouthfeel and good balance in an ipa. I am glad this is now in my market."
"The aroma has a grassy and floral hop with malt, and yeast. The appearance is hazy gold with an average head. The flavor is like the aroma except its astringent. The palate is smooth. Overall it's interesting but it's not a good IPA. Its bitter in a soapy way."
"Drinkability is good. Not an outstanding IPA but solid enough and low enough abv to make this a session IPA."
"D: Tasty and drinks pretty easy."
"T- Taste of hops but with a smooth finish. Very palatable IPA that might be dangerous because of its ease of taste. A nice selection from Highland. Picked this up at a corner store. I've had other Highland selections and this does not diappoint. Good strong taste that is not too hoppy or bitter. Nice flavor combinations make this a must have again. Glad to see that I can pick up a local brew that is of such high quality."
"M/D - It was a little heavier than I was expecting. A little too think for my taste. I think it was good, but not something I would search out again."
"A dark golden hue with a respectable top. Aroma is a little subtle with some malt and citrus but also with a slightly pungent background. Citrus flavor and slightly off caramel. I think they were going for a woodsy feel but it falls a little short. Not bad at all, but I think a little more bitterness would help."
"Mouthfeel, is full and smooth. This is a very drinkable beer, and it is good, but I am not a huge fan of it as an IPA."
"D= Very drinkable, but not one I would want to drink again (if that makes sense). Not a lot to object to here becasue there isn't a lot here. A bit of a one trick pony, but still, if you like ""lighter"" IPAs and like west coast hops, this will be the one for you!"
"The smell of hops is prevalent, and it tastes like a smoother IPA than most. The mouthfeel is smooth, and crisp. I love this IPA, the hops are not overpowering, and the crisp taste is one not to be missed."
"D: This is a good IPA. It goes down easy and has a nice taste to it. Not the greatest IPA, but still quite well done."
"Thanks to michaeld23 for this one."
"Drinkability: Like I said up there in the taste, this isn't a bad or offensive beer, it's just not particularly impressive. The malt profile is sort of dry and biscuity, the hops pretty standard ... can't recommend this one, though I won't say it's an ""avoid."""
"Not bad. Decent IPA with a moderate hop bite but nothing that really made it stand out. Still quite drinkable though."
"Drinkability- If this was more readily available to me I'd probably pick it up fairly often. Despite being more malty than most IPAs, it makes this beer particularly well balanced and I like it. I can see where this is called kashmir because it is so smooth, delicate, and soft in the mouthfeel. Very easily drinkable."
"Taste is standard IPA fare (that's not a bad thing!). Doesn't stand out from the crowd, but I'd never mind standing around the backyard grill with one in my hand."
"Picked this one up at Brawley's Beverage in NC. Pours a golden/orange color with a decent off-white head with some retention. First scent I got was malty followed by light floral hopping. Malts are present in the flavor as well and hops are perhaps a bit light for an IPA but there's at least more of a crisp bitter grapefruit hoppy taste than the aroma would indicate, which is a good thing. I thought their Pale Ale was a bit underhopped as well. Anyways, not a top shelf IPA but certainly drinkable."
"Overall: A nice American IPA. Nothing out of the ordinary, but still enjoyable."
"Drinkability - Glad I was able to be talked into a growler as my first impressions are very impressive for an IPA. I would gladly drink this again, matches well with a flavorful pizza."
"D - I love IPA's and pizza... Going to preheat the oven now..."
"With great smoothness, mellow drinkability, and plenty of hop bite, Kashmir IPA is easily my favorite offering so far from Highland. Outstanding!"
"D - great drinkability. Wondefully hoppy. I think I had like 3 of these. No, I did not drive. My sister was there too and enjoyed one. Would love to drink again (and again)"
"Finish is the only thing that keeps me from sessioning this beer. I could drink 1 maybe 2...but would be easily ready to move on to another beer after."
"Pours a dark golden with a nice rocky head that fades to a cap and leaves some decent lacing. Smells light, minerally, and a bit bready as well. The taste is also quite bready and there is a lingering earthy bitterness that is almost metallic, but fairly pleasant. This combines well with the deep breadiness. Pretty pleasant, but maybe a little heavy for a session beer. There are some developing waxy citrus notes as well that I like. I'm reviewing this in the bottle, but I think this is particularly good on cask."
"this would be a great beer on cask more drinkable at the warmer cellar temperature"
"Enjoyed this one a great deal and noticed that there's a little west coast in the Carolinas. Nice IPA."
"D - goes down easy"
"M/D - Medium bodied and a good level of carbonation. A good IPA, but nothing spectacular."
"Not bad. Quite a solid single IPA."
"Notes: Thanks to Loki for this one. My first NC brew!"
"Very, very well crafted brew that surprised me with how hoppy it was. This would be an excellent session brew even with the bite..."
"Taste hits first with the hops, good piney elements, malt and sweetness kicks in later."
"I had this on tap at Brixx Wood-Fired Pizza in Raleigh. It was hazy and golden straw colored with a thin creamy foam. The aroma is hoppy and a little newly cut grass. The taste was caramelly malt and bitterness, especially in the after-taste. The bitterness is what stuck with me from this beer. Drinkability is OK, it was definitely good with a pizza."
"Highland hasn't really put out anything displeasing to my palate."
"I would drink this if it was local."
"Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for this one. It pours a cloudy pale orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a fluffy quarter inch of lacing. The aroma is of pine resin, and grapefruit. The taste begins with pine, then shifts toward grapefruit and a lingering bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a decent IPA. It is easily drinkable, but it doesn't ""wow"" me."
"Medium bodied and smooth with a perfect amount of carbonation. Great drinkability. All this flavor with only 5.6% abv - I smell a session beer. Stood up to and paired well with some spicy fajitas."
"Color is a typical but appetizing coppery amber, somewhat cloudy. Aroma is rich and strongly hoppy with a malty undertone. Flavor is rich and very hoppy but not too bitter - very satisfying. This is one sassy and jazzy IPA, not superb but definitely worth a try if you like hoppy beers."
"This was a good IPA overall. I liked it but didn't love it. It's basic but gets the job done. Another nice Highland brew."
"D: This is an approachable IPA with tempered bitterness... it won't blow your socks off, but is a nice, tasty brew."
"Pretty weak effort, I'm afraid. Unfortunately I have three more to finish off. Maybe I'm spoiled by easy access to Sweetwater's IPA which is really, really good and not even that expensive, but I won't be buying the Highland Kashmir IPA again."
"D: The aroma was lacking and I prefer much more citrus in an IPA. Otherwise, it was decent & fairly drinkable."
"Pours a semi hazy bright, light orange with a diminishing head. Smell is bland and light citrusy malt with no real hop presence to speak of. Taste is thin with a watery hop flavor and some orange citrusy characteristics. Nice moderate bitterness and more hop flavor in the taste than in the smell at least. Still something kind of dusty, musty and odd about this, as if it has an almost mold flavor. Drinkable."
"Overall: Not my favorite IPA, but the taste is quite fetching and keeps me coming back for more. Highland exhibits a high level of quality across the board."
"This poured dark amber with a little head. It had the scent of yeast and light hops. It had a smooth flavor of yeast and moderate citrus hops. It wasn't very bitter and had a fairly weak aftertaste, but I still really liked it. Maybe it was just my mood that day, as I typically prefer the stronger and more flavorful beers. But sometimes it's nice to have something a little more simple for a change of pace, to give your palette a rest."
"Pours a clear amber, medium sized white head forms, leaves behind some solid lace spots, thin ring sticks around the glass. Smell is nice, vanilla and caramel, big citrus and grapefruit middle, oats, cereal, very fruity, some brown sugar, pretty unique aroma. Taste is lots of grapefruit, very sugary middle, vanilla and caramel, malty, biscuits, almost woody, floral finish, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied, medium carbonation, quite nice. Not my favourite IPA but I found this pretty unique for the style. Thanks for sharing Russ!"
"drinkability is good. well balanced and interesting. seems to lean more towards being an english ipa than an american, but nice."
"This was drinkable, but not stellar."
"A good IPA. The aroma is not hoppy, its more on the spicey characteristic. The appearance is cloudy yellow, with dot bubbles. The taste is well balanced and rather chai, saison-like. Its bitter and more offset by spicey-yeastness than by the normal sweetness. Nicely done change of pace."
"D- This is not extreme in the least. Could easily be sessioned but there is definitely other things I would pick first."
"D - Pretty good IPA, but it drinks more like a hopped-up ESB, with sweet caramel malt base and floral/perfumy hop characteristics. I prefer more of a citrus or piney hop profile in an IPA, but this is still pretty tasty."
"Overall: Not too bad overall, if you like you IPA's malty. This one is more about the malt than the hops. Not too bad overall, but does not rank up with my top IPA's."
"Hazy gold with a thin head that lacked motivation or direction. Aromas of faintest citrus oils. The flavor was the shocker - I just couldn't taste that much. There was some hop bitterness, and even the moaning ghost of citrus herbal hop character, but it tasted locked away and submerged beneath the bubbles. A little toasty malt rounds it out, but I'm missing the IPA part here, unless this one has already been on a sailing vessel all the way to India and back to North Carolina (where your not-so-humble hoss sits sipping this). I even smelled my clean shirt I put on a few hours ago after a shower, and it has more going than this beer. Medium body, bitter finish. I can drink this fine, but I wouldn't pay for it. If it was your homebrew, I would gladly have one whenever I came over. I'll try one more in a couple days and get back to you."
"This beer pours a hazy pale gold with an ample white head that laces and holds nicely. The smell is of toasty, biscuit like and staw like with an interplay of citrus and spicy hops. The taste is up front with the hops as would be expected, but the malt characteristics also have a significant role here. This is certainly not quite as assertive of an IPA in the flavor department as would be desired for an American IPA. The mouthfeel is dry and appropriately medium bodied. Overall, a good IPA. This wouldn't be my first choice, but I would never say no to it."
"Overall this is a very good IPA - and it's from my home state to boot! I really liked the floral hoppiness and the nice lingering without overdoing the bitterness. The color and aroma can really throw you - you wouldn't expect this kind of robust flavor coming out like it does. I very much enjoyed this brew."
"Poured into a pint glass (Scorpion) a nice golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy off-white head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing. The nose is more on the malt side, but a nice little touch of hops, slight citrus, not much pineyness at all. The taste is malty, some hoppiness, really not much citrus or pines in this one. Medium body. Drinkable, I like this one, but not what I would look for in an IPA."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - the beer is a clouded medium gold, with ample carbonation that leads up to two fingers of light tan head that provides tons of lacing. The aroma consists of mild toasted malts, American hops and some heat, but is pretty weak. Lots of bitterness on the palate from the piney, citric and perfumy/spicy hops, on top of a really dry, medium body that is a bit tingly and leaves a long finish. Overall a nice, drinkable IPA, but nothing earth-shattering."
"Overall a very pleasurable pint. Not exemplary but a quality brew I would buy another six of any day."
"Pours a hazy brownish orange color. Quickly vanishing head with plenty of lacing left behind. The aroma is a floral and citrus hops, with some maltiness in the background. The taste is citrus with a far amount of bitterness. The aftertaste is bitter hops and somewhat astringent. This is a decent IPA but slightly lower in hop kick than many IPAs."
"drinkability: decent"
"Drinkability- IPAs are not my usual but this one is not bad."
"Well, if you're after a real piney citrus bomb this is it. 'Kashmir' evokes a kind of exotic twist on the style of the beer and they went for it. Unfortunately, to me it felt like the brewer's emphasis on the aggressive pine flavors threw the beer off balance and made it a bit of a chore to drink. It wasn't a terrible experience but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy this beer again. Highland brews some good beers but this isn't a high point in their catalog."
"Overall- This is a very nice and enjoyable beer as a session beer or just as a stand alone. This is a great offering and is a great representation of style. I think this is my favorite Higland offering to date, but I do have a few more to try."
"This beer poured a hazy golden color with a thick white head  quickly dissipating. The aroma is of hops with an undertone of sweetness. The taste is malty and hoppy all at the same time. There is a bitterness that lingers after tasting. Great flavor balance in this IPA. The mouthfeel is medium with a touch of creaminess. Overall, this may not be the boldest IPA, but it is quite drinkable!"
"Overall, a major disappointment. One doesn't expect super sweet, grainy flavors to dominate in an IPA, but that's exactly what you have here. Highland makes some decent beers. In my opinion, this isn't one of them. Skip this one and try something else in their lineup."
"Drinkability - nothing spectacular but easy enough to drink a handful."
"D: I would gladly have another bottle or two of this. The drink goes down easy and adds bigger flavor kicks at all the right spots."
"D - Easy drinking session beer that is a touch light on the aroma/flavor."
"Bottle: Poured a light orangey color ale with a small foamy head with some good retention and some medium lacing. Aroma of bitter malt is dominating with no discernable notes of caramel malt. Taste is also dominated by some deep bitter hops notes with some subtle malt presence. I would have appreciated some more notes of citrus or resin. Body is about average with some medium carbonation."
"Nice beer received in the CEO / Old farters BIF from unclejedi"
"Lightly carbonated and extremely drinkable. If this was available in my area I could envision myself picking up a 6 pack from time to time."
"Looks very similar to their pale ale apricot copper slightly hazed with a billowing bright white head rises above the edge of my pint and has large bubbles floating to the top, so far great retention and lacing is thin and sporadic. Aromatics are muted here much more so than the dry hopped pale ale, some citrus and floral hop nose but not that impressive. Some fruity notes with a touch of alcohol make their presence known as well. Flavor is pretty much grapefruit pith and floral perfume tones an astringent bitterness lacquers the palate from the first sip to the finish a touch of balancing malt sugars provide enough sweetness to make this tolerable but this brew comes off one dimensional same flavor aspect working over and over again. Mouthfeel is oily carbonatin is sturdy and tickles the back of the throat definitely medium bodied some protein filled thickness is definitely welcomed in the texture. Drinkability is so so I'm not a fan of the one dimensional hop bitterness IPA that lacks in hop flavor, I'm a hophead but I like to see balance and harmony in the combonation of malts marrying hops that doesn't go down here."
"Very good, light IPA. Could use more hops, but a pleasant summer sipper nonetheless."
"Drinks pretty easy, kind of tame for a AIPA though, but solid, none the less"
"Thanks to meechum for the extra in a trade."
"Overall for my first try at IPAs I think this was a great one to try..another good offering from Highland brewing, I have yet to meet a beer of theirs I didn't like."
"Pours a nice hazy dark golden with a one finger head. Nice retention and sticky lacing. Aroma is very nice blend of malts and citrus hops. Taste is citrus malts and sweet malts without a bad bitterness. Very easy drinking IPA, which is exactly what I like. If I lived in Asheville, this would easily be a go-to beer, and that would be great. Very nice IPA."
"This is on tap all overt he place in Western North Carolina, but I had it at Bele Chere, and cannot believe I havent reviewed this before. Been drinking it for a long time, I guess I just never got around to typing up the review, so anyway here it goes. Poured a nice golden amber, a touch hazy, with good visible carbonation. Nice two inch head slowly faded away to just a layer of lace on the top. Decent side lace on the glass as well, looks like a good IPA. Smell was very sweet and hoppy Lots of orange and tangerine, but a definate malty back was apparent and was obviously present. The taste is great, a nice light hoppy IPA. A touch sticky with a good bitter dry aftertaste. First flavors that come through are nice fresh citrus followed by a touch of sugar and a yeasty bread flavor that is lingering around in the back. Very well balanced. A nice smooth drink, good carbonation and easy drinker. This is a definate classic session IPA. I could really drink this all night long. One of my favorite local IPA's and a good representation of the quality brewing going on around here. If you gcan get it, go for its a definate winner. If you cant get it give me a shout I will send ya some!"
"Orange with a soapy white head that leaves a touch of lacing on the glass that quickly runs back down. The taste is initially very good with hop oils seeming to jump onto my tongue, a little bitterness in the after taste, and just plain delicious. I get so partial to hop bombs that I sometimes overlook nice balanced IPAs such as this one. However, as it warmed it was not so good. The mouthfeel is chewy. Ok stuff but I might not make a second purchase."
"D- Excellent. I had a six pack when I came back from the store yesterday, and now I have one left... This could become my go-to IPA. So good, but not too strong or hoppy so that you can drink several and be fine, even want more. Cheers!"
"M/D: Light-medium bodied, maybe a touch heavy on the carbonation. Probably about average drinkability, not enough balance."
"Drinkability: One can easily polish off 3 or 4 at a sitting. A decent beer, but I wouldn't go looking out for it in the future."
"Kashmir is an extremely rewarding and sensible ale that steers clearly toward well balanced and bolder English ales than the more common American examples. Highland's flagship IPA will be well received in the Central Kentucky market!"
"This one to me is a lighter IPA that doesn't qualify as the best or even close, but good for certain reasons. Appearance is light golden with a medium sized head and steady carbonation. Nice lacing down the glass as well. Smell is faint of hops, more on the floral side with a little citrus. I enjoy the taste of this beer. Crisp, fresh hops and a tiny malt backbone. More on the hop side but they aren't overpowering or intense by any means. Soft and delicate with a light biscuit essence underneath. Mouthfeel is a little light but quite refreshing and the carbonation is damn near perfect. Less bitterness than your typical. Drinkability is great and this one goes down as an excellent session IPA. Lower ABV and pretty good stats in other areas. Affordable, tasty, and quite drinkable. I consider this a ""safe"" IPA if you have somebody who has yet to delve into that type of beer. It's much less aggressive and bold than the usual but still very lovely."
"D. This one has been growing on me. I was put off by the sweetness at first but this is an interesting brew not outstanding but interesting."
"Thanks for sending this my way mikesgroove. (B'day 07)"
"Dark gold color. Almost no head and a little bit of sticky lacing. Smell is faintly citrus and maybe some banana and peach and floral hops odors. Taste is very mild for an IPA up front, some cirtrus hops but mostly caramel malts and some buttery notes. This one finishes with an unpleasant blast of bitterness, faintly piney but mostly just bitter. I wish the hops had more of a presence up front and that it had more of the desirable bitter citrus or pine to it but it just finishes harsh. This one is really hard to get a handle on, my first impression was to lightly hopped to be an IPA and really more of a pale ale (and actually a nice one on first impression) but.... then the finish hits you with the blast. I'll finish the one I'm drinking but this one has a long way to go to compete with the big boys."
"Overall, a great IPA. Has many of the characteristics I look for in an IPA. Recommended."
"Taste was quite unexpected and hard to nail down. A bit too fruity and sweet for an IPA, with hops left to the backburners. And by backburner I mean aftertaste, to which the hops were a'plenty. Smooth feel across the tongue and a good level of carbonation. I can't say that I'd buy this ever in stores, but it was an interesting try."
"Pours a crisp pale orange with a thin head that was slightly diminishing. The aroma was of mild hops with a slight malt backbone. The taste was of both citrus and pine hops balanced nicely with pale malts. This beer is light on the palate and the hop blend is nice and refreshing to any hophead without being aggressive at all. For an IPA that is only 5.6%, this one is very enjoyable."
"Poured a hazy light golden color with suspended particles. Bright-white head fades quickly but leaves behind a ring and a few swirls. Hardly any rising bubbles. Very low nose on this. Most of the smells I'm picking up are malty and like caramel. First taste is sweeter caramel malts and a faint grassy hop flavor way in the back. Light bitterness and kinda mild for an IPA. Tastes almost like an amber or a standard micro pale ale. Medium bodied and low bubbly mouthfeel. Easy to drink and would be alright to drink a bunch of in an evening without getting yourself into trouble."
"Rich, bronze in color with a nice, foam head and good retention. The smell is of hops, though more mellow than a typical IPA. The taste is hoppy as one would expect, but again quite mellow, very smooth in the finish with just a small bit of bitterness. Slightly creamy in the mouth, very easy going down. Incredibly drinkable and would make a fantastic session ale because the bitterness is toned down and it's an incredibly smooth concoction. Nothing will jump out and ""wow"" you, but you could easily find yourself drinking many of these in a sitting."
"All in all a good beer, especially for one made in the old South."
"D- It is a easy drinking IPA. Pretty simple all the way round. No strong flavors (helps for easy drinking). Nothing special but not bad."
"D: This isn’t a very flavorful beer, nor does it go down too easy. It’s not very filling, which is about the only compliment I can give to it. I’m quite surprised, since I liked Highland’s Gaelic Ale so much, that didn’t like this beer at all."
"D - after enjoying a half glass I dove into dinner. It went great with really spicy mexican and was not a heavy hitting brew. Easy to enjoy a couple of dinner and feel good."
"Mellow and not in your face, but flavorful and aromatic."
"This is an excellent session IPA if I ever had one. More characteristics of an IPA brewed across the pond, so to speak, than right here in NC. I won't be overlooking this one anymore."
"Decent level of carbonation and medium-bodied. Very refreshing and somewhat crisp. A bit creamy and highly drinkable. Thanks again to northerntimber for this one."
"Single bottle from WF Raleigh. No dating on the label or bottle, Highland needs to get on that."
"Round, even taste with broad hop flavors and healthy ripples of bitter aftertaste. Carbonation is slightly overdone but not too bad and balance could use some tweaking but for the style, this is flavorful and refreshing.. Mouthfeel is stiff enough to hold up the hops. I wouldn't go far out of my way for this one but it's a solid enough effort."
"Alright, let me begin by saying, I believe that this has been lightstruck or been otherwise made defective. I didn't smell or taste bad. However, it really had no smell and very, very little flavour. It poured a medium yellow with a big beautiful fluffy snow white cap that stayed for ages. It looked wonderful. However, there was no smell. Nothing, like smelling a glass of water. The taste, too was almost non-existant. Just a tiny bit of bitterness at the end. As I looked at it, there were 1000's of tiny particles suspended and floating about in the beer. I thought at first they must be bubbles, but upon further inspection, they were clearly matter of some sort. I'll let tonight's review of this stand, but I would like to review this again in the future with a fresher example. Everything else was fantastic, especially the appearance."
"Overall very drinkable. While not the best I've had in this style, certainly a worthy beer and worth trying."
"Medium bodied with a mild hoppy tingly texture."
"Overall, not a great example of the IPA style. I might try this again just to give it a second chance, but it did not impress me on the first go around."
"Cloudy bronze toped with a short dense head of fine off-white bubbles that slowly settles leaving no lacing. There is a steady, pulsating wall of carbonation. Fruity, Sweet Tart nose with orange blossom and rind coming through. Starts with a modest hop bite, orange rind with perhaps a bit of sugar that builds. Solid malt body throughout, but the finish is short and to the point and filled with more of those rind notes that do not linger. There is perhaps a touch of pine and grapefruit, but the hop profile is not overly aggressive, and seems to be missing its snap. Medium body, with minimal carbonation that is extremely fine, soft and smooth, and just a touch on the thin side. The label reads A bold beer best consumed with a stiff upper lip. Your lip doesnt have to be too stiff, as this one lacked significant punch."
"A nice beer from Highland. I generally enjoy their beers. In my opinion, the Gaelic Ale has more of an IPA feel to it than this Kashmir. Both are quite enjoyable so I'll let you decide."
"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. It pours a medium orange color with half a finger of head that dies off quickly. There is minimal lacing on the glass. The smell is fruity, with a good amount of citrusy hops. Lots of pineapple in there, with orange, and even some floral notes. The taste has lots of hop bitterness going on. It's juicy hop flavor at first, but gets a little bit on the harsh bitterness side on the finish. I seem to be detecting a bit of diacetyl in there as well. The mouthfeel is decently thick and heavy. The drinkability is just ok, due to the harshness and diacetyl. It's ok."
"12 oz bottle, 6 oz pour. Beer is a light orange color with a light head that sits as a floating island over the brew. Clarity is moderate and only a small stream of bubbles is apparent. Nose is moderately caramel, lightly bready, and a little earthy. No real bright citrusy hop is hitting me, which I would like to find in my IPA. Flavor is representative of the nose. Caramel, earthy hoppy flavors, light breadyness. It finishes with a mild citrusy hop flavor and a moderate peppery bitterness that hangs on nicely after swallowing the brew. Not bad. Feel is moderate with a moderte carbonation that breaks things up nicely, keeping it from being too heavy. Overall, this brew is not giving me what I want from my IPA's, but its not bad. I'd like to see what this one is like fresh and on draft. I have a feeling that there is more brilliance to be found in this one. I'd like to have it again."
"Pours a nice golden color with a bout a fingers worth of off-white head. Leaves decent lacing. The aroma is spicy. Orange and cedar hop scent. Flavor is surprising. Malt comes through more than expected. Spicy bite from the hops with a bitter finish. Enjoying the sweet malt and zesty citrus combo. Mouthfeel is very good...medium body that's a tad slick from the hop oils and good carbonation. I could see my self having a few of these on a lazy afternoon."
"Light and drinkable, but I did not find this one enjoyable. There are too many other IPA's out there for a similar price for me to be sampling this one again anytime soon. I was disappointed, because I have thoroughly enjoyed every other Highland brew I've sampled. Back to the drawing board on this one boys."
"An India Pale Ale for senior citizen bingo night. Seriously, this is one weak ass IPA. The flavor consists of an earthy, herbal and grassy hop profile with a slight note of citrus and a boring, bready, grainy malt backbone. Thin Mouthfeel. Forgettable."
"Drinkability  Im not the biggest fan of IPAs but I found this one to be good. It is my least favorite of all the Highlands beers (which I dearly love) but that is due to style and not quality."
"Bottle. Pours a golden yellow with a billowy white head. Has a wheaty nose and not much florality. Interesting mix of fruit and hops on the palate. A very light IPA with an interesting taste. Not a hopheads dream, but enjoyable (I think?). Thanks Derrick for the bottle."
"Clear golden color with a large sticky white head. Awsome head retention. The aroma is sweet and hoppy. I can definately detect the spicy English hops and at the same time the Mt. Hood's pull through with their pine aroma. The flavor is about the same. A well balanced hoppy brew. The hops are a tasty mix of English raw leafiness and Mt. Hood sharpness. A sweet malt and light toasted grain balance out the hops. The drinkability is dangerous. Pint after pint can be consumed if you don't have anything to do the next day. I think my taste have matured since the last time I tried this beer. I love it!"
"Very, very drinkable and highly recommended to anyone who can get their hands on this. As much as I was recently disappointed by the ""Über Pils"" from Clipper City (another excellent regional brewer) if it had tasted like this I would have been overjoyed. This is not your typical pine-n-citrus American IPA but it is an excellent showcase for bold hop flavoring. Also *again* proof that a big, flavorful beer doesn't have to be high in alchohol; this one's only 5.6% but you'd never know it from the taste."
"This beer poured differently than i expected. It was a very light yellow color, only slightly darker than a macro brew beer. The head was very thin white color, and had a slight lacing around the glass. It had a mild hopy smell, much less strong than my normal perception of an IPA. It was mild for an IPA overall, and lad a nice hopy finishes with a bitter after taste. I am not normally a huge fan of an IPA, but this reminded me of a pale ale more than an IPA, and that is probably why I enjoyed this so much....It really makes me want to try their pale. If you are not a huge fan of IPA's this might be the first step to enjoying them....if you like sierra nevada, or highly hoped pale ales give this a try."
"Easy to drink, easy to like, hard to love. It's got no real selling points against many other, better IPAs. I much prefer Highland's Gaelic Ale over this."
"I was surprised to learn that, until the drinkability score of this beer, I had given nothing but 4.0s to the three Highland Brewing Company beers that I've been fortunate enough to drink. The accolades have been well deserved. Kashmir IPA is a keeper. Thanks to WOLFGANG for sending it my way."
"This is a fairly good beer from Highland. It poured out into a Highland pint glass with a minimal head. It is a amber color with a large amount of floaters. It has a hoppy bitter smell. It tastes like it smells, hoppy and bitter. It has somewhat of a bite but not enough to distract from the overall impression too much. The mouthfeel is slightly affected but overall a decent brew. I could drink these again."
"If your not crazy about hoppy beers this would be great IPA for you. If you are a hophead there is better options out there."
"Last swigs: Well balanced orange and lolipop malts. Well built enjoyable IPA. Not a balls-out no holds barred IPA. Went well with pizza."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" white head above the dark straw brew. Head is foamy and lasting, with average to good lacing. Aroma is lightly of pale malts, with some hops input, but not as much as I would hope for. Taste starts with some pale malts as well, which are quickly overpowered by hops bitterness. The hops character in the flavor is somewhat generic, but tending towards pine, and not so much the fruity. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, making the bitterness more palatable, and as such, drinkability is good as well. Reasonably standard American IPA, for better or worse."
"Not an uber bitter IPA but packed with hop flavor and bitterness. Easy to drink and good to relax yourself right before bed."
"A great example where the first taste to last taste have exactly the opposite effect. At first I said, wow, this tastes great, what kind of style is this malty brew? After a few more sips and relaization this is an IPA, things really changed. Chewy mouthfeel with no real hoppiness for the style. Okay appearance of a thick head and nice carbonation. One of my least favorite IPAs."
"12 ounce bottle, no freshness dating."
"Drinkability is above average, as I could easily enjoy many pints of this brew....my first beer from Highland and I like it. Really glad I got the chance to try this one."
"The flavor is well balanced between the hops and malts. Hops present themself as slightly floral with some fleeting resin flavors. A good malt sweetness as well. Nice and light and tasty. Mouthfeel is okay, a bit thin. Drinkability is good though due to the lighter flavor profile and the good balance."
"This is a quite confusing beer. An IPA? really? It pours a pale straw yellow color with a pearl white head that leaves spidery lacing down the glass. The smell is pure pilsner, a spicy saaz hops smell with a bready malt background. From the looks and smell it could only be a pilsner. The taste is somewhat like a pilsner...starts with a bread-like biscuity malt and leads into a hoppy, spicy and slightly bitter taste and finishes dry, bitter and crisp. I can hardly believe this is an ale, much less an IPA. It's hoppy but this is definately a pilsner style beer. If it were labeled a ""pilsner"" or even a ""lager"" i would consider this a quality brew, even great but this appears to be the victim of sever mislabeling. Not bad by any stretch but most definaetly not an IPA, so be forwarned...a nice, complex hoppy brew but not really an IPA."
"This is a well-balanced beer that just doesn't live up to its ultra-dry-hopped West Coast bretheren."
"They've been around since 1994 and must be doing something right."
"Bright gold color with a nice white fluffy head with lacing down the glass. Herbal hoppy aroma, flavor dominated by hops with some malt to balance. Hops roll on the tongue during the aftertaste. Nicely done AIPA. Not massively flavored but a good straight forward hop accented ale."
"A very respectable IPA. I will continue to stick with Sweetwater for everyday drinking, but I would not hesitate to pick this one up again."
" While not particularly in keeping with stylistic guidelines, this is still a fine beer."
"Slightly hazy golden wheat colored beer full of carbonation. Small bright white head leaves rings of lace. Citrusy grapefruit hop aroma is a bit musty. The flavor is not very IPAish. Some mild, chewy, citrus hops up front balanced by some pale malt that is kind of grainy. Finish is barely bitter. Body is on the light side, with a slightly stick mouthfeel. Not quite bad is about all I can say."
"Pours a very pale golden color with a weak head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are a mix of earthy and resinous hops that almost give off a vegetal note to it. Flavors are an intermingling of citrus and spicy hop flavors. There is a slight backing of malts that give off a slight caramel flavor but for the most part they do not make themselves present. The finish is slightly bitter but follows along the citric hop flavor. Overall this is a fairly simple IPA but a quenching one at that."
"Pours a very pale, straw yellow with a fluffy white head that laces extensively. Smells of floral hops and grass, herbal notes, and a distinguished hop aroma. Taste is an explosion of grassy florals, with a mild malt backbone. Rather thin bodied with a slick coating of resinous hops on the tongue. Finishes dry with a lingering hop aftertaste. By far, the best IPA I have had from NC. Thanks Mike of Brawley's Beverage (Charlotte, NC)for reccomending this brew!"
"This was extremely pale for the style. In fact, visually, it could pass for a pilsner. Its got a grassy, floral and peachy hop aroma is that downright delicious. When you get in the flavor the hops turn almost salty. The body is too thin, but if they turned up this beer to a bigger body and just amped up the hops a bit, this would be an awesome IPA."
"Pours a crystalline clear gold with a small wite head. Smells weakly citrusy and a wee bit grassy. Slight yeast twinge too. Tastes nicley sweet and grassy. A scant amount of resinous pop. Really just a slightly over sweet IPA. Mouthfeel and drinkablility are ok. This beer doesn't do a lot to seperate itself from the ""just another IPA"" herd."
"Pours a very pale cloudy copper under a 1/2 finger off-white head that settles quickly leaving just a trace of lace. A good crisp flowery hops nose greets the senses, with a touch of citrus in the background. Yup, and pine, too. Very prickly, somewhat sticky mouth. In the opening, smooth, sweet malt blends well with a lot of flowery, piney hops. A slight espresso bitter emerges in the finish, while a dry bite charachterizes the aftertaste. By no means over the top, this is a good drinkable brew."
"Good, easy-drinking IPA, maybe a good starter for someone not quite ready for the over-the-toppers. Thank you hustlemuscle for the sample."
"Drinkability: A nicely balanced IPA to please both the hopheads as well as those who want some sweetness to counter the bitterness"
"The beer after serving its sentence in the 12 ounce brown bottle set in the glass an obfuscated golden yellow, the head behemothic in size, creamy in texture and bright white in color, the lace forms a concealing sheet upon the glass. The aroma of hops, sweet malt and a lime like crispness greet the nose with the start sweet and rich in malt, top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is nicely acidic; the hops bountiful and spicy, quite dry and somewhat sweet aftertaste lingers long on the palate, nice moderate IPA, nice on a hot Arizona day."
"The beer when poured looked remarkably clear, and pale, perhaps a bit too pale for the style. The head was about an inch thick, and creamy, and hung around for a bit, leaving good lacing as the beer went down. Carbonation was medium to low. The aroma was subdued for the style, with very little aggressive hop character in the nose. The taste was bright, with typical citric-piney American hop profile with sweetish caramel malt giving a chewy toffee taste. The hops were a bit peppery in the mid palate. The aftertaste was chalky-dry with a creamy mouthfeel. A good, middle of the road IPA which is a recent arrival in the Jax in Cumming. Looking forward to tasting the other beers from this regional brewery."
"Light golden color with slight amber tint, nice white head with a little lacing but it looks like it tastes to light. Smells of malt and light floral hops not as aroma intense as a IPA should be.Tastes of carmel malt light hop flavor and bitterness. Dry and sweet with good mouthfeel just seems to be missing the extra flavor and hop kick I was looking for. Love this brewery's amber and porter so was expecting something more from the Kashmir."
"Pouring produces a bright white head, but the light colour of the beer was a bit surprising. The aroma contains a mixture of malty sweetness and fresh (green) hoppiness. Caramel malt predominates at first with little hop flavour coming through, but this leads to a light bitterness that lingers on the palate. The malt character of the beer is a little too strong for the style, but it's still a well-crafted pale ale with more flavour and body than expected in such a light coloured beer."
"Easy to drink, would be a nice brew on a hot day."
"light orange/gold with a frothy head of white. Aromas are all herbal/grassy hops, and sweet (caramel) malts. The taste is a bit sweet and malty for an IPA, but the middle is nice and bready, and the finish is herbal/hoppy. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and average. Drinkability is decent...this is another interesting IPA from NC."
"All and all a great beer and an incredible example of the style in my opinion."
"Good brew, but no malt to be found anywhere."
"This isn;t half bad. I'm not big into the hop thing, but this one is still a good one for me. It's suprisingly refreshing all over. I really liked the change in taste that it did. First it was a smooth, clean, kind of hoppy taste. Then it bursts out into a hop/peppery rush. I guess that is what I liked about it, the multi-leveled tastes. If I can like it, then I am sure that a hophead would love it. It's got a creamy feel to it, so it's real smooth and covers the palate. All in all a good little brew, much better than I expected."
"Hops: Stryian Goldings, Mt. Hood, Fuggles, Magnum, Willamette"
"Thanks AKSmokedPorter for the ""Zeppelinesque"" IPA."
"Their Kashmir IPA is similar to their American pale ale but with a lighter color; a more floral than citrusy hop character to the nose; a bit more hop flavor (also more varied); and with about twice the bitterness (although it doesn't seem quite so once it warms a bit). Its slightly hazy (bottle-conditioned) golden body is capped by a thin head of creamy bright-white foam that holds well, maintains a solid surface covering, and leaves some spotty lace about the glass. The nose is bright and fresh with floral & grassy hops over a sweetish, bready malt. The body is medium with a very fine and gently crisp carbonation that's lightly crisp across the palate. The flavor offers a solid one-two punch of floral and grassy hops over sweet malt that's well backed by bold bitterness. It finishes short and dry with some very short lingering malt and piney hops that fade quickly to just bitterness. It's well done and very drinkable!"
"Overall, a solid, but different IPA."
"The hoppiest of the Highland offerings, this beer is not too shabby. Its balance comes down decidedly in favor of the hops, but who says that's a bad thing? A bit thin on mouthfeel, but a very nice, complex, NOVEL if nothing else, blend of hop flavors."
"This is probably the best brewery in Nc at least of all the beers I have had down here.Had the aroma of a traditional IPA hoppy,grassy,and this one a little apple essence.Poured nice gold/copper color with nice rocky head that stayed awhile.Taste was of course very hoppy and fruity but pretty well balanced.When in Asheville will get this when at Barleys I wanna try on tap."
