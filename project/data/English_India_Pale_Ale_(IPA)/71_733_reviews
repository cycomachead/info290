"Just got this and West Coast from Green Flash to compare, and all in all, this is a ""light"" version of West Coast, still great in scent and flavor but not as powerfull. Still worth it though"

"Smooth IPA that according to me is a bit thin. A little more hops would have balanced the beer better."
"I love this beer, heck I love anything Fuller's"

"Feel is good too, beer is light in the alcohol and has the proper body and carbonation. I prefer heavier beers but at least I admire the balance in this one."

"Overall... a nice ale, bitterness is present in a good combination with a nice roast malt presence, refreshing beer too."

"500ml bottle. Fuller´s Pint glass. Enjoyed on apr´13. Pours light copper in color with crystal clear appearance. White froth, close & lasting crown. Mild toasted malt aromas, subtle resins, earthy & mint hues to the nose. Evident hop tendency overwhelm toffee maltiness. Medium body. Moderate to soft carbonation. Herbal notes & earthy bitterness in the middle provide sharp astringency that lingers into a no-sugar tea-like finish. Note:Label indicates 5.3% (Bar Code 5-011885-010478)"

"Overall: A great addition to the IPA scene by the English brewing giants. Probably not a candidate for the finest IPA out there, but it deserves praise for the balance of malt and bitterness that so many breweries fail to achieve."

"The brown color with an orange twist has a spark of flavor right from the start. The smell was refreshing and happily hoppy. I had a nice mouthful of the brew to refresh my lack of a quality IPA given my location, and it is cheaper to buy here (Panama) than it is back home in Her Majesty's kingdom."

"Poured from a 500ml bottle. Pours a orangey-brown colour. There's plenty of malt in the aroma, but not much hops. Anyone accustomed to drinking a West Coast style IPA may find this a bit tame aroma-wise. However, the taste offers a some nice cereal/grain flavours and there is in fact quite a persistent hop bitterness to the finish. Just not much aromatics."

"O - a fine example of the english style, it is unique in its fresh taste and feel without taking away from the hoppiness, a must try"
""

"Had this on the International Day of Beer with Indian Food, and it paired great."
""
""
"Expectations come high from me for this brewer, and, after a few minor hiccups, this turns out a-ok - no pandering to West Coast US influences, just a nice cracking English pale ale, with a smidgen more hops and equally iterative booze factor, all to indicate with closest probability what those Bengal-bound ships were actually laden with lo those many years ago."

"If most American IPAs are like Jimi Hendrix playing the Star Spangled Banner, Fuller's India Pale Ale is like somebody's grandmother sitting down to crumpets and tea to watch Coronation Street. No one can say this is a bad beer - I don't think such a thing can be said about any Fullers product - but it's definitely unexciting. Too status quo for my tastes."
"O- Easy and highly drinkable beer. Perfect balance between sweet and bitter notes. Nothing really impressive, just a nicely crafted ale"
""
""
""
"Nicely done but not terribly exciting. For the price here in Mexico I wouldn't have it again, but a nice alternative to American pale ales which are typically the happiest beer you can find."
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a nice golden amber color ale with a large foamy head with great retention and some good lacing. Aroma consists of dry floral hops with light pungy notes. Taste is a nice drinkable mix between some dry floral notes with light pungy notes and solid dry caramel malt notes with some good cereal notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Solid mix of English hops and nice grain bill."

"Overall a nice clean sessionable uk style ipa. Doesn't get overly biter or herbal estery hedgerow hops, instead a nice bitter earthy grassy light spicy hop. they also stay away from the american big hops. Nice malts, juicy, and almost lager level clean and crisp. Really nice beer overall, just served a bit too cold but that's BBC not the beer."
""

"Pours a dark golden colour with hints of amber. Head is off-white and yields decent lacing down the glass. Hop forward aroma underpinned with caramelized malt sweetness. Very well balanced flavour profile with a pleasantly bitter finish."
""
"D: A damn good English IPA with balance and drinkability that sets it above the competition. Flavourful and nuanced, to boot. Well worth seeking out."
""
"Overall- Alright beer to drink. Slightly above average. Love the smell. A tad more bitter than other English IPAs I've drank such as Twisted Thistle and Old Empire. But not overly bitter in any way. Would be getting one again but not so soon."
"Carbonation is a little full-on."
"Bitterness, aromas, flavours of hop.. I like the way English mix this ingredient in a very suitable way!!"
"Beautiful bottle with best before date on label served into a pint glass. Nice brown copper hue with a head that dissipates but never quite leaves you. Perfume and herbs hit the nose; a herbal, hop, buttery taste with a nice finish. Very good beer, quite refreshing and with a lot of flavor."
"Picked this up at Ammersino Feine Getränke in Vienna. Clear copper-orange pour with two finger off white head and great lacing. Big floral, perfumy nose with a bready, caramel sweetness. Toast, tea, toffee, and a solid bready, biscuity, sweet malt backbone in the taste. Hints of butterscotch and caramel, and the bitter hops really kick in nicely as it warms for a really well balanced English IPA. Extremely smooth and slightly chewy with a nice bitter, dry finish. For me, this is the definition of a perfect session beer. Full flavored but not extreme. Had no idea this was a seasonal brew. I'm kicking myself for only getting one of these. Fuller's was already one of my favorite breweries, but this beer totally surpassed expectations. Have to get more!"
"A well done and well balanced British IPA."
"Very complex and highly refreshing."
"I can't help but wonder how great this is fresh when it doesn't travel across the pond. The best English ipa I can think of. It definitely is deserving of its reputation. Might not be for one dimensional hopheads though. Forewarned."
"D: Decent drinkability, though I'd like to see this a bit smoother."
"D - Nice and drinkable with a balance favoring bitterness and musty English hops. Enough malt richness is present to balance the hop character and the fruity yeast helps to lend depth. This is a classic of British beer and while it is always excellent, it really does manage to acquire some extra depth as a real ale."
"Certainly a sessionable IPA... but I still don't really get these low abv British versions?"
"Balanced and sessionable. This is everything an English cask should be."
"Cask at Volo Cask Days 2009. A perfect English IPA. Nice hoppy aroma. Golden with stand-on-guard white head. Great balance, with understated Goldings hops that keep up a bitterness, some lemony citrus. Creamy mouthfeel, a good malting. Easy drinking."
"Overall - Like Discovery, this is another pale Fuller's beer that doesn't particularly appeal to me."
"D - A very nice, sessionable beer."
"This beer pours a pale amber hue which is very lively carbonated and leads to a nice two finger bubbly head,it has beautiful fruity hop aromas with a pleasant maltiness in the background,it has a nice mouthfeel with nice tastes of fruity hops and malted barley is present aswell to make it very smooth indeed with a decent but pleasant bitter aftertaste which is so easy to drink that i will buy this again."
"Good, but a little step below the regular range. White Shield is a better English IPA."
"Drinkability: Very resonant in taste and smell, even though some of the characteristics switched priorities in the hegemony of sensational order. Milder than I expected it to be, guess I've had me one too many of the Yankee versions... Nonetheless, this is an IPA not to be ignored, it's interesting and has a prominently hoppy tone, winning not by measures of strength but of perseverance."
"Too thin to be an English IPA but not punchy enough to be an American IPA. Still easy-drinking, though."
"D: There are better IPA:s around, but this one I had with veal, something I highly recomend."
"In many ways, this beer should be served at room temp (65F) and in a large pint glass surrounded at a wooden pub, raining outside and red velvet seats inside. A kidney pie with mash would complement this brew. Hopefully it would not stop raining for hours as you enjoyed the company and several Fuller beers."
"D: A refreshing English IPA - very easy to drink. But considering that it's an IPA, it's aromas and flavors are slightly too restrained, I think. The hop character could have been more pronounced, although English IPA:s usually don't pack as much hops as the American ones do. Also, I think the diacetyl level is slightly too high in this one. But still, a good beer."
"I could have complained about the low bitterness or the rather low body in this IPA... But on the other side, this is a damn well crafted beer with a great drinkability."
"Poured a dark copper with just a little head which quickly faded. Smelled sweet and a bit hoppy, and tasted the same, maybe even a bit sweeter than the nose. Lightly carbonated made it real easy to drink. Like all of the Fuller products, a very good beer, recommended, especially if you find it on tap"
"It was a pale brown ale in a pint glass that made it to the table with no head or lacing to be seen. The aroma was of hops and spice. As i drank this ale, i was shocked to find a bit of a sweet taste, almost a sugar fore and aftertaste, with a bite of hops mixed with spices. Carbonation was perfect to fit the taste of a beer. Not a taste i expected from an ipa, and it was good. I was pleasantly surprised and would definetly have this one again."
"M&D: softly textured and tasty as a fresh cask-conditioned pale ale, benefiting from rich hop characters, a nice structure, and a superb, slightly tannic aftertaste. Its a truly decent and more-ish little IPA~~"
"Was pleasantly surprised."
"Overall - An excellent example of an IPA and yet another fine brew from Fuller's.... Very drinkable... recommended..."
"Wonder why this beer rates as low as it does. I think it's one of the better English IPA's out there. It's malty, caramelly, and moderately rich and well melded--much like the London Pride, only with nice hop additions. Hops adds a nutty, grassy, woodsy, bitter characteristics. Still well devised and well rounded. Very balanced finish. Smooth, creamy, and full to the palate. Not as drying as I would have thought. Could easily become a session beer for me."
"Slightly dry, very drinkable. Definitely worth a try."
"Im giving it higher marks based on the agebility of this sample."
"On tap at McCouls here in Greensboro,pours a deep golden with a nice one finger head that left a good amount of lace behind.Very well balanced aroma some English herbal hop but with a firm dry biscuity note in there,a real easy qqaffer here malty and fruity up front with some nice herbal,minty flavors in the finish.Smooth and easy to drink I think a real sociable pint with some nice flavors going on,another great one from Fullers."
"Pours a very clear, golden colorleaning toward amber/copper. The head isnt very impressive, a shallow white foam that falls fast into wispy nothingness. Smell is quite nicesolidly malty with a musty, floral, decidedly English smell. Its not a typical IPA. Very doughy and malty, but also notably bitter. I really like the sweetness and the full, round malt character. Its a welcome change from the American style IPAs. Full and somewhat soft mouthfeel. This brew is amazingly drinkableits a solid treat. Very appealing."
"Lets just say fresher is better with this brew."
"Pours with an off-white head about half an inch deep and a few lines of carbonation. Beer's color is a uniformly very dirty copper, yet almost transparent; not much of a change in the highlights either. Smell is initially very sweet and caramelly or suggestive of sugar-frosted barley hulls. A somewhat soft, earthy/weedy hop element is also present, but very subtle. I'm sure this is well within the expectations of an English rendition of the style, but my Americanized sense of smell just demands more aggression in the hop department. Nosefeel is refreshing but thin and indistinct. Thankfully, there's a bitterness in the taste that emerges in mid-swig to offset a deep, earthy sweetness. This is actually quite nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is wet and medium in body, consistent from sip to swallow, and with a perfectly timed aftertaste. Once you've had your taste buds ripped out by an American Double IPA, this will seem very tame, but this gets outstanding marks in drinkability for just that reason. A fine session beer."
"Not as exceptional as I was expecting this to be. For a beer bar, Lazy Boy's should know better than to serve this beer just above the freezing point."
"Happy to find this one on cask at the Lazy Boy in White plains NY a ways back (and happy I took notes). Poured light straw, with a fine white head, left alot of creamy lacing. Smootha mellow IPA. Very soft on the palate. British all the way. Velvety malt , soft hops. Balanced and very enjoyable. Perfect session brew."
"12 oz brown bottle, sampled 4 months before ""best by"" date. Pours a light bronze with a small offwhite white that left behind a small amount of patchy lace. Subdued nose of faint toffee and some herbal hops. Light to medium carbonation in the mouthfeel, with a mild hop twang. Taste is a bit of sweet caramel malt and some earthy, woodsy hops and yeast bitterness. Carbonation seems to dominate the palate. Finishes clean and dry. Very disappointed in the lack of character, but is nicely drinkable and would be a good session ale if it had a bit more flavor."
"Still, not bad. Maybe it would've been better if I'd had it 6 months ago, but there was nothing about it that makes me want to get a fresh bottle to find out."
"The beer pours a dark gold color with a thin white head. The aroma is decent. It's malty with mild hop aroma. The taste is good. It has a malty flavor with a bitter dry finish. The hops are not that pronounced, but the mild flavor is good and balances well. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low bodied beer with medium carbonation. This is a decent IPA, but it's done in a fake English style. There is hardly any hops and it's dry. I do like the maltiness, but the noble hops are just too mild."
"12 ounce bottle. Best before date of 07/JUNE/04."
"Still, this beer is an IPA in the time-tested English style and is wickedly sessionable. If you are going for a Fuller's, pass this one by and go to one of their finer brews - especially the 1845 and the Vintage Ale."
"This is as far from Ruination as one can get, but if one desires to witness a modern template of the style, look no further."
"So that's what an Old World IPA is like. After taking in a number of West Coast super-IPA's, this one really caught me off guard. Initially, I didn't care for it at first but as I spent more time with it I grew to appreciate it and stopped comparing it to the American IPA's. Worth a try to experience what British soldiers serving in the far reachs of the Empire had back in the day."
"This is a different IPA than I'm used to, but it's really the first true English IPA that I've tried. The beer came in a 12 ounce bottle with a best served by date on the back label. It pours a gold to amber, clear with an off-white head with pale white lacing that is longer lasting than US IPAs. The aroma is intriguing but I'm unable to put my finger on the aromas other than hops. It has other hints. The taste is of a bull-bodied ale that is more bitter than most pale ales. There is a definite flavor of caramel in amongst the hops and other grains. It feels great in the mouth, being more full-bodied than almost any pale ale I've had and goes down real smooth. I will be adding this to my drinking list, and will be trying other Fuller's."
"This is a good interperatation of the UK IPA style. This is a darker coloured beer with a nice head. The aromas are simple and pull no punches. They consist of malts and hops in nice balance. The taste is the same as the aromas hint...malty with a bit of hops in the mix. The mouthfeel is MOR and the drinkability is great!"
"Pale copper color with a thin white head. Smells faintly of English nobles, mainly Fuggles. Butterscotch diacetyl flavor consistent with an English IPA, with a lingering hop quench. Good malt profile to it, too. I love 2-row! Highly drinkable. A friend told me it sucked, but I bought a case anyways, and I'm glad I did. He likes American IPAs, but isn't an American IPA an oxymoron? I don't remember the US colonizing India... maybe other countries in the vicinity..."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a clear deep copper color with one finger of head. There is a little bit of lacing on this one. The smell is very balanced with sweet malts and a bit of hops. A little floral aroma as well. The taste is very spicy and malty, then ends with a bite of hops. It's not as hoppy as most American IPAs, but then again, this is one of the originals. The mouthfeel is fairly strong and full on the tongue. The drinkability is very nice, and I could sip on this IPA all night."
"The finish and aftertaste of Fuller's are its most unique characteristics. The beer ends with a flash of lots of different flavors. Through many mouthfuls I varyingly detected the following: salt, caramel, cinnamon, chocolate, and maybe a little lemon. All of these flavors were gentle, which probably explains why I had so much trouble deciding what they were. This beer stays on the tongue and the lips long after its run out, but as long as your date likes IPAs, too, that shouldn't be a problem."
"Appearance: Pours a caramel amber tone with a nice thicket of cream colored foamy head nice bands of lacing even and decently full. Aroma: Buttered fuggles here nice English style IPA caramel malts surround the hop profile very nice. Taste: Flavor is the most fulfilling aspect of this beer, so good balanced mix of buttery sweet fuggles and other English nobles. Mouthfeel: Fuller medium body a great carbonation would love the texture on cask I have a feeling but such a solid flavor profile not much beats this one in way of English IPA. Drinkability: If I were traveling in London and came upon this one on a beer engine I believe we would become really close friends, great solid brew by a historic brewer awesome."
"This is one fine IPA. It will not be mistaken for a hoppy American IPA. The flavors are rich and robust. There is just no extreme hop bitterness like the American versions. Enjoy."
"Plenty of malt in the front of this one, as opposed to American IPA's, which are predominantly hoppy. Subdued use of hops and equally balanced. Some slick toffee notes and hints of burnt caramel also. Very nice and also quite unique. The drinkability is ridiculous... a perfect session brew. Recommended if you want an English version of a true IPA. Don't expect a hop overload and you will be pleased."
"This beer pours an amber/ copper color from its very distinctive 18.6 oz bottle. This beer pours with a nice sized tan head. This beer smells of malts and hops. From the first taste the hops are very present but they seemed to be balanced well. This is a British style IPA with a slightly milder taste then most American IPAs. This has a very light mouthfeel and is very drinkable. While this is not my favorite beer it is not that bad. Give it a try."
"Overall: Is this a real IPA I hear people say?. Who gives a fuck!! Its a damn good, high quality beer. A little piece of England in Long Beach tonight, which has left a huge smile on this Limey Ex-Pat. A Jolly Good Show and just Bloody Marvelous!"
"The feel was solid without fullness, and though creamy enough it had a substantial bite and crispness at the finish. This is one really drinkable beer that only lacked a decent head and lacing from the bottle. The body color is beautiful, being dark amber with a substantial red hue to heighten the look."
"nice coppery color with a decent tan head. hops a re present in the smell, with an underlying sweet malty that kind of reminds me of a sweet bakery smell. nice and bitter with good dose of hops. a little citrusy in the middle then sweet and a little spicey and bitter to follow. lingering hop flavor. medium mouthfeel, nothing to complain about. a good IPA."
"Medium gold color, large head. Slightly malty aroma. A mildly malty and not very hoppy IPA. This is a British style IPA so the hops are very subdued. Tastes are mild. There is a little bit of a floral flavor in the taste. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Frothy head disipated quickly atop a brilliantly clear brownish amber brew. Aroma is of carmelly malt balanced by a distinct english hop aroma and a slight oakiness. Taste is more like an ESB than an IPA but it has a flavor of a little caramel with a lot of english hop character and a little saltiness due to water character. Finishes with an average hop bitterness that makes it different from the clean finish of a good ESB. Mouthfeel is good as this beer is light on the tongue and not very thick when it goes down. I would drink this beer again if it was the best offering at a bar that i might find myself but i would not seek this one out on it's own."
"This beer pours a clear deep caramel with a fluffy white head of large bubbles atop. Nice sticky lacing on the glass and a thin clumpy head remains after a few minutes. Nose is sweet caramel and full with a bready aroma in the backend. The first sip is sweet with toasted toffee, caramel and citrus with hops in the finish and lingering on the palate. Mouthfeel is very light, almost too light. The overall feel here is balance, with no one aspect of taste or smell dominating another. A good beer and a decent IPA, there is something to be said about a beer that can make a statement with subtlety in a style where boldness is usually the theme."
"Unusual. Why is it that the ESB is more bitter and stronger in regards to ABV (and taste) than the IPA? Although this is a real nice beer, it's quite tame for the style. I don't know what makes this an IPA. Tastes different than the ESB (or London Pride), and as an ale would be a damn good one. Doesn't stand out enough to merit a return visit, however, considering the many options in this category. Nice pour, nice smell, nice taste. No real negatives to report, but I wish it had more kick and bite to it."
"This beer poured an off-white medium head with medium sized bubbles. The hue of this beer was amber and there was good lacing on the sides of my glass. The nose was that of fruit juice. This beer definitely has an aftertaste to it and this is definitely a beer that I won't be seeking out any time soon."
"This brew has a mild fruity aroma. When poured, it yielded a medium head of off white medium to large bubbles that left a good lacing as it receded. Its body was a medium amber color. It has a mild initial taste with a slight after taste. Some carbonation was evident in the taste. This brew was much smoother than I expected. It is a decent brew, but give me their Porter!"
"1pt, 2.6oz majestic bottle pours a burnt orange with a small white head that falls quickly. Smokey, malty aroma and very toasty. Medium bodied and carbonated. Taste is fruity malts and toast, with hops presenting themselves in the finish along with a hint of alcohol. A little thin in the finish, kind of trails off quickly. This is a very bready, toasty ale. Very good for what it is, but I prefer more hops and less toast in my IPA."
"Watery mouthfeel persisted through out; in other words, the dry finish didnt pucker out my mouth. Wish more IPA's would do that. Much better of a session ale than almost any other IPA, though it did not have the immense flavors of American ones."
"Thank goodness for second bottles. The first Fuller's I poured was skunked, but I didn't know it really because I'd never had it. Well, something rated this good could not be this bad, so I opened the second bottle. Much better! It pours a deep copper with a lovely tan head. Beautiful to behold (my first bottle had cascaded over the pint glass after I had poured only about 4 ounces). Back to the real thing: the smell is nothing remarkable, but the taste--my God, it's like buttered popcorn! I'm not sure I like it, yet. Let me have another go. Yes, this grows on you. This gets better and better. Give it a try."
"Taste began sweet, light malt, then yeast, with a nice hop bitterness to the finish. Very subtle hops compared to many IPA's that are over the top. The finish is very smooth, dry, with a medium body that goes down very easy and is very refreshing."
"This is a well balanced IPA of sweet malt and hops, but I am in love with the American way of IPA. So with this, I needed more hop in the smell and taste, but mind you this is still a good beer to drink, just tamer then most IPA's that I have a strong fondness for now. Color is good, a nice pale golden yellow, small off-white head with some spotty lace. Smells of fresh sweet malt and grain with hop note present, very clean. Taste is mild or ""paled"" if you will, of hops with a perfectly balanced caramel malt making for some smooth drinkin. Feel is solid medium body and slightly dry with a very weakened bitterness. As before, this is a good IPA but to mild and light in the hops for me. I would still drink this any Ol' time, I think I just have to put out of my head that its an IPA, just drink it and be happy."
"A true classic IPA done the English way. Hoppy, but very well balanced with a nice fruity malt profile. The balance is perfection for an IPA. I enjoy the huge hoppy American IPAs more, but it's nice to go back to this. Every IPA lover should try this brew."
"Pours out a nice clear golden color. Very crisp looking. Slight white head, some lacing. This is a good tasting beer. Its got a nice sweet flavor that is bombarded by a nice dose of bitter hops. Similar in idea as some of the other english drinks that i have had. Definately worth giving a shot."
"Bottom Line: This won’t dethrone the ESB in my opinion, but makes a nice change of pace."
"Its been almost a month since my last beer review so I hope my taste buds are not too out of shape. Anyway Fuller's IPA was not at all what I expected, but I the surpirse was not bad at all. The ale poured nice medium to dark yellow with a ton of carbonation bubbles and an overly fluffy white head. The smell was not at all hoppy. Instead it had a clinging buttery nose with characteristics of sugar and sweet fruits such as apple and plum as opposed to citrusy ones. The taste was finely balanced between hops and malts with a little bit of a wheat taste peaking through at times and some notes of caramel and apple. The only complaint I had was the mouthfeel as it was too carbonated for my liking. Overall a perfect session brew."
"Excellent hops spice in this one. The flavor is all there too with a nice medium body behind it. The carbonation is a bit overdone and it burns a little bit. Otherwise the mouthfeel is nice and crisp once the bubbles die down a bit. Pretty refreshing and wonderful with a spicy dish, this is a great drinker especially with a meal. The hop choice is definitely different from American IPAs, and this is a nice change of pace for me. A well done for Fuller's on this one."
"I was holding out to try this because the price is high - $11 a sixer in VA. Normally I expect a high ABV and an over the top taste for that kind of cash but I had try this one.Pours golden and slightly hazy with a nice frothy head. The aroma and taste are nothing special, but good. Smell is not too strong but inviting, with a characteristic english bittersweet hoppiness and nice caramel maltiness. The taste is rather bland at first, but the bitterness kicks in in the aftertaste, leaving a nice zing on the tongue. This is not an IPA for a ""hophead", . Not worth the price at all. Very unremarkable. A good beer, but once again, nothing special."
"This brew poured a deep copper color with a small off-white head that stuck around for some time, good lacing as well. The nose was complex as I was picking up floral hops as well as a carmel smell and a little bit of malt, I may be off a little but it seemed like there was a lot going on with this brew. The taste was very refreshing, a whole bunch of hops basically. The floral hops are the only ones I could pick out, but I know it was more complex than that. The malts are hard to pick out but they are definitely there because this brew is wonderfully balanced. The mouthfeel was medium-full and pretty smooth. Overall I enjoyed this brew and I would definitely drink again."
"Certainly, this ale, unlike many American IPA's, evidences the English style of balance rather than overt hoppiness. But the real interesting thing here is the way in which, even within a great balance, the sweet, malty elements and the hoppy, bitter elements remain distinct, seemingly taking turns asserting themselves. There is an obvious bitterness that runs through this beer, very appropriately showcasing the distinction between and IPA and a pale ale and making for a very quaffable, nicely bitter ale."
"It's kind of a shame. This bottle was past its date. Nonetheless, the nose was clean, and the taste was good. Pours a copper with minimal head and lace. Smell was clean and there seemed to be a scent of candy apple. Taste was similar, but not terribly bitter. Definitely not as bitter as many American IPAs, but tasty nonetheless. Medium bodied. I wonder if this would have been significantly better if it had been fresher. Still, a very quaffable brew."
"This is a nice contrast to big, bold American IPA's. Aroma is of caramel coated apples. Hops profile is undeniably English, a bit floral and earthy. Caramel malt provides nice balance against the hops, but the malt is not as ""chewy"" or complex as some of the domestic IPA's. Not that it's bad, just different. In fact, I'd call this the most refreshing IPA I've ever had. If you've only tried American IPA Pacific Northwest hops monsters, try this one for a change of pace."
"A darker golden amber color...the head is big and fluffy. I love the aroma! It's hoppy and floral, just very enticing. Malts come through at first, and then a pleasant hop character. I really enjoyed the flavor, it's nothing complex, but it's very smooth and reserved."
"First pour shows a brilliant and clear copper brew with a gorgeous creamy lace-like head. It shows as everything you expect in an IPA. Aromas of caramel and honey mix in harmony with the luscious, soft hops. There is a tiny touch of diacetyl that melds well, not overwhelming the hops unlike what you taste with some IPAs. First taste is a soft bittersweetness. The balance of clean, sweet malt with light and clean malt is near-perfect. The hops bitterness slides smoothly into round and almost oily fruits. Perhaps not what the English drinker expects from a traditional IPA - much more like what one tastes in American IPAs but none the less very much to my taste."
"Dark amber-orange with a big, rocky head that stays pretty well. The aroma is heavy on the English hops as expected, but is still a subtle aroma. Very spicy and a bit estery. Malt is sweet and bready. The taste... wow, this is a tasty beer! Very hoppy in that subtle English way, but also very malty. The hops are very spicy, with a very crisp bitterness that makes your tongue tingle. The malt is like buttered bread, with very sweet butter. There's an underlying graininess as well. At the front, hops are dominant, but in the back, malt takes over. Back to hoppy for the finish, crisp and dry. Excellent English IPA. I'll have another, please."
"BRIGHT golden body is topped by a large, fluffy white head that seems to be breathing. Excellent lacing. Very hoppy nose, very floral, very earthy, with fruits more in the background, and a bit of that famous English sulfur. A properly English IPA. The malts come out and introduce themselves first, before the hops come riding over the top. As the sip hits the tongue, there is a malty surge, with just a twinge of hops. However, as the mouthful continues, the hops swell up, and by the aftertaste, they have driven the malt off, and you're left with a nice hop tingle in your mouth. Smooth, but politely assertive, this is a wonderful English IPA"
"Very drinkable indeed..if not too cold."
"Orange/gold in color, with a very thin head, though one which leaves a decent lace down the glass. Aroma is hoppy and citric, though not so much as to completely overshadow a strong biscuity malt character. Diacetyl lends something of a buttery note to both the aroma and the flavor -- easy to miss but hard to ignore once you've noticed it. Not a bad thing at all, as it contributes, I believe, to the smooth character of this beer in the mouth. Flavor is big on caramel malt, with an oily hop presence throughout, leading up to a pleasingly but not overdone bitter finish. Medium-mouth with crisp carbonation really contributes to the overall experience of a very clean, sharp IPA. Very drinkable."
"Light copper in color with a head that quickly diminishes. Aromas are of toasted malt, and fruity, some-what citrusy hops. The flavor starts off with a sweet toasty malt character, but that lingers into a crisp, dry, bitter finish. The bitterness also lingers with you for a bit in the aftertaste. Overall there is a good balance between the malt and hops, with the hop bitterness just outweighing the malt flavors. Not overpoweringly bitter as many American IPAs are."
"pours a clear deep amber color, big white head that clings to the sides of my glass. Strange malty caremel aroma, light mild hop flavor, watery thin mouthfeel, nice english IPA, seems a really light on the hops."
"Nice, sweet, fruity,light, but too, too dissappointing!"
"It's nice looking and has a foamy white head leaving lace all the way to the bottom. However, both the smell and taste are a bit underwhelming for an IPA. Certainly it's in a complete different ballpark from most designated as IPA in the U.S. It's not bad, but it's not one of the best offerings from Fuller's in my opinion."
"The pour is a clear amber color, the head mountainous, the lace thick sheets that cling mightily to the glass, both a light beige color. The nose is malt, slight hints of yeast and quite clean and fresh. Front malt, lightly sweet, top is skimpy, the finish is minimally acidic, basally hopped, the aftertaste droughty. The archetypal ""English IPA, ""NO"" this is not bad, and sometimes its nice to sample an IPA that is not over the top with ""Hops", yes even us ""Hopheads", like a change."
"Reddish gold color with a thin head. Hops very present in the aroma, but not so much in the flavor. As a matter of fact this was much more malty than I was expecting given the tart hoppy aroma. The flavor was uncharacteristically malt imbued. It may have been off the mark for the typical IPA but it was still a good beer. The fact that I scored a case of these for $12 didn't hurt either."
"A very intricate and complex ale where flavors assert them selfs rather aggressively. Instead of the transatlantic cable, we should have done a transatlantic pipeline to get this stuff here in large quantities."
"Well, it isn't your oridnary American style IPA, but it certainly isn't a horrible one. I'm able to see right through this copper colored ale that poured with a decent head. Nice balance on the taste. Not overly hopped up like the American IPA was, yet not disturbingly weird tasting as is common with English-style IPA's. Fuller's is one of the breweries that have yet to give me a bad beer. I'll definately keep this one on my 'must drink again' list."
"Slightly hazy, orange/amber in color, with a creamy white head that settles shortly but leaves a good collar and light surface covering as well as some very good lace. The aroma is mainly of a gently sweet caramel malt and earthy/mineral hops (Fuggles?). The body is medium with a very fine, moderate carbonation. The taste is somewhat fruity, with a lightly sweet caramel & toffee maltiness that's infused with rich hop flavor, and backed by a solid bitterness. The bitterness is bold, but not overwhelming, and at times the hop flavor can become gently minty when combined with the sweetness of the malt. The finish is dry with a lingering malt and hop note. The alcohol is well hidden. Very well balanced. A bold flavorful beer that has alot of finesse. It puts out alot of hops and malt, but maintains a high level of drinkability because it knows where to stop. Exceptional. Highly enjoyable."
"Found this beer to be ok.  Poured out to an average and expected color but with with little or no head.  It looked flat but didn't taste flat, so I don't think it was a bad bottle.  It had a good balance of hops and malt, but I think overall it was not the best representative of this group.  I personally prefer Smith's although some may disagree.  It is, however, very drinkable."
"Nicely drinkable, good hop flavor. Balanced yet bitter, but not Pacific Northwest bitter. Nice, spicy aroma of hops as I would imagine it would have been in the days of the British Rajah. Yum."
"This is one tasty brew.  The aroma is light, floral, and enticing. However, this is not a floral IPA like many American IPA's.  Really nice balance of maltiness and hops.  Superb mouthfeel and flavor.  I think this is an excellent brew, I could drink this as a session brew easily.  One bottle leads to another due to its inviting, interesting taste. Loved it."
"It poured with a burnt orange/copper color and thick head that left excellent lacing.  The hoppy bitterness of the aroma is at an appropriate level.  The taste is outstanding, a little less hoppy than other IPAs.  An excellent brew if you like a lighter IPA."
"Nice color, smooth combo of hops and malt. Not quite as hoppy as I like but still quite good for the hot day. Is a less hoppy pale ale less filling? Seems so to me. When I can't get to my favorite brewpub, I'll buy this."
"Fullers IPA pours a nice clear copper color, with an off white lace. On the nose is slight hop aroma, and slight caramel maltboth are fairly mild. On the palate the hops and malts were balanced well, biscuit, slight bitterness, some fruitiness as well, and caramel flavors. Very good IPA, I enjoy a slightly more mild IPA sometimes opposed to a Hop devil which seems to go better with a meal."
"Not a bad brew, although I was a bit disappointed. The color was a nice copper, and the head was thick and lasting. The aroma was a wafting hoppy experience, to say the least. There are definately hints of sweet yet earthiness in the flavor. I agree with Jason on this one, I need to have this one in my fridge more often as well. Prost!"
"A very good beer as are all that I have tried from Fullers.  Nice copper color and a very faint aroma.  The hops could be a little stronger in my opinion, leaves a good lace down the glass as you partake.............................CHEERS"
"190"
"pours out a dark copper color with a beautiful frothy, sticking head.  smells of caramel apples dipped in butter.  i'm drooling.  tastes of caramel malts, with an assertive english/earthy hop bite.  mouthfeel is all smooth and buttery.  this stuff is decadent.  an ale brewed for the senses.  not over the top in the american IPA tradition, but delicious without being loud and obnoxious.  yummy stuff."
"Fuller's has done it again.. From your first sip to the last drop this IPA is incredible. I was so taken in by the copper color to the hops  that grab you right away."
"Love those Fuller's bottles. If poured correctly the teardrop neck will slam the last half of your brew into the glass creating a nice tight sticky head. Trademark Fuller's nose. Beauty earthy hop flavor balances well with a mild toasty caramel malt backbone. Finish is hop bitter lingering inviting you to start the cycle over again. Nice modern English IPA, but considering the price I'd go Sam Adams IPA which is nearly as good and probably fresher."
"Fuller’s IPA:  Imperial pint bottle, thick, brown glass.  Very nice looking beer, with a firm hop aroma.  Excellent, flavorful beer, with pronounced hops throughout, supported by a light level of malt sweetness.  Long, long lingering aftertaste with hops.  Highly recommended."
"Light copper color in hue w/ a light haze.  The mediocre head settles quickly into a thin layer.  The very earthy, rustic and leafy Fuggles hop nose upfront is followed by slight nutty, biscuity notes.  Fruity, pear - like yeast esters are mild but detectable.  The body is fairly light, while the hop bitterness is quite mild for style.  Hop flavor is not unlike the hop nose-- rustic and earthy, but borderlining of being a bit course.  Malt flavors are light, toasty and a bit unexciting.  The finish is dry, clean and comprised solely of hop bitterness.  For Fullers, this is a most underwhelming brew.  It's way too tame for an IPA, but drinkable as is nonetheless."
"Same bottle as my journal article...full, sub amber color, head full in the middle and effervescent at the edge. Very assertive initial impression, hops are subdued and more berry/flower like. A sense of candy cane peppermint mid mouth that's very pleasant. Nice smell on sip. Finishes smoothly yet diminished. Malt is tasty and balance is excellent. Very drinkable but unlike many American I.P.A.s....nice..."
"Smells like caramel and freshly cut apple.  Dark amber, head quickly dissipates into a thin layer, then after more time, into nothing at all.  Sweet, malty and bitey.  Has a lingering malty aftertaste.  Faint bitterness.  A good beer, but not very complex and lacks character.  Was this beer abused in shipping and storage?"
"One of the ""Fuller"" flavored English IPAs. Excellent."
"More malty than other IPA's.  For those who like a smoother, less biting IPA, this is the one.  Personally, I kept thinking it needed more hops."
"A great unique tasting beer. Very malty, decent hops, unlike american IPA's.  For those of you who like your ale smooth, you can't go wrong with this ale or most other british beers."
"Notes: Following in the greatness of the ESB, this is a great beer but definitely a modern day English IPA. A beer I’d prefer to see in my fridge more often."
