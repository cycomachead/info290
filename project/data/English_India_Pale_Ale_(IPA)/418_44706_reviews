"English pub feel in my living room"
""
""
"Another solid offering from Left Hand, who is quickly moving up the ladder for me.  This is an IPA, but it's a bit maltier and less bitter than traditional ones, so that's why I liked it more than anticipated.  I'm not sure if others may have gotten a bad batch, because I really didn't get the sour or bitter taste or the foul aroma that some reviews have described.  I've never had this issue with Left Hand, so I'm definitely surprised that some have reviewed this beer so harshly."
""
""
"Terrible smelled like wet towels and my glasses are clean so I don't want to hear that shit"
"If you don't like this beer, then you don't know good English beer. Its funky, but that's the point. Really smooth and dry, love it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks good, smells good, tastes horrible. So sour and bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I would have like more complexity in the flavor;"
"I really liked it, yes indeed"

"My back ground was shape by serving 20 years in the US Air Force. This allowed me to travel to many parts of the US and overseas to sample many types of libations and to develop a discerning palate"

""
""
"It's a really really good IPA. It's just not my type of beer  :-//"
"Excellent. The mouthfeel and nose makes for an awesome twist on a classic beer."
""
"This one's a little different. Has a caramel flavor with a smidge of toffee flavor, which I'm not a fan of. It has a little piney aftertaste that lingers longer than I'd like. It's not bad but I probably won't rush out for more."
""
"Bitter with a funky bread taste"
""
"A very good beer overall, and it much better than I had expected it to be."

""

"I really enjoyed this beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Corey ok,  but not as good as some"
""
"Amber color with thin lingering surface bubbles. Sweet malt folowed by moderate fresh hops bitterness.  Medium thick body, fairly smooth. A  solid english style IPA."
""
""
""
"First time drinking an English style IPA so not sure how it compares but I really like this beer!"
""
""
""
"I do not usually like IPA's that much. They are way too over-hopsy for my taste. However, now this one - for the APA-lover that I am - is the perfect IPA.  Another fantastic beer from an outstanding brewery."
"This is an average beer"
"A good ipa, nice bitter taste, nice feel"
""
""
""
"Overall: I've had this beer before, but I guess I never rated it. Not a bad beer, I think part of the reason for the lower BA score is due to palate being use to American style IPAs, at least I found myself thrown off at first."

"A solid, but not extraordinary beer from Left Hand. One of my favorite breweries, but this beer is not their best."

"The nose is spice, earthy hops, chives, not much malt.  The flavor is earthy hops, with a malt backbone.  A little cotton candy, spice, potato.  This is old school ipa, but not a great interpretation.  Unfortunately, my preferences have changed and this doesn't stand out like I am sure it did 10 years ago."
""
""
"This was good, but not as good as I thought it would be. Nice malt backbone, I do like getting some malt through at the end after the hops come at the beginning and that's what you get here. Nice lace on the glass, yellow brown body, not too impressive looking overall. Nice carbonation, and served at the right temperature. I'd drink this again."

"O: A good beer but I was disappointed at the lack of malt presence. Usually the British pale ales and IPA's have a stronger malt backbone. I taste the British hops in this beer but the malt is sadly not present."

"Something about this beer... it's all man. It's lighter in feel, but kind of brutal in flavor. It's a little challenging for a beginner... or a Brit! Haha. Weighty with bitterness for the style, like a 400-pound monkey."
"Overall a decent English style ipa very easy drinking. I would buy again though not a true fan of the style."

"Pours a clear copper with a nice bubbly head. Slight pine, bread and spice smell. The caramel malt really comes through with a bit of fruit in the background. A nice touch of bitter aftertaste. A medium-light mouth with some carbonation. Very pleasant."

"When I first tried this beer, I didn't like it. I've had it since and thought that my first impression was wrong, but once again, I'm underwhelmed by 400#M. I think my bottle was a little skunky, which I'm not factoring into my score, but the beer also just doesn't have a good flavor or aroma, and I would only buy this again if I had to to choose between this and macro lagers."

"Had on tap at Sunset Cantina. Pours a very hazy golden color with no head. Little lacing and mildly carbonated. Not much of a smell. Has a malty lemon smell but nothing overwhelming. Tastes a bit sour to me, with little hops in the traditional style - a bit malty taste. Second and third tatses not really doing it for me with this one."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I'm a hop head but English-style IPAs tend to be an achilles heel of mine due to their unappealing hop character and dry bitterness. 400 Pound Monkey, on the other hand, is a good example of the style done in a tasty and drinkable way. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-pretty solid brew and highly sessionable. Wouldn't necessarily seek it out but wouldn't pass it up if it came my way again"
""
""
""
""

"Pours medium amber with a off white head. Tons of lacing hanging about as it is drank. The aroma is filled with bread malts and earthy hops. Lemon and grapefruit also sneak their way into the nose. Lots of grapefruit and orange zest up front in the taste. Hints of toasted caramel malts are also present. Very good mouthfeel, medium bodied. Low ABV makes this a nice drinker. One of the better EIPA I've had."

"Tried this beer at the Yard House in downtown Denver. The beer poured a nice color with a moderate head. It smelled good with a slight hoppy aroma, though not overpowering. The first drink was light and underwhelming. Typical English IPA. I did not realize it was an English IPA when I tried it so I was disappointed with the lack of anything approaching hoppiness in the first taste. As my mouth adjusted, it turned out to be a decent beer, but nothing to write home about."
""
""
"O: It's a little dull on all fronts, but all the English character I'm looking for has been dumbed down or is altogether not there. Just not a lot to grab the palate's attention, a very drab offering."

"D CLASSIC IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is definitely a unique beer that seems like a hybrid between a tripel (with the maltiness and sweetness) and an English IPA (with the light amount of bitterness). The beer hides its alcohol well but I wouldn't call it sessionable because the mouthfeel seems to have a heavy dose of malts."

"o: A stronger than average IPA but not outstanding except for its name. Worth trying, and ok. I'd probably rather have more fruit notes and less pine. OTOH it grew on me somewhat after the halfway mark."

"O: Well done English IPA. Must try again."
"A decent beer... an odd beer. If you like ""dirty"" beers/beers that have bizarre flavors that most people would find off-putting, this is the beer for you. The initial flavor on this beer is strange, strange, strange. After having a number of sips and working my way down the glass, that flavor went away a little bit, but I'm not forgetting that it was there. Given the price point and other tasty beers Left Hand makes for the same price point, I'm not sure I'd have this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorite IPAs for sure. So creamy smooth and malt forward, but enough bitterness and hops to keep it true to it's style. Just really excellent, I want this on cask now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm not too familiar with English-style ales of any form. In general, it was slightly above average, fairly decent. It had a nice look and the taste wasn't overbearing in anyway."

"O- An english ipa with a twist and a bit more character than usual, but still perfectly balanced and drinkable. Very nice"

"I like IPA's and I like Left Hand brews for the most part. This beer was a big disappointment however, I'm glad I only had a few bottles from a variety pack. Pours a clear light amber color with virtually no aroma. Hops are quite subdued and malt takes front and center in a weak way. There's something in the flavor that I just can't put my finger on, but I really don't like it. There's really nothing about this brew to latch on to as a saving grace, I can't recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavors of grassy hops, malts, white grapefruit rind, minerals, slight burnt toast. Overall quite flavorful with good body and a bitter semi-dry finish."
""
""
"The taste begins sweet and bready and the hops are more in in the background - subtle and balancing. I always liked the English IPA over the American IPA because it's not in my face bitter and Left hand captures those subtleties well. Easy for me to drink and enjoy."

"The beer had a nice head on it and had more malt aroma than I was expecting. A bit of earthy hop character was in there as well. It's an English style IPA (something not pointed out on the menu) so I adjusted my expectation of hop character. Even still, the balance seemed to be more towards the malt rather than the hop. In addition, the elements of the beer seemed ""flatter"" on flavor than I would have hoped (kind of like the beer had traveled all the way from England). In reality, it is a pretty good example of the style, just not what I was expecting."
""
""
"Overall - A slightly above-average IPA; not my favorite Left Hand but a nice English IPA. I'd drink it again but I probably wouldn't try too hard to find this one..."
""
""
"O: Decent english IPA but nothing special. Flavors are good but bitterness seemed a bit on the high end for my preference."
""
"O - Its an OK English IPA at best, this is the only think I can recall having from Left Hand, but it lacks in the flavor department big time, and the dry bitterness is not pleasing to the taste buds."
""
"A murky burnt orange body holds an off white head that recedes to thick film. Good webby lacing remains. I smell very faint caramel before diving into a really pure viny, almost grassy hop aroma. The beer starts off slightly sweet on the palate then the citric, bitter hops come on and perform well. There's a very bright, bitter finish. Overall, this has some balance but ultimately the bitter hops really take off."
""
""
""
""

"I rated this beer as high as you will ever see me rate an IPA. I'm not a big fan of IPA's or hoppy beers but I did quite enjoy this beer. It is an IPA and is quite hoppy for my taste, but it has more to offer than just bitterness. It is fairly fruity and bready, and has a very hazy appearance. I probably won't buy another 6 pack, but will continue to throw one into the pick six from time to time. This beer reminded me a lot of NewCastle, but a touch better and went down smoother."
""
""
""
""
"fish taste. Could be yeast, but then who would make a beer with such an awful taste and charge $2 per bottle in a 12-pack? This is my first beer from this brewery so who knows? It actually looks fairly decent (minus the floaties ) until you try to drink it."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall –A pretty nice English style IPA. It’s on the drier side with a good blend of citrus, earthy and herbal hop. Well worth a try."

"400#monkey- pours a nice golden with a little cloudiness. the smell is hoppy with hints of sweet caramel. it pretty bitter at first but finishes up smooth. this beer is a good ipa for when you dont want all that hppiness. its very drinkable and makes for a good alternative to stronger ipa's. i almost feel like this would be a great ""starter ipa"" is you were trying to turn someone on to them."
"O - enjoyable and easy to drink."
""
""

"O: not bad, but forgettable; I've enjoyed every beer from left hand, but expected more on this one."

""
""
""
""
""
"Would I buy it again? Yes. Would be nice on a hot summer night."
""
""
"O: This is an American Style IPA, so there is not going to be a punch of anything really. This beer is evenly blended with hops and citrus that may be intended for someone experimenting or beginning in the style. Nothing really wows me about this beer, but it is pretty tasty."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, I liked this better than Summit IPA. This was toastier, and had a better aroma."
""
""
"Apparently this needs to be 250 characters long, so I will try to autopsy this beer. It is supposedly an IPA but any hop flavor has been murdered and left for dead by a terrible roasted nutty flavor (imagine a strange mix of garlic, the scent of a wet ashtray and candied macadamia). I understand diversity in style, perhaps if someone really likes nuts and chocolate/burned flavors and has a genetic defect in their taste buds, this is for them. But, it is not an IPA, and it tastes terrible."

"I poured this average beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was an amber color as I guess it should have been. The head was decent at first but went away pretty fast. The beer had decent to good lacing. Smell was hoppy which was strange for an amber. Taste was hoppy with bitter finish. Did not like the beer and will not buy again."
""
"Pours hazy orange with a one finger off white head. The beer is more malty then hoppy, keeping to the tradition of the english style IPA. The hops are still there however, some fresh citrus notes and a slight pine. Caramel and toffee compliment the hops well. Traditional English style malts make this a unique IPA. This is a good IPA and a definite change of pace from the american style that Im used to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty too. It's modestly herbal, with citrus and pineapple notes. Still, at a few parts the beer doesn't totally come together to justify a higher score. Regardless, the beer is medium bodied with an enjoyable level of crispness, and goes out as an honest IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"In conclusion, it isn’t the greatest, but it isn’t bad either and it makes a good choice for those who are less receptive to the IPA style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent traditional IPA. Perhaps a bit too much hop bitterness and not enough malt flavor overall, but I still like this beer. I definitely would sit down and gladly quaff another glass or two of this brew when in an IPA-frame of of mind..."
""
"Generally a good IPA , thick one finger head, slightly malty aroma. I probably wont buy this beer again, it has all of the flavors of a really good IPA but none of them are strong enough to make it stand out. This would be a good beer to give to my Busch light swilling friends as an introduction into the joys of beer snobbery."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled 5/3/2012. Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a small 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, herbal, pine, floral, biscuit, light citrus, and earthy spiciness. Pretty nice and pleasant aromas with good balance. Taste of caramel, biscuit, pine, herbal, floral, toast, light citrus, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, pine, herbal, floral, and earthy spiciness. Good bitterness/sweetness balance; with a fair amount of complexity of flavors. No cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish. Extremely smooth and easy to drink. Overall this is a nice English IPA. Well balanced with a nice flavor profile; very easy to drink. Wouldn’t mind having it again; fresher next time too. Quite enjoyable."
"Pours a semi-clear golden amber color with a fluffy white head. There are mild scents of hops and citrus hidden amongst the mix. The taste has a good hoppy taste but the bitterness is rather mild in comparison to an IPA. Texture is smooth and mellow as I pick up strains of yeast, citrus, and bready tones. Perhaps a little thin but delivers a nice, slightly crisp after taste. An easy drinking IPA with a very memorable name!"
""
""
""
""
"I've had this beer on tap twice. Both times I've felt this beer was really bad. I've had this style before and enjoyed it, I just don't feel like this beer is very good. Beyond bitter and it seemed like a burned rubber taste was present. Just nothing enjoyable about it to me. My friend also felt it was very bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: A nice beer that I don't love. This could definitely use a tweak here or there. I would especially love to see the flavors amped up and some more yeasty carbonation. Refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's an English IPa so I wasn't expecting a big hop presence and thats what i got. A densent maltier brew of the English tradition."

"O:  The bitterness of this IPA is a touch too much. I love hops but the bitterness is a little less than desirable. There is a taste that I can't put my finger on but it almost ruins the beer. As a whole this is a good beer but not one that would be on my go to list. "
"Good carbonation. A decent IPA."
"Overall an excellent beer definitely worth revisiting."
"Overall - This is a good IPA, but I guess you would have to be more into this style. Personally I enjoy the Stranger in all categories minus the mouthfeel"

"Definitely recommended for a hot day."

"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. The ""bottled on"" part of the label has not date with it. Clear yellow-orange color without much head (one finger at most that disappeared quickly) or carbonation. Not a powerful aroma. Typical amount of bitterness up front without much after taste, light and somewhat refreshing finish."
""
""
"This beer is a beautiful, clear deep golden color. The head is white and long lasting. Nice aroma...herbal, floral and hoppy. It's not a traditional goldings or fuggle smell, but it is clean and hoppy. There is a little malt sitting behind the hop smell as well. Biscuity and bready. The aroma, however, is a little restrained. Nice flavor...great balance. The foretaste is sweet, quickly balanced by a firm bitterness that lasts long into the finish. Medium in body. Nice beer."
""
"A gentle, easy-drinking, British style IPA. Sessionable."
""
"O- Like the Stranger, I thought this was a fairly average English IPA. A little bit less sweet, with more spices. Easily drinkable, but nothing that stands out. I would definitely like to try this beer a little bit fresher (I'd expect it to be a little bit hopier), but unfortunately due to it being brewed almost across the country and it being sold in a 12-pack it picked up a little bit of age on it's journey. Still nothing to write home about, but not bad for a beer in a variety 12-pack. I wouldn't buy a 6-pack of this, but would maybe consider the 12-pack again."

"O: Good. A little too sweet for me, but it is an English IPA, after all."
""
""
""
"3.0 D: Good beer, but it doesn't stand out at all and that is just about a must given how many IPAs are out there."

"330ml bottle. ½ Pint glass. Enjoyed on may´12. Golden color, chill haze appearance. White froth, close crown. Brief retention. Remaining collar on top. Intense hoppy aromas, hints of piney & wood. Bitter upfront & gentle mildy maltiness. Light body, soft carbonation. Subtle fruitness in the middle. Oils & resins into the finish with a funny touch have made me feel green medlar astringency (curious!) Very easy drinkability. Refreshing."

"O - Sweet and not citrus, glad the carmelness wasn't to strong."
"OVERALL: Again, this is a decent example of the style from Left Hand, but a little underwhelming in my opinion. This is an outstanding IPA for people who don’t like IPAs."

""
"O: Very nice balance with floral hops/citrus and malt. Everything works well, i'd def buy this again."

"O: It is possible the bottle wasn't up to snuff, although it wasn't old. I was concerned when there was almost no head at the pour. It was OK but not particularly good. However, I would give it another try with a different bottle or on tap."
""
""
""
""
"The body was way too thin for the style, I expect an English IPA to have a pleasantly full and smooth body. Drinkability was good enough, I suppose, but why have more than 1? Overall, not a good representation of the style. Try it to tick it, otherwise skip it."

"Pours clear golden copper color, nice big fluffy head. Slight aromatics, with aroma of some honey and a bit of citrus hops, but overall not particularly strong. Flavor is underwhelming with no hop bit whatsoever. Slight hay, bready, a little pale malt sweetness, some honey. Easy drinking, medium high carbonation. More of a golden ale than an IPA or pale ale. I see it is listed as an English IPA here, but I don't know if that was intended by the brewer or not. Just not very flavorful."
""
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a nice light orange color body with not a lot of head to it and not a lot of lace either. The smell has a nice hop aroma and a little bit of citrus. The taste has a nice up front hop taste and then a little bit of malt comes through on the finish. The mouth feel is good and overall this is a good ipa."
" Overall I enjoyed this IPA, very nice flavor with a solid American take on the english style, recommended."

"O - Slightly above average drinking. Nothing to write home about but pretty good drinking."
""
""
""
"A golden and pale yellow color. It presents more like a Pale ale than your standard IPA. 3 fingers of off white suds with exceptional lacing and stick. Hops are present in the smell, but it is overtaken by a wonderful smell of freshly baked bread. This is a nicely balanced IPA that drinks very easy. It has nice hop components and a nice clean finish. I'd definitely get this again.... A solid craft brew."
""

""

" Really enjoyed this from the Left Hand mixer I bought and I was very hesitant to try as I thought it was going to be a typical IPA whole cone chewer to share with the drain. Cheers to Left Hand on another solid brew, in a fairly solid stable of beers."
""
""
""
""
"Sorry to have to report this is a bad brew, but that's pretty much all there is to say. Based on appearance and general carbonation and mouthfeel, it had potential, and if you read I'm not alone in this negative experience.... just AVOID this and drink any of the 100s of others."
""
"Overall this is a very drinkable beer. It's a little different than other IPAs I've been drinking (at least recently), almost as if it had pinch of Blonde thrown into it. It's well balanced and drinkable. Check it out, it's certainly worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"eh. pours a very clear light golden color with nice white lacing and a small white head. smells like an english malt attack and thats about it, deep though, layered. flavor is very malty, taste like the spent grains at a brewery smell, has a bitter finish. i wouldnt call this an ipa by even english standards, but whatever. feel is decent, heavier than it looks, sturdy abv, fine carbonation. overall im just not impressed here, pretty pedestrian brew for lefthand."

"O - Lacking in every area but taste, this beer proves that taste is and always will be the most important factor with other characteristics only supporting it. If this beer had better aromas and was carbonated better then it would make this good beer a great beer."
""
"At first I was quite turned off by this beer because straight out of the fridge, all you get is harsh bitterness with no malt flavor. Let it warm up some, however, and you will be rewarded with a delicious malty and hoppy treat unlike a lot of IPA's on the market."

"Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, easy going and refreshing. Just barely coats your tongue, mainly just sliding over to relieve it."
""
"D - The creepy bug-eyes starting at me as I drink this bottle is a little odd, otherwise it's fair going down. 400 Pound Monkey is a good English IPA that I'm not overly turned on by but, certainly not turned off by either."
""
"This one was pretty good. It would be a really good easy drinker for the summer. But I feel the herbal peppery flavors aren't my favorites. I would rather go with an APA to session. Pretty good for the style though."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. Fairly aggressive pour yields a rather limp head; ivory colored, reasonably dense, but about an inch and falling quickly to a thin foam. The beer is dark golden, with a very slight haze. The nose shows earth, green herbs and mint, and toasted white bread. That shows through on the tongue too,with a little malt sweetness and some breadiness leading to a cleansing dryness. A very drinkable brew that is a nice change from the alcoholic hop teas that pass for ""IPAs"" these days. I wish it were a little prettier in the glass, but I'll look for this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - It isn't really awful. It just isn't very good. The hop flavors aren't very pronounced, and the after taste is unpleasant. I am sad I grabbed a six pack of these."

"O: Not a bad beer but not my favorite. A little too dry and bitter to my liking but overall a respectable beer"
""
""
"O: Overall, it's an IPA. An above average IPA? Eh... pretty average, but it looks nice and the piney flavor isn't overpowering like some others (take that as you will). Would I buy it again? Subjectively, no. I'm not a huge IPA guy, but there is the rare IPA that I do like, and I try to rate objectively. This is nothing special for a craft IPA."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, blank best by date. This pours a light golden color, maybe yellow with a decent white head which leaves a lacing. The smell is of toffee and malts. The feel is medium to light. The taste is okay, a little bitterness with some sweet malts, low hop profile."

""
"Had this beer a few times now and each time I just don't care for it. The look of the beer is nice. The color is a nice clear copper color with a thick foamy white head on top. The smell isn't really that pleasing to me, It's hoppy but it kinda smells weird to me. The taste is even worse, I don't know what they use in this brew but I really don't care for it. The mouthfeel was pretty good, and it's drinkable for sure. Overall if the taste was better this brew would be awesome but I'm just not sure of it."
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass this brew was a nice yellow golden wheat color with a simple 1 finger white head. The aroma was strong of citrus. Not much more to it. The taste was nice and fresh, but not overly hoppy (which I like). There was nice lemon and orange flavors along with a faint spruce note. The brew was a little high in carbonation for being such a light body brew. This was average for the style."

"O: Very nice. This is an extremely well-balanced IPA and one that will appeal to hopheads and or Advocates alike."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"O: This is certainly a well balanced beer, hitting heavy with the biscuity malts to balance out the hops (or maybe it's the other way around?) either way, this brew brings a lot of good flavors."
"O-overall this is decent. I wouldn't buy this to just enjoy. Its not bad, just doesnt suit my taste that well. I would recommend this to someone who maybe wants to try a mild IPA. or a lighter IPA but not as a Beer I enjoy."

"There are some 'off' flavors here too, which makes me think this may not be the freshest sample. I can make this beer work, but there are so many better English style IPA's out there."
"Ok. Nothing really off with it, but no flavors that wow me."
"Pours a nice honey/gold color with a thick head. Head retention was lacking but left some decent lacing down the sides. Taste was very hop centered but well balanced with the malts. Malt taste was great and gave hints of honey and caramel flavors. The more that I drink this one the more it grows on me. I like the overall balance of this brew."
"O- I like the idea of a more balanced IPA. This one just didn't do it for me. Probably wouldn't go for again."
"400 pound monkey english india pale ale was a slighty above average. The taste was mellow compared to what you expect from a india pale ale. Even though it did have as bitter of a taste the finish was still nice. Overall I would give this beer a B- grade."
"Overall: I am not very familiar with English IPAs though I have read they are supposed to be more watery than theAmerican version but this isn't watery, but basically lacking any hop bitterness or body that I expected."
"Overall Drinkability - Entirely unimpressive. Not bad. Just too one dimensional for my tastes. Considering I'm rating this beer by style, this fat monkey faces significant competition, and unfortunately ranks a bit low on the bell curve. Again, not a bad beer, just not very impressive or noteworthy, especially for the style."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and oily slick with very light carbonation, a medium body and a slight bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable and very enjoyable, this could be a session beer for me."
"Only a 1/4"" off-white head which faded fast. Slightly hazed raw sienna yellow color. Smells mildly of hops. Taste is medium hoppy with a little citrus. Look, although this is a decent IPA I'd enjoy anytime, and not overdone, I really don't see anything deserving the 400 pound monkey designation about it. Cool label though."
"have no hesitation serving this to my hop-loving friends."
"Pours a clean yellow to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, grassy hos and a gingerbread malt. In the taste, gingerbread like malt and grassy hops. A small hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry gingerbread malt and a hint of hops in the aftertaste. Mellow and quite English, but nice and enjoyable."
"A little heavy for a sessionable IPA but still a good effort."
"O: Good"
"O: a nice daily ale"
"(D)- A solid IPA. Fruity and good hop profile."
"O: overall a very tasty IPA. I liked the combination and balance between the sweet and bitter feels in the palate; well done Left Hand."
"O - I'm definitely not impressed with this beer. It doesn't really have much to offer besides an entertaining albeit somewhat gaudy label. Not sure if this is old or a bad batch but it definitely was not good for me."
"Overall a sessionable brew, but not something I'd buy again. I thought this beer would be better than this."
"I have been wanting to try this beer for a very long time. Everytime I saw it. it was always out of code. This time it was in code. English style IPA, I love all IPA but sometimes the over hoped American ones is a too much. I love this smell and color of this beer. This beer like most IPA has no head or some. This is nice balance beer. I really happy I have try this beer. This is a very nice session beer and i would drink this doing my grilling or clean. Try it! Cheers!"
"The first IPA of the night. Expecting hoppy aroma but I’m not getting any. Not a good sign. Is the beer old? Skunked? I’ve had this before and draft and I don’t remember it being so lifeless, but that was a long time ago. From the bottle it fails to excite. The taste is off, and there’s an awful finish. Sticky, unbalanced, harsh. The bottle’s the last of a six pack purchased a little over a month ago, which could mean it’s a couple months old at this point (depending on how long it took to reach the shelves) but I’m told the first five tasted the same. A disappointment from a brewery that I have had nothing but praise for."
"(O) More fruits than anything. Not too bad of a brew but nothing crazy. Doesn't taste like an IPA. Great initial taste but ends musty."
"Overall: A decent middle of the road IPA. However, I think it's not balanced well enough to be considered an English IPA, and not hoppy enough to be an American one. I'm still looking for a good American interpretation of Jaipur. Gotta give props to the label designers, though. It's a really cool design that you can easily get lost in, whether or not you've had a couple."
"Overall, a good beer that I really enjoyed even if it wasn't kicking me with hops and new flavors every few seconds."
"Tastes a little sweet upfront with a middle bitterness kick, then a soapy malty texture. The citrus hops is there with a slight nutty, bready malt flavor. The taste is different. Based as an English IPA style, I feel this one takes on some notable American notes. A welcome change from traditional US IPAs. It sure seems to cross the boundaries between the English & American IPA styles."
"Overall - Pretty nice and balanced. Its a little light in the hops. A nice example of the style. Pretty easy to drink also. Worth a drink."
"O- nice beer to sip on and would try it again. For the serious hoppy ipa taste look elsewhere."
"Overall a well balanced IPA that was not overpowered by hops and was very easy to drink."
"This is a good brew. The appearance is impressive; this beer sports a nice fluffy head and orange/amber color. Hops/Herbal in the nose. The mouthfeel is about right: not too intense. The taste is perhaps a bit too herbal for my blood; I felt as though I were drinking carbonated herbal tea at points; which is not necessarily preferable. At any rate. it is still pretty decent."
"O: Nothing wrong with it but nothing special."
"I made the mistake of turning down my refrigerator a bit too much and as a result this beer was near frozen when I opened it. So it poured with no head at all. Although it appears as though it does under normal circumstances according to other reviews. Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow with just a bit of orange. Herbal, resinous hop nose, with a bit of estery fruit as well. The hops are up front and persist throughout but are in pretty good balance with the malt which makes sense since they are going for a more English style. This is not your typical west coast style IPA which is a nice change. (not to say I don't love West Coast IPA's, I do.) Another solid offering from a pretty underrated brewery."
"Overall, the beer presents a surprising flavor profile, and is worth a try."
"Not bad, but I would not have again."
"Overall, an OK IPA, I'm slightly disappointed after having their milk stout. Note: I'm not used to drinking many English IPA's so compared to an American it is very different."
"Gold colored brew, just the slightest of haze. Small white head doesnt last long but still laces up the joint. Caramel malt scent with a fair amount of diacetyl followed by some bitter hops. Caramel malt front, biscuity, some buttery-ness, but not much. Floral and bitter hops, and some spiciness from the alcohol. Medium bodied, pretty sharp on the tongue. Its definitely an american take on an EIPA, and i think they put together a good one."
"O: A very refreshing English IPA - although there’s not as much hop or malt flavor as an American IPA, the abv is comparable; a nice, balanced beer."
"O - Lightish bodied but packs a big punch on the flavor. As advertised, not the same old."
"O: These English India Pale Ales pair well with spicy food. Good beer."
"M- A bit thin and under carbonated for my taste."
"Overall this isn't that bad, it's certainly got a solid hop presence, but not a distinct character. I still say it's alright."
"D - Not bad, but it is strongly overshadowed by my recent tasting of Samuel Smith's. Not a bad take on the English India, though, and maybe I'll revisit sometime."
"Clear gold with a short white cap. Lots of fine bubbles clung to the glass, decent head retention. The aroma was floral, a bit citrusy and grassy, toasted malts and honey. Moderate bitterness with a citrus rind edge, toasty and bready malts, grassy hops. Lingering bitterness with a hint of alcohol. Medium bodied with lowish carbonation, slight resin texture. Overall, I enjoyed it."
"This could make for an awesome session beer. Just needs to drop a percent or two."
"the website does not give the IBUs, i would put them somewhere in the mid 60s. the website also lists wheat on the grain bill. brilliant. Why didn't i think of that?"
"D ~ Acquired in a 2 for 2 trade with a friend. Not fantastic but a good effort from Left hand. Recommend trying but not seeking out."
"Poured this English IPA from a bottle into a pint glass. It poured a nice pale amber color. Very good clarity. This IPA produced a nice white head and very good head retention. The aroma was a nice hoppy, herbal and pepper mix. There was some lacing left on the glass. The taste of the beer has a very malty bread like base that is full of fresh hop bitterness. This IPA is a very good classic rep of the style. This beer is medium in body, and has a dry finish."
"I really wanted to like this beer. But I hated it. No fear, Left Hand did a solid enough job on the Milk Stout to have me coming back to them, just not for the Monkey."
"Real good beer overall. No flash or wows, just a solid enjoyable brew. Could be a good icebreaker for a non-crafter."
"I found this beer somewhat unremarkable when I tried it from a bottle. Later, I visited the Left Hand taproom in Longmont, CO and found the cask version on tap. Wow! what a difference. It had acquired a delightfully silky mouthfeel and a soft head. At 6.7% and a fourty-five minute drive home, I had to drink far less than I would have liked."
"D - A solid English IPA."
"Overall is a good beer. I could drink a few of these in a row for sure."
"O: Well made IPA but requires more hops in my opinion."
"D - not a bad brew, could definitely be a session beer."
"Transparent golden in body topped by white bubbly head. Smells of some lightly toasted malts, corn sugar, and sour grain. Lemon, citrus rind, grass, bitter and dry, finishes sour grain. Light in body with high carbonation. A bit offensive and unsatisfying in all aspects."
"O: Fairly good overall. Nothing special. NEEDS MORE HOPS!"
"O: Looked good and initially smelled good, and even the upfront flavor was good. The finish just threw it all off."
"O: This is a strange version of an English IPA. It's hard to pin down. It's not a horrible beer, but neither is it a brilliant one."
"Overall: A decent IPA with good hops flavors and bitterness. I like the ABV for sessions, and this tastes really refreshing ice cold. I would definitely have one again, and would like to try it on tap sometime."
"Overall, it's a good beer, and I have no doubt that I'll be seeing it again!"
"This beer pours a cloudy, light amber color with a two finger white head that dissipates somewhat slowly and leaves a thin cap that lingers throughout. It also leaves some spotty lacing. It smells largely of hops, floral and herbal, but some bready sweetness there as well. Tastes nice, more malt than I would have expected, but still very much on the hoppy side. The malty, caramel flavor gives over quickly to the floral hops and finishes semi-dry with a nice lingering bitterness. It feels good on the tongue, on the thin side of medium-bodied. Overall, this one is a really nice beer, very drinkable. Well done, Left Hand!"
"There was a nice floral hoppiness, somewhat muted hints of orange and lemongrass with a touch of pine. Decent malt base was apparent as the aroma of bread came through nicely. The flavor followed much of the same, owing that nice light floral hoppiness, but never having enough of it to really push it all the way forward. Nice little bite of bitter on the back of the tongue, and a slightly fruit finish, with apples coming through very clearly, especially in the aftertaste. The Mouthfeel was a little thin, maybe a touch watery, but had more then decent carbonation. A bit of a slickness to it as well. Superbly session able though as this was a very easy drinker and I could have thrown this one down all night long to be honest."
"Overall - You had better go to your local craft beer store or pub and snag this up before I do. If they don't have it, perform unmentionable favors for your local beer store guy in order to get some. Not sure what's so particularly English about this one other than the use of the Boadicea Hops which are relatively unknown other than they are named for a Celtic/England warrior queen. Similar to Czech Saaz in profile from what I can discern. Anywho, rockin' brew, y'all!"
"a not so nice earthy taste. generally i like earth tones so not sure why not this time. it was a bit medally as well so perhaps that was my problem with it. cool label though"
"Sorry, but this one is a complete miss for me. This is the 3rd one I've had out of the 6'er, and I've felt the same about each one."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a tame malt scent that boasts of pale and biscuit malts along with a noble hop aroma. The taste is good. It has an easy drinking pale malt flavor that goes down easy with a moderate hop bitterness and a nice biscuit malt finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an above average beer, but nothing to get too excited about."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer and it does justice to the style. As I mentioned, the hops are a little unusual, though they seem like the appropriate regional hops, they just don't normally appear in this style, so I don't think that it is the spawn of a clone-brew...at least not one I am familiar with. Either way, I have a 6-pack of this beer, and I will gladly drink it. Though I will spread these out as I doubt that I can do more than a couple in one sitting."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors blend nicely, but there could be a bit more of them. I like the bit of fruit flavor and the bready malts though."
"I'll drink another one and try to taste and smell harder. But I'm guessing there will be 4 of these left for my nephews when they come to visit this summer, indiscriminately drinking any and all beer in the fridge."
"Overall I am not that fond of this one."
"A very nice English style IPA, laid back and mellow but full of flavor nonetheless. Makes a pleasant change from the American style IPAs I've been drinking (won't convert me however!). Definitely recomended."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a brighter, crystal clear tan-gold coloring with a foamy, light bubbled, white head that starts at a healthy 2 inches and eventually settles into a film. Aromas of light hoppiness combined with a sweet caramel and citrus/tangerine character that is intriguing. Bitter and peppery hop forward flavor with the citrus providing a decent backseat balance. Good lacing on the glass, the beer has a slick, almost oily feel in mouth. Peppered hop aftertaste with a dry, bitter finish. Very true to the style...you could do a lot worse than this tasty brew!"
"O- I thought this was above average. Fairly drinkable, and abv not noticeable, at least after one."
"O - I’m going to reserve my judgment for another day on this one. It was good enough to keep me interested, but not to the point that I’ll run right out to fill the growler again. Maybe next time I’ll try to find it in a bottle and see if that makes a difference."
"O - A nicely balanced, fruity, juicy beer. Fine session beer."
"400 Pound Monkey is another solid IPA in a long lineup of solid American IPAs. While there may not be much to distinguish it from the pack, there is every reason in the world to buy it again: unrestrained hoppiness, balancing maltiness, solid flavor, gratifying and refreshing drinkability. In fact, the only problem with it is that after one you want at least two more!"
"Overall it seems like the bottled version is wimpy compared to the tap. But without a bar in the state to serve it, my taste buds will not soon be satisfied."
"Poured a hazy golden amber color with a good amount of white head on it. Smell was very good - nice hops, some bready and floral notes as well. Taste was great, solid bitter hop flavor throughout with some bready malt coming through. Light to medium mouthfeel, this beer went down nice and smooth. Would definitely go for it again sometime - I like this one quite a bit."
"Left Hand really does know what they're doing in the brews that they make. Try this one if you have the chance."
"Overall - I like this beer. I would drink it as much as I would any of my favorite pale ales. It's a little different, because it seems a bit lighter than other IPA's. I suggest you go buy this and see for yourself. This beer is flavorful, somewhat light (NOT WATERED DOWN!!), but it still grabs your taste buds and squeezes them till you beg for more."
"Overall, this ones a winner. I'll definitely buy this again!"
"All over the map with this one, takes a better palate than mine to sense the subtle nature of of this brew, I felt the taste was a bit airy at times with hop bitterness running the show. Tastes a bit different than it smells. Not bad but minor league as far as IPAs go."
"Pours a slightly hazy off-golden color with medium sized head. mixed citrus and cakebread on the nose. Some of that cakebread quality is present on the palate too with a nicely balanced bitterness. A mineral component is there too . Easy drinking and a refreshing change from so many American IPA ."
"D: Despite it's flaws, it is a highly drinkable beer."
"While this isn't a session beer, I could have easily had a few in a sitting since it wasn't that strong and didn't leave me puckering up after each sip. Having the bottling date legible in English on the side was also good even though this was a bit older than I would have liked to have seen. Pleasant surprises are one of the aspects of trying new beers that I love and this certainly fell under that category. I""m surprised this isn't rated higher on here!"
"Bottled on date on front label of bottle. 1/2 inch fizzy white head on a clear, sparkling pale amber body, lots of tiny bubbles rising to the surface. Head quickly dissipated to a thin layer on the top. Good lacing. Moderately hoppy, citrus aroma. Initial taste was moderately bitter, heavy hops in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium creamy, not as fizzy as I expected. Not a big fan of IPAs, one was enough for me."
"O - Never again. One of the worst beer tasting experiences ever."
"Its dinner time for the kids and we have been all over the Bourbonais and Chicago area this morning and afternoon. My daughter placed 10th over all at her State gymnastics meet for her age group...SWEET! Buddy brought this beer over and decided to try it tonight...wish I didnt. I really dont think I like this beer. Its a cloudy golden thin white head and decent lacing. Not much smell and the taste is all English style....but it is not as good as BASS. Anyway....good luck if you try this one...its not for me!"
" besides it's strange and ""off"" flavors from dead yeast this one is pretty much normal"
"Overall: This sure ain't no English IPA (and I sure do love those English Pale Ales) - this is its blondie sexy, full-bodied, full-flavored floozy American (hoppier) version that unabashedly flaunts full-frontal strong alcohol with your overwhelmed tastebuds. Had me at first sip! I sure ain't no hophead but I sure so recognize a very, very good beer. I wuz taken with this one! Very Recommended!"
"Personal critique: I bought and opened the beer without any preconceptions and was throughly disappointed. I came to BA expecting it to get a slamming but it seems other people like it. I love IPAs but I'd rather be drinking a PBR or High Life than this. Maybe I got a shitty bottle, even though it's a one and a quarter month old and I got it refrigerated from a specialty beer store. I'm just happy I *sip&gag* was able to distract myself with this review while drinking the beer."
"Easy drinking, this is the third decent beer I've had from the Left Hand missed 12 pack. A good 12 pack to pick up if you're having people over for a casual evening of games and brews, and want something that will taste good but not overtax the pallates of your guests."
"Drinkability: There's an interesting yeasty fruitiness to it, and as an English style IPA it can get away with less hops in the nose and flavor, but it somehow seems off. I suspect it's fermented a bit high in temperature."
"This pours hazy light orange with 1 1/2 fingers of foamy head and some lacing. The nose is light hops with a stronger sweet malty smell to follow. The taste is very bitter with a hint of honey up front.This reminds me of an English bitter. 400 Pound Monkey is tasty, but pretty bitter. I would like a little more malt balance. The body is medium but overall easy to drink. This is a good beer for a change, I usually like American IPA. This is similar to Goose Island Honker's Ale, only more bold. The box says ""earth and herbal"". I would agree with that...maybe aged, wet hops...very earthy."
"Poured from a bottle. Thin head dissolves quickly. Orange-yellow colored beer. Smells of fruity hops. Orange citrus smell predominates. Taste is also orange flavored hops. A very mild bitter hop kick, but nothing like a hoppy IPA or Czech pilsner. Mouthfeel is average, average carbonation and density and smoothness. Drinkability is ok, about average. I'm not craving another but I wouldn't pass on having it again."
"d- can drink a lot of it, but does not look to forward to next sip"
"Could use more carbonation to get the flavors to pop a bit more. Lighter bodied almost watery. Sessionable feeling, but abv kind of prevents that. All right for the English style."
"Clear in glass, good head. Carbonation correct. Nice flavors and mouth feel. Not as hoppy as I would expect."
"Definitely different than your typical American IPA, quite good, glad I got a chance to try it."
"Notes: This is a medium-bodied, full-flavored example of what Americans can do with a British style. The creamy mouthfeel screams English. The hop character brings out the US side. A solid brew, and may be one of my new favorite offerings from Left Hand. Even at it's strength, is a session brew by all means!"
"Overall, not a bad IPA, but not a favorite of mine."
"Despite being mild for the type, it's still bitter and that ABV is pretty manly. One of these is plenty."
"It has a lighter body that leaves the mouth finely coated, and the drinkability is also very good. A nice brew from Left Hand, a unique IPA that's definitely sixer-worthy if you're looking for something different and drinkable."
" This beer definitely has the ABV of an IPA making it less sessionable no matter how much the flavor want's it to be. Being a bit toned down this beer would be a nice choice for someone wanting to try an IPA but not wanting something too wild as to ruin their experience. Great Beer Left Hand Brewing Co.!!"
"D: really, really good"
"From random notes: Aroma: Lots of floral and herbal hops, with a hint of citrus. Appearance: Sparkling gold with a thick white head. Taste: Medium sweetness tempered with a medium bitterness and a light sourness. Not unpleasant, and quite drinkable. Palate: Light-medium body, slick texture, lively carbonation, and a long finish. Overall: Left Hand clearly doesn't go for the ""the hoppier the better"" IPA route, which makes this beer stand out. The hops are there, and quite flavorful, but not so overpowering that the drinker is forced to pucker."
"I enjoyed this beer, it was an interesting take on an IPA."
"The pour is a pale orange color in a pint glass creating a thin white head. Smells of citrus, yeast and a hint of lemon zest. The taste has some nice hops with bitter fruits. The hops aren't overpowering at all. A very easy drinking IPA with a bitter finish. I could easily drink more than one of these."
"Pours a dark straw color wit a bronze tint to it with a white head. Head is average sized, foamy, and leaves some decent lacing. Taste is well balanced a subtle. Herbal hops with some tea leaf flavors and a grainy backbone. Lighter bodied and clean on the palate. Not my kind of IPA but definitely a nice change of pace, very easy to enjoy a few of these."
"M/D - Clean, refreshing and easy to drink. The aftertaste leaves me wanting more with the semi-dry finish - One of the more drinkable IPA's I've had in a while."
"12oz bottle. Pours a hazy yellowish orange with a thin head that dissipates quickly. Minimal lacing. Aromas of citrus hops, yeast, and orange peel. Taste has a nice hop bite to it upfront. Citrusy and bitter with some breadiness to it. Interesting beer. It's a different kind of English IPA and I'm digging it. Worth having again."
"M&D- The mouthfeel is light and washes down quickly. It Isn't as drinkable as some of the other EIPA's i've had but is overall really nice."
"Not my favorite IPA but definitely good none the less."
"A straight-up, no-strings-attached, full-on modern English IPA, we dig it ... a bit too much alcohol to be considered sessionable, perhaps, but it wants to be."
"Left Hand continues to disappoint."
"overall this is a good sessionable drinker. there are much better examples of the style out there, but its worth a try. i wouldnt buy this again, however."
"D: An English IPA that ventures away from its roots toward the realm of its American cousin."
"That's one big, six-armed monkey! It pours a hazy gold topped by a finger of white froth. The nose comprises sweet caramel, light grapefruit, and honeydew. The taste holds notes of grapefruit, light caramel, and a light-ish pine near the finish. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a very nice EIPA, but not necessarily something I would actively seek out again."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: You wouldn't know this one is nearly 7% except for a whiff of booziness in the nose. Very easy drinking and balanced. I could definitely drink a few of these and not know what hit me."
"Drinkability is good. Kind of an odd beer, but I like the uniqueness of this one."
"The bitterness is a bit unbalanced to be sessionable, but the malt, yeast, and water characteristics are spot on for what I might look for in an English Pale Ale. I'd rather have less hops. Not inclined to buy it again, but it's a quality brew."
"Pours a clear golden color with a very large very tight white head that leaves a bit of lace. Aroma is not particularly pungent, and certainly less so than is expected out of most IPAs. There is some caramel & biscuit toned malts are in there, some mango, some odd stinkiness, and some nice floral notes. This one is pretty damned bitter, which is a good thing but there isn't a lot of flavor backing up that bitterness. There is some resiny and fruity hop character but really you kind of have to strain for it. The malt is one of the most defined things in the aroma. I generally like my IPAs on the bitter and dry side with very little malt character, there is little doubt that these descriptors fit the bill with this one but I'm dying for a little bit more hop character beyond bitterness. It's got the grapefruit without the fruity character. With minor tweaking I think this might be wonderful, this is of course wishful thinking."
"Drink- It's an okay rep of the style. I think needs a bit of work."
"1400th Review... 12 ounce bottle... Overall, a very good depiction of the style, but nonetheless, slightly cloying with respect to taste and mouthfeel... Oily with a bitter alcohol afterbite. Piney hops predominate the palate with a thick and viscous mouthfeel. Average drinkability at best; did not flow as smoothly but an accurate representation of the genre... Good stuff but I've had better from Left Hand..."
"Pours an ULTRA clear light golden-yellow. Fine and large carb bubbles, a white head patches to the glass. A nice & clean beer to look at. Smell borders on some adjuncts, but I get a nice & mild evergreen hops note, some spice, and a bit of biscuit. Tastes just the same, except the dry hopping makes it a bit more pronounced. The ABV is right for this one. Definitely finishes bitter, but not painfully so. Maybe could use an upkick in the malt department, but it's still an easy drinker, and a nice IPA."
"This is an enjoyable beer and probably underrated because of its english classification."
"D) A well crafted brew. I'd drink another."
"Pours a clear golden amber with an almost non-existant head. Smell is of candied fruits and a touch of caramel. Taste is a burst of watermellon up front, followed by a toffee and bread crust middle, and a flowery, spicy hop finish. Resinous hops cling to your toungue relentlessly. Mouthfeel is nice and rich, nice low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, but with the higher alcohol levels and the toungue clinging hops it's good for about one per drinking session. Other than those two negatives it's very good."
"Very drinkable. This goes down way fast. Would be a great summer IPA."
"Maybe a bit too carbonated for my liking. Nonetheless, drinks incredibly well for 7%."
"This is your typical IPA. It has a great taste, strong hoppy presence, a great label, which is what prompted me to buy it, and overall, a very good beer. This is my first brew from Left Hand, and it will probably not be my last. I was pleasantly surprised."
"Well carbonated. This is one of those beers that will make you burp, but force it through your nose and it's sweet grapefruit; really quite pleasing despite what you might think at first."
"Beer is medium in body and nice in the palate. The moderately sweet and moderately bitter, easy drinking and mild flavors. I'm not a huge EIPA fan, this one isn't too malty. I put it down quickly, I'd have it again. Not as heavy as some I've had."
"Pours a moderate copper color with a white head and a bit of lacing. The nose brings some light bready notes as well as some floral, earthy, and light citrus hops. The taste is mildly hoppy with a light caramel background. Feel is a bit bitter with a nice body. Not the best of the style that I've had, but pretty good."
"D- Mellow beer. If you are looking for something hoppy, this might be too mellow for you. Very easy to drink."
"D. As I said before, this was not as hoppy as I prefer my IPA's, but it was quite drinkable. Maybe it would have been better in a bottle as I have noticed some aggressively hoppy bottled beers are less hop forward on tap (like SNPA). Again, drink this one in the middle of summer all summer long and enjoy. A very palatable beer for beginners in the IPA world as well. Not a must drink for hopheads, but definitely a solid selection if faced with meager selection."
"Enjoyed at The Grill Next Door in Haverhill, MA this brew shows a straw amber color with a nice off-white head and good lacing. I find the aroma to be a very vague, maybe a slightly wheat/grass deal? Pretty disappointing for an introduction. It proves to be a medium-light bodied beer and the mouth feel follows suit, smooth with a little tingle. The flavor features a pretty unattractive leafy bite, and yes, I get the vegetable thing like everyone else. Seems to be an appropriate analogy, though thankfully a tolerably mild presence. I find this to be a pretty mediocre ale at best. It's drinkable enough if you're okay with the somewhat odd flavor. Worth a try if you like things that are a bit unusual, and it's a quality brew if the taste finds favor with you."
"D- good british style ipa with a heavier then normal malt profile, a mild hit of hops and a sustained med. Bitterness."
"I got 'the troops' version of the original english ipa style. Heavy on the watered down."
"Good for style and goes down easily. Balance is solid."
"This is a no-brainer - for me personally, I love hops and this left me a bit surprised - only based on the name (not quite as heavy-handed as I expected, but oh well - no biggie) because this is a highly sessionable - and would therefore be a big hit at gatherings. Worthy of a case..."
"D - Reasonably drinkable with a strong citrus hop character. The grapefruit bitterness is quite strong and is barely balanced by the sweet malt. Towards the finish, the malt intensifies with more toasted character and toffee. Not bad, but this really isn't dry enough for the style and while English hops are great in bitters, I prefer American hop character in my IPAs."
"Left Hand Brewing Company--400 Pound Monkey English-Style India Pale Ale 2010 12 oz. Bottle. 6.80% ABV. 45 IBU's? (3.25 / 5.0) Dense foamy lacy rich white head. Bottle Conditioned sediment, hazy soft amber gold color. Very mild not NW hop front. Creamy doughy bready mild sweet caramel BC fruit ester hint smooth malty body. Fruity English soft hop end. Sampled 10/31/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $10.75 @ Seattle, PCC--Greenlake on 7/21/2010."
"D: Actually decent drinkability and if I weren't expecting this to be a hoppy IPA, i'd be happy drinking a few, but overall - just a let down."
"Definitely a different style than the hop hammer IPA. Just as bitter in the aftertaste without the head-clearing aromatic hop blast of usual IPAs."
"Wouldnt drink again - anyone want some - i have 5 left"
"Nothing really special about this IPA, it's just very dull."
"My excitement, which was more like cautious optimism, that another IPA is now available to Iowans was short-lived. 400 Pound Monkey isn't bad beer, but bitterness isn't enough to bring this hophead back for another visit to the monkey house (Vonnegut reference)."
"I think this is delicious - a definite thirst quencher and great for a al fresco event in the sunshine. I also think 400 Pound Monkey achieves its goal of simulating an English-style IPA - I could definitely taste/place this in any of the many pubs I crawled in/out of throughout London this past April. Well done."
"d: Well balanced and on the dry side, I like it."
"T - English bitter hops evident; floral; bitter, non-citrucy afterbite harms finish"
"D - definitely a beer I could have more than a few of. Rather enjoyable."
"D: Very drinkable. I'd order another and buy six. Balanced enough to be a session beer, Hooray!"
"A touch restrained in the hop department, but the amount of hops matches the light malt and body that this beer has quite well; more hops would likely overwhelm the balance that this beer has. This is definitely an enjoyable and definitely hides its alcohol pretty well. Not my preferred type of IPA at all, but the balanced hop character that this beer achieves has me really enjoying it."
"I do not think I have had a bad beer from Left Hand Brewery maybe because I am left-handed it is subliminal. Pours a nice burnt orange color with a gentle white head. Smell of grainy malts and a mild sauvignon blanc like grassiness. Taste was divine. The hops held their own but did not overpower with off putting oily-ness. It was more of a fine biscuity quality with a hushed sweetness of the background malts. I just love this brew, not the typical hop slam most IPA's delivery which coat the tonuge in harsh bitterness. Cheers!"
"As I have read through the reviews of this brew, I have to agree with many of them in the sense that this brew is a great English IPA, but it borrows enough of the characteristics of the American IPAs to help make it a bit more drinkable."
"D- meh, this is a pretty forgettable IPA. probably wont seek this one out again. glad i didnt get the six pack."
"Drinkability is suprisingly high for a 6.7%er. Great disc golf course brew."
"pours light amber alomst copper in color. one finger head, quickly dissipates. smell is earthy light bitterness. moouthfeel is clean not leaving much behind. low IBU. well ballanced with hints of grapfruit and citrus. as to be expected with american hops. this is a great everyday IPA. 6.7%ABV drinks like a session beer though."
"Overall this was closer to an English IPA than I remember the last time I had this beer, although neither time have I been blown away. Still, a solid beer that I think benefits from the cask treatment and is worth a shot."
"400 Pound Monkey was a hazy golden amber color. It had a short white head with good retention and lacing. The smell was a good balance of sweet malt and English hops. The taste was hop dominant with a nice bitterness and dry finish. It was medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was good. This was a good beer and worth a try."
"Notes: Not a bad IPA, but it didn't really strike me as great. I wish some more of the biscuit malt would have come out. Decent English IPA that's worth a try."
"Thin off-white head on a slightly hazy amber body. Hop flavors are a little faded. Smooth and malty with good bitterness. Definitely some cooked vegetable qualities which are strongest and most off-putting in the aroma. The cooked vegetable aspect is getting stronger as the beer gets warmer."
"I just had this at a Left Hand event on campus (University of Cincinnati) in a flight with Sawtooth, Oktoberfest, Twin Peaks, Milk Stout, and whatever the name of the double sawtooth is. This may have been my least favorite, which is tough for me, with my love for hops. But, I was just continuously overwhelmed by the sense of broccoli. I got it in the nose, and it dominated the taste. It's a decent looking beer, that feels good and goes down easy, but being unable to escape the smell and taste of broccoli, I really didn't enjoy this beer too much."
"There it goes. Beautiful recovery, monkey. Edgy bitterness in the English vein, with a lasting, satisfying oily bitterness. None of the pine or citrus of its juiced up American cousins; just dry, herbal, alchohol tinged tastiness. A bit more powerful than the native versions of the style but after a decade sampling its muscular Yank relatives, I have to say I prefer this approach to the EIPA too. mouthfeel is thick and luxuriant. i really like this beer."
"Even for the dedicated hopsaholic, it is nice every once in a while to get back to the IPA roots and sample the style that started it all. Left Hand takes this beer straight down the middle with a quite authentic character. Nice, substantial malt with firm but not overdone hopping. The ABV is a bit higher than one would expect from the flavor. Overall, nicely done."
"Very drinkable, but could use some work."
"D - Moderate drinkability, tasty enough but not particularly memorable."
"Creamy feel, mild hop bitterness, earthy and floral character again. Somewhat buttery, not sure if that's really a hinderance or not. Seems to fade behind a dominant floral hop flavor, and biscuity malt. A little fruitiness would be a good compliment here, but there is none. Earthy aspirin briefly in the aftertaste, with more perfumy florals and mild bitterness. Overall it's good for what it is, but not one i'd seek out."
"If you like a different flavored IPA occasionally, this is a nice English IPA to try. Fairly one-dimensional it still an easy drinking interesting beer. If you're looking for a hoppy brew you won't find it here but if you want a different drinking experience from all the american IPA's, by all means give it a try."
"Likely the most delicious and most drinkable of Left Hand's hoppy beers. They have the tendency to go the English route on many of these, and this variety borrows just enough American IPA attributes to increase the drinkability without sacrificing the 'English' IPA soul."
"I like this brew. Most of the English IPAs that I get(at least three from Arcadia) have been, to me, lacking in hop flavor. When I see IPA I don't think PALE. Are there any bright hops in this one r is it all noble or european subtle-like hops? American or imported. I like how this one is lighter in body and texture closer to the LAgunitas IPA. Low alcohol makes it a good sessioner. Very complex and refreshing."
"A lot of bitterness on the flavor with a burnt biscuit, dark earthy malt presence. Hop flavor is herbal, but is not nearly as forward as many American style IPAs. Has a caramel sweetness to balance out the hoppy bitterness and provides plenty of flavor. Medium bodied and has ample carbonation. A pretty interesting take on the British IPA style, quite a bit going on here. Tasty, but all the flavors don't quite come together perfectly for me."
"Final Thoughts: All in all 2 thumbs up!!! Recommended!!"
"[ serving type: Chilled bottle poured into a glass]"
"A: There is a thin layer of head over the surface of the beer, minor lacing, color is medium straw - 3.50, S: There are strong smells of sweet grain as well as a floral/fruity hop aroma, very mildly solventy or sulfurish, also a touch of chalk in the depths of the nose - 3.00, T: The hop bitterness is quite assertive, the hops also provide a strong grassiness and earthiness to the palate, some mildly sweet grains and also some citrus which seems a little out of place for an English IPA though I certainly enjoy them, notes of biscuity-malt - 3.50, M: Mildly astringent, smooth mouth feel - 3.00, D: More hops than I generally expect out of an English IPA and I still question the hop build for the style, but beyond all of this it is a very drinkable beer and one I would recommend trying - 4.00"
"This is enjoyable and a nice, although not truely authentic english style ale. This is one of my favorite styles, so I appreciate the similarities as well as the differences. Glad to see breweries continue to push the envelope of their portfolios."
"Had this straight from the bottle the other night.Just really starting to get into the pale ales,this one seems sort of run of the mill. Slight carbonation and citrus taste, with a bitter finish that seemed to make me forget the initial flavour. Goes down smooth enough and seems to have improved taste when it warms to about 65 degrees. Probably worth a second shot."
"D: A very modest and drinkable monkey indeed."
"I think this is a good beer, but it doesn't taste like an Emglish IPA to me. This is AIPA all the way taste wise. The bitterness is a bit too pronounced compared to others in the style."
"D - Moderate to high considering the style and alcohol content."
"D- Overall, I enjoyed this offering from Left Hand and wouldn't mind drinking again. It is nothing out of the ordinary but a solid brew that is worth a try."
"Pours a light gold body with good head that left little lace and has a funky, sour citrus hop aroma to it w/ mild, bready like malts. Smooth and light to medium body with a bitter hop/citric hop taste that is subdued and balanced w/ a minor caramel and bread malt base. The flavors are balanced and subdued so nothing really pokes out but is very easy to drink beer and the ABV for such a pounder really surprises me. Def worth at least one try."
"D - was recommended by a co-worker and now I owe him one. English IPA's tend to be my fave and this one certainly doesn't disappoint."
"A nice, easy drinking english styled Ipa with some crisp finish and balanced mouthfeel with a fair amount of bitter finish."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I could knock back a couple of these, but probably no more."
"Drinkability is very good nice change from my usual IPA's might have to pick this one up on occasion."
"Would drink six in a row that's for sure...only bought one so I'm screwed."
"I dont get the monkey thing, was expecting some big crazy beer with the clever label, but ended up with just a pretty simple, solid beer. Everything about the beer is a light malt smell to a light bready taste to light finish, but very very drinkable for an almost 7% beer. This is one of the better Left Hand beers i've had."
"d- drinkability is good here, i'd have this beer again, this is my frist beer from left hand brewing compant, i think one day i'll just pick up the variety pack to try the regular lineup."
"D-It goes down easily enough, but there is not a lot here that makes me want to have another."
"Medium body, medium effervescence, warming on the palate. Pretty good but no stand out."
"Before sampling this IPA I tasted a Stone 14th Anniv. Emperial IPA and the freshness and smell were head and shoulders above the 400 Pound Monkey. It was a huge let down after sampling the Stone Emperial. Maybe it's not a fair comparison, but I was very disappointed in the taste of this IPA."
"Overall, I enjoyed it. It's not a beer I'm going to boast about to my friends to try. Will I buy another six pack or order it at a bar? No. But I'm disappointed I tried it either."
"I don't drink enough English IPAs to be able to say that it is or is not within that style, though I suspect it may be a bit stronger or hoppier than the style would prefer. But, it's a solid IPA, and I will come back to it with pleasure."
"D- Drinkable due to the smoothness and malted wheat that is used to make it... Cheers!"
" D- This beer has a nice aroma but no depth to the flavor. The hop bitterness is present and accounted for but there isn't any hop flavor or depth. Just a kick in the throat."
"D: Decent, glad I tried it. But nothing to write home about."
"D: Mild tasting and very drinkable."
"Bottle pours a hazed golden body with a small offwhite head that leaves some attractive sticky lace. Aroma is mostly citrusy hops that though a bit muted have a nice grapefruit, apricot and lemon presence. A hint of toasted caramel underneath. Medium body and carbonation. Taste has some apricot sweetness that is joined by bitter grassy hops and a biscuity malt character. A bit of caramel pushes the taste to the sweet side of the spectrum. Alcohol is hidden well. Finish is clean and even. Just enough hop bitterness to avoid cloying. I enjoyed this one quite a bit but the name doesn't really fit."
"Dark brown color with some cloudiness and a weak head. Good aroma and flavor. I'll probably have it again but not often."
"Overall - Nothing too special IMO, but not bad. I wouldn't go out of my way to find this one again, but I'll have to try an actual English IPA sometime to see how it compares to this one."
"Pours a pale yellow with a one finger white head. Good lacing and retention throughout. Minor sweet caramel aroma, a bit of citrus as well, very faint. Sweet bread and caramel malt to start. Earthy and strong pine hops hops kick in next which lead to a dry finish. Also faint alcohol notes. Decent flavor, but something is a little off. Mouthfeel is nice despite the dryness."
"OVERALL: A tasty, pumped-up version of an English IPA. If you like the style as well as bolder beers, then you'll like this. Very drinkable beer and quite enjoyable, just remember it's and English style India and not an American."
"extremely drinkable."
"The feel was sharp initially from generous carbonation. It was slick in the mouth and finished dry. The body wasn't lacking, yet it was very drinkable."
"The beer felt a little light for the style; I expected it to be a little more thick for a medium bodied beer. The beer had better than average drinkability. Overall, not a bad beer, but not a great one. I would defiantly drink again."
"D: I'll say it again; pretty easy to drink. Nothing mind blowing, but a decent, albeit different interpretation of an IPA. Not really for hop heads because it isn't up to that level of hops bitterness."
"This beer pours a hazy yellow-orange color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into rocky lacking that lasts a while. The aroma some tangerine and floral notes, but is very faint for an English IPA. The taste is somewhat stronger, but not much. There are is some tangerine, grapefruit, and a hint of flower, but it slides across the tongue and disappears. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that is a little too low, and a sticky texture that is very unappealing in an IPA. This beer is a real let down. It comes across as being very non-cohesive, and I think that is a extremely bad quality for a beer to have. I will not be drinking this again."
"D - This was just your average English IPA...a very grainy flavor where you would expect some sweetness"
"I really enjoy this beer."
"This beer is pretty much all over the place, balance is kooky but I enjoyed it overall."
"The feel of this beer is smooth as it goes down well and has a light to medium body to it. It is more balanced than expected but does have nice bitter aftertastes that last just long enough."
"It seems fairly balanced in the taste, but the malt and hops don't really play off one another. The go-between seems labored. A filmy finish allows the malt to control the beer and the hops just sort of fade to the background with only a touch of bitterness. This isn't bad, but the lack of smooth transition hurts it, imho."
"Pours a clear amber color with a medium head. Excellent head retention and some lacing. A damn nice looking beer. Unfortunately the aroma is not so good. Very weak and faint with only subtle leafy hops. The taste is a resinous hop bomb with plenty of pine notes. Very faint notes of caramel and bread in the finish. Medium carbonated bodied with a good hop Zing. Don't know if i'll get it again for $10 but not a ""Bad"" beer"
"A pale golden color pour with a two finger foamy whiye head , medium carbonation . Aroma is of earthy spicy hops and little else . Flavor is kind of a mess , same grassy and spicy hops as the aroma with kind of a netral malt backbone medium body, oily mouthfeel , short hoppy finish , light bitterness. Drinkable but just odd ."
"Mouthfeel was good, not too much carbonation and not too little. Wouldn't be able to drink more than two, had a very full flavor."
"Had a couple of ""eh"" beers from Left Hand, so I didn't know what I was in for. Now that I've had this and the Sawtooth in the past week, I'd say LH can do English ales well and I'd drink this particular beer anytime."
"This is enjoyable and fairly well english style. Not my favorite style, but I'd be ok having another. Light body with some dextrin presence and modest carbonation."
"This beer pours a bronze toned light amber color and has a nice frothy white head that sticks to the glass like crazy. The aroma is full of herbal and floral hops, as well as some lemon notes. It also carries a bit of grainy pale malt sweetness. The flavor is once again dominated by a mix of earthy herbal, floral and lemony hops that seem to be well blended. The malt character seems a bit off and is quite grainy. This beer may be a little bit too bitter for relatively small malt backbone I am detecting. In the finish there is a very interesting buttery, nutty sort of flavor that is quite nice. The body is on the lighter side of medium, and the mouthfeel is actually a little bit watery with a very dry finish. Quite drinkable and refreshing. Not too shabby."
"The monkey is one of those beers you're going to love or hate and it turns on it's present and full presentation of grassy citrus sharpness and how you dig that. It's color is nice with a quickly deminishing head, and it's aroma is pleasant with citrus. I'm not one for tartness or too much grassyness, so i didn't love the taste or the aftertaste that sticks with you for a few."
"Great example of an English IPA. Would make a stellar session brew if the ABV was slightly lower."
"D - I like this beer, but not something I would go out of my way to pick up again."
"D: Really a solid beer. Not an English IPA based on the flavor profile. Could fit as a hybrid English/American IPA, but the lack of malt character throws me off on this one. I'd like to try this again on tap to see if my review changes. With the plethora of IPA choices out there, I think I'll pass on this if I see it again at the store."
"Definitely a good drinker, but I probably couldn't session it very well. I'll be revisiting this one often."
"A beautiful, thoughtful beer - and also drinkable for ABV. Love it."
"Clear deep gold body, a finger and a half of lingering white creamy head, surprisingly minimal lacing, multiple streams of carbonation rising from bottom of glass. Nose is nicely balanced, sweetish malts, along with grassy and resiny hops. Taste is malt forward but with a significant grassy hop middle leading to a sweetish bitter finish. Light-medium mouthfeel, not sticky, with good effervescence. Pretty drinkable though I was surprised how noticeable the alcohol was. Not as hop aggressive as PNW and SD style IPAs, but a nice interpretation, attempt to create 'officer quality' EIPA. Worth a try, though I think the hops have faded a bit in this three month old bottle."
"Pours clear on the golden side of amber. Near white head, leaving typical fine lace and better looking extensive strands after a solid swig. Nice mixed citric/light malt nose. Easy drinking and enjoyable EIPA. Ample but toned down citric hops, riding upon a solid and smooth malty base. Nice job here by Left Hand"
"D: Easy and smooth to drink, not as hoppy as I hoped or typically drink, but overall a good IPA."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer that has enough flavor and substance to make it worth drinking for a long time."
"Drinkability: Definitely drinkable. I thought I hated IPAs, and I enjoyed this beer."
"Have encountered the aspirin astringency in IPAs relatively frequently as of late."
"drinkability - Little to hoppy for me, over all seems to be a good IPA"
"Pours from the bottle a nice medium golden color, with a good white head. Aromas of green apple, floral hops and earthy malt. On the palate I get some fruity pear, a little hay and the barest hint of malt. Medium bodied with a nice lingering bitterness."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Clear pale amber color. Nose is light grapefruit hops. Flavor is sweet grapefruit with a lingering hoppy aftertaste. $2.15 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"D. This beer was a little dry for my taste, but other than that is was good, and easy to drink."
"400 Pound Monkey has the look and flavor of a Maibock followed by the the feel of an IPA. It's too bland and metallic to recommend, but has a pretty good mouthfeel that makes it an enjoyable, if not remarkable, experience."
"A great beer that I got the chance to taste this brew at Oliver Twist when it first got in to Sweden. Its a great beer with nice top, foam sits for a moment to the go down in about 10. I can warmly recommend this one to everyone that likes a good EIPA."
"I wasn't blown away by 400-Pound Monkey by any means, but I rate to style and I consider this one of the best English IPAs I've ever had. This is a wonderful choice for when you want the lightness and refreshment of a pilsner but would also prefer the malt flavors of an English ale."
"D - Wow this was excellent. Tastes and drinks very well. 4.0"
"For something that's supposed to be striving for balance I don't find a whole lot of balance here. The metallic hop quality throws everything else off. This needs some work."
"D: For some reason I was expecting a powerful hoppy IPA, but this is much more true to the traditional English IPA (or even just an English Ale). It was really balanced and easy to drink, with more malt than hops. But I couldn't shake the thought that it tasted like a 2 year old American IPA (when in fact it was only 2 months old). Not bad, but I was disappointed."
"Overall this is an easy drinking IPA that would be easy to through back a few of....if only the hops profile was changed a bit."
"Had again on cask at Fallen Rock, and the same rating though a bit odd bitterness."
"Reminds me of the English beers that first drew me into beer drinking, though more hoppy. Good beer."
"I'd like to try other things from Left Hand because it seems like this was brewed nicely and tasted very fresh for what it was, just not my favorite style."
"Overall, not really even worth trying."
"Overall a fine IPA. I'm used to American-style IPAs, so this is a nice diversion."
"It poured a nice dark orange a good sized (two finger head). The auroma has a strong hops presence with very strong malts as well. The malts were the thing that stood out the most in this beer, but the hops were soon to follow. I was pretty surprised by how forward the malts were in this ipa but it balanced very well. It has a pretty full body with a nice alcohol burn. This beer is very drinkable, infact I wish I had another to drink right now."
"Lite Amber color with a small white head. Not much of a taste to talk about. Was disappointed after reading a lot of good things about Lefthand brewing. It was also my first go at an English style IPA and honestly it was like drinking a Bud Lite! I'll give the English style another shot, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
"d - A decent beer. I thought there was a weird mustiness to the smell that kind of hurt it, but the taste was some solid, balanced hops and malts. Would try again."
"D - A pretty drinkable offering overall. Not mindblowing, but I'd drink it again"
"Bought at R and R Stations in Marion"
"It's unreached potential makes it seem worse than it is."
"Subtle, but punchy in all the right places, Left Hand chose a somewhat over-looked style and ended up with a tasty but not over-the-top experience that's hard to find too much fault with."
"Tastes like a combination of the aforementioned aromas only more beery. Starts off with a rustic, thick barley that's similar Sam Adam's. The middle is very thick but still somehow light and fruity, and it finishes off on a blend of very dry european hops and a chewy, bready yeast note. Solid combination, all very nicely balanced."
"Medium body with ample carbonation, little alcohol heat. Combined with the flavor it makes for a very drinkable beer. I'd have it again, but wish it was tweaked."
"Drinkability? Another brew that I can't get into because of the lack of harmony with the flavours. 1 bottle and I'm done. For good."
"The balance seems perfect, and I could easily see this being a go-to beer for me if I didn't have to drive out of state to get it. Fortunately I have five bottles left."
"Bright golden color with a 1/2 inch white head that fell relatively quickly, but there was some nice rings of lacing left down the Sam Adams perfect pint. Herbal, grassy, and orange hop aromas jump out first, followed by a semi-sweet cracker, toasty bread maltiness. Nice balance in the nose, and if this is any indication of the taste, I'll be pleasantly surprised. Yep, great balance here. I'm really digging the lightly toasted cracker, biscuit-like maltiness of this brew which is in perfect harmony with the lightly bitter, herbal hops, that have just a touch of citrus on the back end, namely some orange marmalade-like juiciness. Drys out on the finish, with a decent, bitter aftertaste. Body is crisp with the perfect amount of carbonation. This is a tasty beer, and I really do love the balance. I really wish I could find an English bitter or mild pale with this kind of flavor on a regular basis. If this thing weighed in at 5% ABV or less, it would be one of the best session brews around. But I'm really digging it the way it is. Not sure why the scores are so low on this one. I think it's a very well-made English IPA, and a much needed break from the often over-the-top AIPAs."
"This is easy to drink but not my favorite style."
"D: Very drinkable and very moderate abv make it a very good seeions beer."
"CHEERS!!"
" goes down super easy atruly nice beer!"
"Cheers."
"Overall, a really good beer that breaks away from the current trend of citrusy American IPAs. Great balance of malt and hop make this beer highly drinkable."
"D: Great to sip on, a nice offering from Left Hand. Not to mention a really cool label."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability: highly drinkable. Possibly a little too drinkable for its ABV, but overall quite a nice package."
"Not crazy about the cracker-like character. It lands between ""English"" and ""American. It does have a ""hoppy"" character to it. It's an interesting brew."
"400 Pound Monkey isn't no ape, but its still got some weight to it and if it were anymore English IPA styled it would be made in England. Solid and drinkable... a monkey could have 400 of these?"
"D: Average"
"Drinkability: I could and would drink this if I had to, but I'm glad I only bought a single. I love a bitter IPA, but not bitterness without good hops flavor. This one needs some work."
"Overall very accurate in English IPA style with the hops more subdued and very balanced for an IPA. A Good Drink."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear gold with a finger of white head. Restrained hop aroma with some caramel malt. Definitely more on the malty side. Light to medium bodied. More caramel malt. Hops are pretty subtle but show up with some drying in the finish. The first bottle of the six I drank almost seemed infected, but the others were better. Didn't seem that English to me. I expect more of a soft fruitiness from the yeast."
"D= A decent IPA and when reviewing I wanted to keep in mind that this is the English style rather than the American. I however found this beer to be a mix of the two sort of. There was a lot of piney citrus hops as well as some of the earthy spicy hops you find in an English IPA. Decent but a little off style."
"D: I'm glad I only got a single."
"D - Very easy drinking. Smooth and sweet - ABV is pretty potent, but well hidden. Perhaps on the low side for the style. Not filling. Flavors are not overwhelming - but this much bitterness can get to you in a session."
"M/D: Good mouth feel, slightly dry. I couldn't get much from this beer, it seemed a little bland. Maybe the composition was to balanced, that nothing really stuck out."
"Overall I was disappointed with this English IPA as it did not resemble one at all. There are WAY better beers out there which do this style justice than this one. One example is ""Meantime IPA", try that instead of wasting your money on this Monkey."
"Easy enough IPA to drink, and there are certain aspects to this one that make it interesting."
"A 12 ounce bottle picked up at Abe's in my mixed sixer. Bottled 3-10-10. Uncapped and poured into my shaker glass. The pour yields an ultra clear golden ale with about a finger or two of quickly fading off white foam. The head does leave a respectable lace in its wake. The aromas and flavors consist of toasted bread, bread, and more bread, caramel malts, citrus-y lemon, a bit of dank skunkiness. Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Pretty clean drinking. Not bad overall. Give it a shot if ya dig an English IPA."
"D: this is easy drinking and the abv is undetectable. Lots of nice things going on but it leans heavily to the malts"
"pours a crystal clear golden yellow color with almost no head and very lite carbonation. there was a very vague hop flavor and smell nothing great. i must say i wasn't impressed with this beer at all. let down would probably be a better term. to me this beer tasted very ""miller liteish"". it was just a very dull beer."
"D: A pretty good brew and not what I was expecting with the fruity notes leading the way."
"D: Drinkability was good, light bodied with a decent level of hoppiness, and worthy of a six-pack purchase."
"D - A good session IPA...for those that prefer their IPA's balanced/maltier, this is a good example. If you lean towards the big citrusy, hoppy west coast IPA's, you'll probably be left wanting more. I could easily drink a couple more of these, but probably would choose something else if other options are available."
"A grainy taste comes through and finishes with an astringent bitterness that I can live with. I can't get past the burnt popcorn aspect of the taste. It just seems like something's wrong to me. Or maybe it's just bad beer. I had little inspiration to finish the glass. Disappointing."
"Body seems slick, and was lighter than I was expecting. Not bad, but all told seemed a bit unbalanced."
"Overall: Good beer, not quite like Stone's Cali-Belgique, but a rather enjoyable brew."
"Slainte."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I am not sure of the date of this, it could be better if fresh."
"D: Good on a hot day and feels much smaller than nearly seven percent. It nearly daces on the tongue and feels light enough to be sessionable even though it doesn't even come close. An interesting beer, but really not my style. Good on a hot day and after cooking a large meal, but other than that a little ho-hum."
"This is certainly a boldly different take on the IPA. The high ABV and sweet mouthfeel make this one good for only a couple."
"This is a well balanced IPA. It starts with a soft, dry, mildly grainy malt flavor. In the swallow and aftertaste, the hop takes over and dominates with a peppery spice. The body is similar to skim milk; the carbonation is below average giving it a thicker mouthfeel."
"Nice level of carbonation at first, btu teh carbonation really dies out towards the end of the brew."
"D: Good drinkability coupled with an interesting complexity as the Monkey warms."
"Little below a finger's worth of bleached white foam, enough larger bubbles interspersed to create some dimpling and hamper retention, decently thick lacing though. Light orangish-yellow hue with some gauziness, only a few bubbles seem to move within the liquid. Lemon and orange citrus upfront in the nose, sourdough and black bread notes, peppery, green and herbaceous hops, in spite of this above average concentration in the apricot, nectarine fruit scents. Medium-bodied, dry and almost grainy in texture, pumpernickel and rye, hops have plenty of edge and nervosity, only offer traces of citrus, pine or florality. The malts hard to discern, perhaps cocoa powder evident. Carbonation tries to add some fluffiness and diminish the bite of the hops, this to middling success. Not sure what was supposed to go on here or if it was achieved."
"A bit sweet, not quite as bitter as one would expect, and somewhat hot from the alcohol. Not a complete failure, but not something I'd drink again, either."
"Poured a very pale golden color (more ""lager"" than ""pale ale"") with a bit of decent initial head, and no lacing. Some slight bitterness in the noes with a little malt sweetness. Huge grapefruit flavor from the hops, with a decent bitter aftertaste; some nice malt body, but not well balanced between the hops and with the hops and malts. Goes down fairly smooth, but only an average IPA."
"D- not a fan of this one just seems kinda boring overall more like a plain jane run of the mill american ipa to me than a real try at a english variant. I know it's belgian but I think flying dog's raging bitch was a much better example a of euro ipa that actually was significantly different from most of its American counterparts."
"Had a bottle at Liberty St. Tavern. I guess this makes more sense at an English IPA, though it's strong in alcohol for the style. I get that they're going for an IPA with a relative balance of malt flavor, but their isn't enough of either - hops or barley - to make an amazing beer. I mean the hops have an oaky citrus character and the grains just gave off a dry biscuit taste. Not a bad beer. It was clean, but it didn't have much in common with great English IPA's."
"A decent American version of an English pale ale. Hops have too broad of a presence; and the malt lacks some of the biscuit fruitiness that I would normally expect from a traditional English brew. That said, this is a relatively balanced session brew and certainly worth a try."
"overall i doubt i ever buy this again - love the name and bottle label but i think next time i will save myself 2bucks and buy some NB Ranger if i am in the mood for a lighter IPA"
"Pours a crystal clear toasted grain color with a thin wispy white head that left some clingy lacing on the glass. Not much hop aroma but I do pick up some bready caramel malt, light butter. A light floral grassy hop mixes with a fairly substantial malt presence. It has tea like flavors with a slighty fruity notes. Some toasted malt characteristics as well; finishes with a hoppy bitterness. Moderate to well bodied but has fizzy carbonation which helps the drinkability in my book. Definitely an EIPA, Left Hand seems to nail the malt flavors. I would like to see a touch more hop flavor just to remind me that this is an IPA. It is an enjoyable brew, can't complain."
"If I could change this beer, I'd make it bigger, but maybe it's just the day."
"12oz bottle with an indescribably cool label. The beer is medium-dark copper color, clear with a thick spitty head that laces in clumps. Seeing as it's called an Enligh IPA I knew to expect muted hops and ramped up biscuit. Neither of these exactly present themselves in the beer. The hops are more present than usual for the style, citrus and uncharacteristically bitter. I didn't get any biscuit or toast either. The body is sorta viscous too, I don't know how to rate this at all. I like the beer, but it doesn't seem right for the style."
"Kind of a let down. The malts are way to thin, and the mineral flavor really hurts. Not the worst thing ever, but this will probably be my only six pack."
"The mouthfeel is rough at first and doesn't compliment the beer, but eventually I either get used to it or the alcohol numbs the rawness. Good news I get a residual hop flavor after each burp following this beer. Not a fan."
"Recommended! It's not going to be the beer of choice for someone craving something like Blind Pig or Odell IPA, but more of someone looking for a punchier London Pride or ESB."
"Overall Impression: It's a pretty good English IPA. It's more floral and less citrusy as compared to American IPA's. Certainly worth checking out."
"Pours a yellow-orangish color with a thin white head that dissipates fairly quickly. The smell has some biscuity malt notes, as well as some floral and tea like hops, a touch of caramel and a hint of alcohol. The flavor has some maltiness up front (biscuit and hay like) followed by some classic english hop character (floral, earthy and tea-like) as well as some alcohol. The mouthfeel is appropriately light and drinkability is good. Overall a solid but unspectacular EIPA."
"D: Just okay. It was a nice attempt it just don't come together perfectly."
"Very drinkable and suprisngly bitter EIPA. I normally highly prefer AIPA's over EIPA'S but this is one I'd be willing to give another go, that is if I could get it regularly. Too bad I only got one ;)"
"The taste is just a bit thin. There is a slightly leafy hop presence, maybe some floral hop sweetness, but for the most part the hop is not really juicy and estery. The nose is not indicative of the taste. The underneath is a tad bit bready and doughy, but just overall too thin. There isn't the caramel malt, the touch of diacetyl, and pricklishiness that is often found with an EIPA. What we have here is a very thin American IPA, with not enough hop burst to make the grade there either. This beer is light and easy to drink, its tasty enough and completely inoffensive. I was hoping for more."
"Copper clear appearance bright white head, forms fine coated lacing between sips. Aroma has nice citric, earthy, and herbal hop going on. Light caramel malt sweetness with fresh baked bread accents. Flavors provide enough bitterness and hop flavor to make for a tasty experience. Really earthy and herbal hop flavors leaves a dry leafy tea like note on the palate. A definite English IPA with a bit more hops I like the different approach this brew takes. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample soft carbonation and dry bitterness left behind leaves the palate feeling like a desert. Drinkability overall is solid a brew I'm down with trying again and again. I will continue to try Left Hand offerings a great brewery that I tend to dig more and more with each new beer they produce."
"Drinkability: I like the body of this beer, but what kills it for me is a medicinal/bitter alcohol aftertaste that lingers in my mouth. This is very dry and the hops are not overboard. I do like the brewery but I am not likely to get this one again."
"When poured into a pint glass, the body looked a shade paler than the typical IPA amber, but the clarity and one finger thick head still made it quite nice to behold. The smell was very floral and timid, making it seem more like an APA than IPA. The taste was pleasing, but lacked that bitter punch I like. Instead I got more of a balanced approach with a bit of soapy bitterness. The body was medium thick and a little sticky, and the beer was very easy to drink. Maybe a n nit too easy. Could stand to be buffed a bit more."
"Overall, a good beer and good for the style. Recommend if you can easily get. Rotation - my buddy shipped me one from CO. I think we are going to get it here in TX soon. The beer is good but this isn't one of my go to styles so don't see this making the rotation. [Nsb]"
"Not my favorite IPA, but very drinkable. I'd prefer a bit more hoppier, sweet and balanced. It's refreshing and will go well with the summer heat."
"D- I didn't see anything special about this after my first bottle, but as I pair it with my traditional fare (pizza and popcorn, etc.) I find it really does have a place in my drinking lineup as a competitor to New Belgium's Hoptober, which is only competition in the fall. Not really an English IPA IMO"
"D: Its alright. I could have more but am glad i just went with the single bottle"
"Overall, would go for it again at a bar or a picnic, but wouldn't go out of my way to find it in a store."
"D- A unique, American take on the style that is rather enjoyable and goes down nicely."
"12 oz. bottle served at 50 degrees in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a translucent gold with a frothy, loose two-inch off-white head. Head eventually settles into a bubbly, fairly consistent cap with some spots and strands of lacing exposed during the tasting. Subdued nose - some bittering hops followed by a mild caramel/bready quality. Taste consistent with nose - starts off slightly bitter with a touch of acidity, followed by a peppery/spicy quality in the middle, a hint of caramel appears towards the finish, before culminating in a lightly lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an assertive carbonation level that is slightly prickly across the middle of the tongue and at the back of the throat. Decent brew for the style; however, not my favorite offering from this brewer. Nonetheless well worth trying if you get the opportunity. I'd would like to give this one a try on draft though."
"Drinkability: good drinkability overall."
"Overall, a fine offering, very much in the English style-Subdued, subtle flavors nicely balanced and full of character, nothing over-the-top, just a pleasant, drinkable brew."
"Overall, a very well made, smooth beer. All of the elements are there, without the extreme hop piece in there. Well balanced, smooth and drinkable. A refreshing change from those overdone IPA hop monsters we see now. Another winner from Left hand."
"good beer."
"lots of people will not like this one, as it's not a ""hop-bomb"" IPA. But its a solid brew for what it is, providing a simple, drinkable, balanced IPA. reminds me a bit of Harpoon's IPA with a better, stronger malt backbone."
"Drink-ability: A good enjoyable alternative to the increasingly popular American IPA. Left Hand is to be commended for their exploration into the more subtle, balanced flavors of an English IPA."
"A nice, refreshing IPA. It is a change of pace if one is used to hop forward, citrusy, or piney American versions. A more subtle hop profile I would say, hitting the herbal and earthy notes. I liked it better cold as it lost some of its fresh hoppiness and the malts came through a bit more when warmed."
"Decent drinker. Easily sessionable for a near 7%'er."
"F: Finishes a little dry and the bitterness catches up to it. The spicy earthy hop flavors stick around, but not too long, but the bitterness lingers. That weird flavor is still there very faint on the finish. It seems to go away more as I drink more though as my taste buds seem to get used to it."
"400 Pound Monkey is a decent recipe that uses malted wheat alongside the barley. A pleasant drinking ale, overpriced in Ohio, but worth the expense for the initial experience. I would be hesitant to purchase another six-pack. In this price range, there are plenty of exciting alternatives."
"Drinks easy, I actually prefer the bottled version of this tracks closer to style for me..."
"Strange name. Very balanced, easy-going beer."
"I always like trying new hops, and the Boadicea hops used in this beer definitely have some unique and tasty qualities. However, they leave something to be desired when used alone. I think they could really be a gem if used in a blend."
"mouthfeel is alright. a little overcarbed for my tastes. to me this isn't a very drinkable beer. just makes me start thinking about what else i have in the fridge."
"D: I don't want another. Hell, I don't want to finish this one. The more I sip, I get a salty aftertaste. This beer is completely mundane and not at all what I expect from Left Hand."
"Exceptionally find addition to Left Hand portfolio, these guys make some great brew. Would highly recommend this beer to anyone in search of a modern day English IPA with above average qualities, eminently drinkable & grows on you sip after sip."
"This beer is very very drinkable. I highly suggest this to any beer lover."
"Pours a clear, gold/copper color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, hops, and citrus (pineapple). Fits the style of an English IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hops, citrus, yeast, slight grain, and slight herbs. Overall, a good blend, refreshing, and a slight taste reminiscent of soda syrup."
"A refreshing sessionable beer that gives no clue to the drinker of its moderate alcahol content. Fool your friends!"
"The beer pours a very clear orangish-yellow with a large white head. The aroma ia citrus hops, mainly orange with some floral hops as well. The flavor is not too great, with biscuit malt and some muddled hop flavors. The hop flavors are a combination of citrus, resin, grass and maybe some pine, but nothing shines or stands out. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Overall, a disappointing beer."
"Verdict: Easily drinkable and mild throughout, 400 Pound Monkey is friendly-enough, though rather forgettable. I get the whole 'sessionable English-style IPA instead of another faceless hoppy IPA' theme they were going for, but they may have gone a little too mild here."
"Still, a very drinkable beer and may even be better paired with some foods than an American IPA."
"Overall, it has a surprising amount of bitterness, but I didn't care for the toasted biscuit or the charred grassy bitterness."
"Toasted grains and minty hop bitterness up front. Toasted biscuit malt comes on with rising herbal and grassy hop bitterness. A flash of candyish toffee sweetness before orange marmalade and mineral water bitterness in the finish. Lingering toasted malt with citrus accents. Not bad. Medium-bodied with a slightly oily feel. Might be a bit nicer on cask."
"Tasty, but nothing that jumps out at me. To be fair, I recently had a Hopslam and a Burton Baton so guess the bar's been raised."
"D: This is a nice English IPA overall. The metallic flavors near the finish and the overly fizz body were the only weak points. I'm glad I picked it up."
"drinkability: refreshing and a very good example of a british style ipa. well masked alchohol, just a little too carbonated."
"Overall, just okay. I was hoping to find a sessionable IPA. If this is on cask at the brewery I will certainly give it a try."
"The more I drank I noticed a real buttery flavor from the yeast strain used,not to bad though."
"D - a little muddled and a little light on the hops for me, but drinkable."
"An earthy and bitter hoppyness hit first followed by a mixture of a light and toffee like malt. The hops also carry a kind of veggie taste. This completely separate hop profile feels layered on top of the malt in the way I taste it. That being said the flavor isn't horrible but the whole beer feels like a one off, maybe not carried all the way through. The mouth feel is too watery and the flavors are good, just in the wrong places, IMHO."
"For many people, this will be a huge turnoff, in fact, I remain skeptical of this beer's prospects for commercial success. But if beer drinkers can open their minds a bit and appreciate that there is more than one way to do things, they just might find that 400LB Monkey is a hell of a beer and more than deserving of their attention."
"Poured this pale amber colored beer into a pint glass. The head that foamed from the pour was at about 3/4 of an inch. The smell is that of hops and citrus. The taste is that of a hops but at the tail end of the taste there is a bitter citrus flavor. Overall not one of Left Hands better brews."
"Pours a clear, light golden brown color body. Big frothy off-white head. Very citrusy hoppy aroma, very green. Dry alcoholy taste. Very dry tasting. Green taste. Bitter, puckering. Letting it warm up a bit. Almost like a nutty hoppiness. Almost earthy. Still too dry and bitter, not so tasty, but better."
"Overall, this is a boring watery ipa with not much flavor."
"Left hand has never disappointed me before, this was a first and a surprise."
"Notes: Good IPA to me. I found it to be much more drinkable than many others out there."
"D- good drinkability alcohol wise, but too much carbonation."
"Drinkability suffers (unless you're eating mac and cheese, in which case you've found your perfect beer)!"
"Pours a pretty clear amber with a fine bubbled off-white head. Aroma is not strong but hoppy and inviting. Flavor is strongly hoppy and fairly but not overly bitter and has whispers of citrus and sweetness. Texture is rough, lively and sassy, leaving a tingly and hoppy finish."
"D- I finished up the last half of my glass quickly just to get it out of the way, I just did not care for this. I'm left handed and i've yet to be impressed by anything from left hand brewing."
"Drinkability: Overall, a decent brew to drink; it's hop-forward, certainly, but not overbearing and could pair with a wide variety of foods. I opted for Taco Mac's Smothered Kettle Chips. I and other previous reviewers agree that the name is a bit misleading -- it's less a palate-ravaging 400lb Monkey as it is a Curious George. Ah, that lovable lil' scamp."
"D - Pretty good. I describe this as a ""Lite"" IPA...not much flavor and very light bodied."
"Definitely would have this again."
"D: I opened up the gullet with each gulp and it seemed to make it down down a bit easier"
"Drinkability: If you're a masochist, this brew may be for you. But a particular brand of masochist, really. The kind that likes to chew on pine cones. Yes. That's what it's like. I didn't find it unpleasant at first, but after a while, it was just too intense, too green, too leafy, too prickly, and too spicy. I can see this being some people's bag - it just wasn't, however, mine."
"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Poured a dark golden with a decent head that left some scant lacing and faded to a thin cap. Smells quite piney and with some firm malt. Rich and balanced. The taste is similar. I won't say this is blow-you-away hoppy, even though with a name like 400 lb monkey you might expect it to be. What it is is very well balanced, with more firm malt in the backbone and lots of piney and citrusy hops. Deftly done. A bit full in the mouth, this is even a bit chewy and a fair pleasure to drink."
"D: Well, as far as IPA standards, this beer really doesn't add up in my eyes. It is malt dominant and the hops are basically an afterthought. Makes things kind of wierd. With that said, it is an easy drinker although it doesn't bite the hell out of you hops. It goes down easy and sits nicely. Has a great quenching ability although it is sweet (very light to medium sweetness overall, nothing too crazy or cloying), and really is refreshing. Can't win em all. This beer doesn't fully succeed but it also doesn't completely fail."
"The fine folks at Left Hand made the mistake of giving this very nice IPA a name that suggests a bigger beer than this is.... it conjures up images of something big, and delivers instead something good and tasty."
"I am a big fan of the IPAs and this one was pretty typical of that style. Nice deep orange color with a nice head. Like most IPAs you could smell a little pine and citrus. Nice hop balance and good body. Good but not a standout it. Worth trying if you come across is. Left Hand does good work."
"400 lb. Monkey is a little disappointing. I was hoping for a standout IPA, but instead got a nicely balanced IPA that doesn't stand out in any way at all. It wouldn't be hard to improve. Just add more hops. Its balance is its biggest weakness. I guess there might be some out there who prefer balanced IPAs, but I want hop pizzazz in the hop department. Other than that, a little more strength in the nose would also help. Meh. It's above average, but could be better. Definitely worth a try, but I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to track it down. It's a lamb cloaked with a beast's name. Let's not indulge in gratuitous, erroneous nomenclature, guys. There's no need."
"Had this on-tap at the Newstead public house. Poured into pint glass slightly chilled producing a nicely filtered golden color, very clear with a thick head that lasted quite a while. Nose was quite good full hops, sweetness, floral notes in the background. Taste was of the same, not an overly powerful brew of the style but certainly has a great taste with decent mouthfeel, moderate amount of bitterness in the middle but nothing that will kill the palate. A nice beer overall and will be glad to go back and have another soon."
"*Taster's Note: On tap at the 2nd Annual McNellie's (Blue Dome) Microbrew Festival."
"D - Not the best IPA. The bartender admitted that it tasted much better earlier when he tried it in Colorado."
"This seemed more English in style to me. It wasn't bad but I have certainly had better IPAs. The flavor seemed rather bland though it was not bad by any means. I wouldn't fully recommend it myself but my buddy enjoyed it a lot."
"This beer has a nice medium amber-orange hue to it with nice lacing and a good head. Expected the beer to be a lit ""bigger"" becuase of its name. I was told it was a double IPA and it did not seem to have the smeel or tast of large overhoppiness. The pininess of the hops were present, but not overpowering It could be that it was very well balanced. It can be easily drank and enjoyed, however I would not put it in the same catagory as either Racer X or Breckenridge 471."
"Not sure about the name but it's a pretty decent IPA."
" I had this on tap at brouwers and ordered it because I had not seen it ever before. I imagine they will start marketing this one and throw it in catchy, cool looking bottles if they have not already. It is easy drinking and it looks great. As taste goes it was boring. Especially to be sending over here to the northwest, were we have tons of IPAs with lots of character. CHEERS"
"For IPA/PA purists, this is not your beer, but a tasty one ta' boot. Lets hope that the monkey's 500 pound hairy sister has more hops."
