"Alc. 5,6% vol."
"My local grocery outlet keeps popping up with belhaven brew and I'm not gonna complain. So far i love this brewery. It pours a clear amber colour and white head that quickly dissipates. The bottle I poured it from (into glass of course) had a spider Web effect of bubbles inside that I don't see to often so I expected some lacing on the mug. Very hoppy aroma had me assuming that it would taste like a U.S. west coast IPA but I was surprised that the hoppiness didn't come across strong in the taste. Earthy, grassy, slighty citrus has me loving this beer. Goes down smooth, real nice."

"Overall, this was a nicely authentic English IPA.  We haven’t had one in a while, but still felt it a little light in flavoring.  It was hard to separate brewer’s intent and drive for authenticity from presentation at this particular establishment.  We never found it to be skunky, per se, but it did have that dingy English pub vibe through and through.  The hopping was there, and surprisingly piney, while the malts were washed and simplistic, but clean in their body.  This was enjoyed in the company of new friends who we had been meeting here, and it served its purpose as a nicely sociable, approachable beverage, without becoming overwhelming time-consuming or attention-diverting."

"As an IPA this gets a zero because it does not smell, taste or drink like an IPA in the slightest. However, it drinks smells and tastes like one of the best scotch ales I've ever had. Delicious, but not what I expected."
"Very little hop aroma. Fairly flat with minimal bitterness."
"Drain pour. Poured from a clear bottle. Pale in color. What little flaovior this beer had, was off-putting. A lot skunky."
"Smells like and looks like a Budweiser.  Not a fan of the aftertaste either."

"Bachelor Party-Palooza 2014 (Part 1) believes that when in a Scottish-style pub, do as the Scots do and drink up some Belhaven, namely the Twisted Thistle IPA.  This stuff pours a clear brass-amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam.  The nose comprises pine sap, grass, light flowers, caramel, toasted toffee, and mild biscuit.  The taste brings in more of the same, the pine leaning toward a resinous needle character.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a pretty nice IPA, though the resin is a touch much.  Still, the rich malt backbone helps to balance this out a bit.  This did work nicely with my chicken club, though..."

"A very nice beer. Despite strong finish, still nicely enjoyable."
""
""
"On tap at St. Andrews in NYC. Pours amber with white head. nose is of stale malt and spoiled apple juice. Body is medium and crisp. Earthy hops, caramel and biscuit malt and ripe fruit combine on the palate. Finish is long, dry and earthy. Overall this is good brew that I would drink again."
""
""

"Great malt character, interesting hop character."
""
""

""
""
"O -- This is a very nice change-of-pace from the hop-bomb IPAs and the somewhat staid English IPAs. Making its own statement with its local take on a style."
""
""
"Clear amber pour with just a hint of red and a thick head with an excellent lasting lacing. Nice nose of light pine hops, mostly spruce but also a floral note, over a slightly sweet malt background. The body is on the high end of medium with just the right level of carbonation. Mouthfeel is smooth and just shy of slick. The flavor profile is quite nice and complex. It begins with caramel sweetness over a light spruce hop flavor, effervesces into a light bitterness with floral notes and finishes a bit tart. The finish itself is a blend of caramel sweetness and hop earthiness that lingers against a light bitterness over a background tartness. An outstanding ""twist"" on an IPA."

"If you ask me, Twisted Thistle may be one of the most underrated IPAs out there (and this coming from someone who has a thing for cutting up diluted English exports). It may not have gum-branding acidity or palate-encrusting resins, but its soft florals and leafy green qualities are every bit as impressionable (and arguably a lot more agreeable too). Recommended."

"Pours a deep good with dense micro bubbles formed on top. Nice was retention and lots of lacing. Nose is non descript with mild notes of bready grain, light earthy hops, some caramel. Taste is smooth and light in the flavor department. Light hop bitterness paired with mild caramel. Mouthfeel is the only place this beer excels, very smooth and somewhat creamy. Overall, an easy drinker for sure but relatively absent of flavor for an IPA."

"It poured well, and looked fine--no problems there. And I fell bad for dunning the brewery, but if they're going to package in clear glass, they have to be prepared for what that does to their product. I'd try it on cask at some point to see the difference, but the bottled version ought to be avoided."
""
"OVERVIEW - I didn't care for it. It was just okay. Also in a clear bottle? I found it boring. I was expecting something more exciting!! like Lakefront IPA or Singlecut IPA"
"this isnt the typical IPA, but it is good. not that i like the IPA style. as i drink more i am more aware of the bitterness and it is more prevalent in my mind and mouth than the sweet maltiness i tasted on my first sip. while not my favorite style, i fully respect what they have done with this. 'mouthfeel' wasnt special for me, it seemed kind of 'regular' but the color is beautiful, smell was provocative and different than i was expecting and so was the taste. for me, my ratings are accurate of how i feel about this one...."

"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, slight citrus, and some earthy and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly smoky flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I think it smells better than it tastes."

"thick creamy mouthfeel with a smooth finish. tasty twist on the style. I was not expecting to like this beer when i first looked at the bottle, and was very surprised. Always keeping my eye out in the off chance i have the ability to try it again"
"Overall I don't think I will seek it out again. Seems to take like most IPA's that are around 1 or 2 bucks a bottle (yet this one was 4 bucks) Still worth a try since it was on my tick list. Heck even shipped from Scotland it had less sediment than most American offerings (fresher bottle)..."

"Poured from the glass into a snifter, the beer was almost mauve in color. Incidently, I bet there are not many reviews with the color description of ""mauve"" on BA. There was a high level of sediment in the bottom of the glass. The thistle, which my assumption of the contents of the sediment, looked like yardwaste. Despite these oddities, the beer gets better. A heavy floral aroma leaps from the glass. The thistle is apparent. The initial taste is malty and mildly hops. The hops do not overwhelm, making this seem as though it is not a real IPA. The floral effects from the thistle stand out, giving the beer a tea-like quality. A note of lemon reinforces the tea hints, giving the impression of Lipton Tea with lemon. The flowery citrus hints continue in the aftertaste with the tartness of tea lingering. I am not sure I would need to drink this again, but it is a unique experience."
""
""
""
"The bitterness overpowers the malt character her. The malt comes across as one-dimensional: it's sweet caramel. the hops are bitter, piney, and even a bit resinous. Some balance I think would helo here. Nonetheless, it's drinkable, and smooth. It's a classic so it's worth a try."
""
""
"O- Dominanted by the herbs. A struggle to drink."
"Had this beer on-tap at a new British restaurant in DC. It wasn't all that good, but it was on happy-hour special so I ended up having two. It was a tad sweet for my taste, and had some kind of sour-y/sweet sugar thing that I couldn't quite put my finger on. It was like ""prickly"" or something. I suppose it's name is fitting!"

"Overall: I am a huge fan of pale ales, this one, unfortunatly, did nothing but disappoint me. The other beers in the same batch, that were dated the same, in the case at the store had what looked like orange peels floating in them. This beers was the cleanest looking of them all that day, and I wanted to try an new IPA. The bottle cap was secure like it should have been and was not a twist off. So I'm not sure if this was a bad batch or what. I also noticed that the picture displayed here shows a brown bottle, the one I had was clear. Perhaps I will revisit this brew in the future."

"Overall - this made me think more highly of IPA's for now. I might give them another shot"
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a creamy off white head. The bottle is clear, so worries of skunkiness are present. Luckily my worries were unfounded, as the beer possesses a wonderfull tropical fruit aroma. Taste begins with passion fruit and mango, followed by a rich caramel, bready middle, and a nice bitter grapefruit finish. The signature Belhaven yeast flavor is here and works out wonderfully in my opinion. Rich mouthfeel. Overall a wonderfull IPA. I really lucked out and must have gotten a fresh bottle, as the hop favors and aromas are better than most domestic IPA's that I have had. Highly reccomended."
""
""
"I'm heading to Scotland in a few weeks, and i will make a point of looking this beer up to see whether it's been Duke of Perth or the bottle deceiving me as to this beer's true nature. I hope Duke of Perth had it right!"
""
"I'd actually never seen this one on tap, and it caught my eye at the bar, so I figured I'd indulge. Clear, light golden-amber pour, with a small frothy white head. Nose was crisp and flowery, sweet with honey and citrus zest. Pleasant taste, wildflower honey, lavender, orange blossom...it was sweet but light enough to not be sickening or syrupy. Fresh, low carbonation, light-medium body, easily drinkable. Didn't really come off as an IPA, and was pretty low-key even for an EIPA, but it was still a good beer. I'd probably get it again."
""
"Poured from a 500mL bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Beer pours a nice amberish straw color with a small white head, but has a little bit of lacing. Smells of very earthy hops and very slight malt, not terribly strong, but still pleasant. Tastes of great earthy notes and slight floral note, but very pleasant. Carbonation is great and this light bodied beer goes down really smooth, with a slight aftertaste, but not unpleasant. Overall, a very good beer."
""
"Aroma, taste, and mouthfeel all improve as the beer warms. I would have given it higher marks if I had let it warm for 15 minutes before sampling."
"Overall: A pleasant, well-balanced ale to drink while tentatively shopping for sofas online (and giving the cat the ""don't you dare ruin this one"" speech -- I'm fairly certain it went IN one cat ear and OUT the other)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a clear bottle and it shows. It's a bit skunkey in aroma and in taste. The taste is also astringent with band-aids. So it does not fair too well in my book. Head was nonexistent. I won't buy it again however I'm glad I tried it; I'm always looking to try something new."
""
""
"Not a bad beer, more of an English Pale Ale in my opinion. Lightweight grassy and floral. I'm not a huge fan of the grass tones, astringency, and thin body but none of these are bad by any means. Good English I/PA substitute for hot weather."
""
""
""
"I loves me some Belhaven Twisted Thistle. They used to have this as a standard on nitro at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse back in the day and boy, do I miss that! Still pick up a bottle here and there, sit back, and enjoy. An excellent afternoon slugger."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 500 ml bottle into a pint glass, new at the local store, but not sure how fresh, don't like the clear bottle. This pours light golden color with a off white head. The smell from a distance is already a tad skunky, other smells light hops and caramel and biscuit malts. The feel is medium. The taste is better than expected, higher hops than most British ipa, caramel and biscuit malts, not skunky as expected."
""
""
"Overall: An excellent English IPA, more malty than hoppy, delicious nonetheless."
""
""
"This is not a bad beer. I saw it in the store and decided to give it a shot because I am a big fan of hoppy IPAs. The appearance was beautiful and clear. The smell was very floral which, for me was a little turn off but there was some hops coming through. The taste was good but a lot of the hoppy characteristics seamed unable to shine through and balance the sweetness. So, like i said; a little sweet for my pallet and I was expecting a little more hops from an IPA. Overall, not bad, just not what I was expecting or really in the mood for at the time."

"A decent beer for an English IPA. My personal prejudice is for more hopped American versions, but this one is worth trying if you're looking for a more traditional old-world styled IPA."
""
""
"O - A nice example of the English style IPA. Very sessionable with a full and tasty yet not overly complex flavour."
""
""
"O: Nice drinkable IPA, embodies the ""english"" style for sure. Solid brew."

"Note: Other reviews are so different, I wonder if they're drinking the 6.1% export version I've heard about..."
""
"Overall: This is well balanced beer but not as ""hoppy"" or complex as many IPAs. I would have it again but it really should not be labeled an IPA."
""
"A really intriguing brew. The blend of hops, with the inclusion of noble hops, is something I haven't had before which makes this strangely inviting. It's not bang on style but I really rather enjoyed this. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall, this is a nice and unusually hoppy English IPA. I'd get it again if I felt in the mood."
"O - Not exactly what I was expecting for a beer labeled an IPA but it was very tasty. It could use a little more hops balance but overall I did enjoy it and could have several of these in one sitting."
"D - Easy going, tasty beer. A good session!"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a golden orange color with a thin, white, low profile frothy head that clings to any part of the glass it touches. Nose is floral, with a heavy dose of grapefruit, and a good supply of light, fresh hops. Smells delicious. Flavor gets a lot more of the floral character, with a mouthful of aromatic and pungent fern, blended with a good dose of hops, and the citrus is barely shining through, mostly overpowered. There is a slightly roasty/toasty character, also. The beer is mid-bodied, and very crisp. The aftertaste is roasted, with a little citrus sweet and a wierd semisweet tang. The finish is a bit sweet and sour, with a bit of pucker and drying bitterness, too. This is a decent beer, but the smell definitely had me hoping for more."
"Overall, a decent beer. I won't try it again simply because it is not for me but I could see how some would really like this."
"Smells of raw chicken, a terrible skunkiness, overpowers everything. does not taste very well eighter, could keep drinking it, but I don't really want to. Should not have been in a clear bottle."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable. I would have no problem drinking several of these in succession."
"This brew pours out as a dark orange color, The head was a little soapy looking and left a little lacing at first. The smell had some earthy hop aromas in it with a decent malt character as well. The taste was malty upfront and had a nice hop bite on the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was smooth, almost a little flat. Overall it's not my favorite IPA out there but its worthy looking into."
"Pair with fish & chips, soul food."
"D- 4 I like the flavor of this one and it is certainly sessionable. It is a little sweeter than ideal and light on any knock-your-socks-off flavors, but it is easy to drink and packs a decent punch. Worth a try at least once. Before this bottle I'd only had it on tap and remember liking it even more, for what it's worth."
"overall; A tasty twist on the style, I was not blown away by this beer but this was quite enjoyable."
"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Clear orange-yellow pour with nice two finger head with good retention and lacing. A little skunkiness in the nose when I opened it, but it quickly faded and gave way to biscuity, sweet malt with some mild floral notes and hints of apricot and perfume. The taste is dominated by the sweet caramel malts with the apricots from the nose really coming through as well. Bitter hops and a hint of pine balance it out nicely. I'm also getting a touch of buttered squash in the finish. Nice chewy, tangy, bitter mouthfeel that's slightly sticky and very drinkable. The initial skunkiness had me worried, but it really turned out to be a quite enjoyable beer."
"This is a nicely drinkable English IPA which would be quite sessionable. I like how the malt sweetness mingles with the hop bitterness, with the hops winning the friendly competiton between the two just at the very end. I would buy this again if I wanted a fairly mellow IPA with just enough of a hop bite."
"D: ""I'd tap that"" --Also my old soccer coach, but inreference to the girl's soccer coach."
"D: OK, but nothing great. Good malt character and balance."
"Drinkability: A solid English IPA."
"The packiaging looks ""cool"" but that is not what beer should be about."
"Drinkabiliy was pretty good. Some slight off-flavors but light bitterness made it drinkable."
"I do love me an earthy beer but the butter gets to be a bit much by the end of the bottle."
"D: Balanced brew, nothing is aggressive really. Easy to drink for sure, and even more during the hot days of summer."
"I would probably not use a clear bottle. Regardless, this is a middle-of-the-road take on an english IPA."
"Drinkability: It's a nice drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours."
"D: An easy beer to drink. Can easily have a few of these and enjoy them."
"Overall, very drinkable and refreshing beer. However, it is not for hopheads because it barely has any more hops than the average English Pale Ale."
"D: Goes down easily, somewhat tasty, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice solid beer worth drinking for a long time."
"I could have another one of these. It's refreshing, smooth and easy to go down."
"Taste - well-balanced, malty body, accomplished by mighty hop accord, lingering for a long time, low carbonation, highly recommended specimen of the Scottish Brewing!"
"Pours a pale orange colour with nice white head and rings of lacing after each sip. Big floral and earthy hops with bicuit and caramel malt backbone. Defintely an English IPA, but it seems to be more hop forward than most. Great balance of bitterness and malt. It would easy to down several pints of this."
"Drinkability pretty simple, but I don't want another thanks."
"Drink - Definitely a beer worth trying. It's nothing spectacular, but it hits the spot nicely."
"Drinkability - I enjoyed this well enough, but not something I'd drink all the time. I think it would drink better with food."
"This just might be my favorite English IPA."
"Belhaven Twisted Thistle pours a clear golden straw color in the glass with a thick white froth, pretty lacing, & really good retention. A very attractive beer. The nose is obvious, yet not overwhelming. Perfuming from the glass are aromas of piney hop resin, green tea, orange peel, lemon zest, toffee, & subtle honey glazed cornbread biscuits. However, there is a noticeable skunkiness to the beer that I just can't get past. (Unfortunately, bringing down the score slightly) Medium bodied, the beer has a smooth dryness , yet noticeable hop bitterness & an almost creamy carbonation. The beer balances the flavors found on the nose & finishes with a crisp green apple & asian pear. Overall, the Twisted Thistle is an amazing example of the English style IPAs & definitely recommended."
"This is a pleasant, quaffable english style IPA. It is very refreshing for a late summer evening. I suspect it would be even more so if the ale were fresher; right from the source, this would be superb."
"Very drinkable. Very mild IPA, yet very complex in flavor. Very nice."
"drinkability - nothing too exciting here, i'm glad I tried this though"
"T- For an IPA, the sweet fruit comes through. Almost strawberry. There is no real maltiness at all and the hops don't jump through much either. Actually, more like a watermelon IPA. Meh."
"M/D: Moderate body, fizzy carbonation. Mediocre. Fairly drinkable. I won't be seeking it out again. The floating chunks and yeast funk were a bit much for it to overcome. Take those away and I'd consider it worthy. Hops are too subdued for the style."
"Smooth and silky mouthfeel that is by far the highlight of this beer. The malts are too assertive even for the English style, but there are enough little things going on around the edges to make this a pretty good sipper overall."
"Overall a very easy drinking, delicious and well balanced IPA. I would like to drink this again."
"From tasting notes October 2009."
"This arrived with a finger of thick, bone-white head that slowly reduced to wisps. Color was a beautiful deep-amber with NE-plus quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose had a pronounced citrus hoppiness - an American-style IPA from the SCOTS?!? Zounds! Mouthfeel was soft, like they had gotten really, really good water for use in its production. There was a flowery, mildly citric hop flavor on the tongue. This represented (for me) a welcome bridge between too-mild English IPAs and over-the-top-hoppy American IPAs. Hello, Goldilocks! Finish was a nice mix of hops and malt, very pleasant. It kind of put me in mind of DFH 60"" or hop tea, neither bad things of which to be reminded."
"D - not a hop bomb, but a nice blend of hop flavours and feels with a little more present maltiness than I expected. The great balance makes with very drinkable, even session worthy."
"F: Finishes somewhat bitter as the hops catch up and build to the finish. THe spicy quality seems to come out more on the finish, with a little earthy, chewy, and grassy hop components as well. It has more lingering malty flavors, a little sweet malty taste lingers, but it's not sweet, its mostly dry. Some creamy malts also there, but not very much."
"Medium body, lower, smooth carbonation. Alcohol well hidden. Very nice."
"medium-low carbonation gives interesting contrast of creamy body up front and hoppy, not quite drying, but sharply bitter finish. Extremely refreshing, and I'd love to have this one again."
"This is what I love about English IPAs, the malt complexity, not to be outdone by some very nice hop characteristics, that combine to make one fine drinking beer, IMO."
"Drinkability: this beer is very tasty and compelling. I'd gladly drink this again. Belhaven has impressed me quite favorably once again."
"Served from bottle into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Pours a nice golden color with a two finger white head that remains. There was no apparent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of hops and fruit. The flavor was a cross between a sour and an IPA with a fruity aftertaste. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall I am glad that one of the employees of Bestway suggested that I try this one. It is a very smooth and drinkable beer. Glad I got the opportunity to try this one."
"I had a 16 oz pour of this at the Amsterdam Ale House in New York. I know that Belhaven is an english company so I expected a lower key English style IPA. But I found this to be decidedly english in style while still having a very aggressive hop-forward character. Color is is darker than a typical Ipa. Aroma is good, hoppy. Flavor is a perfect blend of malt and hops. Very good."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Would say that it's a medium body. Looking forward to my next pint of Twisted Thistle."
"[I found it especially disappointing because the initial impression seemed interesting and a nice change from my usual diet of aggressive American IPAs. Alas...]"
"The taste is slightly caramelised breadiness with tea and leaves, grapes, citrus - mostly lemon and light bitter orange (a bit different from the bottle), with hints of caramel, light yeastiness. It is nicely balanced with light sweetness. It holds up very well to food and is highly drinkable."
"Found this at M'Coul's in downtown Greensboro, NC. It shows a clear light copper color with a solid white cover and decent lace. The aroma offers a modest citrus hop and caramel malt, pleasant. The flavor brings obvious apple/citrus hops with bright toffee and light malt. It's mid-plus bodied with a very subtle but effective carbonation. Very drinkable and a very decent choice if you're not in the mood for the higher hoppiness of an American IPA."
"Nice example of the style. Don't let the so-so aroma fool you."
"Taste is unique, a light fruity smack with a small hop infusion. Very nice. Mouthfeel keeps remaining light. Hides the alcohol very well. Very drinkable, nice price for what it is. One of my favorite English IPAs, right up there with Fuller's."
"Anyways I am positive this beer is part of what turned me into a hophead and for that, it shall forever hold special place in my heart. The End."
"I'm partial. I like the style. I like hops. I like Scotland. No surprise - I like this beer."
"Notes: Well, for a supposedly fresh tap pour it feels a touch dull, and not particularly worth the import, although in some places this offering rescues otherwise really mediocre tap lines..."
"Overall, a nicely done EIPA with good flavors and great drinkability(thanks to a subdued bitterness and easy finish). The use of cascade hops makes it very similar to an AIPA. Nose was a little too laid back for me, but I must judge according to style. Would like to see this in a sixer."
"From a 25 fl. oz. bottle labeled L9265A. The pour is a nice looking amber-copper with a half-inch of frothy off-white head and excellent clarity overall. The aroma was kind of a letdown. I noticed more malts than hops but overall my particular bottle smelled rather skunky. But the taste gave it new life as it burst with modest flavorful hops and a pleasant background of caramel malts. Except for the aroma this was a nice beer in the end."
"Overall, I enjoyed this!"
"Not sure how long my bottle sat on the shelf at Spec's, but I am not getting much hop presence in this beer besides a short burst of light bitterness on the finish. It still tastes pretty fresh as there is no signs of oxidation or cardboard flavors. Honeyed, grainy malts seem to be more than just a backbone here, they are close to being the dominant flavor. Still a fairly enjoyable beer to drink but it needs to be more than merely balanced to warrant the IPA nomenclature in my book. And at nearly four bucks a bottle, it is not really a bargain either."
"- cheers."
"very drinkable! not too many at once... just one or two at a time, but def. worth having again"
"A mild approachable English IPA, would make a great starter for someone dipping their toes into this style without being intimidated. If it weren't for the abv% this would make a decent session ale."
"This is a winner. I wish there were more on hand. Not as hoppy as I had initially expected from an IPA, but this has a really nice hop flavor that is satisfying for those who appreciate a good IPA and welcoming enough for others."
"d: a good beer; i would have it again in a heartbeat; very uk taste with a but of a grassy kick"
"the abv lingers a bit in the back of the throat and is warming to the body, very drinkable and delicious!"
"This brew is good but is kind of a mixed bag. It almost needed to go more in one flavors direction to make you appreciate it more. It is something that was decent to try once, but if you are expecting hops; you will be disapointed. For someone that isnt big on over hopped IPA's this may be your thing. This would be a good drinkable brew for non hop heads to have in the summer at a party."
"Poured into a wheat type glass. Nice hazy amber yellow with a big head that hangs around and decent lacing. Great flowery citrus aroma. First sip I could taste the hoppy bitterness but after initial sip the bitterness gave way to citrus and flowers. I liked this beer a lot so if you are a hophead this one might not be for you."
"this is a really weird beer."
"d- this is a tasty eipa, it's very different from your run of the mill american ipa, it's more of a crisp, dry finisher which is a welcome change of pace, i'd drink this beer again!"
"I poured this brew from a pint+ bottle, had a caramel aroma with hints of biscuit, poured golden clear color with a minimal head, tasted a medium bitterness, lightly sour and a dry bitter finish; definetly a smooth beer that I could drink all night long; I had this one while enjoying some pasta with shrimp and parmesan and was excellent complement to the meal"
"Drinkability: I could have drank this all night. I've found a new go-to beer that won't let me down when I don't feel like trying something new."
"This is a decent beer, though I would prefer touching up the hop flavour a bit. It has enough hops for the nose, but not for the tongue."
"A very nice change, from the usual hopped up American pale ales"
"D: Easily drank and the flavours are good. Maybe it's the english style that I have no tried, but this is unqiue to me. Price is a stopping factor for me though."
"d: For the ones that like bitters and IPAs like me, this would be a pleasure."
"A very good E(sorry about that, lads) IPA, and ramped up, in a seemingly measured UK manner."
"D: Goes down easy and drinks well with food."
"I didn't know what to expect with this one and I was not upset by it at all, tasted great and was very easy to drink and well worth trying"
"Overall a nice english IPA. I'd love to try it on cask. A very underappreciated style IMO, there's something to be said for subtelty. Don't get me wrong, im a WC hopbomb sucker for life, but that doesn't mean i can't like these too. Take some time and really think about it, and you can learn to appreciate them too. A good beer."
"D- what i've come to like about english IPAs is definitely embodied in this beer. not so intense, it's very well balanced and mild enough to have more than one. top notch."
"D: A nice beer that's pretty typical of a well made english IPA. This one I'll buy again."
"Drinkability - Highly drinkable for an IPA. Not as hoppy as the american versions so your tongue and taste buds wont fatigue as quickly."
"A fine example of a modern British IPA."
"Totally worth a try. great example of an IPA."
"Very sessionable and Belhaven has never disappointed."
"This beer pours a nice honey colour with nice carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head with only a ring a lacing,it has a nice floral,citrus,honey hop aroma to it very nice indeed,it has an above average mouthfeel with a dominant citrus,honey hop start that finishes with a nice touch of caramel maltiness and a tinge of bitterness but not that bitter by any means and alcohol is well hidden making this beer very easy to drink as a session beer."
"Overall; the best EIPA I've had to date. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the style."
"Very drinkable. Recommended."
"A solid beer, just not outstanding. Lots of little yest colonies or possibly protein floating around in my glass. Big floral smell. Reminded my of an apple orchard in bloom. Big bitter bite at the front and settles down. The taste lingers a bit. Very hoppy which I like but the balance is off. Worthy of a sample though."
"Beyond the appearance, everything was great. Very crisp aroma, you can already sense the strong hops flavor. Tastes great. Very rich with a great dry finish. Not too watery."
"Drinkability: Probably the best english IPA I've had."
"D- meh.. this isn't an American IPA. This is a very bland and another English style malt bomb. Smooth and easy drinking however."
"D- The balance, ABV, flavor, and MF makes this tremendous. A great session beer for a night out at a pub."
"This is a delicious, refreshing brew. Very nice on this warm summer evening."
"D: A real nice English IPA, this one was quite fresh and very flavourful, another fantastic beer from Belhaven."
"cheers..."
"Not a whole lot of an aftertaste, not much bitterness, not much carbonation. A smooth beer to be sure, and easily drinkable."
"Really solid atmosphere. Good lookin' brew, and a simple nose that you'd expect from this style. Hoppy flavor, but a little nice malt to balance it out. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"I think this could be the first Scottish beer I've tried. I'm not impressed. This is borderline-drinkable for my taste, just way too bland. There's nothing interesting about it; it actually doesn't really have anything going for it. Goes down smoothly enough, just not that great. How is this averaging a B+?"
"Had this on tap at Grech's Millbrook Inn in Pond Eddy, NY. Pretty light golden amber color. Not much head. Smell was dry and grassy. Taste was fairly light and watery then floral hops and a very dry finish. Slight off-taste. Not bad but not great, not worth trying if you like robust IPAs."
"This is an unusual IPA. At least the draft version I had at an Irish pub in Kentucky was unusual. The color is dark straw with a meager head, but the nose is a nice slightly floral. Refreshing mouthfeel and carbonation in the draw, but on the palate this one is pretty tart. The tartness persists through the finish, but does leave a slight lingering bitterness."
"This is not the greatest IPA out there, but it is Belhaven, a brewery that has always gotten my respect. This said, I would still drink it and am now eagerly anticipating it on tap."
"An ok beer, i would love to try this fresh. A very moderate IPA, English i suppose is the excuse, was very surprised to see cascade hops in this. The only interesting thing was how smooth this beer was, interesting texture for an IPA. Other than that, very average."
"Nikki"
"Overall, not a bad beer but for those who like very hoppy beer, this one is not for you."
"Pours clear gold with a billowing off white head that hold together nicely. Smells strongly of herbal/floral hops (cannabis), tropical fruit, and sweet malt. Tastes strongly hoppy without being terribly bitter; lots of nice earthy herbal notes that go well with the bready malt and an interesting smokiness. Light-medium bodied--this is really the weakest point. Really flavorful, pleasant, and easy to drink."
"taste is creamy, citrus, some caramel, few malts, some wood, and hops in the back, ends bitter and a little dry."
"Quite a easy to drink beer. Worth a try!"
"Too bad there aren't more English IPA's out there as the market is flooded with the American Hop Bombs. Worth seeking out, quite enjoyable."
"Not a bad beer, I could see drinking a few of these on a summer day if it came in 12oz bottles and was priced a little better. At $4.99 for a 500ml, there are better IPAs that I would enjoy."
"Overall, a very drinkable English-style IPA. Very smooth."
"D - Decent stuff with an interesting flavor profile, though just ""off"" enough for me to be satisfied after just one. The earthy hop profile keeps things interesting but is just a bit too strong for me."
"Dark orange in color, served in a nonic pint glass. The hoppiness was just weird. It was a floral malty scent I've gotten out of IPA's sometimes that just isn't appetizing. Even if I weren't judging it against the much better West Coast American-style IPA's, it'd still be a poor beer in my opinion with weird flavors."
"I would not refuse one of these if offered but I don't really foresee an occasion where I would buy one of these again given the current state of craft beers."
"D - This is a very good beer thats easy to drink with a very good taste even though its an English IPA it will still keep hop heads happy worth trying sometime"
"nice to see the scots using american (chinook) hops. this is really more of a hybrid american/english IPA, but great all the same."
"D- Good a nice change up."
"Cloudy, cloudy. More than I expected for the style. This is one of the strangest IPA's I've ever had but I loved it. Cloudy and orange, great balance between citrus and carmel in the nose. Sweet upfront and bitter in the back for the taste. A very nice bitterness, by the way. Good mouthfeel, a great bar beer. Very drinkable. Delicious stuff. Grab one."
"The appearance could be good or bad depending on how much you like cloudy beer. This one is very cloudy. Pours pale amber with a modest half inch of cream color head. The head fades rather quickly and leaves a good amount of lacings. The aroma is mostly malts, some yeast, and floral hops. Taste is sweet maltiness with a firm earthy but balanced bitterness. The richness of the malts is way more than typical American IPA's. I suspect this beer may be a bit old and as there is no obvious date I wish I could try it from a keg sometime. Carbonation was typical of British Ales(subdued). An interesting brew and I enjoyed drinking it all."
"It pours a dark orange, with a stubbornly persistant chunky, foamy tan head. It's rather malty, with some caramel and toffee notes and well balanced with the hops, which has a light orange peel, slight pine and resin character. Nice mellow character that doesn't hit you over the head with any particular flavor. A nice IPA, and I'd drink it again."
"Pours a light golden color with a half finger of head that leaves tons of retention on the sides of the glass. Smell is not super strong but sweet. Taste is smooth and sweet. Hard to explain as I haven't had a euro ipa in so long. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with a clean light finish. Very drinkable. I wouldn't turn one down."
"D - This tastes good but I probably wouldn't buy it again. Nothing wrong with it, just not to my general taste."
"D - The pub ale flavor would get overwhelming, not overly impressed."
"The flavor is a wonderful combination of hoppy bitterness, and sweetness with notes of honey, orange, and necterine. It could be said that this beer is nicely floral and very drinkable. I loved it and wich I could get this beer on tap locally."
"This ale was extremely smooth and pretty enjoyable. And it may be a nice representation of an English IPA, but definitely not what I was looking for. There are so many more IPAs out there that I would prefer to drink."
"The easy drinking of this beer is scary, at 6% you need to sip, but the taste draws you in like a moth to a flame."
"From a 1L bottle purchased locally. Aroma is like lemony iced tea. Color is a golden amber that is clear except for what look s like hop particles floating around. Flavor is malty, biscuity with some hop bitterness and citrusy hop flavor in the finish. Full and rich but not too sweet, but still balanced a little toward the malt. Do not expect an American IPA out of this one. This is more along the lines of an English IPA that is more balanced and malt focused. A slightly bigger pale ale."
"d: Damn good English IPA. Love the maltiness. Definitely a classic English beer. I could drink TONS of this."
"Cloudy color, orange color, small head, white, good lacing. Somewhat watery aroma, some hops, not overpowering aroma. Watery hoppy taste, bitter & unbalanced. Bitter aftertaste. Smoother as it warms up, but still not much flavor."
"This is a good beer. Very drinkable and a good starting point to get people into IPA's."
"Has a milky amber complexion. Solid beer with few flaws, but no outstanding qualities. A little bit of a twang aftertaste that leaves the mouth looking for more. I would not search for this beer, but I do enjoy drinking it. I am a general fan of Belhaven, and this beer will not change my good favor of the brand."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a cloudy, light copper color with a two finger khaki head. The retention was great as a cap and the lacing was in thin, albeit broken bands. The aroma was quite appealing, citrus hops and floral hops with caramel malt and some hints of fruity alcohol esters. The flavors started with a flash of caramel malt immediately followed by a blast of hops, hints of citrus rind and tart apples behind which was a bready, malty backbone. The body was medium full, the carbonation just a touch high and the mouthfeel rich and quaffable. Very easy to drink and nicely balanced bitter/sweet elements."
"D- Very drinkable for an IPA. Not too bitter."
"As much at their flagship Scottish Ale sucked, this one is quite impressive. Pours clear gold with a decent white head. Sharp, peppery hops that actually smell like a thistle. Astringent hop taste, more on the English IPA spectrum (duh, its from Scotland), with a decent amount of orange citrus flavors, and a sweeter, honey-malt finish. A pleasant surprise."
"Final Thought: It's like a hybrid of doppelbock and pale ale in a bottle, it's unique but not overly memorable."
"500 mL bottle of this Twisted Thistle IPA. I love the name and the purple label with the thistle flower image on the bottle. The beer pours amber in color with a big pillowy head that had decent retention and lacing. The aroma is caramel malt, biscuit, and a little burnt sugar. Medium bodied as it moves across the palate. Sweet malt flavor up front morphs into biscuit in the center before finishing bitter. The slightly dry bitterness lingers for a few moments before dissipating away. This is a respectable brew. Hoppiness is not overt like most American IPAs but is in line with those brewed across the pond. Pleasant Indeed."
"Easy to drink and balanced, another solid offering from Belhaven."
"overall a very balanced beer with plenty of subtlety as you would expect for the style. A pleasant easy drinking brew."
"16.9 ounce bottle, w/o any freshness/bottling information to be found. Pours clear typical amber, light tan head, some retention and then some nice fine lace left on the glass. In the sniff phase, I'm getting some fairly strong notes of malt and whiskey/grain/woody peat. This is an enjoyable fairly assertively hopped (for a Brit. offering) IPA. Nice balance between the malts and Hops. Plenty of dark wheat, malty notes and the hops are softly grainy. Long finish with more whiskey/Scotch undertones. Nice stuff, nothing amazing but certainty a worthy session candidate"
"Very nice hoppy and floral aroma. Decent amount of head that leaves a nice amount of lacing on the glass. Taste doesn't have as much hops in it as the aroma. More fruit taste in the body than expected but a nice clean finish overall. The color is a light-medium orange copper. Drinkablity is medium to high on this one with wishes of a slight more hop flavor. Another good beer from Belhaven."
"drinkability is good. this is a smooth and easy drinking IPA with a solid hop quality and just enough malt to avoid becoming overly-hopped. cheers!"
"drinkability is not great, based on the bit of strong cutting fruity, more so as it warms."
"D- Drinks great like a pale ale should"
"Drinkability is good, goes well with dinner, though a bit too buttery, especially as it warmed."
"I think the label and back of the bottle make you believe that this is some West Coast hoppy IPA but in reality this is a decent IPA that more Brit than PNW no matter what the hops are in the recipe. Orange Gold, with a pleasant hop nose this is a malt influenced IPA that has its own character ( You know it is Scottish). I like it but had to quickly realize that the C hops don't dominate."
"Dark gold with clear liquid and a small head. Aromas are citrus like an American style pale ale. A good amount of spritz on the tongue with sweet malt flavor and fruity esters from the ale yeast. This is a good example of a lighter colored(compared to American IPA's which have become dark for the style)English IPA but with an American C-hops profile. Nice hybrid from our friends across the pond."
"D> yeah!"
"Drinkability is good. Better than I thought. It's closer to a nut ale or pale ale, but thats for the better. I couldn't pair this with much but its definately a good beer."
"Extremely drinkable. I wish I bought more than one bottle. This is the best beer I've had in some time."
"D: Solid all-around and very easy to drink. I'll buy this one again."
"Tastes very flavorful with the hop bitterness. spicy and crisp this is a very well balanced IPA. Very typical for an English IPA but still one that is to be enjoyed. truly a score when you aren't expecting to find it."
"A smooth, medium-bodied drink with a flavor profile that doesn't blot out senses and pound the palate, giving Belhaven's IPA excellent drinkability for style."
"Mostly clear, light orage color with one finger of bubbly white head that hangs around a while. Smell is REALLY nice. Clean, crisp, slightly bitter, with a grape finish! Taste is nicely bitter, VERY well balanced with a mild honey malt backbone and flavors that match the aromas very well. Mouthfeel is somewhat light, definitely crisp, pleasant. So clean and balanced, I could drink this all day. A very interesting beer without being over the top or ""extreme."""
"Pours a crisp orange with a nice frothy head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves great lacing. Aroma is some mild citrus hops and sweet malt. The taste a nice crisp medly of citrus hops with sweet malts right behind creating a nice balance. The beer is on the light side of medium and while there is some stickiness, it's not overbearing. This is a very enjoyable example of the style."
"Worth a try..."
"D - I love this one! It's very smooth and enjoyable. Some die-hard hopheads may be disappointed, but I can definately see myself drinking more of this in the future. A great beer from a great brewery."
"MF&D - Over all I was very impressed by this IPA, I guess I expected more after drinking Belhaven Scotch Ale. Not horrible, but I wouldn'd buy it again."
" A rather strange and unique IPA."
"this is a solid beer, nothing spectacular, but it's worth checking out."
"This is a good english IPA. I'd like a little more hop bite and a little less malt sweetness. But then again, my preference is for American IPAs over English IPAs. That said, I could session this beer."
"The balanced flavor and light body make this IPA very drinkable. With only 6.1% ABV, this is an excellent session beer."
"M & D: Medium-full body with appropriate carbonation. The alcohol content limits its drinkability just slightly, but the complex and well-balanced favor warrants at least a few pints. A very interesting brew - An English-style IPA, brewed by Scots using American hops!"
"Poured out of 16.9oz bottle into your run of the mill pint glass. Nice amber color with a quickly dissipating head that released nice, light floral tones and slight honey. Nice, balanced mouthfeel- good deal of hop but not overloading. Fantastic finish! Nice bitterness with no residual mouth hang. Great, clean IPA."
"D: Moderate drinkability per style, sparingly hopped and watery palate disappoints."
"It's been a while since I've had a good IPA and I saw this one, thought I'd try it out. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear, copper-golden color with a thick, foamy head. Smell is milder than I expected; slight malty undertones and a vauge earthy hop pressence. The taste is outwardly malty, I'm not getting much in the way of hops other than bitterness for balance. Again, maybe just a touch of earthy hops. The mouthfeel is pretty light with a foamy carbonation. Overall a good beer, but not what I was expecting from an IPA but maybe that's the difference between an AIPA and an EIPA."
"Pours a nice amber color with 2 inches worth of foam and lovely lacing down the glass. A nice thick cap settles in a stays put the entire way down. Aroma of nice piney hops and floral sweetness in the nose. Taste is somewhat hoppy but not over the top. Good use of piney hops, with hints of grapefruit and lemon peel, followed up by a good dose of caramel malts. Very bitter and dry on the finish. Full bodied, thick in the mouth and good carbonation that tingles the tongue. A nice English IPA."
"The taste is well layered, with a nice base of toasted malt and a solid overlapping of broad, flavorful hops and light citrus. Not withering or overpowering, but for me quite tasty. The mouthfeel is a little thin but okay for a less alcohol doused IPA than I'm used to and matched by a lower level of carbonation. For me, this is a textbook example of the style and extremely sessionable. Not for those expecting a hop bomb but will certainly have its admirers."
"I don't find it drinkable. I'll por the rest in the sink now and pour an IPA home brew."
"Overall an uneventful event."
"D: Definitely drinkable, I could definitely drink this beer again. My favorite English style IPA that I've had thus far. Definitely recommended."
"D: This paired well with smoked sausage and is a nice change from yet another IPA. Contrary to some reviewers, I didn't get an overwhelming contribution from the smoked malt... more of a pleasant secondary note."
"1"" creamy, off-white head that retains well at 1/4"" and leaves a sheet of lace. Glowing orange with a slight chill haze. Nicely balanced aroma between hops with a delicate fruitiness and a decent malt weight...some cherry in the nose. Rubber/smoke up front. Slight sour flash mid-palate - sour fruit (cherry, orange). Fairly light on bittering hops. Full bodied with low carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. Unique and enjoyable. Smoky IPA -- different."
"Mouthfeel: Above average carbonation, otherwise mouthfeel is almost a non-factor. Neither smooth nor crisp. A dull mouthfeel taste that dissipates really fast."
"D: it is a very nice IPA, but I am not into English IPAs. Good mouthfeel, but less carbonation and thickness"
"This is a nice cross between a Scottish ale and an IPA but it's not all that compelling."
"Love how the hops just keep on giving after the sip, providing an incredibly long finish. Twisted Thistle (great name!) forces you to remember it. Not in a tongue-ripping way, but no hop enthusiast will walk away unimpressed."
"A good IPA with slightly more malt than normal. A solid and very drinkable brew. Try!"
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer, but it hardly blew me away. It just didn't have that same vibrancy as others of the style. Still, not a bad effort."
"Appearance, a very nice rich amber color with a nice creamy two finger head that disolves slowly. Smell of hops, orange and malt. Taste has hoppiness like a grapefruit bitter, lightly toasted malts and maybe even a little nutty. Mouthfeel is a good silky medium. A little different than what I'm used to in an IPA, but thats what makes tasting these beers more enjoyable."
"One of the few English IPA's that i've had so far. I am delighted with it. The killer over-the-top PacNW IPA's that I imbibe on a daily basis really make me enjoy the simpler style presented here. A great brew!"
"Reasonably drinkable albeit somewhat boozy at a 6.10 percent that you can really feel. I'll enjoy this for much of the 3rd quarter of the Celtics game. But again, there is balance in quantity of the malts and hops, but something just seems too drastic in the transition."
"Drinkability : good beer in the style India Pale Ale"
"Served into a pint glass from the bottle, this is a hazy pale amber color, with a substantial white head that subsides quickly, leaving minimal lacing on the glass. The smell is slightly biscuity. The taste is malty and biscuity, with a hint of lemon tartness and a slight piny hop bite at the finish. The beer is rich and smooth, but it lacks the hop intensity and complexity one would expect in a good English IPA. As a beer, this tastes fine. As an IPA, it disappoints."
"D - Goes down easy and finishes clean, I could session this beer until I ran into the collective might of its 6.1 abv."
"I'm going to have to try this one again in the summertime as it would probably be a great brew to satisfy the ""yard-work"" intake. To me, it just lacks the ""something special"" to sit down and enjoy its journey."
"Drinkability: Sometimes a hybrid works, sometimes it doesn't; an interesting stab at a Scottish take on an IPA but it didn't float my boat"
"D: I have often over looked drinkability when it comes to IPA's, and this beer has made me re-evaluate that opinion. Its high drinkability really allows its depth and complexities to manifest into great taste."
"Decent brew but I'd hoped for more."
"16.9oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark golden amber color with a nice off-white head. The aroma is very pleasant and enticing, with sweet buttery malt and piney hops. The taste is balanced very nicely with a strong malty backbone to support a nice bitter finish from the hops. The hops are definately there, but they do not take over the brew like many American IPAs. Overall, this is a very nice IPA that is recommended."
"pours a light copper color with a big white head and some small sediment on the bottom and a lot of carbonation. very busy beer, one of the few english ipa's i've had i believe. smell is good, much more malty and subdued that most american IPA's, but it is an interesting change. of course it has some hop aroma to it, but it isn't a specific style, just hops. taste is really flipping good, i enjoy it alot, it almost tastes more like a pale ale with some ipa thrown in, good beer all around."
"This beer poured a pretty copper color with a fluffy single-finger head. The nose is mostly sweet malts with a faint whiff of something like honey. The taste is largely sweet malts that give way to a fairly unique middle flavor that may very well be the thistles and finishes with a little bit of hops. The mouthfeel is thick and almost creamy. This is a nice drinkable beer, but I'm not sure I could see myself drinking more than one at a time."
"Its nice in the mouth because its so mild. To me this is a beer you could drink on a while because it doesn't get boring, however it never got exciting. This beer is the pussy cat of IPAs"
"Had on tap at the Beveridge Place Pub in W Seattle. They love it there. Pours orange-copper with some un-filtered floating sediment. Half-inch of off-white foam recedes to decent lace. Clearly an english IPA in aroma. Toasty biscuit malts predominate with strong orange marmalade notes and green herbal undertones. Flavor is not as good. Toasted malts, orange and earthy pine hop notes. Finish is dry, toasty, and hoppy, but exhibits unpleasant phenolic defects. The mouth-feel is excellent. Medium-chewy with well-rounded creaminess and a touch of carbonation. Very drinkable indeed."
"-Oelergud"
"Medium thickness in the mouth. Wet and smooth but has a tiny sticking thickness. Ashy as it warms. It's a loverly, sweet beer. White wine with a smoky overlay. Really nice indeed."
"A little bit too bland and subdued for my tastes. I really feel like the hops could do with a bit more of a kick to them, and I'm not sure this works in the bottle as well as it might in other formats, and cask in particular."
"All those hop heads can have the American and Double IPA. This is for me. A great malt flavor, but it also has plenty of hops. A damn good English IPA from one of my favorite breweries."
"drinkability; A tab tough for me. I love hoppy bitter but not astringent or soap flavor."
"Overall, I think it's a nice mild IPA."
"Drinkability - interesting but not on my short list."
"Wondering where all those hops in British-styed beers went? They're all in this beer. Very well-balance with more of a sweeter flavor (like sweet citrus), yet mildly hoppy and clean. With a ton of highly bitter beers on the market here on the West Coast, this beer makes a great crossover from the everyday IPA."
"500mL bottle purchased for $3.50 from LCBO in Toronto. Pours a clear light gold with decent head and a bit of carbonation. Poor lacing. Aroma is decently hoppy but not exactly strong. Taste is nicely bitter in a typical English style. Sessionable and solid."
"Pours a nice light amber with a great head and good lacing. Not quite as dark as most other IPAs, but still nice. A great scent! A great hoppy IPA with a wonderful addition of a floral scent. Tastes great, a nice hoppy IPA without overdoing it, although almost no thistle taste. Goes down great, the smoothest IPA I've had in a while."
"Overall perfect balance and immaculate drinkability make Twisted Thistle IPA a beer for all occasions."
"This bad boy pours a nice honey amber that is not too thick or cloudy. When going in for the aroma you find a gloriously subtle hop scent. This has the piney bitter taste I enjoy in by IPAs, with the bitterness really hitting you in the back of the mouth and as it goes down the ol' gullet. I could see drinking quite a few of these at a time, that is for sure."
"Hops up front, nice bitterness with a refreshing citrus note. Floral tastes in the finish that eventually turns to the grainy malt. Interesting to taste an Ale that's back heavy on malt rather than hops. Mouth feel is nice and the lack of strong bitterness in the back ups the drinkability considerably."
"Exp Feb. 09. Dark golden, auburn, orange hilights. Two finger head is beige or off-white. Slow moving bubbles, excellent lacing. The smell is hoppy, floral. Taste is all hops, a bit heavy with an alcohol mouthfeel. Bitterness is there but with a sour / tart lingering dry finish, hoppy astringency. All in all, I found this beer pleasantly hopped but a little too heavy, a certain lead quality to the taste and mouthfeel and that took away from the drinkability quotient. It sure looks like a great IPA but just didn't do it for me, this is one beer I'd like to try on tap sometime or again in the bottle with a bit more aging."
"Tastes of citric/grapefruity hops, yeasty spiciness. This beer is one of the most well made IPA's out there. The malt is in perfect blend with the bitterness of the hops."
"My bottle read 6.1% (European standard I guess.) Sampled on 9/4/07 from 500ml bottle into a tumbler (all I had available.) Slightly hazy yellow. Aroma speaks highly of a malt profile. Taste also left me wondering about the hops. Left me with a gummy palate (first ever to do that.) Tons of floaties! Undertones of blueberry/raspberry with slight bitterness. Not much to say about head or lacing. Drinkablilty is seriously dampened by the conditioning, way too much bloating effect for me. To me this is a niche brew; I will not try again."
"The hops start out surprisingly with fruit juice note. It's a bit sweet and biting which makes for an odd and somewhat unpleasant feeling and taste. The malt was smooth and almost invisible while the aroma was weak. I guess it was worth trying, but I wouldn't recommend this one."
" Overall I was impressed. I am still a fan of the US version much more, just because I really dig the huge IBU bitterness and that citrus hop punch. But this let me really see how the style originated and how far it has really been pushed. It was extremely drinkable and superbly smooth. To say that this one was good would be about right. I still think there should be different categories for this as opposed to our big hops, but irt can hold its own as a session ale anyday. Very nicely done and something I will be sure to try again."
"I had this on tap at the Old Forge restaurant in Massachusetts. It was presented in a pint glass, and had a light golden color, clear, with a 2-finger foam. The aroma was muted hops, and although I didn't know this was an authentic UK IPA I commented that I thought it was of the UK style. After seeing it's from Belhaven brewing (on BA) I see my suspicions were correct. Oh well, I was hoping to try local beers but this wasn't bad. The aroma and flavor were balanced but leaning toward the hops side. The body was light, thicker than water but not as much as I prefer. A very easy-to-drink representative of an easy-to like beer category."
"A great English style IPA, probably the best I've had the pleasure to try. Highly recommended."
"Full and rich mouthfeel, very satisfying. Not what I expected at all for the style, but tasty in its own way."
"Pours a clean light copper color with a white head. A nice aroma of grapefruity hops. A nice bitter taste and a graefruity hop end. It also has a nice aftertaste of hops. I was not expecting something this tasty to come from the UK, but it is very good."
"Overall, a moderately interesting beer. Worth checking out once as an example of an IPA from Scotland, but thats about it."
"This is a nice, unique IPA."
"Perfect gold with a slight orange hint. Suitable head that laces the glass for the remainder of your drink. Smell is only slightly hoppy, dry with citrus and honey dominating the aroma. Taste is refreshing, citrusy, but smooth. A very drinkable beer that belies its 6.1 abv. rating. A very good beer."
"The taste on first sip follows the nose. Lots of malt, though the sweetness is subdued compared to the smell, followed by a generous amount of hop flavour that is mostly bittering and only slightly citric. It's a pretty different approach to an IPA than I'm used to but I think it works nicely. At least, my palate isn't complaining...I notice that at various times during the session, sometimes the malt dominates, sometimes the hops do and that keeps me interested and makes me want to keep on sipping. I really like this Scottish IPA and I'm sure I'll be picking up some more. The finish is pretty dry and crisp. Man, at about $3 a bottle, this is one heck of a bargain too. My hat's off to Belhaven!!"
"Drinkability: Decent drinkability for an IPA."
"D - I really enjoyed this IPA. I've greatly enjoyed every beer that I've had from Belhaven, though, so it was no surprise. Good malt character and hop balance."
"Not bad for an English IPA but my tastebuds have really developed a fondness for the aggressive American IPAs."
"This is a VERY impressive IPA. One I wish I saw more of on tap here here in Baltimore (or anywhere else for that matter). Kudos to Frisco's for featuring this very fine beer."
"Good drinkability, but it is rich."
"Pours orange-copper with some un-filtered floating sediment. Half-inch of off-white foam recedes to decent lace. Clearly an english IPA in aroma. Toasty biscuit malts predominate with strong orange marmalade notes and green herbal undertones. Flavor is not as good. Toasted malts, orange and earthy pine hop notes. Finish is dry, toasty, and hoppy, but exhibits unpleasant phenolic defects. The mouth-feel is excellent. Medium-chewy with well-rounded creaminess and a touch of carbonation. Very drinkable and session-able. Wish the phenolic after-taste weren't present."
"I'm pretty sure that my version is around 5%-the bottle has been sent for recycling so I can't check. But I hope some day to try it on cask."
"This beer poured a light clear amber with a nice off white head. There were many active little bubbles coming up through the body. The smell was very nice, piney spicy hops with a sweet buttery biscuit note. The taste was sweet and malty up front, the sweetness was fruity, like apricots. The bitterness was there at the end, piney with a little spiciness. A little too much malt, not much, just a little. The mouthfeel is buttery smooth and the tight carbonation with the ending hops make this very drinkable."
"Wouldnt really mind but I surely wouldnt be boasting about it"
"Overall, recommended. I just would love to try it fresh."
"I actually got this beer by accident. One of my buddies ordered a different Belhaven brew and the waitress brought the IPA, so I took it at half off. Can't beat that!"
"The taste is a bit better, lightly bitter with a zesty hop character. It finishes with a metallic, almost iron-like note. The bitterness is fairly subtle (especially if compared to an American IPA), but is still quite hoppy. Notes of menthol mix with pine, a touch of bergamot and even a hint of cinnamon to form the dominant hop flavors. The body of this beer is quite light, this could definitely be a sessionable brew if it wasn't for that cheesy note. The cheese character really is quite subdued in the flavor (just so long as you aren't particularly inhaling as you take a sip of this brew) and is only noticeable at times. Still the flavor finishes a bit too metallic and a bit too thin to really keep me interested."
"D - An alright ale, but not a great English Ipa. It has subtle hops and agressive carbonation - a kind of palate cleanser, if you will. Not too strong at 6.1 abv but suitable for style. Not extremely inviting, a shade on the bland side. I might not seek it out, even though it is as good as some bitters I have tasted, decent."
"D- I really don't like this. Just very weird flavors for me and it just seems like none of it goes together."
"This is a honey-colored beer with thick, white sheets of lacing that stick like crazy. It gives off the aroma of honey, clover, cracked grain, and grassy hops. The mouthfeel on this beer is quite striking, chewey and grippy. The beer is a creamy blend of herbal hop, bready grain, camomile and other tea flavors, and bitterness that creeps in just at the end. In fact, the artfully subdued bitterness is the only thing that might keep this IPA down in the score for taste. I expect a little more bite."
"While an American consumer seeing IPA on the label might have the expectations let down a bit, this is overall a very good beer. I comes across more as a hoppy pale than an IPA, but again, we tend to be spoiled by the typical American overkill. But if it's a pale, it's a damn good one. Very easy to drink, and very enjoyable. I'd definitely buy this one again."
"Drinkability- A nice birthday beer to have. Wasn't thinking much going in, but was pleasantly suprised. Tastes like a cross between and american and english IPA. Doesn't have the normal stale taste I usually equate with the english style. Bright, tasty and a pleasure to drink."
"Picked up this pint in New Jersey. Pours a big creamy head on yellow. Lace in glass. Aroma is metallic, as if it was poured from a can. Taste is thin, creaminess and burnt. There is a moderate bitterness and a ignificant maltness overtaken by the burntness. This was not finishable."
"One of my favorites."
"Pours with an apple-cidery hue superimposed on a bright pale ale, with a collar of foam and tons of sticky lacing left on the glass. Big, beefy aroma for an English style beer, with some funky/earthy hops and smoky malts coexisting uneasily. Minty aromas crop up as well. On the tongue, robust pale malts (smoky flavors mixed with caramel malts) bump up against a surprisingly bitter and acidic hop attack. Some nice bready flavors come out toward the finish, along with some metallic notes. This IPA has a lot going on -- lots of different flavors and sensations. Mouthfeel is brash with hop oils, big carbonation, and thick malts. Overall, this is a rather Americanized version of an English IPA, but it's still a good beer. Well made, imbalanced but flavorful, interesting and tasty."
"I know that the english IPA is another animal far removed from our own in the US, less malts, hops and ABV- but that shouldnt mean a sacrifice in flavor. The pour and aromas were promising enough, great sticky head followed by piney hops and some playful fruity malt. But on the first sip- nothing. Slight malts, more grassy than expected, earthy finish. Flat hop profile, no character, just watery bitterness. Usually a fan of Belhavens brews, but this one comes up very short."
"Taste is of toasted, burnt oak. Bigger malts on the tongue than hops for an IPA (stupid scots, i forgive them though). It's different than most american IPA's and definately tasty. Feels light, dry, and bubbly on the front of the palate, leaving a hoppy finish. I'll probably have this again at some point...good complexity and very refreshing."
"One of the best English IPA's that I've ever had... refreshing more so probably because I had it right after the Belhaven Wee Heavy. What a contrast - 2 great but very different beers."
"Pours a hazy pale orange color with a foamy white head that leaves sticky webs of lace across the sides of the glass as it recedes. Nose is dry grains along with earthy and grassy hops. Taste is toasted malt along with smoky peat followed by an herbal hop bitterness. The peat is rather unique in this style of beer, but it seems to work very nicely in this particular brew."
"Drinkability: Very good. Good, balanced taste, great visuals and aroma, good mouthfeel."
"Really enjoyed this English IPA. As my first UK IPA, I thought it was very flavorful without being overly hoppy or bitter as common with American IPA's."
"a mellow, flavorful brew. Quite decent."
"Copper in color, with a pillowy head. A little yeast in suspension too. Earthy hops in the aroma with some caramel and a slight hint of smoke. Smoky peat flavor with the earthy hops leading into a nicely bitter finish. Also noticing some orange zest. Pretty dry finish and really refreshing."
"Was able to give this one a try the other night on tap. The brew poured to a orange to copper color with a fair sized head that surprisingly had a good amount of retention and did leave a fair amount of lacing down the whole side of the glass. The aroma was nice, clear hop scent but it was not overpowering at all. Also was able to pick up a biscuit scent that seemed pretty strong which seemed to mute the hop aroma. For some reason this is what I have grown to expect from a English IPA, more rounded out than our American brews that seemed to be serious hopped up on hops. Either way I love both styles and am not sure that the differences are just something that I am perceiving or not? Anyway, back to this brew, the taste was very good as it has a smooth quality to it. A strong hop taste is noticeable up front but not sure if that is because I was expecting it from the scent of the brew. It did seem to break away from a dominant hop start to have a nice malt flavor in the middle. Over all this is a nice drinking brew, one that is not out of balance and one that I feel would be a great session brew."
"Drinkability: Yessir. This is a keeper. Goes down smooth and calls for another."
"Bottle- Aromas of floral cascade, perfumey hops, pine, and citric rinds. Pours a deep amber,with a solid white , two finger cap, with pretty lace. Tastes pretty piney, bitter, lemon zest, bready matls towards the end, and the challenger really give the cascade a go. This could be the first UK IPA that I actually really like. The UK, and an IPA?? Who knew?"
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Medium body, slightly slick. Good drinkability."
"Overall, who would have thought the Scots could make such a nancy tasting mellow English-style fruity IPA. It's easy drinking and tasty, but the fizzy palate ruins the whole experience. Kinda reminds me of all the peppy annoying fat high school girls I knew that smelled like fruity crap. Comparable to sniffing girl's panties. Always an interesting proposition. I feel dirty. I need a rauchbier."
"Poured from a 1Pt, .9oz bottle with notches on back label that I assume are dating but cannot interpret. Nice amberish, honey color with a good couple fingers of head that slowly dissipates to a constant thin head. Good lacing throughout. Smell was hard to pin down. When first poured, I got a citrusy smell with hints of lavender but as the beer warmed the overall smell faded to a non-distinct, light malt smell. The mouthfeel was awesome - very creamy and full bodied. IPA's have not been my style in the past but have been growing into the style lately and could see this in my semi regular rotation. Highly recommend (4, HR/RR, T,Y)"
"Drinkability: Pretty easy to drink. Not overwhelmingly bitter."
"Belhaven's Twisted Thistle pours a clear amber body with glowing golden highlights beneath a massive head of rocky white foam. The head retention is excellent, and it leaves beautiful rings of lace that are reminiscent of ripples in the sand on a pristine beach.Citrusy (orange, mild grapefruit) and gently pine-like and spicy hops greet you in the nose. It's medium-light in body, and smooth with a restrained carbonation. Bready and lightly caramelish malt acts as the base of the flavor, but it's quite fruity above that with both yeast character and hops kicking in notes of apple, orange, apricot, and both dark and light raisins. It finishes malty sweet but drying, with a dollop of lingering honey and some mild piney and spicy hop character. A beautiful, interesting and unique beer! Clean, fresh, hoppy, malty, perfectly balanced, and easy to drink!"
"drinkability is good. hides its alcohol fairly well and is well balanced. very enjoyable drink."
"It is a fantastic beer. It was an IPA all right, but it had that distinctive Scottish quality wherein the hoppiness is subtle but at the same time, pervasive. I am already looking forward to my next bottle."
"Clear orange with a big, fluffy white head. Thick lacing and good retention. Pleasant biscuity malt aroma with lightly citrus, earthy, spicy hops. Bitterness is pronounced, but much more balanced than an American IPA - the bitterness appears mild until the finish, where it really pushes forward and lingers. Malt kicks things off but fades quickly, followed by refined citrus hops. Fine bubbles, moderate carbonation. A little dry with a medium/light body. This is pretty nice, well balanced with plenty of hop character."
"Bottle: Poured a clear amber color ale with a bug white foamy head with great retention. Aroma of dry and bitter hops is dominant and enjoyable. Taste is dominated by the dry and bitter hops with some caramel malt backing. Body is about average and carbonation is quite lively. This is like a hops induced bitter and overall quite enjoyable."
"A fine session ale. Very well put together. Surprising Scottish take on an IPA."
"This is well balanced and very drinkable brew, And I'd get this one again."
"This would be a great session beer for me -- I might grab a few more bottles."
"Very drinkable, pleasant, clean, and refreshingly bitter IPA. Very sessionable, and conceals its alcohol content very well. Would be a great introduction to hoppier ales, and would make decent crossover fare and serve as a great introduction to its bigger and bolder US cousin, the American IPA."
"D - I'm enjoying the fresh hoppiness of this one. Sometimes IPAs (esp. English style) seem to come off as bitter without a aromatic hop presence, but not this one."
"Pours a crystal clear amber with a bubbly off white head that laces quite well. Aroma is a blast of cascade hops and grapefruit. There is an earthy smell as well, almost like a hidden off-smell, barely there though. Taste was one that would make British troops smile in India ages ago. Plenty of grapefruity hops, some bitter-sweet chocolate, sourish malt and a huge lengthy dry hoppy finish. Sharp peppery carbonation, not over-powering and contributes to its refreshing character. The relatively high ABV is very well hidden. This is the best Belhaven beer I've had for sure."
"The Scot's have always been stingy on the hops (they don't grow there, and historically they were taxed heavily)... so this is a pleasant surprise!"
"Very nice and balanced! Everything matches, the hops, the malts, the ABV, carbonation, even the price. Would drink consistently and goes down easy."
"Poured a crystal clear golden color. Voluminous white chunky head that proved to be fairly long lasting, and slowly fell to a rocky coating. Modest lacing. Smell is fairly mild with a bit of piney hop notes and some bread-like malt also present. Taste is dominated by a strong hop bitterness tempered by a light sweet fruitiness. The ending is more of the dry hoppiness and is a nice finish for this beer. Nice and drinkable, but the big bottle starts to get a bit boring."
"This is a good rendition of an American Pacific north west APA and fanciers of that style will like it. Ample out front NW hopping, sturdy malts and a satisfying 6.1%ABV ...very drinkable and satisfying."
"500 mL bottle. It pours a golden amber with light carbonation and a finger of off-white head. The aroma is perfumy and vinous, with soapy, almost piney hops - very English. It also tastes quite English, with buttery malts, perfumy, spicy, almost minty hops that leave a medium bitterness, and a touch of crisp apple in the back. The body is medium and smooth, leaving a medium finish and it's overall quite nice with good usage of the hops. One that I may revisit at some point."
"D: Easy to drink, but not the first beer i would order."
"Medium amber color. Aroma is sweet and hoppy. Taste is kind of crazy, a good amount of hops, then a honey mead taste, followed by a strange plastic-like aftertaste that I couldn't place. The aftertaste is the worst part, but the rest of the beer is so good that I can overlook this. Very drinkable, not too heavy and very interesting, something different for sure."
"Drinkability/notes: An interesting interpretation of a familiar style. Well worth a try."
"Amber color with a white head leaving good lacing, some yeast chunks floating. Floral, little caramel background, medicinal. Cardboard and caramel with a weird hop twang and a sour aftertaste. Average carbonation and light bodied. I would probably try this again because I think I got a bad bottle, but this one was not very good."
"Wonderful take on an IPA"
"Poured a slightly murky, orange color with a thin, soft white head that dissipates quickly and leaves behind just a hint of lacing. Low to moderate level of carbonation with some big bubbles covering the surface. Aromas of earth, alcohol, mild hops, and juicy fruit come to mind. The taste is well-balanced with sweet malt & fruit flavors balancing the soft hop finish. The hops are soft and rather mild without floral or grapefruit/citrus aromas or flavors. Suprisingly creamy and textured in my mouth. Smooth and yet crisp, pairing nicely with my pasta in a spicy tomato sauce. Flavorful and well crafted but not overly unique or special. I wasn't interested in another, though I enjoyed the bottle I drank."
"Last swigs: Apricot and dirt! A tough IPA. Had a bad bottle that is not reviewerd. Hop head draght dream."
"I bought a bottle after reading some decent reviews. I poured this one into a tulip glass and it had a very nice orange-brown color. Little flecks in the beer reminded me of ""floaties""; not a good start. The smell was weird and I could not quite place it. The taste was so bad, like the last reviewer said it was medicinal. It reminded me of an old shoe with the sole lit on fire and melted asphalt poured on top. One of only two beers I have ever poured down the drain. I stupidly purchased two bottles so now how do I get rid of the other?"
"Smooth, somewhat oily mouthfeel with light carbonation. So unlike American IPA's, this tastes like Snapple Tea, just as it smells like Snapple Tea! No detectable hops at all.	 Malts aren't easy to discern either. This really does taste like tea, and not a beer at all."
"A decent example of what English IPA's should be all about."
"Pretty easy to drink, but not one I will seek out."
"Coppery/dark orange beer topped with a gorgeous frothy off white head. Unusually for a British IPA I can actually smell the aroma especially of the cascade hops, spicy and light grapefruit..some good malty aromas too. Great fruity hoppiness, tingly on the tongue then smooths out for a creamy malty finish, yet the excellent hop bitterness persists down the throat and in the after taste for quite a while. Very livelly taste..a ""zing"" and a great boost to the drinkability. I liked this a lot..a great American style IPA with a delectable British feeling..well done Belhaven."
"Still, it wasnt completely unpleasant. Not my first choice for this style, but drinkable and refreshing enough."
"This is a nice English IPA, and seems like they are leaning in the direction of an American IPA with the hop bitterness and flavor. I could drink a few of these."
"Mouthfeel is nice and creamy and medium bodied. I really enjoyed this beer. A very very pleasant surprise and at only $2.29 at Peabody's, an absolute steal!"
"VERY easy to drink. Not overly hoppy. I'd suggest this to someone who may be new to the IPAs, or to anyone who enjoys IPA. I'll definitely be drinking this one again."
"The taste was very smooth I was amazed right away how good it was. The taste was biscuit like and sweet along with the citrus and spice flavors along with some earthy and grass like bitterness(Challenger hops) in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is what got me at first it is extremely smooth and easy to enjoy. Its medium bodied and full of taste a new favorite IPA."
"I would like a newer bottle of this Scottish Import before giving it a bad name."
"Good carbonation, maybe a little on the light side. I only wish I had bought more."
"D: Pretty good drinkability. The malt sweetness may wear on me a bit though"
"Paired with some Piper's Pub...Shepard's Pie...appears a clear copper light off white head leaves fine even lace with thick bands of evenly coated lace. Aroma contains mild funky character with a UK tone doughy malts and an air of piney and floral hop aromatics with a must filled earthy dankness...I likes. Flavor biscuit and toasted crackers mild ripened fruit note hops scream English to me but there's also a layer of citrus in there who knows? Anyway the UK IPA brings a funky tart bitterness full of more piney, earthy, and floral hops onto the ol palate. Mouthfeel has a smooth carbonation easy going light - medium bodied IPA. Drinkability...well, what's not to lake when downing this beauty with some of the best Shepard's Pie on the map flows easily down the gullet you may just have two pints of this one."
"D - Good, due to the balance. It's a somewhat big beer."
"Mouthfeel is fine as the local keeps the gas turned down quite low. Excellent drinkability, and a great beer with food."
"Notes: The best English IPA I've been lucky enough to consume. Maybe because its more aggressive than most from this style and more tuned into my American Hoppy taste buds? Yeah maybe....A completely differnt type of ""Hoppy", you can forget about citrusy, bitter hops, this is a dry saaz type effect. it is a welcomed addition to my stable."
"Super drinkable unconventional IPA from Scotland. To unique a beer to not try."
"A well balanced brew with good flavors. Not the recipe I'd use as an ideal IPA for my taste, but a nice offering."
"Cascades are pretty noticable in the smell, as is some malt sweetness. The taste is very well balanced. Chewy malt up front, with a little bit of notocable bittering hop bite at the end. I don't think this would pass as an American style IPA, and it's not an English 'Fuggley' type of bitter, either. Regardless, it's certainly a nice brew. Not overpowering in any regard. Mouthfeel is fantastic, creamy and full. Carbonated, but not overly so. It's tough to find anything wrong with this beer. I would rate it higher if the malt and hops were kicked up a notch, though."
"Drinkability: I was pretty impressed by this. This is a style I need to have more of, because I'm really a fan. I'll be having a pint of this again."
"With a (slightly) less assertive maltiness and a more assertive hoppiness, Twisted Thistle could easily be one of my favorite English IPAs of all time. These guys already brew one of the best wee heavies in existence, so I'm not surprised that they were able to nail this style as well."
"Not bad. Definitely worth a try, and I'll probably pick it up again eventually. Not what your looking for if you want a really all out hoppy IPA."
"Very mellow all around. I've had better."
"Pours a clear copper under a one finger white head with nice consistency and excellent retention (there was still some head left when I finished the glass). The head clung well to the glass, leaving some very nice lace. The nose is wonderful - absolutely full of pine hops. The mouth is very prickly and fairly light, yet manages to stick well on the palate. Classic American IPA taste, despite its British origins, with sweet syrupy malt upfront, followed immediately by strong coniferous hops spice and bitter. Very smooth, despite the strong hops, which hit the finish with a great espresso and pine sap bite. The bitter lingers long after the liquid is gone, coating the jowls and tonsils with a lovely dry sensation. Only the second IPA I've found in 3.5+ years in Moscow, this is my kind of brew. Yum!"
"Drinkability: Quite sessionable, if a little on the boring side."
"This beer poured a clowdy amber color with a single finger head that lingered for a bit and left someg good lacing. The aroma is a bit piney in my nose yet also a bit sweet. Just what I am looking for. The taste is first some malty sweetness and then a kick of floral hop bitterness, mixed together well. The carbonation is medium and makes for a fairly drinkable brew."
"As much as I love a an all-out American hop-monster, I really appreciate a well-balanced British-style IPA. This one isnt top-notch, and the American hops are a twist, but its a worthy attempt, and didnt disappoint me at all. It pours a sunset-gold, not-quite-copper color, with a modest head. The aroma is a well-balanced mix of hops and malt. Floral, fruity, sweet, caramel. Theres also a notable smoke character. Its drier than expected, and a little metallic. Modest carbonation. Medium body. The whole package is quite satisfying."
"I didn't have high expectations going into this beer, but I was pretty impressed with it though. The smell isn't anything too dazzling, about average for an IPA, but the flavor was quite impressive, especially the after-taste. This beer is not in your face with hops, but most of the flavor comes with the undertones, the hops and malt work together to mix a variety of fruity flavors, and it's kind of on the dry side which also mixes well. It's a bit cloudy in appearance with an average head, and it got a bit yeasty at the end. This was a pretty good IPA, I am going to try it again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a big, fast moving carbonation that races across the tongue with each sip. It ends up being a tad bit too bubbly for me. Drinkability is quite good. Much more outwardly hoppy than many English IPA's I have sampled, I could see myself having a few of these in a sitting with no real problem. Nicely balanced while still providing plenty of hoppy goodness."
"Pours a one finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a little lace. Cloudy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Piney nose. Starts almost with a malty sweetness, smooth, hops are here but not in your face, finish is mellow. Very good IPA but McEwan's is better. $3.05 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"500ml is way to much of this tragedy. Oh the humanity."
"This is a great IPA, much more hops than usual for a UK version. Its well balanced too, maybe my fav from this brewery."
"This is my first English IPA and thought that this was a good brew. I look forward to trying other beers from this brewery."
"Moderate carbonation with a clean, almost thin to medium body. Taste onsets with some initial hop bite and alcohol astringency and tapers to a earthy, grainy finish. This is pretty bitter up front. The finish reminds me of an unbalanced pilsner. I guess this is what to expect from an English IPA? Not much experience in this arena, although IPA's are another thing. I wish I had the beer vocabulary to describe what it is that ruins this beer for me. Ruin is a bit strong of a word. This isn't a bad beer, it's just not great."
"Mouthfeel is very full and sticky. Carbonation is high, but not enough to cut the thick malt. Drinkability is reduced as a result, but I would still love to drink more than I should. I was pretty skeptical of a Belhaven IPA but they did a great job with this one. Plenty of Scottiish malt character with enough hops to satisfy most american style hopheads."
"Rich fruit cocktail hop aroma, with hints of spruce and dried pine, as well as hints of red apple and caramel. This IPA is mellow and balanced, and I like the hop character. Its not medicinal or floral at all, like other English IPAs. On the palate, yellow banana peel and red apple notes are present, with fine and sharp hop flavors coming in on the mid-palate. A heavy body comes next, with hints of caramel. Pretty good."
"Drinkable enough, but nothing special for the style. Worth a try"
"The beer pours a hazy dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a nice bitter hop bite. It's creamy with a slight peated aroma. The taste is great. It has a smooth, malty flavor that is complimented with a bitter hop taste. It is dry with a smokey feel; very nice. The malt flavor is quite complex and well balanced. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a damn good English IPA. It has good aroma and a wonderful flavor; a good drinker."
"Taste is unlike any other IPA I've ever had. An initial citrus bite on the tongue hints that hops are present after all. This is followed by and finishes with a roasted maltiness that leaves me wishing for more hops. While this one starts strong I don't enjoy the finish and can't say I'll be going back for more."
"Drinkability is pretty good and condering travel on the import, the beer holds up pretty well. would be intrigued by a draught version."
"good drinkability, though possibly not for everyone there is a lot of smoky peat in this one. very unique and very good in my opinion though."
"16.9 oz bottle poured into a tilip pint. The beer is a lightly coppered orange color with a finger with a little haze. A finger and a half of white head falls to a full coat over the liquid. A very healthy cascade of bubbles flow from the bottom of the glass. The nose is moderate in intensity, with caramel and toasty malt notes dominating, with a crisp lightly citrusy and mildly earthy hop. I like the mild hopping with the malt forward for the English IPA. Flavor is very nice. Definately reminds me a bit of the Belhaven Scottish with the peated malt character being very prevalent in the first sip. The caramel character is much more subdued. Hop notes are light citrusy sweet, but definately not a dominant part of the flavor. The finish is a nice combination between a good peatyness and a clean caramel sweetness. Feel is on the fuller end of moderate, with very mild carbonation. I like the fullness, as it gives me a feel of having a nice substantial brew. Overall, I enjoy this one. The peated character is not too strong, and balances well with the caramel and light hopping. This is a beer I will visit again. Very tasty."
"Poured a rich deep golden with a nice creamy white two finger head that slowly settles leaving a sheet of lace behind.Aromas are English all the way herbal ""green"" a little minty over top of caramel malt seems to have a hard water elemant as well.Flavors are mild compared to the American more hop driven IPA's,herbal and a touch earthy with a big caramelly sweet malt base wich is just as big as the hop character.This is as balanced an IPA I have had not bad but I want more hops in my IPA I guess."
"This one poured a light amber color with a small head that was gone quick and didn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma had some toasted malt and quite a bit of European hops. The flavor was much the same. Lots of Euro hop flavors along with a toasted malt character. Interesting. The body is medium and the drinkability is ok."
"I went into this beer with high hopes and was quickly shot down upon first sip. While I am a big whisky fan as well as an IPA fan, the 2 simply do not mix. The peat was just overpowering and mixed with the hops, it just was plain awful in my book. This soon ended up down the drain. Managed about 2 sips and that was all. Color was nice with a great head but appearance is about all this beer has going for it."
"A orange/amber beer with a slight haze. Has a big creamy off white head and plenty of good lace. The aroma starts as soon as you open the bottle and a distinct piney hop character jumps out. There is also a light orange citrus note along with a caramel malt in the background. OK this IS a Scottish version of an IPA. Because the first thing you get in the flavor is a strong peat smoke character. Then the english toffee flavors come in followed by a light dry piney hop finish."
"Interesting and peculiar. Hopped to the extent that American IPAs would exhibit, but with the English variety. Moderately malty, caramelly, vanilla, and toffee. The hops impart a woodsy (oak), earthy, and a plastic character that's evident in the nose and flavor. Lightly fruity: from peaches and apricots to dates and nuts. Alcohols are light, lending a warm and drying nature to the body and finish. Good beer, just a little peculiar in the hop characteristics."
"M&Dr - good medium body and solid carbonation. Slick on the tongue and leaves an all around good feel in the mouth. I really like this brew. I'm going to be keeping some in my cooler."
"D- Im not sure about this beer. I can't tell if there was supposed to be that unique band-aid flavor, which was not nearly as strong as some homebrews with infections, or if it was another flavor of malt that I wasn't expecting in an IPA."
"Drinkability  The herbal flavoring takes some getting used to and I didnt see that big smoky character advertised anywhere on the bottle, but me likes it. Also, the label says that it has Cascade hops, but damned if I could find them. Why would you put Cascade hops in an English-style IPA anyway?"
"Poured out a light copper with a large, frothy, white head. Decent lacing throughout. A very hop-forwarded nose. Tons of cascade and challenger allow the malt to come through. This is one delicious beer. Lots of citrusy and resinous hops at first which lead into a peaty malt, followed by a pleasently lingering hop bitterness. I only wish that the malt would speak up a bit more, aside from the smokiness. The mouthfeel is full with a good amount of carbonation to liven up the palate. A truly unique IPA."
"Taste is hoppy, of course. Grassy. Pine. A tad harsh, but overall very good."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel- just the kind I like in a beer. Overall, a nice IPA on a Saturday afternoon."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"Poured a clumpy white thick head. Alot of thick lacing surrounds the glass. A clear dark orange in color. A very strong finish. Has a creamy texture and is not watery. Has a very bitter taste but doesnt finish that bitter. Leaves a clean dry aftertaste. A medium bodied IPA that has a much different taste than the classic IPA. It's mouthfeel is much stronger than the actual 6.1 ABV. Its drinkable, but I couldnt see Myself drinking more than two. Hints of lemon and citrus are noted. A sweet malt and nicely carbonated."
"Overall: The Cascades and Challengers add a very definitive US feel to this IPA, yet the peaty malts are definitely Scottish, the blend of ingredients from either side of the Atlantic is very clever an make this an intriguing combination, but for me it works extremely well. This is a fine US-Scottish IPA. Quietly impressive!"

"Overall- what is with the Scots and their smoke flavored beers? I enjoyed all the other characteristics of the Ale except the smoked hops!"
"Notes: Not quite as carbonated as it looked in the glass. The smokey taste wasn't preceived at all in the aroma. Not quite as hoppy as I like an English IPA. Interesting blend of the American and British Hops. Aroma blew me away. Sadly, the rest of the beer wasn't as impressive. Good nontheless."
"Opinion: Well, to be honest, if I were to have tried this beer as a one ounce sample from the ""Beer of the Month"" for my brew club...I probably wouldn't have tried it again. The first sip is pretty harsh, but after a couple sips...you get accustomed to the background flavor. It's not so objectionable now. I would probably have another one, but this is not my favorite beer."
"Nice pale amber color with a great big fluffy white head on top. Great columns of rising bubbles. Very nice aroma-somewhat grassy and ""catty"" to use a Britsh term. Faint grapefruit aroma. Good malty flavor with a mellow hop bitterness to it. Theres a somewhat plastic flavor in there that knocks it down a peg. Good body. A very enjoyable beer-one of the better English IPAs I have had. I know they're not like US versions but some are quite limp all the way around. This one stands up well and is damn good."
"The color is a hazy copper with a high level of carbonation. The off-white head is large and thick. The retention and lacings are excellent. The aroma has a perfumey, lightly citric hop smell with an underlying sweetness. Enjoyably subtle. A sip starts with a the perfumey/citrus hops. The flavor is somewhat milder than expected. Towards the middle of a sip the flavor is lacking, then a strong bitterness takes over. A dry hop flavor comes in at the finish. I'm wondering if I got a bad bottle or something, the rest of Twisted Thistle's reviews are glowing, but I found it bland and lacking malt balance. Plus the hop flavors didn't wow me either. This is definently something I'll try again down the road just to see if I was missing something great."
"Overall Impression: Wow, this one is different. Not over the top -look at me-look at me- different, just a lot of subtle notes that werent expected. They all fit together very nicely and have me thinking about trying to brew a Smoked IPA. Have to give this one a strong recommendation, good taste, different direction. Bravo!"
"A strange mouthfeel sensation with this one...a very ""powdery"" character. It's hard to explain, but caught me off guard. Don't get me wrong...it's not bad in any way. It's different. Nice level of body and the carbonation is right. Relatively low ABV. Very flavorful and one I'll purchase in the near future (if only to send to AKSmokedPorter, as I know he wants to try this one). I drool at the thought of trying this on cask."
"Lo, and behold, a Scottish IPA and a fairly well-done one at that! Citrusy hops fill my nostrils as I quaff this golden ale. The flavor of hops is present, too, mixing well with an almost sticky sweet maltiness, accented by a wisp of smoke. The finish is more spicy then bitter and the lack of an assertive bitter finish is a bit disappointing. Overall, this is a very drinkable IPA and I applaud the Scots for experimenting with American hops."
"Mouthfeel is soft, smooth and medium. A very drinkable, sessionable English-style IPA. I tried this earlier on-tap and found it rather plain but the bottled version is far better, much cleaner and vibrant. I could easily session this, but only from the bottle."
"Drinkability: Probably my favorite british IPA to date (besides the 1800 that was brewed in Minneapolis). Very good, try it, you american hophead."
"On draught, I recall this being rather ordinary, more bitter but tasting more like an ordinary American IPA. In bottle, it's definitely a Belhaven beer, with similar yeast and malt character, except with more hops. Top notch beer!"
"A very tasty IPA, an ingenious mix of U.S. and U.K. takes on the style. For a brew with a tongue-twister of a name, this is amazing easy to love, for a hophead like me, and will easily leap into my must-buy list."
"Medium amber, orangey, and essentially transparent. Tight white foam at over 1/4 of an inch. Sudsy complicated laces, nice-looking. Aroma of fresh hops (Cascade and Challenger), almost citric with grass elements. Lighter body and medium carbonation. Malts are not really identifiable, give way to hops early in the profile. Bitterness builds, senses of rind and the teeth chattering pith (even approaching a too harsh graphite character). A little unidimensional and even ""North American"" but no signs of oxidation or papery fade (but there is a slightly off cheap cologne impression in later sips). To its credit, the flavor is stubborn and holds on well. A pretty decent rendition, just not a standout to my mind. Nice looking brew though."
