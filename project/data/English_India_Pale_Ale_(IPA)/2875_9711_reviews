"appears a medium copper color with head that fades fast.  mild, but pleasant hop aroma - a mix of  citrus and pine/earthy.  taste is well balanced with some caramel malt flavor to balance the bitterness.  medium body and carbonation."

"O: Excellent.  Been a while since I’ve had a traditional IPA, and this one nails it. Bought in NC, drank in New Hamburg ON.  Wish I didn’t have to rush this one, but I have a flight today and limited luggage space."

"The feel is good, a medium body holding some firmness and a steady carbonation allowing for a nice flow between a crisp bite and congruous smoothness."

"The Flagship IPA poured a nasty unfiltered amber with thick white head that is leaving a lace. The scent and taste are synonymous with most English IPA. I am pissed that this beer has chunky yeasty balls in it which means I will not finish it. The taste is bitter and not too bad from what I have tasted. Would like to try this off the tap to avoid the stuff that gives the craps!"

"Overall this is a straightforward, not over the top beer that is easy to drink. The nose seems a little off, but otherwise I enjoy it for what it is, a good IPA that could be sessionable in the right situations."
""
"Real nice balance of malt and hops.  The taste has a good caramel sweetness to start and then the bitterness comes on and lingers, really well balanced.  The aroma is mostly floral, not much of the malt gets through.  Overall a pretty good English ipA."

"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable, just a touch too much ABV and bitterness to be sessionable but paired really nicely with the mediterranean food."
""

"O: Ok, but it tastes faded, the date from Total Wine says 12/14/12. I'm guessing that is the shelved date (I reviewed this beer Jan. 23) so it shouldn't be THAT faded."

"For an English IPA, I would expect more balance. However, it's still a decent IPA, probably better on tap."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, with light carbonation, a medium body and a slightly bitter malty finish that's on the sweet side. Average overall, so I wouldn't seek this out again. I like hoppy American IPA's better, but this was worthy of trying while in NC."

"D: This was a decent English IPA. The scent and taste were fitting for the style, but not really my preference. The body was very nice, but the finish was a little harsh, so it was not the easiest to drink. Nice to try once, but easily forgettable."

"Pretty good IPA, I liked this one a lot. Good hop character without being too bitter, works for me better than just a hop assault. On top of that, thirst quenching and almost sessionable."
"O: a fine English style IPA."
"Ran across this at Margaux's in Raleigh, North Carolina. It's a clear quiet amber/copper color with just a breath of some little white bubbles on top and modest lacing. The nose picks up a nice citrus nutty pine. The flavor follows suit but adds a peppery grass that’s a little on the harsh side but not bad. Carbonation is sharpish, very fine and body is between medium and light. Drinks easily and is pretty refreshing with a tingly feel that maintains fair constitution. The citrus bread flavor holds on through the finish. Definitely worth a try as a satisfying hop refreshment."
""
"For me, this is a nice local (North Carolina) IPA that meets IPA standards and is worth a repeat (and it comes in a can)."
""
""
"This is a decent, balanced, intriguing beer. The crispness and spiciness work well together to add an extra degree of drinkability. I will definitely have this again."
""

"Plenty hoppy enough for an English IPA. Light enough to accompany dinner without overpowering it. Not bad at all!!"
"I throughly am enjoying this beer at the moment. It poured a a nice light brown color like most other IPA's. Nice foamy head that settled after about a minute. Leaves a good lacing down the side of the glass. Nice smooth taste yet still has the bitterness you would expect from an IPA all in all a farily good beer."
"Now here we've finally got a decent beer from these guys. This one is not bad."
"I know that some may say it's not fair to judge this beer because it was probably pretty good leaving the brewery. Carolina packaged this beer in their own labeled clear growler that is very spoil-prone then they deserve this kind of review. Beer people know that clear glass is terrible for protecting beer and that's why even BMC prefers to package in cans or at least brown bottles, but a naive consumer might think that a growler-packaged beer is fancier and higher-end. They would've spent good money expecting a good beer to only be disappointed by something that should be poured out. I think this is awful and Carolina should be ashamed of putting such a poor product on shelves. The retailer, Total Wine & More in Raleigh, shares some of this burden of shame too, but I had other growler beers from that store and they were fine. This was definitely Carolina's fault and I hope that they would address it. I will contact the company shortly"
"With that said, however, the body was decent; moderately thin but decently carbonated. I still can't get over the lack of hops. If you like this type of thing, it would drink well I suppose. But I'm not a fan. With the bitterness there and nothing to complement it, I'm glad I only got a sample or it would be a tough time finishing a pint of this."
"D: A decent IPA, not one that I'd seek out on a regular basis but as a vacation refresher it works."
"d- very drinkable. goes down smoothly. would have another anyday. delicious but not overly impressive compared to other IPAs"
"The brew drank real well I sessioned the growler myself through out the course of a night. I enjoyed every drop and it went well with all the appetizers' available. If I was at the brewery I would gladly do the same"
"Drinkability: pretty decent IPA. if you are looking for immense hop bitterness and flavor, this beer does not have it, but more of a mellowed hop character. still very drinkable."
"Yet it fascinates me primarily for the simple reason that I've never had a beer which so reminded me, in taste and particularly in aroma, of upper-middle grade weed. I got the second growler just to see if the first was an aberration, but no ... the effect is like sticking your nose in a ziploc bag of kind. I recognize that this would be polarizing even among pale ale fans, yet when I assign the adjective ""dank"" to this brew, it's intended as a compliment."
"with a balanced abv, you'll be able to enjoy this beer over and over again...good enough for me to get a growler on the way out!"
"On tap, this beer poured a nice copper color with a 1 finger head. The smell was not overpowering but there were faint aromas of citrus, hops and malt. The hop profile is not overly drying and I found myself ordering it again and again. This was a very easy to drink IPA. Get it on tap if you can find it."
"An overall good beer. Not quite as strong as I exepected, more like an apa. Nice honey color, good hops smell. Good taste, nice grapefruity hops, slight spice malt backbone. Great drinkability. A really good session beer. Better than Carolina pale ale IMO."
"drinkability: very easy and smooth. and goes great with salty snacks"
"It truly is a tale of two halves in the taste with heavy malty, bready notes up front and suddenly the hops kick in out of nowhere. The second half saves this IPA. Spicy, piney hops with a citrus finish. Not heavy but powerful enough and more split than balanced. Mouthfeel is overly thick at first but thins out nicely. This is an easy drinking IPA that won't please true hopheads but will easily quench a thirst on a Saturday afternoon."
"Flavor picked up my impression a bit, with some good notes of zesty, citrus hops, biscuity malt, and a touch of tropical fruit. Mouthfeel was well carbonated, nice medium thickness to the body, and left behind some excellent residual bitterness from the hops. All in all, a decent summer beer, but this won't become a brew I'd seek out on a regular basis."
"Soft and medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Good drinkability."
"It was OK but not up to the standard it usually sets. I'll have to re-review this next time I get over to Chapel Hill in hopes that I can be more positive."
"Overall, this was a decent and simple brew, but it doesn't have enough depth to it to make it stand out."
"Drinkability: A beer that decided to err on the side of light, easy drinkability, but, as it offers almost no flavor or depth of character, I dare wonder what's the point."
"Bright golden amber in appearance. White head falls quickly to some sticky lacing. Light fragrant aromas of pine, green leaf/grass, and malt. Tastes of slightly bitter piney hops, grapefruit, red apple, and some grainy malt. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied and nicely carbonated. Drinkability was great. Went down quick, very sessionable. Definitely growler worthy if you get the chance."
"Served a nice pale amber with a thin head that diminished to a ring and left no lacing. The aroma was very weak, some citrus hops, but not strong at all. The taste was quite interesting. It was a little on the sweet side for an IPA, the malts overpowered the hops, but the hops did show through nicely in the finish. To its credit, the beer did get hoppier as it was finished. The beer was light and crisp and somewhat easy to drink, if it only overall tasted more like an IPA."
"Had this at the brewery location, poured by the staff. Not very impressive looking. Sort of flat looking. Leaves a minimal amount of ""lace"" on the glass. Is a brown color. Actually looks almost identical to the Brown ale they had, but with worse carbonation. Smells very earthy grassy. It tastes pretty good though. Has a nice balance between the hops (not sure of the mix, a little like cascade, but something else in there too) and the malt. The mouthfeel is actually much more syrupy than I had expected. Overall though it is a tasty beer and I can enjoy drinking it."
"Not a particularly complex IPA, but very solid and enjoyable. Poured an orangey-varnish color without any head. Nose was just slightly of hops. Flavor had a nice malt base going on. Hops provided some citrus rind and Christmas pine, but there is just a slightly unappealing varnish flavor. Mouthfeel had a nice medium feeling body to the beer. Enjoyed a couple pints of this offering."
"Pours a coppery golden color with a thick, foamy white head. Smell is light citric hops with a sweet caramel malt background. Taste is light floral and citrus with an oily mouthfeel. It ends with a sweet but mild caramel malt, and leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste that is gone quickly. A highly drinkable IPA, that is not quite as complex or hoppy as it's main North Carolina IPA competitors (Hoppy Hour and Big Boss), but a good attempy none the less, and I definately see the English IPA style as being apropriate."
"Its been a few months since I had a real cask ale so I ran to the tent yesterday serving it up.this poured a rich copper with a nice creaminess to the head.Aromas of caramel and some nuttiness hops were not as prevelant as I thought but it was appetizing enough.Taste is highly hopped but it didnt knock me out with em there was a nutty malt presence in the background that I picked up keeping it from going over the edge.A worthy cask ale my first NC on the engine very solid and well made."
"Big thanks to Loki for the growler!"
"Drinkability - The combination of the sweetness with the hops makes for a bitter but smooth brew"
"Notes: Solid session IPA. This is definately one of Carolina Brewery's most popular beers. They don't brew a Pale Ale, instead they brew a mid-grade IPA that is a very good beer."
"Overall, a solid IPA. Big thanks to AKSmokedPorter for bringing a growler up to Ohio!"
"On-tap at the Carolina Brewery. Light copper in color. Thick and long-lasting off-white lace coats the glass. Prominent notes of grapefruit in the nose. Very nice. Flavor is HOPPY! In your face, teeth-rattling bitterness is all that comprises the flavor. Nothing so much as shows itself to try to tame the hop landslide assaulting your palate. Almost to the point of being unbalanced. Finishes very bitter, with a splash of grapefruit juice squatting on the palate to remind you what this is made of. Biting mouthfeel but still drinkable. Not for the faint of heart."
"Crisp and hoppy in the nose, this beer is bright and bitter, with a nice clean finish and slight floral and fruit notes in between. Solid all around, but nothing to really sing about. Still, I liked it and I'll have it again."
"Very hoppy but still balanced more then some IPAs. I wouldnt recommend this to someone who isnt a hop head though."
