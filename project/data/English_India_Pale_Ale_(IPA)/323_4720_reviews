"Beer poured a nice light clear orange color with a white head the quickly disappeared. The bottle clamed ""Aromatic"" however I found there to be little aroma. A nice balance of malt and citrus notes, just really had to search for them. Taste was nice with a touch of sweetness from caramel malts balanced by a good dose of bitterness. Some citrus notes at the back of the palate. Medium body that finished a little bit o the dry side making the beer very refreshing. Overall a very sessionable, balanced beer."

"As per other reviews. Lovely beer."

"The taste is acrid to the point of it being like eating the pith of an lemon, not the zest that so many have clamored."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber, similar to a brown oak leaf.  Normal head, lacing and retention. Nice nose of light sweet citrus (pear with lemon notes) over biscuit with a mild caramel note.  Light medium body with a hint of slick texture.  Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence on the finish.  The taste profile, while nice, is average in intensity, very well balanced and above average in complexity.  Where it excels, is in the flavor profile that surrounds the bitterness, especially for a low 4.2% alcohol content.  It begins with a flood of hop flavor (citric, rind and Noble) over light biscuit.  Mild bitterness follows in the middle from the classic English Bitter profile coupled with a citric rind twist.  As the bitterness diminishes, biscuit with caramel notes come forward.  The finish has just a hint of dryness that leaves you with a light grapefruit rind bitterness that lingers and leaves the tongue tart with a distinct mineral note."

"Overall, this is a pretty good English Bitter but it also doesn't have much to make it stand out. I do enjoy the bitterness which I feel is a little more than in other examples of this style."

"Pours clear orange-golden beer with bubbly off-white head. Smell is not very intense, more hoppy, than malty. Taste is semisweet with zesty hop note, due to last hopping with Styrian Goldings. They promised twist of lemon on a label, it actually is not so strong, but pleasant. Commonly low carbonation, excellent summer beer."

"this is what the label says it is, a refreshing citrusy pale ale with a classic english or shall i say scottish grain bill. golden and clear in color, with a honey shine and a big white head. it looks pretty solid really. the nose on it is a little citrusy, but way too sweet for me, more earthy grain than is really necessary, and a stale bread profile that may reflect the age of this bottle. the taste is about the same, but there is a very definite lemon flavor in the finish before the sweetness sets in. its a nice breakup of the heavier flavors, but the sweetness still comes back in the end and really kind of ruins the refreshment the hop profile had set up. fuller body for low alcohol is also a little unflattering in this one, but not a bad beer overall, probably delicious on tap at the source ice cold and fresh on a hot day."

"O- Mild, but it does have ""like the twist of a lemon"" down."

"500 ml bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly hazy golden straw color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, light honey, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of bright hop and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, light pine, bread, cracker, light honey, and floral earthiness. Light floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, pear, apple, grape, floral, grass, light pine, bread, cracker, light honey, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of bright hop and malt flavors; with a great hop/malt balance, solid robustness, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a very nice English pale ale. All around well balanced hop and malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall - A very well crafted English IPA, that is light refreshing and eminently sessionable. Definitely worth and fans of the style may have themselves another beer to add to their rotation."
""
"Final Grade: 4.08, an excellent A-. I sincerely regret not picking up a bottle of Harviestoun's Bitter & Twisted years ago when I first had the chance. It is extraordinarily flavourful for a beer of such low abv, but not to the extent that I would be worried about tiring out my palate with multiple servings. This is a remarkably sessionable EIPA/bitter that I would not hesitate to recommend to any fan of pale ales, English or American. Perfectly suited for the warm months, although it would probably be a treat any time of year. Give this one a shot; you won't regret it."

"Crystal clear pale gold color with tons of bubbles running up from the bottom of the pint glass. Head pours cream colored but fades almost immediately. Smells extremely earthy and bready with a very faint hop presence and a not too subtle sweetness. Although I LOVE the taste of this beer. The hop is noticeable but not anywhere near what I'm used to in American IPAs. Present but not over powering. The yeasty/biscuit notes are wonderful and there's a slight sweetness that has to be malt derived. It finishes extremely clean and has almost zero aftertaste. I could definitely see myself drinking more of this throughout the summer months because of the 4.2 ABV and easy drink-ability along with the great taste. Really glad I finally decided to pick this beer up for a try."

"Bomber poured into a pint glass, golden honey colored and a wisp of a head. Some nice, initial lemon zest, lavender, orange blossom aromas, very pleasing and delicate. The initial taste is not too bitter, actually more tart/sour than bitter but that said not overly so, and with a hint of sweetness. Some mineral flavors balance out the floral qualities, and it's a bit heavier than I had expected, with a consistency that comes close to a cream ale. The dry hopped taste stays with you. Very drinkable, above average, and a good price on the sale table ($3.00)."

"Overall â€“ It is rather refreshing and has quite a complex taste for such a light bodied brew. A good one to try."

"I don't reckon this is too bad; a decent sipper that I'm in no hurry to get again any time soon."

"Overall: winner of several CAMRA Awards. If you can find it, try it, totally worth it!"
""
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of floral hops, grass, dry hop, sweet malt, caramel malt, and a hint of pale malt. Fits the style of an English Pale Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. There was also a noticeable bitterness/dryness associated with the feel. Tastes of dry hop, floral hop, sweet malt, slight pale malt, and hint of caramel malt. Overall decent appearance, aroma, and blend."

"500ml bottle. Pours an orange amber hue with good medium slowly fading white head. Aroma is of caramel malt, citrus and lemon, yeast with some citrus hops. Taste is sweet caramel malt with some nice citrus lemon flavor and some mild bitter citrus hops. Palate is a medium body with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a sweet caramel malt, yeast, with some nice citrus lemon fruity flavors balanced with some good citrus hops. Overall a good, tasty and enjoyable brew"
"O: Nice unique beer with a great bitter and slight sour taste, still its middle of the road enough to go well with British or Scottish food, fine by itself or with marmelade, minced meat pie, Haggis, Fish n Chips, etc. Great name, fun label with the mouse mascot."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is listed as an EPA, but it has more Pale Lager characters, with the zesty finish. Even the bottle notes 'zest added by Styrian Goldings hops'.... Too zingy, too spritzy to be an EPA. Add half for price point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent, but not as good as i remember this to be. Hard to beat at the pricepoint out here at $4 to $5 a 500ml bottle from the shop, but otherwise nothing to get excited about going off this sample."

"From the cask at the Rake. Pint, 3.8% abv. Golden colour, cloudy, small head, some lacing retained. Aroma was hoppy citrus, Cascade? Tasted quite bitter, slightly fruity, notes of cooking apples, wheaty finish. Smooth texture, low carbonation, body slightly thick. Overall good character for the low strength even if it was slightly watery, very good summer session ale."
"Taste is nice, balanced, well-rounded with bright, strong bread, grain, herbs, lemon rind, yeasty juiciness, peppery bite. It has clear bitterness with balancing light sweetness. It is generally subtle and gentle but very complex and engaging with wonderful aromatic zesty bitterness."
"Good - a tasty blonde! The aroma could be a tad more pronounced, but the flavour is nice and hoppy while retaining balance. Would perhaps benefit from bottle-conditioning to improve depth. Crisp, refreshing and well worth sampling if you have the chance."
""

"A very pleasant beer, lots of flavor and decent complexity, good balance and a refreshing body and finish. Very enjoyable. Only way to improve might be to up the florals and maybe upping the assertiveness, its still high by uk standards so I quite enjoy it. 4"
"Overall a nice and refreshing, balanced ale."
"O: This beer is extremely easy to drink and very sessionable."
"Poured from a 500ml bottle. Another great UK example of a small but really full-flavoured brew. There are big grapefruit and malt aromas up front that seem to promise quite a bitter IPA. However, the flavours and mouthfeel are incredibly balanced. The very creamy texture finishes with an earthy (English-style) hop hit. While we were initially expecting ""super bitter," this was quite subtle. Definitely a session beer."
""
"Carbonation seems a little high, and the body seems somewhat watery."
""
""
""
"500ml bottle. Tumbler glass. Enjoyed on decÂ´11. Pale golden in color, quite cloudy appearance. White, close & dense, froth with some lacing spots. Noble hops to the nose. Crispy upfront, dry bitter, lemon zest & slightly malty flavors. Medium body, medium/high carbonation. Astringent lemon finish."
""
""
"I've had quite a few of these lately. Magic with seafood. Near perfect session beer."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber with a decent white head. Crisp, sharp aroma is mainly malty with a fruity undertone and just a touch of hay. Flavor is quite malty with a hay/grassy undertone and a hint of fruit, mainly apple, and bitter and spicy whispers. Fizzy yet smooth texture has slightly above-average body."
""
"Not bad. A little thinner in flavor than I like, but the bitterness is nice. A drier ale than expected. I'm ok with this."
""
""
"Overall this was a nice refreshing beer, just nothing that was particularly great."
""
"O - A rather refreshing beer after a long day of work, good crisp finish"

"This is an enigma of a beer. The smell made me think I was in for a powerful malt bomb. A really subtle taste, but still flavorful and dynamic. And you can throw them back without worry at AVB 4.2%"
""
"Aroma was nice citrus hops, hints of buttery malts, pineapple, light grapefruit. Well balanaced. Clean, consistent and crisp flavor. Biting hops up from of course followed by a nice buttery malt. hints of grass and bready notes"
""
""
"Overall: Nice fresh hoppy beer, refreshing for a summer day. So much flavor for such a low BAV beer. A true IPA, shows to the US brewers that you dont have to over do the hop flavor profile. Bigger better faster is not always the best"
""
"Not completely successful but has enough going for it be a pleasant drinking experience."
""
"I dunno how these guys do it. They brew the ""basic"" styles so well. Gotta try these beers to see how good you can make supposedly ""lesser"" styles. Probably the best ""English"" IPA I've had, unless you count Little Creatures effort. I appreciate this beer more than the score might suggest."
"Overall (3.5): A hoppy beer that caters to both the pro-hop and anti-hop crowds. Not overpowering hop flavour but definitely not shy or hidden. A drinkable and refreshing offering."
"O - Yeah, I cant recommend this but it's not horrible."
"Pours a clear golden copper hue which leaves a creamy fast vanishing two finger head and creamy lacing,the smell is herbal grassy hops and some honey malts thats it,the mouthfeel is light and watery and has tastes of honey malts,herbal grassy hops,fresh cut grass,pale malts and finished with a mix of herbal grassiness and toffee and overall i definately would not buy again and the bitterness is only very light avoid cheers."
"Quality."
"Hazy golden amber with little carbonation and an oilier mouthfeel than anticipated for the low alcohol. Pleasant aroma of grains and malts. The flavour adds caramel and resin notes along with a decent dose of bittering hopes. Ends with a nice, dry finish."
"Overall a very drinkable, simple, (and not terribly interesting) session ale."
"O - enjoyed this more than my description seems to indicate."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"would make a good summer session beer, priced right at 4$ here in Calgary"
"O- The fresh pale malt sweetness is a nice support to the full hops flavor that has nice depth and no bitterness. This is a very easy to drink session beer."
"O - This is a surprisingly tasty English IPA, it's flavorful, sweet and zesty, and has quite a nice kick to it. I could easily have another."
"A highly sessionable ale that would be a perfect accompaniment to salty, spicy or fatty foods. Would pick up regularly if it was available in my area."
"On Cask at Town Hall Tap in Minneapolis. This beer arrives a bright golden-yellow color. The head is one inch of bright white foam that never recedes, and leaves rings of lacing down the glass until the beer is gone. The aroma is of lemons and limes with a hint of pale malt. The taste is similar to the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a silky texture, and appropriately low carbonation. Overall, this is a great beer that I could drink all day long without growing tired of it. This is the kind of beer that I wish more American breweries would produce."
"Cheers!"
"Has tastes of lemon zest, hops, malt, yeast, plastic, rubber, more hops, bacon grease and honey. A little too small in abv for an IPA, in my opinion. Could've been fruitier too and cleaner and dryer but it the trick justly. Be patient with this one, ok?"
"O- a nice brew, I could see myself cracking one of these on a summer day. Freshness info would be nice, as I imagine this was quite an old bottle."
"O: I had no idea the ABV was this low in this beer, it drinks more like 6%, it has the body weight. A nice session pint, but nothing super interesting."
" Serving temp. 44 degrees F."
"Overall a nice refreshing bitter where the spicy hops dominate the pale malts."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer, as I have most of the beers the Brick Store has put on the beer engine recently. Better with cask conditioning than on tap in my opinion, it's very easy-drinking and well worth a shot."
"Tried this from a Cask at Tap & Table in Emmaus PA the first time I was there. I wouldn't have said that this beer was an IPA when I first had it. I thought it was along the lines of an English Bitter with the twist of lemon added to it. After seeing that it's an IPA I suppose the citrus quality it has isn't such a drastic jump from one stlye to another for the beer. The color was a light copper with a nice smooth looking head that left lacing down the glass. The beer was ultra smooth going down. I'm not sure if I really liked the flavor of this so much. The lemon was a little overwhelming for me personally. This beer would be ideal for summer time drinking."
"On cask at Tap and Table in Emmaus. It's always a pleasure to find a lovely cask ale and this didn't disappoint. Sure I've had better, but it was a fine session beer at 4.2%. There was mellow toast malt flavor with spicy lemon and grapefruit hops. It's mild and drinkable, but still quite satisfying."
"Still this is a great mild packed with flavor and aroma right out of the cask."
"Poured a golden blonde with a small head that turned to film rather quickly. Smelled pretty unassuming with slight malt character and soem zest, nothing impressive. Tasted crisp, bit of sharp bitter bite right off the bat, bit of citrus and some biscuity malty dough flavours. Light bodied but not watered down at all, nice crisp, refreshing and leaves the palette clean and dry. Overall a solid beer to have with food, or on a nice day. Nothing special but very well crafted and a great Drinkable beer for anyone."
"D - Extremely drinkable, on its own or as a session."
"Dr: It's nice enough, but pricey. Won't have it again."
"D: Not a bad beer, like that I've tried it, but nothing special."
"Food match: I dare say the national food of the UK would go down well with this (i.e. a Curry). The previous national food (Fish and Chips) would also work well."
"Beer is thin and has a graininess to the back of it but overall the beer is fine. It's not hoppy and its not an IPA, it's a grainy bitter that I doubt will have again."
"Drink - A highly sessionable beer that I am happy I tried. It tastes like a toned down American IPA. I'd buy it again."
"The flaovr of the IPA comes through in a very English kinda way. But the strength and dryness speaks only timidly of an English Pale Ale or strong Bitter."
"D: Good, light, and indefinitely drinkable at 3.8%. Recommended above most other British beers; it has more character."
"Pours a clear golden colour with nice white head and some lacing. Smells of strong floral hops with fresh grassy notes as well. Maybe some lemon and bread malts. Flavour has a nice hit of bitterness to it, but nothing over-the-top. I would almost peg this at a bitter instead of IPA, but that could just be the classification on this site. A nice session beer. I would love to try this on cask sometime."
"Drinkability: This is a refreshing, easy drinking beer. While it is moderately complex and quite drinkable. Each sip follows the other quite naturally and I was quite happy to pour myself a second glassful, especially at this low ABV. I think this is mis-categorized as an English style IPA but I'm not quite sure where it belongs instead."
"Well hopped beer. A nice beer from Scotland for the Hop Heads! Color: dark gold, partially translucent with sediment in all the glasses where beer was served. Foam: median formation and duration. Citric and floral aroma. Taste: bitter (provided the hops), very well balanced with malt, and despite the large amount of hop, not only bitterness dominates but also the herbal, floral and citric. Dry and bitter end. High drinkability. Good for hot and cold days."
"d - A very easy to drink beer you could have a few of, but I won't really want to. I didn't think it was bitter at all really, and thought the smell wasn't very enjoyable. Wouldn't order again."
"Great use of hops, I'm not a huge fan of the English variety, however the noble Hallertau blends in well with them and creates a winner. I liked it much better than I thought I would after the first couple of sips, probably one of my favourites of this particular style now."
"Drinkability: I suppose this could be an English IPA, but I almost think it fits the category of an English Bitter as a better fit. Regardless, it's a refreshing beer on a hot day - the lemon/citrus gives it a nice zing. It went well with a meal (Asian fish an broccoli over ramen noodles) and I could drink it by itself with no problem."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange with a slight head. The aroma is light, with a bitter orange edge. The flavor starts slight, very little malt and not much up front hop. But slowly the prize develops - a deep citrusy bitterness that coats the lips and tingles the tongue. More than makes up for the superlight body. Mouthfeel is slight."
"Notes from 02.16.10 at Oliver Twist in Stockholm"
"Contrary to what most folks overseas would think and even contrary to what I would normally suggest, this is one that is excellent when consumed at lower temperatures, where it provides a wonderful hop profile that helps make it one of the best low-alcohol IPAs around. At normal drinking temperatures it fades into marginality, but when cooler the 4.2% ABV makes it one of the most drinkable and characteristic IPAs out there."
"A very good IPA, almost American in taste."
"Now I get this beer. I have had this several times in bottle form. I have never really enjoyed it. Though on cask this is great. If you see this on cask, it is something I highly recommend."
"D - Definitively a pub ale that can bring you back for more. Don't judge this one on appearance alone."
" Pretty average stuff, but it had a hard time peaking my interest."
"Its slogan - ""like the twist of a lemon"" - is the only thing I'd change about this beer (sure, there is a subtle, enjoyable lemony element but a finely crafted ale such as this need not rely on gimmicks). Apart from that, I reckon you'd be foolish to think you could improve on a beer that is so vibrant, so well crafted, so flavourful and so exceptionally splendid."
"D--A very sessionable beer. The bitterness at the finish is nicely refreshing and at 4.2% it wouldn't be tough to have a few."
"1PT .09 FL OZ bottle served at 48 degrees in my SA Perfect Pint. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured a hazy, golden-orange with a quarter inch sudsy bright white cap that quickly dispersed into a swirl and a thin band around the edges. Only a few specks of lacing revealed during the session. Nose reveals some toasted malts, a hint of citrus and a light hops presence. Taste consistent with nose, but also a light soapy quality in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a crisp carbonation. Decent, but somewhat nondescript. Worth a try, but not worth seeking out again unless perhaps it is available on cask."
"500 ml bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear gold color with about a half inch white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is light citrusy (lemon peel) hops, and a bit of bready malt. Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, it's all citrusy hops and some malt. With that being said, the aroma and taste are subtle, but really nice at the same time. Mouthfeel is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and oily and has good carbonation. Drinkability is very good, and I think this would be a very good session beer. Very easy to drink and low in alcohol, too. It wouldn't be hard to drink quite a few of these at a time. It's a good overall brew, it's nice, refreshing and enjoyable to drink."
"D: would definitely drink again, a very nice ale"
"Pours as an orangey amber with a soft creamy white head and lots of carbonation. The aroma is lightly spicy with a hint of orange, and a slight syrupy sweetness. The last is bitter and very fruity with loads of orange and lemon. The feel is a bit thin but well carbonated. Really nice beer, very refreshing and fruity."
"A very pleasant, well put-together beer. The label denotes several hops varietals, and the care taken to layer the hops was evident. Up front a bit herbal, but cleaned up and finished with a citrus note. Not as lemony as the label suggested, but citric nonetheless, with just a touch of tangyness to invite another sip."
"drinkability is good. nice balance. decent depth. a nice english ipa."
"taste is of lemon, lime, glassiness you can really taste all the hops that are brewed in this beer. also, there is hint of a maltyness that is like roles"
"I didn't know what to expect with this one being used to AIPA ADIPA and BIPA, but I was expecting something a bit... hoppier.. this almost tastes like bitter orange rinds with a tiny hint of mollasses in the finish. Smell is is almost like an a citrus wheat beer. This beer is almost too mild. It poured quite bubblely with a thick white head and an brownish orangeish color. Mouthfeel is sort of watery, not alot feel too it.. I just couldn't get into this beer, I wonder how other beers in this style compare though."
"Drinkability: It would be hard to hide the fact that I'm a fan of this beer - it's crisp and refreshing and it's definitely bitter, but it achieves a subtlety that is often dismissed in favour of brute hop force by other IPAs. The neck label proclaims it as the ""World Beer Awards: World's Best Ale", and while it might lack the complexity necessary to lay undisputed claim to that title, I can understand what those judges must have been thinking at the time."
"Quite a drinkable little IPA. Crisp and refreshing. Not sure if it's ""World Beer Awards: World's Best Ale"" worthy, as it claims on the bottleneck, but it is pretty good."
"Clear yellow pour with quickly fading head and no lacing. Really unique nose. Grassy rye earthiness with a nice hint of pepper that reminds me of Orval. Wonderfully unique, complex taste that features the rye from the nose along with a toasty bitterness balanced with a touch of lemon sweetness. Very crisp and dry and totally drinkable. Planning another trip to Scotland just to get some more of this great beer!"
"Drinkabilty's good since this is a pretty tasty brew with some balance and plenty of character and the ABV is low."
"This is a superbly drinkable beer and quite a good thirst quencher, very sessionable at a modest 4.2%ABV to boot. I definitely recommend this fine flavourful brew."
"The mouthfeel is thin and smooth to start with some light courseness in the finish."
"D- An easily sessionable brew that isn't packed full of flavor but is still easily enjoyable."
"Very good and easy to drink. Well-done."
"Maybe not the 'World's Best', but a nicely bitter and drinkable English-style ESB/IPA hybrid. The peppery character was a bit of a surprise, but a nice one at that. I would definitely have this again."
"Yeah it's alright. A tidy little bitter that doesn't offer a hell of a lot on the nose but delivers a crisp medium carbonated fresh mouthfeel with some of those zesty lemon notes as promised. Some of the malt base you'd expect from a UK beer. Surprised how summery it is. I might come back to this when it gets a little hotter."
"Poured cold into a tall glass on a hot summer day, this one is a slightly hazy iced tea color with a steady stream of bubbles with some white floaties and a goodly creamy off-white head. The lacing is substantial as well. The aroma is malty herbal hops, sort of a bitter rye quality. The flavor follows with all the same qualities. A fair citrus hop with some of that herbal overtone, maybe even a bit heavy floral. There's a toasted rye bread sense over smooth mellow lemon. Thin to mid bodied and decently drinkable. Refreshing while interesting to the palate. I was pleasantly surprised and will happily revisit. Nice stuff."
"I would like to try this fresh in a cask form considering how it's already pretty good from the bottle after being imported. A solid Bitter. Recommended."
"Really solid appearance, and really full complex nose. Flavor also offers some complexity relative to this style. Other flavors offer a nice offset to the hops. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Notes: A really tasty beer. The lemon note is pronounced. Could drink a lot of this, especially if it were on draft."
"Fairly light body with low carbonation. Very smooth. The long finish makes you feel as thought its coated your mouth. Very sessionable at 4.2%ABV, and tastes good enough that you'd actually want to session with it. This ones a winner."
"D- As drinkable as they get. Nice all round beer with every reason to try, drink, and repeat. Great session."
"This was way more bitter than i expected. The taste of lemon mixes perfectly with the hops and makes for an refreshing drink. Interesting!"
"A highly refreshing and drinkable beer with a unique lemon twist. I really enjoy this one."
"D - Very drinkable. Provided it's only 4.2% abv, this is a perfect alternative to stronger IPA's."
"D- This was a great beer. Not going to be top of it's class as far as an IPA but very drinkable. Great session beer."
"Overall, not an extraordinary beer but a good beer for the summer. Very thirst quenching!"
"Poured into a mug as a slightly hazzy golden color, with a finger of bubbly white head. Smell is floral and citrusy. Low carbonation and light feel, but leaves the mouth dry. Taste is somewhat sour - like a grapefruit sourishness - and you are able to taste some leafy hops. Decently drinkable, despite the odd sourishness at the start."
"Overall, another nice brew from Harviestoun. It started off rough with the appearance but gradually got better from the nose to the finish. I found everything subdued in both the smell and the taste but this served to increase its balance, crispness and drinkability. Next time I see this, I would definately buy another."
"A good example of the low end or non-extreme IPA."
"Poured with a murky gold appearance with a full, thin lacing on the side and minimal retention. Floral citrus lemon flavors were apparent in the aromas, along with a leafy hop smell. Taste is a little thin but maintains a slightly sourish flavoring mixed with bready malt. Again, a bit thin but refreshingly light. Overall, not too bad."
"Drinkability: Not recommended. A bit like Lemon Pledge. Finishing off the pint was a long, grueling task."
"A tad accrid bitter to be sessioned, but deffinately something I'll have in the frisge on a hot summer day."
"Drinkability - it's definitely refreshing. I'm afraid that for the price and availability in my area it's a little prohibitive to have too often. Nonetheless, an enjoyable and very nice pint."
"Overall - This is a nicely balanced IPA that definitely leans toward hop dominance. The malt profile is light and the hops add good flavor, aroma, and bitterness."
"Low carbonated mouthfeel, making it pretty drinkable. This is one of the best light alcohol beers I've had."
"A highly sessionable ale, needless to say one doesnt notice the 4.2% ABV, but does notice the bitter and twisted character from the hops. Note that this is perhaps more of a hoppy pale ale than an IPA, but what the hell, it is a hop forward session ale from the other side of the pond. Recommended, and something i would enjoy during summer if only i could get my hands on a fresh supply."
"Medium bodied, not as thick as an American IPA, with a pretty low carbonation. THe mouthfeel does a lot for the refreshing quality of the beer."
"Drinkability- very tastey hop beer from scotland, very aromatic and easy to drink, low alcohol makes it great season beer and one that does not come up short in the least in flavor and complexity long finish, give it a try worth shot"
"Thin creamy white head that evaporates swiftly, minimal lacing. Pale golden color with a fine gauzy haze to it, much brighter yellow around the rims. Very hoppy nose of of cracked bulgur wheat, lemon peel, dried pine oil, very light peach and apricot pit fruit, overall has a big initial punch then trails off after that. Medium-bodied with full, bubbly carbonation, fills the mouth through the attack. With grain, wheat, green grasses, bitters it's lean but stops short of turning biting. Moderate kick in the lemon, white grapefruit citrus. The apricot, peach, nectarine fruit livelier and sweeter here, almost teases out some malty cocoa notes. Once the foaminess subsides it's very smooth and creamy. Good unforced length."
"There is definitely that sweetness on the palate, only here it's not a pleasant character that backs up the hops but rather a stickiness that lingers throughout the palate, taking away precious taste-time from those other beer flavours. There is a slight bitterness on the back palate but not as much as I would expect from something with bitter in its name. Front palate is a bit dusty and then that slight sweetness kicks in which actually just has the effect of toning down the flavour a bit. This isn't a very fat-flavoured beer (or phat-flavoured beer, for that matter), there's a simplicity that makes it not so drinkable - although the mouthfeel is a bit fuller than the flavour and quite nice actually. Nothing particularly nasty in it, just a whole lot of meh. At the risk of raising a few Scottish nationalist hackles, it's really typically English ale-y. Tasting this after Old Engine Oil I'm quite disappointed, I must say."
"Drinkability: This is nice, an ale that drinks like a lager, even at cellar temperature!"
"So much debris left in my glass..."
"D- A flavoursome refreshing pale ale. Interesting enough for a session and easy enough and refreshing to drink that you dont have to think too much about enjoying it!"
"Noticeable differences from bottle to bottle ranging from lemony to woody - is there some bottle conditioning here? Balanced and very drinkable. Good hops fix in the UK."
"Somewhat yellowy-orange in the glass, this develops a decent, bright-white head containing loose bubbles before fizzing away leaving behind a small amount of lace. There's a bitter aroma that has some citrus, and a sharp lager-like twang to the smell that was rather unexpected. The taste, however, is nothing short of wonderful. Moderately sharp hops all around with a pointed flavor of grapefruit and lemon, falling mercifully short of the brutally over-hopped pale ales that seem to be everywhere these days. Nicely understated, and beats the pants off of just about any ale of this type I've ever had, American or British. Light carbonation and low alcohol make this superbly drinkable, and there's plenty of complexity to warrant several return trips."
"Put simply, you'd be hard pushed to find a bottled beer more full of character - the polar-opposite of bland commercial lager."
"The beer itself is quite light bodied, very refreshing, and only modestly carbonated. The lemony spritz, which the bottle dubs as zesty, says it all. The beer has a lemony, slightly grapefruity, and maybe a bit of orange burst as its most pronounced characteristic. There is a very nice bittering English hop right underneath the zest, and just a tad bit of cracked grain huskiness lingering around the edges. This is a really enjoyable, very drinkable, English Pale Ale, that is definitely nouvelle-ish, and not traditional in its interpretation at all. Worth seeking out, nice mouthfeel, with a nice English style bittering hop aftertaste. L'Chaim."
"This is the story of a little beer that lost its way. After being bottled, the brew master promised it would go to a good home. However life would not work out so well for this crisp golden beer with a very thin covering. I say its a good thing it leaves a quickly dissolving lacing and film on the glass to add extra protection. Without much carbonation that protection seems to wear out quickly and leaves it vulnerable to the likes of me. A beer loving-drinking enthusiast. I was first attracted to this beer by its very floral, hoppy and citrusy scents. Loured me into pouring it into a glass and to try some. Unfortunately this is where the story gets ugly. At first sip it was intriguing with its combination of sour lemons and hoppy vibrance. But the bitterness that is left when it leaves is a bad note to go out on. So be it to say that this beer didn't find a good home for I didn't really enjoy it because of the real bitterness finish makes this hard to drink. Even with its delectable scent and light bodied smoothness in your mouth."
"The aroma is full of grapefruit (my favorite).The taste is great like grapefruit juice but no extreme pithe bitterness , hop bitterness does linger but not for long . The mouthfeel is light and refreshing . Drinkability is off the charts for me grapefruit light beer no extreme pithe bitterness loved this beer ."
"Smooth and easy to drink, very well made. A fine brew definitely worth an imbibe."
"This beer seems meant to be guzzled. Every gulp makes you want another, and the slight hoppiness leaves the hallertau flavor in your mouth long after each swallow. I'd stroll to a pub and have many a pint of this. Cheers!"
"At the end of the palate, it's quite watery, which is a shame, but it's a very drinkable brew. Of course, this beer is just another example to draw a firm line between the English IPAs and their American cousins (distant cousins). Still, this is one of the better examples, and it turns out surprisingly clean and refreshing."
"This brew has great drinkability, and very sesionable. I had a few tonight with dinner and it was very enjoyable experience"
"Finishes on a cloying/piney note. Hmm."
"But overall a good beer, just needs a new name."
"This may be a case of the North American palate not being fond of our brethren's style across the pond. But I do believe that other English IPA's (like Samuel Smith's) are rounder and richer than those in the States."
"I tried this beer on December 24, 2007 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured a translucent orangy-gold with a fluffy white head. The aroma was hoppy with some citrus and spicy tines in the mix. The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with mild carbonation. The flavour is hoppy with some grapefruit and lime flavours mixed in with the spices."
"500mL bottle purchased from LCBO several months ago when this was a seasonal release, though I never got around to reviewing it until now. But it has a best before date in January 09. Pours a pale gold with just a hint of haze. Nice, but reserved, hoppy aroma. Flavour is nice, a bit thin in the middle but with some warming English hop aftertaste."
"D: Decent drinkability but a tad bland and gets boring fast. Was expecting more from this and name is misleading. Take it or leave it."
"Drinkability: Quaffable, quite high in alcohol for an English-style ale, but all the better. Definitely could drink this as a session beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not filling at all, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink several of, if you're looking for a milder version of an IPA."
"Drinkability is slightly above average on this english ipa, but i do prefer most united states ipa`s to this particular brew."
"The first glimpse is a medium ambe with a little sunshine yellw glimmering through. Amidts the this coloring are suspended bits of sediment. The aroma is a light, bready malt, some mild hops citrus and a touch of mint. The first sip is a very mild malt bill. Definetly toasted with a bit of caramel malts. Then some muted hops, maybe minty, but definetly piney. The palate is a strong astringent mix of malt and hops. ery resiny palate. Not a bad beer to be your first right after work, wile you wait for your bar pizza to cook."
"I am pretty sure this is the first time I've had this beer. I would buy it again, but it is certainly a little cost prohibitive."
"Overall, a very nice beer. I would be a great one to have on tap at you local pub as it has a nice rounded flavor, yet low on alcohol. Too bad I will probably never have it again."
"Poured a golden, straw like color, with a huge amount of carbonation. It had a very hoppy scent, along with a citrus/lemony aroma. Excellent taste, a great malt/hop mix that starts very sweet (lager like) and ends up with a great hoppy, pale ale finish with a great bitter aftertaste, along with slight citrus/lemony flavor. It is an extremely smooth beer, it goes down great."
"the taste was a bit of a let down it was not bitter or twisted it was a little watered down with a slight hint of spice, their was a little hoppy aftertaste but nothing to good"
"Flavour is harsher than expected, with a lot of bitter, citrusy hops. Surprisingly sweet backbone. Smooth, but light-ish mouthfeel. Unexpectedly refreshing for the style - would make a much better summer patio beer."
"Bottle from the LCBO. Pours a cloudy yellow, with a small head, which quickly diminishes to a fine film. Aroma of lemony hops and freshness (if you can call that an aroma). Tastes bitter, but in a pleasant refreshing way. Also a nice lemon kick. Crisp, light palate. Enjoyable stuff."
"D = This is a very drinkable and approachable beer. With the low ABV could definitely use for session drinking."
"D - A pretty accessible hoppy ale. not terribly exciting but a nice refreshing brew."
"The spices are more evident on the palate. Also has some lemon, doughy bread and a bit grassy. I should have bought more than four."
"These guys can make a flavorful ale."
"Pours a very clear medium gold, a touch lighter than the average IPA or bitter, and with a very substantial pure white head that builds quickly and dissipates slowly, leaving a ton of lacing. Smell is sharp citrus and evergreen, nice and spicy with obviously English character. Taste is a bit unusual, lemon for sure and a hint of pine. Cracker-dry breadiness and a touch of marijuana for good measure. Mouthfeel is a touch thin, feels a bit watery, but drinkability is excellent. At 4.2% I could comfortably session this all night, and I'd certainly enjoy the opportunity to do so. It's a nice beer, not stellar but very pleasant."
"D: It's not really to my taste, but it's could certainly be sessionable."
"Bottle: Poured a blonde color ale with a small foamy head with limited retention. Aroma of subtle floral malt. Taste is a mix between some floral malt with some sweet notes. Body is average with some average carbonation. I was expecting something more complex or bitter based on the name of beer but I really thought this was bland."
"o) Attractive drink in its own right, but not a session beer. The perfumy hop notes preclude drinking too many."
"Real session beer, you can drink a lot of this one."
"Pours a slightly chill hazed amber, decently thick white head forms, sticks around, nice lace spirals. Smell is sweet, bready caramel malt, lots of grass, citrus/floral hops, slightly minerally, not bad. Taste is nice, caramel, grass, bready middle, light citrus and floral in the finish, solid bitterness. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation. Pretty solid IPA, super easy to drink, session all the way, and very refreshing."
"UPDATE: On May 23, 2009, I tried the newer version of this beer, ""Blond Beer"" now appearing on the label. I scored the newer version a grade lower for smell and taste. I also considered that the malts heavily outweighed the hops - although the label makes reference to barley, oats and wheat as ingredients with no mention of malt at all. Finally, the label also refers to a ""superb hop profile"" that includes Hallertau Hersbrucker, Challenger and Styrian Goldings to give it a ""sharpness like the twist of a lemon"". I can certify as to the lemon taste but the hops themselves seemed to take a back seat to the ""malt"" from what I could tell. Go figure, still an acceptable brew but nothing I would rush out to buy more of."
"Damn a really pleasant surprise. This one has no head but it smells like pot. A floral hoppy beauty. The first gullop lives up to the promise of it's bouquet. Yes. more. I like it.I will definitely buy this one again. it's been a long long while since I had such a definitely great new beer experience. i love pale ales and this is a great pale ale, but the bottle states ""Blond Beer"". Uhm why? Well who cares. it's what's in the bottle that counts. Or rather its what was in the bottle and is now in me gullet that counts."
"A wonderful example of an English IPA. Something I would likely seek out in the future."
"Very fresh smell. Hops come through as citrus fruit. Aroma actually doesn't tell the whole story, there is some nice bitterness that comes through right from the start. Grassy or piney and a real tongue coater. Bitterness lasts throughout, as the biscuity malt and fresh lemon come through in the end. Mouthfeel is good, maybe a little thin. Drinkability is high, this is a respectable UK ale that I would watch for next time I was in Edinburgh or whatever. Good and a little more bitter than many other Scottish ales."
"This is a nice beer, but I paid $5 for a 20 ounce bottle, which was ridiculous. Maybe it's always this expensive, or maybe it was the store where I bought it. It's better than average for the style, but since I can get a 6 pack of Rogue's Dead Guy for $9, I won't buy this again."
"Several weeks later, and bitterness is odd and British, but overall nice at this ABV."
"D-This is one damned fine sessionable brew. Mostly mild but with a good underlying bitterness throughout."
"An excellent refreshing session strength ale."
"I like the B&T a lot. It's a nice example of the English IPA. But fans of big, American IPAs should know that this does not fit that mold. It's lighter, mellower, and much more designed to be a pubican session beer."
"Drinkability: Again, this is best served cold. Not really an IPA in my view..."
"A nice English IPA."
"still think it could be a little more robust in texture"
"Overall a satisfactory brew, was glad to have tried it, and will definitely enjoy this one again."
"M&D: light-bodied, slightly spritzy, unlike the softer mouthfeel as in the past (allegedly, it was packaged with 1/3 less CO2 than most bottled beers...). Overall, although this is still a mild and easy-drinking Bitter (not an IPA to me, btw), it's less tasty and less hoppy than what I can remember from my last bottle (two years ago). Come to think of it, I might have to re-visit the cask version again sooner rather than later, to see if that has altered slightly as well..."
"This is trying to be that little bit different from the normal beers brewed in Scotland and isn't unpleasant, it is just not really for me. The scores are my honest results, I would have loved to give it higher marks for each cat, but it isn't a great beer in my eyes."
"Pours a nice crisp light orange with a decent lasting head. The aroma is of English malt and light earthy hops. The taste is a very interesting balance of sweet biscuity malts and light citrus hops. The beer is certainly light and crisp. This one is certainly different from the American brews I lean toward, but provides an interesting departure for a temporary change of pace."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"D - Okay. I am going to pass in the future, among the most ""reasonable tasting"" Scottish beers I have had to date."
"Golden color, thin head clung to the glass all the way down. Very mild saltine cracker flavor with floral/ earthy notes, a little hop bitterness on the front and back - light to medium bodied, and super-duper drinkability. Very enjoyable session beer, or a just getting started beer to get the malt pacifier in while contemplating the next bolder step. I really liked it."
"Had a pint last night off draft. Appearance is golden with white head that doesn't seem to last very long at all. Aroma is of lemon or maybe more of freshly bruised lemongrass. Lemon-citrus note carries over into the flavor. Some malt sweetness to balance. Subdued hop bitterness as well. Seems perhaps a bit thin, but pleasant in its own way. Tame at just over 4%, this should make a good session beer. Light, crisp, pleasantly quaffable. I think you could drink several of these and enjoy it. Not sure I would call this an IPA, seemed more akin to the big bottle Youngs that I'd consider more of a regular ""bitter""."
"Nothing that sets it apart from any number of other beers, but just a solid session beer."
"Cheers!"
"Looks pretty: golden with a slight lacy head -- good retention. Smells citrusy, grapefruit and lemon. Also a bready yeast to the nose. Tastes nice and bitter without being overpowering -- citrus and herbal hops, a sweet malt -- very pleasant for my palate. Light carbonation and thin malt make this a very drinkable beer. Not for those searching for a big body or overwhelming taste -- a nice break from the American IPA's, which can be a bit much for a quiet evening."
"Had this brew on tap last evening and it had a nice golden color, cloudy in appearance with a nice white head that had good legs leaving nice lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma was very inviting, great smelling brew with some different scents than I normally see from an IPA. The scent has more of a strong floral scent rather than a pine or American (grapefruit) citrus smell. The citrus smell that comes across is more like lemon zest also with a grass like scent, very inviting with the hops mixed in with toasted malts. The taste is very nice, this is a smooth beer with a hops noticeable up front but they are not over the top as citrus (lemon) is more evident with a sweet and roasted malt flavor. Over all this is a well put together beer, glad to have tried it on tap and will have to look for it bottled in the near future. Great session brew with the lower ABV."
"Bottom line: A very tasty Ale and at 4.2%abv, it is a great session beer. Good stuff."
"Bitter and twisted is a play on the Scottish psyche, I like the sense of humour. I wanted to like this better but there are a few pale ales I'd put in front of it. probably a lot better on cask."
"500ml brown bottle from Florian's. Translucent amber-yellow body with a good inch of white head. Smells fruity with just a hint of skunk. Citrus dominates the flavor with undertones of skunk... Light bodied. Somewhat drinkable, but the skunk hurts the aroma, flavor, and drinkability... An okay British IPA, but would be much better if it were not skunked. I've got to stop buying British IPAs in the States..."
"Other comments: It definitely deserves the acclaim it has received. A British Isles blonde that stands out from the usual boring ones."
"Very easily drinkable. A nice ""session"" IPA, though not a great example of the style."
"Drinkability: A true session beer. Nothing to here to wear out the palate. Goes down very clean with a nice bitterness in the end. Nothing I would go out of the way for, but I wouldn't dismiss it either. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours transparent golden yellow with a thin head that degenerates to nothing. Almost no lace and slow carbonation. You could mistake this for cream ale or relatively full-bodied macro. Fresh aroma. Grass and a blend of english, german, and american hops, with grapefruit and dusty orange notes dominant. Relatively hefty body, with very spare carbonation. Overly syrupy and still for a beer of this weight. Grapefruit, orange, and strawberry hop flavors in the mouth. Some bracing dryness in the finish makes the next sip slightly more desirable. Not a particularly winning combination."
"Drinkability: An interesting and refreshing brew. I really liked the way they used the hops. This one would go great with fresh seafood."
"Flavor is subtle as well, lightly citric, lemony, with a rind dryness melding with some grain in the finish. Light to medium body, with muted carbonation, making this smooth despite its lightness. Rather quenching. This may have been the end of the keg, but this is an excellent session IPA."
"Medium mouth that has plenty of carb and is very drying. Very drinkable. Full of flavor but with a very sessionable abv."
"Overall - A pretty good and very drinkable pale ale... worth a try..."
"D - Highly drinkable. I could quite happily sit down to several of these. Recommended."
"Overall a very enjoyable and hoppier than usual EIPA. A very nice session beer that would fit in nicely with some American IPAs."
"Overall- A beer that tastes much better than its initial presentation. Not as big as an American IPA but an easy drink. I enjoyed!!"
"I picked this up from Bubbles on N Oak in Gladstone for under $4. 1 pt bottle with a Champion Bottled Ale of 2004 from the Brewing Industry International Awards logo. Poured into an Imperial pint glass. Minor head, about a 1/4 inch thick. However, the lacing is good. Clear golden color and vary little carbonation. Smell is a pleasant grassy hops with a little bit of biscuity malt, but not very powerful. Taste improves upon the smell. Grassy and floral with a bit of citrus in the back. Mouthfeel is medium light. Borders on watery, but I will give the benefit of the doubt. Leaves a sour and slightly metalic aftertaste. This is good, and I will pick this up again from time to time."
"Boy, you can smell the hops not overpowering but definitely there. This brew starts off tea like but ends with a pleasant fruity floral hop signature. Nice low alcohol and mild mouthfeel make this an all around good session brew."
"The beer pours a gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a nice pale malt scent along with a wonderful hop aroma. It's dry with some yeast fruitiness. The taste is decent also. It has a light pale malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes weak and quite bitter. The malt content is low while the hops ring true from start to finish. It does have a citrus hop aftertaste which emulates a lemony profile. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good brew, although it's not my favorate IPA/ It's got pretty good aroma and taste. The focus here is simplicity with the grain bill and attention to the hop character. Overall, a good drinker."
"i've had this a couple of times now, and it shaping up to be one of my favorite english (scottish) beers. i guess i could put it this way, it's got american amounts of what i like in an english beer... if that makes sense."
"I'm assuming this came out of a bottle since that's how it was listed, but I was never brought the bottle. Appearance is average, straw color, not a whole lot of head. Appealing hop aroma, with some fruitiness. Not as much bitterness as I expected, but a strong fresh hops flavor. Little bittering hops, lots of dry hopping? I guess it's an English IPA, not an American, so it suits the style. In the aftertaste, a little grassiness comes up. Might have spent a tad too long on the dry hops, maybe? I liked this one, so did the girlfriend."
"~R"
"This one pours a very clear and light amber color with a very small head that doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet with hints of caramel and something a little 'strange,' but that could be a yeast byproduct with some mellow hops. Almost reminds me of a tea smell. The flavor is very soft and subtle. There are some British hops in there as well as a little caramel and a hint of spice. Interesting, to say the least. The low carbonation gives it the feel of a hand pump beer. The body is very light and the drinkability is pretty good."
"Tried this on on tap. nothing overly exciting or remarkable about the head or lacing. Pouring a blonde color the nose hinted at peaches and pepper. I found this to be a little thin but highly carbonated. I nice slightly peppery and spiciness hits you. Was there supposed to be a bitter something there? If so I couldn't find it. The smell was the best part. Totally drinkable, there's nothing about it that stands out."
"Had this on tap, served in a pint glass, it's a light hazy golden orange, a thin head, some light lacing on the glass. Nose is an earthy slightly doughy malt overlaid with a fairly strong grassy note. Taste is a sweet, slightly buttery malt, a fairly strong spicey hoppiness, a slightly citric finish. Medium bodied with a fairly low carbonation, this is a nice smooth easy drinker. Overall this is a pretty nice ESB, hoppier than most, but still a balanced good session beer."
"The beer itself is a nice, balanced gold, with a fine head and fragrant Hallertau hop aroma. Supposedly this contains Cascade hops, but I thought the Hallertau dominated. The flavor of Bitter and Twisted is exceptionally well-balanced, with both sweet and bitter flavors present, albeit without an acrid hoppiness. This beer is exceptionally drinkable, with a nice, medium body that's neither to thin and watery nor too syrupy."
"Pours a four-fingered cream head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Clear, amber color. Nose is hoppy. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Starts hoppy but is not overbearing, Finish is clean with not much bitter after taste. A tolerable bitter. $4.69 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" off-white head above the clear dark golden/light amber brew. Head lasts reasonably well, with sticky white lacing. Aroma is earthy grains with light citrus hoppiness. Taste is pretty much as the nose indicated, with the malt upfront, balanced bitterness in the middle, and a slight citrus tinge ot the close. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, and drinkability is nice as well. I imagine this would rock on cask in the homeland..."
"Drinkability: Not one of my favorite styles, but this is an extremely drinkable beer, one that you could easily session. I am not sure if it is good for the label to picture a mouse rolling around with their hops, but if I don't get the plague, I guess it is ok. Thanks to LuckySevens82 for the sample."
"Definitely different from what I was expecting. Spicy, dry, and lacking the sweetness that I was anticipating. I thought this was a good beer, but the awful smell really brought it down."
"Great session bitter, one of my favorites from Scotland. Pours straw yellow with about 1/2 inch of creamy head. Aroma is hoppy, citrusy. Taste... floral hops, lemon peel, mineral like hop finish. Very dry mouthfeel. Leaves very little aftertaste. Smooth going down, fairly complex for a bitter. A very nice beer."
"drinkable due to its light nature, not bitter enough to me.. almost reminds me of snapple in some way ? anyway, not worth going out of the way for..."
"The body was medium and the carbonation was soft, leading to an extra drinkable brew. If I were in Scotland, I'd definitely seek this one out on draft or on cask. What a session ale!"
"Looks clear and clean with a small head out of a thick 500ml bottle. Nice citrous and apple aroma. Initial taste is like apple and grapefruit, just like the nose. Goes down very smooth with a clean aftertaste. Hops are subtle, clean and tasty. Nothing in this beer is overpowering. Low alcohol makes for a refreshing pint. A great example of a british session beer."
"Beer is good. Happy beering. 39/3.93"
"clear, flavorful and very drinkable"
"This is an awesome example of a small beer (only 4% ABV) with a punch of big hoppy flavor. Not too subtle like most other British imports, this is almost like an American IPA toned down a bit. If you like hops, this is a nicely crafted Bitter."
"Mouthfeel was somewhat thin. I wouldn't get this again, especially at the cost."
"Taste is pretty thin. Not much biscuity or buttery notes one would expect for this style. I think I taste some tea-like notes as well. That may be lemon-like flavors. Maybe that's from the hops. Nothing offensive, but this doesn't have much going on, which reduces its overall drinkability."
"This is a damn fine beer... an easy drinking session beer with quite a bit of character. I was seriously wishing I had more than one bottle."
"Pours a clear, apricot hued body with a small, bone white head that quickly falls to a lasting collar. Extensive sheets of lace drape the dimpled pint glass. Aroma is a bit subdued, with spicy and floral hops atop a sweetish honey malt background. Mouthfeel is creamy and light medium bodied, with light carbonation. Taste has bitter floral and spicy hopping, with some pleasant fruity notes of pears and Rome apples. Hops are assertive but nicely balanced by crisp and biscuity malt sweetness. Finish and aftertaste are bitter with floral hops, and a hint of peppery spice. Very well constructed, and nicely drinkable. Very good example of an English bitter."
"Sweet, spicy, & plenty of lemony hop flavour. Dries out nicely. Easy carbonation, light bodied. Kind of a summer beer in my book."
"All in all, Bitter & Twisted is a close to classic English (although brewed in Scotland) ESB. Friendly, drinkable and the very definition of sessionable, it's a beer that most everyone should enjoy."
"A very drinkable beer..most refreshing after all the malty beers."
"Dark golden color with a creamy head. Almost has a euro-lager aroma. The taste is bitter, but with a bit of malt to support it. However, the flavor profile is not pleasing to my palate. It's also a bit thin and astringent on the tongue. I was a bit disappointed by this offering, as it's a less than enjoyable brew."
"The beer looks decent,.. a tad darker than a budweiser with a nice white head and lacing. Nice aroma of skunky english style hops that remind me of a warm cup of tea. This is one unique brew. Imagine a mega IPA...but with sammy smith style hops. Starts off tea like, then ends on a fruity floral hop note (ARE YOU SURE THIS IS FROM THE UK?) what a great change up. This starts up front like a sammy smith pale ale and finishes like a Gumballhead. Brilliant. At only 4.2% I wish they sent this over in 12 packs . Mouthfeel is fairly light, but the taste makes up for it. The Drinkability is off the charts"
"Drawn from the hand pump, Bitter and Twisted is a fairly light golden honey color. The bubbles rise and form a thick dense head, about 3/4 inch. The aroma is surprising, dominated by citrusy grapefruit rinds. There's also an ever so slight damp hay note. Flavor is sharply hoppy, another surprise, rounded out by lightly toasted grains akin to saltines. A light sweetness fills the middle followed by a lingering bitter finish, living up to it's name. Also abundant is crisp hop flavor and aroma, leading me to believe the cask must be dry hopped. Body is light, carbonation on the money. This is quite a flavorful little drinker."
"I was a bit suprised to find these features in a beer from Scotland"
"Overall: A very refreshing beer, ideal for a hot day"
"Medium body. Low carbonation overall (aiming for that cask impression) but the bubbles still bite."
"Pours a nice golden hue with a touch of light orange, and a small white head that vanishes almost immediately. Very little carbonation. Light, sweet aroma of toasted malt and aromatic hops. Nice palate of sweet malt up front, developing into a slight hoppy bitterness towards the back of the mouth. Wonderful creamy mouthfeel. This is about the ideal session beer, if it weren't for the price."
"A very nice ale"
"Pale golden with not much head. Bit of white head that reduced down and stayed at a slight cover and ring. Great scent of dark cherry. Very dry mouthfeel, nice. Hoppy but not intense. No fuit in the flavor, must be that you think you should taste it since you smell it...? Thin mouthfeel, low carbination. Decent flavors but not much jumps out. Very balanced and easy drinking."
"Chill hazed darker gold appearance, nice very white head that lasts well and rises to 1/2 an inch. Complex and fairly complete lacing. Aroma hops on the smell, lightly citrusy but with more of a floral sense that melds well with biscuity maltiness. Nice body, sub-medium, smooth and creamy. Malt and hop balance very well early, a combination of classic hop style and a nice sense of butter and syrup on flapjacks. Both the sweetness and the hop contribute to the finish and aftertaste, very nice. Tightly balanced and drinkable brew here. One of those beers that straddles styles, has a nicer sense of balance than many American IPAs..."
"Pours a pale gold color with a moderate head and good lacing. The aroma is of lemony hops and some malts. The taste is very interesting, a very hoppy mix of fresh mown hay and pronounced lemon. This beer is brewed with both German and English hops, that might have something to do with the unique hop profile. The finish is very bitter and citrusy. An Excellent and very unique beer."
"Drinkability: A refreshing brew for a hot summer's day; just enough bitter hoppiness to make things interesting but nothing to ponder over for too long"
"Overall: An excellent brew and past winner of several CAMRA Awards. I have had the Cask version of this many times, and whilst the bottled version is particularly good, on Cask it has a little more sharpness to the bitterness and the hops are a little fresher. That said, I am not usually a big fan of bottled beers from the UK, but this one is a winner for sure, and if you only want to try a few Scottish beers from the bottle, make sure you try this one! A tad expensive but Recommended."
"Drinkability: Yeh, I could seriously drink 3 of these right now, but I only bought one. (frown)"
"Pours a real nice clear golden color with a thin head thats gone in a flash,aroma is leafy with a slight hint of mint with a light yeastiness to it as well.Flavor is on the dry side with a herbal hopiness balanced out nicely with a firm maltiness in the finish very crisp.To me the perfect sociable pint very easy to drink low in alcohol but not flavor."
"This is clear golden in color with a malty, grassy hop aroma. It is medium bodied and creamy with an herbal hop finish. There is some citrus as well in the finish. It is quite bitter, but there is enough malt to make sure that it is well balanced. It is from the UK, but if you didn't know, you might think it came from a West Coast brewery in the US."
"Enjoy this confused Bitter and bring on the 60 L crystal malt, otherwise this is one fine beer."
"I had this as one of my first beers at the Winking Lizard Tavern in Columbus. Cloudy blonde with a very small head it poured smooth. I could smell faint citrus, possibly orange. The taste was really good. Hoppy with citrus (grapefruit(?)) and honey character, very smooth finish. I could have this again but I'm not going to pursue the brew."
"Taste: all that continues on the tongue, sharp, pungent, but rapidly smoothing on the palate. Flavor remains singular and strong, great, tasty malt, too, becoming very smooth, the body is about medium, finish is a dry, long, with hoppiness lingering. The helpful label informs us that it's a blend of ""aromatic Hallertau Hersbrucker", ""spicy Challenger", and Styrian Goldings, and this odd combo turns out quite a kicky mix. The latter hop ""gives a sharpness like a twist of lemon", and I suppose that's what inspired the wicked name, an ingenious selling point on it's own. Very unusual, the dry-hopping and the curious recipe help create a remarkable ale. I'll return to this one again, someday, despite the price ($5.39 for this bottle)."
"(500 ml bottle). Golden colour, moderate head. Moderate but decent hoppy aroma. Hallertau in a bitter? Must be unusual? Mouthfeel is initially quite soft and not very ""bitter and twisted", but there's a distinct lemony bitterness in the finish (Styrian Goldings). Leaves a nice aftertaste. Very refreshing. I can see why this beer has a broad appeal to the masses. Not a piece of art, perhaps, but a decent and well made bitter. Look forward to sampling it cask conditioned."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable, but nothing remarkable."
"Very light straw colored beer. Little head, but the label touts the low carbonation level that this beer should have. The aroma when first poured was some spicy hop aromas, but they quickly faded into a more restrained malt hop aroma. The malt and hop balance is well done and quite crisp. The beer arrives on the palate with a sweet maltiness then goes bitter, and finishes dry."
"If you crave a true-to-name regular bitter, look no further."
"Golden blond color with a nice layer of well-retaining head and excellent lace. Earthy hops, biscuity malt and a hint of citrus fruit linger in the nose. Pleasantly hoppy with mildly bitter hops and a sturdy, biscuity malt character lead to a zesty citric finish. Beautifully balanced. Wonderfully smooth mouthfeel -- reminds me of cask-conditioned real ale, though it's from a bottle. Immensely drinkable and quenching, this ale screams ""session beer."" Overall, tons of flavor and character are packed into this low gravity brew. Great stuff."
"Drinkability Â– This is a terrific session beer that went down well during the October playoffs."
"Really nice session ale. Nice fresh citrusy hop aroma. Lightly caramelly, with a nicely bitter hop (Citrus again) finish. Apparently this was the champion beer at the GBBF 2003, perhaps not worthy of that accolade, but still a nice beer all the same. (Cask- GBBF 03')"
"Flavor: This is a light bodied ale. It starts out slightly citrusy~hoppy but finishes w/ pronounced bitterness on the tongue. I still think it looks a lot like champange."
" I hear this beer won "" Best of Britain"" this year."
"Poured from a stout 16.9 oz brown bottle, it's a clear gold with a white head the foams up nicely. In addition to a nice malt sweetness, it has a nice hop aroma and hints of citrus. The taste is also quite pleasant, if a bit subdued. It's very drinkable and, at 4.2%, it would make a nice session beer."
"A clear, deep golden body is topped by a creamy off-white head that holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. The nose is fresh and bright with lemony, floral and grassy hops. It's not overtly bold, but it is quite welcoming and gently refreshes the senses with each sip. The body is light, and the fine carbonation wakes up the tastebuds with a gentle tingle on the tongue. The flavor offers a lightly sweet malt that's solidly infused with gently spicy and lemony hop flavors, and backed by a firm bitterness. It finishes crisp and dry with a swirling note of sweetish malt that fades to lingering bitterness. A refreshing pint! And at only 4.2% abv it makes a great session beer. For fans of English bitter, this one's a charmer!"
"Had this at the 2003 Nerax. What a treat! Nice orangish-brown color. Great hop punch with a nice malty/hop scent. Extremely smooth beer and bitter but not overly bitter. I can't wait to try the bottled version now. Nice sweet malt taste to coincide with the hop flavor."
"A real treat to find this at the NERAX 2003! Bright golden in color with medium-sized bubbles and a fast fading head. The lace is thin, but a little sticky. The hoppy aroma is slightly mellowed by hints of lightly roasted malt. Sharp, citrusy bitterness with an edgy aggressiveness. Mellows, sweetens and balances out toward the end of the glass. Very gulpable!"
