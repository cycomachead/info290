Smells of bountiful floral bouquets with citrusy and piny resin aromas. Taste isn't quite on par with smell, has the herbal and floral for sure but also a faint bitterness that is very well balanced that wasn't detectable in the nose. Feels very smooth going down, crispy with the mild bitter finish, again very well balanced. This brew is very drinkable, crisp, and refreshing, sure to satisfy on a hot day. Had this while I was cooking up a dinner with copious amounts of garlic and spiciness and it went very well with the few bites I had as I was cooking away. Nothing too overpowering, bitterness was balanced by floral and fruitiness, overall nothing that blew me away but nothing terribly disappointing either.","Fluke828","Dec 23, 2010"

The aroma is much more caramel based than most IPAs I'm used to...oh this is an EIPA, that would explain that. The aroma given off is most similar to an orange marmalade with some sugary sweet fruit notes to go along with the malt base. The flavor is still plenty bitter from the hops but has a nice brown sugar flavor with the orange citrus notes. The mouthfeel is a tad on the dry side for my liking but it's not unpalatable. There is nothing special or outstanding about this beer but, it is overall a quality brew","Vdubb86","Nov 13, 2010"
2.91,-18.5,4,3,2.5,3.5,3,"Thin mouthfeel and a moderate-high carbonation for the style. Pretty solid. Its butteryness was a problem, but it didn't completely distract me from the beer.

4.09,14.6,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"D: A hearty, malty IPA that holds together very well. Well-balanced and a good departure from my usual go-to hop-bombs. Probably a bit too rich and filling to squash too many in one sitting. I tend to criminally overlook this solid IPA, probably because it's so common in these parts, but it grows on me a little bit more each time I try it.

3.92,9.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D: A pretty good English IPA and one might argue dangerously drinkable at 7% ABV. The strength of the brew is not measured by its alcohol flavor, but rather the hop content.

Taste is of caramel malts upfront, possibly some molasses. Hops presence hits in the middle to end - nice rich floral hops and a piney character that I didn't detect in the nose.

While the head receded quickly, it did leave quite a bit of lacing. The aroma is overwhelmingly malty. There is almost no hint of hops, just a small aroma of citrus at the end of the nose. The aroma is grainy with just a bit of brown sugar. The taste follows suit with malt being the dominant flavor with just a mild, non-descript bitterness at the tail of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is light with a mild carbonation. This beer reminds me of what you get at local restaurants that just happen to make a couple styles of beer in house.

3.73,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Not a bad beer, but a tad unbalanced. The appearance is quite good, it pours a tawny amber with a slight creamy head, a bit of lacing, and some retention. The aroma is pretty typical of a mainline IPA. There are some grassy hops, a touch of malt in the background. The aroma is not of the oily, estery hop character and the same goes for the taste. There is a pretty upfront hoppy bitter taste, but it is more dryish, a bit tea like, perhaps a bit grassy, but it does lack that oily and estery hoppiness that I prefer. You will get some grapefruit like astringency coupled with the bitterness. The result is a overly bitter beer, with not enough biscuity malts in the backbone to balance it out. There is also too much of a bittering aftertaste. Not a bad beer, quite refreshing, with some carbonation, fairly light to medium bodied, worth giving a try. I would very much like to visit the brewpub and have this on tap.","albern","Jan 03, 2008"

4.68,31.1,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"With taps at the ready a very knowledgeable brewer prepared my beer with a noticeable head that cascaded around as he turned the pint slightly in drought. The distinct aroma of pine with citrus hoppy foam was my first sensory pleasure. At first sip its head grasped my upper lip with a very light rose scent. The 7% ABV isn't noticeable, which has it's drawbacks. After 6-8 you thank the beer gods that you are within walking distance of the train in downtown Providence. It is one of the better IPA's that I have encountered in a brewpub.","devildog1633310","Jul 10, 2007"
4.1,14.8,4,4,4,4,4.5," Overall this was a quality little IPA that I had never heard of but impressed me none the less. It was just put together well, not overally explosive on teh hops and just well, nice. I would definatly not turn this one down.","mikesgroove","Jun 21, 2007"
3.48,-2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"I wanted to like this, and the ingredients are actually good, you can sense that underneath, but the blending, or what there is of it, is inept and unbalanced. And with an ABV that plays a lot bigger than it actually is, it's one more distraction and an obstacle to drinking more easily. I doubt I'll run across this again, and the shame is, that's okay.","Foxman","Beers"
3.55,-0.6,4,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Very drinkable. Good hop flavor without an over the top ABV. Only complaint is the mouthfeel. The lack of body and xs carbonation don't do this beer any favors.","","0"

3.06,-14.3,4,3,3,3,3,"Pours a murky caramel brown, reddish highlights, huge off white head, lots of sticky lace, good retention, never wants to go away. Smell is lots of sweet malts, caramel, pine, some citrus, bit of floral, lots of fruit, not too hoppy, pretty balanced. Taste is weak, some grain, caramel, pine, bit of citrus, kind of medicinal in the finish, nutty bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, carbonation is low, possibly lower than normal due to a bad seal. Still seems to be in shape judging by previous reviews, just not entirely interesting. Thanks for the brew Mark!","Viggo","Mar 16, 2007"
3.76,5.3,4,3,4,4,4,"Overall: One of my favorite beers at trinity, and the one time they actually had it on cask it was probably the single best single IPA i have ever had. Its ok in the bottle too, but to get the real experience head to the brewhouse!","YankChef","Mar 03, 2007"
3.83,7.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The flavor is concentrated and direct, combining malt, hops and yeast into one solid flavor. The somewhat sweetish malt is darkly caramelish, and balanced by a bold bitterness. Yeasty fruitiness adds a fresh, sweetish accent that's reminicent of apples, berries, pear, and cherry. The citrusy hops round it out, but are more restrained than might be expected, helping to focus on the whole rather than just the hop component. And yet, there's still enough there to allow each component its own berth, and enough depth of character to give it some complexity and drinkability. Additionally, some actual yeast flavor sneaks in, giving it another dimension (although a more careful pour might help to hold that back). Nicely done! A bright, lively IPA that wakens the tastebuds! Certainly worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Nov 17, 2006"

3.4,-4.8,4,4,3,3,3.5,"D: I wouldn't refuse another one, but I also wouldn't go out of my way for this IPA. Good appearance and smell, but with flawed taste and mouthfeel make this a 'worth a try' beer at best.","msubulldog25","Oct 20, 2006"
3.97,11.2,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A nice pick up on the way back from CT. Poured a dark amber color with very little in the way of head or lacing, which is somewhat surprising considering the alcohol content. In any event from the first smell this was going to be a very drinkable beer. The sweet malty flavor clung to the front while there was just a waft of hops lingering about the edges of my nostrils. Just a tad bit of fruitiness could be detected with a deep inhalation. The taste mimicked the nose with that malty, fruity flavor upfront. As the beer slid down the back of my tongue and onto my throat the hops became detectable. This is definitely a nice balance between the hoppiness that is more prevalent with American IPAs with a nice smooth maltiness of the English style. I could easily drink 4 or 5 of these without any trouble. A good choice for a sixer at the end of a long day.","GreatPondBrewer","Oct 12, 2006"

3.75,5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D: Tasty due to the good hops kick, not-too-filling, seems to lean toward an English-style IPA with some extra hoppiness. I thought this beer would taste similar to their Rhode Island IPA that they have on-tap at the brewpub, however although it was still good, the two beers are quite different, even when you factor in the bottle vs. tap.","TheManiacalOne","Aug 16, 2006"
3.65,2.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A toned down IPA in some respects; the hop character is slow acting which is pretty unusual. A change of pace, but I prefer the more modern, aggressive hop monsters.","NEhophead","Jul 06, 2006"
3.55,-0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Hazy apricot colored with a huge inch-high head of light orange foam. Bubbles are small and fine, contributing to a thick meringue feel. Aroma is light but malty, a little grainy, not too hoppy, perhaps because the foam holds it down. Flavor is initially piney hops with specks of grapefruit and tangerine, followed by a faint malt presence. Also some bits of metallic flavor which detract. Good mouthfeel, but average drinkability because it's not very complex or multidimensional.","far333","May 16, 2006"
2.88,-19.3,3.5,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Nice cloudy amber brownish color. Huge head disapated after a few minutes. Way over carbonated in the sixer I got. The bottle cap basicly blew itself clear across the room upon opening. Poured very poorly. Had to wait about 10 minutes to pour it. Not much lacing. Sharp hop bite nice mild flavor. Citrusy, floral, grassy smell had some sand or earthy scent to it. Subtle maltiness in the background. Rather strong had a good taste to it but very bubbly. Like an IPA momosa. Besides the over carbination it was a decent beer. On tap is much better at Trinity Brewhouse. This sixer did this beer no justice. Once the bubbles are managed then I will seek a rematch. Better on tap at Trinity.","bigone4","Apr 23, 2006"
3.61,1.1,4,3,3.5,4.5,4,"Great mouthfeel with good hop flavor. Poured in the glass nicely with a little head that receded to a lacy overcoating. Standard coloring for it's style. Would like a bit more hop smell, not enough compared to what you're tasting. Tastes a tad too bitter for me, would like more hop flavor with the bitterness (but this could just be me). Great mouthfeel (did I already say that?) and good hop lingering after taste. Leaves your palate thirsting for more!","aluskungs","Apr 14, 2006"
3.57,0,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"M & D: Mouthfeel is of pure carbonation. A bit oily at the sides of the mouth with a good bitter ending. Suprisingly drinkable even though you have to wait for the big ass head to dissipate. Very tasty ipa that I'd like to try on tap instead of in the bottle as the carbonation would most likely be less.","bjohnson","Jan 06, 2006"
3,-16,3,3,3,3,3,"As my review states this is just an overall average beer. It is however much better than the first batch of trinity that was brewed by cottrell. That stuff was pure swill. Not an overly hoppy IPA and pretty bland taste. However it still was pretty good overall. I would like to try some directly from the brewery to see the difference.","TrickKnee","Nov 05, 2005"
3.45,-3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"I'd had their IPA on tap at the brewpub several times, and it was always, always much better than this. I'm guessing there's some quality issues on the production level. For one, losing at least some of the yeasty flavor, and perhaps some actual yeast, may improve both the flavor and mouthfeel. Also, perhaps the bottling line is failing to remove enough oxygen from the bottles prior to capping? Not letting them foam up enough before capping? The frothing of the head, the cardboard flavor, and the huge amount of carbonation are all things I expect in an old, oxodized bottle of beer. If I'd bought this at a less than reputable shop, I'd chalk it up to just sitting there since last year, but I have enough faith in the store to assume the problem was in the bottling. I mean, the beer's nice enough as it is, drinkable in small quantity, but it could be so much better. Fix the problems and you have a real winner.","UnionMade","Sep 06, 2005"
3.56,-0.3,2.5,4,4,2.5,3,"i'm unsure if i had a bad 6-pack of this but the beer was way over-carbonated. the head filled the entire glass. after a while of waiting it did hold a nice lacy layer over the beer which is always nice. the color was that of a foggy amber-brownish look. very aromatic with much hops and a hint of sweetness/fruit. the mouthfeel was very carbonated with a nice piny flavor which turned slightly sweet and ended with a long finish, very enjoyable if the carbonation was less.","ccm414","Sep 03, 2005"
