I think it's rated lower by people who expect an American style IPA and are then surprised by the subtlety in this one. The hops used in this beer are magnificent and provide a really rare flavor for those used to the traditional American varietals. I would highly recommend this beer, with the caveat that you know it's not an American IPA and you should not expect it to taste like a citrus bomb.4/5","Beric","Sep 20, 2014"

The beer gave off a hoppier aroma than was expected from an English IPA, but light citrus hops. The taste, again, was overpowered by the hops for the style. This style is typically a bit more balanced than say an American IPA. No real complexity to it, just straight citrus hops. The beer had a good feel to it and finished with a decent dry but bitter aftertaste and was easy to drink. Overall, too hoppy for the style, I expected a little more balance...but even if it was just an IPA, it is average at best.","PhillyStyle","May 13, 2013"

Hazy golden body that likes to play with light for added complexity, kind of light amber, like the actual mineral held up to light. Not much hits me in the nose, but as I search a juicy mouthwatering citrus orange-cookie aroma comes through. Really dig the flavors though. Very well balanced. Enough hop presence that you know it's an IPA but enough satisfying malt contrast to be solidly English rather than American style. As it warms some dark fruit sweetness comes through quickly cut by drying bitterness, some tobacco and earthy fresh cut grass in the finish. Really juicy and easy to drink, refreshing as spring even as autumn settles in. Orange/lemon rind with some melon/ grape notes finishing like a crusty rustic baguette. Complex and good. Non-extreme with nothing lacking.","Masscraft","Oct 13, 2012"

Slightly bitter, but not really. slight tropical fruit taste, almost like a #9 or even a Sculpin. Does lack the hop pungency that I love so much. Bottle dating is ambiguous since it says good until 4/5/11. I'm guessing that's a 6 month date (way too long for most IPAs) and if so that makes this one 2 months old. hard to tell.

Whle the taste also features these sensations there is also a pleasant, laid back sweet maltiness mixed in. The hops on the whole are more subtle than some IPA's and for me that is magnificent.

The hops that are present are faintly medicinal tasting, and the body of the beer seems to be non-existant, except perhaps a small amount of very light grain and/or adjuncts.

At 1st taste it really warms you, then the hop finish comes through and bites you. I would say it is more piney than citrus. fitting for a beer made for the berkshire mountain folk. overall one of my favorite ipa's. and i love supporting the local business. so it works on all levels.

Slightly metallic smell, and a smell that reminds me of ringwood yeast. Hit of honey oriented malt in the beginning, followed by light, floral hops. It leaves a mild numbing effect on the palate. This beer has a very complex hop profile, but not in your face, or over the top like so many others. Feel of this beer is really well rounded out, not too big, but not too light. Drinking this is helped out immensely by the balance of malt and hops. As it has been said before, this is one of the best for its style that New England has to offer. It is a pity that there aren't so many English varieties of this style more widely available, as I think they are every bit as complex and good as their American counterparts. I will make sure to include this as an extra in trades I make in the future. Cheers, and happy St. Pattys Day.","jamie2dope","Mar 17, 2009"

There is a definite hop character to the smell, with a tart, citrus background. The taste follows this trend, as there is a nice citrus background to the bitter hops. The hops do not overwhelm due to a nice balance with the malt. It is a really smooth, easy drinking IPA, with no overbearing carbonation either. I really like this IPA, a citrusy hops character balanced with a sound malt backbone, and no overdone carbonation.

Wonderfully fresh, hoppy, and cotton-candy/dextriney nose. Slight pine and citrus peel notes with the hops. Smooth, medium-bodied mouth feel. Very natural and draft-like. Fresh, very well-balanced and long flavor. Delicious! Incredibly complex (as opposed to simply powerful) hoppy tones. Nicely balanced, w/ caramel and butterscotch toasted maltiness to provide good counterbalance to the hoppiness. A rather lightly toasted and hoppy IPA, though bodisome and full.

Leaves a head that's about a finger thick and has pretty good retention. A different smell for an IPA...more malty than hoppy. Has some hint of citrus as well. The hops are there, but they are hidden a bit by the sweet malt. The taste is well balanced, but as with the aroma, it's more malt than hops. It's a sweet taste (caramel?), and a noticable bitterness to it. It leaves a fair amount of stickiness in the mouth. Light to medium bodied and it drinks easy.

On the palate it is all this, plus leafy and fruity hops, tasty grapefruit, a medium bitterness, and some sweet and buttery flavors from the malts.

The expected smells of citrus are there but surprisingly they seem restrained comparatively. Sure I have here some great hop smell but it was fainter and less potent than I would expect. Its taste makes up for it by having its usual great bitter punch on the taste buds. A great carbonation keeps this drink alive and crisp after a long period of time.

The hop flavors contain citrus notes of orange and grapefruit which is similar to other IPA's only they do not dominate the flavor profile like an American style IPA. There is certainly enough hop flavor and aroma to keep the drinker interested, but the hops blend more than showcase. This is a beer and a brewery that I visit and revisit often.

Earthy notes instead of citrus, grass instead of metals, etc... along with a toasted, biscuity malt backing. Subdued and very nice. On the palate, pale malt sweetness first off, which lasts through the mid-palate. Some lightly citric and spicy hop oils crop up next to growing, tea-like bitterness. The finish has some marshmallow-like sweetness, but it's not overly sweet as finishes go. Mouthfeel is only medium in thickness and pretty light in carbonation; that makes the beer sit a little heavier on the palate than it should, but it's such a light beer that it ends up not mattering much.

Not an extreemly heavy IPA but it has nice body and great overall IPA characteristics. Extreemly drinkable and enjoyable. Great tasting brew that keeps getting beter with each sip.

Taking a sip, it's real, real mellow, like any good session ale should be. Probably a bit too warm (feels warm on a mid-summer evening), but still nice. Pale malt sweetness with a grape-nuts cereal graininess and a little dab of caramel. Soft pear fruitiness, starting to dry out early. Modestly hopped finish, floral and citrusy, ending off incredibly dry, almost puckering. Not sour, just super duper dry. Full bodied, with nearly flat carbonation, in the true english style. The difference between this beer and the regular tap/bottle is night and day. Completely different hop feel. Unique, unusual, and pretty damn tasty. Hey, I went for thirds, if that says anything.

Anyway it has this melon like canteloupe sweetness that I am guessing is from the hop combo, but it is not sharp instead very dull and intriguing. Not quite what I am looking for in an IPA.

A nice mouthfeel for an IPA takes me back home to sip after sip of this lovely brew.","scottum","Oct 21, 2003"
4.22,9.9,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Hazy honey color with a beige head. Head rises up big and foamy but settles right back down again. Aroma is bright and hoppy, lots of citrus and pine. Very fresh and clean smelling. Flavor is strong hops, very well-balanced, with hints of orange and sweet malt. Creamy mouthfeel with tingling sensation on the tongue. Lingering flavor of honey and hop bitter. This is great stuff.","far333","Jul 18, 2003"
4.49,16.9,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Nice golden orange with substantial head on initial pour. Well carbonated. Aroma was excellent...a light fruity (citrus) that invites you to drink. Not the usual bitter kick of an IPA, but interesting nonetheless. Very citrusy and well-rounded with a smoothness that was unexpected. The bitter quality of the usual IPA hit as an aftertaste that didn't overstay its welcome. Mouthfeel was nice...medium bodied and very drinkable.","edchicma","Jul 15, 2003"

3.41,-11.2,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a golden color, that is somewhat hazy. The white head was minimal, and didn't stay long or provide any lacing down the glass. The aroma is lightly of hops (pine?,grapefruit?) and fruitiness (?). Hard call as to the specifics. Taste is a mild maly sweetness, with a bitter finish. Fair to middlin.","Boto","Jul 07, 2003"
3.63,-5.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a medium-light amber, small white head that doesn't last too well. Aroma is light, fruity (pears, grapes), mildy hoppy (floral, pine). Flavor starts slightly fruity (mostly pears), middle is thin, ends mildly hoppy. Medium body, mild carbonation.","goz","Jun 12, 2003"
4.32,12.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a wonderfully tasty beer. Poured a cloudy dark orange with dense tan head. Aroma was just beautiful- juicy fruity peach, apricots and grapefuits with a sweet malt background. Tasting it was like biting into an over-ripe peach that drips down your chin onto your shirt. The flavor aspect of the hop is really accented here as I didn't find this beer to be overly bitter but mightily flavorful. Finishes sugary sweet but a little thin, but with enough body to hold up to all the fruity flavors. Very enjoyable.","pbrian","Apr 17, 2003"
3.18,-17.2,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours with a white head that lasts forever and leaves a good lace. Color is a light cloudy amber. For an IPA this is not over powering with hops like many are. Starts sweet but the hops do kick in before the finish. Medium bodied, slightly bitter but not dry.","jdhilt","Apr 02, 2003"
4.79,24.7,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"This beer, while appropriately bitter, does not provide the crazy explosion of hops provided by the big IPA's so celebrated these days. And that's part of what I like about it. A great, balanced beer by Berkshire -- one of my favorite IPAs.","jward","Mar 03, 2003"
4.92,28.1,4.5,5,5,4.5,5,"Deep honey coloring; thick white head with outstanding retention. Sharp, penetrating hop aromas; apricot fruitiness with some pine notes. Low carbonation. Toasty and caramel malts at first, followed by a big hop flavor that takes you into a shortish finish. This English-style IPA is much more balanced than many of its American-style counterparts. Just a fabulous brew, and one which I'll pick up a good deal more of next time I'm in western MA.","doerickson","Sep 22, 2002"
4.32,12.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a kickin' IPA.  Strong hop flavor and good bitterness.  This beer was not hopped for bitterness alone.  Whatever flower used has a great aroma and flavor characterisitc.  Quite good all around.","beernut7","May 03, 2002"
4.2,9.4,4,4,4,4,5,"A damn fine IPA, and one of the best in MA. This IPA really appeals to me because it shows off both a big malt and big hop character, but the beer is so in balance and the flavours are so smoothed together.","Todd","Dec 26, 2001"
4.24,10.4,4,5,4,4,4,"Notes: One of the better domestic English Style IPAs I have had in a long time, well balanced and poised as a session beer.","Jason","Jul 03, 2001"
