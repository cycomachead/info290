"nice easy ipa, not that an ipa should necessarily be easy but this just hit the spot right (right now anyway)... nice mouth feel, even feel, slightly bitter (not a really stiff ipa).... almost ipa light (an a good way)... maybe the wife will like it... naw..."

""
""
"Why too hoppy for me."
""
""
""
"A nice, easy drinking IPA. Good."
""
""
""
""
"Good everyday IPA.  Mild enough for people unused to IPAs, but flavorful enough to enjoy."

""
"A nice maltier IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Very different, a mellow IPA with floral hints."
""
"Pretty good beer I wouldn't drink back to back. But I would order time to time."
""
""
"Had this on tap at Harpoon Larry's in Newport News.  Pours a fairly clear amber with a small whitish head that dissipates fairly quickly.  A very faint aroma of hops and a fairly watery mouthfeel dominate the beverage.  it does have a nice malty, floral taste to it.  Overall, an acceptable IPA."
"beer is very nice. smooth"
""
""
""
""
"Pleasant, deep amber color. Two-finger head of tight, white foam thins out after a few minutes, leaving some remnants on the glass. The beer's aroma is sweet--reminiscent of honeysuckles. I must describe the taste and feel as insipid, but only because of my high esteem for some of this brewer's other products. A good, drinkable beer, but not an eyebrow raiser."

"good, reliable ale is my main go-to"

"I absolutely like this IPA. On the  light side but is very drinkable and perfect out of a Kraft. Well done!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Copper color along with floral hops and an amazing balance of hops and grains with the full body make this a very good ipa."
""
""
"Well balanced malt and hops"
""
""
""
"Really drinkable, tasty, on the lighter side IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Color is a nice shade of blonde. Head sticks around with good lacing. Not a hop bomb, but enough to remind you it's an IPA. In addition to the bitterness, a decent malt backbone. Not chewy, but a good tingle on the tongue from the carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"in the context of a ""traditional"" English IPA Harpoon nails it. I'm shocked it is not - on average -  rated much higher. This is a well balanced IPA with no pronounced malt  ""backbone"" as it were.  Malts, floral and fruit are all well combined with what might possibly be one of the best East Coast masterpiece interpretations of the style; other than the ABV being a little high for an English, this one is killer"

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good IPA. I really like the hoppy flavors in this compared to others."
""
" Good feel. Crisp, refreshing and lighter than some of the more heavy duty IPAs I've had. Overall, I enjoyed this one and will have again."
"Good taste and don't normally like IPAs"
""
""
""
""
"Feel= Slight carbonation, could be more"

"One of the best IPAs ever"
"Real good.  Probably my favorite APA so far.  At least best balanced in my opinion; hops to malt."
"Here in Florida, Harpoon is often on special at Publix for 7.99,  a good price if you just want a simple 6 pack of a decent IPA."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a really good session ipa! Looks good in the glass.. Mild taste but well made. Good beer to get your buddy into IPAs"

"Best example of an Eastcoast IPA. Understated hops taste, great smooth, finish."

"Much better than I think it gets credit for. The beer pours a straw colored yellow with a thin head that trails the glass. A lot of great floral smells come through because of the hops. The taste has a hop punch up front and then a lot of great toasted flavors coming through. A very complex, yet approachable beer. Would definitely recommend for an everyday beer, or maybe a nice beer to start getting into IPA's with."

"Decent and a good price but seems to be dropping in quality."

"A subtle, solid IPA. When I lived in Boston, this was my go-to IPA. An excellent contrast to the West Coast, superhop approach (though I like those too)."

"Had this on tap at the Burlington Maritime Festival Umphrees McGee concert. Served in a 12 oz clear plastic cup. A clear copper-yellow with a thin white head. Mostly malt in the nose....not a hop bomb at all. Taste was better than I expected after the lack of hop aroma. Caramel malt sweetness with a slightly bitter backbone...although lacking significant hop flavor. Nice refreshing beer. Perfect for the occasion as enjoyed by the horde."

"I am an IPA whore. The more hops that drop kick my tonsils on the way down, the better. In my honest opinion, this should be an ""all day"" IPA. It goes down great, but may leave you wanting more. By no means is it tasteless, yellow, boiled wheat by-product, but drinks more like a pilsner than an IPA. Harpoon makes great products, and this beer is no exception. Just know, it is not going be like a lot if the IPA's on the shelf nowadays. It's damn good on any occasion, great with any meal, best when shared with friends....or.....well, don't be a dick! If your hosting, the least you can do is serve beer. This would be a great beer to serve."

"Overall: This is a pretty decent standard IPA. I don't want to describe it as ""entry level"" but it's a solid IPA for folks who don't do IPAs with heavy frequency. It's not a hop bomb or an especially complex beer, but it's nice for what it is."

"Taste is a light start with pale malt and citrus hops, grapefruit and apricot, smooth bodied with a moderate carbonation and a lot of graininess. Overall a decently sessionable IPA, a bit more of a dry floral edge to it with a crayon type of character coming in, it does dry out and linger on with some of the maltiness. Has some earthy and dry bitterness, getting a bit more balanced by the malt toward the finish. There are better IPAs for sure but this one seems to work alright, a bit more of an English influence to it is quite evident, but the combination didnt hit it out of the park."
""
"Overall: I think this is an underrated beer from Harpoon. While it certainly won't knock your socks off, this is a solid brew with a good balance of flavors. Would recommend."

"Enjoyed a Two Hearted Ale (Bell's) last night and a Finestkind (Smuttynose) IPA the night before that, so this is a bit of a letdown. It's still a nice beer and probably the best choice I could have made at the supermarket on a Sunday night (as opposed to my usual place to score beer)."

"O: Really like the balance of including yeast and malts as well as the hop and floral taste. I am not really an IPA guy, and I get more pleasure from this as a drinkable beer than from, say, 60 min. If you're crazy about hoppy bitterness, you will find this too sweet"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A reliable and pleasing east coast IPA. I do tend to lean towards IPAs with more citrus character, but this one will certainly not disappoint. Not overly bitter and this would also serve as a nice introduction to American IPAs for those that find themselves reluctant to give them a try."

"Bright copper gold overall it is quite clear. After the pour the head is a couple of fingers tall but it falls quickly and to a thin layer of fine bubbles that lace nicely throughout the session. The bottle says IPA but my nose doesn't quite agree. The aroma is much more in line with a pale ale than an IPA with a lot of caramel and a bit of sweet buttery notes and very little in the way of hops. The taste too is ok, there is a good bit of bitterness up front and a lot of sweet caramel but really not much in the way of hop flavor or unique malts. The beer finishes with a bit of a metallic twang that i'm not too sure about either. Carbonation is relatively high and there is a decent amount of bitterness in there as well which is nice and overall its not too sweet and not too dry. Overall this is a decent sessionable beer, an IPA for people who dont like IPAs perhaps."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Pours a nice copper color with a decent head. Smell is ok nothing special. Taste Is Actually Pretty good. Refreshing with some suttle hints of citrus. Nothing spectacular or overwhelming but decently balanced and enjoyable. Feel this beer is slightly underrated and find it to be a little above average for the ipas I like. Will try again"

"This is a great beer. As far as IPA's go, I would consider it right in front of the middle of the road candidates. It has a great floral nose, however, it leaves you wanting more, not much, but wanting more. Considering all the IPA's that are out there, that really deliver a hoppy punch, Harpoon kind of drinks more like a lager. Delicious for all cuisine and all seasons. I rate it high because it is a great ""go-to"" if your local store lacks selection, if your local is on the eastern seaboard of course."

"Poured from bottle to mug. It was a pretty golden color, head stuck around basically til the last drop. Smell was decent. The taste was a typical IPA, which isn't a bad thing, there was just nothing really to differentiate it from others. The price is pretty good compared to other IPAs I've had that tasted relative. Not the best beer I've ever drank but I did enjoy it. No complaints here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very herbal and citrusy aroma. It's mild and less west-coast in style, but I actually really enjoy just taking a big woody, herbal-spice whiff of this one, but the taste does not deliver. A little boozy and thin, not a terribly pleasant or smooth bitterness. Overall, I'll take it if given no other IPA options, as it is solid and gets the job done, but it does leave me wanting more on the taste side of things."

"An ok beer. Had on tap, fine taste but hard for me to rate higher with so many great IPA's. Should be b priced with the average IPA's and I would rate higher overall. For those of you who do not like the stronger tasting IPA's this might be your ber. Many a friend of mine o not like the real hoppy IPA's I do, so this would be a high recommendation for them. I would be interested in their feedback. ENJOY!!!"

"Pours a clear light copper with a half finger of fluffy white head that dissipated quickly. The nose is only mildly hoppy. Overall, the flavor profile is quite light as well. The finish is slightly hoppy, but I have had top-shelf APAs that are hoppier than this offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"M&D: unfortunately, it's pretty thin on the body and the semi-spritzy fizziness comes not as soft and natural as a bottle-conditioned ale, but perhaps it's designed as such (light) to be quaffable and the overall mouthfeel is clean enough indeed. Not as deep and complex as the FD Snake Dog IPA tasted alongside, but overall an easy-drinking example all the same."
""
""
""
"Overall/Comments: A very good IPA that doesn't wow you but does a good job representing the style. Solid and drinkable. Classified as an American IPA @ 5.9% ABV. Consumed 10/19/2013."
"Nice clear golden color with a white spotty head that sticks in spots on the glass. The smell is pine bitterness with little malt present. The taste is not as bitter as the smell with slight caramal honey pale malt that leads into the piney flower bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium. Not really a hoppy tasteing ipa like the smell would make you think. I do like this very good."
"O-What a great drinking IPA for a session! Easy to drink with a tad more ABV than most of the lighter IPAs so I guess that's why I like it so much. I only tried it after checking this site and decided to become a member to review it as my first beer because of other people's reviews! I highly recommend it even though I may not be a beer expert but believe that I have had my share to be a source of information."

"Poured out a clear amber, very lightly carbonated. The head barely exists and quickly disappears. Zero retention. On its way down the glass, though, it does leave a hint of lacing. The aroma is a little odd, a little musty and also sweet. The taste has some slight nondescript hops flavors and a slight lilt of malt. There is a decent weight to body and it is fairly smooth. It's not terrible, but not one I'd go to again."

"O- This was the first IPA I had (besides DFH's 60 and 90) where I realized ""Hey, I like IPAs."" Not very surprising since it's such a subtle version of the style. Recommended for people who aren't that into hops but would like some bitterness in their beer."

"O: Overall, I found this to be a great beer, I really enjoyed it. I'd recommend it as an excellent introduction to the IPA style as it has what it takes to exemplify satisfactorily what an IPA is, but it is not so hoppy/bitter as to be unpleasant to the inexperienced IPA drinker."

Clear deep golden color with a decent frothy white head that persists forever. Earthy citrus hop aroma countered with plenty of bready caramel malt. Old school bitter citrus flavor with a fair amount of brown sugar read and caramel. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost sweet mouthfeel. After all these years this is still a pretty good IPA."

"12 oz tap pour. 3/4 inch of white head that runs away fairly quickly. Clear, orange color. Floral hops aromas and more in the taste. Medium body, almost light. Malt is evident, the hop bite is almost an after thought. Feel like I'm drinking potpourri tea..."

"Was really wanting to love this beer, having lived in Boston and love the town. I guess the fact that I had this immediately following Sierra Nevada's Torpedo Extra IPA, it really didn't stand a chance. I'll look at this again when there's no comparison, but on first blush, this is about as generic an IPA can get (consider the comparison)..."

"A nice, solid, easy-drinking IPA. I could drink several of these and not get tired; sessionable for sure. A great all-purpose beer for chicken, fish, and Indian dishes -- I'd love to have a dish with mango with this as I think the contrast would be nice."

"Toasted malt and herbal hop bitterness up front. Mix of fruit and caramel malt fill in. Slight sweetness. Hop flavors and bitterness pick up toward the finish. Herbal, spicy, and a little piny. Drier in the finish, but with plenty of lingering maltiness. Again, well-balanced, but hoppy enough to merit the IPA badge. Moderate body with a prickly feel."

"Overall I got to go with 3.5 - it's better than I expected, and will buy again, maybe I'll aquire a more filling taste for it, maybe I haven't paired it with a great food. Not sure, but it is a good beer and I will definitly have again."

"The beer pours a very clean golden color, bordering on amber, and displaying light pinkish tints. The beers body is very translucent and particle free, but the head is tiny and nearly nonexistent, which is too bad. What bubbles do appear, appear to from a small scrim-ring around the glass and are an eggshell white. The lacing on the sides of the glass is spotty and quite slick, only staying briefly before they return to the beer. On the nose, the beer smells of grassy and hay-like hops with a good sweet and slightly stale bread malt base and a light citrus touch. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter with a great malty sweet playing alongside of it, but never fully meshing with the bitters. The beer begins with light caramel sweets and a faint bitter bite before the bitters open into a nice little punch with very slight citrus, grass, and hay notes. As the beer rounds out the bready malts build in the mouth to play alongside the bitters, and in the finish there is still a great bitter tingle with a fading sense of the bready sweet malts. Just as the beer drops down the throat there is very quick emanation of cereal malts, which quickly returns to the bready sweet aftertaste. On the mouth, the beer feels thin to medium in body, with a little tingle of fierceness from the carbonation, and a big bitter bite on the tongue. The mouth is left clean but for some slight saliva on the edges of the mouth and a bitter tingle in the tongue. Overall, this is a solid middle of the road IPA. It has a little more of a bitter bite than a true English IPA, but not nearly enough pine or citrus to be considered an American IPA. I think this is a terrific introduction to the world of hops and IPA’s, and definitely a recommendation for anyone trying to slowly convert someone else to the hops. The malts and bitters work beautifully side-by-side, but never quite mesh, which isn’t entirely bad. A great intro IPA, and a good beer that can be found outside of craft beer bars."

"O ~ This is my go to beer, it isn't an overpowering IPA, with flavor or ABV. It is a good IPA that is available almost anywhere in MA, and on tap at almost every bar. If i feel like having an IPA I can always grab this, it is also generally cheap at bars around Boston if you are on a budget. B-"

"I'm not sure how fresh this is, but pours a dark yellow without any real orange accents. Smells sweet malt and grain and some floral notes, but not strongly hop-forward for an IPA. Tastes sweet and bready and malty and a bit bitter, but again, not really positioned strongly for an IPA...more ale-like here. Fouthfeel is strongly fussy effervescent and really good. Overall, a just good IPA. Would like to try one fresh out of production for comparison."

"D - This was better than I was expecting, especially if you frame it as a transitional IPA between English and American traditions. Still, the bitterness and astringency gets a bit fatiguing and the flavor is a bit dull in general. I'd drink it again if I was really desperate (like I was last Wednesday) but there are much better options available virtually everywhere in Chicago."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a nice red yellow, a little cloudy with a small white head that leaves a little lacing in the glass.

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This AIPA poured a light copper color, very clear, produced a very nice white head, great retention and excellent lacing. The aroma of this ale contained malted grain and an explosion of citric hops. Very Nice! Medium in body, this AIPA had a foundation of malted grain, bitter citric hops. Crisp refreshing beer. Excellent session beer, first beer that I have tried from Harpoon, impressed!"

"The beer pours a pale golden color with a small head that fades quickly to a film. Good lacing. The aroma is good, but not outstanding. Hops are have a floral aroma. Not sure what kind of hops are used, but the aroma does not seem to match the taste. The beer has a fruity sweetness. Bitter, yes, but not overly bitter and certainly not raspy like some of the continental hops. The combination is unique. Flavor is soft and pillowy compared to a lot of American IPAs. I like it, but it is certainly not typical. This makes the second IPA this week I have tried with unconventional taste/aroma. The other was Great Divide . The beer is immensely drinkable. Accessible for those just getting to know IPAs; but different enough to be interesting to the initiated. The texture is medium. Lower carbonation keeps it soft in the mouth as well."

"This is a nice offering. It pours a beautiful crystal clear gold with a 3 finger head leaving elaborate lacing. The smell is bread and grass. Mouthfeel is pretty good, not thick, not thin, but pretty average. Taste is some grapefruit and malts with a nice understated hoppy finish. This is a very drinkable IPA that with would be ideal as a session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I understand that using ""modern"" (2012) standards to judge this beer (apparently introduced in 1992) isn't entirely fair. The hoppiness of IPAs has increased quite substantially. As a result, this is basically an APA. I'm trying to adjust my score accordingly. Regardless, it's certainly not bad in any way, and is very drinkable. If it deserves any bonus points, it should get some for being a gateway beer to IPAs in general. It's mild enough that it may inspire some to further explore the style. A few years ago, this beer actually helped me on my path... to finding better IPAs."
"This is a very good session beer. Bold taste; just make sure it is dated within the month of purchase. Poor out of the bottle with a little force to release aroma and carbonation. I would not consider it a IPA because I don't get the bite I would expect-- but not disappointing."
""

"Poured into a pint glass. Pours golden with a large white head. Plenty of bubbles can be seen streaming from the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. The hop aroma is more of the citrus variety with some sweet and biscuit malt coming through in the nose as well. The taste follows the nose. The hops bring the citrus flavors ahead of the biscuit malt backbone. There is some hop bitterness on the back end. The body is light with abundant carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is high. This is a very good and refreshing IPA."

"I had this beer for the first time and when i tasted it i had to check the label to make sure i had the beer i wanted. nothing about this beer tastes like an IPA in fact it tastes like a lager. i don't know if they got their labels mixed up or if the IPA is just horrible but something isn't right."

"Had a Harpoon IPA on draft at Red Robbin last night and I couldn't even tell it was an IPA or even a Pale Ale. There was no hop aroma and barely any taste. It was a bit cloudy also It reminded me of Bud American Ale which has no noticeable hop aroma either . I don't recommend it."

"a great ipa, enjoyed in a can for the first time today. pours crystal clear light brassy color, almost glowing in the sun, with a bigger than one inch off white head. smells like floral hops and english bready malts, balanced but hop forward. flavor matches. this is the classic summer ipa to me, its got just enough body to be an ipa, but its down easy with a drinkable but flavorful malt support cast. the hops are bitter but not challengingly so, just sort of crisp in the finish. also this is very well carbonated, lovely in the mouth. overall one of my go to summer ipas, so much flavor in a drinkable body, this is everywhere for a reason."
""
""

"Poured into a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass. Full inch+ of off-white head that never completely disappeared throughout session. Copper, golden color that is completely and intensely clear. Nose offers bready malts, and faint hop aroma. Taste is malt and hop balance perfected, which is not exactly preferred in the American IPA style. So I'm not taking issue with the beer, just the genre that it's listed under here, according to BA's definition of an American IPA. The brewery brochure simply says it's an IPA, so this may be more accurate. Flavor is certainly floral, some definite cascade hoppiness, and finishes with an unexpected sweet/malty appearance. I can't put my finger on it, perhaps ?mead? which would go along with the floral nature to the beer. Mouthfeel, again, is lighter than one would expect from an IPA. If it were styled as a Pale Ale I may have given it a perfect rating across the board. All this being said, I more than thoroughly enjoyed this beer. So much so that I could drink it all day long. Beer substitute for water? Thank you very much Harpoon!"
""
""
"Overall, this is a good beer. It's nowhere near my favorite IPA. I just wish the Harpoon IPA had a bigger hop taste and smell. I live in Massachusetts, so this beer is very easy for me to find. This is one of the beers that everyone from New England has/should have tried at some point in their craft beer journey."

I really like the floral flavor, and the aroma is very pleasing to the nostrils when in that IPA mood. the mouth feel is pleasantly dry like a pale ale should be, and it accomplishes all this without killing your palate for the night. as far as East Coast American IPAs go, I really like this one. wonderfully mellow, without being boring, or bland."

"Overall I thought that was an Ok beer and a slightly above average example of an American IPA, if the flavor was as nice as the aroma was then this beer would be able to hold it's own against some of the better American IPA's. This beer had good drinkability. it went down smooth, wasn't filling, and it wasn't too bitter, I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty good and fragrant, there were a lot of things going on and it turned out to smell pretty weed like which wasn't a bad thing with this beer and was actually one of the highlights. What I like least about this beer was the lack of hops in the flavor, more hop flavors and more bitterness would be much more appealing, but it feels like this was much hopier at one point and it tasted like the hops have faded so this beer might be old, but with no bottling date I can't be sure. I would buy this beer again if I can find a fresh bottle, I think Harpoon is available in Michigan, but I have only seen it once and it was their Winter Warmer and I haven't seen anything else from Harpoon since. I recommend giving this beer a shot if you are an American IPA fan. This beer was much better then their Winter Warmer, and I'm sure if it was fresh it would be even better, but as it stands out now it's pretty close to being an average American IPA, if it wasn't for the aroma, it would be below average. This wasn't a really impressive IPA, but it wasn't bad by any means, I would like to try it again and I would like to try more from this brewery to get a better feel for them, because as it stands now I am not that interested in them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Plenty drinkable, went well with the deep-dish pizza. In the end though, nothing special - perhaps an average example of an AIPA. Good simplicity in the flavor, but a letdown in aroma so not an outstanding AIPA overall."
""
""
""
""
"A nice clean standard IPA."
""
""
"So my initial disappointment is pocketed in that backstory. If you take away any expectations it is a decent beer. It's well balanced, and can be used to introduce newcomers to the idea of an IPA, as it is not overwhelming and is fairly smoothe to drink. If you are familiar with the microbrew community/are looking for a strong American IPA, though this isn't going to be what you're looking for. Approach it with an open mind and remove labels such as style and you might enjoy it. Speaking of florid..."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best by 4/15/2012. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a nice 2 finger dense off white head with great retention that reduces to a cap that lingers. Some spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of pine, herbal, floral, citrus, grass, caramel, and a bit of honey sweetness. Decent aromas that are on the weak side. Taste of big pine, citrus, herbal, floral, caramel, biscuit, grass, and graininess. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of biscuit, pine, herbal, citrus, and grass on the finish for a bit. Some good malt and flavor balance with bitterness. Medium carbontion and body; with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Some prickly carbonation present as well, but it still drinks very smoothly. No alcohol presence in the taste or finish. Overall this is a solid and pretty enjoyable IPA."
""
""
"Orange color with a white head that fades, and a moderate to good amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is fragrant with some nice flowery and citric hop aromas, paired with some fruity estery aromas of apple jelly, and just a touch of sweet caramel aroma. The palate is soft with some good pale and caramel malt flavors, with a back drop of estery fruit. Harpoon IPA finishes with more fruit and malt up front, then ends with a mildly bitter, citric hop bite that slightly lingers."
""
""

"Balanced and mild, no flavors are overly extreme. It's a decent IPA, especially for the price, however I'd say it's more of a starter IPA. It is palatable to those sensitive to much more invasive hop flavors."

"Pours a hazy yellow with small white head. Aroma of grass and hay, some sweet malt, with not a lot of aromatics for the style. This one had some weird flavors going on. A little bready malt mixed with some unwelcome spice. The hops were not up front and the sweetness was not balanced with bitter. Not impressed, despite Leviathan being a great IPA. I am hoping I just grabbed an older bottle, but when I originally had this I didn't pay much attention to those sorts of things."

"O: Solid ale – very balanced and well hopped!"
""
""
"O- This is an good IPA, its very drinkable but seems to lack enough spicy hop kick in the smell and taste department. however, because of this, you could easily drink a few."
"Definition of an average IPA. Its quite drinkable but the flavor is just ho hum."
"This beer poured out with a nice looking golden color with a thick looking white head on top. The head leave some scattered lacing on the glass with a decent retention. The smell of the beer was hoppy, with a nice amount of malt on the nose too. The taste of the beer is hoppy but not hard to handle, it's a subtle IPA. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean feeling. Overall it's a good social IPA, where you can drink this on a regular basis and not get too sick of it."

"Pours a deep golden color with a fluffy, sticky head of foam. Pleasing citrus nose. Taste is grapefuit, pine combined with earthy notes. Terrific balance with this beer. Great sudsy mouthfeel. Always has been my ""go to"" beer of choice. It never disappoints."

"Rather disappointing as an IPA. The hops are not very well-served, overemphasized sweetness and grains, thus not as hoppy as it should be. And at only 5.9% ABV, it's a rather weak one."
"A good beer for sure but its lacking as far as IPA’s are concerned."

"O: pretty good American IPA, maltier than most AIPA's, but hey I'd come back to it"
"This is my favorite beer. I could drink it everyday, if it weren't for becoming an alcoholic. I love local beer, and this is the best in the Boston area. Deep malty color, medium body, great hoppy taste this is my IPA standard and furthermore standard beer. Long live Harpoon IPA!"

Can think of countless other IPA's that are <6% abv that provide a better experience related to this style. Shouldn't have bought a sixer. Oh well."

"Pours a nice clear golden hue with a small off white head with nice lacing. Earthy piney hops, some spicy grapefruit hit the senses followed by some nice malt and yeast. Taste of earthy piney hops, some nice citrusy grapefruit notes and some nice malt and yeast. Palate is a nice medium to full body, and good carbonation. Finishes with an earthy piney hoppiness, some spicy grapefruit tones balanced by some nice biscuit caramel malt, some yeast and a bit of a nutty flavor. Overall a nicely balanced and drinkable IPA."

"Overall, this is a pleasant brew. The sweeter taste than many IPAs means that this may be something to turn to if you're looking for a nice, easy-drinking, sessionable IPA. Sadly, with so many IPAs out there, Harpoon IPA may fall to the wayside. Good stuff, just nothing about it really screams ""unique""."
"Pours a hazy orange with about 2a fingers of head that retains pretty well, lots of citric hops on the nose. Some critic and biscuits sweetness up front but it finishes with a citric bouquet of hops that rounds it out nicely. Decent carbonation and light to medium in body. Decent ipa but nothing really stands out about. Could make a good session ipa if the hop bitterness didn't build so quickly and in a bad way."
"Pours a pretty crystal clear copper orange with a half inch finger head that thins to a slimy lace. Fruity hop characteristics on the nose met with sweet bready malts, nice peach or orange picked up in the hops, and light and subtle alcohol like sugar on the end. Bitter hops flood the tongue, but do not over take it, the mellow malt smooths it out on the end, leaves a slightly bitter finish. Light-Medium on the body creamy and smooth, very easy to drink. Overall; This beer is a nice and easy session IPA, it doesnt have a dominate hop presence and thats what does it in for me. I need more hop out of my IPA than what this gives me, considering that, back to the drawing board."
"Overall, this is a decent IPA. Good malt backbone, very nice carbonation and mouthfeel. The only down side are the hops. Just too bitter and not enough citrus or aroma."
"Overall: Nothing special going on here. A non offensive IPA thats pretty easy to drink and would be at home on a hot day."
"D: drinks like a lightly hopped fruit punch. however, this AIPA is certainly lacking a punch. in the craft beer world where there is an abundance of tasty hoppy pales, this is a pass."
"Overall, this was a bit different than expected and thus it's ranking could be affected. I was a bit let down, but it's still not a bad beer by any means."
"Overall: A solid beer that is certainly drinkable and refreshing. Not going to be a staple in my fridge, but I am definitely glad I was able to try it."
"O: To me this is an above average beer and just an average IPA. Nothing is bad about the beer, however the flavors and aroma are a little tame and light. Definitely a sessionable IPA."
"Poured on-tap at a TGIFridays and served in a weisse-vase, the beer is a bright copper-gold coloring, with a chestnut color in the depths. Very thin film of white head atop the brew. Light and green nose, with spicy notes throughout, and an overall blend of grapefruit and oregano. The flavor is caramel malt forward, with a roasted character, followed by grapefruit sweet and tart, and then ending with a flush of fresh, green, wet hops at the end, and peppery/all-spice highlights throughout. Grapefruit sweet and tart aftertaste, with hops spice and bitters. The finish is quick, clean, and dry. Tasty!"
"Overall a good beer though it's a little one dimensional. It's not the best IPA on the market, but it's one of my go-to's when I'm in a pinch."
"this was a pretty straightforward IPA, but it was done well. Good for when in the mood for an IPA, but it isn't a real blow away one"
"Overall: Not a great beer, but not too shabby either. This beer has a good scent and color but the taste is a little to bitter and the feel is a major let down"
"Overall: Not too shabby an IPA. It's better-balanced than most and is more sessionable but it lacks that special something to really put it over the top. Definitely worth a try and something I'll probably come back to in the future."
"Overall - this was a good IPA and will be glad to have anotherone at a later date"
"Clear medium gold color. Moderate white head that sticks around and leaves behind thick sheets of lacing. Aroma is subdued but grassy, with pale malts providing for a mellow background. Flavor is fairly hoppy, with grass and herbs as the main component. Also found a bit of drying wheat and some cheap tasting pale malts. Medium body. Easy to drink, but a bit unsettling at the same time. Average IPA at best."
"A medium bodied affair that leaves you wanting more for some reason, maybe if there were stronger and richer hops tastes there would be a different reason for wanting more."
"O: It doesn't resemble an IPA at all. Potentially a Pale Ale...Not my favourite Harpoon offering. I would not recommend, but I might grab one more to see if it's better than this one."
"D - This is a great east-coast stand-by!! I don't appreciate the last several 'B and C' grades some of the other members have given Harpoon IPA. The previous beer drinkers claim that this beer appears to be 'too-macro...' For cryin' out loud, this is one of the 1st post Bass IPAs that's been around forever (mid to early 90's) & paved the way for what everyone tastes now...was a fan in the back 'in the day' and remain one :~)"
"D: super drinkalbe for an IPA"
"D: Not my fave IPA, but I would put a few away quickly."
"The aftertaste is consistent with the taste. Good hop, but when that adjunct malt flavor comes around, it tends to stick around."
"(That's on the exam.)"
"this is on of the lightest tasting ipas ive had. well balanced and good flavor. the flavor does well to mask the abv."
"Depressing head formation with a clear light amber hue of a body. Lightly piney, citrus nose carried by more of a grain scent. The taste is balanced but weak, the light hop bitterness coats the tongue as the malt washes over hardly leaving a trace or influence. Maybe I’ve been spoiled but I expect a bit more out of my IPAs, at least the leviathan is incredible."
"Pours a pretty light copper color with a thin head and no lace. Smell is nice. Fruity hops. Melon, pineapple. Maybe a little weak, but good. Taste is far drier than the nose would imply. Thin piney hops without a lot of malt backbone. Medium to low carbonation and thin mouthfeel. Not bad, but not something I'll go out of my way for."
"Overall a pretty decent IPA. Not one of my faces but I would drink it again."
"This is an excellent IPA for a restaurant franchise to offer because it’s nothing too overpowering and has good drinkability. I probably could have paired it with any of their menu items. I happened to have a cheeseburger with French onion soup. This beer offers such a neutral palate - it could probably go with just about any cuisine."
"O: Nothing offensive about it, just a bit boring. Seemed lacking in oomph. Just needs a little something more to get it to solid. Not a bad option in the greater Boston area though, where it may be the best draft beer available."
"The CPJ"
"O: For an IPA this one is suprisingly light-bodied and not very memorable. Goes down easy, but then again so do the less expensive budlights of this world."
"Overall an ok IPA. One of the more boring ones I've had. Not likely to ever buy again."
"Overall, this was a pretty tasty brew. It could have been a bit more fresh, but the beer is still pretty damn good."
"O. Not what I'm looking for in an IPA. I like a balanced IPA, and this one is very balanced, but it doesn't have enough ""oomph"" in it, especially on the hop end."
"Had this on tap at this evenings summer brewfest in Norfolk, VA. Pours a nice golden copper color with a good finger and a half white head that leaves some lacing. Smell was of spicy hops and citrus, grapefruit and orange came to mind. Taste followed smell, but hops were a bit subdued. It was a balanced flavor, though, and rather easy drinking for it's ABV. Overall this is a good IPA offering, but there are better."
"Fresh sixer in Boston MA. Poured into a glass and A was wonderful, golden and very clean. This was highlight of the brew despite my nostalgia around it. S was weak malty flavor with light hops. T left much to be desired as it was certainly a pale ale to me, not an IPA. BUMMER. M was okay but nothing special and O it was disappointing. Light, flavorless IPA with a nice color as its best asset."
"O: I really enjoy this beer and frequently pick it as my favorite IPA that is widely avaialable, im my experience this brew is much better on tap than it is out of the bottle, I have not yet had it out of a can but i look forward to trying that as well"
"O- This is the beer that got me into hops so it will always have a special place with me, but not quite up to my standards now. Not saying this is a bad beer, but there are many more IPAs out there far better than this one."
"Overall, this is a very solid beer. Considering the price, this beer is constantly stocked in my fridge."
"O) An average IPA not a standout but solid. I'd have another."
"Overall: I was always aware of Harpoon from a young age, and after reading reviews about this beer, I wasn't expecting much. What I got however, was a very nice middle of the road IPA that makes a perfect go-to beer."
"o - Overall a pretty nice IPA that got me through the day. The friends of mine who did try it all enjoyed it a lot; I would think this could be a very good low ABV IPA to bring to a summer BBQ or gathering to introduce some non-crafat beer drinkers to craft beers. Would certainly have it again."
"O: great IPA, a regular to drink, though not super hoppy and somewhat low alcohol level"
"The beer is crystal clear and light yellow hued. Effervescence lasts the duration of the session. The head is a finger thick and leaves some decent legs on the glass. The aroma is pretty weak, with only faint traces of hops. The flavor is better, with some pine and hop flavors and a lingering bitterness. Overall, an ok offering."
"D/O- With all the other good to great IPAs out there, don't waste your time with this one. ""Must be eight dollar beer night."""
"O- totally underwhelmed by this beer. It's not hyped, but harpoon makes decent stuff, but this just sucked."
"I wanted to go with below average, but I give this beer points for being a bit different."
"O= went well with all the dishes served, ranging from Indian and Tex-Mex appetizers to deep-dish supreme pizza to flatbread pizza. Enjoyable on its own, as well."
"I'm not a big fan of any IPA that is below 6%, but I thought I would go ahead and rate anyway. Well balanced IPA in the English style with a decent malt background and a burst of American Cascade hops. Reasonable color and aroma. Not the typical ""hop bomb"" IPA, but enough hops to still be a reasonable example of the style for a pale ale. Again, I don't think you can have an IPA below 6% - it should just be called a pale."
"Overall - Decent offering. A little lacking on the bitterness side, considering it's an IPA, but smooth and refreshing. I could definitely drink a few in a session. I would try and buy this again."
"The tasting wasn't very balanced. There is a lot of bitterness overwhelming almost everything else in the beer. I picked up some citrus, but it wasn't a good mix of flavors."
"Overall, a sessionable IPA, worthy of a try but not among the best out there."
"O- I found it to be good IPA, and a bit better on tap than out of the bottle. Might not meet some people's hop desires, but I liked the flavors and balance."
"Another Thursday, another tasting at Bliss. This offering pours a clear golden straw topped by a finger or white foam. The nose comprises flowers, light grapefruit, orange zest, and very light lemon zest. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a mild contingent of caramel in the background. The body is a hefty light (or light medium...whichever y'all prefer), with a light moderate carbonation and a nearly dry finish. Overall, a pretty nice IPA, nothing outstanding, but something easily drinkable."
"O – This is a much more subdued taste that I was expecting from an IPA. Was sweeter then most and not quite as crisp. Not bad but not great either. It is very drinkable. As always its worth a try and I would certainly do that but there are better out there."
"O - Congrats Harpoon IPA: if you can't be the best, why not be the worst."
"Good feel, the body is light and the carbonation is solid. Overal, this has been a go to beer for me for quite some time. Glad to see this solid offering in cans these days."
"V: At the price I paid, not a great value, so it loses half a point. There are better IPAs for less money."
"Received this in my bierkraft order of a mixed case. I had tried before but not reviewed. It pours a nice coppery colour into my chalice. Smell immediately hits me from the opening and probably the most appealing attribute. Steady flow of carbonation and some gentle lacing upon dissapation of most of the head. Smell is citrusy, maybe apricot and grapefruit pineconish. Taste ranges in the same area of smell with some mild maltiness. Only drawback is that it overall seems subdued. Like a hopaliscious beer trapped in the body of a light beer. Other than the watered down appearance/taste, overall it is a satisfying beer. I could certainly recommend this for a springtime session on the beach. Cheers."
"O- Great aroma and good flavor. Score would be higher if this was classified as a pale ale or had more hops."
"O- a refreshing IPA thrashing was easy to drink."
"After bowling soiree....good friend brought a couple of bottles of Harpoon IPA so I had to try it!!! The color was clear and golden and had decent white head and laced quite well. The nose had a good hints of citrus hops and subtle floral undertones. The taste was a good balance of malt and pine/citrus. Mouthfeel was good...this is a good session IPA!!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: Drinkable and easy. Nothing wrong with this beer. Nothing outstanding about it either."
"Overall a very nice IPA indeed. Could become a staple beer for those that want a lot of flavor but don't like some of the other hyper-hopped up IPA's out there."
"Poured a slightly hazy amber, with some carbonation, and a humble white head. Faint aroma of citrus hops and caramel malts. Pretty smooth tasting at first with malts and nuts up front, and hops coming in soon afterward with some bitterness. Citrus and pine notes. Light-medium mouthfeel with some stale bitterness in the aftertaste. Fairly drinkable."
"mouthfeel was adequate and over all I would say this is a decent IPA but I have so many more I would buy first."
"AVERAGE AT BEST!"
"D - An average beer, even given the potential style mis-categorization. It's an easy drinker at it's low ABV, but there weren't any stand-outs here for me."
"Overall a tasty, good, and drinkable ipa."
"O: A solid low gravity American IPA. Definitely one of the prototypical east coast IPAs. It's balanced but still has an assertive hop presence."
"O: nice drinkable IPA, not really standing out, but worth a try"
"O-Not much to offend any one. Bland for an IPA, however this would be a good beer to introduce someone to the style."
"D - Very drinkable. The beer has a pretty good malt hop balance, but just not enough of either (especially hops). The aroma and the taste were both a bit too subtle and needed some more kick. Still a really crisp and refreshing beer."
"overall - not a tremendous beer but a light ipa in my mind. very easy drinking and nice to get back in the saddle, without spinrsx, i would have never made it this far!"
"I rated 4.5 overall because despite the lack of distinctive taste, this IPA still holds true to the name even if it is a bit gentle. If you're already a hop-head, avoid this brew as it will be far too light. But if you're trying to get your friends to become hop-heads or you want a ""sessionable"" IPA, this will certainly fill that niche."
"Scores: Appearance 4.5/5; Aroma 2/5; Taste 3/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 3.5/5"
"Drinkability - This is a very solid beer by Harpoon. Very good in all aspects. I would be more than happy to drink this if it was available. Worth a try for sure. Well balanced in all aspects. Very easy to drink."
"T--"
"Served from bottle into a shaker. Poured golden yellow-orange with a three finger bone white head that subside to one finger slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of pine, pine resin, and pine hops. The flaovr was of sweet malt, pine hop, and pine resin. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall I was not a massive fan of this one. If you like pine this is the beer for you... It was even more piney than Sierra Nevada Pale Ale which I couldn't believe. Not balance in the flavor at all, just pine, pine, pine. The aroma was the best part about this one, but that's not saying much. Did I mention pine???"
"The mouthfeel is delicate, just like the brew. That said, I'd like a bit more thickness. The drinkability is very good, this glass didn't last long in front of me at all. Overall, I think this is a great IPA. I like the fact where it was ""hop-forward"" without punching me in the face with hops. Just a very well made and drinkable beer with just enough of a hoppy bite to satisfy me. Not the extreme ""punch you in the face with hops"" that many people expect from IPAs, but it's just a delicious beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a snifter with a nice amber-golden color and a white head that dissipates quickly. Little lacing. Smell is floral with a hint of citrus. Taste is more of the floral notes, balance is nice. Feel is smooth and medium bodied with a nice, oily finish. Overall a good beer and a tasty IPA."
"A very good beer to introduce people to a true IPA. Quaffable"
"O: this is a good ipa. not great. good. i would expect it to have a bit more alcohol to keep up with the current crop of ipas on the market."
"This a session IPA. It's light in the body so it's easy to go down. A nice taste makes this a IPA to try."
"Drinkabilty - Its easy to drink but the flavor of this doesnt do much for me. So much better ipas out there, this one needs some work espcially with the hops. Easy to drink and low in alcohol gives it some points, other then that, nothing special here"
"More of a pale ale then ipa. Very refreshing and enjoyable. Just needs more flavor and profile. Not a world class beer but one that would be Good after mowing the grass."
"Atmosphere is good. Nice look, good head, and some decent lacing. Nose is a really good combination of hops, citrus, sweet and spice. Flavor is pungent and hoppy with a citrus and sweet. Tastes like it smells. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"I will say this one served it's purpose though, as I and the rest of the wifey's Birthday bunch left (well, got asked to leave) rather toasty."
"On tap into a pint glass. Initially served a bit too cold and needed a chance to warm up a bit. Poured a lighter golden color than I expected for an IPA with a nice creamy white head. Not a lot going on in the nose, little caramel and roastiness, not a lot of the typical hop aromas. Flavor was good but light on the hops for an IPA. Mostly caramel and roasted malt, with slight fruit notes. Hops are really only present in a slightly bitter dry finish. Smooth and drinkable, pretty good beer I just didn't think it was a great fit for the style. Reminded me more of a slightly more bitter red ale or the like than true IPA."
"This was my first time with this beer on draft and I must say that I enjoyed it much more than the few times that I've had it out of the bottle. Lots of fresh bright citrus flavors and bitterness here, which were well balanced and the creamy body here kept this very drinkable. This has a bit of an Americanized British IPA hybrid thing going on and I really liked it."
"Pours crystal clear golden color w/good carb & nice white head. Smells faintly hoppy - citrusy. Doesn't punch you in the face w/hops. Malt (crystal) caramel flavors delicately hopped. By today's standards, this one is a weak IPA because of the lack of hop character. Light to medium mouthfeel. Slightly bitter by today's IPA standards. Nicely drinkable."
"O: Although no maltiness detected, sweetness in the nose and mouth balances the finishing bitterness. Nice!"
"Overall, a good IPA that is balanced but lacking in the hop aroma and flavor for me. Not bad by any stretch but also not that exciting. I won't remember this one tomorrow. Avail here in TX. Rotation - good but too many other better ones out there to buy again unless once on tap. [N;O]"
"Medium body, lighter carbonation, fairly soft on the palate. Drinks quietly and quickly, as the flavor is forgettable along with nearly everything else about this beer. This is probably one of the more boring IPAs I've ever had."
"drinks fairly decent, would go down easy on a hot summer day. i wouldnt buy this again, this bottle came in a variety pack, but if offered, i would drink it. maybe a fresher bottle would be better."
"Drinkability is very good, nice balance of malt flavor and bitter hops."
"OVERALL GRADE: C+/B-"
"medium-light bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation. very drinkable."
"D - Unoffensive IPA that could be plowed through."
"Cheers!!!"
"D - Very drinkable...or more like sippable. This is a solid beer, with no shortage of the good stuff you want in an American IPA. I'd buy it again, if I was in the mood for an IPA, and there wasn't another one available that I haven't tried or have and liked better."
"Usually on top over bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a deep golden straw color with a thick off white head that makes nice lace on the glass. Aroma of floral hops,and a hint of bread and maybe a note of sweet peaches . Flavor is piny faintly citrus over a light toasted and biscuity malt taste. The palate is medium bodied with good carbonation and a hopy bitterness that lingers on the tongue. A very sessionable and enjoyable beer."
"I'd love to try this beer fresh. Not avail out here, so had to go with what I could get. Seems like it has the bones of a good beer"
"D - Not the greatest IPA but a nice one that is readily available all over Boston where I bought this. Good for watching the hockey game but not something I would session or look for again. Worth a try though."
"I was more excited about trying this beer than I was pleased with the beer. Poured yellow with a little head that receded quickly. It smelt like it was going to deliver in the bitterness department but all around was a very mild beer. Perhaps a beginner's IPA, in that's it's easy to drink and gives you a small idea what to expect from an IPA."
"FourthBeer potential: AVERAGE. Nothing particularly exciting in this beer when compared to IPAs, but it is certainly drinkable."
"Haven't found an IPA that I've ever liked guess I still haven't. Can't see what all the hype is about, sorry!"
"Pours a pale gold color, quick rush of thin, soapy head, gone quickly. Scent is pale, light, wheat malt with faint touch of stale grassy hops and even fainter touch of lemon, orange and pine. Taste is as disappointing as scent. Pale all around, no malt backbone and no hop bite. Faint flavors of pale malt and grassy hops, some mustiness. Lighter side of medium bodied. Disappointment, if BMC light was dry hopped with year old hops, this would be it."
"This is a pretty good beer. It is dark in it's taste but still good. The smell is the best I've smelled in a while. The taste is fairly strong with a surprisingly sweet aftertaste. It is sweet but still heavy. Pretty good but not goo on drinking many at a time. Solid."
"D - Pretty good, I would have a couple of these no problem. Solid job by Harpoon."
"D - Really forgettable IPA. Balance yet nothing really stands out in being sweet or hoppy. It just exists."
"The first word that comes to mind when I think of this beer is plain. Not bad, but not too special. This is a middle of the road IPA-easy to drink, but just not that great."
"Very drinkable although boredom might set in."
"This was a very good IPA, the flavor was good and perfectly balanced. This might be the easiest drinking IPA I've had."
"Beer is medium to thin in body and tastes like sulfur with some moderate bitterness on the backend. The overall feel of hte beer is OK, the drinkability is fine but this is clearly a bargain basement crappy IPA for the masses from Mass. I am unimpressed and will continue to overlook this particular IPA."
"Where is the IPA?"
"D: This is a very drinkable beer. Not the best IPA I have ever had by far, but very good. A nice summer beer, great for any hop-head."
"This is another one of my go-to brews. It's sometimes hard to get but is often available in my area. It is a good session beer for me as the ABV is not too high and it goes well with most food. I haven't seen it outside of my area on recent vacations - I do check around to see what's available. So I guess I'm lucky that I can usually get this top-shelf selection."
"D: would drink all night long."
"Drinkability: Crirsper than what I would normally order or expect from an IPA, but pleasantly bitter. Not sure if this would have more character out of a bottle."
"RJT"
"This is a very drinkable IPA, but pretty tame by today's standards. A lot of people think they have dumbed down this recipe, but if the brewery is telling the truth then this is the exact same recipe and all that has changed is peoples' perceptions due to the other extremely hopped IPAs on the market. Whatever the case may be, this beer is still quite tasty, but it is no longer a go to."
"D- The standard of IPAs. Nothing out of this world, but a great refreshing go-to beer."
"This is a great standard IPA. It embodies everything about the name that it should. It is fairly average, but the perfect example of what the standard should be. It pours golden with a small head into a pint glass. smells hoppy and fruity with some very subtle malt notes. It's flavor is quite nice and is a very refreshing brew. good mouthfeel and decent drinability."
"D: Very drinkable. Sessionable IPA. Its not weak, but smooth and well-balanced hop and malt bill."
"Would have liked to sample fresher...I'll have to revisit."
"A good looking,good smelling, great tasting beer that is reasonable in price and very available in our area. It is nothing super special, but I never seem to pass one up. I have had many folks who claim to not like IPA enjoy this beer. I think that is because of the balance hops,malt & alcohol"
"for taste, the usual hops, malt, citrus were there. just a tad, like very slighty, on the plain side - could have had more bitterness to it. but overall easy drinking and a good ipa, definitely enjoyed it."
"Overall, a very pleasant beer; it won't change your world, but it is a solid contribution."
"Nose is rather underwhelming in the hops department. Smells of sweet floral and apple, a dash of lemon that seems somehow artificial. Tastes disappointing as well. Plenty of bready malt, general fruity sweetness, a bit of lemony/medicinal something that could be construed as hoppiness. Old bottle, possible? I'm inclined to think not given the turnover of the store in question. What I'm not inclined to do is to try this again."
"In summation, everything about this beer feels weak for the style, the ABV of only 5.9%, the lack of good hop bitterness throughout and even the appearance is a bit drab by comparison to some of the other top contenders. It's certainly not a bad beer, just not a very impressive one. If I'm going for an IPA I'd much rather have a Dogfish Head or preferably Stone."
"D. This beer is very drinkable and would be perfect for lounging by the pool. It seems a little watered down but still good."
"Drink - This is an above average beer that to me tasted a little bit like a pilsner. I'm not sure I'd seek it out again, but I'm happy to have tried it."
"Drinkability- with a good taste and mouthfeel ill have another."
"Had on tap at papa razzi restaurant in boston with dinner. Showed up a clear orange with a thin head in a pint glass. Pretty calm looking in the glass but the lacing practically coats the side as I drank the brew. Nice piny citrusy hops smell. Doesn't seem oveewhelming in the hops, just how I like it. Taste however is much more bitter than the nose lends. Overall nice IPA with a touch of bitterness. Pretty medium bodied and an easy drinker. Could be balanced a bit more for my tastes, but a standard IPA."
"If you like IPAs, and haven't tried this one, it's most definitely characteristic of the style. Good interpretation by Harpoon (my first run in with this brewery)."
"D: meh. This used to be one of my favorite beers in college but I guess I've grown out of it. It's not that it's a horrible beer, it's fairly drinkable, but it's a horrible IPA. If you go in with the expectation of an American IPA (or any other type), you may be sorely disappointed."
"D- I find this beer to be extremely drinkable. Light but not certainly not dull, this citrusy IPA could fight warm summer nights."
"Overall this is not a hard IPA to drink. The bitterness does not over power, and makes for a relatively easy to drink beer. Not worth revisiting or reordering with the plentiful amount of great offering available today."
"On Tap at the bar. Copper color, no carbonation. Aroma of grapefruit, citrus hops and biscuit malt. Medium body, very sharp. Spicy hops and grapefruit dominate the mouth with biscuit malt in the background. Long bitter finish. Nice, easy drinking IPA."
"Not great, though not undrinkable."
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours a nice copper color with a white head and some good lacing on the way down. The taste is malty with some pine and floral hops seeking to balance. The flavor is mostly malt with a bit of bread and some light floral hops. A bit of bitterness and a good body. Drinks well enough, but not too fantastic."
"Serviceable enough as a session beer, but certainly not what I think of when I think IPA."
"D - Just not very enjoyable. A chore to drink when compared to the Lagunitas IPA I just had. Pretty disappointing."
"Drinkability - Fairly standard. Good choice to a beer to go with for the evening, especially at bars close to BC that have limited selections."
"D: Its just ok. Can't put my finger on it completely. I feel like the flavor combinations don't blend together for for my enjoyability/drinkability."
"Pairs very well with my spicy indian dumplings with spinach and flat bread. More Indian restaurants need to sell IPAs."
"This stuff is very drinkable, need to keep some of this around yearound, I could serve this to almost anyone and they would find it a good choice."
"D- There isn't much flavor, but at least there aren't any off flavors"
"Again, a little sweet but a fine light hopiness that drives the drinkability."
"Clear yellow color with thin white head. Slight piney smell with a hint of hops. This beer does not really taste like an IPA. The hop flavor is very weak with little bitterness. Tastes more like an Pale Ale. Not a bad flavor, just not an IPA. Drinks very smooth and goes down easy. Overall a good beer, just not worthy of a high IPA grade."
"about halfway through the beer i had a bowl of curry pork and the beer went really well with that"
"D: Very enjoyable, a good IPA that is not overhopped or overhyped. Check it out."
"Overall: I seem to have at least on Harpoon IPA a month living in Boston. It can often be the best beer in the room at a party or non-beer specialty bar. However, this is not one to try if you are at a place with other regional or national IPAs on hand."
"D - Not my new favorite IPA, but it's not terrible either, a good place to start, and to enjoy on a hot summer day."
"Still, one of my favorite IPA's. Harpoon is always solid."
"D-A really meh beer for me, not one I would seek out again."
"Good all around, but really nothing special, for me at least."
"D - See above; very clean flavors, very easy drinking."
"For a beer or two, it won't kill you."
"D- very drinkable decent IPA if youve got nothing else"
"Value: Pretty good, I paid $7.49 for a sixer."
"Drinkability - an excellent IPA, very well balanced and priced, easy to come by and easier to drink."
"I like this on a number of levels. First the smell is not overpowering, Some IPA's are a bit strong in the nose and this is un-offensive. The taste is good, if not a bit overly carbonated and this might contribute to its very drinkable nature. This is a good warm-up for those uninitiated in the more robust IPA's (think Dogfish Head). All in all, very enjoyable...."
"By the way, took a while to find it among all the Harpoons listed in the Beer Advocate reviews. Does this brewery really make a bazillion kinds of beer? Guess so. Drives home the fact this really isn't a microbrew brand even though it's relatively young."
"Overall this IPA was fairly forgettable - certainly not a bad beer but not one I'd be in a rush to revisit."
"Pours transparent golden with large white head on top. Aroma of grains, some light malt, subtle lemon, grass and spice. Tastes of slight spice, sweet malt, aggressive grassy and citrus hops, bitter towards the finish with a slight buttery characteristic. Light, crisp, upfront carbonation and a damn good IPA. A summer session with great flavor."
"Light copper color with perfect clarity. Very thin head that didn't last. A quick swirl of the glass rejuvenated the white cap. Light floral aroma with a hint of biscuit. Light hoppy flavor in the beginning, lemon and orange, that rolls into light malty, biscuity taste and a very clean, almost dry finish. Pretty light for an IPA. The biscuity flavors and finish were more reminiscent of an English Pale Ale. Very easy to drink."
"Besides the ABV and aroma, this was a very pleasant beer. I liked the rich color, as well as the smooth, semi-dry body and nice drinkability. I could put away a couple of these no problem (and I did). Wish there was a little more hop flavor than what was present. There's other East Coast IPAs out there that I'd probably go for over this in the future, but this was definitely worth the try, and would be a decent fall back beer."
"Overall, middle of the road IPA. Many out there that are far better, but a refreshing beer, for the style, on a hot summer day."
"I had high expectations. A unique beer with a unique name. Unfortunately, it was too bitter for my liking. Probably the most bitter beer that I have ever had. It was not watery at all, but if you are a big fan of bitterness then you should like this beer"
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is dominated by hops. Taste is also very hoppy, not much else going on, considerable bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has decent drinkabilty. Overall this is a fairly good beer."
"More similar to an English IPA than its American counterpart...Very smooth, well balanced flavor with decent amount of nutty maltiness that is cut short from the mild hop back...Would view this beer as a good example of a session beer...Not my favorite beer by any means"
"I've had APA's that I'd say are stronger than this, but as a person who does not identify as a ""hophead", I find this to be a very drinkable offering and I can appreciate an IPA that allows some malt to intermingle in the flavor profile."
"D- actually, I find this beer rather drinkable but more as an apa than an ipa, like others have noted. Probably wouldn't buy again. There are too many other ipa's out there that have passed this one by."
"The taste is more malty than hoppy, and it is probably the least hopped up IPA you'll typically find. The hops are slightly floral and fruity but very subdued, too subdued actually, and the caramel notes, the crisp malts, the English yeasty presence defines this beer much more so than the hops. That's not a good thing for an IPA to hand its hat on. Trying this next to a Stone IPA was a real eye opener. Sometimes beer reviews are best done in tandem with another beer of the same style. Let's just say that Stone killed Harpoon IPA, but that doesn't mean that Harpoon was necessarily bad. The beer is fairly light bodied, plenty carbonated, a touch drying in the finish, but nothing special in any category. It's okay, decent, drinkable, and that's all I can say."
"D: Quite drinkable, even for a very drinkable style."
"Drinkability - Exceptional. The bitterness blends quite well and is not overpowering. This beer goes great with anything. Just an all around winner."
"D: Very drinkable, but hops are too low-key for it to be an IPA."
"OK, so this beer was not bad. At all. But I do not think it is an IPA! Judging according to style, it was very weak and boring by IPA standards. Both the malt and hop notes were muted. But the beer was very balanced in this regard, and if it was classified as a Pale ale, I would have probably given it at least a grade higher."
"Drinkability: A great session beer, very refreshing."
"Drinkability: All in all, very pleasant. Not exceptional - I would pick Summit over Harpoon any day (if I were ever able to make the choice, that is), but I'm glad I asked the liquor store employee for a local with which I wasn't familiar. Even given the option between this and Sam Adams, if we're comparing local beers, I'd pick this."
"D-Highly drinkable extremely crisp and refreshing although would almost classify this as a pale ale slight on the mild side for an IPA overall a decent brew."
"Poured a light orange with a finger or two of white soapy head. Nice enough lacing. Smells of floral hops and a bit of bready malts. Some bitterness in the flavour, but not a ton. Taste has a nice level of hoppiness, but this isn't a hoppy beer. Carbonation was good. This is a nice beer for food as it won't overpower the flavours, but still is pleasant enough."
"Taste is a bit harsh but it mellows as it warms. There's a sharp aftertaste on the back of my tongue that's quite piney. The carbonation is very full and creamy. Pretty easy drinking but that harsh pine resin flavor takes it down a bit."
"Drinkability is good. The ABV is unnoticeable as are the hops to some degree. Maybe this would make for a good starter IPA if someone were new to the style. Not much going on in the aroma or flavor, but it is easy to drink. This beer is pretty common around here, so I'll probably end up drinking it again, but nothing worth seeking out. The Leviathan Imperial IPA on the other hand is definitely worth seeking out. Kind of surprised there is such a large difference between the two."
"D - I feel this would be much more drinkable if the carb level was a bit lower. Still, its a good choice if the only other options are macros."
"In my 5 years of drinking this beer has gone under the radar. I'm pleasantly surprised by this."
"I got two-plus fingers' of tawny head from my pour, demonstrating that the rain today is finally killing the oppressive head and humidity of the past week. As the head slowly reduced, a good bit of sticky lacing formed, which was a nice trade-off. The CAN read ""copper-colored", but it was a light copper for which I will extend the benefit of the doubt, with NE-quality clarity. No qualms with their mention of ""a floral aroma"" on the nose, however. Citrusy and definitely hoppy - that's how I like my beer from a CAN! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a great hoppy spiciness on the tongue. What a welcome relief from some of my recent CANs! This both tasted like something and it tasted good, also. The finish was bitter, dry, and refreshing, just the way I like my AIPAs to be. I would definitely put this is my cooler, but it is sadly a limited test run in New England to see about the viability of CANning their beers. I was lucky to get some but I hope that they make it a routine endeavor."
"D: A low ABV makes this easy to drink. Although the hop flavoring is not as potent as expected."
"pours a really clear copper color with a 1 finger head and some lacing.but wow this was the clearest ipa ive ever seen.the smell was some floral citrus hops and some toffee notes maybe burnt caramel..the taste was the same it was a mild taste in hops but at the same time it had an odd burnt toffee taste followed by sweet malts..mouth feel was medium but not full flavored or balanced that well..this is not a great ipa IMO not balanced not flavorful"
"Light to medium body; nice resinous hop bitterness balanced with good sweetness. Overall a solid IPA that's well balanced, if a bit low on hop aroma or flavor."
"Clear brassy yellow with a fine eggshell cap that leaves a little fine lace on the glass. Pale malt and citric cascade hops in the mild aroma, nice but a little understated. Wow..it's been awhile since I've had this one, about 7 or 8 years I think! I am amazed how mild this beer seems to me now but still tastes the same as I remember it too. Mild, tropical fruity hop notes and lightly toasted grain. The mild hop bitterness is well balanced by a sweet maltiness in the finish. On the leaner side of medium bodied with ample carbonation. This was one of the first ""hoppy"" beers I got into when I first got the good beer bug along with SN pale ale. Things have certainly changed since '02 when this seemed like a big beer but, like an old shoe..it still fits and it still tastes good to me."
"Slight citrus hop aroma. Very toasty flavor profile. Starts with a lot of toasty and earthy flavor. Hints of caramel malt and semi sweetness. Not much hops for an IPA. Finishes with a bit of citrus and pine hops. Not a hop head beer and more of an APA than IPA, but a very good tasting beer nonetheless."
"The mouthfeel is medium to light bodied, with a low level of carbonation. Almost seems thin to me. The beer is fairly easy to drink, but it's other missing qualities make it a little more difficult to get down."
"d - light ipa, so quite easy to drink. just not my cup of tea."
"D - Very drinkable, especially in the summer."
"D- for my first harpoon, I really enjoy this. Some tasty ipa properties make this delicious. I will enjoy these with some greek dishes tonight"
"Would I buy more of it? - I am actually going to be picking up a couple 12-packs tomorrow to bring on a camping trip this weekend. Its affordable and will please the whole crew of people that are going. I might also pick up some of their Summer Beer as well."
"D: Bottom line, for the price, and for the quality this is a great deal. This is a reliable beer that even non-beersnobs enjoy. Nicely balances quality with price. Now it comes in a 12 pack of cans, which is great for the beach."
"D- a VERY drinkable beer, an easy choice at the bar for a dependable ipa. sometimes I look for a little more hops bittering."
"Not bad but not great. Pretty good price for a 6-pack."
"D: Great, A very nice session IPA. This one I had more than three and still was enjoying the taste a characters. Good ale."
"D: Okay drinkability but there's something a tad funky that makes it a bit wearing"
"Pretty average..."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Appearance was a hazy amber color with a thin, frothy head that quickly dissipated. Aroma was of earthy and floral hops, not overpowering. Taste was mildly hoppy, slight ly resinous.Some malt undertones. Goeas down easy..."
"D - should be labeled as an English IPA. decent at best, nice earthiness and would be good as a beginner IPA"
"Overall, an okay IPA, not particularly bad but not noteworthy. In my opinion, there are many better offerings out there at a similar price point."
"I would buy a 6 of these."
"Overall, a bit thin-bodied, but a decent ""everyday"" IPA to keep around."
"Harpoon IPA out of the can, it's nice to see an old friend in a different light. Picked up as a single out of an ice cold bucket..says it's canned in Utica, NY. Appearance is solid with a nice head although aroma seems a little muted but that might be to the almost frozen nature. Taste and drinkability are all around solid as always, one of the best everyday IPA's available and the fact that it's now canned you can almost insure that this beer will be even more ubiquitous at almost every event in New England during the summer..which ain't a bad thing. Cheers to Harpoon for canning this brew....makes one wonder how long it's going to be until Sam abolishes it's ""Beer Drinkers Bill of Rights", eats crow, and starts canning Summer Ale that other NE staple?"
"D: Overall, a fairly lackluster IPA. I had heard a lot of decent things about it, but in the end I'm dissapointed. I may give it a try again, but will pass for now."
"On tap at logan airport at the harpoon tap room. Not my first harpoon ipa. Nice cold pour, clear pale amber color with minimal head. Smells fresh and crisp, slightly metallic. Taste shows the metallic a bit too, thought nothing overwhelming. Mild bitterness, very palatable. Well balanced, but lacks a standout quality. Very drinkable, but not very memorable."
"D--Overall a solid citrusy, grassy IPA. A tasty brew without a ton of complexity."
"Holy hell extremely sessionable. This was the first IPA I tried while growing up; although its not the best its deffinatly a better one, a better one you can drink as much as you please at a measly 5.9% ABV"
"I don't see the beer as ""copper"" like the label claims, more of a deep gold color. Off-white head leaves whole rings of stick around the glass. Very clear with slow carbonation trails. Smell is a bit maltier than other IPA's I've tried. Very good combo of fresh grains and tropical, sweet hops. Taste mirrors the smell, and adds a new hops depth with some sour bitterness. Finishes tight with a defined alcohol feel. All in all, a solid IPA that I can see myself getting a few more of."
"D- This is the norm for a good session IPA I think. Nothing over the top with this beer. Just well balanced and refreshing. I always go back to this beer when I need a rest from the hop bombs and want to still drink a well made IPA."
"Drinkability - A fantastic session IPA with a slightly hoppy balance paired with excellent drinkability. Had with Mexican food."
"Taste is light on the malts, which is perfectly ok with me, and the hopping tastes fairly unique...maybe it is the lack of citrus and really not that much caramel malt. Pretty cool, I like it. Very refreshing IPA and a good warm weather beer. Mouthfeel is light and airy without any cloying sweetness. Carbonation is medium-high and adds to the thirst-quenching quality of the beer. Aside from the 100-barrel series, this might be the best tasting beer I have had from the 'Poon."
"An overly aggressive pour yielded a shit ton of off white head. It is a deep golden color. It has a nice fresh citrus aroma. The taste is citrus with a grapefruit finish. It is a very refreshing beer. It is not overly hoppy. It is an easy drinking beer. It really hits the spot after working outside for 12 hours."
"Feels like the type of beer you'd like to drink a 6-pack of. I may be off with this but to me this looks like a Pilsner IPA hybrid. Wonder what the recipe was."
"Clear, deep golden color with a big and fluffy slightly off-white head. Perhaps my pour was a little more aggressive than a few of the previous reviewers. The scent was big on floral hops with pine in the background. I actually found the smell to be better than the taste. Floral hops is the main taste with a nice bittering action at the finish. There's a sweet graininess mixed in that just didn't agree with me. Obviously, I'd rather see more hop presence, but it's a pretty decent and easy drinking beer nonetheless."
"D- Very drinkable IPA. I think this one falls under in the starter category for fans of IPAs it good but I'd much rather have others."
"Drinkability is good. A fairly well-rounded IPA, with some good features."
"T -"
"The palate takes this down well, a nice refreshing beer if somewhat dominated by a lingering bite of bitterness."
"Absolutely delicious! Plus 5.9% and $7/6-pack."
"Pours clear, light copper color. Thin head of foam, left thin string line of lace. Nice grassy hop aroma, some citus. Similar taste of grassy, earthy hops. Toasted malt adds enough sweetness to balance. Citrus nip at the end. Clean, slightly dry finish. Great balance, not overly hoppy (especially for a newbie), very drinkable, ideal sessional IPA."
"D - Light, decent introductory ipa."
"Going to the Brewery today. I'll rate this beer again after I've had it at the brewery."
"D: This is an extraordinary gateway IPA, not too hoppy, but very satisfying. It's the one IPA you can count on being at a bar, full of BMC, and SA (in New England). Definitely grab a sixer, or get it on tap with a meal, unless something different or better is available. A reliable brew!"
"Very clean, astringent palate that still has a little sweetness from the malts to keep this beer sessionable."
"D - Very drinkable for an IPA, but not a style I tend to have more than a few of."
"Drinkability is pretty good but I'd go for something with more flavor."
"D - I'm digging the drinkability on this. I'm alright with this."
"Cheers"
"The mouthfeel is perfectly acceptable, light, lots of carbonation, a bit oily, and it's a nice drinker. I would have again, although it's definitely not my favorite IPA."
"D - I can drink several over the course of the night. Others who don't like such bitterness won't want as many."
"Pours a honey color with a medium head and lace that hangs around. Smells of hops, bitters and citrus peel. But the taste! Bitter and hoppy without the face puckering sourness that often turns me off to IPAs. There are distinct notes of floral and berry, but overall this is a strongly hopped ale and a very finely made one at that. I will certainly be buying this one again and I'd recommend it for those who are unsure of trying IPAs - I'm still not a fan of them, but did like this beer."
"A great ipa. This beer has a copper color, does not have a very strong smell, average head, but delivers on taste. Has a very nice balance to it, the perfect amount of hops. It is extremely drinkable, it would be very easy to drink this beer frequently. Has a refreshing finish."
"I could drink a ton of these. It not the greatest, the hops are on the lower end of the spectrum. That won't keep me from drinking this."
"Overall, not a bad beer for Harpoon, one of my go-to breweries. There are better American IPAs out there, but this is a tried and true, consistently refreshing brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with a nice pinch from the carbonation."
"In that sense, it's highly drinkable, just not how I prefer my IPAs. It's a decent beer, but unoffensive and normal in every way."
"People talk about this as a session beer, and I think that it could certainly be that. I would almost go as far as to compare it to a hoppy pils or even a lager. It's just average. I guess I'm a bit disappointed and I will certainly hold out hope for a draft serving to see if somehow I got two separate bad batches, but I can't imagine that was the case. An underwhelming beer."
"Pale gold amber color, small head and little lacing. The smell was of fait hops. The taste was semi hoppy at first with a very noticeable malt finish. Good mouthfeel and a very drinkable beer. Not as hoppy as I would expect from am IPA, but this is still a solid beer."
"This is a very good beer. Like a lot of other reviewers I get the sense of APA more than IPA. But it does have that extra kick the boost it into IPA territory. I like it a lot. I would buy it again. But probably not too often with some many alternatives for the same price."
"The body is moderate. Would like to see the malt dry out a bit. The carbonation is light as well. Both would help some hops come out. Overall, limited even for pale standards."
"D - Very drinkable IPA, especially when fresh. This is a staple beer of mine...always in the fridge. Nothing flashy, just a good, solid, well balanced IPA. Perfect for a summer day after mowing the lawn, or as a companion with a pizza any time. Easy drinking - multiples of these in a session is easily doable."
"D- Definitely drinkable, just wish it had more of a hop presence to it. I probably wouldn't buy this one again just because there's so many other IPA's that are better examples of the style than this one."
"Golden light in color with a slight head. Smells of citrus hopyness present but not overwhelming. Well carbonated it hits the tongue first to prevent overt maltyness and finishes with a bitterness that dissipates. This beer is a easy drinking IPA one of my standbys."
"I was impressed with this beer. It's much better than the standard Harpoon Ale, but still falls short of any reasonably good IPA. Southern Tier's is around the same price and crushes this."
"Poured a golden brown with a thin white 2 finger head that disapeared pretty quickly. Decent Lacing. Real good fresh smell coming from this brew, very floral, hoppy, citrusy smell. Average I.P.A, Tastes the way it smells. Bitter at first, but leaves a real refreshing bitterness as it goes down. Floral hops and citrus dominate. Real smooth going down with a right amount of carbonation. I see this beer as a great starting I.P.A for the new comer but definitely not the best out there."
"D - Decent and fairly subtle for an IPA, but well made."
"I think this was the first IPA I ever had, when I took some off the ""good keg"" at a party. It seems to be a bit inconsistent, but if I feel like an IPA and this is the only one on tap, I'll be happy to get it. I had this a few weeks ago and didn't review, but I remember it having a fuller body with more earthy characters."
"Pours a copper gold with a thin white head. Good retention and laceing. Aroma is of piney floral hops, and citrus. Body is a bit on the thin side with lots of carbonation. Taste is a nice balance. Piney hops,with hints of malt. Nice smooth finish. Not overly bitter,but still retains the IPA flavor."
"This first and only time I had this before was on tap at the Gingerman NYC when it first came out. I was drinking Brooklyn EIPA all the time and was completley underwhelmed by Harpoons take on the style. Of course one is English and one is American But I did not know this at the time. Anyway i avoided trying bottled as a result. My loss! This is a great beer and I'll be picking a more of this from now on"
"Pours bright gold with a big white head. Smell is subtle and mostly hops, a touch of malt. Taste is fairly subtle as well, mainly hops. Overall a decent enough IPA that was once readily available in my area, not sure what happened but I don't see it as often. Its a very drinkable beer, and on a hot day it does the trick. There are plenty of better IPAs out there but rarely one as sessionable."
"good intro to the style, definitely worth pickin up a 12, reasonably priced too!"
"Never my first choice but a good go-to IPA. I like a little more body and bitterness than this has to offer but the drinkability is awesome and it's never let me down."
"Mouthfeel just tastes like a shiftless amber or brown ale. Doesn't inspire me to ever try any of their hoppy beers. I think they have a limited Imperial or double IPA, but I would have to speculate that based on this beer, it would take a double/imperial to raise it to its appropriate hop and alcohol strength to be a more worthy version of an IPA."
"Nice golden color when poured into my glass, bubbling up into a decent head. Nice aroma from the beer reminds me of grapefruit and hops. Mild hoppiness in the taste only a tinge of grapefruit on the end notes. Smooth finish with a bit too much carbonation for my taste. I could have a few of these, but the fact that it is easily attainable around here and that there are better IPA's to be had make it nothing more than an occasional beer for me."
"it tastes good and the hops are pretty mild and balanced with a mild bitterness. this IPA does not have a powerful hop component, though it certainly has a nice hoppy aroma and IPA flavor."
"This isn't a bad tasting beer, and actually could be a really great beer for newer craft beer drinkers who are used to lighter beers. This beer is very easy drinking, and the hops wouldn't be overbearing after a few pints either, but i don't think i'd really care to have a few pints of it anyway."
"Overall: it's fine if there's nothing else around. It has some sentimental value for me, but I feel like it comes up a little short as an ipa"
"It was not an out of this world experience, but it is a very light and enjoyable beer for everyday or get togethers."
"Bottle to pint glass. Pours a clear golden to light copper. Aroma is relatively mild. There are some resinous notes but nothing that really jumps out. Initial soft head with good retention. Medium-light in body. Bitterness balanced nicely with noticeable malt coming through near the end. This is widely available in my area, and for the price, it is an excellent everyday beer."
"Light amber, one finger white head, medium dissipation, decent lacing. Bready malts dominate the nose, little hop presence. The taste is more of sweet than bready malts, where are the hops? Smooth mouthfeel, fairly drinkable, and very unremarkable. While this may have been an older bottle and the hops lost some of their muscle, the East vs. West Coast perspectives on IPAs is becoming more and more clear to me."
"Pours a tawny golden color with about an inch of white head that fades relatively rapidly. No real lacing to speak of. Smells ok, a bit of earthy hops and some pale malt, but also some corny sweetness reminiscent of a macro. Taste isn't bad at all, some nice citrus hops with a moderate bitter kick, although the flavors just don't seem to meld that well in this one. Medium to light body, helps when having a session of this one. Not bad, but I could pick at least a dozen IPAs that I'd rather have."
"Picked this up at the local grocery store. It's great to have the 'poon readily available here in Fla. The label is all too true, ""Love Beer and Love Life"". This 'poon pours to a golden slightly bronze tinged colour with a nice two finger micro bubble head. Smell is malty with a nice earthy hop. Taste of this brew is very well balanced, consistent throughout. The taste is a great blend of malts and hops with neither dominating. Probably one of the better balanced brews I have had. Doesn't bite as much as I expected for an IPA but that just makes it more drinkable. Mouthfeel is spot on, enough carbonation to lend zestiness to the hop bite but not to much to mask the malt backbone. A great beer. Again extremely glad to see it here on the shelves."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a 2 inch head that clings to the glass in clumps. The appearance is light amber and clear. The aroma is mouthwatering with citrus and floral hops. The taste is similar to the aroma with mild to moderate bitterness and a little malt sweetness. Light, smooth feel with light carbonation a clean finish. I tried one of these and immediatly got more. Very drinkable and highly enjoyable, a really excellent example of the style."
"Pours a very clear amber color with more than a finger of big bubble head. Just slightly off white color to the cap. Not much retension but it laces all over the place. The hops present in the nose is kinda mild for an IPA but recognizable as the fruity/citrus character of cascade. Little bit of malt sweetness coming through in the aroma as well. Taking a sip, it is a nice balance of malt sweetness to hop bitterness. Feel is quite thin and carb is a little low. Overall it isn't bad but I feel cheated. I got to enjoy this in time before the best by date but it doesn't have the freshness character to back that label up."
"Drinkability: This one is a slightly above average IPA which did not jump out to me. I could have two max."
"D- Moderate. I was not impressed with this encounter with Harpoon IPA, not sure who's dropping the ball (the distributor or the bar) but I've had much better samples of this."
"Poured a clear orange with a moderate head that faded to a patchy skin. The aroma was pretty quiet, not much there. The taste was just bitter hops, no citrus to cut it, and a bitter carbonation bite for an after taste. The feel was medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability was good. The great white whale got away again as Harpoon missed the mark with this IPA."
"D: A good IPA that goes well with food but would have trouble standing alone."
"This is a nice beer. I recently picked up a six pack, and I was impressed by how easy this beer drinks for an IPA. It is not the finest IPA I've tried, but Harpoon's offering is a really good beer. Also, I'm not sure if I'd seek it out again, but I would definitely down a few if they were offered to me! Decent hoppiness/bite with fairly balanced malt sweetness. I liked it. Worth checking out!"
"Very light color with a nice head. Nice aged citrus smell a bit of rotten grapefruit is what I notice. Solid flavor but nothing unusual to speak of more hoppy than sweet. Aftertaste ain't awful but lingers a bit longer than I would want. Fairly drinkable, but more bitter than I would want. Maybe 2 before I would switch beers."
"The pour was decent with a nice amber color and a moderate head of white on the top. Even color and a nice carbonation throughout the session. The aroma was nicely balanced. Light pine hops, hints of bready malts and a light touch of caramel on the nose. Well balanced but nothing really jumping out at me. Smooth, even flavor here with the first sip identical to the last. Light caramel flavors that have overlapped with nice touches of hops. Light to medium body and an easy sessionability made this one easy beer to put down."
"D: Eh. Not bad. But I don't really want to drink ""not bad."" I am spoiled, I guess."
"Overall a different take on hops for an IPA. Its lacks any real fruity hops, sweet balanced malt or additional dimensions to make it stick out from the pack. The color is great and taste is good and bitter. But I've experienced all I need to with this one 12 ounce bottle."
"Not for me, but probably a good measure for IPA's"
"What struck me the most about this beer was its balance. I was expecting a stronger hop taste to it and less maltiness. Definitely a good beer though. Pours a deep golden/copper color with a medium head. Highly Drinkable and a solid brew. The only problem is the price."
"Typical IPA - decent aroma of hops - smells ectremely inviting. Flavor has a bit of a funky earthiness to it (as many Harpoon beers do in my opionion), but otherwise very balanced falvor profile. Hops are eveident, but not agressive. Mouthfeel and drinkability are OK. Definitely nto one of my top IPAs."
"The mouthfeel is light, with a crisp finish and a moderate amount of carbonation. This isn't a bad beer, definitely refreshing, but there's much better out there. Nothing to specifically search for, imo."
"The last time I had this beer was over 8 years ago and I remember it tasting better. Not sure if that is because my palate has changed or because it was a better recipe. I probably would pass on this the next time"
"D: Def could drink a number of them before i got weary of the bitterness or alcohol content."
"D-I could drink these all night, as I have many times."
"Cheers!"
"D - good as in, well wouln't search for it but if someone gave it to me I would drink it"
"Overall, this is just a middle of the road ipa that I might purchase if there were no better options."
"Notes: It´s nice IPA but lacks on this form anything to make it remarkable. And yet it is a good drink as a US DIPA but could do with a touch of additional hops either in flavor or aroma... If they get distracted this could feel like a pale ale. Not a bad choice for a tap in any case."
"Not bad for an ipa, light red, has a sudsy head. It has a sudsy feel. Tastes is bitter very little sweetness but it has a clean finish I enjoyed it. It was a little thin but it was bubly enough that it was pleasant. It was drinkable, and I wouldn't mind having another"
"An old favorite that isn't as exciting as some of the new beers I've discovered, but still a nice port in the storm. The draft version is always a welcome site at a bar with only BMC choices."
"A very drinkable choice on a hot day. I first tried this beer at a fish joint in Boston this August, when every day was in the 90's with rediculous humidity. It went down real easy; bought it again when I got home and enjoyed it just as much."
"Drinkability: A more mild and maltier IPA. Very easy to drink. Avery good session IPA."
"Overall this is a solid, refreshing, IPA that is not overly hopped. Compared to some of the IPAs out there now, this could almost be called an APA, but I liked it all the same. I could easily drink a few of these."
"Love it. Can't beat a case of harpoon when you're trying to have a good time. I enjoy a good IPA and harpoon is very easy way to get my fix. It is carried at most bars in my area as well as pretty much any liquor store. The crisp hoppiness defines this beer for me. It's definitely worth a taste."
"Overall, this is a great IPA from a Boston brewery. It is definitely worth a shot."
"A good IPA from Harpoon. Lacking sufficient body and flavor but a good beer to have a few. Pours golden into a glass with a quickly decaying head. Smells like piney hops. Tastes a little flavorless with carbonation somewhat dominant. I like the beer but wouldn't rave about it."
"I sampled this beer in the North Train Station in Boston. Tried on draft but in a plastic cup the beer had a pale amber colour with some cloudiness that cleared quickly. The flavour seemed like that of a bit of a started IPA. The hop characters were lacking as well as the fullness of flavour. The redeeming qualities of this beer are the nuttiness, yeast, and malt flavours that shine through in the profile. This beer would be a decent intro IPA for the inexperienced beer drinker. Unlike a full bodied IPA I could enjoy this as a session beer."
"Personally: A steady-eddy IPA, you can't go wrong with a Harpoon IPA."
"D - decent, session-type beer. nothing exciting. i had expected more."
"Pours a clear golden amber into my glass with a lackluster head, rising carb bubbles and the head has low retention. A small head blanket is left on the beer and little to no lacing is left on my glass as it drains. Smells is lacking here, cannot pick up much besides a bit of hops and some citrus, weak smell is hard to smell here. Taste is much better than the smell, good hoppy balance, woody and citrus, some more fruit and a bit of alcohol that throws me off, not well hidden at all. Mouthfeel is pretty creamy and good, nice carbonation with the alcohol taking away from the smoothness. Drinkability is good here, good session beer, alcohol takes this down from a 5 here, I have a feeling the only thing you will taste after 2 of these is piney alcohol."
"Pretty good American IPA. Nice golden-grown color with a decent head. Crisp hop taste, but not overly hopped or bitter. It has a nice refreshing mouthfeel, and is a very drinkable beer. It is certainly not the best IPA on the market, but for the price and its wide availability in New England it is a solid bet."
"M&D - easy drinking medium body with medium carbonation. Its pretty drinkable but just an okay IPA, just nothing fantastic."
"D: Very smooth and drinkable IPA. Doesn't push the boundries like some other brews, but nicely balanced and well crafted. Alot of bars in this area have Harpoon IPA on tap, so it's become my go-to beer when all the other offering are the BMC variety."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability were also good. Overall, this is a solid beer, but it is well down the list of IPA's that I would choose first."
"The mouth is crisp and clean. I notice a vast amount of bubbles rising through this beer. Not spritzy though. Just right. This is a very simple, well-made IPA. I would compare this with Goose Island's IPA. Very simple and it hits the spot every time. Nice citrus backbone that finishes slightly sweet. Mellow bitterness that is not harsh in any way. I could drink these all night. Recommend."
"Surely this beer could use a stronger malt backbone. It's refreshing, and easy to drink, and no doubt the hops are pleasant, but something is lacking, making this a near miss for me."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"Definetely not a hop-bomb like many modern IPA's, but if consider it more as an APA, you will not be dissapointed."
"D-I could drink and session these all night. Please go and get some, you won't be dissapointed."
"D - Definately could have had more but pretty boring for an IPA to be honest"
"At first glance and smell, Harpoon IPA had me thinking Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Must be a fair amount of Cascade hops, which I thought a good sign. Tasting, however, found a generic, watered down pale ale with a little wet cardboard flavor. Mouthfeel was similarly watered down; not clean and crisp like I'm looking for. On the whole, just not a satisfying IPA."
"Mild viscosity for an IPA, the drinkibility is superb. This is an excellent Friday afternoon beer for transition between work and weekend."
"Drinkability: Yea this is drinkable. This is more of a pale ale of then an IPA. I've heard it used to be more on IPA but this has obviously been dumbed down for the masses. It barely meets the IPA requirements. If you're looking for a refreshing beer this obviously will wet your whistle if you're looking for a in your face hopslam, you'll be very disappointed. This would be an alright beer if they didn't through the IPA tag on it."
"D- all things considered, this is an IPA that drinks like a standard american pale ale. crisp, slick, refreshing, mildly flavored, tasty, and not over the top in any way. style guidelines maybe questionable, but when i select an IPA, i prefer something more aggressive and noteworthy."
"This is a fresh brew that sticks to a standard. It's simple."
"One of the first ipas i got into this one is a beer to be tried a lot. It's got a great crispness and bitterness but easily drinkable, at 5.9% alcohol by volume, with a good mouthfeel, flavor and aroma. This is great in the bottle or on tap and should not be overlooked for something maybe less interesting that's traveled a lot further."
"Ect. - Freshness date: 8/15/09. This beer had amazing head retention covering the top till the beer was over half gone. I can't consider this fully an I.P.A. to me it just seems to mild tasting and I think of it as a malty pale."
"D. A good IPA, decent hops, decent malty sweetness, and bitter hop bite."
"D- this one seemed pretty weak compared to several other versions of this style. i was very happy to see brewery sitting on shelves in chicago, but after this im not very impressed. oh well, i hope the next one from harpoon is better."
"d- i feel i could only session one of these due to all the hops and what not. good, but in a style I'm still feeling out somewhat."
"Mouthfeel is fairly thin with a medium level of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent introductory IPA that won't overwhelm anyone and is a great value, but after becoming more accustomed to hops, this is just too light to stand up to many of the better IPAs out there. Still, a refreshing option that I found mostly satisfying."
"An all around great IPA most of the time I can get this in most bars that serve only macros and it well worth it"
"An solid IPA, but a bit light compared to many others. Definitely drinkable, great for a solid beer if you don't want a hop or malt powerhouse."
"D: If this was a pale ale, I'd say it is a nice subtle one. It's lacking flavor and kick as an IPA. At times, I say it is even a touch watery. I know this brew has a strong heritage and I feel bad about not taking that into account. It just isn't what people want from an IPA these days IMHO."
"d - its OK - nice, all-around solid and non-offensive ale"
"It all mixed together very nicely. Nothing groundbreaking, but an enjoyable IPA that I didn't have to fight the bitter hops on. A nice option amongst other predictable tap brews."
"This is a great example of an introductory beer."
"Drinkability: Not heavy, not especially my type of IPA, but good for someone looking to try one out to see if it's their style. Not overwhelming, like my first IPA was."
"D = Since it's light, drinkability is good."
"Memorable and On the reorder list when I am on the East Coast"
"Bought this one from the local packy. Pours a medium amber in color with a good two finger head and lots of lace. Floral and hop aromas in the nose. Biscuity malt with a slight caramel sweetness with lots of hops to balance. mouthfeel and carbonation are good. Drinkability? had no problem drinking several for this review."
"D - Great session IPA."
"Drink is very good I usually wouldn't want an IPA for a session beer but this one I definetly would have a few more for the evening."
"Drinkability: Good transition IPA but wouldn't be my first choice."
"D- good, but not perfect. Sits somewhere in the middle for IPA's in my books."
"The drinkability is good, it goes down easily and is far from a bad beer, just nothing spectacular."
"Poured a medium gold color with a small white head and decent carbonation. Nose is floral, lightly hopped. Taste is grainy, light bodied with floral hints and not much malt. Mouthfeel is light, astringent at times and floral. Do not recommend at all."
"D: It's not too aggressive, but it's not great. It has a mild complexity. Worth it as part of a variety pack, perhaps not more."
"Had this one last night before bed. Poured a clear bronze color with soap bubble white head and decent lacing. Smelled of citrusy hops followed by grass and malt. Tasted like very mild earthy hops and malt. It was slightly overcarbonated as well, reminding me of something like a hoppy club soda. I could kick back a few of these, but only if nothing else is available."
"Drinkability is huge. It feels good in the mouth and feels good going down, begs to be swallowed. Hard to stop, pick it apart, and analyze it. Great beer, something I can drink regularly and not grow tired of. Dependable and solid all around, a staple for summertime."
"Has to be a the verge of being a pale ale...IBUs have to be low. I will chalk it up as an English style IPA, but still a ""light"" one. Pours a deep gold with thin white head. Light, almost clean aroma with a very predictable palate. The hops are there, but not near extent I expect from an IPA. Very drinkable, a beginner IPA for sure."
"D - Very refreshing and not too hoppy a good IPA for hop rookies."
"Drinkability: Milder on the IPA taste..which might work for people who don't take well to the style. I expect a more hop profile though. Its worth trying, however."
"On tap at River street Alehouse. Served in a standard shaker ""pint"" glass. The ale appears a hazed golden copper color with about a finger of off white foam. Aroma and flavor are of mild citrus such as lemon and orange, a tad bitter and also sweet from a good amount of caramelized malt, some grassy hops. Medium in both body and carbonation. Not bad, I'd order another if I didn't have 20 taps to choose from here at the Alehouse."
"D= A solid IPA here, unfortunately I think my bottle had some age on it so the hops had mellowed quite a bit. Still, damn drinkable and I enjoyed it!"
"D: Drinkable, so far Harpoon's offerings that recently came to North Texas have left me somewhat underwhelmed."
"D-Very drinkable. One you can recommend to neophyte BAs and not have to worry that the hops will drive them back to the macros. I would buy this again for sure."
"Harpoon IPA is a very solid IPA that's definitely worth checking out. It comes across as a little primitive in some respects. The hops seem tame in comparison to many IPAs out there, but they have a nice citric and bitter flavor that is a nice change of pace. I like it. I'd like it more if it had more hop flavor, but it's more than solid as it is. It's actually underrated if you ask me."
"Harpoon IPA pours pale golden with a quickly dissipating head. The smell is flowery with earthly tones. The taste is grassy, flowery, and earthy with a dry finish. Not a lot of hops to be found in here. Drinks like an APA to me. This could be a fine session or lawnmower beer for me. Not a stand-out in the IPA category though."
"Verdict: Certainly not the most hopped IPA out there, I really would have pegged this one as an Pale Ale if I had to guess. I guess over the years the craft beer world has just moved on from this definition of an IPA. But, putting style aside, this is still a tasty and highly sessionable beer--just don't go in expecting an excess of hops."
"If I had beer snob friends, this would probably cause a riff in our friendship, for this is my favorite IPA. This is not even my boston bias speaking. If I want to enjoy a nice beer with hop presence with out feeling like I'm being medicated, this is my go to. The key is they don't over do it. This may not be enough for hardcore hop heads out there, but man, on hot afternoon, nothing does it like a nice cold one of these."
"D - Very"
"Overall, it's well-made but kind of boring. I wouldn't reach for another, but I wouldn't turn down a free one."
"Final Thoughts: Not overly hopped as promised but still a solid effort within an overrepresented style by the folks at Harpoon."
"D- One of my favorite IPAs so far. Really enjoy drinking this brew at any time."
"There is some hop bitterness but it is pleasant and balanced with floral to mild hops. I could drink this all night (or day). A session IPA. This is a high quality IPA, probably the best from a mass production brewery."
"I had multiple beers on multiple nights, hence the drinkability. It was one that was easy to drink. Carbonation was perfect, went down easily. Was a little light in body but not greatly so. Would definitely have again although I am not sure I would buy it if something new was available."
"Note: A good all round ipa at its standard."
"D - carbonation a little high for my tastes but the bitterness is smooth and well balanced with the sweetness from the malt. A decent IPA."
"Reddish orange in colow with a one finger off-white head. Smells of citrusy hops with some mustiness involved and a good amount of sweet malts. Tastes of oily hops, spice, grapefruit and even banana. Has a good malty backbone. Medium bodied with lots of carbonation."
"Overall very solid and a good choice. Again while nothing spectacular it was a more then decent beer to drink."
"I think I love this beer. A great balance between hop flavor, malt, bitterness and accented by great appearance and carbonation. The only thing I dislike is a slightly flat aftertaste that leans towards a powdery dryness. I don't know how I've passed this one up for so long but I am glad I took the plunge tonight. Worth checking out."
"Overall, this IPA is a good choice for a weekday to go along with a nice submarine sandwich. Oddly enough the second one I had tasted better than the first...and maybe the third will be even better!!"
"Perhaps not fitting of the American IPA category - drastically different from DFH 60, anything SN, etc. Worth a shot as a solid beer in general."
"D- Fuller mouthfeel leads to less drinkability but this beer is light enough to have a few. A sixer of this however, would leave me awfully stuffed."
"This beer was poured into a pint glass and was a nice golden brown color with an excellent off white plentiful head that persisted for a long time. Very nice lacing to the last drop. Ample carbonation. The nose was average with a noticeable hop aroma, but not overpowering. Slight hint of piney citrusy notes were noticed. The beer taste was smooth and contained a medium amount of hop flavors. I am guessing approximately 40 IBUs (total guess). Light mouthfeel, and very quaffable. Good drinkability, and could be a session beer for some, but not me."
"Overall this is a return to the basics but quite a pleasant one. Highly recommended."
"I feel that this would be a great gateway beer, as it's not very aggressive, but is still well-crafted. The Harpoon 12-pack is also a great value where I'm buying in Maine."
"Slainte!"
"This is the beer that got me into beer. I remember duffextracold saying, ""try this, it tastes like flowers."" Still one of the best every occassion IPA's in my opinion though it's much better in a bottle vs. tap and hoppiness can vary greatly between bottles/kegs depending on freshness. I'd probably rate it lower if it wasn't such a nostalgic beer for me."
"The Cascade bitterness and aroma are the nicest thing about this beer. The malt is a bit lacking, and this shows in the taste as it does not back up the hops quite enough. A gateway IPA for the New Englanders...."
"The colour is most definitely on the pale end of the spectrum for this type of beer - much lighter than I'm used to. Very fruity, almost bubblegummy nose to it - not malty, barely hoppy. Both the taste and the body are very thin. Almost no finish at all. Very little character, and not a beer I shall buy again."
"I don't recommend."
"pass on this one"
"This is a a very good brew. It's smell has a hint of floral to it but once you take your first sip it hits you. To me it seems a little over whelming with the floral taste. It is very smooth with a heavy hops taste. The aftertaste lingers with an earthy mood. It goes down very well though. I would recommend this beer to anyone. Very good but would lessen the floral taste."
"I found the nose to be light and peachy. The taste initially was less hoppy than I expected with mild bitterness and a malty finish. I'm not quite sure what it might be about this blend of hops and malt but I found the finish to be rather abrupt - I call it ""clunky"": it's a sudden dropping off of flavour and the substitution of a malty earthiness of sorts in the finish that lingers. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it's just a characteristic that I find in some brews from time to time. The body in this case is thin, not unlike a pale ale, although with more substance. With warming, there are more floral notes and a more bitter edge to balance the malt presence. Distinctive taste, interesting profile, not bad at all although restrained when compared to some IPA's these days."
"12 ounce bottle courtesy of swnicholson as an extra in a trade, thanks for the opportunity Scott, best before date of June this year, consumed Friday, reviewed from notes, poured into my Humboldt pint glass, color is a cloudy golden orange, 1/2 inch soapy white head, aroma consists of floral hops, and what smells like Cascde, grapefruit, peaches, grassy accents, bread, and strong yeast, starts off slightly dry, chewy in the middle with toast and caramel malt, finish is slightly sweet and barely has any hops, minimal bitterness in the aftertaste, warming up did not help that either, malty, chewy, and slightly dry mouthfeel, medium bodied, too much carbonation, almost watered down because of it, taste does not linger, could drink a lot of this but probably would not just because there is not much flavor for an IPA and it is too malt reliant for me, although it does stay smooth, refreshing, and light, this IPA did not really do it for me, definitely can tell it is not heavily hopped like I am used to here on the west coast but even taking that into account, it was nothing special, probably would skip next time, might be worth trying"
"O: Great session beer that is a very nice interpretation of the IPA style. Not overwhelming with the hops but very tasty."
"Notes: The east coast really has some great contenders, Harpoon being one of them. While this hasn't been my favorite of their offerings, it's a solid beer."
"Final Thoughts - In my area this beer is one of the cheapest for a 12 at roughly $14. This provides drinkers with hop flavor and a nice floral aroma. A great introductory beer for people getting into IPAs. Definitely give it a try."
"D - This beer has some good session qualities, overall a little muted for an IPA, but something that you could kick back with a enjoy a couple"
"Pours a nice light amber color. Good head, light but sturdy- not too thin, not too thick, good white color. Absolutely love the smell-hoppy, flowery with subtle citrus undertones. Mouthfeel is wonderful-light and warm- Perfectly balanced between the light spice of the hops and the citrus, very smooth. You know you're drinking an IPA, but its not overpowering, very enjoyable. Taste is great, nice hoppy flavor, complimented with citrus undertone and a mild bitterness in the finish. Drinkablity is good, but the hops seems to get more pronounced and bitter the more you drink. Still, a good session beer, no doubt. A great backyard BBQ drink that will complement a spicy BBQ sauce. A classic brew."
"Nicely drinkable and a good East Coast American interpretation of the style. Nothing overtly spectacular, but a solid offering nevertheless."
"Harpoon IPA has a bright color, with little head. The aroma is light, citrusy, with a light touch of biscuit malt. Flavor has a good lightly hoppy edge with some moderate malt... not too exciting these days, but quite drinkable. Medium body, with a crisp texture. A decent session beer."
"a very drinkable beer, nearly exceptional, depends on the mood, the company...this would be a great brew to accompany light, spicey and/or seafood tapas/horsdoeuvres...fine on it's own. i will revisit this and compare notes. all around, it is quite recommended."
"D-Decent body. Wouldn't drink more than two of these probably. Overall a nice IPA, but in a country full of them I'd gravitate elsewhere."
"One of the better East Coast IPAs!!! Definitely very session able and easy to drink for hours. After drinking many IPAs, one of my favorites. Definantley very east coast in flavor and aroma, hoppy but does not have that citric flavor associated with PNW IPAs. A must try for any East Coast IPA fan and a important stop on the beer trail for anybody in New England!!!!"
"O: Overall, I might order another pint at the bar, but only if it was one of the few craftbrews on tap. However, as an IPA, I was plesantly happy - I didn't walk away with a crippled pallet from the bitterness that I have with other IPAs and IIPAs."
"I don't mean to hate on this beer, but think of it as a baby step for those looking to explore pale ales (which I think is what this actually is, not IPA)."
"D: As I try more of this style I like this IPA more and more. I think this makes a very good entry level IPA."
"Don't think I will ever trade for this or even drink it if I am anywhere near where it is sold. This is not an IPA. I got it super fresh too."
"Future outlook: A very pleasant, though mostly unspectacular IPA. Probably wouldn't ever be a first choice for an IPA given the heft of high quality options- but given the right price, would be fine for a warm day of heavy consumption."
"Nice creamy mouthfeel. A little bit watery, but good overall. Perfect carbonation. Drinkability is very high. Hop bitterness isn't going to destroy your palate, so you can enjoy a number of these in a night."
"Drinkability: One that I'd been putting off trying just because it's pretty easily available, and I could see how this could be a pleasant, drinkable go-to beer for many. Though it's reasonably mild, it's entirely inoffensive, low in alcohol, and fairly drinkable."
"D: Almost to a level of predictability when I get this as the best tap option, the spicy food I like usually dominates and overpowers this beer. Hell, the soy chips and cinnamon sugar pretzels I am chowing on now are not a palate cleanser, they are defeating the heart of this beer."
"D- Very peasant and drinkable. Definitely has the east coast IPA flavor. This would be an excellent IPA if the flavor and body were ramped up a bit, it's just kind of bland."
"Nothing special, but a decent IPA. Just kind of uninspiring. Nothing to go out of your way for IMO."
"Pretty low on my IPA list. If this was marketed as an APA I would have rated it higher, because to me thats what this is. Not enough strong, bitter, fresh hops to be an IPA."
"Poured into a pint glass, where it forms a clear light orange. It has an underwhelming head with a small amount of lacing. This IPA smells like a classic IPA: lots of hops with a dry smell to it, but it has nothing to make it stand out from the pack. The taste isn't great either: all hops, and no malts or spices. Actually, it tastes like someone added sugar directly to this beer after fermentation. This beer is carbonated nicely, but it has a thin body. There is nothing I can pick out that is bad in this beer, just nothing special. It's decently drinkable because of this, but I think this goes near the bottom of my IPA list."
"I would consider this beer to be a nice introductory IPA. There are distinguishable characteristics, notably the hoppy bitterness, but no real complexity. It is definitely an easy drinking IPA and quite refreshing."
"Pours pure gold with a .5"" head. Really nice clarity and color here. Nose is faint unripened banana. Up front the taste is subdued, light, and sweet. Mid-taste the IPA starts to come out with a bit of bittersweet maltiness. Then it finishes with those hops but manages to not come off as dry as some other IPA's with this hoppy finish. I've heard good things about this one and while I'm not dissapointed - IT's a little too 'safe' for me. I guess it's fairly distinguishable for it's quality and it's smoothness and drinkability but there weren't any risks taken with this one. I will revisit but I'm not blown away."
"Great in a bottle as it is on tap. Great IPA."
"M/D - Light to medium boided and very highly carbonated. Easy drinking."
"A deep golden straw color with a thick off white head that makes nice lace on the glass. Aroma of floral hops,and a hint of bread and maybe a note of sweet peaches . Flavor is piny faintly citrus over a light toasted and biscuity malt taste. The palate is medium bodied with good carbonation and a hopy bitterness that lingers on the tongue. A very sessionable and enjoyable beer that was fun to try."
"Pours a clear light amber colored body, with a mall frothy white head, lastingish. Very bitter piney aroma, some malts but mostly hops. Piney taste, but not very hoppy or bitter. Almost an off taste, like chemicals or something. Almost a hoppy aftertaste. Pretty decent beer."
"D - I used to drink a lot of this, but my tastes have since evolved and this doesn't really do it for me anymore."
"A very quenchable IPA, not much of a hop presence, but i like the pilsner malt in the beer, a good ""light"" IPA that i could drink many of. Not a big Harpoon fan, but this is pretty good."
"Somewhat of a ""session"" IPA, it's easy to drink and the ABV isn't anything out of this world. Solid brew."
"The feel of this brew is not heavy but a nice rounded mouthfeel. Not too strong ABV and would makea a good seesion beer."
"Drinkability: Besides the metallic taste, I love this IPA, it's refreshing, features just the right amount of hoppy elements, and is smooth in it's own sense. I recommend this to any hop head looking for an enjoyable IPA."
"D- Perfect session beer for watching football games. Nice IPA, not over the top, it is what it is."
"A very nice golden color with a small white head. A faint alcohol aroma, not very good. The taste was much better, being a little hoppy. Very smooth in the mouth. This isn't my favorite style of beer but I would buy this brand again. So far from the Harpoon sampler this is one of the better choices."
"Appearance is deep golden with a one finger white head that does not dissipate too quickly. Smell is minimal--faint citrusy hops. The taste is mainly grapefruity hops at first with a little yeast, and then there's a kind of medicinal aftertaste. Mouthfeel is acidic at first, but then oddly smooth. Not as heavy as other IPAs/APAs. This is a drinkable IPA, but it doesn't have quite the same bold smell/flavor as a lot of other IPAs."
"taste is quite light, bitter not to the extreme, not very balanced at all. Of course bringing more into the hoppy side with a shy bitterness, but not to the extreme. Not pleasant neither displeasing."
"Nikki"
"D: I'm not a big IPA guy but this one went down well... Nothing really stands out on this one...."
"Overall, this beer surprised me. It was one of the last beers in the Winter Sampler 12 pack that I bought, and most of the other beers failed to impress me. I am not much of a ""hop head"" so the lighter tendency of this beer really appeals to me. If I am in the mood for an APA/IPA, I might seriously consider this one for a 6 pack."
"Had this on tap at Bertucci's restaurant. Served into a frosted pint glass a golden orange color with a finger-width head that left clingy rings of lacing throughout the drink. Aroma was of citrusy hops, orange, a little bit of toffee and lots of sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied with good carbonation. Taste was a good balance of hops and malt, lots of citrus taste similar to the nose, went quite well with my chicken dish. Drinkability was good and it went with the meal well. I normally add .5 to taste as a handicap for a beer served in a chilled glass, but I did not feel as if this beer suffered for it. Overall this is a good beer - I am not familiar enough with the style to know if it fits well so I will judge mainly on my preference."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. It pours a golden yellow with a lot of carbonation and and fizzy, white head. There is decent lacing. The hoppy aroma is clearly there but not as powerful as most IPA's I have had. The mouthfeel is moderate to bold The flavor has the hoppy bitterness of most IPA's but like the aroma, it is not as powerful as better IPA's."
"O: Rather unimpressed with this beer. There just isn't that much going on. Was expecting more hops. Not quite a session beer I guess at 5.9% ABV, but could definitely enjoy quite a few of these watching a game or at a BBQ."
"6/4/6/4/14 (3.4/5)"
"I'm so sorry, but I don't see what everyone else does in this beer. To me, this beer is absurdly over-hopped, so much so that at all temperatures it smells like rotting vegetation and tastes like a pale ale with with alpha acids added from an eyedropper. The malt flavor is too aggressive and tastes over-toasted. I love IPAs with malt flavor, but only if it works to balance the hop flavor. In this case, both flavors are too aggressive. Come on, Harpoon. Your Dark Munich Ale is so good! Everything else you make is so good! Maybe (with more care) this beer as a double IPA would work well? Although this doesn't bear that much resemblance to their Leviathan. Still, in all departments I find it profoundly below average, except maybe appearance and mouthfeel, which are standard (gold with a tinge of brown and not too oily, respectively). This is just one of those beers I can't get into."
"D- a nice session beer and very easy to put back. This is a good tailgating beer."
"D: An excellent session or beach beer if you not looking for much punch or flavor. Easily drinkable but then quickly forgettable. After having a Harpoon Brown prior and throughly enjoying, I was confused with what Harpoon was doing for this beer. As other reviewers have stated, the tap vs. bottle difference is quite wide and I shall look for the latter rather than the former in the future."
"(rated Aug 17, 2008)"
"Decent IPA, refreshing but watery. Pours a solid gold color with a small white head. Minimal lacing. Weak floral aroma which is more grass than pine/citrus. Nice hop profile, mostly an English variety IPA from what I could taste. Overall, it tastes like an IPA-lite"
"As mentioned the slight bitterness and the overall balance makes this a nice session IPA."
"Taste: muted citric hop, toasted biscuity malt, a bit of warming alcohol, more than indicated by the abv. Mouthfeel: medium bodied, smooth with a slightly drying finish. A bit muted in the hop department for an ipa. Worth picking up though."
"Had one in the winter sample pack. Nice appearance with a clear copper look and some good lacing. Aromas were radically weak with little spice wrapped around the hops. Taste was very bland with just a simple bitter taste and lagging metallic aftertaste. Mouthfeel was an aid by giving it a dry carbonation but the flavors are not helped at all. Overall, a low quality IPA at least for me."
"A very nice option when you find yourself in a bar serving BMC, Sam, and Harpoon."
"Not as big as other IPAs as far as the taste goes but smooth and satisfying for any American IPA fan."
"Pours a clear, light amber color with a thick off-white foamy head. The aroma is very bland, containing only a slight bitter hop presence. This beer was very watered down with not enough of a strong bitter hop taste. Another dissapointing offering from an, in my opinion, overrrated brewery."
"This one goes down very easily, could have drank a couple more."
"Pours a true golden color, average for any pale ale / ipa. The floral aroma hits you early and brings high expectations for the taste. Upon drinking the beer however, the floral aroma dissipates, and leaves very little of an aftertaste. Definetly not the hop bitterness I expected from the smell. Goes down smooth, and would make a good session beer, but for one looking for a true IPA, the hop characteristics are just too weak for me. I could see where this would be very good however for someone not used to drinking IPA's."
"D - Very easy to drink. Not too big a beer, but one worth tipping back all nite. Another beer I'd have more often if I could get this in CO. Seems this would be a good gateway IPA for the beer newb."
"Drinkability: I'll admit it- other IPAs I have had I could only maybe have two in a sitting and with food at that. This one, however, I could have many and many of. This isn't as hoppy as most IPAs, but still has its place. Not necessarily for hopheads, but is good as a gateway IPA at the least."
"Definitely better of the tap compared to the bottle. I noticed major diferences."
"This is a very solid and drinkable IPA. A great regular for those in the Boston area. The hops give a good balance of bitterness and flavor."
"I love this brew. I drink it all the time. It is always in my fridge. If you want to see what HArpoon is about, check this one out. It is in everybar in Boston. Look for the Yellow harpoon tap and drink away."
"HV"
"Nice body, a nice slick feel with good carbonation. Very nice and superbly drinkable."
"Second time around the pints were clear with a good 1/2"" of white head. A fair to middling refreshing pint of IPA - but still lacking any body to back up the hops."
"Nice change of pace from a style which more often than not goes over the top. This IPA has a well received hop presence but it's considerably mild than many of it's peers. Floral aroma with some citrus notes. Orange/copper pour very light with lots of lacing and a medium head. Quenching and drinkable there's a light airy feel to this one. Flavor is well balanced, good hearty malt presence. There are more citrus fruits in this one minus the grapefruit. Floral hops not much pine. Again a nice version of a great style."
"MF&D - Medium bodied with good carbonation. Went down well, just nothing too distinctive or noteworthy about this ale."
"I would not recommend this beer. I had this on-tap at the Indigo restaurant in Alexandria, formerly known as Potowmack Landing."
"Best IPA ever! This beer has a beautiful deep coppery golden color. The aroma has a hoppy floral bouquet. Outstanding! The taste is wonderful. It tastes like toasty, hoppy, flowery, citrusy goodness. It has perfect balance of malt and hops. It has a terrific medium body which makes the drinkability easy and can been very habit-formering. I love Harpoon IPA."
"i would highly recommend you visit the brewery in boston, they feed you beer after beer after beer leaving no tap untouched, and that is just good business"
"D: A nice, drinkable beer. A decent combination fo mouthfeel and taste. I was hoping for a bit more of a malt background for balance and complexity to really complete this one and make it more of a world class IPA as opposed to just a really good one."
"Alcohol was not really noticeable. Definitely could drink more than one. This was a solid IPA although its taste was more on the English IPA side of things. Not the most exciting thing but I would not complain if this was served to me again."
"If you're looking for a bitter hop kick you can certainly get it here, and it's often what I'll turn to at your average bar in the Boston area. It's certainly sessionable if your mind set is hops. That said, I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase this."
"i would recommend this but there are better IPA's out there (Flying Dog Snake Dog IPA for one)"
"I found this to be an excellent IPA from a brewery that doesn't seem to be talked about very much. It is well balanced for the style and very drinkable. It's definitely very hoppy and bitter (in a good way) and makes for a good beer drinking experience. I recommend this one for a cheap,delicious IPA."
"D: A nice overall offering. Definitely more drinkable than a lot of IPAs these days, but certainly still true to the style."
"D- Not a bad IPA, not a full-flavored as some of the other examples of the style, but easy drinking nonetheless."
"D - Like this better than the Ale, and that was very drinkable."
"When this beer first appeared on the market it must have been a great IPA. Now it sits just north of average."
"Taste is a bit thin and offers a dry lightly bitter finish, rather unexciting to say the least. Had a number of these on Boston's North Shore a few weeks back for lack of other options. Wouldn't even consider buying this again if other options were available. Should I stumble upon a bottle(vs. tap) I'll revisit."
"D - Very easy to drink. This was always my backup when living in MA. It's pretty commonly available and better than the BMC alternatives. But given the choice, I'll take a craft brewed IPA any day."
"D: It was a decent IPA but did not stand out from the crowd. Its light enough and has a low enough ABV to be a session beer for folk that like IPAs. There are many better but this was serviceable."
"All in all, this is my first time drinking harpoon. I consider this brew to be a good example of an IPA and would drink this beer again without question."
"D: On the whole, this is a good example of an IPA. Although I wouldn't rate it as high as some others of the style, it's still drinkable."
"D: Good for an IPA, which I am usually not able to handle mass quantities"
"Easy to drink, but not a beer I will try again. The bottle is dated best by 10/24/08, so it should still be good. Not sure what the problem is."
"This is one of my ""comfort"" beers. I buy it often and it's very consistent. This time I ordered it on tap. It came to me with about a 1"" thick head and the beer was a golden color. Long trails of carbonation stretched from the bottom of the glass to the top. Smells hoppy with some citrus mixed it, but the aroma was rather mild for an IPA. This particular beer came to me colder than I like, so I let is sit for a minute before continuing. The ice cold temp hid much of the flavor. Once it warmed up a bit, the mouthfeel was crisp and fizzy with a medium body. The hops come through in the taste, and it had floral and citrus hints. The taste is very well balanced and quite refreshing. Slightly bitter aftertaste. A very drinkable beer and I am reminded why I enjoy it so much. It went real nice with the spicy food I ate."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a nice gold with a decent white-ish head. A very nice citrus, floral, hoppy aroma. Flavor was hop bitter, mainly citrus, with a touch of malty sweetness. A dry/bitter finish, light-to-medium body. One of my favorite beers that is available in WV."
"The beer pours a medium yellow, slight head with minimal lacing. There isn't much of an aroma to the beer. I generally expect IPA's to have distinct hops scent...but with Harpoon it is more muted. There is a slight metallic taste at first sip, but after a few sips it is unnoticeable. Harpoon's IPA is a great beer, it isn't an overpowering knock your socks off type IPA but it has definite drinkability and can be emjoyed really any time."
"overall, tolerable but forgettable."
"Golden body with a small white head that lasts a good long while. Light floral hop aroma. The flavour is lighter than most IPAs with the hops coming through with a grassiness and floral aspect. Some light sweet malt also. Everything seems dialed back perhaps to appeal to a wider audience. Medium-light body and carbonation. Easy drinking, in part due to its mildness. Seems more of an entry-level beer, and would make a good introduction to the scene."
"Poured a golden color topped with a pretty thick white head. Nice sweet hoppy flavor with a soft bitter hoppy bite. Not overly bitter or fruity, just mild in both areas. Easy drinking. Lots of lace left on the glass as well. Nice and refreshing. I'd certainly get this one again but it could use a little more of a hop kick."
"D - Makes for a good sesion brew, easier on the palate than most IPA's today."
"D-Very drinkable beer. It's not exaclty what I expected from an IPA but it definetely has decent flavor. This would be a solid session beer."
"This is their flagship beer so I had to give it a whirl. Came to me in a pint glass with a good head that sadly displayed rather little retention and/or lacing. Tantalizing honey color with very little visible carbonation rising. Nice citrus hops aroma with some soil like undertones of malt. The flavors were robust and straightforward, hoppy but not a hop bomb as is en vogue presently (despite the shortage!?). Medium body and light carbonation (could have pumped this up a bit). Easy to drink for an IPA yet varietly correct as the wine snobs say. *Special note about this beer* Those in the know say it has changed a lot over the years, becoming less and less edgy for mass consumption. Equally, it is said to be better in the bottle than on tap. A rare find in a beer. Pick up a sixer and try it out."
"Another offering from a recent mixed sixer. This IPA from Harpoon poured a rather clear yellow liquid. The sudsy cap held on for a while. The smell was a floral hop note for sure, with just the slightest element of the malt back noted. Taste? Man something about Harpoon brews, their water perhaps, but I did not enjoy this beer at all. After the obligatory hops all I was left with was a metallic bleh in my mouth. The hops were again floral in nature with just a touch of pineyness. The metallic element lingered in mouth and had me wanting to grab another beer or water to clean it out. I think I am done with Harpoon brews."
"Pours gold in color with just a slight froth of head forming on the pour. Smell is very floral hops. There is a subtle maltiness underneath the hops that show up midway through each sip. Taste is less of the hops, but a balanced ale. Easy to drink and non-cloying. Decent session beer, but nothing great."
"Dark gold in color and a one finger quickly fading head is how it looks. Laces a big more sticky than expected judging from how soon the head vanished. Grassy scent with hints or caramel. Neither of which are very strong if one but it sure got more aroma than a Bud or Labatt Blue. Taste is along the same lines. Slight metallic hop bitterness up front but muted by the malt. Pretty much the same thing going down the throat but with a little bit of a citrus tang sticking to the back of the throat."
"D - This is pretty easy drinking, especially for IPAs (which I don't generally care for) but the beer itself is a let down in taste and the mouthfeel could use some improvement. All that being said, this might be something I pick up a 12 pack of during a night with friends. Drinkable, a little different, and not over the top."
"Pours a very clear yellow/golden color with a decent head.Smells of citrusy hops aromas. Taste is more citrusy hop flavors, juicy, decent hop bitterness in the finish. Kind of watered down v.s. it's contemporaries. Mouthfeel has good carbonation and relatively light and easy drinking. Crisp. Alcohol is detectable. Pretty drinkable."
"Eric"
"Clear honey-amber color and a fluffy white head that didn't last long. Has a floral aroma with some fruit and a nice bitter twang, all of which was present in the taste. Lots of hops, but less than I expected from the smell. Still, it was bitter enough, and with the carbonation would be satisfying on a hot afternoon. As it warmed up it began to taste a little watery. Not much wowie, but decent."
"Drinkability is good. A few of these will certainly get you dancing on the dancefloor, but it will definitely give you a great buzz. Not a bad brew."
"One of my fail safe beers when I go out and all they have is BMC."
"Grabbed a pint the other night before dinner. Came served in a big 20oz imperial pint glass. Kinda flat looking, not a lot of carbonation or head. Smell and taste were both fairly hoppy. Maybe it's due to the shortage, but it's just not as hoppy as it used to be. Fine with me, as I don't want a knock-out type of IPA, but it juts came off as sorta boring. It's a solid IPA but with all the other IPAs out there, it's becoming harder and harder to order this one for an occasional treat."
"M/D: Good carbonation level, medium body. Overall a good beer that is drinkable. Just a solid beer and one that I will reach for again."
"This is a solid IPA and a great session beer."
"I just wish is was 4.9% instead of 5.9% it has snuck up on my a couple times..."
"A pretty average representative of this style."
"Purchased as part of a mix pack. Appropriately served in my Harpoon IPA glass. Poured and orange-gold with crystal clear clarity. Two inch rocky bright white head left behind trails of sticky lacing as the head subsided. Scent was somewhat muted, but a hint of hops with a grassy quality. Taste consistent with nose with some slightly floral undertones, as well as a mild citrus quality. Light and effervescent mouthfeel with a mild carbonation burn and a light citrus astringency along the sides of the tongue. I'm not an IPA fan, so that fact that I like this brew leads me to believe that it may not meet the expectations of IPA afficionados, but it's refreshing and enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: I like this one. Hot weather suits this brew well. I like it ice cold in my frozen pint glass. I do have a homebrewed IPA on tap that I think outclasses this one however."
"Drinkability- Not good. I was anticipating this beer and in the end it just pissed me off."
"D - Very drinkable in my opinion for an ipa: light mouthfeel and low abv. I'd like there to be a little more flavor, though."
"Drinkability is moderate. Low alcohol and decent flavors makes for fairly easy consumption, but this IPA is lacking and uninspiring."
"Tasted fine, sort of mild. Lower bitterness, herbal & floral notes mostly. Lingering hop taste. Label says ""highly-hopped"" yet it's not very bitter at all. Feel is a bit prickly, not bad, sort of middle of the road. Easy to drink and certainly thirst-quenching. I'll revisit this review with a fresher bottle in the future."
"overall, a pretty good beer. it's not going to blow you out of the water as far as IPAs are concerned, but it's a solid session beer (even if it's over 5%) and one i could drink pretty continuously throughout the year. has a nice golden color and a crisp aroma when poured. not overbearing in the hop department, but enough to keep it refreshing and very drinkable. like i said, a good beer, but if your'e looking for a hop bomb or something out of the ordinary as far as IPAs are concerned, you're looking in the wrong place."
"A semi-sweet beer with some good malts, but it is really about the hops. Springy and citric, the hops are prevelant throughout the beer and give off a light drying sensation on the backbite, but this medium-bodied beer goes down smooth and doesn't crush the tongue with hop overload. This is a great IPA and I will gladly have another."
"Drinkability is average, this would make a good session beer if I was in the mood for an IPA of this style."
"Surprisingly light for an IPA. i like the drinkability of this beer. The nice crisp flavor and floral tones make this a very good beer on a hot summer night. A very impressive India Pale Ale. Doesnt have the high alcohol content and isnt AS hoppy as most IPA's but i enjoy this beer very much"
" easily polish of a few of these on a hot summer day.."
"D: Absolutely drinkable. Very tasty brew that has some complexity but still a nice drinker."
"Crisp and clean with a slick medium-light body, this is a nicely balanced IPA. Thirst-quenching."
"D - The drinkability is good. It's not too heavy, but you can't sit down and have a 6 pack without feeling bloated... Has a refreshing taste, a really good beer. Not the best IPA I've ever had, but it's very good. This is one of my staples."
"Notes: Tasty stuff but it drinks more like a plain ol' pale ale in my opinion. Thanks to leftmindedrighty for the bottle!"
"Some IPAs leave that lingering aftertaste that I have difficulty describing other than extreme bitterness and this is one of them."
"D - Much more restrained than I was expecting. However, very easy to drink and a solid offering."
"D: Decently drinkable, but if it had more flavor it would be much better. Still a solid American IPA, and something I'll probably pick up again because its lower ABV makes it somewhat of a sessionable IPA."
"D: Definitely a summer cookout or boat beer to throw back with grilled food. Better than Sierra Nevada's Pale Ale by far."
"D - A little too harsh for a standard IPA... Promising appearance and smell give way to the when in doubt put more hops in it school of brewing"
"Biscuity roasty malt and a good soft hop and alcohol presence. Overall a good drinker, and the mouthfeel seems full enough. This ones just not in my top IPA's, by far."
"Not the best IPA but has a good yeasty taste that many IPAs do not have."
"It pours a deep golden color with a big, thick, and white head that makes nice lace on the glass. A floral bouquet of hops fills the nose. The hops are flavorful with pine and citrus notes over a light toasted and biscuity malt taste. The palate is medium bodied with good carbonation and a hopy bitterness that lingers on the tongue and begs you to take anther sip. Its not over the top hoppy but they are main show here which is how I like an IPA to be."
"One can only hope."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall: Easy going IPA, a good crowd pleaser. Too mild for my taste. In my opinion, it should be a Pale Ale, not an IPA."
"D- This would be an IPA that I could drink heavy quantities of during a warm summer day. Does not stand out as an excellent IPA, but well worth the price. I can see myself drinking this beer often when I want something slightly better than the ""American Light"" beer."
"Overall- I was disapointed with this beer. In comparison to other IPA's this one came up a little small."
"Pours a beautiful bubbly copper with an inch foamy off-white head. Hoppy and floral aroma; the taste follows suit. Crisp with a good amount of carbonation, but very easy to drink. A nice robust taste with a dry finish. Really enjoyed having this with a basket of fish & chips Definitely going to pick up a six pack in the near future."
"Final thoughts - This is a great crossover IPA for those making the leap from Lager to American IPAs. Not too hoppy and very sessionable."
"Drinkability: A standard, basic India Pale Ale, but quite easily drinkable."
"D - Very drinkable, sessionable beer."
"M + D: A medium body, could maybe use a little more expressiveness, but alright. Fairly refreshing, and easy going... I would gladly have it as something of a bulk purchase when trying to avoid overspending, along with something like Sam Adams or Sierra Nevada, but it wouldn't really stand out too much from those, ultimately."
"Poured an attractive golden/amber color with a nice pillowy white head that lasted until the very last sip. Nice lacing also. Aroma was a mix of malt and light floral hops. Taste was a very nice balance of malt and hops. This is not the hop bomb that is characteristic of many American IPAs. This is nicely balanced and sessionable."
"Medium carbonation, light, crisp, clean and very drinkable. Nothing too exciting but light enough to have more than one."
"The smell is a bit off.. musty, with some definite straw/hay tones. But the taste is pretty good. Nice and well balanced.. a good amount of hops, but not too bitter. I would definitely recommend as it's a pretty decent example of an American IPA, and it's easy to find."
"Decently made, clean and refreshing, and not to be negative, but this one focuses on the word ""pale"" part of it's name."
"D - Will always be a staple in my fridge!"
"Harpoon IPA is fairly drinkable especially for its category. I would definitely suggest giving it a try."
"Drinkability: A very good middle of the road IPA, easy to drink several of them and not burn out your taste buds."
"D: Despite only 5.9% ABV, it feels quite strong!, maybe 2 of these max."
"D: very tasty will be good for hot summer work, very refreshing."
"Pours a deep yellow color with a quarter inch of white foam. Smells of yeast and a wee bit of citrus. The taste is more of a pale ale than IPA, but I didn't take this as a bad thing. If it had been labeled as a pale ale, I'd consider it one of the better ones on the market. As an IPA, it was just a bit more yeasty than some people might want, but a blind tasting would get a big thumbs-up in any case. Definitely a beer worth trying."
"Pours a light orange to straw color, very light for an ipa, but had nice head and good lacing. Nice crisp scent, a very light floralness with a nice bitter aroma. Nice taste, the initial taste is not very hoppy, but more citrus, while the aftertaste has the hoppy bitterness. Goes down fine, quite a bit of carbonation. Good IPA, not my favorite, but it's quite good."
"Overall - A decent enough IPA although not a patch on the likes of GD Titan or FD Snake Dog - it's quite mellow by US standards... certainly worth a try though..."
"Overall - Interesting English floral IPA, stands out in that regard but somewhat lacking AIPA qualities that make for an exceptional one in terms of what I enjoy. Not bad."
"D - What I expect from an IPA. Very drinkable. Good brew. Recommended."
"D-Not quite as hoppy or as pronounced a finish as I would like but this would definitely make a great session IPA. Easy to drink and the hops wouldn't get to you"
"D: Incredibly drinkable because it isn't that complex"
"Pretty good. Enjoyable and well balanced with a pleasant mouthfeel. I would definitely drink it again if it comes around."
"D - Good, but not quite the IPA I was expecting....I'm not complaining, but would prefer this beer if I were in a pale ale mood."
"I'd suggest Dogfish Head's IPA's if you're looking for a truer IPA beer."
"D--Get this beer as fresh as you can. A really nice in between IPA. Not too hoppy not too malty. Goldilocks just right."
"Drinkability is definitely a 4...wish it was summer or at least spring. A 6'r of this IPA would be real nice on a warm afternoon."
"22oz bomber purchased from cooler and dated ""best by"" several months from now, so i really don't think i got a bad bottle."
"D - A solid American choice, very drinkable w/ pleasant flavor yet the bitterness isn't overdone. I could quaff several of these without much thought. I would recommend this to those who claim to dislike hoppier beers."
"D: mighty fine. very drinkable. This is one of my go to beers when I'm at a restaurant with limited beer choice."
"Poured a great golden straw color with a thin white head a great lacing. Aroma was of citrusy hops. The taste was great. Hops abound and a nice sweetness to it along with great citrus notes. Mouthfeel was a medium body with medium high carbonation. Overall a damn good IPA! Wish we could get this on a regualr basis here in LA."
"Pours a beautiful clear amber-golden with a decent head. Aroma is strong and surprisingly malty, but there is also a good hop component. Flavor is strongly hoppy with minimal bitterness and a good malty undertone. Thus is a very smooth and definitely enjoyable IPA."
"For a light bodied IPA this really packs in some interesting flavor. The malts used in this are sweet and even without having much of a toasty taste and it works great with the hops. The bittering is just right with some great floral aromas."
"Pours clear amber/golden color, with a nice, full, finger+ thick head, lots of lace on the side of the glass. Sweet and crisp smell, some citrus and fruity aromas with underlying grain tones. Taste is sweet, not as bitter as expected, sweet grain/malt well balanced with a grapefruit and hoppy flavor. Finishes dry. Medium-body, crisp carbonation. Very refreshing, not overly bitter to wear out the palate. A nice, easy IPA."
"Six pack from Hannaford market on sale. Pours a nice golden color with a medium head. Smells very lightly like a pilsner, different from what you would expect. Tastes lightly hoppy, sweet malt, with a biter finish but not too much, very refreshing. Mouthfeel is a bit carbonated for me. Overall it's a good beer if not too exciting or interesting. Probably would get it again if it was another good sale on it."
"Sampled from an X-mas variety pack. Poured into a glass from the bottle. Head is smaller than expected but long lasting. Nice, dark golden color. Hint of flowers as I take a whiff out of glass. First taste is the hops then the malt. Nice lacing on the glass as i drink it down. Very balanced taste. Nice IPA. I am not a big craft/micro person but found IPAs a few years ago thanks to Dogfish. I enjoy the type and the Harpoon IPA. I would drink it again."
"D- This wouldnt be my first pick for an IPA, but it wouldn't be my last either... I'd drink this socially."
"Massive head in a pint glass clear orange copper color with beige medium bubbled head, yeasty looking. Aroma is a bit weak, smells kind of floral. All the carbonation must have gone to the head! Mouthfeel is very thin and under carbonated. Taste is not as hoppy as most IPAs. As a beer it is quite drinkable but as an IPA it is definitely not top shelf. Probably a good beer to drink with pizza."
"D - Definitely worth trying, especially for someone new to the style. Not my favorite, but certainly one that I could revisit at any time."
"Overall, not what i expected at all. I thought it was going to be much hoppier. Its nice to see an ipa without a ton of hops, but i still personally wished to taste a little more in it. According to their website it's only 42 ibu's, which is pretty freakin low for an ipa. This is one i dont mind having, but can only drink 2-3 at most before i grow tired of the floral flavors."
"I guess I should finally review this beer, since it is the one I drink most often at the brewhouse. Color is very light gold and very clear with nice white head. Very clear for an IPA. Smells of nice floral (cascade) hops when nice and fresh on tap. Taste is very crisp with nice hop bitterness that lasts. Overall a nice session IPA."
"Doesn't taste nearly as hoppy as the aroma would indicate. This is a bit bland and watery with a bitter aftertaste. Strange finish to this one."
"Smells very good; I'd love to have a candle with this aroma. It's a good beer and widely available. Might appeal to people who like a bit more malt in their IPA. I still drink it from time to time, though, as it's a lower ABV for the style so I can have a few and still enjoy my favorite type of beer."
"Decently hoppy with a citrus edge, not much malt in the forefront to balance out the bitterness of the hops in the aftertaste. For all its unbalanced glory, its taste is not too bad for an IPA."
"d- Very drinkable. Overall, this was good in the style with some interesting hop combinations."
"D: For what it's worth, easy to drink."
"Overall- Very sessionable. Not too bitter or strong. Little bit sweeter and less dry than I like most of my IPA's, but not a bad thing in this one. Very smooth."
"I could have confused it for a pale ale, as this is a well balanced, albeit averagish example of an IPA. Still, you can find this all around Boston, and it might make a good starter beer for those who are getting into hoppier beers."
"Pours a crystal clear amber with a nice crème head. Nose is hops with a strong leaning towards very live tree evergreen tree needles. Flavor is hops all in the mouth. But it certainly isn't obliterating my palate. It stays smooth and even, and after a long time, I get a rather earthy aftertaste that some might say was dirty. Feel has a lot of carbonation that goes over the tongue. This is drinkable yes. Seems like the tail end of it could use more balance or rounding out, but overall it is still a good IPA."
"Harpoon IPA pours a pale copper color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a floral hoppy aroma. There is a sprizty carbonation and a thin mouthfeel. There is a mostly floral hop flavor. There is a bitter aftertaste. I'm used to much more aggressively hopped IPAs. Worth a try."
"The IPA is a fine example of an India Pale Ale. The appearance is nice, the smell is awesome, with a great taste with many hops hitting your palate. It feels great in your mouth and has an excellent drinkability. This beer is a great complement to hot wings or a burger. This is the pride of Harpoon in my view."
"i was a little disappointed seeing the review averages/scores for this beer after buying it, but after having this beer i was pleasantly suprised. this is a highly drinkable, very sessionable ipa. appearance is an inviting hazy full gold in color with a creamy white head. nose is of honeyed, doughy malts along with flowery, fruity, and citric notes. taste is eminently drinkable, a nice balance of soft, lightly sweet malts and a very smooth hop bitterness. frothy and relatively light-bodied for an ipa. this shit goes down easy and at this abv you can have a few. this would be a great ipa for the summer or to introduce newcomers to the style."
"Drinkability: Very good. This is a fine session beer."
"D - This beer is very easy to drink if your not used to IPAs this is a not too strong of one to try"
"This beer is a sub-par stab at a craft IPA, because it doesn't have a particularly big or interesting hop bill, and the malts feel a bit too thin. I didn't get any distinguishing features on the palate other than some muted fruit and pine; to be honest it was kind of bland. Mouthfeel was a bit thin and watery too. There are better IPAs out there. This is OK, but I wouldn't go back to it."
"This was on tap at the Flying Dog tap room as part of a bet on the World Series, ugh. Anyway, the beer was a nice golden color with a standard head atop. The smell was subdued with a slight floral hop aroma minutely registering. The taste was more of the smell but just too subdued. I like balanced IPA's but this was just too easygoing and subtle. It was almost as if this was a JV pale ale that wanted to be varsity so bad...Nice to have tried it but this will not sell well as an IPA around here, we know better. The Red Sox may have won the World Series but our IPA's beat the shit out of yours on a regular basis you bitches."
"This is not a GREAT beer, by which I mean it's terribly accessible. It is what it is--a robust, full, fruity hopped-up beer. As much as I like dirty double stouts and bitter imperial IPAs, the Harpoon IPA is a winner. Maybe ""delicious"" is a careful appropriate word here. Unfortunately, every place I've seen that carries it carries better beer. Oh well, it's worth it now and agian, and is a great gift for the novice who likes IPA but doesn't know the difference between Pale Ale and IPA. A gift, that is, were I get to keep/have some."
"Poured light gold into a nonic glass, with about two inches of creamy white head. The aroma was everything I hope for in an IPA. A pungent pine signifies there are cascades in this beer. The taste did not disappoint, a bitter and hoppy brew we have here. Pine notes with citrus undertones confirms, yep, those are cascades! A slight malty tone followed in the aftertaste. The feel was fizzy, with a medium body. This brew is definitely a hop head's dream. I found it hard to keep it in the fridge, while waiting for the right time to want to sit down and review it. Glad it finally happened so I could enjoy this brew."
"Pours a clean/clear golden yellow color, I don't see too many IPAs look like this, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy white head, which then leaves some nice sticky lacing. The nose is malty/hoppy, not much citrus or pines in this one, and some caramel tones. The taste is a nice balance of hops/malts, nice little touch of bitterness/sweetness. Medium body. Drinkable, a different IPA in my book, tasty. This is also my first brew from Harpoon."
"I really like this beer. It is often one of the best beers you can order at a mainstream pub. The smell of it is not like a typical IPA, because it is not too earthy. It's a very clean beer that goes down easy. Sometimes too easy. This is both a tasting and a session beer."
"my next offering from harpoon was the IPA ; pours a slightly hazy med-gold with a fluffy white head & some lacing ; a good hop smell w/ some maltiness ; a fair tangy hop bite at first with a slight metallic taste behind it kinda watery though ; a little on the light side here as well ; not a bad beer, i'll enjoy the other two in the pack for sure..."
"D- This definitely didn't blow me away, but there is something very subtle I like about this."
"Overall, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm glad I tried Harpoon's I.P.A.. Definitely glad I tried it because it is quite good. Nothing spectacular, but quite refreshing."
"This is a really good IPA. I think I would've enjoyed it more if it was fresher off the tap."
"Bottom line: This kind of reminds me of a English Style IPA in that the malt character doesn't just make an appearance, it shares equal billing with the hops. It's a very balanced brew and easy to drink. I like it."
"A very drinkable IPA! I'm not a huge fan of the style because I prefer a malty brew over a hoppy one, but this is very good and easy-drinking due to the milder hops flavor. A hop-head would probably prefer a more intense hop flavor, but for me it was about the best IPA I've had to date."
"Pours a crisp light orange with a decent off-white head that diminished to a ring. The aroma is floral citrus hops with sweet malt. The taste is citrus hops just slightly overpowering the malts. The beer is very light and crisp with moderate carbonation. This is certainly one that makes for a very sessionable IPA."
"This beer is always a pleasure to have. It has a very nice golden amber color with a thick white head that sticks to the glass. The smell is really nice. Very fresh, very hoppy and fruity and flowery that overpower the malt tones. The taste is phenomenal. One of the best IPAs, if not the best, I have ever had. It tastes fruity and hoppy and very light malt taste in the background. The good thing about this IPA is that this does not have a very acidy taste, very clean. It's aftertaste is clean and not too bitter which I really like. Very good mouthfeel and very good all around. This is excellent and I recommend it for anyone who wants a refreshing IPA."
"Although in general, not a huge fan of IPA's, this was a decent brew that just didn't do it for me... A strong, bitter taste predominates the palate, with an oily aftertaste that just wasn't too appealing... I had it on draft and in a bottle, with the bottle tasting obviously stronger and more concentrated. If you are a fan of IPA's, this is worth a try, but there are better selections out there on the market..."
"Drinkability: This is a decent IPA. It is dryingly bitter without the oiliness from the hops. It is very drinkable, but below average in a league of other mediocre to very good India Pale Ales. So far I have not been impressed with what Harpoon beers I have reviewed."
"Pours a clear pale gold with a minimal creamy head. Nice lacing along the glass. The smell is hops and rose hips. The taste is hoppy but all flavor not the kick of bitterness I feared. Very smooth flavor complements the creamy mouthfeel. Aftertaste is bitter and crisp. The drinkability is great as its a very refreshing beer"
"Overall, not a great IPA. Lacking the usual IPA intensity."
"This beer poured a golden straw with a very small head that stayed for a while. The smell is a little yeasty with a big dose of floral hops. The taste is a real treat, with a nice bit of malts and very present sweet taste that reminds me very much of fresh cut flowers and maybe a little caramel. The finish has just a tiny little hops bite that really cuts through the flowery sweetness. The drinkability is a little above average, and I wouldn't mind having another one after this. I found this beer very enjoyable, and as of right now it's up towards the top of my list of IPAs."
"Drinkable, but the taste and mouthfeel are poor for a Harpoon."
"I like the hop taste to this beer, but it is almost too much. There is no balance to it, so it takes the drinkability down a peg. Because of the extreme tart taste, one could only have so many of these."
"A pale golden brew with a whispy white head and decent lacing. The aroma is pretty mild flowery hops dominant over a bit of bread/wheat. The taste is again dominated by the floral hops with a background of some malt. It has a nice sweet citrus orange flavor mixed in with sprite carbonation, easy drinking. Very nice as a relatively light but flavorful American IPA. Always open to one of these."
"Years ago this was my first IPA....pours a golden yellow with a large head from a vigorous pour. Smells strongly of sweet flowered hops, and a bit of grain. The taste is light, with some bitter hops balanced nicely with malts, and a flowery finish. This is a very well balanced, easy to drink IPA. Nothing thats going too wow the beer snobs out their, but very sesionable, and drinkable beer."
"This is an easy going sessionable IPA."
"Pours a clear golden, honey like color in the glass with a thick fluffy white head which quickly subsided leaving behind some fair lacing. Smells of hops, but not too strongly. Somewhat citrusy and flowery. Tastes of malt up front followed by bitter, spicy hops. Smooth and easy to drink, lightly carbonated."
" I like this one. A bit more dry and clean than many other American IPAs."
"Pours a very light copper with a white rocky head. Agressive up front hop aroma. Strong resins of citrus, pine and floral smells dominate the aroma. The front end is very bitter, and while the body is a bit on the thin side, this IPA remains very well balanced. The middle and finish are smooth and dry. Definitely a crisp finish. This perfectly carbonated -just enough CO2 to bring out a snappy, bitter profile. A very nice IPA, even if its a bit on the thin side."
"Drinkability- Not to shabby, Id have a few."
"Drinkability - As I said this has become my safety brew at Happy Hours due to it's availability. Not something you'd go out of your way to find, but always a solid choice when there's limited options."
"The taste is balanced, not to hoppy but they are certainly the most dominant factor but there is also a nice malt presence that makes this IPA very drinkable. Hints of earth/floral/citric hops. This is a laid back IPA and there is nothing wrong with that in my books."
"Large, loose foam with staying power, this also laces nicely. Attractive, but more like the"" friend of the hot girl"". This has a pale, sun-kissed appearance. Moderately carbonated. Not highly aromatic, I pick up lemon and grass. Taste is quite similar, in that it doesn't really have much as far as a flavor profile, but doesn't taste horrible either. Mild-to-above-average bitterness that lingers a little too long in the finish. Crisp, and easy drinking. Nothing to brag about, nothing to turn your back to. This is more of a BMC crowd's IPA to me."
"I do enjoy this beer, though much moreso when on tap, same old story that bottles do not do most beers any justice. A solid, drinkable, not overly done American IPA."
"D - A disappointing brew. One dimensional in its hoppy bitterness and too light in other regards. The nose is promising, but ultimately fails to deliver."
"Harpoon IPA might have been the 'be all and end all' at some point in the history of the craft beer movement, but it's no longer on the cutting edge. The good thing is that it has retained enough sharpness to be enjoyable (on occasion) to hopheads and to be a good introduction to those who wonder what 'all this fuss about hops' is about."
"Ive certainly had better IPA than this one. I am not even sure I would recommend this over others such as Bells or Founders or even SN Pale."
"I'm a fairweather Harpoon fan, as I tend to get their IPA in a pinch and tend to favor the Winter Warmer only, but this IPA will never let you down, not will it wow you in the taste department."
"Drinkability is fine. It could use some aroma hops, and a bit more body and color. All around a great beer with moderate alcohol."
"Overall a pleasant brew. Would fit on a hot day or with light food. For an IPA it is too meek & mild on the hops. I like an IPA to be a stand alone and this brew is not bold enough for that. I kept looking for the hops to come through but to no avail. Most describe an IPA with different comparison to pine, citrus etc. Not this one. Also much paler than most. If you want an IPA it is best to look elsewhere."
"I poured about 10oz of this into a large goblet, as all my 12oz glasses were dirty. It gave me two fingers of head, a honey-brown color, and a continual stream of bubbles that made for excellent retention. And then, sure enough, it's an IPA, with lots of floral, piney notes in the aroma. The flavor is fruity, clean and refreshing and finishes with a very hoppy flourish. Good balance. Lots o' bubbles in the mouth make it feel thick and creamy, and it was a pleasant drink. Later I noticed that this bottle was almost a year old, but it seemed OK."
"The hops just weren't what they should be. That's not to say they were non-existant, but they were along the potency of an APA and tasted poor in quality. The flavor overall was good but just not a good depiction at all of the style."
"Overall impression: Not a bad beer - not quite what I was expecting, but enjoyable and sessionable."
"D: This has long been one of my standard IPAs to drink as it's easily available anywhere in the Boston area. It was also one of the first IPAs I really started drinking regularly which led into my love of the style overall. Very drinkable and enjoyable, a good example of the style, and one of Harpoon's best regular offerings."
"Drinkability: Nothing to detract from this beer. Glad I tried it... probably wouldn't turn one down.... a very SAFE IPA. But I probably will choose more ROBUST IPA's in the future."
"M & D: Mediu bodied. Good carbonation. Not too dry. Goes down easy with a tasty finish. Darn good IPA."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer for me.The alcohol is borderline for a session style, but I would have no problem getting this to serve at my next summer party."
"D: Not bad. I'd have it again, and would be interested in trying it on tap."
"Drinkability - For an IPA it is underpowered, this makes this a wonderful session beer. Remarkably refreshing for an IPA."
"Color is an attractive, deep golden orange. Pours clear with a respectable cake of creamy, just-off-white head that laces well. Hops dominate the relatively weak nose, though not to the extent that the malts aren't recognizable as well. The smell dissipates pretty quickly after the pour. Citrusy hop flavors endure throughout, really kicking in after the initial malty sweetness fades. Finish is surprisingly crisp and long-lasting. Pretty nicely balanced but without anything remarkable. A decent and drinkable IPA, but there are more interesting ones out there."
"D - I won't get this one again, but it's not awful."
"D - This is a very nice IPA. An impressive beer for their flagship brew."
"Pours a slightly amber golden yellow with effervescent carbonation and holds up a two plus finger heady that is creamy. Aroma is grapefruit and floral hops and reminds me much of DFH kind of IPA, that multi-hop aroma style IPA, with lots od dry hopping. Taste is definite toasted up front, with a fruity yeast character here, and it;s hoppy but with a genuine malt character more than a hop bomb alone, and the malt shows up in the finish as well. Unique and I dig it, really good, stiff competition for DFH 60 minute actually. Mouthfeel is too carbonated, and it's medium bodied. Overall, I'm not much of an IPA guy but for once an a while, but this is a favorite. This type of IPA which focuses on floral hops doesn't go too well with food, though, which is why despite enjoying them once in a while stand alone, I don't drink them all that often."
"This is a typical IPA. It has great aroma of citrusy and slightly floral hops. It pours a deep golden color, and has a fantastic white long lasting head with good lacing. The initial flavor is very hoppy, with a nice bitterness, however a slight detection of alcohol exists, but this isn't abnormal for the style. It might need a little more bittering hops to balance it out more. The grain bill appears to be slightly weak as well, making the beer have a bit of a hollow body. Pretty good IPA overall, worth trying."
"Pours a lighter than amber, even a pale golden color. In the aroma a bit citrusy hop, but not too big. In the taste, a grapefruity hop and a nice balanced IPA. This was the first IPA I ever remember having and always talkit up a bit. I get some crap from friends, but I think it is a stand up good IPA."
"Beautiful amber ale with clingy head. The original grapefruit IPA in New England. This one leans towards ruby red grapefruit juice in flavor, with a hop aroma that keeps the glass under your nose. When this beer was first introduced I believed it was an east-coast answer to the aromatic dry-hopped beers from California. A session IPA compared to more recently popular American IPA's. Great with meals and found in many restaurants, this classic has stood the test of time."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light body with medium levels of carbonation. Typical bodied beer, nothing to write home about. The beer goes down easily, not a bad beer, but nothing that really ""wows"" one. In a pinch I'd buy it again, but there is nothing about it that would make me seek it out. Not off the mark, just average, nothing spectacular."
"A pale, almost yellow shade with a 1"" head. Smell is faint, at best with nothing in particular to pull from it. Really, overall, this was rather disappointing to me considering the quality of their UFO product line. The taste was a bit empty, but had a decent mouthfeel, and was just a bit too dry of a finish. The drinkability is likely the best facet of this beer. The dryness is not overpowering, luckily."
"D: Easy drinking approachable starter IPA. Very sessionable. Hop heads stay away."
"D- Excellent. one of the most drinkable IPA's I've had."
"Easy to drink, but not exactly remarkable. There are a lot more options out there on the style, but perhaps I should still try it in bottles as suggested by other reviewers."
"Rather disappointing. . . poured this from a 12 oz. bottle into a goblet; result was a fizzy head that disappeared quickly, leaving some lace. The beer is a clear attractive amber color and looks like it should be better than it is. Actually, Harpoon IPA isn't a bad beer, it's just not what I've come to expect in an IPA. It seems underhopped and not complex; if I drank it blind I'd almost guess it was a good Central European Pilsner rather than an American IPA. I could see guzzling this on a hot day, that's about all."
"A nice, mild IPA. Good summer beer for the pool. Not going to create a memorable impression, though."
"D: Really easy drinking, smooth IPA."
"D- Very good, fresh tasting."
"First taste is all about the hops, nice for this style, so many offerings are too weak in this regard. After the initial onslaught of hops, the taste is very smooth and crisp; this will be an excellent summer-night brew. Aftertaste is minimal and pleasant, floral feel left on the pallet that just begs you to have more. Instantly became one of my favorites."
"DA: This one goes down s00oo easy it's scary."
"This beer pours a light copper color. Aroma has a decent hop bouquet and the taste follows. Not too hoppy and not not too much of anything else. Solid flavor. A pretty good representation of its style. To some, Harpoon is a benchmark for IPAs. I would say that it's a good starting point."
"an unassuming brother"
"D - Okay. I actually prefer the APA. This is a bit too dry for my liking. I like thirst quenching to be a property of my IPAs."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a large and fluffy white head. Pleasant aromas of citrus, hops, and some pine. Flavors of fresh bitter hops, mild citrus and pine, earthy grain notes, and a nice subdued malt presence. Very drinkable and just a solid all-around IPA."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability: Smooth, tasty, easy-drinking beer. One of the best IPAs I have ever tasted, although I will admit, I haven't tasted that many IPAs. A great experience, and definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability & Notes: First time in the bottle, second time overall, love the crisp hoppiness"
"Drinkability: Drinkable, probably more so due to its mildness."
"VERY easy to drink and flavorful AIPA. As a rule the beers that interest Beer Advocates are too much for most of the beer drinkers of the USA this is one that is both outstanding and accessible to more casual beer drinkers."
"Above average. A great summer picnic beer. Makes for a good baseline to find greatness in others in the style. Very much a session beer. Nothing to disappoint."
"I very strong beer. Good stuff."
"I had a few left over Guinness Extra Stout's from St. Patty's Day and made myself a ""Black & Blonde"" with this beer... very tasty mix!"
"Clear yellow pour with a nice thick persistent head. No lacing. The smell is of fresh hops and is quite inviting. The taste is hoppy and a slight bit citrus like. The mouthfeel is fairly thin, but fits the brew quite well. Overall, this is a tasty beverage that is a delight  very drinkable."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a pale golden color, good foamy head with a minute amount of swirliness and lacing. Hops dominate the smell, slightly floral, a fair amount of bitter in the nose. Taste follows with a good dose of hops. Nothing skunky but rather bitter, a little floral, and tiny hints of sweetness. Mouthfeel is thin, but that's an IPA for ya. Not a bad one, I'd definitely have again if I want an IPA (which is not too often)."
"This IPA pours a medium amber with a medium head and decent head retention. The aroma is not as hoppy as I would expect from an American IPA. I really struggled to descibed the smell of this beer. I keep going back to the smell of sourdough bread. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. Flavor is nice, but still light on that hop bitterness. This beer is pleasant and easy to drink but not the best IPA I've ever had."
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, good kick, slightly filling, good representation of style. The first time that I had this beer I didn’t like it at all, but since then it has grown on me, which is fortunate for me as a hophead, because it’s the most common IPA in the area on-tap."
"Overall, a great beer for hop heads who arent ready to destroy their palate but would still like a dose of tasty hop. Recommended."
"D - A solid beer; it's just basically a good IPA with a nice all-around solid flavor but nothing particularly unique; it's almost a archetype for that IPA taste"
"Paid $1.25 for a bottle"
"Drinkability was fine but Harpoon has never been an IPA that excited me. The hops of Sam Adams Boston Lager are more interesting. To me, the Harpoon IPA is a serious underachiever."
"Pours a perfectly clear yellowish gold in color with nearly two fingers of fluffy white head and some nice lacing. Smells of floral hops with a very light maltiness. Taste is dominated by bitter floral, lightly herbal hops although there is just a mere indication of malts. Flavors are fairly well-balanced for an IPA. Nice mouthfeel, solid body, moderate carbonation. Good drinkability, has a nice crisp, clean finish. This is a great session IPA."
"Like the bottle says this beer is a light ""copper"" color. I poured it into my SS pint glass and it arrived with a nice creamy head on top. Smell is slightly piney with a bit of citrus and floral aromas but not overpowering by any means, just nicely done. Taste is very straightforward and typical for an IPA. Not as much bitterness in the finish as other regular IPA's I've had. A good starter IPA. Mouthfeel is kind of watery and thin. I would call this a session IPA. I could definitely knock out a few of these. Overall I'd recommend this one to a friend."
"Drinkability: easy drinking IPA is not overpowering. Could definitely enjoy several of these at any one session."
"Harpoon IPA feels very wet, and not dry at all. No oily hops presence here... NEEDS MORE HOPS."
"I found it to be very drinkable."
"Amber body with a little under a half an inch of off-white head. Smells great - like citrus and bitter hops, strong but not overpowering, and no off scents or alcohol. Tastes hoppy - bitter, piney, and citrus, ballanced with a good malt backbone. Creamy mouth-feel on the higher side of medium bodied, but not sticky and syrupy as some IPAs can be. At the same time, it's very pleasant and drinkable. This beer is really good. A new favorite!"
"A great IPA that you can drink any time. I had the Winter Warmer first, so that could have been the reason for my high marks, but their IPA has always been good from what I've heard before. Everything about it is typical IPA but that's not a bad thing at all. Very smooth throughout and complemented my steak tips really well. This isn't as common as Sam Adams Boston Lager in most bars/restaurants, but many that I've been to have Harpoon IPA as one of the few micros amongst the Bud and all that. I never hesitate to order it."
"Not one of Harpoon's best. Poured a golden yellow, but with very little head. Smell is light on the nose, a combination of yeast and floral hop notes. Tase carries over the floral hops, but had a slighly medicinal quality. Mouthfeel was medium with a slightly chewy quality. Drinkability is ok, but not the best IPA."
"A good choice for the hop friendly in the area since a lot of places outside of beerbars have this beer on tap. It is not an overpowering or complex beer but provides a mild taste right for just kickin' back and enjoying which ever occasion."
"D- the odd taste in the middle (soap) ruins the drinkability of this one for me."
"This is the beer that I fell in love with in Boston. It is the ""old stand by", the one you call on. A perfect play for company or a lawn beer. Buy this beer and go to the brewery when you have the chance."
"($7.99 / 6-pack)"
"A very decent IPA- good looking, crisp and true to form. The cloudy golden pour let loose some spicy hops- nice smack on the tongue at first taste, good quality hops and not overdone on the malts. A good starter for the new hop heads, goes well with most anything you can eat and well balanced for maximum drinkability. Try the oak aged brew by Harpoon for some more complexity."
"Which I actually consider a good thing, as the respectable but not overwhelming hops make it more drinkable than many other IPAs. Definitely a quality beer."
"On tap at Legal Seafood's Flagship in Park Square. A beer with a beautiful yellow-orange hue and a thin head that dissipates quite quickly. The 5.9 % abv is completely hidden behind flowery hops. Not a hop monster by any means actually at the bitterness of some breweries pales. The hops don't disappear and the last taste is of hops. Very drinkable and a very good old reliable. This is definetly a beer that Boston should be proud of to be brewed here and served in even some of the least reputable of establisments."
"This was not a great beer by any stretch, but it was a perfectly good one. If I'm looking specifically for an IPA, I'm never going to go out and look for a six-pack of this stuff if the Smuttynose or the Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale is available, but it's certainly satisfying. It's also ubiquitious on tap in the Boston area -- you'll see it at pretty much every chain restaurant with a crappy beer list and thank your lucky stars that it's there."
"It was even better. The smell was like floral perfume, and the taste of the hops not much different. enough malt to balance it out and a crisp finish with a nice bitterness on the back of your tongue. I could drown myself in this on a Saturday night."
"Drinkability: pretty decent drinking beer. Several of these can be quaffed in a session. This is a beer that I revisit a few times over the year, but it is not a staple IPA in my house."
"Pours to a lasting foam head and golden color. The hop aroma is somewhat mild for a U.S. IPA, but is nonetheless very pleasant--lots of citrusy-piney American character. Flavor is light for an IPA, but sufficiently hoppy with just enough malt character to balance the bitterness. Light-medium mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. A ""session"" IPA if there ever was one."
"I got this 12 ounze bottle from a Harpoon Mix case, and poured into a pint glass. It had a beautiful amber/goldish color with 2 and a half fingers of head. There was good retention, not to long not to short. There was a lot of lace immediatly, but it wasn't very sticky so it dissapeared over time. The smell was that of a typical IPA, hoppy and spicy. The mouthfeel was not smooth, but not rigid either. All in all a solid brew. Don't drink and review."
"Taste is bitter with citric notes, hop aromatic and malty, a nice balance. The beer is slightly sticky and sizzling of the carbonation. Overall a very clean beer without any signs of yeast fruitness or anything. I expected the bitterness to be higher and the beer less drinkable, but I think bitterness grows on you."
"D - Easy to drink and refreshing."
"D- It's a good average IPA (with floral hops instead of citrus). Its a nice easy beer to drink. Would be a good session beer."
"This is my favorite end-all beer. I can find it almost anywhere, and it saves me from Bud. I love the floral aroma it gives off and the slight bite with the initial sip. It's a smooth finish and the residual taste is very similar to the initial smell...which I like...this beer never deceives me."
"Pale amber color. This beer is very crisp. Too crisp for an IPA in my opinion. I didn't appreciate the wateriness. The aftertaste was also not as pleasant as I had hoped. It's very dry and leaves a bitter bite on the back of the tongue.The package store I work at sells a lot of this, so I thought it would be better. The hops are there (piney), but I prefer a better malt backbone. I'll wait till I see this on draft to try it again."
" This IPA was an amber color, slightly cloudy, plenty of carbonation. The spicy hops aroma went pleasantly with the yeast and citrus undertones. As with Harpoons other light beer (UFO) this ale has very good mouthfeel. A clean drinking beer which went extremely well with my rare roastbeef sandwich (the New Englander)."
"A great American IPA. Has a great citrusy nose and taste (Cascade?). Malt flavor is slight, with a hint of biscuit. The bitterness seems about medium for an IPA. Very, very drinkable. Definitely an IPA for the masses. This is the IPA that I tend to compare other new American style IPAs to when I drink them, although I like a bit more color, malt character, and body for my ideal IPA. Cheers to Harpoon for putting out a great product year after year."
"A nice, solid, and affordable IPA. I picked at a 12 pack at Wegmans for $13. Its a touch light in color and head, but has great lacing. Smells of citrus and grapefuit. Tastes of biscuit malts and citrus hops. A nice kick of bitterness, but nothing you cant handle. Easy to drink and tasty."
"Pours 14k gold with good clarity. Creamy white head of one and a half fingers shows good retention and decent spotty lacing. Slight apple ester in the nose with some mild chinook and cascade aromas. Flash of sweet toasted malt upfront, followed by a blast of grassy american hop flavor and mild grapefruit rind taste, which then dissipates to a solid bitterness. A pinch of high-Alpha acid hop flavor in the aftertaste, but mostly just a bland, dry bitterness. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body- this seems too crisp and light for the style with an unbalanced bitterness and lack of hop flavor and aroma. Finishes bitter but clean. While this very drinkable and devoid of any significant flaw, it's also kind of boring."
"Decent, medium bodied IPA...I'd like to try it on tap sometime."
"."
"By no means is it the best American IPA I have ever had, but there's also nothing wrong with it, and fits the bill when you want a good beer to drink while out, or sitting at home watching some sports."
"M&D - that balance and the smoothness make this a great IPA, and one of the best IPA's to session"
"Pours a dark straw color with a 1-inch head. Smelled hoppy and grassy...more herbal/flowery than anything. Hops take over in the first sip, but it goes down very smoothly and a citrus/floral aftertaste comes right back up. A very nice balance - good for the hop-heads, but not so bitter that it goes over the top."
"Drinkability and other notes- It certainly goes down smooth and easily, but overall this is a very average beer. It tastes like a ""macro IPA"" that would appeal to the masses, but that's good for quaffability."
"I have had it on-top before and rember liking it better in that format."
"Drank too easy, a good ipa with a bit of English influnce IMO"
"The bottle looked nice, and it smelled just a little hoppy. Then I took my first sip and BANG--hops hops and more hops. To the point that it tasted like chlorophyl. I don't mind ESB's so I don't think it was the bitterness that got me. It was just pungent. I had to pass it around to get it finished."
"D. Off the charts. Widely available in Massachusetts, and New England."
"I had reviewed this on tap earlier. Not much difference with the bottle. Still a solid, but not spectacular American IPA. After six more months of reviewing since the last Harpoon review, I had to downgrade the appearance for a less than spectacular head. I thought the taste was better than I remembered from before, because the flavor comes out better without the frosted beer mug from the bar. I had this one with spicy Chinese food and the flavor stood up very well. Still wouldn't be my first IPA choice, but I would jump on it is a restaurant if faced with the usual boring choices."
"I'd say stay away if the bottled on date is more than a couple months."
"the flavor was malty, citrus, spicy, ending with a mineralness and spiciness."
" Wavz"
"Tastes starts with a strong, very fruity hop. Apricot hops, very sweet and very dry and bitter. Nice. Mix that with a fruity, crisp malt and you got yourself one tasty, well-balanced IPA."
"12oz bottle. Pours fairly pale, with medium carbonation. Head fades pretty quickly, but has decent lacing. Nice, floral hoppy aroma. Taste is enjoyable, but a bit lacking, and not as full, hoppy and fruity as I was hoping from the aroma. As this beer appears to be pretty readily available in the Boston area, I would definitely choose it again when offered alongside the big brews, if no interesting micros are available."
"A very basic beer, Harpoon IPA doesnt stray far from the style at all. I think its sweeter than many other IPAs Ive had, and could use a bit less malt character and more hop flavor. There's a definate alcohol flavor in this one, not unwelcome but it comes on a bit strong. But all in all, not a bad beer and certainly an easy drinker."
"Decent mouthfeel, very drinkable due to a smooth and muted flavor. This is a good beginner IPA and a decent selection at a New England bar that doesn't feature many craft brews."
"Drinkability: This is a damn good beer and you can drink a lot of them. Perfect for just about any gathering. Recommend popping a few open with some pungent cheeses for a lunchtime treat!"
"It's better than average, and if not special, it does pack enough to make it enjoyable. The building-block combo of malt and hops and yeast yield a pleasant character that makes it crisp and drinkable. So it may not stand out in a crowd, but it does manage to hold its own well enough."
"Very good IPA, especially for the price. When comparing to $30 and up for a case of IPA, should you buy it in that manner, it makes this IPA much more attractive. Locally it is accessible for around $13 a 12 pack. Not the best IPA I have tasted, but above others for me that are more pricey. Good lawn mowing IPA, little spill here or there doesn't make you cry. Not my favorite thing to do either, but spillin' a Titan makes me worrysome."
"This was a flavorful, thirst quenching beer and a great selection overall (especially for the price)."
"Decent but plain."
"The IPA class is rapidly becoming one of my top favorites. I'm still a bit preferential to English bitters, but if there are more beers like this one out there, I may have to rearrange my priorities."
"Drinkability: Goes down easy. Drinkable, sessionable, better than I remember."
"Drinkability: The ale is very drinkable with a firm hop character that is spicy without numbing the tastebuds."
"Thanks to JeffKrenner for the opportunity. Now enjoy your Sand Dune IPA that you're going to get in return."
"One of my favorite American IPAs. Or maybe it's just the weather."
"Pours to a very pale orange, with medium white head and good lacing throughout. Strong citrus aroma, mostly grapefruit, lemon and orange, with a hint of floral. Fruits carry over to the taste, and leaves a good finish. Overall, this is a good tasting IPA at a value price"
"The beer pours gold with a tall, white head. Smells very citrus with notes of hops. the sip starts bitter which lead to a slight malty taste which is immediately replaced by hops. It closes with a slight alcohol taste. I think it's a bit too carbonated. over all its a tasty beer, easy enough you can drink a few in a row. Worth a try no doubt."
"The aroma on this was like sniffing a fat bag of Cascade hops-beautifully pungent. A nice head formed but then dissipated quickly with small dots of lace. A nice swirl of the glass brings it back nicely. Harpoon calls this a copper-colored ale but surpisingly I found it much lighter in color. Hops are strong and first on the palate. If you drink it slowly across the palate, sweet flavors are revealed. A vigorous froth in the mouth totally sweetens this IPA and releases all the wonderful malt flavors-Amazing! Hops are steady through to the finish. The belch from this IPA is heavenly as though I am generating essence of Cascade! This IPA has all that i love about them: killer aroma, generous hop flavor and the malt flavors to boot with a killer finish. very drinkable. Cheers!"
"Pours a clear & almost glowing orange color with subtle copper hues. A frothy, white head develops quickly and stays intact for a few moments before dissipating and leaving behind some nice lacing. Aromas of fresh citrus, juicy hops, bubble gum, grass, and pine; quite aromatic and yet not overpowering or fear-inspiring. The taste is loaded with juicy hops and citrus/grapefruit flavors, but not entirely unbalanced with a mild (but present) malt profile that grows over time. Refreshing and crisp, this beer feels like it is cleaning my tongue with every sip. The carbonation adds a touch of cream-like texture to the already silky and slighly oily mouthfeel. Very easy to drink and enjoy with a variety of dishes including Mexican cuisine and an assortment of aged cheeses."
"Overall a nice AIPA. Not the greatest one out there, but definitely highly drinkable and enjoyable."
" Overall, well balanced and very drinkable."
"While many new IPA's have certainly entered the realm of Imperial or double IPA, and surely are jam packed full of flavor, I wonder how many reviewers remember when Harpoon was the only company that made one. And in 94 it was certainly more hoppy than any beer I had ever tasted. It still holds up as a great tasting brew. That unique bubblegum flavor poons' yeast spits out really sits well with the cascade nose. Really clean and fresh when in Boston. Hard to find a better choice when in the city, rarely disappoints. It seems to me that many newbie IPA brewers are just masking nasty yeast aroma or low boils or lackluster fermentation, with huge amounts of hops, alcohol, or residual sugar. To pack the flavorful punch of Harpoon into 5.9% and 42 ibu's is a testament to the brewers passion for drinkable beer."
"M/D- Medium bodied, moderate carbonation....this beer lightly coats the tongue as it goes down....very pleasant....It was a nice intro to Harpoon for me."
"Into a pint glass, it settled into a dark gold color with a slight head that thinned, but never completely disappaited. Hoppy, but not overwhelmingly so. Slight citrus undertones in the aftertaste, but very slight. It has a nice mouthfeel to it and a crisp finish. Slight lacing in the glass. Overall, pretty decent."
"delicious in succession."
"P.S. It's not as pretty on tap (not as good a head or lacing, I find) but it may taste even hoppier."
"Poured into a 20 oz. pint glass, a lite golden color with hints of orange on the sides. A soft white heaed forms, which slowly goes down the glass, slight visibility of carbonation. The strong scent of flowers and citrus, mostly of grapefruit, are the dominating aromas. The taste comes in quickly with a hit of malt, then the hops take over with a citrusy bitterness. The mouhtfeel starts very lite, but it gains weight as it crosses the palate. The hops leave a dry finish on the palate at the end. Overall, this is an average IPA, it is not a hop monster, but it does give that good hop flavor that IPA's are known for. This is a solid beer for this style."
"I like hops yet I won't seek this one out again. Not bad but there are too many other interesting IPA's out."
"Overall, a decent, better than average, drinkable ale. If you like a lot of hops (and I do), than this one will do you right."
"A great warm weather beer, very light and tasty, one I will reach fore again"
"Nice aromas and appearance, but the flavors are off-balanced and astringent. An average tasting IPA at best. Time to tweak the recipe to keep up with the tasty IPA's of today."
"A very solid brew, definitely worth trying."
"Although this beer came to the table with very little head, most beers I've ordered from FS come that way. This IPA was a lighter crystal clear amber. There was not much floral hops in the nose that I've come to enjoy from Highland's Kashmir IPA, this let me down quite a bit. The first sip was very dissapointing, but as the beer warmed up a bit it began to redeem itself. Toward the end I was able to pick up on enough hop and balanced malt flavor to make me feel better about this beer. For IPA's I would not choose this over most, but I'm sure There's plenty of crappy IPA's that are far worse than this."
"Mouth: Enters the mouth with very light carbonation that flattens as it goes back. Has a slight sweetness to balance the nice bitter flavor and extremely hoppy swallow. Slightly grapy in flavor with no lasting bitterness. Overall, it's not a bad brew, it's got a great hop flavor but not enough depth or balance, and the weak mouthfeel ruins the experience."
"Sort of a dry mouthfeel. Not bad overall."
"Might be better reviewed as an APA, though."
"I had this on tap and in a bottle at a local bar...I asked the bartender to just place the two next to each other without my looking. I tried each and prefered the bottle. I have tried both before - and tried it on tap at other places. I thought it was my imagination, but the bottle is better. The tap isn't BAD, but lacks the fresh crispness that the bottle has."
"Alright, but not hoppy enough for an IPA to me. Goes down nice and easy though, probably a good end of the night beer. One thing worth mention is that this tastes like is should be more like 4.5-5% rather than 5.9%. A nice suprise."
"will try this one again."
"Cheers!"
"Poured a nice peachy-apricot golden color with a respectable head (which lasted about 2.5 minutes before noticeably subsiding). Pleasant enough aroma and taste, but neither were overwhelming (in good or bad ways). Hoppy, but indistinguishable as far as IPAs go. A crisp, refreshing choice for a hot summer day, but not a hop-head's dream come true. Still, there are less exciting IPAs out there, and you could do worse than Harpoon's staple."
"This is a great IPA. My only criticism is the hop bitterness is a little harsh and lacking in complexity and hop aromas are a little weak. Still, I can see why this is so ubiquitous in Boston, tastey stuff."
"Drinkable as hell. Thank you Nicholson's for the cask."
"you know what.. I might pick this up in the summer if I am not in the mood for a pils. It is easy drinking and just tasty enough for a nice summer afternoon. Of course at 6% maybe I won't suck them down all day but it's a nice change up from a prima pils or sunshine pils..."
"Overall, a nice session brew. This would go nice in a variety case and nice to share or drink a 6-er yourself."
"It seems like there are a lot of great IPAs and APAs down south."
"Refreshing but not all that exciting. A decent, pleasant session beer."
"Had a bottle at RFD in Washington DC. Served in a tapered tumbler, something that I thought wouldn't help this beer breath much. Average clear copper color, small head, clean hops in the nose and flavor. The hops bite is there, but I was not overwhelmed by any one aspect in this beer, but I couldn't say it was bad, it's just not elite. A good regional IPA"
"And maybe I'm prejudiced, because I can score this wonderful beer for $20.99 a case every day."
"I enjoyed this beer on tap and it had a light appearance with a foamy head that quickly dissipated. The aroma really wasn't anything special and was quite light with a slight aroma of hoppy bitterness and a little bit of malt. The taste wasn't overpowering and was crisp with a nice semi-bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel was about average and this beer wasn't too carbonated but seemed to be just right. I believe the drinkability was excellent as this beer had enough body to it to satisfy me, yet had a clean finish and begged for another round ;-) . Definately worth a try."
"This was my first real IPA that i ever had a few years ago so it does hold a special place in my heart. However I must say that the taste has been changing and there is no consistency from batch to batch, at least from my tasting. I went to the brewery around Dec and it was the best i ever had it. So around Feb i went back up and got another growler that was keged about 5 days before and it was nowhere near as good. Then I got a 12 pack and once again tasted different. I dont remember if the old Catamount brewery makes any of this or if they just do the 100 barrel but that might explain the change in taste. I would say try this beer to break into drinking other better beers."
"D: this is where this beer shines. As light as the body is and since it lacks heavy hoppyness and high alcohol, I could probally drink these all day if given the chance. A very good choice for a session beer."
"A little puckering, but in moderation it feels like a good old IPA. I know from experience that this is definitely not the IPA to over do it with. The hops and spiciness become very monotonous after more than say three bottles or glasses. I could enjoy these once in a while."
"The beer pours a weak golden color with a 2-finger head that falls fairly quickly to a finger over the brew. This one is very clear, and there is a modest carbonation working up. The aroma brings a nice caramel malt base with a mild peppery and slightly piny hop. Its not overly complex, but it smells pretty nice. The flavor is right on with the aroma. There is a pretty strong caramel sweetness that is interrupted by a solid pine and lighter citrus hop. The bitterness is a bit rough, but it fades pretty fast into the sweetness. I find the sweetness to be a little over the top and out of balance. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, this one is a easy drinking brew that could easily find its way into my fridge every so often. It would be a good change of pace to some of the standard IPAs we have around here. Not bad at all. I'll leave the values as they were before."
"Overall, I liked this beer. I'd definitely drink more of these!"
"Thanks to Bashiba for sharing this brew."
"Poured a coppertoned golden color from a 12oz bottle with a fizzy white one finger head that gave way to moderate white lacing. Aroma is rich of floral and citrus hops, hints of grapefruit also present, light maltiness finishes out the nose. Taste is primarily characterized by bitter floral/grassy hops almost balanced with some caramel malt flavors. Hops do not overpower in this brew, however, they are much stronger smelling than tasting. Mouthfeel is moderate to heavy carbonation, leaves a slight slick oily coating on the mouth and throat. Drinkability is high, lower abv and nice level of complexity coupled with the refreshment this IPA offers will keep me coming back, will purchase again."
"I think this beer would make a great session beer. It is not high in alcohol, so that wouldnt be a problem. Also, the flavor is not overbearing. I would drink this beer again, if it was available in So Cal."
"I realize my scores are kinda odd, with taste being average to good and drinkability being excellent, but the reason is because I know I can always get a six pack and have a few of them and be perfectly happy, especially on a nice warm day outside."
"Truly, 100% recommended. Great stuff. I usually only buy singles but this time I sprung for the six-pack and I don't regret it. Not one bit."
"This beer is, and always has been, one of my standbys. When fresh, it is one of the more drinkable IPAs on the market. It is not the most complex beer around, but the crisp bite of the hops is something I really enjoy. It is floral and delicate, but at the same time there is something zesty and lively about it that I really dig. I really enjoy throwing down 34 oz mugs of Harpoon IPA at Wickenden in Providence...it is that drinkable."
"Overall a drinkable IPA, but fairly average."
"Drinkability - I could drink this one all day....maybe i will."
"Drinkability - Definitely refreshing with layers of taste. I could handle one everyone once in a while when I'm relaxing on a hot day."
"I have been known to drink this in the summer down at the beach. I think it goes with that setting rather well. Much more so than Corona, in my opinion anyway."
"Poured a thin white head, leaving dots of lace. Coppery color with faded orange tints. Floral, orange scents come to the nose with hops present also. Good creamy hop element going on, citrusy and refreshing. Not a hop-wallop or anything, not even the most robust IPA ever, but definitely an enjoyable brew. One that shouldn't be turned down at a good price or if someone offers one to you. Thirst-quenching and hugely drinkable as a daily/session beer. One of the best everyday go-to beers around."
"Appears a golden color with a fluffy white head. It leaves spotted lacings all over the glass. The aroma is sweet and of a fruity origin. Taste is hoppy and flavorful. The taste is more intense in the finish and aftertaste than it is up front. Fruity, but not real citrusy like other ipa's. Bananas are present in the flavor as well. Overall, this tastes good, but I've had better ipa's. Mouthfeel is decent, and the drinkability is good. They go down easy and I dont think I'd get tired of drinking them all night."
"The beer pours a transparent golden-amber with a nice white head that leaves a thin white film all the way down the glass along with some lace. The smell is primarily hops that is characterized by a nice mixture of citrus (possibly grapefruit) and floral aromas. The taste also exhibits similar characteristics to the smell along with some delightful bitterness. The beer finishes with some sweet barley maltiness. The mouthfeel is characterized by a good thickness and carbonation. Overall this is a highly drinkable beer. I really enjoy the bitterness and believe I am begining to become more of a hophead."
"drinkability: gets better as it warms, and starts out pretty average."
"I had this recently on tap at the US Cyclocross Nationals in Providence, RI , in the heated tent...was actually going for a hot chocolate...had been standing outside for hours in cold windy weather...saw Harpoon on tap....decided on a cold beverage in stead... liked the tap much better...just seemed like more of everything going on in it. Good stuff."
"Drinkability: The big, complex hop flavor combined with light body and only moderate bitterness make this one of the few session IPAs I've ever had."
"Overall: A great IPA, this is one of my favorites. Definitely worth a shot if you're a fan of the style."
"Smooth crisp IPA feel. Bitter sweet hop finish."
"Light copper orange color, thin white head that fades quickly. Tiny bubbles of carbonation well after beer is poured. Light smell of floral hops on the nose. Taste is of light hops a bit perfumey with a slightly sweetened aftertaste. Very light and easy drinking. IMO, a basic run of the mill IPA, very average."
"This is a very nice IPA. I'm glad we're getting it in Florida."
"Anyway, I agree with the overall rating on this beer that it's worth a try. But that's about as far as it goes."
"In my book I like my IPAs much hoppier than this. Is this more of an English style IPA. An IPA at all?"
"Drinkability: A little less hoppy than some APAs but can drink quite a few of these"
"Not a big fan of IPAs, but hadn't had this in some time, and it seemed to go well with a game of pool. It was a nice medium yellow color with a good head and some lacing. It had a fresh, crisp odor and a nice hoppy taste, which got stronger after swallowing. Reminded me of summer."
"Drinkability: Walking the tightrope between and APA and an IPA, the Harpoon is an extremely well-balanced and drinkable beer"
"D - Very good. A sessionable IPA because it doesn't overpower the senses. It still has enough flavor to be enjoyed on it's own or with a meal."
"Cheers!"
"M & D: Mouthfeel is nice. It's a good beer that goes down smoothly. Seems to be one of those staple good beers that people bring to parties. Usually a fall back for me if there isn't anything else interesting at a bar. Definately a drinkable beer."
"This is an easy drinking IPA. These guys at Harpoon really know how to make a balanced beer. I had almost forgotten that there can be more than just hops in an IPA."
"Pours a nice clean, very translucent, pale copper color and makes a bit of a head that tries real hard to stick around but fades into a halo of white bubbles around the edge of my glass. Floral, earthy hop aroma and a hit of clean pale caramel malt. Clean crisp malt flavor, moderately bitter and strong sour citrus notes. Light in body with a crisp and peppery carbonated bite, finishes dry. This is a nice refreshing ale, though to me it feels more like a pale ale than an IPA. I would choose it over your typical pale ale, a solid drinkable brew."
"This beer poured a nicely. The head was full, frothy, and lightly fragant. The color was a clear, golden brown. The smell contained elements of citrus and light, fresh grains. The taste of hops in this IPA was very thin. However, it is still a very drinkable beer. I'll probably pick this up again."
"Wish i could find this on tap around here. Nice design and bottle cap. This poured a very nice golden color with a great frothy head. Fairly sticky. Aroma is earthy, hint o metallicness but not bad at all, hoppy. The taste is very nice, citric and pleasant. Nice and bitey but malts save the day. Very good balance. Some roasty flavors in there are very nice. Moderate body but crisp creamy. VERY drinkable! Seems like it would be a good entry level beer for bud or other shit addicts. Very pleasant session brew."
"This beer poured out a very slightly cloudy light amber color. It has a slight head. The smell is pretty good. It smells of hops. The taste is of hops with slight notes of spice bitterness. The mouthfeel is fairly good. Not much negativity to speak of. It does have a slight bite to it but not enought to affect drinkability. Overall, a decent beer. Probably mid range as far as IPA's go."
"Copper almost a brass color. Sticky inch and a half head that leaves a sticky lace on the glass. Floral aromas in the nose. Reminds me of spring as the leaves green and flowers bloom. Not a very hoppy IPA but very good and balanced. Bready malty tasting at first, with some citrus in the middle and some hop bitterness on the back end. Mouthfeel is fair, kinda sticky. Overall a very drinkable IPA. Good introduction IPA and good to throw down a few."
"Smells light and sweet, and slightly citrusy. Not great, hard to get a whiff of, but okay. Tastes hoppy, malty, bready at the end- again, not wonderfully amazing, but easy, tasty enough, and okay. Mouthfeel is a bit soapy, but not in a horrid way. Frothy, slightly slick, dry at the end. Very drinkable- a decent, good IPA, I just wish it was more hoppy, with more depth. Still, you can always find a few in my fridge. Great bang for your buck."
"I would order this anytime. As IPA's go, it's on the slighter side now, but it's very well made, clean, refreshing, hoppy, fruity, and delicious. Recommended."
"Drinkability/Notes  I have a soft spot for my first (and a hometown) IPA, Im a big fan. Great for a first timer or a more developed palate. Very drinkable, tough to have just one."
"D-I find this to be the quintessential drinking IPA. It's not too pronounced in any of the areas that some IPA's are prone to. A consistent performer."
"This pours a light amber with a nice two finger creamy tannish head.Say what you want, Harpoon beers look good.The smell is a little light with some floral and yeast scents,but not any hops.The taste is light and weak.In an IPA I would expect some hops,but this beer is very much like a lager with no hops.This doesn't taste bad,but it's not whats advertised.The m/f is light,but full flavored.This would be a good session beer,but for an IPA it's weak."
"To be honest, I'm just not a fan. I don't think I can exactly pinpoint what it is, but this beer just seems to be too acidic for me. It has a helluva bite, without much reward. It's like breeding pit-bulls without keeping one to protect the house. I looove hops, but this is just plain bitter - not in the good way. There just isn't anything to balance out this brew. I get very little flavors other than hop bitterness. Perhaps a little bit of lemon. Anyway, maybe I'll give it a try in the bottle since the brothers seem to think it is better that way."
" A big burst of hop flavor that tapers off into a bitter sheen and a dryness on the roof of my mouth. Pretty good stuff if you like hops. This is a beer with some personality and I can definitely drink these when drinking needs to be done. Among my favorite American Indian Pales me thinks."
"This brew had a orange-yellow color that poured an OK head that disipated quickly and left minimal lacing. Nose is of floral hops, malts,and a hint of fruit as well. Taste is a nice combonation of hops with a hint of sweet malts. Mouthfeel was decently full and OK carbonation. Overall drinkability is good. This is a nice beer that representative of the style."
"Yeah, I will get this again. It would be nice during football. However there are several other pale ales/ipas that I can also choose that have more notes that I would favor. Beer is good."
"Drinkability: Very light and drinkable, though not my favorite American IPA."
"Overall, this is a good IPA and is heartily recommended."
"Drinkability: This gets two thumbs up. A fantastic beer that is a great representative of the style. These go down easy and are completely enjoyable."
"Lighter refreshing body, and pretty drinkable, but completely lackluster."
"I first had this when it was a seasonal. It was also the first ""smaller"" brewery offering I ever tasted. The hop flavor though mild now in comparison to some of the IPA's was such an eye opener it just blew me away. Never thought I'd see it again living in FLA., but found it on tap about 15 minutes from my house. Still a pretty good lil ale, but in comparison to DFH 60min or Hazed and Infused (all on tap at the same place) it seems a lil mild. Still, I manage to have a pint or two! This may be a good offering for folks that normally drink macros as it has significantly more flavor but probably won't blow their heads off..."
"Good for the style and a good brew."
"ahhh the Harpoon IPA... I distinctly remember this as the first Indian Pale Ale I have ever tried. This beer alone catapulted me into the world of IPAs and amber ales that I enjoy today. From the second I removed the cap of this Ale I was immediately filled with a sensation of a beautiful spring day. The floral scents of this ale are awe inspiring, but not overdone. As I poured the beer into the only available pint glass left in the kitchen (beer was stored refrigerated and had a shelf life of less than one week) I was pleasantly surprised with the golden amber color and a nice thick head that stays around for a couple minutes but doesn't leave a lace like most macro beers do and can only compare to craft beers. The aroma of hops complemented the wonderful color of this beer and the taste was nothing short of climatic. The mouthfeel for a beer of this nature was extraordinary... by far the first beer that I was really able to sit down and enjoy. Since then I have tried the IPA with a barrage of foods and find Italian and Cajun cuisine complement the taste of this beer very well. I highly recommend this beer to anyone interested in the field of American IPAs."
"I usually try and bring a twelve pack on the plane back to Chicago when I travel out east."
"overall- Harpoon is the kind of beer that isn't anything truly special but will always be around as someone close to boston. i consider it the gateway to IPAs. when u start expanding your taste it is probably a good choice to figure out what IPAs are all about. The old stand-by."
"Much better on tap than in the bottle. Looks more creamy with more body, active carbonation, and clarity. Smells pine-ey, hoppy, mildly sweet, and very citrusy. Tastes much more citrusy than through the bottle. More crisp and refreshing. Just more alive. Mouthfeel is a good blend of bubbly and creamy. Crisp and mildly dry in the finish. Less metalic, tin-ey, and thin than the bottle. This suddenly became a good beer. I recommend this beer--but only on tap."
"Golden amber, very clear, big white head, nice lacing. Smell is pine and citrus hops, crystal caramel malt, honey sweetness. Taste is piney, some light malt flavour, citrus near the end, clean bitter finish. Lighter bodied, medium carbonation, smooth and refreshing, tasty IPA."
"That being said, it's still a good beer, I still got a little hop-burping in -- and I'll certainly never turn down a pint of Harpoon IPA."
"Pours a very light colored amber with a bubbly white head. Slightly orange looking. Smells a little bubble-gummish. Tastes quite malty with little hop presence. Finish is cirtusy (grapefruit). Why is this an IPA? Malt character pretty much overpowers the hops. This is a decent tasting beer, but not what I expected. If you want a nice IPA, try a Founder's. If you want an entry level IPA, try this guy."
"One I've had and seen quite a bit, but never took the time to review. Sadly, this IPA is a product of the past before bigger meant better. It's not a bad beer, but it can't hold a candle to the new wave of American IPAs out there. Medium body of reddish brown, with syrupy scents of caramel and biscuit. Hopfeel is minimal for an IPA, but still adds a soft bitterness to the finish and some nondescript coniferous notes to the middle. I'd take it over a macro any day and when I see it on tap I typically buy it, but I can easily think of 2 dozen IPAs I'd have before this. The classy label adds to the bottle's appearance."
"Overall-by no means bad, simply ok though, unbalanced and mediocre, and from a brewery this loved, dissapointing."
" This tastes pretty good. I would say that the flavor is leaning slightly toward the hop end of the scale, but not by much. This might be a good way to introduce someone to craft beer. The mouthfeel is smooth, despite the moderate carbonation. The drinkability is good, although I wouldn't have too many since I prefer beers that smack me upside my head with flavor."
"very drinkable ipa, and great session beer (if slighly higher in ABV than a standard session beer)."
"Beer courtesy of ski271. Thanks again!"
"Overall: A great IPA. The citrus hops really continue throughout the taste. Always feel confident with this IPA, an old stand-by (if I can find it)."
"Purchased as part of sampler pack. Poured a clear golden color with a nice white head. Smell is loaded with hops. Taste leaves a nice dry hop bitterness that is pleasantly enjoyable. Finishes dry and bitter with the feeling of wanting more. Another good beer from Harpoon."
"The mouth feel is surprisingly light for an IPA and is nice and refreshing. Its nothing amazing, but much better than I was expecting. Its worth a try."
"Drinkability: A very good IPA. Tasty and refreshing."
"Finally got to try it during a recent trip to Boston and it was as good as expected. Colour was a dark yellow with a nice foamy head with good retention and some lacing on the glass. Very drinkable and refreshing. It would definitely be one of my regular IPA's if I could buy it down here."
"This is a good IPA."
"Harpoon IPA is the light in the darkness when at a new bar with a (mostly) poor beer selection. It can always be found in my fridge or cooler on a camping trip. It's so easy to drink and full of flavor I can't see why anyone would want another session beer."
"[Another brew from the ""Midwest Beer Barge"" trade with TikkiGodxxx - a great opportunity to sample some fine beer that doesn't normally make it to the Left Coast]"
"Body is light to medium with a grainy dry mouthfeel. It's not bad for budget sessioning, but I think it used to taste better 10 years ago. Perhaps my tastes have just changed too."
"A great IPA to start with is Harpoons The Harpoon brewery makes great brews, but their IPA may be the most accessible of any variety. The beer pours up a dark gold/copper color with a thick, white head of foam, leaving lace on the glass as the contents are drunk. The aroma offered is wheat or sweet hay with some hints of fruit (spicy orange). The taste is moderately bitter, not as hoppy as many IPAs out there, but the beer has a great deal of carbonation, balancing out the bitterness, making the beer extremely smooth and very drinkable. Unlike some aggressively-hopped beers, you can drink many Harpoons IPA without getting overwhelmed or turned off by the taste of repeated bottles. A very refreshing beer for the summer days. Enjoy the brews. Cheers"
"Drinkability was so-so. Overall, a decent, but not great IPA."
"Fairly crisp and drinkable with a medium-bodied mouthfeel. This is just a solid, decent IPA."
"Sweet taste lingers, then dries out quickly. Very drinkable beer."
"This was a very nice beer and I look forward to taking another trip to Boston to partake of this beer again."
"reviewed 01-05-05 and transcribed from notes. Pours a deep hazy gold to copper color. Small head is accompanied by a small carbonation level. Nose is cloying with malt sweetness and has a hint of hops. Flavor is big malty and overly sweet. The flavor does dry up nice and quick. Aftertaste starts off with malt but then hops take over and dominate."
"My number one beer. Of all the beers I try and drink this is the one that is always in my fridge. Pours are dark gold with decent head retention, Not over hoppy for an IPA but the hops are present enough to be my go to beer. I'm glad its local and ready for me."
"Overall...seems kind of like a dumbed-down IPA to me, but that's cool. I need more beers that I can just drink and not have to think about the massive amount of flavors involved in them. This is a very straight forward session beer, and it's damn good for what it is. This along with the Hot Shot ESB from Great Divide are both mainstays in my fridge for when I don't feel like drinking anything too crazy."
"12oz bottle. Decent white head with some lacing left on the side of the glass. Just the right amount of carbonation. Floral, grapefruit, and pine on the nose. Really nice piney scent from the hops. The taste is where this beer really comes through. Very smooth and well balanced with a perfect amount of bitterness for an IPA. There is some room for improvement here, but I couldnt tell you where. Very good, one I will buy again."
"The mouthfeel was somewhat thick with nice low carbonation. It is an easy drinker and may be a decent session type beer. Would be easy to pair with food."
"I used to really love this beer, but I feel as if its lost some of its hoppiness, or maybe its just my taste buds have changed over the years. Served on tap into a large pint glass. Pretty good head. Somewhat floral, hoppy aroma. Taste is smooth, hoppy, but not that hoppy and not all that complex. I'd actually push this one down into the pale ale category. Has a slightly creamy mouthfeel, very drinkable, refreshing. A good beer, but in the middle of the IPA pack."
"A pretty average tasting IPA. It does have a refreshing mouthfeel and high drinkability and I do like a few of the more subtle flavors. Recommended although not strongly."
"The first whiff was awesome. It had a real funky grassy hop aroma that was unfortunately difficult to detect after the first few sips. Bright off-white head poured fairly thick, and faded slowly leaving some thick strings of lace as it faded to a quarter inch thick film. Transparent pale copper colored beer with clouds of fine bubbles shooting up from one corner. Mild floral hop flavor up front over top of a light malt base. There's a candied hop bitterness that lingers in towards the end, and balances everything out. Finish is pretty clean, and burps taste of hops (yum!). Moderately light body and solid hoppiness help this one down. A solid fresh hoppy beer."
"The beer pours into a pint glass with a smallish pearl white head and a pale yellow color thats slightly on the light side for an IPA. Leaves nice white lacing down the glass. The smell is a floral bouqet of hops, with a citrusy note as well, spot on for an IPA. The taste is pretty much dominated by the hops with a slight maltiness, but this is not so bitter as to turn away non Hop heads. You can detect many complex hops tastes with a floral, citrusy, and slightly resiny hop oil coating your mouth thats interrupted slightly by a caramel malt taste then quickly finishes with a light hop bitterness. This is really a fantastic IPA, that could be drunk for hours and in im opinion would be a good beer to convert someone to the glory of hops, as it is not so bitter as to turn people off but bitter enought to keep the hopheads interested"
"Drinkability/notes: Although it is not one of my favored styles, this is a very good IPA, certainly worth a try. Thanks to HardTarget for sharing this."
"Suprising find at my local beer store. About a cross between a Sam Adams and a really good IPA. The smell is there, nice appearance and lacing. It seems like a good IPA spiked with water. Bitter enough for the style, but just too thin. You could blast through a few of these with no problem. Maybe a good gateway IPA, but I'm way beyond the gateway at this point. Followed by a Titan and an Indiga, both of which really blew it away."
"I've been drinking a lot of these lately because, well it's very drinkable and I guess they are just getting it out there and it has been on special at the last few bars I've been to."
"Pours a hazy golden amber with a thin white head. Pleasant spicy, citrusy hop aroma but I was expecting more from an IPA. Taste is a bit of a letdown also, hops do not dominate as they should in an IPA. A decent, easy drinking beer, but there are better choices out there."
"Light amber brew served with a short, white head that stuck all over the glass for ages. Smelled of citrus and pine with a little bit of malt hiding in the background. The moderate carbonation complemented the significant, but not overpowering, citric hoppiness, which was balanced by a not-insignificant malt sweetness. While the hops were a big part of the flavor, I didn't find that they were significantly bitter, which makes this beer very easy to drink, although the 5.9%abv limits this a bit. The overall impression is smooth and crisp. A short, dry finish rounds off a solid American IPA that is a go-to in Boston-area bars."
"Overall Impression: A refreshing IPA with low bittering flavors. If it were a tad more local I could see making it a regular beer. Drinkability really helps the score."
"Generally this IPA is pretty average and, frankly, a little boring."
"This AIPA pours dark golden amber, with a slight haze. non descript white head, and just a smattering of lacing. laid back grainy hops in the nose. Can't say I'm overwhelmed by this IPA, hop crunch is quite subdued. Sort of a mushy feel to the center and body of this brew. Finish is equally mundane. C'mon Harpoon , I feel like this one has been sliding downwards the past few years, not the punchy and flavorful IPA I remember."
"Medium-light mouthfeel. Great drinkability as this one isn't hop overkill like so many others from this style."
"Drinkability: This is a very refreshing and easy-drinking beer. Its not as bold as I would expect an Am. IPA to be, but it good enough to make me really wish I had more than one bottle."
"I like all different styles of beer, and often treat myself to more exotic potions depending on the season, but this IPA is great anytime of the year, regardless of temperature or occassion."
"Pours a hazy orange color. Has a good sized white head that sticks nicely to the glass. Smells hoppy, some fruit and earthy aroma. Taste hoppy up front. Very fuity, balanced with a biscuit powdery malt. Medium mouthfeel with a semi-dry hoppy finish. I have always enjoyed this beer, never dissapoints."
"12 oz., bottled on 12/23/04, served chilled in a pint glass. Pours an amber/orange color with an off-white 1 finger head that reduces to a thin blanket and leaves a few rings. Smell is of sweet malts with grapefruit/floral/spicy hops. Fairly smooth with more sweet malts on the palate than I usually find in IPAs, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The grapefruit/floral hops complement this and leave a decent bitterness. Well balanced, but I think it could still use an extra shot of hops."
"Very easy to drink and a nice alternative to the other stagnant beers this establishment tends to throw your way. I can easily have a few of these at one sitting and not get tired of them. A solid, all around, fairly average but enjoyable IPA, IMO."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" off-white head above the dark golden/light amber brew. Head is pillowy and a bit uneven as it fades slightly, with nice lacing. Aroma is leafy hops, with underpinnings of sweet pale maltiness. Taste is upfront with a shot of hops, giving way to smooth malts, and closes up shop with a revisit of the hops. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent as well. Nice one from Harpoon."
"A clean dark yellow beer. Has a big bright white foamy head and some good lace. The aroma has a sweet citrusy, sharp hop character with a hint of malt in the background. The taste starts with a sweet citrusy tease followed by a blast of hops bitterness and has a nice refreshing clean hop finish."
"Very nice."
"The taste profile is fairly mellow. Mildly citric and modestly bitter without any intention of crossing over into bold territory. It is completely unoffensive and quite drinkable, but lacks the full character that this style can display. A little uninspiring in terms of the style."
"Drinkability: Overall, a pretty good pint and not bad for a session. I had the opportunity to sample it a couple times over several days and my impressions didn't really change."
"I definitely could drink more than one of these in one sitting. It's a very enjoyable beer, and it would probably go well as a ""session beer."" If you haven't had this yet, I definitely recommend it."
"For someone who is not the biggest fan of American IPAs, I absolutely loved this one. Persoanlly, Harpoon IPA or the Cottonwood Endo are the best of its style I've tried so far. Poured a nice amber colored hue that filled the glass with much carbonation and head rentention. Sparkled in the mouth and the hops was not overbearing. Will definitely try this again."
"Reflection: Not as hoppy as I like my IPA's but as a pale ale this would be great. With the good flavor and nothing over the top this would make a great session beer."
"Notes: Well balanced and not over the top. I like the fact that this beer is not west coast, over-hopped, craziness."
"Pours an orangish amber color with a moderate head that fades quickly. I don't know what they use for a yeast in this beer, but it has a strong Ringwood flavor to me. Hints of butterscotch. For an IPA, it's rather lacking in hoppiness. The hops get lost in the maltiness of this beer. An okay beer that I could drink 1 or 2 of in an evening but that would be it. Tastes more like an English pale ale to me than an IPA."
"Drinkability  It would be hard to keep drinking this all night. Although I live out West I can still appreciate a good East Coast IPA, but this just isnt it."
"I've had this beer from tap and from the bottle. In both this beer is fantastic. Very hopy with no other flavors to get in the way. A really perfect IPA. It has a nice color, slightly dark and reddish brown. It is very drinkable and you don't get tired of it. Its good till the end, like all good IPA's should be. Luckily this beer is very popular in boston, and i hope if i ever move it is popular where i live."
"This beer pours a flourescent orange color with a medium bright white head. Lots of bubbles rush to the top. The scent was restrained at first but I picked up more notes the further I went along. There seems to be a real strong floral pungency in here along with citrus notes from what appeared to be dry hopping, but im not sure about that. The taste was a bit restrained. There was no real dominating flavor but a big mix of estery hops, caramel malt, and a grainlike huskiness around the edges. The body was a bit thin and that hurt this beer a little. All in all a decent but underwhelming beer, not really an ipa but not subtle enough to be a good pale ale."
"This should be the official beer of Boston. A perfect combo of big American IPAs and British pale ales. One of the best Boston session beers ever."
"There is plenty of taste in this beer. It leans toward the malty side and I'm sure would be better with more hops taste and aroma. Still, I liked it and I'll buy more."
"Drinkability - a good quaffer, not in the upper echelon but an easy and satisfying choice."
"I always try to get my wife to try IPA's because it's one style I can't seem to convert her to. Usually she makes a face and says it's too bitter. When I offered her te Harpoon her response was ""Nothing great but I could actually drink this IPA."" Enough said about the hop profile."
"IPA? I know more APA's with more hops than this beer. Unless they want to appeal to the macro drinkers, I would consider this a light IPA. Goodness, go grab a HopDevil and see how it's done correctly."
"gold color with nice, foamy head. Head has a bitter bite but has good legs. Their is a spicy, hop aroma. Their is a light malt taste with hop bitterness and a slight lemony aftertaste. The body is light/thin, could use more malt to balance this brew."
"Drinkability: When I want a good plain ol' IPA, this is the one I reach for. It's a fine session beer as well."
"Had this at a number of places on tap while visiting Boston. It was the only thing worth drinking at both hotels I stayed in. It was a cool amber color with a small frothy head that held througout the drink. Had a hoppy, floral smell. Tasted pretty much the same. Not too bitter, sweet malt flavor too. Crisp, fresh mouthfeel. Very drinkable. I would recommend this one on."
"This beer is an old staple. Pretty standard for an American IPA, but reliable and damn good. Appears a little bubbly actually, but there's a nice frothy head present that leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Smells of citrus and piney hops, typical for an IPA of course. Tastes great to me, just what I would expect from Harpoon. Lots of hop flavor, less malt, and with a little bitter kick towards the end. Smooth mouthfeel, although a little fizzy, but generally impressive. This is a solid beer great for pretty much any occasion, such as watching the Sox game, which I am going to go do now."
"White head capping a golden body with a constant stream of bubbles. Great fruity hop aroma with only a hint of malt. Flavor is a bit weak, but nice. Weak mouthfeel, boring but drinkable. As with the Harpoon beers I've tried its a nice, drinkable beer but a bit more bland than I prefer."
"your basic, run of the mill east coast ipa. it pours a nondescript crisp amber colour with a fairly thin head. the smell is much more sweet than i remember it, actually dominating the hop and bread notes at times. floral notes are scattered throghout as well. as for the flavour, the hop and malt balance is nicely combined with the floral and sweet notes picked up in the nose, however, everything is pretty bland overall here. i remember this brew being much hoppier years ago. now it seems as if it's produced more for the masses. it's easy drinking and it's nice to know that you're likely to find it at any bar in greater boston (even the dumpiest of dives, most likely). this is certainly still a good beer all around but, like most harpoon offerings, seems to have peaked a while ago. crank it up on all accounts, i say."
"Beautiful medium gold with a nice fluffy white head. Lovely hop aromas abound. Sweet malt lends a good depth to the nose. Hops lend great flavor to the palate and the malt is quite noticable. Not as hoppy as I was hoping for, but a nice ""East Coast"" IPA. Nice mouthfeel. Sweetness give some viscosity and a coating effect. A delightful IPA. Flavorful, balanced and well made. I like this and was glad to get to try it. Can't wait to try again. Look for this one."
"I was fairly excited to see that one of my favorite local watering holes had this on tap, so after a quick pint of Celebration I decided to go for a Harpoon IPA. I have no doubts that drinking this right after a Celebration made my expectations of this IPA unreasonably high. It pours an amber color with a 1 finger head that made itself present for about 8 ounces. Nose is rather muted when compared to the celbrations. Some floral hops are present as is some malty sweetness. Taste wasn't the hop attack that I was expecting. This was rather clean and balanced with a caramelish malt background keeping the hops in their place. Nice medium body to this one too. Definately a decent beer, but it'll be hard for me to choose this of an Alpha King or Celebration when all 3 are side by side."
"On the palate it is straightforward, offering toffee-flavored malt impressions along with scorched stone fruits, dry honey flavors and herb oils. It's hard to understand the very pale, yellow color in light of the impact on the palate. The finish is medium in length and balanced. Solid effort."
"Drinkability is DANGEROUS !! Easy to get carried away and have too many of these."
"I definately will not be buying this again."
"Pours a nice cloudy amber-copper hue under a slightly off-white one finger head that settles pretty quickly but leaves a bit of lace. Marvellous flowery nose, balanced by some barley but clearly hops are the main attraction. The mouth is prickly, yet smooth, with a heaviness to the texture that coats the mouth and tongue almost like thin syrup. There's definitely a sweet malt backbone here which does a good job of supporting the hops, which are present from the beginning. Definitely not a super-hopped brew, the flowery sweet and crisp bitter nevertheless determine the flavor experience. A deeper bite emerges briefly in the aftertaste, but the flowers linger remarkably long. There's no impression of espresso here - it's more like perfume. Nice."
"Light copper color with a decent long lasting head. Aroma was lightly hopped. Taste was dominated with hops with just enough malt to make it enjoyable. Body was light for the style but you could drink a number of these on a hot afternoon. Very refreshing and flavorful."
"A very drinkable IPA, not too hoppy for the style."
"Nice brew but not more than a crisp hoppy brew. A little one dimensional but tasty and smooth make it a good beer to have with some friends."
"Being from the area, I can't believe I haven't reviewed at least one of Harpoon's offerings before! A fine American IPA. A gloriously golden pour with moderate pure white head. Carbonation makes a nice visual effect in this clear beer. Smell is crisp and hoppy. Taste is sweet and fairly bitter. Refreshing on a real hot day like today. A good choice if in need of an IPA."
"This is truly one of my staple beers, either in a restaurant/bar or as a 6 or 12 pack. The majority of the time I get this IPA fresh and I'm always pleased. Probably my favorite consistent product from Harpoon."
"Upon pouring, it had a nice golden amber color and a good head. The smell was typical for the IPAs I've had, smelling hoppy and malty. The taste didn't have as much bite as I expected and the malt mellowed it out a bit. A bit of spiciness, though, added just enough tingle with the carbonation. I wasn't done with the first one before I was ready for the next one. I can't wait to get back to New England for some more."
"Well made IPA- definitely skewed towards the hops- clean and straightforward."
"Drinkability: Well, as far as IPAs go, the lamb of drinkability must be sacrificed to the Gods of hops. I can't beleive I just wrote that. In Harpoon's take, this is not so. The clean-ness is a plus in this category."
"Tawny gold in hue, lighter in color for an IPA, minimal animation, largely clear in appearance. A white head of one finger in height topped the beer. The head retention was fair, after a moment it slid to a loose cap. The subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling well. The nose is very lovely, the hoppiness is apparent. But the fruity aromas really take this beer to the next level. Oranges, peaches, a trace of lemon zest, and some wild berries construct the marmalade fruitiness. The hops add some straight acidic notes. Overall the potency of the bouquet is solid and I find the total package to be inviting. The palate is very good; it is an East Coast IPA all the way. That is not a negative comment. The bitterness is moderate but fairly pronounced. The acidity is modest but the hops are pleasantly juicy. In the middle the fruitiness really sings, oranges and peaches mainly, a hint of grapes. That is a wonderful combination of fruit; now add in the hops yum. The maltiness is a tickle weak IMO, it doesnt really add much aside from a hint of caramel. Regardless the other aspects of this beer are very positive. Medium in body, somewhat low carbonation, it is natural and pleasing. The mouthfeel is good. I could drink this beer routinely, if it was available to me locally of course. It is simply lovely stuff. Thank you drweizen for including this in BIF 5!"
"The taste was of sharp, tangy, bitter hops with touches of citrus. Again, it tasted like pure Cascade to me. Quite delightful."
"This draft ipa was served in a Harpoon glass with little head, and no room for one. What was there added a bit of lace to the glass, as I consumed the rose-tinted gold ale. The pungent casacade hop aroma is a fair advertisement for the initial grapefruit/sour flavors. As the beer warms, or it kills whatever taste buds were repulsed by the unbalanced and rather predictable hop assault some more interesting tea-like flavors emerge to compliment an understated malt body. Its a passable IPA, but nothing that Id pursue."
"At first I'm loving it, but it has no balance or other dimension and gets boring after a while. By the time I get to the end, I'm ready to move on to something else."
"Deep amber color, not much of a head but good lacing regardless. Spicy hop aroma, hoppy orange flavor, nice but not very special. Tingly mouthfeel, finish is clean and a bit dry. Good and refreshing, more hoppiness would be nice though. Makes a good $6.99 6pk special at the corner deli."
"Swiggable IPA, but lacked a little flavor. A bit on the middle of the road side."
"This one pours a very pale orange color with a one finger white head. There is an ample amount of lace that clings throughout the glass. The aroma is citrusy and the hops waft up into the nostrils in abundance. The taste is, of couse, hop topped and citrusy as well. This is a good IPA in my opinion. It has the extra hops, but not so it knocks you over."
"I enjoyed this brew. In fact. I was with some fairly mainstream drinkers at a work function and we started talking about hops- I let them sniff my empty glass and most of them realized they had never experienced that in a beer before. Better yet, several ordered an IPA for their next round! There is hope."
"This IPA pours lighter than most--a rich, clear golden tint topped off by a medium thick white head. The hops are delightfully abundant to the nose, complemented by a complex floral arrangement. The taste and mouthfeel were both lighter than the usual for this style. The hops are not as dominant in the taste as in the smell, and the citrus moves more into the forefront. A good, light, and smooth IPA for a warm evening--I could have a number of these."
"Came from the tap dark golden with a nice light aroma and light hoppiness in the scent. Very light head retention, left with a very thin coating... heavy lacing. There is light bitterness and decent flavor. Very drinkable brew, a nice all-season kind of a beer."
"Great potential for a session beer"
"A decent pale ale, but hardly an IPA. Decent, easy to drink, but nothing stellar."
"overall, a good beer. the bitter taste would ward me off from drinking a bunch of these in one session"
"A clear, lightly golden brew with little to no head. Aroma is really pleasant with faint caramel, floral hops, & a touch of fruit. Initial tastes are sweet malt & caramel. Hop flavor comes in nicely to balance this brew out & provide a lingering bitterness. The beer is enjoyable, but does not have the hop punch I was really hoping for. That said, it is very drinkable & a good introduction to the style."
"nice looking amber ale with decent white head. fresh flowery hops define the smell. the taste starts with flowery citrus hops up front with slight toasted caramel malt background. medium bodied with good carbonation and a clean finish. not bad at all, but on tap this is significantly better."
"Overall, not bad for the $5 I paid, but after this sixpack is gone, it won't be returning to my beer stash."
"Prickly, citric hops. The malt portion of the aroma is limited to a light cracker-like breadiness. Hop dominated flavor. While the bitterness isn't overwhelming, the lack of malt really helps to bring forth the hop flavor. Very citric and crisp but there's nothing here to keep this from being too one-dimensional in a not entirely pleasant way."
"Ehh. This is the standard IPA. A bit too bitter, even for the style. Not balanced by many hop flavors. Where's the aroma hops? I'm not very familiar with the brewery, but this was a diappointment. I will not try it again."
"This is a good all around IPA. It's not big in any one category but drinkable and flavorful. Smell is unmistakenly hops, cannot go wrong there. Taste is a hoppy , citrusy flavor with a dry finish. Well balanced but without a strong malt backbone like with the hop devil. this is probably more of a session ipa than many others. I like this a lot."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thin white lace head. The aroma is good. It has a nice light maltiness to it along with a mild addition of citrousy aroma hops. It seems to be a bit dry and refreshing. The taste is good. It has a nice pale malt core along with a super bitter hop bite. It goes down smooth and finishes dry. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine IPA. It is a bitter tasting brew with a nice hop aroma."
"One of the beers that I keep coming back to, due to my affinity for IPA's and it's reasonable price. Very hoppy, as an IPA should be. Somewhat on the bitter side, yet goes down smooth. The taste is a little sweet and a little malty. Head is a little on the thin side, but it's there none-the-less. Goes well with a good steak or hamburger."
"Overall- a delicious IPA comparable to a SN pale Ale. Harpoon IPA is a definite purchase!"
"From the tap into a bright and rich amber color, with a thin head resulting in a decent lacing. Subtle smells of hops, almost imaginary. Full body for the style, tastes fairly standard. Seems to have just enough hops to qualify and impart the proper bitterness, but there just isn't enough mouth action for what I expect from an IPA. Could stand to use more hops or something to cause that nice tingly sensation. Not too much character here, but surprisingly clean in the end. Mostly par for the course, but good drinkability because of it."
"Poured amber/gold with a white head. Sharp bitter hops in the aroma, a bit of fruitiness. Decent mouthful, taste is a nice hop/malt balance. Good bitterness in the finish. Not sure I'd call this an IPA, but it was certainly a tasty beer. Went down quite nicely. Would make a nice session brew. Nice and fresh from the tap, I'm interested in seeing if the bottle version holds up."
"-Oelergud"
"What says Boston better than a Harpoon? I had to send my first pint back because the bartender put a lemon in it.Never understood that. It is a light amber in color with a quick receding head and ever-so-slight lace. Not as bitter as most IPA's, the hop flavor is slightly stronger than most IPA's instead. This beer helped me get through college, so I may be a bit one-sided."
"Edit>>Since trying this beer for the first time about 4 months ago, I have grown a fondness for this beer and consider it - if not the best - one of my favorite IPA's. Available almost anywhere on-tap in the Boston area, I usually find myself drinking one of these at some point throughout the night. Excellent beer that I have most certainly grown to love."
"Original review: 11/01/02: A fine IPA and one of the most balanced IPA's I've tried. While hoppy, it doesn't have that one-sided hoppiness of most IPA's. It has a nice balance to it that lets the malt shine through as well. I swear I detected the taste of cloves, similar to a hefeweizen, which only added to my enjoyment. A fine beer. I wish it were distributed here in the Midwest."
"Deep amber and smelling of hops when poured, it's been quite some time since I last had ANY Harpoon. I'm glad to have this opportunity once again. Hops dominated the aroma but subtle undertones of lemon came through. Nice tangy bite when drank. Smoothed out to a nice small molasses finish. This is a really good IPA, above average. The hops and malt play very well together in this."
"A classic American IPA that pours a deep golden or copper color with a large white head. Lacing is minimal, however. The aroma is predominantly citrusy hops with a malty undertone. The taste is classic hops with citrusy tinge, a nice hoppy bitterness, smooth carbonation, and a slight alcohol hit at the end. It has a crisp, moderate body. This is a real drinkable beer from the beginning to the end and through several more. There are hoppier ales that I like more but this is one is above average."
"The flavor of this beer was very smooth flavored IPA - strangely smooth. The bitters were there -but there was no bite!!! IPAs should bite you... especially when the waitress recommends it to you when they are out of Dogfish Head 90 min IPAs!"
"Easily accessable in the New England area and beyond and reasonalbly priced for such a well crafted beer. Tastes best out of a growler fresh from the brewery in Boston, Massachusetts."
"Definitely a nice brew and a quality IPA."
"Pale clear golden color with off white head that crowned to about two inches tall. Floral hop aroma is gentle yet strong. Delicate pine resin hoppyness with an assertive spicy bitterness. Hints of butterscotch and grapefruit on the palette back the hops up nicely. Medium to thin creamy body. Very drinkable. Dont worry about what you might have read about this beer on some other site, this is a pretty good IPA."
"This was a very solid and enjoyable IPA. Poured a cloudy orange with a wispy off white head -- Nice lacing sticking to the side of the glass. The smell was of Hops and citrus fruit. The taste was lighter than I expected and not too bitter but the fruit taste was very well balanced and not as obtrusive as some other IPA's I've had. There was not much of a malt backbone, but overall I welcomed the lighter side of this IPA. Very enjoyable, spring time drink with a decent ABV and very drinkable. I believe I can find this brew in most stores on the East Coast so this will be added to the list as a nice, quick ""on the road"" brew."
"The feel was very good with nice clean crispness in the ending. Overall this is a nicely drinkable American-style IPA."
"The big plus of the beer is its really good malt profile. This made this an exceptional beer. I've purposely not read the other reviews, and I assume most will say not enough hops. This is hoppy. But definitely could use more hops as an IPA. Very good though. You can find this all around town, which is a nice thing to say about Boston."
"Overall: a very good beer of the style. I think this is what I expected the Sweetwater IPA to be like when I reviewed it last week. I will definitely drink this again."
"The beer could be more bitter and have a more pronounced hop character."
"Clear dark gold color, a little lighter than many IPAs. Head is steamed milk frothy, over 1/4 of an inch with lasting properties. Laces in big dripping blobs. Nice grapefruit pith aroma, not overdone but solid for style. Body is slightly thinnish, malt has a hard time generating a presence before a slightly oily bittering kicks in. Hops start well, but not as big as many, and are helped by the aroma qualities. The finishing aspects are slightly metallic and the mouthfeel turns a little watery at the same time. Not bad, at least its not one of those hop cartoons IPA that are flooding the market. Malt and finish could be better. Thanks to Liza P. and her dad for getting it, and Ken K. for bringing it back."
"The taste was hoppy, yet well balanced with caramel malt. Not bad, but not great. There are much better IPA's out there. It was smooth and I will drink it again. I just liked it better on tap."
"Overall, this is a good IPA with plenty of hop flavor."
"On draught at Lazy Chameleon. Pours a clear amber-orange color with a thinwhite head. Decent lacing as well. The aroma is a really pleasant concoction of hops and fruit. Medium-bodied, and the flavor is surprisingly subdued given the strong aroma. There is a fair amount of malt in the flavor as well. The finish is fairly clean and bitter. Maybe it is the hop-heavy IPAs like Ruination, Buckeye '76 et al that are to blame but I like a higher level of hops than this beer offers, both in the flavor and in the finish. A decent beer nonetheless."
"This was from a 12 bottle sampler box that arrived at Lexington, Kentucky's Liquor Barn stores a couple of weeks ago, so it should be reasonably fresh. Pours out a medium gold, with an average head and moderate lacing. Floral hop aroma is pleasant, but doesn't knock you back like many American IPAs. Mouthfeel is just about right, medium carbonation and dry hops balanced perfectly with the malt. Taste is basically the same, impressive balance with notes of pink grapefruit and lemon. This is not an exciting or ""big"" IPA, but it is definitely a very well crafted, if toned down, American style pale ale. I'm impressed with its overall likeabilty."
"Pours a dark golden/light amber, with a large cloudy white head, lacing is superb in it's sheeting and strength. Aroma is mostly strong floral hops, with a bit of caramel malt holding it together. Flavor is slightly malty up front, with a big juicy hop finish that dominates the palate and lasts for a while. Medium bodied, extremely drinkable."
"Seems to have gotten a little weaker over the past couple of years. More of a pale ale than an IPA now. It also hasn't ever been as good on tap as in the bottle. I used to buy the bottles quite often, I'd go more with Stone or HopDevil now."
"I was lucky enough to try this on tap at Buckowski's while in town for the Stammtisch festival. It poured a burnt, golden colour. Not a whole lot of carbonation to be had. The tiny head left its mark down the glass as it was devoured. Understated floral scents on the nose. The initial port like sweetness mellowed as the hops gently let themselves be known. I feel this ale more closely resembles a British IPA than a typical american IPA. Not spectacular, but very drinkable. Yummy."
"I decided to pour this along side a Tyranenna IPA...it pales in comparison in regards to hops on the nose and the buds...the Tyranena rocks...huge citrus invade at first pour...this one is different but good in it's own way...the hops and malt are very balanced...almost even...it is highly drinkable..I see the hopping as more of a sweter, floral style than a tight citrus flavor...I like it...Good in a lot of ways and I like the sweeter mouthfeel as a changeup IPA...Almost more of an APA like Summit Extra Pale Ale rather than a full fledged IPA...."
"This is a beer for long sessions. Very yellow in color compared to most IPAs. Aroma is big on the floral and citrus character, my guess is from a healthy dry-hopping. Taste is kind of like budweiser with a ton of cascades added to it. (I mean that in a good way) It tastes well-made with a beatiful balance to it that fades evenly. The only real malt character to speak of is a little breadiness and graininess. The feel is a little thin and fizzy. I felt like I could have drank about ten of these in a row. Pleasing in flavor yet light and drinkable. I have had this beer on tap and it is not nearly as good as the bottled version. I was pleasantly surprised, and it just may become a regular bottled beer for me."
"Poured out a copper color with a medium white head that lingers around for quite a bit. Aroma was straight up hops although not powerful but noticeable. Taste was hoppy with a malt backround fairly balanced out. This was rather smooth and pretty good."
"This seems to be more of a pale ale than an IPA. Still, not a bad beer. I could definitely have a few more of these in the future."
"Pours a bright golden color, a little lighter than other IPAs I have tried - this looks almost like a pilsner. The head was medium sized with medium retention, wilted down to a thin film that stayed for the remainder of the glass. The aroma is very good, a full, spicy, floral hop bouquet, with lemony-citrus note. The taste is also very good. Started off mellow and sweet and blended into a crisp, citric hoppiness that left me smacking my lips. Mouthfeel was full bodied, smooth and semi-dry. Good all-round IPA."
"-- on re-review, it seems that Harpoon has dumbed this down for the masses, with a much more watery taste and diminished hoppiness. Not the classic it once was."
"""Surprisingly Weak"" For some reason, I expected good things of Harpoon. Maybe it's just my West Coast enchantment will all things Eastern. But this beer was just ""blah."" Poured clear gold in color with rather little carbonation and not much of a head to speak of at all. Aroma contained very little malt and only a muted leafy/grapefruity hop boquet. This grapefruit taste comes off in the flavor as something more like grapejuice -- sweet without any significant hop bite. Not much of a malt body, either. It's drinkable, but so is water."
"Poured a golden yellow with a dense and cream-like head. Buttery and crisp is an accurate way to describe this beer. Dry and oily with a slight oily aftertaste. Alcohol presence with a bit of citrus tang. Well rounded body and full of flavor. Nice IPA."
"I've had this beer many times, and i never remember it being this good. I never had it on tap, and it's far superior to the bottled version."
"The beer pours a golden color. Decent enough white head with a decent amount of lacing down the glass. The aroma is fairly decent, with a decent hop aroma. Fairly good hop bite, with a little maltiness to the taste. It is a bit thin in the body department. Pretty decent beer, although it could have a bit more hoppiness to it. Not too terribly different from the draught version."
"OK, it's IPA time. Pours a nice golden color, creamy sticky lofty head. Smells very nice of cascade hops, very brisk in aroma. Taste is dominated by the hop flavors, not too strong though, quite pleasant actually and very drinkable, balanced by some malts, biscuit and bread flavored malts that is. Hop flavors are distinctly of juniper and pine. My belches really bring out the juniper flavors. A solid IPA."
"Pours golden in color with a slight haze. Cascade hops are immediately apperrant in the aroma. Taste is citrusy. Some malt in the taste as well, but it doesn't take away from the hoppiness of this IPA. Basically, just a solid IPA. It has enough bitterness to satisfy the hopheads, but doesn't try to show off with an insane amount of hops."
"This beer pours a light gold color with a moderate head and a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has some fruits in it and some spices as well. The taste was fairly smooth, but not very hoppy. The carbonation is evident in the flavor. Decent beer, but a not quite smooth enough for my tastes."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a light gold color with two fingers of head. There is good head retention and lots of lace left down the side of the glass. The smell is full of pine and citrus, just a hint of hops. The taste is full of fruity esters, but the hops might be a little low for an IPA. Still it is a very nice smooth taste with a nice crisp finish. The body was just a little light and oily. The drinkability is superb though, and I am looking forward to more from this brewery."
"On tap at the brewery. This was my favorite draught beer when I last lived in Boston. Doesn't seem to have the impact it once did for me but a solid IPA still. Fresh as can be a deep copper color with a decent head to it. Aroma is primarily cascade with a slight citrus. Medium bodied witha nice balance and a slight bitter finish. Quite enjoyable."
"Pours a nice medium gold color with a medium head that leaves some lacing,aroma is assertively hoppy and zesty.The taste is hoppy for sure but there is a sweet balance there in the finish.I think this an above average IPA that is very drinkable and goes good with spicey food."
"Hoppy hoppy hoppy if you like a nice balanced but hoppy IPA this is a classic style. Little malt to round off this ale which is more like a West Coast version. Floral nose and hoppy throughout it is thirst quenching and refreshing.. excellent Belgian lace throughout.. and very drinkable on a warm day."
"Overall impression - Not a monstrous IPA, but definitely not wimpy either. Solid and well crafted. The balance was superb, as was the drinkability. Moderately complex character keeps you interested all the way to the bottom of the glass."
"Nice label, pours a dark golden and slightly reddis color. The appearance reminded me of some of the better Macro Canadian Ales because of the darker golden color and clarity. The aroma is of floral hops and the taste is consistent with the aroma. This is a straight floral hop beer. If you like that type of hops, you'll love this beer."
"Appears a golden copper tone with an off white mother of pearl tinted creamy full head while leaving some nice residual lacing. The aroma is slightly citric, but predominantly a nice floral hop aroma with a good bit of malt sweetness balancing out the over scent of this beer. Can't say the aroma is amazingly memorable, but I can say this is a nice pleasant go to at this point very solid brew. The taste flavor is a mellow creamy balance of malty goodness blended with a floral bitter hop profile, I can tell that this beer is a little dumbed down from the guidelines of a typical IPA not getting the hop satisfaction that any true hophead is yearning for. Like I said not a failure but not a favorite at the same time. Mouthfeel is lighter in body with a nice chewy texture to it, not thick and cloying chewy just some pleasant and welcoming body to this beer. Overall what can I say no off flavors maybe lack of some hop bitterness, but overall a dangerously drinkable well made beer in my book."
"This beer poured an amber color and formed a white foamy head that receded slowly and left some nice lace on the side of the glass. A nice hop aroma was apparent, but not overpowering as some others are. A flavor of hops and caramel. The finish was a touch sweet with some bitterness. This wasn't a bad IPA, but certainly not one of my favorites."
"Ah the summer months bring me such joy with the abundence of hops! Harpoon reminds me of Labor day when my parents and their friends would gather and one of them always brough a sixer of Red Hook and a sixer of Harpoon. The IPA poured a hazy summer yellow with a huge fluffy white head that had real staying power. Great head retention! The smell was very sweet and fruity with a little hint of medicinal hops. The taste was refreshing and dry, but lacked the real hop punch I look for in an IPA. Tart hops tickled the front of my tongue and then morphed into deep roasted malts fighting with peachy sweet hops and ended with a bitter hop finish. the mouthfeel was very buttery. This is a good standby, but nothing exceptional. Perfect summer beer."
"Poured a light clear golden color with a small white head. Nice carbonation throughout. Floral hops in the aroma, and really not much else. Nice hoppy taste thats not overpowering but leaves a nice zing on the tongue, finishing dry. Like other harpoon beers I've had this beer has a hint pumpkin pie in the taste that's good & unique, and really noticeable in the winter warmer. This a good IPA. Nothing too special but good overall."
"Body is golden colored with strong elements of orange hues. Aroma is moderate in strength and largely comprised of floral and citrus notes. Flavor has an odd malt bite which creates a good balance with the brew's moderate hop profile for an IPA. Body is moderate and head leaves a strong lace. A good IPA. No surprises here."
"Had soft citrus, hops, and malt throughout. Finished with a toasted biscuit with a mild bitterness that finishes nicely. Great IPA and a wonderful beer."
"Pale amber in appearance. Silky smooth off-white lace coats the glass. Aromas are much softer than the bottled version. A slight citrus and earthy mix. The taste is so very smooth. Given that this is my first cask-conditioned beer, I really didn't know what to expect. Man! Was I impressed! When I'd originally reviewed this beer, I noted how well-balanced it was, from a hoppy bitterness:malty sweetness ratio. The very same holds true with this version of the IPA. Everything just seems to have been toned down and mellowed. Mouthfeel and drinkability were fantastic. The differences in this beer from the cask and bottle are striking. A great way to start off the AOBF."
"A solid inch or more of bright white foam rests gently atop a slightly hazy, golden-amber body. The head retention is good, and some very nice lace is left throughout the entire glass. Bright, fresh, and floral hops greet you in the nose as soon as it's poured! Very nice! A medium body combines with a very fine-bubbled carbonation to leave it lightly crisp on the tongue. Floral hops and a sweet grainy malt swirl in a kaleidescope of flavor right off the bat! Rich, exciting, sweet, hoppy, fruity, and finally, bitter in the lingering, drying finish. It's exceptionally well-balanced with a bitterness that reveals itself increasingly with every sip. What finesse!"
"Pours a fairly light pilsner color, topped with an orangey foamy head. There is a light hop aroma, and an initial flavor also of light hop. Flavor is also tinged with pine and citrus. For an IPA, I would have expected the hop to be stronger, but it is even and well balanced with other flavors. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp."
"Solid IPA. Pours yellow-orange with a good head. Sturdy mouthfeel with a nice level of hoppiness. Finishes a bit too bitter for my taste but rather well balanced overall. Perhaps its best quality is its ready-availability almost everywhere in the NorthEast these days."
"Happy Drinking!"
"I must note prior to the review that the bottle I got is about seven months old. Pours a pale orange (someone described it as apricot, I'd say that's right) with a sticky, white head. Earthy, citric hope head, with some malt towards the end. Very vibrant smell. I was a bit disappointed by the taste. While the nose was very nice, the taste was just so-so, and kind of boring. There is hop bitterness, but much less than I expected. Malty, biscuity taste. This beer warms a bit, which is always nice. Medium-bodied, and crisp. I'd say this beer is fairly drinkable. It might be a nice beer for those uninitiated in the world of IPA's just so they can start to get their feet wet."
"I do thank Uglyradio for sending it."
"This beer pours a clear golden color with a clingy off white moderate sized head. The mouthfeel is closer to moderate than thin. The smell is of sweet malt and citrus. The taste is of bread like malt with a grapefruit hoppiness and a lingering herbal quality. This beer seems to me to be more along the lines of an English IPA in that it is more balanced but using an american style hops to give a citrusy flavor. Pretty drinkable."
"This isn't a serious IPA, more like something a macro drinker would try when they want to be adventurous. It could be rescued by a chunkier mouthfeel and more hops; in its current incarnation I won't be revisiting this."
"smell is citrusy, with some hops aroma. taste is clean and crisp. hops up front and tons of lemon at the end. very very lemony when i had it on tap. i don't think that aspect is as prevalent when had in bottles. mouthfeel is thin and crisp. average drinkability. not a top-notch beer but a decent IPA that delivers some hops and is pretty tasty. much better on tap, imho."
"The Harpoon IPA seems to be imitating the IPA style rather than letting loose and creating their own representation. Orange pekoe in color. The medium malt is a little grainy. This highly hopped brew is uninspired. Some citrus bitterness with a hint of sweetness. Smooth for the IPA and too easy to drink (Should be sharp edged and boldly bitter.) Nice mix!"
"This is a very consistent, thirst-quenching, reliable beer. It could be a bit sharper, but of course, I'm a bit of a hop-head. It could have more depth, more complexity, a bit more malt to play with the hops. But, it is very refreshing on a hot day, and seems well put-together."
"On tap this was a very enjoyable brew. Color was pale, with a nice white head. My favorite part of the beer (not really, drinking it is the best) was the aroma. It was a nice combination of fruity and hop like smells that reminded me of spring. A nice flavored beer as well, with a strong hop presence that I expect from an IPA. Overall, a very tasty brew with or without food."
"A good beer and at a good price when compared to other micros."
"Harpoon is not the best IPA but it's a worthy brew and I'll buy it again."
"I may like this brew better from the bottle. I'm not sure. Pours out a nice amber color with a great head. Goes down almost as smooth as on tap. Very very drinkable brew. I love the fact that this brew is everywhere around Boston. It's nice to live in a city where a nice micro can be bought where ever you go. Not a wonderful IPA, but you'll be able to put them away."
"I certainly do not dislike this ale, but there are better IPAs out there in the bottle (Shipyard Fuggles, Victory Hop Devil). If you're in a pub that has Harpoon on draught, have one for me!"

"Re-reviewed and ratings altered a bit on 6/2/03."
"Upon another review I found it to be a bit watery."
"One of my favourites especially when I can get it with a month old or less ""bottled on date"". Nothing like fresh Harpoon IPA! Oddly I like this brew better in the bottle than on tap."
"A pretty good brew overall. Copper colored with a clear look, thin off white head and no lacing. Smells hoppy and citrusy with a bit of spice I think. Not a very hoppy IPA, and when I drink this style I really prefer a big hop kick. However, the more balanced flavor of this beer was pleasant. Very drinkable and smooth."
"A very good brew from Harpoon. This pours a nice dark red/copper colour with a little head that is gone very quickly, I have noticed that most harpoon beers don't have too much of a head retention to them...oh well. This smells very hoppy, like an IPA should, and it goes down very crisp on the tongue. This beer has a very balanced flavor, the interplay of the hops and the malts is great! but unlike the ale the hops really stand out on this one! This has a crisp mouthfeel and a high drinkability factor as well. This is a great summer evening brew that will keep you coming back for more....great!"
"On the pour the beers appears a deeply tanned gold with a sparkling white head that is impressive in size, frothy in its texture and as it erodes it leaves a nice lace coving. Lightly floral, hints of malt with a citrus crispness and quite a treat for the nose, sweet at the front with a middling top and a biting acidity at the finish with an English hop spicy bite, not brutal, just quite pleasant to the palate, also quite dry, and a very drinkable beer in this Beer lovers book."
"This beer poured into the glass a gold color. The head was foamy white head that left fairly fast but the skim that it left was able to leave some lace. The aroma was of citrus, hops and citrus hops. The taste was not too heavy on the hops but they were present, but they shared it with the citrus. Some malt seemed to be present at the back of the taste but it faded quick. Pretty good for this style. I think it would be a good starter for a beginning IPA drinker"
"A nice balance of hops and malt with a pleasant copper color. Nothing fancy here, just a good clean consistent ale. This is my everyday always on hand ale. Refreshing and thirst quenching and readily available on the East Coast."
"Crystal clear golden yellow beer with a nice head of pure white foam that leaves a good bit of lace. Aroma is full of hops with floral and grapfruity citrus notes dominating. Flavor was light hop bitterness, with a big dose of citrus hoppiness being right up front. Flavor fades through some sweet malt before a very fast dry finish.OK beer for the style, and at least it isn't one of those all hops all the time super beers."
"My first IPA, I decided to revisit it. Just the right blend of hops, not too overpowering make this copper colored beverage just right. Easy drinking, it can be a good ""game time"" beer. Glad I tried it again."
"A pleasant suprise from harpoon. A rich copper color with a creamy head. In the middle for taste but a good dry finish. Goes down very easily,a nice ipa to share with crossovers."
"Harpoon's IPA looks like your standard issue American IPA. It's medium copper in color and possesses a sticky, clinging head that leaves substantial lace throughout the glass. The nose is predominantly hoppy, with a definite floral aspect. It tastes quite hoppy with a decent malt backbone, however for this style, my tastes require more hops and more malt. Mouthfeel is rather prickly and clean. It's easy to have more than a few of these, making this a good choice for a session beer. It's certainly worth a try."
"although some ipa's have failed me, this one was pretty good. hoppy, but not to the extreme. i will say that this beer had a very intense flavor and mouthfeel. it had some kick with a nip on your tongue that you could never forget. harpoon seems to do that, and i find it unique. it is a great new experiece to have a harpoon"
"Mmmm I have never gone wrong with an IPA and this is no exception. Beautiful fluffy head that stood well over the top of my glass, copper color. Very nice hop flavor, not that strong but you certainly can't miss it. Sticky lace all the way down. Extremely smooth, and an excellent mouthfeel, smooth and buttery. A great IPA."
"Quite the easy drinking tap offering. A toasty malt spine holding up a well hopped bitterness, aroma and flavor. One could drink this all night, but the ABV might have something to say about that after a half dozen."
"Dark golden hue w/ a light ale haze.  Pungent dry hopped Cascade hop nose (not unlike fresh Liberty Ale) dominates, but a bit of generic caramel sweetness is there in aroma also.  Although hop bitterness dominates, yeast fruitiness & toasty malt are perceptible.  Light in body, but crisp and quite drinkable.  The hop flavor is expctedly citrus.  Finishes clean and bit dry.  A bit understated in malt for an AIPA and perhaps one - dimensional, but nonetheless is an enjoyable brew.  With a bigger malt backbone this would be excellent.  It's reminscent of a thin Anchor Liberty with more hop bitterness."
"A good IPA but not my style, serious hops from start to finish.  Clear, good head, heavy hop aroma.  Medium body and fairly dry.  Strong bitter finish."
"Slightly musty hop smell with a hint of citrus.  Very light color with a slight amber hue. It has a lasting white head.  It is very.. very carbonated.  Crisp hop flavor with a nice bitter finish.  It is very clean.. almost too clean but is quite drinkable for an IPA due to this fact.  The mouth is left very dry after tasting.  A very tasty IPA.  It is a clean and bitter brew with a dry hop flower finish.. Very sturdy."
"One of the best-balanced IPA's, particularly for an American style.  Up front, this is moderately sweet with a little resin in the hops.  The hops bittering in the finish is lingering at the back of the tongue.  Very drinkable, and one of the few IPA's that I would designate as having session potential."
"My favorite beer for everyday enjoyment!  And especially beautiful and tastey on tap.  This is everything that Harpoon IPA is with a deep golden colour with a super-creamy, off-white head with tremendous retention.  Big rings and full coverage across the top.  Nice dry and balanced, slightly biting medium body with covert, but full, malts and complex and striking hops.  Drinks great for any occasion or situation.  Cheers!"
"A very well rounded IPA from one of my fav breweries.  But as one earlier post stated after trying others such as Pyramid and Sweetwater for me it had alot to live up to.  I would drink this beer again but there are other IPA's much better in my opinion...............CHEERS"
"Pours a nice light copper color with a thin white head that has some decent lacing qualities. Nice pungent, oily aroma. The hop explosion hit the palate first. And it is good. I would say this beer is more hoppy than it is bitter. There is a bitter element present, but more of the hoppy tones seem to make their way to my taste sensors. Flowery and herbal at the same time. A bit oily. Slightly pungent. After cutting through all of the wonderful hop nuances, you will find a decent malt presence. Nicely done IPA here."
"All in all, a decent IPA.  After having tried Pyramid and Lost Coast though, the bar may be a bit too high.  The color was a nice copper and there was a moderate hoppy aroma intertwined with some fruit and spice tinges.  The first sip is slightly disappointing, as one tends to expect more bang for the buck.  As you get to the middle of the bottle, and towards the end of it, this IPA tends to grow on you a bit.  Not the best, but not terrible, by far."
"Had my first one of these tonight. It's a nice beer, and from what I've read, a pretty consistent one, which is a good thing. Just a few shades lighter than amber in color, with a fluffy white head that fades rather quickly. The aroma has me befuddled -- I can hardly smell anything. Allergies, maybe? Taste is more pronounced, though. Almost English in style, the hops are not over-the-top, but they're there. Nice mild citrus and a touch of pine. Smooth malt character provides a pleasant balance, and leads to a smooth, creamy finish. Not a standout necessarily; this is probably one of those beers that grows on you the more you drink it, so I'm looking forward to trying a few more."
"Big bubbly white head over golden body. Nice lacing. Big hop aromas, lot of citrus. Much more balanced in taste than nose would indicate. More English than American IPA (except for the aroma). Which makes it more of a session beer for hopheads. Some postings/reviews seem to indicate that it has been dumbed-down, but this is still a fine beer.  Glad they still send large quanitites to New Jersey."
"Pours a clear bright golden color with a thick, bubbly, white head.  Smell is all hops and hop oil.  Some slight citrus and very floral qualities.  Floral hops explode onto the tongue but are then followed by some nice balancing malt.  Brew gets maltier as it warms.  Crisp and dry mouthfeel and extremely drinkable.  This is definitely one of my major fallback brews when I am home in MA.  Recently it has become very easy to get down here in VA, no complaints from me.  One of my all time favorite session brews."
"Slightly sour aroma, pours to tempting head, golden color (light for ipa). Good hop character: floral, bitter, stringy. Hops are what make the beer. Light fruity malts are understated, pretty mild character overall despite hop presence. Absolutely fresh, it can be quite good but if its more than a couple weeks old it'll be closer to average."
"This is the local hopmeister.  A deep rich amber color with a medium body and lasting thick head give this beer a good look, nice heavy hop aroma and powerful, yet mellow hop flavor profile.  Nice balance of malts with this one create an easy drinking libation."
"It certainly does assault you on first whiff and taste. Had it last night for the first time and ended up carrying out the box this morning. Not that I was responsible for the whole thing. Hoppy as sin, kinda bready and skanky on the nose. Didn't hold a held but plenty of carbonation."
"The color is a medium-copper, w/ a small head which dissipates very quickly. Nice floral hoppiness  w/ bite on the mouth, excellent finish. I enjoyed this very much, a true English styled IPA!"
"56"
"Updated to increase taste and drinkability, after a trip to Boston where I had this fresh at the brewery. This is much better when fresh and overall one of my favorite east coast session IPA's. Very well balanced, bright flavors and really quaffable."
"Very pale for an American IPA but very tasty.  Hops everywhere but not overwhelming."
"At first a salty green rind flavour followed by a rush of citrus and sweet malt."
"This beer was really something at the onset of the craft brew movement and it's likely converted many a yellow beer drinker. It's still very good beer. However, with the evolution of American IPAs, this one comes up a little short. Maybe that's an unfair comparison since this probably is closer to an English style IPA. Even so, it's a little weak."
"A pretty decent, all around good IPA. Plenty of hops and malt to match, with a nice alcohol kick. Unfortunately it's seems to be changing year after year, getting dumbed down for the masses and is nothing like the original Tod Mott recipe. Still, a solid favourite of mine and a nice backup beer."
