"Overall: A pretty good English IPA. Not my favorite, and the aroma was seriously lacking, but if it was on tap with the macros, I'd pick this instead."
"This is a nasty malt bomb! I don't know if the bottle was sitting in the shelf for 2 years before I got it? But it was a drain pour. Just being honest."

"O: A good traditional English IPA, so don't come expecting a West Coast hop bomb. One day I'd like to visit and try this on tap."

"I'm not usually and English IPA guy but this is up there with the ones I like best (Berkshire Lost Sailer comes to mind). I think I prefer American brewers brewing Engilsh IPAs just like I like Billie Joe imitating an Englishman imitating an American better than a British accent. Yup."

"Overall I think this is a pretty good example of the style. Slightly bitter for my taste, but those who are all about the IBUs will like this one."
"I have tried this one in a bottle as well as on-tap, and although the bottle is just fine, this is one with subtleties that come off much better on-tap....Come on over to Trinity during a quiet afternoon, play chess with a friend, take your time with a couple of pints of this, and savor away."
"The hop profile in this is quite odd. It's not a blast of bitter citrus like most American IPAs. It's more herbal, earthy, and grassy, but it packs a bitter punch. I've been meaning to try beers from Trinity for a while, and this was not a bad choice."

"Overall this is a great IPA. I really liked it! I just wish it had a high malt to hop ratio. I like my IPAs with a bigger malt presence. It was a flavorful hop bomb for sure. If I ever am in the mood for a big IPA, and happen to see this in Southern New England or in Rhode Island, I'll get it no problem!!!"

"Overall, a very flavorful IPA. Big hop aroma and flavor, but not much malt to balance it. Good"

"Notes: This is quite hoppy for an English i.p.a but still tasty all over. Cheers."
"O: Dangerously drinkable."
"Fail."
"Overall not bad, the hops were pretty good and didn't get that herbal Hedgerow bittering hops I don't like, they were decent grassy and earthy hops, little juicy and spicy, nice malts to back it up a bit, a nice ale flavor, but the yeast seems to change it a bit."
"O: just noticing now that it's 7%. wouldn't have noticed from the aroma or taste -- they blend it well. i would have guessed 5%, maybe 6% max. given that and the astringency, i don't think i'd have more than one of these in a session. i've had this beer at Trinity on-tap, and remember it being tastier than this bottled version."
"drinks okay. not something I'd buy by the six pack, but not something I'm about to pour down the drain either. just meh."
"All in all, this is so dry that it seems to take away from the brew. An earthy hoppy metallic type dry. Not really worth hunting, but if you like Trinity, give it a try when you're at the brewhouse. Many better IPAs."
"Pours a nice pale copper color into an SA perfect pint glass with gorgeous lacing and a serious 1+ finger head. Smells of bountiful floral bouquets with citrusy and piny resin aromas. Taste isn't quite on par with smell, has the herbal and floral for sure but also a faint bitterness that is very well balanced that wasn't detectable in the nose. Feels very smooth going down, crispy with the mild bitter finish, again very well balanced. This brew is very drinkable, crisp, and refreshing, sure to satisfy on a hot day. Had this while I was cooking up a dinner with copious amounts of garlic and spiciness and it went very well with the few bites I had as I was cooking away. Nothing too overpowering, bitterness was balanced by floral and fruitiness, overall nothing that blew me away but nothing terribly disappointing either."
"Pours a nice cloudy orangy color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with a nice hop note, some nice citrus notes, slight pine note. The taste is very nice malty, with a very nice hop note, nice balance, citrus, and some slight pine notes. Medium body. Drinkable, this is my first Trinity brew, and it's very nice. Thanks Mark."
"This beer pours a cloudy copper color with a nice ecru froth to top it all off. The aroma is much more caramel based than most IPAs I'm used to...oh this is an EIPA, that would explain that. The aroma given off is most similar to an orange marmalade with some sugary sweet fruit notes to go along with the malt base. The flavor is still plenty bitter from the hops but has a nice brown sugar flavor with the orange citrus notes. The mouthfeel is a tad on the dry side for my liking but it's not unpalatable. There is nothing special or outstanding about this beer but, it is overall a quality brew"
"Thin mouthfeel and a moderate-high carbonation for the style. Pretty solid. Its butteryness was a problem, but it didn't completely distract me from the beer. Possibly a problem with the yeast not cleaning up all the diacetyl after fermentation but who knows. Didn't realize this was 7%, that's funny. Why is it so high?"
"D: A hearty, malty IPA that holds together very well. Well-balanced and a good departure from my usual go-to hop-bombs. Probably a bit too rich and filling to squash too many in one sitting. I tend to criminally overlook this solid IPA, probably because it's so common in these parts, but it grows on me a little bit more each time I try it. Not quite in my list of all-time favorite IPAs, but always a good choice."
"Drinkability is ok. This isn't a bad IPA, but it's not a great one either. Kind of average..."
"D: A pretty good English IPA and one might argue dangerously drinkable at 7% ABV. The strength of the brew is not measured by its alcohol flavor, but rather the hop content. Mellow enough to have a couple, but not the most exciting or balanced English IPA you could probably find."
"The beer pours a clear yellow color with a white head. The aroma begins as citrus but then gets a strong buttery popcorn note. The flavor is also dominated by butter with only the slightest hint of pine and citrus hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"poured into a tulip glass, poured a cloudy orangeish color with a 4 finger head that is a creamy thick white color that is sticking around for awhile. the smell is floral and citrisey hops and fresh baking breed. the first drink is ritch breedy malt up front then floral hops in the midle and a lingering piney hop bite that leaves a plesent after taste that wont go away. as it warms the beer gets slighty sweeter and the piney flavor is still strong but gets i tuch more citrusey. this is a beer i would drink often if it were avalable hear."
"D- This was a very drinkable IPA that I enjoyed a growler of. Actually I split it with some friends and we all had no problem drinking it at all. Will look to try this from the bottle to see what the difference is. A good drinking east coast IPA for sure."
"This beer pours with a nice IPA style color. This beer has a good IPA smell. Has a small amount of sweetness which I enjoy in an IPA. This is an above average IPA and I look forward to consuming another Trinity IPA when I make it back up to this region."
"D-this is a pretty easy to drink IPA with a lot of balance. A definite malt presence in this beer but it still leans towards the hops. Light bitterness in the finish."
"D- A more intense beer in the growler than in the bottle, I really liked this. It's a shame I've slept on this for so long.. I see myself picking up a growler on a pretty frequent basis. I enjoyed this more than the bottle version."
"Medium carbonation and sweet, but still pretty light and drinkable. So well balanced that I feel like I could go for a few of these in a row. Quite hoppy, but the alpha acids aren't overwhelming which makes for a really nice drink."
"12 ounce bottle, best before dat of March notched onto the label, pours orange hued, cloudy medium amber. The head is typical khaki, loose and leaves behing ample tiny bits of scattered lace. Soft, Brit style hops in the nose. Pleasingly balanced IPA, the hops are smooth and soft, but quite noticable. Enjoyable, understated and well crafted. Nothing earth shattering, but worth a try. Would work quite well as an all night sessioner."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my shaker glass. The IPA appears a hazed copper color with about a finger of off white head. Aromas and flavors consist of pine notes, citrus, mainly lemon, toasted bread, sweet malt, some orange. Amply carbonated with a medium body and a crisp bitter finish. Pretty tasty."
"D - Not all that appealing."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is on the thin side of medium bodied. The beer is very smooth and well balanced. This beer isnt a hop bomb and wasnt meant to be one either. I think the brewer tried for and achieved a very well balanced IPA. Just an excellent treat!"
"This beer pours a deep clear amber/brown color with a 2 finger of off white head that fades to a film relatively quickly. Some thin wispy lacing is left on the glass throughout. Nose is of sweet caramel malts and a healthy dose of floral hops and a hint of some citrus hops. Taste is of caramel malts upfront, possibly some molasses. Hops presence hits in the middle to end - nice rich floral hops and a piney character that I didn't detect in the nose. Finish has a citrus hops bite to it. Medium body, medium carbonation, nice clean taste to it with a dry finish. This is a great one to sit with though the ABV sneaks up on you."
"It is also extremely delicious when they have it on cask (even smoother and more complex)."
"Pours an opaque copper with a very nice head and lacing. Smell is a nice blast of citrus hops with a veiled malt presence. Taste is a bitter hop blast..not much balance on the malt side. Drinkability and mouthfeel suffer a tad from the overly bitter quality of the hops...needs just a tad more smoothness."
"Drinkability: Other than the finish, I rather liked this beer; too bade avout the after-taste"
"Not my kind of IPA, but a good offering if you're into the bitter kinds as opposed to the citrus kinds. I especially like the way the malt gives you just enough sweetness. Probably a favorite English-style IPA I've ever had."
"D: Nothing mind-blowing. A good session IPA and probably a pretty good value."
"Trinity offers a great selection at the brewhouse and this is one of their best. Unfortunately, this beer is not the same in the bottle as it is at Trinity Brewhouse. It is a very very hopyy and bitter IPA. Really hits you in the face with the smell and taste of hops. If you like IPA's this is a good one, but try it at the brewhouse."
"decided to have this with an nice pasta dinner and garlic bread. a nice amber brew with a solid white head greats me. a nice citric / herbal hop note balanced by a bready maltiness. taste follows the nose with a bitterness which cuts through dinner nicely. Medium bodied, nicely carbonated with a nice residual bitter note and a clean finish."
"a very hoppy (to my palate) ipa."
"Drinkability~ This one is a personal favorite so if the rating seems too high, too bad. haha~ This is a great IPA and more than deserving of a great review. Strongly recommend it!"
"Trinity IPA is a rock-solid English IPA brewed by New Englanders. Even though I prefer the flavor of American hops, a change of pace is always good. If it was available locally, I'd be down for a sixer right here and now, no questions asked."
"M + D: Lighter carbonation and a bit of oiliness. Fairly straight forward... a little heavy in alcohol content, so a bit easy going. Not too shabby, but there are some other options I would lean towards more."
"Drinkability: An interesting beer, and one I'm glad to have tried. It's a solid English IPA (not my favorite style), with a fair amount of bitterness and a decent array of tastes and aromas. Alcohol is gettin' up there for the style, however, though there's no sign of it, which is nice. Good to have a nice, local blue state beer, too! Cheers."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. The beer pours a reddish amber with a 1 inch head, that seriously lacked staying power. While the head receded quickly, it did leave quite a bit of lacing. The aroma is overwhelmingly malty. There is almost no hint of hops, just a small aroma of citrus at the end of the nose. The aroma is grainy with just a bit of brown sugar. The taste follows suit with malt being the dominant flavor with just a mild, non-descript bitterness at the tail of the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is light with a mild carbonation. This beer reminds me of what you get at local restaurants that just happen to make a couple styles of beer in house. Nothing exciting but nothing horrible either. Just average all across the board."
"No surprises here...a steady-Eddie sessionable IPA. Their brewpub across from the Dunk in Providence is also a good place to hit before baby B's games in the wintertime!"
"hmm... i thought this was pretty decent. other reviewers obviously not so much..."
"Trinity needs to work on this IPA. It primarily needs less malt and more hops. That would be a huge stip in the right direction. As it is, it's just very average. Not one I would suggest seeking out."
"D - Nice ale for a warm Rhode Island summer day, but would be best with some hot steamers."
"D: Not good. Very poorly balanced with no malt support. Poor sessionability."
"Not much to this IPA. A bit watery and not much in the flavor. I tried it but won't seek it out again. If it was for free I wouldn't turn it down though."
"Not a bad beer, but a tad unbalanced. The appearance is quite good, it pours a tawny amber with a slight creamy head, a bit of lacing, and some retention. The aroma is pretty typical of a mainline IPA. There are some grassy hops, a touch of malt in the background. The aroma is not of the oily, estery hop character and the same goes for the taste. There is a pretty upfront hoppy bitter taste, but it is more dryish, a bit tea like, perhaps a bit grassy, but it does lack that oily and estery hoppiness that I prefer. You will get some grapefruit like astringency coupled with the bitterness. The result is a overly bitter beer, with not enough biscuity malts in the backbone to balance it out. There is also too much of a bittering aftertaste. Not a bad beer, quite refreshing, with some carbonation, fairly light to medium bodied, worth giving a try. I would very much like to visit the brewpub and have this on tap."
"Pretty good entry for an IPA."
"I was surprised by the big hop flavor in this brew...it has been years since I tried this at the brewpub but I recall the in-house version being a bit more tame. A solid, hoppy IPA."
"D: This is a solid, standard IPA. It's got a nice kick with a great balance. Pretty well done overall."
"With taps at the ready a very knowledgeable brewer prepared my beer with a noticeable head that cascaded around as he turned the pint slightly in drought. The distinct aroma of pine with citrus hoppy foam was my first sensory pleasure. At first sip its head grasped my upper lip with a very light rose scent. The 7% ABV isn't noticeable, which has it's drawbacks. After 6-8 you thank the beer gods that you are within walking distance of the train in downtown Providence. It is one of the better IPA's that I have encountered in a brewpub."
" Overall this was a quality little IPA that I had never heard of but impressed me none the less. It was just put together well, not overally explosive on teh hops and just well, nice. I would definatly not turn this one down."
"I wanted to like this, and the ingredients are actually good, you can sense that underneath, but the blending, or what there is of it, is inept and unbalanced. And with an ABV that plays a lot bigger than it actually is, it's one more distraction and an obstacle to drinking more easily. I doubt I'll run across this again, and the shame is, that's okay."
"Very drinkable. Good hop flavor without an over the top ABV. Only complaint is the mouthfeel. The lack of body and xs carbonation don't do this beer any favors."
"Overall a good and drinkable ale. Closer to an EIPA in my opinion based on the hop profile."
"Pours a murky caramel brown, reddish highlights, huge off white head, lots of sticky lace, good retention, never wants to go away. Smell is lots of sweet malts, caramel, pine, some citrus, bit of floral, lots of fruit, not too hoppy, pretty balanced. Taste is weak, some grain, caramel, pine, bit of citrus, kind of medicinal in the finish, nutty bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, carbonation is low, possibly lower than normal due to a bad seal. Still seems to be in shape judging by previous reviews, just not entirely interesting. Thanks for the brew Mark!"
"Overall: One of my favorite beers at trinity, and the one time they actually had it on cask it was probably the single best single IPA i have ever had. Its ok in the bottle too, but to get the real experience head to the brewhouse!"
"The flavor is concentrated and direct, combining malt, hops and yeast into one solid flavor. The somewhat sweetish malt is darkly caramelish, and balanced by a bold bitterness. Yeasty fruitiness adds a fresh, sweetish accent that's reminicent of apples, berries, pear, and cherry. The citrusy hops round it out, but are more restrained than might be expected, helping to focus on the whole rather than just the hop component. And yet, there's still enough there to allow each component its own berth, and enough depth of character to give it some complexity and drinkability. Additionally, some actual yeast flavor sneaks in, giving it another dimension (although a more careful pour might help to hold that back). Nicely done! A bright, lively IPA that wakens the tastebuds! Certainly worth trying."
"in the 2007 beer super bowl o beer"
"A lot better than my previous experience with Trinity IPA, which was almost 2 years ago. I remember it having a very metallic taste to it which wasn't present this time around, although the overflowing head problem was pretty annoying."
"D: I wouldn't refuse another one, but I also wouldn't go out of my way for this IPA. Good appearance and smell, but with flawed taste and mouthfeel make this a 'worth a try' beer at best."
"A nice pick up on the way back from CT. Poured a dark amber color with very little in the way of head or lacing, which is somewhat surprising considering the alcohol content. In any event from the first smell this was going to be a very drinkable beer. The sweet malty flavor clung to the front while there was just a waft of hops lingering about the edges of my nostrils. Just a tad bit of fruitiness could be detected with a deep inhalation. The taste mimicked the nose with that malty, fruity flavor upfront. As the beer slid down the back of my tongue and onto my throat the hops became detectable. This is definitely a nice balance between the hoppiness that is more prevalent with American IPAs with a nice smooth maltiness of the English style. I could easily drink 4 or 5 of these without any trouble. A good choice for a sixer at the end of a long day."
"Thanks TheManiacalOne for the chance to try this brew."
"Pours an amber color with a small white head, Aroma has a sweet malt, piney hops, some honey. Taste is some malt, hop bitterness, citrus. Kind of dry. Not a bad drinking beer but nothing to wait on"
"D: Tasty due to the good hops kick, not-too-filling, seems to lean toward an English-style IPA with some extra hoppiness. I thought this beer would taste similar to their Rhode Island IPA that they have on-tap at the brewpub, however although it was still good, the two beers are quite different, even when you factor in the bottle vs. tap."
"A toned down IPA in some respects; the hop character is slow acting which is pretty unusual. A change of pace, but I prefer the more modern, aggressive hop monsters."
"Hazy apricot colored with a huge inch-high head of light orange foam. Bubbles are small and fine, contributing to a thick meringue feel. Aroma is light but malty, a little grainy, not too hoppy, perhaps because the foam holds it down. Flavor is initially piney hops with specks of grapefruit and tangerine, followed by a faint malt presence. Also some bits of metallic flavor which detract. Good mouthfeel, but average drinkability because it's not very complex or multidimensional."
"Nice cloudy amber brownish color. Huge head disapated after a few minutes. Way over carbonated in the sixer I got. The bottle cap basicly blew itself clear across the room upon opening. Poured very poorly. Had to wait about 10 minutes to pour it. Not much lacing. Sharp hop bite nice mild flavor. Citrusy, floral, grassy smell had some sand or earthy scent to it. Subtle maltiness in the background. Rather strong had a good taste to it but very bubbly. Like an IPA momosa. Besides the over carbination it was a decent beer. On tap is much better at Trinity Brewhouse. This sixer did this beer no justice. Once the bubbles are managed then I will seek a rematch. Better on tap at Trinity."
"Great mouthfeel with good hop flavor. Poured in the glass nicely with a little head that receded to a lacy overcoating. Standard coloring for it's style. Would like a bit more hop smell, not enough compared to what you're tasting. Tastes a tad too bitter for me, would like more hop flavor with the bitterness (but this could just be me). Great mouthfeel (did I already say that?) and good hop lingering after taste. Leaves your palate thirsting for more!"
"M & D: Mouthfeel is of pure carbonation. A bit oily at the sides of the mouth with a good bitter ending. Suprisingly drinkable even though you have to wait for the big ass head to dissipate. Very tasty ipa that I'd like to try on tap instead of in the bottle as the carbonation would most likely be less."
"As my review states this is just an overall average beer. It is however much better than the first batch of trinity that was brewed by cottrell. That stuff was pure swill. Not an overly hoppy IPA and pretty bland taste. However it still was pretty good overall. I would like to try some directly from the brewery to see the difference."
"I'd had their IPA on tap at the brewpub several times, and it was always, always much better than this. I'm guessing there's some quality issues on the production level. For one, losing at least some of the yeasty flavor, and perhaps some actual yeast, may improve both the flavor and mouthfeel. Also, perhaps the bottling line is failing to remove enough oxygen from the bottles prior to capping? Not letting them foam up enough before capping? The frothing of the head, the cardboard flavor, and the huge amount of carbonation are all things I expect in an old, oxodized bottle of beer. If I'd bought this at a less than reputable shop, I'd chalk it up to just sitting there since last year, but I have enough faith in the store to assume the problem was in the bottling. I mean, the beer's nice enough as it is, drinkable in small quantity, but it could be so much better. Fix the problems and you have a real winner."
"i'm unsure if i had a bad 6-pack of this but the beer was way over-carbonated. the head filled the entire glass. after a while of waiting it did hold a nice lacy layer over the beer which is always nice. the color was that of a foggy amber-brownish look. very aromatic with much hops and a hint of sweetness/fruit. the mouthfeel was very carbonated with a nice piny flavor which turned slightly sweet and ended with a long finish, very enjoyable if the carbonation was less."
"Lots 'o hops but somewhat unbalanced if you ask me. Needs more of a malt presence to back up the bitter. Not terribly bad, but not too far above average either."
"I was pretty suprised (I don't know why) at the great apearance, smell and taste of this IPA. It is better than I expected, decently full of hops and great looking."
"Worth a try."
