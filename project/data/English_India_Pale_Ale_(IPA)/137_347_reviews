"Very little hop character in the aroma and taste, and just not very pleasant overall."
"Good IPA! from Maine. 12 oz. bottle."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark bronze color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of light hops, some floral notes. Taste is lightly hopped, a strong malt backbone, some mild citrus. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a bit light on hops for the style, but highly drinkable and enjoyable."

"O: reminded me of some of my early home brews; very drinkable, but carbonation wasn't quite right and taste needed something;"
"Although it doesnâ€™t necessarily have a character of its own, it is a well-executed IPA, kind of mixing English and American styles. I am under the impression they boosted its hops compared to older versions."

"Overall/Comments: Overall I thought this was a very good offering that was very well balanced and while not spectacular I thought this represented the style admirably. Classified as an English IPA @ 6,2%. Consumed 5/8/2013."

"I typically don't go for IPAs, but I'll try this one again. If it ever comes in my beer of the month box again."

"I do not know why this is being labeled retired unless I got a really old beer from my Beer of the Month Club... anyway, the beer poured a light amber color with a tan head. Did not look like an IPA. It smelled like an IPA. The taste was not IPA either but more of a heavy lager. It was very unIPA'ish, but I liked it and would buy again of course if it is still available that is."

"Overall: this IPA leans towards the citrus end, and is not as refreshing as some others out there. Decent beer but nothing overwhelming."

"Don't know that I've ever met a Sea Dog I liked."

"O: This beer wsa quite enjoyable and easy to drink but I would not likely think of it as a sessionable beer - slightly too intense in the hoppiness to have more than one of these at a sitting."
""
""
""
"O: I doubt if I ever have this again, as there was barely anything good about this beer."
""
"Overall, i'm not impressed. a mediocre offering which I would not seek out."

"An ok beer all around but nothing spectacular."
""
""
"More like a light golden ale than ipa. Years ago I was a fan of Sea Dog's Old East IPA, but I think the Shipyard folks have wrecked havoc here. Major disappointment. Avoid."
""
""

"O- I did not enjoy this beer at all. In fact, I couldnt even finish it. I had to pour half of it out...what a waste."
"Overall average pale ale, barely ipa, almost all bittering hops, no real floral, citrus or tropical fruit, some malt balance but this is more like a best bitter than ipa."
"Overall: This beer does very well on the cask. A decent IPA and very drinkable."
"Poured on-tap at the Sea Dog in South Portland. The beer was served in a pint glass, and it presents a caramel brown color that is crisp and vibrant. No head on this beer. The aromas are a blend of coffee, nut, and caramel, overall rich and sweet. The flavors are rich, sweet caramel malt with a strong, deep hop presence in the foundation. Very smooth and round. The aftertaste is rich and sweet, with a heavier hop presence, both moist green and slightly spiced. The beer has a dry, clean finish. Not too shabby."
"D - Nicely done and appropriate to the style, the cask conditioning was a nice touch."
"O: blah. Skip."
" The taste is mildly hoppy no big deal, it has some hops up front with a slight caramel-like flavor which starts to take over with a slight cloying effect which makes it pretty average as far as flavor, almost as if the yeast gave up 3/4 of the way and left the residual sugar there and this doesn't bother that much because it tastes ok, but it does distract from the hops that are apparently there, just muted by the malt. Overall bottom line is this is a pretty poor IPA English or otherwise, it just lacks an assertive hop flavor and the bitterness it does have is negated by the overtly sweet malt finish, caramel is too high. I recommend trying anything else but this if you are looking for a decent IPA, the hops take a backseat which is dissapointing."
"Copper colored brew, largely clear but with a bit of haze. Small white head proves fleeting. Scent has a lot of caramel malts and some nice bitter hop. Nice caramel maltiness, a fair amount of bitter hop, kinda has a unique taste to the water too. Not to say that its watery, just that its a individually noticed ingredient for some reason. Mouth is pretty full and smooth. Kind of a unique brew in its own regard, not too bad."
"O= great nose but just not quite balanced in the drinking. Grassy belches. Still a worthy beer, probably great with burgers and similar, doing fine with some hot-pepper chili and crackers at the moment. [That was last night-- tonight it's doing not too badly with peanut butter on soda crackers]"
"O - Not at all what I was expecting, but Id say Im pleasantly surprised. The next time I hear someone say "" I dont like IPAs"" I know what beer Im handing them, this is a very easy IPA to drink."
"Drinkability is pretty good and easy at a simple 6.2 ABV."
"Overall one of the better beers that Sea Dog offers but it's still not that great. They are known for low alcohol ""drinkable"" "session"" beers and wanted one a little bigger. Kinda missed the mark for mine."
"12oz bottle of ""Kennebunkport IPA"" from Traders Joe. Pours copper with a short lived white head, lots of carbonation. Aroma is perfume hops and biscuit malt. Medium, oily body. Not very sharp. Flavor of biscuit and caramel malt with a medium, lightly hoppy dry finish. Not a bad beer for the price, but it is more suited for an ESB than IPA."
"Very clean and easy drinking. Not spectacular but a good. Very drinkable."
"Enjoyable English IPA, I am learning that I seem to prefer American IPA hop profiles than EIPAs, but seems liek a solid example of the style."
"I really like the finish on this one, nice balance."
"This is a mildly hoppy IPA. I'd describe it more as a more earthy IPA than most. Modest head and minimal lace; solid amber color and relatively clear. It does have elements of a British style IPA, such as the more muted hop flavors. Pleasant but not special."
"Drinkability: This is a very average IPA that almost drinks more like a regular pale ale. I do not get the hoppy bite that I am accustomed to with this style. It is not overly distinguishable. One is enough."
"Sampled at a beer tasting at Barb's Beer Emporium on July 2, 2009. The pour is amber with a beige, foamy head. The aroma has a sugary sweetness about it, whcih makes sense since Sea Dog specializes in fruity beers. But this one was not fruity. The taste was more sugary sweet than hoppy like most IPA's. I could drink this one because the hop bitterness is more subtle."
"Poured with a small, off-white head, and a light amber colored body. Good carbonation, slightly hazy. Good hops smell, maybe a bit malty as well. Pretty good hoppy taste... not the hoppiest IPA I've ever had, by any means, but not too bad either. Again, there's notes of malt in there as well. Slight lacing left on the glass. Overall, not the worst IPA I've ever had... it has potential, but there isn't a whole lot to set it apart from other IPAs. Reliable, but slightly boring."
"Ran into this on cask at the new Sea Dog Brew Pub in South Portland. A slightly hazed copper-amber color with a good off-white head and modest lace. The aroma is very faint and hard to pin down, just a vague wheat grass malt at best. The flavor is a very mellow blend of cotton candy malt and floral/herbal hop bitterness. It's very smooth with just a slight hint of carbonation. It's quite drinkable, somewhat like an English bitter. The bitterness doesn't hit hard but it prevails tastefully. The sweetness suggests orange and pear syrup. A decent cask offering."
"This beer pours a deep clear amber, with a 1 finger off white head. Head receded very quickly, not much lacing to speak of. Nose is of citrusy hops and faint malt. Taste is very bold, but not brash citrus hops, that are well balanced against some pale malts. It's not a typical IPA - and may border more on an APA but it is a very drinkable beer. Definitely one that you can sit with for a session."
"Dark orange amber with a fizzy,light tan head that leaves a little sticky lace on the glass. Smells fruity and buttery with some imported smelling hops. Tastes fairly bitter up front with caramel malt, citrus and sweet fruitiness leading to a crisp and somewhat buttery finish. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Pretty average EIPA."
"Off the tap this beer was a true amber color with a khaki-colored, two-finger head. The retention was good especially as a clingy collar that left good lacing in 'torn curtains'. The aroma was dry and piney with some herbal elements as well. The flavors were similar, piney and resin-like hops (Simcoe?) with some woody elements. The malt backbone was not quite big enough to stand up to the hops and it thus lacked balance. Distinctly bitter without sweetness. The mouthfeel was good, the carbonation fine and the acidity high."
"12 oz from Trader Joe's. Pours light amber with a short off-white head. Floral, citrus aroma of hops and some strawberries with caramel. Light mouthfeel. Hops are on the sweet side. Slightly soapy. Decent malt back, but adds to the sweetness that ends up taking away from the overall taste."
"Goes down very easy and would make for a nice session beer."
"Moutfeel is smooth and medium bodied. I'm liking this one a lot. Way better than the rest of the Sea Dog beers that I've had. Not a huge fan of their fruit beers, but I would buy this again."
"D = This is drinkable but enough about it is either problematic or simply too mundane to make me really want to come back for more."
"A decent beer, but nothing more than average. Copper color, medium off-white head, with a fruity aroma with mild traces of malts and hops. A little too sweet and could stand to have more hops. Calling it a true IPA may actually be a stretch, this seems like more of a Pale Ale than an IPA."
"Drinkability: So-so as far as India Pale Ales go. While the buttery component certainly didn't help this thing, it, in my opinion, didn't necessarily hurt it."
"this looked great in coler and smelled nice but as an ipa this one is lacking thunder, it starts out great and finishes well but is a bit off in the middle. thiss one isend as bitterb as i like my ipa's, all and all bthis is better than any macro brew, thiss one i will drink agan if it crosses my path"
"Overall this was a solid effort. Not the best IPA I have ever had but I cannot really knock it in any way. It was very smooth and a good solid session beer. I would love to try this one on tap and I may in fact go back and try this one again some day."
"Bubbly and thick feel. Milky on the palate. A strong but remarkably balanced IPA. The malt really holds its own here. Heavy, but not extreme. Less an IPA than a strong ale with some hops."
"Drinkability is solid, a pretty good IPA, and again I was in Maine, so I had to drink a Maine beer and it was good choice."
"Poured a beautiful mohagony w/ a 3-finger head that took a long time to disappear and left some lace patches. Minor hops in the nose, with some caramel or something in there also (even a hint of bread/bisquit malt). This beer was lighter on the hops than a normal IPA, but it seemed a little heavier on malt. Not syrupy, but something like caramel or butterscotch seemed to permeate, and there was a dry finish that reminded me of coffee/roasted malt. Some fruity noted derived from the hops, but this beer just seens a little unbalanced. Still a good beer, but not an IPA for a hophead."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and not too thin. Drinkability is ok. Not a bad beer..nothing memorable either."
"D- This beer is good for just catching up or passing time by the beach or poolside."
"I'm pretty impressed by this IPA. Most beers of this style rely on the hops for flavor but this IPA is geared more toward the malts. This brew may not be great for IPA lovers but I really like the flavors of this one. I'd consider this more of an EPA than an IPA."
"The beer pours an amber color with a towering offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It's sweet to the nose with just a bit of bitter hop aroma. The taste is average. It's got a heavy dose of caramel malts that cover up the hop taste. It's mildly bitter with a Ringwood yeast fruitiness. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average English IPA. It's way too malty for the style."
"Yet at the end of the day, certainly mine, this is a fairly decent IPA whose brewers (if I may psychoanalyze) seemed to think that larding down an IPA with lots of hops doth make a sterling IPA. Not so; it's how the hops interact with myriad ingredients and flavors, combined with a felicitous texture for the palate, that make an excellent IPA to me. This isn't bad, to be clear. It's just a bit one-dimensional, keeping it from moving into the upper echelon of IPAs. Still, not hard to enjoy."
"Hop it up and add more resins in place of the apricot and malt, and it could be better. Sea Dog seems to rely on their fruits too much, and if that's the case, stick to flavored wheats. It's no Dogfish Head Aprihop either."
"If you're hoping for a good amount of hops, this will disappointment as an IPA. But as a beer without the title of IPA, it is a good overall beer, more balanced than it probably should be."
"In cask at the pub in Topsham. Dark amber color with a thick white head that was fairly sticky. Mostly a floral/pine aroma, with a little malt in the background. Citrus flavor, again the slight taste of pine. Not overly hopped. I think this would be a good session beer."
"Sea Dog Old East India Pale Ale pours a copper color with a thin off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a mild hoppy aroma, the flavor is kind of a nice hop flavor, a nice backbone of caramel malt, and perhaps a touch of diacetyl. Much better than I expected. Worth a try, probably sessionable."
"Not sure who in Maine decided to call this an IPA, but it hardly resembled that at all. At best, I would go a Plae Ale, and not even sure if there were enough hops for that. Not a bad beer, just not an IPA."
"D - had two and was happy. Great for a dinner with friends or a few at the bar."
"Poured this brew from the bottle into a frosted mug and it had a nice thick head with plenty of lacing. Poured a nice copper color. Nice taste and mouth appeal, good clean after taste. I think you could call this a nice session brew. I'll definitely drink this again."
"Drinkability: Well, I have five left.... what now? Not impressed."
"what the hell is this?"
"Taste is similar to smell with naught but late, weak hopping. This is too sweet and barely an IPA. Texture is decently crisp with a snapping finish. With so many good IPAs out there, why bother with this one?"
"Cheers"
"D - It tasted okay, but it just doesn't match up with the style. It really doesn't taste like an IPA, English or American."
"12 oz bottle best by November 2007. Pours a dark clear amber with two fingers of off-white head, good retention, decent amount of lacing. Nose is a slight bready malt, a touch of butterscotch, very subdued. Taste is full of buttery diacetyl, some slight tea-like bitterness, really not very good at all. Didn't even finish this one, it's not even a mediocre IPA, very disappointing."
"D: A diacetyl mess. One of the worst IPAs I have had. I am no hop head but this doesn't taste like an English IPA. If you are looking for a domestic take on the English style IPA try Cooperstown Backyard IPA."
"Mouthfeel was thin to medium. Medium carbonation."
"Pours a beautiful copper color. Head settles and fades quickly. Smells slightly of citrus and pears. Tastes of mild hoppiness, a little citrus peel bitterness perhaps. Lacks the flavor of an American ipa/dipa, but also lacks thier sometimes overpowering bitterness. Body is somewhat lacking.A decent enough example of the style i suppose."
"Reddish copper color pour from bottle into pint glass. Finger and a half head dissipates quickly. Aroma is mild, but primarily carmel malts. Where are the hops? Bottle shows this as being a fresh batch, but the hops are nonexistant. More like a abbey ale than an IPA. Very sweet flavor carmel malts with very little bitters. Mouthfeel is a little too cloying. More sweet than anything. Not a bad beer, especially at $.92 (yes, less than a dollar!) at Trader Joe's, but nothing I would ever seek out."
"Medium-dark copper body with brassy edges. Topped by a thick, tall, creamy beige head. Recedes after a few minutes, but laces nicely. Nose is full of buttery malts, nutrasweet fruits, Twizzlers Cherry, and cardboardy, Scotch tape hops. Cherry Twizzlers leads off the palate followed by toasted biscuit malt topped with butter. Caramelly segue to a toasted, herbal bitterness. Maybe some mint in there too. Not bad, but I'm not wild about the Twizzlers taste. Light bodied, with a bubbly feel. Wouldn't mind if it were creamier. Not bad for the price (at Trader Joe's), but certainly not a go-to IPA (English). I'll stick with the Dragonmead Crown Jewels for now."
"Poured from the 'fridge into a Libby pint. A brilliant, hazey copper in color. A medium-firm pour produces a rocky, pale tan head of medium to lengthy duration and a moderate degree of lacing. Nose is acidic, yeasty, and brimming with a slew of American hop varietals - Cascades and Chinook? Seems a bit brassy/brashy, not quite as laid back as the style tends to be. Caramel malt on the nose seems a bit confounded. Malt and yeast cover the tongue on first sip, followed by a pungent yeast characteristic and fairly assertive bitterness. Seems creamy.Second sip brings out a bit more: notable malt and yeast interplay, bittering hops become brighter and less restrained, some aromatics developing. Dry, biscuity malt lingers along with the hop bitterness. Definitely creamy, coating the mouth and palate. Medium bodied. Alcohol isn't too pervasive, but it is there, creeping up slowly. Citrus notes from the hops are minimal, and seem offset by the yeast (Ringwood, either ya love it or hate it), but the malt really shines here, with a fruity, juicy character and mild notes of strawberry, grape skin, and green apple. The smallest traces of diacetyl do not detract, but seem to be more a functional component of the brew. Drinks a bit bigger than it is (to its credit) and definitely tastes better on the warm side. It's also more of a sipper than a guzzler, and I can appreciate that as 6.2% can occasionally make for a tough session. Best-by date of 7/07. Although I know that the British IPA style doesn't exactly float American boats, it's still nice to see an established Maine craft brewer return to Minnesota. Can Cabin Fever be far behind @_@ ?"
"Amber/red body that is just slightly murky with about a half an inch of head that dissipates slowly and leaves a fair bit of lacing. Smells hoppy bittern and citrusy. Tastes hoppy, but almost just as malty. Some bitterness, some citrus in the hops. Malt almost has a roasty or caramel quality to it, though I can't quite put my finger on what it is. Medium in body. Flavor is just a little watery, though not as much as it is in some Sea Dog offerings. Probably the best Sea Dog beer I've had thus far. Most interesting, flavorful one to be sure. Not what I usually expect from an IPA (tastes a bit more like an APA to me), but exceeded my expectations."
"I wasn't all that impressed with the two Sea Dog fruit beers that I've reviewed and can say the same for Old East India Pale Ale. It's nice to see an American brewer make an attempt at an English-style IPA, even if that means that they simply substitute Goldings or Fuggles for Cascade. This one is decent enough, but that's as far as it goes."
"I really don't want to dislike this brewery because I love my Maine roots, but aside from the blueberry wheat I have found everything from them to be completely mediocre to bad. I suspect now that if it wasn't for the blueberries in the blueberry wheat I would have lost all hope in Sea Dog."
"Pours amber/orange good lacey head. Aroma is faint earthy floral hops with a touch of sweet malt, bready. More malt flavor than hops, bread,biscuit and caramel notes. Bitterness is to balance and nothing more, could use a little more IBU's. Medium body nothing great or over the top. Over all not bad fairly drinkable and for $4.99 for a six pack a great deal!"
"Despite the sweetness it does not leave the mouth in a sticky state."
"D-One of the most drinkable beers Ive ever had, watch the numbers though, due to being and IPA it has slightly more alcohol and packs a larger punch."
"Very drinkable, plays well with food, and at $5/6pack at TJ's it's easy on the wallet. I had to finally get a review in, if only because I always have some around."
"Drinkability: Again, it's a good deal, but not the best beer. Trader Joe's MO, it would seem."
"The Sea Dog Microbrewery and Restaurant in Topsham, Maine (not to be confused with their primary location in Bangor) afforded an excellent opportunity to sample some tasty brews. I immediately went for the cask-conditioned beer of the day, which on this occasion happened to be the IPA. It was served at room temperature as it should be. The beer arrived a dirty brown color with little head and a hoppy aroma with just a touch of sweetness. The first sip yielded a number of taste delights, none of them spoiled by over-chilling and all accentuated by the cask conditioning. I tasted caramel highlights, floral aromas, and a fine bitter edge balanced by the malts. Overall, a well-made beer served right."
"Appearance was a nice, rich amber color with pretty good head. Smell was fairly malty-sweet but with some hoppy aromas in there too. Taste was also fairly malty, with a bit of toasted character and a nice balance with the hops. Definitely more of an English vs. west coast IPA. Good mouthfeel, not too carbonated. A very drinkable IPA that hides its decent strength and whose balanced character should appeal to all."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is a bit static. Kind of hangs out on the tongue for awhile. Nice level of carbonation with a fruity smooth non bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is pretty good on this offering from Sea Dog, although I'm not sure I'd have many of them. There are just better ones out there, but worth a try."
"The smell is grainy and a bit harsh (even a weird indoor pool aroma) but it's not entirely bad. There isn't much hoppiness in the nose. It's a bit thin and pretty subdued in terms of taste. It's kind of watery, and almost tastes like a (literally) hopped up macro lager, though that's obviously a stretch. And the hops don't come through so much in terms of flavor as straight-up bitterness. But it's very drinkable, it's pleasant, and it's not a bad deal."
"Meh."
"Mouthfeel- Starts out dry and ends even drier. Lots of slitghtly moldy bread notes onj the palate. But eventually leads to a decent dry, bitterness end."
"Clear amber color with a medium thin white head and decent lacing. Very sweet aroma for an IPA, mostly caramel and malt. Medium body with earthy malt and floral hops flavors primarily, as well as a bit of citrus. The flavors seem a little unbalanced though. The finish is mildly bitter and fruity. Somewhat unique as far as IPAs go, however nothing stands out enough for me to feel like having this again."
"The aroma is big citrus, combined with a caramel malt. The taste is good with a medium hoppiness, but, a little light for an IPA. More akin to a pale ale like Sierra Nevada. There is a nice balance of malt and hops followed by a ginger spiciness and grapefruit. This is one easy to drink and not bad."
"I feel like this beer could use a lot more punch in its flavor, and a more substantial mouthfeel could help, too. That said, this beer could be good as a 'starter' IPA, less intimidating than some of the 'bigger' IPAs that are popular. This beer wouldn't be my first choice, but it is not a bad beer. It does seem like it might be a relatively accessible example of this style."
"A pretty good beer, at a really good price. This is a good entry point for the IPA Style. Poured out to an october rust like color, with a nice big foamy head. Some lacing. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of hops and citrus dominate, with hints of spice and sea salt. Nice. Taste was slightly complex, but full on loaded with flavor. Hops, sour malts, spice, citrus and herbs all had their moments in this brew. Bitter aftertaste was not overly powerful. Mouthfeel was ok, could've benefited from better carbonation though. A decent level of drinkability. For the price at Trader Joe's, you're probably not gonna find a better beer for the price. Definitly worth a try."
"Pours a light amber hue with a creamy, off-white half-inch head that sticks around for a while. Lightly carbonated. Aroma of sweet caramel malt and dry yeast, without any hops to speak of. More caramel malt on the palate, accented by a light fruitiness and a bit of a bready character. A touch of hop bitterness emerges on the finish. Nice medium body. Not the tastiest beer around, but quite drinkable."
"Overall, I am impressed by the quality and drinkability of this brew. Regardless of price, this is an eminently drinkable beer. It truly reminds me of the normal New England IPA's that I have been unable to find in the Midwest. Thanks T.J's for making it available and at such a good price!!!"
"Hazy copper colored with an orangey beige head that rises up a half inch, but runs away quickly. Aroma is not very hoppy, mostly sweet malts, ripe fruit, and some flowery esters. Flavor is initially malty, sort of sweet but doughey as well. This is followed by sweet fruits and some toffee. Also a bit of that alcohol metallic thing, but it doesn't detract, just let's you know it's there. But I must ask - where are the hops? I'm enjoying this beer, but it tastes like a really malty pale ale, a style I happen to enjoy. I also enjoy a good IPA, but I would never guess that this was one."
"Overall, definitely worth a try."
"Appearance is standard for an ipa...somwhat on the amber side. Smells of lots of sweet malt with not much of a hoppy bouquet. Intitial taste was somewhat alcoholic and fruity for me. Seems to be lacking desperately in aroma and flavor hops. Malts overwhelm the palate to such an extent that I feel I'm drinking a beer that is over 8% in ABV. Overall it is average at best and not an ipa that I would necessarily recommend. But for $5 a sixer it is decent buy."
"This beer pours a clear copper color with a medium sized dense white head. Good amount of lacing. Aroma has an orange citrus note along with floral spicyness. A bready precense is there as well. This beer is really balanced, almost too balanced. Starts out with a sweet caramel flavor then turns to prickly floral hops. There's a slight astringency in there that some would dislike but it didn't really bother me. This beer is fairly juicy. Reminds me more of an ESB than an English IPA. Finish is dry with a slight citrus note. This could have used a little more bitterness and less sweetness but it really was not too bad. Worth a try."
"Poured a mahogany brown in color with a thin head that hung around for a bit. No lace, but I think that is a result of the glass beeing too clean. The nose was straight malts and hops. The flavor was not as hoppy as I expected. More smooth than biting. Finished a bit sweet. The mouthfeel was close to crisp, but finished more watery. Still a very easy drinking IPA, definitely English and without the American hop craziness."
"Reflection: This was a decent beer but not as bitter as I like my IPA's."
"Pours a brilliant deep copper with a modest, light tan head. Some hoppy bitterness on the nose, but a sweet, malty component seems more noticable. Palate is a myriad of flavors; hoppy spice, rich malty sweetness, and a creamy yet mildly metallic finish. A very mild hop character for an IPA. Mouthfeel is dry and effervescent up front, with a slightly sweet, coating finish. I am not sure what to think about this one. Good for the price ($4.99 for a sixer), but would not make this a regular in my house. Recommended? Flip a coin."
"Throws a light pumpkin orange hue with a thin, tan head. Mostly malty nose, some biscuit and hop aroma to be noted. Nearly full-bodied; crisp hops, biscuit/toast offerings on the palate; razor sharp hops slide down the hatch. Citrus notes and some spices; bordering on an APA; pretty decent and Sessionable."
"Copper-trimmed amber with active effervescence feeding a head that transitions from bubbly to foamy and lasts and laces nicely. Sweet, bready malts more than balance the hops in this fragrant but soft nose. Taste is similarly balanced with hop bitterness (never overly strong) giving way to smooth sweetness. Mouthfeel is likewise smooth and full, neither chewy nor oily. Markedly better than Sea Dog's wheat."
"Drinkability: A decent session beer, but it's lacking compared to other English IPAs."
" I paid $4.99 for a six pack and I feel this could be one of my better deals in a while."
"It poured a deep amber/copper color. Slightly hazy, with a huge thick foamy head. The hops did a nice job managing the lace, it tracked my progress in the glass with rings for each sip. The aroma had some mild fruity esters in it. The taste was very fruity (summer citrus) with a bit of malt and a floral finish. Did I detect a hint of spice in this beer? ItÂ’s not as hoppy as I was expecting, the malt seems to balance some of the hops. It had a medium/heavy mouth feel, and a medium drinkability."
"An enjoyable brew. I may be back in Bangor within the next month or so. If so, I'll certainly stop by again."
"(0.84 / 12 oz bottle) ($4.99 / 6-pack)"
"Mouhtfeel is fine with good carbonation per style. Drinkability is also good as this one is poundable and would make a good session beer. Maybe IÂ’m used to a little more assertive IPA, but I still enjoyed this beer."
"This is an excellent IPA that I found to be more in the American style. The label states that this is ""Hand Brewed and Bottled by Pugsley Brewing LLC in Portland, Me"". I saw several of the ""Motley Crew"" sampler boxes in groceries on the Maine, coast the week of 7/19/04, so it seems that Sea Dog is alive and well."
"This pours out a clear amber color with a good-sized white head that faded to a cap of bubbles rather quickly. Decent lacing was left as well. Aroma is quite odd, as the malty sweetness seems to almost completely overcome any hop presence that is there. Mainly a sweet caramel scent comes through with earthy hops tones thrown in as almost an afterthought. Not bad smelling just not what I have come to expect of an IPA. Taste is similar to the smell but with the hops taking a little more of a role but still not taking control of this beer. Caramel and fruits hit you first in the flavor before the balancing but a bit weak hops come through with a nice bitter taste. There are also notes of spice as well. Mouthfeel is pretty good about medium with good carbonation. Nothing stopping you from downing several of these unless you are looking for a more hopped IPA. Overall an above average beer that could use a little more hop and not a bad deal at 5 bucks a 6 at Trader Joes."
"Drinkability Â– Seems more like an ESB than an IPA. It is drinkable, had it not been labeled an IPA, and instead a pale ale or ESB, I would have given it a higher rating in the taste category."
"This IPA pours a bubbly orange-amber with a modest, tight off-white head. The smell is potent--hoppy and underscored by distinct citrus and pine hints. The taste is not as tangy as I might have expected; the start is bready/yeasty, there are some sweet esters (subtle rose hips and rasberry), and the hops come through too late. The finish is weak. The mouthfeel is good and smooth, with the right touch of carbonation. All told, a worthy choice."
"Please Sea Dog, either make this unfiltered, bottle conditioned, or both, because that yeast needs to stay in there to smooth out that nasty finish. Take a lesson from Middle Ages, please. This would be a favorite of mine if the finish were corrected."
"Pours a clear copper with a small but persistent head that leaves a fair amount of lace. Aroma is a mixture of toasted malt and some spicy herbal hoppiness. Flavor begins slightly sweet, with caramel and citric notes, then has some balancing herbal bitterness. Flavor isn't very complex, and could use a but more hops to be considered a really good IPA. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy... almost like drinking a cask-conditioned ale. All in all, not a bad beer, espcially considering that it cost $4.99 for a sixer at Trader Joe's."
"This beer poured with a nice big fluffy head with big fluffy bubbles which only lasted a short time. It was a clear copper color with a gentle hop aroma which seemed more floral than fruity. There was not any lace to speak of. It had a medium body to it. The taste was a pleasant floral hoppiness, but not ultra present. There were some malty undertones, which actually became more prevalent as the beer warmed up. The malty undertones left a nutty aftertaste, also particularly as it warmed up. This is not the most striking example of an IPA, however, it was still very drinkable."
"Drinkability is good. This one should carry over well to the general drinking public."
"I'd call this beer a ""commodity"" IPA."
"12oz. bottle: There is a nice, clear copper color to this one. It has a bit of a head. The aroma has some citrus and malt to it, but is a tad light. The taste is medium-bodied, with a bit of bitterness. Could be a bit more hoppy. I also think it is more of an ESB. A good drinker, nonetheless."
"Overall this is an average IPA, but thats ok, it is easy drinking"
"Average. Not horrible, and certainely not great. Pour was a slightly cloudy copper color, with a clean aroma. I thought the taste was rather fruity: seemed like 1/2 grapefruit, 1/2 beer taste...almost like the taste came from juice and not hops, very strange. Interesting floaties in the beer at the end as well, I hope it was yeast. pat"
"Clear classic copper color. Little head, disappeared quickly. Carmel light fruit peach/apricot & orange. Toasted malt with sweet(cascade?) hop taste. Taste disappeared quick though. Lite creaminess & kinda syrupy. Watery to some extent, Surprised by the ABV. Not ruhing out for another one , but not on my do not bother list."
"It has a little fruity smell of oranges and apricots. You can also smell the alcohol. The taste is bitter with alot of hops and alcohol with a hint of oranges and apricots. Not a bad beer, it has a good bitter taste but the alcohol taste is a little to intense for me."
"From a 12oz. bottle, best by Feb 2004. Pours a sparkly, light amber with a half inch of head. Nursed this one for about an hour and the a nice head remained, some lace but quickly dissipates. Smells of hops, pepper and cinnamon. Taste is sweet and malty but quickly gives you a strong bit of hops. I found it extremely hoppy but that may just be because heavily hopped brews are difficult to come by in Maine. A medium body with legs, aftertaste lingers on the palette for several minutes. Certainly drinkable but a bit too hoppy to be truly smooth. A very good product from an underappreciated brewer (at least within Maine.)"
"Served on draught at the Clarke Cook House in Newport RI. A clear deep gold in color with a thin white head. Faint hop aroma and a bit of citrus with malt in the background. Light bodied and effervescent. Flavors not really big but a well balanced IPA. Are cascade hops the only available hops up here?"
"Great looking appearance when poured.Thick creamy white head sitting on top of a dark amber IPA.Head reduced leaving thick sticky white lace surrounding my glass.Aroma of hops with a strong malt presence.Very bitter hop finish with a long bitterness that lasts.Thicker in terms of body than most IPA's I've had.Less malt and more hops would balance this beer right out.Overall avergae IPA.Mouthfeel needs some work and had no real feel of crispness.Kind of watery which is surprising because of the maltiness."
"Limpid deep amber to burnished copper color on the pour with a planetary sized head, the structure frothy, the color a light tan and the lace formed a thick and clinging sheet. Nose is sweet malt, under pined by a light hop aroma, citrus crisp and clean. Start is malt rich, sweet, the top middling in feel with a prickly acidity, the hops pertinent, but not over powering, spicy but nice, quite dry lingering aftertaste. A fine quaffing beer, maybe a first timers American IPA?"
"Overall a nice IPA. Could be a bit more bitter for my taste. A nice change of pace ale."
"Notes: Not as hoppy as I expected from this IPA. Big on the malts and fruity flavours, and in comparison the hops played little more than a balancing role. Interesting, but it stops there."
"From my notes from my trip to Maine this summer. I just realized I forgot to review it. Deep golden copper clear color. Thick bubbly beige head. Smells were a combination of toasty carmel malt and lots of oily hop resins. Hop bubbles bust through. Great tasting oily hop kick, crisp and bitter. Fairly good malt sweetness finishes strong. Slightly thinner feel than I expected, but makes for a very drinkable IPA. I look forward to this one next summer if I make it back to Maine."
"382"
"Hoppy flavor with citrusy overtones and a bit of hazelnut maltiness in the background. Not as big on hops as I expected from an IPA, but very drinkable."
"  One of my favorite IPA's, right up there with Hop Devil."
"Carbonation seemed to trickle up forever, small white head. Oddly under-hoppy for an IPA IMO with hints of caramel on the nose. Good strength and considering that it was smooth."
"Notes: Not a bad IPA at all ... knock down the malt a bit or hop it a bit more and this could make for a great IPA."
"A nice IPA, not overly hoppy (what a shame) nice mouth feel, very drinkable.  This is a good basketball beer, drink some and enjoy the game.  A little more malt and a lot of hops and it would be perfect.  But then it would be something from Stone Brewing."
