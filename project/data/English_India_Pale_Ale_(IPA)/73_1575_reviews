"Decent IPA. Had a bit of an odd after taste. Not one of my favorites. I drank it right around the best-by date."

"I havent had it in a few years and I was generally offended by almost any pale ale or IPA then so I decided to revisit. Still a drain pour. First one in a long time, but this was just completely undrinkable to me. Seriously wondering if something was wrong with it. Although I have only had 3 English IPAs and the highest rating is 3.5, so I may not be judging to style very well. It had a May best by date. Aroma is just awful. It smells and tastes like an old, bad lager. Overly sweet. Like artificial sweetner. No hops at all. Just, bad. The only good thing I can say about it besides it looked good is that it is now gone forever. Soemthing had to be wrong with this bottle, or me. GL couldn't make a beer that bad. Afraid to try again. Good Lord, someone get me a Burning River quick."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 5/7/2015. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt notes; with great strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, herbal, floral, grass, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon/orange peel, pine, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky/resinous mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic English IPA style. All around awesome complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O- I like English style IPAs and this delivers. It's not a hop bomb, but the flavors come through and the hops hold their own."
"An interesting ipa from GLBC"
""
""
""
"Overall, I might try this again if I find a ""fresher"" bottle, because this one has not impressed me like other offerings from Great Lakes. I do have to say that I hate best by dating."

"Great Lakes Commodore Perry IPA brewed by Great Lakes Brewing Co.  Commodore Perry IPA has an ABV of 7.5%  This IPA pours out a deep amber color, with a small white head. The smell is rich with hops , grains, and malts.  There is a bitter sweetness in the smell of this brew.  The taste bitter with hops, grains and malts. This is a nice drinking IPA.  Commodore Perry IPA has a real nice balance. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. The mouthfeel is bold with bitterness and a nice clean finish. Overall I'm giving  Commodore Perry IPA a 4.25 out of 5. Great Lakes Brewing Co. did a nice job with this brew.  I would buy this brew again. This one of the smoother IPA on the market."

"There is nothing even vaguely English about this beer, I don’t know why it has been classed as an EIPA. It is way too fruity and off balance."
"o: this has more of a bitter kick than i expected.  there is a pretty heavy sweet presence in here that is cut pretty heavily by the bitterness.  not the best balance in here, but its tasty and refreshing"

"I drank this beer. My buddy brought it back from Cleveland. I can't do a quick rating for some reason so this is why I'm writing a dumb review."

""
""
""
""

"Overall, I'd have to guess this beer had some flaws during bottling.  If it was a homebrew, I'd say acytalaldehyde.  Only had one other beer from this brewery and it was excellent, but this one is not right."

"O:  Probably my favorite year-round beer by Great Lakes Brewing Company.  While I do enjoy Chillwave Double IPA and especially Lake Erie Monster much more; ignoring this beer or not giving it an excellent review makes no sense to me.  I don't know of too many fresh, unique tasting, and 7.5% ABV IPA's I can find here in Ohio that are $8.99 for a 6-pack.  Thanks Great Lakes.  Keep up the good work."

"Overall nice IPA...although it is classified as an English IPA here and it definitely smells/tastes like an American-style IPA.  Typical IPA color profile, citrus/floral hops nose, and crisp bitter flavor.  To me, it leans towards an extra IPA at 7.5% and ample bitterness...just short of a DIPA.  I would certainly drink again."

"A clear yellow gold / orange pour with a medium white head. Has aroma of caramel malt fruity with citrus notes, floral pine hops, yeast and mild bready notes. Taste same as aroma with some sweet orange flavors. A medium and smooth body. Has a very good caramel malt background with good citrus orange notes and floral pine hops on the end for balance. AN all around solid brew, very good well balance IPA."

"Truly enjoyed this.  Intensely hopped and mouth feel is crisp and good. Like the hoppy taste and drank two over about 20 minutes.  It was very good each drink and even tasting.  Like the citrus bite.  I will always drink this if the place has it draft or bottle."

"A very good IPA. Taste isn't too overpowering, and not too much in the way of hops (which can be a refreshing change these days). I would strongly recommend at least trying this one."
""
""
""
"I am a definite IPA fan and this beer does not disappoint, A great pour from the bottle or the tap. This beer offers a nice head that's not too foamy with an outstanding aroma with forward citrus and a hint of pine. Just the right amount of malt flavor to enhance but not overpower the hops. Excellent beer by Great Lakes."

"Overall: This is a bit too sweet than what I prefer in a ipa. Doesnt have that great bright fruit/floral hop profile I go for in the style. I prefer some of GL other beers, and I'm likely to pass this up for other IPA's. That being said, it's still quite tasty and enjoyable, especially for the price."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Unusual for a Great Lakes product, this seems rather non-descript. Hoppiness is noticeable only by the bitterness with no pronounced flower, citrus, melon, or conifer aroma or flavor. Perhaps I’m just used to the more hop-forward offerings in DIPAs and can’t recognize a basic IPA any more. For those who don’t want their palates destroyed by hop bombs, this may be a good choice."

"O- Its hard to pin this one down. Its definitely walking to the beat of its own drummer. The flavors are common IPA flavors, but they mix together to form something completely unique. For that I'll give it an ""outstanding"" score for the overall."

"Perhaps the musty grain malt flavor was an aberration and not all bottles hold this same property but it detracted from the overall taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic flagship type beer for Northeast Ohio. Some local seasonal beers will top it in my opinion, however, for year round availability it stands on its own as a go to beer. Its not overpowering but has great flavor that hides the fact it clocks in at 7.5% ABV."

"O- A wonderful rendition on an IPA and my favorite brew from Great Lakes Brewing. I'm glad I came across this one and will seek it out in the future. Great citrus notes, balanced properly and with personality."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from bottle into a jumbo mug. Beautiful golden color, nice head that settled fairly quickly. The smell is terrific. Kindve a fruity scent. The taste is heavenly. Definitely a very tasty brew. This is the first Great Lakes Brewery beer I've drank, and I could see myself going back to this, and definitely trying other Great Lakes brews. I enjoyed every bit of this. I've had 3 of these so far and I'm REALLY looking forward to the other 3 I have. Have one! Cheers"
"Why did I buy only one bottle? To test it out, but I could easily down a six-pack in a few sittings. No sign whatsoever of strength here when it came to the ABV and that was as testament to how easily enjoyable this was. While not as intense or full as other IPA's or English IPA's, there's so much to like here including the easygoing nature of this. Perfect for someone new to the style or willing to kick a few back without downing a ""hop bomb""."
"I'm sure I've had this beer before but I don't remember anything about it so this was like a brand new experience. Not sure why my expectations were relatively low, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. Not complex or groundbreaking but very solid and refreshing. I'd put it a notch ahead of IPAs like Southern Tier or Hop Devil, but not quite on the level of Troeg's Perpetual or Fat Head's Headhunter."

"Just go get it."

"O- Overall, a very well rounded and refined beer. This is always a great fall back when you crave a balanced IPA. At $33 a case it's hard to beat."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. Smell- Pine%2C grass%2C pineapple%2C citrus%2C grapefruit. Feel- Soft bodied. Good carbonation for an IPA. Helps contribute to the bitter%2Fpine experience. Taste- Bitter hops up front. Grass and pine cones come through. Bitter and dry finish. Solid beer at a fair price (%249.99 for a sixer)"

"Overall, a very, very good stronger ipa, great hop flavor, tilted towards resinous and earthy flavors, subtle malt flavors and good presence in the mouth."
""
"A great go-to beer."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, goldenrod coloring with a thin, filmy, sparse, white surface coating of head. Aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, and other tropical sweet and tangy, with a mild resinous character in the backbone. Flavors are tangy sweet tropical fruit and mild spicing, with roast characteristics and cut grass highlights. More on the tangy side by far, but well balanced overall, and very drinkable. Mid-bodied, but slightly effervesced from the carbonation. Tangy sweet and slightly rich aftertaste, with a subtly dry, slightly bitter finish. Very well rounded, very drinkable English IPA. Tasty."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours clear golden with one finger head. Aroma is sweet fruits, lemon rinds, orange rinds, a bit of tropical fruit. Pear, orange citrus and a nice lingering bitterness from the hops, maybe a bit of pine lingering on the palate. Dry finish with medium light mouthfeel and medium high carbonation. Drinkable IPA and a very nice example of the style."

"Overall - A delicious IPA (Gold Medal Winner, World Beer Championship)."
"Overall - a very good ipa, another solid offering from Great Lakes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great Lakes doesn't make a style of beer that a fawn over but the actual beers they do brew are incredible. I'm not an IPA guy buy any stretch of the imagination but this beer is worth drinking even if you're not a hop head. 7.5% higher than the average IPA it is chalked full of carbonation when poured into a glass. Great amount of head where you know the beer is fresh. The first impression is that it starts clean meaning not overpowering hoppyiness, and finishes with a hint of citrus. Golden in color. Overall an excellent choice."
""
""
"out again on future sojourns to local beverage dispensaries."
"Medium bodied, lighter than expected carbonation. Warming and surprisingly smooth. A very good IPA, indeed."
""
""
""
"A subtle IPA all around. A clear paler gold with a creamy white head with decent retention. Significant lacing. The aroma is dialed back with only slight caramel notes. The taste, while also subtle, is good. Caramel and slight floral notes. A little thinner in the palette with a slight fizz to it. A good IPA that's easy drinking despite its bigger abv."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall/Comments: An all around excellent beer from GLBC that is amazingly well balanced and easy drinking. A fine example of the style and a must try IPA. Classified as an English IPA @ 7.5% ABV. Consumed 8/3/2013."

But my preference for GLBC beer is primarily because the beers are almost always outstanding. Cheers!"

"Really malt heavy,,, bitter hops used.. Pours a clean crisp gold hues very clear... it is crisp dry fiunish with rich bitter hops taste....theere is little to no head.. it is somewhat rich and thick but not overwhelmingly... overall a great IPA but not my style im more into the fruity IPA.. great bitter hoppy taste... with dry finish..rich malty overtones... great englsh IPA..."

"Taste starts out slightly sweet with caramel notes. Slight hop bitterness at the finish. Light to medium bodied with good carbonation. A nice change from American IPAs!"

"Great tasting ipa.I believe I will look for this beer again.Excellent citrus aroma and strong hops flavor.Not surprised though it was the last of its stock on shelf.the hops flavor was near perfect bitter,that I enjoy. but also just sweet enough to compliment a great steak."
""
""
""
""
""
"A smooth tasting and overall good IPA that goes down well. It does not carry too much bite as an IPA and I would bet that it would be an awesome beer to go with a steak or ribs. This is easily my favorite of the beers from the Great Lakes Brewing Company. Give it a try."

"Poured into the glass with a nice head. Smell had citrus notes, but caramel malt prevailed, especially for an IPA. Taste was malty with a significant bittering hop profile. Mouth feel was outstanding! For me, a substantial beer (7.5% abv) in alcohol content and flavor that establishes this beer as a ""stand alone"" more than a session. Great Lakes does it again :)"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall- A little citrusy for an English IPA, not a bad tasting beer. Good amount of caramel and bready grains as it warms."

""
"O - Simply a delicious beer, bordering on a tasty DIPA. I'm impressed at how easy it is to drink, as no alcohol is detected. Lots of hop flavors to pick out too."
""
"Taste I found to be quite balanced and enjoyable. A slightly above average dose of citrus hops with some citrus peel finish and a hint of malt. A rather full mouth feel for an English style. Overall, I found this beer quite a pleasure to drink."

"Overall, this is another good beer from Great Lakes. It's up my ally for IPA's to where it's one of my favorites of this style. In a paragraph above, I mention about this beer leaving me with a sense of accomplishment, well it did, but now I want to accomplish something else, so I'm going to get another one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a second rating. Great Lakes has reputation in my house for making exciting and exceptional beers and this one, lived up to my expectations. It approached outstanding but the alcohol was too prominent on the palate for it's abv. The nose on this bottle was sweet and juicy, fragrant and fresh. My first rating was on 6/28 and the total score 3.38. If Great Lakes was not such a favorite of mine I would never have sought out the additional bottles to compare. So glad I did."

""

"Classic IPA taste without being heavy despite it's 7.5% ABV. Excellent balance of hop bite and smoothness. Nothing showy...just really well made ale. My only complaint is that I don't want to stop drinking it. This can be not a good thing. Love this ale!"

"If you didn’t tell me, I would think this was a Double IPA. I guess at 7.5%, it maybe could push towards that, but the maltiness I guess confuses me. This is a fantastic beer for the style. It’s hugely hoppy, but there’s also a great malty breadiness about it. I really love this beer for doing what it does despite being 2% ABV under other Double IPAs I can compare it to, like their Alchemy Hour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: Will re-review when I get a chance, bottled 12/24/12, way too old for an IPA or any beer really, but I decided to drink it anyways, wasn't going to review it but it was still decently hoppy and enjoyable, so I went ahead. I've never had a bad beer from Great Lakes, even though they're from Ohio, and this was still a great IPA after 6 months, can't wait to get my hands on a fresh one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty standard EIPA. Mellow but notable hoppiness. Easy drinking, although a bit dry. Hoppiness isn't overpowering but there's barely any malt to back it up. Not bad."
""
""
""
"Although I prefer and AIPA over and EIPA any day, this EIPA trumps a great many AIPAs that I've had. The grapefruit is there, but it's not intense; for this brew, that's a good thing. This has just the right about the bitterness, and you can definitely taste the alcoholic content, more so in the aftertaste. I would definitely get this again. This is what I want from an English IPA."

"Appearance is a orange-straw color with two fingers of fluffy head. The nose is distinctly hoppy, but also spicy as if there might be some rye in this offering. The taste and finish match the nose perfectly - bitter and spicy. This is a very good IPA that does not easily fit in the East Coast /West Coast definitions of IPAs."

"Great Lakes is just a solid brewery, period. Commodore Perry is proof that they know how to stick to a tried and true formula for a traditional style while still putting a nice twist on it to stick out from the pack. While not a mind-blowing, earth-shattering IPA, I'd rather have Commodore Perry, which can absolutely hold its own with such a great sense of balance."
""
""
"A nice sharp floral/herb bite up front, followed by biscuit malt notes. Ends crisp and dry with lemon. This is an easy drinking IPA, it has some big flavor, but it sneaks up subtly and is well balanced. The alcohol presence is a little sharp - otherwise it is very good."

"Overall: this is the first IPA that i have truly enjoyed every sip of. I love the bread flavors that come through and the fruity beginning. definitely a must try for the quality and price"
""
"I wasn't expecting much from this IPA, but was pleasantly surprised. It's visually appealing, and pours a medium gold with a thin head that slowly trickles down the lengths of the glass. The nose is loaded with sweet malt, a little bread, and subtle hops...not it's best quality, but not unappealing by any stretch. The Commodore is sticky, sweet, and nicely balanced with ample piney, bitter hops. A little too much carbonation distracts from the thick, chewy texture."

"For being well past it's suggested prime, it surprisingly wasn't bad at all. Just not exactly what I was looking for, and to be fair, not what the beer is really meant to be. Despite that, the quality of the beer a year and a half past due is such that I'd be excited to try this one fresh. I will make sure I seek this one out when it's back in season, and my review will be subject to change."

"Poured from 12oz bottle into becker. Slightly cloudy light yellow with a thin white head that flattens quickly but then sticks around. Thin but sticky lacing. Smell is malts and relatively calm hops. So far, just as would be expected from the tamer breed of IPAs. Taste defies nose, with a good deal of hops, finishing crisp and clean with lingering bitterness that keeps you coming back for the next sip. Mouthfeel is surprisingly fizzy and full. An excellent English IPA."

"What's with all the apple flavors? This really isn't what I look for in an English IPA. It tastes strange, but is still rather easy drinking."

"O: Delicious IPA – good hop and malt blend."
"Pours a golden yellow color with a finger or so of head at the start. Thin film of head left on top of the beer through most of consumption with a small amount of lacing present. Smell is hoppy - piney yet fruity. Taste reveals more of a sweet and fruity hop flavor. Nicely balanced and for a strong IPA it is not too bold for those that are less into IPAs."

"D/O: This classic IPA shows some elegant qualities indicative of fine attention to detail on the part of the brewer. Like some other aging recipes such as Bridgeport IPA or Stone IPA, this one is still able to bring it, perhaps in its ability to appeal to one's sense of nostalgia."

"O- Meh. Not bad but there are way better beers available to me in Chicago IMO"
"what a beer! this is the best work of great lakes i think. the pour is orange and clear, caramely and lucrative, lacey white head. dank nose, lots of fruity hops and some odd dried fruit aroma as well, maybe cherries or something more exotic, some english malt in there somewhere too, but this is a hop bomb, bordering on a fresh hop brew with high alpha and resin content. the flavor is consistent with the smell, where is all this fruit coming from, and how the hell is this beer pushing 8% abv? its so delicate and nuances it cant be that strong can it? almost acidicly bitter in the finish, but there again is that semisweet dries fruit complex that keeps lingering. enough carbonation and only a medium body i could drink this until the saturation point without much trouble. i think easliy the best great lakes offering ive had the pleasure of tipping back. a real treat, and something different finally in the american ipa world."

"No head really on a cloudy amber orange body. Aroma of nondescript citrus and earthy hops with toasted malts. This one is really piney and grassy and some very tart orange. It takes some time to get used to. Also has a toasted malt base. Floral notes as well. Moderate to high carbonation and medium body. I like this beer it's just hard to drink for the first few sips. The pine is resilient though and you never get completely used to it. I also feel its a little over carbonated."
""
""
""
""
"Pours copper with a small off white head. Aroma is wonderful, sweet and fruity (tangerines, grapefruit and melon). Nice flavor to match, starts out sweet with some malts and the fruit, followed by a nice hoppy bitterness at the finish. Great balance of flavors, and it has a nice tart yet subtly sweet aftertaste. Leaves a nice lacing after every drink. Excellent, unique take on an IPA."
"Overall a very nice English ipa which hides its abv very well."
"Pours a clear amber with honey gold highlights. The two finger cream color head has great retention and leaves behind a good amount of sticky, splotchy lacing. Grassy, herbal, and a hint of citrus blossoms on the notes. Opens with mild bitterness, bready with toasty caramel accents embedded in the very noticeable malt bill that slowly gives way to a dry, crisp finish dominated by grapefruit rind bitterness and hints of alcohol. Medium bodied, smooth, and well-carbonated. Very enjoyable and extremely well balanced. As a fan of English IPA's, although this tends to be a bit more bitter than most, this is one of the better examples readily available in my area."

"crystal clear straw colored body with two fingers worth of white creamy head and ample lacing. smells of sweet malts, a little herbal like mint and lemon verbena. taste is pretty simple, nothing complicated or too overpowering. just a nicely blended ipa with enough malt backbone to balance the hops. mouthfeel has good carbonation but the body seems a little watery for me. not overly bitter or dry on the finish. overall i like it and it's easy drinkin, but just don't know if this will be a staple in the fridge."

"O: there is honestly nothing that stands out about this beer in terms of flavor, other than the fact that it is a remarkably well balanced IPA. The taste is an excellent blend of malts and hops, and I'm not one to complain about 7.5% ABV. Definitely a solid delivery."

"At long last, I finally get to try something from Great Lakes Brewing Company!. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours the brightest copper I have ever seen with a two and a half finger white head. Leaves a great amount of lacing. Smells of exceptional hops along with distant pine, oranges and grapefruit. Pineapple also comes through if inhaled hard enough. Basically smells like a very sweet fruit basket. The taste is predominantly pine, with a decent amount of banana coming through. Slight orange, some odd wheat, and also some odd soapyness come through as well. The motuhfeel is of strong pine with a bit of lemon zest and ever so slight orange with a moderate amount of wheat. Overall, this is a great IPA with lots of flavor, although the odd soapyness kind of ruins the whole deal for me. Would I buy it again? Yes, although it cannot hold a candle to mad hatter."

"Overall: A very satisfying beer with a very effective balance of hops and malt. A repeat buy without a doubt."
"On tap, the commodore is even better. The head seems creamier and lasts forever in it's fine lacey perfection. One of the outdoor festivals I attend each year has had this (along with a number of other goodies) on their beer trucks. I'll keep coming back for the music and the quality draft beer. This is one to get if you can."
""
""
"O - Not very well-balanced as the taste gets overrun with this weird corn-like quality. I am not sure where these notes are coming from. The hops are there but it is also sweet so it would be a stretch to call it an IPA. I would much rather have their Lake Erie Monster DIPA - it is a more bold yet traditional beer. This is not the delicious experience I have come to expect from Great Lakes Brewing. It may be an issue of freshness, but on the bottle it says to enjoy by 8/14/2012."
"Would never known it was 7.5% abv. A great drinking and tasting english style IPA here. Very good stuff. Another winner from Great Lakes."
""

""

""

"A- This beer is a slightly hazy golden orange with a slight off white head that lasts all the way down. The aroma is all hops, a lot of citrus and astringency. The taste is bitter and all about the hops. There is a ton of citrus, skunkyness, and astringent notes. The malts don't really come through in flavor but do come in nicely to the feel part of the beer. The feel of this beer is there and is quite bitter, a drinkable beer for its size. A pretty decent IPA, this is a little brother to the lake Erie monster."
""
""
""
""
"D: A bit like a winter seasonal beer (with spices and malt) but with refreshing and diverse fruit qualities. Tasty and fairly complex."
""
""
""
""
"Medium golden pour, huge off-white head, quickly dying down with good lacing. Smell of earthy hops, grapefruit, and somewhat sweet - perhaps brown sugar or something similar. Taste is very bitter compared to the nose, hops are somewhat unique in their funkiness, with an herbal taste that fades quickly into a clean citrus. Mouthfeel is average for an IPA, though not as balanced as I'd like. A solid brew, but my least favorite Great Lakes I've had yet, theres just too many competitors in the region that have a better balance and depth, for me, to recommend this as an IPA over others readily available."
""
"O - Very dynamic better, and very bitter for an English IPA. Really dig the herbal and earthy tones."

"Overall: a decent enough beer, but its flavors are muddled and not ideal."
""

""

""
"Overall, a tasty IPA but a little less malty than I was hoping for from an English IPA. Still, the malt that is there fits well and all in all, I would have this again."
"Pours a bright golden color. Extremely heavy on the malts, though the after-taste resembles citrus wrapped in a tootsie roll. Nicely balanced. Tastes better than it smells -- but that's often the case for English IPA's like this. A recommended purchase, though Great Lakes has produced better."

"Over all this is one of finest IPA's in America. I would buy this ale again and again!! Cream of the crop."
""
""
""
"A fine enough IPA that is malty and hoppy with notes of spice and stone fruit but too boozy for its own good."
"O - A tasty beer. A bit maltier and less citrusy than I usually like IPAs, but tasty nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
"O- Surprised I've never tried this before. I am more of a West coast American IPA but this was enjoyable."
""
""
""
"Semi-hazed orange-ish amber in color just like most other IPAs on the market, a slim ring of foam for a head, some minor lacing left behind. Aroma and flavor both contained an very high amount of orange and grapefruit peel to pine resin ratio over the top of a balancing toffee malt. Hits the sweet-bitter balance and really close to the smoother texture / medium carbonation I prefer in my IPAs. Mainly this one is memorable for the citrus peel focus over other kinds of hopping."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great-smelling and decent-tasting English IPA, but seriously missing that 'sling-one-back' drinkability that usually forgives any sins (flaws) to the brew. Still recommended. Perhaps falling short because I had a sip of a tasty Penn Cheeky Yinzer earlier this evening. 3.5"
"Overall, what we found to be most enjoyable about this brew was the blend through the nose, and the follow through in the taste. This beer had the perfect amount of syrupy sweetness to complement the lightly toasted malts. The fruitiness and fresh hop qualities put this one over the top, with every category being stylistically sweet, even, and robust."
""
""
""
"O: Gotta be honest -- wasn't expecting much from this beer. And, it kind of blew me away. Great Lakes only recently came to NOVA, and I had heard a lot of good things about the brewery, and it delivers here. Great beer -- so tasty, so drinkable."
""
"O - When I took my 1st few sips, I thought it was a very citrus forward IPA, but then as I worked my way through it, I noticed it has a huge bitter aftertaste"
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a decent beer, but not great. when consumed directly out of the fridge, i enjoyed the balance and the hop content that was complemented by the fruits. but as it warmed (within 12-15 minutes), the balanced was thrown out of balance, and the fruit notes really begin to subside making this beer less desirable."
""
"Pours a clear honey orange with a foamy beige head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and some spicy and peppery hop aromas. Taste is the same with a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good IPA but I like the way it smells more than the taste."
""
""
""
"O-easy drinking IPA though not worth it if others are available. worth a try though."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Very enjoyable and a nice beer but probably too hoppy/bitter to be a sessionable beer in my opinion. The citrus hops are really highlighted in this offering."

"My first English IPA, and it does have a different feel and taste than the American IPAs that i have been tasting. I am enjoying the multifaceted taste as the other flavors of the brew pull the hops into a nice balance. Well done."
"O - This is a very good and enjoyable IPA. It doesn't overwhelm, but it doesn't try to. Recommended if you want a basic IPA to enjoy and have a few of. After trying some of their other offerings, I can say that I'm very happy to have Great Lakes in Virginia now."

"Clear golden color with a tight, creamy looking white head on top. Pulpy citrus and melon hop aroma...dried fruit, herbs, and wood as well over a hint of cereal grain. Sweet grapefruit and pine flavor from the US hops contrasted by the leafier, somewhat vegetal, Fuggles. I'm not sure it's a combination I would have used, but it ends up pretty tasty all the same. Slick, oily, zesty, and bitter, it is undoubtedly an IPA, but I suppose somewhere in the grey area between American and English. Pretty good, though it just doesn't wow me in any way."
""
"Pours a peachy gold with a fat fluffy white head and tons of needlepoint beading. Smells nice - bits of grapefruit and orange peel backed by slightly nutty, bready malts. On the tongue, it’s less aggressive than many others of its genre. Without knowing, I’d probably label this one an American Pale. It’s satisfying, nevertheless. Nicely balanced and drinkable."
""
""
""
"O- one of the few beers from GL that I am not impressed with. Tastes more like a Hefewiezen than an IPA to me. Not one I would seek out again. Pretty disapointed as a matter of fact."
"Pours a deep, burnt amber color with good clarity. Head is only moderate, even with a vigorous pour, and disappates in short order. The aroma is fantastic--fruity, clean, and just enough pine to grab your attention without overpowering the gentler scents. The flavor is pretty much what you would expect from a solid IPA--bitter, fairly piney, without a whole lot else going on. Pretty good as far as IPA's go, but they aren't a style I typically enjoy, so I can't give the taste a ringing endorsement in the grand scheme of things. Overall, a nice yet unremarkable representative of its style."
""
""
"O: Good. Not my favorite, but a solid, consistent IPA."
""

"I love Great Lakes and I also love IPA's so I found this beer to be amazing. This brew has a nice straw color and nice two finger head that laces nicely down the sides of the glass. There are some light citrus notes present on the nose. The taste has a nice and light hop spiciness that fits the alcohol content very well. I buy this brew all the time and would recommend this one to anybody."

The mouth feel is great and overall this is a excellent English IPA."

" Thick sticky lacing throughout the drink. Smelled of strong hops with a touch of fruits. The taste was nice and bitter with the hops strong and dry at the finish. Somewhat like two hearted only not the grapefruit tones. Mouthfeel was medium to slightly thick while going down smooth. Very drinkable and i could feel a slight buzz after savoring a glass for about 15 minutes. This was very good ipa with a nice balance of flavors and not too expensive. $7.99 a six. I will definitely pick some more of this up as it's about $2.50-$3.00 cheaper than two hearted and very near as good! Nice job Great Lakes!"

"This beer poured out as a copper color with a foamy white head on top. The lacing was sticky and held a good retention. The smell of the beer has a more earthy hop aroma than a citrus one. The taste is like the nose, it's a much more mellow IPA since it's heading in the English direction. The mouthfeel of the beer remains drinkable and well carbonated. Overall this beer is a good, I feel that it's not my favorite IPA out there but I like something with a little more kick to it. I feel this is a good IPA for someone who might be looking to try this style to get a feel for where they can go from there."

"Trying the Great Lakes Commodore Perry IPA....""Dont Give Up The Sip""! Great motto! The beer pours a clear straw yellow with thin white head that is lacing in my pint glass. The smell is has a apricot/citrus base with subtle spice. The taste is powered by hops....it starts very bitter, then a apricot shaunters in followed by more bitter. There is a tinge of metallic taste and the ABV is not fully masked. The mouthfeel is a full bodied ale with good carbonation. Overall it is a taste beer and highly recommended. This beer definitely is more English IPA than West Coast IPA."

"O: A solid IPA. I usually don't care for IPAs, but this one on I would try again. If you drink out of a bottle, be sure to wipe off cap area. Has the standard Great Lakes rusty top taste even after a wipe."

"Great Lakes does not disappoint."
"Overall - It's a refreshing IPA that's easy to drink. In terms of IPAs, there are much better ones out there. If you're not into IPAs, I would say that this is worth a try. For those who want a stronger IPA, you probably won't be blown away by this."

"One of the best brews I have had. Incredible taste that is very well balanced."
"Starts off like a rich amber ale but then a peppery hop flavor takes over. This is smooth IPA, which I attribute to the thick body. There's a fruity sweetness that brings an interesting balance to this brew."
"O- A good, not great IPA. I won't reach for it often but would like to try it on tap."
"O- A good enough beer, but it didn't live up to my expectations."
"It has a light body, and sits lightly on your tongue. Very drinkable, and still bitter. What a balance!"
"Pours a deep amber color that borders on copper with a smallish white head that shows moderate retention and lace. Smells of earthy, citrus and piney hops with a solid caramel and bread malt backbone. The taste holds no surprises that the nose couldn't ferret out. Caramel and bread assaulted by earth pine and citrus. I was a bit surprised to see this listed as an English style IPA as I saw lots of American in there. Medium body and carbonation level with a sweet honey like mouthfeel. Great IPA, I wish it were a bit easier to get in my corner of the planet."
"The beer has a very nice, dry, hoppy flavor with an underlying creamy malty sweetness. There's nothing new or earth-shattering here. Nobody's getting too fancy. It's just a simple, well-executed American IPA. Not the best I've had, but very good and a terrific bargain where I shop. Bravo!"
"Cheers!"
"Note: Tasted on 1/20/2012. Freshness date 3/15/2012."
"Well done, Great Lakes."
"D - this is a pretty solid IPA. Even though it was past it's freshness I thought it still packed a hop punch that would have been there if it was fresh. This is only the second beer I have had from GL, but I have been very impressed from what I have thus far..."
"O: Very easy drinker. Good example of this style. Another excellent beer from Great Lakes."
"Definitely worth a try and is highly recommended."
"Solid beer (no surprise from GLBC) and a nice change from in your face IPA. I wish they sold in Indy so I could buy regularly."
"O - I've said it over and over again.. The guys at GLBC really have it together. The image of creating just one world class brew is one thing, but for a brewery to hit the world class mark in a variety of styles is something to hang your hat on, and it's something for me to tip my hat to. This IPA can stand up to any in the world. Europe and the U.S. Atlantic coast to the pacific, and everything in between. One of the best IPA styles I've ever had."
"this is a very well made ipa. definitalely a celebration of hops. not what i would call perfectly balance, nor sessionable."
"Notes: This beer is not a clone of anything. It is one of a kind as if Great Lakes decided not to just assemble a by the numbers grapefruit and pine IPA. I am not a Hops expert but did they assemble their own unique blend for this beer? This is a craft beer drinker's beer, meaning an experienced drinker will recognize the thought that went into it's construction. In general I love Great Lakes Brewing (along with Brooklyn Brewing) as being my favorite brewery. I'm not sure however I love this beer. Certainly it is not love at first sip. I think my relationship with this beer needs to develop..."
"Pours clear and medium gold with lively, cascading carbonation. A thick, foamy, spongy white head leaves behind some clumps of lacing behind. The nose shows citrusy, grassy hops over pale caramelized malts. Flavors turn a bit more resinous, with substantial grassy hops and sharp grapefruit outweighing a basic caramel malt background. The medium body is smooth, dry, and spicy in the mouth. Finishes with biting bitterness as the sharp hops surge forward on the close. A bit basic though."
"Randall"
"can't say much that hasn't been said already. one thing about this beer is it is remarkably sessionable, which is kinda scary considering the 7.5 abv. The beer feels rather thin for an ipa, and i think that's what makes it go down so easy. get a 6 pack, stay home, and enjoy."
"Orange amber pour with decent lacing. Smells of grapefruit and pine needles. Taste has a caramel sweetness to it, and a good amount of citrusy hops as well. Not over the top hoppy for a big boy IPA (7.5 abv), sorta balanced actually. I suspect this beer has some age on it. Oh well. Mouthfeel is thinnish, carbonation may have faded a bit along with the hop profile. Finishes sweet. Overall a good IPA, and if I see this on tap somethere I'll certainly try it again."
"I can see this being a decent stand-in for my Northeast staple IPA’s like long trail, harpoon, and my all time favorite mayflower. Though all that bitterness makes it a bit less sessionable than what I like to see in widely available, standard pub IPA such as this."
"O: Went down great on a nice hot day. 4"
"GROSS! I dumped it while frowning."
"Overall a solid IPA"
"Overall - A great IPA. Around here in Ohio this can be found for ~$8.99/6-pack, so compared to other out of state brews, this is not only a good beer but a pretty good deal as well."
"D - Disappeared quick, wish I would have brought more back home with me. Great rendition of a delicious English style that is under-appreciated here."
" Overall I enjoyed this and would recommend.I will buy more.I think great lakes is a very solid brewery."
"A rather unique IPA. Distinct and hoppy, and while I love hoppy beers, this isn't really quite what I look for in them."
"O: This beer looked amazing, but thats where the great qualities ended for me. The smell was weak and the taste was just off. The first beer from Great Lakes that I have not liked."
"One of the best beers I've ever had. Great Lakes has added another flagship to the fleet, and its' Commodore is Perry."
"Overall not a bad beer it is enjoyable and there is nothing wrong with it but it is not memorable."
"Overall, an excellent beer, but I wouldn't call it an IPA."
"Overall: This beer is fairly good overall, has a very dry finish with citrusy notes that are both bitter and sweet"
"-This beer is so lively and intense with each swirl. I could drive through a six pack with no problem. juicy hop burps. mmm one of the better english style IPA's fo sho."
"An excellent IPA, if not a bit up-front hoppy and sweet to be considered a true English IPA. Nonetheless, tasty, and one of my favorite of the GLBC offerings. Grab one for sure!"
"Very good IPA although more caramel malt that I normally like in the style."
"O-> This was a nice reprieve from my usual IPA suspects that are always in the fridge. Not that there is anything wrong with them, but this was a nice change-up. Really liked the tropical fruit with a floral and pine resin bite that was blended smoothly with a nice malt backbone. A great take on an English IPA"
"Though quite malt-centric, this beer still has a strong hop signature that lends it nice complexity. Surprisingly sweet in that first rush of flavor—there’s a lot of caramel coming through in this one. With 7.5% ABV, this beer provides a nice kick without a significant ""rubbing alcohol"" taste coming through. A beer that I’m sure I would come to appreciate more with further tastings."
"Overall - well done Great Lakes. Yet another beer I need to stop overlooking at the store simply because I have had it numerous times."
"D/O- I don't know why I passed this up for so long, even as Great Lakes is one of my more favorite breweries. No longer. Solid, solid, solid IPA...likewise with the brewery."
"O: An expertly crafted, exceptional IPA with excellent balance -- it does everything very well."
"This beer has a thick rocky off white head and a bronze colored body. It is a good looking beer. For an IPA I thought it had a wonderful malty smell that reminds me of biscuits. The flavor is nice it carries the traits of the hops without an awkward bitterness. It has a medium mouthfeel with some carbonation bite."
"O--Not the best. I like my IPAs to be hop bombs, but this was way too malty for me."
"It was poured in a 16 ounce glass, and looked amazing. Very dark, and rich. Smelled exactly as it looked. The taste was fascinating in every sense of the word. I will definitely look to grab a bottle next time I visit home...I have had a strange craving for one ever since I tried it."
"Overall: Its an OK IPA. Not loving the hops profile. Now looking at the Great Lakes website, its bittered with simcoe and flavored with fuggles and cascade. That explains it."
"Overall, it was a good EIPA. I enjoyed the sweetness in this one and for some reason would liked it to have a little more, maybe some honey?"
"Nevertheless, its a goodin, and should be drank by all."
"Medium mouthfeel with very little notice of the alcohol. Overall, not my preferred type of IPA but a solid effort and very drinkable."
"Total: 4.08 A-"
"Overall - This one goes to show you that English IPAs can appease those who prefer typical West Coast American IPAs. With that said, I think my overall rating has to be about average (3). This is not something you'd catch me drinking on a regular basis, but it is a nice English IPA offering and I would have it again. Overall, worth a try."
"this beer is perfect for any bbq or bonfire or een a mow of the lawn. well priced and easy to drink."
"Overall: I have not had a GL beer that disappointed. This is one of the best. I was really surprised. This was a fresh bottle and the flavor rivaled that found in Two Hearted. This vaults up to my top 2-3 IPA's list and given the pricepoint, will be a regular."
"O: Very tasty and enjoyable. Good English-style IPA."
"Quite quaffable, nice finish."
"O. Good representation of the style, pretty easy to drink. I prefer American IPA, but will come back to this English style IPA occasionally."
"D – Good tasting brew, lighter tasting brew than expected but still pretty enjoyable. None the less a well balanced brew that I would have again"
"Commodore Perry is a damn good English IPA, but I guess it also doesn't have anything that really piques my enjoyment of it."
"O- I personally love a strong taste and full body to my beers and IPA's represent just that philosophy in a brew. I thought this one was excellent. It might be a touch better for some people if its Bitterness was a point or two lower, but of course that just isn't the style intention."
"A very nice, well balanced beer. Pours golden with a fine white head. Smells sweet and malty but married beautifully with citrusy hops. The taste is similar, but much more hop forward. Lovely notes of sticky pine, and a very nice finish. I love how everything comes together with this beer, the sum seems more than its parts. Just a great beer for sipping on the back porch on a warm spring day."
"Serving: 12oz bottle poured into pint glass"
"Overall it was worth the wait to find a fresh bottle of this but I feel it probably would drink rather well even beyond the best by date. Still it may be best to find the freshest you can and I would appreciate finding this in a variety case or a six pack (fresh) for around 10 bucks. Solid IPA"
"overall - while i prefer american ipas to english this beer stacks up well and would be in my rotation if it was distributed in my area"
"Mildly carbonated and slightly oily in the middle. Finishes up a little warm."
"Would like to review this with a newer bottle, still pretty solid English IPA."
"Easily drinkable at 7.5%. Not as robust as others, but still a good brew and one that I would pick up again. This kind of reminds me of an ""ESB"" only a tad more bitter. Nothing overly complicated. Just down right enjoyable."
"Overall I can't complain, because mater gave me this as an extra. It did have a citrus hop nose and tongue I wouldn't spend my money on this one but that's cause I've had my shot. It is worth a try at a reasonable price."
"Warrants buying a six-pack. A rare thing. Alcohol is only felt as a soothing belly warmth. It just takes one to put you at ease."
"O: A very good english IPA, fits the style perfectly but also provides a good overall IPA taste"
"Overall: Very enjoyable, will certainly revisit. It could even be seen as a good intro to IPA beer for those friends you are looking to get into craft beer."
"Clean and crisp. Not as hoppy as I had hoped, but a good IPA nonetheless."
"Overall: Very tasty and well balanced IPA."
"Overall it was very balanced and very easy to drink. It wouldn't be a problem to sit back and enjoy several at a time."
"Overall - I was very impressed, actually. It's no wonder this beer is one of the best of its style. Definitely showcases a lot of hoppyness. I was impressed. Good work, Great Lakes"
"Overall it was a very nice IPA, not the best that Great Lakes offers, however, it was good."
"O: A pretty solid English IPA. Nothing exceptional about it, but far from bad."
"O - Not a bad beer, but a little too sweet for my liking. Got through it easily enough though."
"Pours out a pale straw yellow color characteristic of the style. Has some head to it, but what strikes me more is the smell. This is probably the maltiest IPA I have ever had. Has a huge fresh bready smell with some tangy ripe fruit hops in the nose. The taste is more of the same, but quite balanced for such a hoppy beer, some sweet, toasty malts but with clean bitter, grassy aftertastes. I would describe the hops as mostly herbal, slightly citric and dry almost like a pilsner. The hop profile is more English Bitter to me than APA, less emphasis on the Cascades more on the balance between malt and bitter hops; interesting. Mouthfeel is rich yet pretty smooth. Overall this is a unique interpretation of the style and a nice change of pace for an IPA in a world of Cascade infused hop-bombs."
"O - Overall a fair IPA, but not one to write home about. A good beer, but far from the best Great Lakes has to offer. Does a good job of hiding the 7.5%"
"O- A really nice beer that is easy to drink. I am wish Great Lakes would ship to Delaware and/or Maryland so I could get this more often. I feel this is a great everyday beer."
"O - very approachable; easy to drink while still being a contender in the IPA world; not shy"
"O: Fairly drinkable. The bitter aftertaste will slow you down a bit. Overall, this is a very tasty beer that I won't pass up on my next trip to Chuck's in Bowling Green."
"D: Highly drinkable, it's just so tasty!"
"Overall: I'm not sure if I would revisit this in 6 pack form, but I wouldn't mind drinking this at a bar. It didn't have a standout taste, but there was a well-defined flavor. Worth checking out."
"A good beer at any point in the rotation."
"Taste: Thick body, notes of chocolate, caramel, and toffee. Crisp floral and citrus hops with a lingering bitterness that is balanced well with the malts. Ends dry with a sharp bitter hop flavor."
"You can smell the hops when the glass is still several inches away from your nose."
"Best by 4/25/11."
"D: One of the better English style IPAs that I have come across."
"At 7.5% ABV you get a pretty solid hit for an IPA; there is a definite alcohol taste, but it actually balances against the malt and hops profiles."
"Overall, this is a good tasting beer. This would pair nicely with a homemade pizza. Definitely something I'll get again."
"At any rate, an excellent brew. Highly recommended."
"D: Extremely drinkable; this one goes down easily, quickly, and with plenty of enjoyment. The hops might not be out in force as much as in many American IPAs, but Great Lakes used the English style to make this beer hugely drinkable- background malts (hate to call them that, as they're good in their own right, but I'm really digging the hops here) balance the hops flawlessly."
"Overall, a very tasty brew and one I would look for again."
"Real tasty beer another great lakes winner and just good all around."
"Hazy orange with hops and fruit in the nose. The first thing I notice in the taste is some malt but the hops certainly make their entrance known with a fruity finish. The aftertaste is lingering bitterness and peach. Pretty dry, too. Hops are pretty big, but not so much as to make it undrinkable. I've had more aggressive and less aggressive IPAs. I like that there is some complexity other than a hop bludgeoning and nothing else."
"drinkability - wasnt sure what to expect with this beer, it didnt over impress but was ok."
"Cheers"
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Bitter and hoppy with light citrus. You can tell it is brewed with good-quality hops. This is definitely a sipping beer. And don't you dare give up the sip!"
"D: I might be able to drink 2, but IPA's aren't my mug of beer, so.. As with most GLBC, you cant really feel/taste the ABV (7.5!), so could be dangerous. Another good beer for the spring/summer."
"D- So so drinkable. This beer goes down so well, such a good mix of sweet and bitter. This is the beer that pushed me over the craft beer edge, and it is as good now as it was then."
"Onced served on the glass its appeal its very enticing. The first taste its a little too Hoopie. when you are on your third fourth sip you don't taste the hop as much. Once your glass is empty you want more of this unique tasty beer. The smell is great and fresh."
"D: Two or three especially with food would be very enjoyable."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass (and on tap as well). Poured a deep fiery copperish red pour, with a small head that dissipates to a film and coats fairly well. This beer looks fiesty, just by its color. Aromas are hoppy, floral and citrus weighing heavily on the palate. Taste is similar, an extreme bitterness balanced with nice grapefruit citrus in the body and a more mellow finish that still rings in with a sturdy citrus bitterness. Touches of pine and resin are hard to find, as this is a major grapefruit tartness bomb. A pretty good IPA, with a malt profile that loses itself in the grapefruit."
"Drink - I prefer the more fruity/juicy pale ales, but this is still a solid brew. It reminded me of the pale ales made my one of my somewhat local brewers - Les Trois Mousquetaires."
"overall...my first impression was that this was a balanced beer, but after two bottles it's apparent that this is a bitter hop bomb of a beer. nice to try big IPA's that use noble hops in abundance. recommended."
"This is truly great beer, a shining example of the brewmaster's art. It has all of the best qualities of the style in abundance, and flavor that never quits. When I have a glass of this I want my mouth to never be empty. Yes, it's smooth and easy to drink, but more importantly it's bursting with flavor that's not only devoid of unpleasant aftertastes, but actually leaves behind a subtle craving for more. Can't get enough!"
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew"
"Overall this was an OK IPA. I am glad I finally decided to try this one and I would by it again."
"A great beer here...and DEFINITELY worth a try if you are into IPAs, in my opinion, this beer is one of the best examples of the style I've had the privilege to try."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink but not what I was expecting in an IPA - still a decent brew non the less ."
"Very underrated IPA. Although it's different from alot of American IPAs, I don't really see this being an English IPA, although I see how one can think that. Bottom line, great IPA, unique, recommended."
"Another very nice beer from Great Lakes. However, I can get other great IPAs to quench my hop thirst."
"Grapefruit taste up front with grainy malt giving it some body. High ABV is noticeable, with alcohol/vodka flavors rising up quickly. Smells of grain and grass with slight citrus. Medium body at first, but thicker after it washes down. Some rough edges with paper and dry grass. A good IPA; not great, but good enough to stick with as a ""go-to"" when better options are much more expensive."
"My first taste of Perry and my initial reaction is that it's a Hop Devil clone, which isn't bad at all. A very typical east Coast IPA, light in color, nice head, a better nose than hop Devil. I'm not sure I could tell the difference blind folded, and a really decent brew. Maybe a tad bit sweeter on the finish, and it's a little cheaper. Not earth shaking as I prefer the grapefruit citrus hit where this one is thick, viscous, piney earthy kinda IPA. Worth a try IMO."
"Perhaps quality has drastically changed because I know you guys on here give really honest reviews."
"Easy to drink, good beer."
"Comments: Glad I got to try this one. Might not be the first one I reach for in the future, but it wasn't bad and is worth a second drink."
"I could drink this stuff all day. It's dangerously drinkable for its 7.5% abv. But I'll (try to) stay in control tonight."
"D - A good IPA but I've had ones that are easier to drink."
"Easy to drink for those who like the style, can (and have) do several of these in a session if I'm not going anywhere for a while. The ABV sneaks up on you, the flavors mask it so well you forget it's even there. An excellent rendition of a classic style."
"Overall this is a go-to IPA around Northeast Ohio - easy to find and reliably tasty. Great Lakes really does not make a below average beer."
"D: Solid IPA, I could have a few, but need time between beers."
"D - Not hard to drink at all, i could spend an afternoon here."
"What, no love for big brother Matthew and his forcing open of Japan? I say boo, sir! Anyway, this younger sibling pours a clear light amber topped by a fairly short-lived cream foam. The nose comprises mild pine, flowers, light greens, and subdued toffee. The taste ups the ante with the flowers and pine, adds a decent amount of orange peel, and tightens the leash around the neck of the toffee. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a pretty good EIPA, but it's way too one-sided for my liking, with the hops coming off as a tad harsh."
"Overall, worth a try but there are better out there. In fact, Burning River Pale is a better representation of a hoppy beer from this brewery."
"Drinkabilty - I love this beer, and having it fresh on tap was even better. This might have been the best tap beer ive had yet. Everyone that drank it agreed it was like we brewed it in the room, then poured it in a glass. Cant wait to get more, many more. Only reason im not giving it a 5 rating, is cause well it is 7.5% alcohol and you must be careful"
"Drinkability: A very pleasant and well balanced IPA. I do like the citrus flavor. Two or three max due to the bitter end, but very enjoyable."
"This beer is incredibly drinkable and is a terrific example of a brewery showing some restraint with the style. They created a great IPA that does not destroy your palette after a few beers. Definitely a winner!"
"Overall I would say this is a good session beer if you want to drink a lot. But if you are looking for a true IPA as a treat, there are plenty of better IPA's out there."
"D- wow this is super tasty and a good example of the style from a Yankee brewery of all things. Easy drinking and enjoying."
"This is great beer. Pours light orange with one and a half fingers of head and some moderate lacing. The smell is hops and citrus, specifically some grapefruit, with a mild floral presence. This is a good balance of sweet malts up front and bitter hops to follow. This has always been one of my favorite IPAs, and one of the first for me. My only criticism is that it is pretty sweet, but at a high proof and strong amount of malt, that is expected. It is medium bodied, and im down for another...but the 7.5% will sneak up on you."
"All in all, this is a good beer. Not great, but good to try for an IPA if you have access. It has a unique fruit twist on an IPA."
"D: Definitely one of my favorite beers to drink. It has a pleasant smell and taste that goes down smoothly. For me, at least, it's a top-notch IPA."
"More reviews forthcoming. Like I said, happy to be back to reviewing. Most likely tomorrow will be a review of East End Fat Gary's Nut Brown on draft from our new kegerator!"
"The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma is bread, flowers and oranges. The flavor is more of the same, with a lot of flower and perfume-flavored hops, some oranges and bready malt. Low bitterness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: Really loving the flavor of this one. Everything else is pretty standard. A great beer, easy to drink and very flavorful. Thanks again Jon for this great brew!"
"D - Took me almost 45 minutes to finish it so definitely not my ""glass of beer"" but if EIPA is your thing then definitely try it."
"Drinkability....Yes,both tasty,refreshing,wet and at a price/abv that's no problem. While this can be a beer with subtle elegance in the details, it's also a good brew to just swig on a hot Ohio summer afternoon."
"This is somewhat of a hybrid between an American and English IPA it seems. Well-done and drinkable overall."
"overall i really enjoyed this beer and will come back real soon. a nice big bold highly hopped english ipa with a distinctive american twist."
"Mouthfeel was huge and I don't see myself drinking more than one of these in a sitting."
"Yet another winner from Great Lakes Brewing Company."
"Overall: If you like grapefruit (especially the little dividing walls), then you will love this beer! It tastes identical to the fruit. It is a bittersweet treat and even though its not drop-dead delicious, it is an extremely drinkable and bold interpretation of the classic style."
"D-I've really been enjoying this beer recently. It's a very flavorful IPA, while still retaining some refreshing, drinkable aspects. Keeps me wanting to come back for more."
"Got my hands on a six pack of this from my mid west connection. Poured into a goblet, pours an orange amber, decent lacing. Nice citrus aroma, but with a malty backbone. Has a slightly metallic aftertaste. Overall I liked it, but not sure if it stands up to the other beers from Great Lakes."
"M/D: Crisp and clean, not super heavy. I enjoy this ipa, well balanced."
"Taste-wise, the juicy, grapefruit hops definitely come through. Very hoppy from the get-go....not a shy IPA here. The sweet malt base is also noticeable, but is pretty hidden behind the bitterness. Bitterness lasts quite a while into the finish and aftertaste too. It may not be THE most bitter IPA I've ever had, but it's among the top."
"All aboard, mate! The pour sailed out of a bottle with a slightly darker-than-apple-juice color. The fresh aroma of ""dry"" beer and fruit blockades any other scents from making birth into my nose. All in all, Commodore Perry's brew has a very commanding taste as there's an upfront dry hoppy flavor that puts my taste buds in a knot. Eventually, they quickly lift up anchor and give way to a fruity aftertaste. The mouthfeel is about average, so I wouldn't say it outranks other brews, but I haven't had anything that I would say is leagues better either. Drinkability factor good, I can't fathom why I waited this long to try it."
"Definitely not a session beer due to the alcohol, but one that I'd happily go back to repeatedly. Very drinkable."
"D: Decent drinkability factor, some dry warming pine and citrus notes come in late to save this of its dignity. Moderate enjoyment, nothing that I would seek out or probably drink in multiples."
"Great Lake Commodore Perry is a little short of greatness. The color is good, it's a orange hued amber with white foam that settles to a thin white layer. The beer smells minty and citrusy from hops and a little fruity from yeast. The taste is very complex, it is sweet with apples, grapes and pears upfront with a tinge of bitterness that gives way to a mouthful of toasted whole-grain bread that only gives way to a drying bitterness in the end. After the swallow, the bitterness lingers with the warming astringency of alcohol. I think if the alcohol was less obtrusive and hop flavor was more assertive (not just bitter), then this would be a far superior beer. As it is, it is very good, but turning down the malts (and booze) a little on this beer and letting the hops shine a little more would be a benefit."
"A really impressive effort from Great Lakes, as this one hits the spot on nearly every category. For a regular IPA, Commodore Perry is tough to beat."
"D: at 7.5%, this ipa drinks quite nice. I've had this brew many times over the years and have learned that when fresh (which this pint is), this is one of the more solid IPAs available year round. Another solid brew from Great Lakes."
"This is a very drinkable IPA that masks the ABV well. It's not as hoppy as I would like, but, at the same time, the lack of over-the-top acidity of a lot of IPAs is well-received."
"T- Lots more of that grainy, mealy malt stuff going on. Hops come and try to redeem everything right at the last minute. They give a nice juicy citrus flavor that lasts only briefly. The end is bitter and citrusy."
"D-very smooth no hint of the alcohol even though the abv is north of 7 and it makes you want another one when your done."
"D - Not available enough but would drink often otherwise."
"D= A great IPA for sure. With all the IPAs on the market however I'm not sure how often I will be visiting this one. Worth trying once though."
"It's what I would think of when I consider an east coast IPA, which I suppose it basically is. I also would think of it as an IPA from before the ""lupulin shift"" that was brought upon us by beers like Pliny. Overall solid but maybe in need of an update or tweek."
"O: Decent offering. Not something that I envision to be a ""go-to"" but nothing I would shy away from in the future."
"Overall, a solid beer but it pales in comparison to some of the best in class. I like it for what it is, though: a very accessable, reasonably priced, quality ipa."
"D - A very drinkable IPA.. I could definitely make this a session beer."
"Update. 24 hours later. I had 4 beers left. Cracked one open, poured it into the aforementioned goblet, inhaled the aromas,sipped, and decided ""this is better than I first thought."" IPAs are challenging, especially to a first-timer. This is an IPA I would recommend for a first-timer. It has grace notes of what should be expected of IPAs, the pine, grapefruit,lingering bitterness, citrus and citrus zest, but in small doses. Enough to introduce the flavors one can expect, without the full frontal assault of, say, Avery's Maharaja (a personal favorite)or even Green Flash or Stone IPA."
"For under $8 per 6-pack, this IPA tastes like a more expensive ale; I'll get more."
"drinkablity- easy to drink, bitter with decent flavor which only gets better with a few drinks."
"I wish there was more carbination, maybe my pour was too aggressive, but i poured how i always do, in any event a lighter and brighter mouthfeel would have done alot for this. not bad but not what i want."
"D: Great Lakes does it again. All of their year round offerings I've tried are simple and easy drinking."
"It isn't bad, would've enjoyed it better fresh but sometimes what can you do?"
"The mouthfeel is buttery but pleasant; this makes for a pleasant sessional quaff when below deck with the cabin boy - who will someday be a cabin man. Another victory from Great Lakes!"
"drinkability is hurt a bit by the off flavors and aromas that though they don't dominate, are a hindrance to the overall experience. Not my ideal IPA by any means."
"Pours a clean yellow to orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, mellow grapefruity hops. In the taste, bitter grapefruit and a bigger malt balance. A citrus hop bite and medium mouthfeel, with a semi dry grapefruit/ citrus hop aftertaste. Nice big hop, quite balanced, almost a big pale ale."
"This is one of those IPAs under the radar, that should be mentioned whenever one speaks of great hoppy MidWestern IPAs. And I'm just trying it for the first time, myself. High sessionability, for those with high lupulin tolerance, we hopheads."
"Would definitely have another, although, take caution as this one can sneek up on you in a hurry."
"D - Easy going down and very enjoyable, not too high ABV so you can enjoy a few with no worries."
"On tap @ Buffalo Wild Wings in Ashtabula Ohio. Clear honey amber body with a nicely retaining vanilla head. Good lacing. Aroma boasts citrusy and grassy hops atop some bready and caramel sweet maltiness. Taste has a prevalent grapefruit like hop bitterness softened by notes of citrus, caramel, and fresh grain. Nicely balanced and highly drinkable."
"Sharp, crisp mouthfeel with a moderate level of carbonation as one would expect from an IPA and easily drinkable. Overall not a bad beer, but not the best example of an IPA. Normally I'm a huge fan of Great Lakes, but this one I could take or leave."
"Drinkability is ok, I would seek out something new long before having a second one."
"Medium to full bodied, creamy, smooth. The carbonation is good. Pretty good overall, but I would like this better if it was not so sweet, and if the biscuit flavor/ aroma were gone."
"As an American IPA could stand a bit more in the hop profile, but honestly that is just competing with the market and hop overload to a degree. I found this beer to be immensely better than the Great Lakes Erie Monster. Definitely would purchase again, a solid IPA worth the effort."
"A new IPA for MN, so I had to give it a try. It's plenty tasty, pretty good balance between sweetness and bitterness. Almost DIPA in strength and taste. Definitely worth a try."
"D: Very light and drinkable for 7.5% ABV. Another great IPA."
"This beer is light copper with a white head. The hops are mild in smell for an IPA. The aroma is citrus fruit smell. This beer is well carbonated and the hops/bitter is much more present in the taste. Hops are overwhelming the malt in a good way. The hops are from start to finish and beyond. Thin for an IPA but good. This is an IPA that you can still taste on your tongue in the morning. I had to drink three over two days before I realized I liked it. It grows on you. This beer is very drinkable if you know your IPA's. You're not going to get a crisp finish with this beer. I would drink it again, and recommend it."
"Overall, I had higher expectations for this ipa. It was too big for a regular ipa and too much alcohol showed. Probably will stick to something else, even though this is in MN now."
"Pours golden, with a very sticky, patchy head. Sort of a fresh, fruity, apricot-like aroma (besides the sweet hops) with some malt as well. Taste is big, palate-curling hops upfront, with a lot of sweetness in the middle and a total bitter citrus and hot finish. Toasty as well. An absolute hop bomb."
"Beautiful golden hue, well-developed carbonation, inch-thick initial head that dissipates slowly, the initial nose suggests much hops with clean herbal, grassy notes, very nice bitter tones on the center of my palate with lingering bitter hops at the upper rear, the malt is almost overpowered by the hops but quickly establishes a fine mellow balance, medium body, Belgian lace is very well developed and attractive, this IPA is a palate cleanser yet moreish. The ABV is not noticeable. The hoppy nose is evident to the very end. Very nicely balanced IPA that I will definitely seek out again."
"Drinkabiltity is good, not great. Solid beer though, definitely worth trying."
"D: I would qualify this as an average IPA, nothing offensive, but nothing outstanding. Not something I would seek out again, but I wouldn't be upset if it showed up as an extra. On a positive note, it's fairly well balanced outside of the slightly bitter end and quite easy to drink."
"Overall: One of the best non-A beers out there. Believe me, it's close and I might give this another review..."
"At 7.5 % ABV, I am amazed at how quite quaffable this one is. Even as the ale warms in the glass, it maintains its refreshing qualities. Another winner from this brewery and well priced compared to its competitors."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable and well-masked alcohol."
"I have had this many times but felt I couldn't review it until I could do it justice"
"Poured Amber with a big frothy head that left decent lacing on the glass. You can smell the hops coming through, but you don't truly realize how hoppy it is until the first sip. While there is a definite alcohol taste that becomes more apparent to me as the beer warms, it's really all about the hops here! While the alcohol will slow you down a bit, I thought it was a very refreshing and drinkable beer"
"D: I certainly enjoyed this enough to have it again, and I am especially interested in trying a fresher bottle to see if there is more hop character available to the palate."
"O: For a pale ale, I believe this beer has some significant flaws as to aroma and flavor. Where are the hops? The only real hop presence is in the finish. Highly suggest more hop presence in flavor and aroma. Style suggests moderate to high hop character and was not present. The malt character is great, just needs the hops, which are the bread and butter of this style."
"Drinkability: A solid offering from a great brewery. Not an extreme, over the top IPA, but well balanced and drinkable."
"This is a very enjoyable IPA and quickly becoming my go to beer. It is more than your average IPA. It not only brings West coast and East coast styles together but also throws some Belgian funk into the mix."
"d- solid ipa, i would drink this again for sure, and now that it's available in my area i'm planning on picking up the mixpack soon to try out the rest of the lineup."
"Drinkability: An excellent beer, actually, and one I'm surprised I haven't tried before, actually - Great Lakes, get thee to Virginia! I've been continually impressed by their beers, and their lineup is consistently well-made (both qc/style wise, as well as substance/taste- & aroma-wise) and eminently drinkable. Recommended to anyone who likes IPAs or, hell, well-made beer."
"Overall- this brew is good but missing something i can't put my finger on... they (great lakes) do a great job by hiding the alcohol but for an ipa i was hoping for more of a hop attack. for $8.99 a six tho you can't beat it."
"On tap at the brewpub in Cleveland. Pours a clear orange with a tight white head. Has the hop smell with some bready malt notes. A nice hop bitterness, very malty though. Very smooth and remarkably drinkable for its abv, I would have believed this was a 5%. A very nice IPA for sipping on the patio on this beautiful day."
"Overall, a handsome, tasty, well-crafted and balanced IPA. Yum."
"Pours a clear amber with a large white head that fades a bit too quickly. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. The pale color makes me think the malt will be rather submissive. Full of grapefruit and pine hop aromas. Smells like over ripen citrus fruit. There is a little caramel malt in the flavor but otherwise features the hops with a lot of grapefruit and orange. Bitterness is on the high side but there is enough hop flavor to make it worthwhile. Still would of liked more malt for balance. Medium body to carry the hop flavor and bitterness. Nicely carbonated and textured. The high bitterness and ABV limits drinkability."
"Taste, very one dimensional, not balanced, just bitter. Little hop feel, lots of bitterness. Alcohol isn't over the top, but rears its head enough to be slightly disagreeable. Could use some depth to it. A decent price, but the Burning River is so much more enjoyable. Still have 3 more in the 6er, but 1/2 way down, its nothing to write home about."
"D- Really drinkable beer, good ABV IMO. This beer is da bomb with any food really, washes the pallet like a dry cleaner."
"D- Well being a beer lover I enjoyed this beer, and will continue to enjoy it trough out the years, thank you Great Lakes for putting a smile on my face with yet another delicious IPA."
"D-I'm not a big fan of this one. Kind of a mess of an IPA that just does not taste very good to me."
"Overall a great beer and could become my go to beer"
"Pours a dark yellow with a big vibrant head. Aroma is fruity, with pineapple and flowers. Flavor is very flowery and tropical fruity, with pineapple, jasmine, persimmon. Quite sweet though fairly delicate. There is a slow orange rind bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly watery."
"Excellent beer, it's sure to be a regular."
"Far beyond drinkable in my book of yummyness! Wow! Its clean profile and balance is immaculately woven perfectly together for some heavy imbibing! Enjoy some Commodore I say! Yum!"
"The drinkability is decent. I would say two of these would be the maximum for myself. This is a very well crafted IPA that has balance and delivers plenty of hop bite."
"Drinkability: This is both a well balanced beer and a kick ass IPA. Almost could be called a DIPA. Or maybe it could be called a big English IPA. Or maybe it is simply a balanced American IPA. No idea, but I am very impressed."
"Drinkability is good. Not an exceptional IPA in my opinion, but it's not bad at all."
"Great Lakes Commodore Perry IPA pours an orange color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. I like the aroma, grapefruit and pine dominate. The flavor also has a hoppy profile, aroma and grapefruit dominate. Malt is there in the back though, alcohol also is noticeable. I like this one."
"Probably wont be drinking this again. But Great Lakes makes some badass beers, so drinking their product wont be a problem."
"D- A pretty basic IPA that doesn't really have much going for it. Decent flavor but pretty light body."
"The is a great IPA. Nice citrusy hops that I have fallen in love with. Not super balanced but I have become a hophead so this a positive for me."
"pours a clear yellow/orange color with a small white head..the smell is pine and citrus with some fruit smells maybe a hint of lemon and some malt...the taste is fresh pine and a crisp pleasant hop hit then it is followed by some fruit and a malty finish...the mouth feel is thin to me for an ipa kinda light..but it has high drink-ability for @ 7.5 abv they go down fast..over all a good ipa but not a top one"
"Drinkability: Very good. It's something I could drink again, but there are other IPAs that I prefer."
"the taste is almost just what you smell. huge hop notes with a citrus aftertaste. i can see this being a love hate beer for some. these go down really well."
"Drinkability is good. It goes down pretty easy for me and is not bad tasting. A pretty good example of the style, but if your looking for a more hoppy ipa there are others you could choose from. But still not a bad brew."
"D- For 7.5%, this goes down pretty easy. The crisp and light taste still has some bitterness. I did like the beer and I think of it as that light IPA on the market."
"another great choice from great lakes!pretty good ipa clear amber color,smells decent and taste of hops and grape fruit.could posssibly be a little more bitter for me,but still very good.i drink this often and always keep it in stock.cant go wrong with anything from great lakes!"
"D: Again, this was at a pizza place, not what I would consider beer bar. Some of the minor flaws may be related to the glassware or age of the beer on tap. Still, overall another solid selection from Great Lakes and certainly one I'd have again."
"d - I thought this was a pretty good IPA. It had enjoyable citrus hops and smooth caramel malts in the taste and I thought it was very drinkable. Would have again."
"Drinkability: I did not find the alcohol very noticeable, but this IPA certainly can push you around a little bit. Great for a short session."
"M/D: An odd strongly acidic note flares up in the finish and makes my mouth salivate profusely. Some tastebud on the tip of my tongue is reacting wildly. I wonder if this is typical or if it is a fluke occurrence specific to my palate (will be looking @ other reviews to investigate). Either way it is a deal-breaker, major points lost, will not be getting this again. Really weird. Aside from that, mouthfeel is moderately thick, carbonation on the light side, finish resiny."
"Pours a very nice orange color, with a white billowy head, probably over an inch high. Leaves nice lacing and clings very well. A very good looking beer. The smell is a bit subdued, a little grassy, a little lemon zest and a bit of toasty sweet malts. Nothing too impressive, though I wouldn't say it lacks what most IPAs have. The taste comes up with a little bit of bitterness - though the bitterness is nicely balanced with some grainy malts, slightly bready, slightly crackery. The hop flavor has the taste of lemons and sour lemon rinds, along with quite a bit of grass and resins. It also finishes with this very floral, slightly estery sting, mixed in with a pleasant sweetness. Pretty good, but I think there is just a little bit missing as far as I can tell. The body is nice - medium full. The carbonation is not incredibly lively, but it's definitely there. But the weird floral feeling kind of comes back, this sticky (but not like hop resins sticky) kind of powdery floral feeling, not the most pleasant thing. The beer is nice to drink, not too incredible, but one that I could definitely see being part of a nice night, maybe one to go back to, depending on the price and the situation, but not an IPA that I'd go to if I was looking for that American IPA kind of beer."
"Pretty darn good beer but because of its heft I'm not sure it's the most drinkable in the style, wouldn't want to be drinking too many of these on a warm evening."
"In words attributed to Abraham Lincoln: if you like this sort of thing, then this is the sort of thing that you would like."
"D: A solid IPA and yet another great flagship offering from GL Brewing Co."
"D: Easy to drink, not overbearing, excellent balance, and in general nice flavors make this an excellent beer. Glad to try it! 4"
"A perfect example of ""no coast"" IPAs that don't get enough attention. Damn tasty and bold enough to rival both coasts."
"This beer was the second in my flight of three at RFD in Chinatown, DC. It was pretty good. Smell was a bit sour, but had a nice floral/hoppy aroma as well. Taste was bitter and hoppy, well balanced. I'd have this beer again."
"Draft at brewpub. The brewmaster,Luke, had just finished this batch, but had not put on tap. He was good to me and poured me a glass. Poured hazy amber with a large rocky white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Large hoppy aroma. Medium body with full texture and soft carbonation. Very good well balanced hoppy flavor with a long smooth bitter finish."
"""Don't give up the Sip!"""
"Overall, very solid offering as are most Great Lakes beers. I enjoyed this though it was not standout amongst the Great Lakes lineup. Give it a shot if you have the chance though."
"Drinkabilty: Extremely drinkable. I finish it almost too fast for that much ABV."
"A: Deep gold, solid inch of head from a medium pour, lots of visible carbonation activity, some minor lacing - 3.50, S: Citrusy with a slight musty and/or earthy smell, subtle sweetness, very pleasing aroma though on the side of mild - 4.00, T: Solid hop bite, lots of grapefruit zest and a hint of pine, a soft caramel-like sweetness - 4.00, M: Smooth beginning the ends in a dry slight grittiness - 4.25, D: All around a pleasant IPA worthy of a try - 4.00"
"WHAT a BARGAIN! This is an exeptional IPA ! This stuff totally Rocks. Great Lakes has always done a outstanding job of ""balance"" in their brews and this is no exception. Do yourself a favor and try this one out for all your citrus,hops and taste desires. An extremely good brew!"
"This is a lovely offering from the US version of Great Lakes Brewing (there is a Canadian version of Great Lakes also). This is probably one of the better IPAs on the market, add to that the moderate price and good availability and we have a sound go-to IPA potent enough to satisfy most hop-heads."
"This is a solid IPA, but the competition is pretty stiff in the world of IPA's, and I'm not sure this qualifies as one of the better ones. It's a nice enough IPA, but not a great one. Given all the other options available, probably wouldn't order it again."
"Notes: Great example of an American IPA. Great Lakes come through with a win; again!"
"This brew served chilled shows a clear amber color with a decent frothy white head and great lacing. The aroma sends a somewhat astringent floral hops, swampy and a bit of sour mash malt. The taste brings a much mellower, nicer blend of bready malt and herbal hops. It's a mildly carbonated easy drinking ipa with a mid- bodied feel, kind of silky with heavy grains and nice woodsy bitterness. It really grows on you as you get away from the funky aroma that kind of turned me off. In the end, this is a nice, drinkable ipa. Thank you Ohoove!"
"Very representative of the British style. I liked it a lot."
"Clear gold with a medium white head. Nose is fruity and floral with some tangerine hops. Lots of bitterness with some grapefruit coming on strong. Slick, heavy body and lowish carbonation. Quite fruity and floral in flavour and just enough balancing sweetness. Not the best this brewery has to offer, but still fairly drinkable."
"D - This wasn't a bad English IPA...there were a lot more hops than what I was expecting and that's not a bad thing! A good brew to try from Great Lakes"
"I love this beer!"
"Hides 7.2% abv very well. This isn't unpleasant... But it isn't amazing. My palate is skewed due to all the BIG beers I've been drinking. I'll plan on re-reviewing this one later..."
"D - A very smooth IPA. Could easily sit back and have a few of these at once..."
"After having another glass of this the next night, I realized that the last one must have been a bad bottle. This one is excellent. Great bold flavor. Very well-balanced hops and malts. Great beer especially for the price."
"A great beer, something I've come to expect from Great Lakes"
"D - Could drink this one for awhile."
"Poured from a chilled 12 oz bottle into a goblet. Pours a clear light amber, with no head, just a fine skim on top. Aroma is malty, but a swirl in the glass brings out some piney hops. A slight sweetness leads, and the flavor is full of pronounced hops, fading to a lingering floral fruitiness. The hops are a large flavor, but not overwhelming or unbalanced. It has a medium body, and coats the mouth well, allowing the flavors to linger on. Lazy, slow rising bubbles in the glass defy how carbonated the beer feels on the tongue - a medium carbonation adds to the sharpness of the hops and delivers the flavor. This is a tasty beer, one which could easily be a session beer for one who likes hops."
"Served from a chilled bottle into a chalice. The beer is a pretty orange color, like a pumpkin beer. It had a thin head of white bubbles that quickly disappeared. It left a bit of lacing. There are numerous streams of bubbles rising in the glass. I like the aroma of this beer; hearty citrus hops and a hint of caramel malt. The flavor is characterized by a very good hop character. Slightly bitter at first, the hops swell into a full-blown mouth full of bitterness. It's dry and a little fruity. There is also some sweetness mixed in for good measure. There is no indication this is a 7.5% ABV beverage. This is a very tasty IPA. It has a medium body, but it's a hearty medium; it fills your mouth with flavor and leaves a good coating that lingers along with the hop aftertaste, but it also makes you want to have another sip. This is a great session IPA. Nothing about it is overwhelming. I could drink this one all night. I'm kicking myself that I didn't pick up more than one bottle."
"D- Easy beer to drink in regards to its style and higher alcohol content. Overall great job by Great Lakes... Fun to read the bottle and admire the art, too!"
"This is the most drinkable English-style IPA I've encountered. I want to drink more but have limited myself to two because of the 7% alcohol content. Nice head, great floral notes and a wonderful mild fruity finish. Hoppy but not overbearing as some American IPA's can be. Just a great beer. Maybe one to try if you have a friend that is reluctant to try an IPA due to the overwhelming hops in many of the representatives of the style."
"Pours a clear orangey gold color with a good-sized but fairly fizzy white head. Aroma is sweet citrus and malts with a touch of spiciness. Flavor is rather banana-esque to me for some reason. This isn't made with wheat as far as I know so I'm rather confused here. Anyway, the fruit salad theme continues with grapefruit and lychee, which makes this a rather sweet beer. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Pretty good but tasted like half-hefe half-IPA to me."
"Feels above average in the mouth, spot on carbonation and a slick, oily feel make this one easy drinker. Careful though, as the alcohol content may sneak up and smack you over the head."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, almost creamy. Medium to heavier medium body. Very drinkable and the ABV is pretty much non-detectable. The taste changed as I worked my way through the bottle, it definitely got better. I'm not completely sold on this beer but it's interesting enough to make me want to buy more."
"Poured from a bottle with 1/30/10 freshest date on the bottle. Poured bright copper with a goldish hue. Decent amount of head with little extra carbonation. Strong hoppy pine, citrus-like scents of grapefruit and pineapple. Alcohol is warming. More scent than flavor. Flavor is very hoppy. Hop profile is a little dryer than I would enjoy which hinders the drinkable nature. I am glad to have tried this brew."
"Finally a taste and I immediately realize this is an English IPA, not American IPA as the menu states. Oops! Well then this is pretty good. Beer is a little dry but sweet. There is a nice hop flavor (citrus again) and a nice bitterness in the back. Medium bodied, which is appropriate, overall a good EIPA."
"Smooth and drinkable."
"There is a strange bitter asparagus kind of taste that sits in the back of the mouth. Definitely hoppy with some sourness. This is a high quality beer, but I would bet it would be brilliant off the tap or out of a cask. Especially aged."
"D: One of the better examples of the style I have had. Hopefully we will continue to be able to get their beer in New York."
"This is one of my favorite beers."
"Pleasing cream white head of above a finger, mixture of foam and bubbles, dissolves at a steady, rapid pace, does leave a good bit of lacing behind. Bright, cloudy pumpkin orange color, semi-translucent, yellows out around the rims. Clove, pepper spice and forest floor matter, lichens swirl up in the nose, tree bark and fallen limbs too, sounds crazy but there's something like Hunt's ketchup in there, sour orange zest, peach and apricot pits, not a lot of sweetness in there. Medium-bodied, mouth entry buoyed by foamy carbonation, herbaceous with that same forest-like earthiness and bark notes, even charcoal. Flavor-wise, not much maltiness but they do smooth out the texture some. Orange, lemon pith on the sour side, apricot, peach, red apple, red cherry fruit. More metallic as it goes on. Enough here has one scratching one's head that perhaps this bottle is not representative. Hmmm."
"Pours a clear amber with very thick head and lace. Pungent odor of hops and citrus, spices. Taste is big with piney hops, coriander, and fruit. It's an admirable IPA from a reputable brewery, but a word of warning: it packs a BIG punch. Two or three of these and you'll be on the floor quick. A great IPA, but a bit too sneaky in the abv dept. for my taste."
"drinkability is good with regards to taste but at 8% your not drinking a sixer on sunday watching the game....or are you?"
"The mouth is a little thin and slick. Leaves a light silky coating on the palate. On to the good part. Wow! This is a really well-made E-IPA as far as flavor goes. Big citrusy hops at the forefront, but they mellow beautifully to a sweet honey finish. No harsh aftertaste, even though this is plenty bitter. Slight drying feel on the finish. Flavors of grapefruit and light butterscotch bring up the rear. What a treat this beer is. Thanks, Rich, for this stellar beer!"
"D: A solid IPA, a little heavy on the citrus without the grapefruit/malt sweets to complement but when i'm in the mood for that I now know where to go."
"D: This is something I'd definitely trade for again. A very solid beer."
"D-pretty light tasting covering the alcohol very well with the lighter flavors, i could drink many and it would probably sneak up on me"
"This IPA is mostly filled with spicy and floral hops. The nose is very mediocre. When I smell an IPA, I want a foral bouquet. This beer is a spiciness mixed with a tad bit of breadiness. There is a tad bit of floral notes. The flavour of the beer is a bitter maltiness and a huge spiciness. A bit of floral notes come through as well. I like the flavour, but the hop profile is one dimensional. I'd like a little bit more dryness. Its pretty drinkable too. Solid beer by Great Lakes."
"Drinkability - I'll give it this, it does go really well with a meal (complimented a spicy sweet Asian stir fry well), but you need to keep these cold which means drink fast which also is a problem at 7.5 ABV."
"Overall, it is a rather enjoyable IPA. It is not my favorite beer from Great Lakes, but it is one that I would have again."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my perfect pint glass. Pours a light amber color with a nice fluffy white head that quickly dissipates into a thin layer covering the beer. Nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is dominated by the citrusness of the hops. Taste has lot of the citrusness up front followed by a nice long bitterness. Enjoyable IPA, another solid offering from Great Lakes."
"Overall impression: Solid IPA- really enjoying the offerings from this brewery."
"The mouthfeel is nice and light, this is drinkable despite its bitterness."
"Thanks to jrallen34 for the opportunity. 12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. For freshest taste, enjoy by 09/28/09 indicated on the bottle. Poured a translucent gold with a slight orange hue and a one inch creamy, bright white head. Head eventually settles into a consistent skim with delicate strands of lacing revealed during the tasting - excellent adhesion. Mild nose - some grapefruit, but it doesn't really punch you in the face, followed by a light malt character. Taste reveals a floral/piny hops character up front with a lingering, slightly medicinal, bitterness at the finish - no grapefruit here. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a background carbonation just short of prickly; finishes crisp and dry. A decent IPA for the most part; however, I tend to prefer the more grapefruity side of the style. Nonetheless, a solid IPA."
"The aroma was light with hints of grapefruit and bitter trailing. The flavor followed the nose, not an overpowering IPA, but just clean, crisp and flavorful. A fun IPA and very drinkable, just makes you want more."
"Solid IPA, nothing too original, but everything you desire when picking one up."
"This is a very drinkable IPA, with an inviting, hoppy scent and a smooth hop/malt taste. God forbid they violate the Bavarian Purity Law--there's nothing in it besides barley, hops, yeast and water. Given those constraints, Great Lakes does a fine job, especially at masking the 7.5% abv. I taste pine, licorice and malt without a hint of the alcohol underneath. The taste is drier and a bit less complex than similar IPA's. It makes me wonder what Great Lakes might come up with if it dared violate the BPL."
"Another great IPA. Great Lakes Brewery does it right with this one. I first had it about a year ago and forgot how much I liked it. Found an older bottle in the back of the beer fridge and couldn't wait to open the bottle. Poured into a clean glass and observed a nice golden color with an attractive smell. Pretty affordable for the Alcohol By Volume content. Taste is dead on perfect and very enjoyable. Ill continue to stock my fridge with this IPA."
"This is a tasty IPA, nicely balanced and surprisingly complex."
"Fine, fine stuff. So far I'm three different beers into my Great Lakes stash, and they're living up to the hype from where I'm sitting. Another bonus from new Blacksburgian kels, thanks!"
"Drinkability: very enjoyable IPA that goes down quickly. If you are looking for a basic APA, this one fits the bill."
"Pretty drinkable IPA, Commodore Perry IPA is definitely another quality brew from Great Lakes."
"One of the best of the GLBC brews, in my opinion."
"Pours a rather weak copper, more of a dark yellow lager color, with with some decent initial head, and some very nice lacing. Nice scent, good hop (fuggles?) aroma, a bit beef jerkyish and a little grassy. Nice flavor, though I thought the taste was more of an English pub bitter with the English hops taste, bit of nice maltiness, but nothing too strong. Goes down very well for a 7.5% beer, but this just wasn't an IPA, more of an Enlgish pale or special bitter as far as taste and scent goes."
"Yum"
"D - The 7.5% abv is totally hidden in this beer making it definitely pack quite a kick. It's aroma started to develop more as it warmed with could use a little work but the flavor and mouthfeel are great. Very drinkable IPA that will also knock your socks off."
"Notes: One of my favorite everyday IPAs. I could drink this all day long and I wouldn't feel like I was sacrificing in flavor at all by having to go to a session beer."
"The more I drank and the more the beer warmed the more apparent the sweet malt became, both in the taste and the smell of this beer."
"Despite the carbonation, this is a pretty solid example of the style. Not gonna knock your socks off but it's solid where it should be. Check it out."
"D - Good flavor associated with the hops with the sharp finish associated with hoppy beers. Very nice. A little higher ABV keeps this from being the usual session ale, but I would still have more than one in a night if it was available."
"This is certainly not a unique take on the style (but it is an IPA, I am not sure one really wants unique), it is entirely enjoyable. It is perhaps a touch too refined in its bright, clean interpretation of loud hops and supporting malt, but that doesn't keep it from being a great example of the style."
"Recommended..."
"Overall, very happy with the purchase and a solid IPA I would recommend to my beer nerd friends. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: This is a American IPA that I can drink over and over again."
"The citrus notes from the aroma are not as prominent in the flavor. Medium body with a slightly chewy resinous hop forward mouthfeel. There is only a slight bit of citrus peel and grapefruit flavor. The hops are very earthy and plant like not crisp and floral. The malt backbone provides a decent balance with some nice biscuit notes. This beer is a decent session beer that is kind of one dimensional. Pretty good but not something I would drink regularly."
"Fine example of an IPA, just a little too bitter on the aftertaste for me."
"M/D - The mouthfeel has a slight unpleasant hop bite. I'm usually a fan of hops in all quantities, but there is a slight bitter pang that just doesn't agree with my palate. I've always noticed it, but I enjoy the rest of this beer so much I tolerate it. However, this is a fantastic go-to beer and it's an easy drinker for the abv"
"A 12 ounce bottle picked up at Abe's in Bethlehem for around $1.75. Glad to finally have easy access to Great Lakes beer in eastern PA. Freshest by 9/14/09. Poured into my nonic pint glass, the IPA appears a clear golden yellow color with a good two fingers of fluffy bone white foam. The foam leaves a minimal lace on the inside of my glass with each sip. Nose and flavor consist of medium toasted cereal grain, grassy hops, citrus such as tangerines, floral, nice amount of caramelized malt, notes of resinous pine, a bit of alcohol. The ale is approaching full bodied with ample carbonation. Welcome to the other side of the state. I plan on adding this one to my regular IPA rotation."
"D: Very good full flavored, non west coast, non hop bomb IPA. As close as you can get to a Double IPA/West Coaster without crossing the line."
"Drinkability: A solid IPA, one that's very sessionable but one that could easily sneak up on you with the ABV levels. Another winner from Great Lakes. I hope we get the seasonals as they keep changing and the months go on."
"Pours a crystal clear golden with a modest head that quickly fades to a collar. I don't get that typical citrus aroma, not much of anything. The taste was a watered down sweet citrus, not offensive. Feel was medium bodied and a little oily. Drinkability was good. Not bad, a safe beer. This might be a good one to introduce to someone who is new to IPA's, rather than an extreme hoppy right off the bat."
"M/D: This one definitely has some body to it as well as an ethanol presence, and at 7.5% it should be expected, but still maintains it's drinkability."
"D- this bottle, to me, is unballanced and hard to enjoy."
"D: Pretty solid. Could easily be an easy every-day drinker. Lacking in complexity and umph to really standout however."
"D: This is a great offering by Great Lakes. I would prefer to have a little sweetness in this brew but I understand that the style doesn't require it. I will definately return to Commodore Perry. Don't give up the sip!"
"For those that don't think this beer is hoppy, it is a different monster from draft. It had a real nice hop bite and was very enjoyable. I had it up right before a Titan IPA (which I love) and they were neck and neck in taste and hoppiness. Good beer, I have a newfound respect for it. My first tap Great Lakes was a very good experience. Keep em coming."
"Pours unappealingly crystal clear honey-amber with a thin, fizzy head. A nose full of off-flavored hops, with some citrus and maybe, just maybe, a touch of old cabbage. Taste is loads of tangeriney hops up front, with just enough of a malt backbone to counterbalance. Stickiness prevails in the finish, leaving me searching for something redeeming in the only meh-worthy Great Lakes offering I've ever encountered. If hops and/or Great Lakes is your thing, stick to Burning River."
"A nice light golden color pour with a thin lasting white head , jagged clumps of lacing left , medium carbonation .Aroma is lightly toasted grain , green hop leaf , slightly piny and floral. Flavor is reainous up front , floral , and piny , mild hints of citrus , clean toasted malt . Mildly bitter for an IPA but just right for balance here , clean hoppy finish ,slightly fruity . Medium body , clean crisp mouthfeel , very drinkable , a quality IPA from GLB they never seem to disappoint ."
"a bit thin,slightly slick on the tongue.this is an easy to drink beer,overall worth trying out."
"Drinkability: Abv has some legs and flavors are potent so I'm not going to put this one too high up on the charts."
"I like this beer a whole lot. Great flavor and mouthfeel with a nice amount of alcohol. This is one has it all."
"Commodore Perry has a mix of copper and medium orange in color with a bright white head about a 1/2 inch up. Rings of lacing on the way down. Scents consist of citrus and bittering hops with a little malt background. It taste the same with the hops coming 1st with a small malt backing, leaving a bitter taste overall. The feel is bitter, medium bodied with sharp carbonation. A long aftertaste with some earthy things abound. Not my favorite IPA but a good one none the less."
"This poured clear gold with white head. It smelled like lemon hops and creamy yeast, with nutty and roasted barley malts. It tasted like lemon and faint peach hops, with nutty malt and bready yeast. It was watery with some carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a fairly unimpressive beer. It seemed more like a Belgian blonde ale or German lager, due to all the malt and yeast. The hops were pretty weak for an American IPA. The body was decent, and it hid the alcohol well, so it was easy enough to drink. But otherwise, this wasn't notable or worth buying again."
"This is an excellent IPA, and highly recommended."
"Golden-orange hue with white foamy head, sheet and ribbon lace. Smells great with citrus aromas, fruit zest. Taste is hoppy, citrus carries through from the nose to the palate, strong malty middle, bitter finish, dry aftertaste. Impressive sticky lace as the glass empties, medium dense body with excellent retention. Well done."
"D: Loved this beer even more on-tap. There is nothing like having a fresh IPA on-tap at the brewery. Really tasty. The hops were lip smacking."
"Ok for the price (frequently on sale for $6.99/six pack), but certainly nothing to go nuts over."
"Bottle thanks to moejuck. Pours a clear light orange with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet malt (some wheat maybe?), light tropical fruits, and light hops that become more garlicky as the beer warms. Flavor is more hoppy with grassy and citrus hops. Nice and hoppy, although the dominating hops make the flavor not as complex as some of the top IPAs. Still, a solid IPA."
"Mouthfeel was a scrubbing texture that I love. Medium bodied. This one was a pleasant surprise."
"Overall: a good IPA from GL, but not one that I would seek out that often as it does not distinguish itself from the many other IPA's out there."
"I had heard good things about this ale and was excited to try it. The aroma was typical of an American IPA with a floral hoppiness. The beer was a nice looking golden in color. The mouthfeel was pretty good and had a decent body. I found the taste to be hoppy with a mild pine component, but otherwise unremarkable. I think my expectations were too high based on what I heard. This is a rather typical IPA."
"Drink- wanted to drink this all night but it was my 1st beer and then I had the Monster"
"Drinkability: Fairly drinkable, especially if you go for sticky IPAs."
"M/D- This stuff is great! A good, almost 50/50 balance of malts and hops make a great IPA. Considering the 80 IBUs, I could drink at least 3 or 4 of these in a session."
"Certainly I am enjoying the mouthfeel the brewers have given to this beer - enough carbonation to kill a small mammal, medium bodied, with a slick buttery finish. 12 ounces drink more like 8, which means it goes down easy. Well crafted, an interesting take on the style."
"Drinnkability: Pretty high. I like this beer a lot and I have to believe it's great for a hot day. The flavor is pleasant and strong, but not too strong, and the balance is great. The ABV is pretty do-able, granted, it's a little on the higher side so I don't know about drinking it in a session, but if the day/night is long enough, two or three shouldn't present too much of a challenge."
"Another excellent brew from GLBC."
"Notes: this is a good beer for 8.99 and would recommend it. not my favorite GLBC beer, but its still really good. Drink it cold, let it warm, it tastes good in different ways, both ways."
"D: A very, very well-done IPA from Great Lakes. Not a West Coast hop bomb, but it's a top-notch, traditional IPA. Delicious hop flavors, pithy bitterness, and excellent balance."
"I remember drinking this one years ago at the Great Lakes Brewery up in Cleveland...and loving it. I am so glad they've added it to their continuous bottling lineup. It's a great beer, a moderate level of alcohol, and very drinkable. For a night of drinking, I'd go with their Burning River, but for sitting around with some friends or to pair with some spicy Saag Paneer, this one hits the spot."
"Medium-bodied, carbonation is on the low side, nice for the style. The drinkability is hindered by the lasting taste of the beer, not really my cup of ale."
"Future outlook: Great Lakes rarely disappoints me, and this is no exception. Another excellent offering that I look forward to having this again. Made for a very happy 200th review to me."
"The beer pours a beautiful golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice mix of pale, Carapils, and bisquit malts as well as a wonderful hop nose that's bitter, but balanced. The taste is great! It has a really smooth pale and bisquit malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and bitter with some great hop taste. There is incredible balance here. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great American IPA. It's hoppy, yet complex enough in the malt bill to provide a level of balance."
"D: This is a great IPA. Not the best but its so well rounded. Its tasty but not so overwhelming that one or two is too much. I could drink this beer all day. One of my favorites from GLBC."
"Light gold colour with a decent head for such a strong beer. It has a sweet fruity nose with hints of apple, grape, raisin and peach. If anything it tastes a little too sweet but there is a good herbal edge to it. Good but not as big or interesting as many of the northwestern IPA's."
"D- I don't really find IPA's to be a style that is session-able to me, but this is one I could see myself having more than one of."
"D- Alright drinkability, due to the bitterness. I have had no problem pounding through a sixer. Is a great summertime beer."
"D- Fine brew that has all of the key ingredients of a nice IPA. Not the best, but solid."
"Mouthfeel is medium and slick, slightly oily and creamy. Good and refreshing for an ale of this flavor level."
" Nice quality."
"This doesn't really enter the discussion for my favorite IPAs taste-wise, but it's incredible solid, and the crafting is superb. It's gorgeous, and I'd buy it regularly if it were closer."
"Good drikability, I'm sure the ABV would get me after awhile, but the first bottle goes down pretty darn easy. A solid AIPA"
"edited score 10-31-2010"
"D: It was an alright Ipa it was altogether pretty good and not your average ipa and the carmel taste makes it quite unique."
"A two finger light tan head sits on top of a slightly hazy orange body. Sweet citrusy hops. Some hints of tropical fruits in the aroma. The taste has a combination of tropical fruits, grapefruit peels, and pine. Tastes really good but the drinkability isn't really there for me, one glass and I'm done with it for the night."
"D: Quite drinkable. I'm glad that my local store had sixers of this on sale for only $6.49. I haven't been disappointed by a Great Lakes brew yet."
"Easy to drink tasty IPA. Others I would choose before this one, but this is quite tasty."
"As I poured this into my pint glass, I would describe the color as a light orange. The head, while short, was very thick and left a nice trail of lacing throughout the entirety of its short existence. This could possibly use a little more malt falvoring up front to balance the wonderful citrusy hops, but overall the taste is quite good. Goes down smooth and the bitter aftertaste sticks around for some time. Overall, another fine offering from Great Lakes."
"Poured a dark amber color, clear appearance, nice two finger head and brilliant lacing. A sweet hop smell at first, followed by a grainy alcohol intake. Gulp. Yeah, this one is on the sweeter side of things, you get a punch of the hops, but is somewhat tame. Light/Medium bodied, easy gulper though the high ABV. A good session IPA. Great Lakes has a great roster of beers, this review by all means should not be taken to heart."
"M/D - Medium bodied with a light chewiness. Good carbonation and very easy drinking, just not the taste profile I prefer."
"Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Low to medium carbonation makes this beer so damn drinkable."
"Notes: im guessing something went wrong. this is not a great lakes beer. i really think i need to start over with a fresh one."
"Tastes more like a double ipa. Very thick caramel flavors coat the tongue. It doesn't taste as fresh as I assumed it would, the bottle says fresh until 3-11-09. The citrus shows mostly in the middle of the sip with subdued orange, lemon and banana. Dry hop kick on the end that really shows a nice use of pine hops. Some booze along the way but nothing profound or displeasing."
"Well done GLB!"
"Great Lakes Commodore Perry IPA is on the border between dark gold and light amber. It's crystal clear and quite sparkling. It's topped with a dense white head, with rainbow bubbles, that fades to a film and leaves good lacing. It has a nice, bold, citrus-pine aroma, along with something herbal. It smells a little sweet, like Christmas cookies. Despite the ""best by"" date being passed, it smells fresh. It is medium bodied and very smooth. It has a creamy mouth feel that's a little bubbly. It lightens up toward the end of the taste. It has a pretty dry finish that leaves the mouth a little sticky. It's pretty well bittered and pretty well balanced. I suppose I would prefer a little more bitterness to go with this huge boozy quality. It's a touch sweet. The flavor is mostly grapefruit and pine. The alcohol lends a black pepper quality."
"Drinkability: An enjoyable, quality India Pale Ale charged with plenty of hop bitterness but, thankfully, refrains from being overbearing."
"Even though this is clearly less hoppy than most American IPA's I really enjoyed this. Very drinkable! This one's a keeper!"
"Pours a beautiful hazy orange with a white fizzy head that dissiaptes very quickly. Smells like carmel malt&grassy hops with a touch of alcohol thrown in. Very easy drinking IPA, although you can smell the alcohol in it you cannot taste it. Mouthfeel for the most part is crisp, i say that because there is some lingering sweetness. Overall a well put-together IPA that needs more hop ""snap"" to get a 4.0 on taste from me."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with a pinch of carbonation."
"D: An amazingly easy drinking IPA."
"Good beer. With so many good IPA's out there the competition is tuff. Imo this stacks up somewhere in the middle. I recommend it as you can't go wrong with Great Lakes."
"Would I buy more of it? I really wish I could. I'd go for a 12-pack and make it my go to IPA for sure."
"I like this beer. We picked up a fresh case while in OH last week. I'll be sad when they're gone. Next time I gotta stop by the brewery."
"I find it nicely drinkable and do enjoy the spicy nature. A solid American IPA.."
"Overall, a really enjoyable beer, if you can get your hands on it."
"The combination of the bitter hops and the sweet malts make this a pretty nice IPA from Great Lakes."
"Cheers..."
"I gotta tell you, I am loving it. Sweet maltiness makes this a great beer."
"drinkability is great. Could drink these all night until my body rejects."
"D: This is a tough one to rate. Tonight, I don't think I could have much more than one...on a good day, maybe two. The ABV catches up on you here. There are better IPA's out there, but I definitely won't have a problem going through the sixer, that's for sure!"
"Pours golden orange with very little head. Smell is very bright with grass. Like a freshly mowed lawn, minus the lawnmower exhaust. Taste is a hop punch in the front. A little of that grass taste is there, then mellows to a sweet malt. This is a very interesting IPA. Very different, and very good."
"mouthfeel is of lingering bitter hops, sweet, creamy and very drinkable - a delicious ipa!"
"D- This just wasn't a tremendously well done IPA. It lacked a big hoppy presence and was instead to balanced. Probably won't drink again."
"Pretty drinkable."
"This beer pours a hazy orange-amber color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is of oranges, grapefruit, and hints of pine. However, all these aspects seems to clash with each other. The taste is a lot like the aroma, but not quite as strong. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is an IPA that just doesn't do it for me. I would try it again, but I won't go out of my way to do so."
"Another great brew from a great brewery. Pours a golden color with a minimal head. Smell is slightly hoppy. Taste is bitter hops. A very refreshing beer that is quickly becoming my summer staple to have in the fridge. The alcohol is completely hidden so be careful with these."
"The feel is oily and thick; it's a slow sipper to be sure. Overally, it's very heavy and loaded with a massive amount of hops. But unfortunately, there isn't a shred of malty balance."
"Definitely not a typical IPA, but worth a try. I've bought this several times and plan to continue buying it in the future when I feel like a different IPA."
"Thanks, rhinos00, for the opportunity"
"Easy drinking IPA, especially for the 7.5% abv."
"not the best ipa i have had but not bad at all; crisp, clean, and hoppy; will drink it again but will not crave it."
"D - pucker up and enjoy this beer in moderation."
"Just shy of one finger of sticky white, merengue head. But that scant foam sticks around the whole 12 ounces, leavningsome lacing after each sip. Glass clinging bubbling amidst a very clear, coppery amber. Mojito minty hops with some soft mangos and bread hit the nose.Very sticky mint and citrus hops mix with some powdered malt extract or the toasted kind. The finish is very oily and slick. Bitter graefruit lingers the longest."
"Overall, this is a nice IPA with a nice hop profile."
"Cheers!!"
"D: Good quality IPA... very drinkable with the 7.5% ABV well masked by the hops flavors."
"Smooth and refreshing IPA. Very crisp and just around the right strength to make this very drinkable. Could have several."
"D: Excellent brew, exceeded my expectations by far and proved Great Lakes as a phenom brewer, one of my new fav's. Finally an IPA that isn't hop bombed, but actually shows some balance, an excellent depiction. I'd recco these guys to anyone and will make it a point to get more of their offerings."
"D- This is a nice East coast IPA...and at 7.5% is headed towards DIPA status. My last of the great lakes regular line-up to try. Solid...but I prefer most of the lineup over this one. I'm finding that I prefer the West Coast IPA style over the East Coast style...the hoppy flavor overload masks the bitterness better. I'll probably have this again sometime...and am now MUCH more likely to buy a Great Lakes variety case."
"D: Good, not great and I expect more from Great Lakes."
"This IPA is a little different than your typical face-full of pine and grapefruit. Given, it does have grapefruit, but the flavor starts mellow and then grows through the finish to a big, spicy bitterness. The aroma has more of the citrus and is pleasant, but relative for the style, it could be better. For the strength, this beer is very drinkable and a little dangerous. It's probably a good thing more 7.5% beers aren't this seemingly sessionable."
"D_A bit too sweet for my liking but a decent IPA overall Could be a bit hoppier as well."
"This is a solid IPA from Great Lakes and the alcohol seems well hidden at 7.5% but I would expect nothing less."
"So ive tried oktoberfest from this brewery and thought it was very tasty, However the second 6er we got was this and let me tell you it tastes like GRAPEFRUIT juice gone bad mixed with alcohol. Very nasty. The smell was nice and wasnt expecting to be blasted by nastiness. Now I will consider trying it again because it wont be the first time I tried a beer for the first time and hated it.. Be it that I got a bad/old batch or just the taste buds werent up to it. The date on these bottles were 11/20/08 so dont know what happened. Thanks for reading."
"D: I could drink 3 or 4 of these in a sitting easily. I don't think I would want to take down a 6 pack, though."
"A very solid interpretation of the style. Enough hops to satisfy this hop head."
"Drinkability: Decent drinkability, the bitter hops really rule this beer, and seem to hamper drinkability a bit. Not my favorite IPA, but a solid offering from Great Lakes. I would drink this beer again."
"this is dry and bitter with a fair amount of malt, this isn' bad but it isn't the best product by great lakes. but the abv is nice and this is a smooth drinking brew, the problem is that it jusd dosent stand out, i will probley only drink the outher five that i have and forget this beer, totaly avrage"
"Surely, this is a very well balanced IPA. Some hopheads that are expecting a hopbomb will be dissapointed. Nevertheless I would recomend this beer to any beer geek, not just hopheads."
"D - Pretty solid IPA from Great Lakes, and probably my favorite offering of theirs thus far. It's got a nice balance of malt and hops in the flavor, thought the aroma doesn't reveal the full extent of the hops in this brew. I'd definitely revisit this one down the road."
"This is a great IPA and another great offering from Great Lakes. Although I can't get these beers on a regular basis, I look for them whenever I can find them. Best wishes to Great Lakes on their 20th anniversary. Here's to the next twenty years as well."
"Very good brew. I am not a big IPA fan, but i can drink this very easy, not too bitter, good brew."
"I would drink these any time. Another example of Great Lakes doing what they do best... making terrific beer."
"I've been hunting for this seasonal offering and was able to track some down. This is right in line with the Great Lakes way of brewing beer fantastic recipe, and a great angle on a wonderful style. Emptied a bottle into my glass and was given a richly golden colored ale with a thick fluffy white head that soon settles to a nice white film. Abundant lacing is present, and a lazy carbonation can be seen. As I smell the aroma I am rewarded with a biting hop scent of grapefruit and pine. This is pleasant and unexpected and it smells wonderful. This is considerably more citrusy than the average IPA. Mouthfeel is dry and smooth, not too thick so it goes down easy. The flavor is outstanding keeping in line with the aroma. An abundance of hops (cascade is an understatement) fill out this one with a real subtle malt backbone. Taste is mostly citrus grapefruits, nice and tart with an even amount of bitterness. Overall this is one of my favorite IPA's and another score for one of my top brewers. Too bad it's seasonal, if you come across it grab some!"
"D: Alcohol though well hidden in the taste makes itself very present later on as you are a ways into the glass, pretty thick and on the fuller side of medium bodied, one is the right amount of one of these for a night. Its been a while since a gave a beer all 4s but this is just one overall balanced good beer so...if the shoe fits...all 4s."
"D= A damn good IPA! I have become a huge fan of Great Lakes beers, and this one did not disappoint. One of my new warm weather favorites!"
"Very drinkable. I can see myself tipping quite a few of these back in a sitting."
"Poured an orange amber color with a nice thick head that dissipated quickly leaving behind some moderate lacing. Nice floral hop notes in the nose backed up by a sweet malt character. Very sweet for an IPA, which I must admit to liking. Lots of syrupy hop resins on the tongue, some great malt backbone, sweet and bitter at the same time. Very nice brew and my first from this company."
"It's not a bad effort, just a little off-par compared to the IPA's which are more widely available in my area."
"HV"
"For an IPA, this one doesn't do it for me. I simply needs more hops. I had this recently, but I was not hoping for much, although I was secretly hoping it would be among their great beers, but it's not. Not enough punch, hops, or uniqueness. A mainstream beer made to sell in stores like Kroger, along with some other Great Lakes beers. Nothing compared to the Blackout Stout and some other seasonal releases."
"Prosit, MK"
"D- Id definitely like to have another couple of these. A great year round pretty commonly available selection from great lakes."
"D-Would drink a few more but would start to look for something new. Solid brew."
"D- not impressed, i would give a fresh bottle another go."
"Clear Bronze, with a nice off white head. Leafy and pine hops along with some pale malt aromas. Nice crisp citrus and pine hops upfront, light bisquity malts follow thru. Crisp dry slightly floral finish with ample bitterness. This cant be 7.5% can it? Yes, its all there with this puppy. Another fine brew from Great Lakes."
"Drinkability- Very nice and affordable around these parts for the style. This is one that I will revisit again and again and not just because it's the local flavour. The balance makes the ale quite enjoyable."
"This is a medium bodied beer, easy to enjoy and easy on the tastebuds, so the mouthfeel is good. Another quality beer from the boys in Cleveland."
"D: Higher ABV at 7.5% but a really well balanced IPA."
"Poured a clear golden amber with 1 finger of creamy white head, nice retention and sticky lacing. Smells of honey, grass, and citrus. Tastes of grass, honey, toasted grain, and grapes with an earthy hop finish with a touch of lemon rind tartness. Medium in body with good carbonation, good balance and nice bitterness. Easy to drink with good flavors, another nice brew from Great Lakes."
"D : Another great brew from Great Lakes that I would definitely recommend"
"A nice enough beer, Very tasty without going too far with the hops."
"D- Easy to drink with great balance and taste."
"I would like to know the IBU's on this one, oooh, found out, it's 80. This is a hoppy beer. Also has a nice malty backbone to counter the hops. Lingering bitterness, even after the first sip, a bit unbalanced, but IPA's probably should be. Nice rocky, creamy head with a mess of lacing down the glass. Tart and bitter grapefruit flavors singe through. An absolute great session brew."
"Poured into a shaker pint. It pours a nice golden amber with a lasting white head. It smells heavily of floral and citrus hops but its also balanced out with some sweet malt. This is a really solid sessionable IPA. Its pretty easy to drink and the malt melds really well with the strong hoppiness. Really surprised by this one. Probably my second favorite from Great Lakes so far next to the Blackout Stout."
"D: This is a very pleasant IPA, well balanced and enough kick to make it a joy to consume."
"The label bears the following inscription: ""Don't give up the sip."" Aye, aye, Commodore!"
"Poured a medium golden copper with a thick head that stayed around awhile. It smelled uniquely delightful--very flowery. Tasted very hoppy but not very bitter--finished smooth and was very drinkable. This is a great brew and I really enjoyed it! Definitely recommend this one."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with minimal carbonation. Drinkability is average."
"The nose is mostly citrus with orange peel and grapefruit bitterness. Mildly chalky, docking half a point. The palate is an explosion of citrus hops, with a great balance between flavor and bitterness, not something I've found in too many east coast IPAs. Candied orange up front with a moderate bitterness, Mild malt presence is noted with a caramel character with a simple candy sweetness. Drying on the finish, with a reserved bitterness. Good carbonation, pleasing finish. M-L in body. Solid stuff."
"This is an IPA that IPA drinkers will like. There is a nice smell to this beer that is only made better by its taste. It's crisp, and hoppy without too much bite. There is a hint of citrus in it's taste. The after taste is pleasant."
"Another very good Great Lakes brew.. This brewery consistently puts out incredible brews.."
"Overall not bad, a very good IPA, though more of a pale ale to me, but still very good. I could easily see myself throwing down multiple bottles of this with ease. Really a good call and something everyone should try."
"This will be a staple, henceforth."
"from a fresh sixer, this is a clear gold with a really nice creamy white head and lacing. nose is somewhat subdued for an ipa, but bready, sweet, honeyed malts and floral, piney notes were present. good bouqet but i'd just like it amped up a bit at this abv. nice malt sweetness and big bitter hops to balance. sharp hop bitterness lingers. just over medium in body and nice carbonation, but the mouthfeel is almost too clean, possibly missing something that an unfiltered ale brings to the table. would like a bit more hop flavor and aroma at this relatively high abv."
"A light orange color with a two finger head. The head was an off white color. A hop smell which I like, with a hint of citrus. The taste is excellent, one of my favorite IPA's. The mouth feel was crisp and clean. This is a beer that is very drinkable and will be a regular beer that I purchase. I have to rate this as one of my top 5 beers of any style."
"Pale light orange pour with a fluffy white head. Smell is stale like light hop aroma, and oxidation. Tastes oddly sweet, mildly hopped, and of alcohol. Strange flavors, obviously not as fresh as it should be. As is, quite below average."
"FIRE...."
"A very enjoyable IPA, with some unique herbal quality. Bitterness and abv can become tiresome, but not too bad."
"Big thanks John.. I love a good IPA and this more than qualifies... cheers."
"The date on the bottle is 7/30/07 but it still tastes great. The hops are still fairly strong and all the qualities of an IPA are there. A nice fluffy head formed as well, about one inch. The dryness is pleasant, the carbonation is low, the fruitiness and bitterness are there as well. The nose is noticeably weak but I'm sure that's because it's past date. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both fantastic. I should have drank this a long time ago, but I'm not disappointed with the quality at all. Recommended, either 6 months old or fresh."
"D - An excellent IPA that doesn't let the hops completely rule the roost like most American IPAs do. Good malt balance and a very brawny body that, while making it a pleasure to drink, keeps me from reaching for more than one."
"Pours clear copper amber with a very sizeable off white head from too firm a pour. Nose is basically like sticking your nose in a can of pineapples. Just thick pineapple syrup. Flavor is very tangy on the start. Then you get a very salty hop hit with slightly vibrant citrus tones. Feel has a good carbonation to it and the liquid is even. Drinkable, yes. Even though it leans heavily towards the salty side, it still has a decent leve of balance that keep things going."
"D: went down fast...enough said"
"Great carbonation and the mouthfeel is full, I could definatly drink a few of these, not my favorite in style (I tend to go more for the citrus hop flavors) but this is a great beer non-the-less."
"There is a strong citrus/orange taste and a sweet aftertaste. Good beer with food. If you're a fan of the wheat beer, you'll like this one."
"I love this beer. Just a great IPA. It is readily available nearly everywhere in Columbus including most chain grocery stores and has saved me from BMC so many times. Long live GLBC."
"The aroma here is citrus and citrus with sweet citrus--tangerine, oranges. Very fragrant. Crsip and medium bodied, typical IPA mouthfeel. This is one IPA that leans toward the sweet side of things. Interesting, when it is colder, th esweet orange notes dominate and I am left wishing for more bitterness to balance that...but now that the beer has warmed I am left with lots of grapefruit pith bitterness in the finish. Certainly a serviceable IPA but not very complex (my how spoiled we have become!), a bit too sweet."
"Beer pours out a nice rich golden color, lively carbonation. Beer gives a very nice 1"" head, with excellent lacing all the way down. Smell seemed somewhat faint, but the taste had a nice strong hop finish. Mouthfeel was crisp, lively with the carbonation, very nice IPA."
"I'd like to try this one again if I could-maybe the next time that I am in the area I'll try this Ohio beer as I tend to like this style & Great Lakes usually makes some good brews."
"D: This goes down way too easy given the alcohol level, a very dangerous beer. An excellent example of a hoppy, yet well balanced IPA. Still one of my favorites, I need to pick this up more often. Highly recommended."
"Clear orange amber color with adequate head. Modest lacing. Aroma of citrus. Taste is a very nice balance of sweet malt and citrus hops. Finishes dry and clean with little aftertase. Feels good in the mouth and is eminently drinkable. This could become my evreyday beer."
"D: Nice hoppiness but could use more balance towards the malty side of things."
"D- This beer has a huge hop bitterness that overpowers the hops aroma and flavor. There is some nice support by the malt but the hops are just a bit too pungent. I really like hops but there is just something about this beer that a don't care for in the hops."
"Nicely done, just not my style, lacking a bit of balance. But I am assuming that is what they intended; hopheads should be pleased."
"This poured with a fluffy, off-white/light-tan head with decent retention. The nose was slightly hoppy, but overlain with an alcohol sharpness. The color was a bright deep-yellow. The mouthfeel was medium with a light hoppiness on the palate. The finish was distinctly hoppy, somewhat citrusy, like grapefruit. It masked its 7.5% ABV well."
"I like this beer quite well. It's one of the better IPAs that I have had. This one is worth having."
"The Commodore pours a clear copper in color with a white head. The aroma is exhibits notes of biscuit, caramel, piney hops with a fruitiness to it. Full-bodied mouthfeel that's crisp around the edges. Flavor has a thick malty backbone to it. Hoppy bitterness in the middle. Hops combine both a piney and citrusy flavor that transitions into an ale fruitiness. Very juicy and mouthwatering. The 7.5% alcohol is hardly noticeable on the flavor. Nicely done."
"It's a great beer, just with a 7.5%ABV and a strong hop character, it gets a little grating for me, personally, with a full awareness that others will most certainly disagree and that's ok. We're all different, but this brew let's me peek into your world for a minute, hop-head, and I could enjoy about 3 pints of this bad boy and be well satisfied."
"A light golden to copper color with an eighth of an inch white forming. That head dissolves away quickly, though. The strong fragrance of citrus hits the nose at first scent, followed bytouches of pine and earthy fragrances. The aroma ends with a touch of malt sweetness, to even it out. The taste has the malt coming out at the start and it continues till midway, then an intense grapefruit flavor strikes the palate. Surprisingly, it leaves a salty aftertaste following ever sip. A medium bodied feel, that stays that way all the way through, it does have a slight tingle from the carbonation, but takes nothing away. A well balanced IPA, with unique strength of bitterness, this is a hop lovers everyday beer."
"Medium body, nicely carbonated and smooth in the mouth. Really warm for an IPA but I'm not complaining. I'll enjoy the rest of this sixer."
"Poured a bright orange color with some murkiness. Head was a nice creamy white color with great retention, but did not leave a great deal of lacing. Smell was a little lacking, but toward the end of the session I was able to pick out some floral aroma. Taste is mostly citrus and delicious. Somewhat of a watery oily mouthfeeling. I was actually able to taste more from the bottle than on tap."
"Bottle: Poured an orangey color ale with a big foamy head with some good retention but low lacing. Aroma of bitter hops with no discernable citrus notes of floral notes. Taste is also dominated by bitter hops with a dry finish and some weak caramel malt. Body is about average with some good carbonation. Slightly below the standard for the style and not the best from this great brewery."
"D: Alcohol is hidden nicely in the taste but this drinks dangerously easy for 7.5%. If I had more, I'd have another."
"Medium-full with medium carbonation. A rich sticky feel but not too overwhelming. It still manages to be refreshing."
"D: The alcohol doesn't rear its head at all, aiding the drinkability. That abv is reasonably high though so a few bottles will do you in. Nice hop body though, especially for an IPA."
"Clear and dark gold, the beer was capped by a fluffy white head that settled quickly to a thin cap, leaving behind some delicate, transient lace. Floral aroma with mild citrus and fruit notes. Just a hint of toasty, sweet malts as well. Strong bitterness up front became pine resin towards the finish. Solid caramel maltiness with some sweetness that lessens at the end. Hope were sometimes grassy, mostly pine and floral. Bitterness really lingered. Alcohol flavour was faint and gave it a bit of spiciness. Warmth was pleasant. Medium bodied with fine carbonation and chewy malt. Pretty good stuff. The use of hops was a little different than a lot of other IPAs and the balance was quite good for the bitterness level."
"Drinkability - a little too brash for my everyday needs, but certainly on the short list when a stiff IPA is in order."
"This is a very, very drinkable IPA....surprising considering the high ABV."
"I think this beer is unique tasting, it is very complex to me. It has a sweet fruity pineapple-like quality on the swallow, then finishes with an earthy bitter dryness, maybe a little too bitter for some.... it's very strange, and I'm loving every minute of it. The higher ABV is buzzing my senses, but the smooth (almost oily) medium bodied mouthfeel makes me keep going for more. The appearence is crystal clear golden amber, with a lively head that retains well. Smell is subtle but complex. A real winner here in my book - will happily purchase again."
"Pours out a crystal clear golden orange with about a finger of white head. Nice lacing. It's always pleasant to have an IPA after a long while without - the aroma is so enjoyable in it's floral hoppiness, as it is in this one. The flavor is IPAish, for certain - it starts off tasting like flowers, if that makes sense, and the powerful hops set in quickly. The aftertaste lingers quite a bit, as well. Overall, it's good, but not great, as the bitterness is almost too much. On the other hand, it's really smooth in the mouth - impressively so. I can drink it easily enough. Not bad, but there are better IPAs."
"Pours a clean golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is hoppy, some malt tones, and caramel. The taste is hoppy and malty, lots of caramel. This brew is nice, but just not hoppy enough to be a good IPA, but still is tasty. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brew, but to much on the malty side."
"At seven some odd percent, this is an incredibly quaffable IPA. It is quenching and full of a modest - but assertive - character. Great Lakes Brewing offer products of great quality - this is no exception. A great, textbook offering of the IPA style, I enjoyed this on its own as a nice after dinner tipple!"
"Thanks to Kingpin for the bottle. This pours a clear pale amber color with a fine white head that quickly dissipates and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. The smell is of citrussy hops. The taste is hoppy, with a grapefruit flavor predominating, as well a a good fruity malt backing(apricot?). This is a nicely balanced IPA with a rich and smooth mouthfeel. According to the label, the alcohol content is 7.5%, which is higher than I would expect from the taste. This is a very drinkeable IPA, tempered only by the high ABV. This is by no means a hop monster, just a nice well-balanced IPA."
"I recommend this beer for just about anybody who is not afraid of flavor and wants a refreshing drink."
"Overall: An interesting and unique take on the IPA style. Malty, but not in an English IPA sort of way, it adds dimension without taking away from the tongue ripping character of the American style. Another solid winner by the folks from Ohio."
"D- a great IPA, hides the 7.5% alcohol exceptionally well"
"orangy gold with a big white head that leaves lots of lace. as soon as i opened the bottle i could smell bready yeast and sweet sweet hoppy goodness. nose is piney, grapefruit, malty and yeast. i love the bready yeast character this one has. too often the ipas are overwhelmed by the hoppiness. taste is mostly grapefruit with some pine, malt and yeast. just a little bitter as well. full - medium body with a bit of a dry finish. pleasure to drink and a great gift from a friend who took a trip to the midwest. cheers to comrades who share the love."
"Not a lot to say about this beer, but if you are looking for an American IPA on the hoppy side, you should be happy with this beer."
"D- as with most IPAs, the strength and boldness keeps this from being a session beer, but i would never turn down one...or two....or three."
"D: Very good. Well balanced. Not very heavy for such a strong beer. The alcohol is well hidden. I could definately have 2 or 3."
"This is a nice IPA overall - would be interested to try it with a little less abv, as it seems, in my humble opinion, to add a bit too much sweetness to it. Anyway, I've had several offerings from this brewery and can't say that this one is one of my favorites, but it's certainly decent, to say the least, esp. as it progresses. It is a tough style to contend with with all of the competition - I'ts nice - but, well, mellow (other than abv)."
"The alcohol is not particularly noticeable for its ABV and I would drink two or three."
"Last swigs: Citrusy grapefruit sraight up American IPA. Some IPAs might offer a broader palate, but as a focused bright leafy dry IPA, kudos to this one!"
"Finishes clean after a crisp dryness, medium bodied and very tasty. Another great one from a great brewery."
"Pours two fingers of foamy head over a light amber, orange-copper crystal clear beer. Looks exactly how an IPA should, even leaving solid lacing as it downs. Nose is fairly mild, mostly just floral hops and a touch of very light malt character. Great flavor. In no particular order: a long fruity hoppy aftertaste (grapefruit, oranges, peaches?), and light sweet caramel malt. The beer sweetens as it warms, which makes for a perfect balance to the bitterness. This one's a super-hoppy IPA with a great fruit character. A really solid IPA."
"Drinkability: Awesome. Great hop bitterness would stand up to some spicy asian food or raw fish. Worth seeking out at least for a try."
"The beer pours a nice amber with a decent head that is slow to diminish. The aroma is of great citrus hops with some sweet malts behind them. The taste is a great hop balance that somewhat overpowers the malt backbone, great for a hophead like me. The beer is rather crisp with well hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable IPA."
"Pours a clear amber, decent one finger white head, dropped a lot of lacing, settles to a nice layer and ring, good retention. Smell is sweet, caramel, piney hops, some floral, fruity alcohol, not very fragrant but the aroma thats there is quite nice. Taste is very malty, sweet, a bit sugary, almost cloying, spicy bitterness, pine, alcohol, fruits, almost has a Belgian feel to it. Mouthfeel is full bodied, very thick, with low carbonation, alcohol is well hidden. Found this hard to drink, something about the mouthfeel doesn't feel right to me, just thick and heavy without a lot of flavour to fill it out."
"Drinkability: strong beer, so just one a night will do (goes down nice though)"
"but there ipa is nothing special. oh well."
"Nighty-nite..."
"Pours a soft copper color with a quickly disappearing head. A lot of lacing. A very flowery smell with some hops to it and citrus. Very smooth taste with hints of malt and not too overwhelming hops to it. Avery nice and smooth IPA very drinakble and refreshing and not too harsh."
"Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a pint glass with a thin head, heavy lacing, and a relatively non-distinct aroma. The taste, however, is quite distinct, featuring a medium to high hoppiness with a strong fruit and floral overtone that, when coupled with the moderate carbonation, makes for a very refreshing summer beer. Often, I find IPA's dry me out a bit after a couple, but the crispness of the beer and fruit and floral tones really balances out the hops and makes it easy to drink. A really great IPA."
"Medicinal mouthfeel, otherwise like an IPA should be. 4 Just not super-drinkable. I can't get over the super-high ABV of this beer, and it just punished me when it was regularly $5.99 or $6.99..."
"Overall- A pretty decent IPA. I could see myself buying a 6er of this, at a reasonable price though. I paid $3 or $3.50 for a single 12 oz bottle, it wasn't THAT good."
"Overall, recommended. I got this bottle at Lone Hill, and it may have been a little old at the time, so the hops seem to have faded a bit. Still tasty, but would like to have it fresh."
"Taste: Medium to light bodied, although it did show some cookie crispness. The hop bite is a bit harsh with a bone dry finish that sort of throws off the balance somewhat, I tend to like my IPAs a bit more malty. It did eventually grow on me as the hoppy flavors saturated my tastebuds and the acridness of the aftertaste slowly diminished. I wouldn't drive 100 miles for this Beer, but I wouldn't mind if my local pub had it."
"Pours a moderately dark orange/copper color with a decent head, with decent retention and some lacing (poured from a bottle into a pint glass). The aroma hits you fairly quickly, which smells of fairly strong alcohol, and a nice citrus finish. Has a very fruity (grapefruit) taste, and is very bitter. Very Hoppy. Has a moderate mouthfeel, with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a very good beer, one of my favorite American IPAs."
"I thoroughly enjoy this beer, not only for the fact that it's available in many places in my area (gotta love the 12-packs) but being a hop head Commodore Perry always hits the spot. It's a smooth and bold IPA and I admit, the high alcohol level is also nice. Ever since GLBC made this a year round brew, there is always a six pack in my fridge. Keep up the good work Cleveland and go Bengals...."
"Very drinkable because it is so dry. You taste no alcohol, so you would have to look at the label to know it's 8 percent."
"Pours an insanely clear apple juice color, quite the shock. One finger fluffy white head dies down to a thin lacing. Stickiness is alright, spotty on the sides. First thing I get from the smell is a caramel malt, am I crazy? After that first scent, big citrus notes of mostly grapefruit, dominate the nose. A tiny bit of honey presents itself as well. Taste is pretty complex. Starts off somewhat bready from the good malt background and then is dominated by a lemony hop kick. That honey flavor once again surfaces but this time on the tongue. Ends up semi-dry with an earthy fruit aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Drinkability is scary good, I really enjoy this IPA. I think the finish is the best part of this brew. Don't judge a beer by how it looks that's all I have to say."
"This GLBC offering pours a clear orange copper with a nice dense head and plenty of lacing. Smell is a balance of malt and fruity hops. Taste is again somewhat balanced. The malt tenders the hoppiness. The fruitiness is clearer here and seems to be green apple like. Some bitter grapefruit as well. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, but the hops leave the palate clean. I found this to be a drinkable IPA and another fine GLBC brew."
"BB: 9/16/07"
"Drinkability - you've got to want this beer style or get into it fast to truly enjoy this beer"
"Drinkability: Quite smooth despite the complexity and strength. Watch out for ths one!"
"D: 7.5% alcohol, thats all I have to say about that. So if you want a session you probably should be a seasoned drinker."
"A nice IPA but at least a tier below Headhunter or White Rajah, our other year round locals."
"D: Very good, tasty, easy goin' down. A beer I'd drive 25-35 miles to Lone Hill or Walnut for, but since there are local IPAs in CA that are just as good, I feel lucky. But, if I'm ever in the Midwest, a definite re-tasting is in order. A very solid effort from Great Lakes. Actually, I'm reaching the end of this, it's just so good, I'm going to have to give it a 5 for drinkability."
""
"Very nice IPA all around. Poured a nice copper/amber color with a long lasting 3 finger head. A very pleasing aroma of hops dominated (Cascade? Fuggles?). This is by no means a one dimensional ale. A solid malt base provides a complex mixture of bready malts to a dominate, yet pleasing hop bitterness. The finish was clean and dry. At over 7% ABV, this is an ale to sip"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, just mind the alcohol content."
"D- Easy drinking. I could drink more than one in a sitting. However, it doesn't really do anything to set itself apart from other IPAs. I would drink it again but not really seek it out."
"The high ABV means I wouldn't be drinking a lot of these in one sitting, but the clean finish on this IPA tempts me to try."
"Taste is full of sweet & bitter notes, emphasizing the hops and citrus. The mouthfeel is smooth and juicy, with a light body and a carbonation level to match. Great lingering bitterness on this puppy...really enjoyed the aftertaste. The Commodore drinks well, but is perhaps a bit too one-sided to be a truly outstanding IPA. I'm looking forward to trying the other beer styles from the Cleveland crew."
"Great Lakes Brewing is a favorite of mine and always has been...yum!"
"The taste though is very IPA'ish. High bitterness comes accross first from the hops. This is definitley more of an earthy hop- pine and grass. Bitterness lingers quite a bit. The taste isn't too complex. The mouthfeel is fine, carbonation is right on, and it's a light IPA in the mouth. The drinkability though is a little boring to me, so while I would get this beer again at some point, I wouldn't want to drink it all the time."
"D: An above average IPA. Look for this and give it a try. I would come back without reservation."
"Pours a nice golden, one finger white head,with some retention,and a nice lace. Smell is of tart fruit, and alchol. Body is medium,with carbionation. Taste is graprfruit up front with a bitter hoppy finish. Bit of an after taste dropped the taste rating for me,but still a great brew."
"Drinkability is good here."
"When I uncapped this little 12oz bottle, my expectations was well this will be an alright IPA. The beer poured like a golden elixir into my glass, The look is quite exceptional very clear and the color of a golden ale. If you all remembered those old novelty items where it would like beer was being poured into a glass by a spigot. Well that's the way this looks. The smell reminds me of a little Avery Maharaja, quite fruity. Taste is very good, it again reminds me of the Avery Maharaja. Drinkability is good because a hint of alcohol comes through, however the bitterness pretty much masks the alcohol content."
"Pours a mostly clear honey amber body with a one finger vanilla head. Decent retention and good patch lacing. Aroma is citrusy hops with a note of grassiness. Caramel and bready malt scents underneath. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a zippy carbonation. A bit of a hop bite on the tongue. Taste is ruled by a grapefruit hops bitterness that has just enough of a sweet malt spine to balance. A citrusy note of tangerine and some cut hay round out the finish. Nice complexity and hops crispness. An excellent American IPA here. Can't believe I waited so long to discover this."
"A clean and crisp mouthfeel is a result of some tight carbonation and a refreshing smoothness in the finish. I try not to be bias, since I am such a fan of the brewery, but this is a really nice beer. Not the overall best from Great Lakes by any means, but really quality beer non-the-less."
"Overall-This is a really nice IPA, a fairly representative example of a quality midwest IPA. However, it is big at 8% and has quailities of DIPA, with the level of hop and malt presence."
"D: It seems to me that Great Lakes has tweaked the recipe for this year's batch compared to last summer's trial. I was not a fan of last season's effort as it was overly bitter and lacked balance, but this year's Commadore Perry has made me a fan. I will seek out this offing again. Recommeded."
"Drinkability - Wow...8% ABV? Well hidden. I was thinking that this might be a refreshing session beer. Guess it might be a short but refreshing session anyway. A good drinker. Takes me back to Plebe year History of Sea Power."
"Overall this is much better than previous batches of this beer that I've tried. In fact, it was so good that I wonder if there's some merit to the rumors that Great Lakes' quality control has suffered as of late. As far as this one is concerned, though, it represents the brewery proudly."
"D - A very fine IPA. It is so hoppy it almost seems like a DIPA."
"Not in the same class as Bear Racer 5, Celebration Ale, Hop 'Otten, Stone, and Smuttynose, but still a solid IPA."
"A very good IPA indeed. If this does replace Burning River as i've heard in the forum. I truely enjoyed thisone more."
"Oh yeah this is a strong IPA that I could drink all night except the alcohol level would put a stop to it a bit early. A VERY recommended ale!"
"drinkability is good. balanced fairly well. a bit overly fruity, but still nice."
"A solid IPA leaning slightly toward the English style in terms of malt presence, but more than enough hops depth to remain in the American branch. A bit of toffee in the malt, quickly overshadowed by a blunt hops bittering. Finish is smooth and even. The abv is well integrated in the flavor profile."
"It's been a few months since I've tasted a Hop Wallop but for some reason this beer is similiar. More toned down but similiar. Anything similiar to Hop Wallop is an IPA I would drink any day of the week. Another great beer from Great Lakes."
"D: Practically a double IPA, and some my find the bitterness a little harsh."
"I can't say I'd recommend this beer."
"Pours a clear golden amber with a half finger head . Good retention and lacing. Aroma is sweet malts and nice grapefruit hops. Taste is brown sugary malts up front with citrus and pine hops cleaning off the palate. Creamy mouthfeel but not chewy. Excellent IPA!"
"Wow, I never thought the day would come where I could pick up a sixer of a Great Lakes IPA right in the Ohio Valley, recently the microbrews have come into the Steubenville/Wintersville OH areas in specifically the two Kroger grocery stores. With Great Lakes products came Erie Brewing, Magic Hat, Atwater, and more. I'm happy to see this happening here's the IPA and the bottle states 7.5% abv when I visited the brewery back in 04 it was listed at 8%. Appearance has a light bronze copper appearance even a pale peach lighter in color than the Burning River Pale, large off white creamy textured head forms thick and dwindles slow clinging to the edges of the pint leaving even rings of lace with each sip. Aromatics contains heavy grapefruit peel action with a sugary coating much sweeter smelling than actual grapefruit, the malts used here are mildly toasted with somewhat of a spicy rye note even though I now none of that was utilized here. Flavors a bitey somewhat acidic wave of high alpha hops grapefruit peels, pine, and grassy components all dive onto the palate with some initial sweetness quickly gets wiped away. Not as diverse and well balanced as some standard IPAs but at 7.5 this one is on the border of a DIPA definitely some assertive alcohol noted in the taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light slippery textured hop oils gliding on the palate definitely sticks to the tongue and carbonation feels natural and carris the brew well pretty moderate. Drinkability is great I could handle a few of these but really I've been enjoying one out of the sixer at a time, spreading them out has been an enjoyable experience between finishing nursing school this week and catching up on cutting the grass this brew is substantial enough to fill my hophead cravings. I believe in my last review on tap I yearned for this beer to be bottled, well I guess I owe a thank you to the folks at Great Lakes, goo job guys."
"Way to go on this one GL!!!"
"At 8% this is a very big IPA, and that plus the lingering bitterness takes a bit away from the drinkability. Overall, very good, solid IPA and another fine offering from GL."
"Poured out a light yellow gold color crowned by a thin just off white head. The nose is sweet pink grapefruit pith backed by slight amount of hops. The taste was both malt sweet and hoppy bitter along with some slight sour citrus notes. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and medium carbonation. Was a very drinkable and fairly enjoyable beer."
"Overall a good IPA, with a hop flavor and bitterness more in line with a double IPA. I liked it."
"Light-medium body, a very refreshing, beautiful beer."
"This very decent IPA has a clear amber hue with a massive, foamy head. The lace clings heavily to the last sip. Very appealing hoppy aroma, cream notes when swirled. Commodore Perry has a well-balanced hoppiness that is not as bitter as it is sweet. Grapefruity bite, finishes with a slight hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a delciously syrupy texture. This is a highly drinkable IPA, but with such high ABV, only a few glasses will be manageable in a short time span. However, its tastiness can make it difficult to sip. It pairs well with a creamy goat cheese. The sweetness of the beer's grapefruit notes plays well against the sour creaminess of the cheese. An above average beer for the style."
"This is a well done IPA but that's it. There are warmer IPAs with more flavors other than up front hops and there are hop bombs that manage to do all that bitter with a temprement. This split the middle and did not impress."
"Very well done, a top notch IPA."
"Grab it while you can if you close, I may have to go back tomorrow and buy the last 3 sixer's!"
"This beer is very drinkable, but just not that notable."
"GLBC missed the mark a bit on this one, but it's still worth a try."
"D- I wasn't blown away. I was excited about an IPA from Great Lakes, but this just doesn't seem like its ready to sit at the table with the adults yet. Reminded me of Hop Wallop dialed down a notch or two."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. It's easy to drink considering the 7.5% abv. It will definitely sneak up on you. You really can't tell it's that strong. Overall, it's okay. I'm a big fan of Great Lakes and I think this is a step down from their usual offerings. Worth a try, but far from spectacular."
"If this makes any sense, it has X,Y & Z, but I wish there was a bit of W in there as well. GLBC know their stuff, but this could use just a pinch more of something. Yet, you won't go wrong with this one."
"All I know is this stuff kicks ass."
"Cheers"
"I am very happy this is now a regular beer. This IPA is a bright clear light amber color with a nice frothy white head. The aromas of floral hops are very apparent and very slight background of sweet grapefruit hops. There is a slight oaky aroma as it warms. Also the background of alcohol comes out as well. The bitter toasty piney grapefruit hops. Slight toasty malt flavor, not balanced but it is very good. The mouthfeel is light and crisp with loads of bitterness, and really dry. This is definitely one easy to drink IPA."
"Poured a clear honey amber with a small skim of white bubbles that I guess is suppose to act as Commodore Perry's head of foam. When the ""head of foam"" fizzled away, it left behind some white bubbles as rings and maybe a few bubbles acting as lace. The beer's appearance is made mostly of just bubbles floating around aimlessly. It smells like Great Lakes took a giant grapefruit and then dipped it in candy sugar. Then they combined the sugar coated grapefruit with citrus hops. Once the beer really warms up, it smells like cold cereal without the milk. Unusual, but good. I'll give that. Now this is where you get to taste the sugar coated grapefruit combined with the citrus hops. After the citrus hops have gone, a slight taste of toasted malt emerges. I believe the toasted malts calmed down the aggressiveness of the sugar coated grapefruit and the citrus hops and made this IPA a very well rounded brew. Without it, it would have just been grapefruit juice with hops added. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with an aftertaste that tasted just like the aftertaste you would get after drinking a whole glass of grapefruit juice. Grab your grapefruit spoon and did in because you're going to need it. A nice addition to Great Lakes brewed year round list. Would the ""Hero of Lake Erie," Commodore Perry himself drink this beer if he was still alive? Only if he liked grapefruits with a passion."
"Overall: This is one of my favorite American IPAs. It bears little resemblance to the English versions of the style, in that it uses American hops and has much more hops on the nose than would an English IPA. This beer is better balanced than many of the West Coast interpretations. I wish it poured a bigger head, and I wish it were bottle-conditioned."
"Only my second beer from Great Lakes, but another home run as well. I look forward to trying more from this brewery... On to my wants list."
"The beer is creamy in the mouth and has overall lower carbonation levels. It's got a medium-heavy body. This is an IPA I'll definitely buy again, I look forward to next spring/summer when it'll become part of the regular lineup...according to the website. Could drink it all night and would make a good session brew but for the 8%abv."
"Another great brew from Great Lakes. Come back to Indiana!"
"Very drinkable. Definately makes good session fare, as well as good crossover fare with an interesting and somewhat unique tropical and floral hoppiness. It would be my pleasure to have this tasty treat again."
"Overall an easy drinking APA. A bit maltier than I expected, but enjoyable nonetheless. Thanks to robertdoesbeer for this one."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied, a bit dry on the finish. Overall it goes down easily and at 7.5% abv I'd have to watch out because I could easily down this brew quickly. I must say I was expecting a little more from a Great Lakes IPA...but overall this is a solid, well brewed offering."
"I am enjoying this beer in the bottle. The color is a rich copper color with nice clarity. The smell is hoppy but with an old world feeling to it, hard to explain but nice. The taste is somewhat bitter but smooth and creamy. I think I like the Lagunitas IPA better, but this is still very nice. It is very drinkable, however I feel that it is not asession beer and that it might get hard to drink more than one or two in a row. Thumbs up though."
"D: It isn’t filling and hides the 7.50% (as listed on the bottle) ABV well. I suppose it would go down easy if you like the taste, I, however, did not. I’ve liked the other beers that I’ve had from Great Lakes (Nosferatu & Edmund Fitzgerald) and this is one of my favored styles, but I just didn’t like this beer."
"I was very excited to see that Great Lakes was bottling this brew this year- even though I had not had it yet! Well, this review is a bit delayed-since I had this brew the week of its release earlier in the year. Overall, this is a very fine IPA. It is a great session IPA. It is not to overpowering on the tastebuds, and the 8% is well hidden. Cheers to you Great Lakes on a great IPA!"
"Very light, slightly floral, grainy aroma. Light copper orange in color with a fluffy white two finger thick head. Sweet malt and bitter hops get equal play in the fore....both linger. The malts meld with slightly toasted grain notes while the hops become citric and floral on a seperate path. There is a sort of delicate strength to this beer. Its not bullish, but it has a lot of flavor concentration. Quite nice and a pleasant suprise....I especially like the sweet toasty flavor that lingers in the aftertatse alongside the orange rind bitterness. I wish more IPAs were like this."
"Golden copper body, clean, with a puffy, marshmallowy, orange-white head. Sharp grapefruit hops over light biscuity malt. Juicy citrus (grapefruit) and resiny hops sting the tongue. Slightly buttery, rich toffee malt (butter brickle). Sweetish turns to fruity, bitter, and dry. Medium body. Dry finish. A nice IPA."
"Pours a burnt gold in color and clear a small white head fades to a ring. A nice perfumy sweet citrusy hop aroma, nice sweet tangerines. Smooth creamy mouthfeel displays the nice balance between the citrusy hops and malts in the taste. A good size grapefruit rind bitterness in the finish. ABV is towards the high end for the style but you wouldn't notice it in the taste, very well balanced. Nice to see an IPA by Great Lakes, very well done and quite drinkable."
"The bottle says it's best enjoyed before 09/26/2006, but a couple weeks shouldn't make too much of a difference here. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a copper/orange color, with a thick off-white head. The head lasted a long time, with excellent lacing. The aroma is citrusy, with a bit of grassy hops too. The taste is mainly grapefruit and pine, with a slightly sweet middle and a floral bitter hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is medium, and also a bit slick. Drinkability is pretty good too, the alcohol isn't too noticable in this beer. This is a pretty good beer, but then I don't think I've ever had a bad beer from Great Lakes."
"A extra smooth IPA,very tastey.I could drink this one all nite long."
"A straightforward, solid and easy IPA. I like it. Not too heavy, not too light, not as fruity as my favorites, but it has a flavor profile I'd definitely come back to if I could get it down here..."
"I don't know why they keep honouring people in a war they lost, but this is a winning IPA. Very good aroma, with C-hop, and smooth. Very nice orangey appearance. A touch of fruit. Had this on-tap at the brewery and its citrus aroma, and grapefruit appearance with white head were apparent. A solid IPA."
"For as long as I've been a BA, I've lamented the lack of an IPA from my favorite brewery. Now that it has arrived, I have to say that I'm impressed. They've used a kick ass combination of hops and have added enough of them to satisfy this sometimes hard to please hophead. I would ask for a DIPA next, but Commodore Perry is most of the way there already."
"The mouthfeel is full and vibrant, well carbonated, offering a rollercoaster of complexity. As the beer warm it mellows a bit, yet still hits with a bit of hops before rolling into the slightly sweet finish. Another great beer from Great Lakes."
"Medium mouthfeel and very smooth. Light carbonation. Another in the small (but growing) pile of quality IPAs I've tried that would please the non-hop-head as well. Gotta get more."
"P.S. My 100th review and what a way to celebrate!"
"Drinkability is good. This is a great brew. Truly a great representation of the American IPA. I am proud of this particular brewing. I love an IPA and this is one I would recommend to the uninformed."
"juicy, sweet flavor with a hop tang at the end. it's hoppy, but not in any sort of offensive or excessive manner. in fact, the bitterness is very tame. it's drinkable, except for the %. at 8% i couldn't drink a case of this"
"Golden color. Small white head that leaves blobs of lacing. Smell is very floral and has a citrus note. Taste kicks in with a strong bitterness and a grapefruity note. Bitterness mellows a little and some balance starts to come in as you drink. At first this one seams a little harsh but it really started to grow on me. 8% is nicely hidden and not noticable at all. Not one of the top flight IPA's but certainly very drinkable. Overall an enjoyable beer. Give it a try."
"Had this on draft at the Winkin' Lizard. My ears still hurt. Aroma was light on the hops. No head or lacing. Dark yellow color. Hoppier flavor than what the aroma indicated. Nice long finish. Mouthfeel was kind of flat. Not bad, but nothing I would want to take back to Atlanta on the plane."
"Nice, bright and amazingly clear golden color. Extremely grassy and lemony aroma. I cant discern the hop type but I have had it before in this quantity. Very bitter flavor-quite hoppy and resiny but almost downright astringent in places. Just a whisper of maltyness in there. Nice mouthfeel-the hop levels make for quite the pucker!Good effort by Great Lakes. More bitter then most US IPAs but thats ok."
"Medium-light bodied with a good bit of carbonation. Pretty easy drinking despite its bitterness."
"Nice to see my local Consumer beverage in Orchard Park with a new growler station and this one of 17 taps to choose from.Poured a clear medium gold with a thinner but well retained white head American citric hops in the nose grapefruit and lemon really stick out with a very light caramel malt note but just a hint.True to form the hops prevail on the palate but a cereal grain like maltiness underneath the resiny grapefruit-like flavors shows thru even more so as I drink more in the finish.A well put together IPA has nice hop flavors but is somewhat balanced as well,nice job here by Great Lakes."
"D: Good well balanced IPA, apperance wasn't much but very good tasting and smelling beer"
"A bit less orange than the typical big IPA, this beer pours a nice golden-amber with a creamy white head. Big aroma of both citrus and malts, with a touch of caramel in there as well. The flavor is fantastic, with assertive bitterness, strong citrus notes, bready, biscuit maltiness and a touch of caramel sweetness. Big and assertive yet a ton of malt backbone to back it up. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, but finishes just a bit dry in the back of the throat. Drikability is fantastic, and I really can't believe this is an 8% ABV beer. Hides the alcohol really well. I am continually amazed that Great Lakes makes such a wide range of really solid offerings. As much as I like GLBC, this one caught me off guard. Nice."
"This IPA is very hop-centric. Bitterness stays strong from start to finish. The malt aspects are very crisp and clean, but is definitely subordinate to the hops."
"drinkability: good"
"Drinkability: Despite the alcoholic notes in the flavor, they seem to enhance the beer's fruitiness, and don't diminish its drinkability. I like the beer more as I have more of it."
"bottle dated as best by sometime in September, sampled at a cookout during my Madison visit"
"A quality ipa from Great Lakes."
"This beer is a clear dark golden-amber color with a medium fluffy off-white head with decent retention. Thin sheets of lacing. Aroma of grassy hops and citrus. Medium body with a smooth mouthfeel. Piney hops at first, with sweet malt and spices in the background. At 7.5%, the beer seems to straddle the line between ""Regular"" and ""Imperial"" IPA. The finish is bitter hops at first, with a resiny malt undertone. The aftertaste is long-lasting and dry. As with most of GLBCs beers, this is well done."
"The mouth is moderate and drying, almost puckery. On the right night, I could drink a dangerous amount of this beer."
"Yet another solid brew from Great Lakes. I couldn't believe it was 8.0%!"
"Very tasty brew."
"Best Before Sep 19 2006. Crystalline peach juice with a super-thin, finely attenuated creamy white head. Roundish sour orange and grapefruit juice aromas mix with a pleasant sugar-sweet scent. Very little sweetness in the taste, however: the Commodore is all bitter and biting, with mineral notes abounding -- kind of like eating a grapefruit peel with a rusty fork. Not as bad as that sounds, but really, this is lacking a malt bill formidable enough to take on the massively bitter hops. It wouldn't need to strive for ""balance"" or anything (I mean, this IS an IPA, after all), but just represent for the grains out there. Or something. Anyway, mostly dry mouthfeel with some juicy notes. Moderately drinkable. The bitterness is just not the kind I look for in an IPA. Maybe it's just that I expect more from Great Lakes, maybe this is a bad batch -- in any case, near the bottom of my IPA list."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a Stone Ruination glass. Crystal clear and yellow with a sticky think white head. The aroma is nicely balanced hoppiness, with some strong malt background. Very nice and not one-dimensional. Same with the flavor, which was hoppy but not bitter, and malty but not too sweet, just a really smooth beer that's easy to drink. The oily texture coats your tongue so the flavor lingers. This is really good, and I don't think I ever saw it before this week? Must be a new bottled beer from Great Lakes, I hope it becomes a regular."
"This reminds me more of a british style IPA. However, the citrus hop character is a little too aggressive for that style. All in all a great beer and highly recommended."
"overall- I have been looking forward to this beer ever since i first heard it was coming out. Being that great lakes is one of my favorite (and local) breweries, i had pretty high expectations for this. All said and done this is and EXCELLENT beer and i will buy plenty of this in the future."
"Overall the first 'so-so' from Great Lakes I've ever tried (and I believe I've tried them all - in the bottle & their pub). I almost wish I didn't experience what I just experienced. I'm finishing off the rest of the bottle (in my tasting glass) and I'm very sad. Still a good beer by most micro fare, but a let down based on Great Lakes gems. I'll stick with Burning River, thanks."
"Drinkability - this is very good, and goes down well. I'd say it's very sessionable."
"D - A solid IPA but nothing special about this one. The drying bitterness seems to be the dominant characteristic of this one. I would not go out of my way for this one but would try it again."
"Very drinkable, especially at 8%, no alcohol taste at all."
"D: I don't think it's possible for GL to make a bad beer, but this is definitely my least favorite of their offerings. There are several IPA's out there that are worse, but I tire of this beer quickly."
"Clear, bright copper topped by a light off-white head. The head is not long lasting, and just leaves a touch of a ring on the rim of the glass. Lots of citrus grapefruit on the nose. A mixture of grapefruit and orange. Just the lightest touch of caramel. The taste has a lot of caramel, a light touch of grapefruit, a hint of bubble gum, and some pralines on the finish. More delicate than I expected. The mouth feel is dry, and slightly slick. Good drinkability, I cant believe this is 8%. That must be a misprint"
"Pours golden amber in color, with a rich off-white head and enough lace to scare me a little. Nose is piney, citric hops and lots of 'em. Sharp and juicy on the first sip, followed by a tangy, smooth, creamy quality. Lingering hop bitterness with aromatic notes of mint. Rather full bodied, a little bit sweet, but with great hop interplay. VERY easy drinking . . . the label says 7.5% - is this really 7.5%? Somehow I put five of these down last night (it was hot and humid) in only a few hours (no, I wasn't driving!) but today it seems a bit too big for the heat . . . a wintertime IPA? A small Double IPA? Whatever, this is definitely worth tracking down, even though I normally don't go in for the American IPA craze."
"This beer poured a clear yellow gold color and formed a pure fluffy white head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of cascade hops with a touch of citrus centennial. A interesting carmel aroma as well give an air of sweetness to it. The flavor was of hops, carmel and touch of citrus. It has a fairly smooth body and the finish is slightly astrigent with a bit of a burnt aspect to it. I can see where some see a battle between American and British style IPAs with this beer. But still a good beer."
"Color is a clear yellow-gold in color. Hints of orange as well. Whitish lace is prevelant...thick and sticky. Long-lasting finger-thin layer of head lasts and lasts. Aromas are a nasally-pleasing mix of grassy and estery fruit hops, supported by a malty sweet base. Flavors weren't as BIG as I'd hoped. It's a well-balanced IPA that uses the caramel sweetness to offset the multiple hop tones that wash over the palate. Finishes with a long-lasting dryness of pine sap and a touch of ABV warmth. Nice mouthfeel, not as thick as I'd hoped. Creamy-smooth, with just a hint of carbonation. For an 8% beer, it was gone in a flash. So very well-balanced."
"Normally I'm not into ""hop bombs"" but I could drink a few of these."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. The beer is well carbonated. The alcohol is well incorporated. This is not a bad beer and I will probably rotate this into my beer purchases next year."
"12 oz bottle. This beer pours a moderate golden color with a half finger of head over top, falling to a sparse coat over top. The brew is clear and there is little to no carbonation bubbling up in it. A deep inhale brings a nice moderate caramel maltyness, a mild grainey character, with nice sweet and citrusy hops as well as a more mild earthy hop. This one is giving me impressions of both an American And a British IPA. The flavor hits with caramel malt, followed by a solid earthy and slightly citrusy hop. A moderate bitterness hits on the finish, with a slight creshendo after a few seconds. The bitterness hangs on pretty solid into the finish as well. Mouthfeel is moderate with a carbonation on the light end of moderate. This one is not bad. It really does seem to be stuck between American and English IPA. The bitterness is a touch harsh as well. I don't think this one would be my choice for an IPA when I hit the stores, as others just draw me more, but this one is by no means bad. Just not to my taste."
"Pours a crystal clear shade of light gold. Three finger head is soapy but dense, with outstanding retention and sticky lacing. Hoppy american nose like grapefruit and pear, some mild citrus, mabye a pinch of pine, and some background malt aromas. Taste is initially sweet with toasty munich malt directly followed by an onslaught of chinook, simcoe, and cascade flavors. The dry, bitter aftertaste is oily with notes of pine needles ...the kind of aggressive acidity that will put a smile on any hophead's face. Medium in body and carbonation, a pleasent resinous mouthfeel. Loads of hop flavor here, but not overly bitter. The finish is dry and saturated with hops, but fairly balanced by the touch of malt sweetness."
"Drinkability/Notes: This is amongst the best IPA's on the market and I wouldn't argue with you if you thought it was the best."
"Glad to see this beer available in Central Kentucky. Being a lover of IPAs, I couldn't wait to try this one. A typical copper / amber hue with nice head retention and carbonation. Aromas are slight, both with the malts and hops--pleasant, but light. Tastes sweetly of malt at first, but then a decent kick of hop bittering to follow. The pine, grass, or spice flavor of the hops are a bit lacking, but lightly present. Flavors create a detergent-like flavor just before the finish. Body is rich and firm throughout. Finishes bitter with a hoppy dry finish. The alcohols are ver controled and contribute nicely to the beer."

"On tap at Boston's. I was very excited to see this brand new release on tap, as I stopped in for a beer. Pours a clear golden color with a slight orange tint. Thick white fluffy head has good retention. Citrusy and floral hop aroma. Soft caramel malt backbone, which holds its own, but does not become too sweet or cloying. Nice amount of bitterness, along with floral, and citrusy, mostly grapefruit flavors. Finishes very much in the floral flavors. Appropriate carbonation with a medium body. Tons of sticky patchwork lace coates the sides of the glass. Not overwhelming, and maybe even tame compared to Burning River. Malt and hops compliment each other here. While this may not be as exciting to a hophead as other IPAs, it is solid, and could easily be a good session beer. Another solid beer from Great Lakes."
"Drinkability- Very nice hot summer day brew. Nothing too overwhelming, just a nice drinkable brew."
"Drinks more like a 5% alcohol brew compared to it's 7.5%. I could honestly drink this IPA all day long. Been waiting for a new Great Lakes beer to be bottled as I don't make it to the brewery often and this one does not dissapoint. Luckily we will be getting draught Oktoberfest this year also."
"For some reason, this one was not listed with the sampler but was brought out on its own anyway. I drank it after the Russian Imperial Stout, so I'm not sure how this affected my opinion. Good qualities, but nothing too special for an IPA. Pretty good head and carbonation, no lacing to speak of. Easy enough to drink but not the best choice for a session beer."
"Drinkability: Dangerous stuff (I think the brewery listed it at 8% abv) but I could quaff this all day long. Strongly recommended."
"Just another day, another great beer at GLBC. Just back on tap in early August 2003, the old favorite Commodore Perry is here to please. Superb appearance and great smell of citrus fruits, flavors of citrus and rinds, what a fully hopped yet pleasing, not-over-the-top beer this is. Not yet available again in bottles, the publican explained that they're still wrangling with the State of Ohio over their label design. GLBC wants to stick with what they already have; Ohio says no. So if you want the great Commodore, head to their store in the Ohio City section of Cleveland."
"Served draught at Great Lakes with a nice full 2-finger white head that reduced and maintained well to the bottom. Left a beautiful sticky lace down the sides of the glass. The body was a orangish gold color that was very cloudy. I'm pretty sure this was served unfiltered, which made it that much better. The smell was pretty much hops & hints citrus, as well was the flavor. Along with the great flavor of hops, there seemed to be some kind of little bursts of pine & bitter orange rind. This brew finished crisp, clean, & dry. Overall a great beer that, like all Great Lakes brews, seemed to stay pretty true to the style........."
