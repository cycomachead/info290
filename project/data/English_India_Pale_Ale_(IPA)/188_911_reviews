"O: A lot of lager qualities in this one, light, crisp, etc.  Sort of like a lager gone slightly ipa-ish.  It does have some interesting fruity and hop qualities, just very light on them even for the style.  Found and drank in Bangkok, March 1st, 2015."

"The brown ale comparison really comes out in the taste, this doesn't even taste like a weak English ipa, this is just like a mild brown ale. It is what it is. Expensive and disappointing. I used to enjoy these in the 90s, they were helpful in getting my palate in shape after drinking sub-BMC type of stuff in the early half of the decade (Meister Brau), but the more I drink of these lately, the more bland and expensive they come off."
"D - Not hard to get down, but I don't want too have anymore."
"D- Worth a try for a different take on an IPA but I wont be looking for this one a again."
"D: Drinks more like a Scottish ale, very sweet malting with earthy hopping. A decent drink by itself but many will be disappointed in the hop bitterness."
"Poured dark caramel color, unusual for an IPA. Had a ruby color tint in the light, no head to note. Nose was almost more malts than hops. Tasted of SOME hops, little bitterness, but not as hoppy as I would like. Perhaps I am waaay to accustom to West Coast IPAs now. I would say for an English IPA it would do the trick."
"Sampled in 2004. When I first tried this beer I really liked it. I must have been drunk. I'm glad I've had it again to give it the correct review. IPA? Not even close. IPAs are one of my favorite styles and this has got to be the worst one I've had. This had a dark brown body, a little heavy, with a fairy thick head and a decent amount of lace. The color looks nothing like an IPA. Hops? Hardly any. Are they sure they put the right label on this? Wow. Somewhat smooth, but not a fan of the flavor at all. A scotchy malt flavor is the best way I can describe it. Or a mild version of their Scotch Ale, which I found disgusting. Maybe I'll get it again in a year or so to see what I think then."
"My wife poured this into a pint glass when I tried it. I could swear she had a Jack Daniels, ""Jack and Cola"". The color is a dark caramel color with a nice head. With the first sip I gag a little. After each drink it become easier to go down. But over all it was a challenge to drink the whole bottle. Being a huge fans of hops and IPA I was let down. I am still confuse why this is called an IPA."
"Try it for a different take on an English IPA, but not if you really want a normal IPA beer."
"Certainly not in the vain of other IPAs you may be used to, the order of the day here is more herbal and tea-like, with a burnt sweetness colliding with the bitter herbal hop finish. Think of it as an English pale with a Scottish flare and you're almost there. Mouthfeel is medium-thin and well carbonated. This beer is perfectly sessionable and fine to drink as long as you're not expecting an IPA."
"D- It isn't great but very drinkable. I could drink this as a session beer without a problem. GIve it a shot but remember it isn't a IPA!"
"I was recommended this beer by a small foreign man who offered his assistance on finding a good beer. I asked for a strong IPA and he pointed me to this, sadly."
"Not bad, but nothing like what I expected. I thought my beer had been mislabeled until I read others comments. Tasted and looked more like an Octoberfest than IPA. Brown in color with little head, lower alcohol content, and no hoppy bitterness. This is nothing like an IPA. Still, it was pretty drinkable"
"Cheers!"
"D: A little tasty, but definitely not what I had expected, goes down ok, doesn’t really seem to fit the style, so I’ll have to take the label’s word for it that the beer is an EIPA. Overall, I don’t think it’s bad, but it’s yet another English beer that has under-whelmed me."
"Much too imbalanced sweetness. Not an IPA - more of a brown ale/pale ale mix with a touch of Scottish Ale that doesn't quite come together well. My advise -don't bother with this, esp. if you are looking for an IPA."
"D: Fair. I'd have another, but the mouthfeel is definitely lacking and the appearance is boardering on horrific. Not one of the better EIPA's i've had."
"In any event, a fairly enjoyable brew but not one that I'd peg as very characteristic of the IPA style. And there are better options for bitters out there too."
"Drinkability: On its own, easy to drink but not exceptional and not a great example of the style. Paired with some Irish porter cheese it worked pretty well, though - keeping it gaelic here."
"Pours a dark brownish bronze with a decent sized head, but the most appealing part of the appearance is some nice lacing. Smells of malts with a touch of sour fruits. The taste is rather unremarkable and certainly not like an IPA-- quite weak. The taste is mainly of malts and little else. The mouthfeel is a bit stronger than the taste, but still watery. Quite drinkable because of such an easy finish. If this was not an IPA, I would feel differently but this comes up a bit disappointing."
"I will rate it lower in taste and mouthfeel for the disparity between its stated style and what it actually ends up tasting like. It's hard to know what the brewer was even going for since I really couldn't taste any hops, which are to my inexperienced palate the main ingredient in a normal IPA. Worth trying just for the odd experience but I can't recommend it beyond that."
"This beer poured a dark brown color with a decent head. The smell is malty with a touch of hops. The taste is malty and bitter with a touch of sourness. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and slightly carbonated. This is a pretty non-offensive type beer that is easy to drink."
"D - This is pretty drinkable. This is quite possibly the most off style beer I have ever had. This looks, smells and tastes like an ESB. Not a great ESB, but if someone handed this beer to me and asked what it was, in one whiff and one sip I would say, ""ESB."" I suppose it could pass as a scottish ale too, but IPA would be my last guess. There is very little hop profile, it is hardly ""pale"" and too sweet."
"Pours just like sweet tea. Literally, it has no head, has the color and body of pouring a glass of sweet tea. My wife even made the comment that it was wierd that I was drinking our sweet tea without ice. Aroma is light caramel and british malts. No hop aroma at all, which is surprising for even an english IPA. Flavor is lots of british malts and some caramel in the background. Very little hop bitterness. I'm not sure I would classify this as an IPA... more like a bitter. Body is med-light, light carbonation, and a little watery."
"A lighter bodied IPA with above average carbonation to make up for it. But still drinkable and passable for the style. There is bitterness there and some malt, but also on the watery side. Bit of acidity there. Fine at the end of a summer day.Moderate aroma of hops."
"It's an interesting beer with a distinctively Scottish character that makes a great switch-up from your regular pint, and easily serves in all-aspects as a brilliant session ale. Very well done! An excellent Scottish ale!"
"D - It is a fairly good beer. It doesn't really taste like an IPA but is still good."
"Very easy to drink (much like water is). Some intersting flvours are present, but not much of an IPA. Not much of a PA either. Could drink alot in a sitting, and as such would make a good session beer. Cant see me having a serious drinking session with it though."
"First off, this is not a bad beer, but it is not what it claims to be (tastes and looks nothing like a traditional IPA). Dark amber color would be attractive if this was a red ale. Poor clarity, and average consistency. Smell is a little fruity, with hints of roasted malt. Taste, once again not ""IPA-like", more of a toasted malt. Finishes more like a porter. Feels stale and flat. This beer is drinkable but not satisfying."
"Pours a dark amber caramel color with a frothy one inch thick foam; a little too dark for style, not looking promising. Aroma is pretty flat, no hops detected, only earthy malts, sweet and caramel like. Flavor is a total dissapointment. The bitterness is there, but it's just so clean with no hop flavor at all. Super thin and nearly bodiless, wow, could it get any worse for style. Drinkability is awful, this is just not an enjoyable beer at all whatever you want to call it."
"A stretch for an IPA...even by English standards. Has a bold, medium maltiness that has good fruity / bready character in the nose, flavor, and body. Darker and richer in malts than expect, but it works well. Barely hopped for balance though. Almost misses even a pale ale mark with it's lack of hops. The hop character never offers much stand-alone character, and contributes only a slight earthy, woodsy flavor. Slightly over weighted in the body than I prefer and with a sweeter / maltier finish than expected. Good beer, but not a classic IPA."
"Notes: This must be a mistake!! Once again I have to wonder how a beer like this can be distributed so widely...ahhh but there are tons of beers that get broad distribution that suck....question answered. Walk past this if you are tight on funds, if you think I'm a nut give it a try."
"This is a drinkable beer, but not what I expected even from an English (Scottish) IPA. Given its characteristics and availability, I doubt Ill have this again."
"This is really a fine beer, although a bit 'off-center' of the style in most respects, it is very enjoyable. Being a hop-head, I could drink this all night."
"Again, this is not at all what I've come to expect from a beer of the style. Not at all complex, though pretty easy to drink. Not a bad beer, but nothing terribly memorable either. I'll pass on it in the future."
"I almost don't know how to score this. It doesn't look or taste like an IPA. The color is a deep, deep amber bordering brown. Some light lacing a pretty good head. Smell is very malty, lightly roasted dark malts with very little hop aromatics to speak of. I thought this ber tased alright. But not like an IPA, so I'm a little confused on how to score this beer. Flavor profile was about 80% malts and 20% English hops. Breday with hints of heather. This is a very sessionable beer, but I think they should label this beer differently."
"Ive been told that this is going to be discontinued soon, I wont miss it."
"Tried this one because I had heard good things about the McEwans brand - Really disappointed because I'm into hops and there aren't any here - Pours a decent color - malt is apparent from the beginning and stays there through the finish - Not a terribly bad beer - just difficult to objectively rate this one in the IPA category"
"I got a sixer from the distributor near me just to broaden my IPA knowledge. I was a little disappointed since this IPA doesn't really taste like an IPA (and because I'm a poor college student, the cost of $10.34 hurt). I can barely taste any hops yet it is a surprisingly dark red amber. It is a bit watery and thin for the style as well, but it is not without its character. Practically no lacing, but at least some head remains on the top till the end. Smell is so-so.. (certainly not bad) but it just smells malty. Tastes somewhat undercarbonated but mouthfeel is still fair. Probably the highest element of this beer is that it is very drinkable; it is an overall pleasant beer that doesn't fill you up as much even when compared to some other IPAs. It was NOT what I expected but it is still worth a shot."
"This beer pours a nice copper color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is very mild, I can detect some malt. I like the flavor, it's malty and has caramel/toffee like notes. Tastes absolutely nothing like an IPA, had this been labelled differently, I wouldn't be surprised, but this is not an IPA. If reviewed as to style, the marks would be low, but I've decided to rate it on its own merits, even though it is not an IPA. I think this is a fairly drinkable beer, it tastes fairly good. I don't think I'd search for this one, but I don't mind it one bit. Definitely worth a try as long as you don't care that it isn't to style."
"Overall. I've drank this a few times, but after i heard it was leaving the USA , i wanted to give it a try to rate it. Definetely the english accent on this style, but i dont think it is a good example. Just not that good of a beer. I'll miss seeing this on the shelves, but i wont miss it too much at all."
"Change the name and put it in the right style and it might rate higher, but as an IPA it doesnt cut it."
"Overall, this is a fairly drinkable beer. I'm not dying for another, but I'll drink this six-pack easily enough. It's not by any stretch of the imagination an IPA, but taken as what it is (whatever it is) it's decent. Might be a fairly readily-available intro beer for those who have only had very malty beers to date."
"Drinkability: I absolutely love a sweet, malty beer, so I'm probably not the best judge of the drinkability of this one, but I think I could take an entire session of it. (Score as a Scottish Ale: 3.5)"
"An IPA? Humm"
"-UF"
"I really cannot recommend this as an IPA. As a scottish it is pretty good. But no hops in the aroma or taste are not indicative of IPA. Try something else that is in style."
"poured a clear deep copper color with a bountious white head that fell to a thin ring. Much stickiness to the side of the glass. The smell is like a campfire, the morning after. Much smokiness, charcoal, strong malt notes, Very enjoyable. Taste is very different from the smell, with some malt notes, but a hop presence that increased with each sip. Initially I was dissapointed with the taste, but it really improved as more of the glass was consumed. Finishes dry with a strange aftertaste that is not overly pleasant (or unpleasant). Very unique. This was a very different beer. It went down very easy. but had a bit of a strange aftertaste, but still made me want to drink more."
"It goes down a bit too easy, as it is a little watered down. Could make a crossover beer."
"Compared to other English IPA's, this one doesn't quite match up."
"Pours with a dirty white head quickly settling overclear and very deep amber liquid. Nose is lightly sweet, toasty and nutty...unlike any IPA I've ever smelled before. The taste is very un-IPA like as well, starts a bit sweet and earthy, the hops should be the big player here but there's nary a hop to be found in this strange brew. But there is something here that makes it not unbearable to quaff, some sweet malt, some light treacle and smooth carbonation saves this from being too weird to drink. Just think of it as a nice light ale, not an IPA...'cause it ain't!"
"In a pinch it's not that bad, but if you really like IPA's, pass on this beer."
"Interestingly, I might consider this to be an above average Mild. But this clearly misses the moniker of IPA. Too bad since it wouldn't take much (more boiling hops and some dry hopping) to make this a full flavored offering. A good beer for the uninitiated."
"Pours a medium-brown color with a very fizzy and quickly disappearing head. It looks transparent and appears to be quite thin. The nose is sweet. Almost syrupy and malty sweet. It actually smells very good, just not quite what I had expected from an IPA. I'm maybe noticing some citrus scents in there as well. The taste is kind of flat. Definitly does not taste like an india pale ale at all. Reminds more of Newcastle or Tanner's Jack. Sweet roasted malts and nutty flavors. It does taste decent, just way off track. The mouthfeel is too light-bodied. It has that flat and watery feel to it. Drinkability?.. I can finish this one, but I doubt I'll be trying it again."
"My first impression of English India Pale Ales was from Yards Brewing Co and decided that it had to be my favorite style. If this is more typical of the style then I feel I must amend my profile because this is very lackluster."
"This beer pours a crystal clear amber with a white head that fizzles down to a thin layer. The aroma is definately not that of an IPA. Its smells malty and sweet, very little hop aroma. The taste is also not characteristically IPA-like. It tastes like a brown ale to me. Its very malty sweet with very little hops. Decent mouthfeel, light to medium body. Not a bad beer but I probably will not buy any more of this."
"Only problem is it is not distributed in my area any longer."
"Thin body but it goes down very smooth. This beer is a let down."
"Drinkability- This ain't no IPA in my book. I don't know if I have had an English IPA before, but if this it what they taste like, I'm staying away. Where are the hops? I was expecting something different, but I was expecting a different flavor of hops or something. Very confused."
"Much blander in taste and subtle in the hops than I would've expected, but not a bad brew. Need to re-review as this one is based on a a smaple tried 4 days before."
"This brew is a beautiful bronze color with a thick, strong head. Its a very nice looking beer! The aroma is a subtle mix of hops and malt. The balance is shifted in favor of the hops, but theyre restrained and theres a very distinct bready sweetness as well. Also an ale-like fruitiness and a hint of butterscotch. Its not an intense aroma, and certainly nothing like an American IPA. Moderate sweetness and roasted malt flavors up front. The beer dries out in the mid-taste, and finishes with a flourish of bitterness. Its a polite, very well-balanced beer. Quite drinkable, but not particularly remarkable."
"Not horrible, by any stretch of the imagination, although it is horribly boring."
"Where's the hops? Defintiely not an American IPA. the appearance was my favorite part. It was a deep brown, with a thick, creamy head. The aroma was of apple juice, which is not a good thing because I hate apple juice. The taste was simple malty, carmelly and creamy. There were no hop tones providing balance. I do not think my taste buds are still shot since EBF '05. the mouthfeel was very heavy. Definitely a witner beer, not sure I would like this in the summer if I was looking for crisp, refreching and flavorful."
"This is an ok beer, though much better than other canned beers. Its got a strong diacetyl flavor that takes away from the hops and malt flavors. The hops are definitely inadequate for an IPA. Still, fans of English Ales should give this beer a try."
"-Cheers"
"If you like English, pub-style ales, then give it a try if you must...but if you're looking for any kind of an IPA, then don't waste your time because you won't find it here."
"This is certainly better than the nasty bottle version I sampled months ago. Not something I'd search for, though."
"Loose cream of head filters down to a gentle mist. Extremely clear, mahogany hue with no action at all; still, all things considered, a very nice overall presentation. Good malt character up front on the nose and almost a fruity, blueberry note follow up. Malt is first, bittering hop is second, in that order, and it is like having two different pints; no complexity, just bluntly hits you over the head with its two-pronged attack; some finishing clover and light smoke character is detected. Doable, but nothing special"
"Gonna have to send this down the ol' drain...so bad it hurts!"
"Pours very dark for an IPA, a dark copper hue with a small, creamy white head. Not bad-looking, just out of character. Earthy, roasty aroma of malt, without any sign of hops and a faint sourness. This, however, doesn't prepare for the taste. Completely lacking in the typical sharp hoppiness of an IPA, this resembles more of a red ale. Mellow malt flavor is tempered by a light fruity character from the hops. Mouthfeel is agreeable, nice and creamy. While this is absolutely not what I expect in an IPA, it's an OK beer."
"This was not a good IPA by any stretch of the imagination. This poured a decent copper collor with a small head that faded quickly. The smell was non existant other than some trace elements of malt. The flavor was more like a amber ale than a Pale Ale or IPA. It had next to no hop presence and not much maltiness to it either, it was just kind of flat. I will be passing on this one in the future."
"First time I had this beer was on-tap at Macnivens in Indy at a BA gathering and I must say that bottled, this is certainly a different beast. Pours an interesting copper color but with very little head to speak of. Nose has a lot more bready malts than I would like in an IPA. It almost seems like an English Pale instead of an English IPA. Very mild flavor, a nice malt base gives way to a finish that is only slightly hoppy at best. I'm really struggling to pick out any hop characteristics other than a slight vague bitterness. I remember this being much better from the tap."
"Light raisony taste, pretty bland but tastes more like wine than beer to me. I wouldn't recommend this one."
"This is drinkable in that it tastes like a bland, inoffensive pale ale. If you are looking for anything more than that -and, hopefully, you are - there's no reason to buy this."
"Tasted much like it smelled. A good scottish ale with only faint hints of hops to leave the drinker wondering what might have been. However, it did taste pretty good. Minimal carbonation made it easy to drink and it has a nice clean finish."
"The beer pours a nice dark golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good, but a little off-style. It has a very malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It is sweet with a fruity finish. The taste is decent. It has a dry, yet slightly bitter flavor that is quite malty with a bisquity finish. This is low is hops and really not that bitter. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent IPA. It really doesn't fit the style, but it drinks well."
"A drinkable brew, but not an IPA in my book."
"A light amber color clear liquid with virtually no head. The head that was present was white and wispy. There was a small amount of lace on the glass throughout. Smells slightly toasty, fruity and flowery. Begins with a sweet malt note followed by a dry, sharp flowery hop flavor with minimal bitterness. Not what I would want or expect from an IPA. Not even enough for a Pale Ale. Too much carbonation, as bubbles were racing from the bottom of the glass throughout. Overall, a disappointment. Certainly not labeled correctly. It is easy to drink, because there is not much flavor going on."
"500 mL can, clearly marked best before date stamped on the bottom."
"For a long while now, I have had fond memories of this beer. I have not had the beer for a few years but was recently, dissapointed not once but twice. The first was a six-pack of 12 ounce bottles that I purchased. The flavor was off and there was not much happening in the bottle. I figured that maybe the beer was old, since it does carry a steep price tag. The second dissapointment came when I had the beer on tap at an Old Chicago Restaurant. The beer poured a decent reddish color with little carbonation. The taste was, well there wasn't much. There were no real flavors that one would attribute to an IPA. In general a poor brew."
"Pours a copper color with a thin light tan head. Buttery, bready malt aroma with just the tracest hop aroma detected. Rather light in the mouthfeel, but very much drinkable. A welcomed change of pace from American IPAs, just to mix it up every once in a while. Now if we could only get Samuel Smith's IPA on tap..."
"If its not Scottish: Its CRAP! Recommended."
"No one--at least no one who reads this review--should buy McEwan's India Pale Ale expecting to drink an actual India Pale Ale. It's an okay beer in a general sense, but it won't cross my lips again. I know that the originators of the style (if I can lump the Scottish in with the English in this case) can do much, much better than this."
"Spend your money on something else - as will I."
"The flavor is great though, and is a nice addition to the style."
"Sampled 2/6/04"
"was fairly disappointed here. this one sorta strays from the ipa style, and not in a good way. it doens't end up being a bad brew, but it's average (at best) all around. pours a root beer looking brown colour wit ha tiny head that is gone in seconds. this one quite bubbly, and almost looked like a cross between a beer and a soda. the smell is fairly plain, malty and caramel with a slight note of hops. in the flavour, the hops are all but gone. there's even less presence of them than in the smell. the taste is almost all malt and earth, with some of the afformentioned caramel flavour as well. mouthfeel is a bit watery but not bad overall. this one needs to jack up the hops or rename itself, as, again, it's not a true ipa. it's unique for the style and thirst quenching indeed, but nothing worth fussing over finding. there are far, far superior ipa's out there that are easy to be had. i'd hit those up before this one."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This is on the lighter side of medium bodied. Some very mild hoppiness lingers on the tongue after swallowing. Drinkable, but somewhat dull and uninteresting."
"Poured a decent enough amber to copper color.Slight lacing on the edges.Somewhat bready aroma.Malty.Flavor of malt.Residual sweetness.Not like an American IPA.No great rush of hops.Decent mouthfeel.Lingering maltiness to it.A decent enough beer I guess.I find the labeling a bit misleading.I realize its a Scottish version but for the un-initiated it can be a let down.Known as ""export"" in Scotland its a lot more along the lines of an 80 shilling.Save this one for when you get to Scotland and have it on draft."
"I'll have something else for my next pint."
"disappointing is how I would characterize this ""IPA"" Flavor is thin,body is ehh, mostly malt, minimal hop flavor....abit cabbagy and a hint of nut flavor, but THAT IS IT. This style was created to survive the trip to India, but I dont think this brew survived the trip from scotland to my home town, expensive water, would avoid this one."
"Drinkability is decent but beer is relatively flavorless so gets some marks off."
"Yes, I consider this ale as the standard Scottish ale. Others may be more interesting, but this is they are to be measured by."
"Pours a deep copper brilliantly clear color and is topped by a tan head. It has a grainy sweet aroma and is severely lacking in the hop aroma department. It is like a fuller version of John Courage amber (see my previous review, or don't b/c it is not worth it), which is really not a compliment. There are some caramel notes and perhaps it is a bit bitter in the finish. There is some subtle off putting flavor in the finish; it is a bit phenolic, or like plastic, I can't quite place it. If your only having one make sure it is not this one. Not a bad beer, it is just generally lacking in character."
"A decent tasting brew in my opinion, but those who purchase it on a whim will be severly disappointed with the lack of hops and the focus on malts. Although decent, this can be deemed as forgettable as well."
"Pours a brown amber with a quick fading off-white head. This does not taste like an IPA at all! Where are the hops???? Caramel sweetsweetsweet and malty with some weird fruit type flavor. Mouthfeel is thin. I'm certainly never going to have another of these again. Another case of wishing I checked BA before bringing home a bottle."
"This beer pours a crystal clear dark amber color, with some foamy head and little to no lace. The head quickly receded to a thin collar. The appearance was probalby the best attribute to this beer. The smell, although not entirely unpleasant, was odd to say the least. It smelled overly of raw grains, and had a very metallic buttery malt smell. The taste was sharp, and a bit watery, becoming more so as the glass went along. Flavored ranged from raw grains, to the smallest hint of hops in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was basically that of lightly carbonated water. But hey, when you get a 24 case of these for free, who can argue?"
"There's something off kilter (pardon the pun) about ths IPA. First, it does not taste like any IPA I've ever had; usually there is some significant hint of hops in the IPA--but none here. There's a medium brown hue to this ale, and the aroma is raw metallic grains with an undertone of caramel. The taste is startlingly sharp and lacking in hops. I had to force myself to find the hops. The mouthfeel is thin. Not an ale to drink more than a few sips. Sorry."
"Basically, I had this beer since it was on the 'kill list', beers to get rid of in order to put the Rochefort, Cantillon, etc., into the fridge. As a bit of a joke, I was given the snifter glass so I could pretend it was a bit better than it was. Well, sadly,it did not work. This was just not a good beer. About the only way I'd have it again is to make way for those fine, delicious beers I'll be salivating over."
"Not a British IPA, certainly not an American style one either. Is this a typical (only?) Scottish one? Not every good."
"Aside from the color, this has NO characteristics of anything resembling an IPA. A deep coppery color with a faint lace on top is about the only thing making this an IPA. This isn't a bad beer, but it smells and tastes like a malty Scotch ale. Aroma is insanely malty and buttery. Flavor follow suit...buttery malt flavor reminds me of many a scotch ale I've had before. There's no hops to be found in this beer. Not a bad tasting beer, but does nothing to fit the style at all. No hops, no bitterness, not much on alcohol. The case was $9, hence the purchase. One I most likely will not return to."
"This beer poured a hazelnut color that was crystal clear and well carbonated. It produced an off white colored head that after a vigorous pour seemed to last only a moment in time. It started off thick and creamy then fell to a ring on the edges. There was some lace present and the consistency was creamy as well. The aromas that were produced were of sweet dark malts, caramel, some light fruit, and bread, the aroma was kind of on the sweet side at times. The flavors started off with hints of fruits, and sweet malts, then some hops, roasted malts and caramel became noticeable, it ended with a dry barky finish. The after taste had hints of roasty-ness and some real faint hops to dry it out. The mouth feel was kind of watery. It went down somewhat smooth and easy. To me it seemed to be a good session beer. Not the best IPA I have ever had and not the worst either. Right down the middle."
"It's clear amber with a foamy off-white head that leaves big globs of bubbles floating about on top. Surprisingly for an IPA, hops are barely detectable. It has a toffee/butterscotch smell that's not altogether offensive but not what was expected. The taste also is less than stellar. Again, it's not completely off-putting but it just doesn't taste right for an IPA. The mouthfeel is decidedly on the thin side. Despite all these shortcomings, it does go down well and would make a decent session beer if nothing better was around. I kept thinking second-rate London Pride."
"Drinkability: Not really a bad ale... there's simply NOTHING about it that's appropriate to the IPA style. If you're a hop-head, save your time and money."
"This is a slightly above average IPA from McEwans. As far as British IPAs go this is pretty good, but not great. This is a near-brown beer with a nice white head of steam. The aromas are quite one-dimensional and consist only of malts and some background hops. Sadly, the taste is similar with not much going on besides the malts and the hops. The mouthfeel is a bit light and the drinkability is pretty good."
"On the whole, this wasnt a terrible beer. In fact, it went down well with some of the spicy chicken and nachos I had while watching my Chargers get their asses handed to them by the Dolphins. But as a beer styled as an IPA, I thought MacEwans IPA came up lacking."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a dark reddish-brown color with one finger of head. There is minimal lacing left on the glass. The smell is mostly malty, very light. Just a touch of hops in there as well. The taste has a nutty malt flavor with only a little bit of hops coming through. It's a little light on flavor. The mouthfeel is a little light and oily. The drinkability is pretty fair. An average IPA at best."
"Medium gold color. Small head. Aroma is mildly malty. A very non-hoppy, very light bodied IPA. Kind of bland. The malts are mild, and the hops are nearly none existent. Very Bland. Not a US macro Swill but close. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"Have this on tap at the local Irish pub Seamus McCaffery's. Appearance was coppery brown with little to no head and lacing. Smells detected were of the malts used, nothing overpowering or memorable. The taste I take away are the bitter hops used to make this brew. Mouthfeel is somewhat smooth for an IPA. Drinkability is slightly better than average, several pints goes well with a sandwich before a baseball game. One has to not expect or compare American IPA's to this, the style and ingriedients are definitely different!"
"Pours a lighter brown color with a light somehwat fizzy head,the aroma is on the malty side for a IPA with some fruitiness lingering.There is some hop presence in the taste but not like a IPA normally is,there is a metallic inge in the finish.Not a horrible beer but there are many coming from the UK for sure."
"a pocked light beige head dies but never extinguishes leaving next to no lace. deep copper color. scent is fruity of grapes, plumbs and slightly bready like a muffin. the taste is a great deep malt that seems bubbly, bitter in it self but harmonious with a substansial amount of sweetness before the the hop development which is bitter and fruity with lemon, lime and then an herbal afterglow. somwhere in here also, is a sweet orange liqueur. it invites the next sip with a buttery sweetness left on the palate rather than (my) expectation of crisp and bitter, it was interesting but i liked it much. seemed upside down to me. mouthfeel is a bit thick and it burps sugary and plesantly. overall pretty nice but a bit heavy to be all that drinkable."
"Not great. Not complicated, but rather appealing in its simplicity. Not for everyone though, I can see plenty of reasons others may hate this beer."
"Light brown with a thin fizzy head that left in seconds. Aroma is of dark malt with a strange estery character. Taste is like a malty english ale with a hoppiness that is only present in the finish and only as a biterness. This is unpleasent as there is no aroma or flavor hops to be detected. Tha mouthfeel is a little thin and the saltiness of the water seems to come up short. Overall this is not much of an IPA and i would be very reluctant to purchase one of these again."
"This was actually hard to finish it was rather thin, and bland up to a odd sour finish. Not Good."
"This is quite a different IPA than I'm accustomed to drinking - and IPA's are my favorite product. There are obviously hops present in the brew but nowhere near as obvious as in many of the American IPA's. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very mild and more of a crossover product - something I never thought I would say about an IPA. Nice body and taste without a lot of bitterness. I haven't noticed this product before in New England so guess it may be a fairly new import. Very fresh as indicated by a freshness date on the label. I'm pleased to have gotten a 6-pack in Mass."
"This beer poured a dark amber color with a moderate head and minimal lacing on the glass. The aroma was somewhat sweet, but nothing too wonderful to mention. The flavor was very sweet and, although not much of an IPA, it was very very good. I really enjoyed this beer and will have it again very soon."
"Overall an easy drinking ale that I would call a Brown Ale before I called it an IPA. I had this a few years back in a bottle and remember it being pretty poor. The tap version was much better. Still not a great ale due to the fact that it is so bland. This would be a good transition beer for macro drinkers. Nothing overly offensive about this beer; it's just bland."
"Clear amber body with little to nothing for a head. Very little aroma but smelled a little sweet. Nothing like any IPA I've ever had and no sign of hop aroma or bitterness one expects with this style. Very dissapointed, thin and watery with not much flavor. There won't be a next time for this brew."
"Wow, did I get a bad pour, or was the keg tapped long ago? The color is a light amber, with a very low head. There is no hop flavor that I can detect at all, and this from an IPA. Very slight malt flavor. There is no aroma, and the mouthfeel is very watery. I may have to try this again sometime to be sure, but this was not an enjoyable pint."
"The smell is caramel, bananas and milk. I'm a bit disappointed. The front is caramel, the middle a little thin. The finish is dry, with more bananas and lots of hops. Nice. There's a nice bitter aftertaste, with some butterscotch at warmer temps. Overall, I like this quite a bit. It's nicely aggressive."
"This beer is quite strange. Not that it isn't a descent enough beer, but I would have never picked this out as an IPA if tasted blindly. It tastes like a mild brown or a Scottish ale. Overall it is OK, but if held to the style guidelines, totally weak."
"This beer poured a deep golden to amber with a average head. The aroma was more malt than hops. The flavor was sour and not hoppy. The best I can say is that it tasted like old wet rags smell. It was almost a malt flavor but was countered by something not quite right. The mouthfeel was light. I was not expecting an American IPA so was not disappointed by its light hoppiness. The sour that infected the beer was a real problem. I will probably check this beer out again to see if it was a problem with this keg."
"Total score: 29 out of 50"
"This is a bad ass IPA. Hands down, this is my favorite of the style so far. It is not the hammer strong hops that have become the trademark of the style as we see in the U.S. today. Instead this is a product where ability meets necessity. The additional hops that preserve the beer and the balance of flavors that is normally out of balance. The color is brownish slightly cloudy amber and the head is thick and creamy settling to a fine lace. The flavor is perfect IPA. Malt and strong hops perfectly balanced with a nutty undertone that finishes out perfect. Now this is not a kick you in the balls hoppiness - it is just strong hops that leaves a nice and pleasant after taste. The malt is a complex blend with fruity undertones that finish dry. I just love this beer."
"Cheerio!"
"Not my idea of an IPA..Think I will introduce it to my sink!"
"Crystal-clear amber brown color with lively carbonation, an off-white head and quite good broken lace. Sweet aroma of cookies, caramel, and fruit, with little or no hops. Taste begins with toasty malt and caramel flavors; towards the finish some mild citrus bitterness appears. Finish is clean and dry. A tasty and drinkable beer, but seems more like an brown ale than an IPA."
"Darkish coppery-bronze, fair clarity, poor head development thus no retention, some spotty lace. Almost nose-less, faint hints of malt clean. Caramel/malt upfront, barren in the middle, meandering bitterness intertwined, hints of sweetness boring and empty finish. Lacks depth, no complexity medium bodied but somehow still unfulfilling. I struggle to call this an IPA... where are the hops? No need to drink this again, not recommended."
"Nice red-brownish in color, small white head that doesn't last, light flowery and malty aroma, mild sweet caramel flavors with a light hop presence. Watery and thin mouthfeel, decent crisp light finish, a weak even for an English IPA where are the hops? Very bland, taste kind of like a wet paper bag.I won't waste my money on this one."
"We have all been duped, there's no way in hell this is an IPA. McEwan's IPA has virtually no hop aroma. This is false advertisement, it pours a wierd dim shade of amber brown almost a mohogany. The head poured very thin and was a tinted cream tone, and the lace slides right down the glass as it empties. I am getting all sweetness from a caramel malt origin. Is very easy drinking doesn't take too many brain cells to pick this one apart. I was expecting a lot more from it than I got, and I find myself disappointed. There is also a hidden fruity flavor in there, but overall a watered down lighter body for an IPA. I am not crazy by any means, in fact I can't even say I like this one. Definitely would not recommend this one to anybody."
"Cheers"
"This is a nice beer to drink when your sitting around with your buds. Sure, it's not as good as the Scotch Ale by McEwans, but it has it's highlights. First off, it's not a too heavy beer. Tastes like a very light coffee. It's got just the right amount of bitterness to it, but that's not too much. The taste finishes off smooth and goes down easy. Give it a shot, you'll be glad you did."
"Drinkability & Notes: Quite drinkable, it actually goes down real easy like a light ale would. Sad thing is this is not labeled as a light ale, labeled as an IPA makes this beer somewhat of a sham. I have had pale ales that are bigger than this! At $9 a six-pack don’t waste your dough."
"I'm sorry but this is not an IPA as they claim on the bottle.....Maybe an English Mild or sweeter ESB but not an IPA...The aroma is malty with no hops evident...the taste is biscuity and bready...no hop's evident except for a dryish finish...It's not a bad beer, but for an IPA it's way below average..."
"The beer pours crystal clear deep amber to burnished copper color, the head minimal, the lace in spindly sheets, and they both disappear much to quickly for my liking. Nose is all malt, light hints of caramel, clean and fresh at any rate. Front is sweet and malt laden the top skinny, the finish has a big acidic bite, the hops are light, and under stated as are most non-American IPAs. Please dont misunderstand, as this is not meant to be a criticism, as I like the complex flavors and bodies in these IPAs and ales for that matter. Overall, this beer is a bit bland and watery, at least for me."
"Deep clear copper color.  Very little head.  Just a collaring.  More malt than hops on the nose.  The malt flavors are caramel and biscuit like.  The hop profile is primarily perfumey, but also slightly herbal.  Bitterness factor is very low, which drops my taste rating significantly.  There's a dry woody aspect that I usually don't encounter in IPAs.  This is a good tasting beer, but it doesn't seem like an IPA to me.  More like a PA or Bitter."
"Pours a clear light brown with a little amber and a modest white head that dissipates fairly quickly, yet leaves a lace down the glass.  The smell is not nearly as pronounced as other IPA's that I've had, nor did the look go with it either.  The smell is that of a musty bitter with not much else.  Tasting this, I know this is not an IPA at all.  It doesn't taste bad, but doesn't fit the label.  Very mild and kind of bland (maybe because I was expecting an IPA), slightly malty taste with a hint of roast and a moderate hoppy bitterness.  It has an almost watery mouthfeel and finishes semi-dry.  Like I say, not bad, but NOT an IPA.  Average across the board...if you take the IPA off of it.  Cheers!"
"McEwan's shouldn't really be labeled an IPA, but more of an English mild. It pours a pretty deep amber with a short-lived head that at least looks good when it's there. The smell is rather biscuity, with almost no hop profile present. The taste features more of that biscuity profile with some caramel malt making itself known, as well. This a pretty smooth drinker, and would make a decent session beer. It's not really worth overanalyzing, but it's a keeper in its own regard."
"certainly not an IPA....dark copper in color with a minmal head and no lacing.  light toasted malt aroma, a hint of hops.  smooth and creamy moutfeel, albeit a little thin.  nice bready caramel malt taste...very drinkable.  nothing special and could be considered and average to slightly above average ale.  to pass it off as an IPA is wrong though.  would be a nice session brew as there isn't too much to offend."
"IMO this is far from an IPA, where are the hops??  About the only way it resembles an IPA is the appearance.  I was very dissapointed in this beer and recommend it to Bud drinkers becasue it is that bad...........CHEERS"
"Amber in color, with an off-dry malty nose, this beer has a short, dry malt aftertaste with some sweetness at the end. Not very typical for your average IPA."
"Buttery, oily, caramelly, malty and sweet, not bitter, just sweet, therefore it doesn't really resemble an IPA, and doesn't appeal with my tatses, needs bitterness."
"Dark and clear amber.  Very little smell.  Head is thin and dissappears into large bubbles at the edge. Mouthfeel is pretty dense for an I.P.A., hops are assertive but not at all explosive -- mildly peppery/clovey.  Malt taste is definitely there and helps add to the body and impression.  Pretty good but very different from an American I.P.A.... I, personally, like a little more hops."
"The first time I drank this I was shocked - I expected a hoppy - rip your face off - IPA.  It isn't anything like that - smooth, mellow and is the best IPA I have found anywhere.  The ABV is 4.5%."
"This beer was formerly known as McEwan's Export Ale. Only the name has been changed to protect the ignorant."
"Notes: An unusual IPA. First, it's Scottish. Second, it taste nothing like a traditional IPA and holds none of the characteristics that you might expect (big malts and big hops to balance). I'll pass on this one. Not to style and a rather bland brew."
