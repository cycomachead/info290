"Overall this one is exceptionally good and very enjoyable.  I highly recommend it."
""
"So yeah, it isn't that hop-forward compared to most American IPAs. It also has the same distinct wang as the Chocolate and Oatmeal stouts (which is not a bad thing - I find Unibroue to have the same theme). However, this is a solid beer. Not a great one, but certainly not a bad one. Would I buy again? Probably not - I like my IPAs like I like my sports - AMERICAN"

"Well balanced, slightly bitter finish, nice body for an IPA"

"Not really my style.  Far more malty that expected, not much in the way of hops."
""

"This was a very enjoyable beer to drink! Citrus flavor with just small amount of hops. I believe a person who doesn't like hops would enjoy this beer. This would be great for a nice summer day, nice crisp and clean easy to drink beer."

"Fruity hop aroma. Mild brown body.An off white head. Smooth clear taste. Mild sweetness. Hint of of a citrus-like tang in the background. A little plain but very drinkable.Faint sour after taste."
""
""
"Overall – A more dank but rather easy drinking IPA.  A little to thin and dank for me, but a easy drinker non the less and a rather fun one to try."

"As an encore to their Oatmeal Stout in the variety pack, I went with this English style IPA next. Poured in to their signature Samuel Smith pint glass, the beer puts forth a rising head of spongy off white foam. 3 fingers of froth rests atop a tangerine-orange brew of notable clarity. Tons of lacing hangs around as the foam dissipates. Beautiful appearance. The aroma gives off biscuit malts and only traces of hops. Certainly not nearly as aromatic as its American brethren. Despite the lack of a pronounced hop bouquet, it is still hop-forward in the flavor department. But of the tame citrus variety, with minimal bitterness. They definitely put a leash on it. A touch of toffee and some metallic accents that zing your tongue.There's some orange sweetness, light pine, and fruity esters to round out the flavors. The pleasant and slightly dry aftertaste conjures thoughts of herbal tea, and there's a good mix of malt and hops. The beer is effervescent with a juicy feel. A pretty solid body given its relative lack of weight. Overall, I think we Americans have been spoiled with mega-IPA's that obliterate your senses. This is a refreshing and easy alternative with a historic pedigree and distinguished character. Hopheads may find this leaving them a little wanting, but if you can appreciate it for what it is, it's great. Balanced, refined. A true classic."

"Poured with a large bubbly creamy head, not much aroma. Light malt flavour with moderate carbonation and a nice clean dry slightly bitter finish. Found this unexeptional, but overall well balanced flavours and quite an enjoyable pint."
""
"This is more my range for an everyday IPA"
"O: This is really good beer and I think it deserves a better score. I think the challenge for us American IPA drinkers is that we drink hopped up versions and we drink an English IPA and think something is missing, at least, that is my own experience. But if I am ever looking for an IPA that is not hoppy, I'll reach for this, it's good, balanced, and has quality."
""
""
"Today I bought the Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout (94), and the India Ale (83), and I feel like the scores of those on this site should be reversed. I think this IPA is fantastic. It isn't like most IPAs that get high reviews here, but it is none the less extremely good. The taste of this IPA reminds me of honey in a very good way, and it is so drinkable."
""
"O – A very good example of the traditional style of IPA, before it was co-opted as a bitter assault on the tongue.  Very flavorful and malty while providing balancing bitterness. Very good."
"Aroma toasted malt, caramel, floral notes.  Taste sweet toffee, caramel malt, honey, grassy, faint grapefruit, slight bitter finish. Nice ESB!"
""
""
""
""
"Solid beer from a good brewery"
"O - I really love the nose and the front of this beer, with the bright floral hops and honey flavors.  The close is less satisfying.  I can deal with the bitterness, but the medicinal aspects come out most strongly at the end.  The rating would be north of 4 but for this aspect of the finish."
"Enjoyed from the bottle in a pint glass, this English IPA pours a beautiful copper color with a nice white head that dies down to a nice pool of foam with light lacing.  Nose of light caramel, light herbal and bittering hops, and light bread.  Flavors are a medium caramel malts backbone with a light bready flavor that gives way to the bittering hops in the background.  High carbonation, almost seltzer water like, gives it a crisp mouth feel that finishes bracingly bitter without being over the top.  A solid example of a good British IPA."
"O: A little mineral-heavy. A pretty decent English IPA though. Unfortunately there is almost zero demand for the style here in the states."
""
""
"Quaint, seems mild and unhoppy compared to US IPAD"
""
""
"O. A nice change of pace.  Probably reminiscent of india ales back in the day before the larger variety of hops available now."
""
""
"It's a refreshing beer but not what I like in IPAs. Tastes more like a crisp pale ale to me. As far as an English Style IPAs though, it's a good one."
""
""
"So...up yours (literally!) - as in drink up : o)"
"Sour & lacking depth, but feels like you're drinking history. Thin -- especially if you've been drinking a lot of American big hops -- but still good. Somehow more than the sum of its parts."

"I'd willingly have another, and that's good for me."
"550ml. Pours a slightly opaque, pale amber, orange colour with an effervescent white head which quickly dissipated leaving a trace of lace. Gentle caramel malt aroma with some citrus. Underlying light sweetness, tangy bitterness in the middle with a very long, mildly bitter finish. Quite dry, creamy texture, medium to full body. Not a beer I would rave about but decent enough in its own way."

"Overall - A classic that bares almost no similarities to the modern IPA being made today, even amongst those in Europe. This is a good beer, but anyone expecting a hop bomb will be severely disappointed. Drinks closer to a really tame pale by today's standards."
"Light taste. Floral hops. Mild fruit. Light mouth at first but a pretty nice bitterness after taste."
""

"Overall- a solid English pale ale, there's nothing mind blowing here, but it's just a really solid beer. Good representation of the style, but there are others available that may be better."

"This beer has wonderful balance and a rich flavor of hops and malts. On the nose I get fresh notes of malt and wheat with smaller hints of citrus and caramel. I also get a fresh hint of hops on the palate. If you are huge into hops and want a lot in your beer, this one may not be for you. However, I will say that this is one of the better IPAs I have had. Absolutely great!"

"Large 550ml bottle poured in an official Samuel Smith pint glass.  Huge, foamy head.  Golden colored ale.  Tasted rather bland, smooth at first taste.  Spicy, citrus notes.  Aftertaste, though, is a deal-breaker.  Leaves a metallic, mineral-like, alcoholic tinge that lingers.  Definitely not my favorite IPA."
""
"Nice showing of a English IPA that had a great pour from the bottle into a Pint glass, wonderful bronze color with a off white head..fair lace and malty aroma. Malt flavor is upfront with tingly hops in the background, light to medium mouthfeel is refreshing and makes for a tasty drinking beer."

"First English IPA I've tried. Not as hoppy as the American style, but very well balanced. Poured pale orange with 2 fingers of white head and great lacing. Aroma was malty with spicy hops. Flavor was solid and balanced, but i was blown away by the mouthfeel.Very good, drinkable beer. I hope i can find it again."
"Overall very pleasing beer."

"Poured a gorgeous semi-clear golden orange with one finger of fluffy white head that grew to two fingers and receded slowly leaving lacing down the glass. A true beauty of a beer, one of the best looking IPAs I have ever seen. Scents of abundant floral and herbal hops with notes of jasmine and lavender. An earthy hop presence is also discernible alongside hints of honey and crystal malt. Very faint traces of fruit. An excellent aroma profile that is rich, floral, earthy and pleasant. Excellently done. Flavor begins with a nice hit of floral and herbal hops, with a slightly medicinal flavor to them and faint honey-like notes and toasted malt in the background. The level of bitterness is lower than in American IPAs but pleasant and true to style. These flavors continue throughout the sip and are joined in the middle by a nice earthy, hoppy character and moderate-high bitterness. Finish is dry with notes of floral, herbal and earthy hops and a faint hint of honey. Aftertaste is dry with floral, herbal and earthy notes, toasted malt and the tiniest hint of honey. An excellent, complex, hoppy, yet not overbearing flavor profile that is true to style and quite pleasant on the palette. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with moderate carbonation and a slightly dry character. Wonderfully done, pleasant to drink and very true to style. Overall this is an excellent English IPA that captures the aroma, flavor, mouthfeel and spirit of the style perfectly. Well worth having."

"At first sweet crystal malts present themselves. Followed by a tangy citrus hop character. Sweet citrus hoppy aroma. Very easy drinking and like many British beers it is perfectly carbonated. Tart tangy finish touch of diacetyl. I highly recommend this and thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Poor aroma, smells mildly of apricot, sweet rolls, but also of standing water. Nice deep orange pour, lots of lacing. Tastes very fresh and crisp, as most Samuel Smith’s beers do. Pleasant bitter, mouthwatering finish, a bit of a sour aftertaste. A nice drinking beer."
""
""
"Pours a nice reddish amber with a decent head that quickly dissipates. Has a nice light floral scent. Nice floral hoppy flavor that is light and refreshing. Slight bitterness at the finish. A decent beer that you can have a couple of with no problem."
"Overall- I enjoyed this more than a lot of American IPAs that I've tried. Not bad but not real memorable either. Too bad I really enjoy many of Samuel Smith's other offerings."

"Lightly weathered copper orange in color with a light chill haze. Poured with a short, dense, bright white foam that settled to a thick cap and left thick sheets of sticky lacing on the glass. Caramel and toasted malt aromas with toffee and light floras and herbal hop notes. Smooth, light oily feel with slightly subdued, tangy carbonation overtop and a lightly dry finish. Caramel and toasted malt flavors with toffee notes. Floral and herbal hop flavors emerge through the middle to the end. Finishes dryly with a bready malt and herbal hop aftertaste."

"Very nice beer has a great mouthfeel and aroma. I first notice a citrus with some grassy notes. Taste is smooth hoppy citrus with a clean finish goes great with seafood. Pour is a brownish color very little head. If cold from fridge pour in room temp glass to let beer develop taste and smell."
"Overall: Outstanding, world class ale from one of the best breweries on the planet.. Great job Samuel Smith!"
""

"O: This is a mildly bitter beer with nothing to balance it out. No sweetness or hops to give any other character. I like Samuel Smith's as a brewery - but this is not their best offering."
"It was also nice that it was on sale for $3.33 for their bomber."
"Not sure if it's too bland or very traditional, for me it feels like one of the original IPAs, an extra-hopped British ale to survive the long trip to India, thus a bit.. ""clumsy""."

"Purchased from PW Mart in Poway. Pours orangey/light amber with a decent white head and good lacing. Smells fruity with some malty backbone. Nice taste, hoppy(not American West Coast hoppy), fruity and more malts then I'm used to in an India Ale. Very smooth, pleasent on the palate. Havent had a bad beer by Samuel Smith yet, this one is very nice, really liking the different flavors found in this brew, nothing like the typical IPA's in these parts, a nice change."

"Overall: Pretty solid EIPA. I dig it. Another good installment from the Samuel Smith brewery."

"Poured from the bottle into an English pub glass. Notably light in color, a gold yellow with a formidable dull white head that holds its shape. Aroma is floral and fruity, reminiscent of black tea, dried apricots, perhaps some unlit tobacco, faint citrus rind. Some classic English hop aroma but overall the smell is restrained. Palate features a similarly downplayed malt backbone that manifests as caramel and popcorn with the odd toasty protuberance, a hint of treacle, a fruity floral bubble gum element (or perhaps grape popsicle?), and the black tea/dried fruit notes from the nose. Gentle on the mouth despite the aggressive head and carbonation, smooth and featuring the unusual Samuel Smith diacetyl caress that works so well in their brews. Body on the thin side. Finishes semi-dry, including a lingering sweetness as well as a mineral bite. Some forest floor type hop effects. Overall, my impression is favorable. Some unique hop and yeast-derived flavors which grew on me as I made my way through an initially mellow and murky pint in which I struggled to pinpoint the specific flavors."

"O- Not what you would expect an IPA to be. This is not to say that it is not good, because it is. It just isn't what you would get with a traditional APA or IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a session ale if I have ever had one... It reminds me so much of the other British pub ales I have had and that is not a bad thing, but if you are expecting an American IPA look elsewhere."

"O: This is a hard beer to rate. Having consumed numerous American IPAs, this is distinctly different. I think overtime it could win me over for the sheer fact that the English invented IPA so they could ship beer to India without spoilage. The hop flavors are not as pronounced as an AIPA, yet the bitterness is much more distinct. The flavor is nice, but does not stand out. Though, I would like to try this again paired against some spicy Indian or Thai fare to see how it holds up; with the bitterness, I suspect it will perform quite well. Will definitely try this again."
"o: A different sort of English IPA, with more hop flavors and bitterness than I expected, otherwise rather light in color if not mouthfeel for an English IPA. Still in all a different and tasty brew, a credit to the venerable Samuel Smith lineup. Stands up well against the average hoppy American IPA."

"Solid copper color. The hops and malt are subtle but readily apparent in the smell. The taste is all English - I don't know if it is as typically strong as other English IPAs, but it is thoroughly pleasant. The mouthfeel is extraordinary - no heavy bitter aftertaste. The well-integrated hops are present as you savor, not afterward. The malt and a little balanced sweetness are what stays with you. This gets solid points for being an extremely drinkable beer - not epically brilliant, but really fantastic for a session. I will get this again without question."

"a bright crystal clear copper color, whispy off-white head. aroma is fairly strong and hoppy, but I don't dig the actual smell - it's a bit too earthy. taste is a bit too herbal and earthy for me as well for an IPA. I know it's an English IPA, but the flavors just don't work too well. decent malt balance. medium body and carbonation."

"I revisied this one after 2-3 years since my last review and it seems even better than I remember.  This beer is so well balanced it hits all the flavor profiles you expect from an ale  into one.  Bready and rich.  Some caramel sweetness.  Very full bodied, especially for a 5.0 ABV beer.  Then you get the hop crispness.  English style IPAs are so nice a variety they need to be visited much more often after having so many of the American hopped varieties.  This is a wonderful departure and compliment."

"A traditional English IPA, don't expect a hop soup. It is a malty beer if compared to nowadays IPAs."
""
"Final Grade: 3.96, a B+. Samuel Smith's India Ale is a finely crafted ale, but it really isn't blowing me away as this brewery so often manages - this might be my least favourite Samuel Smith's brew so far. Reminds me strongly of Wells IPA, except with a much more appealing aroma and complex hop bill - this brew provides plenty of leafy English hop bitterness, which may or may not appeal to fans of the American style. You'll have to judge this one on your own. I still like this beer, and would recommend it as a solid example of the style, but it's not a must-try."

"O: I drank this 14 months from when it was bottled so that could have affected my review. This is a decent beer, and probably my first British style IPA, however it is lacking in the areas of complexity, as well as ABV. This beer isn't exactly session able yet the ABV is in the range of a session beer. If i see this again and its fresh I will probably pick it up to give it another shot."
"Overall: I bought this because I truly love some of the other beers by Samuel Smith's, but this one just doesn't compare. I'm not saying its bad, but to me, it is definitely pretty plain. Glad to say I tried it, but I won't be buying again."

""
""

""

"Hazy light amber with 2 fingers of off white head. Bitter hops and malt in the nose. The flavor is very mild, with not a large hop presence. Mild English hops are balanced by a slightly sweet malt, and there is a surprising amount of bitterness. Creamy mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. It was a bit watery tasting, however. A decent beer from Sam Smith's but one of my least favorites from them. I'll stick with oatmeal stout and RIS."

""

""
""
"Overall 3.75: Great beer and a fantastic introduction to the ancestor of America's current brewing obsession, the IPA. This beer is not hop-focused and in fact it seems that certain special malts (and perhaps a yeast strain) have been chosen for their ability to mask -or, perhaps, better match-- the large number of hops used in this brew. This is a malty, biscuity, somewhat dry brew, but it is very refreshing and would be excellent with food. Certainly worth a try for any of my fellow ""Continental"" hop-heads, but taste it with an education about what you are drinking. This is not an American IPA and that is not a bad thing."
""
""
""
""
"O - A decent beer, my first English IPA. I will say I prefer the hoppier American version, but I'd like to sample others from this style. I like the maltiness, which gives it a lager feel to an extent. The taste itself mixes lot's of malt and fruitiness, and the taste isn't bad, it's just a bit watery. Decent beer, I can see myself drinking it again, but I won't actively seek it."

"550 ml bottle into imperial pint glass, bottled on 7/05/2012. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 2 finger fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, toast, bread, floral, grass, honey, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of fruity/floral hop and yeast notes with good malt balance; and solid strength. Taste of orange zest, pear, apple, caramel, toffee, floral, light pine, toast, bread, grass, honey, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of orange, light fruits, caramel, toffee, floral, light pine, toast, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of moderate hop flavors; with a very balanced malt backbone and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and slightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good English IPA style. Very nice balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a cloudy orange with a small white head, dissipates very quickly. Smells of grassy and floral hops, very nice. Tastes of earthy hops and nice grain that adds a little sweetness. Beer is slightly overcarbonated, but for its light body goes down really well. Overall, an above average beer."
""
"Not bad by Samuel Smith standards, yet not nearly as balanced or drinkable as their standard bitter offerings as well. In terms of setting the historical recipe of British IPAs, this is a very nice tribute and recreation of the now highly pepped up and competitive beer style. I would imagine this is better fresh, what with all these alpha acids falling apart at this point. This paired very well with Chinese food, and at this point, I couldn't imagine not pairing it with something international given the context. Worth a try, but not as essential as their other beers."

"The nose was hops first and foremost although the malt content doesn't hide away either. The taste is very simular to what the aroma hints at: a hop fronted malt laden brew with a good depth of flavours. Fairly dry at times but a very good brew and ideal for the moment when I opened this bottle."
""
"Overall I enjoyed this traditional English IPA very much. If I had gone into it expecting a West Coast-style hop blast I would have been disappointed, but I didn't, and I wasn't. I'll drink this beer again for sure."
"poured from bottle into a pint glass. very small amount head disappeared quickly and left no lacing. much darker than expected with a dark amber color. doesn't look like most ipas. not very bitter or fruity like the label suggests. the heavy malt flavor/aroma jumps out immediately and remains. i prefer the american version, but this is still a solid offering."

"the first thing from sam smiths that hasn't wowed me. in fact, I didn't even really like this brew and think it flawed in some ways. it pours a fine shade of amber, like light maple syrup, and has a decent head about an inch and a half tall, but it doesn't last. the nose is sort of drab. stale hops and sweeter English malts that don't taste particularly fresh themselves. is smells like wort not beer honestly, sort of weird. the flavor is also sort of dull, I was hoping for a lot more hops here, but they just never come. its like a movie without a climax. there is also some dusty flavor that is out of place. it just doesn't come together for me the way the other sam smith beers do. the yeast stands out more than it probably should in this style too. its lacking carbonation, being pretty close to flat, and that makes it a bit heavy and filling to drink. maybe I got a bad bottle or something, because I expect much higher quality from sam smiths now. I also had this after a couple of pretty mean American india pale ales, so perhaps my palate didn't do justice to this beer as it otherwise might have. I will have to revisit this in the future."

"O - a very sessionable and traditional tasting english ipa, worthy of regular purchase"
""
"Strangely spicy, but it does wear our its welcome. Quite malty but with a touch of the metallic, or else it's just a serious amount of the British mineral water taste. A little sharp but pleasantly sudsy in the mouth. Only $2.50 for this 16 oz bottle and other Samuel Smith beers at a liquor store where you can wire money to the gormless youth in your life."

"India Ale pours a clear dark golden color, with a long lasting head. The aroma is rather malty, with hints of the floral hops coming through. The taste has a strong malty backbone, with hints of a sweet hoppyness near the end. Full flavor, and easy to drink. Overall this taste more like a pilsner, but there are hoppeir pilsners out there, but still not a bad beer."
""
"Overall this is probably my favorite IPA. I'm not a hop head so this fits the bill perfectly for me! I also feel that this is a world class beer and am now a strong fan of Samuel Smith Old Brewery which is now on my bucket list of breweries to tour!"
"O: Quite drinkable and plasant British style IPA. Nice and smooth"
""
"Overall this is a good beer. It is unique in its lightness and flavor, even thought it is not very strong (5% ABV). Refreshing and very easy to drink with good a good balance of flavors."
"The bottle says it’s “exceptionally full-flavored and complex” which I found to be an exaggeration. It is by far not a bad beer; It’s just not very interesting. It is malty and hoppy/bitter which is true to its category but lacks some depth or “layers” of flavor you get with other IPAs."

"O: Not one of my first choices of Samuel Smith, but far from something to snub your nose at."
""
"O: save your money and try this company's Old Brewery Pale Ale would be my suggestion. it's not terrible in any way ... and frankly, I'm not sure how qualified I am to score an English IPA because this might be the only one I've tried if we're being technical and staying strictly within the confines of each defined beer style. but for the price, I think you can get more Arrogant Bastard and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale for the same money ... so do so."

"I probably sound like I'm really down on it, but as far as beers go and EIPA's it's a good beer, just not great, and if you want the real bold bitter hop feel, you'll have to look elsewhere."
""
"For Sam Smiths, this brew was a disappointment. I was hoping for (what I feel to be) a classic EIPA, and got really...nothing special. Fairly standard pale ale with a bit of extra hops to the finish. Again, expectations play their part in this, but judging from others' perspectives, I'm not alone in thinking that this brew could have been a lot better."
""
""
""
"O - I knew it was an English IPA, but I struggle to even give it that label. The absence of flavoring hops and the big malt character comprises the 800 pound gorilla in the room. Just isn't what I expected. Maybe it's an age issue, there was no date on the bottle I could find. Probably will stick with their darker beers in the future."

""
"Poured a deep golden color with a white, foamy head. Aromas of English malts, cereal grains and spicy hops. Sweet, ripe, dark fruits up front with more citrus-like flavors coming through later. Bitter finish, but not too dry. Carbonation just right. Hops are bitter, but not as piney or grapefruity as most American IPAs, and more complex. Still, not one of my favorite styles."

"O - This is a very solid, balanced EIPA. Samuel Smith consistently sells great beers at a great price."

"O: Not at all like the IPA I'm used to drinking. Maybe America bastardized the style, but we bastardized it for the better. Oh, and Rate Beer has this listed as an ESB. This beer seems to fall much more in line with that style."
"O - I'm not a fan of the varieties of hops used in this traditional style. It leaves an aftertaste that does not suit me."

"pale golden orange colour, one finger of rocky white head, lots of lace on the glass. Smell is of biscuity malts, bitter earthy hops, some fruit, pear, apple and a bit of caramel sweetness. Taste is mildly bitter up front, biscuity malt and almost toasted at times, earthy and floral hop flavours and a light sweetness. Lightly carbonated, medium body, above average feel. A fine english IPA, not something I would reach for all too often but certainly something I would entertain again."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours slightly hazy orangish tinged copper with a slightly off-white head. There are some tiny bubbles visible in the beer. There is some lacing left on the side of the glass. The aroma is of sweet and bready malts with some fruity smells as well. The malt backbone is more sweet than bready, but in a cloying way. The hop presence is there to provide some back end bitterness and those mild fruit notes I picked up in the nose. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is smooth. Overall, I wasn't impressed with this one."

"Overall, an ok English IPA but it almost drinks more like an ESB. The malt really overpowers the hops but it is a pleasure to drink nonetheless."

""
" Overall: 4.5/5: excellent brew!"

"Overall, this is a fine enough English ale. Perhaps a fresher bottle would yield better results. I enjoyed it fine enough, but I'm going to reach for an ESB like Wells Bombardier ten times out of ten over this beer in the future."

""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the satisfying drinkability, and nice balance throughout the flavor. The nose was comparatively weak on hops, and it was overly sour. The beer stayed well to style, and was very characteristic for the brewery, but just didn’t carry the punch we were hoping for."
"A classic beer."
""
"Overall - This being my first experience with the English IPA, I must say that it is certainly not for me. Although I think American brewers sometimes get out of hand with their hoppy character, this English counterpart has almost no hop presence. I would absolutely recommend trying this beer once, just to get the feel for the English version of the IPA, but it must be explained that the English take on the IPA is very different from the American. A drinker going into a bottle of Samuel Smiths expecting something even close to a Stone product (for example) is in for a rude awakening."
""
""
"O - a good example of the style."
"O- this bottle is actually old, probably close to two years or so. And it held up remarkably well. Probably the best English IPA out there"
"Overall this is a solid beer, but nothing that will blow you away. That being said it is easy to drink and the price point is pretty good so its worth trying."
""
""
"O - A great example of an English IPA with a great balance and flavor profile, and a nice change of pace from the monotony of American IPAs on the market."
"Pretty average English IPA. I'd expect the hops to be English but more prominent than in this brew. Nothing wrong with it, but not really exciting."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very drinkable beer, but nothing too spectacular."
""
"O - Very tasty. Was not expecting the heavier malt over hop profile. But, with this being an English IPA, I should have guessed. Definitely a great take on a historic ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the a perfect example of a true English style IPA. The different hops provide a very unique taste. If you want to see how different hops can influence a brew, then this is definitely a beer to try!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Very fascinating brew, much more mild on the hops than any other IPA i have tired; British or American. However very well done indeed, makes for a great session ale."

"Pours a crystal amber with etched surface and some ringed whites. Smells of sweet malts. Not really getting much hop presence, even for an English IPA, this nose is super tame. Flavor of sweet, amber malts with some hints of oxidation and a little bitterness on the finish. The malt profile is quite pleasant, but the hops have all but died here. Starting to feel like this bottle is old, but it's hard to tell. Medium bodied with subdued carb and a semi dry finish. Meh."

"Another great beer from Samuel Smiths, this is the best English IPA that I've had.Fantastic beer. Would make for a great session with it's moderate abv."
""
"Very much like this beer. Understated english subtlety is a nice change of pace, especially when it is so balanced."
"The high level of quality was evident in this beer with the consistent lacing and the well defined English character. I found the beer to be very enjoyable."
"Overall a very enjoyable, tasty brew, but what else should one expect from a brewer of this caliber…"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Definitely not as good as the pale ale. I was really hoping for either a higher level of flavor complexity or a more bright and floral beer and I didn't actually get either. While not bad I didn't think it was very good too. I'm going to have to go seek out the best English India Pale Ale I can find here in Northern California. Fullers? If anybody has any suggestions message me!"
""
""
""
"Just ok. Might make a good pale ale but I doubt this would survive a voyage from Great Britian to India by ship. Not a bad brew overall but just not what I want out of an IPA."
"RJT"
"This is a very malty IPA with little hop character. It's more fruity than hoppy. It's a little sweet for my liking with the caramel malt really coming through."
""
""
""
""
"O - Very mild, very British, very typical of the style. Nice enough for a session beer, but not a standout of the brewery which is one of the world's best."
""
"Review from 7/2011 notes. Poured into a Black Raven pint glass. Pours a clear coppery orange amber. One finger off-white head and no lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt and a light fruit component. Reminiscent of a doppelbock. Flavor is more muted. Starts with neutral malt with a peppery hop bite, dry malt middle and hop bitterness in the finish. The malts are not distinctive. The spicy hop start is interesting, but the ale overall is rather low key. Light to medium body. Like a watered down, somewhat hoppy old ale. No need to return to this one."
""
"O - Very balanced smell/taste. Hops are not showcased but merely added to brush the style. Refreshing enough, nothing leaving me begging for more."
""
""
""
"Overall: You can't knock this beer at all, I have had three Samuel Smith beers this week for the first time and this brewery has done a hat trick. Full of taste, and a beer that will not disappoint. Hope you all have enjoy, Salud!"

"I give this Great English Pale Ale a overall of 4.0. When it comes to Pale Ales is hard to find a better one then this for overall flavor and balance."

"Classic English Pale Ale. Even though us American's are use to these super hop high abv. IPA's, sometimes you have to step down and try the original version. Along with Fuller's, I think Sam Smith has captured the classic version of an original IPA."
""
"O: Very tasty brew here. Like the Oatmeal stout, it is straightforward and has no frills. A highly sessionable beer and one I would recommend."
""

"Overall enjoyable though."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good, but not overwhelming either."
"O: I might but this again, if I wanted an IPA but didn’t want to be knocked on my keister. It doesn’t pack a wallop, but it’s a decent second tier IPA. It tasted shockingly good with my Filet-O-Fish sandwich. Kind of makes me wish I’d bought two of both. Cheers."
""
"Pours a copper color with a one finger head. Decent lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is malt, hops, grass, and some fruit. The taste is very malty, with toffee, fruit and hops. Lots of grains and malt in this brew. Feel is medium, with decent carbonation with a slightly bitter finish. Overall, this is a good brew from a great brewery. Cheers."
"I've had this several times in the past as I'm quite a fan of Samuel Smith brews so I figured I may as well review. I poured this from a 550ml bottle straight to pint glass. Poured a nice frothy head and settled to a wispy lace. The color is a deep amber. The smell to me was one of caramel with a hint of the underlying alcohol. For an IPA, it is significantly less bitter than some other IPA's. If you're looking for a hop bomb, look elsewhere. The taste of hops is in the undertone and what is apparent is the delicious taste of malts. Mouthfeel is silky and pleasant. The carbonation is prefect. Overall a great IPA and very drinkable. This IPA is well paired with any spicy cuisine or by itself for a session."

"O - A good beer to accompany a meal. A good complexity between the malt and the hops."
"O - I'm not too familiar with the ""English"" IPA style, but its definitely a much more mellow beer than American IPAs."
""
""
""
"Not at all a bad beer, and while very drinkable, it's remarkably simple and even somewhat plain."
""
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English India Pale Ale."
"Overall - Just like with their pale ale, I had been avoiding this one for years because I'm wasn't (then) a pale ale/IPA guy and had an aversion to strong hop bitterness. Turns out I needn't have avoided this one either. Unlike the pale ale, however, I don't think I'll get this one again, which is a first for me with Samuel Smith's brews. Not that I dislike it - it's perfectly sessionable and refreshing. But like the pale ale it lacks something on the back end, lacks robustness. The pale ale skates by just on the edge of watery. This one seems to cross the line and I want more flavor and richness in a beer. One possible factor, I got this from my grocery store's build-your-own-sixpack rack. I can't think this would be a popular choice in this hick town and so may be old stock."
""
"In appearance and aroma the beer starts off very promising, but fails miserably in the taste department. Overall, it's a good beer, but the taste is what matters and this one doesn't pass my test."
""
""
"O- I am delightfully surprised by this beer and see it as one I could drink all day ... if only I had more. Doesn't have the hops I am used to, but it is near perfectly balanced for my tastes and I hope to have another soon."
""
""
""
""
"O- A decent IPA, tame by today's standards, good with a barbecue chicken sandwich."
""
"I wouldn't seek another out, but if orange bitter flavors with a more grainy malt sounds like a good change of pace this one might really work for you."
""
""
""
"O: I usually like Sam Smith beers a lot, but truth be told, I'm inclined to prefer American interpretations of the IPA over this one. It has the excellent drinkability factor of most Sam Smith ales, but it isn't as satisfying as them, either. Still worth considering if you want a more classical spin on the IPA, though."
"Nothing to write home about but it is a very well done beer. Makes for something good and session-able without wearing out your tongue."
"The aroma is actually very malt forward. Leafy, European hops are definitely strong in the aroma but the toasted grain aroma is actually very welcome. The flavor is very balanced! Toasted malts dominate initially but are quickly washed away by herbal, leafy, raw, grassy hops. Delicious! A dry grainy finish is actually perfect for the style. The thing I like most about this beer is the malt profile, VERY toasty. Toasted, honey wheat bread. The mouthfeel and carbonation are just excellent. Medium bodied with a creamy head. Just an excellent beer and spot on for the style."
"Medium mouthfeel and only a slight oily hop texture. The brew is probably along the lines of an APA, but is very drinkable. Solid brew and I would definitely recommend to those who are just starting to experience hoppy brews."
"I think I've become too jaded by the heavily hopped American IPAs (SN Pale Ale has more hops). This is not one of them, it doesn't try to be, and I respect that. If you can get the West coast IPA out of your head this is a truly tasty beer. Impeccably balanced with a wonderful malt profile. I can't say I'll be getting it again, but thats more because there are too many damn good beers out there I haven't tried. I will recommend this to any fan of British ales, or AIPA fans looking to try what the style originally was. Cheers!"
""
"O - A decent IPA, good malt and hop combination in both the aroma and flavor. Not as hoppy as many IPAs I tend to enjoy, but still a good beer that I imagine will be even better during warmer months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Pretty straightforward English IPA."
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Milder and better then most IPAs I've tried, but sadly not my cup of tea. Sadly much like light lagers already have two strikes going in to most reviewers, such is my plight with IPAs as they are just too hoppy for my liking. I like to think I gave this one a fair shake, but take my review with a grain of salt. Try it, but if you can't handle high hop beers like me, you aren't going to like it."
""
"Ok beer, but not great. It's a bit thin and not overly complex. A good go to for a lighter beer, but not my first choice."
""
"I give a Schlitz for this classic example of its style; just as Schlitz is a classic example of its style."
"O - Nothing special about this one. Wouldn't have even guessed that that was an IPA if this was tasted blindly. Not a bad beer, but nothing I would ever seek out again."
"O - Sets the standard for the English IPA, I could drink quite a few of these!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Straight 4's here. I think this is a great easy to drink beer. I like the low alcohol factor with the fruity taste with this and it's a great price to boot."
"It was a reddish gold colour and lots of bubbles rising. It Smelled quite nice very floral and Im getting hints of peach and apricot. Nice grape fruity taste to it and its quite bitter, I also get hints of honey. It has a rather peculiar mouth feel while remaining dry it is still nice and watery. Overall I would buy this lots (that is if my Liquor commission would stock it outside of a gift set) I would recommend it to any one who likes IPA's."
"This is a good IPA and a bit different than those Americans are known for producing. It's nice to try what the rest of the world has to offer."
""
""
"O - Samuel Smith makes a very nice English IPA. It is quite different and milder than American IPAs, which I think explains the lower average score than this deserves. Its very drinkable and well-constructed. Its a gorgeous and tasty beer; one that is worth your time and effort."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied. Fairly low level of carbonation makes the texture slick . A very easy drinker. A nice contrast to its American counterparts."
"A very nice english pale ale that hits all of the right notes for the style IMO. This is definitely a brew I could drink all evening."
""
"O: I don't see this as an IPA. I see this as more of a really earthy ESB. To me, this beer is a keeper simply because of the manner in which it showcases the flavors of classic English ale hops. It's very laid back and smooth for such a flavorful ale."
"Overall I thought that this was a pretty average English IPA, I admit I don't have that much experience with English IPA's and this is my first traditional one brewed in England, but this IPA just didn't do it for me, there wasn't enough hop flavors to balance out the overly sweet malts. The lack of flavor and the sweeter then normal malts makes this beer not that drinkable a whole bottle is a little too much, I lost interest after the first 8 ounces. What I liked most about this beer was the look and mouthfeel, it looked pretty good in the Samuel Smith pint glass, and the mouthfeel was on par for an English IPA. What I liked least about this beer was the aroma and taste, the aroma was pretty close to their Nut Brown Ale with those overly sweet malts that smell more like a mixture of sherry and apple juice then they smell like a beer, and the taste wasn't too balanced with the overly sweet malts taking over putting the hops on the back burner. I won't be buying this beer again, and I would have to be pretty desperate for a beer to drink this again. I don't recommend this beer, the malt base is too sweet and it doesn't let enough hop flavors come through. So far I am 0 for 2 with the Samuel Smith Holiday pack, this beer wasn't as bad as the Nut Brown Ale, but it still wasn't good either. I don't know if these beers are old or if I just don't like the sweet malt profile of their beers. Bridge Brew Work's IPA is still my favorite IPA, I would gladly take that or this beer any day. I hope their Oatmeal Stout is much better because so far I am unimpressed with this English Brewery."

"This ale pours an amber, burnt orange sort of color and packs plenty of head that lingers in the glass for awhile. The smell is sort of citrus like, mixed with hops, and a bread like odor. Taste was not what I was expecting. Bitter, but not overly dry. Although there is some sweetness present in the odor, it does not come through in taste, mostly a thin, bitter taste with a mild bite. It tastes refreshing, but the bitterness makes it sort of a sipping beer. A slight bit watery. It's decent overall, but nothing I would go out of my way to find again."
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
"I’m not usually a big fan of India ales but this one was good. It was malty with a very nice hoppy crispness to it. There was not a lingering hoppy bitterness to it that usually turns me off to India ales. I liked the sweet fruity smell of the ale which matched the fruity hoppy flavors. The malt flavors were nice which appears to be typical of Samuel Smith ales and English ales in general."
""
""
"Victorian pint glass into a Samuel Smith's pint glass. Gift packs are great for drinking beers in their own glasses. Don't expect an huge hoppy IPA in the American style out of this beer. The hops are significantly less bitter and significantly less. It's not massively bitter, but it's a decent beer that helps the drinker get a feel for how the style started. With American IPAs averaging in the 7% range these days to move product by attracting consumers to the high alcohol content, this English ale is a refreshing change of pace, at 5% alcohol and American pale ale level IBUs. Purchased as part of a gift pack at Nick's Liquors in Hammond, IN and it was reasonable. Recommended."

""
""
"Poured from a 550 ml bottle into a Samuel smith pint glass, coded date. This pours a nice golden color with a foamy tan head. The smells are of light hops and biscuit malts. The feel is medium. The taste is good, light hops compared to an American ipa, with a malt backbone. Slightly more bitter than many esb."
"Overall this was pretty decent but I have had better. For some reason I am just not that impresssed with what comes out of this brewery. Gonna have to try some of the organics to see if it changes my mind,"
"O: Full-flavoured, but not as aggressive with the hops (or malt) as its American IPA cousins. Honestly, that's a good thing in my book. The hops is a little strong for my taste, but for the style (which isn't my favourite), it's not bad at all."
"overall a nice beer, seemingly at times a watered down attempt on comparison to AmIPAs but definitely not a bad one to savour and session. liked it."
"D: A spot-on English IPA that makes up for a lack of complexity with drinkability; I really wish I could find it outside of Samuel Smith's seasonal gift pack, because it'd be a great summer beer. A benchmark IPA worth trying for any fan of English ales."
"While I am a hophead and prefer the aggressive hoppy American IPA style best, I must say that this would be a great session beer because this went down so smooth and easy, it was really enjoyable and I thought it was very good overall. A solid beer that is worthy of trying and drinking all night."
"This isn't what most people would typically think of an IPA. It's English and I think it is right on par for that style. This is extremely clean and drinkable. Great consistency and approachable in its flavor profile. Very well made, but maybe it's more of a pale ale. Still a solid beer in my book."
"Actually reminiscent of grapefruit juice in taste as well. A good bready malt stands up nicely to the slight tang found from the grapefruit hops, but doesn't get in the way of a nice little bitter hop bite in the end. A slightly bitter finish lingers for a little bit, also leaving that tanginess. Its slightly undercarbonated, leading to a watery mouthfeel that doesn't complement the flavors as well as it could. It feels slightly vinous, which doesn't seem to work in this one. All around though its not a bad beer. Sam Smith can always be counted on to come up with a good one, this just isn't my favorite by them. Solid beer though."
"From the 355 ml. bottle. Sampled on October 20, 2011. It pours copper-amber with great clarity and a long lasting, clinging soapy head. Malts start up the aroma along with a candied butterscotch element. Hops are slight. The medium body maintains its texture. The taste is up front malty and slightly bitter on the end thanks to the laid back hops. Much more subtle than the modern day IPA and I have to wonder if this was the way IPA's were meant to be brewed way back when. The hops were more of a preservative and I expect brewers did not want to lose the character of their beer when it took the long trip to India. This is an IPA I could drink often because of its mellow subtlety."
"p.s. the website does not list the hops used here so i may be right, your guess is as good as mine,"
"Mouthfeel is good, I find the drinkability of this one much better than most India Ales. Overall a good beer, not my faorite Sam Smith but definitely solid!"
"Notes: A huge fan of Samuel Smith beers I come to this after trying many English Pale Ales. Seeing that this IPA is an extension of those not in kind but in degree is a revelation. The hoppiness here is not citrus or pine but a deep, robust earthiness that is comfort to the soul."
"M - Medium carbonation & body"
"This is my first review of an English IPA. I've had a few others and this is definitely the on the lighter, less hoppy, maltier side. This is a good IPA to drink if you want to have a mellow IPA to wash down your food. I am interested in trying more beers in this style. I would like to try this on tap."
"I can tell from the lacing that a considerable amount of hops were used, but other than that, the hops are much more subtle than I'm used to. Then again, I'm a CA hop head. Although this is more sweet and malty than I expected, I was surprised at how much I liked it. That said, I think this beer could use some more bittering agents and it felt a bit unbalanced. As a result, I don't think I would reach for it most days, but it's an interesting excursion from the normal California hoppiness I'm used to."
"Honeyed amber with a loose froth. Drying with a hint of caramel and biscuit. Hops balance evenly and add a fruity flare that works with the Sam Smith mineral signature. Currently it's drinking much more like an ESB but a tasty English ale nonetheless. Fresher bottles have a firm herbal bitterness that drives the beer more so than the yeast."
"Nice change from hop central."
"O- This isn't a bad beer, but rather one that I would session as opposed to philosophizing over- the malt syrup flavor is a little annoying after a while, but if you just enjoy the sweet and bitter general beer flavors without worrying I think it's a beer that can be enjoyed."
"Taste is a bit sweet, not too bitter but still well balanced, there's a light grassy bite on the end that's refreshing and fairly smooth."
"The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of floral and perfume from the hops as well as some bread and a little bit of earthiness. The flavor is the same. I get a low to medium amount of bitterness with some grass and earth notes. There is also a slight amount of floral notes in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O: A nice beer to sit and sip. I did a US-England side-by-side for IPA day w/ this & Left Hand's 400 Pound Monkey, and this came out on top."
"Overall, this is a decent beer. I'm not the hugest fan of the English IPA style, but this one is enjoyable. At the same time, there isn't a whole lot too exciting going on."
"Overall: A very tasty, well-balanced beer that is certainly worth your time to try."
"Milder than most English IPA, but a little stronger than most English Pale Ale. It’s a very good beer."
"Pours a semi-clear amber color with a puffy 2 inch light tan head that fades to a small cap. Nice tight thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel/toffee, and a delicate citrus zest aroma. Taste is of biscuit-like malt, caramel, and a subdued citrus zest hop flavor on the finish. Mild toasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lighter body with a crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good, very easy drinking English IPA and another good beer from Samuel Smith’s."
"O- This is a great English IPA. I do love a hoppy beer but this gives a different presentation. I have a feeling this is the way IPA's tasted in the old time. Cheers!"
"500ml bottle served in a PINT glass (London Pride). Enjoyed on Mar´11 Pours medium copper in color. Thick layer of white foam, close & lasting.Lacing is dense & lasting. Slightly malty aroma & yeast too. Nice hoppiness with an spicy touch. Medium body & medium/low carbonation. Refreshing. Woody & spicy aftertaste rounded by a gentle bitterness. Very well balanced beer. Suggested for a long drink, enjoying its IPA character shown ´til the end."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink, has a good balance, and is extremely sessionable. I would have no problem drinking several of these in succession."
"Definitely pleasant, with a great drinkability."
"D - I'm highly upset that I had not tried this sooner. Instant staple beer, and probably the best English IPA I've had. A must try."
"o - Overall a pretty nice beer. Not a lot of hops, and the taste especially is more focused on malts, but enjoyable none the less. Lots of apples in the nose and taste; the nose reminded me a bit of apple juice. Very easy to drink, would have it again."
"Neck was stamped: ""SD14J1""."
"This is a good beer, you just have to know what you’re getting into. If you want a hoppy, IPA style brew, you probably want to steer clear of this one. If you prefer a decent malty affair, then go for it. So when you go to try Sam Smith India Ale for the first time and you’re like, “WTF?,” just know you've officially warned you."
"Tasting the beer those notes are confirmed not only up front, but throughout. In the middle some sweeter notes, like a very little caramel or brown sugar eases up the mat dominance, and at the end a little floral hop balances this beer nicely. It is a medium bodied beer that is very drinkable, but with an ABV of only 5, it certainly has not the kick like most American IPA' s."
"This one pours a muddy red-borwn color with a finger of head that retains and laces well. Aroma is primarily of nutty, biscuity malts, with some subtle earthy and floral hopping. The taste follows the nose here, those malts are really the star of the show, as the hopping remains subtle, adding a nice earthy edge to the brew. The mouthfeel is nice, it's got a medium body and a decent level of carbonation, and the drinkability is solid. A very good English IPA. It's very English though, don't come anywhere near this expecting a hop bomb."
"Poured for a bottle to a snifter and it poured a amber almost copper color with a small off white head that didn't last long but left great lacing. The smell was a little muted but I could pick up malts, caramel, toffee, a little sweetness, faint hops. Taste was the above malt taste up front that slowy gave way to the hop taste at the finish, a little pine resin and citrus. Mouthfeel was medium and the carb level was perfect. Overall it was a pleasent and different IPA. Another good brew for Samuel Smith and worthy of a try."
" Grade A Purchased at Stoney's- 4pk. $11.99"
"This is a worthy, complex ale from a world class brewery. Indeed,given the ale's complexity and strong flavors, it is surprising this ale is only 5 % ABV. Well worth seeking out for a different interpretation of an IPA."
"O: Not one of my favourite beers, EIPAs, or Sam Smith's. A good enough beer, all told, and probably better than I make it out to be, but I don't recommend it. Wouldn't have again."
"Overall - Another solid sammy smith beer. Really easy to drink, and easy to enjoy. Really this beer is too mild for any hophead or seasoned ipa drinker. A perfect starter ipa or a low alcohol alternitive to other craft beers."
"Appearance is darker than your typical IPA; more of a dark cooper to light brown color. A moderate white head lasts about halfway through, with little lacing. Upon opening the bottle, you are greeted with a wonderful floral/fruity scent; smells almost like apple to me. The taste is wonderful too - hops are prominent but well balanced with malt. The earthy pear bitterness is backed by a slight butterscotch. Looking forward to enjoying another one of these."
"Drinkability: The quintessential English IPA - this is a classic"
"Again very earthy with moderate bitterness on the finish. Light acidic qualities in the mid palate, caramel and toffee with green apple and pear like fruit quality. Drying and quick on the finish. Creamy mouth until the abrupt ending. A nice beer by itself but a great beer with food."
"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Clear copper pour with two finger head with nice lacing and retention. The nose is very metallic at first. Strong, smell of pennies that mellows after a while and becomes much more fruity and pleasant with hints of perfume. The taste is very well balanced. Nice sweet caramel malt base offset nicely with a bitter, tangy hop bite. Earthy, spicy and toasty all at once with hints of tea, citrus, pennies and toffee. Super smooth, dry, bitter finish makes this a great session beer. Another great beer from Samuel Smith's!"
"This pours dark orange with nice chunky head. I hate to sound non-specific, but it has that European nuttiness in the smell, possibly yeast. The taste is fairly hollow on the first impression. It isn't sweet or particularly malty. I don't pick up on an abundance of hops. I think it smells like a Guinness, and it has the same cereal maltiness in the taste. I will say that this has decent drinkability and a good, medium mouthfeel. It is nice and bitter and has a pleasant bite. ""Old world beer"" is what I keep thinking in my mind. There is a metallic flavor that I don't care for. This just does not have to fruitiness or hoppiness that I crave in an IPA. For me, this is more like a brown ale or an ESB...or an English Bitter for that matter. This beer makes me want to eat cheese."
"Interesting IPA, hard to compare it to all of the modern ones that I have had. If this is in the original style of an IPA it is quite subtle by modern standards, a solid beer none the less."
"Overall, this is a great English IPA, a regular in my fridge and an inspiration for my next batch of homebrew."
"D - A good solid IPA but have tried much better."
"The first time I had this I think the bottle may have been a little older or been sitting on a shelf passed it's expected life because I got a bottle of this for Christmas last year and it was much better than the first time I had it. The hops were actually noticeable in the new bottle unlike the old one. This beer was a really nice English IPA, and definitely worth a try."
"This beer defines the style: if it weren't for Sam Smith's I have trouble imagining the American craft beer movement. The beer has a lot in common with New England style IPAs: Harpoon, Long Trail, Shipyard--milder, herb-like fuggles and goldings hops. With the biscuit and toffee malts dominating the smell and taste, it shares much of the profile of barlewine, except for the much lighter alcohol content. The magic is in brewing a 5% beer with this much flavor! So happy to track down a 4pack of 12-oz bottles."
"Creamy mouthfeel, light carbonation. Too bad this doesn't come in six packs (at least at my local liquor store)."
"Conclusion: My favorite example of this style that I have tasted so far, and all around a tasty beer. I get a craving for some English hops once in a while, and this satisfies excellently."
"Carbonation is a little too high."
"Drinkability: Good stuff. Far from your typical hop bomb from the west coast, India Ale is a solid English IPA that delivers malts and hops, and does not go over the top."
"D - Quite different from most American IPAs. Or maybe American IPAs are different from English IPAs. Either way, it is more malty than most IPAs I've had. The only hangup was the smell, or lack of. It was tasty and different."
"D: Even though I had hoped for a little more upfront hops, the lackthereof made it quite sessionable. Went down nicely, and would order again."
"Pours a nice copper color from a bottle. Perfect carbonation and lacing. Has a slight bready smell and taste on the dry side but works well together. Lingering bitterness. A nice pizza beer. Seems to be hopped just right, slightly floral and tangy. I could drink a pitcher of this. Must be the hard water."
"Overall this is a drinkable and enjoyable beer. Although there is no huge taste or hop surge here, it is pleasant nonetheless. Very different from IPAs of the American variety, but for what it is--a nice English IPA--this is a well-balanced, moderate ale."
"Overall I do like this beer but it is seemingly un-IPA like. I have made and tasted many English IPAs and I have to say that this one is marching to the beat of its own drum."
"How is this an IPA and not just a nice hoppy bitter? Hop character is spicier than average and it's good quality as you'd expect from SS, but not so much to style. Other beers I'd rather have for an IPA."
"A lot of subtle flavor is a bit ruined by the aftertaste at first. It disappeared and became much more enjoyable closer to room temperature. Of course it's not a big hoppy brew as IPA's have come to be but it has good flavor and is a proper English beer served ""warm""."
"Pours a big creamy off white head. Hazy pale body. Smells mostly of bready malts, yeasty esters and some sweet crystal malts. Tastes of pale malts, bready yeast, some citrus hops. Fairly crisp finish. Some lingering bitterness to balance it out. Full bodied, medium carbonation. I could have a few of these at a time. This tastes like an english ale through and through. I won't seek this again for some time but will give it another go when I'm in the mood for an easy drinking english style beer."
"D: Good for those looking for an English style IPA. Personally the sediment flavor gets to me after 1."
"It was decent, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"It tastes good, I could have another, but if I were looking for an IPA this would disappoint. The hops flavor simply isn't prominent enough. It's still delicious in it's own right, however."
"355 ml bottle, from Voldby Kødmandsgård, Denmark. ABV is not mentioned on the label. Deep golden colour, big to moderate white head. Moderate aroma - malts, a little caramel, hints of orange marmalade. The flavour is moderately malty with hints of toffee and oranges, and is smooth and pleasant to drink - but the hoppiness is nowhere near an American IPA. Still, there are some hops in the finish, and the overall impression is a fairly well balanced premium bitter / ESB."
"It's a pretty creamy ale. Although the nose isnt the most appetizing description, this is a good ale. Complex taste, but I've had better.... today."
"Overall: Good beer overall and a nice example of an English IPA. Nothing spectacular here, but it's worth trying."
"One of the better beers available at Raley's for around $5."
"I'm never a big fan of English-style IPA and while this example is not really an exception, I can acknowledge that it is very well-made. If English IPA was my thing I'm sure this would be a favorite. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again but would definitely check it out if I ever come across it on tap or cask somewhere (not likely). Definitely a good drinker."
"A very nice beer all up, and probably one of the best English IPAs I've had the opportunity to try. Missing a bit on the nose, but otherwise the package is solid."
"Givin the right conditions (in british isles) would drink this a night. That said I like our version."
"Overall a very good beer, less hoppy than I would hop even for an English IPA, but good nonetheless. I would drink this again."
"Pours a dark amber with a two-finger cream colored head. Nice look, great lacing and the head stays around as well. Light caramel, sweet bread and a hint of apple aroma. Biscuity, sweet bread malt. Light toffee. Followed by some earthy tones until a fruity hint of hops finally shows up. The sweet fruit lingers until the finish."
"I could put down quite a few of these."
"The best thing about this ale is its looks, a clean and radiant orange copper. Only minimal lacing though. Nose is hoppy with some caramel and fig. Taste is hoppy with muted maltiness. Dry and semi-sweet. Decent but not overwhelming mouthfeel and good drinkability. Pretty good overall but not a go-getter."
"Drink: Pretty drinkable, but could be too sticky overtime."
"As a note, the first time I had this I wasn't a fan at all, and in my somewhat basic spreadsheet I keep of beers I've had I gave it a 2/5. So, if you had it before and are reading this... why not give it another try?"
"Definitely not to be consumed cold in my opinion."
"I love Sam Smith. This IPA is delicious if you want to go light on the hops. It's a real pleasure to dink. I had it with smoked salmon. It was in heaven."
"D - Very pleasant, drinkable ale."
"D - heightened by complexity; lowered by slightly excessive earthiness."
"Picked this one up at the Greensboro Total Wine, no freshness date to be found on the bottle. Pours out a darker amber, almost no head seemed to form, no lacing either. Smell is malty and slightly musty. Some alcohol can be picked up as well, along with some raisins and figs. Very malt forward beer, with a dulling hop presence that makes it's way onto the palate, providing a touch of bitterness and very little flavor. Some faint dark ripened fruits appear with the first malty sip. Mouthfeel is moderate to light, but slightly watery and creamy. Very little carbonation in this bottle. Overall, something doesn't seem right about this bottle. Very, very low carbonation, flavors seemed extremely muted and meshed within the malt profile of the beer. Perhaps I could have picked up a bad bottle."
"I thought this was a good beer - went well with my pizza dinner."
"It's decent, though perhaps not my favorite of the style. Pretty drinkable and hopheads probably won't be disappointed."
"D/M: strong carbonation tingle, nice flavor makes it nice to drink, sweetness helps drinkability"
"A prodigious head and lovely lace. Clear with some bubbling going on at first, it eventually settles. Smell of caramel, honey and earthy hops. A hint of pine and vanilla. Some yeasty bread and light sweet malt. Taste is really something. Subtle and lovely. Caramel and multi grain bread. Firm leafy hops with an orange tea bitterness. Biscuity malt and grains linger in the clean dry finish as well as a leafy bitterness in the back of my throat. Feel is lighter than is typical and gently carbonated, with a nice crispness. Drinkable in the extreme as the lower abv and delightful taste and feel makes it a great session ale."
"Drink: Another good beer from Samuel Smith."
"D: Very drinkable. Not an overpowering IPA, more of a traditional brew."
"D: very good! I wish I had another."
"D: It's decent, but I'm starting to think that I might have bought a bad batch. There was dust on the bottle and no date. I think the vinegar flavors mean that it is pretty old....Unfortunately I can't be sure of that and I have 3 more to drink...maybe those will be better."
"D- A decent IPA, err English IPA I should say. Easy to drink, and could probably session this. Definitely prefer Samuel Smith's other offerings, and deffinitely prefer hoppier IPA's though."
"D) A decent brew. I think i'd have another."
"It has a smooth almost creamy texture and goes down with juicy feel."
"This is the first English IPA I've had. As I'd expected it was much less hoppy than the American versions. Very good beer that I could see myself drinking again. Well-balanced and very drinkable."
"d- not the best, i've had much better, it's certainly drinkable, but i feel like i need a celebration to cleanse my palate."
"Overall I found this to be a very well balanced and drinkable beer. I am glad it took me this long to try as I feel that I wouldn't have been able to detect the more subtle and well blended flavors had I tried this earlier in my craft drinking experience. Really just reminds me of what a classic beer should taste like."
"Summary - Not what I was expecting. Limited hoppiness. I enjoy alot of different Samuel Smith beers, but was disspointed by this one. Okay beer"
"M/D: Light body, highly drinkable beer"
"D: Definitely good, but if I were looking for a nice, hoppy IPA, I'd probably look for something else. Good beer, just not your standard American IPA. Note that this is my first English IPA, so I have nothing to compare it with in terms of hop character in other English IPAs."
"Drink - An interesting beer that is worth a try. I prefer the citrus/hoppy IPA's but I'm happy I gave this one a shot."
"500 ml bottle. Pours amber with a small fluffy white head that did not last long, medium carbonation. Sweet fruity malt aroma with notes of plum and pear. Good balance of earthy hops and juicy, fruity malt on the palate with a long dry finish. Good brew."
"Most IPA's I have access to are American and it has been a while since I had a British IPA. It isn't a big beer, but very bitter. I like it. The hops play a different role than the American counterpart. Of course the hop flavor is a lot different too. No citrus or pine in this style. I miss a good English ale and this hit the spot tonight."
"drinkability; pretty smooth and light but the bitterness throws it off a bit. A refreshing beer if one is in the mood for bitter flavors."
"Notes: at least the English characteristics make this brew an interesting ale. prefered amongst the more bitter IPA's out there (Must be the water)"
"I don't think English hops are as good as American hops for making IPA. Complexity of aroma is almost totally lacking in this brew. If you want this type of beer, just get their Nut Brown Ale, which tastes better, with less of this funky flavor. It is not undrinkable, just disappointing."
"D - This beer borderlines into ESB territory, but I really think it crosses into the IPA as the hops are a bit more than typical of an ESB. This would probably not satisfy a palate looking for more aggressive flavors - but if you look for the subtly of a well made beer - this will satisfy."
"Overall: Samuel Smiths has much better beers than this. This is a good ale for this style especially since it is British and they (Brits) started the IPA's. Are there better American versions of this style? Yes. But this is a good beer for a cold winter night. Cheers!"
"Nice, wonderfully drinkable (India) Pale Ale here. Pours a blushing tawny color with a soft, foamy, white, cask-like head that slowly settles out, taking the initial earthy hop aroma with it. What's left is a rich estery scent - cherries and apples - and a mellow malt sweetness. Much of the same in the taste - very fruity - it's the most dominant element here. The least dominant element is the bitterness - there, but a whimper. The malt impact and body is moderately light and the drinking is sweet and softly smooth. Would match up nicely with some West Coast takes on an English pale ale. Not (as) boldly hoppy in any sense, but quite enjoyable."
"D - Drinkability is low. I'm not looking for something ultra complex, but a little bit of diversity would help. This seems to be a one trick pony, and being completely focused on bitterness isn't something that appeals to me."
"Rich, amazingly clear caramel color. Large bubbles ring around edge of glass. Very very malty aroma, almost a fruity presence in aroma, maybe grape. Mild to moderate carbonation. Faint hop character to beginning with a Medium metallic note on finish. Malt character as well in end. Reasonably light on the mouthfeel with a malty grapey taste in the longer aftertaste. Good to know what an India Ale actually tastes like when it's shipped over seas like the olden days."
"Notes: I got this in a 3 pack with a glass (Oatmeal Stout, Nutbrown, and India. This is definitely my favorite, it makes me want to seek out more English beers."
"D - Why!?!?! This was such a disappointment. For such a reputable brewery this is very weak. I hope this was a bad bottle b/c I can't imagine this being let out the brewery intentionally."
"Drinkability - I am sure this would be a decent session beer, not something I would drive across the world to find."
"A bit more malt forward than I expected, but is well-balanced. Would be a good quaffer if not for the rich mouthfeel which begs to be sipped and savoured slowly."
"D: It's a nice easy drinker that is balanced but interesting."
"Pours a clear amber with nice tan head. Aroma of floral hops, caramel. Taste is bitter hops, some caramel. Palate is nice medium body, nice carbonation. Finish is bitter hops balance by light malt, with some caramel. Overall not to remarkable but a good drinkable brew."
"Overall, this is another great beer from Samuel Smith's. It was much more complex than I had expected. I absolutely loved it and hope to drink more in the future."
"Poured a nice copper/amber color from a 550 mL bottle into an authentic Samuel Smith pint glass. Aroma is mostly malty with a hint of hops. The head is nice and frothy, with very good lacing and solid carbonation. A much milder IPA compared to those available in the US and those the taste buds have become accustomed to. Crisp, dry and leaves a slightly sour after-taste as opposed to a bitter/hoppy finish I was looking forward to. Indeed a different kind of IPA. Drinkability is good, but it wouldn't be an IPA that I would go looking for. I guess it is worth a try, but Samuel Smith's definitely has better brews."
"Drinkability: A decent English IPA. Has a unique tart flavor that I haven't encountered in other IPAs. Definitely worth a try..."
"M/D - Very drinkable beer, as each sip begs another. Medium body and frothy, creamy carbonation. I wish they sold this in a six pack!"
"This beer had an Amber colour and a decent head of about 3 or 4 mm high. It was lightly carbonated. The smell was of hops and yeast with a hint of nuttiness. The first thing I tasted was maltiness followed by a bitter nuttiness. There was a little foamy carbonation, but not enough."
"Drinkability: Though a little more bitter and less hoppy than the American IPA's that I am used to, I enjoyed the traditional English style that Sam Smith's has implemented. The transition of flavors was a welcome change, and I appreciated being able to enjoy an IPA without getting punched in the mouth by hops."
"American IPA is still my favorite style, but I have never really had too many English versions, so naturally Samuel Smiths is a good place to start. First of all this beer was served out of a 550 ml bottle into a Samuel Smith imperial pint glass. Golden amber in color with a fluffy thick head of about an inch and a half, extending well out of the boundries of the glass. Heavy malt and hop aroma, can definatly pick out British hops. Malty and fruity in flavor, some lingering bitterness from hops, but not at all as hoppy as the American versions. Actually pretty balanced between the carmally malt flavor and hop bitterness. Carbonation and body appropriate for the style."
"And that's likely the reason they stay the way they are. Samuel Smith uses a heavy glass bottle and, indeed, their beers are heavy too, not so much in flavour but in satisfaction. The Brits know their ale and they like to drink - this is a product of that culture. It's designed so that just one pint is enough to satiate... but several would be all the better."
"Overall: A solid foreign beer that's not impossible to find. Not as good as other Sam Smith's beers."
"Pours a clear, dark red with a decent amount of foam in the Samuel Smith pint glass. Very malt heavy and laid back as its the english style of ipa, so the flavours are mild and subtle with a slight hint of dark fruits/floral finish. Goes down pretty smooth. Just doesn't pack a lot of flavour. But i like this new pint glass! Holds 500mls worth of beer. Beauty."
"From a Samuel Smith gift pack that just arrived to the Control Board in Ontario. Pours a golden-orange colour with thick white head. Mild lacing around the glass. Floral hop aroma and some caramel. Flavour has more bitterness than the smell would suggest. Good carbonation. A nice English ale, but not my favourite among the other Samuel Smith beers."
"Drink well my friends"
"A thoroughly drinkable beer, just not a standout in this category."
"D: I would try again."
"D -- Very good drinkability -- can imagine whiling away the afternoon in a pub with pints of these. This isn't an American IPA with the big hop hammer over the head, but a well-balanced, easy drinking and very refreshing beer."
"D-- Drain Poured the rest. Will try again and review at a later date."
"550mL bottle. Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a small head. Great lacing throughout. Smell is somewhat sweet with some citrus. Faint aroma of hops. The taste is slightly bitter. Flavors of citrus with an almost sour taste. Some malt flavors near the end. I'm probably missing some other flavors. There is a lot going on here. This 550mL bottle is the perfect amount for this beer. Not overall drinkable but not a sipper either. Overall I'm happy with this purchase."
"Very sessionable (as most English beers are) gets smoother as it warms."
"drinkability - suitable for watching NFL games."
"Bottle into a tulip glass...Pours a light peach color ok retention and lacing, nothing special, typical ipa...The aroma is light, not that I expected otherwise, light fruit, a little hop, not much...Taste is ok, not flavorful but makes it a super easy drinker, light hops come through so its pleasant to drink. A decent english ipa, so-so, probably wouldn't have unless I was in England."
"Slainte."
"D- A pretty solid beer. No real flaws, but also not much about it really blew me away flavor-wise. It's a good bitter IPA, but it doesn't deliver the hop sharpness I'd expect."
"One of the coolest bottles I've seen. Poured a light ruby/tan into my pint glass. Smell and taste was slightly hoppy with a nice malt balance. I got that cherry taste which has been mentioned a few times. Mouthfeel was pleasant and had a medium carbonation. Drinkability was easier than one would expect from an India Pale. Nice."
"D/O- For $3.50 a bomber (albeit Euro modified) this is a hard one not to pick up at the store. Sam Smith's=Quality. Never had a bad brew from them."
"D - Pretty tasty and drinkable, just a little off balance bitterness for my taste."
"Nice medium carbonation and good crispness. Very refreshing."
"D: Quite drinkable, wouldn't be a bad session beer."
"A good example of an English IPA, and easy to drink without that huge hop presence and relatively low ABV."
"Great interpretation of the classic English IPA style. Pretty much a textbook balanced beer; one of the better real IPAs I've had to date."
"Drinkability: I finished this one fairly fast and I have to admit, I would not mind having another one. It's quite tasty and very drinkable. A good session beer and it went very well with a meal (burger and fries). An overall solid good beer. It strikes me as a bit different than some English IPAs I've had, and yet I admit that my mind is clouded by the bitterness and hop forward character of American IPAs....so I view this beer as it's own unique character and I quite like it."
"Drinkability: Pleasant enough English IPA that showcases English hops well, but does not have as much depth as I expect from a good Samuel Smith beer."
"drinkability - very light for an ipa, flavorful"
"The feel is thin to medium and has a little bit of oily slickness. This is a great example of the English IPA style in my opinion."
"this isn't the best english IPA out there, but it's a solid example of the style. if only it weren't so carbonated. i feel like my tongue has been scrubbed."
"Buy Again? No."
"D: This one's just too sweet for me overall, without much complexity. I'd have to say it's the weakest link I've tried in an otherwise outstanding lineup from Samuel Smith."
"I'm not as familiar with the English varieties of the IPA, so I'll attribute most of the ""oddities"" to differences in style. With that in mind, I found this beer to be ""good, but not great."" I typically perfer a bit more ""bite"" when I drink this style, but I won't hold this against the beer in my rating. It was definately worth a try, but I will likely stick with conventional/traditional IPAs in the future."
"D - Overall I expected a great tasting and smooth bodied IPA from Samuel Smith and I guess I got it without the bitterness I would expect for an IPA. Definitely one to try if your a hop head to see the more sweeter side of an IPA"
"That one note in the smell keeps in interested. I'm usuall not a fan of malt-heavy PAs & IPAs, but this one comes close to the edge without going over. Enjoyed it, can't say I'd rush ot have another soon."
"Drinkability: This is an easily drinkable beer and one that I'd not mind having again. But that said, I'll probably not be going out of my way to seek this one out as I've learned that for now at least I'm more of a fan of citric American hops and IPA than of the English style. However I do appreciate that this beer for what it is and it seems a nice example of the style for someone who wants to explore this style of IPA."
"This goes down very easy; I could easily drink another this evening. Overall, a very workmanlike beer."
"D- Altough I did enjoy this beer I don't think I could drink more then 3 maybe... no 3 that would be the limit for me, can't wait to review another one of the many styles that Samuel Smith's offers."
"D: I didn't much care for this one. Could have been a bad bottle perhaps, or it's just not for me. Either way I won't be buying this one again. Aftertaste, mouthfeel and overall flavors just weren't agreeable. Definitely not much of an IPA."
"carbonation is rather soft. Body medium, relatively crisp, could be a bit drier. Excellent drinker that I'm always happy to revisit."
"Overall - Quality for the style"
"Notes: I really enjoy trying all of the Samuel Smith beers. While most of them won't blow you off your chair, they will give you a glimpse at traditional British brewing. They are all delicious beers that you can just sit down and drink as much as you want. They are the quintessential ""pub beer""."
"Medium-bodied, smooth, drinkability excellent."
"drinkability: not a fan. would not have again"
"Pours rich copper with a thick white head, lovely spires of lacing, looks fairly carbonated but natural. The aroma is cidery, maybe some pineapple or green apple in there, bit of toasty malt. The flavor has a mild bitterness throughout it with fruity and sappy hops and a bready caramel malt finish. Feel is a bit on the lighter side versus my expectation, though the carbonation is naturally mellow and quite pleasant. Pleasant drinking, though average aroma it has a pleasant flavor that doesn't overpower."
"D: A little too sweet, a little too malt, not really enough hopping. I'm sure this beer follows and much older India brewing tradition, but a tad bit more hope presence would be nice to counterbalance the heavy, sweet malts."
"Crisp, medium-bodied, and dry throughout. Carbonation is about medium and appropriate. All in all, it's a rather enjoyable drink but really a bit mild compared to the IPA's that are being produced by most American and British breweries now. It has a distinctly English feel to it (the mildness and tea infusion) but it's a bit less exciting than I would like."
"Meh. I don't think this beer tastes much like an IPA. There's a fairly good hop presence, but it's mostly in the aftertaste. I like an IPA that hits me right up front, and this one just doesn't do that. The aforementioned aftertaste turns sour after a few moments. Big minus. There's really not much of a mouthfeel...the bottle I bought seems a bit on the watery side. It does have some flavor, and it's not very complex, so this could be a good, drinkable beginner IPA for someone who's only used to drinking mass-produced garbage and is looking to grow up a little."
"D: sort of a staple and respected for its longevity in the English IPA style and I find it alright. Nothing to really holler about or make a fuss...just some good drinking"
"Very good drinkability and a must try history lesson for the American IPA lover."
"I can't get over the metallic flavor...maybe this beer is past it's prime. Not typical Samuel Smith's quality if you ask me. I hope this beer was just light-stuck and I come back to it another time and find it palatable."
"I'm used to drinking American IPA's so its definitely different but I can definitely appreciate the origin and would like to delve into it a little further...will certainly be trying some more of this style"
"Notes: This is an interesting style in a good way of course only the second of this style that I have had very drinkable. Cheers."
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. Somewhat sweet, but not cloyingly so, and bitter without being over the top. A restrained, tasty beer."
"Body was a bit on the light side, carbonation added enough bite to keep it from feeling too watery. The dry finish was about all that kept me reaching for it...."
"Samuel Smith Old Brewery is one of my favorite Breweries. In my opinion, they are a brewery that dont follow trends, and stay on brewing beers with an awesome natural balance. God Save Samuel Smith's Brew Master!"
"d - Not bad at all. There are some strange things going on here and I suspect it may not travel well. Ironic, considering the history of English IPA's."
"All in all, there's probably nearly two handfuls of Samuel Smith beers I'd rather drink. However, I would like to try this mellow enigma of sorts again (preferably a fresh bottle) with revised expectations."
"I haven't had very many IPAs so I don't know too much about them. India Ale pours a dark orange color with little head. It isn't like the few other IPAs I've had. It is slightly thick, and is actually not as bitter as I thought it would be. There is not a lot of flavor with this beer. I love Samuel Smith (maybe my favorite brewery), but I'm not completely sold on the India Ale. I think I might need to give it another try sometime soon."
"D- A solid IPA that drinks about right for the style. Just doesn't jump out at me."
"Smell is a malty aroma balanced with a good dose of noble hop spicy smells. Reminds me of hopped up Pilsner aromas. Tastes as it smells, less hops than an American IPA, seem appropriatte for an English IPA. Medium carbonation with a light body. Not really my style but seems approriatte for an English IPA. I just seem to prefer American hop profiles to these."
"Overall I wish I knew how old this bottle was. It may be a year old and that's why everything has faded. Until SS has bottle dates I will have to stand by this review."
"D- not a thirst quencher- not a beer to end the night on..."
"Realize that, as one who is used to an American IPAs, this needs to be judged on a different scale, but this doesn't really do it for me. This is more like a standard American Pale Ale, and a less-assertive one at that! Obviously well-made and a classic and prefer this MUCH over the PA by Sam Smith, but is not a ""go-to"" for me. Wonder if the distance has taken something away from the beer? Will have to try it on tap as well to see if it improves in that format."
"D – All Sam Smith brews, to my knowledge, are intrinsically drinkable; no exception here."
"Pours a dark copper color with a frothy tan head that doesn't last. Aroma of caramel malt, grass, and sour apples. Taste is fruity and malty, with some bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied with good carbonation. Is also quite dry. Not a very hoppy IPA but this is still enjoyable."
"D: mmm i like uk hops, an excellente IPA without much abv"
"Notes: I am impressed by this India Ale from Samuel Smith."
"this ale is good with spicy food which it states on the label, foods with heave seasoning. a good beer for a lazy sunday."
"D: Very different from the American IPAs I'm used to having. Bitterness is less pronounced, but still the dominant flavor. I'm quite glad I picked this up."
"To be fair, I don't think British ales travel nearly as well as some other country's exports (notably Belgiums) so I would like to try this one on the other side of the Atlantic."
"Pours a clear light orange-brown with a thin light tan head. Smell is of dried fruit. Taste is malty sweet up front with dried fruit flavors imprted from the yeast. The finish is earthy and woody and nicely bitter. Mouthfeel is smooth, low carbonation. Quite drinkable, a very good eipa."
"This is a very easy to drink, well balanced beer. I can see drinking this with just about any meal as it would match well with steak, pasta or fish. Probably wouldn't match well with spicy or saucy foods."
"OVERALL: This is an English IPA, so it's not meant to be a hop bomb like its US bretheren. As it is, this one marks another fantastic offering from Samuel Smith. Great malt profile and well balanced with the hops. If the nose had been a little bolder, this would have turned into a whopper of a brew. A very enjoyable treat, especially on a warm summer's day, and it drank away far too quickly. One I'll definitely have again. Recommended."
"Moderate carbination, with a hoppy dry finish."
"Pours a golden-orange amber with a frothy white head that leaves behind minimal spotty lacing. Aroma is malty with caramel. Taste is likewise malty and caramel, with slight undertones of hops - very gentle bitterness. Mouthfeel is very smooth and almost creamy, with nice moderate carbonation. Immensely drinkable and extremely refreshing. One of my absolute favorite session beers - in no way offensive or challenging...just purely enjoyable."
"Overall, a well balance pale ale. Hop heads, consider yourself warned, this IPA isn't as hoppy as our American versions. However, I actually liked that there were less hops in this beer, especially on the nose. This is a great beer with a meal, because the hops and beer flavor doesn't overpower the food. Great copper color, exceptional mouthfeel. Try this beer."
"YMMV."
"Pours a nice amber color into the glass with a one inch white head that lasts for most of the beer. This is exactly what I think of when I close my eyes and imagine a beer. A beer so attractive it makes you want to drink it. Sweet malts in the nose, something about it reminds me of apple cider. The taste is good, very subtle. Nice malt flavor, light to medium body, decent mouthfeel and drinkability. Nothing mind blowing, just a solid example of a classic style. Worth a try if not for the historic value alone and certainly for those in search of a good session."
"Smell: The smell is very metallic and mild."
"fine color, big white head, slightly creamy texture. feel was medium with a good hop bitterness, a bit agressive if you ask me. if anything the brew seemed a bit too hoppy for the style. feel was a thinner medium with decent carbonation."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability - Honestly pretty drinkable. It is very sweet however the slight hop/bitterness offsets it enough so you don't get stuck with a sweet taste throughout the experience (think DFH 90min). I was just outside in the sun and popped this open when I came inside. Definitely quaffable. Nothing ""great"" compared to other IPA's out there, but a good, easy to drink, sessionable beer. I doubt I will seek this out again, however it was not a bad brew for what it is."
"Drinkability: Great interpretation of a classic IPA, even if it's not bottle conditioned. There is a nice balance between the ingredients, which gives a full flavoursome character. One of the better real IPAs."
"English IPAs are interesting for an American hop head like myself. This beer definitely had the hop character I've grown to expect from IPAs, it was just more subtle and reserved. I have enjoyed this beer and brewery for many years, Sam Smiths is probably my favorite English IPA I've ever had."
"D- High. I don't know what quite to make of this beer... as a hop head it's a marked change of pace from my status quo. It is VERY well-priced and extremely tasty, as well as very drinkable. I enjoyed this beer, and feel like I've discovered a new favorite or a long-lost pal. I will buy more of this, a great session beer and a nice change of pace from the mouth-wreckers that are American IPAs."
"This is a completely different style of IPA than the American style, so if you're looking for a cascade (no pun intended) of citrusy hops, this is not the beer for you. While the taste and the smell are good, this just doesn't drink like an IPA to me. Maybe I've been tainted by Stone and Dogfish Head, but this beer actually has more cidery qualities than I want in an IPA. This is not necessarily a bad thing in general, as the ale doesn't slip into saccharine sweetness. That being said, the dominant aroma here is honey and malts, not hops, and while it has a dry finish, I wouldn't say that I particularly notice an abundance of hops bitterness. Drinkable, but if it's hot out and you're hoping for a powder keg of hops to cool you off, I recommend you stick with an American IPA you know and trust."
"Beautiful golden bronze body with a large off-white head. Malty, buttery, estery, fruity aroma. Butterscotch, caramel malt and a light, floral, grassy hop finish. Creamy, smooth, pretty tasty. Nothing like the popular modern American IPA. Not all that bitter, but the hop flavor that is present is quite good. Love the butterscotchy malt."
"Only 5% abv so you can enjoy a pint and keep your wits reasonably well. It doesn't lack in flavour and it's quite refreshing. If only it had a little more body."
"Decent IPA, but there are many better (Centennial from Founders and Lagunitas IPAs for starters)."
"Very drinkable and tasty. Another well made Sam Smith brew. What else is new?"
"D: My first review, and first attempt at a ""real"" IPA. I am not a hop head so I found this to be balanced and quite drinkable. It would make a good session beer. I had this beer paired with a beef meatloaf that had rosemary and mushrooms. Not a perfect match but the bitterness in the beer played well with the sweet glaze on top of the meatloaf, and it cleansed the palate."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice session beer with a lot of flavor and substance that makes it worth drinking for a long time."
"The mouth is crisp, but coats the mouth still, which is different for an IPA. Decent flavor on this one. Caramel malts mix with some sour grassy hops. This is pretty basic and bland IMO. Not a lot of complexity. Just a simple good beer. Try it."
"D = As I said above, this is one of my favorite IPAs and I find it goes down so easily while having enough of a dry effect to make you want another sip, that this just screams drinkable to me."
"All in all a solid beer, but a little bit of a letdown for Samuel Smith. These guys probably don't know how to make a bad beer, but I guess not every one will be world class."
"This beer retains a certain balance which I like to think was typical of the original India Ale style. It is smooth and extremely drinkable; a true session beer. This being said, it is considerably less interesting than many of its American (and increasingly, British) cousins."
"D - Pretty good, while not a typical IPA by any standards. Hop presence as we Americans know it is pretty absent. The balance is well done though."
"D: Drinkability - This is a nice easy drinker - would definitly move on to another. love the dry hoppy follow up!"
"Drinkability is nice, it's refreshing, interesting, and delicious."
"Drinkability- Good but not my first choice in IPAs"
"The slight over-boozyness makes it a little less apealling to drink alot of or on a regualar basis but still a very solid beer."
"Drinkability- It was very good. I loved it as I sally do with Samuel Smith's."
"Pours a clear, orange / copper color. 3/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of pale malt, dry hops, slight grain, slight alcohol, and some citrus. Fits the category of an English IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes of dry hops, sweet malt, pale malt, slight grain, slight citrus. Overall, this fits the category quite nicely, with the pale hops, good malt background, and noticeable alcohol. I'd recommend this brew."
"This beer pours a golden orange hue with really nice carbonation which leaves a frothy two finger head with decent lacing,it has really big aromas of pure hops and lots of them a real fruity hop smell,it has an above average mouthfeel with a real citrus hop taste about it that is perfectly balanced out by the malty finish which makes this beer not as bitter as i would expect for a IPA but once again ive got nothing but good things to say about Samuel Smiths."
"Dr. Pretty good. I could do more than one."
"This pour from a 550ml brown bottle is a hazy amber with a white head with little retention. Can't find any freshness info on the bottle. The smell is sweet and malty with notes of grain and grass. The hop nose is pretty understated. The flavors are very malty with notes of the aforementioned grass and grain. The hop flavors are weak and the finish is bland to average with regard to the hoppiness. The body is okay tending towards syrupy and leaving an unpleasant film on the pallet. If I were to select a Euro Bitter or India style ale this would not be one of my top choices."
"A very nice medium mouthfeel. Perfectly sessionable ale, but perhaps leans a little too much to the Best Bitter category than IPA."
"Drinkability: Focus is defiantly on the malt rather then hops. The malt in this case tasted a bit musty and wooden to me. This would deter me slightly from having multiples. I suppose this is a more traditional English IPA then the modern ""hophead"" craft IPAs. Still I feel it lacks a lot of flavor and excitement that the modern american IPAS have. A decent pale ale but at the end of the day lacks excitement and flavor."
"550ml bottle served in a nonic. Poured a translucent copper with a one inch, frothy off-white head that eventually settled into a solid, quarter inch skim; some lacing, but weak legs. Nose suggests caramel malts with a subdued hops character. Taste follows nose, but malt overtakes the hops, with a residual aftertaste (a little skunky, but not in a bad way). Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied with a consistent background carbonation - very pleasant. Liked it, but didn't love it. This style is relatively new to me, but I wasn't blown away. Still not a bad offering."
"D - i like this beer as i do many SS offerings. will purchase when available again!"
"This is a solid brew. Smooth with an interesting bite in the middle and then back to smooth. A fine beer and a good example of English IPA's."
"Drinkability: An overall decent sipping beer; unique"
"Dark copper color with some rising prickle that is very small. There is almost no head, just a touch of wispy lacing. I love the smell! The nose is sweet almost in a hard candy type of way. The smell reminds of ribbon candy that my grandmother used to buy me when I was a kid. The attack is smooth and easy with the hops casually presentint itself in the flavor. The beer dries in the mouth as it finishes. There is a somewhat bitter aftertaste. My wife says that it reminds her/tastes like school lunch. She also says that it is like beef stew. Not exactly ringing endorsements, but at least she didn't say it was bad. Its worth drinking for sure, but man, that nose steals the show."
"Overall a very drinkable English style IPA. As expected, flavor is balanced and dry, with subtle character."
"D - A pretty drinkable offering overall, not quite my style, but solid overall. One I might return to if I'm feeling the more mellow hopped english IPA in the future."
"Another winner from the brew-masters at Samuel Smiths. This one poured a orange amber color a bit cloudy. Smell was strongly of fresh oranges. Taste was equally orangeish. The beer was smooth with crisp finish. Very easy to drink, an exceptional pale ale."
"A nice copper color body with a full fluffy off white head, medium carbonation, some slight lacing.Aroma of apple,yeast and bread dough . Flavor is fruity, yeasty, some apple,lemon,light caramel,biscut and floral hops , This IPA has a flavor all it's own,a little different but good, a long crisp spicy hop finish,smooth mouthfeel, very sessionable and a fun try."
"drinkability was good and very refreshing"
"Pours a clear amber color with one inch of white head. The head does not hang around very long as it settles to just a thin layer of fine bubbles. Very little lacing is left on the glass. A surprising aroma from the hops. Has a sweet citrus aroma more at home in American IPAs than English ones. Has some subtle floral aroma along with some malt notes. Less citrus and more floral and earthy in the flavor from the hops. Solid biscuit malt flavor gives a solid fondation. Finishes with a subtle sweet citrus flavor. Bitterness is on the low side. The body is nothing special. In fact it feels thin but the carbonation is gentle and lends a good texture. Easy to drink this one. I was a bit surprised by the hop profile, especially in the aroma. Nicely balanced."
"A very well balanced, and understated, in that English way, Ur-IPA. Pleasant to quaff, where the flavour dominates over the bitterness, so this would be good for at least a few raucous pub rounds, I have to imagine."
"Medium body, medium carbonation, perhaps a bit too much. Nice and slick mouthfeel from the hoppage, very nice. I could drink quite a few of these, not bad at all."
"Pours an appetizing clear amber with a fairly thick but not persistent head. Aroma is strong and surprisingly fruity, more like a cider than an IPA though there is a hint of the evergreen aroma I associate with a good IPA. Flavor is fairly hoppy but not too bitter, somewhat fruity and a bit wan. Texture is fairly smooth and just a little fizzy, and it leaves a fairly hoppy aftertaste. Not the best I have had, but worthy of a try."
"D - love this beer's balance, a nice malty backbone w/ enough english hops to add a bit of muscle. Finishes smooth and not overly bitter at all, no strange aftertastes either. *hop heads beware, this is NOT an american IPA, English styles to me seem to be milder in every sense, and this is no exception."
"Easily drinkable due to the relatively decent flavor and abv. Not too rich or bitter so it won't destroy your palate. A nice beer I'll probably have again sometime soon."
"Drinkable, just not as hoppy of a beer as expected."
"This beer is very drinkable and light on the palate. You could drink this in any tasting with about any style and not be far from the mark in flavor. This is a cross between pale ale and india pale ale. It truly is an English IPA. Enjoy!"
"While I personally prefer the bitter, hop heavy, gut-punch APAs, this is a good example of the style and has a lot of character to it. I came to Sam Smith brews by way of their Imperial Stout, but I have never seen a mediocre brew come from them and I've learned to rely upon them, namely, as the ""reliable"" beer I get when I'm grabbing one or two new brews that are unknown quantities."
"Nikki"
"Easy to drink, sot sure if i would consider it a session beer, but something i needed to try nonetheless."
"Pours a golden amber, finger of pure white head. Smells semi-sweet with a bit of citrus in there. Not amazing, but a solid nose that is nice. The taste is well balanced, nice malt with bread and caramel completes the hop citrus. Works very very well. I enjoyed this as a beer, but is underpowered in the hop arena compared to american IPA's."
"I enjoyed the beer and I'm glad I tried it but I don't think I'll spend money on another one."
"When the beer was poured into a pint glass, it displayed a clear, amber color with an orange hue. Minimal lacing was present and the head dissipated quickly. The aroma had a soft hoppiness balanced by a sweet barley base. Slight fruit esters were present in the aroma as well. The flavor was a firm hoppiness, mainly earthy and piney. There was a solid malt backbone to the beer which rounded out the bitterness. The finish was sweet and hoppy. The yeast flavor was generally clean and smooth. Generally, I would consider this an ""assertive"" beer, but with the skill of the brewers displayed in the beers balance, it is a very easy drinking brew."
"D: not bad but not something i'd make a habit of coming back to"
"D - The classic English India Ale."
"a quite elegant, authentic IPA from the UK...malts are certainly sharing the stage (and more) with the british hops i assume are involved. very balanced, solid (though not extreme in the least!)...very refreshing. mouthfeel doesn't stand out as anything specific...smooth, low carbonation...simply easily drinkable...i can catch the hops finally doing a delayed, bitter dance from the edge of the stage. quite fine on it's own, but this would go quite well with rich indian fare, thai food, a philly grinder...!"
"D - I'm a big fan of this brewery. Everything that I have tried so far has been spot-on and true to the style. I can only assume that this is true to the original style of British India Ales; however, flavorwise, I prefer some other American versions. It is obviously well crafted and worth a try; you might like it."
"Clean light malt flavour, pleasantly weighted, with a mild bitter hoppy aftertaste towards the end of the glass, leaving you looking for more."
"I enjoy the side notes of this beer, but the flavor is underwhelming. its lack of punch makes it a decent swig, but slightly deflated."
"Overall- Can't get truer to style with Sam Smith's."
"Taste was not what I was expected after having American style IPA's. First the hops doesn't kick you in the teeth, the is more balance to this beer. You get a lot of malty flavor to this, the hops don't overpower everything. Smooth going down, this is a good beer and easily drinkable as its hopped closer to many pale ales I've had."
"Great tasting session beer here. Pours a craggy white head, with some retention. Nice crisp malty nose with a backdrop of hops. Crystal like smoothness on the palate. Buscuity malts with some nice english hops. Overly expensive for what it is. There are better american ipas out there, but this is a classic that should be tried. Very smooth and clean mouthfeel. It is enjoyable and if the price were reasonable, I would buy this routinely."
"It may be a bit of a letdown for some hop fans, but the very English characteristics of this Sam Smith's brew are what make it appealing. Not as pungent or hoppy as I would have liked, but I did wind up with a fairly satisfying ale. Would be a good choice on draft, if applicable ever."
"D- Pleasant tasting and highly drinkable, just underwhelming for an IPA. I would expect the hops to be more pronounced. This seems more of a solid pale ale."
"M&D- Hard water and a smooth body makes for gentle, easy drinking"
"D: This is a good beer from Sam Smith's. The problem is finding a fresh bottle, it is really hit or miss with me. When it's on, it's a great English pint."
"Overall an enjoyable brew, and a fair representation of the style. English IPAs really get shit on over here because many people review them as though they are american IPAs and should be full of citrus and pine. This is defenitely a great session brew for those looking for more than a bitter, but less than an american hop bomb. Would be very interested to try this one on cask."
"Drinkability- Great tasting beer, not sure wether it's an IPA or not, but very drinkable and recommended...just don't think you are getting an English hopfest."
"D: well balanced supremely enjoyable. 4.0"
"-a fine ale with a spicy dish"
"D - A good English IPA, not my absolute favorite, but something I would drink again"
"Good vibrancy in the red-amber color, while clear still captures the eye, the large, frothy head a good two plus fingers deep and takes its damn time dissolving. Sweet malts and roasted caramel, there's a kind of basement dampness to it, like undisturbed natural growth blossoming, well water minerality and hardness, hops and a grassiness emerge only after it warms appreciably, doesn't lack persistence per se, more so can't get its ducks in a row. Medium-bodied, buoyed by broad carbonation, floats in the mouth as much as hugs the tongue. Less of the caramel, malt sweetness here and more of the hoppy bitter, herbal bite, let's the bread, nut, yeast flavors fall in the middle and then have to pick a side. Not hard to drink at all but needs a bandleader to decisively set the direction."
"A potent and powerful reminder of where it all came from. A rather tasty IPA for sure, although I can think of many better (all that come to mind come from the U.S....or Denmark!)."
"A good representation of the english style, and while underwhelming, easy drinking."
"Good beer. Not spectacular, but good."
"Quite different from an American IPA and not nearly as bitter. The taste does grow on you after the initial shock of what one typically expects from an IPA. I could really see myself enjoying a fresh imperial pint of this in a British pub."
"Poured from a 550ml bottle into a pint glass. Poured a clear amber color with a big off white head that disappeared fairly quickly. Smells of faint malt and hops. Taste is not what i expected, hop flavor is very faint compared to the American IPA's, but this is a very smooth easy to drink beer nonetheless. This was my first time drinking an English IPA, it's not quite what I had expected but it was still a good beer, but I definitely prefer the American style more."
"Drinkability: Carbonation might end up killing this one for me. Not too heavy, decent flavor, but I don't think I'd want another (550mL) after this one."
"This is probably more in line with what IPA's should be, but we've all been so used to American IPA's that this beer probably falls through the cracks a bit. This may not be the best English IPA out there, but it is definitely worth a try."
"taste is crisp, smooth, caramel, citrus, grass, well balanced hops and malt, not too bitter yet more bitter on the back end, leaves the mouth slightly dry."
"I enjoyed it a lot."
"Moderate mouthfeel but decent carbonation. Overall, you can drink alot of these, but you can do alot better. Just missing something here. Worth a try, but won't be a favorite."
"It's crisp and refreshing, and not at all unpleasant to drink. Too bad it's nothing like an IPA"
"Not too drinkable."
"Extremely disappointed by this beer. Pours clear yellow with a foamy white head. Nose is weak, very weak. Mostly goldings and pale malt/bread aroma with mineral water. Watery, shify mouthfeel. Pale/golden ale flavor with mor malt than anything else. I didn't look at the ingredients, but I'll bet ""hops"" is nowhere on the list. Tastes more like a Pale Ale that was poured into a dirty glass that may have contained an IPA at some point. Charlatan!"
"Pours light bronze with a thin head. Smells incredibly bittersweet and malty with only a hint of hops, strange for a beer called an IPA. Bitter maltiness dominates the first sip. Lots of caramel in there also. Very sweet malts here, definitely not an IPA as it lacks any hop punch whatsoever. Really impressive mouthfeel with carbonation that really makes it finish well. Very dry as well. Very dry. Samuel Smith doesn't disappoint and once again delivers with a super quality beer for the price despite being misnamed- this is an ESB through and through."
"The beer is a deep amber copper color with carbonation. Very little head with the pour. The smell has a hint of hops, molasses, toasted malts. the taste is malty, a hint of soap a bit bitter and hint of pine and floral. Smooth mouthfeel, acidic finish that is lasting"
"Beautiful light honey brown color. Nice thin head some lacing. Nice sweet flowery aroma. Not what I had expected but pleasant. Super smooth flavor for an IPA not real hoppy no strong bite. More a strong fruity flavor. Very nice texture and very drinkable. Looking to try this one again."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - I could only put away about 3-4 of these before the bitterness begins to be a little much. I would of appreciated more lingering hop bitterness, and more of a roasted character. This is a decent IPA though, I definitely think you should try it. All in all though its very good, and I would enjoy it from time to time. Cheers!"
"The taste is similar, very juicy with citrus (mostly orange with a little lemon), dry leaves (especially in the finish), a lot of light fruit, hint of toffee, a zesty yeatiness, and a light element of bread dough. It has a lot of hoppy and yeasty flavour, but the hop bitterness is restrained to the poitn of just dominating the light sweetness, giving a lightly bitter finish. It's highly quenching, with a juicy-yeasty tarness similar to other English IPAs (like Ridgeway) and exceedingly drinkable."
"D: Lacks the punch I expected. I'm rather underwhelmed."
"big fan of the samuel smith stouts, so thought id give this beer a try, bought a single of it. found this ipa to be much like most english ipas ive countered much more balanced with the hops and malt, unlike some of the hop strong americans ive been used to. pours to a clear reddish amber, with a nice head but not overly thick. smells much more of malt than of hops, barley able to get any real strong fruity, herbal, hop smells. taste is a nice blend of malts and hops, but not what i really enjoy when having an ipa which is the powerful hops as well as complicated character that so often comes with them. find this ale to be pretty simple on the palate not coming up with too many suprises. with that being said, it's still a quality ale thats enjoyable. i found it to have more characteristics of the typical pub ale than that of an ipa. definite good ale for someone who enjoys more mellow and casual ales as well as people who found some ipas overpowering with hops and bitterness. this leaves the palate with a sweet caramel tastes."
"Feel diminishes as the carbonation takes a vacation. Malts and hops combine to yield a light oily finish. Hmmmm!"
"It's been a long time in between bottles, and now I remember why. This Ale is probably what the original tasted like before the super hop craze which in itself is interesting. With a blind glass I would of thought this to be an English Pale Ale, heavy on malt, and very light on the hops. Pours nice, no hop nose, but pleasant enough. For an IPA where's the hops? Definitely too malty for this style for my taste, but obviously very drinkable. But if I want the APA style I'll look for a Sierra Nevada brew."
"D - Very smooth easy to drink. Expensive but could be a great session beer. I wanted to try an English IPA after having immersed myself in West Coast IPAs for so long. I was glad I did I'm still grateful that the west coasters took the English IPA to new levels."
"D: All in all, I'd say this is an average beer. I could drink this in the same way as I'd drink a Budweiser though. It's nice to drink casually and wouldn't be bad with a meal."
"subdued hops that poke around and leave a pleasantly dry backbite. I enjoyed this beer alot, but I am not sure where the ""India"" comes in - more like a Pale Ale or even just a light Ale. Still, I recommend this for consumption if one hasn't had it before."
"This is not a beer I will try again."
"The off-taste at first definitely hindered my enjoyment of this at first but it recovered with time to reveal a solid, old-school, sessionable effort. Not something I'd reach for every day since if I want a full feeling I'd prefer much fuller flavor profiles, but a solid offering."
"I've yet to drink a Sam Smith beer I didn't like. A classic delicious English IPA."
"The aroma is a bit of cracked and husky grain, plenty of butterscotch diacetyl and sweet malts, and bit of old world hops. The taste has all these characteristics, but the butterscotch diacetyl is just too much for my tastes, and I think this may be a product of freshness, or lack thereof. There is a traditional hoppy character to the beer, some herbal tea like hops, but also traditionally balanced and slightly bittering in all the right spots. The caramel and butterscotch are the downers in this beer. It is modestly carbonated, and the finish and aftertaste are just compromised by the butterscotch notes. The creaminess is a plus."
"Taste: Barely there hop flavor. Once again this is not what I thought I would get but it's a very smooth drinkable and tasty brew."
"Nice peak into the past to see what the style originated from and tasted like at its inception. Very nice beer."
"D- Very drinkable. Not my favorite IPA in the world or my favorite selection from Samuel Smith but it provides a nice contrast to the American IPA's. Solid."
"This one is mild and relaxed."
"Pours a nice ruddy straw color, not much of a head but what there is lingers and laces down the glass. Smell is biscuit and stone with a hint of dandelion. Taste is a big hit of bready malt, passing through notes of greens (collard?) right into a sharp, lingering, metallic bitterness. It takes a few sips, but my palate gets used to the contrasts and my mouth waters for more. It's hard to imagine a beer that'd be easier to drink. Why can't more American brewers make classic, quaffable beers like this one?"
"550 ml bottle from Farm Fresh, Hampton, VA"
"D: I may try this again if I see a freshness date."
"Tastes just like it smells, perfectly balanced and wonderfully bold. Big, dry syrupy bread malt is sticky and tasty against a strongly bitter and lightly spicy european hop blend. The balance is nothing short of incredible--this beer packs a gigantic amount of flavor into a small amount of ABV."
"I was expecting a little more hop character out of this one, but still an overall good mouth feel and a nice maltiness . Very good taste, but I would have guessed a pale ale in a blind taste test not an IPA. Despite that I will be partaking in this brew again."
"Pours a copper-orange color with a fairly thick head and a nice amount of lacing. The aroma is weak with some sweetness and hops. Very easy drinking but the flavor was lacking a little. Roasted malty flavor with some hops but a rather different tasting IPA. As the beer warms this burned malt flavor is even more evident. Good beer but not enough of a hop profile for an IPA."
"Conclusion: one large bad batch or this is a very poor version of beer."
"Nice half-inch of head on this honey colored brew but it fades quickly with little lacing. Lots of hops on the nose. Dry and hoppy with a long malt-toned finish. A little nutty and toasty with a semi-sweet character. Medium bodied with a nice mouthfeel. Smooth going down. Pretty good in general."
"The hops were there, but they didn't provide any exciting flavors, just a dull bitterness. In fact, the bitterness nearly took over the entire beer."
"As with most Sam Smith's I've tried it is pretty good but not great. I would get bored with the flavor profile after a couple but worth picking up and trying once."
"D= Not a bad ale, but still this was a disappointing brew. By American standards, not terribly different from the Sam Smith pale ale."
"D: This drinks well, just don't expect the grapefruit or apricot flavors you usually get with IPAs. The replacement of those with a rich roasted malt isn't bad at all. This is a good beer. It goes down easy, and keeps you coming back for more."
"Pours a light orange color with nice dark white head, decent lacing. Nicely balanced and a touch bitter, very nice IPA, not as hoppy as you'd expect. The bitterness gives it some solid character and the hop taste is complex and not definable to a single hop variety to me. Very drinkable. All around an excellent beer."
"On a side note I'd love to try this fresh. It still has a fair bit of hop flavour but undoubtedly some of it is lost during the long transport."
"Amber pour with an off-white head which laces well. Sweet caramel aroma with some grassiness. Good balance between the earthy mineral qualities of the water, bready malts, and fragrant bitterness of the hops. I found the mineral qualities to be very pronounced in the aftertaste. The smooth mouthfeel is definitely a highlight, and the carbonation punches the flavour up a notch. Highly quaffable."
"Mouth feel is medium in body and yet I don't find it overly drinkable due to the strong mineral sensation I get."
"D - I feel that this is a pretty sessionable beer: low abv and crisp flavors. Really did love the nose too."
"D- A very easy beer to drink. Not as hoppy as an American IPA abut just enough hops to give a bitter flavor that leaves me wanting a little more. I could put back a few of these in a PUB!"
"Pours a clean orange-ish/ copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, small hops and something like gingerbread like malt. In the taste, small hops, and a gingerbread like sweet maltiness. A small bite, yet mainly smooth, medium mouthfeel, and a semi-dry maltiness in the aftertaste. Good for an English IPA, but nothing too exciting."
"Altogether, not bad. But, not a brew that I would rank with my favorite IPAs either."
"MF&D - Extremely creamy taste for a meduim bodied IPA. Tasted more like a English Ale or even a Bitter than an IPA, but still very tasty. I would definitely recommend this. IMO it would make quite a good session ale."
" ~ This is an interesting brew, no doubt about it. If I were ever lucky enough to travel to Europe I'd like to try a pint from draught."
"I've liked all of the Samuel Smith brews that I've tried in the past, so I was excited to give this one a shot. Pour was a somewhat thin, burnt orange with a white head that disappeared quickly. Nose was far different than an American IPA with a very mild scent of flower aromas and soft malt. Taste was pretty soft on the palate with little in the way of bitterness, again not what I look for in an IPA. Easy to drink fast however, so I guess it would make a nice session brew. Overall I guess i'll just chalk this one up to being a ""classic"" IPA, I think the style has basically moved on to bigger and better things."
"Bought the 550 ml bottle. Great appearance: bright amber look, creamy lacing and thick, long lasting head. Floral-like aromas of spices, hops and malts. The taste has a good sweetness to it; not very bitter or overpowering. Good mouthfeel gives it a great carbonation and body. Overall, pretty darn good IPA."
"D: Highly drinkable, I become more and more of a fan of the English IPA as I have them. They are definitely less complex than the American IPA but I feel that for the most part they are more drinkable. Will be having this beer again."
"D: The more I drink, the more I want. This passes the ultimate test. I have to say that the beer isn't overly impressive but I'd love to add it a session beer."
"The beer pours a nice crisp burnt orange with a nice frothy lasting head that leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is sweet malt and floral hops. The taste is earthy hops just slightly overpowering the sweet malt for a nice IPA balance. The beer is light and crisp with a slight bitter finish. This is a great truebred original IPA, quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Not a bad lil' English ale."
"D - I've been having a lot of American IPAs lately, and this is a completely different experience. This one is hugely malty, but avoids being heavy, with balancing hops, but not pungently citric or piney. I dare say, this is much more nuanced and complex than most AIPAs."
"Drinkability - More a pale ale than an ipa. A great brewery, but a sub par offering. Nothing grabbed me about this beer at all."
"Samuel Smith's India Ale pours a slightly hazy light gold/orange color. A nice, fluffy off-white head sits on the top. A lot of caramel notes and grassiness show up on the nose. A bit of sweet malt flavor quickly leads to a very mild bitterness. The mouthfeel seems a bit watery. Not a bad beer, but nothing great."
"D: Okay, drinkable, but one is fine for me."
"D: This is a quaffable session IPA. Excellent taste, relatively low ABV, and refreshing feel."
"Smooth and light in the mouth. In no way heavy on the taste buds or in the tummy. Nice carbonation with a clean finish."
"Poured a decent hazy amber-honey color. Not much in the way of a head, but a good film and nice lacing. Smell is is sweet and slightly hoppy. Wish there was more of a hop bitterness for an IPA. I know the English use far less hops in there IPAs but this one seems to be missing that good bitterness that would really balance the sweetness of the malts in this beer. Overall, an average drink. I would suggest Meantime EIPA rather than this one."
"D: very good IPA, not the best by far, but a solid example, I keep expecting and recieving great beers from Samuel SMith"
"All in all, great beer."
"drank from a samuel smiths pint glass i got in the 3-pack of bombers + pint glass + coasters ;D (this beer was not from the sampler... those were all delicious though)"
"I hope I rated this right; it was a good beer but didn't taste much like an IPA to me. This was a very balanced and well-constructed brew, but the hops didn't shine through like I expected. A great beer, but not necessarily a great representation of an IPA."
"This was a very good IPA but not as superior as I expected from Samuel Smith. Poured a new penny copper color, shiney and bubbley. Nose has a pleasent, subdued floral hop aroma. Taste of slight fruity, flowery hops. A little fizzy on the tongue but certainly quaffable."
"D - Pleasant and drinkable with a nice malt character. Unfortunately the hop character is just too weak to make this a good english IPA."
"Nice, this is a refined and an average abv% IPA that holds its own. Not quite up to go head to head with any American hop monsters, yet a beautifully balanced IPA that doesn't have to go to extremes to show what quality is all about. Session brew heaven!"
"The smell is a balanced hop and malt profile. In the mouth it has that distinct Sam Smith water flavor. I have found their ale to have a unique taste especially on the ale side. In the mouth it doesn't have much of an appearance. It is light and fairly carbonated. It seems a little weak and lacking in the hop profile for an IPA. It definitely has a strong malt profile in the taste than I am used to. Overall I am a fan of Samuel Smith Old Brewery and you should try this one as well."
"Like all good English IPA's this has a great balance of hops and malt. I am not sure if I described the taste and smell accurately, or if I even like it. Though I can't bring myself to give this a bad score. However, this is something that I will revisit, and would recommend for people to try for themselves."
"Poured from 16.9oz. bottle into a pint glass. Burnt orange color, with a big head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is very fruity with only a touch of floral hops underneath. Tastes exactly like it smells, fruit first with a slight hop bitterness underneath. As it warms up, the bitterness and some alcohol comes out. Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but fairly lively. This is my first English IPA and it's entirely different from American IPAs. My preference lies with the latter, although the former is dangerously easy to drink."
"This is a great beer. I really like the taste and wish that I had bought more than 1 as a sample. I highly recommend and this has become my favorite English IPA."
"Overall, this is a solid beer. It didn't blow me away by any means, but was certainly a well made beer."
"Not a beer that brings everything together incredibly, but a few components really stand out."
"Thicker mouthfeel than most IPAs, not as crisp, but very drinkable. I could definitely drink these all night."
"D- very drinkable, and very interesting to compare to the american style."
"D - Great brew very drinkable."
"D: moderate as it was a tad disappointing hop wise, but an ok session ipa that doesnt thrill."
"Overall, pretty drinkable but not amazing."
"Big benchmark of the EIPA style.. Everytime I brew an English IPA, this is one that I buy to inspire me."
"The balance here makes this an exceptionally drinkable beer. This pint won't last."
"Light translucent amber with a medium offwhite head. Mild malt sweetness with a light touch of hops. I was thinking this tasted like a hopped ESB, and just now realize it actually is an ESB, and not an IPA. Caramelly malt flavor, with an almost butterscotchy finish, with some light hops and mild bitterness as well. This is a good all around beer that feels light, and has a good amount of flavor."
"Poured a nice copper. The smell is lighter than your typical American IPA,but you can still detect some hops that are a bit citrusy. The taste has some hop bitterness,but it also has almost a brown ale final. There is a creamy nuttiness to this beer."
"Drinkabiltiy: The strong tea twang taste in this beer make it tough for me to want to have a second. Maybe a bad or old bottle, but after reading other reviews I don't think that to be the case."
"hmm... will need to try more ""genuine"" english IPA's, but from what i'm getting here, things are too tame across the pond..."
" Drinkability; If you like a slightly sweet IPA this is a great one. The sweetness here is not achieved by malt or yeast, however, it's from the golding assault they give this stuff. Yeeehaw!"
"Drinkability: above average but not my favorite"
"Pours a nice light copper with a ver nice head and good lacing. Has a nice sweet scent, not really hoppy, more malty, but very nice and floral. Very good taste, it has a nice headiness with a slight hoppy taste, but an excellent hoppy aftertaste that stays on the tongue. Excellent mouth feel, it goes down very smooth. If it wasn't one of the higher priced IPAs in my area, I'd would be happy to drink it quite often, but it's not better than easy to find American PAs that are just as easy to find and less expensive."
"All in all, I find this to be a very nice example of an english IPA. Maybe not the best beer for the huge hop heads looking for a fix, but a really nicely balanced beer. I would definitely buy this again."
"D - I had high expectations for this IPA it wasn't as strong as I was expecting but its still a good IPA worth a try"
"Apperance was nice on this one. Color goes from a harvest orange to a light orange / yellow. Head lasts about a minute and was thick. The smell was a little malty smelling. Not bad at all, just wanted more hops in the smel and taste. Taste was malty mouthfeel was a medium carbonation, but average to thin. The drinkability is ok, but i thought it might have been a little better becuase of how people talk about it. This beer was average to maybe a little less."
"After sampling their Oatmeal Stout, I had taken a strong liking to Samuel Smith, unfortunately, however, their India Ale was a let-down the best thing about this beer was its appearance  a nice golden-amber color with an impressive frothy headSmell was about average, although somewhat bland and non-descript taste didnt seem like your regular India pale ale more tweaked and somewhat medicinal wasnt too crazy about it drinkable was sub-par wouldnt want to down too many of these in a single setting copped a single 12oz bottle from wine and more for about $2.50 Taste was somewhat peculiar for this style slightly citrusy and bready with no distinct hoppiness Not recommended"
"Has a slight citrus taste with the hops not being overwhelming, hardly a bitter aftertaste, makes for a very smooth IPA although not quite what I usually want from an IPA either."
"Some bitter orange, cherry, and hop dryness with alcohol. It is not overly strong in taste, but the smoothness of it, and the moderate mouthfeel make this a winner."
"D - I would use this as a session beer for sure."
"BLUF-A very smooth, nice beer to drink on a nice cold Kansas night. It poured a apple-cider color into a pint glass. 2 fingers of head pop up. Beautiful. You can smell sweet malts and a hint of lemony hops. It's not a knock you over your head hops. I like this taste. Extremely well balanced. Smooth piney hops start out the journey followed by some sweet caramel malts. Throughout the experience, hops tickle the tongue. It has a medium mouthfeel that is well carbonated for the experience. This is a highly drinkable ale for any occasion. I would gladly buy this ale again."
"Given the notable but not overwhelming hop presence, I consider this an exceptionally drinkable IPA and one more reason, the more I drink them, British exports are quickly becoming my #1 choice in beer."
"If you're looking for a heavily hopped IPA, this isn't it. It's much more on the smooth, mild side, yet still tasty and smooth. Not my favorite from Samuel Smith, yet this still impresses. A fine IPA."
"Beer drinks really smooth, but this isn't anything super impressive, but not a bad beer either."
"D-It is a easy drinking beer that could easily become a session.It is a great examle of a English IPA."
"Overall this was pretty decent but I have had better. For some reason I am just not that impresssed with what comes out of this brewery. Gonna have to try some of the organics to see if it changes my mind,"
"Poured a dark amber. Nice head about 1/2 inch thick. Smell isn't too powerful, but hints of hops and maybe pear/banana. Carbonation is mild. Hops aren't as prominent as other IPAs I've had, but it goes well with the overall character. Has a slight oak/fruit taste. Alcohol is well hidden in the tastes. Overall, not bad -- but not the best. I'll probably try something else next time."
"I do enjoy Samual Smiths other beers, I was less impressed with this beer overall, I think I was expecting a little more from an IPA, definately not one of my favorites as far as it goes, but it was a good drink. Ate a beef fondue while drinking this beer, seemed to go alright with it."
"Pours an amber/pale color with a two finger head. Aroma is subtle and malty upfront with little if any hops showing through. Taste is much like an English IPA, nice and subtle with more maltiness than hops. There is a small but lingering bitterness at the back of the throat but not much else. Very drinkable and simple."
"d - very good, interesting IPA considering what i'm used to."
"Pours clear gold with a medium head that leaves nice lacing on the sides and surface. Aroma is herbal and light citrus hops. Taste has a nice hop character. Herbal, spicy and a bit citrusy- a hint of lemon. Significant and fairly complex malt character which really sets this beer apart. Balanced for an IPA. Crisp and smooth. Medium bodied. Very drinkable. Really good IPA."
"Pours dark honey with thin white head that leaves minimal lace. The aroma is sweet malt with light hops, slightly stale barroom, and a hint of nuts. The initial flavor is sweet malt with a hint of hop bitterness. The aftertaste is moderately bitter and slightly sour, average lived. The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with a dry texture and lively carbonation and astringetn finish. Overall, this was a little sweet but relatively good malt and hop balance."
"This is a very drinkable brew. Not as over-the-top on hops as a lot of American IPAs. No pine scents to this one. I think I prefer this to the hopped up Yankee brews, and I should make a point of having English style IPA more often."
"D - A super complex brew that is pretty damn drinkable too. The appearance and especially the nose are superior to the flavor and mouthfeel, but this is a classic that you've just gotta try just for the paradigm example of an English IPA."
"One last note--I've noticed other reviewers comparing this beer to American style IPA. This is an unfair comparison, because the characteristics of the English and American style are very different, with American being more balanced toward the hoppy side along with bigger, more citrusy and resiny flavors, reflecting American hops. I prefer the AIPA myself but I did find this to be a refreshing change from those."
"Poured into a glass and noticed a thin head that dissapeared quickly.The color was a nice orange with another color to give it more of a pink-orange color. The smell was fruity not too overwhelming. The taste was smooth not bitter at all unlike other IPA's I have tried. I would probably try this one again."
"Good offering overall and would drink again."
"The big comparison here in my mind is to Brooklyn Brewery's EIPA and I don't think I could call either a better beer. The Brooklyn is simply better. Either way, these two beers make up the best EIPAs I've ever had. You should try them too."
"It's thicker than it looks. Has a dry, nutty quality. It actually feels thick like apple juice. It's not a mouthwaterer, to be sure. It's a sweet, nutty brown drink. Far from an IPA. Just okay."
"I'm going to pour myself a Hop Devil, and thank God I'm an American."
"Not bad, but this great brewery's IPA is too wimpy for me."
"Pours a clear, solid gold color with a nice frothy head on top. Faint but well balanced aromas of fruity, earthy hop oils and a bit of caramel. At first, the flavor seems rather mellow...after a few gulps the oily hoppy bitterness comes out. Leafy, flowery hops and a pleasant malty sweetness. Low on carbonation and medium bodied. I like it..."
"Mouthfeel is wonderfully full, smooth and creamy. Perfect carbonation, it doesn't feel flat, but nowhere near fizzy. This is a good beer. I'm enjoying it on a lot of levels. I'll definitely have this one again. I'll have to check out more British IPAs, as well. I'm a fan of what I've tried so far from Samuel Smith. Well done."
"D: This is a solid, smooth drinking beer, but I don't really know if I would consider it an IPA. Even gave it a little bit of a rough poor when I was topping off my glass, but still, no signature hop flavor, mostly malts."
""
"Mouthfeel was pretty good."
"D- i may prefer english IPA's over american for the simple fact that the english versions don't overwhelm the senses with hops. with this beer's balance and only slight hop dominance yet undeniable hop presence, sammy smith ranks at the top of his class."
"Beautiful dark gold color. Nice head, but dissipated rather quickly. Not as hoppy as I expected or would have liked, but still quite flavorful and satisfying. Very smooth and the drinkability as with all Samuel Smith beers was very high. A little more hops and this would have been exquisite."
"This is one of the best Samuel Smith's I have tried. I bought this thinking that it was going to be a little more bitter, but it had a surprisingly sweet taste. Not sickeningly sweet, but definitely not the bitter I had been anticipating. The hops flavor was indeed there, but it was balanced out by the other flavors in the beer."
"Drinkability- Not great for a India Ale, but acceptable."
"I am partial to more of a fresh, herbaceous hoppiness to my IPA beers in general. Sam Smith's has much more malty sweetness, and much less piney and citrus-y hoppiness than the American brews."
"Overall, it's a nice beer - nothing particularly special; I'd like to see a little more flavour for a 5% beer. I'd certainly like to see a bit more hop aroma and flavour in an IPA. It's a clean beer but missing both the ester complexities of the better English IPA and the hop character of the Amercian IPA; Competent beer, but where's the character?"
"overall, this may be one of the best looking IPA's out there. an imperial pint really shows off the color and the head. great brew!"
"Medium-low floral hops jump out escorted by sweet malt. Medium-low caramel toasty malt character in the nose. Pours a golden amber color with good clarity and pretty good head retention. Taste is comprised of medium-high hop bitterness, medium-light malt sweetness, and medium hop flavor that is very floral and leafy with herbal notes. Finishes dry with a medium lingering bitterness. Medium body and carbonation give it a good little kick in the mouth. Final thoughts: very polite IPA; its delicate and refined with good bitterness and supporting malt. Damn decent English India Pale Ale I must say."
"I am a huge fan of Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout and Nut Brown Ales. This entry to their line, not so much. Perhaps it's that I reside in the northwest and am used to massively hoppy and citrusy IPA's. This brew has neither of those characteristics. In fact, it is quite mild in flavor. This makes for a beer that is supremely drinkable (especially at its low ABV), yet none too satisfying..."
"Orange copper in color with a thin white head comprised of tight bubbles that lace a bit. The smell is of tangy floral, grassy, spicey hops no citrus kick here. Also on the nose is a strong grainy, butterscotch note reminiscent of a classic English pale ale. The taste is mild bitterness from a bouquet of floral and grassy hops balanced very nicely by a bunch of caramel malts. Very biscuity flavor with this one with a touch of fruit and hard water mineral like character as well. Mouthfeel is deliciously smooth with a great medium body balanced by a decent level of carbonation. Drinkability ranks very high, not as damaging to the palate as an American IPA but with low alcohol and still plenty of flavor this is fun to drink."
"NOTE: This beer, to the best of my knowledge, had been stored in the dark under refrigeration."
"OK so maybe this IPA is a little small in character at 5.00% and it doesn't knock you over in the hop dept., but this is a damn good brew. Color is gorgeous reddish orange. Smell is sweet with a slight piney hop presence. Mouthfeel is crisp, very balanced taste malt and hops, it could use a tweak of hops. This would be a great session beer if one could afford it. A well crafted beer that I will go back to often."
"This is a fine IPA that I'd hit up again without a second thought."
"Notes: Must say I'm pleasantly surprised. A nice, flavorful brew to sip. Sessionable strength. Not a usual choice of mine but an enjoyable beer overall."
"Nice carbonation. Very drinkable. It doesn't have one characteristic that stands out or is very memorable, this beer is just a very satisfying experience. It would compliment most any meal, or would make a great session beer."
"D- A good example of an English IPA, nt as hoppy as an American IPA, better in the UK."
"D - Quite good, mild and sessionable with a pleasant flavor, certainly worth a try. There is a good chance I will have this one again."
"Excellent balance... great session beer."
"IPA's, but it still is quite flavorful and well worth a try."
"Pours a nice golden. Good size white head,with excellent retention,and lacing. Smell is bread,and butter,with a malt sweetness, and some earthy hops to boot. Body is medium,and carbonated. Taste is the same,with a bitter edge to the finish. better than average, but not outstanding."
"DA: When stacked up to some of the finest of it's style this one falls somwhere in the middle, although easy to drink, not exactly a thrill either."
"This beer pours a big head, but that falls quickly and almost completely. The lacing is great and the color is copper/brown. There is a light hop presence in the smell with a little bit of cardboard, but not much. The taste is a little sweet with no hoppiness that I can taste. Just a little sweet with just a hint slight backround of cardboard. Mouthfeel was nice. Overall I thought it was ok, but not something to pay $3.50/bottle for."
"Drinking this bottle was goot enough , Id perfer other IPA's out there."
"Overall, it's not the best English IPA, nor is it the best ale produced by Sam. The only thing separating this from their Pale Ale is more aroma hops, which don't do a thing to alcohol by volume. This would certainly go better with tandoori cooking than the pale, but for most sessions I'd have to skip the India Ale unless you need to get a Fuggles fix (not sure if Fuggles are used, very slight anise flavor indicates they may be in the mix..)"
"Good, very sessionable. A nice, relatively mild IPA which I will enjoy again, I will just put it first in the lineup if I have any U.S. IPA to drink."
"Marmalade color. Smells of biscuits and caramel. Fruity taste with big hints of tea and scones. Moderate hops are uncovered on the finish. This is a breakfast beer for mildly overcast mornings in the mid-fifty degree range. As I progress into the glass I'm picking up apples. OK. I'll drink this for breakfast with peanut butter cookies and a few slices of apple."
"Beer poured a golden color with a decent white head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is of sweet fruit and English hops. Taste is well balanced, somewhat malty balanced nicely by English hops, and leaves a bit of a sour apple taste behind. Mouthfeel is smooth and full for the style. Overall drinkability is good. This is a fine English IPA that is a good representation of the style!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear bronze-copper color with a very thick, frothy head. Nice bits of lacing that stick to the glass. Smell is quite sweet, reminds me of apple juice sort of. No real hop presence. The taste is sweet like the smell with the malty presence dominating and again, no real hop presence. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with not much in the way of carbonation. This is a drinkable beer, but not what I thought it would be. When I pick up a beer that says ""India Ale"" I usually expect at least some amount of hops."
"Drinkability is very good."
"Excellent beer for the style. I prefer a little more hop punch, but earthy tones make a great balance in this ale."
"Rich malty aroma with a little funk. Better than I expected, but still no real ""WOW"" factor. Good quality brew. Medium mouthfeel, slightly slick palate. Nice lasting, but not overbearing bitterness. Smooth like honey. Very little conditioning sting / bite."
"Eric"
"D - Very drinkable. A little expensive for a 4pk but a very good English Ale."
"Pours a cloudy amber with a good size off white head. The head shrinks down but hangs in there throughout. Some lacing on the glass. Aroma is surprising, I was expecting a mild malty aroma, but this one had some type of spiciness I couldn't place. The answer was in the taste. In addition to the malt backbone, this beer has a strong hint of astringency, kind of like a hefe. An unusual combination of malt, fruit and astringency makes this one a bit more complex than I was expecting. Very smooth, rich enough mouthfeel and highly drinkable. This is an excellent session beer."
"Poured a hazy deep coppery orange with an off-white head that collapsed slowly, lacing the glass as it went. Smell was very similar to the Pure Brewed Lager, and not at all like most IPA. Sweet caramel and toffee, hops not at all assertive. Taste was like the Pure Brewed Lager, with a slightly more astringent, tea-like finish. This is a mellow, easygoing beer that is what it is, and probably doesn't care what anybody thinks. I'm inclined to like it."
"The taste is more along the lines of a souped up pale ale, which I suppose was the IPA's intention in the first place. English hops are noticeable here, but there's also a strong malt backbone for a nice balance. Some spices are present, as well as a slightly metallic flavor. Overall the taste is very well-rounded and somewhat complex. Certainly enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium and smooth, with a dry finish. This is quite a sessionable ale that I wouldn't mind having again."
"A very drinkable, tasty, easily sessionable ale. A great segue for hop novices looking to get into hoppier brews, yet easily has enough flavour and depth to appeal to more seasoned beer drinkers. Will gladly drink this one again, another winner from Samuel Smith!"
"D - Complex flavors and a bitter aftertaste. It is another solid brew from Samuel Smith's."
"Overall: This may well be a banner example of the English IPA style. However, to me as just a random beer from the vast sea of offerings, this one is just above average, with a solid flavor but not much else. Its worth a try, but to me Ill be sampling some of the dozens of other IPAs, both American and English before I come back here."
"The frothy yellowed-white head atop Samuel Smith's India Ale slowly drops to a short and creamy cap. As you progress through the pint it leaves walls of wide-spread tiny spots about the glass. The nose is floral and grassy with bright, fresh hops over a delicate malt base. In the mouth it's smooth with a medium body and restrained, fine-bubbled carbonation. The flavor delivers more of the hops found in the nose, floral, leafy and grassy amidst a gently caramelish and bready malt and softly fruity and mildly mineralish yeastiness. The bitterness is balancing and solid, and it finishes short and dry. Quite nice!"
"Notes: A fair IPA. More traditional than most. A nice nod to the way IPA were made, and it stands stern in that tradition."
"I'd willingly have another, and that's good for me."
"Feels a bit thin and flat in the mouth. But very drinkable -- goes down easy. A good thirst-quencher. Not a go-to beer -- many better options out there. And this is the most disappointing selection I've had from a brewery that I really admire. But I'd certainly never turn one down either. Overall, not bad but not great. Is this typical of English IPAs? I know they invented the style, but I don't see many of them around here and it's dramatically different from the good, widely available American IPAs like Smuttynose, SN Celebration, etc."
"The beer pours a rich orangish gold with an off-white head. The aroma was a bit of hops citrus over a nice malt base. The taste is a biscuity malt with a lot of herbal hops, I also get a bit of citrus in the finish. The feel was medium and dry. Once again Sam Smith's does it right. This has a really nice complex taste that took a good portion of the bottle to sort out, but it was worth the effort."
"Pours a golden orange color, nice carbonation, head was decent and creamy, nice lacing afterwards. Scents of malts, very slight hops, and caramel. The taste is malty, slightly hoppy, there's a nice bitter bite in the end. Medium body. Drinkable, this is nothing like an American IPA, but still pretty tasty."
"Drinkability: I love the tea like aftertaste."
"Drink-Ability: A very drinkable brew that goes well with some meat or potatoes. But there are just so many better IPAs that I think this beer is overshadowed."
"I expected this to be a bit bigger, with more alcohol. But its lightness(compared to other IPAs) makes it very nice to drink. Strong flavors, malty, hoppy. But not overly hoppy. Goes down so smooth. I would drink these everyday if they were only cheaper."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Definitely the weakest attribute of this beer, the mouthfeel is thin and boring... there's barely an uprising when provoked, and it's gone before it even starts. If there's anything positive about that, well it certainly doesn't get in the way of the delicious flavors that really grip and ornament the entire mouth. Drinkability is so easy and pleasurable, so sessionable at 5%... no food necessary here, just good friends, great conversation, and maybe some light snacks. I will definitely buy this again for recreational drinking rather than reviewing next time around."
"I wasn't very impressed with this brew. I bought a single 12 ounze bottle from Michael's Deli in King of Prussia and the poured it into a pint glass. There wasn't any head at all, and I can count the amount of lace on one hand. The smell was sweet. The taste was kind of sweet, but there were some other notes of flavor I couldn't pin point. Don't drink and review."
"A decent blend is slightly above average. Would go nice with pepper jack grilled cheese sandwiches. An above average beer in the style, try one for yourself."
"Very drinkable,lacks body though,remind me more of an ESB than an India.English style is a lot different than the American. Not a bad beer,a bit lacking for me.Nothing I would buy again,but I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered either. A bit disappointing."
"Im just not that impressed with most of the Samuel Smith line, and this was another disappointment. Poured to a nice orange color with thick off-white head that lasted the entire glass, and excellent lacing. Aroma was mildly hoppy, but scent in particualr. Likewise with the flavor, tasty, but nothing special. Like most SS beers Ive rated, the body is thin and watery, and the palate metallic. Hard to give a good rating with a bad finish."
"Pours a hazy, deep gold with a dense two and a half finger head. Great retention and excellent spotty lacing. Spicy alcohol and cinnamon in the nose, mild enlgish hops and a hint of toasted pale malt. Initially sweet with toasty base malt and a hint of crystal. Next, vague dextrins and a soft diacetyl come through to couple with a quasi-phenolic fruitiness and a dry but not very bitter aftertaste. Some oily enlgish hops give an herbal, tea-like flavor -but the hop charcter is very limited and quite unbalanced for the style. Medium in body and light-ish carbonation-this is just crisp enough to fight off any slickness. Finishes dry and fruity; very drinkable with interesting malt and yeast attributes, but grossy lacking an identity similiar to the classic English IPA."
"Overall a solid and well balanced IPA. Not as strong as the old-school styles which were a little hoppier and had a higher %ABV, but still is a good example of the style as it stands. This one is comprable to a regular Pale Ale with a higher hop content. Recommended."
"Pours clear copper with a finger of off-white cream and very nice lace. Smells of appetizing toasted biscuits and toffee edged with floral and leafy english hops. Lively carbonated body with good balance of smooth creaminess. Flavor is dominated by leafy hops, balanced with biscuit malts, and shot through with mineral water hardness and a definite (but not overwhelming) diacetyl presence. Finishes with hoppy citrus dryness. Quite drinkable and superbly balanced."
"Pours a light copper with a thin, creamy head that leaves very raised and ornate lacing. Moderate carbonation. Malt smells are very sweet, nutty, and bready. I pick up a little date in there as well. The Tadcaster yeast is evident as well. Faint noble hop, which I would have expected to me more pronounced. Taste is rather bitter through and through, walking alongside the fruity esters, bready malt, and floral hop flavors. Bitterness continues on throughout the aftertaste along with some nuttiness and yeastiness. Mouthfeel is moderate and a little bubbly. A great drinker, and a nice change from American IPAs and all their NW hops. Another great Sam Smith."
"This beer's profile is similiar to a good, malty pilsner, clean and balanced. Each ingredient shows its distinct, naked character, in harmony with the others."
"It pours a clear light-auburn with two-finger foamy pale white head. On closer inspection it reveals a surprisingly strong malt nose, with a touch of citrus and alcohol. The citrus turns out to be a robust hoppy flavor and the alcohol flavor follows all the way through to the finish. While the initial burst is mild citrus and pleasant hops, the carbonation carries the first flavors away and the taste soon fades to sweet malty, bread-like finish. The finish doesn't stick around long, and is soon replaced by a metallic/alcohol like flavor that begs for another sip, even if only to get rid of the metallic flavor. This beer begs to be drank and the reasonably priced bottle goes quickly. A thoroughly enjoyable beer that is great for summer evenings and fall afternoons."
"Overall: Highly drinkale beer. Would pair well with almost an entree that wasn't sweet in nature. Great session beer. Too bad import price is higher than local brew of similar quality"
"D - Very drinkable and refreshing. Expect the flavours to be more skewed towards being a bitter rather than an IPA."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Easy to down a few of these due to the fact that they don't have a lot of strength to wear the tongue out."
"Not alot of flavor here, sort of malty and mild with no head. Not one of my favorite Samuel Smith selections..."
"This is an easy drinker that's quite enjoyable and well worth trying for it's style...a good sessionable ale for sure."
"Samual Smith's India Ale was an orange-copper color with a nearly white head. The head had decent retention and left some spotty lace behind. The aroma was crystal malts and english hops. The taste was more hops than malt, a little sweet upfront followed by a nice dry bitter finish. It was medium bodied with just enough carbonation. A nice brew, I will definitely have again."
"One of the more drinkable fine beers I've tried in recent memory!"
"D - Solid drinkability. I'd have another any time!"
"Notes: This is my first English IPA, so I have nothing to compare it to, but given what I've read about them, this is a good representation and a fine beer. But if you're looking for a big, bitter hop bomb, look in the American craft section, not Samuel Smith's. Will look for this beer again."
"Quite drinkable. Not my favorite English IPA, but a very solid one."
"Drinkability: with the fruit and conservative hopping, this could be a great introductory beer for IPA's. Potentially sessionable."
"Pours a fairly bright medium copper with a thick and creamy head that lasts pretty well and leaves a bit of lacing. Smell is fruity and light, with citrusy floral hops present but not overwhelming the strong malt backbone. Taste is toffee and butter maltiness, nicely balanced by the classic English hop character that comes through in the finish. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, and drinkability is very good. In this age of over-the-top hops in IPAs, this perfectly crafted and balanced ale might seem a bit underwhelming, but I won't complain about it. Quality brewing from this group of traditionalists is always appreciated."
"UPDATE: I had to down grade the score of this beer mid way through an IPA tasting. At this point I can't even rate it as average."
"Drinkability: I just want more hops! This isn't a bad beer, but for an IPA, I really want something with a little more kick. Possibly a good pair for fruit-based desserts?"
"Nice carbonation to this. Lower ABV makes this a great session beer, especially in this heat."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a clear clean body that leaves a thin tan head. The nose is fruit esters, citrusy hops, and a bready candy backdrop. The taste is sweet upfront mirroring the nose with a little bitter hop balance that finishes smooth. Dark fruit, figs, and raisins are all in this India Ale. I paired this beer with a bbq cheeseburger and sweet potatoe fries. I love an earthy IPA with potatoes and grilled meat it pairs so nicely."
" Nicely done! One fine IPA!"
"Nice looking bottle and nice looking beer. Good copper color and creamy head. A bit too watery. But goes down smooth. Taste is with the style but not overly hoppy. Just a bit more hops than a good english pale ale. Very drinkable and not overfilling. I wish that I could drink it more often."
"D: Low alcohol makes it a true session beer. Would prefer the 8-9% abv that the officers and the elite enjoyed."
"This beer went down in a hurry and was very drinkable. However, if you are expecting a typical American IPA with a good whack of bitterness, you're going to be disappointed."
"S. Smith IPA is a clear copper with a moderate level of carbonation. The medium-sized head is thick and light brown in color. Aroma is of fruity malt with an edge of dry hoppiness. The overall strength of the aroma is fairly weak. Taste is of a sweet caramel English malt with an edge of fruitiness. Hop flavor here isn't as strong as expected, it mainly provides a dry, herbal aspect to the dominate malt flavors. Flavors are complex and nicely layered, the only downsides here are a weak aroma and the disapointing lack of hoppiness."
"Well balanced, easy driking. I like my IPAs cold, but this was good a little warmer"
"I found it to be very drinkable and a great accompaniment to food. Not as much a sipper as a refreshing drinker."
"Truthfully, not what I was expecting, but not bad by any means. I was just expecting something a little more hopped up. This one is very close in comparison to their pale ale, but still, a solid and well balanced offering."
"M/D: This beer was medium bodied, with moderate carbonation. I bought it knowing I was going to eat spicy Indian food with part of it. It was the perfect accompaniment. Once again Sam Smith does not disappoint."
"This IPA poured an amber/copper color with a medium/small head. It had a rich malty aroma as well as plenty of hop aroma to it as well. The taste had plenty of body which I found to be enjoyable as well as a medium/heavy hop bitterness to top off the taste. I felt that this IPA had a good malt:bitterness balance to it and I found it to be a crisp and clean ale well worth what I paid for it. Give it a try if you enjoy IPA's."
"Pours a clear copper/orange color with a one finger white cap. Cap dissipated quickly. Aroma is toffee & caramel malt, toasted marshmellow, spice, floral, and citrus hops. malty but clean smell. As aroma suggested, flavor is caramel & toffee at first. Has the Tadcaster wheat twang I am familiar with. Spiciness leading into a biting hops and burnt toast. Aftertaste is hangs lightly for a few seconds only. Carbonation is low, body is med-low, and finishes dry."
"Taste is of toffee, grain and hops. The hops are most predominant with the sugary malts as a supporting cast. Not an overly dominant hop presence as you would expect in an IPA, even for an UK. Mouthfeel is only achieved through hop twang, otherwise the body is slippery and rather thin. Not too bad. The end result is a pretty drinkable ale that holds it's own, but won't make you contemplate the meaning of life after drinking it."
"D: Something you could drink all night."
"Very smooth, and not what I expected. English ales do not usually pour on the hops, so to speak, like American counter-parts, but I did not expect the malt flavour to be so present. Still good though. Had sort of a tea-like quality."
"12 ounce bottle (amber glass for a Samuel Smith beer -- hell yeah!). Pours clear amber with sticky light onionskin colored head. Moderate carbonation. Hoppy aroma is of course somewhat subdued as this is an English IPA. Fruity esters of orange marmelade, canned pineapple, and a sweetish, almost banana-like scent. Interesting to say the least! On the taste, hops are floral and earthy, almost but not quite pine-inflected. Strangely, lowish alcohol content (5% abv) is not very well masked. Malts come through in mid-sip as a caramelly side note before a lovely mineral/bitter hop finish. Earthy bitter hop burps finish sour. Medium body and slightly astringent, juicy/chewy mouthfeel. This IPA is a fine choice, however, more often than not I find other choices I prefer more without the high price of Samuel Smith beers (the only justafiably priced one, IMO, is their Russian Imperial Stout)."
"If you're looking for a hoppy beer, look elsewhere. Hell, look to a doppelbock for hops before you look to this. this isn't supposed to be hoppy. It's supposed to be a Sam Smith's English IPA, and that's goddamn well what it is. Those chaps can do whatever the bollocks they want with their beer. I havent' yet had a bad one."
"Easy to drink, feeling mostly smooth but with an IPA style kick to it."
"D: Not bad, but nothing special. Perhaps I would like this more if I weren't so used to American IPA's and APA's."
"This pours a clear amber with a huge tan foamy head. The smell is lighter than your typical American IPA,but you can still detect some hops that are a bit citrusy. The taste has some hop bitterness,but it also has almost a brown ale final. There is a creamy nuttiness to this beer. The m/f is light and I don't really think the sweet malt and the hop bitterness is well balanced together. This is OK,and true to the original IPA,but there are so many better IPA's today that this is left as a old fossil and not really worth a second look."
" Mouthfeel isn't anything special but not a liability either. Drinkability for me is helped by the low abv and carbonation levels."
"D - very much so"
"D - This isn't my favorite IPA but I thought it wasn't too bad. Definitely a sessionable beer. Might be a favorite for those who prefer the less hoppy and more malty ipas."
"This is a new copper colored beer with thick, creamy, white head. There isn't much in the way of smell, especially for an IPA. I get a very faint, soft, fruity hop smell. The taste is metallic then sweet for just a second before going very dry with a big bitterness and a dry, clean finish. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side with some stinging carbination. While there isn't really anything wrong with this beer, there is nothing terribly interesting about it either. I'd sooner take some of its American counterparts, especially for the price. Not Sam Smith's best beer by a long shot. Interestingly, I've had this beer past it's prime (like almost a year old probably) and thought it was very good. It had fun butterscotch flavors then."
"D - very, very tasty brew. Definitely something I wouldn't mind having on draft and as a session beer. Great hop/malt balance."
"Overall Impression: A fine ale. Easy drinking, just strange that a classic IPA has so little hops. Enjoyable none the less."
"Big 500 mL bottle served above fridge temperature. It pours a clear amber/chestnut color with medium carbonation and a half-inch off-white head that doesn't quite lace the glass. The predominant smells are buttery malts and maybe some piney hops. It tastes pretty English - like a beefed up Bass or something. There's buttery malts, piney/perfumy hops, some hops oils, and a medium bitterness. There might be a touch of cardboard but I don't think it's an old beer. It has a body that is medium and smooth, coating the mouth well and leaving you wanting another sip. Overall it's a pretty good beer, though not as hopped-up as modern day IPAs are, but I would imagine that this is a close replica of the beers of yore that the monarchy sent to their troops in the land of spice."
"Drinkablility: Not to bad truely enjoyed one but I wouldn't drink more than that at once."
"D - This is a fairly drinkable beer, certainly not one of my favorites but above average."
"Drinkability  Delicious. Quaffable, drinkable and tasty."
"It pours an orange red with carbonation bubbles running steadily up the side of the glass. It has a very nice white tuft of head. It's a very sexy looking beer. It smells of crisp malt, not departing from traditional english ales. There are minor scents of hops but nothing too extraordinary. It's as sweet tasting as most english ales. However, the hops are present to balance it out fairly well. It doesn't have the bite I was expecting before I poured the bottle, but I was reassured that the hops were present after my initial smell. This is a little too malt heavy than my liking, but a different experience all together for the style. It coats the tongue well. Flavors are ever present throughout the mouth and the tongue. It is not too heavy but not too thin. Then again, it is nothing extraordinary, but above par. I will drink this beer again when looking for an IPA with a lower bitterness content. Overall it was an enjoyable experience."
"Pours into a pint glass from the bottle with a solid two and a half finger head of tan frothy bubbles . Head fades to a nice ring and cap on the beer with lacing from the top down. The smell is malty with little hop presence to show through. Tartness is a preslude to a mild sweetness in the middle with a nice hop kick in the finish. Some organic oily tastes on the bitter portions of the tongue. A nice almost herbal kick. The mouthfeel is a bit watery but has a nice carbonation tickle. Overall and extremely drinkable beer. Nice malts upfront and a great hop kick in the finish. Kind of an interesting packaging too. Only Sam Smiths bottle that I have encountered yet which is brown and not clear. Interesting but suits the beer."
"This beer pours a dark amber golden with a frothy head that leaves a thin film the whole way down the glass but does not lace all that much. The smell is actually primarily malty and seems to be some sort of roasted malt. The taste is hoppy up front but has a strong malty backbone. The malts again here seem slightly roasted. These malts are strongly complemented by the hops. The mouthfeel is nicely thick and carbonated. Overall I could use a more hop forward IPA but its not bad at all."
"Drinakble enough, but doesn't stand out"
"This beer would probably make a good session beer. It is low in alcohol. Also, the flavor is definately not aggressive. In fact, this beer is sort of boring. I might just be used to the West Coast hop bombs, but this beer is just boring to me. It is definately not bad, but it just dosent stand out."
"Overall - An excellent beer.... recommended..."
"Highly drinkable. If you were up to it, drinking a 4 pack in a sitting would be very possible. This beer is unlike most IPAs. Doesnt leave my mouth all that dry, either. Recommended, but dont expect a hop-monster."
"Overall this is an above-average English IPA. I prefer the American style with its more extreme use of hops. But this is a fine session beer at 5 percent."
"Deep golden pour with copper around the sides. Smaller head reduces quickly but leaves a ton of sticky lacing around the glass. Aroma is yeasty and sour as well as being quite floral. It's also quite strong. Taste begins with a bit of caramel but transitions quickly to more of a citric sweetness. A strong yeasty precense dries out the sweetness and adds that unique Sam Smith flavor. The finish is strong on the hops with a tea like quality to them. The body is moderate and had good weight to it. I couldn't drink it fast but it wasn't heavy either. With regards to drinkability, the 500 ml went down easily but I'm satisfied. A solid all around British IPA."
"I bought this beer in the Netherlands, and although England is not far from here, I had to pay 3,10 euro for this bottle (550ml)."
"This ale from Sam Smiths is quite good. It pours a deep amber , "" golden sunset"". Very pleasant hoppy aroma ; as well as a scent that seemingly all Samuel Smith beers posess. Nice malty flavour and bitter hop finish. Light mouthfeel . A very drinkable IPA . Seems like its not as heavily hopped as many IPAs."
"Overall, this beer would go wonderfully with fish and chips, Thai, or Indian cuisine. However, the sour malt and strange yeasty flavor make me think I wouldn't want this to be my everyday beer. Nonetheless - I am glad I tried it. Plus, the label said it was, ""top fermented in stone Yorkshire squares," which facinates me."
"Overall, kind of a funky flavored ale, interesting but not wanting another with 1/5 of the pint left."
"A classic for sure."
"This brew pours a clear deep reddish-orange color. The head is massive , rocky and white. Lacing is thorough. The aroma is Samuel Smith's house aroma with some fruity citric notes. The taste is a lot bigger than the aroma. Citrus and pine dominate, but do not overpower. Like other Samuel Smith beers, the mouthfeel is incredible. Smooth, creamy, medium bodied, and with perfect carbonation for this style. Overall, this is a great IPA."
"The beer wasn't too light, but I could definately enjoy more than one. The $8 price tag for a bottle is what would stop me."
"This is a nice IPA when you need a change from the usual American offerings. First thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was a pungent smell, similar to whiskey. It is a fantastic smell. It is an amber colored beer witha light head and tons of sticking to the glass, lots of carbonation. It has the great flavor I come to expect from british ales. A ton of diacetyl. The hops are not the same bitter, hot hops of america. A lot smoother and more balanced than you may be used to. The beer is medium and dry. A great beer from Samuel Smith."
"I'm liking this a lot. It reminds me of their Organice Ale but with nice hoppy bitterness. Very well balanced."
"A quality brew, but one I'll only grab on occcasion."
"The flavor, as one would expect from an IPA, was predominantly hoppy. A nice smooth carmel flavor seemed to mellow out the bitterness a tad, also just a bit of a butterscotchy, malty flavor in the finish."
"M&D: the mouthfeel is delicately soft and ultra-smooth, matching the equally soft-textured flavour just ideally. Overall, this beer is quite understated than the broadly defined IPA from my limited experience of this style, not as bold and colourful as other IPAs I've tried from both sides of the Atlantic.. Its strength hides in its subtlety and that it drinks only too well, based on its balanced characters with good depth."
"Overall, I think this is pretty drinkable. I enjoy it for what it is, and will certainly drink the rest of this four-pack, but I don't yearn for another right away, and at $10.00 a pack it seems a bit steep. I'd still go with Bridgeport or Sweetwater for a nice IPA, but this is nice in a pinch or as a change of pace."
"Drinkability: I could drink a whole bottle, but chose to share this one with a friend. It's different than the Masala Mama IPA that we get at Town Hall, but unique and tasty in it's own way."
"I, a self-stated hopfiend, enjoyed this brew. It was different, and pleasingly so. Not too heavy, with different flavors and textures going on than your average IPA. Cheers Sam Smith, for raising my eyebrow a few times."
"Sam Smith's makes good beer."
"Overall, very boring. The only thing that stands out is the aftertaste- which I find harsh and unpleasant. Much better British IPAs out there and if I purchase a Sam Smiths product it will be one of their many other fabulous offerings."
"Mouthfeel was slightly dry, as it should be with IPA. Drinkability I think speaks for itself. I will buy this beer over and over again. Besides, it took the sting off of MSU's Godawful performance against Northwestern..."
"smell is awesome, floral but not too sweet, only a little bitter. taste is really pleasing, malts are mellowed and refreshing, balanced well with only moderate hoppiness. not too thin either. overall, it is wonderfully enjoyable and a nice change from the obsenely strong ipa's of the west coast."
"A good ale to sit down with when you're not craving hops. At the lower end of Samuel Smith's brews, it's still worth trying. Perhaps a good transitional brew for maltheads."
"Finished sweet but not cloying and clean. Could drink several, just a bit weak for the style."
"Delicous throughout, this India Ale is a classy story book of what ales are supposed to be- characterful, balanced, and gentlemanly from skin to core. A lovely beer throughout!"
"Drinkability  Nothing overly impressive, but I will drink it again."
"It's medium bodied, has a dense and soft mouthfilling carbonation. Not like the intense IPA's that'll curl your tie. It's balanced and smooth. It's not tame, but it is domesticated."
"Highly recommended!"
"Overall, a decent IPA. Not what I expected at all. If this were labeled ""Pale Ale", I would be incredibly impressed, but as an IPA, it is rather mild. Wasn't what I expected or wanted. Would have liked a bit more hops. However, next time I want a pale ale, I will probably pick this up. Have been very impressed with all of this brewery's beers, definately one of my all time favourite brewerys."
"This brewery is remarkable, end of story."
"Mouth feel is medium in body and is slightly oily. The carbonation level is also done right. It is quite noticeable, but not overdone. As a result, this beer goes down quite easy."
"In my opinion, this beer would be better off if it were considered to be a English pale ale; it just doesn't quite ""fit"" as an English IPA (traditional or modern). It's an OK beer, but it probably isn't something I'll seek out again (in the US, at least)."
"As noted by others, the color is a rich copper, and the head, initially about a quarter inch, dissipated fast. Carbonation was light (not flat), and it was smooth in the mouth."
"out of the bottle. maybe i got a not so good bottle. i was kind of let down. the appearance is very good. the smell is good as well. but the taste is where it leaves me. not what im expecting. mouthfeel is very good and drinkability is ok. i will try again"
"Purchased a single Inperial pint (18.7 oz). Beautiful copper color with an off white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma of floral, citrusy hops with a little caramel/bready malt coming thorough. Taste is a little on the dry side with a little malt sweetness in the background. Not a bad IPA. I was suprised it was only 5.0%"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, this ale appears slightly hazy and light golden with hints of amber in its glass. Thin, resinous white head comes up to about a finger before fading. Strong malty aroma packed with bready and caramely toffee notes. Hops are floral, fairly estery with a bit of an herbal quality. Hops are assertive and spirited in their bitter presence. Plenty of grapefruit and a little puckering astringincy. Malts are present from the beginning to end providing some good toasty bread character. Finish is dry, but not overly so, with hops providing some pine and herbal grassiness which blend with the quite toasty malts. As the taste fades, you are left with a hoppy and slightly medicinal flavor that lingers. Highly drinkable English IPA."
"Overall, extremely drinkable, and I definitely could put back a four-pack of this gem on any given night. Bravo."
"Feels nice overall -- a very drinkable, very unoffensive beer."
"Clear orange/amber colour topped by an off-white head. Aroma of floral hops and toasted malt with a restrained fruitiness. Good balance of flavours combining bitterness, fruit, and caramel maltiness. Finishes with fruity and floral flavours and a drying, hop bitterness. Slightly creamy texture, moderate carbonation, and medium body. Overall, this is a really nice beer, very British in character, and one that I'd be pleased to try again and again."
"Overall, the taste is bitter to tart. The malts are in the background. Not as strong as American IPAs or even most APAs, but its a solid brew with a moderate mouthfeel and an abv that helps make it sessionable."
"I like this quite a bit, even though it is much weaker than a typical India Pale Ale."
"Pours a dark copper hue with a big off-white head and excellent retention. Smell is sweet sugary malts, almost a bit fruity, and a whiff of floral hops. The taste is pretty sweet up front, a flavor remiscent of iced tea, and then a gentle spicy hops flavor comes through on the end, hardly bitter at all. This is a full-bodied beer with a creamy initial feel and a crisp dry finish. As a hophead, I was disappointed when I first tried this beer, but for what it is, a well-rounded tradional English IPA, this is a great example from Samuel Smith."
"Samuel Smith's India Ale pours a nicely hued amber/copper from teh bottle with a long-lasting frothy (three-quarter inch) head. It had no discernable aroma, except for some very slight fruitiness. It's initial flavor is actually decent with a little fruit cocktail and sharp-hopped bite. However, it finishes very bland and watery, which is a little odd for this type of ale. Pass the vinegar Jeeves, this stuff isn't bad. But it's not great either. (I'm sure I'll give it another chance.)"
"Alcohol and hopping seemed low for the style. I can't see this beer making it around the horn of Africa in an old timey ship. That said it wasn't too crappy either."
"Even for an English IPA this beer is not exactly to style (i.e. fermentation byproducts, caramel) though it is a pleasant enough drinking ale. This review is done ""on its own terms", so to speak."
"More than decent; a smooth and enjoyable English IPA. Recommended."
"550 ml bottle sampled, no freshness dating. Pours a nice dark honey almond shade, fairly clear and supporting a creamy light tan head with some retentive powers. lacing is quite well developed and long lasting. Nose is malty, yeasty, bready. This is classicaly British brew, maltyness balanced nicely by understated but present hopping for an IPA.Mineraly water quite evident. Real nice ale , give me some english chedder and bread, and I'll be in beer heaven."
"I'm sure that if back in the day you had the misfortune of being a British soldier in mid-August India, this is what you would have been served. But that was then, and right now I'd far rather be sipping a big-ass, dirt-cheap local hop monster. It's a good beer, but it's hard to get too excited about it."
"Nuzzles into the glass with a thin white head on top that fades quickly. Has a thick, honey-like appearance with extensive clouding and lots of carbonation bubbles. Smell is fragrant, almost fruity, but surprisingly weak - in short, not what you'd expect from a good IPA. This IPA starts malty smooth and becomes a sharp, oat-infused hop edge to a slightly sour apple flavor. It is medium-bodied. The finish is somewhat dry with a strong, lingering aftertaste."
"Pours with a dark copper color, with little head. The smell is much less pronounced when compared with other IPAs, a welcome change (for me at least). The taste is the same way, very understated and taking some time for the full flavor to come about. When you hold it in your mouth a fruity taste takes hold, then when you swallow it the traditional IPA taste emerges, but its mixed with the same potpourri of fruit. Unlike many of the Samuel Smiths, I feel as though I could have a couple of these and not get tired of the taste. Great for an IPA fan who is looking for a larger taste out of their beers."
"Pours a hazy full copper color and is topped by a two finger thick, frothy, tan colored head. The aroma is of ripe fruit, plums, apple, strawberry, earthy hops, and a component that reminds me of oxidation. The taste is thin and dead on the front of my tongue and unfortunately the rest of this beer does not get much better. There are notes of cider, wan stale malt, and cardboard. Despite putting this beer in a brown bottle, this beer is still quite stale and lame."
"Orange-gold colour with a white head that clings to the glass tenaciously and forms a white island of foam in the middle of the ale. Smells of fruit - strawberry and bananna - and a bit of hops and malt. Tastes fruity with a caramel hint. Hoppy, but not enough in my opinion. A bit of malt comes through, nicely balancing the hops. Pretty smooth for an IPA, none of the characteristic bitterness that I enjoy. Smooth and a bit oily in the mouth, with ample carbonation. A bit of pepperyness, but not enough in my opinion. Very drinkable though, because of it's smoothness and low ABV. All in all a decent EIPA, a good median example of the style, but not the best of the best."
"At best, an average tasting version of the style. Not too flattering in terms of flavor. Unfortunately, one of Sammy Smith's to pass on."
"Mouthfeel: Smooth and finely carbonated."
"A definite session beer and the best Britain beer I've had in a bottle."
"The taste was initially bitter, and very smooth. It was a little astringent, and a bit nutty, with traces of woodiness. Not as hoppy as I would have liked, although it went down easily. Mouthfeel was a bit thin. Still, rather drinkable."
"This poured a deep golden almost copper, nice head, with good retention, aroma was sweet and fruity with a hop whiff, taste is hop bite on the start, followed by a nice malty, fruity mellowing, hint of floral also, mouthfeel is crisp and well carbonated, drinkability is excellent, quality brew, I will have again!"
"Pours a pretty amber gold with moderate carbonation and a good-sized off-white head that sticks arounda few minutes. Aroma is herbal, smoky 9?), not sharp and strong like US IPAs, quite mellow. Flavor: definite hop presence, flaovors are more like a US Pale Ale, rather than an IPA. Are there hops? Sure. And quite nice at that, but not strong. This is actually pretty nicely balanced and enjoyable! And best of all, this is a good beer to have when you want more than one!"
"This stuff has an amazing head. Taller, thicker, and leaves more lace than any other Samuel Smith beer. Smell and taste are good. Less hoppy than most IPAs. I didn't really like the mouthfeel of this one though--too thin. Not too impressed with this beer, but not too shabby. I'd buy it again."
"Still, it leaves the mouth a little sugary and that gets annoying if you only want a single."
"Clear copper color, white fast-fading head leaves a ring of bubbles around the glass. Smells very lightly of sweet floral hops, fairly muted for my American IPA taste. Metallic and hopcentric, but with a sweet malty twist. Not comparable to the hop profile of an American IPA, but for being an EIPA, it is pretty good. Very drinkable and non-intrusive."
"The beer pours a fairly opaque amber color with a fairly small white head. Head retention is minimal, but leaves a pretty lace. Smells of roasted hops and caramel, plus some other fruity aromas. Love the smell. The taste is no exception. I love this beer, and will definately buy another in the near future. Another great one from Sam Smith's."
"pours a golden amber color, kinda cloudy with a nice creamy off-white head, somewhat tan. smell is slightly citrus of some type with some kind of spice, maybe. it also smells of hops. the smell is pretty sweet, there may be a hint of caramel in there. taste good, not sure what it is exactly though. the aftertaste is definitely the bitterness of the hops. as far as mouthfeel goes, it is lightly carbonated and medium bodied, not too thick or thin, pretty good but nothing exceptional. i'd drink it again and may buy it often due to its not very expensive price. pretty good overall."
"Anyone expecting this to be a breakthrough ale may be disappointed. And I like a good, aggressive American style IPA as much as most anyone but sitting here late on a Sunday night winding down the weekend, this goes really good."
"Pours a deep, rich golden color with a small, stark white head. Aroma is slightly malty and biscuity, with a light citrusy hoppiness. Wet, slightly foamy mouthfeel is just a little thin, but still nice. Palate is very well-balanced. Light, rich malt with a touch of sweetness is complemented by lemony hops. The aftertaste is a slightly bitter, with a nice buttery character. Not perfect for sessions, but I could drink a lot of this."
"This is a very good beer, just remember it is an English IPA and not an American IPA, so it is not a hop monster."
"Drinkability: I have to say, when I think of ""Sam Smith's", I usually think of their famous Nut Brown Ale and Imperial Stout...but this one surprised me. I love IPAs so I figured I'd give this one a try, and I was not dissapointed. Very drinkable for such a full-flavored and well-rounded beer."
"Another good beer from Samuel Smith's excellent line."
"Excellent English style IPA. A quality beer that has a great drinkability level."
"Silky smooth mouthfeel and a clean aftertaste finish out this winner. One of Smoth's best, right up there with the Oatmeal Stout."
"Samuel Smith's India Ale is one of the handful of standard bearers for the English IPA style. The flavor grew on me considerably by the bottom of the bottle and even though we'll most likely never have a love affair (I'll think of her as Samantha Smith for the purposes of this sentiment), we do have a strong mutual attraction. At least on my end."
"Pours a nice amber with a touch of copper in it; bellowy light tan head. Nice lacing as the head subsides. Butterscotchy malt nose and a light fruity air to it. Fresh English noble hop aromas of Kent Goldings and Fuggles. Very smooth and balanced. Carbonation is refined and subtle, adding to its smoothness with a delicate mouthfeel. Nicely sweet and caramelly in regards to the malt, and a flowery hoppiness in the finish. Some tea-like tannins. Probably one of the better IPAs from England. Very enjoyable."
"Slightly hazed copper body with a thick off white head. Aroma of classic English hops and a sweet malty note as well. One of the maltiest IPAs Ive had but only due to my high consumption of hoppy California IPAs. This is actually fairly well balanced. Flavor runs sweet and malty. The body is nice and smooth and fairly full. There is a metallic note in the finish and slight bitterness is nice. Overall a decent English IPA for a bottled beer."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: medium bodied feel; nothing to get too excited over, but of course I've been raised on American IPAs."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a solid pale malt scent with a fruity finish and a wonderful floral hop aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a complex pale malt arrangement that lays a good foundation for the bitter hop flavor that follows in the aftertaste. It goes down easy and finishes bitter, yet fruity from the yeast. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a fine IPA. It has more complexity than most and has a good hop content that is sufficient, but not overpowering."
"Nothing special here but quaffable."
"I'd love to try this in England. This bottle version is good, but I always wonder how fresh it is and if that would throw off the review. While worthwhile, many domestic (read: American) beers are better priced for the quality. Worth a try."
"Beer is good. Happy (lucky or unlucky) beering."
"Poured 1 1/2 finger, light tan head atop a clear, copper body. Immediately, fruity and spicy aromas were detected. As it warmed, it smelled more and more fruity and malty with notes of honey. It was surprisingly sweet smelling and lacking in the typical hop smells for an Indian Ale (but perhaps I'm too used to drinking American IPAs). It tasted like it smelled, sweet and fruity with some tangy notes and a strong bitter finish, which tended to linger heavily. It's body was medium to light, leaning more towards the light side and very smooth. This is a weird beer for me... it just seems really too sweet to be an Indian Ale but I'm no expert. The alcohol is quite low for an Indian Ale as well and is barely noticeable. It's a good beer without a doubt but I prefer something a little more powerful and spicy in this style."
"Pours a copper orange color with very active carbonation and a big rocky and dense head. Sam Smith beers have the best head and carbonation. Th aroma is of big pungent English hops, without citrus or grapefruityness like American hops. The taste is very hoppy but also well balanced with biscuity malts. Definitely not as hoppy as American IPAs but still very pleasant. A delicious crisp finish. I really like this."
"all in all this was ok, just came off as a typical IPA with nothing special to offer."
"This is a very appealing and bold, traditionally styled version."
"Pours a nice amber orange/sappy yellow with a white creamy head that is very nice, settles to about an inch but still impressive. Lacing will coat the glass slightly. The smell is of apple and slight citrus and pine. The taste is rather non-hoppy, being a west coast guy I prefer ultra hoppy. More of a sweet caramel and apple sweetness with just a slight citrus tang. A little bit of earth tones detected/also bread tones as well. Maybe peach fruit as well? Medium bodied and good, drinkable but I need the hops man!"
"Samuel Smith's IPA isn't close to any American IPA's I've tried. If anything, it struck me as being similar to a few American pale ales. However, that's where the new breakdown of beer styles shows its worth. This isn't an American IPA; it's English. As such, I found it to be quite drinkable and a quality representative of the style."
"A very nice IPA, quite a good entry into the world of IPA's as it is mild (especially when compared with hopped american versions)"
"pours a nice amber colour with a big sticky off-white head. not bad. the smell here is atypical for an ipa, malt, earth and butter dominate and hops are near impossible to detect. the taste here is also not bad, but if i didn't pour the beer from the bottle myself, i would never had suspected that i was drinking an ipa. it starts buttery goes a bit malty and then hits earth and back to buttery a bit. different for an ipa but tasty nonetheless. there's a definite english feel and flavour here (why wouldn't there be though?). also present is a touch of bitterness throughout which is quite welcome. overall, i'd say give this one a try, but i can't see myself running back to it very often, especially if given the option of this one or more traditional ipa's, i'd choose the latter. regardless, this one is still tasty and satisfying."
"This is a beer I could just drink all day. I am sure it would go with most things also, especially warm weather."
"Pours out orange colored with an average sized head. Pleasant, fruity aroma that smelled like apples. Very smooth and fruity tasting. Very hoppy, but not spicy and one of the more mild IPA's I've ever had. Coats the inside of my mouth very well without leaving it too dry. Very drinkable for an IPA. A decent choice anytime."
"The appearance is a little darker than some other IPA's, however I have not had many English IPA's. The smell is hoppy, however it is balanced. The taste was not what I was expecting. I was looking for more hops however beeing a hophead I tend to favor the over the top hoppiness in highly hopped beers. However this beer is very balanced in the mouthfeel and it is very drinkable and easily attainable. As with all other Samuel Smith's offerings top notch."
"This beer is mild but still interesting. Very drinkable."
"This nice looking, clear copper-amber ale gives up a dark cream-colored, coarse head. Implosions leave pockmarks. The nose is bready with tangy sour toffee. Yum. The sour toffee in the front leads to a buttery, malty, sourish middle. Finish is really quite bitter, with some nice buttered bread. This is a good ale. I don't think it's Samuel Smith's tastiest, but it's very nice."
"these fellows do not know how to brew a bad beer. every style is among the best in its category. the sort of beer i could fill my fridge with and never get sick of. its not the best IPA ive had, but geez its not too far away from the top. excellent!"
"British style bitter IPA. I liked it but younger mates wanted more wallop and even less bite, which was soft. Foamy pour. Amber with oil residue and clinging lace. Lemon citrus with mid-sip Apple spice and orange pekoe tea throughout and the latter as the aftertaste. Nice aroma."
"What a nice looking beer. Had a great head that lasted till the last sip. A very bright copper that was really clear. The smell was malty and kinda sweet with a slight hint of hops. The taste was very smooth and malty with a hop bite in the end. Very good I really liked it. Not like other IPAs Ive had that have been really hoppy. Quite a good beer."
"DRINKABILITY: Anytime and Anywhere. (My criteria for my next experience with this fine IPA)"
"Amber-copper color with an orangey-biege and very thick half-inch of head that sinks slowly to about a quarter inch, and then hangs there for most of the glass. Aroma is light floral hops. Flavor is initially malty, understated hops. Some faint pear and apple in the finish. Understated flavors and not the same as this side of the pond, but it does change as it warms, with the hops moving closer to the front of the palette."
"Pours a very bold gold color, with a fairly good white head, though could use more lace. Smells somewhat of a brewery, like unfermented malt. Taste is good, somewhat unusual in that it has the typical hoppy flavoring expected, but also has an almost intangible sourness that adds body and flavor to the brew. This beer is very drinkable and quite refreshing, goes down easy with a pleasant hoppy aftertaste. Recommended."
"It's a good example of the British IPA style"
"Not a bad beer at all, but not what I expect from an IPA. I guess this is what the British version is like."
"Cloudy amber orange color, like that of a sunset, faint malt hop aroma, the taste is surprisingly more malty than hoppy and somewhat on the light side, but overall its good. I like it i guess, not because of a big taste, but rather the balance and drinkablity. You could stick with this all night"
"Pours a pale copper and not a lot of head, but it could be the soft pour. I tasted this blind and thought it tasted very English even though it was part of a IPA blind tasting. Very pleasant light caramel malt flavor. The hops are low but noticeable and it's fairly dry. There's a bit of apple peel in the flavor that gives it a bit of character and makes it stand out."
"I'd be happier with a fresh Sam Adams over this ... eek!"
"drinkability: I could drink a lot of these. It wasn't really filling.It's not a bad beer but it's not a great beer either. Not worth the $3.29 I paid for a 24 oz. bottle."
"Good beer for repeat tasting..."
"Overall- A very drinkable beer that will definitely appear in my fridge again. Highly recommended!"
"Very smooth beer, tastes great going down! Finish has the normal IPA strength."
"Drinkability is good, this dry ale would go well with very spicy foods."
"I enjoied this one fairly well, and would probably buy it again."
"Drinkability: Could drink these forever. An ultimate session beer. Keep these away from me cause I likely end up sick before I stop drinking them!"
"On the whole  Ho-Hum but I could quaff a few pints."
"Impressive pour. Nice creamy head wih a beautiful dark brown or chestnut color. Not near as much hops in the nose as I am accustomed to. Rather sweet smelling. The taste is not all that hoppy either. It must be the Americans who have gone over the top with hops. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Medium hop taste with a nice malt balance. This beer was chilled moderately and I think that might be right."
"I have yet to be disappointed with a Samuel Smith's beer. Each one is unique in its own way (even the organic versions). I could drink this beer for quite some time. As for food accompaniments, I would recommend some spicy Chinese food, or maybe a nice T-Bone steak. A beer for all seasons."
"-Oelergud"
"Drinkability  Not your heavy-hitting West Coast IPA by any means, but a terrific session ale in step with traditional English tastes."
" It pours a brassy copper color with a fairly good-sized white head and some trails of lace. A floral hop aroma is front and center and light malty smell mingles with a faint whiff of cut hay. The biscuity malt body is lightly grainy with just a hint of caramel sweetness. This highly hopped ale displays a sharp grapefruit bitterness with a mild lemony sour taste. The light metallic tang provides some back of the throat edginess. A mildly herbal quality offers little reprieve from the bitterness, but does manage to provide an interesting angle to ponder."
"Poured a fine white tan head that clinged to the side of the glass as it held itself up. The aroma is fresh, moderately hoppy aroma. Hazy, amber colored beer. The taste isn't bitter at all, suprising. A pretty balanced beer, the hops edge out the mildly sweet malty flavors, but aren't IPA's supposed to be more hoppy? and bitter? I like, it just reminds me more of a hoppy amber lager than an IPA."
"The Head, thick and frothy quickly diminished into the amber colored beer. There was little, if any carbonation. A very hoppy, yet floral scent led to a very hoppy taste. the bitterness of it is exactly what an IPA should be. Very strong with a nice mouthfeel. I would drink this again."
"550mL bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a slighty hazy deep amber color with a large 3 finger head. There is a large amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is full of hops and flowers, it smells like spring. Very nice. The taste starts a bit malty with some caramel sweetness. In the middle there is a little kick of citrus, and at the end a good bitter hop finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and strong. The drinkability is also pretty good. Truely a classic original IPA. Whenever you get tired of all the ""double"" and ""imperial"" IPAs, come home to this quintessential brew."
"Pours a nice golden-amber with a good number of bubbles rising to the surface. The yellowish head is medium sized with frothy bubbles and recedes to a good lace that is a little sticky. The aroma is of caramel malts with notes of mild hops. Nice medium-full mouthfeel that is smooth and slick feeling. The malt and hops seem very well balanced throughout. Nice subdued caramel malts towards the start, and a bit of a mild hop bite towards the finish. The hops linger into the aftertaste and are slightly citric. All in all, a very nicely balanced mild English IPA that would make for a good session brew. I enjoyed this one, but have to say that, these days, Im leaning a bit more towards the more assertive IPAs."
"Drinkability: A nice, easy-drinking IPA from a great producer. A good crowd pleaser."
"Copper color. Medium head. Aroma is fruity and spicy. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are nutty, a touch fruity and slightly sweet. Hops are slightly spicy, with a touch of grapefruityness. This is an IPA that is very much in the English style of IPA. Yet, it still has a nice hop bite. Well balanced and fairly smooth. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is somewhat bitter."
"I can't believe I haven't tried this beer before. This ale poured out a clear orange amber color, and the look of it is inviting. Nice fruity hop aroma. The taste is dry, full of citrus flavors and bitter. Theres also a nice sweet malt body with some caramel and maybe orange. Not too heavy, medium bodied and finishes dry and crisp. Very drinkable."
"A good example of the English-style IPa, with a sightly buttery feel to offset the hops tanginess. It pours a lovely amber, just like you'd expect if you were at any pub in Great Britain, and the smell is lightly citrus with a boost of floral hops. The taste is not really very complex; after an intial burst of caramel and lemon, the taste fades quickly and there a dullness to the finish. Still, a worthy brew."
"The look is very nice with a coppery body and off white head that leaves spatterings of lace. The nose gives off the citrus hops notes to be sure, but follows with a nice malt undertone that is quite nice. There is a great sense of citrus in the taste, mostly of grapefruit and not too terribly bitter. A bit bitely in feel, but not overly so. A good India if not one of the top."
"I truly enjoyed Sam Smith's IPA. I feel vindicated in that my homebrewed IPA's taste more like this than the west coast hop-bombs. It is OK for an IPA to have significant maltiness, in my opinion. This is just a good English pale ale with an extra helping of hops. Never mind the IBU (bitterness) pissing contest of American brewers. Here are the particulars: Pours a nice thick head that subsided to 1/2 inch (more like 1 cm), deep golden-amber color, low to moderate carbonation. aroma is predominantly sweet, biscuity malt and earthy spicy hops in the background. Flavor is a nice intermingling of malt and strong hops. Very balanced and luxurous in the mouth. Fnished easy and leaves a pleasant malty/alcohol/hoppy aftertaste. What I sampled is likely an old bottle because it is imported. I can only imagine what this fine elixir tastes like at the brewery."
"It drinks well and has a nice crisp feel to it. It is not near as hoppy as American IPAs. A smooth ale."
"A real pleasant suprise. My expectations for this were not that high, (even though I love Samuel Smith's beers) because I'm used to stronger IPA's. After an uneventful pour, the first taste grabbed me. Crisp, fruity, with just the right amount of bitterness. Nice, smooth mouthfeel. I recently had Fuller's IPA, and I think I like this one more. I can see where the micros used these beers as a starting point, as all of the elements are there. Lots of citrus, and the body is fuller than a lot of the micro IPA's.I will purchase more of this (and for those of you angered by Sammy's clear bottles, this was in a brown one!)."
" This one seemes destined to become one of my favorite pale ales. Would probably make a fairly good baseline against which to compare all other IPAs."
"Certainly a good Sam Smith brew, and a beer that one should never decline."
"Pours a near clear dark amber with a thick creamy off-white head that eventually settles, but remains on top of the body. India ale's aroma consists of malt and floral hops. Some sweetness also detected in the nose. Smooth and medium-bodied mouthfeel. Prickly hop bite upfront, followed by flavors of caramel malt and biscuit. The finish has a lingering juicy hop bitterness. It's nice to have an IPA without the monster hop overload that its American cousins often contain. I wish all of Samuel Smith's beers came in brown bottles. Nicely done."
"Overall - A fantastic ale, and a great example of an English style IPA. Wonderfully complex, fully flavored from start to finish. Samuel Smith does no wrong in my book."
"A beautiful copper colored brew sporting a thick billowy cream colored top. NIce hop aroma here, medicinal, herbal, and slightly lemon/lime and hint os sweet malt. Medium bodied with a very nicely complex malt flavors (caramelly and toasty) finishing with a smooth herbal hop bitterness. The herbal hop flavor melds nicely with the malt with a hint of enjoyable butterscotch. Very easy to drink with great balance and complexity."
"Pours a nice clear golden amber colour. Good sized head that stays with the beer, good lace. Puts on a good show in the glass. Gently carbonated. Smells of apple, caramel and some malt. Just mild hops and malt on finish. Smooth and dry on the mouth, doesn't linger overlong. Easy to drink, not overpowering in any way."
"An all around impressive beer; pours a slightly golden amber with a robust white head and healthy lacing. I was really impressed with the color of the head and the remarkable color and transparency of the ale, a it's light-diffracting qualities; really nice to view and appreciate what it takes to make such an ale. Malty aromas trying to break above the overwhelming hoppiness, and good taste and average mouthfeel. A mildly bitter finish completes a very enjoyable and ""quality"" member of the IPA family. As much a pleasure to view as to drink."
"Although the hops overshadowed the malt, it's deffinatly a big part of this beer. What's really interesting about is how English it is. Most America IPA's use the grapefruit citrusy Cascade hops to death, this beer seems to do the same overhopping but with a distinctly English earthy Hop, I'd guess Kent Golding or some other classic English Hop. It's a very refreshingly different over hop usage. If you looked up the term English Bitter, this beer would be the deffinition."
"Straight up 4's here! A fine beer showing copper golden hues. As I'm not the biggest fan of super hoppy brews, I found this India Ale to be a delight. Just what I look for in all things in general-balance. You/ll find lots of Hoppy resiny notes yet you will find they are balanced by sweet malty flavors and some tangy hints of rye. Probably would be nice with a Rueben."
"Drinkability: Slightly sour aftertaste is actually well-paired with the oily bitterness that resides on the palate. Finishes dry with a bit of an aftertaste. Again, nothing too ""in your face", and one that leaves you ready for another."
"Its not a U.S. monster but you can see where those come from, got to respect that....ehh hopheads? Its not a in your face IPA, but it is a slap with one of those fancy white gloves. Dignified, unexpected, and well done."
"I liked this beer. It was a good beer. But I don't know what else to say; it wasn't really inspiring. A little bit of something drifts up over an inherent floral hop aroma to suggest a coming bitterness. Fairly non-descript malt and herbal flavor yields to a bitter, dry finish. Good, and very easy to drink."
"Upon opening this Ale, it immediately foamed up and overflowed the bottle. It had been sitting in the fridge for several days to cool it down. Needless to say it is highly carbonated. Its aroma is nice with a non-offensive smell. The carbonation lasts well into the sample. It is a medium amber color with a long lasting head mostly due to the continuous carbonation. The taste is mild with only a small initial flavor. It's after taste does last for a minute, but is well rounded in its flavor."
"Tonight I review Samuel Smith's India Ale and my expectations are high. Poured a deep golden to light amber with an incredible head that reduces quickly to a thin, sticky layer with good lacing. Smells are faint, but sweet, malty and bready--very enticing. The first sip demands my taste buds stand at attention with some nice hoppy bitterness with moves into a creamy buttermilk biscuit flavors with hints of caramel. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and is has a nice creamy finish. I have read several reviews stating that this beer is not as intense as some IPAs, however this is my first and I can not draw the same conclusions. Ultimately, high intensity is not necessarily what makes a beer rate high in my book. S. Smith's IPA is perfectly balanced with the flavors it presents and as its not overly bitter, it is extremely drinkable. I bought a single of this to review and try for the first time and next time I will buy the whole six pack."
"This beer utterly confused me. The entire time I was not sure what I was drinking. Was it a IPA as the label alleged? or was this something else entirely? Did I get a bad bottle? Regardless it poured a foggy, copper hue with a tiny bit of white head. The India had a very fruity nose with an abbundence of rose petal like malts and not anything in the way of hops. Same could be said for the taste. It was thin and sweet almost like a cider with lots of caramel malts. I am not entirely sure what to think of it. I liked it, but was it a IPA or some other strange beer? Give it a try and let me know differently."
"Pours a very translucent amber. A nice sized white head, diminishes slowly leaving some lacing behind. The remnants of the head form a thin film of bubbles for the duration of the beers existence. Smells fairly mild, a hint of floral or citris aromas. The sweetness of this beer tingles on the tip of the tongue. A very pleasant hoppy taste is also present, but much more mild than that of many other IPAs. Finishes smooth and crisp."
"As others have pointed out, this India Ale has all of the characteristics (including abv) of an English Pale Ale. It has a nice flavor with hints of biscuit and a bit of caramel. It has a nice mouthfeel though, again, it's not quite what would be expected of an IPA. Like many others here, I've had my palate set by US IPAs, particularly west-coasters with tons of hops. This is a thoroughly enjoyable beer but not a ""go-to"" when it comes to IPAs."
"Pours a colorful amber with a thick and active head, incredible lacing and stickiness throughout. A malty, hoppy and spicy aroma, very nice. Complex flavors, some malts and yeasty fruitiness noted up front, the obvious hops are there, but not overly aggressive, some citrus and grassy undertones make this one standout. A pleasant dryness combined with light bitterness on the palate that leaves you yearning for more. Incredible flavors, ever so smooth and slick, incredible and enjoyable! Call it a staple."
"I could drink this every day and be a very happy man. I like a well-balanced brew...love some hops but want some malt with it. In other words, this could be my ideal beer. The hops are more understated than American IPA's, which is a good thing IMO. It pours an amber/copper color...dark for the style, the head isn't big but lasts. You know from the aroma alone that its well balanced, because the malt and hops both come through. Mouthfeel is smooth as silk. I can't put my fingers on all the tastes, but there is some toasted malts, a buttery toffee, and a bitterness in the dry finish. I (reluctantly) handed the glass to my wife and asked if she could think of any way to improve this brew. I don't know what she said...I dove right back in when she handed the glass back and started talking. The point is, I had to ask, because I wouldn't have changed anything about it."
"Copper/amber color with a rather small head. It's instantly recognizable as an English hoppy ale. I love these British hops! This does seem more like an ESB or extra hoppy pale ale rather than and IPA. But whatever, it's a very enjoyable brew. It has a nice malty start and the spicy hops after that. I really enjoy the character of hops from this country. I still must say Fuller's is King but this stuff is great."
"This is one of the few Sam Smith's beers I have had out here on the west coast that hasn't been oxidixized, skunky or well passed it's prime. Poured a nice copper color with a generous amount of head. Aroma were of hops, but not nearly as strong as you would find in a NW IPA. Mouthfeel is creamy with some bitterness on the back of the tongue. Grapefruit and other citrus flavors come through clearly on the tongue. A fine British IPA."
"Oh yes this is a classic, appears the majestic amber copper tone with an amazing beige cream toned head to complement the body. Aroma is decent floral hops with a nice underlying malt profile very good flavor that is tag teamed with some pine cone hops accompanying the malty molasses like sweetness. The taste is butterscotch malt profile brought on by the open fermentation that this and other Sam Smith beers under go. The nice rolling hop profile is a creamy buttery combo. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and if you like IPAs this is a classic British IPA to get started on before getting kicked in the teeth with some Cascade hops from the American counterparts we have all come to know and love."
"Drinkability/notes: Very pleasant, lacks the typical heavy-handed hop character of American IPAs, while still boasting a solid hop backbone. A very good beer that exudes quality."
"As far as I'm concerned, Samuel Smith's beers are the archetypes of their respective genres. As such, I was excited to try his India Ale (whoever Sam Smith is or was, he's still alive and well in my inebriated mind). In reading about India pale ales, I had thought I would be in for one hell of a hoppy experience, but to my pleasant surprise, Sam Smith's India Ale was remarkably balanced. Light brown hue and a conservative head. I'm a proud pale ale man, and this is one medal I'm happy to wear. I can only hope they'll all be this good."
"12 oz bottle. Medium copper color. Darker than most IPA's, darker than I expected I guess. Smell was midly hop filled, not over the top robust hop aromas like some American IPA's. Taste is spot on for the style. Zesty hop presence, but again more subtle than most American IPA's. Lacks the tangy citrus presence, but the hops are still noticable. Malt presence is very noticable and tasty, sweetness underlying. Medium to full bodied, very very drinkable."
"This brew is a lighter-copper color drink, with a big cream head on the top of it. Impressive lace trails. Sweet malt nose, some bitter hops along with a buttery scent. The taste features sweet caramel in the front, which is punctuated by a nice blast of bittering hops. Again some light buttery characteristics. This is an excellent english IPA, one that i go to frequently."
"very drinkable ""IPA""..if this is near the original..it looks like the new IPAs are over hopped..but i enjoyed this immensely."
"Color is copper/honey with a deliciously creamy off-white head. Good head retention and moderate lacing. Aroma is hoppy, fruity (orange), nutty, minerally, with a touch of caramel. On palate, minerally followed by lightly-toasted, earthy malt, mild buttery toffee notes, and orange. Finish is tart, bitter, and long, with the bitterness coating the tongue long after you've swallowed. The heavier hops in this one deliver a cleanness and bite throughout, though of course nowhere near the intense hops we see so often in American IPAs. This is a very balanced brew, English in its fruitiness and maltiness with bitterness mostly weighing in in the finish. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both solid."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a thick, sticky, off-white head, which has good retention. Aroma is mildly sweet, possibly caramel, with a fair amount of spicy hops. Taste is very well balanced, the hops and malt complementing each other very well finished off by a caramel-like sweetness. Mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and very smooth. This beer isnt as hoppy as most IPAs, but its still a great beer."
"Poured a dark amber color with little to no head,mine had been onthe shelf for awhile and developed a winey smell to it but it held up well.The malt in this IPA was very evident upfront with a good hpsmack in the end.A very well made IPA even sitting on shelf for almost a year u could taste the flavors of a very good well-made ale."
"Not a bad brew, but nothing special. The sweetness was a tad much for me. I am glad to see Sam Smith using a brown bottle for this beer."
"of the woods."
"This beer poured a dark amer color with a white head that crested at three fingers then reduced down to about a quarter inch. The lacing was minimal. There wasn't much aroma happening here, but there was a little bit of a fruity smell. I guess you could add hops to that because they were noticeable as well. It just wasn't very strong. The taste was hoppy and a bit fruity. There just wasn't anything that jumped out in the taste besides the hops. The finish was slightly bitter but not enough for this style. This brew seemed to have a lot of carbonation, maybe a little too much. I wasn't real impressed with this brew, although I would drink it again."
"A terrifically well-rounded brew, and very drinkable. Finish is simple, sweet, and ever-lasting. Another excellent Smith offering."
"Pours out copper amber with a nice white head. Good malt/hop balance. A bit of a tea thing going on here too I think, but that may just be the ""English"" in it. Very easy to drink. Interesting flavor, but far from being a favorite IPA. I guess I was hoping for a bigger brew."
"It is very smooth with a low level of carbonation. The hops are not a real kick in the pants. I enjoy a good lashing of hops, but with this beer, it is just not necessary. They blend in very well with a smooth rich flavor caramel and grain. The aftertaste brings the hops back and is just a delite. I do not think I will ever go wrong with Samuel Smith. This is certainly not the best IPA I have had, but it is clearly what I had expected out of the Tadcaster Brewery, their own unique interpretation of the style."
"Seems like this is what a true IPA should taste like, although I still love the american inerpretation of the style. Great brew!!!!"
"Taste = you go thru stages with this beer, malty sweet and bitter in good balance as you take a drink, as you swallow the sweet leaves and only the bitter remains. A long, long finish. Plenty o' hops. Yummy."
"The beer pours a translucent deep copper or mahogany if you prefer. Head is Bunyanesque, with a frothy texture, and light tan in color, as it dematerializes, it leaves behind a thick and clinging lace upon the glass. The aroma of sweet ripe apples, a hint of the hop flowers, and a nice malt underpinning to cap off this exquisite nose. The start is malt and quite sweet, the top middling in its feel to the palate, the finish hop spicy, but not overpowering, the acidity moderate, and the aftertaste dry. A quite decent beer, just the right amount of hops and malt, with a crisp bite, that I find appealing."
"Bloody Marvellous!"
"Pours a clear copper color with a thick and creamy off-white colored head that eventually dissipates into a nice heavy lace. Nose is floral and spicy hops. Taste is a really nice balance of sweet malts and bitter hops. Very smooth with a nice semi-bitter finish. This is an interesting IPA and one Ill gladly try again."
"Pours a hazy amber color, nice thick and creamy lasting head, thin body and a little watery, floral mild hop aroma, not as much hop bitterness as I would expect from an IPA. Nice balanced flavors, crisp clean finish, great english IPA, always a drinkable brew."
"What a balanced IPA. This brewery has yet to disappoint me. What quality beer they produce. Pours out to a dark, golden amber with a slight head. Nose is hops and malt, which is rather unique to get that malt profile/aroma from an IPA. Taste is that of a wonderfully balanced beer. Yes, there are hops here as there should be with an IPA, but the malt presence is undeniable and delicious. A true session IPA if there ever was one."
"Nearly clear amber gold appearance with bulky head of off-white foam. Hoppy crispness comes through in the nose, but the smell of this beer is weaker than expected. What meets expectations is the hopped-up taste--somewhat dry and even a bit sweet. Flavors are quite uniform and balanced throughout. Lingers in the mouth a bit, but drinkability is quite strong."
"Nice orange copper color, off-white head, spicy hops and sweet malt nose, spicy hops flavor with subdued sweet malt in the background. The hops are quite nice throughout the drink, however the hops are not as pungent as expected in an IPA. Overall this is a well balanced, easy to drink, satisfying IPA with good flavor."
"Pours a glowing copper hue with a frothy, sticky, off-white head which retains fairly well. Steady carbonation is present. Aroma is diverse with notes of spicy hops and sweet caramel malt. Taste is very well balanced, with the hops and malt complementing each other quite well. Although the hop flavor is dominant, this could probably use some more hops. Regardless, it's still pretty solid. Mouthfeel is just a touch carbonated and very smooth. Quite refreshing and drinkable, this is a classy British IPA."
"Light copper in color with a small head that didn't last. The smell isn't very powerful.  Light and refreshing and very well balanced.  Not much like the IPA's of today but still tasty.  I have only had a couple Sam Smith's beer and have beer very impressed each time."
"Id drink it again.  Very enjoyable."
"Pours a nice copper color with a foamy head.  The aroma is like that of other Samuel Smith ales with just a hint of bitter spice.  The flavor is of mellow malt with grassy undertones and an unaggressive bitterness.  Not nearly as hoppy as I had hoped for, but very drinkable.  This would be a good way to introduce a tentative real-beer drinker to the world of hop flavors. Not aggressive, but not absent either."
"The color of Vernors. Aromas are a mixture of butterscotch, lemon zest and brine. Creamy, rich texture supports flavors of seasoned oak, caramel, fried nuts, fig seeds and twiggy hops. Like most other Old Brewery Tadcaster products, this is a cerebral beer. Close your eyes. Drink it warm. Turn the TV off. And contemplate. Don't fight the images of fish n chips vendors, hussies and waifs running through the streets of York... Tobacconists... Spice shops... Sea air... Boardwalk..."
"Samuel Smith’s IPA:  Deep amber/copper color.  Full rich head, with staying power.  Very nice hops aroma.  Full hops in the taste, with some mellow caramel malt taste to balance out the hops.  Fairly low in alcohol for an IPA, but with a very classic IPA taste.  A very nice introduction to IPA, and I thought a very agreeable beer."
"Not bad!  Pours a clear amber/orange color with a 3 finger off white head.  It leaves a lace all the way down the glass.  It smells slightly sweet and tangy.  The taste is initially hop bitterness with just a slight bit of caramel flavoring and finishing with a dry hop bitterness at the end that is stronger than at the beginning.  The mouthfeel is light to medium and goes down rather nicely.  I could definitely drink more than one of these.  Cheers!"
"Another fine brew from Old Brewery Tadcaster.  Pours light amber, with a fluffy head that trails down the entire glass.  Smell is dominated by hops, as an IPA should be.  Taste is also predominatley hoppy, with some carmel or butterscotch malt notes. I found this IPA to be very refreshing, and drinkable."
"Another Samuel Smith, and I certainly was not disappointed. Pours a golden amber with a nice thick fluffy white head, sticks all the way down. Very flavorful and slightly sweet, but not much hop flavor. Extremely smooth. Another delicious India ale and yet another kick-ass Samuel Smith brew."
"Okay, as usual, the Samuel Smith's are great, good or at least descent.  This beer poured a cooper gold color with an off white head that left little lace.  The aroma was of hops, malt and caramel.  The taste was of hops, malt, caramel and butterscotch.  The finish was of hops and caramel, but slightly bitter.  A good beer, but I think I prefer my IPAs(personally)to be a little less sweet."
"Nice orange color, poured with a lovely head. This was a great post-golf, picnic ale. Lighter than my usual ale choice, with enough hops to draw me in for more.  It must have been the day - drinking down into this it became more citrusy, less bitter. Lower in alcohol too. A definite keeper."
"Smooth, this I.P is just that. No long lasting bitter mouthfeel but a very easy drink. Amber-orange in color, slight cloud through the glass, off white head and slight lace. A lower abv at 5.0 but still hopped and malted enough to taiste makes this a gentlemens IPA. I was impressed."
"I'm going to start by saying this beer would have received a upper echelon rating but It wasn't a fresh bottle.  It had the similar cardboard taste that I recognized in a bottle of Young's Ram Rod that was past it's best before date. This beer looked very nice, a clear amber with a thin head that left very little lace.  I guess that was the first clue. The aroma was just a tad off, and the taste was a bit old.  My drinkability rating comes from the fact that I remember this beer being so great. It went down pretty nicely despite being off, so I know it would be better.  I'm going to buy another bottle from a different location and re-review."
"Got this one on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. Hoppy, malty, satisfying ale. Big creamy head and decent lacing, although a little on the weak side."
"Clearish amber color, good 1/4 inch head that sticks to itself well.  Hoppy aroma.  Flavorful caramelly malts and pretty nice floral hop assertion.  Slightly hoppier than Fuller's, malts not quite as flavorful.  Nice balance and extremely drinkable.  Reserved, in the English style.  Nice bittering at the swallow, but subtle."
"A very polite IPA.  A somewhat mellow tan color with a billowing rocky head.  The beer has a shy, flirting hop aroma...the first time I had this brew, I expected a powerful ""face-full of hops"" aroma that just isn't there.  Nice, solid taste, however.  Pleasing bitterness.  Worth having every now and again."
"Huge, creamy, billowy well retained head.  Copper hued w/ excellent clarity.  It almost looks filtered.  Semi - pungent floral and grassy Kent Goldings nose... It must be dry hopped.  Yeast fruitiness, although perceptible, is masked by the relatively strong hop nose.  It's clean and well balanced in taste-- the hop bitterness is moderate for an IPA, but since the malt profile is not the centerstage of this brew, the hops dominate.  Certainly a clean and drinkable brew.  I used to dislike Sam's India Ale before I acquired a taste for British hops.  If you're not used to a rustic, grassy, earthy hop flavor you won't like this brew.  Stylistically speaking it's weak for an IPA, but it tastes like a good English pale."
"Well...really not what I expected....but still a good laid back IPA. Starts by pouring a bronze hazy color, off-white / light tan foamy head that lasts for a long while. There is a very nice floral hop aroma. The taste is a pretty good for a IPA, a little shortage of hops but not all that bad, very light citrus notes, a very nice smooth creamy mouth feel and dry middle with a long, clean finish. I had to get to the middle of this one to really enjoy it. Overall enjoyable and worth a try, pretty good stuff! But then again, there are many other great IPA's out there....."
"Hazy copper-orange color, nice chunky head.  I liked the aroma for an IPA-  sweet bread-like malt and floraly hops.  Unlike most American IPA's, the initial taste impression is a sweet fruity maltiness, but finishes nice and bitter.  Drank a lot bigger than its advertised 5% ABV.  A nice change-up IPA."
"Notes: A decent ale ... though small in comparison to other modern day IPAs both British and especially American. Oddly enough this brew is not any bit stronger than the Pale Ale in alcohol ... the body and hops are only a notch higher in comparison. Not a bad ale ... at least the English characteristics make this brew an interesting ale."
"A classic.  Sharp hops with just enough bite."
