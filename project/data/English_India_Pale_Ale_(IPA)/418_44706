4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"Another solid offering from Left Hand, who is quickly moving up the ladder for me.  This is an IPA, but it's a bit maltier and less bitter than traditional ones, so that's why I liked it more than anticipated.  I'm not sure if others may have gotten a bad batch, because I really didn't get the sour or bitter taste or the foul aroma that some reviews have described.  I've never had this issue with Left Hand, so I'm definitely surprised that some have reviewed this beer so harshly.","dcscientist","Mar 30, 2015"

It smelled good with a slight hoppy aroma, though not overpowering. The first drink was light and underwhelming. Typical English IPA. I did not realize it was an English IPA when I tried it so I was disappointed with the lack of anything approaching hoppiness in the first taste. As my mouth adjusted, it turned out to be a decent beer, but nothing to write home about.","ruffdawg","Sep 01, 2013"

In addition, the elements of the beer seemed ""flatter"" on flavor than I would have hoped (kind of like the beer had traveled all the way from England).

There's a very bright, bitter finish. Overall, this has some balance but ultimately the bitter hops really take off.","JuicesFlowing","Mar 23, 2013"

It is an IPA and is quite hoppy for my taste, but it has more to offer than just bitterness. It is fairly fruity and bready, and has a very hazy appearance. I probably won't buy another 6 pack, but will continue to throw one into the pick six from time to time.

Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a small 1 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, herbal, pine, floral, biscuit, light citrus, and earthy spiciness. Pretty nice and pleasant aromas with good balance. Taste of caramel, biscuit, pine, herbal, floral, toast, light citrus, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, biscuit, pine, herbal, floral, and earthy spiciness. Good bitterness/sweetness balance; with a fair amount of complexity of flavors. No cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish. Extremely smooth and easy to drink. Overall this is a nice English IPA. Well balanced with a nice flavor profile; very easy to drink. Wouldn’t mind having it again; fresher next time too. Quite enjoyable.","superspak","Sep 25, 2012"

Perhaps a little thin but delivers a nice, slightly crisp after taste. An easy drinking IPA with a very memorable name!","Lemke10","Sep 25, 2012"

I would definitely like to try this beer a little bit fresher (I'd expect it to be a little bit hopier), but unfortunately due to it being brewed almost across the country and it being sold in a 12-pack it picked up a little bit of age on it's journey. Still nothing to write home about, but not bad for a beer in a variety 12-pack. I wouldn't buy a 6-pack of this, but would maybe consider the 12-pack again.","jaasen64","Jun 19, 2012"

The nose shows earth, green herbs and mint, and toasted white bread. That shows through on the tongue too,with a little malt sweetness and some breadiness leading to a cleansing dryness. A very drinkable brew that is a nice change from the alcoholic hop teas that pass for ""IPAs"" these days. I wish it were a little prettier in the glass, but I'll look for this again.","MCDuhamel","Feb 05, 2012"

Sticky, unbalanced, harsh. The bottle’s the last of a six pack purchased a little over a month ago, which could mean it’s a couple months old at this point (depending on how long it took to reach the shelves) but I’m told the first five tasted the same.

Herbal, resinous hop nose, with a bit of estery fruit as well. The hops are up front and persist throughout but are in pretty good balance with the malt which makes sense since they are going for a more English style.

Tastes nice, more malt than I would have expected, but still very much on the hoppy side. The malty, caramel flavor gives over quickly to the floral hops and finishes semi-dry with a nice lingering bitterness. It feels good on the tongue, on the thin side of medium-bodied.

The flavor followed much of the same, owing that nice light floral hoppiness, but never having enough of it to really push it all the way forward. Nice little bite of bitter on the back of the tongue, and a slightly fruit finish, with apples coming through very clearly, especially in the aftertaste. The Mouthfeel was a little thin, maybe a touch watery, but had more then decent carbonation. A bit of a slickness to it as well. Superbly session able though as this was a very easy drinker and I could have thrown this one down all night long to be honest.","mikesgroove","May 26, 2011"

Not sure what's so particularly English about this one other than the use of the Boadicea Hops which are relatively unknown other than they are named for a Celtic/England warrior queen.

As I mentioned, the hops are a little unusual, though they seem like the appropriate regional hops, they just don't normally appear in this style, so I don't think that it is the spawn of a clone-brew...at least not one I am familiar with.

There is some caramel & biscuit toned malts are in there, some mango, some odd stinkiness, and some nice floral notes. This one is pretty damned bitter, which is a good thing but there isn't a lot of flavor backing up that bitterness. There is some resiny and fruity hop character but really you kind of have to strain for it. The malt is one of the most defined things in the aroma. I generally like my IPAs on the bitter and dry side with very little malt character, there is little doubt that these descriptors fit the bill with this one but I'm dying for a little bit more hop character beyond bitterness.

I find the aroma to be a very vague, maybe a slightly wheat/grass deal? Pretty disappointing for an introduction. It proves to be a medium-light bodied beer and the mouth feel follows suit, smooth with a little tingle. The flavor features a pretty unattractive leafy bite, and yes, I get the vegetable thing like everyone else. Seems to be an appropriate analogy, though thankfully a tolerably mild presence. I find this to be a pretty mediocre ale at best. It's drinkable enough if you're okay with the somewhat odd flavor.

This beer may be a little bit too bitter for relatively small malt backbone I am detecting. In the finish there is a very interesting buttery, nutty sort of flavor that is quite nice.

Nice balance in the nose, and if this is any indication of the taste, I'll be pleasantly surprised. Yep, great balance here. I'm really digging the lightly toasted cracker, biscuit-like maltiness of this brew which is in perfect harmony with the lightly bitter, herbal hops, that have just a touch of citrus on the back end, namely some orange marmalade-like juiciness. Drys out on the finish, with a decent, bitter aftertaste. Body is crisp with the perfect amount of carbonation. This is a tasty beer, and I really do love the balance. I really wish I could find an English bitter or mild pale with this kind of flavor on a regular basis. If this thing weighed in at 5% ABV or less, it would be one of the best session brews around. But I'm really digging it the way it is. Not sure why the scores are so low on this one.

Medium-bodied, dry and almost grainy in texture, pumpernickel and rye, hops have plenty of edge and nervosity, only offer traces of citrus, pine or florality.

There isn't the caramel malt, the touch of diacetyl, and pricklishiness that is often found with an EIPA.

3.8,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Toasted grains and minty hop bitterness up front. Toasted biscuit malt comes on with rising herbal and grassy hop bitterness. A flash of candyish toffee sweetness before orange marmalade and mineral water bitterness in the finish. Lingering toasted malt with citrus accents. Not bad. Medium-bodied with a slightly oily feel. Might be a bit nicer on cask.","alexgash","Feb 20, 2010"

3.67,2.8,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"An earthy and bitter hoppyness hit first followed by a mixture of a light and toffee like malt. The hops also carry a kind of veggie taste. This completely separate hop profile feels layered on top of the malt in the way I taste it. That being said the flavor isn't horrible but the whole beer feels like a one off, maybe not carried all the way through. The mouth feel is too watery and the flavors are good, just in the wrong places, IMHO.","Thur123","Feb 10, 2010"
4.03,12.9,4.5,4,4,4,4,"For many people, this will be a huge turnoff, in fact, I remain skeptical of this beer's prospects for commercial success.

That's what it's like. I didn't find it unpleasant at first, but after a while, it was just too intense, too green, too leafy, too prickly, and too spicy. I can see this being some people's bag - it just wasn't, however, mine.","CrellMoset","Aug 15, 2009"
4.2,17.6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Had this on-tap at the Brick Store Pub. Poured a dark golden with a decent head that left some scant lacing and faded to a thin cap. Smells quite piney and with some firm malt. Rich and balanced. The taste is similar. I won't say this is blow-you-away hoppy, even though with a name like 400 lb monkey you might expect it to be. What it is is very well balanced, with more firm malt in the backbone and lots of piney and citrusy hops. Deftly done. A bit full in the mouth, this is even a bit chewy and a fair pleasure to drink.","Georgiabeer","Aug 05, 2009"
3.45,-3.4,3.5,3.5,3,4,4,"D: Well, as far as IPA standards, this beer really doesn't add up in my eyes. It is malt dominant and the hops are basically an afterthought. Makes things kind of wierd. With that said, it is an easy drinker although it doesn't bite the hell out of you hops. It goes down easy and sits nicely. Has a great quenching ability although it is sweet (very light to medium sweetness overall, nothing too crazy or cloying), and really is refreshing. Can't win em all. This beer doesn't fully succeed but it also doesn't completely fail.","everetends","Jul 26, 2009"
3.98,11.5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The fine folks at Left Hand made the mistake of giving this very nice IPA a name that suggests a bigger beer than this is.... it conjures up images of something big, and delivers instead something good and tasty.","feloniousmonk","Jul 13, 2009"

3.5,-2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"400 lb. Monkey is a little disappointing. I was hoping for a standout IPA, but instead got a nicely balanced IPA that doesn't stand out in any way at all. It wouldn't be hard to improve. Just add more hops. Its balance is its biggest weakness. I guess there might be some out there who prefer balanced IPAs, but I want hop pizzazz in the hop department. Other than that, a little more strength in the nose would also help. Meh. It's above average, but could be better. Definitely worth a try, but I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to track it down. It's a lamb cloaked with a beast's name. Let's not indulge in gratuitous, erroneous nomenclature, guys. There's no need.","prototypic","Jun 04, 2009"
3.85,7.8,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Had this on-tap at the Newstead public house. Poured into pint glass slightly chilled producing a nicely filtered golden color, very clear with a thick head that lasted quite a while. Nose was quite good full hops, sweetness, floral notes in the background. Taste was of the same, not an overly powerful brew of the style but certainly has a great taste with decent mouthfeel, moderate amount of bitterness in the middle but nothing that will kill the palate. A nice beer overall and will be glad to go back and have another soon.","rwdkosak","May 19, 2009"

I was told it was a double IPA and it did not seem to have the smeel or tast of large overhoppiness. The pininess of the hops were present, but not overpowering It could be that it was very well balanced.
