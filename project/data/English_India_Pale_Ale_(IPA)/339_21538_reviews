"Not bad. I would drink it again"
""
""
""
"Pours an orange gold, coppery color with off-white head. Floral notes, light citrus, and some malt on the nose; follows onto the palate. Finishes with a balanced out malt bill. Would have liked more of a hop bite on the finish."
""
""
""
"Don't use my rating as a barometer... I don't usually care for IPA's."
""
"Look- nice, golden brown IPA.. Solid head that dissipates after a bit.. Lacing covers throughout, good looking. Smell- nice, pine, a bit typical for the style. Taste- good, you pick up the floral notes.. More bitter than my favorite IPAs.. Strangely, comes off a tiny bit watered down toward the end of the glass. Feel- a bit of a dry finish. A good, not great IPA."

"A very good tasting beer"

"O- A very good beer. As an E IPA, it has extra citrus flavors that aide its drinkability and enjoyment. Yum."
""
""
""
"Love the design. Tastes a little malty, but good!"
""
""
"D: Very tasty, keeps you coming back for more. Great food beer, great E IPA. One of the best."

"Pours clear Amber copper with thick creamy white head well retained, smells of citrusy floral hops slightly malty, tastes of cooling hop florals with malt notes, light mouthfeel smooth finish. Notable difference in east coast iPad rather than west coast"

"A little too hoppy for me."

"The taste is not bad with slightly yeasty flavor up front with mild bread and light malt toastiness which carries over to a slight tinge of pine/herbal hop flavor in the background with mild spice as it finishes semi-dry. overall this is not a bad beer, but it seems kind of by the numbers English style to me -not my favorite of the style."

"Overall – The flavor was alright, but not really all that hoppy and sorta weak for an IPA. Nothing too outrageously good here."

"O- well brewed Well balanced IPA. One of my favorites in this style of beers."

"O: This one straddles the line of good/okay. It's not unenjoyable by any means, but it's just not what you'd expect from an IPA. It has a strong maltiness and a very restrained hop presence. It drinks extremely well and tastes good, which makes this a prime contender for a session ale at a bar, but it's not something I'd pick up again for the pleasure of home-consumption. Good beer overall, slightly weak by IPA standards."
"12 oz bottle into tulip glass. My second beer from Flying Fish, the first being their Pale Ale. I like this one a lot more. This could almost stand up to most American IPA's in balance and taste. Goes down a little too smooth with not enough bite. Having said that, I enjoy this beer a heck of a lot for a Jersey brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am usually impressed with most flying fish offerings and this one is pretty damn good. Not the biggest English IPA fan but this is drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"HopFish pours a golden color with a small lacing head. There is a sharp but sweet floral aroma. The taste is similar, a sharp hop bite, but with a sweet finish. Nice full flavor, and full body. Overall its a nice IPA, some good flavors, but harsh finish."

"A little too sweet for my tastes, but not bad at all."
"Overall - A solid English IPA. The sourness is a bit odd, but not unpleasant. I could stand to drink a few more, but nothing I'd want to drink on a regular basis."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Eh, a decent english IPA at that, but nothing to go after. Its just drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O--Not bad, but it doesn't meet my expectations for an IPA on several levels."
"Strong IPA with a rather dank hop profile"
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink and has a very good balance between the malts and hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours pale clear gold, some white foam, more around the rings. See through. Strong minty pine nose. Light hoppy taste, thin but bitter. Peppery mouthfeel. Peppermint. Floral. Pretty good, little light on the body."
""
"I think this is a good Summer time beer. It's a IPA that's a little lighter on the overall hopiness. The bite is not overpowering in the begining, and then that mellows into a rich mouth feel. A lightly floral smell helps to open up the flavors of the hops without becoming overpowering. Also it's moderate alcohol content makes this an easy drinking brew on a hot Summer day."
"O- I'd like more hop flavor and aroma. Bitterness is there however."
""
""
""
"Overall I like this beer and it has a definite English feel to it, but the yeast and the hops seem to be a bit off. The yeast seems to impart a biscuity and almost Belgian taste to it and the hops seem to be more on the lines of Pacific Northwest in format. I don't know what they use. It's a good beer and very drinkable! I like it! It's not incredible or awesome, but very satisfying on a warm evening! 3.5 out of 5!"
"This tastes like a failed attempt at blending an East Coast IPA with a West Coast IPA. Perhaps they should give it another go with a modified recipe."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - decent. Drinkable but not overall a huge fan. A lighter IPA for sure."
""
""
"Overall - Good, but certainly not great. I have never been a big fan of EIPAs and this is not one of the few that I have had that is an exception to the rule. Would not get again, generally would not recommend."

"I prefer American IPAs but this is a good beer...an IPA for those that don't care for hop bombs."
""
""
""
""
""
"A meh intro to Flying Fish."
""
""
""
"Acceptable beer on its own, on the soft side when pitted against the style. It won't grab headlines, however there is still a number of beers which it beats."
""
""
""
"Bright golden amber with orange highlights. Solid head, lacing and retention. Citrus up front in the nose followed by biscuity and lightly caramel malts. Taste brings citrus hops with a bit of pine and earth, malt is lightly sweet, slightly caramel and nutty. Medium bodied, maybe a bit too bubbly. Decent drinkable IPA, nothing remarkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice neural gold with two fingers of foam. A mild carbonation stems from a single part of the glass among a mild cloud of yeast. Retention and lacing are good, only real fault is all the suspended yeast. Aroma of some spicy hop with a strong malty background. To my understanding that's dictated by the style. Some citrus present, taken a bit aghast by the malt, used to my hoppy west coast ipa. Taste is really good, nice crisp hops balanced perfectly with the malt. Feel is consistent also, dry finish, no alcohol and very bitter. Overall surprised how much I liked this, quite balanced."
""
""
"Served from a bottle. Light amber color with solid 2-finger head. Aroma is citrus-y, but a bit lacking for an IPA. Taste matches the aroma, solid citrus, but maybe a bit stale in the finish. Overall a solid IPA. However, with all the solid IPA options out there, not sure if I'd make it a go to."
"This beer pours up a clear medium gold with about a one finger head, not much retention, but some risidual lacing. The smell is very citrus, floral, and pine. Malt dominates up front followed by a powerful grapefruit and spicy hop bitter finish. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, medium thick and satisfying. I'd drink this again."
""
""
""
""
"This one really surprised me. It was so easy to drink and had a great balance of mild bitterness with a touch of sweetness. I will make sure to get some more of this. Just remember this isn't supposed to be Sculpin or Stone IPA and the like, so please don't review it like it is. This is an EIPA, and a good one at that."
""
""
""
"Pours a copper amber hue with a medium lasting off white head. Aroma and Taste of caramel malt, floral citrus hops, yeast and fruity esters. Palate is a medium body with moderate carbonation. Finish is caramel malt, citrus floral hops, some yeast, seems a bit on the malty side. Overall a typical IPA nothing really stand out but good drinking brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid score here on my travels from Boston to MD and back over Thanksgiving. Will look for this one next time I head back down in that area."

"Taste is jammy marmalade, raisiny alcohol, medicinal herb hint. It's balanced but with hop bite just getting the edge at finish & aftertaste. It's spritzy with leafy medicinal, faintly orange-rind finish and bitterness, with a little mineral. It's very good and enjoyable, if a bit simple and slightly thin."
""

""
""
"Nothing is wrong with this beer, but nothing is exceptional either."
""
"Off tap at Jack Dunnigan's in the airport this beer was an apricot color with some golden highlights. The head, formed by lots of rising carbonation, was beige colored and displayed nice retention and moderate lacing. The aroma was of American hops, some orange and mango notes (Amarillo hops?) and a note of must. The flavors were rather average I thought, being mostly a blend of crystal malt, pale malt and citrus from the hops. It was not as bitter as most American-made IPAs and though sessionable it seemed uninspired. The body was medium, the mouthfeel average and the carbonation a little too high."

"O- Overall a decent brew."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the insane fruitiness in the nose. These notes blended beautifully and sweetly with big piney hops. The following taste was almost as nice, but all the components become a bit muddled by the end with all of the stark flavorings crashing together. Strong effort for the style, and always happy to drink local."
""
"Pours a almost clear burnt orange color with a tight half finger head. This beer leaves rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is of citrus notes along with a herbal smell and a touch of dark fruit sweetness. The taste follows suit with a citrus and herbal flavor up front. This gives way to a dark fruit sweetness and then a very slight earthy bite. The mouthfeel is low to moderatly carbonated. Overall it is not bad. A nice blend of hops and malt, enjoyable but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty decent beer. Not one that will knock your socks off but easy drinking and enjoyable nonetheless."
"Mouthfeel is fine on tap, smooth, a little creamy, medium bodied with moderate carbonation. This isn’t a bad beer but it left me feel a bit uninspired and maybe a little bored."
""
""
"Mouthfeel: I thought there was just a tad too much carbonation here. It took away from some of the more subtle flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Certainly not a bad beer, but perhaps I need to try this again, because if the flavors didn't seem so faded it may have been better."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a huge bubbly white head that shows great retention and lace. Smells of earthy and citrusy hops, with a bit of bready malt, some mineral aromas, and a bit of yeasty funk. Taste is a nice compromise between malt and hop. Earthy citrus meets bready mineral water and a hint of yeast funk. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a slick mouthfeel. Meh. This one is ok, but there's either some wild yeast working in this bottle or the beer was kept on the yeast too long after fermentation. No bottle dating so there's no telling how old this bottle is."
""
""
""
""
""
"Perhaps I've been unlucky with this bottle and will become enamoured with my remaining 5 - in which case I will change this review accordingly!"
""
""
"This beer was very nice and tasty! Good looking beer with an outstanding white cap that left a bit of foam on my glass. Classic micro brew scent. Some pine scents on the nose, but also very malty. Not overly hoppy, but you must classify this as an IPA! Cannot see through the glass, much like a great hefeweizen. Nice tasting, buscuit base. Very pleased with the finish! Very fine brew!"
""
""
""
"*Note had at the brewery and it was a completely different beer. Sooo much better. Notes of rose and flower. So good fresh."
""
"On tap at The Office. Pours golden with a thick white head. Aroma is of citrusy hops, some pale and caramel malt. Medium, crisp body. Citrucy hops, biscuit malt and hints of caramel fill the mouth. Finish is medium and hoppy. Light, easy drinking IPA."
""
"Decent though not outstanding IPA. Nugget hops and lots of malt to make it bittersweet and the malting contributes to drinkability, as does the understated carbonation. Light orange body. Orange taste and slight orange aroma. Middling mouthfeel.Guessing IBU 55-60."
""
"o - Overall a pretty average IPA. Nose had the faintest smell of hops to it, while the taste had none really at all. Not one of Flying Fish's finest and not one I'd seek out again."
""
""
"O: Good, but standard. Neither exciting, nor a letdown."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I didn't really like this, but that is because I really don't like English Style anything. The choice of malts and hops are spot on for the style but really not my choice to enjoy. I will score this with the style in mind though and if English IPA's are your thing, this might be worth searching out."

"O - Good rep of the style with rich caramel malts and tropical fruit hop aromas. If it finished more bitter, rather than sweet, this would be great."
"SOLID IPA, NOT MUST HAVE!"
"Overall, this is a mild example of the style. The hops are toned down and the malt is over played. The balance just isn't there. This would be a great English style Pale Ale."
"Pours a hazy honey orange with a 1 inch puffy orange-white head that settles to an oily cap on the top of the beer. Thick foamy rings of lace form on the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is floral and soapy with a citrus zest aroma as well. Taste is of malt and citrus zest with maybe some grassy herbal flavors as well. A lower level of carbonation with a smooth and slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good English IPA and my first beer from Flying Fish. I probably wouldn't get this one again though."
"I originally thought this was a tasty Pale Ale. Then I found out it was a IPA -- I was a little shocked because of the bitterness was kind of low. I like my IPA's very bitter but this Hopfish IPA had a sweet citrus and piney taste that kept me asking for another."
"O: On smelling the nose I was ready for disappointment, but this turned out pretty darn good. This is a balanced East Coast IPA, get any thought of San Diego out of your head because you wont get it. Enjoy a complex flavourful balanced ale. Good job Flying Fish."
"D: Overall a decent IPA that has a good mix of everything and a reasonable abv."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy light brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is overwhemingly of hops. Taste is also very hoppy, a touch of citrus. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, while not a bad beer, I thought it was lacking in balance."
"o - overall, very good beer. nice and smooth and great for a malty ipa."
"D - No Bitterness, low carbonation, not sweet, which was nice."
"This IPA pours out as a golden yellow color with a decent sized head on it. The head doesn't give off too much lacing really. The smell has a pretty good hoppiness to it but it's nothing too crazy. The taste has an average amount of bitterness mixed with a malt body. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side, not a lot of complexity here. Overall to me its an average IPA. It's worth trying if your trying to ween yourself into the style."
"O: This was just really not a very good beer. Pass."
"Medium body, higher carbonation, drinks okay. Pretty boring flavor, would like to see more of a hop profile too."
"Dark honey colored amber. One full finger of head when receded left some scant lacing. Sweet malt, biscuit and caramel in the nose. Maybe even a touch of tea too. Man.... This is a malt bomb to me. Huge turnoff. Comes across pretty creamy and smooth. Caramel like taste. Hop bite is non existent. Not at all what I am looking for."
"Poured into a standard pint a slightly hazed burnt orange with a thinner long lasting white head,a big sweetish biscuit malt base reallty stood out at first sniff than herbal/leafy hop comes thru.Flavors of caramel and sweet biscuit mixed with herbal hops makes for a pretty good EIPA,this is what this beer is all about.Its not a bad beer for the style,if your looking for an in your face hoppy IPA this is not for you."
"Poured a hazy yellow-orange with a small white head. True to the name, lots of nice hops in the nose, and on the tongue as well. Citrusy hops with a nice bitterness, and a bready malt base. Light-medium body, nice and drinkable. Not too harsh or strong for an IPA."
"Hides the alcohol ok."
"O-A decent enough IPA, but when there are so many other better options out there, why would I choose this one? Its not a bad beer, just nothing that makes me want to have another."
"Nothing offensive in this baby, it does have a dry finish and seems pretty balanced."
"Overall - Not a bad session beer but not something I'd have everyday either, only due to its dry finish. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"D - This is a fresh, clean-drinking brew. Not quite a traditional English IPA, and not really an American IPA. Maybe not an IPA at all, given its breadiness. Yet highly drinkable."
"Picked this up at Total Wine/ Tempe, awesome store. Had some of these guys Exit Series, and was excited to try one of the regulars. Nice amber pour, nice caramel soft nose. This is a very creamy and smooth beer, and very tasty. This is the kind of beer i wish there were more of, smooth, tasty, and under 7% so you can have a few. Very highly recommend this, it's in AZ for all you CA folks...i will be picking up more of this when I head back down."
"I normally wouldn't want this in an IPA but for some reason they really get the balance down good on this one because it still leaves that pretty bitter aftertaste. My only objection to this beer is that I wish they had freshness dates on it because I think mine might be kind of out of date because I know my store doesn't get brand new 6 packs of this stuff every week. I'd love to have this on tap and probably will since I live in NJ. My first flying fish beer and definitely not my last. The malt and unfiltered taste reminds me of the taste you get from the cricket hill ipa but this one has more hops to balance so I like this one better. Not a hop bomb but definitely an amazingly balanced IPA."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a thin beige head that retains ok. The aroma is mostly grainy, along with some faint citrusy, pine and herbal hops, fruity esters and just the suggestion of alcohol. The taste is a step up from the aroma, with big citrus and herbal hops upfront, along with some caramel and grainy malt, fruity esters, biscuit and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is on the thick side and grainy, and drinkability is good. A decent stab at an IPA, but the grainy mouthfeel and inauspicious aroma hold this beer back."
" Extremely smooth, and I mean extremely. There was a copious amount of carbonation that really helped set everything in motion. A good clean, crisp feel was what I was used to, but this was much more mellow and smooth, and very rich in texture. You could really feel what was going in. Very nice and a welcome little treat. I was starting to warm up to this one actually. Superb. I could have had another and another again. It was just light and flavorful, but not nearly anything that would have held you back from it at all. I just was sitting there and all of a sudden realized it was gone. I had no idea that it was going to be going away that quickly. Really a great little ale."
"D - definitely very much drinkable"
"It pours a fairly clear (for the style) amber color with a fingers worth of head. Lacing and retention are below average. The smell is primarily pale malts, with some citrus and floral hops. The taste is very smooth and primarily bitter. The crisp pale malts, citrus, and smooth floral hops all come together for a very easy drinking bitter beer. The aftertaste does have a bit of resiny hops to make this feel more like an IPA. The mouthfeel is a little light, but can be forgiven. The drinkability is absolutely exceptional, I could see this disappearing very quickly. A solid beer and my first from the brewery - curious to how this will differ from their normal pale ale."
"Poured a clear, light orange with a small, white head that mostly diminished. The aroma was light to moderate caramel malt and moderate Pine and citrus hops. The initial flavor was moderately sweet, lightly acidic and bitter, while the finish was moderately to heavily sweet and moderately bitter with and average duration. The flavor was malt then pine and citrus hops. The light to medium body was a little watery at first and then dry with fizzy carbonation and a moderately astringent finish."
"Very easygoing and smooth, and so non-offensiveness you wouldn't notice you downed the pack."
"D - very smooth drink due to its malt/hop balance. I can notice the diminished hop character as this is not an American IPA, but actually an attempt at an English IPA."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty solid IPA, not particularly English. Overall a dry, bitter citrusy beer thats not particularly malty, but with decent balance."
"Drinkability: Displays a good degree of balance, as it's not particular malty, nor particularly hoppy, though, that's not always what folks are looking for from their IPA's."
"I think I could have several of these to expand the enjoyment of the subtle flavors, but on its own, one bottle or glass doesn't pack the most memorable punch."
"Overall this is a good IPA. Not an IPA you need to search out for but if you see it on draft it is a good choice over the average domestic selection. Recommended over non-craft selections, but nothing to wax poetic about."
"Very drinkable, I just won't be reaching for another soon."
"D: Like I said, almost too light for it's style, but extremely easy to drink. A great session beer, and I would pick it up again if it was at my local store."
"Pours a light orange amber with a touch of cludiness and a short head. Smells somewhat grainy, but with a fruity overlay and some grassiness. The taste is grainier still, and the hop fruitiness tends to get lost, although there is a lingering bitterness and a little squirt of grapefruit juice near the end. Not as grainy in the mouthfeel, although overall this a fairly bland IPA. I've enjoyed their Belgian style beers more."
"D - Good. The alcohol is hidden nicely. Very drinkable."
"Not bad for my first FF offering, I'm interested in trying more from them."
"(Revised with 12 oz bottle consumed in October 2013)"
"Drinkability: I could have several. Just a great earthy, floral beer that is not overly hopped. One of the more distinct IPAs I have had that I wish I could get here."
"drinkability: fantastic brew. its not a hop bomb ale but it's a decent selection. could have used more hops"
"Overall this was a middle-of-the-road IPA, nothing done terribly and nothing done terribly well either. Not worth seeking out but if there are no other options (as was the case at Drinker's) it's not a bad choice."
"Drinkability:While this beer plays true to style, it's a tough one for me to like given it's aggressiveness. There are some flavors in here that taste a little off to my palate."
"Another very drinkable flying fish, brew, I need to have a few more of their brews more regularly."
"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a large foamy head with OK retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of Noble hops mix with some citrus notes is quite refreshing and provide the impression of a Belgian IPA. Taste is also a great mix between some slightly sweet malt notes with little caramel notes and a unique mix between some Noble Hops and West Coast hops bring a nice floral tone with some citrus and dry notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. I though this was a great refreshing beer under the sun."
"M: Good feel"
"This one is definitely a lighter IPA; perhaps a good starting point for one wishing to get into hoppier beers. That said, I really like each quality of this beer, but do think it would benefit from an overall, though not necessarily huge, intensity boost."
"UPDATE: Tried this again - 08/25/10. It was bottled today. I was interested to try this fresh, for obvious reasons. I'll restate my previous opinion/observation that this beer has striking ESB qualities - in mouthfeel and flavor. If you take away the soft, tropical fruit essence to the hop aroma - different (unique?) but nice - you have an ESB. They nailed the mouthfeel and and flavors of the English ESB's I adore - one of the few US breweries I feel has done it. But, really, going into this, I'm thinking IPA and it doesn't meet my expectations (of American versions). I'm willing to offer, however, that the HopFish is best viewed as a unique take (strictly in the hop character) on a true English IPA. Unfortunately, I haven't had much experience at all trying English IPA's - Deuchar's IPA from Scotland is the closest I've come to it, and even that isn't exactly what I'm getting at here. The closest thing to Deuchar's IPA I've had over here is Left Hand's 400 Pound Monkey. The closest thing I've had to Flying Fish's HopFish has been Bateman's XXXB (excellent ale!). Anyway, if you can locate a bottle of the Bateman's XXXB, try it, and imagine it with an almost pina colada hop aroma and flavor. That's what I feel is going on with the HopFish. Interesting brew, for sure. Not what I'm accustomed to as far as American IPA's go."
"Pours a clear amber, like a medium color honey, with a big fluffy head. Both the flavor and the aroma are malty and sweetly raw, like the freshly boiled wort of a beer before the yeast starts it work. The hops are fresh and flowery, with a little bit of a piny finish. There is a little bitterness on the end, but it is sweet and citrusy, like a mild marmalade. The mouthfeel is slick and slightly flat."
"The mouth feel also leaves quite a bit to be desired, the carbonation is there but it all tastes rather acidic. Which leads to the drinkability. This beer is nice and refreshing, but the whole time I feel like its stripping away at my mouth."
"O: I remember this being much better in the past, perhaps the recipe has changed, maybe my palate has gotten better, or maybe the Hopsecutioner I just drank just dwarfs this, but it's very bland. It's very drinkable, but there's not much going on here, at least it's available at a good price."
"D: A good interpretation of the style, and I must admit I am a bit surprised at this one in that I have noticed that Flying Fish brews tend to be hit or miss. A decent session IPA that won't eviscerate your palate too much."
"A light mouthfeel for sure. Its almost watery but theres nothing wrong with that. Looking forward to getting more of this when it heats up this summer! (its only feb...ugh)"
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1/4"" off-white head above the clear amber brew. Head falls slowly, with average to good lacing. Aroma is fruity and earthy. Taste starts biscuity malts, lightly citrus in the middle, and closes with a medium bitterness. Mouthfeel is very smooth, and drinkability is good."
"I'd probably have given this beer a much higher score if it was a Pale Ale by style."
"A: Tons of active carbonation streaming up through the beer though the head stays pretty consistent at a pencil's thickness, the color is a medium copper, the head is thick and tightly packed and leaves some lacing as the beer drops - 3.50, S: The nose is quite biscuity and bready, there's also a decent amount of citrus that comes through and a mild orange-like sweetness - 3.00, T: Though there is a noticeable hop presence - this beer skirts the line between a pale ale and an IPA in my opinion, some pine and pineapple jumbled with some caramel malts - 3.50, M: There's a little syrupy-ness which provides a smoothness to the mouth feel - 4.00, D: A decent IPA, pretty standard - 3.50"
"P.S.: Stone Ruination is great just packs a real wallop and may not be the most sessionable brew, but there are different beers for different occassions."
"This is a subtle brew, and I prefer more hopiness. However, it's a very soild, drinkable ale."
"This is a good brew, very tasty and refreshing. This would be a very good brew to drink in the summer at a BBQ. Good."
"Lots of malt in this guy, hops get a little lost. At first I was really disappointed but now I realize its an English IPA and that makes a lot more sense. Most of the hop bitterness comes in an aftertaste, no strong hop aroma. Beer has a medium body, overall OK, I really wanted a hoppy beer. Oh well."
"Mouthfeel is light and dry. Carbonation is spot on. Very gentle carbonation, just how I like it. Outstanding drinkability, if I had another bottle I would have it right now."
"D - I wish I could have had it sooner as I'm sure it only would have been better than this but it's not awful. It just needs a bit of work to get up there. The hops are really lacking, otherwise it's drinkable in this form."
"Drinkability: As I noted in my bottle review, this beer drinks easily. I think it is a bit better on draft than from the bottle even though the carbonation seems less. However as I noted in my bottle review, given its balance of flavors my feeling is this beer is much closer to an English style IPA than to an American style IPA. I could easily have a second, and I'll certainly drink it again (in fact, I just did ☺ )."
"D - After having the Extra Pale Ale I was rather surprised with this IPA...almost boarders on being an English IPA as the hops are pretty mellow...granted there are some better IPA's out there...but this one is worth a try"
"Taste is like an oktoberfest, mmm. Looks like the hops have fallen out but this isn't bad I think it's quite tasty."
"I tend to like a stronger, more hoppy IPA, but I wouldn't mind this one again. Give it a shot if you're in the area."
"Drinkability: Overall, it was a decent offering just not my cup of tea when it comes to IPA's. Although the hops are present, the malt really overshadows everything else in the glass. I really did like this, but if the malt was toned down this would be a regular in my rotation."
"Had a nice pour at a local bar into an American pint glass. Copper hue, with a nice long-lasting and lacing head. I was surprised to see that some people mentioned a lack of hops in the nose and the taste; maybe it was a bad batch or being accustomed to so many crazy-hopped double ipa's currently on the market, but I found the nose to be both floral and bitter hoppy, combined with traces of grapefruit, orange, and lime. Also detected a malty sweetness. The flavor was very similar, with the fruitiness up front, giving way to malty sweetness, and finished off with dry hop bitterness. The bitterness lingered significantly in the aftertaste. Definitely a malty, fairly full bodied specimen for an ipa, but the aroma/flavor made it go down easy. A very good session ipa."
"I thought this beer was way too malty for an IPA. Am I missing something? I thought it looked great, carbonation was fine, had a nice head, but when I was looking for that kick of hops...nothing was there. Did I get a bad case??? I don't know, but until then, I'll assume that this brew is too malty and short on the hops."
"Overall- Leans more towards an ESB. Tasty and sessionable for sure."
"Brilliant buttery hop action with a terrific nose to this beer."
"m/d - A bit sticky yet thin body. I think they either need to up the bittering hops or bring down some of the sweetness to get it right for the style. Easy to drink and price right locally."
"Aromas of a muddy peach first come to mind. Very stagnant herbal quality to it. The taste turns to a slightly flat malt flavor that has a maybe some oxidation, paper quality to it. The medium mouth feel also lends it self to a sweeter quality to the beer kicking the much needed bitterness to the side. It finishes with a pseudo dryness in the middle of the tongue but leaves a earthy aftertaste on my palette. Overall It's ok in my book."
"Nice golden amber, with a fair to average head. Smelled a bit tart and (obviously) hoppy. Taste really didnt do it for me, I've had mush better in the way of 'hoppy' beers. The beer is very drinkable, but not necessarily in a good way, more because it is slighlty watered down. meh("
"D - I could see drinking this from the bottle at a tailgate but it's not one to seek out."
"Drink is ok the bitterness does settle enough to have a few more. For easy drinking and a very solid IPA."
"An IPA that was a pleasure to drink. Quite enjoyable. Flying Fish seems to get passed over by many in favor of the other philly area beers and that, to me, is a shame."
"I like this one."
"I had this on tap at Swedes Inn. It pours a clear gold with a medium white head, minimal lacing. The aroma had pine and citrus notes, but not overwhelming. The flavor was crisp and clean. There were mild citrus notes and the finish was plesantly bitter. Hopfish is medium bodied with average carbonation. It went down very smooth. A very good beer. In my opinion more of an APA but still enjoyable."
"i want more! glad to know this is more or less local! i plan to pick up a case of the SN Torpedo and compare."
"Drinkability- great long lasting finish that leaves you wanting another sip, a pretty good ipa with rich tasting hops and worth another look for sure"
"Overall this was a nice drinking IPA and one of my favorite beers to give my friends who are hesitant of trying IPA's, because it has that slight bitterness to it complimented by the hops which helps introduce a novice to them without turning them off."
"Sessionable, but why would you? Overall, not impressed."
"D - Mild enough to go down easy..."
"Very light amber, more so yellow, in hue, quite clear with thick and active bubbles and huge, dense head of foam. The nose comprised of grapefruit, dried white fruits, mild floral swipes, neither really malty nor hoppy, light presence with strong persistence, not heaviness. Medium-bodied, rich foaminess makes it feel heavier until the suds subside. Non-threateningly bitter, serves up grapefruit to orange zest, sweet spices and mild fruitiness. Stays consistent without any dips nor crests. In keeping, has a calm and collected finish, very smooth, rich while easy to keep sipping."
"For an IPA, this one goes down easy. There is some bitterness, but like Blue Point's Hoptical Illusion, it isn't overpowering. You could taste the hops in the beer. So overall, this IPA is great because the bitterness is not too prevalent in the beer. I strongly encourage a friend or two to session this beer."
"Local brewery for me, but I was really disappointed. Really weak hop flavor for an IPA. Really not on the caliber of the better IPAs. Not a ""bad"" brew, but there are so many better IPAs out there that this one is made pretty much worthless."
"This wasnt my style of IPA. A decent beer I guess but thin and sweet. Thanks for the chance Kenny."
"Drinkability- Would consider this a session IPA. Highly drinkable but not light on hops or taste. If you are looking for an IPA to kick your tastebuds ass this aint it."
"D: there is just enough hops to make this a summer quencher session ipa though drinks more like a pale."
"D - Tasty, sure, but this really drinks more like a pale ale. Unfortunately, its malt-forward profile overshadows the hop bitterness. That isn't to say that Hop Fish is a bad brew, it's just not quite to style."
"I wouldnt go out of my way to get this again, but if it showed up in a box on my doorstep I would place it immediately into the fridge for consumption :)"
"D: nice session AIPA. I really enjoyed this as a middle of the session IPA. nothing over the top but very drinkable."
"Decent beer, but definitely not an American IPA in my opinion. The smell was of fresh respberries, and the taste was so syrupy sweet.. tasted like raspberries over and over. Then I looked at the beer menu and saw that they had a raspberry beer on tap. Perhaps the glasses aren't properly cleaned in between customers? I would try this beer again, but not because it was great - just to see if it was really raspberry or not."
"Mediocore..."
"Very drinkable but definitely could use more hops"
"12 oz. bottle poured into a Flying Fish American pint glass. This Flying Fish poured a clear amber that had a fizzy white head of foam that was about 1/2 inch in height. It didn't take long for this fizzy head of foam to completely fizzle away into a few bubbly islands and a handful of white rings along the edge. It had a medium sized aroma of tea mix, toasted malts, caramel, citrus hops, and a slight pinch of grapefruit. The taste started off with lightly toasted malts and then out of nowhere, the taste shot into the hoppy/crispy side of the beer. That side of the beer was filled with citrus fruits, caramel, citrus hops, a small slice of grapefruit, and some pine needles at the finish. It was a light to medium bodied beer with a nice crispy aftertaste of citrus hops, grapefruit, and a slight touch of toasted malts. Not the hoppiest IPA out there, but it would make for a nice lightly hoppy session IPA. I wouldn't mind having this one again in the future. One of the better Flying Fish beers."
"D: Fell quickly. Not one of the elites, but a fine IPA - sessionable even."
"D: This one just didn't do it for me. Thanks anyway, Alan :)"
"A clear red amber with a big white head and spotty lace. It has a fairly herbal aroma with some spicey wheat, malt and a touch of lemon. The taste seems to take on more of a floral hops with good bitterness and an odd, sweet malt. It is tangy with a spritely carbonation and the body is kind of light but there is a touch of welcome viscocity. Quite drinkable if the bitterness doesn't overwhelm a bit. An interesting grassy-wheat edge. May not meet everyone's approval but it's at least passable IPA territory, a little better I think."
"I'd rate it higher as an English IPA, but not much."
"There was something about this beer that I cannot put my finger on that I did not enjoy. As a whole, this was a solid brew, but it wasn't really exceptionally in any sense. It was kind of just a mediocre IPA to me that could have been something more. I was not disappointed, but I also wasn't thrilled."
"Pours a clear orange amber with a massive head off a very firm pour. And the head sticks around too. Metallic acorn nose. But very subdued. Flavor is a bit woody and a bit too sweet (IMO). Seems to calm down on the sweetness as I move on. Caramel-like apple tones are also there. Feel is good. Nice carbonation and a good liquid feel. Overall seems a bit too tangy to be able to down more than one in a go. Well worth trying, it just seems like the edges are a bit too rough."
"D- Refreshing + enjoyable = drinkable."
"D: This is good beer but there are a lot better examples of the style. I do like the malty backbone though."
"Taste mild hop bitter with model hop flavor, all amid a sea of malt sweetness. Soured caramel and cheesy hop aged. Not the most pleasing experience. Mouthfeel is thick, which would be good to the flavors around if they were pleasant. Incredible lacing on the inside of the glass."
"Drinkability - You could have a few in one sitting. However, I wouldn't try it again."
"This is a decent attempt, and has something going for it, but not enough to it to cover up minor ""flaws""/drawbacks. Too thin for the style, though it is easy enough to get through a couple of these. Not high on my list of IPA's."
"Very light yet has decent substance with almost a belgian spicey quality on the finish. Same tropical notes with little caramel malt. Not overly complex but a beer that is easily drinkable."
"Hmm, seems to have more of a English IPA malt profile - a strong, almost boozy, but light caramel malt, with fruity American hops. Overall, not a bad IPA, just not the most complex. It gets points for balance I suppose, as there's a pleasant maltiness, but the almost sweet grapefruit hops are just on par for an IPA. Not a bad beer, but it's in a tough field."
"D- It is alright. I probably wouldn't get it again but am glad I got to try it."
"Pours a clear copper hue with a nice two finger white head that dies down to a thin layer that lasts throughout. Smell is an enjoyable blend of grassy dirt hops, caramel malt, and a sweet corn-like odor, I like it a lot. Flavor doesn't exactly match up to the smell which in this case is a bad thing. Much more dull on the tongue with an initial pine hop that fades to a dull topsoil-like flavor. Aftertaste is a caramel/citrus blend. Mouthfeel is a medium creamy body with a fair amount of carbonation. Decent beer, just nothing I'll seek out. Glad to have the opportunity."
"Flavor starts with an acidic almost lemony hop kick. Sharp bitterness, lightly malty."
"I wish I would have picked this beer up a month ago; it would have been a great summer beer. Refreshing, light, with enough of a hops kick to remind you you're drinking an IPA, but not too much that you can't taste a thing for the rest of the night. A different and welcomed approach to a classic style."
"Not a bad IPA, but unremarkable. Worth a shot."
"Overall a pretty easy to drink IPA with a respectable ABV. The flavor is a bit lacking however."
"The beer pours a nice gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderfully balanced aroma that boasts of pale, bisquit, and carapils malts along with a mild hop bitterness. The taste is good. It has a smooth, bitter flavor. It goes down easy and finishes hoppy with some light bisquit flavor. The palate is dominated with hops, but the pale malts add to a well rounded taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's pretty standard American IPA, but it drinks well. This is a good session beer even at 6.3%"
"D: Definitely a bit odd, but quite enjoyable. I wouldn't mind haven't some more of this one."
"The drinkability is Average at best for the style. MK"
"Pours a clear pale amber color with a shallow off white head that fades fairly quickly. Spotty lacing generated. The smell is faint, but you can get flora hops. Medium bodied, the mouth feel is well carbonated and a nice hop character lends a nice extra side of things. The flavor is mild with a balance between the malt and hops, but it finishes with a piny breath that lingers appropriately. A reasonable drinker. I will certainly enjoy the rest of the sixer. It seems like this would be a nice session beer, although 6.3% ABV is on the edge."
"D- A decent beer through and through. I could spend an evening drinking this."
"O: Crisp, light and refreshing IPA. Not as hoppy as others....lacks the overall hop ""punch"" that other IPA's have."
"overall, i really enjoy flying fish's HopFish. It's the perfect blend of hops and malts that makes one of the better balanced beers i've had in quite some time. i look forward to trying another one of their beers soon (possibly the belgian dopple)."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, little fizzy off-white head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is malty, sweet, and caramel. The taste is sweet malty, basically no trace of hops/citrus, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, but a different IPA to me."
"This beer has definite session potential. While not ground-breaking, it is a solid brew in its own right, and offers a nice style example insomuch as it shows that just because it's an IPA, doesn't mean it has to be dominated by hops. Quite enjoyable on a lovely spring afternoon such as this."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, good kick, good representation of style, although I like a little more flavor in my IPA’s and there are others that I’d choose in the style, this is a good beer that I could go with for a long time."
"D - I've been consistently and unexpectedly impressed with Flying Fish beers (especially given that I've been consistently underwhelmed with the counterpart, Magic Hat); this one is solid, not the best hoppy IPA I've ever had, but definitely a good beer with a nice solid flavor that I could drink for a little while"
"This poured a very clear orange colour with an off-white head about an inch high. Lacing immediately formed as the head slowly fell, a little clumpy and thick but not a great quantity. Citrusy hops were evident as soon as the bottle was cracked - grapefruit and sweet tarts for the most part, a little grassy too. Very grassy hop flavour with some grapefruit and pine resin backing, bit of malt and moderate bitterness. Quite fruity, actually, with a bit of spice in the finish. Lingering hops. Medium body and carbonation. Not bad, but the choice of hops doesn't quite work for me. It reminds me a bit of a double IPA that a bunch of us made a while back, I think the Centennial version."
"Overall, I was disappointed after finally trying this one. Lack of full, robust hop flavoring common in IPA's left me wanting. I may try it again on tap somewhere, if only to support the local economy."
"This is a nice quaffable beer; it certainly strikes the balance between quaffability and hop character that should define the style. It is not one of the more aggressive versions of the style, but never fear, it is still enjoyable and hoppy enough for all but the seriously hop-deranged."
"Overall-Not my favorite IPA but certainly very good, At the price point, I could easily make it a staple in my fridge."
"When I tried this beer back in August, on tap, my thoughts were ""I was disappointed by this beer, as I was really looking forward to a nice IPA. I may try it again, but not anytime soon."". Now, four months later, and on cask, I find it a very good beer that I would be happy to have again. Not sure why the big difference, just glad I took a second chance on it."
"Thanks JB"
"A solid beer. I did not pour it, but rather drank right out of bottle so I can't really judge the appearance. The smell and the taste were both sufficently hoppy without being over powering. This created a very smooth drinkable beer, with an execlent mouthfeel. If you like IPAs this is most certainly a good beer to try. Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability: Really more of an English style than an American, this beer is well-balanced and flavorful - just not what you expect from an American IPA"
"Cheers!"
"Sure, could have a few of these."
"Cloudy glowing orange gold. Short sand colored head of mixed size bubbles with some staying power that eventually settles leaving a spray of dust. Steady streams of carbonation hit the surface. Light orange blossom and caramel aromas mixed some rind notes are present, but nothing overly IPA-distinct. The flavor starts with a light citrus rind element supported by a bit of malt sweetness. Finishes citrus juice  orange and lemon  tart and sweet with a minimal amount of hop bite. A lemon juice tone overlays it all, and the finish is short, thankfully, as this became less drinkable as it warmed ever so slightly. Medium-light body with a flaccid mouthfeel, the carbonation makes this barely tolerable. Utterly unenjoyable, with a preponderance of lemon rind/juice flavors. A disappointment."
"While not flawed, nor is it interesting. While the name HopFish calls to mind other locals like Hop Devil, Hop Wallop, Hops Infusion, and Hop Hog, its more in line with Cricket Hill's Hopnotic IPA, a self described training wheel IPA."
"Not a spectacular IPA, but worth a look. Contains the wrong hop profile for my tastes, and even with its malt presence, not truly balanced."
"A likeable mildish IPA. Good stuff."
"Tastes of spicy hops and is very citrusy, but I cannot distinguish what type of citrus was used. Moderately dry hoppy backfinish that complements the alcohol. It left a little too much pine/grassy backtaste for me. Medium bodied, not clingy. Very smooth for an IPA. A very nice session beer. Could have been a little more complex in the taste."
"Overall a nice tasting beer, but not a great ipa. This one i got may be a little older and had some hops mellow out, but it reminds me more of an esb than ipa. anyway, it is quite nice and highly drinkable."
"This is a good drinking beer, too bad I cant get it in Virginia."
"Body is between light and medium with a slick, ""juicey"" mouthfeel. The carbonation is a little excessive, but it doesn't really detract from the integrity of the brew."
"Poured a slightly hazy copper color with massive tannish chunky head. LaLacing coated the sides of the glass as the head slowly fell to a thick coating. Very impressive head retention. Smell is very sweet and malty. Molasses-like notes present. Taste shows more of hoppiness with a nice balance from the caramel-tasting malt. Nice creamy mouthfeel with a moderately dry finish. Very easy to drink and very refreshing."
"Overall-a fine crafted IPA, lighter East Coaste version of the style, solidly made if unspectacular. Still this is a quite decent version from Flying Fish."
"This is a very drinkable beer and a solid example of an IPA."
"medium-high carbonation with a medium-light body. plenty of sweet malts with a slight bite of piney, grassy bitterness. an incredibly average ipa."
"This is a nice brew all around. It's fairly basic, but flavourful and very much in line with what you'd expect from an East Coast IPA."
"Not bad if you're looking for a fairly tame, easy drinking IPA. Certainly better than macro ""IPAs"" like Keith's, but not quite up to scratch with the competition."
"Poured a decent sized, dense, cream colored head that couldn't quite hold onto the glass. Transparent, radiant copper colored beer requires patience to reveal any sign of life. Faint aroma reveals a touch of crisp hops. Huge bicsuit malt flavor barely lets the hops breathe. Hops are funky, a bit of metallic and tea-like. This continues into the finish without a drop of bitterness Body is light, and the mouthfeel is just a touch froathy. For some reason this reminds me of the Otter Creek Copper Ale, but I definitely wouldn't guess IPA."
"On cask at the Grey Lodge in NE Philly. I had a sample of this after thinking it was the Puckerfish. I was disappointed to not be able to try the Puckerfish but the Hopfish is also a nice beer. The beer poured a nice golden / amber color with a slight head. The aroma is of strong hops with a bit of fruitness and malts. The taste is a bit of a hop bomb but it balanced out well with the sweetness of the malts. With a medium body, this beer is pretty drinkable from what I had sampled."
"Draft Pours a clear amber with a white head that produces good lacing and lasts well. Has a very hoppy aroma, of pine and citrus. Has light body with a good carbination. The flavor is nicely hoppy but not overbearing. Has a good mouthfeel. A nice duration with a good bitter finish. A very tasty IPA."
"not bad, not great. Simple enough and true to the style. My personal preference is a bit hoppier as this one leans more to the malt side. not bad and easy suds drinkin'"
"Medium bodied, with slightly more carbonation on the mouth than expected. I found it quite drinkable. From what I understand, this one will be available year round. It will make several trips out at the shore attempting to catch all Jersey's fish."
"It drinks pretty easy. I could have a lot of these. I'd say it'd be a good beer to get a case of for a barbeque or something, nothing too special."
"Picked a six pack of this up ""just because"" one day in need of a tasty session beer. This is a good one folks. Its clean, hoppy yet not overly so. It was floral will not alot of bitter hop smell. Poured almost amber into my glass with a decent head that stuck around for a while. The taste was of a normal ipa yet there seamed to be alittle more sweet malts that gave it some small fruit notes. Mouthfeel was smooth and satistfying and even refreshing alittle stickire of an ipa ive had. The aftertaste is not lingering at all though. I'd say this beer is definatley very drinkable and i can't wait to have this one in summer."
"Drinkability: average in my book, as this IPA doesn't excite me at all. Overall the flavor tones are mild and need to be kicked up a bit."
"There are many other IPAs much better. I wouldnt bother with this."
"BTW - The lacing just never gives up!"
"Got a quality pour with this brew. Big foamy head with lots of pretty and stringy lace. Nice amber color. Nose is hops with some prety nice hops wafting out. Flavor is a nice hop bomb, but not so much as to ruin other later tastings. Great floral flavors with some grapefruit and just hints of Christmas. Bits of caramel and some honey too. The hops left me smacking my lips. Nice heft on this beer with a very pleasant dry finish. Slightly oily though. Great carbonation, just enough to lighten this beer on the tongue and to keep the dry qualities from tiring out my tongue."
"I'll tell you, it certainly looks damned pretty, and while the smell and taste don't quite deliver what you hope for, it doesn't fall short by much. The ABV is manageable, and while the elements don't blend so much as trade places, at least they're there and identifiable. One of the better offerings I've sampled from Flying Fish, I'd have no issues with having this again when given the opportunity."
"I've never been overly impressed with Flying Fish and I hesitated to order this. Surprisingly though, it's a wonderful offering. Cloudy golden in color with a creamy white head that left solid lacing behind. Smelled fruity and malty with just enough floral hops. Taste was quite similar... juicy fruit flavors coupled with floral hops and a bittering that grows and grows and consumes the mouth requiring another juicy sip from its drinker. Mouth is full, smooth and creamy yet quite delicate. Really enjoyable stuff. I look forward to enjoying it again soon."
"Look for this beer on draft at bars around the Philly area and give it a shot if you see it. Flying Fish is waiting to see what the response is before they decide whether or not to bottle it."
"For the unfiltered: Unclear homemade iced tea towards amber, maybe more the color of a LongIsland iced tea. Cannot see my fingers on the other side of the glass. Just a bit of medium/large white bubbles at the edges of the glass and a light dusting. Semi soured scents (alliteration anyone?) Cant really feel the carbonation in this version, but yet it doesnt feel flat, more like I am drinking a cold cask-conditioned. I like low carbonation, so this is good. Very smooth and low to medium bodied. Nicely hoppy, grapefruit and biteyness, tastes of gin.bit of caramel sweetness, almost honey-like. Lots of flavor going on. Easy drinker."
"Smooth as silk. A very good session IPA."
