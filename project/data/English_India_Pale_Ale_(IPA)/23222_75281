Color is a cloudy amber brown. Aroma is hop, malt, caramel, toffee, woodsy. Flavor's much like nose, but with lots more going on - plenty of sweetness to stand up to the hop bitter, slight carbonic tang, biscuits, bread, yeast, crackers. Body is good but carbonation is kind of soft. Finish is like flavor, with bitters lasting a while and offset by the oak malt. Drinkable beer.","drpimento","Mar 12, 2012"

While wood is evident in the nose as well as on the palate, it is unclear how much it plays into the odd synergy of this beer. It drinks more like a stout plagued by acidity issues more than an actual IPA. The drinker may be given pause to reflect on most other wood-aged IPAs, which are obviously dry-hopped after aging--which does not seem to be the case for this beer.","beagle75","Dec 17, 2011"

4.5,13.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Notes: On-tap at Sanctuary. Oak aged IPA This is a very interesting beer with a very intriguing malt body for an IPA. It's not overly hoppy, but it is very complex and deep. Great showing of oak but also the malt and hops. It all just works together and combines into a tasty, interesting beer. Near perfect implementation of barrel flavors. The intention of this was to provide an experience of drinking an ocean bound IPA in oak barrels with a bit more of a malt backbone. I enjoyed this change of pace from a strong, hop forward IPA.","FreshHawk","0"
