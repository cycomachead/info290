"Serving type: bottle."

"As much as I do enjoy English IPA's, this wasn't for me. I found its hop character underwhelming and almost off putting. With the best before date April 16th, I don't think freshness is an issue. Perhaps I set the bar in my mind too high with the CAMRA award on the label. I wouldn't pick this up again but to each their own."

"While this may lay claim to original IPA sin, which very well could be true, it matters little, when so many others have passed them on by in the time since.  Yeah, the hoppiness here is more acrid and disjointed, instead of integrated and tantalizingly bitter, so I'm hardly emboldened to seek this out on cask, or any other format, really."

"Overall: Agressive, full-flavored English IPA. Rich and satisfying. It's just 5.6% abv but there's so much character here that it seems like it could be from a beer that's much stronger. Impressive. For fans of English ales this one has to be in the top ten or so to try."

" The taste is very fruity with spicy and almost cinnamon-like taste like mulled cider with woody and fruity flavor in the hops with mild toasted grain and light caramel tinge from the malt with yeast providing a deep stone fruit essence and almost black cherry taste. All the ingredients are cohesive as a unit with deep complexity into a warming and mostly dry spicy finish. Ovearall this is one of the best English IPA's I have tasted -it has an authentic English yeast taste with great complexity and very drinkable strength-wise with 5.6%. There is not a ton of hop flavor yet it is still flavorful iwth balance of bitterness and malt iwth nice fruitiness from the yeast."
"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of dry English style hops is dominant with some dry caramel malt notes also perceptible. Taste is also dominated by some dry English style hops with light floral undertones some white pepper notes and some dry caramel malt. Body is about average with good carbonation. Quite enjoyable and nice to enjoy a non-American style IPA once in a while."

"Overall: definitely needs to be served at a less cool temperature to have a chance, but it's really not that interesting - not bad, and better than your mass produced beers"

"Overall - Didn't taste as good as I thought it would based on the high review score. It's an okay beer, but with fuller's products on the shelf close by, no reason to get this one again. It's very drinkable but unremarkable."
""
""
""
"This is an excellent English IPA. Very restrained by American (or modern English) standards, but an extremely quaffable benchmark and classic of the style. Must try in my books."
""
""
"Final Grade: 3.62, a B. I don't think I'd count Worthington's White Shield amongst my favourite English IPAs, but it's still a respectable, traditional example of the style that I can easily enjoy for what it is. The price and overall ho-hummed-ness of this prevents it from being something that would enter my UK ale rotation, but it's not every day a new CAMRA-approved ale gets imported by our benevolent government liquor monolith, so I appreciate the option anyway."
"Overall - Very fine and well executed EIPA, with good hops and malts balance and clean finish. If the price was a bit better, a definite repeat purchase."
""
""
"Worthington's White Shield is indeed, as it's advertised, ""for true IPA connoisseurs"" - aside from its history, there's very little about it that stands out and no other reason to seek it out. This may be the ""longest surviving India Pale Ale"" but it's nowhere near the best, or even very good. *This* is one of the UK's most heavily decorated ales? I guess you have to be there to get it."
""
""
""
"Not bad, but not something I would revisit. If I am looking for an English session ale, I think there are better choices."
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, itâ€™s a decent beer but there are better choices in the style."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is light and lively but slightly oily feel, strong hop character - woody (cedar, eucalyptus), herbal, mightly medicinal and almost minty, all with gently dominant and engaging zesty bitterness balanced with light sweetness of caremlised bread crust underneath, light mineral and sulphur. The character and feel are complex, engaging, bright."
""
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is okay. Deep hue, giant head, persistent lacing. Nose is hops and lemon citrus. Hoppy and soapy, not much else. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
"Different. But the floral grows on the nose as it warms."
"Overall - interesting brew. Nothing wild or crazy about it, but still a good beer and good representation of a style."
""
"Poured from 500 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Purchased locally in Austin, Texas."
"Overall: a very drinkable English IPA. Mostly dominated by caramel with some floral hops. The only problem with this being so easy to put down is that one 500mL bottle is AU$9 (2014). Ouch."
""
"O: love it. i'm partial to the English style, and this is possibly the best English IPA I've run into so far, namely because it isn't watered down -- often a hallmark of the imported English pale ale family. it stands up to any of my English ale favorites with enough body and taste to please any beer drinker."
""
"500 ml bottle. Pours orange with huge, long lasting white head, nice lacing and lively carbonation. Aroma is of funky yeast, piney hops and ripe fruit. Earthy hops dominate the palate while caramel, bready malt and ripe fruit provide some balance. Finish is long and earthy. Very nice brew."
"Overall thoughts - very interesting, rich, new to the UK style IPA I will definitely have to give it another try(next time prepared with a glass). This beer gave a good first impression making me want to try other creations by Worthingtons. I recommend giving it a try to anyone."

"The mouthfeel is outstanding here and just adds to the complexity. Such and easy sipper here but you could throw back pint after pint of this."

"Nice true ipa.  What you woul expect.  But too much carbonation"
""
""
""
"564ml bottle (1 imperial pint) I think. ap: rapidly subsiding head, light amber/deep gold, clear. Little smell. Taste: some crystal malt, medium bitterness and sweetness. mo: medium body, oily. Overall: There are many more flavoursome IPA's than this."
"500ml bottle. Pours a nice copper amber hue with a nice long lasting off white fluffy head..Good head retention and lacing. Aroma of citrus, grass, some biscuit malt, sweet fruity, notes, grains and some yeast. Taste is sweet biscuit malt, grass and grains with some citrus flavor and mild bitterness. Palate is a medium body, smooth, mild carbonation with sweet mild bitterness. Finishes with sweet biscuit malt, grass and grains, citrus fruity notes, yeast with a mild bitter ending for balance. Has a nice full flavor for an EIPA. Overall makes a good session brew, good balance and flavor."
"the pungent briskness fades in favor of a mild, fruitier taste."
""
""
"Overall Impression: Definitely the ale to drink in Burton. A nice depth of malt flavor that tiptoes between bready and biscuity with firm hop bitterness that lasts into the finish. A fine ale to enjoy on a sunny afternoon or a rainy, cold night."
"Overall a very good representation of the class British IPA with an insanely high level of drinkability. These are on sale for $1.99 / 500ml bottle and i think i might pick up an entire case. I prefer the american style, but this is one is quite good."
""
"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours deep, hazy copper with a thick, creamy off-white head that retreats very slowly and retains well throughout consumption. There are lots of visible tiny bubbles rising in this beer. Some lacing is left behind on the glass during consumption. There are aromas of brown bread and toffee. I also detect some floral and citrus notes along with the English yeast. The first sip brings that brown bread and toffee, but the toffee notes aren't too sweet. I get the citrus and some nice back end hop bitterness that isn't too bitter and the English yeast comes through pretty well. It has that unmistakable Burton ale flavor with a good mineral quality. The long lasting head actually adds a bit of creaminess that I'm just not used to when I take a sip of this beer. The flavors are wonderfully well-balanced. The mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry and smooth. This is a highly drinkable beer. This is an excellent beer that I would recommend."

"no wonder the french killed the order... this beer is OK, nothing special, nothing bad, I wouldn't turn it down on tap but I certainly will not be launching 3 journeys into enemy lands for it..."
"M: well-balanced and refreshing"

"To taste: 88/100"
""

"Apart from that, solid."
"Appearance has a mid orange amber color supporting a nice lasting head leaving small lace. Smell is clean with light cereal notes and english hops. Taste of the cereal grain, english yeast with fruit notes and a balance of hops throughout. Mouthfeel is medium with a higher carbonation associated with this English style."
""
""
"What a pleasant beer to drink, this must be the reason to be almost 300 years old in business. Glad to see that still to be now owned by a global major company they are truly faithful to the style, actually it is claimed to be the oldest surviving IPA. Very hoppy for English beers, but not overwhelming as some American IPAs can be (ps. anyway not to a hop head like this one)."
"Pours a rich amber-copper color. Some haze. Big white head that expands quickly with a hard pour. Solid chunks of lace sticking to the walls of the glass. Very pretty beer. Lots of English hops in the aroma; I'm not good at this, but my guess would be Goldings. It has a sweet citrus aroma shot through with a peppery spice. I'm not enjoying the malt contribution as much. The caramel sweetness is a bit limp and doesn't quite have that luxurious quality of that I love in other English beers. Perhaps, a touch of diacetyl, not that it's a problem, just a little English twist. The taste adds an interesting mineral note but loses some hop brightness. The malt is still a bit underwhelming. The bitterness seems to have that lasting dry flavor that I think of coming from Burton's hard water. Still, the beer either needs a richer malt sweetness or a drier profile. The malt bill kinda plays the middle and doesn't do a great job of it. Good yeasty, mildly bitter finish, though. It's an easy drinking beer. Mouthfeel is relatively gentle. The attempt to mimic cask ale doesn't work all that well, but it's a good thought - I recommend a relatively hard pour and patience. The drying finish helps a lot. Drinks easily. It's always fun to try a good English beer. Too few make it across the Atlantic."
""
"O - A good IPA, nice flavor profile, just the right ratio of malt to hops. Could use a little more depth in the aroma. Would definitely have again."
""
"Poured into a Samuel Smith imperial pint glass. Pours a medium orange amber with a healthy three finger very light tan head and pillowy lacing. Light aroma of biscuit malt and grassy, spicy hops. Flavor of biscuit and bready malt with light earthy and grassy hops. Nicely balanced and a great combination of malt and light hops. Finishes with very faint hops and malt. Medium bodied. A quite pleasant English style IPA. I suspect the long shipping time has muted the hops somewhat, and this is nice enough that I hope I can drink a fresh version some day with a bit more hops."
""
""
"O: by the last few sips, I was convinced that this is easily the best English IPA (from the home country) that I've tried - quite possibly the most hop-bitter British ale I've had (and I hesitate saying that with Old Engine Oil coming to mind...) - it could use a little more malt (grain) biscuit/sweetness, or less hops (dare I say!) - but this was a fantastic experience - can't wait to revisit this one!"
"A fantastic representation of the style! Perfectly balanced - if you've been drinking west coast IPA's for a while, try this out for a nice change of pace to find out just how versatile the style truly is."
"500 ml bottle, label says best before end 07 MAR 14. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a hazy orange color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is nice but light, it smells like toasted malt, fruit, spicy hops and some bready malt/grain. It tastes like earthy hops, fruit, toffee, tea, toasted and bready malt, and a bit of peppery spice. There's a nice bitter finish, too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth and has nice, soft carbonation. I think this is a good English IPA. At $3.99 a bottle, it's worth trying."
"Good beer. Nice change from the in-your-face American IPAs. Malt is as important as the bitterness, and it works."
""
"I loved this beer. If I were a civil servant in Calcutta in 1799 and had this delivered on the last boat from Burton-Upon-Trent, I'd be overjoyed."
"Very clean thin, almost watery on the finish. Sweet malts, some fig jam on toast like flavors rolls into a faint butteryness. Finishes dry with a leafy hop character. Flavors are subdued and the body, while being a little thin, is almost too big to allow these soft flavors show. It does a good job of having that cask ale mouthfeel out of a bottle but its just a little dull. Bitterness is nice though. Could be my new world palate trying to review a true old world style. Not my cup of tea though."
"D- hoopier than other English IPAs I've had and drier to boot. Not terribly complex but flavorful and tasty enough to win me over. I could session the hell out of this one."
""
""
"Overall... holy hell, this is a wonderful beer. Keep in mind I have an extreme Anglo bias, but nonetheless this is probably the best bottled English beer I've tried. This is exactly what it's style should be and immensely drinkable. Is it big and bold like most of the higher-ranking beers on this site? No, but it is just as, if not more complex and arguably tastes even better. I'll be buying more of these without hesitation. The only downsides are its fairly limited availability and that it's a little high in ABV to be considered a session ale. But it's still an amazing beer."
""
""
"One of the darker IPA's out there with straying too far from the norm. It was pretty ordinary although not boring throughout and had just about enough to keep me interested without warranting a second tasting."
""
""
"The mouthfeel reminds me of cask experiences. Very lightly carbonated, making the beer a little less prickly, and a little less filling. The finish is dry, which, when coupled with the lightly sweet opening, makes this an easier beer to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is fruity and malty with a mild floral hop bitterness on the finish. The flavors overall are quite light and gives the beer a muted flavor, even at 50 degrees or so. The taste of carbonation and alcohol seem to be the biggest players here. This surprises me as the label claims ""Closer to Cask for a fuller flavor""...I expected something low on carbonation and richly malted. It also boasts ""Our finest IPA for true IPA connoisseurs"" and I surely didnâ€™t find that to be the case. Upon even further inspection, this particular bottle was brewed by Tenth and Blake Beer Co. (Molson-Coors), so I guess I am not too surprised by this lackluster offering. Perhaps the original English Ale (if there ever was one) is a better brew than this."
"O: A classic English IPA. If you're a fan of the style, there's a lot to love here. The cask-like mouthfeel in particular is quite nice."
"Food match: This is one ale that would suit a decent Thai curry, like a Massaman or Penang curry with the obligatory side of coconut rice."
"Their description says they are using the same recipe since 1830 when IPA's were transported to the Far East. To me, this is the way a British IPA should be. The hops do not cause me to pucker up but they keep the overall sweet malty flavor alive. I bet the British Colonies in Burma loved this one."

"Pours a deep clear golden color with a huge bubbly white head that persists forever. The aroma is quite fruity with a touch of caramel malt backbone. Fruity yeast esters with a hint of sulfur and a touch of toffee round out the nose. Mild sulfur mineral water flavor with a solid shot of hop bitterness. Sweet juicy fruits mixed with toffee, caramel, brown sugar and a hint of butterscotch. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet mineral mouthfeel. Nice beer, but its a bit of a stretch to call it an IPA, or maybe its just my American hop fried palette."
""

"500 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 3/7/2014. Pours lightly hazy golden orange color with a nice 2-3 finger foamy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. A fair amount of foamy lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, biscuit, pine, citrus peel, herbal, floral, grass, nuttiness, pepper, and earth. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and decent strength. Taste of caramel, grapefruit, herbal, pine, floral, grass, bread, pepper, orange, and earth. Fair amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, citrus, pine, herbal, grass, pepper, bread, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; minimal cloying flavors on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a lightly creamy and very crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming present on the finish. Overall this is a very good English IPA! Nice balance and flavor complexity; very smooth to drink. Very enjoyable."
"Overall: drinkable and tasty. It took a few sips, but this beer has grown on me. I would have this again."
""
"Classic English IPA flavors--lots of caramel from an ample helping of crystal malt. The hop presence is muted. The body is very good: full with decent carbonation. The aftertaste has a bit of hop bite, like a small dose of white pepper."
"Poured a massive all head with good lifespan. The body is a pretty bright clear golden yellow. It smells like a nice IPA with piney and citrusy hops. The taste although good and reflective of the smell is far milder than I expected and in fact were it not labelled an IPA I'd have guessed it wasn't and was just a pale ale. It has a medium long finish and was a little soapy in the aftertaste."
""
"So rare to see a true English IPA available. This one is pretty good. And I'm sure it would be nice on cask."
"O: A fine English IPA, and one of the more authentic examples of the style on the market."
""
""
""
"Maybe I am an ignorant American, or maybe the Molson Coors Brewing Company ruined this beer but when I drink an IPA I want it to take and smell like hops and malt. This doesn't."
"White Shield after sampling Red Shield last night. This English IPA pours a very, very light bodied polished bronze in color with a two finger off white head and loads of carbonation. The nose is decently balanced. There are English hops with slight caramel malt character and a defined, somewhat different bitterness. The flavors present what the nose initially offered. It features light English hops and a good amount of caramel malt with slight minerality. It's ok. This beer won't wow you by any means but it is true to the style and well made for what it is."
"What can you say about the original IPA. This is what all brewers should be striving for...a hop bomb can be fun for a minute but over time, balance will take the day! Thank goodness this classic beer has survived. So great to see it over here in the States!"
""
"Easy drinking pale ale with nice flowing mouthfeel ever so slightly over carbonated and still a good port in a storm and benchmark beer."
"O - This beer transports me to England; sitting in a pub drinking pint after pint of this well-balanced IPA and chatting it up. A perfect session IPA if ever there was one, the moderate hops carefully balance the malt side for a beer that's one hell of an easy drinker."
""
""
"I wonder if this has suffered at the hands of Molson Coors."
""
"O/D - What a shame. This should be much fresher to be good. It's just malt really. There is barely any English hop profile to speak of, and what's there is too light and not assertive or balanced. Too bad."
"The smell is rather neutral, nothing really to smell. The taste has some bitterness in it in the aftertaste. Not bad!"
"A decent brew, but no champion in my books. It looks great and has a good body, but the aroma is lack-lustre and the flavour just isn't as hoppy or aromatic as I expected. This IPA's reputation preceeds it, and I was hoping for more. Oh well. Worth sampling, but not world-class."
"O: Gotta admit, not a big fan of this one as it really disappointed me with the IPA moniker (even though it is English). I just didn't like the dominant malt profile (or that funky malt smell in the nose). Apart from that, it's a decent beer (objectively speaking) but not one I'd probably ever buy again. I will say I prefer it to something like Coopers Vintage, which for me it tastes similar to. 2.5"
"Mouth feel was just fine and drinkability was amazing, considering. A worthy experiment in its own right so I have no regrets."
"D- Very nice, one of my favorites from a bottle."
"Could have 2. Not 3."
"I've always liked this beer but that's as far as it goes. Sure, I've always appreciated it, it comes from an incredible pedigree and it is iconic for what it represents (ie as one of the very last sole surviving bottle conditioned British beers before CAMRA took off) but in the end it is as exciting as Paul McCartney and Wings."
"Carbonation is too high, a distraction from the malt."
"A very good English IPA that has fallen somewhat short of my high expectations. It seems bigger and more alcoholic than the 5.6% suggests."
"D - good - enjoyable tastes and easy to drink, will definately drink again"
"There's something refined about a real EIPA compared to some of the in your face AIPA's that are turning up lately. This is a great example of the style, obviously not as hop dominant as an AIPA but that's the point some seem to miss. The balance is excellent, soft piney hop notes are in line with the solid caramel malt hints. Alcohol is not particularly evident, carbonation is spot on. Grippy bitterness finishes it off brilliantly. This is how it's done."
"D - A good example of an English IPA. Very hoppy in the taste but not overpowering, which is common in IPA. Probably the best beer in the Worthington range."
"Overall - A great example of a very enjoyable beer style."
"Warming on the palate. The alcohol does seem to shine through despite it being under 6%."
"4.5 M&4 D: overall, very rounded and smooth, and the body is well-balanced but thick enough on texture to buttress the med.-full flavour. A moderate IPA it is, but a rich one by English standards. Very enjoyable beer worth seeking out."
"It is well carbonated, and not too heavy. I could drink this all night with ease, with a beautiful balance of hop and malt."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style India Pale Ale"
"I really enjoyed this, one of the better English bottled beers I've had. White Shield has been an English institution well before Coors took over its care, I am pleased to report it is still as good as I remember it being back in the 70's and 80's which is when I last had any."
"A very pleasant example of the English IPA style."
" A rare example of an original IPA and well worth drinking, even if it was from a bottle and only 500ml instead of a pint!"
"Mouthfeel was thin to medium in body. Medium to light carbonation."
"d: nice packaging, but carbonation overpowers whatever else is going on in this beer & i won't be looking for this one again"
"A tasty english ipa, well worth the try"
"Other comments: Finally trying the legendary White Shield. It's a nice, hearty, bitter, crisp IPA. Definitely would like to try maturing one for ""up to 3 years"" as the label suggests."
"D - Very drinkable. Strong in every area, with the mouthfeel being particularly enjoyable. Highly recommend."
"All in all, try a bottle!"
"Despite tasting like it's a little old it's holding up very well. Definitely worth a sample depending on the bottle you get."
"man, you could do worse than have this as a standard everyday beer. high enough on taste, but easy on abv. though at $9 each, the bank account would take a beating."
"Mostly clear dark orange colour with a large dense whipped cream white head. Looks impressive in the glass, the head rises well above the rim and holds its form remarkably well. Large clumps of foam adorn the glass. Aroma is a little fruity (peach, orange?) with hints of honey and pine. But I also get some vanilla and icecream aromas. Flavour doesn't seem to be quite as strong as the aroma, but is fairly bitter, hoppy and tastes of vanilla and cream. The head is creamy over the lips but the mouthfeel is fairly light."
"500 ml bottle, bought at SelfridgeÂ’s, London. This bottle conditioned ""original"" IPA has a slightly hazy deep golden colour and a fluffy head. The hops are what itÂ’s all about in the aroma and flavour - lovely citrussy aroma with hints of oak and leather, flavour has a distinct resin-like bitterness with notes of grapefruit on a subdued background of dusty malty sweetness. Interesting beer."
"This beer was such a damn tease!"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: A very drinkable beer. Nice carbonation."
"Pours a cloudy copper with a huge pillowy white head that takes quite some time to settle. It leaves behind some nice lace on the glass, but I became impatient waiting for the head to dissipate. Aroma is a mixture of bread and caramel with some nice spicey hops. Begins sweet, with caramel and malt flavors dominating, then becomes bitter with herbal and spicey hops. The sweet/bitter balance is quite good. Has a medium body with low to medium carbonation. Very quaffable. Quite a nice brew."
