"3.26/5: Nothing particularly special, though fans of English-style IPAs will get a kick out of it"

"Lemon and grass in the aroma and right up front ends with a nice light bitter finish.  Good refreshing beer."

"Don't waste your time or money. Look right past this one. Sorry excuse for an ipa."

"Bottle: Poured a light amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of citrus hops notes with some bitter notes easily noticeable. Taste is also dominated by some citrus hops notes with quite bit of bitterness with a non-descript malt backbone. Body is light with good carbonation. Standard IPA which lacks some floral hoppy aromas."

"Overall I'm quite impressed. Today's beer drinker (in general) seeks gusto, but I seek refinement. The depth of character found here; and the freshness that it displays are impeccable. The roundness of it running across wide swaths of malt, various hops, and a solid yeast character are rarely found anymore; and in combination with it's spot-on balance of sweet malt and raspy hop flavor and bitterness, it's an exceptionally drinkable English+American hybrid IPA. Brilliant!"

"There's an apricot like element to the flavor. The hop is like black pepper on the tongue and is strongest in the swallow. Good body with an elevated carbonation. For the style, short aftertaste."

"Thick beige cap, really sticky and thick with great head retention. The beer was mostly clear, orange in colour. Aromas of oranges and grapefruits, mild malt and sweetness, a bit of sharp citrus rind. Hoppy backbone with mild malt sweetness, solid bitterness, citrus (grapefruit and orange again). Grassy/spicy character with lingering bitterness. Medium to light bodied with moderate carbonation, faint warmth, drying on the palate. A straight ahead and nicely balanced IPA."

"A decent if unexceptional beer. Mildly flavoured and relatively unexciting."

"O - Good English IPA, leads a little more American, but very drinkable. It was best when it was right out of the fridge."
"Overall: Good IPA, I would definitely have this one again."
""
""
"an interesting brew but the Long Trail unfiltered is superior... if you like some hop (bitterness) burn in the back but more mild semi-funky malt flavor this may be for you... worth checking out just for diversity but not worth giving up your left nut for."

"To be fair, it wasn't weak and there was enough alcohol in here to be felt well before I finished this off. A slight mint aftertaste kept things clean and neat but this needed to be a bit more edgy and groundbreaking to stand out. What resulted was an IPA that was easily drinkable and easily forgotten, which is not how I remember my beers from the Green Mountain State, Magic Hat notwithstanding. Only worth a go if you're a hophead that needs a fix and wants a relatively light take on this style."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid EIPA to drink for a while."
"O: Overall an slightly above average experience, the hop level is moderate, though the complexity lacks a bit. I did find this an bit uneventful upfront but warmed up to it by finish with some increased hop awareness coming through."

"first brew from shed, a decent American English hybrid, with some of the best features of both. the nose is heavy citrus hops, but its balanced well by a sturdy dose of sweeter caramel colored English malt that's a bit sweet. the beer drinks on the heavy side, which is unfortunate this summer season. the malt just gives a lot of body, while the hops don't get to be fully bitter as a result. this is a heartier ipa, a mans beer in some sense. I do get some bitter in the finish, centennial or cascade style, with that oil component. Vermont makes some of the best india pale ales on the planet, but this isn't one of them, it is suited better for fall though, like most English styles I think, but maybe that's just me. I am still looking forward to trying the mountain ale, as the craftsmanship of this beer is solid, and perhaps another beer might be a better platform for it to work. a good widely available and affordable sixer though, and im sure ill be drinking this again while I am back east."

"Overall though for an IPA this one is a good one to know about."
""
""
""
"O: Easy to drink if you like English IPAs, with the well hidden alcohol, subdued hops, and slightly maltier flavors."
""

"This is a solid, but not particularly remarkable IPA. I'm not convinced it's an English IPA. I didn't check BA while reviewing and I assumed it was an American IPA. I'm not sure how this biases my score. Regardless, more than anything else, I'm amused at how proud this beer is to be brewed in Vermont. It's like Vermont is becoming a brand. I guess that's kind of cool."

"The label also read ""Unfiltered"" so I went with a medium-handed pour, not aggro but not gentle, either. This resulted in at least two fingers of dense, tawny head with great retention. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was redolent with grapefruit-citrus hops and my mouth was watering as a result. Mouthfeel was very soft, allowing the citrus hops to really shine. Finish was definitely dry, but not so dry as to leave me gasping for air. I did an agitation for my second pour and released the lees as a result. I guess that it depends on what you like. Personally, I do not mind the lees and like them as a separate/final pour. No problem there. One final thought - I am unsure that this is an EIPA. It tastes more like and AIPA."
"Pours a very dark garnet-y color, kind of a burnt-amber. Head was fine. Smell is of malt. Taste is of malt, with just a touch of hops. Mouthfeel was fine. I can't quite understand how this can be called an ipa. It's a dark-colored malty ale, with very little hop character. It's not ""bad"" per se, it's just not what you're looking for if you ask for an ipa."
"This is a decent average ipa with noticable citrus tones with a hint of earthiness and almost a soil kind of thing. It's smooth on the feel. Pretty easy to drink, but more of a mass appeal ipa instead of something bringing some punch. I can dig it though."
""
"OVERALL: Tasty beer, suffered a bit from caked yeast in the bottle. Would love to try it on tap sometime, as this has some potential."

"O/D-Not a terrible IPA. Doesn't 'wow' you at all. Tasty enough."
""
"A solid IPA. I could never see myself seeking it out but wouldn't kick it out of my cooler either."
""
"No this thing needs some help."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy orange/brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, a touch of citrus. Taste is well balanced hops and malts, a mild bitterness, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall I enjoyed this beer, but if you are looking for a hop bomb, this ain't it."
"I've had this beer many times before, so I'm trying to take into account those times as well as this weird floaty experience. I think its a good all-around IPA, I would definitely recommend it. If anyone knows why I would get the floaties, please message me, I'd like to know why..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Well, if it weren't for the floaties and the mild aroma, this beer would certainly have scored higher since I liked the flavor. I'm going to try look for another bottle to try; hoping the particles and light aroma were the exception rather than the rule."

"O: Meh. A real typical, traditional IPA. The killer is the quick dissipating smell that was already weak to begin with. It almost felt like an overly bitter pale ale. I won't be going back for any more of these."
""
""
"Unfiltered caramel color which looks great for an IPA. Floral and citrus aroma. The aroma continues into the taste. The floral and citrus notes from the aroma really shine with a more bitter hop centered taste. The classic IPA bitterness coupled with the grapefruit citrus sweetness makes for a really refreshing beer for the summer. Finishes on the bitter side."

"The taste has a quick burst of pale malts but then the floral hoppy character takes command and leaves a moderate bitterness on the tail end. People who love their hops will find this to be a delight."
""
""
""
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a medium burnt orange color with numerous slow small streams of bubbles rising from the bottom. Nice full thick head that clung extremely well, but thinned out fairly fast. Aroma was a floral slightly sweet hoppy smell. Nothing over bearing or unpleasant. Flavor was a bit thin and watery. A piney hoppy finish, with a bit of kick, but not much. Felt good in the mouth, coated ok with a a tad of carbonation. Overall a solid IPA, but nothing spectacular."
""
""
"O - A decent IPA that sits on the lower end of middle in the IPA pack. Pro's: personally enjoy the thicker texture and is generously hopped for an English Style IPA making it more American than English, no complaints here. Cons: grainy and low alcohol coming through. The aftertaste is what I would consider the most enjoyable part of this beer because the malts kill the hops during the experience but afterwards when the malt is gone, the hop residue gets to shine through a little more."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a bright, slightly hazed, goldenrod coloring with little to no head. Aromas of grapefruit, light toffee, and floral hops. Very smooth and well balanced nose. Flavors of roast toffee initially, immediately followed up by floral and bitter hops that completely take over the palate. Cedar, cut grass, and sap all blend to represent the hopping in this brew, and the citrus tones shine through at the end of the palate to add some tartness to the bitter aftertaste. The malt profile literally disappears by the aftertaste. Light, crisp mouthfeel, with a bitter, slightly drying finish. Solid brew, with flavors stronger than the looks and ABV would lead you to believe."
"Overall a tasty and well balanced ale with a fresh hop bite."
"More yeast and malt influence than a lot of IPAs today, which is maybe why it is considered an English take on IPA."
"Pours a slightly hazy medium golden color with a decent sized white head that quickly drops to a cap. Smells of citrus and earthy hops with some bread and caramel maltiness to provide balance. A hint of mineral water and a touch of orange and lemon round out the nose nicely. The flavor is a bit more focused on the malt than the aroma lead me to believe. Sweet bread, cracker, and caramel malts countered with earthy and citrus hops. Long lingering hop bite at the end of every sip. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a bitter slick mouthfeel. I'm pretty impressed with this bottled version, its been years since I enjoyed any of the beer I've had at the brewpub. This is actually a pretty good gateway IPA."
"Overall pretty good. Nothing crazy, and more of a pale ale than IPA, but decent profile. Decent malt base that balances but stays out of the way of the hops. The bottle conditioning seems to have taken off and added it's own mild profile, but gives the beer a nice robustness. Drinkable and doesn't offend on any account."
""
""
"O: This beer definitely tastes like an English IPA and has subdued flavors of hops and is a little maltier compared to American IPAs. Any traces of alcohol are well hidden from the taste."
""
""
"Very clean and crisp english style IPA. Good bitterness but not overwhelming. Dry biscuit malt with a touch of caramel and butter on the mid-palate. Piney and floral bitterness on the back end kicks the brew up a little bit. A very bold but drinkable English IPA with decent balance, pretty good."
""
""
"MILDLY AMUSING, NOT MUST TRY!"
""
"The beer pours a golden amber. Very cloudy. The smell of hops is less than anticipated. The taske is hoppy with a underwhelming finish. There is something missing from making this beer decent. Was hoping for a stronger hoppy hit but it hits you and quickly goes with a sharp after taste."
""
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. Pours a dull, tangerine hue with a slightly hazy clarity and a dense, creamy, three inch, cream-colored head - this beer looks great in the glass. Nose expresses citrus rind and an earthy character. Taste follows nose; however, there is a pleasant, toasted malt character. Citric acid is interspersed throughout the flavor profile and finishes with a slightly earthy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body (but closer to light) with a lively, almost prickly carbonation. Acidity lightly stimulates the palate and sides of the cheeks. Overall, a pretty drinkable English IPA. Looking forward to trying more offerings from these guys. I'd love to see this on-cask."
"O: Not a bad American IPA and a nice little boost there at 6% ABV which goes relatively undetected. It was good for a couple, but the palate could get burned out on its mediocrity or yeasty, oxidized off-flavors before too long. I'd get again, but would eagerly accept a more intriguing tap offering."

"Very smooth and full mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Pleasant, but a little less crisp than I might have liked for the style. Not bad, not at all exceptional, felt more like an English IPA than an American one."
