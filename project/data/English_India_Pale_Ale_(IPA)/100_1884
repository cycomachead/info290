They are not afraid to give high marks to stuff that is (in my experience) just plain good, without the hype. I'm in no way saying that all of BA is a bunch of hype helpers, but this is one case where it's like, wow, this is a really unique beer for many reasons and the Bros score is right in line with mine. Though, mine of course, is just an opinion and I will say that there are many , man, many more qualified raters than I. However, it's really all opinion in a sense. Blathering, but just loved this and like a very adept review  that is below mine, was blown away by the beer after I had seen such mediocre ratings. Sometimes you wonder how much thought is being out into the ratings. It's always like there is this regression to the mediocre mean...how many beers rank from 81-86...a huge majority I would believe. And many of us call this mediocre...well in this case you're missing out if you don't try it. Besides, it's got a dead horse on the bottle...what better to do than beat it, which is what I seem to be doing.","31Sam13","Feb 28, 2015"

4.03,10.1,,,,,,"O: Why is it called 'Dead Horse IPA'? Because you can't beat a dead horse, rimshot. This is a brand that those who were around in the early days of craft beer will remember fondly. After a long hiatus the brand is looking to make a comeback, brewing and canning out of Wachusett. The liquid itself is tasting quite good. However, I worry about its potential to make an impact in the market again. The beer landscape has changed a lot, and it's so much more competitive now. McNeill's can't just rely on their old customer base to get by; they need to actively solicit new drinkers in a completely different and much younger demographic. Their name means nothing to these people, and without an active sales force and more aggressive marketing they will probably just end up as another hokey-looking can on the shelf collecting dust. It doesn't help that the market is preferring the more aggressive west coast style IPAs to the more English versions of the style these days. I really wonder what McNeills' current ambitions are.","ryan1788a5","Aug 29, 2014"

It has a dry, bitter flavor that melds with a traditional pale and crystal malt character. It's not overly bitter and it finishes a tad thin. The mouthfeel is decent as well.

2.94,-19.7,2,3,3,3,3,"Hi folks, in NH for work and scored a bottle of Dead Horse Ale at a gas station quickie mart. My First review. I'm not impressed by cloudiness in an IPA. The bottle is marked best before last day of Feb, no year. It's June 2010. My take on this beer is very similar to the rest of the reviews. No excessive head, pours just fine. The aroma is a bit dusty to me and the flavor is dominated by a citrusy/belgian/spicy flavor that imo is not hops and detracts from the what I expect from an IPA. I can't (I don't think) taste cloudiness, but it looks nice and orange with a bit of lacing around the glass and the cloudiness is not right (IMO). If I was sitting in a pub in England and drinking this from a cask, maybe I'd think it was like an old time Ale, but it's way different from IPAs and bitters and best bitters and cask ales I've had in England. So, I'll drink it, but won't buy another and won't be requesting it in trade.","jfh","Jun 21, 2010"

Poured a hazy burnt orange with a rocky, three inch, off-white head - layers of bubbles formed the base while pock marks formed the cap. Head eventually settles into a solid quarter inch layer. Thick, textured clumps of lacing were revealed as the brew was consumed. Nose is a little earthy & musty with a hint of spice. Taste consistent with nose - earthy and spicy with a peppery quality at the back; some floral hops character is detectable in the mix. Mouthfeel is light/medium, a little oily, with a carbonation level that approaches prickly.

The aroma is more like yeast, spices, and malts and the hops seem almost secondary, espcially as I am sampling an IPA. But the flavor tells a different story.

In a pint glass this beer was a hazy amber color with a medium off-white head. It had a pronounced malt aroma and was also somewhat floral. Citrus, pine, and malt were all present in the taste.

3.5,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is clearly an English style IPA, from a very traditional interpretation of the style. If you are looking for a wildly hopped up american IPA or a nouvelle IPA with gobs of orange burst and blossom, than there will be some definite readjustment necessary. The beer is a lot more caramelly than one would expect. There is a wooden cask type residue underneath, with lots of phenols, bready citrus, a touch of orange rind, some earthy and grassy notes to this beer. My only real criticism is that the beer is way too watery for its own good. This beer needs some thickening up in the worst way. There is a cloying, almost syrupy sweetness to the beer, there are sweet malts running all over the place as well. It just needs a firmer body, maybe a touch more hop bite to balance out the sweet, almost bubblegum sugariness. The beer is cloudy, dirty water amber, with not much head retention and no lacing. The beer is definitely carbonated, easy to drink. If this had a higher ABV, it would have some brandy like qualities to it. There is also a bit of carboard mustiness in the nose.","albern","May 09, 2009"

I had to call my wife over to verify that I wasn't nuts, but there is very little hops to be found. Medium body and carbonation, sticky mouthfeel. If they had called this a bitter I would have scored it much higher. An IPA this is not. Maybe there was some mix up at bottling time, but I have to assume that this is supposed to be an IPA.

The flavors were quite hoppy at first with solid citrus definition before it went into pale malt, vanilla and wood. The finish was very 'green' with a lot of herbal (full leaf?) hops.

4.05,10.7,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Originally reviewed on July 22, 2006. 22 Oz Bottle. Aroma is a light misty dry hop, as of a barleywine profile. Profusive tanned fruits. Delicate. Pour of heavily clouded rich amber sienna, fogged with orange bursts of yeasts and hints of caramel. Bold tawny bowling over foamy head. Flavor is a magnificient run of malts and gentle fruit hops. Its like a wateredown barleywine, but not in a bad way. Flavor is an amalgamation of rich spice fruit, some bold yeast character and an astringent east meets west battle of the hops. Delectable and soothing. Some very light distant aged qualites, dancing with sherried persimmon and oxidized grain. This lends maturity and sophisitication. The malt is excellently constructed in this beer and thats what really shines. It also beams of balance, which I heavily appreciate. Smack is heavy of hearty hops resins and fleeting pipe tobacco. I can see why traditional american IPA lovers wouldnt like. Its not the typical clean, sweet west coast hop heavy animal that so many are. But, this is different. Better and far above, with more character than any other IPA can usually muster.","CharlesDarwin","Dec 11, 2006"
3.03,-17.2,3.5,3,3,2,3.5,"Pours a cloudy orange/amber color with a small off-white head that fades away quickly. Smells mainly of citrus and grapefruit aromas and a stiff maltiness in there as well. Taste is of aspirin-like astringent hops, and some sweet malts, kind of weak though. I'm guessing this beer is kind of old as well. It seems almost flat...very little carbonation and pretty thick mouthfeel. The flavor ends very sharp with bitterness but doesnt stick around for too long. Alcohol is fairly detectable as well in the taste. Very balanced anyways. Not bad, not great either. But like I said, this beer is definitely old.","Doomcifer","Oct 25, 2006"

Hos are there but pressed underneath all the malts. Getting some overripe grapefruits and some other rotten fruits. Mouthfeel is very and wants to be chewy but falls short.

Head uneven, similar to a cask ale, kind of light and big-bubbled yet short-lived, fading to a small layer of bubbles, and laces average to well. Fruity aroma, coupled with ample malt character. Flavor is a letdown for me. Bitterness dominates upfront, not necessarily in a good way, which fades to a tart, almost sour, earthy malt taste. Mouthfeel is a bit lacking, in part due to extremely low carbonation, and drinkability is about the same. This one just didn't hit it off for me, will have to revisit and double-check that my observations were valid.","ppoitras","Dec 18, 2004"

Well the taste follows suite with a funky dirt taste with a slight dirty bitter after taste. Mouthfeel is medium with more carbonation that I expected due to no head showing up. While not being particularly nasty this tasted like crap and is something I may have in the future since its possible I got a bad bottle. It was still before the best by date but oh well.
