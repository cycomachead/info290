The harshness in the nose and taste mellows, and the sweetness grows in complexity with an underlying taste somewhere between burnt brown sugar and black strap molasses.

This beer could get lost in the crowd of bigger, bolder beers but definitely a nice beer to start the night out with or if youâ€™re going to stick with one beer.","GeezLynn","Oct 30, 2011"
3.26,-9.9,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"An OK brew that comes pretty close to the English style IPA with a bit of lacking character and complexity. It does have a nice simplicity about it that encourages itself to be a good session brew.","tavernjef","Oct 28, 2011"
3.55,-1.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"My opinion has not changed about this beer. I know many people really love this but I find it a bit timid for an IPA, English or American. Well crafted as intended and the bottled product matches the draft exactly.","morimech","Oct 26, 2011"
3.41,-5.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Medium body, decent carbonation, sticky and lingering on the tongue. A pretty solid IPA, although it could easily get lost in the crowd.","xnicknj","Sep 15, 2011"
4.09,13,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"O- This is not the greatest IPA ever made, but there is something about it that makes me want more. I prefer it on tap, but some of that preference may have come from having the sixer sit in my car for a while before getting home to enjoy it. If it is any different after having a colder one, I will editÂ my review accordingly.","Ungertaker","Sep 06, 2011"
3.44,-5,3.5,4.5,3,3.5,3,"O- For me this beer was a great nose, but it lacked substance pretty much everywhere else.","jsprain1","Aug 11, 2011"
3.46,-4.4,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"This is my first full Fulton beer.Recommended, definitely worth having, but not a great wow factor here.","lurpy1","Aug 04, 2011"
2.94,-18.8,4,2.5,3,3,3,"Not a bad beer overall. I think I need to give this one another go. Just wasnâ€™t getting it going here.","BucannonXC5","Jul 26, 2011"

3.53,-2.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On tap at Bricks Pub in Blaine, Minnesota. This beer arrives a clear amber-orange color. The head is one inch of white foam that recedes slowly leaving rings of lacing along the sides of the glass until the beer is gone. The aroma is a mix of floral notes and grapefruit. The taste is similar to the aroma, but with a bit more grapefruit. Bitterness is rather moderate for an IPA. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with smooth texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but I can't see myself drinking it often. The mix of floral and grapefruit in the beer really makes me want to drink an IPA that is completely floral.","KarlHungus","Apr 25, 2011"
3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"It's got a decent body to it, and it should given the English-style malt bill. The carbonation is also solid. Overall, this is a solid beer. I keep using that word because that's all this beer is. It isn't good, exactly, not in the strict sense of the word. It is above average, with no real flaws apart from an imbalance towards the American hop flavors.","Reaper16","Apr 05, 2011"
3.58,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability is pretty good, a fairly tasty British IPA, although so by the strength of the alcohol then the hop flavor, which could have been cranked up a tad, even if it was still the appropriate hop bill they used.","ccrida","Oct 14, 2010"
3.95,9.1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"O- a great session ipa with a nice floral hop taste ,nicely drinkable a nice representation that i will order again","gatornation","Aug 25, 2010"
4.32,19.3,4,4.5,4,4,5,"The glacial hops blend well with the malt, but still remain at the forefront of both smell and taste. It tastes a lot like an ESB might if you juiced up the bitterness a notch, clearly letter the imbiber know that hops is in charge. I love balanced beers, as they provide me the best drinking experience.","AmberMan22","Aug 21, 2010"
4.1,13.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D- I like the balance in this beer, nice malt backbone stands to support the nice clean bitterness presented by the American hops. Very drinkable at 6.4% nicely fits in the range of most English style IPA's which allows having a few, but has a great American take on it, with the hop varieties used.","mwagner1018","Aug 12, 2010"
4.2,16,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I love the care put into this beer. The restraint to keep the hops at a level that is not over the top is commendable. Keep up the good work.","BeardedBoffin","Aug 11, 2010"
4.12,13.8,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"I see a lot of new beers at Ed's but this is one of best of the summer so far. I never drank this before but I was instantly impressed by the flavor profile the mango and bitterness is great touch with the malt. I drank a few of these like others have said it can make you a bit of a bar fool. It certainly hits","exonthebottle","Aug 10, 2010"
4.05,11.9,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"I will continue to drink and enjoy this beer. Don't go into it, though, thinking it's something it isn't, as some do.","feloniousmonk","Aug 04, 2010"
3.9,7.7,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability: Very well balanced and easy to drink IPA. Great flavor overall but could use a little more bitterness so I need to dock it a little. Just a touch too balanced for my IPA tastes.","bsp77","Jul 20, 2010"
4.05,11.9,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"D: Very pleasant beer. Enjoyed the cask a great deal. Would like to compare the cask to a regular tap to check out the differences.","sonata2008","Beers"
3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"I've enjoyed this a few places around Minneapolis. It's always reminded me bit of Brooklyn's East India Pale Ale, for the fruity and earthy pairing of hop flavors with a soft bitterness. Really, this is a more sessionable IPA. You can tell it has body and a little more alcohol than a pale ale, but it's not thick or overly bitter. I'd call it a tasty starter-IPA. Certainly worth a try for any beer lover.","tempest","0"
3.68,1.7,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"D: This offering, although light and mild, is still pretty easy to drink. It's a decent brew, but not one for the extreme hopheads.","WYVYRN527","Mar 28, 2010"
4.23,16.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Overall, knocked me off my bar stool. Watch out world, Fulton will bring the pain. Killer IPA by my standards, excitedly looking forward to future releases from the little guys.","BDLbrewster","Mar 14, 2010"
3.78,4.4,4,3.5,4,3,4,"M/D: Medium to lighter body, carbonation seems a touch on the high side. Good drinkability though due to the balance in the taste and the crisp finish. The muted hop flavors increase the drinkability for me as well.","herman77","Mar 07, 2010"
3.82,5.5,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkablity: Oh yes, very easy to drink and great flavor. Easily a session beer. Will definitely order this one again, or pick some up at the store as a summer refresher.","ChopperSmith","Feb 25, 2010"

3.6,-0.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Copper color with one finger head. Nice citrus hop scent with some sweet malt. Pretty balanced taste of citrus hops with a solid malt backbone. Feel is fine. Almost medium bodied, mostly smooth. A bit of prickly carbonation. Easy drinking IPA. Nothing crazy or outstanding, just a solid and easy going IPA. I would welcome this again.","jera1350","Feb 20, 2010"
3.82,5.5,4,4.5,3.5,3,4,"Mouthfeel is a little thin for me, but this is a pretty easy drinking IPA, and another good brew from a Minnesota brewery.","mnstorm99","Feb 20, 2010"
3.26,-9.9,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Overall, kind of disapointed with this out of Fulton. I was looking for a really citrus and floral hopped IPA, and I didn't get it. I still have high hopes for the brewery, because their other offerings look tasty. I think this just needs to be tweaked just a little but, but then again I'm not the brewer.","Mistofminn","Beers"
