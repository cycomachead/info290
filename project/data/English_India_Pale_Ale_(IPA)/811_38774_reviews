"Overall, this is possibly the best IIPA I've had (I'm generally not big into them, for what it's worth). This is not ""too much", which is what I usually say about Imperial IPAs (I'm a bit of a puss.) This is a nice brew to sip on in a cold night in January after class."

"4.18/5.00"
"I enjoyed this beer, however, it does not remind me of the original Kashmir which I really like. To call it ""Imperial Kashmir"" seems a misnomer when you relate it to the original. Overall, this is a good IIPA, however, for the price, I expected more."

"O: An Imperial English IPA is an interesting brew and not one that I find very often. I like the combination of hop flavors and aromas which are not too aggressively bitter and do not linger for too long. Does not drink like it is as high in ABV as it is..."

"Overall, a very good job by Highland makining an Imperial English IPA which is something that isn't seen all too often. One I'm glad I picked up."
""
"Very clear amber body was topped by a one finger thick head, and had lots of carbonation streamers running through it. The smell of the beer was a little muted for the style, and I could detect mango, pineapple, hay, grapefruit, and some spice. The taste was nicely balanced between bitter and sweet, with none overpowering the other. There were some tropical fruit flavors, and a lingering spiciness, but the overall flavor profile was simple and bold. The feel was sticky, and mouth coating, and the finish dry. An unassuming DIPA with decidedly English take."

"Overall 4.0: Outstanding is right. You will search and search for a better Double IPA, but you will have a very hard time finding one better than Imperial Kashmir. Smooth, balanced, nuanced...this beer is an example of brewing excellence. The hops in this beer are all high-palate hops and I can recognize the ""3 C's"": Cascade, Chinook, Columbus. No funky, chunky or skunky hops in this baby. I have had other Highland Brewing beers and this bad mamma jamma is the Emperor of the bunch. Track it down if you can, it comes highly recommended."

"D - Meh, this is somewhere between an American a British IPA. The hops are strongly present, but not particularly pleasant, there is enough malt to balance the bitterness though and it is reasonably drinkable."
""
"Overall: Booze are fairly well masked and not overdone. Not sure I have had an imperial english IPA. Not memorable or all that great but not bad either."
""
"O - A very robust version of an English IPA. Very flavorful and a nice change of pace from the intensely hoppy IPAs I have been drinking lately. Thanks, Jon!"
""
"Of the recent box I received, this was one of the lower-on-my-list-of-excitement bottles. After the pour and sticking my nose into it, I felt my low expectations were justified at least. Then I started drinking it. I'm excited to try the other brews I received, because if this marks the lower end of that box, I'm in for a treat."
"A big boozy malt bomb that's aggressively hopped. I know it's a blurry line, but this really hits as a super hoppy barleywine with all the crazy malt things going on. A bit unbalanced and over sweet, but good and definitely worth the time."
""

"A good amount of larger to moderately sized bubbles gives the head an irregular surface, little under two fingers high, clean white in color, thick sheets of lacing with excellent stickiness. Mild orange amber in color, not really golden, not especially clear and curious absence of any visible bubbles. The nose is extremely sweet with coconut custard, juicy pink grapefruit, molasses, flowers and apricot, peach fruit, balances this out with pepper and cut grass notes and lighter metallic earthiness, strong nostril presence with lots of length and staying power. Full-bodied, creamier and more carbonated than expected based on visual inspection, almost heavy at times. Here too it emphasizes its sweetness with pink and white grapefruit, mandarin orange citrus and pine sap in addition to pineapple, nectarine, apricot fruit. The florality gets lost in the mix. Maple syrup, molasses and brown sugar keep the love fest going but, at the same time, there a hardness to the finish, pepper, baked bread crusts, meadow grasses to green straw. It is boozy for sure and its syrupy texture keeps it adhered to your mouth pores long after you have swallowed it down. Likely over the top for many but if you enjoy the full metal jacket approach now and then this may be up your alley."
""
"O: This is a rather full-bodied IPA so it is one that really needs to be slowly sipped. I definitely would not have more than one of these in a single sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a nice DIPA from Highland. I am partial to a sweeter DIPA that offers that delicious birthday cake-like, sugary sweetness. This one also packs a solid hop punch. It's definitely worth a try."

"O - Pretty tasty but the alcohol too dominant relative to the other flavors imo"
""
""
""
""
""
"A different take on the imperial IPA. Far better than their standard Kashmir IPA in my opinion but still not what I typically look for. Still, no regrets as a one time purchase of something ""just a wee bit different"" and I had no problem finishing the whole bomber."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a pretty good DIPA, especially since its a local brew to me. Nothing I would go extremely out of my way for if it wasn't readily available in your area. If it is, definitely worth a try."
""
"5.8/10"
"O: Not exactly what I expected, but nonetheless a very good beer. On the whole, drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"D: Not a favorite. Pretty big ABV."
"D: It was pretty interesting to try, but I couldn't figure out how to respond to this beer. It's not really a great IIPA, and the malts aren't complex enough to make it a good barleywine... Just kind of a muted compromise between both. I'm not sure what I was supposed to get out of this one."
"Thanks to Deuane for bringing me a few of these back from Asheville when they were released. A 22 ounce bomber bottle (my last one) poured into a standard shaker glass. The ale appears a cloudy deep rich apricot color with at least two fingers of pillowy off white head. The foam leaves behind a thin sticky lace in it's wake. Nose and flavor are of sweet caramelized malts, a nice dose of citrus such as grapefruit and lemon, medium toasted bread, earthy, bitter fruits, still quite a bit of alcohol lingering about. The ale falls somewhere between medium and full bodied with adequate carbonation for a DIPA. Drink 'em up."
"My expectations where met."
"Highland's Imperial offering will pair well with company and dinner. Have a second one on a full stomach."
"Overall a tasty beer. Would like to try a fresher bottle to see if the hops are more upfront."
"So well-balanced, so drinkable, so tasty! Must pick up more."
"A little thin on the mouthfeel, if you ask me. Light to medium bodied but still a slickness and oiliness lends an extra oomph. A little too much carbonation as well. I bet this would be great fresh and even as an older bottle, this one held its own. Pretty good overall and worth a shot, I think. NC has some awesome breweries here and I am glad to be part of them."
"Mouthfeel is full with a very oily sticky residue left on the palate. This is a good and very drinkable DIPA, and I would easily have one every so often."
"Drinkability: When this was younger, I objected to the aspirin-like bitterness (I prefer more citrus); with a bit of age, that flavor profile is now taking a back seat to the malt, but it is still there"
"HV"
"OVerall I think this may have been a quality DiPA at one time, but at this point (this review is here solely for those who still have some of this laying around) it has faded quite a bit i think. Unless this one was one hell of a malty IPA to begin with, I would say this one is well past its prime. Still an enjoyable beverage, but it seems to be a shadow of what it once was. A good beer."
"When you can find it this is a great NC beer to pick up and enjoy!"
"Slightly hazy burnt orange colour with a dense, finger high cap of yellow/beige foam. Good head retention with sticky lacing. Hops jumped out at me when I opened the bottle and there was a lot of fruity citrus character at first - grapefruit and orange - plus a little pine. Behind that was a rich caramel aroma. Great balance. From start to finish it walked a fine line between bitterness, citrusy hops, caramel, and alcohol. Sweetness was a combination of fruity and sugary, well short of cloying. Plenty of warmth, no heat. A bit sticky with soft carbonation. Pretty drinkable for a big beer."
"this one spewed hops from the moment i opened the cap, this was a heavy ipa with a strong ""wet"" hop flavor that perameated the entire beer, the malt was nice and had an apple cider tipe sour presence. the hops started as nice floral hops and finished as strong piney hops. this is a beer that i must have agan, thank god that my cousan lives about 20 minits from the brewery!"
"The body is moderate to full with the underattunation feel to it. Overall a bit distracting with the alcohol coming out. The negative, I would have liked more hops as well and a clear flavor. The positive, a nice blend of hops. More on the ""eh"" side of IIPA's."
"D - Drinkability is good. There is no doubt about a ton of hops being in this beer. The malt base bigger than expected giving some sense of balance to the beer. This one is thick and strong and probably not for the faint at heart. Glad I got to try it."
"Pours a hazy dark golden/orange, thin white head forms, settles to a ring, some lacing. Smell is very malty, toffee, bread pudding, floral, nuts, light pine, some brown sugar, bit of alcohol, not bad. Taste is similar, insanely malty, toffee and brown sugar, pine, grapefruit, sour fruits, some spice, floral, nice bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, some warmth going down but the alcohol is pretty smooth. Very malty for a DIPA, but solid and drinkable. Thanks Russ!"
"Drinkability - IKIPA, a five letter word for 'trouble'. At 10.2 this beer will do you before you know you been done. It ain't right to be this good at this strength. Speaking of which, say Roger, nab me a 1/4bbl for DLD09! ;-)"
"D: Tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, very strong kick, decent representation of style, this is a beer that you can drink for a while until the ABV catches up with you, but there are better 2IPA's out there."
"drinkability is good. fairly well balanced, but a bit unbalanced toward alcohol. solid malt base, but not quite enough hops to hold it all together. still, for one of the first > 8% brews to come out of NC it's good stuff."
"This beer pours clear reddish gold with a small to medium head. Aroma is stong pine and citrusy hops with a bit of sweetness in the nose as well. Taste is sweet which of course is off set by copious hops. Nice hop profile. Citrus, pine, herbal- not any flavor is too dominant. A touch of alcohol is noticeable in the finish. Very light pleasant aftertaste. Very balanced. Everything really works well together here. Full bodied with low carbonation. Pretty drinkable despite the alcohol."
"Taste & mouthfeel: Honey-like sweetness, tropical fruit and citrus with a resiny bitterness beneath. This is rich, sweet and fairly heavy for the style. The finish brings out a bitter earthy hop note that lingers on the palate for quite a while. Balance and complexity are excellent; this is a well-made DIPA. While I generally prefer this style to be lighter in body and malt presence, I still enjoyed this."
"Full bodied, good carbonation. Balance is most definitely extreme. Alcohol is masked nicely, but the richness of this brew makes it a little less drinkable than other versions of the style. Spiciness is wonderful. I would venture to call this one an Extreme Winter Warmer."
"prosit, MK"
"D - This is just too sweet and not hoppy enough for a DIPA. One was plenty."
"D-I love this beer. Probably the first NC beer I've had a would love more after trying this one"
"D - goes down easy."
"Thanks wcudwight, this one is what the UGLY BIF is all about!!"
"Notes: This is an odd, yet enjoyable, brew. I've seen others say it leans toward barleywine. All I can say is it's nice and smooth with a high ABV, a little lacking on hop kick, but something about it draws me back."
"I like the flavor balance and concept a lot, but the feel lacks for me what it seems to need in depth, cutting through the flavor and cleaning off the palate with each sip. That plus the abv make it a treat to enjoy, but not to crave."
"I started this beer cool, after a scant hour in the fridge, and as it warmed the alcohol bullied its way to the front of the lunchline but I found it pleasant and very complimentary to the huge hop profile of this delicious beer. Strong and assertive, yet silky and seductive to those who understand its power, this beer is a treat for the hop fanatic. I will be heading back to the brewery to pick up another couple bottles as soon as I can."
"This was a pretty solid Imperial IPA that possessed a big mix of hops, malt, and alcohol. Unfortunately, I think it has maybe just a tad too much beef and heat to keep the drinkibility high though."
" envelope. A bit sweeter than I care for, but very well made and a nice change up."
"No hint of the 10%, but this brew is mellowing me out nicely - I'm a lucky man to have partaken it."
"An amazing beer overall. Hopefully more will be brewed next year."
"This beer poured a copper color with a huge off white head with great lacing. The aroma was spicy with hints of citrus. The taste was a great IPA taste. Great hoppiness with hints of citrus. The mouthfeel was creamy and heavy body with medium carbonation. Overall a great beer!! Hope we get Highland down here in LA soon!! Great company who makes great beer."
"Heard a lot about this beer when it was released and was eager to see what it was about, first beer from Highland, too bad this will only be brewed once because it was not too bad, kind of expensive at twelve dollars a bottle though, would drink again if I got some more, recommended"
"Drinkability - Damn good! Reminded me more of a barley wine, but was highly enjoyable never the less."
"OK but really tastes more like a Barley Wine. Malt is stronger than the hops here and leaves me want tropical fruit flavor in my glass. OK I guess."
"Edit: Lowered taste to 3.0 - the flavors just do not come together or work well here after having finished about 12 ounces of it."
"Pours a cloudy golden hued caramel amber color with a full finger eggshell colored loose foamy head that fades to surface. Leaves a spotty lacing pattern in trail. The smell is really interesting. If i didn't know better i'd think that i was smelling a barleywine. A strong rich caramel malt dominates a bright floral note. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is heavy, creamy and sweet. Full flavored, the rich caramel malt dominates the taste. A complex blend of unbalanced maltiness over a fruity hop character that really keeps things interesting. Having a ton of fun with this one; it really caught me by surprise. Appreciate the opportunity to sample it thanks to drunkmonk."
"D: This is a sure sipper. One does not rush through 22 oz of 10.2% beer. I expect this will last through at least the first half of the game (AFC champ) today."
"Numbing, herbal, piny hop bitterness right off the bat. Sugary butterscotch and caramel malts fight back. Boozy-sweet fruits round out the palate. Herbal hop bitterness picks up again in the finish. Traces of butterscotch and pineapple in the end. Full-bodied with a smooth creamy mouthfeel. Not too hot, but 22 oz. easily warmed me up on this cold night in Michigan!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" beige over the slightly cloudy orangey amber brew. Dense head holds steady, with sporadic lacing. Aroma is piercing fruity pine hops. Taste is sweet maltiness upfront, tart citrus in the middle, and closes with a plethora of pine. Alcohol and warming form an afterglow. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good for the style."
"I had very high hopes for Imperial Kashmir IPA. It turns out that it's my least favorite beer from what I think is North Carolina's best brewery. I don't really care if this 'Limited Edition 2007' offering sees the light of day in 2008 and beyond unless Highland does some major tinkering. Thanks Loki."
"Overall- A highly drinkable Imp. IPA. A definite addition to your fridge or Wants list!"
"The flavor is significantly bolder, but I prefer the aroma more at this point. Its hoppy, its strong, its got a good solid bitterness, and its different. Not anything like your atypical West-coast variety, this is more green, earthy, and minty. An interesting beer but probably a little young to be really good when I cracked this bottle 2 or 3 months after its release."
"Man it kicks ass to find this brew up here in western NY,poured from the bottle a deep slight hazed burnt orange with a tight formed 1 1/2 finger white head.Deep piney aromas in the nose with some grapefruit rind and caramel sweetness.Resiny flavors really hit up front like that of leather and pine with underlying grapefruit rind and a hefty caramel base.I have drank alot of Highland brews in the past but this takes the cake it kicks major arss."
"Cheers to barleywinebrewer for sharing this great treat from the South!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a crisp carbonation. I think this wold have benefited from aging a bit to mellow out."
"Body is quite huge with moderate carbonation and a very slick, meaty mouthfeel. Pretty darn good but certainly doesn't warrant the hefty price tag."
"D: NC microbrews represent! Next time I go to Asheville I'll buy a lot more!"
"M/D: Medium body that doesn't seem to be too oily. A nice layer of carbonation gives this one a somewhat velvety character. Drinkability is good as well, especially for 10.20%. This is really a very good example of a IIPA."
"Pours a nice hazy dark golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is mostly hops, with a very nice touch of malts, not much pines, but some citrus, and the usual caramel. The taste is sweet at first, then some nice hoppyness, and then some malts, and some slight citrus. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very nice DIPA, would recommend."
"all n all an ok good beer, some cheap off flavors, nothing special.. imperial??"
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Thanks goes to NCSUdo for sending some of this my way!"
"22 oz bottle split between three people. Color was ruddy orange with a good soapy head. The smell was intense hops but not pine or citrus. the taste was very hoppy with some tropical fruit flavors but not quite a West Coast. The only complaint I had with this beer was the astringency on my tongue. it got worse as I got to the bottom of my glass. Still, nice to be able to try this one."
"Very well done. Certainly one of Highland's better efforts. Many thanks to mntlover for sending this one to western Kentucky."
"The dominating flavor here is cereal-rich malts mixed with floral hops and fresh cut grass. It's certainly original as far as IIPA's are concerned. Some type of barley/organic greeneries are present too...a bit hard to place exactly where I've tasted it before, but it's familiar. The body is of medium-high thickness, and quite viscous across the palate. Well carbonated, too, and the warming note from the alcohol is an added plus. Drinkability is a bit limited...this is a thick, heavy double IPA. I'd be in real trouble trying to finish an entire bomber by myself...thankfully, trep was around to help me out."
"Thanks to NCSUdo for the sample. I wish I could go pick up more of this at the store."
"Drinkability is good this is one big beer loaded with hops, decent malt base but hidden well by the hops. Some alcohol noted as it warms, like to see how this one matures."
"A really nice quenching beer, I really enjoyed this and wish I could get some more."
"Quite a treat!"
"A classification blurring beer if ever I've had one. Seems more of an American Barleywine to me but hey when it's this drinkable and this good you can call it what you want. ME, I'm happy to have had a chance to try this great beer."
"Oh, the alcohol is well disguised, so take it easy!"
"Best beer I've had from Highland.Nice to see them stretch their legs a bit with this. I'm only sorry its a one-off. I bought my bottles directly from the brewery on their release day. Pours a dark orange/amber with a decent head and some lacing. Not bad given the abv- this is a big beer. The smell is sweet, spicy, and quite hoppy with a nice range of hop aromas- piney, citrusy, and earthy. Very well balanced, and quite obviously lots of malt and hops. Extreme all around. The taste is heavenly. Beautifully balanced hop and malts. Quite a bit of hop bitterness that grows as you drink. Similar hop profile to the nose, with the finish especially earthy. Mouthfeel is substantial, with lots of hop oils and a creamy finish. Absolutely delicious and best fresh."
"Nicely spicy and bitter finish. Alcohol is well hidden. A bit too 'balanced' for my taste."
"Many thanks go out to my Aunt Marsha of Black Mountain for making a stop at Bruisin' Ales to score me a few bottles. Poured into a Duvel snifter a deep amber that was very thick and somewhat opaque. The frothy head slowly diminished to a thin layer and left decent lacing on the glass. Aroma was abundant earthy pine hops and burnt caramel. The taste was a wonderful balance of pine hops with a hint of citrus mixing wonderfully with deep caramel malts and a hint of brown sugar. The beer is certainly on the heavy side with some sticky alcohol, but even so, it is still very refreshing and not at all overbearing. I am willing to go so far as to rank this right up there with Dreadnaught and Ruination as one of my new favorite DIPAs, here's to hoping they decide to drop the limited status, or at least up the hops and alcohol a little on their Kashmir IPA as this one only proves that's what that beer needs."
"D - I'm not a huge hop head and this was a very good beer..another great product from Highland brewing"
"Pours a dark rich copper with a somewhat foggy look that has a big chunky two finger off-white head that slowly dies down to a nice layer that remains throughout. Smell is a light floral perfume like aroma with a bit of pink grapefruit in the nose as well. Minor caramel malt with a bit of dirty earth scent too. Taste is a syrupy pine hop flavor with a big caramel malt presence. Some earth hop flavors with a drying effect as well. Some dry wheat flavors seem to appear in the aftertaste that is a mix of dry hops and brown sugar. Thick almost full body with a tingle of carbonation. Some decent drinkability but it's big mouthfeel hurts it a bit. Solid DIPA, but there are many out there that surpass it."
"Bottle to snifter yields a light, ruby body with mild carbonation and leaves light seafoam retention that returns back into the body rather quickly. The smell is powerful in strength but light in substance with floral hops that are exceptionally sweet and oily. The smell is light with pine and grapefruit and then a nice sugary sweetness. The taste is also delightful with a syrupy sweetness and light floral complexities. Quite complex yet not overly bitter like its peers of the style. The 10.2% ETOH is magically hidden, nowhere to be found in the taste but it has a pleasant warming feeling on the body and tongue. A well-balanced oily mouthfeel and lightness makes this incredibly drinkable although the alcohol will catch up with you quickly. The only downfall of this beer is its incredibly limited availability. This one is a privilege to sample."
"Single bottle from Bruisin' Ales. I've got three more bottles picked up at the brewery this past weekend; only one is for myself, and it's gonna be hard to send the other two away."
"With great appreciation to Mike from Cole's for sharing his bomber. Soapy head. Yeast and complex meld of five hops, including dry hops. this is not a hop bombing DIPA. Really drinkable as I had this after several other beers, and was reluctant to rate it but it really stood out."
"Drinkability: Quite nice. I look forward to seeing how this one ages and whether or not Highland will continue this trend of releasing an imperialized version of their current beer line. An Imperial Black Mocha Stout might be nice."
"The beer is drinkable now, but it is a big beer and pretty green. I bet in a year the drinkability will be up to a 5."
"As the beer warms up the malt backbone starts to balance the mix and makes a big silky mouthfeel on the finish. Nobody list the ibu on the bottle but if I had to quess it would be 112 ibu ? Great to see this brewery flex some muscle!"
"Poured a nice reddish orange with a fair head. The beer is clear with no cloudiness or suspended matter. The smell is bitter piney hops. Also some fruitiness as well. The taste is hoppy as one can imagine with the label stating 200 pounds of hops in 50 barrels. The abv is evident here as well. This is an aggresive beer that likes to show it's teeth. The mouthfeel is smooth with a abv bite in the aftertaste. Drinkability is fair but I think this brew could use a little shelf time to allow it to lay down a bit."
"This beer does not age well. If you have it, I'd recommend drinking it NOW."
" Overall this was easily one of m,y favorite of the bigger IPA's I have had. It could calm down with time, but is just soo fresh now that it is the perfect time to have. If you can get it, you have it is just really great!"
