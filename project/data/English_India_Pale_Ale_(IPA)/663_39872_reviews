"Not as bad as I thought it would be."
""
"12 oz bottle poured in a stemmed wine glass.  Drinkable IPA."
"This was just one month old but the hops were not suitably strong enough to warrant calling this an IPA. I get a mixture of lemon and a light herbal note that compliments a sweet caramel body. Some rose petal and a ribbon of floral perfume coasts through. This is weak and cheap, but at $1 a bottle that's to be expected. I found this off style but with enough flavor to warrant a try."
"Not great, not that bad though"
"This cheap IPA gets a almost 3 overall rating only because it connects to a Pabst skunkiness that I have a weak spot for.  nostalgia aside, the carmel color and drinkability of this decently heavy IPA is a good cheap option."

"The FDA should have a rule that a label cannot say IPA unless hops have actually touched liquid. Glad I bought one bottle instead of a whole 6-pack at Trader Joes. Possibly the recipe changed? ABV is 5.7% and color is closer to brown than to ""bronze"" or ""copper"" in previous reviews. No trace of Federal Jack on the label, and it says brewed in Portland ME not Kennebunkport. Definitely not worth $6 a six-pack when Mission Street IPA is the same price."

"With my limited experience judging beer, I have a hard time understanding some of the reviews here. Folks go into a lot of detail about things that I don't make out – like caramel and malty taste factors, and grassy hop smell. I can tell that there are hops in this brew and that it has a crisp refreshing taste; and someone said that the finish is dry – I agree. The head is light, and lacing is minimal, but when all is said and done there's still a wee bit left. Torpedo blows this brew out of the water, but it's a good beer, and as of this review will be my standard of comparison for a good average brew (3 points across the board). I'm reporting on a 12 oz. bottle from Trader Jose's with a freshness date of June 2015."

"I was surprised to see this beer rate so poorly. I flew in from CA and was treated by one of these beers which was purchased at Trader Joe's (I am always hesitant to buy or drink beer from a discount beer place. Especially a place that doesn't store beer the correct way.). The beer was nothing outstanding but I did not detect any crazy off flavors or anything unpleasant. The one thing I didn't like is that this beer comes off more like a Pale Ale than an IPA. Low hop aroma and flavor, not a very bitter beer and not the most ABV ( this beer doesn't even top 5.7). The one thing I liked about this beer is the easy drinking qualities this beer had. I had several and was not sluring my words and the beer tasted just fine. If someone passed me this beer in a glass and told me nothing about it, I would not even have a single complaint."
""
""
"It's drinkable, but kind of blah, and not very IPA-like."
""
""
""
""

"All that being said, it's not a bad beer at all. Tho not outstanding, it's plenty drinkable."

"When into trader joe's to get a six. it was sandwiched in between a bunch of good beers I knew well, but were about 8/9 dollars a six Went for the bargain at 5.99. It tasted like nothing, except a little hoppy at the end. It reminded me of Bud Red Dog (from back in Highschool) with a hoppy (but not so happy) ending. I wish I went for the 9 dollar six. KBC IPA is the kind of beer one buys once. I will drink it if it was free, but certainly would not buy it again. Life is too short."
""
""
"An ok IPA, chilled for a warm day. The price is the best thing about it."
""
"The taste tends to lean more on the sweet side than the hoppy side,. This is OK but for an IPA I was expecting more of a bite. Still, there is a decent caramel maltiness followed by the bitterness. Nothing extra-ordinary but fairly drinkable"
""
""
""
"Deep copper color with brilliant clarity. Minimal head covers most of the top of this beer. Aroma of pine like hops but they don't seem very prominent. The mouth is a bit warm and salty. The flavor is a bit like that of an IPA strained through a dirty sock. The aroma seems to promise more but that taste is rather odd."
""
""
""
"I'm hoping this is the same beer that is also referred to as KBC IPA? The label looks different from what's pictured here but it does say Kennebunkport Brewing. I actually like this a lot, even though it has a taste that's somewhat thinner and maybe slightly more bitter than my favorite IPAs. I find it crisp and refreshing, and besides that it's a good choice for the value - only $6 for 6 at Trader Joe's!"
""
""
"Overall: I am a huge IPA guy and I did not really care for this brew. They could have done better."
"Poured into my Sam Adams perfect pint glass, best by 4/14. Pours a bright orange, with a one inch white head, that leaves some lace. Smell is hard candy, tangerine, apple cider, grapefruit, and caramel. Taste is all about hard candy, caramel, and grapefruit. Body is medium, plenty of carbonation, a little dry, and goes down easy enough. Not my thing, but I am not a huge fan of English IPAS."
""
""
"Overall: I want to like this beer, I really do...but unfortunately I would not recommend it. It smells too sweet, isn't very well balanced in flavors and is just missing something special to make it stand out. It isn't the worst I've had, but it certainly isn't the best. It's just a boring, average IPA with nothing special to offer."

"This is a drinkable, affordable (read: inexpensive) English IPA. I'm surprised to read so many negative reviews. Perhaps my colleagues on BA were expecting the kind of in-your-face hop-wallop that American IPAs offer. This beer doesn't offer anything like that. It's very sweet, heavily malted, fairly bitter, and throws in lots of citral and a few herbal notes for good measure. I'm okay with that."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall to the point IPA at a reasonable price. Won't blow you away with flavor but still has more than your standard beer."
""

"I found this to be a very enjoyable brew with nice bitterness, but not overly alcoholic. It had adequate carbonation, a solid mouth-feel, and a good finish. I like an IPA that is strong on bitterness, but less than 7.0% alcohol, so I can enjoy more than one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"solid english-style IPA, especially at the cheap price point. the misleading label (the word english is nowhere to be seen) can be attributed to the low score here."
""
"Overall: A bad IPA but an ok amber."
""
"o: Very good IPA. Worth buying again."
"o: I have enjoied most beers I have tasted from Maine - was very excited to try this beer however I feel as though they were truly trying to put to much into the bottle and the end result is an over-flavored, awkward beer."
""
"This is a below average example of the style. Way too much caramel and a little too spicy."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I am not the biggest fan of this beer, I was hoping for something a little more balanced and with more aromatic/flavorful hops than just the bittering ones. Not sure I would have another of these and I really enjoy almost all IPAs."
"Overall a pretty good English IPA. Not to be compared with an American IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Light to medium body, medium carbonation…fluffs up nice creating an earthy, spicy hops cloud on my palate…not overly resinous…nice…(3.98/5)"
"O: unbalanced, not at all what an IPA should resemble. Just a terrible beer."
""
"Overall: Fair. If you convince yourself you're drinking an amber ale with a bit of hoppiness, you might be impressed. If you're at Trader Joe's looking for a bargain IPA, I'd go with their superior State Street label."
"Just not what I expect in an ipa. Overly sweet, and likely using old hops. The aroma is god-awful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Even for the price, this vacilates between messy and mediocre - there are far better choices, especially in SoCal - I'd advise avoidance. That said, if my expectations were set for an ""English IPA"" I might re-evaluate..."
""

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium, coppery amber. Half finger off wthite head with decent retention and light lacing. Aroma dominated by caramel malt with faint hops; sweet and a hint of diacetyl. Flavor starts malty, with light sweet fruit and caramel malt, but changes to a dryer, grassy malt finish with somewhat astringent hop finish. Medium bodied. Odd that this was labeled as an IPA, there is little distinct hop presence except for bittering hops in the finish. The color, maltiness and low key neutral hops seem to put this solidly in the amber ale category. An adequate amber ale with a somewhat sweet, but decently malty start, but unbalanced with a mediocre finish. Slight point reduction for not being to style."

"I think from the the description of this IPA of the package, this is an English IPA. And, all the characteristics match that of an EIPA. So taking that in to account, KBC IPA is light tasty and did a great job at creating an authentic EIPA."
"Overall meh, hops are not very forward, malts are more pronounced, not quite an ipa."
""
""
"Pours a murky dark orange with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Thin foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and some slight herbal aromas. Taste is extremely malty up front with some herbal and mineral flavors on the finish. There is a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is most definitely not a typical IPA. Again, this particular beer is not as bad as I had heard but it's not something I would revisit."
""
"Never really got into this beer. I’d never try it again. Kind of reminded me of a homeless man’s Newcastle."
""
"Overall: not a good IPA at all, actually not a good beer in general. I picked up a 6 pack for $5 on a gamble. Let this review save you $5."
"This was probably the most unbalanced and oddest/ grossest tasting beers I've ever had. It tasted nothing like the style. It was almost sweet and spiced like their winter ale. The hops tasted like they were synthetic and seldomely added to the wort."
"Overall: Not a very memorable beer. The hops are there in the pine and citrus notes but they are weak and simple."
""
"O: By far the most disappointing TJ's beer I have tried to date. Not undrinkable, but does not fit the style. Judging according to the style, it is down right not good. As a beverage it's not bad, as an IPA it is bad. Will not buy this one again."
"O: like trying new stuff but this was towards the bottom of what i have tried... Definately NOT an IPA? Hopefully you read this before you buy it..."
""
"Not the best IPA but is crazy cheap so I guess you get what you pay for."
""
"Feels spicy, warm, and not refreshing at all. I think this is a strong British style IPA. If it was relabled as such, maybe the ratings would ba a bit better for this... Maybe not."
""
""
"Overall: better than merely drinkable, yet this is no IPA. Will taste better if you think of it as an amber or brown ale."
"DOA"
""
""
"O - I've had worse IPA's but I've also had better Pale Ales."
"This beer stinks, easily one of the worsts IPA's I have ever had, not even hoppy enough to be a good amber."
""
"Shame on Trader Joe's for selling this swill, and marketing it as an IPA! Of course, they sell some cheapo/not-so-good beer, but they don't pretend it is something else. The fake craft IPAs from major grocery chains like Safeway are light-years ahead of this stuff. Pretty awful."
"Aroma is not particularly strong, and is more fruity and floral than hoppy. It pours a clear dark orange amber with a thick and fluffy ivory head. Flavor is fairly hoppy and woody with a sweet fruity overtone, almost no bitterness. Tastes more like a regular ale than an IPA. Smooth texture has firm body and a little bit of tingle. Fair to middlin', but still worth a fair shake."
""
"Overall this is certainly drinkable, worth a try and maybe a little more. Could be a worthy every day beer if the price is right - which it might be as it came from Trader Joe's I believe (thanks brother for the bottle)."
"Kennebunkport IPA has almost nothing to recommend it and was a drain pour for me. It's not undrinkable, but I have no shortage of good beers waiting to be drunk - why waste time here? Alas, you can't win them all."
"O: I wouldn't pick up another 6 pack of this. It's the price that called to me, and the desire to try something from Maine. AAt $4.49 I can't say I lost too much."
"Kind of an AMber ale English ""IPA"" hybrid. Not great but certainly worth the $5.99 I paid at Trader Joes. No IPA, but a decent drinker."
"O) This beer taste decent, but since I read the label I was expecting an IPA. So my rating is based on the actual taste of the beer and I am ignoring the style label. (Maybe Federal Jack's will change the classification)."
"Overall...not that great. Tastes bland."
"Pours an orangish yellow sort of color. Smells like a dirty shoe. I actually put my nose to, pulled back and went ""UGH!"". Some hops on the nose, maybe some citrus, but just doesn't smell appealing at all. Taste seems to be more malty than hoppy. There are hops there, just not much of em. Mouthfeel is at least a bit creamy, carbonated, and nice. Overall, average at best. However, it's a buck, not not bad for a buck."
"Conclusion: it's not a bad beer, it's just not what it claims to be (IPA). As an IPA I give it a 2. As an American PA I'd give it a 4."
"Final thought - at $1 a bottle and 6.2% abv, give it a try if you haven't had it"
"Picked up a sixer for $5.99 at TJ's the other day. No clue what it was but it said IPA....and there is a new label to confuse the masses. The appearance is a nice amber colored ale that produces a big foamy off-white head that clings to the glass. The smell consists of a lot of bubble gum whiffs, floral and some apricot skin. A little too much in the gum flavor. The taste is somewhat spicy up front with a band-aid taste next and some fading hops in the back of the throat. A lot of malt in the mix too. It has a medicine-like aftertaste with a slight bitterness. Sort of a mess. Overall I didn't hate the sixer for the price. I would deem this more of a Pale Ale and would surly be disappointed to taste this at an IPA festival. For what it's worth, it's different. I will not be buying more even at that price but am happy to have given it a shot."
"It is going to be hard to finish this bottle. Since I couldn't make my own sixer at trader Joe's, I've got 5 left to give to 'friends""."
"Pours a reddish gold with a creamy tall quivering head; smells of stale beer and wet grains; taste is extremely malty and sickeningly sweet with a metallic aftertaste--not sure where the hops are; not much like an IPA at all"
"T: Gross, gross, gross, gross, gross. Possibly the worst beer I've ever had. I didn't think anything could be worse than Kennebunkport's Wheat Beer but this blows that one away. It has a weird lager flavor upfront followed by this really off, acidic metallic flavor that goes through the finish. It's a little bitter, but not in a hoppy way at all. This beer tastes like licking rust. Absolutely awful. Avoid at all costs!"
"O: Trader Joe's sells some really nice, good quality budget brews. This sadly, ain't one of them. Pick up a sixer of their Mission St. IPA instead and call it a day, as Kennebunkport's IPA is just that: bunk."
"O - Very below average IPA. I wouldn't even consider this a true IPA due to the lack of hop bitterness and flavor. Not only is this not an ideal IPA, it is also not an ideal beer in general. I will avoid this beer in the future."
"It's Opening Day for my ChiSox, and this is the random beer to help celebrate. Best Before 05/2011...check. It pours a mostly clear orange flesh-amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, wheat, coriander, light black pepper, light cilantro, light lemon zest, and light caramel. We're definitely looking at some spicy citrus hops here, folks, so no misconceptions regarding pine should enter into things. The taste revels in the juxtaposition between the sweet caramel and light buttery biscuit and the peppery, herbal, bitter hops that nestle thereamongst. The malt, though, drops out kinda quickly, leaving a sensation akin to licking bay leaves (or something along those lines. There's definitely chlorophyll involved.) So a promising start shoots off a cliff a bit, but, luckily, not too fast to really torpedo things entirely. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish. Overall, I'm not putting this in the IPA pantheon, but I'd certainly consider drinking one again."
"Poured this from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer poured a burnt orange color semi cloudy. It produced a white head but retention was poor. After 1 min there was 0 head left. The aroma of the beer is not what I would expect for an IPA. I smell very slight amount of hops but mostly a floral and medicinal aroma. It gets worse with the taste- No hops to speak of- A very bad medicinal taste and hints of caramel. Not sure how this can be an IPA. Overall very bad beer. If I did drain pours, this would be one. IM going to suck it up and take one for the team."
"*this is officially my first fail- didn't think it would come so soon"
"Got this beer as a ""gift"" I would not consider this an IPA at all. There is no hop aroma, no hop flavor. A very poor pale ale at best. Would not recommend especially if you enjoy a good quality IPA. The only thing this beer has in its favor is that it pours a nice color and had a decent head."
"Picked this up at trader joes. Poured a dark amber color with an average amount of head. Not the typical hoppy nose. Smells a little off. Not a good flavor either. Doesn't seem like an IPA at all. Need to pound this one and move on Not a big fan of this beer. Live and learn."
"D- not great. 4 oz in, and I'm done with this. I keep trying to like it, but it's just nothing..."
"Drinkability: Did they mislabel their amber ale as an IPA? Honestly, I wouldn't have guessed this was an IPA if they hadn't called it that. There are almost no hops to speak of and it has a strange fruity/caramel flavor to it. It's not a bad beer, just not an IPA. Avoid..."
"D - I never drain pour beer. But this is as close as it gets. I recommend avoiding this beer. Worst IPA ever!"
"Drinkability: This really isn't bad overall as a beer, but as an IPA, it is a bit too sweet and not dry enough. It could use some more hop additions for sure, but is still a decent drink. Maybe a good IPA for those new to beer/hops."
"OVERALL: The first few sip of this beer were better than the middle and end of the glass. It was still good all the way through, but as the sour and sweet flavors built on the palate, it became less and less of the bitter and hoppy IPA I seemed to be drinking in the beginning."
"D - The beer is beautiful. However the aromas and flavors are both off for the style and not very appealing."
"D: The appearance and aftertaste are about as good as this IPA gets. The flavor underwhelmed me, but at the price point of $5.99/6pk, I can't find too many complaints here. An interesting contract brew with a special deal at Trader Joe's? That ""allure"" aside, it's a pretty forgettable, one-dimensional IPA."
"D -- Drinkability is not offensive, but the mild astringency could grow fatiguing. This isn't quite in the American IPA category, but it's also a bit too hoppy-bitter to be an English IPA -- closer to that than American, though."
"D: This tiptoes along the line between IPA and plain old pale ale. As a pale ale, this would be boring and flat. As an IPA, this is pretty far off the mark: sweet, lacking substantial bitterness, and featuring few noteworthy hop flavors or aromas. It's not a bad beer, but it's disappointingly weak for the style and unlikely to impress."
"What can I write in this review that will differentiate it from the others? Decent appearance with a fair head retention, a slightly floral scent and a non-obtrusive taste that leaves a lot to be desired. A slight bitterness comes in during the aftertaste, with carbonation being very present. I echo hmk22's comment that this could be considered a ""gateway beer"" but it's largely forgettable. Not bad for a dollar."
"I'm not as negative as some reviewers about this beer...it's not going to make the IPA Hall of Fame, but it's a decent IPA style for the price. I find that context is important with a lot of these Trader Joe's and Whole Foods ""house brand"" beers -- they are from no-name or ""dba"" breweries and are probably developed for palates that are (or aspire to be) above the BMC fray but aren't ready to (say) sign up for a BA account. So beer aficionados will always be a little disappointed (as the reviews illustrate), but TJs and WF are legendary for reading their customer base and giving them what they want, so these offerings fill a niche, and not so badly IMO. Who knows, maybe they can be ""gateway"" beers to the major stuff."
"I don't think I would choose this beer again if I had another beer to choose from...depending on the choice of course!"
"D: It's OK, but it is not really much of an AIPA. I think the marks would be better if they labeled it an amber or copper ale. The price is nice, however."
"Drinkability is average. This one is not worthy of mass consumption"
"For my two cents, I think it really tastes like they brought some butthole soup to the bottling line."
"D - Not the most horrid thing on earth, but it wasn't a strong and bitter IPA by any measure. Seemed a little synthetic to me."
"If I change my mind, I will update my review."
"D - Moderate drinkability. A bit filling at times. ABV unlisted. A decent beer to have with equally strong cheese. Perhaps not entirely great on its own."
"This would be a good pale at a brewpub, not so much when competing with Green Flash's and Boulder Brewing's hoppy beers. Still, this would be a good sessioner from the draught."
"(Reviewed from notes)"
"d: mild mannered ipa, drinkability is the only thing I am impressed with"
"I'm really glad I only had one bottle of this. I definitely won't look for this beer again."
"D: If you are looking for an IPA, you might want to keep looking. This doesn't taste, nor feel like one. Its not horrendous, but its not great either."
"Kennebunkport IPA is drinkable in that it hardly tastes like a beer (certainly not an IPA). At best you could call this a bad take on a Scottish Ale; that would be a gift. I suppose it's befitting that the core of their name is ""bunk;"" this beer is a mockery at best. Again, it isn't an IPA; thus, it is a failure."
"Overall: Overall the beer is an OK IPA. The beer doesnt overwhelm with hops, which I liked, but most hop lovers might be disappointed. If you want an IPA with minimal hops, than give this beer a try."
"Got a 6pack from Trader Joes for $6. Not bad for the price. Has a pleasant and mild fruity taste for an IPA. Not very hoppy at all. Decent for a warm spring afternoon. I wouldn't go out of my way to get it but might pick it up again considering the price. This is truly a ""get what you pay for"" beer at $6."
"12 ounce bottle, from a six pack a buddy purchased at Trader Joe's. Has ""Best enjoyed before"" dating notched onto the side of the label. Pours clear, glowing orange tinged amber, medium tan head, leaves barely adequate bits of lace. Lightly leafy hop nose. On the malty side for an AIPA. Hops barely present and not packing anything close to a punch. Works as a sessioner. Nothing to get too excited about."
"An IPA without hops is like AC/DC without rock. A travesty."
"Would I drink it again? Maybe. It's cheap and easily available at Trader Joes which is a plus. I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me. But I'm not going out of my way to get it when there's better beers, even in this price range."
"Overall this is a very tasty beer, but for an ipa it is terrible. It does not follow the style at all and I will have to give it a bad rateing only based on the style. Otherwise a great beer, awsome drinkability."
"This IPA has arrived smack dab in the middle of my IPA kick. It's a quaffable beer with a nice floral nose. Copper in color and sweet to finish. It starts with a citrus hop scent and, while in the mouth, dances as it finishes down. It is a bit more of a session beer vs. a treat and in a $6.00 six pack market, I like that. I enjoyed it, you should too."
"Disappointing on the palate to say the least. Some washed out grains and a touch of hops is the most that this beer musters in the flavor department. It felt a little dishwater like through the center. This isn't one of my favorites."
"Really light and crisp with the hoppy bite and high carbonation. Drinkability is ok for an IPA but not as hoppy as I expected."
"This was in no ways reminiscent of any IPA I have ever had... To me an OK beer, and a way below average IPA."
"This is not a bad beer. However, it is an average, at best, IPA. Very reminiscent of Fuller's ESB. I would drink this again, but not as an IPA."
"Overall very drinkable, just not remarkable."
"D- is overall a bad IPA but a good bitter or esb. Needs to have the right name. It ticks me off when breweries label a beer an ipa to sell more beer when it is obviously not."
"It's a really weird beer. I'm drinking it right now, and it's just not an IPA, or even an east-coast IPA, as one would expect. Very little hop bitterness. No bitter backbone. Sweet, but with a weird sort of off-flavor that shows up occasionally, especially in the aroma. Simply not to style as an american pale ale. More like a british ale, but not a good one either. There's probably a reason these are only found in Trader Joes. Don't let the cheapness sucker you in."
"very delicious and has all the ingredients of a good mild american ipa."
"Pours clear dark amber with little head. Faint aroma. No lacing. Taste is okay, though not as hoppy as I would like from an IPA. More sweet malts in the flavor than anything, but not unpleasant. Some caramel and buttery accents. Some alcohol warmth. OK."
"D: Not bad, really. Easy enough to drink."
"Drinkability: not a bad beer for the price, but not something i'm going to have a craving for."
"So, if I just wanted a beer, this could be a decent goto. If I wanted an IPA? Naaahhh... with that I'm not so sure. That's why I have the taste as 3... really it tastes good, but it doesn't taste like an IPA."
"I'd pass on this unless you are given one for free or you just wanna try as many IPA's as possible."
"Not a bad IPA. Not my favorite, but perhaps I'll get it again sometime. Semi exciting to consume."
"M + D: Medium bodied, a little slick and oily. It doesn't leave a whole lot of flavour behind, but there is a touch that I can appreciate. Pretty straight up drinking, and I'd be willing to give it another go."
"Slightly hazed golden orange with a tall head of foam that dissipates to a soapy layer. Sweet floral and sugary citrus hop aroma, diacetyl, and biscuit malts. The flavor is of citrusy, grassy hops finishing with some fresh grain and toasted caramel. Again, a little buttery which is not entirely unexpected considering Kennebunkport is associated with Shipyard (as I understand it) and Ringwood is probably used without an adequate diacetyl rest. Slightly syrupy feeling, but otherwise medium bodied and modestly bitter compared to many other IPAs. Not bad though, especially for the price. I'll consider picking it up whenever I find myself in TJ's...the cheap prices are too hard to resist."
"D - This is a below average IPA. It just doesn't have a great IPA flavor. It was fairly dull."
"Copper colored with a foamy blonde head that leaves slippery lace on the glass. Smells of pineapple, grapefruit and bready yeast. Taste is much like the smell, fruit and caramel with a very mild hop bite. Medium mouthfeel with crisp carbonation. This beer is not for most extreme beer people, it's pretty wimpy for an IPA but not unpleasant."
"would have fared a little better as an english IPA"
"I tried this the other night at buddy's birthday party and found it palatable and party-worthy but not spectacular. Had I drank it while sitting at my desk with my critical faculties fully attuned to the beer then I might share some of the hyper-critical opinions of my fellow Beer Advocates, but luckily (for myself) I was able to be busy enough to enjoy this beer. It poured a golden orange with a small head head and smelled of sweet malts and citrusy hops. The taste was not as aggessively hopped as I would have expected from an IPA, but it made for some easy-drinking without feeling the need to pair it with party snacks. There are definitely more exciting IPAs out there but this one can be enjoyed by just about any macro-brew drinker willing to give a microbrew a chance."
"Drinkability: A mediocre beer. True tot he style, but nothing outstanding. Too many other fine beers out there to revisit this one."
"Overall it's very drinkable and carbonated, just not in a very distinct IPA style."
"(rated Jan 1, 2008)"
"Pours a clear amber color. 1/4 -1/2 inch head with slight retention and decent lacing. Smells of hops and a stronger sweet malt aroma. Not really an IPA, too much malt and too little hops. Tastes mostly of a sweet malt with a hop background. More sweet than bitter, but smooth with little carbonation. Overall, it's easy to drink but definitely not an IPA."
"This poured a slightly hazy copper with a bit of tan head. It smelled like orange and grapefruit hops, caramel malt, and a bit of brown sugar. It tasted like sweet caramel and honey malt, and sweet orange and bitter grapefruit hops. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was much tastier than I expected, although not in a traditional IPA sense. It had a very nice, sweet flavor and pretty good body, and it was clean and easy to drink. This was surprisingly enjoyable, and definitely makes me want to check out other beers from Federal Jack's."
"First off, this beer looks REALLY nice. Nice color, solid head, and good retention. However, things go downhill really quickly. I took a sniff of this and said ""This is not an IPA."" There is no really hop presence on the nose - very much an amber or red. The taste follows with no assertiveness. Lots of sweetness, but very little bitterness. In fact, as it warms, it gets even sweeter - weird. Not sure what was going on with this beer - maybe it's mislabeled? Not recommended."
"The taste is light caramelly, bready maltiness, very juicy, with a light citrusy-leafy bitterness with hints of pine and grapefruit, apple, and orange marmalade. It's on the sweet side for an IPA, starting quite sweet, but the hops do just take over by the finish, with a lightly hop-dominated, lightly bitter finish, but still riding a somewhat thick sweetness. It's got a solid body, and is pretty balanced, making it tasty and drinkable, and voerall a good, solid beer. This clearly isn't a West coast-style IPA, but that's fine and I wasn't expecting one, nor do I want all IPAs to be like that anyway."
"Picked it up at Trader Joes Arroyo Grande and wish I would have kept my money. By far one of the WORST IPA's I have ever had. Poured from the bottle with good carbonation, settled with a dirty white head and gold in color. Smell was terrible. I could not smell any hops. It smelled like pure barley and water. No hops to mention, no backbone and no IPA."
" ~ This brew is interesting and consistent but not one I'll be seeking out in the future."
"I picked this up at Trader Joe's for $5.99 a six. I have never heard of or seen this beer before. This is the worst beer I have ever had. Taste is very very sweet with a strong soap flavor that lingers. This does not have that bitter hop taste of a I.P.A. This was husky soap sweet. Not true to style. I could not finish one 12 oz bottle. I asked the check out girl if she had tried it she said no but I could return it for a refund if didn't like it. I found my receipt in the trash and will get my money back tomorrow. What kills me is I have five beers that I cant drink and it's too late to go out. Should have picked up the stone I.P.A.. Hind sight is 20/20 and this beer is garbage. AVOID!"
"Drinkability: One of the weakest IPAs I've ever tasted, but again, it's nothing I can't drink. That said, it's not something you want to seek out. If you're at TJs, grab a bottle at your own risk and try it if you want, but there are better beers."
"This is not a beer that I would ever come back to."
"D- Ick. I really liked the color(despite head issues) and smell, but something seems to have gotten lost in the taste."
"Meh, I'll probably not pick it up again, but if I do, its not a total loss."
"D,notes: This beer is kind of a wreck. Does not really taste like an IPA. I can drink it but it wasn't easy getting through a six pack."
"OK, looking at this beer's score, I was expecting far, far worse. This is (IMHO) better than a decent beer. I like this and would be willing to buy a six-pack and share with my beer-geek friends. It is not at the pinnacle of IPA's (like Stone or Liberty), but it more than holds its own. What might I be missing?"
"my mom got me a 6 pack of beer from trader joes knowing that i like different beers. this is about the least IPA i think i've had, it isn't a bad beer, just isn't an IPA. has a decent color to it, a dark golden brown color with a average sized head. smell is weak, some weak hop scents but thats about it. the taste isn't bad, it is like a weak pale ale though, not an IPA for any sense of the style."
"D- I wouldn't recommend or purchase this beer again its seems a poor example of an IPA"
"No thanks."
"It's not a horrible beer, but I won't be buying again."
"Poured a medium, clear copper with a light white head that dissipated pretty quickly. It was pretty bubbly and smelled of both hops and strong malt and tasted just that--quite hoppy without masking a great maltiness as well. It feels medium bodied and delightfully bitter in the mouth. This IPA goes down pretty smooth with a slightly bitter and hoppy malt aftertaste which I found pretty enjoyable. Not bad at all for a $1 bottle of IPA!"
"Light copper pour with a white head that leaves pretty quickly. Then the aroma gives a nice floral, woody character from the hops, but a little muted. Taste is an average, balanced, session IPA (kind of a oxymoron). Malty, with a touch of hops, but very clean. Mouthfeel is also very average, but this is a very drinkable brew."
"For a few dollars more I could pick up many, any brews that are an order of magnitude better. I gave them a shot, but twas not to be."
"Before drinking this I read some other reviews and was expecting something really bad, but I must say...it's not a bad beer and I'm looking forward to the rest of the six pack."
"Smell is very weak, very light hops. Taste is hops, but not much else -also not real balanced, Too bitter, a bit unpleasantly sour, and hops are just not right. Carbonation seems heavier than it should. Almost a slight metallic aftertaste - and there is an aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel was fine. Not too drinkable due to the poor flavor, though. Finish was perhaps the best part, as the flavors faded to a decent, clean bitterness. I would not recommend this beer."
"Drinkability - a little bent to the harsh, bitter side. The flavor is decent but not one I'd pass around."
"Pours a nice copper, and offers a nice hoppiness. Would like a little more flavor and crispness - it's a little filmy at the finish - but overall a nice beer. I've also had this on tap at Federal Jack's, where it was a fine offering."
"unlike everyone else,I really liked this beer. It is really kind of on the weak side for an ipa, but it was tasty going down.If you can look past that fact that it is not a true IPA, you will like it. Nice color, body and head rentention. Really drinkable, and cheap! 5.99 a six pack at Trader Joes."
"A fairly good looking beer, deep amber with a two fingers of white head on top. Crystal clear. Nose is pretty weak, apples and a little hops. Taste is fairly similar; pretty good balance of hops and malt, although that apple-y malt flavor rears its head a little too much. Overall, this beer is just kind of insipid; thin and pretty weak, with some odd off-flavors that are decidedly un-IPAish. Overall, it's not terrible (at least this one's actually an IPA, unlike the Alexander Keith's), just not one I'd go out of my way for."
"D: As I finished this bottle my opinion of the beer continued to deteriorate as the clash of sweet and bitter became irritating and less pleasant. I also started to feel like it was leaving my mouth too dry. It was worth trying, but yea, won't be picking this up again."
"Average mouthfeel and almost average drinkability. Unbalanced and missing something. Not my cup o' tea."
"I should reiterate -- it's not a bad beer at all. Actually quite enjoyable. I'm only giving this one a relatively low score because I'm scoring according to its fidelity to style as well. And the smell and taste are nothing like an IPA -- even an English one."
"Can get a bit too fizzy, but nice medium texture overall. Drinkable."
"Notes: Please don't serve this to someone dabbling in the craft beer world. It was decent for a bottle but far from desireable in the future."
"Again, it's more like an English-style IPA. Not bad, but I miss the hops."
