"Poured a brown color with a strong sweet oak mildly hoppy aroma.  Taste was big sweetness, with a touch of bitterness."

"I see the bottle pictures says ""Oaked India Pale Ale", but my bottle just says ""Oaked Ale"" so maybe they aren't marketing this as an IPA anymore. In any case, pleasant beer that I would recommend for fall or winter. Unfortunately I live in Florida so it's hot out."

"Pours a beautiful, clear brown with a head that has some nice retention. Love the aroma on this one. Oaky/nutty/toasty/malty with just enough hop character coming through. Drinks super smooth with plenty of nuttiness and a nice smoky quality too. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation, bringing the flavors together wonderfully. I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Would readily drink it over and over again."
"Nothing in the taste or aroma hints at this being an IPA of any sort, but this was a wonderful surprise and probably the best barrel aged IPAs I've ever had."

"The beer is amber with a thick, tan head. Aromas of bready malts, oak, alcohol, vanilla. The flavor is more akin to a light barleywine than an IPA. Little hop presence, with some chocolate notes and brown ale character. An interesting beer, but I have yet to find an oak aged IPA that I have truly enjoyed."

"O/D-One of the biggest sleepers from EBF. Every beer Toppling Goliath brought I needed to try but this one was a bit of an afterthought. I am glad I tried it because I ended up loving it. An old timey English IPA with loads of oakiness. I normally don't like oaky IPAs but this one is so naturally balanced that I didn't have to deal with the awkward clash of hops and oak."

"This is the one... my favorite of the evening. Dark amber colored with some haze. Wood, tobacco, burnt sugar, caramel and molasses. Bitterness is from hops but tastes like char although there are no tannins upfront. This is an extremely complex beer and the beauty of it is that nothing obliterates it... very very good. Filled a growler at the taproom and enjoyed it again. Highly recommended."

"Overall, at first I didn't like this beer, but after a few ounces it grew on me a lot and I started to appreciate it for what it is. It is oak aged so it isn't going to be a massive hop bomb. This beer is very complex and really easy to drink. I dig this one. A lot!"

"Interesting beer. Served at a good temperature with a nice sized foamy, creamy, thick, cream colored head with tan highlights that slowly settled and lots of lace. Color is a cloudy amber brown. Aroma is hop, malt, caramel, toffee, woodsy. Flavor's much like nose, but with lots more going on - plenty of sweetness to stand up to the hop bitter, slight carbonic tang, biscuits, bread, yeast, crackers. Body is good but carbonation is kind of soft. Finish is like flavor, with bitters lasting a while and offset by the oak malt. Drinkable beer."
"Overall- Get ready for a sweet and oaky beer drinking experience with Naughty 90. It has very little in the way of faults. Just don't go into it expecting your average IPA. This beer is good, and I will die of happiness the day this TG offering is bottled."

"D/O: While this beer may check all of the necessary boxes to be called an IPA, it does not deliver a predictable IPA experience. While wood is evident in the nose as well as on the palate, it is unclear how much it plays into the odd synergy of this beer. It drinks more like a stout plagued by acidity issues more than an actual IPA. The drinker may be given pause to reflect on most other wood-aged IPAs, which are obviously dry-hopped after aging--which does not seem to be the case for this beer."
"A very strange beer, it seems mislabeled as Oak aged IPA, taste like something completely different, but kind of interesting at leas."

"O: It's an exceptional beer in my book. Was I expecting more hops for an IPA, yes. Was I let done by how it comes off in general, by no means. Toppling Goliath has created a beer that I will recommend for anyone seeking a well crafted unique IPA. I will be seeking this out again myself. Job well done."
"This is the sort of imaginative, innovative flavor combination that can only be pulled off by brewers who know what they're doing. It's wonderful, and I can't wait to try more from TG."

"Notes: On-tap at Sanctuary. Oak aged IPA This is a very interesting beer with a very intriguing malt body for an IPA. It's not overly hoppy, but it is very complex and deep. Great showing of oak but also the malt and hops. It all just works together and combines into a tasty, interesting beer. Near perfect implementation of barrel flavors. The intention of this was to provide an experience of drinking an ocean bound IPA in oak barrels with a bit more of a malt backbone. I enjoyed this change of pace from a strong, hop forward IPA."
