The aroma is distinctly floral with fruity accents and the taste is well balanced, hoppy, but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel is solid with a good bitter aftertaste, again not overpowering.  Overall this is a solid IPA.","Doctor_Bogenbroom","Mar 08, 2015"

There seems to be almost no carbonation going on inside the glass, I had to look really hard to find a small handful of tiny bubbles. Aroma is surprisingly faint with almost no hop presence...I get mostly the aroma of toasted malt. 1st sip brings a sharp note of spicy, piney hops, but it's not the overwhelming in-your-face hoppiness that comes with most American IPAs. Mouthfeel is right down the middle, neither watery of heavy.

There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is herbal and citrusy (orange, lemon peel) hops, and some bready malt. The brew tastes like herbal and citrusy (grapefruit, oranges) hops, and some bready and caramel malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy but also has a little too much carbonation for me. I still think it's a decent enough brew overall, it's certainly worth trying. I'd like to have this one again in the future.","bluejacket74","Jun 29, 2012"

4,9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Watching Kevin Millwood fail this consistently makes me wonder why he's still considered an ace... Anyway, this beer pours a clear amber-copper topped by a thick, healthy, off-white froth. The nose comprises sweet, sweet toffee (with what seems like a cinnamon vein), orange peel, and hoppy florals. The taste brings those hops forward, adding in a decent amount of piney grapefruit to the already plentiful greenery, though the toffee stays strong, even having the last word in the form of an interesting stab of sweetness at the end. The body is a slight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a surprisingly good, relatively malty IPA.","TMoney2591","Jul 05, 2010"
4,9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"This Beer is a great example of a tasty I.P.A. that can be a session beer thanks to the ABV of 5% and the clean drinkability. A lot of earthy spice notes dancing with the sweet malt.

This seems to come a simpler time when things were a bit slower in the word and likewise, this is not a chugging beer. I'll admit, I like more pizazz in my Pale Ales but this was a welcome change of pace and didn't have so much of the "burn" associated with its American counterparts.

4.39,19.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability/Notes> I 1st had this beer at the Old Dominion BeerFest a couple of years ago. I thought it was a standout then. Now I wonder why it took me so long to give this a go again. What a drinkable IPA, again, its not your typical American IPA. A truly English style IPA brewed with all Fuggles, which I like a lot. Really nice and bitter with a pepper like spiciness that is balanced by a malt bill that gives it a subtle light caramel like sweetness. The yeast kicks out some fruity like esters as well. At 5% abv this could almost be considered a true session beer in the English sense of things. Definitely seek this one out if you are looking for something different from your American IPA's, you won't be dissappointed, however, if you think you bought an American IPA and are not used to the English style of IPA then I could see why this beer doesn't get rated as high as I think it should. Highly recommended and extremely drinkable. Seek and Enjoy !!","SwillBilly","Feb 17, 2007"

Earthy, floral hops with some toffee, bready malts, and a bit of dark fruits (figs, maybe?) make up the aroma. The taste is fairly bitter with some earthiness to it. Fruits come out more in the taste with the malts and floral hops. Almost seems like they mixed an English IPA with an English barleywine. Not bad by any means, but different. Creamy, slick medium body with a dry finish. I must admit that it seems to be growing on me more as it warms up a little.","Imstillthegman","Aug 02, 2006"

Flavor is more along the lines of an IPA...good bitterness supported by a firm malt base that lends sweetness. Middle shows a little more sweetness and tails off with a fruity bitterness that dries out the palate. A tad on the harsh side. I was surprised at the level of harshness given the cask-conditioning.

The head retention is quite good and it holds well before dropping to a short lid; and even then leaves some very nice lacing throughout the glass. The nose displays a doughy, caramelish malt that's accented by some mineral/metallic and leafy hops (Fuggles?). It's medium/full bodied and creamy-smooth across the palate with a very fine, median carbonation that leaves just a tingle on the tongue at the outset. The flavor is rich with an exceptionally well-balanced combination of honey-laced, slightly caramelish, and biscuity malt that's streaked with leafy, lightly mineralish, and softly grassy hop flavors (that become most apparent in the drying finish) backed by a solid bitterness. Well-balanced and highly drinkable. A brilliant re-creation of an English-style IPA! Enjoy this one at cellar temperature for it's fullest character.","NeroFiddled","Nov 27, 2003"

3.9,6.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This beer is brewed in Hampton VA and has a rather high-falutin' bottle label featuring a shield and fancy scripted lettering. I won't hold that against the beer, however. The beer weighs in at 5% alcohol, which I thought was a tad low for an IPA, but I also won't let that bias me either. The beer pours nicely with a fairly quickly dissipating head, but has a beautiful orange-golden color with a touch of red or amber. The aroma was mostly malt, a sort of soft slightly bready note that makes you look forward to tasting the beer. And, when you taste it, indeed maltiness pours out of the glass. The flavor is definitely more balanced toward malt than hops, which isn't quite what I expect from an IPA. Although I'm not a stickler for "beer styles", particularly for microbrews, you sort of get a pre-conceived notion for a beer based on what the brewer calls it, and you could be disappointed if it misses the mark much. I'm not sure what I'd call this one, stylistically, but no matter. The malt character itself is so delicious that I'll forgive the stylistic issues. IN fact, I'm glad it isn't more hoppy, because the sweetness not only dominates the bitterness, its so pronounced that if the beer WAS more bitter I think it would have a cough syrup note that many IPAs have (sweet and hoppy bitter don't always work well together). The beer is rather clean in its profile, almost reminescint of a lager, maybe like a slightly over-bitter bock beer? I should mention - I reviewed this beer as part of a session that included Anchor Liberty Ale and New River Pale Ale.","KroMagnon","Aug 01, 2003"
3.88,6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Appears copper amber with a yellow haze over it head is full with a tawny cream hued head with scattered webbed lacing in my pint. Aroma smells like a fresh baked cookie with nuts a ton of malt biscuit possibly and hops shining through my that is an astonishing smell in the form of beer. Taste is initially a malty sweet bitter with pine cone doughy monster, somehow these flavors meld together and boy am I glad they do. English style IPA all the way mouthfeel is silky yet oily at the same time body is meidum and mouthfeel feels robust and full very nice. Drinkability is excellent in my opinion what a great switch up of an IPA considering I am used to Stone, Victory, and DFH. Full flavors and robust mouthfeel make me realize that I would probably stop at a few of these but would yearn for more, just a great brew.","WVbeergeek","Jul 30, 2003"

A certain mineral, "rocky" dryness lands squarely on the tongue. Hop bitterness dominates the aftertaste, though the malty sweetness develops as the beer warms. I agree with my fellow BA Murph that there is a certain "coating" that develops on the teeth, a chalky dryness that is probably not a good thing.

The hop bitterness is the first taste that you get but this is soon followed up by some creamy maltiness before the hops come back out to finish the beer off.  The whole time there is a nice bitter hoppiness in the background which leaves a nice lingering hoppy finish.  Creamy and refreshing, this brew loses a little bit on the mouthfeel scale for having a slightly coating effect that should not be there.  The tongue coating takes away from the drinkability just a little as well but this is still an very good all around brew.","Murph","Jul 18, 2002"
