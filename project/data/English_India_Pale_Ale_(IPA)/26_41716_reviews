"Bomber poured into plastic cup. Hazy orange with a finger of white head that settles to a cap. Great lacing. Aroma is citrus (mostly orange), leafy hops, bread, and caramel maltiness. Taste starts with caramel sweetness then is cut by grassy/leafy hop bitterness before mellowing to a citrus hop bitter finish. Medium bodied, slick and creamy, moderate carbonation."

"Cloudy orange Amber, fluffed white foam. Candied mango and pineapple is strong with this one. Boozy and malt-forward. Really solid"

"Big toasty, Oak taste real nice balance and very enjoyable.  Very unique and fresh. Bitter, yet woody. Just a touch of smoke on the palette. Worth seeking out~"

"The feel is fantastic; a firm medium body shows a few layers of depth, crispness is strong yet evens out a running smoothness that never fades. It starts off on the semi-sweet side and transitions easily toward dryness as it works such that you don't notice the transition. It remains very clean all the way through the finish, which lingers just as long as it should."

"Borderline English Barelywine with high bitterness and moderate complexity, just not enough to push it to the upper echelon of IPA or maltier styles."

"taste is funky too! bitter hops up front to accompany the funky smell. then some biscuit-y malt and lots of malt sweetness... funky pale bitterness... british? maybe. a little different? for sure. would I buy again? no. but is it worth a try? definitely!"

"A solid offering, but really not worth the $13 price tag, as far as I'm concerned. This does not hold up well and I can't really see where the oak plays a part in adding on to the beer, to be honest. I realize that it's a ""historical"" experiment but these guys already make great enough beers to convince us that a lot of their experiments are as unique as they perhaps truly are. (However, I ALWAYS welcome experimentation in brewing.) Nevertheless, I would gladly revisit this in a fresher condition - it's comforting to drink and has a unique malt profile that shines above the hops. Worth trying if you want a FFF fix for something new."

"Thick off white single finger head with nice lacing on a hazy golden copper body. Aroma is malt heavy with breads, tart citrus, candied orange and pine resin. The flavor is basically the same and follows very well with the exact same experience. Although good I don't really understand what makes this one English. It may use English hops but it basically came out as a malt forward AIPA from my experience. Medium to full body and moderate carbonation."

"Not my favorite Three Floyds brew. I love big hoppy beers, but I think the hops in this one are overdone because of the types of hops used. Here the English hops come off harsh and too bitter in muddy sort of way, and the malt tastes a bit too thick and chewy as well. The malt and hops don't balance each other but compound the assault on the palate with no contrast in sight. Oh well, not to my taste."

"Overall, this is quite bitter for an English IPA in my opinion. Not that that's a bad thing..."

"Not bad, but nothing impressive. The aromas and flavors are forgettable, in my opinion. Three Floyds nailed the appearance and mouthfeel, as usual. It's clear that the craftsmanship is there, but it just doesn't pop like most of their beers."
""
""
""
"O: Different than the American IPAs that i'm used to but great none the less. A very floral earthy beer that is quite refreshing. This beer gets better every time i drink it so you better know i'm going to revisit it soon! /90"

"Three Floyds Blackheart ---4/5."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty bitter beer here. I really enjoy the Blackheart. It is kind of one of the bastards from Floyd's. There is not a huge demand for it. I don't know why? I think it is a amazing beer. Great hop notes on the nose and a strong hopped taste as I mentioned the bitter. I wouldn't pass this one up as it is very consistent every year as well."

""
""

"O: Enjoyable 3 Floyd's take on a classic. I thought the hops would be the big feature but I was surprised by the maltiness. This is a great beer to cap off a hard week. The warming effect is pleasant and helps make each sip of the brew more enjoyable."

"O. Unique and enjoyable take on an uncommon IPA style. For the money though I prefer FFF's standard DIPA offerings to this."
"Not one of the beers that make 3F legendary though."
"Overall - Not only is this a unique brew, it's also really amazing! So many levels working in beautiful harmony together. Fitting I reviewed this on July 1st, because there is something that's very 'Christmas in July' about this beer. Wish I'd have traded for more of these! Everything I've imagined in an oak-aged beer. Can we have more of these please, and less 'boozy/bourbon' oak aged brews?"
""
""
""
""

"Overall - Excellent beer. The subtle oak taste was perfect and really made this beer stand out. Looking forward to having more."

"Poured from 22oz bomber into snifter with a nice hazy golden color and an inch head that dissipated and left a nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is a bit weaker than I was expecting, getting a faint citrus smell and a hint of wood. Taste is a bit floral and lot citrus, defintely getting some oak, and balanced well between the malt and hops,. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky but dry, medium carbonation. Finish is definitely dry and bitter. Great offering from FFF. I’m liking this because the hops are definitely coming through but not too overpowering."
""
""
""
""
"Trade from BrewMane. Thanks! Pours cloudy orange with a small white head. Not much aroma, maybe slight sweet citrus, toffee, soap(?). Flavor is BIG up front bitter with a sweet malty finish. Lingering honey pine taste on the palate. Alcohol warmth going down. Big slick mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation. Unique brew here, better than the rating that is lower than it should be thanks to the aroma (there just isn’t any). Worth a try. Yikes. As this warms up it the alcohol really comes out. Like vodka or rubbing alcohol flavor. That is unfortunate. Be sure to keep it cold and it is a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Tasty, refreshing brew. The aroma and flavor keep you guessing and this beer is very drinkable on a warm summer day (like it is today). Three Floyds certainly knows what they are doing with their IPAs."
""
"Overall-I was expecting this to be a little tones down compared to the west coast stuff, but its really a totally different animal. This is a solid offering from Three Floyd's, but for the price I don't know if I would pick it up again. 10 bucks for this bomber is a bit of a stretch. I am glad I got to try it and if you have the chance I recommend you do to. 3.75"
"Mouthfeel is good. Lots of carbonation is balanced with lots of oil from the hops. Gives it a nice body but keeps it drinkable through all the bitterness"
""
"O: 4.0 This is one that I'm very glad I had, but I won't be seeking out again. I'm always amazed at just how clear 3F gets their brews, and this is no exception. This is a very good beer, nicely balanced in flavor."

"Overall, this is a fine departure from the IPAs of late - I really appreciate the atypical hops in a US-brewed IPA. Would definitely enjoy this one again."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy golden amber capped by a two finger bright white fluffy head. Abundant grassy English hops, hints of caramel, and toasted oak on the nose. Herbal, some floral accents, and light caramel malt. Finishes with a bit of apple peel, warm, toasty oak that combines with herbal hop bitterness and underlying hints of alcohol. Moderately carbonated medium body, that is smooth and creamy with hints of soapiness on the edges. I'm fairly surprised that I've never reviewed Blackheart, as it is among my favorites from Three Floyds. Certainly more bitter than your standard English IPA, this brew is fairly well balanced overall and the oak-aging is a plus."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Brew poured a semi transparent brown orange with visible carbonation. the head was frothy and left chinck lacing. Smell ifs fairly hoppy for an English ipa, but this is fff. Smells great, citrus tropical fruit. The taste is a big toasted malt with a slap of hops. Nice and quite unique. Has a zesty almost peppery spicing in my mouth from the toasted bitter after vibe. Easy drinker. Worth checking out."

"Clear orange body, with a thick white head. Light retention but solid lacing. Citrus is front and center in the nose with a sweet, bready malt. Light grassiness and some English yeast. Lots of tropical fruits in terms of flavour, some English bready malt character. Drying and quite bitter as the hops fade away. Medium full feel, great, juicy hopping with a medium low carbonation. Although some EIPA character comes through, this is substantially ""American"" in almost every aspect. Really good stuff."

"good, but very caramel sweet malt heavy, so cloying at times. however still decent."
""
""
"Well done IPA in the english style. Yet to have a bad beer from 3F."
"M - Medium body. Thick and chew with lots of resinous hop oils. Light to moderate carbonation."
""
"O - boy oh boy, what a treat. Not your normal ipa loaded with hops and bitterness. But a thick in the mouth gem with a ton of flavor. Its a delicious masterpiece and offers the ipa fan a change in direction in a world class manner. It's a fantastic English style ipa Using wonderful English yeast, hops and malt. Flavors are a bit different, but the uses of malt along with mellow hops are on the same base and just plain splendid. Blackheart continues a big line of awesome beers the guys at Three Floyds have to offer. Nothing but world class here. This is a straight up flavor filled enjoyment of an ale. I'll buy this every year. A must try. As are all FFF brews."
""
"a beautiful looking bottle label. poured a clean amber with a perfect 2 fingers of off white heat. great retention, greater lacing. smells of cascade hops.. more of a west coast smell than an english ipa. getting a hint of sweet caramel underneath the pine smell. tastes malty sweet and slightly bready up front. then you get a bitter blast of hops towards the finish giving you a piney/citrusy grapefruit taste. medium body with a nice creamy feel, moderate carbonation and a nice warmth from the alcohol content. this is a solid ipa, regardless of not really sticking to the tradition english ipa. i think they should consider making this one year round.. stands up strongly next to arctic panzer wolf."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a refreshing and delicious beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A nice change of pace from FFF. I'd have it again."
"Overall: A big departure for Three Floyds, but they pull it off. An aggressive take on an English style. The hop profile gets a little muddled. Toasted oak was an interesting touch that ended up hurting the beer a bit in the long run."
""
"I think the best part is that it goes down like water. I want planning on chugging it, but it went down so smooth with such a nice sweet smooth body that I didnt realize I was ready for another beer."
""
""
"This beer poured out as a clear looking copper color. The head was a light cream color with a light lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer has a good balance of grainy sweet malts along with the dry hop aromas too. The taste of the beer has a good amount of English malt flavors with a sharp hoppy finish to it. The mouthfeel of the beer is pretty typical, drinkable, medium bodied with a dry finish. Overall this beer was really nice in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Overall, it's an easy drinker. Not any one things asserts itself, everything works well with everything else making it a pretty smooth beer for and IPA so high in ABV and so highly hopped."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Tasty and plenty of flavor. A killer job on a english ipa. The malts work well to create a balanced and flavorful beer. The alcohol is also nice as it mixes with the spices to create a intense flavor at the finish. Another great beer from 3 floyds, a must try."
""

"22oz. bottle courtesy of CruisaC. Served in my SA Perfect Pint at 49 degrees. Pours a dull orange hue with a frothy, half inch bright white head. Clarity is nearly translucent; however, there is also a slight haze. Head eventually settles into a solid 1/8th inch cap - thin, textured strands of lacing are revealed during the tasting and exhibit excellent adhesion. Nose expresses light, toasted malts, citrus and a trace of breadiness at the back. Taste is really interesting, toasted oak and caramel hit the tongue at first, followed by citrus, ethanol and an earthy/piny hops bitterness that lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a slightly prickly carbonation and some acidity. Overall, I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this beer as I tend to not really go for English IPAs. The flavor profile is really quite multi-faceted and interesting. I'd like to see this beer with a little age on it as well to see how it develops."

""

"I've never really been unhappy with any FFF beer. This one is great, the sweetness reminds me very much of a DFH IPA, which isn't a bad thing. A nice beer overall."

""
""
""
"Cheers!"
"O - Wow, I'm going to be sad to see this one go. So, so good. Well done, boys. Get it while you can."
""
""
"O - A nice hopped-up version of your normal English IPA. I would just rather drink Zombie Dust or Dreadnaught for my hops kick when I'm at FFF, but this is a nice change-of-pace beer with a hoppy & malty balance."
""
""
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Honestly, this is my least favorite Three Floyds offering that I've had. There is a heavy alcohol taste that seems quite unbalanced. The malt is rich and heavy. A bit of a roasted taste in the finish. A bit of a letdown."

"I could see the top brass saving this for themselves while the grunts drink the watered down version, Imperial IPA to say the least. I could drink this again without issues but for now I need to thank liamt07 again for shipping me the bottle"

"Clouded deep honey golden orange hue, thick viscous head light off white color holds together very nicely. Great retention has it settles fine speckled patterns of lace cling to my Tripel Karmeliet glass. Aroma has citric and floral hop notes with a sweet lightly toasted malt base, and a touch of white oak notes with minimal oak on the nose. The barrel aging is so integrated in this beer, I usually hate oak aged DIPAs this is not the case here. Flavors from the oak give a nice earthy dry bitterness that lasts throughout each sip, earthy, grassy, citric hops blend so nicely with alcohol and sweet malts that bring out a honey toasted bread flavor that really keeps you wanting another sip. More toasted oak soft vanilla, juicy raisins, with warming alcohol in the finish. Medium to fuller bodied ale, brings out layers of flavor as it warms up a bit. Pretty clean hop oils flowing through not as sticky as some of these beers that have come out recently, I'm used to resinous hops. Overall damn good DIPA, English hops and malts collide with some oak aging that does the beer much justice, another great beer from Three Floyd's, no kidding?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I strongly prefer American IPAs to English IPAs (sorry mother country), and therefore I have to say this is FAR from the best IPA FFF produces. Technically, it's probably one of their worst, but that's like saying the guy who finishes last in the U.S. Open (or the British Open) is among the ``worst best'' golfers on the planet. If you are a fan of English bitters or IPAs, you should give this a try. I'll probably try it again next year."
""
""
"Overall: 3Floyds have yet to disappoint me. One of the foremost leaders in heavily hopped delicasies. I would recommend this to any beer drinker."
"O: Decent IPA, but nothing really sets it apart from the other high ABV IPA's out there..."
"O- This has a lot of English IPA character, but the finish is very citrusy and tropical fruit like. There are a lot of great hop flavors and malt flavors in this beer, but the beer does not quite blend together all that great. At 8.50 ABV the alcohol presence is stronger than I expected. Overall, this is an enjoyable beer to seek out, but it tastes like it has a little bit of an identity crisis."
""
""
""
"A hoppier version of most english IPAs that I'm used to, but that's expected from three floyds. This is classic 3f and is damn delicious."
""
"Overall, a very hop forward brew with an interesting underpinning of toasted oak. Not aggressively bitter like an American ipa, but very citrusy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at the pub, served in a half pint glass. Color is orange amber with a head that settles nicely. Decent lacing. Aroma is bread, pine, and toffee. Flavor is toffee, biscuit, apricot, and grapefruit. Medium mouthfeel. Very well executed. Nice representation of the style."
"O- A pretty nice English IPA, as usual for FFF this is a wonderful beer, but a bit pricey at $12."
"O- This is a pretty awesome IPA, unique and of course, strange. I prefer Arctic Panzer Wolf over their other IPA's but I like this one and all their others. Will be buying this one again next year."
""
"O: Finishing this brewfest strong; I’m definitely fond of Blackheart. More English IPAs, please; this stuff is delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium yellow-amber color with very little head. Aroma is very nice, somewhat light, but still good levels of floral hops, some mild spice/perfume, and some light roasted malts. Very subdued. Flavor is very nice for someone like myself who does not love the hop bomb as much as the average person. Good floral and piney hop flavors are well balanced by toasty and sweet malt flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very hazy golden-orange color with a small white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is very inviting...has some lovely oak aromas to it...kinda reminds me of Burton Baton with much less hoppiness. English malt and hop aromas with more oak and some toffee. Taste is...wow...very interesting. Immediately I get lovely oak flavors with some strange fruit snack flavors. Not too much hoppiness, as I'm pretty sure this is an older bottle. I'm really loving the oak flavors of this beer. Great citrus as well...orange and mango. A nice caramel malt backbone to this with some lovely butterscotch and toffee. There is some hoppiness...but very minimal compared to the other great flavors. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation that seems proper for this beer. Drinkability is pretty damn high. Overall, I was warned by people that this beer is not in season and better fresh, but I'm really liking it."

"D/O: Well-crafted but unremarkable, this beer shows ale qualities that, while certainly not West Coast, are still more American than English. It is most in need of a more aggressive English yeast character that could lend some estery complexity."
""
""

"This is just a mess of a beer, lacking in all subtleties and balance."

"It poured clear with a good inch of thick head. The coloring is a darker amber than most IPAs. The smell wasn't quite as strong as I had hoped - hops and sugar were present. The taste, however, was in full force - so many flavors that complimented each other like a great meal. There was a complex breadiness layered with brown sugar like a sweet bread. Add to that a solid level of hops and floral citrus aroma that filled my sinuses but didn't overwhelm. There were definite levels of flavors that worked together but didn't cancel each other out. It had obvious English characteristics that were simply accentuated rather than covered up by the more American style of being hop-forward. Throughout, it was very smooth and drinkable. The high ABV sneaks up on you. Overall, it was both the most flavorful and smoothest English IPA I have ever tried - and all at 9% - hard to top. Great job again, 3F!"
"Not my favorite FFF IPA, but I still cherish every drop. Very nice."
"Overall this is on the above average end of bitterness but really tasty. There is a ton of flavors floating around in this that make it a definite worthy try for anyone who can get it. A great example of FFF IPAs."
"Another beer from FFF, and yet another one I can't wait to try again. Does that place ever make a bad brew? I can't seem to find one, another stellar effort. Cheers!"
"a solid IPA here, id say its more american than english, but it works for what it is, almost barleywine like. similar to other 3floyds big IPAs ive had. worth a try, but i prolly wouldnt go after it again."
"I saw a man buy old foghorn for 25+ today for a 6er. I really wanted to ask how he could justify that for a 6er of ok beer. The thing is this beer is 39 for a 6er equivalent and well I can’t even begin to accept that for this really really good beer."
"O - Quite delicious. Continuously bitter through the whole beer."
"O: Another solid IPA from FFFs. I don't think I have had a bad one. This was in the fridge for a couple of month too, but held up to the length. Keep it up Floyds!"
"A pale golden amber with billowy white head and great lacing. A little citrus in the nose with a hint of crackery malt. The malt forward beer is countered with minty, herbal hops with a nice balmy lingering bitterness. This is a great beer, that really hides the 9% ABV very well."
"Overall: This was underwhelming."
"Not as bright of a body as their other big IPAs, appropriate for the English style. Big frothy and lacy white head that pools on the surface of the body with its bigness. Body is darker than their other DIPAs, also appropriate for the English style. Aroma has a lot of hops, but still a bit subdued. Hard to decide if it's right on for the style of if it's a little on the subdued side even. Well balanced aroma. Probably less hoppy in the nose than Alpha King (which is pretty dang hoppy), without that typical 3F's hop zing, but you can tell there were massive hops in the boil to balance the huge malt. Some complexity on the tongue, for sure. Mouthfeel is great, and overall I'd recommend trying this beer for a very big example of the style that hides the alcohol well, although for my part I'd rather be drinking a Dreadnaught or Artic Panzer Wolf right now for the price."
"Sweet malt, caramel and oak dominate. The hops hang around the whole time, but if they weren't bitter they wouldn't stand out. Earthy and piney. But they fade with a push from the caramel and a pull from the oak. I imagine this represents the long journey from UK to India. But you won't find this in India, that's for darn sure."
"Overall not bad, nice hops but not quite english, lots of nice malts and sweet sugars to balance the various hops, sweetness, and light booze, tasty and drinkable though."
"Overall- This has got to be my least favorite from FFF seasonal lineup. They make much better IPAs, and I am not particularly fond of most English IPAs, and for whatever reason wood and IPAs dont really mesh for me."
"O - Pretty good, but I'd probably stick with Dreadnaught if I had access to both."
"O- Really good beer, a different avenue for FFF, it has a lot of aroma coming off of it but not that typicall, supernatural-danky citrus kick of an FFF IPA or IPA in disguise. I look forward to it every year, though it isn't my favorite in their IPA line up."
"Overall: Three Floyds markets this beer as an English style IPA, but it seems much more American in character. It's very good regardless!"
"I will say, for a name like Blackheart I expected this beer to be a black IPA. Once I got over my disappointment of being wrong about that, this beer is quite the pleasant surprise."
"Slick and oily medium bodied beer finishing dryly. Fairly well balanced beer and easy to drink given its high ABV."
"Overall, I think my experience with ""English"" IPAs was pretty minimal, so this was a very welcome surprise. An incredibly smooth, pleasant IPA. Another winner from FFF."
"Huge frothy cotton head on the pour. Body is a light orange. Could be a little darker. Smell is hugely sweet tropical grapefruit and cotton candy. A twinge of sourness on the end of the nose. In short, it smells awesome! I can't take the glass away from my nose. Taste is very bold sweetness with the cotton candy quality carrying over. And yes there is a good amount of bitterness in the end. Lots of grapefruit and tropical notes as well. Mouthfeel is very smooth, rich and creamy. The beer is a bit hot though. Outstanding beer! Really tastes more like a really good east coast DIPA than an English one. Hop bitterness is much more amplified. Seek this one out. And as always wish I bought more than one."
"O- My favorite English IPA I've had. The oak aging provides some interesting earthiness and sweetness that isn't found in American IPA's. A nice change of pace from the hop heavy Dreadnaught and Arctic Panzer Wolf. Another great IPA from 3 Floyds."
"O- A really nice change of pace from all those super hoppy West Coast IPA's. I'm digging the way the caramel sweetness and the grassy hoppiness are playing Marco Polo together! I'd love to try this fresh sometime."
"O (D) - an interesting beer that is certainly outside the realm of the american IPA, at least a bit. Nice hops, interesting flavor profile. Pretty good."
"O: More on the sweet side in the body and also not as bitter as other IPAs in aroma. The mouthfeel is a little heavier than I was expecting."
"A very interesting beer. Makes me realize that I enjoy the more citrusy flavors of the american IPA's"
"O: This is a pleasure to drink. Very well balanced and it stays interesting. The pressure to finish this growler in one sitting is far from a chore."
"Overall a very nice IPA, a little strong for an English IPA, unless they are aiming for something closer to historic versions rather than modern versions. Worth seeking out."
"Drink- I like the Three Floyds stuff. This was another good offering and a welcome extra. I could drink this one again."
"Atmosphere is good. Nice enough body, with a persistent foamy head, and a fair amount of lacing. Nose has a distinct, difficult to place (at least, for me) combination of sweet and spice components with the hop base. Interesting hop, that is not too biting, but stands out with its earthy character. Sweet and spice presents here, too. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"O: Love this beer, I think the bomber cost me $10 but I'd say that's a deal for what you're getting here. If you see this one don't pass it up!"
"This is by far my favorite 3F's offering. Poured from a bottle into a pub glass. The look of it is not what I expect from an IPA. The lacing is consistent from start to finish. The smell and taste is amazing. From the hop bitterness to the malty sweetness, a very enjoyable beer. The flavor makes it easy to drink. Overall, a fantastic beer. I will continue to keep this beer at the top of my wants list."
"Alright, in a night that I sampled the majority of the three Floyd line up (includining the legendary Dark Lord) this beer was a stand out. The newer label was cool as hell and so was the brew. A nice alburn hue with good lacing. The nose is caramel hops with a smokey oak. I do not want to negate actual English IPA's, but this American EIPA was an industry standard to me. Maybe I'm used to west coast hop brews but either way this is an amazing beer and I look foward to drinking it many more times. Good Day."
"O- A superb IPA. I loved it. The balance in this IPA is definitely the key with not such hop forward in your face notes. Its all about the sweet pleasuring fruits lingering with the hops and meshing well together."
"O: One of my preferred interpretations of an English IPA, even though it's not really all that ""English"". Still a nice beer."
"O: I really like this beer. If you're after something pretty complex, you should give it a try. It's pretty exciting for the taste buds."
"O - A touch muted flavors, but enjoyable."
"This poured a dark copper almost reddish. A nice 1 finger head that eventually faded to a strong ring of bubbles. The smell is good, instant reminder of commodore perry, a sweet malt. The taste is a good sweet bitter at first then hoppy bitter then a sweet wettish finish. There is lots of kick from the carbonation, very alive jumpy feel. The overall, it's a good beer but for the price I'd almost always go with great lakes, if it was cheaper than 12 and some change for a 22oz it would great more attention. I could drink this till bedtime. It's a great beer but pricey in my area I feel."
"Pours a dark dark brown. A nice bit of light brown head, smells hoppy and malty. The is a touch of chocolate on the nose. Sme subtle hops on the nose. Tastes sweet and dry. Lots of chocolate on the tongue. Dry, sweet, very tasty overall. Good solid mouthfeel. Overall very solid. A style I'm not particularly familiar with but very pleased with"
"Wowow! More like a Triple English IPA?! One amazing yummy brew by 3F!"
"Overall, this is another fine Three Floyds DIPA. It's quite a bit different than the others, much sweeter, but still with plenty of hop presence."
" Soft, creamy mouthfeel upfront. Flavors of fresh oranges, ripe pineapple and grapefruit. Toasted bread, hints of toffee and caramel gives it a touch of sweetness. Malts dominate the palate, with toasted oak and butter. Kinda tangy throughout the beer. Flowers and green tea. Has a good hop bitterness, with pine and citrus flavors that lingers in the finish."
"overall - hmmm, English IPA maybe not for me."
"Drinkability - Definitely a unique taste, but it's very smooth w/ all the malt and hoppy goodness."
"Overall: I love this beer. Great to find a IIPA with such balance. I will stock up on a few of these."
"Medium mouthfeel with the expected hop oil texture. Unusual but very nice brew. Highly recommend this one."
"O: I enjoyed this brew for the most part, but some of the flavors fell a little flat."
"Another brewday beer, 'cause it's just not a brewday without sampling others' final products. This one pours a clear golden amber topped by a finger of light cream foam. The nose comprises a heap o' pine, mint, grapefruit rind, and a very light hint of caramel hiding in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, but the pine is nicely muted a bit, and some dark toffee moves in to balance things out much better than the caramel in the nose ever could. The body is a light-ish medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a fairly creamy feel. Overall, a great EIPA. If the pine in the nose weren't so sharp, I'd bet this would be downright outstanding. Still pretty enjoyable, regardless, though."
"D- I could put down a few."
"This beer pours a golden body with a thin coarse white head on the surface. The aromatics have lots of piny hops backed by what appears to smell like a bit of caramel. The first sips confirm what the nose has suspected. This beer has a heaping helping of piny hops, but they are not overwhelmed by the caramel malt base and visa versa. This is how I like IPA, this beer has balance. The hops provide a good strong deal of bitterness that could be offputting to those who dislike the style, but for those who enjoy hops, this is pretty darn tasty. Overall this is one of the best balanced IPAs that I've had the good fortune of putting on my palate."
"This brew's color is clean gold and has a fingers worth of white head. The nose has notes of vanilla, oak, resinous pine and an ample amount of booze. This has a great oak characteristic that opens up to some sweet caramel, honey and vanilla tones. The hops create a strong bitterness that is balanced with tge sweet malty offerings. Great full-bodied mouthfeel that is smooth and ends dry."
"Just had this on tap at FFF today. I was pleasantly surprised. There was a mild oaky taste to it with fruity undertones. I don't drink scotch, but it had the scotch taste without the burn. Bought some extra bombers to take home. Once again, FFF doesn't disappoint."
"AMAZING, GET THIS BEER!"
"D- This is a great brew by FFF. A little too sweet for me but I suppose it needs to be to stand up to that wall of hops. I'd repeat."
"Thanks to hurfer for the bottle. Poured from 22oz bottle into a snifter glass. Pours orange with a thick off-white creamy head with nice lacing throughout. Nose is citrus, caramel, pine, sugared-raisin, resin. Taste is huge malt at first, big caramel and candied-nuts. Quickly cut by big bitter pine resin and lemon peel flavors. Very long bitter finish with just just a hint of malt. Palate is very thick, coating, with good carbonation, but the alcohol is definitely noticeable. Interesting and complex English IPA for the style!"
"Overall, the most original uk IPA that I've had and another bad ass brew from 3 Floyds."
"22 ounce bottle. Pours slightly hazy amber-orange color with a 2 finger off white head with amazing retention that reduces to a lacing cap that leaves fantastic glass lacing. Aromas of grapefruit, pine, floral, caramel, and pineapple. Taste of grapefruit, pine, pineapple, and caramel, with a delayed bitterness of citrus and grapefruit, that lingers for a while after the finish, showing a strong use of hops. Very well balanced flavors, and it definitely reminds me of the Dreadnaught DIPA from them. Medium carbonation and a medium-full body. Absolutely no notice of the alcohol content. Overall, this is outstanding, and I really hope they start to distribute back to Ohio, because everything I have had has been a great experience. Delicious."
"D - I find this to be a less tense version of Dreadnaught; another fantastic beer by FFF; it has the right blend of floral and hop ingredients to not only make it smell great but taste good as well; I definitely recommend this beers to others"
"This is a very flavorful beer, and overall quite enjoyable. The 9% ABV is not that noticeable, but after 2 pints, you'll be aware this is a strong beer."
"Maltier than the aroma led me to believe but still good. Beer is medium in body and leads off with some malt sweetness. It's good but a little unexpected. It kind of tastes like a big DIPA from the east. Beer only has a moderate bitterness to it, drinkability suffers due to the weight of the whole thing. I like it but I think I've had better English IPAs."
"Alcohol is very well hidden for 9 percent. Too sweet even for an english ipa for my tastes."
"(67th)"
"overall - I've only had a few english ipa's, but this might be the best i've had. i really like the style as I'm not a huge hop head. if you like english ipa's, give this one a try. 9% alcohol very well hidden."
"around face edge. Nice darkerish fruity hop aroma, very fresh. Very delightfully sweet smell, perhaps from malt, but extremely well blended. Taste is extremely fruity. More on the peach and apricotty side. Grassy finish. Not super dry. Swish reveals the alcohol. Not very evident in the least. Pretty awesome for style. Much darker color wise and smell wise than the dreadnaught. Absolutely amazing! Some caramel notes in warmth. Very ligh fruity finish in warmth. Hides heaviness well. Recommend!!!"
"Overall, pick some up if you can."
"Somewhat pale, amber color. A brief haze quickly dissappeared into a quite clean looking beer. Ok sized fluffy white head that fades rapidly. Very freshly mown grass aroma. Big hop blast upfront though not overly astringent. Just a ton of hop flavor followed by a lingering bite. Some good caramel malt sweetness. Lingering caramel like quality. Soft mouthfeel. Going down way to fast. Very easy drinking and damn pleasant all around. 9%? Where?"
"D: Very great, best English (I know its not made in England) IPA I've had to date. Love this beer."
"Even though I enjoyed this beer quite a bit, I can't say that I could drink a ton of it. The 9% ABV, while fun, is limiting. Theres also something about these English style IPA's that just don't sit perfectly with me. They're good, really good in fact, but I just prefer the American versions. That said, this beer is very good. Go get some."
"overall i really liked this one. i ha no clue how strong it was which made it even better. drinks like a champ and went over quite well."
"I probably couldn't drink more than a bomber and am not especially eager to get another one of these. The alcohol is just too strong. Not my favorite Three Floyds (not even close) but it was good to try."
"D- A nice take on the style... with a definite American twist. Drinks about right for the ABV."
"Drinkability - an excellent EIPA. If this is what the onboard officers enjoyed while at sea, sign me up."
"You like hops? This is worth a shot. I mean, c'mon: it's a double IPA from the makers of Dreadnaught."
"Thanks to mbauer for this one, I poured from a bomber into a snifter. It has a hazy orange pour with a moderate sticky white head. Tons of floral hops on the nose. The flavor is very hoppy, lots of floral, and grassy hops, hints of citrus. A full bodied beer, with a sticky mouthfeel, well carbonated. I really could not taste the oak, and I am not sure this is an english IPA. What I do know is it is a great beer, worth seeking out."
"D- Again, after a bomber i'm still going! this is another good brew, but not to the likes of Arctic Panzer Wolf. I'd drink it again."
"Notes: This got easier to drink the longer I sipped it. The advertised British style threw me off - they may have used English ingredients, but this could pass for any well made DIPA (this is to say that good IPA's are universal, not that British offerings are inferior). I was expecting something akin to Stone's Emperial, but I'm definitely not complaining. Given that IPA's were birthed in Britain, I would like to think the beer making its trek from London to Bombay tasted something like this. First bottle of Three Floyds? Yep, lives up to the hype, amazing ale."
"Blackheart pours with a rich, thick head and long-lasting lacing. The brew is a bit darker than your average IPA, a rich mix of amber and honey. The scent is strongly citrus, with grapefruit being the star; there is also a bit of tangerine in the background, and a touch of honey. On taste, there is a lot more resiny malt than one may expect, which lends a subtle, not cloying, brown-sugar sweetness to each sip. While the flavor dominates throughout, the hops in the brew do strongly surface with predominant tastes of lemon and pine. Carbonation is quite good with this one, providing a strong presence throughout, though never overpowering the brew's subtleties. This is definitely a great beer, with it's strength being in the balance of the flavors, and a taste profile that is a welcome variant to the single-focused hop brews currently taking center stage in craft beer (which is certainly not a bad thing, but variation is good!)"
"This is my favorite so far from 3F, my bottle was a bit old, but this is still a standout for an underappreciated style. Hop bombs are not necessary."
"J"
"Great IIPA. very drinkable, barely notice the ABV. Very tasty and NOT normal."
"Overall: Tastey, unique type of IPA. Three Floyds is great at taking a style and deconstructing it into a new work of art. Blackheart is no exception. A pineapple smelling, sweet yet bitter tasting booze bomb. Not exactly what I'd call a traditional English IPA."
"D. Damn drinkable! Great brew. I'll definitely be picking up some more of these the next time I see them. One of my favorite IPAs as of now."
"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. I am not a big IPA or DIPA kinda guy, but I really enjoyed this malt forward English take on the style by 3 Floyds. Pretty damn good brew that I would drink again."
"Bottle. Pours a slightly hazed orange brown color with an off white head. Malty with some oak notes int he nose. Very minimal hops presence in the taste, more malts than anything. Medium mouthfeel. Matly upfront with some citrus rind notes in the end. Some lemon tastes as well. To me it has an odd lingering taste."
"D: English-style IPAs are my thing, and this is the best of them. Quite simply, the best IPA I've ever tasted!"
"Drinkability- While having slight flavor issues that detract from the style they are claiming, this is an excellent pint that I would love to enjoy at the brewery if I were to make a tour there. I am pleased I have another bottle and will be sure to enjoy this with friends."
"It's a bit sweet but I could finish this bomber and probably another before getting sick of it."
"D - Very interesting, though not something I'd typically crave."
"The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma is caramel malt with some flowers and perfume notes. The flavor is very heavy on the caramel malt, but I also get some orange citrus, grass and flowery hops. The bitterness is about medium. A very good aroma and flavor combination. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Another good beer from Three Floyds."
"This is an exceptional brew overall. A unique IPA that is of great quality. Kind of wish I would have picked up more. I am enjoying the hell out of this one."
"D: I love 3F's beer but not sure if I love the BH. I think this beer is a little to malty for me."
"D: I think that if I were going for an English IPA, I would not get this one again, for the reason that it is too floral/citrus hoppy, but none the less very enjoyable."
"D. It is my understanding that the major difference between English IPAs and American is that the English is more balanced and has a more pronounced malt flavor. That is the case with Blackheart as well, but at 9%abv I think the addtional malt that is in this beer teeters on being a barleywine. This is a easy drinking good beer."
"Overall: This tasted so much like so many others of the IPA style that I found it forgettable. It seems like the syrupy malt/citrus-pine hop combination is becoming very common among American craft breweries that produce stronger IPA styles. What I'd like to see in this beer, as a supposedly English-inspired style, would be a leaner body; not necessarily lighter, just drier, not so excessively sugary and sticky. A drier body combined with a more earthy, herbal or spicy choice of hop flavors rather than the commonly used pine/citrus would, to me, taste closer to an English style and wouldn't eclipse the barrel aging so much. While this was an affable enough beer for someone with a taste for IPAs, the been-there-drank-that experience wasn't worth the high price to me (roughly twice that of nearly all other bombers at the store, including those of comparable style)."
"This is a very complex flavorful beer. The booze holds down the drinkability a little, but overall, a great offering and another winner from the 3F guys!"
"22 ouncer purchased at the brewery. No freshness info/bottling date info on the bottle. Hazed medium honey amber. Long lasting off white head and oodles of lacing bits. Soft hoppy nose.Tasty EIPA of better then average quality. Tasty stuff, lacks the depth of flavors of the all stars of the style."
"If you're already a friend of Dreadnaught then don't hesitate to invite Blackheart to your next party."
"D: While not quite an IPA, this was still very enjoyable and something I would seek out again."
"Drinkability: Big flavor and a bit different from the typical IPA, let alone an EIPA; ultimately a bit too sweet but still well worth seeking out"
"Overall, its a good beer...but an English IPA it is not."
"I like this one quite a bit.. I really like a good English IPA if its done right and this one is... Its earthy and hoppy and bitter as hell while bringing a nice cask feel to it... Well done, 3F..."
"D: drank quite well and was surprised at the hop and booze bite to be considered a english style IPA. Honestly its a west coast style IPA from the midwest."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is a bit lower for me, it's the style, not this particular brew. Overall, I thought this was a good example of an English IPA, it just not my bag. Skal."
"Notes: I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with this beer. Since it is 9% and more intense than your average and somewhat mild English IPA, does that make it a true English IPA as it was when it really was sent to India or is it simply a Imperial English IPA? Based on what I have tasted I would say its a marriage of DIPA and English IPA, however, maybe old English IPA's really were like this...if so brew more please!"
"4.0 D: English styles for the most part aren't my thing, but this was a good one. Good taste and a great mouthfeel make this one quite palatable."
"D- This one was easy to drink for sure and creeped on me for sure. Very glad to finally have gotten a hold of a couple of these."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours an orange/amber color with about an inch frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is floral and citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) hops, along with some caramel and bready malt. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also a little bit of oak noticable. There's a decent balance between the hoppy and malty flavors, and there's a lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and well carbonated. Drinkability is decent, it's not hard to drink at all. I think this is an OK brew, but I'm not a big fan of this one."
"D- For an IPA this beer is heavy on the tongue and the liver making on bomber plenty."
"D: not"
"D - I took my time, but this very easy to drink. A perfect match for a cooler summer evening."
"Blackheart is yellow in color with a fair head and ok lacing. Heavy aromas of oak dominate the nose. The beer is tangy, hoppy, and easily identifiable as being in the English style. Again, oak is very present throughout the taste. The beer has a decent feel. Although it was decent, a small pour was plenty for me. This isn't a beer I would want to consume in quantity."
"A bit odd - they hit the mark for an English IPA hops flavor profile - big smack of bitterning hops up front. Then - well, not much follow-up. The high abv certainly gives the beer a sense of horsepower, but nothing else really steps up after the first hops onslaught. Not bad by any means, but not as complex as 3F's usually pulls off."
"It smooth and drinkable and very easy to drink. Great IPA."
"M/D: Not the most drinkable (you can taste the high abv), but still a very tasty brew."
"Not sure what happened with this beer. The first bottle I bought was clearly not a pale ale of any sort. It poured thick and black (that's what she said) and tested woefully of salt and venom. My frost guess would be that a stout was put in by mistake but being that A: this is three floods and they do not half- ass or fuck up, B: their stout option is Dark Lord (show caps where respect is due) and C: I haven't ruled out that the ghetto- ass liquor store where i got it might have skunked it, I am willing to overlook my first bad experience with a three floods beer. It smells and tastes like an ipa, but a more refined one (guess that's where the ""English"" thing comes into play). Better than average, though not great. The best part about this veer is it's potency. Granted, 9% isn't quite barley wine but it's still a strong friggin ale. Would i buy it again? Yes, soon? Eh..."
"D - Not too bad, something about the taste leaves me not necessarily wanting tons of this beer."
"Drinkability: This pairs extremely well with the aged Spanish goat cheese I am snacking on; each flavor really helps to bring out the other. This is quite an enjoyable brew. As an IPA lover, I like that it is different than most other U.S. IPA offerings."
"I really enjoyed this big flavorful brew. This is something I could sip on night after night. Thanks alushia for bringing me the bomber, Portsmouth sounds phat!"
"I'm generally not a huge fan of English IPAs (I tend to prefer their American counterparts), but this was a very solid beer. The hoppiness seemed way cranked up, although there is definitely still a balance with the malt backbone. The 8% ABV seemed well hidden and snuck up on me a bit as I drank it, resulting in a very drinkable beer that I would certainly try again."
"Medium bodied, smooth, medium carbonation, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Hard to believe this is a 9.00 % abv beer. This is a very drinkable beer. I wish it was available year round."
"pours a beautiful ripe peach color with 1/2 finger head and a creamy ring that both sticks around and looks very fresh..the smell is floral with grapefruit pineapple mango, peach, and other tropical fruits,grass and some great caramel malts ..WOW!! this is fantastic dipa with mango up front then hops and grapefruit hit you then some more tropical fruit notes with some grassy notes it finishes with nice full sweet malts that balance it out..it was fantastic and fresh..mouth feel is medium/full with tastes all over the palate..this bomber is disappearing as i write this..its an awesome DIPA?/IPA it rivals dreadnaught.very very good highly recommended"
"This is also available in bombers right now. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who would like a grown-up's ale. No gimmicks, just high-quality English ale."
"Drinkability is good. High ABV make itself known about halfway through, but it's still a good one to sip."
"I like it and would drink a couple of bottles in a row but very slowly and not driving anywhere!"
"d - I thought this was a pretty good beer. Enjoyed the floral and fruity hops. Would like to try again."
"6/1/2010"
"I really wish I could get this at home. This is a great beer that I couldn't get enough of."
"The beer pours a bright, solid orange color with good head retention and considerable sticky lacing all around. Really, this IPA just looks terrific. On the nose, this beer immediately reminds me of the Alpha King, but with more orange citrus and less noticeable sweet malt (all positive differences in my book). Flavor profile replicates the nose, but the sweet malt in this beer completely dominates the hoppy bitterness. There's certainly plenty of hoppy bitter goodness in this beer, it's very prominent and noticeable, but at the end of the day, it's the sweetness in this beer that really stands out. On the other hand, while the mouthfeel is comes across as sweet and rich, and relatively full, I'm impressed by how well integrated the alcohol is in this beer. You can certainly tell the abv. is up there, but the beer is not the least bit heavy or tiring on the palate. The sweetness is a bit overdone I think, which ultimately hurts the beer's drinkability just a bit, but nevertheless, I found this to be a very interesting and enjoyable beer. It's not my favorite syle of IPA/DIPA, but nevertheless, I thought this a very solid beer."
"Drinkability -- Three Floyds sets the bar high with their bottled offerings, especially in the hops department, and this one certainly makes the grade. Floral, delicate, smooth, but with enough hop bitterness to be assertive and well-rounded. This is a really enjoyable Double IPA that shows that there's more to the style than ordeal by hop resin."
"Overall, a nice one to try, and another good beer from Three Floyds."
"Drinkability: The ABV is apparent here, but it's very nicely brewed and in general a well crafted beer. It tastes a lot healthier than it probably is, and it's hard to drink at a slow pace, it's so delicious."
"This is a great English IPA but the hop character takes on an unexpected citrus note (from Columbus hops?), creating an interesting interplay with the very English-like esters. Still, the toasted oak contributes little."
"D- This is a good beer but a 22oz is enough for me. FFF does a good take on a English IPA. Nothing to extreme for this brewery and it's a refreshing thing for once."
"Dig the new label. This thing had some of the stickiest lacing ive ever seen. Awesome beer to a style I just dont drink enough of... now if we can just get 3floyds bombers for less that $12 plus 10.25% tax in the city!!"
"The beer was as described. It is a hopped up beer, using English floral hops instead of the typical American hops. There was still the malt profile you'd expect in an English IPA, but obviously with a greater prominance given to the hopping. I didn't know what the abv was, but I found it quite drinkable and I finished my glass in minutes."
"This beer has been sitting in the back of the cooler at work for almost a year. Today the boss finally knocked the price down low enough that I could afford to take a one home. It pours a coppery color with a nice dense head. The beer also has a really nice cascading effect when it is poured. As I was looking at the beer the hop aroma was aready drifting out to my nose. It's sweet smelling possibly floral with sweeter malts coming through. The taste is exellent. Up front is this great hop bite that rolls into malty sweet back bone. For me this beer has a great balance. No one part takes the other. Another great beer from Three Floyds!"
"SkÅL!"
"Again mint on finish."
"First IPA my fiance has liked btw"
"drinkability is good but more of a sipper since this brew is 9% abv"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. It's pretty drinkable, especially for 9%. It's not your typical IPA for sure, it has a lot of barleywine characteristics so it might not be for everyone. Very tasty though if you like those flavors, a pretty good beer all around."
"To me, this is one high-octane English IPA. Delicious."
"Drinks too easy would never believe this was 9.0% ABV, plus nails the style to the 98th percentile as far as my mind's eye was getting shipped to British troops, back in the day. Great effort from FFF!"
"Thick beer, almost syrup like sweetness that clings a bit to much. Medium body, don't think I would go after another. To sweet for my likeing."
"Drinkability is hurt by the bitterness. Flavors are nice, authentic, but just a bit huge and in your face. Just a bit out of balance, and maybe a bit big for some of these particular flavors."
"Nice little beer here. The alcohol was noticeable but not overly distracting. I haven't been a huge fan of English IPA's in the past, but this one has broken the mold and is definitely the best of the style that I have tried. Buy it if you see it!"
"Thank you to Fidel904 for this one. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. White foamy head with long lasting sticky lacing. Not sure on the age of the bottle. I assume that it is from this year, so I guess that makes it 5 months old. Smelling and tasting some of the sweetness of the malt backbone in a yummy way. Probably wasn't pronounced when the beer was fresh but its here now and I'm not complaining. Some of this sweetness is also probably derived from the oak barrel. The British hops are a nice change of pace from the usual hop profiles that I love in America IPA's. I guess there isn't a category for English Double IPA or this beer would be in it, I'm sure. Great beer. Wish FFF was available in Florida. Maybe one day..."
"I'd be hard pressed to drink more than one of these bad boys, though as a stand alone drink, it is certainly one of the more interesting brews I've had to date."
"Pours a dark gold/bronze with a nice white head and some lacing as it goes down. The hops and the oak completely dominate the nose, in a good way. The taste is a little bit of a disappointment after the nose, with the hops and the oak not blending quite enough--in fact, even though this is an IPA, I'm almost tempted to commit the cardinal sin and age this one for a while to see what develops. The mouthfeel is thick for the style but well within range. Drinkability is somewhat hampered by what I feel might be a little too much oak for what it is right now."
"D: A really good FFF offering that could use a little more malt depth to be a masterpiece. It is still a unique beer with it's floral and citrus tinged fruity sweetness."
"(D)- A very unique yet interesting IPA that is rather sweet. It surprised me with its over the top malting which makes it more like an Old Ale, but why follow the rules? Great stuff!"
"Poured a cloudy orange with a two finger head that faded to a collar. The aroma was citrus, not a surprise from the boys at FFF. The taste was hoppy orange and bitter at the start and finish, with malty sweet in the middle. The feel was medium bodied and oily, with sufficient carbonation. Drinkability was good. If memory serves me, Blackheart reminded me of FFF's barleywine."
"Pours a very nice slightly hazy orange copper hue. Very frothy head that leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Head decreases over time but leaves a nice ring. I can taste hints of pineapple, malty, slightly hoppy but not overdone. Fruity prunish pineapple smells. This is a very drinkable beer, makes me wish I had a case for the big game tommorrow."
"An English IPA at 9% ABV? Alrighty then. The pour results in a orange, slightly hazy fluid with two fingers of white head. The head has good retention before settling to a thick cap. Heavy spotty lacing is left on the glass. The claim is all English ingredients. Three Floyds must of used the English ingredients I do not like. Where are the floral and herbal hops I adore? Instead we get sickly sweet aroma and taste that is overly sweet and citric. Tangerine, pineapple, sweet malt, honey, all via for attention from the senses. Has alcohol warming in the finish. The aging on oak does add some interesting components if you can get by the sweetness. Adds a slight wood and vanilla flavor. The body is medium with a slick, oily texture. More like a barley wine than a pale ale. I did not enjoy this beer. I love English style ales but this is went into a direction I did not like."
"Nicely drinkable. I find this nice for an Oaked IPA. I've always preferred the freshness of America IPA's vs the toasted more muted nature of English IPA's"
"Looks good with a copper color, great clarity and very little head. The aroma is a complex mix of oak, alcohol, toasted malt and nuts. The flavor is quite intense with oak and alcohol in the lead giving it a bourbon like quality. There's a solid malt contribution (but to me it's overshadowed by the oak and alcohol) and a mild bitterness. After having had a few heavily oaked IPAs, I'm not so sure I like the combination. The mouthfeel is smooth and low in carbonation. This, to me, was the beer's best quality. Overall this one didn't work for me. The oak and alcohol were just too apparent."
"Doesn't taste quite as good as it smells. The malt is still exceptionally sweet and buttery, the hops are still big and wonderfully varied, but everything doesn't click as perfectly as they do in the aroma. Still very good, though."
"First off the art on the lable is sick. I love that style of tattoo art. My next ink session will be in that style. I saw this at my local store and they hadn't even got the price on the bottles so I assume this is fresh. Poured into my pint glass the beer is orange amber heavy on the orange. The head is enormous. It's a thick creamy white color. It hasn't receded at all so I will have to take a drink to talk about lacing. The aroma is hoppy but, sweet fruit shines through as well. Almost bubblegum like. The flavor is hops and toasted malt. It has a strange flavor that I can't seem to decipher. It's not a bad flavor but, I just have never had an English IPA before so it may be the style of hops. Back to the lacing. Wow! Thick lace completely covers my glass. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall a very good yet different beer for me."
"We lie on our backs gazing up at the clouds and seeing shapes... and enjoy."
"D: High for such a big beer. Watch out."
"I actually prefer this to dreadnaught, but not one of the top IPA's I've head."
"Nice golden amber, scent of floral. Goes down easy, with a caramel-like hint and a pronounced hoppy bitterness. Smooth and tasty, and totally representative of a good, solid IPA. Not a groundbreaking or unique brew, but certainly solid and enjoyable."
"Appearance is excellent- a clear, coppery liquid with a fine 2 finger head which stays around for a bit. Smells caramelly and sweet. Taste is a bit sweet, and I was surprised at the subtle taste of the hops in this English IPA. They're in the background- a bit bitter, but not overwhelming. Taste and mouthfeel are almost barleywine-ish. A little lighter, but the Malt taste is up front. Very dry, the beer leaves almost zero aftertaste. It's there and then gone. I would say drinkability is not that high, but I just realized this beer is going down faster than I thought."
"D - This is one seriously yummy EIPA that (thankfully) doesn't contain the signature overabundance of Amarillo hops (or any, for that matter). It's a really good recipe, and the toasted oak aging really adds a nice hit of extra flavor to help brace against the 9% ABV. One of FFF's better ""rare"" offerings."
"A pretty good beer overall. I know they used all English hops, yeast, and malts, but to me it was a cross between a citrusy American IPA and a spicy/earthy English IPA. The oak added a unique flavor that worked. Next time I would let the bottle sit out longer before cracking."
"Interesting enough, but not a beer I'd care to get again, given the hefty price tag."
"Received in a trade for some Hopslam; thanks, Drew! Poured into a pint glass, this beer had a nice golden body with a thin white head. Aroma is of hops, sugar and vanilla. Full bodied creamy and syrupy mouthfeel. This beer is mostly sweet and overly oaky with an almost cloying finish that has very little hop bitterness. I appreciate the brewer's intent with the oak and low bitterness to make this taste more authentic as if the barrel had sailed for months, however it just wasn't my cup of tea. I don't think I'll be having this one again soon."
"This is the third time I've had a chance to sit down and enjoy this beer. I've needed to try it a few times to give it an accurate rating because of the complexity of the flavors found in this tasty English IPA. The first time I tried it I was a little overwhelmed by the flavors I was experiencing and could not identify them. One of the unique flavors that I detect in this beer is an after taste of English Toffee. The mouth feel is smooth and creamy. It's not too carbonated, so I can get a better sense of the various flavors. As with many Three Floyds, this is a great beer, but I can only drink one or two glasses before I get overwhelmed by the flavor."
"Ordered from Archer Liquors. Hazy burnt orange color with bright white centimeter head This definitely isn't an American-style IPA, as I still have feeling in my tongue. Hops are more floral in character and there's a crapload of malt and sugar to back them up. A bit buttery. You can definitely taste the oak in this one. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, a little syrupy and sticky, and carbonation is medium. Overall I like this a lot. Very interesting departure typical American styles."
"Drinkability: What a great brew. It's essentially an English DIPA, a (faux-)style I've never had occasion or the opportunity to try before. I'll be damned if it feels or seems like a Double/Imperial anything, however - the alcohol on this one, though formidable on paper, is nowhere to be seen or felt. As many have mentioned, yes, the bottle artwork is grotesque, but it's in no way indicative of the contents. What's within is a well-crafted, unique, drinkable, and enjoyable brew from a great brewery. Perhaps a little tough on the wallet at $9 or $10, but I could see this as an occasional special treat, or paired with some spicy, braised meat or Mexican food of some sort. Color me impressed."
"Overall, this is my first beer ever from three floyds and I have enjoyed it greatly. I look forward to trying more in the future."
"Pours a very nice dark copper with sweet head and nice lacing. Huge hop scent, slightly overwhelming at first; extremely floral with a vit of jerky in the nose. Huge hop flavor, too; like a tangerine jerky stick; very hoppy (EK Golding I think are the primary), needs more malt to it, but wonderful if you like hop bombs. Goes down quite smooth for a 9% brew."
"D- easy to finish, like any three floyds IPA. i like this one as a seasonal. that way i know i can get it when its fresh, and i wont have the temptation to pay 12$ for a bottle of this that often. overpriced, but a good beer none the less. the most enjoyable barrel aged IPA ive had."
"I started off strong on this bomber, but by the end of it I was getting a little sick of the wood taste, it was a little too much like licking furniture. Overall, a good brew though."
"If Samuel Smith were to brew a DIPA, they could do worse than replicate this FFF effort. A slightly cloudy, coppery pint topped by a thin white head leads to a full-bodied brew perfectly balanced by a substantial hop presence in the back of the throat and the depths of the nostrils. The English hops lend a more subdued quality to this style than the left coast big-C hops typical of DIPAs. A nice dry oak flavor backs up the hops like Entwistle did for Townsend, keeping this extreme brew tamed and the taste buds clamoring for more."
"Poured a nice copper color with a 1 finger head. Smelled of citrus hops, oak and a hint of vanilla. Very smooth on the tongue, I think it must be the oak. I find most oak aged beers to feel this way. Hops were present in the taste but I think the oak pretty much took over. No hint of 9% alcohol whatsoever. I easily put the bomber down at dinner. I liked this beer but I would have preferred more hops and less oak taste. I thought it was good but as the beer warmed the oak was too prevalent. I love FFF beers and I was happy to try this. Dreadnaught and alpha king are 2 of my all time favorites."
"if your from nw indiana or southside of chicago , there is no reason not to pick up some of the 3 floyds IPA's, Brilliant!"
"D - 22 oz. wasn't quite enough for me, i could probably do another 22, but then it is time to move on. give this one a try if you have the chance!"
"Overall, a balanced, drinkable English IPA. FFF is known for hopping the bejesus out of their beers (and I don't complain), but both fresh and aged this beer was balanced and well done. I'll take more."
"From bottle into tulip glass. Pours a clear light copper with two fingers of head that slowly fade, stubbornly clinging to the sides of the glass. The smell presents mostly malt characteristics (warm caramel/creme brulee) with a pleasant whiff of grapefruit underneath and a touch of oak and vanilla. The mouthfeel is rich, medium-bodied, with enough carbonation to keep all flavors working at the same time. Sweet toffee takes the lead with some grapefruit tartness. The finish is a wonderful mix of bitter hops and light alcohol rounded out by the subtle oak characteristics of smoke and vanilla. This beer truly displays balance. No single flavor dominates and no IBU records are broken. Instead, this beer provides a complex balance of elements that seemlessly meld in every way (mouthfeel/smell/taste). If at all possible, this should be in your fridge right now."
"D= This is how I have always imagined the IPAs back in the day would taste after making the long sea voyage from England to India. Very good balance of flavors, with the oak complimenting the hops very nicely. The ABV stays dangerously well hidden. A most outstanding ale that I will seek out again for sure."
"I think Three Floyds needs to moderate the oak presence in this as well as their barrel-aged beers. If anything, they become less complex, harsher, and less drinkable (see OA Dark Lord and OA Behemoth). So much of the depth of flavor is just obliterated. I know the Floyds are all about extremes, but perhaps tasteful restraint is becoming the new counter-culture."
"Terrific brew! Looks great and tastes delicious."
"TPatuto and I split a bottle of this and loved it. It poured a great looking straw color with a small head that quickly turned into a light haze on top. The smell was the only lacking part of this beer to me, just didn't get alot out of it. Taste was great! A touch of bitterness and then the oak took over. Sweet vanilla with a little bite like a whisky. Went down smooth and was REALLY easy to enjoy. Would buy this again in a heartbeat!"
"D - VERY drinkable. very enjoyable. Good Balance and pleasant throughout."
"This years version is even better than last years. I strongly recommend picking one up or trading for one if you are on the fence. Easily the best from this style I've had."
"This amazingly smooth IPA will have me begging for more. Good thing I'm drinking by myself tonight. This one is going to go down smooth. Too smooth for the robust 9%."
"Didn't realize this one clocked in at 9%. Full mouthfeel with not much indication of alcohol."
"Pours golden with foamy white head. Significant lace retained in the glass. The hops are aromatic:East Kent Goldings & Admiral. Coconutty taste from the start, above average mouthfeel though it burns by the end somewhat. Drinkable. Turn away the label and drink."
"A full silky mouthfeel, goes down much easier than it should at 9% abv, a keeper and find more of this...."
"From a fresh IPA perspective, this is not at its hoppy best, but this has aged pretty gracefully and is still perfectly inline with the Three Floyds interpretation of a Double IPA (big malt along with the hop focus)."
"I haven't had too many chances to try one of these ""authentic"" English Style IPAs (complete with oak aging and a higher ABV), so this was a welcome chance to try one. After tasting this, I'd be interested in seeking out some more."
"7/4/8/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Thanks to mcallister for sharing."
"Intersting beer."
"D: Very drinkable, more than many for the style. This may be the first one I've had that said abouit being an ""English"" IPA on the bottle. It was a very good beer and I enjoyed it."
"A big bubble rocky two inch head is light tan in color and leaves a bit of doted lace. Body is a orange amber glass like body. Nose has a musky sweet hop character including tones of citrus peel, pine, paprika and resin like marmalade. Enters the mouth with that same citrus based resiny feel with first sip. It then turns to a mineral based piney feel on the back of the tongue and that hangs on the the buds strong. A mixture of musky malt , dry spices and orange peel make up an odd mouthfeel. Drinkability is hampered by this a bit for me."
"feel is nice and smooth, and this is a very drinkable beer, but at 9%, I am not sure how many I should have."
"Medium sized lacy cream colored head. Lightly carbonated. Bright clear orange amber color. Smells quite juicy, fruity, with some toffee and cigar tobacco. Starts quite malty sweet but with a good hop balance. Alcohol is prominently present throughout. Lasting bitter finish with a sweet sticky toffee finish. Would drink again if I could get it."
"D - Overall a quality offering from FFF that is easy to drink and well balanced. It is tasty and would definitely consider buying some more. The English IPA style also seems to be one that I don't find often enough. Good Solid Beer."
"Poured a 22oz bomber into my Brother Thelonious goblet. This beer pours a crystal clear orangey red with a big 2 inch head that quickly disappeared and leaving, surprisingly, no lacing. I imagine this bottle is a little old, but you wouldn't expect so from the nose. It's a full frontal attack to the nose. It's straight grassy hops, with a little spiciness coming from some noble hops and really raw oak. Wow, the flavor reminds me of hop-laced ethanol. Up front, its big hops, on the tail it's straight booze. You would think that this beer would have somewhat of a malty flavor, just because of how much alcohol is in it but nope, I don't taste any malty sweetness. The mouthfeel is a tad thin for how big this beer is. Wow, with as hoppy as this beer is with a bit of age, I can't imagine how it was really fresh."
"There is an alcohol presence, not unsurprising for abv level, yet very drinkable. Something of an English IPA on steroids with vanilla/oak notes. Interesting."
"drinkability is good. nicely balance. i like the addition of the oak in this one. even though the hops have a bit of an american slant, the oak and the great malty base seems to pull it back towards the english side. good stuff."
"Murky orange with some light breaking through the haze. Creamy surface of offwhite foam, a small bit of lacing at the edges of the tulip glass. Buttery caramel aroma, some sweetness and hidden oak also in the nose. Sweet caramel, orange peel, and dried apricot flavors, light oak in the dry bitter aftertaste. Savory feel, showing age slightly, but definitely integrated with the oak."
"poured a clear glowing orange/copper into a tulip with a creamy head and nice lacing. nose was woody, minty, floral, and earthy with biscuity/cracker-like malts. some alcohol noted. sweet malts are overtaken by the minty/sprucey hop bitterness. long, spicy, minty/sprucey finish with some warming alcohol. medium to full in body with prickly carbonation. maybe i'm spoiled by american dipa's but this was not one of my favorite 3F's offerings."
"M/D: Body is medium, a bit viscous and carbonation is low. Drinkability is OK. For an English IPA I expected a much tamer brew, but what I got was a nice surprise. The lack of balance is the only real critic I can make. Overall a good beer."
"D - What can I say? I love FFF, and this is a good one. Not as hoppy as the other FFF brews, as it's an English IPA. Great beer overall."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, hoppy, balanced, semi dry finish."
"D: Tasty and my favorite from the style."
"I would drink this again if it wasn't so hard for me to get, and i wasn't such a big fan of American IPAs lately. A tasty treat, and a great reminder of where the style started."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very nice representation of style while taking that style to the next level which isn't often done with an EIPA and even less often done well. This is a very good beer to drink for a whole evening."
"Overall a solid brew. Dreadnaught is still my favorite FFF beer (still have to try DL...waiting for a special occasion) by far."
"Medium body with creamy carbonation. The 9% abv is nowhere to be found in the smell or taste. Great job with that. I could drink these until I was feeling that 9% and maybe then some. Very tasty beer. Good job, 3F!"
"Pours a cloudy golden orange color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy head, with some nice thick creamy sticky lacing. The nose is hoppy with some malts, bourbon/whiskey, slight oak, with some citrus. The taste is very nice, really different, hoppy, with some malts, oaky, with some bourbon/whiskey notes, sweet, with some citrus. Medium body. Very drinkable, like I said this is a different English IPA, also never had a English IPA at 9% ABV. Glad to have a chance to check this badboy out, Thanks Christian."
"D- This big has nice big hops with some interesting qualities to them and a sweetness that really punch up the hops. This beer is so big it needed a glass of water to go with it. No it's not really thirst quenching but very tasty."
"Very good beer with some unique characteristics. Recommended if you haven't tried it yet!"
"A deep amber color with hints of orange at the bottom of the glass. A two inch thick head, cream in color, that laces slowly down the glass. A malty fragrance at the front, that is followed by a pine and grassy aroma. A malty front that lasts for some time, then a grassy and earthy bitterness takes over and lingers on the palate. A medium feel, at the front, that gradually gains weight as it rolls across the palate. This beer gets more complex as it warms up, excellent to sip while playing cards or throwing darts. It does have a more hoppy flavor for a english style IPA, the malty heartiness is strong enough to overcome that and balance it out."
"Drinkability- This is a sipper for sure that I'm glad I picked up. I wasn't going to spend the cash on another FFF IPA because I figured it would be similar to the rest. After reading the label I decided it was worth a try and I'm glad I did. It was a vastly different brew than the other American IPA's. Definitely worth a try if you can find it or trade for it."
"Thanks again, Joe!"
"Full body, with appropriate carbonation. Very well done. The oak adds a nice character to this."
"Pours a bright translucent orange amber with a healthy 2-finger head and a steady stream of bubbles coming to the top. The retention is good and leaves solid lacing. The aroma is a balance of citrus hops up front and a strong caramel malt base. There is also a heavy dose of earthy hops throughout as well. The taste mirrors the aroma with a grapefruit and grassy hop kick giving way to the caramel malt base. There is a bit of spiciness in the finish as well as some hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of carbonation and leaves the mouth sticky with the earthy hop juice. The drinkability is fantastic on this one and I don't notice the alcohol at all. The best example of an English IPA (if you can call it that) I've tasted to date."
"Pours a cloudy amber with a medium beige head. Aroma is medium sweet with melon, light biscuit, some floral and earthy. Flavor is floral, earthy, melon and biscuity. Light-medium body, silky texture. Medium bitter finish. Another winner from one of the Midwests best."
"D-An extremely interesting brew. This is an English IPA in name only....like the type of hops used and the name! In no way does this resemble ANY IPA I have ever had in or from England! Not that I care, this is another example of the genius that is FFF."
"D -Not overly taxing. Good stuff."
"D - This is definitely hoppier than I was anticipating for an English-style IPA, yet it still maintained an extremely nice balance between hops and malts. It also has a very unique flavor, and I can honestly say that I never tasted a beer quite like this one, and I've had a lot of IPAs. FFF is turning into one of my favorite breweries!"
"*Trader's Note: Thanks to BinnysKyle for the bottle."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish/ yellow/ copper-ish color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, small grapefruity/ lemon citrus, and a hint of black pepper. In the taste, pepper, lemon citrusy hops. A small bite and medium body mouthfeel, and a dry hoppy, peppery aftertaste. Nice English maltiness, and nice lemon citrusy hops. Very good."
"Not at all what I expected -- a much bigger beer, heading in barley wine direction. The color was a pleasant russet, not much of a head to speak of. The smell is grassy with some pine notes; the taste kicks that up a notch, with the oak tones coming through, as well as some apple. It's a big, viscous, yet oddly quenching mouthfull, with the alcohol well hidden but warming after a few sips. A little of this goes a long way. All in all a very nice beer, but not one I'd come back to very often."
"D-Very good considering the ABV. This is a well-balanced beer for 3Fs and is very consumable. IN fact, I never leave my beer-fridge without a bottle of this at all times. This beer may be enjoyed by new comers as well as the experienced beer geek. This could possible be my favorite accessible beers at this time."
"What a bizzare beer. Pours a dark orange with a big, big head. Lots and lots of lace. Smell is citrusy and funky. A touch of breadiness in there as well. Flavour is indescribable, but I will try. Its like pumpkin pie spices, mixed with cedar wood and lemon zest, I think. Bitterness is very aggressive. There is also a kind of funky twang to it. I would attribute that to the oak, but who knows. I think I like this beer. I just found it really off the wall. Glad I tried it."
"Notes: Take Dreadnaught, cut back on bittering and aroma hops, partially substitute flavor hops and voila! Blackheart!"
"Overall, a good brew."
"Pretty, easy to drink, but I don't love the flavor. Super happy to have given this a try... and I bet a blend of this (or a blend of these hops) with an Alpha King would be out of this world delicious. Just a thought for those of you who live close enough to the source to easily procure bottles."
"D: All around not bad. I guess this was my first English IPA, and I like. I will continue to explore this style."
"Pours a murky orange haze with a fluffy off-white two finger head that stays for sometime before falling to a thin layer of foam. A good amount of webbing is left behind on the sides of the glass. Smell is light pink grapefruit with a pasty malt aroma as well. Some carboard and sweet floral scents in the nose too. Overall the hops are in check, especially for 9% abv. Spicy flavors up front followed by sweet caramel malts and woody herbs. Midway a touch of bitterness emerges with a touch of booze. Aftertaste has a hint of toasted grains with a bit more citrus and grit. Medium slick body with a soft and smooth feel. The carbonation is a bit on the strong side and prickly. A bit on the strong side in terms of abv for the style, but after further reading I guess that's how the original English IPA's were brewed. A truly unique spiced up IPA. I just can't get over how graphic the label is, sweeet."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full. Medium to low carbonation."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"Interesting. I can't ever remember tasting an IPA like this. Guess I've never had an ""historical English IPA"". I likey. Gimme more."
"D - Certainly not a session beer, but it is really a wonderfully complex construction with a bitterness that dances right up to the line of being overpowering without losing balance. Try it!"
"This beer poured a dark very cxloudy amber (always a good sign) The smell is limited but what I get is nuts/citrus. I was suprised by the taste I don't think I have ever had an english IPA before. To me it seemed like an american IPA mixed with an English Pale ale (with the nut flavors). The mouth feel is very pleasant, it is nicely carbonated. this is a very dinkable beer and I wish I had my wife pick up more than 2 of these for me! Another fine brew by FFF"
"I really liked this brew. Good stuff."
"Pours a light hazey, yet bright copper wih some cool bubbling, and no lacing. ONly a small film of bubbles greets you after the pour. Good color, but bad head and lacing for an IPA. The aroma is a straight forward orange zest, some chammomile and lots of bitter smelling bread. The taste is very sessionable for a 9% abv. Mild hops for an American, English IPA But a great malt bill. Hints of caramel, a touch of cinnamon and unrecognizable herbs. Very easy feeling palate. Great sessionablilty for such a high abv beer. Was actually very refreshing for such a beer."
"Blackheart's a unique English IPA. Frankly, I'm not a huge fan of the style. I prefer the American variety much more. Though I still do, I can't help but feel like this is an English IPA on steroids. The sheer strength of it sets it apart from the masses. It also has a lot more character than its colleagues. I'm still not converted into a huge fan, but this is a good beer. Probably very good given the style. Recommended."
" I was handed a Reddish Amber IPA supporting a pillowy head. The creamy mellow body that cresses yet covers your mouth in a silk. The aroma was mostly pina coloda but there was so much more subtlety form the cask it was overwhelming. I had two pints but still can't pin it down. What I do know is I need more cask ale. Real Ale now."
"Blackheart's label has to be one of Three Floyds most grotesque... in a good way. This is delicious beer that doesn't quite have the magnificent mojo that most of their lineup has. I'm having a fantastic time with the bomber, but given the $9.99 price tag, I'd rather buy sixers of Alpha King or Gumballhead."
"Pretty solid all around."
"D: This is a fantastic beer! I loved the interplay between the sweet malt and bitter hops. They need to make this year round!"
"Light gold color with a bounitful head of foam. Great hop nose, pure 3 Floyds. Minty, super juicy and citrusy, also a little herbaceous as well. Flavor has a ton of character and is nearly perfect. Incredibly well balanced. Super hoppy and bitter, with a lot of juicy citrus character, a lush malt character of caramel and sugared fruits, and then on top of all that, it has well intergrated oak hints of vanilla and toasted wood. A surprise. What a well crafted brew."
"I really thought this was the most balanced beer I've had from FFF's, and I hope they keep making this beer. It was really a treat."
"Wow! Probably the best beer I've had this year. Need more."
"D: This beer is very drinkable and gives a nice bold taste with plenty of carbonation to refresh and give continued revitalization to the hops. The beer could use some more background taste besides the bitter hops, but a wonderful beer overall. Three Floyds once again creates another great beer and I hope they brew this one more than once."
"much thanks to BuckeyeNation!"
"Drinkability - This is one unusual and interesting beer. The dryness helps make the beer refreshing and inviting - as long as you're a hop head like me."
"Pours a hazed copper, thin white head forms, big bubbles, some decent lacing, settles to a thin ring around the glass. Smell is neat, signature 3F grapefruit, but with oak, caramel, oranges, some citrus, biscuity malts, alcohol, pretty unique. Taste is very oaky, grapefruit, oranges, caramel, bread, alcohol, lots of malt and lots of hops, tempered by wood, very malty in the finish, almost balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth, warming alcohol, but pretty cool, I liked!"
"D: Good the IBU's are hidden and though it is an English style it is still way Yum on my scale. I enjoyed it. Search it out, I think you will as well."
"Ovr: Very nicely done. Good balance and nice citrus hoppiness."
"This is one of my favorites from FFF. I immediately went out and bought some more. Highly recommended."
"Blackheart is a damn good brew. It seems to be more of an Engish/American IIPA hybrid than one that uses only English ingredients, but that is just fine by me. Another solid one from 3Fs I'm glad I grabbed two bottles."
"D: I'm definitely glad I had the opportunity to try this one, it was quite enjoyable. Just watch out for the high ABV. Another finely crafted brew from Three Floyd's - recommended."
"D: Great tasting beer and intensly drinkable, but I don't know how well it fits into the actual style of an English IPA. Still though I would not hesitate to grab another one of these, especially if it is fresh on tap."
"Drinkability - Is fantastic. I loved the oak. The ABV was hidden dangerously too well. Highly recommended!"
"I really liked this beer, it seemed light, even from the scent I didn't expect it to be so strong. I love the lasting hoppy aftertaste. Fresh this was a damn good beer, and I can only hope it will be good with a little age. Recommended."
"Pours a nice, dark amber in color. Very well balanced with the various hops. Smell is somewhat fruity and citrusy. This is very well made. It is so easy to drink, and so enjoyable, that I would think this would be a highly sessionable beer for me. But at 9%, this one would hurt you in a hurry. But I would love the trip. Well done FFF."
"As expected for a british style IPA, the aroma and taste show a nice hop and malt balance, with fresh fruitiness, breadiness and even some sweetness counterbalanced by waves of bitterness. Medium bodied, easy to drink, it could use some improvement in appearance but is otherwise a solid (british) IPA."
"Overall- This is my favorite FFF beer to date. I loved it!"
"Ahhh. What a good brew! I ordered this Friday night before DLD and was not disappointed! It came in a pint glass that was filled to the brim with a deep orange ale that was slightly cloudy. The smell was just like an IPA should be, a little citrus with a twist of pine. This beer tasted wonderful! Hops at first with the sweet warming of alcohol going down the throat. Light in the mouth and just a hint of aftertaste make this one of the most enjoyable IPAs I have ever had. It is very drinkable but I wouldn't recommend many because it's a deceptive 9% Enjoy!"
"Thick with bready malts, cereal grain, and toffee candy. Some earthy hops on the middle that leads into a floral bitterness with a grassy piney finish. All of this is taken in check with a vanilla, toasty oaky flavor that just pulls things together. An almost marshmallow flavor with a star fruit and lemon zest fruit."
"Drinkability: Certainly different from all other English IPA's I've encountered, but it's good, and isn't that what counts, really?"
"I'm not sure if this one will stick around so you might want to visit the brewpub while you have the chance."
