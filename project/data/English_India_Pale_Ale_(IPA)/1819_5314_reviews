"Would purchase again, but the Batch 1000 is still my favorite  from here. This is another nice go to though."
"Feel:  One of my favorite parts of this beer.  Very comfortable.  Coates the mouth without feeling suffocating at all."

"Overall: really nice IPA. When I went to dinner I was looking for an amber but chose this instead. It went well with a blue cheese burger and I am glad I chose this."

"I had no idea Granite City even bottled... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear amber-copper topped by a finger of off-cream foam. The nose comprises perfume-y flowers, light toffee, light menthol, and a hint of pine resin. The taste brings in more of the same, emphasizing the menthol and adding in some eucalyptus, making it seem as though I'm drinking some sort of Vicks Vap-O-Rub beer or something. (Note to Sam: DO NOT DO THIS!) The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a pretty weak IPA, English or otherwise, one that just plain doesn't taste all that good."
"Overall: I've had Pale Ales that had more powerful hop action then this brew. That being said, this is not a bad beer. Easy drinker which is certainly better then getting any of the major products. Worth the $7.50 to fill up my growler."

"Final Thoughts: I had this beer almost a year ago and thought it was good. Having had lots of experience in IPAs and beer in general since then, my experience this time was not so great. I did a double-take when I noticed its low 5.2% abv on the menu. This is definitely an IPA meant for the first-time drinker. The IBUs and hop character are too low for my taste. It also tastes more like an American IPA than an English IPA. Overall, this is an average beer and a below average IPA."

"Dark amber with an off white head, with decent retention and lacing. Smells and tastes like caramel, with floral and citrus hops. More bitter than sweet. Medium bodied, average carbonation. Has a somewhat bitter aftertaste. A decent beer."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. I liked it and would buy it again, but it wouldn't make the top of my list."
"An easy drinker, with nice sweet and bitter components, but not a lot else going on."
""
"O: Makes me wish I was sitting in a bunker in Bastogne with my Army buddies on a crisp winter night. If this is what the UK troops drank back during the war, I'm happy to know it wasn't shite. Although I have the feeling it was anything they could get."

"Flavors are similar, buttered bread, toast, caramel sweetness. Pretty smooth and bland, definitely British. No hop content to speak of really, a stray floral note maybe? Low carbonation, light to medium body. Seems like an English Pale Ale to me, and the label says ""Pale Ale", no mention of IPA. Pretty pedestrian, tastes similar to the Argus Pegasus ""IPA"" I just had previously."
""
""

"Overall: easy drinking ale. Very basic flavors but satisfying."
""
""
"I got this as part of a BOTMC, dark copper pour with a rock solid 2 finger head, tons of lacing. The beer is full of grassy and floral hops. The flavor is similar to the nose, as well as a ton of caramel malts, pleasantly bitter, lingering finish. The body is on the light side of medium, good carbonation. Solid English IPA."

"Served as part of an 8-beer flight at GC in SLP, MN. Color was light amber with a half finger of foam that left just a wee bit of lacing. Smell was faint bits of citrus over a malt base, definitely IPA-like. Taste was not bitter. Mildly citric hop but with a fairly stiff dose of malt that had some sweetness. Not hoppy. Some earthy elements. Mouthfeel was average. Not a great, and a slightly below average example."

"I thought the Duke of Wellington IPA was the best of the group. The beer poured a hazy orange copper color with a frothy white head that laced. The scent carried bitter citrus like grapefruit and mild floral hops. I thought the taste was pretty good, followed the scent quite closely. There was some malt present to balance the hop and kept the bitterness low. The mouthfeel was decent...medium to light body....definitely sessionable. Overall I thought it was the best and would recommend it."
"O- It's drinkable and not off putting so give this a try from your local granite city"
"Taste-Toasted malt, grapefruit rind, a nice dose of Noble hops. Very much in the English style. Nicely balanced, spicy tasty, decent character and flavor. Worth a try with spicy fare."
"D/O- I get the English IPA thing, but just not a *good* representation if you were to say ""here, this is an English IPA"" to someone who has never had one before."
"O: Not the greatest. Wasn't expecting much out of this one, saw it as a single and said why not since its the first time I've seen them in bottles."
"Well it couldn’t have been worse than the wheat. The smells are the best part of this beer."
"Pours an orange golden color, non lingering head, decent lacing. Smell is very weak. Mild hops, very earthy, small amounts of grapefruit and other citrus. Taste is similar. Just not very hoppy. More earthy than anything. Slight citrus flavor to it. Mouthfeel is ok. Light and heavily carbonated. Earthy flavor lingers on. Overall, definitely not my favorite, but decent enough for a sunday in Indiana when I'm out of beer, and I can't buy beer because of stupid old laws. Come on Indiana, get with it!"
"I think many of the reviews for this beer miss the point of this style. English style IPAs are going to be muted on the hops compared to American IPAs. Since I am not a typical American hophead, I don't mind this. However the sweetness does make me wonder if this should be categorized more as a Belgian IPA."
"Overall: The weakest IPA I have had. I wouldn't recommend this one."
"Dark copper colored brew, hazy, small short-lived white head. Caramel malt scent with some diacetyl. Some caramel malts to start the taste, just a bit of diacetyl, just a touch of hops. Medium bodied and pretty wet. This has homebrew written all over it, not impressed at all."
"While ""The Duke"" isn't the great, it is enjoyable. And considering the price of a Growler on Tuesdays and Thursdays from Granite City, a worthy deal."
"I had this on draft at the St.Louis location. Poured into a pint glass. This English IPA poured a light brown color almost orange. The head it produced was below average, as was the head retention. The aroma was very nice, it has lots of hop and citrus notes. The taste was not as pleasant as the nose. The hops did not shine through nearly as much as the aroma would suggest. There was some nice base malt that gave way to some earthy, almost grassy flavors. This beer smelled much better than it tasted- Drinkability was nice, smooth beer, just not very special."
"O: Well, ""not impressed"" pretty much sums it up. It could be that this was stale, but the store just got it in last week, and judging by other reviews Granite City only started bottling recently, so it can't be that old. Sad to say but this was just not good at all. Wouldn't buy it again, unless someone convinced me that some big changes were made. Too bad, always looking for a new IPA to love, but no love in this bottle."
"Finish: Subtle bitter hop and hints of caramel, flavor is finish on this guy"
"This beer pours a clear amber color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma has a hint of floral hops, but it is very faint. The taste is similar to the aroma. There is a nice bitterness in the finish, but the sip is quite weak. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium bodied with a water texture, and moderate-low carbonation. Overall, I will pass on this beer again."
"If you could combine the beer and mug club from Rock Bottom and the menu of Granite City you'd have the perfect brew pub. Oh, and looser beer laws would help too."
"This beer could really be great if it had more hop flavor. Now it is just a malt dominated pale ale."
"That said, I had the Duke long ago & have generally avoided it; pretty weak sauce. I don't know what they've done, but this incarnation was vastly improved over the old, weaker version that I recall. Good beer."
"While not terrible, it's really hard to imagine ever ordering this again. My impression is that there are plenty of well made IPA's in the twin cities, and this really doesn't seem to be one of them. Mehhhh...."
"D: Its not bad. Nothing to seek out. Its a average IPA at best. GC is a chain of resturants/brewery. There more about quanity over quality. I must say tho, they have the coolest looking growlers!"
"When this beer was served to me it came with a good inch amount of foam with a light amber hue to it. The aroma of hops was the typical amount. The taste followed suit of the hops with some floral but not too much. As far as the mouthfeel the beer kinda lacked on that as the aftertaste was not a lingering one that I desire. Overall this beer was a good beer compared to what else is the norm in SD for beers."
"Not bad."
"FIFTY-SIX IBU's!!! just FYI"
"This is a balanced IPA, and a watery one at that. It tastes fine, but it's not worth seeking out."
"Pours a clear, red/amber color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of dry hops, sweet malt, and slight yeast. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness. Tastes of pale hops, floral hop aroma, and sweet malt. Overall, not complex, weak aroma, but great appearance."
"Overall an average beer. Nothing to get too excited about but if you like IPAs and you're eating here- it's worth a taste."
"My favorite beer of the night!"
"Not a terrible IPA, and I'm sure it's better than everything else on the menu."
"O: As a stand alone beer this was really disappointing, but with food it has a chance to shine. I would recommend not sitting down just to drink this IPA."
"I have read reviews of people who said they have tasted the most rancid beer in their life and it was in a catagory they normally liked. I never understood that until today. That beer was a nasty joke to me from the IPA comunnity."
"If you are a mug club member, 2 of these are more than enough. Not sure what the ABV is, but any more than that, and someone else is driving you home, for sure."
"Drinkability- Not too bad I suppose for a English IPA. Not sure I've had a brew made with Apollo hops but I'm going to assume they are a lot like the fuggles also used. The cascades do nothing for the taste but whatever. Mildly enjoyable."
"A lightly copper,hazy Ipa that has no signs of carbonation & leaves a thin lace. Has very mild floral along with a moderate sweet hop aroma , malt aroma is a light grainyness. As for flavor the malt is very light not that much to notice. hops leave a heavy vegetation flavor as if they were freshly picked. Overall flavor of this beer you get mild sweet malt, then medium bitterness then a vegetable after taste. Mouthfeel: light in body, low carbonation & dryness in the end. Overall this beer could have been a lot better, wasn't awful but it could be balanced out a lot better. It is as if I were drinking a bitter grass beer."
"Appearance is good, darker amber than expected but nice billowing head and lacing. Smell is pretty weak for the style. Almost smells like the hop characters are a mix of English and American. Taste is better, could have use a bit more hops but acceptable. Nice sweet aftertaste to balance it out. Mouthfeel and drinkability are fantastic for this style, right on par, nice work GCFB."
"D: One of the more drinkable IPA's. More balanced than most."
"Overall - I liked this beer, but I tend to lean toward the IPAs. The balance is what stands out here."
"Stopped in for a quick beer en route from the airport. This IPA was a clear golden color brew poured cold into a big pint glass at the Kansas City Brew Pub. It had a fair white head and polite lacing. The aroma was a certain high pitched citrus hop and not much else, though that's not necessarily a bad thing. And indeed, the first taste confirmed that this is pretty much about cat piss hops and it wasn't too bad. It's a bit thin in feel but it's just fine for a hop fix, very drinkable as long as you like your hops by the bucket. I enjoyed it, not everyone will, but the heck with them!"
"Medium copper/amber. Small whispy head of white foam. Aromas of biscuit malt and light hop. Malts dominate and this is truly English in style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and almost light. Drinkability is decent, but this is somewhat bland and boring. At least they tried."
"D - This was pretty decent for the style, fairly mild and balanced."
"D: I was pleasantly surprised, so much so that I almost bought a growler. A good IPA from a decent chain."
"Easy to drink once you get used to the lack of flavor. There are much, much better IPAs out there. I wish this had been one of them."
"Overall it was nicely drinkable, and if possible I would have had another. This isn't a great IPA, or even a very good one, but it is good."
"The barmaid poured the beer into a 20 oz glass. The beer has an amber color with a medium head. I liked the clean, citrus-infused taste and the high carbonation."
"D - Eh. I'm an IPA fan but this one just wasn't very interesting. Fairly hoppy but not the best flavor."
"if you are a hophead this is not the beer for you"
"Served on tap in an imperial pint glass, this pours a clear orange-amber color, with a smallish white head that rapidly disappears and a scant amount of white lacing on the glass. There is virtually no smell. The taste has many of the right elements. There is a piney and grqpefruity hop flavor. There is minimal malt flavor to back it up. Yet, somehow the flavors seem dilute, as if the beer was watered down. The alcohol content is respectable(slightly more than 5%)The flavors are there, but the mouthfeel is thin. I had a harder time than I thought I would finishing it, because there just wasn't much to it."
"D-easy drinker would not have a problem making a night of this one."
"D- not bad, solid drink i wouldnt turn down, but with bitter woman and hop hearty nearby ide prolly go with those"
"As is, this was the better, if not the best of beers I had, and the only one I will be reviewing as the others would be a waste of time, energy, and words."
"Dark orange-copper with a small off-white head. Aroma of citrus and pine. Boozy, bitter, and citric taste. Not a bad example of the style. Very bitter finish thats quite surprising from this brewpub that strives for mediocrity. Drinkable but the alcohol flavor gets tuff to handle after a couple of them."
"An okay IPA. Don't go out of your way for it, but it's servicable if you're there."
"This beer pours a deep copper color with a 1"" off-white head with some real staying time. EKG and Fuggles hops come through in the nose rather prominently... more than one might expect for an English IPA, but not really on the level with your average American IPA. Citrus and floral notes come through as well as a bit of sweet, caramel. More mildly sweet malt come through in the flavor as well as the caramel and a touch of biscuit. There's a bit of citrus and floral hops in the flavor as well as a grassiness that I'm not crazy about. Mouthfeel? Medium body... a bit less than what I'd expect in an IPA. Very drinkable, though it goes down more like a pale ale than an IPA. Regardless this is a decent beer. Not very adventurous or overly exciting, but not bad either."
"Overall: The description in the Beer Menu had me looking for a Beer Engine. I actually mentioned to the woman serving that Duke of Wellington IPA on sale actually breached its cask conditioned description, maybe even legally, but I guess I laid off for fear of sounding nerdish. Anyways, this is darker than most and has a healthy malt base with a sharp tangy grapefruit and bitter pine finish. Far from a mainstream IPA, but this is pretty damned good and a very enjoyable detour from the usual IPAs about there. Probably not to everyones tastes but certainly fits in well with mine."
"This came with a foamy, medium-tan head. It had a lightly cloudy, medium-amber color. The nose had a really good hop presence. I experienced good hop bitterness on the palate and the finish had a decent commingling of hops and malt. It produced nice lacing throughout."
"Remarks: The Granite City website lists this beer as a cask-conditioned offering. Im struggling with that notion, as it was pulled through a CO2 tap, and obviously force carbonated. Nothing about the taste, texture, or carbonation of this beer suggests cask conditioning. It was also served too cold, in a chilled glass, which seems to be SOP at Granite City."
"A nice, but not too impressive IPA. There's come good late and dry hopping here. Very strong english hops aroma and flavors, enoguh to make it an American IPA. Definately EKG and fuggles, but while the aroma and flavor is nice, the malt is too weak, leaving this beer without much of a body. Still not a bad beer, reminds me of a hoppy Redhook."
"Overall I did enjoy this IPA. Not fantastic but overall a good tasting beer, but the zip at the end could be smoothed out."
"This beer is really dark when poured out. It's got a nice hop accent to it gives it character. The only think I did not like about this beer you couldn't drink a lot of them. It is extremely bitter but it gives this beer a lot of character. This beer would be excellent with spicy foods."
"Tasted On-Tap 05/11/05 at the Cedar Rapids, IA location."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability are both just plain ordinary on this non descript IPA."
"Drinkabililty: I thought this was a good IPA. A friend of mind (a strict Anheiser drinker) took a sip and remarked ""Bitter beer face!"". I guess that's when I decided this was a good beer."
"i had this beer on tap at the Cedar Rapids location. the beer was served way too cold and therefore had almost no aroma. when it warmed up after a few minutes the hoppy scent surfaced a bit. the only way i can discribe the flavor is that is tastes like a sloppy IPA. all of the expected hoppy and malty flavors of an IPA were there, but they were very disproportionate. not much of a fruit flavor that many great IPAs have. this beer is not much better than average."
"This was my second GCFB beer and I'll bet it turns out to be my favorite. Broad Axe Stout was the first, but this one was better, hands down. Once I've tried their entire lineup, I'm sure that 'the Duke' is the one that I'll order on future visits."
"overall, an average and unbalanced IPA, but tasty nonetheless. i had a few and would drink more again."
"A real nice IPA..they bill this as an English stule and in some ways it seems to be one (biscuity maltiness)..but really the nice citrus hop flavor makes this seem like a west coast IPA that borders on special but falls just a little short...definitely a solid IPA.."
"Coppery-bronze hue, it was served headless. Disappointing. Fairly aromatic nose, nicely hopped, undertones of citrusy merriment, plenty of caramel malt for support. The palate had decent bitterness, hints of caramel malt too; the finish is stronger, well-balanced even though the malt plays a secondary role. Dry. Slightly thin mouthfeel, not really a negative but a heartier body would have really propelled this IPA to the next level. This is a very respectable quaff; there is even a little tummy warming. Duke could have used a morsel more complexity but it works. Served too cold for my preference. Id drink it again."
"The Duke pours a simple copper color with little head or retention for that matter. Initial smell is of obvious hops and a bit grainy. Has a rather mild bitterness with the hops jumping on the palate towards the finish, a decent, yet not superior IPA. One of the better and more consistent Granite City brews."
"This IPA has a nice copper color and a nice bitterness to it.    It is not a kick-ass bitterness, but nothing to scoff at. I'd say that this is an average IPA that could use a little more character."
