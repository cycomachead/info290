"I've tried to love this beer for many years just because it was one of my first local beers.  I had the cask conditioned version last night at Clark's ale house and my mind hasn't changed, this is just a run of the mill IPA.  The Late Knight DIPA is amazing and I wish they would change the recipe and kick this single IPA up a bit.  There are so many good IPAs available in the CNY area now and its hard to pick this on a menu"

"O- This brew is brewed just over a half an hour away from my house and am glad it is. This is a very solid example of an English IPA and has found its way to being one of the regulars in my fridge. Pairs really good with some Cajun shrimp too!"
""
""
""
""

"O/D - A fairly drinkable IPA. The English element is hard to discern though. A solid hop flavour that wasn't overpowering but held its own."
""
""
""
""
"O-very solid beer, have only have had it a few times and seem to forget how great it is"
""
"O - I know this rating is going to be well above average, but I was super impressed. This could easily be an every-day IPA, on par with Jai Alai. Despite being labeled an English IPA, this is a very sweet, only slightly dry ale."
"Overall a perfect balance of hops to English malts. Worthy of the price."

"Overall - excellent session brew given to me by a local homebrew buddy Steve. Thanks, man!"
""
""
"Definitely worth a try if you want a break from the standard American IPA."

"O-Maybe this bottle was just old, but serves them right for not putting a date on the bottle. If I could get a fresh bottle I'd try it again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the depth of flavoring. It really followed the nose nicely, and was equally as soft and sweet, but once the liquid dropped off, you got a more intense rumble of bittering phenols, wood, and piney bite. This is surprising when it happens, but it strikes a pleasant balance to the front of the flavoring, which is relatively sweet. The feel was a bit light, but not so noticeable as to wreck your experience."
""
"An amazing offering despite the dorky label. You want citrus in your IPA? We're talking pink grapefruit, fresh perfect citrus, combined with all the bitterness you want in a well balanced IPA. I had this stocked in my kegerator for two years after I first moved back to Syracuse. The bottles report well, but a fresh draft (hard to find), tastes like a miracle considering its humble roots."
""

"Really good tasty IPA, easy to drink and a nice balance of strong hops and dry malts. Would have this again."
""
"3.0 D: About as average as it can get. Not bad with nothing standing out or disappointing."

"O-Very sold effort from one of my favorite NY breweries"
""
""
"O: Good stuff. Somewhere between an English IPA and an American Pale Ale, I'd say."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a really nice IPA that uses English style hop flavors. It is probably pretty bold and hoppy, in the mold of an American style, but the ingredients still taste English. Worth a try if that kind of thing sounds good to you."
""
"Overall- This is Middle Ages' signature brew, and showcases a lot of what makes them unique. A very solid beer, but it just doesn't tickle my palate the way some of their bolder offerings do. Itâ€™s still a great fallback when a well-rounded E-IPA is what I'm in the mood for."

"massive body, full hop flavor. pours a darker golden color with a sturdy white head. smells like more of a pale ale, with a balanced malty presence. taste is quite hoppy, but again balanced. really big body makes this one a bit filling for a session beer, and it is definitely a cold weather ipa, not magining this to be a summer drink. enjoyed this syracuse staple"
"overall- overall a good beer but i think it's more of a pale ale than a ipa, however this was the first english ipa i had so maybe thats just the style."
""

"O - Fairly enjoyable beer. I liked it more when I realized it was an English IPA and not the American one I was expecting. Solid stuff."
"O: Good IPA, not overly hopped, really hits the spot."
"Decent drinkability, but the hops are a bit one-dimensional; would like a little more complexity rather than just bitterness."
"English maltiness and American hoppiness always work out well together. If for a slightly better attenuation and less buttery notes, this could be an absolutely irresistable beer."
"A good IPA, if not an interesting one. Closer to a pilsner in feel and taste. Still, the little diacetyl adds something, if not a little strange..."
"The pour brings an orange-copper brew with a good white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings forward some slightly-earthy and floral hops along with a slight touch of diacetyl, though here it works well. Body has some semi-sweet bread and caramel plus light toffee. Some hop flavor, though that comes in more toward the finish, which has a pleasing dry bitterness. Good balance between sweet and bitter, and the yeast threw off a bit of diacetyl that was allowed to remain, but it fits well with the style. Another solid effort; I really enjoyed all of the beers I had from them."
"Clear and golden with low head retention. Aroma is caramel and earthy. Moderate carbonation and an earthy bitter middle and finish. Nice balance in the middle, not too dry, not too sweet. Medium to heavy body. A nice alternative to the West Coast IPAs."
"DO- Overall, I drank this because I like beer and I don't waste. If I had a choice this would be at the bottom of the list."
"Notes: This beer teeter totters from sweet malt to full on hop bitterness. Well done!"
"Picked this bottle up randomly at Premier Gourmet. Pours an amber-orange colour with thick white head. Lots of lacing on the glass and nice head retention. Smells of earthy hops with minerals and metal. Not too bitter in the flavour, some mild sweetness. The metallic flavour seems to linger in the aftertaste. I'm not a fan of this."
"The reveal: Middle Ages Im Paled Ale an India Pale Ale. Maybe its all the massive hop bombs I've been drinking lately, but I wouldn't put this in the IPA park. That being said it tastes like a really hoppy English bitter which I'm digging on. So, beer wise I like it, I'd just pigeon hole it in a different category."
"Thanks, sliverx, for the opportunity"
"Maybe its a bad bottle..."
"Pours a pretty orange with a good amount of head. Good lacing. Looks pretty solid. Smells... Wrong. Not much hops on the nose. Tastes old stale and not very hoppy. Directly from the brewery a few weeks ago so if it's just that its old that is 100% the breweries fault. Very disappointed in this one"
"Overall there is a slight sourness but mostly this is a well crafted and balanced traditional IPA."
"D- impaled is a stellar ipa. The crafting of this brew makes it so more unique than many other ipas out there. Highly recommended"
"D - Meh. Not a drain pour but nothing special. I don't mind drinking this one but couldn't see myself spending money for this. I am very glad to have the opportunity to try it though."
"Drink - I've been drinking a lot of IPA's lately and this one doesn't really stand out - but it's still highly drinkable and would be a good session beer. It's a great beer for fans of malty IPAs rather than hoppy ones."
"Taste is just meh. Not off putting at all, but not all that great either. Hoppy bitterness, bit of apple (maybe from the yeast,) bready malts, and a champagne like slight fruitiness. The balance is there, but the hops lack any sort of depth that is crucial in any IPA. Carbonation is a bit high, but overall mouthfeel is decent. Nothing about the actual flavors hurt the drinkability, I would just prefer to reach for a tastier offering."
"I'm actually impressed by it; I could drink several for sure. It's an IPA that might entice even the non-IPA drinker. I prefer a really hoppy IPA, and this isn't it...but this is definitely a great beer worth checking out."
"maybe this is an older bottle (based on the consensus reviews), but I can only go on what I've got here."
"Moderate pour gives a sticky cake of off-white head, a modest 1/2"" thick but with great retention that eventually settles into craters, looks like a big golf ball. Brew itself is a thin clear copper color. Smell is a blend of mildly sweet light malt, diacetyl, then mixed hop coming in third. Taste is much hoppier than the nose implied, a bitter inky generic hop takes control. Malt backbone gives it a moderate body, provides good support, but as far as taste it takes a back seat to the hop. A little candi sugar and even less diacetyl are present. The carbonation is a little heavy/ harsh, but not quite offensive, it keeps the finish clean."
"good beer, true to the english style. if your looking for tons of hops, this is not your beer."
"Good brew, follows the style nicely."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer. It was tasty and in it's own way unique. I'm glad to have tried it, but I won't deliberately trade for it again, but would pick some up if it made its way to store down here."
"The body was nice, not overly light or heavy. Drinkability was good, before my move to the Northwest this was a regular for me. Overall, a decent example of the style, worth a shot if you see it."
"Notes: Well this one is certainly not too shaby. A very tasty English I.P.A. Cheers."
"Lotsa winter sun shining through this bottle, seems a clear brew, but poured into a pint glass, just a slight haze shows in copper, SRM 14 on my Beer Color Chart here. Very teeny tiny bubbles rise all the time, more discrete than good champagne. Excellent head shrinks slowly, leaving sticky lace on glass and persistent foam on surface. Smells yeasty to me, slightly greenish hop blossomy, don't smell malt. Tastes just great, excellent simple solid-block bitter with hints of yeast and caramel, only a beer pretzel and goat cheese nearby could possibly improve this delish mouth-watering happy/hoppiness. I also enjoy IPAs with more various multi-noted hop flavor, but this huge juicy simple unified hop taste is great, too. Mouthfeel could be too carbonated if you don't pour big head, so let it splash high from your bottle pour. Long lingering oily hop aftertaste just what hopheads live for. I'll admit I'm biased toward local beers, grew up in Syracuse, live in Ithaca now so this counts as locavore politically correct ale for me and I try to keep ImPaled Ale in fridge at all times. Only 2 left? Time for another fresh 6-pack!"
"D: Somewhat tasty, goes down alright, floral notes are bit too pungent in my opinion. I could have one or two of these, but more than that would be too much."
"This tasty and insanely drinkable IPA perfectly captures the English spirit. Of the 7 or 8 Middle Ages brews I've tried, this is definitely the crown jewel."
" The bitterness factor is pretty high here and the malt delivers balance but not enough to cut through the green stuff which is pretty right-on."
"The pour delivers a nice foamy, 2 finger head, with a beautiful coppery color. It has a sweet smell, almost fruity, but you definitely smell the hops. From the first sip there is a hint of citrus, but finishes with hops. Not an overbearing hoppy taste, but just enough. I will say it is smooth on the tongue and in the mouth. Definitely a medium bodied, Well Balanced IPA. I would classify this as a middle of the road IPA, which is good and enables you to drink several in a night....glasses that is, not growlers!!"
"Overall: Bitter goodness that dares you to stop drinking it."
"Middle Ages ImPaled Ale is a slightly cloudy light amber ale with a dense, lumpy, splotchy off-white head that has excellent retention and lacing. It has a juicy, spicy, slightly sweet aroma. It almost smells like honey. It's medium bodied and maybe a touch watery, but it's smooth and the finish is dry. The flavor is well balanced between sweet and dry. It's grainy and bready, fruity and citrusy, with a sweet, spicy aftertaste. It's easy drinking."
"overall- definitely an IPA to be excited about. if you see it, be sure to try it."
"Nice beer and wishing I had another."
"Medium bodied, carbonated nicely. A fair drinker."
"Taste is a nice combination of malt sweetness, the buttery yeastines and citrus. Definitely more of the English-style than the West Coast style IPA. Its nicely balanced and slightly astringent from the hops. The finish is crisp and dry with a good amount of hop flavor coming out."
"Thanks to brothercannon for tossing me a bottle of this from his variety pack. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. The ale appears a clear pale straw color with about an inch of bone white foam. Nose and flavor are of citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, fruity, grassy hops, lightly toasted grains, and sweet malt. Medium in both body and carbonation. Worth a try if you see it around."
"Pours a very nice golden yellow/orange color, nice carbonation, nice two-finger off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, very slight hop note, slight citrus, fruity. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, some hop notes, but not much, slight citrus, with some fruit notes. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little brew."
"I enjoy drinking this since the mouthfeel makes it feel like a fresh, authentic brew. But it's not without its flaws."
"Beautiful pour from the cask, nice foamy head with some fine lacing that lasts. Aroma was the best quality, perfect for an IPA - floral, spice, fruit, hoppy. I could just stand there and smell this all day. Taste was just like the nose, with plenty of hop bitterness coming through in the finish. Lingers on the palate, very good med-thick body. Most notable of this IPA (other than the pleasant flowery aroma) is the smoothness, meaning it doesn't overwhelm the palate with hops and is very drinkable."
"Flair gets a rare pinfall win in Dallas."
"Well-balanced but style hoppy enough to fit an English-style IPA. Nice English character with an American (Cascade) hop touch in the finish. Very easy to drink!"
"D - This is a great IPA...I was hooked after the first sip...that's all I can say"
"Drinkability- Not the greatest beer I've ever had. Too much diacetyl makes for not such a good brew. You suck Adam."
"Special thanks to littlebreeze for this one!"
"The beer is quite medium bodied, decently carbonated, with a grapefruit like tangy hop presence and some tart and acerbic tastes lingering throughout. The beer is quite sweet, with florals, oily and estery hops quite noticeable, and a slightly bittering hop presence in the finish. This is a good EIPA, but it is missing the bisquity malts, the more traditional leafy and bittering hops. The citrus and grapefruity tartness just predominates too much for this to be a traditional interpretation of the style. This is more of a nouvelle IPA in all of its citrusy hop zest. The 6.5 ABV is somewhat noticeable with a slightly syrupy and oily mouthfeel and a touch of a throaty burn in the aftertaste. This is an enjoyable beer worth seeking out."
"The mouth is smooth with pleasant oiliness but thins in the end. Easy enough drinker but the sourness limits me to 2 or 3."
"D: A nicely balanced IPA, and one that I will certainly look forward to picking up again when in the area. Not out the roof with alcohol, and nice and smooth drinking."
"Drinkability: Would definatly have a few more of these. Taste is good, looks great and even though the flavor doesn't go above and beyond, I would definately seek this out again."
"It was a pretty good IPA. Sometimes it got a little too citrusy for me, but I did like the level of bitterness this IPA contained. Since it's an affordable beer, I could see this as a session IPA."
"This beer poured a golden/orange color with a thick, retentive head - tight bubbles. The hop aroma is present initially but then it fades quickly to a sweet malty smell. The taste is bitter in the beginning, yielding to a sweet malt flavor. This finish is bitter. It is kind of an interesting roller coaster effect with the flavors. The mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied and quite carbonated. This is a well rounded beer that definitely deserves a try."
"Don't think I need to have another."
"D_Pretty good EIPA, fairly drinkable but nothing spectacular. It doesnt help that I had a Belhaven Twisted thistle beforehand. Still this is a well made brew."
"I could take this or leave it, it's just so dry and so bitter on the finish. The hop flavor isn't all that interesting"
"Pours a clear amber color with 2 fingers of frothy off-white head and good retention and lacing. Smells of floral hops, a touch of pine and citrus, honey, bread, and butter. Tastes of lemon, apricot, and tangerine up front are quickly overpowered by a caramel and bread backbone. The backbone lasts a good while before any signs of IPA resurface with a hint of peppery and floral hops and notes of butter to finish out the flavors. Medium in body with great carbonation. Some hop presence but mainly malty with most of the bitterness seeming to not come from the hops. Not really my kind of IPA."
"The carbonation seems to be at the perfect level and offers some saving grace for the mouthfeel, but there is a somewhat thin finish. Fair drinkability aided by the fact that it isn't a hop bomb attempting to overwhelm, but offers a firm hop presence."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is the type of beer that blurs the boundary between the English and American IPA styles, it's a good flavorful beer with some substance that is worth drinking a few of."
"D- Very drinkable with a great aftertaste. this one is definitely something i could have a couple or more of in a sitting. too bad it isnt available in my area."
"Definitely recommended..."
"D - Not bad, but the balance seems a bit off for me. Could use more hop flavour and less bitterness."
"Overall I think this worth a shot. I have been drinking a lot of real hoppy west coast beers lately and I think this was a decent change of pace."
"Notes: I would love this on tap I think. EIPA's aren't my usual go to, but this isn't bad at all."
"A good counterpoint of sweet & bitter is the big accomplishment I found in this IPA. Just when the sweetness seemed overstated, the bitterness kicked in. Every sip brought similar interplay. Good job Middle Ages."
"Not a bad beer but I like my IPA's with some more kick as in hops to them."
"ImPaled Ale is one of the best IPA's that I have tasted in quite some time. Middle Ages Brewing Company certainly have crafted a winner with this offering and beer drinkers can rest assured that this drinking this beer will be far more enjoyable than actually being impaled."
"This beer poured a copper color with a thin head. The smell is is very sweet malt with some honey and floral accents. The taste starts off right away with some hops bite that continues all the way through and give away to some sweetness at the end. The mouthfeel is a bit thick in a pleasant way and for a vigorously hopped beer it is very palatable."
"Overall: I am a hop lover this one does not fit that bill. It is a nice smooth easy drinking IPA, that can be enjoyed by the gateway drinkers."
"D - I was very disappointed with this brew it goes with the saying just because its a micro doesn't make it automatically good it looks and smells ok but the taste was off"
"Pours a very slightly hazed amber with a light tan head that really sticks around. I cannot remember the last time I saw this much retention of head, so I am going to give this one a 5 on appearance. Nose is very hoppy with those pine and citrus tones. The flavor is subdued and doesn't present itself as a hop bomb or that style. It is more of a gentle hopped ale. Feel is thick with bubbles and slightly meaty on the liquid. Definitely drinkable. It is a smooth and even IPA that doesn't have any overly showy attributes. I would be interested to see what this one is like on tap...or better yet on cask."
"D: Good for the style. Refreshing. Not for sessioning as the hop taste is overpowering."
" This is an all day IPA which is very friendly to the palate. Worth the drive ( an hour and 1/2 ) to Halftime Beverage in Poughkeepsie."
"A clear amber colored brew with a solid, clumpy white head and good lacing. The aroma has a healthy grapefruit mixed with some unique bubblegum/candy quality, interesting and enticing. The taste brings out more toffee and some licorice along with the clean citrus presence, all in a very creamy delectable package. Nice combination of sweet and bitter, with a malty background. I pick up some bread and perhaps currant in the aftertaste. Very nice stuff, recommended to most anyone. Pretty drinkable for this kind of brew, as well. It's good to be back in the Middle Ages for once!"
"The taste lingered long and confortably in my mouth with little carbonation making the drinking just a little more easier. Despite being reasonably complex and high in alcohol, it was very drinkable and did not make me feel weighed down after it."
"Good well balanced IPA. No one flavor is too overpowering. Definatly near the top of my list of IPAs."
"This is no knock your socks off IPA, but then again it's an English style and not an American. It's an excellent IPA, though, and a very drinkable one."
"Just finished a couple of these while watching some baseball. Pours a nice copper color with some orange hues and a thick white head. Smell is hoppy with some fruit notes. Excellent mouthfeel. Taste is sweet at first then the hops kick in. Also some fruitiness. I would def take a few more of these down if not for work tomorrow. A pretty damn solid IPA."
"Pretty solid English-style IPA. I really enjoyed this beer. Drinkability is high because it goes down so smooth."
"This IPA, with a brownish, orange color, was on the sweeter side of life for my taste buds. The hops were quite herbal and piney and this combined with the sweetness came out in a kind of pine fresh theme. There wasn't much depth to the the mouthfeel as I found the beer to be somewhat watery, but still a decent brew worth trying."
"Pours a solid, clear amber color with a nice head that resists fading. Not a heck of a lot of lacing. The smell is nice but you've really got to let it warm up quite a bit to get its best. The aroma is fruity and grassy pine. Medium bodied and adequately carbonated, the mouth feel and flavor compliment each other well. The light fruity hop is balanced with a sweet malt flavor that that lets you know it's there. The hop bitterness lingers appropriately. The 6.5% ABV is well hidden; a good drinker and a local favorite."
"Cheers!"
"This beer goes down smoothly and I could definitely have more than one. This is a nice reminder that I need to drink more English-style beers. It should also be noted that this beer seems to get more pleasant as it warms. Definitely a tasty treat and I would drink it more often were it available in this area."
"D - It was a bit hoppy for me."
"D - 6.5% abv brew, has good drinkability, 3 or 4 of these over a few hours is just fine by me."
"The IPA market is flooded,but Impaled Ale keeps its head way above water and satisfies in every way. Great beer from a great brewery."
"Pretty good all around."
"D-overall, i didn't love this one so the D is down for me."
"This poured with a decent, off-white head with good retention. The color was a hazy medium-amber. It had a good floral, hoppy nose. The mouthfeel was medium with a good hoppy presence on the palate. The finish was also hoppy, but offset by a mild malt presence."
"Smooth mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Finishes somewhat dry. Good sipper, pretty sessionable."
"The feel is smooth, although maybe a little ashy at the tail end. Considering how bitter this baby can get, it's actually remarkably smooth. It's one of my favorite IPA's, delicious and smooth. An outstanding, full brew."
"By far one of my favorite local IPA's, but once again, I'm biased. This is another beer that I've always seen on tap in the front room at the brewery and for good reason. Everytime I visit I make sure to get a sample of this delicious brew. Pours a light orange color with a nice foamy head. Smell is quite citrusy with some piney scent. Hops are obviously present with a pleasant malt background. Good work Middle Ages, keep it up."
"Drinkability- Overall a very good beer in a category with lots of other good or better beers. Definitely a respectable offering for the style."
"Great looking IPA with a monstrous head and lacing lasts till the end. Citrusy hop aromas dominate along with a bready malt. Taste in no different; clean crisp hops smack the palate with a nice heavy malt backbone, while the beer stays on the light mouthfeel-wise. Hop profile makes this one a contender for champion of IPA trophy in my opinion."
"D - This is by no means an English IPA. Far too much grapefruit, but it does have a lot of nice malt."
"pretty average"
"OK, pretty good IPA and quite sessionable. Not sure if individual scents/flavors are too mild to pick out, or if it is just very well integrated. Despite lowish score, I would drink it again, just don't think it matches up well against some of the other IPAs out there."
"Overall, I dig it. Not my favorite beer, but a good introduction to IPA's for me. I wanna try more after this."
"D- Nice session beer, but getting towards the strong side to be ripping a bunch down and driving around. I fill my growler, drive home, then drink it."
"12 oz single bottle, purchased unrefrigerated from Charles Street Liquors in Boston. No production/freshness date evident - so I'm a bit concerned it's not at peak condition. Pours a copper, with lots of head - but perhaps not the best pour on my part. Somewhat of a malty aroma. The taste hits me at the back of my mouth, but doesn't seem to fill the rest of the mouth enough. Some hops, but not enough interesting about this one."
"I love Middle AgeÂ’s marketing scheme but I'm disappointed with the mediocre tastes in so many of their offerings. This is another underachieving beer. It has a great deal of potential but the taste is forgettable."
"Had from a cask at Mahar's in Albany. The beer was clear golden orange color with thick and sticky head. The smell was dominated by fruity aromas with some strong hops presence. Same with the taste, both aroma and flavor were solidly above average. The mouthfeel and drinkability were much higher than average, mostly due to the creamy and thick mouthfeel from the cask. A nice solid English style IPA."
"D- middle ages makes some incredible brews, i feel this one is too mainstream for them. i guess if you like average / mainstream versions of a style this is an ok beer."
"Overall a nice ale. A hoppy, but good example of the English IPA style."
"D - as a result the drinkability is high, an easy IPA to pound"
"MD. I was pretty harsh on this beer. I am stuggling to make it through the sixer, maybe I'll hand it off as a gift. Clever name, the brewery should do this to this beer."
"CRUX: NOT THE BEST BEER FROM A GREAT BREWERY. I'll keep drinking their ""Druid Fluid," though."
"On cask at Pizza Plant Walker Center in Williamsville. Golden amber with slow and slight but steady rising carbonation and a slightly grey dirty-dishwater head. Very English floral hop aroma, Fuggles probably, and a quite expected buttery scent, too. Mild soapy scent at the end. Reminds me of their 10th Anniversary Ale, except tamed down (duh). Bitter soapy floral hop flavors predominate the first sip with a distinctly mineral finish. Subsequently, a toasted biscuit malt shows, but the flowery English hops are all over this one. A peachy fruitiness emerges, along with a subtle butterscotch flavor, around mid-glass. Medium body and smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Despite slightly high abv, this strikes me as eminently sessionable, so long as one is in the mood for a bit of diacetyl -- and I think that Middle Ages uses that characteristic quite to their advantage, despite the dislike some may have for a ""buttery"" flavor in their beer. I'm far from an expert, but from what I know, ImPaled Ale seems pretty on-point for this style. Nice EIPA."
"Very drinkable, must get more."
"D - A bit high to session (6.5% ABV), I can never drink as many as I want. Damn."
"The distinctive flavor imparted by the Ringwood yeast makes this one of my favorite brews of all time. (Some love it, some hate it, but it works for me.) Many varieties of IPA were tried before we chose this one as our house beer, and among the 18 taps at our bar, it remains one of our biggest movers. Great aroma, some citrus, some floral, full mouthfeel and good duration on the aftertaste, but not adhesive. This is a beer that is perfectly suited for quaffing or sipping, and after skiing or after golf."
"Lovely orange-amber with white head. Very good lacing and head retention. A very nicely balanced EIPA. Fruity aroma with citrus and a touch of hops. Taste has a bit much diacetyl, a smaller amount would be ideal. Ringwood does a nice job with this beer though, esters and hops compliment the malts. Very drinkable and feels nice. A very unique IPA, everyone should try this once!"
"An IPA that's loaded with taste yet mellow at the same time. British."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thick and seems to coat my mouth. Well balanced with the hops taking over at the end. Sweet citrus, malt and grassy hops. I believe they are a Ringwood brewery and they do a good job with this one. Very smooth yet full of flavor. Whatever hop varietal this is, it is one of my favorites. Grassy and citrusy."
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks dmeadows and OneBoxBIF!"
"Drinkability: Very, very drinkable. you could easily chug this, although yould be missing out."
"Not as malty as I would expect from an English IPA."
"I think this is an easily quaffable beer. Worthy of regular drinking. This would likely make my top ten if they generously dry-hopped the batch for a better bouquet."
"poured a medium copper color with magnificient puffy white head that fell to a nice coating that responded to slight swirling. Noce coating on the side of the glass. Smell is slightly hoppy with delicate sweet aromas of fruit coming. Excellent balance of malt and hops. Taste is initially strong on hops, then some of the sweet caramel maltiness begins to present itself, and finally hops seem to again predominate. A deliciously complex ale. Finish is bitter, yet a bit of malt sweetness also comes through. This was absolutely superb beer from start to finish. Ver easy to drink at 6.5% alcohol. This is my second beer from Middle Ages and I'm really impressed by their products."
"The hop character also manifests itself in a dry pine-like character that has hints of menthol around the edges. The bitterness is nice and solid, it in fact grabs hold of my taste buds and shakes them furiously until they tingle. Now I could certainly do without the diacetyl in this beer, but it is not so overpowering that I am not enjoying this beer."
"Not an over the top IPA, but good none the less."
"12 ounce bottle. This beer pours out a light brown color with a large white head. The aroma is caramel, fruit, and hops. Nice malty caramel flavor with lots of fruitiness, like tangerines and grapefruit. A little buttery. Hops come in almost immediately, and are very flavorfull, though not very bitter. Mouthfeel is medium. This beer has an addictive flavor that makes it very drinkable. This is a very good change of pace IPA."
"A very enjoyable English IPA which I'd be quite willing to have again."
"Amber in color. A bit hazy. White head dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves nice white cover behind. Aroma and taste are buttery with pronounced, but not strong floral hops. Medium body, quite sweet and smooth. Slightly bitter aftertaste. From what I am reading, it is a good representation of English style IPAs. Quite different from American IPAs. I would prefer less sweetness, more hops. I probably won't seek out this beer in a store, but if I ever see it on tap I'll be sure to try it."
"Golden haziness, just short of copper-colored. Thin but persistent head. Aroma smacks of butterscoth and lavender. Buttery diacetyl up front is quelled by a significant hop addition that lends a quite spicy (think white pepper) and floral (rose, lavender, and clover honey) characteristic. Any less hopping and this becomes a buttery mess. As it is, a bit too diacetyl-tinged for my taste, but a good job using this yeast. This is also much better on draft, IMO."
"Drinkability is ok but I'm not a huge fan of this. I can definitley pick this out as being a Middle Ages brew. I'm not sure if that's a good thing though as I haven't been won over by any of their beers yet."
"Clear, light amber colour topped by a fluffy, eggshell-coloured head. Nice lacing and great retention. Clean hoppy aroma, citrus, floral and a little grassy. Moderate bitterness, malt is much more forward and contributes some bready sweetness. Light fruity esters and medium hop character. The short finish is balanced and slightly drying. Medium body, medium/low carbonation, smooth and not quite slick texture. Easy drinking, tasty, and well balanced."
"These guys make some solid brews...a visit is in order."
"Beautiful frothy rocky dense head above a copper body. Metallic and buttery aroma with a rich earthy hoppage that makes my mouth water. A harsh dirty bitterness quickly dominates a brew that starts with nice toasty sweetness. Medium body, low carbonation, leafy hop flavor keeps slick feel from being bad. Finish is harsh and annoying, which is a damn shame considering how great this is otherwise."
"Ah, this is supposed to be an English IPA. That means it utterly fails because the hops are deliciously American. A hybrid if you will. And a good example of one."
"Pours a bubbly light head that dissapates to a thin film halfway throught the pint. Aroma is sharp with hints of grapefruit and pine - hints of alcohol towards the end, also. Appearance is a light amber - lighter than what I'd expect of most IPAs. Mouthfeel is medium. Strong hop taste is unmistakable. Good to average IPA. Nothing spectacular - similar to Saranac IPA - but more expensive."
"Thanks to francisweizen for this one. Poured a 1/2 finger light cream-colored head over a cloudy straw-golden liquid. Smelled of citrus pine-solishness (with tangerine and nectarine qualities). Way beneath are apricots and pear esters. Tasted flat hop flavor with a late malt accompanied by hop bitter. Not much at the start of the sip, but then a hop bitter and grapefruit slowly arose. Gosh, I'm so used to hop bomb explosions that this is a nice change of pace. This is, in some hoppy flavors, similar to Philadelphia IPA, but toned down a bit. Apricot and other light fruits appear once the beer is fully in the mouth. And then thehops come in, but never reach an overbearing stage. They eventually fade to leave a ptihy grapefruit in the back of the mouth that slowly rolls forward. It's a bitter unpleasant taste, but following its progress is interesting. Also at the end of the swallow, from the malt, is a pear character that helps to keep the pith flavor from killing the beer. Md-liht body that dissapates quickly once down the throat. Acceptable, but not one I will purposefully seek out in the future."
"Had this on tap at Donnely's Public house in fairport. When I got it the head was gone and it was a nice golden-orange color. The floral hop aroma kinda lightly hits ya in the face, but more so in the taste department. I love how the hops smack ya at first sip. The experience is overall well balanced though, with the nice malt flavor. The mouthfeel is medium and tingly from the carbonation. Not as fruity as i would have expected (everything i have had by middle ages has been fruity) but still a pretty cool brew. I would probably only drink 1 though, not the most drinkable."
"If you look at my other reviews for this brew, bottle and on-tap, I really wanted to try it on cask. Well I got my wish and was able to try it the other night. It poured to a orange color with a thick off white head that had nice retention while leaving thick chunks of froth at the top of the brew and rings through out the rest. Very nice looking brew! The aroma from this brew is excellent, dominated by a citrus like hop aroma while still having solid malt characteristics. The taste is really good, great malt like characteristics that quickly break to a dominant hop taste that highlights a grapefruit like essence. I must really say that I am not sure what the reason is but my ratings for this brew just seem to be going up and up. Not sure if it is a change with my tastes or the serving type but this was the best experience I have had with this IPA. If you can try it on cask, really good IMO!"
"ImPaled Ale is a wonderful IPA and is one of Middle Ages's best brews. I could just as easily have granted the next highest score for taste, it's that good. I'd drink a lot of this if I had ready access. Thanks to HappyHourHero for the bottle."
"Thanks to Shippos for sending this one along to me. Pours a light amber color with a small head that dies off quickly, but leaves a little lacing around on the glass. The aroma is very buttery, but I like it a lot. Some caramel malts and nice aroma from the yeast. Not much hops in the nose. The flavor is enjoyable as well. The yeast gives it a slightly spicy character that blends smoothly with the malt character. Drinkability is good and the mouthfeel is right where it should be."
"This beer comes to me from shippos and clvand0. Thanks guys. It pours a coppered gold color with a small head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is really heavy in caramel and buttery diacetyl, with a background spicey hop as well. The flavor is nice, with the spicey hop upfront, moving to a buttery caramel with a residual bitter. Good show. The feel is moderate with a good carb. Middle Ages has done well with this English pale ale. I really like the residual bitter after the swallow."
"Review is from notes on 1/21/05. Pours out a hazy orange with about a half inch of white fluffy head. Head stays a bit leaving scant lacing. Light citric scents mingle with an off funkiness, ringwood I am thinking. Besides that the malts donÂ’t seem up to much more than a light sweetness. Flavor starts off with a bitter citric hop bite over a malty caramel backbone. A bit of odd flavors are present but donÂ’t detract too much from the brew. Finishes with a bitter citric hoppiness. Mouthfeel was about medium with a light crispness to it. Ok drinkability here but overall this was not really my cup of tea. Thanks for the bottles Slander."
"The beer pours a golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a wonderful malt scent that boasts of pale and light crystal malts. It has a nice fruity Ringwood yeast aroma, but not much in the hops department. The taste is good. It has a smooth and balanced flavor that boasts of pale and light crystal malts as well as Ringwood yeast and a bitter hop aftertaste. It isn't as heavy in hops as some IPA's , but it drinks great. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a decent IPA. It should have a little more hop aroma and taste, but it drinks well."
"Drinkability is OK. Ringwood is not my favorite yeast t all. Too much fruitiness tends to shine through if the right malts are not used. This one is a bit unbalanced to me."
"deep golden with a nice white lacy head. This stuff was a winnner when I sniffed the empty bottle after pouring. This has a nice fruity citrus nose. The taste confirms the aroma. This starts light and wham, you're hit with a barrage of well blended citrus and mild fruit, evenly checked by bitterness which eventually takes over the experience in the finish. THe finish is long and pleasantly bitter."
"Dark tangerine amber, with a modest quarter-inch head of white foam that lasts and leaves spotty lacing on my Sam Smiths glass. Carbonation is lively and moderate, the head is rocky, and interesting. Aromas are very fruity with a nod toward citrus fruits, tangerines, and the like. The ringwood yeast fruitiness is in full effect in this one, yet the hops (citrusy) are also in the aroma as well. This one seems much better in the bottle so far than the Syracuse Pale Ale. The flavor of this beer is good, but it is not as hoppy, notr as fruity and buttery as it is on cask, man Middle ages brews are really much better on cask, aren't they!? Mouthfeel is medium bodied and right for the style. Drinkability is good. This is a damn fine IPA, but it really shines on cask (and to a lesser extent, tap)"
"Was much better on cask at the Cask House in Syracuse than on-tap at the brewery. Good IPA, dry and bitter. Grapefruit aroma and taste. Lots and lots of Cascade and centenial hops. An IPA with attitude. Also was soapy at Pizza Plant on cask two years later, fruity but astringent bitter."
"A bright orange light amber colored ale with a big foamy of white head that leaves some lace. Good floral hop boquet with a hint of butterscotch in the background. There is a bitter hop sharpness a the start that just kind of fades away. There is no real character to the hops in this IPA."
"Pours a two-fingered cream head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Hoppy nose with hints of apricot. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Starts hoppy with some sweetness; finish does not have the intense hoppiness of some IPA's like Dogfish's 60 minute. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Hoosick Street Discount Bev. Troy, NY."
"sampled a 12 ouncer, without any freshness dating to be found. Pours basic almond,lifting an off white head with good retention that clings to the glass and leaves nicely developed lacing. Grainy hop nose. This is an aggressively hopped ale. Boldy crafted of a nice bready malt base and a nice blast of citric, grainy and pine sap hops. Pleasant and satisfying IPA. Worth seeking out."
"Nice, clear copper body is topped off by an ample, but not too big, head. Very floral hops in the nose, a bit of citrus, but really more like a rose garden. ThereÂ’s also a bit of butter mixed in with that. The malt profile has a nice bit of caramel. Actually with the malt profile and the butter, this really comes across as a very British IPA, except for the fact itÂ’s a good bit hoppier than the typical modern Brit IPA."
"Poured in an imperial pint glass, forms a 1"" off-white head, which laces well. An amber hued brew with a tinge of orange, with a slightly buttery yeast aroma, with minimal hops apparent, as is often to be expected for the EIPA. Taste is hoppier than the nose indicated, and the malt and slight buttery flavors round out the sharp hops edges. Mouthfeel and drinkability both good, although the butteriness could get old after a few. I think it's worth the risk."
"Very easy drinking English IPA, nothing especially exciting, but still good."
"Beer was easy to drink, aided by prodigous carbonation. Decent mouth-feel as well, overall a good, if not memorable, beer."
"Smooth, creamy and full bodied. Very nice, easy to drink."
"The fine beer was definitely NOT what I was looking for when I picked-up a six pack of this India Pale Ale. This is a really good Ale, but is it an India Pale Ale? I'll leave the answer to that question for others. The beer pours a rather dark amber/copper color. A monster head forms and stays for the duration. Smell is a mixture of malt and hints of hops. Taste is some what thick: strong malty caramel with only a faint hint of hops. I was reminded of dead Guy Ale by rogue or even Arrogant Bastrard. No bittering from the hops. Perhaps my beer was old? But how is one to know with no freshness date on the bottle. This is a really fine tasting ""ALE"" but not what you are looking for if you want something in the realm of HopDevil, SNPA, or Stone IPA. This said...this is a damn fine tasting beer!!! Try some with out preconceived expectations. Enjoy>"
"Hazy apricot color with a big airy pale white head. The nose has some sweetness with hints of orange rind and hop flowers. The taste starts with flat sweetish malt and a slight metalic taste on the tongue. Then the brew bitters with orange rind and dry juniper berries. Quite light and thin on the mouth. It is ok... but not a thriller in a very competitive USA IPA style."
"Overall, a decent IPA. Thanks to OldFrothingSlosh for the bottle!"
"A great beer by Middle Ages."
"This really is a unique IPA. The yeasty flavors of this ale are overpowering. YouÂ’ll either love it or hate it, but I enjoyed drinking it. This vintage tasted exactly the same as the one I had two years ago."
"Thanks WesWes!"
"Hmm, the ringwood yeast is very apparent. When I popped the cap and poured, I immediately thought: this is like a Maine beer. Anyway, the pour is a dark hazy golden, the generous head has faded, but there's still a bit floating on the 1/3 left in my glass. Faint piney smell with a dollop of syrup when taking a whiff. While tasting, I note that there's decent carbonation, a sturdy medium malt body followed by a pine hop finish. Aftertaste is a bit buttery. Not bad by any means, but I think I like the style better with out the Ringwood and butter. Thanks to Sponberg for the bottle!"
"Appearance: Light caramel amber orange tone with a creamy textured caramel hued head nice. Aroma: Citrus hop profile with slight woody tones some caramel malt patches nice English style IPA. Taste: Great mix of citrus hops with butterscotch and caramel highlights from the malt profile finishes with a touch alcohol in the flavor. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied slight even carbonation smooth as all hell, nice brew. Drinkability: The balance makes this a perfect candidate for a session brew, the citrus hop profile is a awesome match with the butterscotch and caramel malts. Last time I had this one it was definitely past it's best by date, a different beer this time no diacetyl."
"An enjoyable offering from the folks at Middle Ages. Pours a orangey color with a tight white head. Hop aroma is strong with little to no malt aroma. Taste is fruity with the hops coming on at the end to dry the finish. Pairs nicely with spicy and BBQ foods."
"The appearance of this beer is nothing special. Crystal clear orange amber, some good foamy head, a bit of lace. The smell presented me with a bit of a problem, as I could not pinpoint what I smelled. There are definate toasted, buttery malts (apparently from the ringwood yeast), but there is a sweetness, almost like rolled oats , and maybe even pine sawdust (probably from the hops). The first taste is a hit of hops at the back of the mouth, with the sweet buttery malts on the front of the tongue. A burnt piny, citrus rind flavor covers the whole tongue lightly. Smooth carbonated mouthfeel, with the smoothness at the front of the tongue, and a sharp hopbite on the back. This beer would improve quite a bit if it was allowed to age and mellow a bit."
"The hops were nice and pronounced in this IPA, and the malt levels were also good. Some fruitiness was detected. The bitterness lingers on the tongue for a bit. Some dryness also detected. A nice beer, but a little sweeter than expected, so drinkablility is lowered a bit for me."
"Pours clear medium amber, medium creamy tan head that somewhat lasts and laces in sheets. Aroma is loaded with butterscotch, backed with quite a bit of hops. Flavor is dominated by an overpowering amount of butterscotch, with a slight fruitiness and a decent amount of hops to finish. Medium in body. The over the top butterscotch kinda kills this one for me."
"Poured a burned copper color witha thick, thick layer of white head that leaves distinct rings on the glass. Aromas are nice: zesty, fruity, spicy notes. Nothing too over-the-top, but it's there. Flavor reminds me initially of an ESB, quite bitter. But it smooths out nicely. A nice dash of honey flavor also noted, which was unexpected and appreciated. Finishes dry and bitter. Thick mouthfeel, medium-bodied. Crisp and bitter aftertaste. Nothing too lingering on the palate. Very drinkable. Quite glad I was able to sneak up to Binghamton while visiting the in-laws in NEPA to get some Middle Ages beers."
"Gorgeous, clear dark amber set off by a creamy thick off-white head. Nice, tangy aroma with distinct hops and an undercurrent of some spice. I can't place it. Let's try the taste. No, it's not coming through enough; the hops are lighter in the taste than I expected, and they fade rather quickly towards a final touch of bitterness. Now, in the second taste there is a stronger suggestion of the yeastier after-effect of the British leaning American IPAs; like the Shipyard Fuggles, the smooth, caromel flavoring is evident. The mouthfeel a tad thin, but overall this is a worthy and drinkable ale."
"Great IPA, has the real hop opening you would expect with a good IPA. Floral and twangy to start but a big malt kicks in to really balance this beer. It has a real full mouthfeel and a nice aftertase of hops and a buttery finish. I like this beer and will get more of this one."
"A murky orange to amber color crowned with a humongous light tan head that is semi-creamy in consistency, the lace a fine veil to hide the glass. Hop floral nose, citrus like crispness, and all fresh and clean with the start somewhat sweet and nice malt profile, top is middling in feel. Big hop finish, spicy and potent with a moderate acidity, very dry and slightly bitter aftertaste, another darn good beer from a great brewery."
"Poured into a no-nick Middle Ages pint glass, and a white bubbly head formed. The copper liquid is quite transparent with a few bubbles still making their way to the surface. It has a mellow hoppy smell mixed with a light buterscotch scent that carrys over into the taste. The hops aren't overpowering like some IPA's, and they leave just a slightly bitter after taste. I'm a big fan of IPA's and I'd have to say this one has a character all its own, as do most of the Middle Ages brews. Give it a try, if you don't fall in love, its interesting at the least."
"Still, at 20 bucks a case in parts of upstate NY, it's hard to say no to this when you're not sure what to get at the beer store."
"Somewhat medium bodied, creamy and on the border of being chewy. Some fresh fruit flavoring hits home as well. Tender bitterness, but oh so tasty. GET SOME!"
"Flavor is initially malty, with the hops exploding a second after you sip. Very well balanced, with a slight leaning towards the hops. Smooth drinking, with mild carbonation. Definitely in the english style. i was expecting a much more citric, acidic hoppiness, but this is definitely more up my alley."
"I remember having this on tap at the Blue Tusk in Syracuse last May, and this bottle picked up where that pint left off. Pours a nice copper with a medium-sized vanilla ice cream-colored head. Smell is a unique bitter toffee scent. Taste: interesting. Buttery toffee malts--a little sweet--balanced nicely by an ""impaled"" bitter hop finish. Different than most West Coast IPAs that I've had. I really like this version though."
"I've been going through an IPA stage lately, and ImPaled Ale and Brooklyn IPA are my favorites so far in this style."
"Tastes of bitter hops and malt. Finishes dry and bitter. Goes down smooth and easy. Very drinkable. A good hoppy IPA, but not over the top."
"Loving the name of this beer.This is the second offering from Middle Ages I have tried and is a decent and quite tasty offering. It poured a light orange/ochre color with a decent off-white head that slipped away rather quickly leaving some bubbles and a decent ring of lace around the rim of my glass. The smell was not satisfactory. It contained no real aromas save a kinda bland beery malt smell and a little alcohol coupled with a antiseptic, soap like aroma.. The taste was far better than the smell led on with some zesty hop bitterness couched nicely by coppery malts. Not overly bitter, but definitely reminded me a little of bitter cold coffee. Still a little pine like medicianl notes emerging. The mouthfeel was thin and crisp, but nothing extraordinary. Overall this is a decent IPA, but it needs to shape up and become a fuller, richer beer for me to try it again."
"This was a very good IPA, but the aroma wasn't overly impressive."
"Overall a decent beer...I have had better...and this brewery puts out a few others I prefer more..."
"It's okay. Personally, when an IPA ain't stellar, it AIN'T stellar. Naw mean?"
"Overall, a tasty beer, but neither the best IPA nor the best Middle Ages brew."
"The body is fair, as is the carbonation. Overall a decent IPA. Thanks again to stegmakk for the mixed sampler of Middle Ages."
"Quite botanical. Layered and laid-back. A stark juxtapostion to its menacing name."
"Pours an orange copper color with a creamy white head that quickly fades into a very sticky thin lace. Nose is sweet fruity malts, buttery yeasts, and floral hops. Medium in body and a bit chewy in texture. Taste has a good amount of bitterness throughout with notes of pine oil and grapefruit rind while at the same time there is a nice malt backbone to balance the bitterness. A very nice IPA. Thanks to Denali and stegmakk for the sample!"
"While English ale is my favorite, I'm also a hop head. This IPA falls in to the medium category as far as hoppiness goes but it sure bowled me over. Outstanding head retention sat upon a medium amber body, lacing was copious. Aroma was tremendous with notes of roasted malt and citrus. Taste was not over the top hopped, and had a nice malty base and as I said before a slight roastiness. Top notch drinkabilty from this east coat IPA, thanks McCall for this fine IPA."
"Tried this while in Buffalo,liked the label.Unfiltered orange color with pretty good frothy head.Typical citruis hop aroma maybe a little grass,pretty sweet and balanced for a IPA.Very drinkable,I have gotten a few MA beers and liked them all will get more next month when Iam in Buffalo again."
"Caramel-amber color. Moderate head that quickly dissolved into patchwork lace. Smooth and very much English-influenced in the good balance of malt and solid hopping, with just a touch of floral in the hops to lend some American innovation (or maybe I'm getting a hint in the Ringwood yeast?). Malt is very fresh tasting. Not a stand-out IPA, but quite pleasant."
"This is very well balanced, it's easy to drink but at the same time has a bold although not over-the-top hops bite."
"Vlad would have likely thrown back a few of these tasty copper-hued brews amidst the wails of his ill-fated victims. Big aroma of toast triangles beneath a bouquet of daisies and lemon pith. Layers of bitterness sit on top a smooth malt floor. Quite poundable, no doubt, just don't get lost in the moment and sit on the empty bottles for authenticity."
"476"
"7% ABV. Pours a hazy, orange-tinted copper body that's topped by a frothy bone-white cap. The head holds well and leaves some fairly nice lace throughout the glass. The nose expresses a distinct note of buttery diacetyl that blends nicely with some apricot-like fruitiness and a soft & sweet floral hoppiness. It's very nice, and in fact, I think all of the Middle Ages beers prove that the Ringwood yeast strain can produce some excellent character. The body is medium, but its very fine carbonation is creamy in the mouth and gives the impression of a bigger body. The flavor starts hoppy and finishes hoppy! There's a nice jolt of fruitiness up-front, followed by some soft malt before finishing with a flourish of hop bitterness that leads into a long dry finish accented by lightly earthy and floral hops. Eventually a mild touch of buttery diacetyl also reappears. It's well balanced with a solid bitterness, but it never overwhelms the palate. It expresses much more character as it warms and that's attested to by the fact that it took a Silver medal at the 1998 Real Ale Festival in Chicago! Very nicely done, and well worth trying."
"This beer pours a nice clear light copper color with a massive off-white head. The aroma is dominated by citrusy hops and has a light caramel that is barely noticeable in the background. Again repeated in the taste are the pungent citrus flavored hops, with a light sweet fruit, caramel, and roasted malts all lingering in the background. The creamy mouthfeel is something I havenÂ’t experienced in most IPAÂ’s, but is quite welcomed! Perhaps just slightly underhopped for an IPA, but it doesn't hurt this brew IMHO. This is a very impressive and fairly complex brew! Sent to me by a mystery BA (I will edit this when I find out who)Â…thanks! Cheers!"
"Thank you Davo for this IPA."
"This beer poured a copper gold color and formed a nice bubbly white head that left some circular lace. There was a medium amount of carbonation present. The aroma was heavily hoppy, with traces of citrus. The flavor also was very hoppy with some grain elements present. The finish was a bit bitter, but not bad. A nice stab by an American company at an English style IPA."
"Notes: Well crafted and well balanced ... maybe a little too fruity but what do you expect for the Ringwood yeast strain. One of the top IPAs in the US ... this is the real stuff."
"Really nice on tap, review based on the bottle...very agressively hopped but more under control than some North American IPAs, this may be one of the most drinkable I've had...outstanding grapefruit (sort of a mild ""pink""?) without being unidimensional...smell is nice as well..."
"Nice frothy white head that sticks around for a while. Pretty malty all around, with tasty bread and husky grain flavors following a fruity nose. Hops are big and give a very firm bitterness throughout; hop flavors are slightly vegetal and citric in the finish. Very well balanced- its a middle of the road style IPA that works pretty well."
"Another excellent IPA. So fresh tasting on cask. Obviously dry hopped directly in the cask."
