Flavor is hoppy, somewhat bitter, rather fruity and just a bit syrupy, quite different from most IPAs I have sampled - this is almost like a blend of an IPA and a cider.

Light amber colored beer is still, and the short white head doesn't last very long. Malt dominated flavor is a mix of biscuit malt and caramel. Finishes quite bitter.

This beer is crisp and clean, but the hop structure is (by American standards) remarkably weak, and by English standards, on the light end. The pungent hop oils are there, but the body is again too light to allow the malt structure to really grab and render flavors beyond the corn and grains that I taste. A bit calcic and the finish is kind of awkward. A bit more sweetness would really round this beer out better.","TLove","0"

3.23,-4.2,3.5,3,3,4,3.5,"I have seen St. Peter's beers around for a while but have never taken the plunge. The bottle is a unique shape and it is not brown. I typically steer rather clear of clear or green bottled beer to avoid getting a skunky light struck beer. Every place that I have seen St. Peters, the display is usually rather dusty, not a good sign. But, since I have been meaning to try them for a long time now, I thought what the hell, get the IPA and see what its all about. I poured the beer into a St. Bernadus goblet (my favorite glass). There was little carbonation, low head, mild aroma, not much like an American IPA. It was dark in color, not a brown but maybe a copper-ish brown. It was smooth and had a nice mouthfeel to it. The hop character did not show up until the aftertaste at first. My fears that the green bottle and age had caused the beer to be skunky were well founded unfortunately. Even though this beer may have been past its prime, I still recommend it to everyone out there. Years ago, I had the Bert Grant's IPA in the bar "The Cellar" in Mesa, Arizona. I was big into hops at the time and would try anything that I thought would have an overpowering hop character. The Grant's IPA was mellow and really mild. The representative from Grant's that was present said that their IPA was from the original recipes used for the British IPAs. I did not believe him and found the beer rather boring. This beer is more hopped than Grants, maybe this is what they were shooting for. Anybody that is making a study of IPAs (specifically British IPAs) needs to check this beer out. I'd try it again if I could get it on draught or knew that the bottle was relatively new.","drabmuh","Jun 28, 2009"

Very edible but it's freaking me out. I have let this one sit unrefrigerated for nearly a year, so maybe that's a good thing? Well, the flavor somewhat follows suit. I now can identify some hops, again sort of an odd, but kind of an herbal thing I would say. There's a bit of soapiness but not too much. Malt and caramel blend in a mild sweetness behind the herbal glow. The body is midland and pleasant and depending on how you find the taste, it's drinkable, but generally a bit too odd to encourage any sessioning. Probably not the best one in their line. I probably won't revisit it but you might want to venture a try if you are an IPA guru. It may grow on you.","Durge","Jun 21, 2009"

The taste was great too, im new to IPA's so i found this one a hop blast from usual czech pils.

Drinkability, i deducted .5 from it, because honestly after one of these I didnt want another, not that it tasted bad, i just didn't feel like another pint...and thats rare.

I am able to pick up some malt scents as well but it is difficult through the skunky smell. With this being a English IPA I was expecting to pick up some hops but I cant. It has a good bitterness taste to it what is welcome, but to be called an IPA seems to be a stretch to me. Some malt flavor comes out to play which seem to be more on the toasted side.

The lightly hoppy aroma is nice ... summer-time flowers. The first swallow is sharply bitter, much starker than an American IPA. This is woody and tangy more than the citric fruitiness we Yanks have come to expect from a beer labeled IPA, unfairly.

The taste here is delicious. A smooth hoppy brew with a nice malt balance. Nothing too fancy here, just a solid example of how the Brits do a good IPA. I lived in England for 6 months back in college, and it was this kind of beer that really turned me on to hops. A proper classic IPA here. Very nice. Sturdy mouthfeel, though a bit thinner than I would have thought. Overall, I think this is a fine beer.
