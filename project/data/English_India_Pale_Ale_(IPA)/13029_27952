4.15,3.2,4,4,4.25,4,4.25,"Bucky snagged a 500 ml bottle of the brewery's Jaipur India Pale Ale ("Jaipur"), which was 5.9% alcohol by volume with a best before date of November 28, 2013 printed on the back. A little wary about this one...half-expecting a nuclear hop bomb. An overly aggressive pour produced about 2.5" of fluffy, snow-white head that lasted for quite some time, leaving some beautiful, sticky lacing down the glass as it retreated. The beer itself was a cloudy, yellow/gold colour, taking on more of the golden hue when backlit. Jaipur's aroma was dominated by grapefruit, with undertones of pine and orange. Its flavour began with a slightly sweet, juicy mix of grapefruit, orange and pine, transitioning to a distinctly bitter finish which lingered as a long-lived aftertaste. Definitely bitter, but not so bitter as to overwhelm all else and ruin the experience. Thornbridge has the balance just right on this one. Jaipur had a fairly active but suitable level of carbonation, and I would describe the beer as light to medium bodied. Though I'm not a huge fan of IPAs generally, this is probably the nicest one that I have tried to date and I would certainly drink this beer again. At $4.95 per 500 ml bottle it is pricey, but quality (and British beers sold in Canada generally) usually are.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Mar 27, 2014"

This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

The flavor brings very much the same profile as the aroma, no surprises, decent enough and probably a bit more hop than many other British hop brews.

Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, bread, herbal, floral, grass, mango, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance of malt sweetness/bitterness; with zero astringent hop flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice.

This resulted in just a modicum of bone-white head that quickly reduced to wisps. Color was a hazy sunshine yellow. Nose had a grassy, minty quality. Interesting. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was unexpectedly of fresh-squeezed grapefruit. I was in a swoon! Good on you, Clarke! I wonder how much different it is from a cask ... Finish was really hoppy and if you had told me that this was an English IPA in a blind taste test, I would not have believed it. This was a really fantastic beer. More please.","woodychandler","0"

Hop flavors sneakily layer on top of it until it occurs to you that this is actually a pretty ballsy beer. Zesty - lemon, candied orange, maybe a bit of mint. Smooth as hell in the mouth - subdued carbonation and admirably more-ish. I could drink this all day, any time of the year.

Jaipur IPA seems to have inherited a lot of traits from American-style IPAs, but the fact that the hop flavours are not palate-scrubbingly powerful half-heartedly corroborates the idea that this is an English IPA. But this is all semantics - it's still a ridiculously tasty brew, and there is little doubt in my mind it would be a regular purchase for me if it became a general listing (instead of just seasonally-available). It is well worth the price, and I would eagerly recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious, potentially sessionable IPA.","thehyperduck","Jul 07, 2012"

The taste mirrors the smell and is dominated by the huge citrus profile. Mouthwatering, juicy notes of tangerine, lemon, and grapefruit with a hint of mango and pine. A solid sweet caramel malt base balances out the resiny fresh hop bitterness perfectly. The mouthfeel is awesome as well with just the right amount of carbonation, a touch of oily hoppiness, and a really refreshing and crisp dry bitter finish.

3.94,-2,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall/Drinkability: I really enjoyed the smell and taste on this one, but for the price I cannot see myself getting it again. Still, with all that hop aroma and flavor, I suspect this beer would be quite something fresh out of a cask so if that option was available, I would pay for a glass again. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that as it warms up to something more of an English temperature, it gets more and more bitter. Almost, but not quite, mouth-puckering bitter. Overall, an interesting take on the English IPA and I'm glad I tried it. As for drinkability - one glass (albeit a large one) is enough.","damndirtyape","Dec 10, 2011"

The head held well, and it left short walls and sheets of lace as it went. The aroma offered notes of tart apple, marmalade, and grassy and spicy hops; all of which carried over into the flavor along with some added biscuit-like, mildly sweet malt. It was hoppy, but not overdone, and well-rounded. A solid, but again, not overly-done, bitterness anchored it, leading to a long, grassy and spicy bitter finish. The moderate carbonation and smoothness helped with that, and it was remarkably easy to drink.","NeroFiddled","Jun 05, 2007"
4,-0.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Light, bright golden/ straw color with a compact-yet soft white head that stays small but leaves good lace. Nose of earthy herbal tea with lemon. Flavors of earthy hop bitterness (UK style) but in enough quantity for an open-minded US hophead to appreciate. Light, dry cracker malt taste in the middle with a light to medium silky mouthfeel and mild bitter finish. I drank it with some mild flavored fish - Tilapia with just a little salt, pepper, rosemary, in a small amount of blended olive oil and butter. Good stuff.","dedrinker","Beers"

3.85,-4.2,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The appearance is a nice golden straw color, with a frothy, bubbly head (ala cask conditioning, thank you very much), and good carbonation. The aroma here is somewhat subdued, perhaps by the cask (although I don't think so), but still maintains a pleasant sense. Very piney and a bit grassy, but strong too, and almost a slight marijuana smell. Seriously, I'm not making this up. The taste is fabulous. Rubbery (in a good way) with lots of spicy hops. This beer very much reminds me of the Victory Hop Wallop. I mean, they could be identical twins practically. Mouthfeel is full and chewy; very solid. I'd take this cask version of the Jaipur IPA over mosts standard IPAs anyday of the week, but I also really really like spicy, hoppy IPAs. A worthy component for any hophead's repertoire, for sure. Drink up.","Atlas1","Apr 25, 2007"
4.45,10.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"This is one of the best UK cask beers I have ever sampled anywhere. I will definitely look for it on my next trip to Britain and will certainly order it any time I find it available in the US. I rank it on par with Hop Back Summer Lightning - an excellent pint!","cellarboy","Feb 05, 2007"
3.98,-1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Out of the cask, this beer pours a very attractive cloudy yellow/gold color, with excellent head retention and decent lacing. There is not a lot in the nose, maybe some wet earth and leafiness. On the palate this beer is most impressive. Nice citrus from the hops, with just the right amount of bitterness interspersed with the sweet malt. This beer is very light and refreshing to drink (in comparison to most of the IPA's and DIPA's you find in the states), with excellent mouthfeel and crispness. I guess in England this would be considered too high in alcohol for a true session beer, but I could easily see myself tossing back 3 or 4 of these on a warm afternoon. Very impressive. Like nothing you are likely to find in the U.S.","John_M","Beers"
