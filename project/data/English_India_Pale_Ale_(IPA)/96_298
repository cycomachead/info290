It leaves a slight amount of lacing and has nice legs to it. The aroma is quite weak but had notes of hop and citrus, mostly lemon. The flavor follows suit with some subtle malts underneath. It is a good tasting beer but nothing special. I hope that Magic Hat has more to offer than just this.","lochef81","Jan 31, 2014"

I've had a few of their sample packs before, and have been impressed by their style. This IPA is too strong with citrus hops, like a stronger version of #9, except more lemon and less grapefruit. Next time, I'll stick to their black IPA.","Skunky_Brewster","Nov 08, 2013"

Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, and fruity hop aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour citrus zest and malt flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer with an unexpected sour flavor that is throwing me off of what would otherwise seem to be a decent example of the style.","UCLABrewN84","Aug 09, 2013"

Sure, there’s a more subdued hop presence with more earthy and floral notes but that is to be expected with this style.

There is a nice fruitiness to this beer, however it doesn't balance quite right and the more you drink it the more artificial and off it seems. This definitely has a taste similar to the #9 from what I remember, it has that same kind of apricot artificial taste (I think this one is a little bit better though). Overall not bad, but not great. Worth spending $12 and getting it in a mixed 12. This doesn't even compare to the other level of IPAs coming out of VT though.","jaasen64","Jun 13, 2012"

Not sure if much changed because I have nothing to compare it to. Anyway, the beer poured out as a slightly hazy golden yellow color with a nice thick white head on top. The head is a little sticky and leave some lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is hoppy, there is a touch of malts in the background of the nose but mostly hoppy aromas dominate. The taste of the beer is quite nice, it's an easy going IPA, nothing too extreme here that'll kill your taste buds or anything. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side and it's a bit refreshing also.

Some buttery notes as well. A sweet fruitiness and some citrus. Taste is more of the nose with a bigger buttered toast/biscuit component. Malt gives a nice grain center to a bright and leafy hop finish. Dry with long notes of hop oil and grapefruit skin. As it warms the malt gets bigger and gives a broader platform for the well done hops to shine. Feel is a little light but the carbonation is spot on with a touch of creaminess.

The beer poured a medium-dark amber and left a 2 cm or so head, which disappeared quickly. The carbonation was nice and lacing was decent as well. The smell was very fresh and of course, the standard hoppy and citrus notes were present. The mouthfeel was light and crisp, and any movement of my tongue caused the beer to froth immediately. The taste had an initial sweetness, quickly moving to hoppy bitterness. I would put this in the mid-range for IPAs, it's a nice variation and very drinkable. Thanks.","Bartinator","Jul 14, 2011"

4,13,4,4,4,4,4,"This is definitely the highlight of the Magic Hat 12 pack offering. As it warms the hops come out more and can really compete with some quality craft IPA's. It also tastes pretty unique because of the different yeast strain they use with the very leafy hop taste. I usually get very fruity and rich tasting IPA's but this is more crisp and herbal which is a nice break from the usual IPA. So pretty much if you want a bit milder but different tasting than the rest IPA go for this one.","thebrood1987","Jun 13, 2011"
3.75,5.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Poured out a deep burnt orange. A small amount of head is present but disappears quickly. A hefty amount of malts countered with some citrus floral hop notes. Flavor is hops right up front. A lot of citrus but some subtle fruitiness with some mango and melon. The hops are backed by a solid toffee malt backing. A small diacetyl taste but otherwise balanced well. Finishes with a hop bite but it doesn't cloy. The malt takes over for the finish making this a beer I could grab a bunch of at the bar.","DrinkingDrake","Jun 11, 2011"

Taste is dominated by apollo and cascade hops up front, and throughout the body - while the fruit flavors and malt come through a bit, they are overpowered by the hops and I wish they were a bit stronger as they contributed to a great aroma.

It was just about the only IPA I could drink before I got a taste for hops. We're all getting a little spoiled with some of the intensely flavored extreme beers and mini extremes out there, so it's good to return to a simpler, traditionally inspired brew. There is still a good amount of hops to go around in this one. The hop profile plays off the buttery aromas and sweet flavor notes well. Looks good and is very drinkable.

The flavors were at first very bitter with the orange rind and herbal hops elements shining through clearly. However, there was enough toasted malt and hints of caramel malt to give the beer a solid backbone and balance. Dry and just a little toasty; clearly English in style. The mouthfeel was good, the body medium and the carbonation good. As with all Magic Hat beers, I found this to be good but nothing stellar.

The hops are more pronounced in the taste, but still hold a milder flavor. I find myself wondering what types they are using, and if they are English. There is also some biscuit like malt flavor, and just a hint of fruit. Mouthfeel is very crisp, and easy on the palate. Finishing off this six pack should not be a problem.

For IPA lovers, this smell is pretty close to heaven. Beer has almost a sweet beginning which works well with the floral aroma. Citrus notes fill your palet. The hop bitterness comes through at end of the beer, rounding out the complete hop flavor from floral to bitter. Mouthfeel is quite smooth for an IPA with appropriate carbinaton.

In some ways I think it feels closer to an American Pale Ale, particularly when it's cold.

Sweet, crisp, hoppy, with the occasional whiff of a supermarket's produce section, I eagerly took a sip and discovered one of the most well-balanced IPAs I've ever encountered. A subtle aroma of mulched leaves highlights the Blind Faith. Lighter on the bittering hops, heavier on the finishing hops, this IPA is supremely drinkable -- even more so because of its fine carbonation.

A citrus hop element rides in on a strong malty base. There is a slight hop bitternesss that comes in at the end and remains for the aftertaste. I'm not picking up any diacetyl, which seems common to Magic Hat beers, so that's a good thing. Drinkability is very high because there are no real off tastes that I detect and the hops are not raw or abrasive. This beer is not bad, there's just not a lot there.

There is a dense bready malt base that makes it self known at the same time as the bitterness kicks in.

It has a pretty good bitterness, I'm guessing 40-50 IBUs. The malts and the bitterness are up front and the flavor of the hops hide behind that.

It's easy in the mouth with a medium body and restrained carbonation. And although the flavor offers no more complexity than the nose presents, it is richer, and there's certainly enough complexity there to keep you interested throughout a pint or two. The bitterness is solid, but held back just enough to let the malt shine; and it finishes dry with some lingering bitterness, a splash of citrus, some yeasty fruitiness, a smear of buttery diacetyl, and finally, some lingering yeasty mineral-like bitterness and grassy/leafy hops.

The aroma is marvelous! Right up my alley. Strong hops over a good malt backbone. A little sweet-smelling with some yeasty bread (especially after it warms up a bit) and a hint of caramel under the solid fruitiness of the hops. The taste is surprisingly rather malty. Well, I guess its not THAT malty, but more so than I expected from an IPA. It has a nice fruity and slightly grassy taste and a bit nutty. The finish is where you know that it is definitely an IPA. The malt sweetness fades away leaving a lingering hops bitterness that stays around for quite some time, along with a little bit of yeast. And about 5 minutes after finishing the bottle, I had a little bit of a soft pretzel taste in my mouth. The mouthfeel is very nice, mildly astringent on the finish, the body is medium, medium carbonation. The aroma was what really sold me on this beer, and Im not sure why.

4.1,15.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I purchased a six pack of this while spending the holidays back on the East Coast. I popped the top to reveal the standard hippy-bullshit underneath the cap (Im kidding..kinda). After pouring this into a standard shaker pint the body is revealed to be a beautiful copper/amber. It is nearly crystal clear, evidently due to the fact that the yeast that bottle conditioned this were nicely compacted into the bottom of the bottle. The head rolls up perfectly to fill the rest of the glass, but does recede rather rapidly leaving only sparse speckles of lace and a thin clumpy layer in its wake. When the bottle was opened actual aromas of malts reached my nose from several feet away as well as the more stark aromas of hops that typically greet you when opening an IPA. Upon further inspectionthe malt aromas are nice. The hops I pick up in the nose however seem a little flat, I do pick up on some citric and light pine aromas but also a little sourness that seems out of place. A nice little fruity/nuttiness from the yeast rounds out the nose. The taste fairs a bit better than the nose in my opinion. Nice little layer of sweet malt up front. It seems the flavors of the malt layer nicely with the subtle nuttiness of the yeast. The bitterness levels are firm, but a bit light for what I find perfect in an IPA. The hops almost seem sweet, and although they have a bit of bite arent tongue stripping. About halfway through the last beer in the six pack I think I finally understand it. The sweet flavors of the hop (tangerine/apricot) compliment that nice midly sweet/nutty combination of the malts without totally over-powering them. This creates a balanced IPA, with layers of complexity that peel back revealing others. This beer leaves practically no aftertaste and the taste of alcohol is never even hinted at. As others have said, if there is a such thing as a session IPA than this would be it. Definitely try this one, dont be expect to have your teeth stripped of their enamel by alpha-acids, just sip on it and enjoy the nuances.","FormatKid","Jan 13, 2005"

It's good, but unremarkable for its style. Good lacing and head retention, but really I can't find any specific cool tastes to mention. It's got lots of hops, but not a mind-blowing kick of it...and a solid malt contrast. But nothing out of the IPA ordinary. Maybe I'm missing something.","cooter","Jan 06, 2005"

To me it smelled like hops and alcohol. The taste was slightly better. Bitter hops, and a bit of piney/citrus bite. Not very complex, just up front hoppy then it fizzles out into a citrus pine flavor. Mouthfeel was good, just the right amount of carbonation to make it crisp, yet not too filling. The drinkability was not bad. I would have drank another, but there was a decent menu there of bottled beer so I moved on to something else. However, if it was this or a mega macro, I'd take this in a heartbeat. Not a bad beer by any means, a decent offering, just not terribly exciting.

The aroma seemed to have much more caramel sweetness than most of the west coast IPAs with which I was familiar, and the hop notes seemed to be mostly floral and fairly mild. The flavor, too, struck me as unassertive. But after a few sips to allow myself to get into the spirit of this brew, it really started to impress me. The body of the beer is, indeed, less "punchy" than a lot of West Coast IPAs, but has a delightful subtleness of its own -- a sort of buttery biscuity body, leading to a mostly grassy hop finish. And then there's the aftertaste -- toasty, just a bit bitter, long-lasting and lovely. Muted carbonation brings out the complexities in the flavor, and lends the beer a fuller, more oily mouthfeel. Copper in appearance with a thinnish, though sticky, off-white head. A very nice session beer, and an educative experience for a die hard left-coaster such as I!","mzwolinski","Sep 10, 2003"

The flavors are big, but they're present -- and they're layered. Grapefruity flavors up front meld with some very light graininess and an herbal sort of finish that lingers...and lingers.

4.3,21.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall I find this beer to be just another great beer from magic hat. From the looks of it it could be just another stock IPA from any brewery, but it's the clear tastes, the balance, and the way it plays with the subtle flavors that trick the drinker. This is what brings me back to this beer and brewery over and over again.","taez555","Apr 27, 2003"

4.32,22,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a medium copper color with amber highlights, and exhibits a slight chill haze. It is topped by a fairly dense, 3/4" head that slowly fades to a thin layer of off-white foam, clinging to the sides of the glass as it recedes. It also leaves a nice lacing as you quaff. The aroma is nice and hoppy, sort of like a restrained, smooth Cascade hop aroma (just checked, actually it is Cascade), but it is mixed with a bit of roasted malt and caramel. Very seductive to say the least. The taste is very bitter, but it grudgingly gives way to a touch of sweetness. The lingering grapefruit in the aftertatse is very well done, as it is not as overpowering or annoying (to me at least) as many Cascade hopped brews. It is as refreshing as slightly sweetnened, fresh-squeezed lemonade. There is substantial malt to support the hops, and it lends a good mouthfeel to the beer. I could probably drink this all night, as it is both tasty and refreshing. Venom gave me three, so perhaps I'll have another this evening. This is a very solid beer, and I look forward to trying some more Magic Hat brews.","aaronh","Apr 16, 2003"
4.03,13.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This IPA poured a clear, amber color with creamy, white foam that left good lace down the glass. The smell was floral hops - citrus and grapefruit, and some biscuity malt. The taste was floral hops and malt with a nice citrusy (grapefruit) hop finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp with medium body. Nicely hoppy, though not overwhelmingly hopped. The drinkability was good. A nice, easy drinking IPA.","UncleJimbo","Apr 03, 2003"

3.72,5.1,3,3.5,4,3,4,"Still, after all that, this beer's primary characteristic has yet to be mentioned--softness. This is perhaps the softest beer I've ever had. This beer might even make a real Czech Pilsner taste hard. I don't know if Magic Hat's water supply is completely devoid of minerals, or if the yeast employed at the brewery has an odd affect on the wort... In any case, this beer is so soft that it literally scoffs at the notion of refreshment... The interesting part? I quite enjoyed it! Very unique in a world full of cookie cutter IPA's...","TXHops","Dec 29, 2002"
4.27,20.6,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Excellente! I was a little caught off guard with this one. It seemed super refreshing after being on strict diet of Chocolate Stout and Ruination. The aroma is what initially lures you in. It's very fresh and hoppy. Smells like a spring morning. The taste is very hoppy and complex, although definitely a little thin, which was actually ok with me considering what I've been drinking lately. The head retention in my beer was good too, despite what other reviewers have said. This is a definite must-try.","HossMcGraw","Dec 22, 2002"

4,13,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a light amber hazy color. Nice head. Has a great "pale" taste followed by a bold citris taste. I downed three of these before I knew it. Good session or football beer, it is present, but not overwhelming.","bewareOFpenguin","Dec 16, 2002"

4.15,17.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Handsome orange amber with white sudsy head that sticks around. Great, sharp aroma of hops. There is a good, British malt character that's quite subtle and then a big smack in the face of hops. Lemon and cookie flavors make up the profile. Refreshing at a quite cold temperature; as it warms the malts gain strength. Delectable hoppy aftertaste brings balance to the beer. Magic Hat makes great British style ales and then turns them 90 degrees on their side to make something unique, some of the best beers in New England (although that whole tired Burlington hippie image smells a wee bit phish-y). I think this beer would go with just about anything, particularly spicy Asian cuisine and maybe even sweet/tart desserts like lemon bars.","Thrasher","Nov 20, 2002"
4.42,24.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clearish copper with a thin, off-white head. Leaves trails of lace down the glass. Smell is rather fresh and inviting, with notes of aromatic hops and citrus. Taste is quite similar, relying heavily on fresh hops, citrus (mainly grapefruit), and a sturdy malt backbone that keeps everything in place. Pretty smooth mouthfeel overall. This one could be quaffed over and over again. An excellent IPA.","Jon","Nov 12, 2002"
4.73,33.6,5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"On tap at the Great Lost Bear...........Glowing copper color, perfectly balanced full beige head. Smell is full of cascade hop aromas, flowery, herbal, and rich. Initial crisp hop kick dances around on your tongue, then a medium feel, biscuit rich malty background. I guess the odd sourness is the Ringwood Yeast strain that others speak about, not sure, but is still pleasant and appealing taste. Crisp, dry, perfect for the style finish, no lingering bitterness. A slightly subdued, but very tasty IPA. One of the highlights of the summer. It lived up to the hype. This one on tap, prompted me to buy the sampler pack and lug it home to Florida.","StevieW","Sep 16, 2002"
3.53,-0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer has a serious, sharp hop aroma.  Spicy, floral, citrus, somewhat musty nose.  After the smell, the anticipation of bittering hops don't keep up with the promise of the nose.  Little malt sweetness to balance the hops.  The beer wasn't un-enjoyable, but there are countless better-made IPA's.","Suds","Jul 14, 2002"

4.18,18.1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a nice darker copper color with a decent off-white head that does not stick around too long and a good lace.  Some hops in the nose but not nearly enough.  There is, however, a strange toasted wood aroma that I can only assume is coming from the ringwood yeast.  Very nice taste that starts off with some creamy maltiness with the trademark ringwood flavors before it transitions to a strong floral citrus hops flavor.  The hops are left sitting on the tongue and create a nice lingering bitterness.  The brew is creamy across the tongue but going towards dry at the end.  I would like it to e a little crisper but otherwise the brew is extremely drinkable.  Great version of an English IPA here.  Thanks to Bierman9 for the sample.","Murph","Jul 07, 2002"
4.17,17.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This is my first taste of an IPA, and I was pleasantly surprised. A delicious ale. A nice amber color, very thin head, goes down very smoothly with a clean aftertaste. Nothing bitter about it. A very tasty India Pale indeed.","IrishRedRock","May 29, 2002"
