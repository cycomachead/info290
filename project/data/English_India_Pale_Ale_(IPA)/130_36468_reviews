"08/20/13 On nitro tap. Let me start by saying that I'm not a hops fan, but this is beer reinforce that. This is the first time I've ever truly regret not having had a taste first. I've spent the money & will drink it down, as not to fret the bar, but this should have a warning label. IMO this is way off base & I see the Rate Beer give it an 88 rating? A jaundiced view, no doubt."

"Overall, the most enjoyable thing about this beer was its flavoring, especially after it came to temperature. It was a tough call to choose, actually, because we were rather dissatisfied all around with regards to the lacking of hops in both the nose and flavoring. The aroma starts with soft sweets and decently robust floral, herbal qualities, but without the hops it doesn’t sit too well stylistically. We ran into the exact same thing with the flavoring. We haven’t had a straight English IPA in awhile, and we were pretty excited, so maybe we were let down a little too hard. Additionally, and this may be due to the nitro, but things seemed way too flat and overly soft to support the base flavor, which remained somewhat complex inherently. While this isn’t a terrible beer, as it does hit the spot, it fell way short of what we were expecting, again, especially after that aroma."

"This beer is pretty good, all things considered. It's a tough style to brew a beer to win over a crowd with, but I can happily enjoy this 22-ounce pour with no regrets. Alcohol won't get you, either. Maybe it's hit-or-miss; but on-draft, it's a hit."
"Overall – A rather tasty and smooth tasting brew with a very nice but still quite drinkable level of hop. Overall it is a rather balanced brew and a treat to drink."

"I was a little surprised that I liked this one since it is a fairly common and inexpensive beer. It poured a hazy orange color with a slight white head. A nice malty aroma topped this one off. No real hint of the hops was detectable in the aroma. In the initial taste, one gets peach skin notes mingling with the hops. A smooth malty backbone makes this a nice easy drinker. The hops are not too abrasive in this IPA, but are well balanced with the fruit and malts. In the aftertaste, the malt smooths the peach skin into a more modest fruit flavor. A surprisingly potent 6.8% ABV allows a mild warming sensation to be part of the aftertaste. The carbonation was not overly aggressive, making the aftertaste linger. This would be a nice IPA to have with a meal since it is not too complex. The food would not cause you to miss certain nuances of the beer."

"O: Pretty solid, I would get it again depending on the price. I was surprised to see this was an English IPA when as I noted for the nose but the flavor is more subdued as would be expected for an EIPA."
"A decent beer, certainly better on nitro than from the bottle, but still a fairly average beer."
"There's nothing wrong with the feel. It's moderately both crisp and smooth, with active but stable carbonation in a solid medium body."

"A solidly-constructed English IPA."

"Overall, this beer may turn out to be a down-the-drainer, while I return to the fridge for a hop fix. As far as I'm concerned, this is not true to style and a huge, barely drinkable disappointment. Perhaps the six-pack I bought was a bad batch or was somehow mis-treated."

"O - Having only recently being introduced to Boulder, I must say that so far I am very impressed by their beers. All of them are very flavorful and full and are perfect examples of their respective styles. This beer is no different, and is a great example of a British style ale."

"Bright orange in color & realizing this is my first EIPA. Frothy pillow-like off white head leaves thick lacing down the mug. Malt heavy in the nose with an excellent dose of fruity & spicy hop presence in the backdrop. Malty goodness on the tongue - bready fresh malt sweetness meets slightly spicy & citrus fruit hops. Almost peppery in the finish combined with the sweet tang from the malt and hops works nicely. Well balanced beer here, I would drink this all day long. Time to get a few more of these, and I highly reccomend you do as well!"
""
"Pours a pale gold with light white head that provides good lacing throughout. Combination citrus, piney, and fruity nose, with slight breadyness notes. The mouthfeel is medium with a similar level of carbonation. The Maris Otter malt is pronounced upfront, then followed by a well balanced citrus and spicy hop flavor, with the the malt lingering just a little longer. And let it linger we will, as we have heard that this may be the last brewing of this amazing beer. Cheers!"

"O- This beer is my personal fav from boulder beer. I wish they would make this year round."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" ~ This is a fine beverage and one I would have again. The feel is a bit aggressive for something I would consider sessionable. However, the beer overall is one I would recommend to a friend."

"O- Wow. Didn't expect to like this beer as much as i do. I would almost say it tastes like a hop-flavor forward, juicy APA to me. Not sure exactly what they mean by ""british style ale," but if you like pretty sessionable, herbal/citrus hoppy pale ales, seek this one out."
"Overall - A solid IPA that's able to distingush itself without forgetting that it's an IPA. It's not as strong as other IPAs I've had but it's still a very enjoyable beer to drink"
"O: This beer was just dreadful. Far too much butter."
"Very tasty, and a recommendable winner!"
"This is probably the best Boulder Beer offering i;ve had to date. Based on the strength of this, I'd definitely try another."
"Overall a brittish style ale that kills it with hop flavor while remaining balanced and subtle."
"Pours a hazed copper and orange tinted amber with great cap of dense white nitro froth. Scent is a nice mix of fresh hops ranging from earthy, spicy and grassy British notes to fruity and floral American varieties. Taste is quite big on the hop notes... quite unexpected. Big juicy fruit notes ranging from orange to apple and pear. Strong but not overly aggressive malting that ranges from clean to lightly caramel and nutty. Even with the nitro, this was immensely hoppy without being overly bitter. Smooth, creamy medium body from the nitro pour, hops linger on the tongue. Overall it was unexpectedly bold and flavorful, only that aggressiveness was a touch too much at times as some subtelty would have been appreciated over the course of a pint."
"Overall - Soild and easy to drink. Balanced really well. ALcohol is low enough, has enough sweetness, and bitterness is low. Fine example of a english ipa, really enjoyed."
"this is an interesting choice, but i'd prefer a more harmonious blend of hops."
"This beer poured out as a nice golden color, the head was fizzy and white leaving just a light lacing behind. The smell of the beer has a good amount of malt in the mix and some citrusy hops too. The taste of the beer has a strong bitterness to it. The mouthfeel was well carbonated and had a good drinkable quality too. Overall this beer wasn't too bad. I would probably have this one again."
"Clear, copper body with a huge, foamy head that threatened to overflow. However, it does dwindle rather quickly and leaves some spider web lacing on its way down. The nose was overly earthy with pine and grapefruit rounding out the hop side of the equation while toasted malt lays down the foundation. The flavor profile follows the nose. Earthy, herbal hops with just a touch of grapefruit and pine in the finish while toasted malt grabs the taste buds through the middle. Bitterness comes in a quick punch and fades even quicker. Medium body with a smooth feel. Carbonation is on point. Overall I found this to be lacking and pretty average in every way."
"Overall, this isn't working for me. I'm old school when it comes to english styles, which means english hops and estery yeasts. The german nobles and NZ hops to me are wholly inappropriate. I enjoyed the experience of trying something new, but did not like this beer overall."
"D: Like I said in the taste, this one is extremely refreshing and easy to drink. The balanced flavor of sweet malts and bitter hops make this one a joy for the palate."
"d - A nice English IPA. I got this as part of my beer of the month club and it's one of the better beers I've received from them. Would have again."
"Drinkability- A fantastic beer with a sweet, bitter taste. It tickles and tongue and is a great buy."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy copper color with a thick white head. The aroma of this beer is delicious. It smells like toasted malts and a spicy noble hop character. There is another aroma that is very interesting that I cant pin down. The taste is toasty, with a caramel sweetness. The bitterness seems to balance with the malt. There is a slight noble spicey hop flavor. The mouthfeel is medium light, with a decent amount of carbonation. This beer is very well balanced, and is also very drinkable."
"Very enjoyable. I would not call this an English IPA though. There is some sweetness for balance, but the hops are distinctly American from what I can tell. Regardless, a good beer that I would recommend."
"A good beer, very ssssionable, but its taste is all over the place, aspects of all kinds of ipa, from all over the world. A hodgepodge."
"Pours a clear amber with a fine white head and minimal lacing. Smells faintly of fruity hops. Taste is good combination of citrus hop and sweet malt. Neither is overly out front. Rather well balanced. Mouthfeel is mildly bitter and sweet. Overall, very sessionable and would have liked another to enjoy. Nice surprise and enjoyable."
"M/D - Full body that leaves a sweet aftertaste. A nice drink, borderline sessionable but a little too big. Glad I picked it up."
"The Cold Hop was recommended to me because I like hoppy beer, but I don't find this beer to be that hoppy. It is fairly tasty though. It first is tastes like a pale ale, then kind of hoppy and like an IPA, and it leaves a stout-like taste in my mouth. It is good, but with all the beers out there, I don't think I will purchase it again."
"D - Really nice rich, delicious brew."
"This beer pours a amber color with very small head, no lacing. It fortinalty taste and smells the same. A nice hoppy bite, but not overpowering. Finishs very smooth, and has a very dry flavor. Overall a great beer very enjoayble, very surprised, never heard of this comapny before."
"This is a nice beer that is different from the usual IPA/Pale Ale. Drinkability is all about how you respond to the flavor. It's mild enough that if you like it, you could have a couple no problem. I could also see people taking a sip and putting it down for good..."
"Drinkability: I just wasn't expecting a beer as interesting as this; just love the balance, with the sweeter elements (that I normally would eschew) really complementing an unusual blend of hop flavors"
"D - Naa.... Again I don't really like the style but it was pretty enjoyable. Didn't tarnish my view of Boulder in anyway. Good for the style I guess?"
"I know the ABV was on the high side, but this would be a good session beer."
"Taste is mellow and balanced, it's got a good maltiness to it but it leaves a nice sharp hop bite on the tip of your tongue. It's fairly refreshing and really easy drinking. Overall a solid EIPA."
"On tap at Bodega, a server's suggestion to start the night, not a great one...A dark but clearish gold, orange highlights, light head, not much retention or lacing...Aroma is sweet caramel to start, light citrus and some hops but not much...The taste is malty to start then a lot of bad hops, harsh, metallic, boring. nothing special."
"d- not great, i'm not sure about this one. i couldn't get over the sweetness here - not drinkable."
"Could drink a few in a sitting with the relatively low abv for an IPA."
"Overall, this is a sexy beer, at least in my opinion. Smooth, sweet, hoppy(in the UK kinda way), and drinkable. I haven't had too many British IPA's, but Cold Hop is good. I'm a little buzzed listening to the Who and drinking an English IPA on a Friday night, I don't think it gets much better. Cold Hop is definitely a drinkable beer with some complexity I didn't expect. I'd probably buy a sixer of this to enjoy again if the price was right (I think this bottle ran about $1.80 at the store). Good stuff, Boulder Beer!"
"Extremely easy to drink and 2-3 of these at a time would make for a good night."
"Hazed, orange amber with a finger of fine cream colored foam that leaves fine lace on the glass. The nose is fruity and herbal smelling hops with some toasty malt notes. This beer is tasty but not for people who don't like funky, earthy hops as this one is nice and dank. Fresh, citrusy fruity and resinous hop flavors with a nice toasty malt backbone. Medium bodied with perfect carbonation and lush creaminess. This is really good to my taste buds but I know quite a few fellow beer enthusiasts who would disagree. Oh well, to each his own."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle dated Oct. 4, 2010. Sampled on August 16, 2010. The pour is mainly amber and golden with a quarter-inch of foamy, off-white head that lingers. A bit on the cloudy side. A floral hoppiness greets the nose in the taste with a background of sweet malts trying to keep a lower profile. The body is medium to full. The New Zealand hops take me to faraway places but also keep me anchored to the ground with the earthy grains that accompany them. The aftertaste reminds me of flowers. A fascinating IPA."
"D - High marks"
"At the Blind Tiger, NYC. Into a pint glass, poured a cloudy orange/amber with one finger of white, good retention, and great lacing. Smelled of malted apple, pear, and slight herbal hops. Taste of apple, caramel, fig, and woodiness progressed to a thin finish. VERY thin, which most likely was highlighted by the cask. Decently sessionable, but a little too thin for me."
"D - Nice beer and one that brings a lot of balance. This is something that would be perfect for a session beer selection. I enjoy the interplay between the aggressive hops and malt profile."
"D- Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I typically prefer the American IPAs over the English-style IPAs, but I think the blend of hops in this one really helps a lot."
"Drinkability: To me this is average IPA. Not a bad beer, but nothing I would reach for again."
"Light/medium bodied and dry."
"Overall, I thought this was a pretty good take on an English IPA. Lots of fruity hops but also a solid amount of sweet malt. Quite drinkable as well."
"This is easily the best English IPA I've tried so far. Boulder Beer comes though w/ this one, recommended if you see it."
"Its a descent IPA. A good hop character with a crisp feel and smell. Refreshing on a summer day."
"Pours a dark golden color that borders on amber with a huge fluffy whit head that sticks around for a while. Wow what a nice nose. Spicy floral and resinous hops with hints of toffee and maybe some butter. Gives off and almost herbal aroma at times. Flavor follows the aroma quite well. Starts with a fruity floral and resinous hop that melds into a bit of an herbal note. The some malts come forward to reveal some toffee and a hint of butter. Finishes with a lingering spicy herbal note. Creamy resinous mouthfeel, rather full body, ample carbonation. Wow I enjoyed that one although it is not what I expected while opening the bottle. Well done Boulder, and welcome to NH."
"This is a pretty good beer, and I look forward to the rest of my growler. It may go without saying, but I would not recommend it to anyone leery or weary of hops. It tempers its hoppiness well, but a whole glass would be a lot to take for those hop-averse."
"Pours a lighter amber color with a thick and frothy white head that retains well and leaves awesome lacing, this one is a real looker. The aroma has some classic british hop characteristics of flora, mint, mineral, and earthiness, along with some biscuit, honey, fruity esters and a bit of alcohol. The flavor also starts off with a European hops blast with notes of mint, flora, pine and grass, along with some biscuit, bread dough, toffee, caramel, fruity esters, and a bit of an alcohol burn. The mouthfeel is bordering on oily but isn't unpleasant, and drinkability is quite good. I really dug this beer, and I'm not normally a big fan of English IPAs...the intriguing blend of hops really adds a nice complexity (they used british, american and noble hops)."
"I would recommend this if you see it."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a caramel color with a small head. Smell is heavy of hops. Taste like it smells, very hoppy, a tad bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this makes for a fairly decent brew."
"D: Goes down easily, ok balanced. A decent beer to sit with for a bit."
"Overall, English IPA's are not my favorite style, and this one is no exception. I'm more of a fan of over-hopped American IPA's than the overly malty English version. This is better than others that I've had, but just didn't do it for me."
"The ale pours brilliantly clear deep golden color with copper highlights and a clingy white head. The aroma is moderately hoppy, floral, spicy and a bit of citrus. There is a medium-low malt aroma as well, a bit like crackers and slightly sweet. The flavor is moderately hoppy upfront with a bit of malt and hint of esters toward the swallow. The finish is a bit prickly with medium-high hop bitterness lingering. The carbonation is medium-high and body medium. Overall a fairly balanced ale with a nice hop flavor. Solid."
"Drinkability: High drinkability. This is an interesting and unique ale. and quite tasty. well crafted and well worth a try."
"Medium bodied, and the mouthfeel had an excellent crisp dryness to it. The finish was chalky and toasty. This is a well-balanced good tasting beer."
"Taste is mighty tasty as well. Well balanced with plenty to offer on both ends of the spectrum. There is a definite hop attack at the beginning and finish, flavor then bitter while the malts are both sweet and toasty. The distinctive flavor of maris otter malt comes through nicely without being too overpowering. I think this is my favorite beer from Boulder I have had. Very easy to drink and does not taste or feel like a 6.5% beer. I would have no problem buying a sixer of Cold Hop were it available locally."
"D - All in all, a solid and drinkable beer. Nothing spectacular, but it has good flavor and maintains a nice balance. Wouldn't turn this one down in the future."
"It is possible that this beer was old. Was purchased at a quick mart and have not seen this beer local in some time."
"Drinkability is ok a nice change, but not something i would really repeat buy."
"Drinkability was good. On the bitter side for a English but nothing overpowering."
" I'd drink this anytime, Cheers!"
"This was much hoppier than expected and a pleasant surprise. I think I'll have to put this one into my regular rotation."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A refreshing beer. Not ground breaking, but very good none the less. Something I'd buy a case of to have on hand for a session brew."
"Conclusion: This is a really nice, nearly sessionable English IPA. The malty notes aren't quite as forward as they are in many English examples, but the hop bitterness is well-balanced with the malt and is fresh and tasty. A bit simple, but good nonetheless."
"the finish for this beer is med body with a great coating of bittering hop on the tongue. had this quickly at denver international airport before waiting in the security line and it was well worth it. very nice ale"
"Good beer, a decent IPA if light."
"D - only had one wanted more. could be dangerous at 6.5, as i could have no problems putting a big dent in a six pack of this."
"This is one of the most refreshing beers I had that day. I would certainly have a few more of this insanely drinkable beer. Great for everyday or sessions."
"D - very balanced, subtle yet rewarding flavor profile. good go-to session brew."
"A 'must try' by me. Boulder is new to MD, or at least my part of the state. Very happy to make your aquaintance!"
"I apologize for any typos or incorrect spelling. This is my first review written from my cell!"
"D: Very flavorful and nicely balanced with pleasing complexity. Disguises the ABV well."
"Drinkability: I liked this beer and could easily drink several on an evening. I certainly will order this one again when I have a chance."
"~Jonathan Passow"
"drinkability is great and i see my sixer not lasting long"
"This is a nice enough beer, but is nothing extraordinairy either. One thing I do like is how well the moderate, malty sweetness is countered by the hoppy bitterness in this one. Not bad."
"Overall, a very interesting, flavorful brew."
"Nice light carbonation and a smooth body. A good take on the british ipa would like to try this on cask."
"Interesting beer, tasty and drinkable."
"Poured to a hazy ornage with medium thick off-white head that lingered well and left good lacing. Nose was a citrusy hop (mostly lemons and grapefruit) offset by a hint of malty dark fruit. Mouthfeel was full and a tad biting, but agian offfset by the sweet smoothness of the malt. Taste followed the nose, with a bit of floral thrown in. This well rounded beer finished strong with a perfect mix of the hoppy bitterness and the sweet warmth of the malt."
"D: Very easy to sip and drink plenty of. Definitely worth a taste."
"D - Became better as the brew warmed; immediate greenness, acidity and almost unchecked bitterness fended off speedy imbibing"
"Drinkability: A good beer, solid and easy to drink, but doesn't really overwhelm the senses."
"D - An excellent beer that grows on you quite quickly. The hops flavor seems to creep up on you also as it is very nicely balanced by the malty flavors."
"Notes: It's my first English i.p.a and what an amazing style I must try more of this style and more of this beer. Cheers."
"Thanks to atsprings for the bottle (acquired the same evening after splitting Westy 12)."
"Tasty brew! Deep amber-almost copper-colored body. Very creamy off-white head with lots of sticky lace. Caramelish malt and grassy/ leafy/floral/earthy hops in the nose. Bright and fresh! Apple-like fruitiness comes through in the flavor, and there's a hint of pear as well. Caramel maltiness and floral, leafy, and grassy hops are, of course, present as well. This beer tastes like East Kent Goldings! I think this would pair nicely with a creamy, buttery triple cream cheese and some crusty bread, or perhaps some greasy fish and chips. And, although it wouldn't quite cut the mustard, I'd like to see it thrown up against a wedge of Colston Bassett Stilton. The bitterness is solid but not daunting, and it simply anchors the maltiness. It finishes fairly quickly, going out just as it came in. A really nice English style ale that's superbly drinkable. Well done!"
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. The floral components make it interesting when mixed with the citrus hops. Overall, it is worth having although I would not search it out."
"D - This is an outstanding IPA, but not an English IPA. Throwing in British caramel malts mixed with west coast hops does not count as an English IPA. I had to mark down on smell and taste due to this. Otherwise, outstanding."
"Light mouth on this one, but oh so creamy. This is a very smooth beer. Big biscuit malty sweetness in this beer. Finishes with just enough of a hop smack on the end, but nothing overpowering or harsh. This is one of the sweeter EIPAs I've had, but I like it alot. Recommend."
"I really like this ale. It has a really good balance between malt and hops that is typical of an English IPA. It's fresher than some other examples I've had that came across the big pond. Pick it up."
"D - Insanely drinkable... Insanely sessionable... Quite enjoyable offering from Boulder..."
"M/D - light bodied and refreshing, very drinkable and enjoyable. I'd definitely pick this one up again."
"Perhaps this was not a fresh bottle which made the flavors taste ""off", but I was disappointed. For 6.5 % ABV it is very mild."
"Again, DRINK COLD!!!! Warm....yeah, not so good. Can you say skunk?"
"Drinkability is great, a true deal at the price point compared to some of the more ""popular' beers which are charging a clear $2 more than this sixer."
"D: Very drinkable, I liked this one a lot."
"This is one of the better beers new to me I've tried in a while. Amber deep orange with a decent head. The aroma on this was what stands out to me - roasted up front with citrus lemon hitting the back. Taste pretty much the same although hops finish more earthy than citrus. Mouthfeel drinkability - maybe a tad thin - I could see having more than one - but may fill the palate quickly."
"Drinkability is pretty good as well. I think a sixer of this would go well while watching Wrestlemania XXV."
"12oz bottle into a Lucifer tulip pours a slightly hazy orange with a thin eggshell head that diminishes to a thin layer. Aroma is a nice kick of Earthy citrus hops with a touch of sweet malts. The taste is an odd blend of caramel and pale malts with an interesting hop flavor. The beer is medium bodied with decent carbonation. This is certainly an interesting beer, but not as good as their Mojo IPA."
"Thanks for Reading."
"drinkability is good, its a good honest beer, just like many of the beers that boulder makes."
"D-A well done representation of an English style IPA. Enough flavour to keep you interested and the soft, silky feel you expect."
"Taste: More citrus peels in the taste and surprisingly malty. Little bit of caramel malt sweetness to balance out the hop bitterness."
"Drinkable - I could have had more than 1."
"Poured from a bottle, poured a darker cloudy golden color with a decent head. The scent is not too strong but what there is, is light floral. Taste is a nice floral taste, then a decent bit of bitterness that lingers a bit. Mouth feel is decent no too thick but not on the watery side. Overall a decent beer when Im looking for somthing a little more on the bitter side."
"Drinkability: Quite pleasant to drink, the bitterness is strong at first taste but doesn't linger or leave an overly dry taste...will buy again!"
"Overall this beer reminds me of a regular IPA, except with some twists. Decent beer, however there is really nothing to special about it."
"Poured into a tulip a cloudy orange/yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy/foamy off-white head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy/malty, some citrus/pines. The taste is hoppy, with some nice sweet malty notes, nice tone of citrus, slight piney. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a nice EIPA."
"Nice creamy feel. Great balance of flavor...mild malts, subtle apple, some lemon and floral tones, and enough hops to balance it out and provide a nice bitter end, but not so much that it overwhelms the flavor. Probably the best offering I've had from Boulder Beer"
"Decent beer that can get easly lost in the plethora of IPA's out there. Worth trying, but stick with your favorite."
"Fairly pale in color, more golden straw with shades of amber. A thick, white cap atop it that has very good retention and leaves some rings of lacing down the glass. Kind of fruity pebbles smelling and floral. Earthy hops and a hint of biscuity bread but artificial flavor, or something. Pineapple and weird grapefruit but out of place. Very sugary malt. Same thing with the flavor. I think the hop profile is good but the malt kills it, giving it no chance to come to the forefront. Mouthfeel is solid. Creamy and smooth at first with a bitterness that soon meets it and rides out to a moderately dry finish. Something about this one just doesn't work for me. I'll probably try it again down the road but"
"Notes: Textbook,but very appealing in that this went down well and could almost be a session beer."
"D-A quite drinkable brew. Enough hops to keep me on my toes and a firm malt foundation that's able to pull everything together."
"Drinkability- Could have done without the sourness, but overall a pretty good job that could have been great."
"Drinkability: In a world of so many, how-many-hops-can-you-put-in-here beers, this is a well balanced ale, with good hop profile and a solid malt body."
"D: this is a great session beer, smooth, and tasty, and really goes down easy, another great beer from Boulder."
"Nice beer."
"Overall a very solid and very underated IPA. I would love to try this one on tap. It was as solid an IPA as I have had recently and was a pleasure to drink."
"D: nicely done. very drinkable."
"D: I guess it hangs onto English brew style...large and in charge and not as much hops as an American APA. Not bad but not great"
"About a one finger frothy head that wallows away to a nice. Beneath the foam, there is a copper amber with highlights of gold and symetrical bubbling. Theres also some nice Brussels lace as well. The aroma is an oily hop and medium toasted Caramel and Crystal malt bread. When I mean oily, I mean oil. The taste is an earthy, somewhat fruity hop. The toasted, biscuit malts taste a bit stale. Makes me think of a bitter, toasted egg bagel. Oily palte that feels muc better han the smell. This beer has sessionable written all over it, minus the oily smell and stale malt."
"overall a very nice bitter."
"Notes from: 12/08/07."
"Drinkable, yet not overly desireable. Lacking in appearance and mouthfeel, but the palate is full of that nice, not-over-the-top British character that makes for a quenching and sessionable brew."
"A real interesting, tasty beer that will allows have a place in my refrigerator."
"D: While this beer had its strong points, the taste was just not to my liking. Very off-putting."
"Pretty thin on the body with good carbonation. Not bad I guess. I prefer the AMerican version to the british but this wasnt bad at all. Probably wont purchase this again."
"A decent EIPA. I don't try many of these maybe because I am American. I like my beers crisp and biting. This beer has a nice pour. Light gold with a few small bubbles and a one finger off white head. The aroma is a weird mix of hops and farts. Yes I said farts. Two years running and it still has this same element. Taste was light malt and a hint of caramel with a very light European variety hop aftertaste."
"D: Citrus grapefruit flavor makes this taste to me like more of an American than English IPA. It's a decent beer overall, however. I'd happily drink this again."
"Drinkability: Not my session beer of choice but I could see making an decent evening out of this one if I had to."
"Overall, a pretty damn good beer. Definitely quite sessionable. The strong points are the flavorful malts and the quintessential English ale aromas. The low points are the slight lack of hops and the overcarbonation. I would love to find this beer on cask somewhere. In the meantime, I will definitely be buying more of this. It may be one of the more complex easy drinking beers I've had in recent times."
"I am glad I got a chance to try this beer,"
"Pours a clear golden amber with 2+ fingers of frothy off-white head. Very good retention and nice spotty stick. Smells of grapefruit, floral and earthy hops, bready malt, caramel, and earth. Tastes of grapefruit and apricot up front, then caramel, toast, and dank earth with a dried grass and floral hop finish. Medium in body with good carbonation. Sweet, malty, and citrus fruity with a nice slightly bitter finish. A good hop presence but nicely balanced and not too bittering, just enough. I don't know if I'd say this was a British style IPA, seemed a little too citrusy for me, but it was pretty refreshing and very easy to drink."
"wow...i wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as i did. IMO this is a layered and somewhat complex pale ale, IPA, or whatever you perceive it to be. definitely worth a try."
"wow. I'm pretty impressed. I feel like Boulder is always decent, but not always wowing. This brew, while not incredibly complex, is incredibly solid with some nice clean and green flavors. I could easily see drinking a few of these in a night. Smooth and light enough (in body) for sessioning, but enough flavor to keep it interesting. I'm impressed, and will definitely be drinking a few more of these. Definitely worth a shot!"
"Pours a dark orange/copper with a bubbly white head. Laces and holds well to the glass. Smells slightly floral with some citrus musk pushing through. Has some mild citrus hop with more breadiness coming through and settling down. Enjoyable, not too heavy with a good flavor. Not much as far as carbonation."
"A tasty, and well made beer."
"I could not drink this all night. Maybe I am not partial to english ales or I need to develope a tatse for them but this brew does not have the big flavors or complexity I would expect."
"Pours a amberish orange with a nice creamy light tan head that leaves some spotty lace. The nose is mildly fruity with some assertive hops. Slightly bitter with a nice healthy amount of green tasting hops. A good amount of grapefruit,buttered toast and subtle caramel malt flavors. Great creamy mouthfeel,medium bodied and refreshing for such a hoppy brew."
"This is my favorite Boulder Beer. BRILLIANT!!"
"Sort of a hybrid English/American IPA. Great hop flavor with the malts being slightly hidden."
"MF&D - Overall a pretty good beer, tasty and easily sessioned. I'd drink this one again"
"It's no showoff, but it is a perfectly pleasant English IPA."
"Slight amber body with a nice head the diminishes quickly. Very floral in the nose and also in the mouth. Seemed a little highly carbonated but was a nice contrast to the hoppiness. Very easy drinkability and not very filling at all. Would definitely reccomend. Not the greatest IPA I ever had but worth the three bucks or so. Another nice beer to add to their repertoire."
"Pours a light golden color with a very nice inch of pillowy white head. Smell is subtle hops. Taste is mellow hops, with a bit of mild bitterness. This is a decent beer, just doesn't seem to come together. Really smooth and seems quite sessionable, but at 6.5% this one will catch up with you. Decent, but nothing extraordinary."
"This is a tasty beer but is the run-of-the-mill hoppy near IPA."
"I just tried this beer on a whim and i loved it. It has an extremely hoopy aroma to it. Pours a nice amber orange with an off white head. The inital taste is awesome. It is full of fresh hops, probably one of the best beers that i have had. They go down extremely smooth also. There is a high drinability to this brew. A must try."
"D- This is a very drinkable IPA that I would purchase again in a heartbeat. Recommended."
"Good lace, sticky, no head, pale ale orange amber. About right. Smells like a standard bottled pale ale with not much to define it. A little fruit and a little of the malt, about average. Creamy swallow with odd rye component on the aftertaste and a tea-like tar overtone, but there is bitter at the end that has a little punch. Unusual and extra credit for the rye. Flavor? Because this is an English style, I knew this was going to be subdued, and while the taste is mellow, the hop sting at the end makes this surprising. Tarry hops, slightly bitter at the start, but not overpowering. Rye note in the flavor, more on the aftertaste. Candy like in the center, also not overpowering. Malt is subdued, leaving hops and water as the main components. Well, this is odd, tasty, blends well and has that hops burn at the end. Not bad at all."
"A typical IPA but well done... bit above average. Nice orange color with head that laces well. Floral and citrusy hops lend it a nice aroma and the taste is good. Light hop wallop makes it easy drinking. However, high ABV makes me unable to have more than two of these in a row. Also not easily found by myself. If it's easy to find for you, it's a solid IPA choice but not an exceptional IPA. Basically, it's something between a typical IPA and an excellent IPA."
"Mmmm, English IPA. The aroma is a little plain, but not necessarily off with more earthy grapefruit. Definite English grains in the flavor, for that dry, biscuity undertone and with grassy, herbal, floral and somewhat citrus hops dominating. Crisper than your average EIPA, there's certainly an American influence here, and while it fits into the style, it stands out. Worth a try if you dig the style and want something different."
"very refreshing and well crafted overall..i would recomend this beer"
"Pours a slightly hazy orange amber with a fairly nice initial head that fades to a thin cap but leaves some nice lacing. Smells very herbal and of fresh hops that have allowed to decompose slightly. Unfortunately that same wilted hop herbal flavor is there for me in the taste. I just can't get over that slightly back of the vegetable crisper flavor. Don't know if its the type of hops or hops allowed to spoil, but I just can't drink this. Mouthfeel is adequete,appropriately carbonated ans smooth, but I just can't get over the flavor."
"D- What a tasty brew. I will definitely drink this again. It's not really sessionable but rather something I could have after a day of work."
"d: A sessionable, but still hoppy beer. Good American take on the style."
"Pours a pure golden straw color with small head and very little lacing. you can smell the hops, kind of has a tart smell to it, pretty sweet. hops very present initially, floral notes and a tart taste as well, it almost feels like it has a glue taste to it taste pretty weak.good carbonation, medium bodied. decent beer, not one of my favorites and i wasn't impressed, with a name like cold hop it could really use more of a hop taste."
"D- i love wet hopped beers. i could drink several of these in a sitting. i liked this one more than most i have tried."
"very nice. the aroma and flavor outweigh the moderate bitterness, but it's dangerously downable and can knock you flat on your back."
"D. Overall a nice session IpA from the other side. Hoppier than I expected."
"D. Very drinkable despite the 6.5% abv. This one could really sneak up on you. This is a good beer. Balanced yet still enough hops to satisfy the hardest hophead. I think I will explore more traditional English IPA's to see how the style holds up. I would really like to try this in a cask."
"Mouthfeel is rich. Malts predominate. Hops complement. Very drinkable. A bit too much octane for a session beer, but it would be nice letting a few of these catch up with you. A nice American take on a British style."
"This is a nice beer and a nice American take on a British IPA. Creamy, full-bodied and slightly tart. Delicious"
"Drinkability - Incredibly easy drinking for an IPA, I love when this one comes around."
"A no hang-ups, no frills IPA with a bit of distinct English flavors. Dry and enjoyable, but not hoppy enough for me. It's decent and worth a try."
"D: Another strong effort from Boulder Brewing to stand right next to their other excellent Looking Glass brews."
"A very drinkable IPA, I enjoyed it very much."
"The flavor is like drinking mother earth--grassy, clean with some hints of orange. Backed by malt but definatley not as strong a malt character as others. Very light in the mouth, and while the hops are wonderful they don't leave they oily almost resin lingering in my mouth. The aftertaste is almost dry. I can definately tell the difference between this and more traditional American IPA's. I'm scoring the drinkability high on this one. Its much cleaner in the mouth with a 6.5 abv so several of these go down easily. I'm sad its such a limited release otherwise I'd roate it throughout the year."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. The beer is clear, light orange color, with a 3-finger head that lasted until the beer was gone. The smell is light citrus hops, seems American hops although the beer is called British-Style Ale, I got some grapefruit and apricot although not too strong. The taste was OK, the hops put some bitterness into the mix and the malts played a bigger role than they did with the aroma. I'd say the beer has a standard body and is very drinkable due to it's light flavors and alcohol content."
"I enjoyed this American take on the British style. It is certainly more aggressively hopped; but it still maintains an overall balance and subtlety. The toasted malt character is full flavored. I would consider this an interesting session beer."
"D_For some reason this is just not doing it for me. I like Boulder's other beers but this just seems too acidic and not hoppy enough for what it tries to be."
"Mouthfeel was medium to full in body."
"All in all, nothing major, but not a bad brew."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Worth a shot..."
"D - An above average pale ale. Due to the high levels of hops, this doesn't really seem all that English in character, but it's a really solid beer nonetheless."
"Medium amount of carbonation, easy to drink. I think I'd like to give this one another try & make sure it's more recently bottled."
"Drinkability is good as well. Not the prettiest beer to look at, but it tastes good, and would be a decent session choice."
"Clear, amber in color with a white head full of small bubbles, that linger for some time and then subside to a substantial 1/8"" cover. Sweet fruity aroma with earthy notes. Earthy taste, some sweetness, a bit of dryness and bitterness at the end. To me it seems slightly unbalanced, yet it is very drinkable."
"Drinkability- Medium drinkability overall as well on this beer. Not memorable by any stretch of the imagination. Give me an English English IPA any day. The American imitation just isn't cutting the mustard."
"Drinkability - a very nice IPA for sessioning. The bitterness doesn't overwhelm but doesn't let up either."
"Body pours to a honey orange amber hosting a inch and a half of fuzzy light tan head with nice staying power. Leaves slight scattered lace. Hops on the nose are very creamy and slightly piney with a sweet tart candy like buzz. Enters the mouth with sharp tangy grassy hop presence. The hop feel is very woodsy and raw leafy like. a different experience hop wise as this beer is very green. Makes me want to hug a tree. There is a bit of balance mid palate with some malt presence. A bit of citrus does come through as the beer warms. Nicely drinkable with a unique hop feel. Mouthfeel has a welcomed hop bitter thickness."
"D: very nice drinkability, with a nice pale malt backbone that stands well against the strong citrusy hopping."
"From a 22 oz bottle this poured a nice apricot color with light yellow head that was big and fizzy and left great lacing. Nose of piney and fruity hops, light malts and a touch of flowers. Good rich mouthfeel. Flavor is of fruits and hops, and there is nice long bitter finish. Very enjoyable to drink"
"Probably the best beer I have had from Boulder."
"Nice beer, good price and recommended."
"Overall: For $1.99 I would buy this again for sure. Nothing spectacular but cost per taste unit is quite high."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice beer to pound for a while if you're in the mood for the style."
"D-I enjoyed what this beer had to offer, and I'd like to try a fresher bottle since the condition of the one I just bought is disappointing--great physique, but no spirit. It definitely demonstrated it is worthy of a second opinion."
"Beer poured an orange color with a 2 finger white head that is leaving a nice lacing behind. Nose is somewhat biscuity with hints of citrusy hops. Initial taste was very much an American PA, a blend of biscuity malted barley with west coast hops providing a nice citrus finish. A twist was that I caught some orange in the initial sips. Subsequent sips suggest the hints of UK hopping influence as apple is present as I progress thru the bomber. Mouthfeel is quite nice, almost a full bodied beer for the style. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a very well balanced beer that is very easy to drink!"
"Notes: This is the second solid offering in a row from Boulder. I also enjoyed their Never Summer Ale a few weeks back. If I lived in Colorado, this would make the perfect ""house beer"" -- it's flavorful, but not over-the-top strong in any way (e.g., hops, alcohol). It's a little pricey here to be a ""house beer"" but this would be a solid offering to regularly have on hand. Check it out."
"D - Very smooth and balanced w/ a nice blend of malty, fruity and bitter. Very citrusy, yet mellow almost lime-y w/ a spice and rind flavor that has a hint of dry ale flavor and booziness. Very satisfying and drinkable, Kudos to Boulder, a testament also to the Godfather of homebrewing Charlie Papazian w/ a fine fresh and well crafted English inspired American offering."
"One thing I would have liked to see is maybe a little more of a spicy, grassy hop flavor with a slightly lighter bitterness for more of an English style. On the other hand, I really liked this beer as it was, so why fix what isn't broken? Final verdict: Hazed & Infused with English malts."
"Recommended try from boulder beer. I do think I like Hazed better though."
"The flavor isn't all that great for an English OR American IPA; it is decent, however, and slightly above average for its style. The taste is a bit more malty & spicy than the sweet, floral aroma. Mouthfeel is overly carbonated, and the body is dry and bitter with a decent, sticky sweet finish. Overall, Cold Hop isn't phenomenal, but it does satisfy the basic requirements of a hoppy, English IPA as well as a beer that's got enough depth to keep me temporarily interested."
"A rich tawny gold with a little orange topped by a thin but persistent cream-colored head. Read the label saying it was a British style ale, and expected an earthy Fuggle or Goldings hop aroma, and got a snootful of citrus and pine typical of the northwest US instead. Not bad, mind you, but unexpected. Like a Keith Moon drum solo in the middle of a Beethoven symphony. The malt is a solid sweet presence in the aroma, and really keeps the hopping of this beer quite pleasantly in balance. The beer is a little on the heavy side for anything but an IPA, but a second or third round would certainly not be excessive. Certainly worth the price of admission, but one that I think would be better classified as an American IPA and let folks rave about how nicely you crafted that nice malt body than claim British heritage and get knocked (like here) for malting like a Deutschmann and hopping like a Yankee."
"A decent beer, but not terribly interesting. I don't regret drinking it, but there's nothing really here for me to go back to either."
"Drinkability - Didn't know exactly what to expect here, but not a bad brew at all. Nice change of pace too for those of us used to American IPA's, this offers a nice alternative while still delivering the robust hops and flavor we all love. All in all, a good brew that you should try if you get a shot."
"D - This is a very easy drinking IPA good hops but not overwhelming a very good beer I'd say its worth a try"
"A standard English IPA, but with the hopping rates expected from the American stle. A firm, malty (Marzen-like) malt base has a crisp, lightly crusty, well-attenuated character that balances well with a healty dose of pine / pungent / resinous hops that linger well after the sip is gone. Beyond that, the fruitiness / esters are light, allowing the malt sweetness and hop bitterness to set the tone for the brew. The beer remains a murky amber / rust color throughout with expected head formation-retention to hold throughout. The beer attenuates in a very American sort of way, not allowing the heavy sweetness to remain, as it does in English Pales. However the grain flavors are softer and less husk-like, as found in American Ales. A nice blend of both."
"Pours a foggy orange amber. Nose is very piney hops with that sweet character to it. Flavor is very hopped, but in a noticeably English style. I feel like it purposefully subdues itself and never gets out of hand, as many American versions of the style might. The hops present themselves and then an earthy bitter tone hits you. Feel has a bit of carbonation to it. The liquid is thick, though it gives a thick, slick, and syrupy texture on the mouth. Overall very good. Definitely one for the hop heads and possibly one for the real ale folks out there too."
"D - A solid session IPA...I'd pick up a 6-pack if I ever saw it in PA."
"This is beer is good, well balanced, and refreshing. Solid."
"I could easily drink this all night long."
"Pours a bronze-orang color, thin head rapidly fades. Aroma is hard to pin down; strong malt background with piney hops. The piney hop come through in the flavor, theres also a light citrus flavor in the mix. A bready malt holds it together. Theres a long-lasting hop after taste. Seems to be a classic English IPA."
"Seems to me to be about as good as anything the Brits are putting out these days."
"I really have little to complain about this beer. Its actually quite good. Good representation of the style."
"D - well, as yet another biased IPA lover (YABIPAL?) I quite enjoyed this beer and was happy to have received it along with the others I have yet to try. I like it, and would definitely have another if I didn't only have 2 left. Would probably order several at the pub as well if it were around. Enjoyable. Give it a shot if you see it."
"A unique take on a British style IPA, given the the cold hopping and creaminess. A little grapefruity, and some malt offset. A tad of toastiness in the aroma and taste as well. Lace dots. Golden yellow colour. Easy drinking, and I could finish a few of these over a week."
"Pours easily down the gullet, llight on the tongue, and tastes great a tad on the colder side (I'm guessing 36-38ish)."
"I had waited months to try this, not being a fan of rather bland (IMO) English Ales but the bottle and carrier art always drew my attention. I'm glad I did. This is an interesting beer."
"Final Note: This beer provides the hop bite I am looking for in a well made and well balanced beer."
"Drinkability: nice easy drinking IPA with fresh hoppy flavors. Could drink two 22-ouncers and get my hop fix."
"A well-made brew here - British-style with an American flair."
"This ale pours an amber orange color with an impressive dense white head. Fair amount of lacing. Smell is pungent grapefruit and pine. Softer sweer malt notes as well. Taste is a hoppy grapefruit and pine blast. Very impressive. Only a slight malt balance, perfect for my palate. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean with the bittering astringent doing its thing. A fairly drinkable brew, I did find my palate crushed."
"Very easy to drink. If ABV wasn't a factor, this would make a very good session beer."
"A decent drinkable beer"
"Another tasty freakin brew from Boulder. Im guessing this is under 5% alcohol  making for a decent session brew."
"Pours a hazed amber/orange, thin white head, some lace spots, settles to a thin layer. Smell is neat, grapefruit and pineapple, very fruity, some sugar and honey, grassy hops, really neat. Taste is toffee and chocolate sweetness, pineapple, bready malt, some floral, sweet citrus and fruit finish, bit of tea character, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation, pretty chewy, very nice. Really enjoyed this beer, definately wish I had picked up a bottle."
"Medium bodied, mild carbonation is good for the style. Solid, pretty tasty brew."
"Overal: This is a tasty beer. The malt is malty enough but not too sweet and the hops are just right to enjoy. There is nothing that stands out to make this beer outstanding but it is good."
"Upon its departing the 22 ounce bottle the beer presents a somewhat hazy deep amber orange color with a skyscraper sized creamy white head that lingers long and upon its vanishing the lacing seals the glass with a thick and clinging layer. Nose has a dominate malt aroma, sweet and clean, hops provide a bit of fresh cut grass aroma, and a bit of butterscotch. Start is richly malted; the hops provide a nice bite at the back, top is moderate to full in feel. Finish has a fair to middling acidity, the hops perfect in the benign spiciness; quite dry aftertaste stays and stays, a nice representative to the style."
"Cold Hop British-Style Ale is an inspired, niche-filling addition to the outstanding Mojo IPA and the equally outstanding Hazed & Confused. It's probably my least favorite of those three, but that doesn't mean that it's anything less than a wonderful American-brewed English IPA. C'mon Boulder, distribution to Iowa seems like a no-brainer."
"In an English style Boddington's pub glass, appears a slight hazed bright copper amber hue forming a large orange tinted sandy head with a dimpled dough like cloud texture. Thick formation at least two fingers worth even thin lace is left behind after the slow dwindle. Aromatics contain nice citrus tea with funky and grassy herbal qualities upfront, malts edge their way in with doughy caramel sweetness but overall a really pungent distinctive hop aroma that is hard to compare to any other brew of recent memory. What's up with Colorado why does the beer have to be so cold? Now we have the coldest tasting hops out there. Flavor has a sharp assertive hop bitterness with funky biscuit caramel malts, an aggressive American brew with some English ale twang to it. A lot of earthy herbal tea flavors with mild citrus peel hop tones raw and raucous to the core. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a strange slightly oily, yet a tad prickly with citrus peel bitterness sticking to the palate. Carbonation is dead on, not the complaint here just something weird about the feel this brew had to offer. Drinkability is nice but isn't too sessionable the pungent hops and English funk become too much after a couple, high quality offering it's just not something I want to drink during the football game."
"Dark golden ale, with an attractive eggshell coloured head. Strong aromas, spruce like, with a deep treacle accented malt backing lots of semi-sweet malts, sometimes getting really ""toasty", good hop presence, piney, bitter. Ok on the palate, not boring at least. Overall very nice, well drinkable on a cold Autumn night."
"This is just a highly drinkable beer. The appearance is spot on for the style, the smell is light and pleasant with a good malt/hop balance, and the flavor is right up there. It's well balanced, and supremely sessionable. Definitely a good beer, and a great interpretation of the milder English style."
"Overall: Another solid offering from Boulder Beer, this ones a nicely crisp and floral hopped IPA. Recommended."
"Notes: I'm pleasantly surprised here. I'm not a big fan of English IPAs but I could not resist a brew called ""Cold Hop"". This has the makings of a nice ESB in my opinion."
"A fine all occasion beer from Boulder."
"Overall a very good and very well balanced ale. Highly drinkable."
"Overall fantastic offering from Boulder Beer. According to the bottle it's their take on one of Charlie Papazain's favorite recipes. English overall, but with a nice American flavor kick."
"Drinkability: This is a nicely done English IPA. While the hop presence is there, this beer has not overhopped just for the sake of making a big hoppy IPA. I enjoyed the 6 pack I purchased for just $4.99."
"Pours a clear amber/orange with a large tan foamy head. Long lasting and great lacing, make this head very nice. The smell has sweet malt,citrus hops,and floral earthy scents. The taste is thin with some bitter hop,floral,sweet malt,and some ""woodiness"" to it. The m/f is light with all the flavors mixing well. A good drinking beer,for a lower alcohol beer, this packs a real flavor punch."
"A mostly pleasant drinking beer, slightly different and more subtle than most hopped beers. A nice one to try."
"Very gooddrinkability. We drank this one at room temp. which was probably best as it seemed to release a more true smell and taste. I really enjoyed this brew and would visit again. Great for a hop head butnot hoppy enough to turn those with a more mellow craving away. Thinking about picking up a 6er for our Bloctoberfest tomorrow night (it's going to be about 70 degrees so an Oktoberfest will have to wait )."
"A clear copper colored brew with a clumpy off-white head and good lacing. Smells of fruit nougat malt and sweet hops. The taste captures a sprucey hops with great slick body and a bit of alcohol. It's creamy but has a nice touch of subtle bitterness and some licorice at the finish. Quite drinkable and overall fairly sweet while keeping the hops happiness. Very nice. Don't miss trying this one."
"Drinkability: a nice change up from all the American style IPAs that are flooding the market. Easy to quaff, flavorful, and a nice session IPA. Give this a try."
"drinkable?: kinda, have had much better balanced hoppy beers"
"Overall a nice ale, good, but not great by any means."
"Pours a clear golden,with a thin white head. Good retention,and lacing. Smell is of earthy hops,and a hint of grapefruit.This is a medium bodied beer,that is lightly carbonated. Taste is of woody,earthy hops,with a nice balance of malt. Excellent from start to finish!"
"All these qualities make it super easy to drink. It goes down very easy and is a great hot weather drink. Very quenching."
"http://jbojangles.blogspot.com/2007/09/beer-othe-moment-boulder-beer-coldhop.html"
"The mouthfeel is medium, the carbo is medium, and it finishes slightly sweet. Good stuff and it's going to be no problem at all finishing the bomber. I recommend it!"
"Taste: Sweet beginning that is pushed to the background by strong citrusy hops. Grapefruit is the flavor that comes to mind immediately, with also a pine note that lingered in the finish and was a little off-putting to me for some reason. Not really balanced, which lowers the score somewhat (for me)."
"A good beer, but not something to desire everyday."
"Overall: I am not usually a fan of British Ales but this one is very Americanized. It has a nice aroma and nice american IPA taste. The balance between the hops and malt is perfectly done with each one making an appearence with each and every drink. Boulder has done a good job with this beer. It's one they should bottle again and again. Would make a great summer session brew."
"Overall, it's a nice fruity Beer, I can't get over the fuzzy peaches!"
"12 ouncer, no freshness info, but plenty of info in tiny type on the side of the label. Pours, almost golden, almond amber, light tan head, showing tiny bubble, a slow melt to a film and nice looking, fine stringy lacing. Earthy, fruity nose, preceeds the pleasant flavors to follow. Bready malts, fruit filled hoppyness, and a smooth on the tongue mouthfeel all conspire to make this a balanced, worthy and thoroughly tasty sessioner. I also pick up notes of citrus, vanilla, light leather and even a hint of smoke. I like it, nice job here on this subtle yet complex take on the style."
"This beer pours a brillant orange-red color. The head is large, fluffy, and white. The aroma is of pine needles, oranges, and a hint of grass. The taste is like the aroma with the addition of a moderately aggressive bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth. Carbonation is low, but adequate. Overall, this is a fine IPA. It is not the hoppiest beer around, but most of the time I don't want the hoppiest beer around. I wwill certainly drink this again when in the mood for something assertive without being offensive."
"Pours out a deep gold color, nice sized cream colored head on the top. Nice floral scent, some buttery tones. Buttery malt taste, backed by the distinct bolder brewery hop flavor. Think of an english pale ale, with the standard bolder beer company hop mix. Full, creamy mouth. Good lace left on the glass. Very tasteful, very drinkable. Check it out."
"I really good ipa that seems more american than british. The pub had this labeled as a 'strong ale', which i new was wrong, but i wouldn't of tabbed this of the british style. I really enjoyed this brew."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. It's balanced perfectly, but gives a good hop blast for the hop-heads. Doesn't have the sweet, heavy aftertaste of some IPAs, making it a great session beer. Can't wait to drink the other five."
"This one is nice all around. I wanted to not like it for some reason after the first few sips, but it grew on me, and fast. Flavour just gushes all over the place and there are no real flaws to be found. An easy recommendation."
"Drinkability: Doesn't really remind me of anything British. Shows what I know, I guess."
"Medium bodied with lighter than average carbonation. Aftertaste is slightly dry with a touch of bitterness. Not a bad beer, overall. But I think these two styles should be left to their own merits and not combined."
"Overall- Not bad. Easily drank a 6er of this and would do so again."
"mildly hazy copperish color with an off white head that leaves a lacy lace. well balanced smell with a nice hop/malt/yeast character. piney and bready. maybe a little fruity. i could wax poetic about how this isn't all it's cracked up to be, but truthfully, i taste traditional english and typical coloradoan flavors. not over the top, but certainly above average for a beer that isn't trying to push the limits. medium body and mildly creamy mouthfeel. easy easy drink and great with a sharp cheese or spicy food. this one was a gift from a friend that took a trip to colorado and was kind enough to bring back some flavor for the geographically tied down ilk. thanks bob! hey now!!!"
"So, a nod to the English with an American twist; or so says the bottle. What this usually translates into is nowhere near the malt or yeast complex subtlety of an English ale with far fewer hops than American hop-headed geeks want. Great. A middle of the road beer. Trying to bridge the gap between two sides only to find they've built a fence, not a bridge. But it's not bad. It tilts more to the American than the English side of things here. It has a nice balance of malts and hops, but the hops do get out front. It has a nice soft mouth feel, and there is some malty depth after all. Yes, I will recommend it, but only to the curious, or those that feel they have to try them all for fear of missing out on ""the one."" Which this one isn't by the way. If you are a fan of either side of the Atlantic in particular, this one won't have you buying a plane ticket to the other side any time soon."
"Dull copper. Bubbly off white head. Lacing is moderate in quantity and lacy in design. Very nice aroma. Floral, earthy, fruity, resinous and smoky. For an English IPA, quite a bit of aroma is squeezed from those English hops. Nice work. Nice tasting English IPA. Kind of a grundgey feel at first. Not as bright as the American counterpart, but not expected to be either. Toffeeish malt backing with earthy, herbal hop accents. Kind of raw. A little resinous in flavor. Good flavor overall. Slight bitterness is pretty clean, though it doesn't linger much. Body is medium to medium-full Light amounts of carbonation. Solid English IPA."
"Starts out with an orange-like hue. The piney, floral aroma of hops dominates. Again, with the taste, you get a lot of piney, floral, citrusy hops, but with a nice malt balance at the back end. Going by the aroma, you would think that the hops would dominate but this beer is pretty balanced out by the malts on the back end. It is very drinkable but beware I'm not sure of the abv, but this does pack quite a kick."
"Pours a golden amber color from a 22oz bottle. The dense, white one-finger head left stilted lacing on the glass. The smell is light grains with a distinct grapefruit twang that shows up again in the flavor. This grassy, hoppy citrus bite is balanced with a sweet malt body. The finish is ruby red grapefruit again, but not as crisp and clean as an AIPA. Medium bodied. Overall a tasty brew, with a much more pronounced hop presence compared to other English IPAs I've had. I'd have it again for sure."
"Pours up a clear light-copper color with a thick off-white head. Good retention and stickage in the nonick. Aromas of caramel malts, grassy hops and a good overall cereal aspect to it. I'm not entirely sure where the monicker ""cold"" comes into play, but this is a good interpretation of an American-brewed English IPA. It has a healthy dosage of 2-row malt paired with a decent hop bitterness that is by any strech over-the-top. It's hop character is subtle and complementary to the malt sweetness. A lightly lingering astringency is the predominant indicator of hops. Otherwise, it is just mostly malty sweetness with a light minerally background. Carbonation is mostly light and subtle, spot-on for the style they're going for. It may sound strange, but if I were to reproduce this beer, I'd go for a bit less west coast hop addition and up the American-cloned Euro low-alpha content. A nice beer, just my 2 shillings."
"Drinkability: Good"
"A decent beer. This is a great choice for a plate of bangers and mash. A very nice interpretation of the style. A hearty cheers to the boys and girls at Boulder."
"22 oz bottle, 7th in the Looking Glass series. Pours a hazy orange body with a one inch offwhite head. Some attractive patchy lacing. Aroma is malty toffee and caramel,floral and earthy hops, and some red apple esters. Medium body with prickly carbonation. Taste begins with toffee and caramel but the maltiness is quickly eclipsed by the bitter hops. Earthy, floral, even citrus notes edge into the hop profile. Well balanced, overall. Interesting, tasty, and quite drinkable, but definitely a style bender."
"Pours a copper color with a tan head. Aroma is all hops, small citrus/ grapefruit. Taste is hops as well and a mellow malt, lighter body than anticipated as well. Aftertaste of a small maltiness and a hop, but it does not linger. Very nice, easy to drink, aprehensive going into it, but turned out very nice!"
"Hey, I found an ""English"" beer that I like, but it comes from Colorado. Many of the English beers I've had have a metal or tea-like bitterness that I dislike. This doesn't, so good for it. A nice beer."
"Bomber pours a clear copper color with a big two finger head. Aroma is sweet orange with some definite floral/pine. Taste is sweet malts followed by mild bitter hops that mirror the aroma. Stronger than your typical English bitter, but milder than an American IPA. Nice to drink one, but not a session candidate for me. Nice beer."
"Overall, it tastes more like a subdued American IPA or Pale Ale than anything British. I was expecting more of something like Odell's old Cutthroat Pale Ale."
"D: Pretty good. Even after this 22 oz. bottle, I feel like I could drink more of this beer. I will drink this again for sure."
"Drinks pretty easy, don't recall too many english IPAs this hoppy when I was sampling there from 88-93. Hop heads could enjoy this as a session ale easily"
"Anyway, it drinks down really nice, but not that amazing of a creation. I could have kept the five bucks. A pleasant sip, nonetheless..."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head over the slightly cloudy amber brew. Head falls gradually, with ample sticky lace lingering more or less forever. Aroma is citrusy, with a little grassiness mixed in. Taste follows along similarly, each flavor melting nicely into the next. Mouthfeel is smooth and soft over the tongue, and drinkability is quite nice and easy. I was expecting something British-style from the label, and that's what we got. Very nice."
"Poured into an impy pint glass a clear rich golden with a swirling tight one finger head that held good retention,milder English aromas quite floral and minty with a hint of toasty sweetness.Full on English malt and hop flavors starting out slightly toasted and biscuity with a noticeable caramel sweetness even a hard water-like note,the minty ""green"" hops come thru and linger nicely a bit of American grapefruit comes thru as you drink more as well.A nice quaffer it says high gravity on the label I would like to know how ""big"" it is,a nice beer just dont expect a big American hop smack."
"Overall, a tasty, easy drinking IPA. Much more than an English Pale Ale, but much less than an American IPA. Worth a try for sure."
"D - A very good beer. Nice mild hop flavor. It seemed very true to the style."
"Poured from the 22oz bottle into a pint glass. Body is a bright golden orange hue, topped by a quickly dissipating thin ring of stark white head. Aroma of lightly sweet British malt and mild fruity hops. Palate is nice and mellow - British malt and a light hop character are very well-balanced. The finish is smooth and mildly sweet. A velvety, slightly rich mouthfeel is just about perfect for an English pub ale. Not necessarily what I would call an IPA (American, English, or otherwise), but a tasty ale nevertheless."
" The alcohol could hardly be detected here, but those who've had some of the other beers in the ""Looking Glass"" series will notice a similar aftertaste here. No matter, Boulder has an easily drinkable winner her, and I look forward to seeing it for sale here in New Jersey. At least I got to enjoy this out of a big bottle!"
"d: i could drink a few of these, its not really a sipper."
"Overall, this seemed just a notch shy of enough hops to qualify as an IPA, but the flavor profile was nicely complex. Hops had an earthy, leafy flavor that complemented the mineral note in the malt. Nice, sharp bite at the finish - overall the beer carried off the English slant quite well, and would be a good beer to have with a meal."
"Extraodinarily drinkable and refreshing for what seems to be a relatively high abv beer. I love it and hope it comes out in sixers."
"The beer pours a nice golden color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a piney hop scent that really stands out over a solid base of pale and light crystal malts. The English yeast esters blend well with the hops to create a refreshing aroma. The taste is good. It has a very bitter flavor that goes down easy and finishes hoppy with a bit of fruity yeast esters. The malts are present, but they seem to only provide a stage for the hops and yeast. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is an interesting brew. I love the hop content, but it seems a bit unbalanced. All in all, a good drinker."
"Cold Hop British Style Ale pours a reddish amber color with an off white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. There is a bit of grapefruit in the aroma. There is a nice thick mouth feel and a big rush of hops of a grapefruit type nature. Toasted malt becomes more apparent as the beer warms. I like this one."
"Overall impression: Very nicely balanced - I had this at the brewpub a few days back with fish and chips, and it worked great. I look forward to this in six packs later in the year."
"Overall, a fantastic beer for any occasion. Its crisp enough to slake a thirst, but substantial enough for a cooler day, outside or in. Well done! Cheers!"
"I'm not sure how this one will do over time. I wouldn't quite call it balanced, but there is a lot of malt that makes itself known in this brew. If the hops should fade over time, I may find the sweet fruitiness not as unpleasant, and could grow to dislike the malty aroma if the hops wasn't as present. But I doubt I'll have trouble finishing my bottles while fresh."
"Then the taste when very bad. The hops were gone, the malt was not sweet, and the aftertaste was stale and grainy. The 22oz bomber was too much, 12oz would have been fine."
"This beer was a transparent amber in color with a short tan head. The smell is hoppy and sweet. It has a really nice aroma. The taste is malty and hoppy at the same time, very nice balance. The hop flavor is slightly bitter and grassy. This is a pretty good beer! This is now my favorite Boulder Beer brew."
