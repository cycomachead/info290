Hints of butterscotch and caramel, and the bitter hops really kick in nicely as it warms for a really well balanced English IPA. Extremely smooth and slightly chewy with a nice bitter, dry finish. For me, this is the definition of a perfect session beer. Full flavored but not extreme. Had no idea this was a seasonal brew. I'm kicking myself for only getting one of these.

It's malty, caramelly, and moderately rich and well melded--much like the London Pride, only with nice hop additions. Hops adds a nutty, grassy, woodsy, bitter characteristics. Still well devised and well rounded. Very balanced finish. Smooth, creamy, and full to the palate. Not as drying as I would have thought.

Smell is quite nicesolidly malty with a musty, floral, decidedly English smell. Its not a typical IPA. Very doughy and malty, but also notably bitter. I really like the sweetness and the full, round malt character. Its a welcome change from the American style IPAs. Full and somewhat soft mouthfeel.

3.9,-0.5,3,3,4,4,5,"Pours with an off-white head about half an inch deep and a few lines of carbonation. Beer's color is a uniformly very dirty copper, yet almost transparent; not much of a change in the highlights either. Smell is initially very sweet and caramelly or suggestive of sugar-frosted barley hulls. A somewhat soft, earthy/weedy hop element is also present, but very subtle. I'm sure this is well within the expectations of an English rendition of the style, but my Americanized sense of smell just demands more aggression in the hop department. Nosefeel is refreshing but thin and indistinct. Thankfully, there's a bitterness in the taste that emerges in mid-swig to offset a deep, earthy sweetness. This is actually quite nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is wet and medium in body, consistent from sip to swallow, and with a perfectly timed aftertaste. Once you've had your taste buds ripped out by an American Double IPA, this will seem very tame, but this gets outstanding marks in drinkability for just that reason. A fine session beer.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Aug 23, 2004"

The aroma is intriguing but I'm unable to put my finger on the aromas other than hops. It has other hints. The taste is of a bull-bodied ale that is more bitter than most pale ales. There is a definite flavor of caramel in amongst the hops and other grains. It feels great in the mouth, being more full-bodied than almost any pale ale I've had and goes down real smooth. I will be adding this to my drinking list, and will be trying other Fuller's.","rdrummer","Dec 27, 2003"

All of these flavors were gentle, which probably explains why I had so much trouble deciding what they were.

Color is good, a nice pale golden yellow, small off-white head with some spotty lace. Smells of fresh sweet malt and grain with hop note present, very clean. Taste is mild or "paled" if you will, of hops with a perfectly balanced caramel malt making for some smooth drinkin. Feel is solid medium body and slightly dry with a very weakened bitterness.

The smell was not at all hoppy. Instead it had a clinging buttery nose with characteristics of sugar and sweet fruits such as apple and plum as opposed to citrusy ones. The taste was finely balanced between hops and malts with a little bit of a wheat taste peaking through at times and some notes of caramel and apple.

The aroma and taste are nothing special, but good. Smell is not too strong but inviting, with a characteristic english bittersweet hoppiness and nice caramel maltiness. The taste is rather bland at first, but the bitterness kicks in in the aftertaste, leaving a nice zing on the tongue. This is not an IPA for a "hophead", . Not worth the price at all.

The taste was very refreshing, a whole bunch of hops basically. The floral hops are the only ones I could pick out, but I know it was more complex than that.

But the real interesting thing here is the way in which, even within a great balance, the sweet, malty elements and the hoppy, bitter elements remain distinct, seemingly taking turns asserting themselves. There is an obvious bitterness that runs through this beer, very appropriately showcasing the distinction between and IPA and a pale ale and making for a very quaffable, nicely bitter ale.","Riggo","Feb 26, 2003"

Caramel malt provides nice balance against the hops, but the malt is not as "chewy" or complex as some of the domestic IPA's. Not that it's bad, just different. In fact, I'd call this the most refreshing IPA I've ever had. If you've only tried American IPA Pacific Northwest hops monsters, try this one for a change of pace.","johnrobe","Feb 23, 2003"

Aromas of caramel and honey mix in harmony with the luscious, soft hops. There is a tiny touch of diacetyl that melds well, not overwhelming the hops unlike what you taste with some IPAs. First taste is a soft bittersweetness. The balance of clean, sweet malt with light and clean malt is near-perfect. The hops bitterness slides smoothly into round and almost oily fruits. Perhaps not what the English drinker expects from a traditional IPA - much more like what one tastes in American IPAs but none the less very much to my taste.","SamuraiJack","Feb 09, 2003"

Malt is sweet and bready. The taste... wow, this is a tasty beer! Very hoppy in that subtle English way, but also very malty. The hops are very spicy, with a very crisp bitterness that makes your tongue tingle. The malt is like buttered bread, with very sweet butter. There's an underlying graininess as well. At the front, hops are dominant, but in the back, malt takes over. Back to hoppy for the finish, crisp and dry. Excellent English IPA. I'll have another, please.","hyuga","Jan 28, 2003"

Very hoppy nose, very floral, very earthy, with fruits more in the background, and a bit of that famous English sulfur. A properly English IPA. The malts come out and introduce themselves first, before the hops come riding over the top. As the sip hits the tongue, there is a malty surge, with just a twinge of hops. However, as the mouthful continues, the hops swell up, and by the aftertaste, they have driven the malt off, and you're left with a nice hop tingle in your mouth.

Aroma is hoppy and citric, though not so much as to completely overshadow a strong biscuity malt character. Diacetyl lends something of a buttery note to both the aroma and the flavor -- easy to miss but hard to ignore once you've noticed it. Not a bad thing at all, as it contributes, I believe, to the smooth character of this beer in the mouth. Flavor is big on caramel malt, with an oily hop presence throughout, leading up to a pleasingly but not overdone bitter finish. Medium-mouth with crisp carbonation really contributes to the overall experience of a very clean, sharp IPA. Very drinkable.","mzwolinski","Jan 06, 2003"
3.97,1.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Light copper in color with a head that quickly diminishes. Aromas are of toasted malt, and fruity, some-what citrusy hops. The flavor starts off with a sweet toasty malt character, but that lingers into a crisp, dry, bitter finish. The bitterness also lingers with you for a bit in the aftertaste. Overall there is a good balance between the malt and hops, with the hop bitterness just outweighing the malt flavors. Not overpoweringly bitter as many American IPAs are.","BeerBuilder","Dec 08, 2002"
3.48,-11.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"pours a clear deep amber color, big white head that clings to the sides of my glass. Strange malty caremel aroma, light mild hop flavor, watery thin mouthfeel, nice english IPA, seems a really light on the hops.","maxpower","Dec 06, 2002"
3.3,-15.8,4,4,3,3,3,"Nice, sweet, fruity,light, but too, too dissappointing!","feloniousmonk","Dec 01, 2002"
3.68,-6.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"It's nice looking and has a foamy white head leaving lace all the way to the bottom. However, both the smell and taste are a bit underwhelming for an IPA. Certainly it's in a complete different ballpark from most designated as IPA in the U.S. It's not bad, but it's not one of the best offerings from Fuller's in my opinion.","mickeymac","Nov 17, 2002"
4.05,3.3,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"The pour is a clear amber color, the head mountainous, the lace thick sheets that cling mightily to the glass, both a light beige color. The nose is malt, slight hints of yeast and quite clean and fresh. Front malt, lightly sweet, top is skimpy, the finish is minimally acidic, basally hopped, the aftertaste droughty. The archetypal "English IPA, "NO" this is not bad, and sometimes its nice to sample an IPA that is not over the top with "Hops", yes even us "Hopheads", like a change.","Gusler","Nov 05, 2002"
3.92,0,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Reddish gold color with a thin head. Hops very present in the aroma, but not so much in the flavor. As a matter of fact this was much more malty than I was expecting given the tart hoppy aroma. The flavor was uncharacteristically malt imbued. It may have been off the mark for the typical IPA but it was still a good beer. The fact that I scored a case of these for $12 didn't hurt either.","Dogbrick","Oct 31, 2002"
4.1,4.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"A very intricate and complex ale where flavors assert them selfs rather aggressively. Instead of the transatlantic cable, we should have done a transatlantic pipeline to get this stuff here in large quantities.","BeerBob","Oct 22, 2002"
3.97,1.3,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Well, it isn't your oridnary American style IPA, but it certainly isn't a horrible one. I'm able to see right through this copper colored ale that poured with a decent head. Nice balance on the taste. Not overly hopped up like the American IPA was, yet not disturbingly weird tasting as is common with English-style IPA's. Fuller's is one of the breweries that have yet to give me a bad beer. I'll definately keep this one on my 'must drink again' list.","sinistersteve","Oct 12, 2002"
4.3,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Slightly hazy, orange/amber in color, with a creamy white head that settles shortly but leaves a good collar and light surface covering as well as some very good lace. The aroma is mainly of a gently sweet caramel malt and earthy/mineral hops (Fuggles?). The body is medium with a very fine, moderate carbonation. The taste is somewhat fruity, with a lightly sweet caramel & toffee maltiness that's infused with rich hop flavor, and backed by a solid bitterness. The bitterness is bold, but not overwhelming, and at times the hop flavor can become gently minty when combined with the sweetness of the malt. The finish is dry with a lingering malt and hop note. The alcohol is well hidden. Very well balanced. A bold flavorful beer that has alot of finesse. It puts out alot of hops and malt, but maintains a high level of drinkability because it knows where to stop. Exceptional. Highly enjoyable.","NeroFiddled","Sep 21, 2002"
3.36,-14.3,4,3,3,4,4,"Found this beer to be ok.  Poured out to an average and expected color but with with little or no head.  It looked flat but didn't taste flat, so I don't think it was a bad bottle.  It had a good balance of hops and malt, but I think overall it was not the best representative of this group.  I personally prefer Smith's although some may disagree.  It is, however, very drinkable.","doho95fu","Sep 19, 2002"
4.1,4.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Nicely drinkable, good hop flavor. Balanced yet bitter, but not Pacific Northwest bitter. Nice, spicy aroma of hops as I would imagine it would have been in the days of the British Rajah. Yum.","EagleTalon","Aug 21, 2002"
4.35,11,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is one tasty brew.  The aroma is light, floral, and enticing. However, this is not a floral IPA like many American IPA's.  Really nice balance of maltiness and hops.  Superb mouthfeel and flavor.  I think this is an excellent brew, I could drink this as a session brew easily.  One bottle leads to another due to its inviting, interesting taste. Loved it.","LarryV","Aug 11, 2002"
4.25,8.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"It poured with a burnt orange/copper color and thick head that left excellent lacing.  The hoppy bitterness of the aroma is at an appropriate level.  The taste is outstanding, a little less hoppy than other IPAs.  An excellent brew if you like a lighter IPA.","ryanocerus","Jul 25, 2002"
4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice color, smooth combo of hops and malt. Not quite as hoppy as I like but still quite good for the hot day. Is a less hoppy pale ale less filling? Seems so to me. When I can't get to my favorite brewpub, I'll buy this.","MTMugs","Jul 21, 2002"
4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Fullers IPA pours a nice clear copper color, with an off white lace. On the nose is slight hop aroma, and slight caramel maltboth are fairly mild. On the palate the hops and malts were balanced well, biscuit, slight bitterness, some fruitiness as well, and caramel flavors. Very good IPA, I enjoy a slightly more mild IPA sometimes opposed to a Hop devil which seems to go better with a meal.","WilliamPhilaPa","Jul 21, 2002"
4.45,13.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Not a bad brew, although I was a bit disappointed. The color was a nice copper, and the head was thick and lasting. The aroma was a wafting hoppy experience, to say the least. There are definately hints of sweet yet earthiness in the flavor. I agree with Jason on this one, I need to have this one in my fridge more often as well. Prost!","goindownsouth","Jul 11, 2002"
3.71,-5.4,4,3,4,3.5,4,"A very good beer as are all that I have tried from Fullers.  Nice copper color and a very faint aroma.  The hops could be a little stronger in my opinion, leaves a good lace down the glass as you partake.............................CHEERS","tigerpaws","Jun 29, 2002"

4.42,12.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"pours out a dark copper color with a beautiful frothy, sticking head.  smells of caramel apples dipped in butter.  i'm drooling.  tastes of caramel malts, with an assertive english/earthy hop bite.  mouthfeel is all smooth and buttery.  this stuff is decadent.  an ale brewed for the senses.  not over the top in the american IPA tradition, but delicious without being loud and obnoxious.  yummy stuff.","budgood1","Jun 01, 2002"
4.7,19.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Fuller's has done it again.. From your first sip to the last drop this IPA is incredible. I was so taken in by the copper color to the hops  that grab you right away.","Reverand","May 21, 2002"
4.25,8.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Love those Fuller's bottles. If poured correctly the teardrop neck will slam the last half of your brew into the glass creating a nice tight sticky head. Trademark Fuller's nose. Beauty earthy hop flavor balances well with a mild toasty caramel malt backbone. Finish is hop bitter lingering inviting you to start the cycle over again. Nice modern English IPA, but considering the price I'd go Sam Adams IPA which is nearly as good and probably fresher.","inebrius","May 17, 2002"
4.35,11,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Fuller’s IPA:  Imperial pint bottle, thick, brown glass.  Very nice looking beer, with a firm hop aroma.  Excellent, flavorful beer, with pronounced hops throughout, supported by a light level of malt sweetness.  Long, long lingering aftertaste with hops.  Highly recommended.","jackndan","May 12, 2002"
3.25,-17.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Light copper color in hue w/ a light haze.  The mediocre head settles quickly into a thin layer.  The very earthy, rustic and leafy Fuggles hop nose upfront is followed by slight nutty, biscuity notes.  Fruity, pear - like yeast esters are mild but detectable.  The body is fairly light, while the hop bitterness is quite mild for style.  Hop flavor is not unlike the hop nose-- rustic and earthy, but borderlining of being a bit course.  Malt flavors are light, toasty and a bit unexciting.  The finish is dry, clean and comprised solely of hop bitterness.  For Fullers, this is a most underwhelming brew.  It's way too tame for an IPA, but drinkable as is nonetheless.","marc77","Apr 09, 2002"
4.27,8.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Same bottle as my journal article...full, sub amber color, head full in the middle and effervescent at the edge. Very assertive initial impression, hops are subdued and more berry/flower like. A sense of candy cane peppermint mid mouth that's very pleasant. Nice smell on sip. Finishes smoothly yet diminished. Malt is tasty and balance is excellent. Very drinkable but unlike many American I.P.A.s....nice...","ADR","Mar 18, 2002"
3.78,-3.6,2,4,4,3,4,"Smells like caramel and freshly cut apple.  Dark amber, head quickly dissipates into a thin layer, then after more time, into nothing at all.  Sweet, malty and bitey.  Has a lingering malty aftertaste.  Faint bitterness.  A good beer, but not very complex and lacks character.  Was this beer abused in shipping and storage?","Jordan","Nov 27, 2001"

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"More malty than other IPA's.  For those who like a smoother, less biting IPA, this is the one.  Personally, I kept thinking it needed more hops.","Brent","Aug 25, 2001"
5,27.6,5,5,5,5,5,"A great unique tasting beer. Very malty, decent hops, unlike american IPA's.  For those of you who like your ale smooth, you can't go wrong with this ale or most other british beers.","Mark","Jul 14, 2001"
4.3,9.7,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Notes: Following in the greatness of the ESB, this is a great beer but definitely a modern day English IPA. A beer I’d prefer to see in my fridge more often.","Jason","Jan 22, 2001"
