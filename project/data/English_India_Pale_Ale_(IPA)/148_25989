It pours a clear amber colour and white head that quickly dissipates. The bottle I poured it from (into glass of course) had a spider Web effect of bubbles inside that I don't see to often so I expected some lacing on the mug. Very hoppy aroma had me assuming that it would taste like a U.S. west coast IPA but I was surprised that the hoppiness didn't come across strong in the taste. Earthy, grassy, slighty citrus has me loving this beer. Goes down smooth, real nice.","vikinggary28","Feb 20, 2015"

It was hard to separate brewer’s intent and drive for authenticity from presentation at this particular establishment.  We never found it to be skunky, per se, but it did have that dingy English pub vibe through and through.  The hopping was there, and surprisingly piney, while the malts were washed and simplistic, but clean in their body.  This was enjoyed in the company of new friends who we had been meeting here, and it served its purpose as a nicely sociable, approachable beverage, without becoming overwhelming time-consuming or attention-diverting.","TheBrewo","Feb 03, 2015"

This stuff pours a clear brass-amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam.  The nose comprises pine sap, grass, light flowers, caramel, toasted toffee, and mild biscuit.  The taste brings in more of the same, the pine leaning toward a resinous needle character.  The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish.  Overall, a pretty nice IPA, though the resin is a touch much.  Still, the rich malt backbone helps to balance this out a bit.  This did work nicely with my chicken club, though...","TMoney2591","Aug 10, 2014"

Nice nose of light pine hops, mostly spruce but also a floral note, over a slightly sweet malt background. The body is on the high end of medium with just the right level of carbonation. Mouthfeel is smooth and just shy of slick. The flavor profile is quite nice and complex. It begins with caramel sweetness over a light spruce hop flavor, effervesces into a light bitterness with floral notes and finishes a bit tart. The finish itself is a blend of caramel sweetness and hop earthiness that lingers against a light bitterness over a background tartness. An outstanding ""twist"" on an IPA.","tillmac62","Jan 28, 2014"

Smell is of malt, slight citrus, and some earthy and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a slightly smoky flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

There was a high level of sediment in the bottom of the glass. The thistle, which my assumption of the contents of the sediment, looked like yardwaste. Despite these oddities, the beer gets better. A heavy floral aroma leaps from the glass. The thistle is apparent. The initial taste is malty and mildly hops. The hops do not overwhelm, making this seem as though it is not a real IPA. The floral effects from the thistle stand out, giving the beer a tea-like quality. A note of lemon reinforces the tea hints, giving the impression of Lipton Tea with lemon. The flowery citrus hints continue in the aftertaste with the tartness of tea lingering. I am not sure I would need to drink this again, but it is a unique experience.","JohnnyHopps","Sep 29, 2012"

Taste begins with passion fruit and mango, followed by a rich caramel, bready middle, and a nice bitter grapefruit finish. The signature Belhaven yeast flavor is here and works out wonderfully in my opinion. Rich mouthfeel. Overall a wonderfull IPA.

The taste is dominated by the sweet caramel malts with the apricots from the nose really coming through as well. Bitter hops and a hint of pine balance it out nicely. I'm also getting a touch of buttered squash in the finish. Nice chewy, tangy, bitter mouthfeel that's slightly sticky and very drinkable.

However, there is a noticeable skunkiness to the beer that I just can't get past. (Unfortunately, bringing down the score slightly) Medium bodied, the beer has a smooth dryness , yet noticeable hop bitterness & an almost creamy carbonation.

There was a flowery, mildly citric hop flavor on the tongue. This represented (for me) a welcome bridge between too-mild English IPAs and over-the-top-hoppy American IPAs. Hello, Goldilocks!

It still tastes pretty fresh as there is no signs of oxidation or cardboard flavors. Honeyed, grainy malts seem to be more than just a backbone here, they are close to being the dominant flavor. Still a fairly enjoyable beer to drink but it needs to be more than merely balanced to warrant the IPA nomenclature in my book.

The head fades rather quickly and leaves a good amount of lacings. The aroma is mostly malts, some yeast, and floral hops. Taste is sweet maltiness with a firm earthy but balanced bitterness. The richness of the malts is way more than typical American IPA's. I suspect this beer may be a bit old and as there is no obvious date I wish I could try it from a keg sometime.

The flavors started with a flash of caramel malt immediately followed by a blast of hops, hints of citrus rind and tart apples behind which was a bready, malty backbone.

The beer pours amber in color with a big pillowy head that had decent retention and lacing. The aroma is caramel malt, biscuit, and a little burnt sugar. Medium bodied as it moves across the palate. Sweet malt flavor up front morphs into biscuit in the center before finishing bitter. The slightly dry bitterness lingers for a few moments before dissipating away. This is a respectable brew.

Notes of menthol mix with pine, a touch of bergamot and even a hint of cinnamon to form the dominant hop flavors. The body of this beer is quite light, this could definitely be a sessionable brew if it wasn't for that cheesy note. The cheese character really is quite subdued in the flavor (just so long as you aren't particularly inhaling as you take a sip of this brew) and is only noticeable at times.

Big, beefy aroma for an English style beer, with some funky/earthy hops and smoky malts coexisting uneasily. Minty aromas crop up as well. On the tongue, robust pale malts (smoky flavors mixed with caramel malts) bump up against a surprisingly bitter and acidic hop attack. Some nice bready flavors come out toward the finish, along with some metallic notes. This IPA has a lot going on -- lots of different flavors and sensations. Mouthfeel is brash with hop oils, big carbonation, and thick malts. Overall, this is a rather Americanized version of an English IPA, but it's still a good beer.

The brew poured to a orange to copper color with a fair sized head that surprisingly had a good amount of retention and did leave a fair amount of lacing down the whole side of the glass. The aroma was nice, clear hop scent but it was not overpowering at all. Also was able to pick up a biscuit scent that seemed pretty strong which seemed to mute the hop aroma. For some reason this is what I have grown to expect from a English IPA, more rounded out than our American brews that seemed to be serious hopped up on hops. Either way I love both styles and am not sure that the differences are just something that I am perceiving or not? Anyway, back to this brew, the taste was very good as it has a smooth quality to it. A strong hop taste is noticeable up front but not sure if that is because I was expecting it from the scent of the brew. It did seem to break away from a dominant hop start to have a nice malt flavor in the middle.

Bready and lightly caramelish malt acts as the base of the flavor, but it's quite fruity above that with both yeast character and hops kicking in notes of apple, orange, apricot, and both dark and light raisins.

The body is medium and smooth, leaving a medium finish and it's overall quite nice with good usage of the hops. One that I may revisit at some point.","mmmbeer","Sep 05, 2006"

The taste is well-balanced with sweet malt & fruit flavors balancing the soft hop finish. The hops are soft and rather mild without floral or grapefruit/citrus aromas or flavors. Suprisingly creamy and textured in my mouth. Smooth and yet crisp, pairing nicely with my pasta in a spicy tomato sauce. Flavorful and well crafted but not overly unique or special.

The nose is moderate in intensity, with caramel and toasty malt notes dominating, with a crisp lightly citrusy and mildly earthy hop. I like the mild hopping with the malt forward for the English IPA. Flavor is very nice. Definately reminds me a bit of the Belhaven Scottish with the peated malt character being very prevalent in the first sip. The caramel character is much more subdued. Hop notes are light citrusy sweet, but definately not a dominant part of the flavor. The finish is a nice combination between a good peatyness and a clean caramel sweetness. Feel is on the fuller end of moderate, with very mild carbonation. I like the fullness, as it gives me a feel of having a nice substantial brew. Overall, I enjoy this one.

The aroma has a perfumey, lightly citric hop smell with an underlying sweetness. Enjoyably subtle. A sip starts with a the perfumey/citrus hops. The flavor is somewhat milder than expected. Towards the middle of a sip the flavor is lacking, then a strong bitterness takes over. A dry hop flavor comes in at the finish. I'm wondering if I got a bad bottle or something, the rest of Twisted Thistle's reviews are glowing, but I found it bland and lacking malt balance. Plus the hop flavors didn't wow me either. This is definently something I'll try again down the road just to see if I was missing something great.","Gagnonsux","Oct 29, 2005"
4.48,22.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Overall Impression: Wow, this one is different. Not over the top -look at me-look at me- different, just a lot of subtle notes that werent expected. They all fit together very nicely and have me thinking about trying to brew a Smoked IPA. Have to give this one a strong recommendation, good taste, different direction. Bravo!","HardTarget","Oct 28, 2005"
4.35,18.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A strange mouthfeel sensation with this one...a very ""powdery"" character. It's hard to explain, but caught me off guard. Don't get me wrong...it's not bad in any way. It's different. Nice level of body and the carbonation is right. Relatively low ABV. Very flavorful and one I'll purchase in the near future (if only to send to AKSmokedPorter, as I know he wants to try this one). I drool at the thought of trying this on cask.","OldFrothingSlosh","Oct 27, 2005"
3.96,7.9,5,4,3.5,4,4.5,"Lo, and behold, a Scottish IPA and a fairly well-done one at that! Citrusy hops fill my nostrils as I quaff this golden ale. The flavor of hops is present, too, mixing well with an almost sticky sweet maltiness, accented by a wisp of smoke. The finish is more spicy then bitter and the lack of an assertive bitter finish is a bit disappointing. Overall, this is a very drinkable IPA and I applaud the Scots for experimenting with American hops.","marcobrau","Oct 20, 2005"
4.3,17.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Mouthfeel is soft, smooth and medium. A very drinkable, sessionable English-style IPA. I tried this earlier on-tap and found it rather plain but the bottled version is far better, much cleaner and vibrant. I could easily session this, but only from the bottle.","assurbanipaul","Oct 12, 2005"
4.62,25.9,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability: Probably my favorite british IPA to date (besides the 1800 that was brewed in Minneapolis). Very good, try it, you american hophead.","TastyTaste","Sep 28, 2005"
4.42,20.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"On draught, I recall this being rather ordinary, more bitter but tasting more like an ordinary American IPA. In bottle, it's definitely a Belhaven beer, with similar yeast and malt character, except with more hops. Top notch beer!","allengarvin","Beers"
4.3,17.2,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"A very tasty IPA, an ingenious mix of U.S. and U.K. takes on the style. For a brew with a tongue-twister of a name, this is amazing easy to love, for a hophead like me, and will easily leap into my must-buy list.","feloniousmonk","0"
3.78,3,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Medium amber, orangey, and essentially transparent. Tight white foam at over 1/4 of an inch. Sudsy complicated laces, nice-looking. Aroma of fresh hops (Cascade and Challenger), almost citric with grass elements. Lighter body and medium carbonation. Malts are not really identifiable, give way to hops early in the profile. Bitterness builds, senses of rind and the teeth chattering pith (even approaching a too harsh graphite character). A little unidimensional and even ""North American"" but no signs of oxidation or papery fade (but there is a slightly off cheap cologne impression in later sips). To its credit, the flavor is stubborn and holds on well. A pretty decent rendition, just not a standout to my mind. Nice looking brew though.","ADR","0"
