A lot of great floral smells come through because of the hops. The taste has a hop punch up front and then a lot of great toasted flavors coming through. A very complex, yet approachable beer. Would definitely recommend for an everyday beer, or maybe a nice beer to start getting into IPA's with.","WhiteHillsStore","Oct 19, 2014"

Mostly malt in the nose....not a hop bomb at all. Taste was better than I expected after the lack of hop aroma. Caramel malt sweetness with a slightly bitter backbone...although lacking significant hop flavor. Nice refreshing beer. Perfect for the occasion as enjoyed by the horde.","FFreak","Aug 08, 2014"

It goes down great, but may leave you wanting more. By no means is it tasteless, yellow, boiled wheat by-product, but drinks more like a pilsner than an IPA. Harpoon makes great products, and this beer is no exception. Just know, it is not going be like a lot if the IPA's on the shelf nowadays. It's damn good on any occasion, great with any meal, best when shared with friends....or.....well, don't be a dick! If your hosting, the least you can do is serve beer. This would be a great beer to serve.","Symmes","Aug 06, 2014"

3.65,0.8,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,3.75,"Taste is a light start with pale malt and citrus hops, grapefruit and apricot, smooth bodied with a moderate carbonation and a lot of graininess. Overall a decently sessionable IPA, a bit more of a dry floral edge to it with a crayon type of character coming in, it does dry out and linger on with some of the maltiness. Has some earthy and dry bitterness, getting a bit more balanced by the malt toward the finish. There are better IPAs for sure but this one seems to work alright, a bit more of an English influence to it is quite evident, but the combination didnt hit it out of the park.","mick303","Jun 04, 2014"

After the pour the head is a couple of fingers tall but it falls quickly and to a thin layer of fine bubbles that lace nicely throughout the session. The bottle says IPA but my nose doesn't quite agree. The aroma is much more in line with a pale ale than an IPA with a lot of caramel and a bit of sweet buttery notes and very little in the way of hops. The taste too is ok, there is a good bit of bitterness up front and a lot of sweet caramel but really not much in the way of hop flavor or unique malts. The beer finishes with a bit of a metallic twang that i'm not too sure about either. Carbonation is relatively high and there is a decent amount of bitterness in there as well which is nice and overall its not too sweet and not too dry. Overall this is a decent sessionable beer, an IPA for people who dont like IPAs perhaps.","fank2788","Apr 25, 2014"

It has a great floral nose, however, it leaves you wanting more, not much, but wanting more. Considering all the IPA's that are out there, that really deliver a hoppy punch, Harpoon kind of drinks more like a lager. Delicious for all cuisine and all seasons. I rate it high because it is a great ""go-to"" if your local store lacks selection, if your local is on the eastern seaboard of course.","","Mar 26, 2014"

It's mild and less west-coast in style, but I actually really enjoy just taking a big woody, herbal-spice whiff of this one, but the taste does not deliver. A little boozy and thin, not a terribly pleasant or smooth bitterness. Overall, I'll take it if given no other IPA options, as it is solid and gets the job done, but it does leave me wanting more on the taste side of things.","thezach","Feb 04, 2014"

On its way down the glass, though, it does leave a hint of lacing. The aroma is a little odd, a little musty and also sweet. The taste has some slight nondescript hops flavors and a slight lilt of malt. There is a decent weight to body and it is fairly smooth. It's not terrible, but not one I'd go to again.","delta490","Sep 22, 2013"

Clear deep golden color with a decent frothy white head that persists forever. Earthy citrus hop aroma countered with plenty of bready caramel malt. Old school bitter citrus flavor with a fair amount of brown sugar read and caramel. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick almost sweet mouthfeel. After all these years this is still a pretty good IPA.","johnnnniee","Jun 22, 2013"

3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a very clean golden color, bordering on amber, and displaying light pinkish tints. The beers body is very translucent and particle free, but the head is tiny and nearly nonexistent, which is too bad. What bubbles do appear, appear to from a small scrim-ring around the glass and are an eggshell white. The lacing on the sides of the glass is spotty and quite slick, only staying briefly before they return to the beer. On the nose, the beer smells of grassy and hay-like hops with a good sweet and slightly stale bread malt base and a light citrus touch. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter with a great malty sweet playing alongside of it, but never fully meshing with the bitters. The beer begins with light caramel sweets and a faint bitter bite before the bitters open into a nice little punch with very slight citrus, grass, and hay notes. As the beer rounds out the bready malts build in the mouth to play alongside the bitters, and in the finish there is still a great bitter tingle with a fading sense of the bready sweet malts. Just as the beer drops down the throat there is very quick emanation of cereal malts, which quickly returns to the bready sweet aftertaste. On the mouth, the beer feels thin to medium in body, with a little tingle of fierceness from the carbonation, and a big bitter bite on the tongue. The mouth is left clean but for some slight saliva on the edges of the mouth and a bitter tingle in the tongue. Overall, this is a solid middle of the road IPA. It has a little more of a bitter bite than a true English IPA, but not nearly enough pine or citrus to be considered an American IPA. I think this is a terrific introduction to the world of hops and IPA’s, and definitely a recommendation for anyone trying to slowly convert someone else to the hops. The malts and bitters work beautifully side-by-side, but never quite mesh, which isn’t entirely bad. A great intro IPA, and a good beer that can be found outside of craft beer bars.","Maxwell","Dec 30, 2012"

Not sure what kind of hops are used, but the aroma does not seem to match the taste. The beer has a fruity sweetness. Bitter, yes, but not overly bitter and certainly not raspy like some of the continental hops. The combination is unique. Flavor is soft and pillowy compared to a lot of American IPAs. I like it, but it is certainly not typical. This makes the second IPA this week I have tried with unconventional taste/aroma. The other was Great Divide . The beer is immensely drinkable. Accessible for those just getting to know IPAs; but different enough to be interesting to the initiated. The texture is medium. Lower carbonation keeps it soft in the mouth as well.","chickenflea","Sep 07, 2012"

The hoppiness of IPAs has increased quite substantially. As a result, this is basically an APA. I'm trying to adjust my score accordingly. Regardless, it's certainly not bad in any way, and is very drinkable. If it deserves any bonus points, it should get some for being a gateway beer to IPAs in general. It's mild enough that it may inspire some to further explore the style. A few years ago, this beer actually helped me on my path... to finding better IPAs.","angrybabboon","Aug 25, 2012"

The head dissipates slowly, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. The hop aroma is more of the citrus variety with some sweet and biscuit malt coming through in the nose as well. The taste follows the nose. The hops bring the citrus flavors ahead of the biscuit malt backbone. There is some hop bitterness on the back end. The body is light with abundant carbonation.

It was a bit cloudy also It reminded me of Bud American Ale which has no noticeable hop aroma either . I don't recommend it.","dcrawlins","Jul 13, 2012"

3.88,7.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"a great ipa, enjoyed in a can for the first time today. pours crystal clear light brassy color, almost glowing in the sun, with a bigger than one inch off white head. smells like floral hops and english bready malts, balanced but hop forward. flavor matches. this is the classic summer ipa to me, its got just enough body to be an ipa, but its down easy with a drinkable but flavorful malt support cast. the hops are bitter but not challengingly so, just sort of crisp in the finish. also this is very well carbonated, lovely in the mouth. overall one of my go to summer ipas, so much flavor in a drinkable body, this is everywhere for a reason.","StonedTrippin","Jun 20, 2012"

4.16,14.9,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Poured into a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass. Full inch+ of off-white head that never completely disappeared throughout session. Copper, golden color that is completely and intensely clear. Nose offers bready malts, and faint hop aroma. Taste is malt and hop balance perfected, which is not exactly preferred in the American IPA style. So I'm not taking issue with the beer, just the genre that it's listed under here, according to BA's definition of an American IPA. The brewery brochure simply says it's an IPA, so this may be more accurate. Flavor is certainly floral, some definite cascade hoppiness, and finishes with an unexpected sweet/malty appearance. I can't put my finger on it, perhaps ?mead? which would go along with the floral nature to the beer. Mouthfeel, again, is lighter than one would expect from an IPA. If it were styled as a Pale Ale I may have given it a perfect rating across the board. All this being said, I more than thoroughly enjoyed this beer. So much so that I could drink it all day long. Beer substitute for water? Thank you very much Harpoon!","RyanGoodman","Jun 17, 2012"

This beer had good drinkability. it went down smooth, wasn't filling, and it wasn't too bitter, I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma, it was pretty good and fragrant, there were a lot of things going on and it turned out to smell pretty weed like which wasn't a bad thing with this beer and was actually one of the highlights. What I like least about this beer was the lack of hops in the flavor, more hop flavors and more bitterness would be much more appealing, but it feels like this was much hopier at one point and it tasted like the hops have faded so this beer might be old, but with no bottling date I can't be sure. I would buy this beer again if I can find a fresh bottle, I think Harpoon is available in Michigan, but I have only seen it once and it was their Winter Warmer and I haven't seen anything else from Harpoon since. I recommend giving this beer a shot if you are an American IPA fan. This beer was much better then their Winter Warmer, and I'm sure if it was fresh it would be even better, but as it stands out now it's pretty close to being an average American IPA, if it wasn't for the aroma, it would be below average. This wasn't a really impressive IPA, but it wasn't bad by any means, I would like to try it again and I would like to try more from this brewery to get a better feel for them, because as it stands now I am not that interested in them.","StoutHunter","Apr 08, 2012"

Aromas of pine, herbal, floral, citrus, grass, caramel, and a bit of honey sweetness. Decent aromas that are on the weak side. Taste of big pine, citrus, herbal, floral, caramel, biscuit, grass, and graininess. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of biscuit, pine, herbal, citrus, and grass on the finish for a bit. Some good malt and flavor balance with bitterness. Medium carbontion and body; with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Some prickly carbonation present as well, but it still drinks very smoothly. No alcohol presence in the taste or finish. Overall this is a solid and pretty enjoyable IPA.","superspak","Feb 26, 2012"

The palate is soft with some good pale and caramel malt flavors, with a back drop of estery fruit.

A little bready malt mixed with some unwelcome spice. The hops were not up front and the sweetness was not balanced with bitter. Not impressed, despite Leviathan being a great IPA.

Some critic and biscuits sweetness up front but it finishes with a citric bouquet of hops that rounds it out nicely. Decent carbonation and light to medium in body. Decent ipa but nothing really stands out about. Could make a good session ipa if the hop bitterness didn't build so quickly and in a bad way.","jtierney89","Nov 09, 2011"

Bitter hops flood the tongue, but do not over take it, the mellow malt smooths it out on the end, leaves a slightly bitter finish. Light-Medium on the body creamy and smooth, very easy to drink. Overall; This beer is a nice and easy session IPA, it doesnt have a dominate hop presence and thats what does it in for me. I need more hop out of my IPA than what this gives me, considering that, back to the drawing board.","gabedivision","Nov 07, 2011"

Very thin film of white head atop the brew. Light and green nose, with spicy notes throughout, and an overall blend of grapefruit and oregano. The flavor is caramel malt forward, with a roasted character, followed by grapefruit sweet and tart, and then ending with a flush of fresh, green, wet hops at the end, and peppery/all-spice highlights throughout.

Smell immediately hits me from the opening and probably the most appealing attribute. Steady flow of carbonation and some gentle lacing upon dissapation of most of the head. Smell is citrusy, maybe apricot and grapefruit pineconish. Taste ranges in the same area of smell with some mild maltiness. Only drawback is that it overall seems subdued. Like a hopaliscious beer trapped in the body of a light beer. Other than the watered down appearance/taste, overall it is a satisfying beer. I could certainly recommend this for a springtime session on the beach. Cheers.","jhtipton","May 17, 2011"

It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall I was not a massive fan of this one. If you like pine this is the beer for you...

Flavor was good but light on the hops for an IPA. Mostly caramel and roasted malt, with slight fruit notes. Hops are really only present in a slightly bitter dry finish.

Plenty of bready malt, general fruity sweetness, a bit of lemony/medicinal something that could be construed as hoppiness. Old bottle, possible?

The hops are slightly floral and fruity but very subdued, too subdued actually, and the caramel notes, the crisp malts, the English yeasty presence defines this beer much more so than the hops. That's not a good thing for an IPA to hand its hat on. Trying this next to a Stone IPA was a real eye opener. Sometimes beer reviews are best done in tandem with another beer of the same style. Let's just say that Stone killed Harpoon IPA, but that doesn't mean that Harpoon was necessarily bad. The beer is fairly light bodied, plenty carbonated, a touch drying in the finish, but nothing special in any category. It's okay, decent, drinkable, and that's all I can say.","albern","Jul 31, 2010"

The CAN read ""copper-colored", but it was a light copper for which I will extend the benefit of the doubt, with NE-quality clarity. No qualms with their mention of ""a floral aroma"" on the nose, however. Citrusy and definitely hoppy - that's how I like my beer from a CAN! Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a great hoppy spiciness on the tongue. What a welcome relief from some of my recent CANs! This both tasted like something and it tasted good, also. The finish was bitter, dry, and refreshing, just the way I like my AIPAs to be. I would definitely put this is my cooler, but it is sadly a limited test run in New England to see about the viability of CANning their beers.

I am amazed how mild this beer seems to me now but still tastes the same as I remember it too. Mild, tropical fruity hop notes and lightly toasted grain. The mild hop bitterness is well balanced by a sweet maltiness in the finish. On the leaner side of medium bodied with ample carbonation.

Appearance is solid with a nice head although aroma seems a little muted but that might be to the almost frozen nature. Taste and drinkability are all around solid as always, one of the best everyday IPA's available and the fact that it's now canned you can almost insure that this beer will be even more ubiquitous at almost every event in New England during the summer..which ain't a bad thing.

Taste isn't bad at all, some nice citrus hops with a moderate bitter kick, although the flavors just don't seem to meld that well in this one.

This 'poon pours to a golden slightly bronze tinged colour with a nice two finger micro bubble head. Smell is malty with a nice earthy hop. Taste of this brew is very well balanced, consistent throughout. The taste is a great blend of malts and hops with neither dominating. Probably one of the better balanced brews I have had. Doesn't bite as much as I expected for an IPA but that just makes it more drinkable.

Taking a sip, it is a nice balance of malt sweetness to hop bitterness. Feel is quite thin and carb is a little low. Overall it isn't bad but I feel cheated.

I'm not quite sure what it might be about this blend of hops and malt but I found the finish to be rather abrupt - I call it ""clunky"": it's a sudden dropping off of flavour and the substitution of a malty earthiness of sorts in the finish that lingers. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it's just a characteristic that I find in some brews from time to time. The body in this case is thin, not unlike a pale ale, although with more substance. With warming, there are more floral notes and a more bitter edge to balance the malt presence. Distinctive taste, interesting profile, not bad at all although restrained when compared to some IPA's these days.","ThatWineGuy","Mar 18, 2009"

You know you're drinking an IPA, but its not overpowering, very enjoyable. Taste is great, nice hoppy flavor, complimented with citrus undertone and a mild bitterness in the finish.

The malt flavor is too aggressive and tastes over-toasted. I love IPAs with malt flavor, but only if it works to balance the hop flavor. In this case, both flavors are too aggressive. Come on, Harpoon. Your Dark Munich Ale is so good! Everything else you make is so good! Maybe (with more care) this beer as a double IPA would work well? Although this doesn't bear that much resemblance to their Leviathan.

It came to me with about a 1"" thick head and the beer was a golden color. Long trails of carbonation stretched from the bottom of the glass to the top. Smells hoppy with some citrus mixed it, but the aroma was rather mild for an IPA. This particular beer came to me colder than I like, so I let is sit for a minute before continuing. The ice cold temp hid much of the flavor. Once it warmed up a bit, the mouthfeel was crisp and fizzy with a medium body. The hops come through in the taste, and it had floral and citrus hints. The taste is very well balanced and quite refreshing. Slightly bitter aftertaste. A very drinkable beer and I am reminded why I enjoy it so much. It went real nice with the spicy food I ate.","mtbbaboon","Aug 29, 2008"

Tantalizing honey color with very little visible carbonation rising. Nice citrus hops aroma with some soil like undertones of malt. The flavors were robust and straightforward, hoppy but not a hop bomb as is en vogue presently (despite the shortage!?). Medium body and light carbonation (could have pumped this up a bit). Easy to drink for an IPA yet varietly correct as the wine snobs say. *Special note about this beer* Those in the know say it has changed a lot over the years, becoming less and less edgy for mass consumption. Equally, it is said to be better in the bottle than on tap. A rare find in a beer. Pick up a sixer and try it out.","thekevlarkid","Aug 20, 2008"

The smell was a floral hop note for sure, with just the slightest element of the malt back noted. Taste? Man something about Harpoon brews, their water perhaps, but I did not enjoy this beer at all. After the obligatory hops all I was left with was a metallic bleh in my mouth. The hops were again floral in nature with just a touch of pineyness. The metallic element lingered in mouth and had me wanting to grab another beer or water to clean it out. I think I am done with Harpoon brews.","crayphish","Aug 11, 2008"

Taste consistent with nose with some slightly floral undertones, as well as a mild citrus quality. Light and effervescent mouthfeel with a mild carbonation burn and a light citrus astringency along the sides of the tongue.

It was almost as if this was a JV pale ale that wanted to be varsity so bad...Nice to have tried it but this will not sell well as an IPA around here, we know better.

Unfortunately, every place I've seen that carries it carries better beer. Oh well, it's worth it now and agian, and is a great gift for the novice who likes IPA but doesn't know the difference between Pale Ale and IPA.

A pungent pine signifies there are cascades in this beer. The taste did not disappoint, a bitter and hoppy brew we have here. Pine notes with citrus undertones confirms, yep, those are cascades! A slight malty tone followed in the aftertaste. The feel was fizzy, with a medium body. This brew is definitely a hop head's dream. I found it hard to keep it in the fridge, while waiting for the right time to want to sit down and review it. Glad it finally happened so I could enjoy this brew.","Jp7010","Nov 25, 2007"

The nose is malty/hoppy, not much citrus or pines in this one, and some caramel tones. The taste is a nice balance of hops/malts, nice little touch of bitterness/sweetness. Medium body.

It tastes fruity and hoppy and very light malt taste in the background. The good thing about this IPA is that this does not have a very acidy taste, very clean.

The finish has just a tiny little hops bite that really cuts through the flowery sweetness. The drinkability is a little above average, and I wouldn't mind having another one after this.

Moderately carbonated. Not highly aromatic, I pick up lemon and grass. Taste is quite similar, in that it doesn't really have much as far as a flavor profile, but doesn't taste horrible either. Mild-to-above-average bitterness that lingers a little too long in the finish. Crisp, and easy drinking. Nothing to brag about, nothing to turn your back to.

Citrusy hop flavors endure throughout, really kicking in after the initial malty sweetness fades. Finish is surprisingly crisp and long-lasting.

4.03,11.3,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a slightly amber golden yellow with effervescent carbonation and holds up a two plus finger heady that is creamy. Aroma is grapefruit and floral hops and reminds me much of DFH kind of IPA, that multi-hop aroma style IPA, with lots od dry hopping. Taste is definite toasted up front, with a fruity yeast character here, and it;s hoppy but with a genuine malt character more than a hop bomb alone, and the malt shows up in the finish as well. Unique and I dig it, really good, stiff competition for DFH 60 minute actually. Mouthfeel is too carbonated, and it's medium bodied. Overall, I'm not much of an IPA guy but for once an a while, but this is a favorite. This type of IPA which focuses on floral hops doesn't go too well with food, though, which is why despite enjoying them once in a while stand alone, I don't drink them all that often.","Liquids","Jun 24, 2007"

The initial flavor is very hoppy, with a nice bitterness, however a slight detection of alcohol exists, but this isn't abnormal for the style. It might need a little more bittering hops to balance it out more. The grain bill appears to be slightly weak as well, making the beer have a bit of a hollow body. Pretty good IPA overall, worth trying.","zymurgy4all","Jun 16, 2007"

A nice swirl of the glass brings it back nicely. Harpoon calls this a copper-colored ale but surpisingly I found it much lighter in color. Hops are strong and first on the palate. If you drink it slowly across the palate, sweet flavors are revealed. A vigorous froth in the mouth totally sweetens this IPA and releases all the wonderful malt flavors-Amazing! Hops are steady through to the finish. The belch from this IPA is heavenly as though I am generating essence of Cascade! This IPA has all that i love about them: killer aroma, generous hop flavor and the malt flavors to boot with a killer finish. very drinkable. Cheers!","ByTor2112","Jul 07, 2006"

A frothy, white head develops quickly and stays intact for a few moments before dissipating and leaving behind some nice lacing. Aromas of fresh citrus, juicy hops, bubble gum, grass, and pine; quite aromatic and yet not overpowering or fear-inspiring. The taste is loaded with juicy hops and citrus/grapefruit flavors, but not entirely unbalanced with a mild (but present) malt profile that grows over time. Refreshing and crisp, this beer feels like it is cleaning my tongue with every sip. The carbonation adds a touch of cream-like texture to the already silky and slighly oily mouthfeel. Very easy to drink and enjoy with a variety of dishes including Mexican cuisine and an assortment of aged cheeses.","jaluria","Jul 05, 2006"

5,38.1,5,5,5,5,5,"While many new IPA's have certainly entered the realm of Imperial or double IPA, and surely are jam packed full of flavor, I wonder how many reviewers remember when Harpoon was the only company that made one. And in 94 it was certainly more hoppy than any beer I had ever tasted. It still holds up as a great tasting brew. That unique bubblegum flavor poons' yeast spits out really sits well with the cascade nose. Really clean and fresh when in Boston. Hard to find a better choice when in the city, rarely disappoints. It seems to me that many newbie IPA brewers are just masking nasty yeast aroma or low boils or lackluster fermentation, with huge amounts of hops, alcohol, or residual sugar. To pack the flavorful punch of Harpoon into 5.9% and 42 ibu's is a testament to the brewers passion for drinkable beer.","mooner","Jun 16, 2006"

A soft white heaed forms, which slowly goes down the glass, slight visibility of carbonation. The strong scent of flowers and citrus, mostly of grapefruit, are the dominating aromas. The taste comes in quickly with a hit of malt, then the hops take over with a citrusy bitterness. The mouhtfeel starts very lite, but it gains weight as it crosses the palate. The hops leave a dry finish on the palate at the end. Overall, this is an average IPA, it is not a hop monster, but it does give that good hop flavor that IPA's are known for.

There was not much floral hops in the nose that I've come to enjoy from Highland's Kashmir IPA, this let me down quite a bit. The first sip was very dissapointing, but as the beer warmed up a bit it began to redeem itself. Toward the end I was able to pick up on enough hop and balanced malt flavor to make me feel better about this beer.

So around Feb i went back up and got another growler that was keged about 5 days before and it was nowhere near as good. Then I got a 12 pack and once again tasted different. I dont remember if the old Catamount brewery makes any of this or if they just do the 100 barrel but that might explain the change in taste.

This one is very clear, and there is a modest carbonation working up. The aroma brings a nice caramel malt base with a mild peppery and slightly piny hop. Its not overly complex, but it smells pretty nice. The flavor is right on with the aroma. There is a pretty strong caramel sweetness that is interrupted by a solid pine and lighter citrus hop. The bitterness is a bit rough, but it fades pretty fast into the sweetness. I find the sweetness to be a little over the top and out of balance. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Overall, this one is a easy drinking brew that could easily find its way into my fridge every so often. It would be a good change of pace to some of the standard IPAs we have around here.

Taste is primarily characterized by bitter floral/grassy hops almost balanced with some caramel malt flavors. Hops do not overpower in this brew, however, they are much stronger smelling than tasting. Mouthfeel is moderate to heavy carbonation, leaves a slight slick oily coating on the mouth and throat.

There just isn't anything to balance out this brew. I get very little flavors other than hop bitterness. Perhaps a little bit of lemon.

This beer alone catapulted me into the world of IPAs and amber ales that I enjoy today. From the second I removed the cap of this Ale I was immediately filled with a sensation of a beautiful spring day. The floral scents of this ale are awe inspiring, but not overdone. As I poured the beer into the only available pint glass left in the kitchen (beer was stored refrigerated and had a shelf life of less than one week) I was pleasantly surprised with the golden amber color and a nice thick head that stays around for a couple minutes but doesn't leave a lace like most macro beers do and can only compare to craft beers. The aroma of hops complemented the wonderful color of this beer and the taste was nothing short of climatic. The mouthfeel for a beer of this nature was extraordinary... by far the first beer that I was really able to sit down and enjoy. Since then I have tried the IPA with a barrage of foods and find Italian and Cajun cuisine complement the taste of this beer very well.

Hopfeel is minimal for an IPA, but still adds a soft bitterness to the finish and some nondescript coniferous notes to the middle. I'd take it over a macro any day and when I see it on tap I typically buy it, but I can easily think of 2 dozen IPAs I'd have before this.

The aroma offered is wheat or sweet hay with some hints of fruit (spicy orange). The taste is moderately bitter, not as hoppy as many IPAs out there, but the beer has a great deal of carbonation, balancing out the bitterness, making the beer extremely smooth and very drinkable.

The smell is a floral bouqet of hops, with a citrusy note as well, spot on for an IPA. The taste is pretty much dominated by the hops with a slight maltiness, but this is not so bitter as to turn away non Hop heads. You can detect many complex hops tastes with a floral, citrusy, and slightly resiny hop oil coating your mouth thats interrupted slightly by a caramel malt taste then quickly finishes with a light hop bitterness. This is really a fantastic IPA, that could be drunk for hours and in im opinion would be a good beer to convert someone to the glory of hops, as it is not so bitter as to turn people off but bitter enought to keep the hopheads interested","silver0rlead","Apr 21, 2005"

While the hops were a big part of the flavor, I didn't find that they were significantly bitter, which makes this beer very easy to drink, although the 5.9%abv limits this a bit.

There was no real dominating flavor but a big mix of estery hops, caramel malt, and a grainlike huskiness around the edges. The body was a bit thin and that hurt this beer a little.

It pours an amber color with a 1 finger head that made itself present for about 8 ounces. Nose is rather muted when compared to the celbrations. Some floral hops are present as is some malty sweetness. Taste wasn't the hop attack that I was expecting. This was rather clean and balanced with a caramelish malt background keeping the hops in their place. Nice medium body to this one too.

The mouth is prickly, yet smooth, with a heaviness to the texture that coats the mouth and tongue almost like thin syrup. There's definitely a sweet malt backbone here which does a good job of supporting the hops, which are present from the beginning. Definitely not a super-hopped brew, the flowery sweet and crisp bitter nevertheless determine the flavor experience.

3.63,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Tawny gold in hue, lighter in color for an IPA, minimal animation, largely clear in appearance. A white head of one finger in height topped the beer. The head retention was fair, after a moment it slid to a loose cap. The subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling well. The nose is very lovely, the hoppiness is apparent. But the fruity aromas really take this beer to the next level. Oranges, peaches, a trace of lemon zest, and some wild berries construct the marmalade fruitiness. The hops add some straight acidic notes. Overall the potency of the bouquet is solid and I find the total package to be inviting. The palate is very good; it is an East Coast IPA all the way. That is not a negative comment. The bitterness is moderate but fairly pronounced. The acidity is modest but the hops are pleasantly juicy. In the middle the fruitiness really sings, oranges and peaches mainly, a hint of grapes. That is a wonderful combination of fruit; now add in the hops yum. The maltiness is a tickle weak IMO, it doesnt really add much aside from a hint of caramel. Regardless the other aspects of this beer are very positive. Medium in body, somewhat low carbonation, it is natural and pleasing. The mouthfeel is good. I could drink this beer routinely, if it was available to me locally of course. It is simply lovely stuff.

The smell was of Hops and citrus fruit. The taste was lighter than I expected and not too bitter but the fruit taste was very well balanced and not as obtrusive as some other IPA's I've had. There was not much of a malt backbone, but overall I welcomed the lighter side of this IPA. Very enjoyable, spring time drink with a decent ABV and very drinkable. I believe I can find this brew in most stores on the East Coast so this will be added to the list as a nice, quick ""on the road"" brew.","Gasp100","Feb 28, 2004"

Nice grapefruit pith aroma, not overdone but solid for style. Body is slightly thinnish, malt has a hard time generating a presence before a slightly oily bittering kicks in. Hops start well, but not as big as many, and are helped by the aroma qualities. The finishing aspects are slightly metallic and the mouthfeel turns a little watery at the same time. Not bad, at least its not one of those hop cartoons IPA that are flooding the market. Malt and finish could be better.

Medium-bodied, and the flavor is surprisingly subdued given the strong aroma. There is a fair amount of malt in the flavor as well. The finish is fairly clean and bitter. Maybe it is the hop-heavy IPAs like Ruination, Buckeye '76 et al that are to blame but I like a higher level of hops than this beer offers, both in the flavor and in the finish. A decent beer nonetheless.","Dogbrick","Dec 09, 2003"

Pours out a medium gold, with an average head and moderate lacing. Floral hop aroma is pleasant, but doesn't knock you back like many American IPAs. Mouthfeel is just about right, medium carbonation and dry hops balanced perfectly with the malt. Taste is basically the same, impressive balance with notes of pink grapefruit and lemon. This is not an exciting or ""big"" IPA, but it is definitely a very well crafted, if toned down, American style pale ale. I'm impressed with its overall likeabilty.","merlin48","Dec 07, 2003"

The tiny head left its mark down the glass as it was devoured. Understated floral scents on the nose. The initial port like sweetness mellowed as the hops gently let themselves be known.

Taste is kind of like budweiser with a ton of cascades added to it. (I mean that in a good way) It tastes well-made with a beatiful balance to it that fades evenly. The only real malt character to speak of is a little breadiness and graininess. The feel is a little thin and fizzy. I felt like I could have drank about ten of these in a row. Pleasing in flavor yet light and drinkable. I have had this beer on tap and it is not nearly as good as the bottled version.

Can't say the aroma is amazingly memorable, but I can say this is a nice pleasant go to at this point very solid brew. The taste flavor is a mellow creamy balance of malty goodness blended with a floral bitter hop profile, I can tell that this beer is a little dumbed down from the guidelines of a typical IPA not getting the hop satisfaction that any true hophead is yearning for. Like I said not a failure but not a favorite at the same time. Mouthfeel is lighter in body with a nice chewy texture to it, not thick and cloying chewy just some pleasant and welcoming body to this beer.

Harpoon reminds me of Labor day when my parents and their friends would gather and one of them always brough a sixer of Red Hook and a sixer of Harpoon. The IPA poured a hazy summer yellow with a huge fluffy white head that had real staying power. Great head retention! The smell was very sweet and fruity with a little hint of medicinal hops. The taste was refreshing and dry, but lacked the real hop punch I look for in an IPA. Tart hops tickled the front of my tongue and then morphed into deep roasted malts fighting with peachy sweet hops and ended with a bitter hop finish. the mouthfeel was very buttery. This is a good standby, but nothing exceptional. Perfect summer beer.","GreatPondBrewer","Jun 08, 2003"

When I'd originally reviewed this beer, I noted how well-balanced it was, from a hoppy bitterness:malty sweetness ratio. The very same holds true with this version of the IPA. Everything just seems to have been toned down and mellowed. Mouthfeel and drinkability were fantastic. The differences in this beer from the cask and bottle are striking.

A medium body combines with a very fine-bubbled carbonation to leave it lightly crisp on the tongue. Floral hops and a sweet grainy malt swirl in a kaleidescope of flavor right off the bat!

4.22,16.6,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Crystal clear golden yellow beer with a nice head of pure white foam that leaves a good bit of lace. Aroma is full of hops with floral and grapfruity citrus notes dominating. Flavor was light hop bitterness, with a big dose of citrus hoppiness being right up front. Flavor fades through some sweet malt before a very fast dry finish.OK beer for the style, and at least it isn't one of those all hops all the time super beers.","MaineBeerMan","Nov 06, 2002"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"My first IPA, I decided to revisit it. Just the right blend of hops, not too overpowering make this copper colored beverage just right. Easy drinking, it can be a good ""game time"" beer. Glad I tried it again.","bewareOFpenguin","Oct 10, 2002"
3.68,1.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"A pleasant suprise from harpoon. A rich copper color with a creamy head. In the middle for taste but a good dry finish. Goes down very easily,a nice ipa to share with crossovers.","paceyourself","Sep 23, 2002"
3.97,9.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Harpoon's IPA looks like your standard issue American IPA. It's medium copper in color and possesses a sticky, clinging head that leaves substantial lace throughout the glass. The nose is predominantly hoppy, with a definite floral aspect. It tastes quite hoppy with a decent malt backbone, however for this style, my tastes require more hops and more malt. Mouthfeel is rather prickly and clean. It's easy to have more than a few of these, making this a good choice for a session beer. It's certainly worth a try.","Jon","Sep 02, 2002"
3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"although some ipa's have failed me, this one was pretty good. hoppy, but not to the extreme. i will say that this beer had a very intense flavor and mouthfeel. it had some kick with a nip on your tongue that you could never forget. harpoon seems to do that, and i find it unique. it is a great new experiece to have a harpoon","ElGuapo","Aug 30, 2002"
4.03,11.3,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Mmmm I have never gone wrong with an IPA and this is no exception. Beautiful fluffy head that stood well over the top of my glass, copper color. Very nice hop flavor, not that strong but you certainly can't miss it. Sticky lace all the way down. Extremely smooth, and an excellent mouthfeel, smooth and buttery. A great IPA.","IrishRedRock","Aug 22, 2002"
4.1,13.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Quite the easy drinking tap offering. A toasty malt spine holding up a well hopped bitterness, aroma and flavor. One could drink this all night, but the ABV might have something to say about that after a half dozen.","inebrius","Aug 10, 2002"
3.75,3.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Dark golden hue w/ a light ale haze.  Pungent dry hopped Cascade hop nose (not unlike fresh Liberty Ale) dominates, but a bit of generic caramel sweetness is there in aroma also.  Although hop bitterness dominates, yeast fruitiness & toasty malt are perceptible.  Light in body, but crisp and quite drinkable.  The hop flavor is expctedly citrus.  Finishes clean and bit dry.  A bit understated in malt for an AIPA and perhaps one - dimensional, but nonetheless is an enjoyable brew.  With a bigger malt backbone this would be excellent.  It's reminscent of a thin Anchor Liberty with more hop bitterness.","marc77","Jul 30, 2002"
2.3,-36.5,3,3,2,2,2,"A good IPA but not my style, serious hops from start to finish.  Clear, good head, heavy hop aroma.  Medium body and fairly dry.  Strong bitter finish.","jdhilt","Jul 25, 2002"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Slightly musty hop smell with a hint of citrus.  Very light color with a slight amber hue. It has a lasting white head.  It is very.. very carbonated.  Crisp hop flavor with a nice bitter finish.  It is very clean.. almost too clean but is quite drinkable for an IPA due to this fact.  The mouth is left very dry after tasting.  A very tasty IPA.  It is a clean and bitter brew with a dry hop flower finish.. Very sturdy.","frank4sail","Jul 23, 2002"
4.3,18.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"One of the best-balanced IPA's, particularly for an American style.  Up front, this is moderately sweet with a little resin in the hops.  The hops bittering in the finish is lingering at the back of the tongue.  Very drinkable, and one of the few IPA's that I would designate as having session potential.","Brent","Jul 11, 2002"
4.21,16.3,5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"My favorite beer for everyday enjoyment!  And especially beautiful and tastey on tap.  This is everything that Harpoon IPA is with a deep golden colour with a super-creamy, off-white head with tremendous retention.  Big rings and full coverage across the top.  Nice dry and balanced, slightly biting medium body with covert, but full, malts and complex and striking hops.  Drinks great for any occasion or situation.  Cheers!","BillyBrew","Jul 02, 2002"
3.8,5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A very well rounded IPA from one of my fav breweries.  But as one earlier post stated after trying others such as Pyramid and Sweetwater for me it had alot to live up to.  I would drink this beer again but there are other IPA's much better in my opinion...............CHEERS","tigerpaws","Jun 27, 2002"
4.13,14.1,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a nice light copper color with a thin white head that has some decent lacing qualities. Nice pungent, oily aroma. The hop explosion hit the palate first. And it is good. I would say this beer is more hoppy than it is bitter. There is a bitter element present, but more of the hoppy tones seem to make their way to my taste sensors. Flowery and herbal at the same time. A bit oily. Slightly pungent. After cutting through all of the wonderful hop nuances, you will find a decent malt presence. Nicely done IPA here.","Bighuge","Jun 26, 2002"
3.58,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"All in all, a decent IPA.  After having tried Pyramid and Lost Coast though, the bar may be a bit too high.  The color was a nice copper and there was a moderate hoppy aroma intertwined with some fruit and spice tinges.  The first sip is slightly disappointing, as one tends to expect more bang for the buck.  As you get to the middle of the bottle, and towards the end of it, this IPA tends to grow on you a bit.  Not the best, but not terrible, by far.","goindownsouth","Jun 25, 2002"
3.83,5.8,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"Had my first one of these tonight. It's a nice beer, and from what I've read, a pretty consistent one, which is a good thing. Just a few shades lighter than amber in color, with a fluffy white head that fades rather quickly. The aroma has me befuddled -- I can hardly smell anything. Allergies, maybe? Taste is more pronounced, though. Almost English in style, the hops are not over-the-top, but they're there. Nice mild citrus and a touch of pine. Smooth malt character provides a pleasant balance, and leads to a smooth, creamy finish. Not a standout necessarily; this is probably one of those beers that grows on you the more you drink it, so I'm looking forward to trying a few more.","mophie","Jun 07, 2002"
4.12,13.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Big bubbly white head over golden body. Nice lacing. Big hop aromas, lot of citrus. Much more balanced in taste than nose would indicate. More English than American IPA (except for the aroma). Which makes it more of a session beer for hopheads. Some postings/reviews seem to indicate that it has been dumbed-down, but this is still a fine beer.  Glad they still send large quanitites to New Jersey.","RonfromJersey","May 31, 2002"
4.18,15.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear bright golden color with a thick, bubbly, white head.  Smell is all hops and hop oil.  Some slight citrus and very floral qualities.  Floral hops explode onto the tongue but are then followed by some nice balancing malt.  Brew gets maltier as it warms.  Crisp and dry mouthfeel and extremely drinkable.  This is definitely one of my major fallback brews when I am home in MA.  Recently it has become very easy to get down here in VA, no complaints from me.  One of my all time favorite session brews.","Murph","May 26, 2002"
3.35,-7.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Slightly sour aroma, pours to tempting head, golden color (light for ipa). Good hop character: floral, bitter, stringy. Hops are what make the beer. Light fruity malts are understated, pretty mild character overall despite hop presence. Absolutely fresh, it can be quite good but if its more than a couple weeks old it'll be closer to average.","Thrasher","May 08, 2002"
4.6,27.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"This is the local hopmeister.  A deep rich amber color with a medium body and lasting thick head give this beer a good look, nice heavy hop aroma and powerful, yet mellow hop flavor profile.  Nice balance of malts with this one create an easy drinking libation.","beernut7","May 07, 2002"
3.95,9.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"It certainly does assault you on first whiff and taste. Had it last night for the first time and ended up carrying out the box this morning. Not that I was responsible for the whole thing. Hoppy as sin, kinda bready and skanky on the nose. Didn't hold a held but plenty of carbonation.","packetknife","May 05, 2002"
3.98,9.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The color is a medium-copper, w/ a small head which dissipates very quickly. Nice floral hoppiness  w/ bite on the mouth, excellent finish. I enjoyed this very much, a true English styled IPA!","WilliamPhilaPa","Mar 02, 2002"

4.07,12.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Updated to increase taste and drinkability, after a trip to Boston where I had this fresh at the brewery. This is much better when fresh and overall one of my favorite east coast session IPA's. Very well balanced, bright flavors and really quaffable.","bcm119","Nov 08, 2001"

3,-17.1,3,3,3,3,3,"This beer was really something at the onset of the craft brew movement and it's likely converted many a yellow beer drinker. It's still very good beer. However, with the evolution of American IPAs, this one comes up a little short. Maybe that's an unfair comparison since this probably is closer to an English style IPA. Even so, it's a little weak.","John","Sep 21, 2001"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"A pretty decent, all around good IPA. Plenty of hops and malt to match, with a nice alcohol kick. Unfortunately it's seems to be changing year after year, getting dumbed down for the masses and is nothing like the original Tod Mott recipe. Still, a solid favourite of mine and a nice backup beer.","Todd","Nov 01, 2000"
