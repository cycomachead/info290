3.68,5.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/6/2014. Pours fairly hazy/cloudy orange/copper color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a large amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, floral, grass, pine, light caramel, toast, biscuit, and floral/yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops, bready malt, and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, pine, floral, grass, light caramel, toast, biscuit, and floral/yeast earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pear, apple, pine, floral, grass, toast, biscuit, and floral/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Good complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops, bready malt, and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a good English IPA. All around good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops, bready malt, and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 26, 2014"

The flavor is citrusy without being over the top, and there is enough hoppiness and malt to be rewarding. True, it doesn't really come across as an IPA, and I think that's part of the problem: what is it, exactly? Honestly, I don't care - it's worth having on hand.","Isoruku","May 29, 2014"

At first, I was a little put off by the buttery component to the taste, but I took a liking to it once I opened a second bottle and actually find it interesting. The taste is less bitter than others of this style and it seems like an IPA that most will find at least acceptable. Give it a try and let us know what you think.","BryanCarey","May 04, 2014"

Some caramel and floral notes as well with hint of metallic flavors in the finish. Medium body and fairly highly carbonated. Not a bad IPA, certainly unique with nice flavors.

Nose isn't recognizably floral IPA like, actually showing more malt and sweet than anticipated for an IPA. Mouthfeel has lower carbonation for this bottle, but is fine in character, like champagne. Bitter notes are late, a sweet, not too dry note early, the echo of bitter notes not well extended. This won't last long for an IPA, which for an IPA is usually not the case, in its echo, I mean. Perhaps this is better considered a mild session ale, to my tongue the hop notes giving is a lower IBU if I were to guess. I wouldn't pass this up on tap, or at a party, but given other IPA's out there, I wouldn't take six.","Bitter_Echo","Oct 17, 2012"

But though it might lean toward being clean it does have hints of esters and diacetyl. The hopping is done to a bold US level. However it is not a cascade clone or super dank. It does have some citrus, but mixed right in with an herbal, earthy, resiny profile that is more UK. Nicely drinkable.","SickGnar","Dec 29, 2011"

There are also some scents of caramel, fruit, and some toffee. The taste follows the nose pretty well. It is hop forward and there is a sweet malty backbone. There are some other flavors of caramel, toffee, citrus, and some fruity esters. The finish leaves some lingering hop bitterness, citrus, and a bit of sweetness behind on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy, and it has a nice smooth quality to it. There is a good amount of piney hop bitterness here. Some sweetness is in the background, and it balances out the bitterness pretty well. The hop bitterness lingers on the palate for a bit. This has pretty good drinkability.

First and foremost, in the aroma, I smell that plastic-y, band-aid, chlorinated smell that I usually correlate with contamination or a hot fermentation. Also, the fact that it's overcarbonated means that it could be an infection. There is bitterness, but this is not a good tasting beer with characteristics that I like. If it's not contaminated, then this is a poorly made beer and either way, I recommend against buying and or drinking this beer.","Soonami","Oct 10, 2010"

Mostly citrus-style hops in the smell and taste, but not strong enough for my tastes. Near perfect mouthfeel from the cask, creamy and smooth with low carbonation, goes down like water.

Color was a hazy straw color with the smooth head of miniscule bubbles that is typical for a beer-engine poured beer. Aroma was virtually non-existent, and taste was only slightly more pronounced. It wasn't quite a widgeted can of Boddington's in terms of its mild-mannered-ness, but throw in some discernible amount of hops and you've got a pretty good approximation of my experience with this beer.

As it warms, it opens to a spicy orange character, sort of a marmalade effect. The flavor has an odd bite - a bit of smoke, a bit of marmalade, a hint of apricot, but of a bitter sort. It finishes with an herbal bitterness, almost like a musky rosemary. The mouthfeel is decently firm, but slightly over-carbonated, which highlights the spicy marmalade effect to bad effect.

Pours a nice amber color with a huge frothy head on top that leaves solid lacing as the beer drains. A nice surprise. Nose is fairly mild toffee malt, and then a touch of smoothish hop bitterness to close out. Flavor is similarly mild. Light caramel malt, light sourness (much milder than in most Arcadia offerings), and then light floral hop presence. A definite woodiness in there as well, as another reviewer noted. Overall, not bad (which is honestly better than I can say for a lot of their beers), and fairly in keeping with the English IPA style (although I could have done with a touch more hops). A solid brew that I could definitely have again.","soupyman10","Apr 09, 2008"

Hops are flowery and buried under the butterscotch flavor. Heavy carbonation leaves nice lacing halfway through. Not bad, but more an English Pale Ale than an IPA to me, as this beer seems to lack the powerful bitter finish of its namesake. Reminds me a bit of Fuller's London Special, but with more restrained hops and more diacetyl (too much). Perhaps some age on this one? I had the Arcadia Starboard Stout earlier and prefer that to this one. Have to give this one low marks on the appearance due to over-carbonation.","marcobrau","Mar 12, 2008"

The grapefruit and lemon twang of the aroma came through in the first taste, which had a slight malt character to it. The taste was merely plain to me in a light to medium body.

Earthy and citric in the aroma - nice, but could be more complex. Tastes of citric, piney, earthy and lightly spicy hops that contribute a medium bitterness atop lightly toasted malts; there's a touch of heat in there as well.

F-you, CT distributors. Citrusy hops, orange and lemon. Meek malt presence. The flavor opens with modest malt, pale and crisp, followed by gentle pear fruitiness and modest citrusy hop finish.

My first thought is Amarillo hops, but I'm sure they use Columbus in this. Really nice. Mouthfeel is good. Could maybe use just a touch more malt to support the hops, but the hops are not intense, just pure. Slight lack of balance keep it from being really drinkable for me.

The smell was rather mild in character with some spicy hops riding atop caramel malts. The taste was also lightly hoppy and mild in bitterness. The yeast did impart a peppery tang to the taste, making it a little more interesting. Malts were typical pale and caramel. Aftertaste was a little to metallic and mineralized.

This is a sharp, bitter tasting IPA. Most obvious are malt and hops. Followed by citrus. The bitter aftertaste here, is not what I expect from a British style IPA, but not as caustic as other highly hopped Americans. In the mouth Arcadia is crisp, and pretty highly carbonated.

First impression nice flavors in some aspects, especially at first (it gets a bit annoying) -- thick and malty but buttery with caramel. Its IPA status may be confirmed by aromatic floral notes that almost verge on candyish overall.

Smell is grassy with pine and citrous hops (lots of grapefruit). Some smooth malt, though not much, is present in the nose. Taste begins on a bland note, then fast forwards to some eye squinting astringency.

2.97,-14.9,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"Pours an orangish-copper with a rocky white head. Mild aroma of pine, grapefruity citrus, peach, cookie, & sugar. Caramel flavored malt base with moderate bitterness. Interesting blend of citrus hops with candied sugar & a soapy flavor that approaches unpleasant. Medium bodied with active carbonation. Finishes dry with spicy/peppery hops and some toasty malt. Not one I would seek out.","garthwaite","Jun 29, 2004"
3.95,13.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Like many IPAs, this one grabs me by the tounge and begs me to drink more. Wish I had some more, actually. Good stuff.","budsboy","Jun 26, 2004"
3.7,6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"A very interesting beer to look at, with fine sediment in suspension in the golden body. Thick head, left chunky lace as it receeded to a thin filmy covering. Piny, with a touch of malt as you stick your nose in the glass. The hop profile starts a bit watery, but ends nicely hoppy, with a good piney bite. Slightly tangy, it feels like drinking a beer, nothing too different there. Overall, a nice beer.","hustlemuscle","Jun 26, 2004"
2.9,-16.9,3,3,3,3,2.5,"Murky looking orange. Very thin off white head. Lacing is minimal. The aroma is very fragrant. Minty. Lots of bubblegum. Piney. Decent, but not exactly what I'm looking for in the nose of an IPA. The flavor is full of bubblegum. Some pine sap as well. A bit of an astringent bitterness. Malt base is primarily toffeeish and a little biscuity. This one is striking me as much better than average. And that's being generous.","Bighuge","Jun 12, 2004"

3.7,6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Great looking beer with golden body, slightly hazy with a bit of fine sediment suspended stirred up by my ham fisted pour. Very clean, pronounced hop aroma. Grassy, citrucy, and a slight maltiness in the aroma. Flavor is slightly malty with a healthy dose of hops. While the primary focus is on the hops there is an appropriate malt base. Well balanced and quite drinkable.","Sixpack595","Mar 30, 2004"
3.97,13.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Not a bad IPA from Arcadia. It's not an imperial monster, but just the nice everyday drinking type. I'd be happy to see Arcadia's beers in Western PA...someday, I hope.","beergeek279","Mar 22, 2004"
3.67,5.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, this struck me as a relatively likeable IPA but nothing awe-inspiring. The flavors didn't mesh as well as with other IPA's I've sampled. That said, this offering from Arcadia's is a mid-level entry in the IPA style.","Boilermaker88","Mar 15, 2004"
3.18,-8.9,3.5,3,3,2.5,4,"Poured a hazy orange color with a moderate off white head. Smell almost seemed bready to me. This was definitely a more balanced IPA. I think it is really more of a pale ale. Hops were there but faint. I noticed more caramel flavor and some buttery diacetyl. Hops seemed to provide a base and were estery and floral. This one was also somewhat thin in body. A good introduction IPA and nothing more.","granger10","Feb 15, 2004"

3.21,-8,2,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a orange/golden color with a white foamy head. Head lingers for some time. This beer was not cloudy, instead you could see a suspension of particles. Not a great look. Smells of citrusy hops. Tastes slightly sweet malt with a dry hoppy finish. Perhaps a little thin. Something about this just didn't seem right. Not a horrible beer by any means, but I was hoping for better.","Bierguy5","Nov 30, 2003"

3.95,13.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Arcadia IPA: Nice thick, clinging head that is slightly off-white. Hazy, nica tan color. This is a nice looking beer. The aroma is sweet and flowery, clearly nice hopped for flavor. And the taste is pleasant, and I've not been the biggest fan of Arcadia brews. Nicely hopped brew, not bitter but floral, somewhat citrus flavors as well. Very well balanced as well, there are nice bready malt flavors that come through as well. I enjoy this beer.","jackndan","Oct 06, 2003"
3.82,9.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a slightly muzzy deep amber color with the head portly in size, frothy in texture and a winsome tan color, lace is a thick and clinging curtain to obscure the glass. Nose is floral with a slightly musky malt backing; crisp and inviting, front is nicely malted, somewhat sweet and the top medium in body. Finish is loaded with the Fuggles hop spicy bite, crisply acidic and a fine example of an American IPA.","Gusler","Aug 13, 2003"
3.62,3.7,3,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Medium gold color. Medium head. Aroma is floral hops and malts. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are nutty and slightly sweet. Hops are floral and a touch resiny. Not too bitter for an IPA. Nicely balanced, slightly towards the hops. AH Fuggels.. Slightly orangish taste. Interesting beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Aug 07, 2003"
3.86,10.6,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This Michigan IPA pours a hazed copper color. A rocky head forms, leaving subtle trails of lace down the glass. The nose is lively with notes of fruity esters, citric Cascades, and very minor caramel malt. Taste-wise, pronounced Cascade and Columbus hops overpower what little caramel malt profile exists in this brew. Don't get me wrong, I love my hops, but this needs a bit more balance malt-wise. Finish is dry with lingering hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin due to the lack of sturdy maltiness. As a fan of hops, I could drink quite a bit of this, but overall, I think it's a bit too hop-heavy to be considered a classic. Very good, though, nonetheless.","Jon","Aug 02, 2003"
3.36,-3.7,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"A good part aftertaste, Arcadia IPA is a tough beer to love. But it's fun, so what the hell? Disturbingly spot-on in appearance, it's head is a magnificent exercise in grandeur -- thick, off-white, aromatic. Bitter citrus aromas. Lavender. Lacks malt character -- or any character really -- up front, but annhiliates the palate with a destructive hop endgame. If only it had more backbone or more flavor in the midpalate, it wouldn't seem so overwhelming. It's probably not, really. In short: Could be better, could be worse. The Michigan IPA to try if you're looking for something a little unusual. Never disappointing locally in terms of bottling or skunkiness.","marburg","Beers"
3.11,-10.9,4,3,3,2.5,3.5,"Deep hazy orange-copper color, huge frothy off-white head that clings to the side of my glass, sweet citrusy hop aromas, resiny grapefruit flavors, some what thin with a watery mouthfeel and a bit unbalanced it is lacking malt balance, finishes harshly bitter.","maxpower","0"
3.6,3.2,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Semi-clear golden bronze color with an average tight, white head that disappears quickly but nonetheless clings nicely. Distinct floral hops smell is pleasant but light, given its domination of the nose. Some lightly toasted malts are detectable as well. Hops are on the tongue from start to finish--more bitter than most IPAs I've had. Citrusy flavor is pleasant but needs more balance. The intense hoppy flavor aside, this beer comes across as somewhat watery, like Arcadia's pale ale.","BitteBier","Jun 30, 2003"
2.36,-32.4,4,3,2,2,2,"Pours a good, white head that leaves a lot of lace. Hops throughout, the malts are trying to come through but just don't make it. Don't get me wrong this a good IPA, light to medium bodied - I just don't like them. Bitter finish with a lingering aftertaste.","jdhilt","Jun 29, 2003"
3.43,-1.7,4.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Light bronze in hue with a slight murk. Impressively thick, stiff, off white head retains well and leaves densely patterned lace. The aroma is a combination of sweet, tangerine citrus and ripe peach esters interlaced with pine sap. Malt character is only of a muffled light biscuit note... but it works. Incipient light lovibond caramel malt sweetness in flavor persists transiently until offset by a perfumed, slightly soapy, drying hop bitterness. Constituent pale malt breadiness persists as a functional undertone. Hop flavor gains structure late, being composed of tame sweet citrus zest with a peppery edge. Lightly bodied overall and well attenuated, (perhaps overly so) and passably dextrinous in mouthfeel. Finishes cleanly bittersweet, with fleeting hints of pink grapefruit and refined sugar. Arcadia IPA is an odd, nearly esterless brew somewhere between a standard American pale and west coast IPA in overall character. It's somewhat of a jack of all trades and a master of none, but quite likeable nonetheless. Innocuously good.","marc77","May 23, 2003"
3.97,13.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Poured a golden orange color with a large head that had good retention. The aroma was very hopped, definite of the IPA style. The taste was very smooth, with a full hop bite just like the aroma suggests. Although very bitter and hoppy tasting, this brew goes down smooth and easy and is very refreshing. The head stayed around for almost the entire glass and left plenty of lace on the way down. If I had to compare this to more well known beers, I would say it is a cross between a Sierra Nevada PA and a Harpoon IPA.","nixhecks","May 20, 2003"
4.43,26.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Ever slightly hazy golden color with a thin yet dense head, lace ringed the glass to the end. The smell was bready and mild. The taste was amazing. Initial taste was smooth and refreshing, becoming sweet and floral bitter in the middle. the finish was mildly sweet with a citrus floral hoppiness that lingered pleasantly. Very drinkable beer.","jaz","Feb 14, 2003"
3.26,-6.6,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Well, it looks great. Big ivory head crowns the hazy amber body very nicely. The head retains well and laces with gusto. Very nice. The nose gives some nice hints of citrus and cranks in some hoppiness. The first taste sensation is of sourness, not like citrus sour, but like mash sour. Hops kick in an unabashed way to create a harsh, bitter finish. This is over the top, not so much in total hopping, but rather in poor balance of the hops among themselves. Mostly a grapefruit sense, but not one that's clean and neat. Not a beer I'd drink very often or with great relish.","AtLagerHeads","Jan 29, 2003"

3.38,-3.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours with a nice foamy head that quicky settles to about 2mm. Taste is bright and crisp with strong hops bite, but it quickly dissipates and the flavor gets thin. This was my first IPA two years ago, but I find the logical progression took me to Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and then to Bell's Two Hearted Ale for the high water mark of a well-balanced IPA style brew. As others have said in prior reviews, this is a great "starter IPA," which is good advice. Overall, a quality brew for those who appreciate a strong hop presence.","Sudmissle","Jan 08, 2003"
4.07,16.6,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer is quite a treat - its very difficult to find a good English-style IPA in this area. Special thanks to my little sister for bringing this one from Michigan.","Viking","Jan 05, 2003"
3.76,7.7,3,4.5,4,3,3,"Golden caramel in color, slight chill haze, really very clear considering it's not filtered..bits of yeast swimming like fish in a sea of beer. Forms a white, rocky 2-finger head which sticks around and forms nice lace...meringue peaks on top of LARGE bubbles. Fairly well carbonated. Aroma is of cascade hops, but has a certain Tettnang/Hallertauer spiciness, esters, a lemony sourness, and..what is that?...bavarian wheat yeast? Interesting!. Smells quite nice, gets the salivary glands working overtime. Taste is rough around the edges...I think the hopping could be better...it is a bit more hoppy in bitterness than in flavor, and the finish is somewhat astringent. Basically, it has an amateur homebrew taste to it, but a knockout aroma. I'll stick to Bell's Two-Hearted Ale, my favorite IPA.","Mitchster","Dec 28, 2002"
3.59,2.9,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A very enjoyable IPA. Not as good as a Bell's Two-Hearted or Victory, but still delicious. Aroma is that of pine and grapefruit with a nice, bitter hop presence. This would be a decent session IPA as it is easy to drink.","proc","Dec 12, 2002"
4,14.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Golden with a slight orange core and a hazy appearance. Very creamy one fingered head sits on top. Smells of grapefruit. How many ways can I describe an IPA? Citrusy grapefruit taste without too much bitterness. Not the beer for you if you are looking for a very bitter IPA. It is the 2nd best bottled IPA from Michigan that I can recall. Bell's Two Hearted gets my first place vote.","mjohn27603","Dec 04, 2002"
3.22,-7.7,3,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Part of and Arcadia sampler: This is a decent IPA but really doesn't compare to some of the better ones I have had lately (Ruination, 90 Minute etc). Dark murky orange/copper color with a thin off-white head. Very thin lacing. Aroma was somewhat hoppy (are those fuggles?) with a little citrus. Flavor was hoppy with a light malt balance and a light toasty finish. While on the weak side there was really nothing offensive going on here. This would probably be a good starter IPA.","Dogbrick","Oct 03, 2002"
3.75,7.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Buttery and hoppy aroma was found to come from this copper-colored brew. It was solftly carbonated and had a decent head. Fruity hop flavor weighed in heavy against the soft malt in this IPA. This beer had a hard water aftertaste.","yen157","Aug 12, 2002"
3.77,8,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"The color was a  copperish gold, but the head was small due to how they poured it and only formed a small white head with not lace. The aroma was of hops and slightly of citrus. The flavor was malt, hops with a hint of a burnt citrus?. There was a nice hop bitterness to the finish.  Not as good as some of the others, but a good beer.","Wildman","Aug 07, 2002"
3.97,13.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Hazy, marmalade color with a dense ivory head that drops to a collar but leaves some good lace. The nose displays notes of fruitiness and lightly sweet malt. I think there may be some citrusy hop contributing to the fruity aroma but it's unclear. The body is medium-light and smooth with a creamy mouthfeel and just a light zest on the tongue. This beer takes a turn for the better at tasting, revealing much more character than the appearance or aroma does. Bright hop flavor hits the tongue first, mellowing into a gently fruity malt at the middle, and finishing with an agreeable, long lasting dryness. As you progress through the tasting the malt and hop flavors trade places, playing off each other, always complimentary. Not a big or complex I.P.A, but one with a great balance and interplay of flavors.","NeroFiddled","Beers"
