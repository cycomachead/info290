First one in a long time, but this was just completely undrinkable to me. Seriously wondering if something was wrong with it. Although I have only had 3 English IPAs and the highest rating is 3.5, so I may not be judging to style very well. It had a May best by date. Aroma is just awful. It smells and tastes like an old, bad lager. Overly sweet. Like artificial sweetner. No hops at all. Just, bad. The only good thing I can say about it besides it looked good is that it is now gone forever. Soemthing had to be wrong with this bottle, or me. GL couldn't make a beer that bad. Afraid to try again. Good Lord, someone get me a Burning River quick.","WesMantooth","Mar 30, 2015"

4.32,11.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 5/7/2015. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt notes; with great strength. Taste of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, herbal, floral, grass, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, lemon/orange peel, pine, caramel, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky/resinous mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic English IPA style. All around awesome complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 14, 2015"

Commodore Perry IPA has an ABV of 7.5%  This IPA pours out a deep amber color, with a small white head. The smell is rich with hops , grains, and malts.  There is a bitter sweetness in the smell of this brew.  The taste bitter with hops, grains and malts. This is a nice drinking IPA.  Commodore Perry IPA has a real nice balance. There is nothing overpowering in this brew. The mouthfeel is bold with bitterness and a nice clean finish. Overall I'm giving  Commodore Perry IPA a 4.25 out of 5. Great Lakes Brewing Co. did a nice job with this brew.  I would buy this brew again. This one of the smoother IPA on the market.","nicholas2121","Jan 26, 2015"

Typical IPA color profile, citrus/floral hops nose, and crisp bitter flavor.  To me, it leans towards an extra IPA at 7.5% and ample bitterness...just short of a DIPA.  I would certainly drink again.","captaincoffee","Oct 21, 2014"

I prefer some of GL other beers, and I'm likely to pass this up for other IPA's. That being said, it's still quite tasty and enjoyable, especially for the price.","Bone53","May 18, 2014"

Hoppiness is noticeable only by the bitterness with no pronounced flower, citrus, melon, or conifer aroma or flavor. Perhaps I’m just used to the more hop-forward offerings in DIPAs and can’t recognize a basic IPA any more. For those who don’t want their palates destroyed by hop bombs, this may be a good choice.","Ozzylizard","May 09, 2014"

No sign whatsoever of strength here when it came to the ABV and that was as testament to how easily enjoyable this was. While not as intense or full as other IPA's or English IPA's, there's so much to like here including the easygoing nature of this. Perfect for someone new to the style or willing to kick a few back without downing a "hop bomb".","JerzDevl2000","Feb 06, 2014"

Aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, and other tropical sweet and tangy, with a mild resinous character in the backbone. Flavors are tangy sweet tropical fruit and mild spicing, with roast characteristics and cut grass highlights. More on the tangy side by far, but well balanced overall, and very drinkable. Mid-bodied, but slightly effervesced from the carbonation. Tangy sweet and slightly rich aftertaste, with a subtly dry, slightly bitter finish. Very well rounded, very drinkable English IPA.

Great amount of head where you know the beer is fresh. The first impression is that it starts clean meaning not overpowering hoppyiness, and finishes with a hint of citrus. Golden in color.

The nose is loaded with sweet malt, a little bread, and subtle hops...not it's best quality, but not unappealing by any stretch.

4.1,5.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"what a beer! this is the best work of great lakes i think. the pour is orange and clear, caramely and lucrative, lacey white head. dank nose, lots of fruity hops and some odd dried fruit aroma as well, maybe cherries or something more exotic, some english malt in there somewhere too, but this is a hop bomb, bordering on a fresh hop brew with high alpha and resin content. the flavor is consistent with the smell, where is all this fruit coming from, and how the hell is this beer pushing 8% abv? its so delicate and nuances it cant be that strong can it? almost acidicly bitter in the finish, but there again is that semisweet dries fruit complex that keeps lingering. enough carbonation and only a medium body i could drink this until the saturation point without much trouble. i think easliy the best great lakes offering ive had the pleasure of tipping back. a real treat, and something different finally in the american ipa world.","StonedTrippin","Dec 03, 2012"

This one is really piney and grassy and some very tart orange. It takes some time to get used to. Also has a toasted malt base. Floral notes as well. Moderate to high carbonation and medium body. I like this beer it's just hard to drink for the first few sips. The pine is resilient though and you never get completely used to it.

Grassy, herbal, and a hint of citrus blossoms on the notes. Opens with mild bitterness, bready with toasty caramel accents embedded in the very noticeable malt bill that slowly gives way to a dry, crisp finish dominated by grapefruit rind bitterness and hints of alcohol. Medium bodied, smooth, and well-carbonated. Very enjoyable and extremely well balanced. As a fan of English IPA's, although this tends to be a bit more bitter than most, this is one of the better examples readily available in my area.","chanokokoro","Nov 13, 2012"

Pours the brightest copper I have ever seen with a two and a half finger white head. Leaves a great amount of lacing. Smells of exceptional hops along with distant pine, oranges and grapefruit. Pineapple also comes through if inhaled hard enough. Basically smells like a very sweet fruit basket. The taste is predominantly pine, with a decent amount of banana coming through. Slight orange, some odd wheat, and also some odd soapyness come through as well. The motuhfeel is of strong pine with a bit of lemon zest and ever so slight orange with a moderate amount of wheat. Overall, this is a great IPA with lots of flavor, although the odd soapyness kind of ruins the whole deal for me. Would I buy it again? Yes, although it cannot hold a candle to mad hatter.","SometimesIfart","Aug 15, 2012"

Aroma and flavor both contained an very high amount of orange and grapefruit peel to pine resin ratio over the top of a balancing toffee malt. Hits the sweet-bitter balance and really close to the smoother texture / medium carbonation I prefer in my IPAs.

The aroma is fantastic--fruity, clean, and just enough pine to grab your attention without overpowering the gentler scents. The flavor is pretty much what you would expect from a solid IPA--bitter, fairly piney, without a whole lot else going on. Pretty good as far as IPA's go, but they aren't a style I typically enjoy, so I can't give the taste a ringing endorsement in the grand scheme of things.

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4," Thick sticky lacing throughout the drink. Smelled of strong hops with a touch of fruits. The taste was nice and bitter with the hops strong and dry at the finish. Somewhat like two hearted only not the grapefruit tones. Mouthfeel was medium to slightly thick while going down smooth. Very drinkable and i could feel a slight buzz after savoring a glass for about 15 minutes. This was very good ipa with a nice balance of flavors and not too expensive. $7.99 a six. I will definitely pick some more of this up as it's about $2.50-$3.00 cheaper than two hearted and very near as good! Nice job Great Lakes!","kalkavekkian","Jan 12, 2012"

The mouthfeel of the beer remains drinkable and well carbonated. Overall this beer is a good, I feel that it's not my favorite IPA out there but I like something with a little more kick to it.

The smell is has a apricot/citrus base with subtle spice. The taste is powered by hops....it starts very bitter, then a apricot shaunters in followed by more bitter. There is a tinge of metallic taste and the ABV is not fully masked. The mouthfeel is a full bodied ale with good carbonation. Overall it is a taste beer and highly recommended. This beer definitely is more English IPA than West Coast IPA.","WoodBrew","Dec 19, 2011"

4.1,5.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours out a pale straw yellow color characteristic of the style. Has some head to it, but what strikes me more is the smell. This is probably the maltiest IPA I have ever had. Has a huge fresh bready smell with some tangy ripe fruit hops in the nose. The taste is more of the same, but quite balanced for such a hoppy beer, some sweet, toasty malts but with clean bitter, grassy aftertastes. I would describe the hops as mostly herbal, slightly citric and dry almost like a pilsner. The hop profile is more English Bitter to me than APA, less emphasis on the Cascades more on the balance between malt and bitter hops; interesting. Mouthfeel is rich yet pretty smooth. Overall this is a unique interpretation of the style and a nice change of pace for an IPA in a world of Cascade infused hop-bombs.","Star80","Mar 30, 2011"

This beer looks fiesty, just by its color. Aromas are hoppy, floral and citrus weighing heavily on the palate. Taste is similar, an extreme bitterness balanced with nice grapefruit citrus in the body and a more mellow finish that still rings in with a sturdy citrus bitterness. Touches of pine and resin are hard to find, as this is a major grapefruit tartness bomb. A pretty good IPA, with a malt profile that loses itself in the grapefruit.","CuriousMonk","Feb 02, 2011"

The taste ups the ante with the flowers and pine, adds a decent amount of orange peel, and tightens the leash around the neck of the toffee. The body is a hefty light, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish.

The smell is hops and citrus, specifically some grapefruit, with a mild floral presence. This is a good balance of sweet malts up front and bitter hops to follow. This has always been one of my favorite IPAs, and one of the first for me. My only criticism is that it is pretty sweet, but at a high proof and strong amount of malt, that is expected. It is medium bodied, and im down for another...but the 7.5% will sneak up on you.","beerdown77","Nov 09, 2010"

4.25,9.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"All aboard, mate! The pour sailed out of a bottle with a slightly darker-than-apple-juice color. The fresh aroma of "dry" beer and fruit blockades any other scents from making birth into my nose. All in all, Commodore Perry's brew has a very commanding taste as there's an upfront dry hoppy flavor that puts my taste buds in a knot. Eventually, they quickly lift up anchor and give way to a fruity aftertaste. The mouthfeel is about average, so I wouldn't say it outranks other brews, but I haven't had anything that I would say is leagues better either. Drinkability factor good, I can't fathom why I waited this long to try it.","majesticsock","Oct 06, 2010"

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Great Lake Commodore Perry is a little short of greatness. The color is good, it's a orange hued amber with white foam that settles to a thin white layer. The beer smells minty and citrusy from hops and a little fruity from yeast. The taste is very complex, it is sweet with apples, grapes and pears upfront with a tinge of bitterness that gives way to a mouthful of toasted whole-grain bread that only gives way to a drying bitterness in the end. After the swallow, the bitterness lingers with the warming astringency of alcohol. I think if the alcohol was less obtrusive and hop flavor was more assertive (not just bitter), then this would be a far superior beer. As it is, it is very good, but turning down the malts (and booze) a little on this beer and letting the hops shine a little more would be a benefit.","Soonami","Sep 28, 2010"

Cracked one open, poured it into the aforementioned goblet, inhaled the aromas,sipped, and decided "this is better than I first thought." IPAs are challenging, especially to a first-timer. This is an IPA I would recommend for a first-timer. It has grace notes of what should be expected of IPAs, the pine, grapefruit,lingering bitterness, citrus and citrus zest, but in small doses.

Thin for an IPA but good. This is an IPA that you can still taste on your tongue in the morning. I had to drink three over two days before I realized I liked it. It grows on you. This beer is very drinkable if you know your IPA's. You're not going to get a crisp finish with this beer. I would drink it again, and recommend it.","Mbarnes304","Jun 28, 2010"

Full of grapefruit and pine hop aromas. Smells like over ripen citrus fruit. There is a little caramel malt in the flavor but otherwise features the hops with a lot of grapefruit and orange. Bitterness is on the high side but there is enough hop flavor to make it worthwhile. Still would of liked more malt for balance. Medium body to carry the hop flavor and bitterness.

The smell is a bit subdued, a little grassy, a little lemon zest and a bit of toasty sweet malts. Nothing too impressive, though I wouldn't say it lacks what most IPAs have. The taste comes up with a little bit of bitterness - though the bitterness is nicely balanced with some grainy malts, slightly bready, slightly crackery. The hop flavor has the taste of lemons and sour lemon rinds, along with quite a bit of grass and resins. It also finishes with this very floral, slightly estery sting, mixed in with a pleasant sweetness. Pretty good, but I think there is just a little bit missing as far as I can tell. The body is nice - medium full. The carbonation is not incredibly lively, but it's definitely there. But the weird floral feeling kind of comes back, this sticky (but not like hop resins sticky) kind of powdery floral feeling, not the most pleasant thing. The beer is nice to drink, not too incredible, but one that I could definitely see being part of a nice night, maybe one to go back to, depending on the price and the situation, but not an IPA that I'd go to if I was looking for that American IPA kind of beer.","taylorhamrick","Apr 14, 2010"

Aroma is malty, but a swirl in the glass brings out some piney hops. A slight sweetness leads, and the flavor is full of pronounced hops, fading to a lingering floral fruitiness. The hops are a large flavor, but not overwhelming or unbalanced. It has a medium body, and coats the mouth well, allowing the flavors to linger on. Lazy, slow rising bubbles in the glass defy how carbonated the beer feels on the tongue - a medium carbonation adds to the sharpness of the hops and delivers the flavor. This is a tasty beer, one which could easily be a session beer for one who likes hops.","Ladybugger","Jan 29, 2010"

The flavor is characterized by a very good hop character. Slightly bitter at first, the hops swell into a full-blown mouth full of bitterness. It's dry and a little fruity. There is also some sweetness mixed in for good measure. There is no indication this is a 7.5% ABV beverage. This is a very tasty IPA. It has a medium body, but it's a hearty medium; it fills your mouth with flavor and leaves a good coating that lingers along with the hop aftertaste, but it also makes you want to have another sip.

Clove, pepper spice and forest floor matter, lichens swirl up in the nose, tree bark and fallen limbs too, sounds crazy but there's something like Hunt's ketchup in there, sour orange zest, peach and apricot pits, not a lot of sweetness in there. Medium-bodied, mouth entry buoyed by foamy carbonation, herbaceous with that same forest-like earthiness and bark notes, even charcoal. Flavor-wise, not much maltiness but they do smooth out the texture some. Orange, lemon pith on the sour side, apricot, peach, red apple, red cherry fruit. More metallic as it goes on.

Head eventually settles into a consistent skim with delicate strands of lacing revealed during the tasting - excellent adhesion. Mild nose - some grapefruit, but it doesn't really punch you in the face, followed by a light malt character. Taste reveals a floral/piny hops character up front with a lingering, slightly medicinal, bitterness at the finish - no grapefruit here.

Poured into my nonic pint glass, the IPA appears a clear golden yellow color with a good two fingers of fluffy bone white foam. The foam leaves a minimal lace on the inside of my glass with each sip. Nose and flavor consist of medium toasted cereal grain, grassy hops, citrus such as tangerines, floral, nice amount of caramelized malt, notes of resinous pine, a bit of alcohol.

It seemed more like a Belgian blonde ale or German lager, due to all the malt and yeast. The hops were pretty weak for an American IPA.

It has a really smooth pale and bisquit malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and bitter with some great hop taste. There is incredible balance here. The mouthfeel is good.

It smells a little sweet, like Christmas cookies. Despite the "best by" date being passed, it smells fresh. It is medium bodied and very smooth. It has a creamy mouth feel that's a little bubbly. It lightens up toward the end of the taste. It has a pretty dry finish that leaves the mouth a little sticky. It's pretty well bittered and pretty well balanced.

I would try it again, but I won't go out of my way to do so.","KarlHungus","Dec 01, 2008"

This is right in line with the Great Lakes way of brewing beer fantastic recipe, and a great angle on a wonderful style. Emptied a bottle into my glass and was given a richly golden colored ale with a thick fluffy white head that soon settles to a nice white film. Abundant lacing is present, and a lazy carbonation can be seen. As I smell the aroma I am rewarded with a biting hop scent of grapefruit and pine. This is pleasant and unexpected and it smells wonderful. This is considerably more citrusy than the average IPA. Mouthfeel is dry and smooth, not too thick so it goes down easy. The flavor is outstanding keeping in line with the aroma. An abundance of hops (cascade is an understatement) fill out this one with a real subtle malt backbone. Taste is mostly citrus grapefruits, nice and tart with an even amount of bitterness. Overall this is one of my favorite IPA's and another score for one of my top brewers.

Slightly below the standard for the style and not the best from this great brewery.","Phyl21ca","Sep 27, 2007"

3.95,1.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Clear and dark gold, the beer was capped by a fluffy white head that settled quickly to a thin cap, leaving behind some delicate, transient lace. Floral aroma with mild citrus and fruit notes. Just a hint of toasty, sweet malts as well. Strong bitterness up front became pine resin towards the finish. Solid caramel maltiness with some sweetness that lessens at the end. Hope were sometimes grassy, mostly pine and floral. Bitterness really lingered. Alcohol flavour was faint and gave it a bit of spiciness. Warmth was pleasant. Medium bodied with fine carbonation and chewy malt. Pretty good stuff. The use of hops was a little different than a lot of other IPAs and the balance was quite good for the bitterness level.","DrJay","Sep 17, 2007"

It has a sweet fruity pineapple-like quality on the swallow, then finishes with an earthy bitter dryness, maybe a little too bitter for some.... it's very strange, and I'm loving every minute of it. The higher ABV is buzzing my senses, but the smooth (almost oily) medium bodied mouthfeel makes me keep going for more. The appearence is crystal clear golden amber, with a lively head that retains well. Smell is subtle but complex. A real winner here in my book - will happily purchase again.","HopCrazy","Sep 14, 2007"
3.75,-3.4,4,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Pours out a crystal clear golden orange with about a finger of white head. Nice lacing. It's always pleasant to have an IPA after a long while without - the aroma is so enjoyable in it's floral hoppiness, as it is in this one. The flavor is IPAish, for certain - it starts off tasting like flowers, if that makes sense, and the powerful hops set in quickly. The aftertaste lingers quite a bit, as well. Overall, it's good, but not great, as the bitterness is almost too much. On the other hand, it's really smooth in the mouth - impressively so. I can drink it easily enough. Not bad, but there are better IPAs.","MDekker","Sep 11, 2007"

4,3.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Thanks to Kingpin for the bottle. This pours a clear pale amber color with a fine white head that quickly dissipates and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass. The smell is of citrussy hops. The taste is hoppy, with a grapefruit flavor predominating, as well a a good fruity malt backing(apricot?). This is a nicely balanced IPA with a rich and smooth mouthfeel. According to the label, the alcohol content is 7.5%, which is higher than I would expect from the taste.

Anyway, I've had several offerings from this brewery and can't say that this one is one of my favorites, but it's certainly decent, to say the least, esp. as it progresses.

Nose is fairly mild, mostly just floral hops and a touch of very light malt character. Great flavor. In no particular order: a long fruity hoppy aftertaste (grapefruit, oranges, peaches?), and light sweet caramel malt. The beer sweetens as it warms, which makes for a perfect balance to the bitterness. This one's a super-hoppy IPA with a great fruit character. A really solid IPA.","soupyman10","Aug 21, 2007"

Taste is very malty, sweet, a bit sugary, almost cloying, spicy bitterness, pine, alcohol, fruits, almost has a Belgian feel to it. Mouthfeel is full bodied, very thick, with low carbonation, alcohol is well hidden.

The taste, however, is quite distinct, featuring a medium to high hoppiness with a strong fruit and floral overtone that, when coupled with the moderate carbonation, makes for a very refreshing summer beer. Often, I find IPA's dry me out a bit after a couple, but the crispness of the beer and fruit and floral tones really balances out the hops and makes it easy to drink. A really great IPA.","Abita45","Aug 07, 2007"

4.29,10.6,3,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours an insanely clear apple juice color, quite the shock. One finger fluffy white head dies down to a thin lacing. Stickiness is alright, spotty on the sides. First thing I get from the smell is a caramel malt, am I crazy? After that first scent, big citrus notes of mostly grapefruit, dominate the nose. A tiny bit of honey presents itself as well. Taste is pretty complex. Starts off somewhat bready from the good malt background and then is dominated by a lemony hop kick. That honey flavor once again surfaces but this time on the tongue. Ends up semi-dry with an earthy fruit aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Drinkability is scary good, I really enjoy this IPA. I think the finish is the best part of this brew. Don't judge a beer by how it looks that's all I have to say.","BeerTruth","Jul 25, 2007"

With Great Lakes products came Erie Brewing, Magic Hat, Atwater, and more. I'm happy to see this happening here's the IPA and the bottle states 7.5% abv when I visited the brewery back in 04 it was listed at 8%. Appearance has a light bronze copper appearance even a pale peach lighter in color than the Burning River Pale, large off white creamy textured head forms thick and dwindles slow clinging to the edges of the pint leaving even rings of lace with each sip. Aromatics contains heavy grapefruit peel action with a sugary coating much sweeter smelling than actual grapefruit, the malts used here are mildly toasted with somewhat of a spicy rye note even though I now none of that was utilized here. Flavors a bitey somewhat acidic wave of high alpha hops grapefruit peels, pine, and grassy components all dive onto the palate with some initial sweetness quickly gets wiped away. Not as diverse and well balanced as some standard IPAs but at 7.5 this one is on the border of a DIPA definitely some assertive alcohol noted in the taste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light slippery textured hop oils gliding on the palate definitely sticks to the tongue and carbonation feels natural and carris the brew well pretty moderate. Drinkability is great I could handle a few of these but really I've been enjoying one out of the sixer at a time, spreading them out has been an enjoyable experience between finishing nursing school this week and catching up on cutting the grass this brew is substantial enough to fill my hophead cravings. I believe in my last review on tap I yearned for this beer to be bottled, well I guess I owe a thank you to the folks at Great Lakes, goo job guys.","WVbeergeek","May 05, 2007"

Commodore Perry has a well-balanced hoppiness that is not as bitter as it is sweet. Grapefruity bite, finishes with a slight hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a delciously syrupy texture. This is a highly drinkable IPA, but with such high ABV, only a few glasses will be manageable in a short time span. However, its tastiness can make it difficult to sip. It pairs well with a creamy goat cheese. The sweetness of the beer's grapefruit notes plays well against the sour creaminess of the cheese. An above average beer for the style.","logansboat15","Apr 16, 2007"

The bitter toasty piney grapefruit hops. Slight toasty malt flavor, not balanced but it is very good. The mouthfeel is light and crisp with loads of bitterness, and really dry.

3.79,-2.3,2.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured a clear honey amber with a small skim of white bubbles that I guess is suppose to act as Commodore Perry's head of foam. When the "head of foam" fizzled away, it left behind some white bubbles as rings and maybe a few bubbles acting as lace. The beer's appearance is made mostly of just bubbles floating around aimlessly. It smells like Great Lakes took a giant grapefruit and then dipped it in candy sugar. Then they combined the sugar coated grapefruit with citrus hops. Once the beer really warms up, it smells like cold cereal without the milk. Unusual, but good. I'll give that. Now this is where you get to taste the sugar coated grapefruit combined with the citrus hops. After the citrus hops have gone, a slight taste of toasted malt emerges. I believe the toasted malts calmed down the aggressiveness of the sugar coated grapefruit and the citrus hops and made this IPA a very well rounded brew. Without it, it would have just been grapefruit juice with hops added. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with an aftertaste that tasted just like the aftertaste you would get after drinking a whole glass of grapefruit juice. Grab your grapefruit spoon and did in because you're going to need it. A nice addition to Great Lakes brewed year round list. Would the "Hero of Lake Erie," Commodore Perry himself drink this beer if he was still alive? Only if he liked grapefruits with a passion.","AltBock","Apr 01, 2007"
4.29,10.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall: This is one of my favorite American IPAs.

There is a sort of delicate strength to this beer. Its not bullish, but it has a lot of flavor concentration.

Roundish sour orange and grapefruit juice aromas mix with a pleasant sugar-sweet scent. Very little sweetness in the taste, however: the Commodore is all bitter and biting, with mineral notes abounding -- kind of like eating a grapefruit peel with a rusty fork. Not as bad as that sounds, but really, this is lacking a malt bill formidable enough to take on the massively bitter hops. It wouldn't need to strive for "balance" or anything (I mean, this IS an IPA, after all), but just represent for the grains out there. Or something. Anyway, mostly dry mouthfeel with some juicy notes. Moderately drinkable. The bitterness is just not the kind I look for in an IPA. Maybe it's just that I expect more from Great Lakes, maybe this is a bad batch -- in any case, near the bottom of my IPA list.","orfeu","Aug 01, 2006"

Same with the flavor, which was hoppy but not bitter, and malty but not too sweet, just a really smooth beer that's easy to drink. The oily texture coats your tongue so the flavor lingers.

Somehow I put five of these down last night (it was hot and humid) in only a few hours (no, I wasn't driving!) but today it seems a bit too big for the heat . . . a wintertime IPA?

Aromas are a nasally-pleasing mix of grassy and estery fruit hops, supported by a malty sweet base. Flavors weren't as BIG as I'd hoped. It's a well-balanced IPA that uses the caramel sweetness to offset the multiple hop tones that wash over the palate. Finishes with a long-lasting dryness of pine sap and a touch of ABV warmth. Nice mouthfeel, not as thick as I'd hoped. Creamy-smooth, with just a hint of carbonation. For an 8% beer, it was gone in a flash. So very well-balanced.","OldFrothingSlosh","Jul 22, 2006"

3.68,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. The beer is well carbonated. The alcohol is well incorporated. This is not a bad beer and I will probably rotate this into my beer purchases next year.","nlmartin","Jul 18, 2006"
3.68,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 oz bottle. This beer pours a moderate golden color with a half finger of head over top, falling to a sparse coat over top. The brew is clear and there is little to no carbonation bubbling up in it. A deep inhale brings a nice moderate caramel maltyness, a mild grainey character, with nice sweet and citrusy hops as well as a more mild earthy hop. This one is giving me impressions of both an American And a British IPA. The flavor hits with caramel malt, followed by a solid earthy and slightly citrusy hop. A moderate bitterness hits on the finish, with a slight creshendo after a few seconds. The bitterness hangs on pretty solid into the finish as well. Mouthfeel is moderate with a carbonation on the light end of moderate. This one is not bad. It really does seem to be stuck between American and English IPA. The bitterness is a touch harsh as well. I don't think this one would be my choice for an IPA when I hit the stores, as others just draw me more, but this one is by no means bad. Just not to my taste.","kmpitz2","Jul 14, 2006"
4.4,13.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours a crystal clear shade of light gold. Three finger head is soapy but dense, with outstanding retention and sticky lacing. Hoppy american nose like grapefruit and pear, some mild citrus, mabye a pinch of pine, and some background malt aromas. Taste is initially sweet with toasty munich malt directly followed by an onslaught of chinook, simcoe, and cascade flavors. The dry, bitter aftertaste is oily with notes of pine needles ...the kind of aggressive acidity that will put a smile on any hophead's face. Medium in body and carbonation, a pleasent resinous mouthfeel. Loads of hop flavor here, but not overly bitter. The finish is dry and saturated with hops, but fairly balanced by the touch of malt sweetness.","PBRstreetgang","Jul 14, 2006"

3.68,-5.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Glad to see this beer available in Central Kentucky. Being a lover of IPAs, I couldn't wait to try this one. A typical copper / amber hue with nice head retention and carbonation. Aromas are slight, both with the malts and hops--pleasant, but light. Tastes sweetly of malt at first, but then a decent kick of hop bittering to follow. The pine, grass, or spice flavor of the hops are a bit lacking, but lightly present. Flavors create a detergent-like flavor just before the finish. Body is rich and firm throughout. Finishes bitter with a hoppy dry finish. The alcohols are ver controled and contribute nicely to the beer.","BEERchitect","Jul 09, 2006"

4.1,5.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"On tap at Boston's. I was very excited to see this brand new release on tap, as I stopped in for a beer. Pours a clear golden color with a slight orange tint. Thick white fluffy head has good retention. Citrusy and floral hop aroma. Soft caramel malt backbone, which holds its own, but does not become too sweet or cloying. Nice amount of bitterness, along with floral, and citrusy, mostly grapefruit flavors. Finishes very much in the floral flavors. Appropriate carbonation with a medium body. Tons of sticky patchwork lace coates the sides of the glass. Not overwhelming, and maybe even tame compared to Burning River. Malt and hops compliment each other here. While this may not be as exciting to a hophead as other IPAs, it is solid, and could easily be a good session beer. Another solid beer from Great Lakes.","Bierguy5","Jul 02, 2006"

4.28,10.3,4.5,4,4,4.5,5,"Drinks more like a 5% alcohol brew compared to it's 7.5%. I could honestly drink this IPA all day long. Been waiting for a new Great Lakes beer to be bottled as I don't make it to the brewery often and this one does not dissapoint. Luckily we will be getting draught Oktoberfest this year also.","mcallister","Jun 23, 2006"
3.63,-6.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"For some reason, this one was not listed with the sampler but was brought out on its own anyway. I drank it after the Russian Imperial Stout, so I'm not sure how this affected my opinion. Good qualities, but nothing too special for an IPA. Pretty good head and carbonation, no lacing to speak of. Easy enough to drink but not the best choice for a session beer.","Backer2004","Jun 02, 2005"
4.2,8.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability: Dangerous stuff (I think the brewery listed it at 8% abv) but I could quaff this all day long. Strongly recommended.","mattcrill","May 21, 2005"
4.35,12.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Just another day, another great beer at GLBC. Just back on tap in early August 2003, the old favorite Commodore Perry is here to please. Superb appearance and great smell of citrus fruits, flavors of citrus and rinds, what a fully hopped yet pleasing, not-over-the-top beer this is. Not yet available again in bottles, the publican explained that they're still wrangling with the State of Ohio over their label design. GLBC wants to stick with what they already have; Ohio says no. So if you want the great Commodore, head to their store in the Ohio City section of Cleveland.","AtLagerHeads","Aug 03, 2003"
4.6,18.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Served draught at Great Lakes with a nice full 2-finger white head that reduced and maintained well to the bottom. Left a beautiful sticky lace down the sides of the glass. The body was a orangish gold color that was very cloudy. I'm pretty sure this was served unfiltered, which made it that much better. The smell was pretty much hops & hints citrus, as well was the flavor. Along with the great flavor of hops, there seemed to be some kind of little bursts of pine & bitter orange rind. This brew finished crisp, clean, & dry. Overall a great beer that, like all Great Lakes brews, seemed to stay pretty true to the style.........","irishmoss","May 30, 2003"
