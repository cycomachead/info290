"I love the floral hops here, yum. 12oz cans FTW!"
""
""
"Tried a fresh single. Was a 12oz can. I thought it was a good ipa. @5.5% Abv you can session this beer."
"pretty good IPA, but kind of generic. It's very well rounded and overall a great beer when you just want an IPA but don't want to overdo it on hops"

"Pours a straw golden color with a fizzy head. The smell is full of grapefruit notes. The taste was simple yet very tasty with the hops being center stage. The light grapefruit bitterness was balanced well by the malt and made for a refreshing finish."

"Really Good, has passed multiple taste tests and remains in the rotation."

"Overall: Another marvelous beer from Berkshire. I'm glad to see them really hit the ball out of the park with this English IPA. I think it's rated lower by people who expect an American style IPA and are then surprised by the subtlety in this one. The hops used in this beer are magnificent and provide a really rare flavor for those used to the traditional American varietals. I would highly recommend this beer, with the caveat that you know it's not an American IPA and you should not expect it to taste like a citrus bomb.4/5"

"Enjoyed from bottle into tulip glass, cloudy orange colour with a pleasant hoppy aroma and nice full maltiness, maybe more hopped up than most English examples this is quite pleasantly sessionable and balanced. Certainly an enjoyable session ipa, nice flavour complexity and hop profile. Very clean and crisp on finish."

"Second try confirms. Hops could be more noteworthy, but the malt really shines through here. Lack of aroma keeps this from being better."
""
"Overall: Fun sessiony IPA from this western Mass. brewer. The term ""session IPA"" makes a lot of folks groan, but this is a very well executed one. A good everyday beer and a good companion for any meal."

"o: Seems a bit lighter than I remember, but the malt and cedar combo is very pleasing. This is sure to become a regular in my beer drinking rotation now that is in convenient 12 ounce cans."

"O - good offering, was expecting more hops, but I enjoyed it."
"O - This is just lame, idk if this is a bad batch or what, but I'm shocked at the rating it has. It taste like what I would assume would be dirty dishwater."
""
""
""
"So where's the hops at least on t his (I don't care if it's English at least I've had a bunch that at least have HOP character). I really hope this is not the epitome of what this beer should taste like."
"O: Another solid offering from BBC. Very nice example of an English IPA from an American brewery. Delicious, easy to drink, and at $4 a 22oz., everybody wins!"
"O: A very good take on the style by an American brewery. The goldings hops work extremely well with the maltiness, giving off the distinct spiciness that makes it almost seem like there is rye in the malt bill. Very drinkable and easy on the wallet at $4 for a bomber"

"more of an English than an American ipa, but I guess its listed that way, so ill shut up about the particulars. this is just genuine beer here, looking right on all light amber, clear, and heady. the nose is intensely malty, odd for an ipa, but one sip confirms its documented genre, a real ipa. its bitter, but its also punchy and fruit in some sense, a real anomaly as they go. listening to a further stream, late night on the east coast, bands in red rocks, and I know this is contextual, romantic, and highly contingent, but this beer is currently continuing the long strange trip, and that means something to me, as in a 4.00 overall score on a beer I only sort of like. the moment is everything people, seize it before you cant. go dead, go Berkshire, and go insatiable appetite for fine ale! this fits the bill on all counts, love the feel and the staying power and the buzz, rock on."

"Awesome local brew from New England."

"One of my favorite beers....better out of a growler then a bottle!"

"A good, but not awesome IPA. Had this on tap at the Martha's Vineyard Chowder Co. Decent color, but I'd prefer a bit darker. Probably non coincidentally, the smell was pleasant but not super robust. I could've used more hops. Citrusy, crisp, floral, decent flavor."
"The beer appeared a hazy orange color with a light, white foamy head that dissipated into a small thin cap. Nothing too impressive...perhaps slightly above average. The beer gave off a hoppier aroma than was expected from an English IPA, but light citrus hops. The taste, again, was overpowered by the hops for the style. This style is typically a bit more balanced than say an American IPA. No real complexity to it, just straight citrus hops. The beer had a good feel to it and finished with a decent dry but bitter aftertaste and was easy to drink. Overall, too hoppy for the style, I expected a little more balance...but even if it was just an IPA, it is average at best."

"O: 4.75 - it's really unfortunate that I don't have easy access to this beer any longer; to me, it's the best American example of a classic EIPA on the market and accentuates all the best features of East Kent Golding on a Maris Otter backbone; for those in New England, considering how affordable it is (~$3.99/bomber and $7.99/growler before deposit) definitely worth hunting down; for those outside of New England who enjoy classic British bitters or EIPAs like Fuller's ESB or Samuel Smith pale ale, it's definitely worth a trade"
""
"O: Nice to have a good English-style IPA every once in a while. This one is restrained and tasty with a great mouthfeel. The Golding hops are expressive without being aggressive."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall: No major flaws but not the best of BBC. Its adequate and I would rate it well as Berkshire has not done me wrong in the past but this is not their finest product.."

""

"Amazing creamy head with chunks of foam clinging to the rim of the glass after a few sips, nice lace down the glass that's not going anywhere until the next pour. Hazy golden body that likes to play with light for added complexity, kind of light amber, like the actual mineral held up to light. Not much hits me in the nose, but as I search a juicy mouthwatering citrus orange-cookie aroma comes through. Really dig the flavors though. Very well balanced. Enough hop presence that you know it's an IPA but enough satisfying malt contrast to be solidly English rather than American style. As it warms some dark fruit sweetness comes through quickly cut by drying bitterness, some tobacco and earthy fresh cut grass in the finish. Really juicy and easy to drink, refreshing as spring even as autumn settles in. Orange/lemon rind with some melon/ grape notes finishing like a crusty rustic baguette. Complex and good. Non-extreme with nothing lacking."

"Overall –It’s a rather smooth IPA. While if you are looking for something very hoppy, this may not be your brew, but if you are looking for something very easy to drink with some nice flavors, this is a nice brew to go to."

"originally reviewed: 11-12-2010"
"Ehhhh, itsa notta bad, eh? Bigger feeling/tasting English-ish IPA than 5.5% typically gives. A bit of mustiness, but brings across biscuits, noble hops of the EngPA variety, and a smooth drinkability. It was decent out of a bomber, but really something I'd love to try on draft, or perhaps . . . cask? Mmmm???"
""
"O - A great english style IPA. I'm glad to have BBC so close to me, I've had this super fresh from the brewery, a few weeks old on tap, and a few months old from the bottle. Its always a damn delicious beer."
""
"Cask at Redbones: Poured a light amber color ale. Aroma of fresh floral hops is not as powerful as expected. Taste is dominated by medium bitter notes with some floral undertones with delicate dry caramel malt. Body is about average. Middle of the road IPA with no major flaws but lacking a bit of hops."
"It is smooth for a IPA but there are better IPA's out there but still well worth buying."
""
""
"Overall: Tasty and balanced English IPA. Very smooth and drinkable. I really enjoyed it. (4)"
""
"A good, easy drinking English ipa. The hops don't overpower, nor does the malt. A bit too sweet, but otherwise very nice. I'll continue buying growlers of this."

"Best by 2/22/12. Picked up a bomber from Beverage Warehouse in Winsooski VT. Like the Traditional Pale Ale, this is a more malty take on the style. There's a clean, bready toasty malt character under the citus, piney hops bite. It's not that similar to Brooklyn IPA, this is significantly maltier. Still a tasty beer, there's just a big sweet biscuit toast that matches the hops."
""
""
"O - I think this is a fantastic beer. It's been in the growler, transported by car, all the way down from Massachusetts to Richmond, VA and I think that has definitely had an impact on the quality. That being said, I think this beer is great even despite these detractions. If you can get your mitts on this beer, do it!!! 4.5"
""
""
""
""
"O: Just too bland and lacking in hop flavor as an IPA for me. Decent if you want an unfiltered pale, though. Ultimately delicious and well brewed."
""
""
""
"D - This is a pretty nice, very drinkable beer but it is kind of an anemic IPA. The hop aroma is noticeable, but not nearly as pungent as a hop lover would hop it might be and the flavor profile is thoroughly dominated by the malt. This all makes for a very nice pale ale, and it could be a great IPA if it had about 4x as much hop character as it does."

"Pours an orange rust color with a semi-clear consistency and a resilient head. Nose carries a mild but zesty lemon citrus and floral sweet aroma. Tasty ripe orange and lemon citrus acidity really hits the palate with a well-rounded bitterness. Sessionable IPA for sure..."
"A decent English IPA, but just not doing it for me."
"A drink with more malt and earthiness than currently popular IPA you find these days. Beautifully golden with a healthy amount of head and lace. Aroma is muted, some malt and a tiny bit of fruitiness. Flavor is traditional English IPA. Earthy with a back end earthy bitterness. Fades some toward the end. Medium body and soft mouthfeel."
"I'll pass the next time I'm offered a bottle of this one."
"A solid representation of the English India Pale Ale."
"O: good beer, different than I last remember, more hazy this time around and less bitterness qualities with a lot more sweetness involved"
"Not your typical IPA (more like a american pale ale) and west coasters will probably lament the lack of hops but I'm glad I tried it. Nothing miraculous."
"Overall, a nice IPA. Glad to have been able to try it, and would certainly have it again if the opportunity presented itself. However, I wouldn't go out in search of it."
"This sh*t is the sh*t, for realsies, im super cereal. One of my favorite IPA's, gotta love the growler its comes in. Its like a party in my mouth. Better then the time I watched Kazamm. If someone beat me over the head with a beer bottle with lost sailor ipa in it I wouldnt mind as long as they poored some in my battered and bruised mouth."
"Pours a hazy orange-copper with a single-finger white head and some spotty lacing as it goes down. The nose carries some light floral hops and some bread, though there's also a bit of solventy character. Slight, but noticeable. The flavor is along the same lines, though the solvent character is mostly gone, thankfully. The mouthfeel is the redeeming aspect, as there's a nice amount of dry bitterness after swallowing the medium-bodied brew. Light to moderate carbonation. Not a bad beer, though not something I'd seek out again."
"A good brew, not sure of ABV but evident through 22oz. A good session beer definitely or with food a win either way."
"From a bottle, pours peach orange with a nice head. Nose is some pine needle with a fair amount of ripe tropical fruits. For some reason cooked mango comes to mind. Mouth is prickly and bitter, becomes sweet with mango, coconut toward the end palate. A fine ale, a bit uneven in profile for my taste. I prefer their lagers from what I've had."
"Fine two finger head of dense foam, with moderate lace cling. Color is a 8 on the SRM beer color chart, with some haze. Smell is sharp, with scents of grapefruit, honey, and pear/pineapple. Taste is bold, grapefruit, lemon, honey, cloves, and malt. Mouthfeel is a little thin and not much fullness, there is some tingle from the carbonation. Overall a decent beer that I would buy again, it I see it on the shelf and I am not hunting for something particular."
"From notes. Pours a light orange amber slightly hazy. Has a nice fluffy head. Hoppy fruity smell.. Piney citrus sweet to the taste then closes with a bitter dry finish. I dont know if I was dehydrated or what but it finished very dry. Tasted hints of orange, pear, lemon. Has some spice to it. Medium light mouthfeel. Overall this is a good ipa. I'd get it again, but I'd choose others before it. Not a huge english ipa fan"
"o: This wasn't bad overall. When I ordered this with dinner I didn't realize this was a smaller English IPA, so I guess I was expecting something different."
"Let me preference the overall with this is the last of this beer. Apparently the type of hops BBC was using is no longer available so once this batch is gone its gone for good. That being said this is a great beer, very well rounded with no one thing jumping out but the sum of it making an excellent beer. An easy beer that goes with anything, get it while you can."
"O - I like this beer very much, while the appearances, smell and mouthfeel I found to be about average, the flavor is there in full."
"Wow, it has been a while since someone poured me a draft I.P.A. that was this fresh. It is quite noticeable. Pours clear reddish color, white head, great retention that laces the glass. Smells of floral hops and sweetness. Tastes citrusy with a complimentary sweet malt flavor. Fruity yeast esters that I assumed were coming from an English yeast. Just a touch watery on the mouthfeel, at least for my taste. Really my only complaint about the beer. IPA is a competitive category of beer, that I am particularly picky with. I had two, it was highly drinkable for me. cheers"
"Drinkability - Really smooth drinking English IPA. Fruity, bready, and sweet malts are balanced by floral and spicy hops. Similar to the Traditional Pale in terms of drinkability and balance. A great and dependable beer. Plus, at a price of $3.49 for a bomber I will never hesitate!"
"Because I am local to the brewery I am able to enjoy the Lost Sailor in both freshly poured growlers as well as 220z bottles. I do enjoy it in both delivery methods, as well as locally on draught."
"Drink was average, I'm not that anxious to have it again but it wasn't bad."
"thanks again mob2332"
"M/D: Medium bodied and quite smooth. Very drinkable, a nice example of an English IPA. A great deal as well for the price."
"Feels a little on the watery side, but goes down real easy and the lingering aftertaste wont let you forget what you just drank."
"Overall I like the name better than the beer. I probably would not buy a bottle again, but I would order it in a bar if seen on tap or cask."
"Mouthfeel is average and the carbonation seems perfect. This is a really easy one to drink, and the low ABV helps. I'd be curious to try this one fresher, but you can tell this was never intended to be a hop-bomb. Some great malt flavors a lot of IPAs are lacking, though."
"D: Good. Enjoyable, especially at these prices."
"Great job BBC! I enjoy when i brewery takes the time to create a well balanced easy drinking, yet very flavorful IPA. Most brewery's are more focused on who can shove the most hops down your gullet as apposed to creating something distinct and original."
"Overall verdict: My very favorite IPA. The hops are not off the hook, as tends to be the trend these days; it tastes great and is very drinkable, session-wise. Highly reccomended."
"Medium body with a good amount of tingly carbonation."
"I felt the bitter taste on the roof of my mouth and it lingered nicely on the back of my tongue. It was very pleasant and soft. ""Soft"" is the word that keeps coming to mind with this beer. Good balance of citrus hoppiness and smooth malt flavors. The mouthfeel is very creamy with little carbonation. There's nothing overbearing or offensive about this IPA. It's very enjoyable and drinkable and I'd recommend it for anyone who's just starting out with quality IPAs."
"Overall this is a good solid IPA. The price point is pretty fantastic as well ($3.99 a bomber when the next cheapest is $5.49)."
"D: Given that this is a low ABV beer and that it tastes quite good/interesting, I'd say that this has a pretty high drinkability. Thanks again Jake for this beer!"
"22oz bottle. Best By date of 04/05/11. Pours a semi-translucent light orange color with a thin head. Good lacing. Aroma of floral hops with a bit of citrus. Flavor is earthy and floral. Slight hop bitterness. Somewhat sweet. Good, cheap, sessionable IPA."
"Although not a powerhouse IPA I could happilydrink this often."
"slightly murky and unfiltered. pours a color not dissimilar to what the water looks like when it's been off for a while and gets turned back on. nice head with obvious carbonation. faint hop aroma in the nose with a hint of the malt and fruit. the taste is very different for an IPA. Slightly bitter, but not really. slight tropical fruit taste, almost like a #9 or even a Sculpin. Does lack the hop pungency that I love so much. Bottle dating is ambiguous since it says good until 4/5/11. I'm guessing that's a 6 month date (way too long for most IPAs) and if so that makes this one 2 months old. hard to tell. Overall, I like this one, but it's not your typical IPA and if you are looking for a giant hop bomb, you might be looking in the wrong place."
"D- Regardless of the strong earthiness of this IPA, the exquisite balance and smooth mouthfeel create a very drinkable beer."
"medium bodied mouthfeel, medium carbonation. crisp and refreshing. very drinkable. i could easily keep going with this. and since i have a growler, i guess i will. recommended, and the fresher the better."
"Drinkability: A beer to embrace, what with its pleasant mix of flavors and ease of drinkability, though those hoping for a bold, audacious, West Coast-style IPA may be frustrated with this."
"Mouthfeel is solid and has a bit of a creamy texture. Very nice. Overall a very enjoyable IPA, and its nice to have one with an English take on the style for a change."
"D-Like I said above, This beer doesn't try to overwhelm you with hops. It's a solid IPA with no pretense. Worthy of being part of you ""everyday"" beer line up."
"Overall, a really solid IPA that is crisp and refreshing and not overpowering. Very enjoyable."
"From the 22 oz. bottle with an expiration date of 04/05/11. Sampled on Oct. 23, 2010. The pour is a cloudy amber-orange tone with yellow highlights. About two inches of soapy off-white head float along the top and stick around. Various herbs, pine, and mellow hops tickle the nose. Whle the taste also features these sensations there is also a pleasant, laid back sweet maltiness mixed in. The hops on the whole are more subtle than some IPA's and for me that is magnificent. But for those of you who like your IPA's hoppy, you might not be as satisfied. Just right for me though."
"Mouthfeel is a bit carbonated, giving a crispness. The alcohol is none existent. Great standard for an IPA."
"Thanks BBC"
"This is a great example of an IPA that is damn good without sacrificing complexity in favor of being a hop bomb. Without a doubt, one of the better values I've seen in a while at less than $5 for 22oz."
"My grandfolks live in the Berkshires, and for the past few years Berkshire Brewing Company (BBC) beers are all I'll drink when I'm in Pittsfield. For 8 bucks or so (with a 1.50 deposit) on a 64oz growler this IPA can't be beat, except maybe by one of their others beers available locally. This beer pours out cloudy and yellow, with a hoppy and herbal scent, and a taste to match. Exceptionally well made, and my favorite English style IPA. Drink Local!"
"Served in a traditional pint glass, this poured a cloudy, dark orange with a one-finger off-white head and exceptional lacing. The nose is citrus (grapefruit and pineapple) and floral hops but also some sweeter fruits (like peach) and sweet caramel malts. The latter is there in the taste along with the expected pine and citrus. This is a familiar combination but the total is not like most other IPAs. The mouthfeel is lighter than medium and smooth. Carbonation was moderate to light and the aftertaste was not overly bitter. The hops here are overcome with the sweetness. Not an all-time favorite but this was nice and, at 5.5% ABV, would be quite sessionable."
"Good drinkability. Solid IPA. Even keeled."
"***from notes***"
"D-Not enough pop in the taste department for me to want more than one."
"Overall, I think we've become accustomed to drinking these huge IPA's that we forget with a subtle but essential use of hops tastes like. Would have liked a bit more hop bite, but this one is just right. Not something that I think stands up to food well, but a refreshing brew overall. Very worthy."
"D: Easy to drink, low abv, simple. Good stuff."
"A few of the flavors in this beer are dangerous for my enjoyment of a beer. The sweet malt, the straight bitterness, the herbal and pine hops without any citrus, but they never get out of line here. More to the point, they never stop complimenting each other and everything else in the flavor. Another subtle, well-balanced, beautifully crafted beer from Berkshire Brewing Company, for a low price."
"I don't have alot of experience with English-style IPAs but this is great stuff. Those expecting an American hop bomb may be disappointed, but those who appreciate an easy-drinking well-balanced IPA should really pick this up."
"Notes: I love how the carmelly, malt sweetness holds up against the bitter hops - it strikes a really great balance. I think this is very drinkable, very good."
"D - Extremely drinkable. At just 5.5%, I could easily down a few pints of this. Delicious!"
"22oz bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium golden-yellow with a large, fluffy head. Almost no smell but an extremely faint hint of hops. Taste is comparable to a light adjunct beer with a little bit more pronounced hop flavor - almost entirely flavorless, very watery, and one-dimensional. The hops that are present are faintly medicinal tasting, and the body of the beer seems to be non-existant, except perhaps a small amount of very light grain and/or adjuncts. Mouthfeel is almost nothing, it is lightly carbonated even for a smoother beer. Very drinkable, but not enjoyable."
"D: Very drinkable, well blended taste and feeling with a moderate abv which is nice."
"Wow, this was really good on the nitro draft. Served with a thick creamy off white head and lots of lace. Color was a clear medium amber. Aroma was malt, roasty, toffee, and hoppy. Flavor was excellent and perfectly balanced for the style malt to hop and like aroma. Killer body and carbonation. The bitter to sweet ration leaned ever so slightly sweet and left me wishing I could get this when I got home."
"D- A great IPA that really surprised me."
" Taste is hoppy but not in your face, easy drinking and smooth. Mouthfeel is very full and crisp with a good malty backbone. Carbonation is light, perfest for an english ipa."
"D - This is the kind of beer that makes you wish it were socially acceptable to refuse to share a growler. I could drink this beer all night any day of the year."
"D- This was a very nice and drinkable IPA. The balance on it makes it a nice non-hop bomb drinker that I will be sure to get again and again when I can."
"D:"
"After the first glass I was resigned that the beer is generally solid & worth a few repeat visits should I have the chance. After the second glass I am inclined to say this beer would be in regular rotation as a slightly-more-than-occasional treat, were it readily available."
"D: Incredibly smooth and perfectly balanced IPA, and one that I would happily enjoy a few of at a time. One of my favorites."
"D - This is a nice ipa on a warm day. Fruity and sweet."
"The feel is pretty smooth, goes down well with a nice medium body. It is a bitter SOB but is a really enjoyable IPA."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it was a very good English style IPA. It had some very good flavors and was a pretty easy drinking beer overall."
"D - This is a very easy beer to drink. I would suggest this beer to someone that does not necessarily like IPA's. It has great fruit flavor and goes down smooth."
"One of those beers I never buy at the beer store yet always seem to be drinking when I go out."
"The aroma was distinctly hoppy. The taste was a balanced blend of hoppy and malty. I was expecting a hoppier beer, I suppose I was expecting an American IPA. Still this is a well brewed, balanced beer. I think I would like it more on a hot summer day."
"A: Golden ruby color, thin head - 3.50, S: Quite biscuity, slight lemon zest, malts seem to have a slightly heavier hand than hops though balance is decent - 3.50, T: Strong hop bite, very earthy and biscuity, lots of grapefruit, solid representation of an English IPA - 4.00, M: Medium bodied with a hint of silkiness - 4.00, D: English IPAs are not generally my style but I can certainly appreciate a nicely crafted one - 4.00"
"D- I would drink two bombs if i could"
"Nice East Coast IPA. Give it a try when in New England."
"Goes down easy."
"D) A decent IPA. I'd have another."
"D- High. Wish I bought more than 1 bomber of this... and next time I will clear them out! A great sessionable, flavorful, and affordable IPA. Bravo!"
"Vigorous pour into a snifter produced a nice tight two finger head that fades to a lacing, bright copper color, clear, decent carbonation. Nice balance of herbal hops and caramel maltiness in the nose. Taste is also a good balance of herbal hops and malt sweetness, clean, a touch of citrus with the malt in the finish. A nice medium body with good carbonation throughout. Very easy drinking, could pair with many light dishes as well as some heavier fare (think fried food) but may be over powered by hearty and robust food. I could put down several at a bar-b-q without a second thought. Will buy again."
"Thanks to shaebs99 for this excellent bonus."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle to a pint glass. Orange/amber with a decent head, that lasted ok but didn't lace very well. The aroma was surprisingly malty sweet for an ipa, with only a subtle hint of hop bitterness or citrus. The taste had a little more lemon/orange essence, but the finish fell flat. The body was much thinner than expected. Like the Steel Rail Pale Ale, I wouldn't session this beer due to lack of flavor."
"D - I enjoyed this one, a refreshing brew."
"D: Decent enough, but tastes sort of off. Maybe an old bottle? I couldn't find the best before date even though I know BBC dates their stuff. Hmmm..."
"A bit darker than most IPA's, which is just fine. Nice little bite of bitter on the back of the tongue, and a slightly fruit finish, with apples coming through very clearly, especially in the aftertaste. Superbly session able though as this was a very easy drinker and I could have thrown this one down all night long to be honest."
"Out of a 22 oz bottle poured into my BBC pint glass, this pours a hazy golden amber color with a really nice think head on it, one of my favorite beers to look at. Brewed locally in south deerfield, MA. make sure you get it at a store that sells it regularly, it must be enjoyed as fresh as possible, there's really no buffer zone. At 1st taste it really warms you, then the hop finish comes through and bites you. I would say it is more piney than citrus. fitting for a beer made for the berkshire mountain folk. overall one of my favorite ipa's. and i love supporting the local business. so it works on all levels. BBC lost sailor goes best with oysters or any raw clam. So if you're a fan of those you will definitely be a fan of lost sailor, share some with your four legged friend for good measure!"
"I hate to bag on this if it is old, and I know the ""English"" style doesn't pride itself on strong citrus or pine hop flavors. This is a good beer, just not memorable at all."
"Cheers!"
"22oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured a hazy amber with a two inch dense, frothy, off-white head. Head eventually recedes into a solid half-inch cap; thick bands of lacing coat the glass as the brew recedes. Nose reveals sweet caramel notes and citrus - not getting much in terms of hops here. Taste is less sweet than indicated by the nose and also reveals some biscuity notes with citrus astringency coming out at the finish. Mouthfeel is just shy of medium with a lively, slightly prickly sensation across the tongue. Pretty enjoyable, easy drinking and sessionable - a hop bomb this is not, but seems pretty style consistent."
"Reviewed on 05/20/2009. On tap at Willimantic Brewing. Pours a clear brown/amber with a small white head. Aroma of crystal malt and resiny hops. Flavor largely of iced tea, with some light pale malts. Way too sweet, so I didn't really enjoy this one."
"Easy drinking for sure and very flavorful."
"Cheers!!"
"Creamy texture with a lingering finish and not much bitterness. I just finished a bomber and I want another one... or two. For an IPA, that has to be 5 for drinkability."
"Poured a hazy amber color with 1 finger of white head into a goblet. OK retention, nice lacing. Smells of fruits, honey, toasted grains, and citrus. Tastes of floral hops, toasted grains, honey, and citrus zest with some grassy notes in the finish. Medium body, little carbonation. Somewhat thin and watery with some syrup-likeness as well. Pretty toasty and sweet with very little lasting bitterness. Easy to drink and refreshing, but not bitter enough for me to regularly want to choose when in the mood for an IPA."
"D - Decent IPA overall, although extremely average in the mouthfeel department. The malt profile was quite nice, but the hop character could benefit from the addition of more citrus hops, which would work nicely with the grainy malt aspect of this IPA."
"A very nice beer, probably my fav. English IPA. The subtle fruit characteristic works really well with earthy hops. Definitely different from most hop bombs, great for session drinking."
"Brewery sealed growler. Clear amber with a dense beige cap. Thick lace and great head retention. Spicy citrus aroma with tangerine and papaya notes with toasted malt. Solid bitterness that stayed well balanced with the toasty, biscuity malt flavour. Hops were an orange/grapefruit combination. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation, slight dryness. Great texture and flavour, very well balanced."
"This is nectar from the Gods. 64 ounces of delicious, frothy, full bodied heaven. Strong aromas of citrus, almonds and vanilla. Pours an excellent clean strong head that clings to the glass with all it's might. This is a beer to experience with friends. Enjoy!"
"Thanks to brothercannon for bringing me a few Berkshire bottles back from VT. Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Appears a hazed rich apricot color with a full two fingers of fluffy off white foam. A sticky lace is left on the inside of my glass with each sip. Smells and tastes of floral hops, various citrus fruits, mainly lemon, pale malts, a touch of sweet caramel, earthy hops. This ale is certainly medium bodied and amply carbonated for it's style. This bomber was drained rather quickly and I look forward to enjoying this one again."
"D - A decent IPA. Easy enough to drink but not all that compelling."
"Final Thoughts - This was the first beer I tried from BBC. Awesome choice, as it clearly is their best. One of my favorite IPAs!"
"taste initially seemed a bit watered down. flavors don't seem to blend well - the malt and the hops seem to collide rather than play nicely together. the hop lingers around the edges of the mouth, kinda crisp overall but soft on the tongue. while not the greatest mouthfeel, still able to drink a decent amount of it."
"Interesting, but I do not remember having a beer with a nice aroma that gets intrusive so fast."
"This is a hop-forward citrusy IPA that's not too in-your-face so it stays fairly drinkable. There is a bit of abrasiveness to the hops in the finish that keeps it from being super drinkable. Overall, a decent IPA."
"I'm not a fan of IPA's, let alone those that are dry-hopped but I had to grab a log of this on short notice. As far as hoppy beers go, this is certainly one of the easiest to drink. It's nice because it's not quite as dry or bitter as some other hoppy beers. I wouldn't buy this again, but for those IPA lovers I'd certainly suggest picking it up."
"This beer makes you wish more breweries had the guts to make an IPA that didn't rely on bushels upon bushels of hops."
"This is one of the original India Pales that got me interested in the style. Lets see how it turns out having not had it for some time. Poured in to a traditional English pint glass a hazy orange, with a bit more than a ring of white lacing. Smell is of grapefruit, and light, delicate hops that give off various citrus aromas. Slightly metallic smell, and a smell that reminds me of ringwood yeast. Hit of honey oriented malt in the beginning, followed by light, floral hops. It leaves a mild numbing effect on the palate. This beer has a very complex hop profile, but not in your face, or over the top like so many others. Feel of this beer is really well rounded out, not too big, but not too light. Drinking this is helped out immensely by the balance of malt and hops. As it has been said before, this is one of the best for its style that New England has to offer. It is a pity that there aren't so many English varieties of this style more widely available, as I think they are every bit as complex and good as their American counterparts. I will make sure to include this as an extra in trades I make in the future. Cheers, and happy St. Pattys Day."
"D: A nice English IPA with a strong Fuggles/Goldings influence but clearly care in malting was present which speaks well of the first Berkshire offering I've had the chance to try."
"Doesn't knock my socks off but it's a solid, nice drinking, delicious IPA."
"D - I consider this high in drinkability w/ fresh hop & yeast flavors. Great balance and high on the quaffability scale for an English IPA and fits the style well"
"Overall this is an above-average IPA, though I think it could be better with more malt flavor. Still, certainly worth a shot."
"D - At this ABV and classic flavors so well balanced, a session for sure."
"This beer poured an deep orange amber, slightly hazy, 2 finger foamy white head, with nice thick sticky lacing. Nose is of malts, caramel balanced with some nice hops notes and bit of spice. Taste is of hops with great balanced backbone of malt. I am quite impressed by the balance of this beer. Definitely makes you want to come back for more! Mouthfeel is medium body, very smooth going down, not much of an aftertaste. Great IPA that I could definitely sit with for a session."
"Thanks to Reagan1984 for throwing this in on a recent trade. Straight from the bomber to pint, this pours a light orange/amber color with frothy, off-white one+ finger head. There is a definite hop character to the smell, with a tart, citrus background. The taste follows this trend, as there is a nice citrus background to the bitter hops. The hops do not overwhelm due to a nice balance with the malt. It is a really smooth, easy drinking IPA, with no overbearing carbonation either. I really like this IPA, a citrusy hops character balanced with a sound malt backbone, and no overdone carbonation. I wish I lived in New England, I could see me drinking many of these this Spring if I did."
"Have I said FRESH...:) you can really tell this beer is different from others. All around The Ipa I would reach for in a session."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with some carbonation."
"wow. This is one of the better IPAs I've had recently, and pure drinkability in terms of finishing the glass in front of me was amazing. I could easily session a few bombers - and I rarely say that about any brew. Mouthfeel and flavor were brilliant... leaving me craving more. If I have the opportunity to get a few more bottles, I will in a heartbeat."
"Drinkability: Overall, this is a very enjoyable IPA that is hoppy, malty, yet refined and balanced. The smoothness in the profile really makes this a standout IPA. Excellent job."
"I got this beer in the 1/2 gallon gowler, fresh from the brewery. Slightly hazy, light to medium-amber color. Big, cream-colored, velvety, draft-like head. Wonderfully fresh, hoppy, and cotton-candy/dextriney nose. Slight pine and citrus peel notes with the hops. Smooth, medium-bodied mouth feel. Very natural and draft-like. Fresh, very well-balanced and long flavor. Delicious! Incredibly complex (as opposed to simply powerful) hoppy tones. Nicely balanced, w/ caramel and butterscotch toasted maltiness to provide good counterbalance to the hoppiness. A rather lightly toasted and hoppy IPA, though bodisome and full. This is a great, savory, sophisticated IPA. Although the bottled version is good, it's definitely worth getting the growler."
"Great drinkability! Proud to be a local. Another great offering from BBC! Cheers"
"Drinkability: Solidly drinkable and really low in alcohol, making it very sessionable. I enjoyed this one a lot, though it's not a style I've partaken too much in. The hop profile on this one was very unique, and perhaps with a few more complexities thrown in, this one would be a big, big winner."
"This is a very good beer. There is just the right balance of hopiness, drinkablity, and finish in this beer. The brewers at BBC really know what they are doing. I have made the trip to the brewery for the tour twice now. This is one of there better beers."
"Picked up a 22oz bottle, but then again all I see BBC beers in are 22oz bottles. Poured into a Guinness pint glass. The color is a very light copper. Leaves a head that's about a finger thick and has pretty good retention. A different smell for an IPA...more malty than hoppy. Has some hint of citrus as well. The hops are there, but they are hidden a bit by the sweet malt. The taste is well balanced, but as with the aroma, it's more malt than hops. It's a sweet taste (caramel?), and a noticable bitterness to it. It leaves a fair amount of stickiness in the mouth. Light to medium bodied and it drinks easy. I've had this before and I will have it again."
"Tried this IPA from a 22oz bomber. Great head formation with good lacing during session, initial notes are citrus and malt. Finishes most triumphantly to a great light floral hop character. BBC is a brewery that puts out great tasting beer! We are lucky to have them around."
"D - This is a very easy to drink IPA with a good taste to it that I could session worth trying"
"Friend brought this to Jersey from up in Connecticut -- she studies at Sacred Heart University and spoils my laziness by bringing me quality New England craft beers. Pours beautiful golden pale ale. Tastes of hops, citrus, blended light tropical fruits. Very good IPA, better than expected."
"Notes from 10/26/06"
"I will try it again."
"Had a 22oz bomber. Pours a great hazy amber color with an awesome white head. There is excellent lacing to this beer also. Has an aroma of pine and citrus. Has a taste of pine and a little citrus. Hard to make out. Not bitter at all and does not have an overpowering taste to it. Has a high drinkability to it though due to the lightness of it. Definitely not the best IPA but an allright one."
"Had a pint tonight at Woody's. Paired well with a pizza with some spicy toppings. Slight orange color, decent white head. Mild carbonation. Spicy smell of pine. Plenty of hops in the taste. A bit lighter in the mouthfeel than other IPAs. A pretty good IPA, didn't blow me away. Not something I want to drink all night, but if you like hops, this will more than satisfy."
"An above average IPA right here, I've had better but I've had many that were worse. It is pretty damn hoppy but the taste could be improved a tad. It's all blended together well and is a well balanced beer and I'd like to try more from this brewery."
"D: This is a really drinkable brew. Although the mouthfeel is thin, the look, aroma and taste make up for it. The thin-ness makes it go down easy and makes it very drinkable. The ABV is light and doesn't really rear its head. Pretty good beer."
"Notes: A killer EIPA in terms of drinkability. Thanks to DrDogBeer for the extra... this is a great, extremely easy drinker that I'd be happy to have access to. Makes me wanna try more Berkshire brews."
"Pours a yellow amber golden with a lively head that collapses to no lacing. The aroma is sickly sweet. The flavor is light and malty but a bit out of balance. Piney hops give it an odd, resiny sweet quality. Slight bitterness and resiny feel on the end. The mouthfeel is surprisingly thin. This is an Ok IPA but nothing to go out of the way for. It improves as it warms, becoming a light and reasonably balanced ale, though still light on the hops even by English style standards."
"thanks tprokop7"
"Mouthfeel is a smooth medium body, and it drinks very easily. Very nice English IPA and a great alternative to the many hoppier IPAS for non-hop heads."
"Overall-well balanced IPA, hop heads will hate it but I do appreciate that it's an approachable and drinkable version of this ever more extreme style. Tasted great on a hot summer day."
"D- While it was a tad watered down to me, it was not bad for the style. I will stick to my American IPA's and their hop profiles. I am a hophead for sure, but his beer is not bad at all; just not my style."
"If you're a Hop freak, you should look elsewhere. If you enjoy a bit sweeter milder IPA, give it a shot."
"Lost Sailor makes for a great session IPA and something interesting to pack for camping or a BBQ when you don't want lots of bottles and cans around. Plus, it doubles as a musical instrument when you're done!"
"D: Quite good. Quaffable and tasty. The lack of hop bite makes it easier to put back."
"Overall this was a decent IPA, very session able with an interesting little twist of the flavor. I would love to try it on tap and see if it comes off a touch fresher. Definitely solid though and has not tarnished my opinion of Berkshire in the slightest."
"D, notes: Good sessionability. Moderate bitterness clearly makes this an English IPA."
"D: Very sessionable IPA, one of the best for this category."
"D- I consider this a very ""dignified"" IPA that doesn't punish the drinker at a modest 5.5%. I personally appreciate this and I think this beer is full of character. It's nice to drink an IPA bomber to myself and not feel irreparably impaired with a scorched tongue (don't get me wrong, sometimes I crave these ipa's, its just nice to see some diversity). Very nice."
"If this brew were available locally I'd definitely pick one up now & then. I also think it would be a stellar beer to use to introduce someone to the gentler, kinder side of well-made beers. Now I'm looking forward the BBC Raspberry Barleywine that was resting next to it!"
"22 oz. bottle with no visible freshness date; unfiltered and unpasteurized. It pours a lightly-hazy, dark amber color with medium carbonation, topped with a three-finger, light tan head that deposits a good amount of lace. Nice and hoppy in the nose, with notes of citrus, pine, aspirin and a bit of earthiness. On the palate it is all this, plus leafy and fruity hops, tasty grapefruit, a medium bitterness, and some sweet and buttery flavors from the malts. The beer is medium in carbonation and body, with a dry, hoppy finish. All in all, this is a tasty, easy-to-drink IPA that has a flavorful and complex hop profile."
"Pours a light orange amber, with a fluffy white head that slowly fades. The smell is subtle with an understated hop scent about it. The taste is of mild floral hops, with a slight bitterness. It has a good balance and the hoppiness is not as powerful as in other IPAs. Is very drinkable and is especially good for those who don't like the strong hop flavor usually present in IPAs."
"Milky smooth feel; Mild film leaves a bitter aftertaste (a good thing). Either an American ESB or a British IPA. Really drinkable and nice; a hoppy pale-ish ale with some distinction."
"Drinkability is very good, this a great IPA, and one of the best IPAs that I have tasted coming out of mass. The second beer I have tasted from Berkshire Brewing and I am very pleased."
"A pretty good IPA in my book."
"This is a good IPA but not spectacular. The beer pours a nice amber color with some head, lacing, retention. This is quite a mild IPA, not bursting with hoppiness, perhaps a bit of nutty flavors, some grapefruit, sweet malts, and a decent amount of carbonation. This beer is mild enough and thus highly drinkable. L'Chaim."
"So, I dinged this beer a bit for not being quite to style, even for an English IPA, but that being said, in and of itself, a fantastic beer. It's one of the most interesting I've had in quite a while. I wish I had a case of this stuff. Really, really great."
"Pours a cloudy orange/ gold color. Nice creamy head. Leaves nice lacin. Nice piney hop aroma, not overwhelming. Taste is very smooth for an IPA. Good Hop flavor and slight bite, but balanced very well with the malts so it goes down and finishes very easy. Great flavor, and superb drinkability. I wnjoyed it more as I drank on."
"Smell was mildly hoppy, with tons of big malt aromas. Smells a little bit grainy. A bit of citrus was noticed deep in the background. Taste was almost identical to the smell. Big malt backbone on this one with a medium hop flavor. More graininess. Pretty well balanced in my opinion. Not too bad. Had a nice smooth, medium bodied mouthfeel that was pretty clean and crisp. Just enough carbonation to tickle the tongue. Great drinkability and very refreshing. A pretty good English I.P.A. from Berkshire Brewing."
"D: A real sessioner, this beer has a nice one-two punch of malt and hops."
"Pours a rich golden color with a decent head. Aroma is of hops and malt with the hops showing through quite well. Taste is mostly bready with a very subdued bitterness. Aftertaste is biscuity and buttery smooth. It's very much like an English IPA with the malt showing through more. There's a decent fruitiness upfront as well. Not too bad. Not quite what I'd find to be impressive though."
"A cloudy tea colored brew with solid light tan head and good fluffy lacing. The aroma is a mild malt and apple blend with a curious nutty presence in the background. The first taste gets a tingly carbonation that's bready with a lemon background. Nice body feel with a hint of malt throughout. An easy drinking middle ground IPA with only minor hops but a pleasant overall outcome. A mild choice that should be acceptable to most ale fans. Recommended for a try and better I think than the bottled version I had earlier."
"Having this one in another one of their great pint bottles. Its appearance is golden and murky. Heavy, creamy head appeared after the pour. The expected smells of citrus are there but surprisingly they seem restrained comparatively. Sure I have here some great hop smell but it was fainter and less potent than I would expect. Its taste makes up for it by having its usual great bitter punch on the taste buds. A great carbonation keeps this drink alive and crisp after a long period of time. Overall, not the best IPA but pretty good in taste."
"This was my first Berkshire beer and color me impressed. True to style and very drinkable. I'm looking forward to trying more from these guys soon."
"Pours a hazy dark golden color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy off-white head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is hoppy, nice blend of citrus and pines, and some caramel. The taste is very hoppy, slight sweetness, good dose of citrus/pines, and some caramel. There is a nice chewiness to this brew. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is my third Berkshire, so far so good, very tasty brew's, impressed."
"Very nice to drink, very refreshing. A very good beer."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a full rich golden with an almost creamy-like head atop settling into a white froth leaving broken globs of lace behind as it settled slowly.Not a real big hop element in the nose somewhat leafy and citric with a little caramel and juicy malt fruit for sure an English interpretation.Mild hop flavors leafy and herbal with a tinge of citrus,a big sweetish caramel biscuit base goes toe to toe with the hops making it more of a balanced IPA.Eh its ok not remarkable but drinkable."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, judging by the taste it seems to me that this beer should be listed as an English IPA rather than an American IPA. However, overall, its a pretty good beer."
"The flavor is mild overall with some caramel hitting my lips and then flowing to some slightly bitter sappy hops, but finishes back with malt and a grainy flavor. There is no hint of ABV and the beer goes down very easily. I think this is a nice example of an IPA that isnt hopped out to the extreme and maintains drinkability and balance. A nice beer from a good brewery, my only complaint is the overly mild carb and thin body."
"still, a lovely, ""sessionable"" IPA, at only 5.5%"
"Not really a hop fix for a hophead, but definitely a quality beer. A well crafted beer and very enjoyable. When I want a real hop fix I can just look to the many DIPA's available, but feel that a traditional IPA should not have overpowering hop character. Very drinkable. I will be immensely pleased when Berkshire is distributed to NY."
"I've had it on tap and from a 22 oz. bottle and prefer the tap version. Pairs well with food when I've tasted it BBC beer dinners."
"Mouthfeel - Average, nothing really stands out. Carbonation is light, finish is slightly bitter but ends cleanly. A relatively drinkable beer, but not enough flavor to make it really enjoyable."
"Unpasterized bottle, unfiltered and fresh from Massachusetts trip. Good head, with a citrus hop aroma. Very smooth, and balanced understated IPA, almost like an English IPA though even less bitter and not dry but fruity. Must be appreciated, well done."
"Poured a cloudy orange-amber, with a finger of tight head composed of tiny bubbles. Smelled floral and biscuity -- quite inviting. The flavors perfectly balance each other -- a bouquet of floral and leafy hops hit the tongue, open up into a bit of fruity yeast, and the whole thing finishes like challah -- sweet eggy bread. This is as ""comfort beer"" as IPA gets, in my opinion."
"OK and very drinkable. True to style. I like my IPAs with more hops, but that is a personal thing."
"This is a great brew for the summer, and for someone like me who isnt too familiar with IPAs, I enjoyed it. cheers!"
"A 22oz bomber poured into a pint glass. Hazy orange color with a medium head and some decent lacing. It had a predominately floral aroma. A nice, subdued citrus flavor, a little peppery later. Not overly hopped, a very pleasant beer. You could drink a few of these without blasting your palate."
"22oz bomber bottle pours into the glass a hazy orange. Smells sweet and floral. Taste is on the sweet side for an IPA but there is a lot going on here. Aromas are from both the malt and hops. The hop flavors contain citrus notes of orange and grapefruit which is similar to other IPA's only they do not dominate the flavor profile like an American style IPA. There is certainly enough hop flavor and aroma to keep the drinker interested, but the hops blend more than showcase. This is a beer and a brewery that I visit and revisit often. Berkshire never dissappoints as their beers are complex and balanced."
"I absolutely love the Berkshires, but the native beer not so much, at least this one. It seems what's not thin is almost cacophonous and out of place. You can tell it wants to be a solid IPA, but it doesn't seem to know the way. Drinking is by no means a chore, but it doesn't bring a lot of joy either. I'm not so sure this sailor is actually lost- I think maybe he's hiding."
"Pours with a marmalade color and a bright white, tight-bubbled, long lasting head. The nose is quite hoppy, but typical to the English style and not the American. Earthy notes instead of citrus, grass instead of metals, etc... along with a toasted, biscuity malt backing. Subdued and very nice. On the palate, pale malt sweetness first off, which lasts through the mid-palate. Some lightly citric and spicy hop oils crop up next to growing, tea-like bitterness. The finish has some marshmallow-like sweetness, but it's not overly sweet as finishes go. Mouthfeel is only medium in thickness and pretty light in carbonation; that makes the beer sit a little heavier on the palate than it should, but it's such a light beer that it ends up not mattering much. Overall, a very good, pretty mild, extremely drinkable IPA in the English style. Probably my favorite BBC beer so far."
"This is a fine IPA which could go up against the best. I don't think it has dislodged my favorite (Stone), but it comes awfully close."
"I like this IPA. Above average and I would have again because of the freshness rating."
"So smooth and creamy could just sit here and drink bomber after bomber. As easy drinking as can be. I would love to get my hands on more of this delicious brew."
"This one didn't wow me in any areas and, aside from a fairly ""blah"" appearance, actually did a fairly decent job with the style. I'd have it again no problem, it's just not overly memorable."
"Thinner medium body. Good carbonation. Slightly bitter aftertaste. An enjoyable beer, but pretty average."
"22 .oz bomber poured into a clean pint glass . With the Hoodoo Gurus on the Hi-Fi it is time to review this brew . Beige colored 2 finger head which sticks around for awhile .Smells of hops and malts . Very cloudy too . This is another winner from the BBC . Still does not beat the Coffehouse Porter & Cabin Fever ...Good to see that they got some "" ink"" in the Boston Globe the other day . It can be read at Boston.com just type Berkshire Brewery . Good stuff"
"This poured with a big, bone-white head with low retention. There was a lot of floating particulate in this honey/golden-yellow colored beer with a viscous appearance. The nose had a lightly hoppy presence. The mouthfeel was somewhat thin, which was unexpected, given its appearance in the glass. The taste was only lightly hoppy and kind of disappointing. The finish had a floral quality, but still tended more towards sweet. I've had better beers from BBW."
"This is my go-to beer these days. The hop aroma indicates a lovely dry-hopping that exudes real character. The hop bitterness is there but nicely balanced with an underlying malt backbone. In the glass the creamy head holds up and leaves lace all down the side. This is one well-balanced, tasty brew that never seems to disappoint"
"D: Was pleasantly surprised with the way this beer tasted, as the hops were present but subdued, in a good way. That made it easy to drink, along with the creamy and slightly oily mouthfeel. Good stuff."
"This is one of the better English style IPA's that I've tasted."
"Pours a light orange yellow with a giant white foamy head. The color is lighter than most IPA's. The smell has a bread yeast and hop citrus aroma to it,but is a little on the light side. The taste is ""bisquity"" and some citrus hops,not as strong as American IPA's,but a nice smooth English version. A very good tasting beer. The m/f is light and the flavors are very well balanced. An excellant English IPA that should not be missed. Cheers."
"Overall a very drinkable EIPA. An excellent session beer. Would love to try this beer on tap."
"DA: Oooooh, easily drinkable and rather enjoyable."
"This is a very drinkable beer and as with all of Berkshire Beers it tastes fresh and crisp. I have not been disappointed by a Berkshire Brewing product and this is no exception."
"Pours an opaque orange amber color with a finely textured tan head. Hoppy aroma with fruity overtones is inviting. Mouthfeel is lush and creamy. Nicely balanced maltiness blends with the herbal hoppiness. Not a particularly aggressive IPA, this one is more about maintaining a nice balance with the maltiness and it succeeds quite well. A solid, easy drinking offering."
"D: This one goes down VERY easy, not filling at all either. Its a beer well-worth pounding."
"22oz bottle purchased from Charles Street Liquors in Boston. The bottle was unrefrigerated, although Berkshire's website says that all of their products must be refrigerated. Pours a lovely cloudy gold. Not much in the way of head or lacing. Medium aroma of hops. First taste is very pleasing, and fills the mouth with fullness. Well-balanced hoppy and fruity taste. A pleasure to drink."
"Pours out a hazy dark orangy amber color. Nice clean thick white head and great lacing of the pint glass. Smells very floral and sweet. Nice strong citrusy hop smell make for the great aromas from this IPA. I have had this beer many times before but never had the opportunity to write a review. I have enjoyed it on tap, from a 22oz. and from a growler. But the smell, coloration and well rounded flavors hold true anyway it is served. Nice smooth flavor. Mild hop flavor at first followed by a nice strong bittering aftertaste. Great hop flavor and suttle malt sweetness. Not an extreemly heavy IPA but it has nice body and great overall IPA characteristics. Extreemly drinkable and enjoyable. Great tasting brew that keeps getting beter with each sip. I look forward to having this beer wherever it is avaliable. BBC has made a great IPA that will be right on top of my favorite list. Way to brew another winner in my book!!"
"This pours a hazy orange color with an everlasting head. Lemons and grapes dominant the nose. The taste has floral hops with a well balanced, almost fruity malt backbone. Albeit made in the good ole U.S. of A. this is definitely a British style IPA. This was refreshing after my usually intake of copius West Coast hop bombs. The British are more subtle than us loud asshole Americans, aren't they? ""FUCKIN' CAPPY'S!!!"""
"Nice creamy mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: this was what I like in an IPA - flavorful and very easy to quaff. This beer was very fresh on tap which let its flavors shine through. Try some of this."
"Hazy gold, with a frothy white head. Tons of lace, with good head retention. Really, the lacing is pretty awesome. I'm impressed. Very floral aroma. Is this one made/dry hopped with noble hops? Tettnang? Very unusual. Nicely balanced, pale malt maintaining a presence with some cereal sweetness. Taking a sip, it's real, real mellow, like any good session ale should be. Probably a bit too warm (feels warm on a mid-summer evening), but still nice. Pale malt sweetness with a grape-nuts cereal graininess and a little dab of caramel. Soft pear fruitiness, starting to dry out early. Modestly hopped finish, floral and citrusy, ending off incredibly dry, almost puckering. Not sour, just super duper dry. Full bodied, with nearly flat carbonation, in the true english style. The difference between this beer and the regular tap/bottle is night and day. Completely different hop feel. Unique, unusual, and pretty damn tasty. Hey, I went for thirds, if that says anything. Great english styled IPA."
"AN overall good IPA. Nice citrus aroma with very good mouthfeel. Nice dark amber color with no sediment when poured. Unbeleivable creamy head, more so than any other beer i have had in the last year. So much i scooped some out with a spoon and ate it like ice cream. MMMM MMM good. Cheers."
"Cheers!"
"I enjoyed Berkshire Coffeehouse Porter and I'm enjoying Lost Sailor IPA as well. I hadn't heard a whole lot about these guys and hadn't been able to sample their wares prior to my recent trade with MuddyFeet, but on the evidence of these two fine ales, they're a brewery to be reckoned with."
"The body is decent. Crisp and drinkable. Nice bite. Very drinkable. If only I could get something like this around here where intensely fruity IPAs are the standard."
"Drinkability: I could have many of these in a sitting and I would gladly keep this in my fridge for casual drinking experiences. It is probably my favorite IPA to date."
"D - low, not very impressed, my buddy and i actually poured it out"
"M & D: Mouthfeel and drinkability on this offering from Berkshire are both high. Nice and smooth drinking Ipa. Good carbonation with a nice sweet aftertaste. Creamy up front but slick when it goes down. One of the better Ipa's from New England region I've had recently. No complaints here as I had three of them!"
"Beer is good. Happy spot on IPA beering."
"Carbonation, again, is ideal. Medium-bodied, not a lite beer but not a big hop bomb either. A top-notch sessioner, particularly in warmer months."
"Very drinkable, very good. I will have this again."
"Traditional English Pale Ale, mixed with touches of rich fruit. It's a little overly bitter, but overall pretty good. Not really an IPA, but good none the less. This is a beer that I can imagine would be damn fine on cask. I'd have it again."
"This is more of a Pale ale than an IPA in my mind, but who am I? Looks fine a little chill haze with a decent head. The smell is the most perplexing art of this beer for me. I smelled it so much I got a little up my nose. Don't act like it has never happened to you :). Anyway it has this melon like canteloupe sweetness that I am guessing is from the hop combo, but it is not sharp instead very dull and intriguing. Not quite what I am looking for in an IPA. The taste was distort by the melon flavor the malt was there but there was no hop bite and it was undercarbonated. I finished it well enough, but the cantaloupe is not a fave of mine."
"I would like to have this beer again. I have a feeling there's more to it than you can really tell from one bottle."
"Really tasty, drinkable, and *delicate* IPA. It's not weak, it's just not huge, nor does it need to be. Highly recommended, and this is my favorite BBC beer I've had so far out of this, River Ale and Steel Rail."
"Verdict: awesome drinkability, a good pick to bring to a superbowl party and drink all afternoon. taste is not exceptional, but it also doesn't have any negative aspects. SOLID."
"overall, excellent! very drinkable IPA. quite light, but very flavourful at the same time. I really like this brew."
"22 oz. bottle. Hazy peach, big bubbles of carbonation rise to meet the thin wisps of lace atop. Sweet herbal hops in the nose, and quite floral and estery. Flavor is nicely balanced. The hops find the palate with a crisp bitter twang in the finish. The prelude to this is malt-dominated, with some herbal tea notes, caramel and strawberries. Carbonation is strong and spritzy. An very interesting American take on the style, and one I particularly enjoy. Session style for sure."
"Drinkability is decent a nice English/East Coast IPA just not something I would repeat buy. Want to thank B&G BIF and goodbyeohio for this local brew."
"Amazingly well-balanced beer. As a hop-head, I love the stong hop profile in this beer. Fruity esters play into a hand of hop flavor and hop bitter. All this amid a supporting wet malt sweet. The bomber is gone, I'm kinda lit, and I wish I had a bunch more of this one. Conclusion...if you and me work out a trade and you need to come up with one more beer on your end...this would be a good one to send. Cheers!"
"22oz bottle. Slightly golden orange with good clarity and a big fluffy off white head that left some nice lacing on the glass. Citric hops with a nice toasty and caramel malt base. Some sweetness and a bit of an idea tea scent going on. Flavor starts with some sweet caramel with some citric and floral hops. Lightly bitter and overall well balanced. Iced tea thing is going on in the flavor too. Good mouthfeel to it and pretty drinkable. A solid IPA all around but nothing that will really wow you."
"This was great at first but lost me in the end. Still, I'd really need to try it fresh from the brewery or from the bottle. The growler is not ideal for this ale."
"Very satisfying brew that's real easy to inhale. It has a lot of good going on in subtle ways."
"It's nice to see another good New England beer that really impresses me for its flavor and balance. I like this style, and I would like to have other beers like it."
"no freshness date. Beer has a orange/amber beercollor amd is hazy. Not much head due to low carbonisation. Nose is lots of hops giving a very peach and pine citrussym impression in good malts that itself shows a slight carramellic note and sweetness to the nose. Taste is good, hoppy and peachy again but good malted, not to sweet and overall well balanced. Not missing the carbonation most beers have and very well drinkable ""english"" like brew."
"Drinkability and Notes  Good drinkability, as long as you arent a hophead looking for your IPA fix. This is another solid beer from Berkshire, solid but not phenomenal. A good intro to IPAs for people afraid of excessive bitterness."
"A good drinkable IPA, but some of the spicy and citris flavours carried over into the aftertaste which I didn't really care for."
"Wow, Lost Sailor IPA is one of the better English IPA's I've tried. Tasty, with some unusual characteristics, and easily drinkable. Was $3.45 for the bottle at Charles St. Liquors in Boston and worth my money."
"Highly drinkable beer if I could get it down my way. Rumor has it they will be exporting this very soon, I can only hope."
"Overall = A great IPA, one of the better i've tasted from the US. Probably the highest drinkability of any I've tried so far. Greatly recommended for IPA fans."
"Well done BBC, again."
"The smell is slightly apple-ish and alcohol is quite present. Woody elements too. Taste is a sharp bite and and then smooths out like a pale ale more than an IPA. Probably would be better served on the colder side.Mine is probably about 45-50 fahrenheit and it seems like it could benefit from being a tad colder. I still think its a decent beer."
"the hops in the flavor are covered by a corny sweetness and mild honey notes. refreshing.. my idea of a lawnmower beer. as are most bbc beers except for the flavorful octoberfest which i cherish. not the complexity i was hoping for but very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Wow! Bottle. Best by June. The beer poured with very little head and was a deep orange in color. The aroma is tangerine. The taste is surprising. Not a very hoppy IPA, almost pale ale in its kick. Also, melon came through nicely on the tongue. The mouthfeel was nice and crsip. I notice the malts and they were perfectly balanced by the hops. Not too much of a kick, but just enough to remind me they were there. I was tempted to open te secind bomber, but decided to hold off for another day."
"Drinkable? Yes, Yes, and Yes!"
"Straight from the growler. Pours into a pint glass nicely, appearing a dark almost drab amber color with a substantial head. Smell is mellow, musty, with a floral hop scent and a sweet bready malty body. Taste has just enough hops to be considered an IPA. Remember, we're talking English style here. More subdued and not so flamboyantly American. I love American IPAs but this has it's merits too. Nice and buttery and biscuity as in a classic English ale, yet with some nice bitter hops at the end. Malt doesn't hide in this one either, it's right up front with the hops. Real smooth and creamy mouthfeel, almost cask-like. A great example of the style to show us that hops are used in all kinds of different ways."
"Overall: Am I a ruined hophead? Don't expect a hop monster here."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a big ol' 1 1/4"" light beige head above an amber brew. Head is quite dense, and laces nicely. Aroma is fruity malts. Taste is sedate malts, couple with a laid-back fruity hoppiness, fitting my idea of an English IPA to a T. Mouthfeel is excellent, smooth liek you wouldn't believe, which lends itself to superb drinkability. It's not a NW IPA, but is you're looking for a domestic UK-style IPA, check this out."
"Dark amber with a creamy white head of foam. Aromas of floral and citrusy hops as well as clean biscuity malts. Taste follows suit with an awesome UK hop profile and a lovely maltiness as wel. Mouthfeel=creamy and smooth with a nice bite as well. Drinkability is ace as well. Damn, this is not a UK IPA?"
"This poured a hazy orange to copper color with a thin white head that receded quickly and left a light sheet of lace on the side of the glass. Very fruity nose. Citrus, and more, I sense tart apple too. This unique character comes over in the flavor too. Bright citrus character with more tart apple/pear flavors. I, not sure if this comes from the hops, or the yeast strain used in the beer. Very appealing. Smooth mouth feel, seems very drinkable."
"Dark gold color with a small head that leaves little lacing and has some, but not a lot of retention. Very subtle smell. Some floral hops noticable, but nothing amazing. Nice flavor. This beer is extremely smooth on tap. One of th emost drinkable IPA's I've ever had before, but to me did not fully represent the style of a true IPA."
"Sampled/tasted from a fresh growler. orangy amber, bit cloudy, off white head, settling to a thin tiny bubble film, wispy lacing. Citrusy/piney hops in the nose. Full bodied and tasty. Hops bold, pine, resiny and also a wiff of grapefruit. Adds up to a complex hop offering. Lovely, smooth mouthfeel, flows over the tongue on a velvet blanket of sweet malt. Quality IPA, balanced, nuanced and worth checking out"
"Notes: Very well balanced. This is one of the better IPA's i have had because it is not west coast extreme bitter. It is nice to have a very balanced IPA with malt and sweet tastes to it. i was very impressed."
"This is one that I would probably have another of. Nothing spectactular, but worth a try if you are interested in English IPAs. Pretty drinkable as well, given the toned down hop profile."
"This IPA poured a cloudy, amber color with off-white foam that settled but clung to the glass and coated the glass. The smell was hoppy with some floral hops and some leafy hops together with some maltiness. Not overwhelming hoppy, however. The taste was hoppy with some grassy and citrus hops which gave a dry, somewhat woody flavor. There was a good malt backbone to this English style IPA. The mouthfeel was hoppy and dry with medium body and moderate carbonation. There was a bit of fruitiness in the aftertaste. This was a nice, not overpoweringly hopped IPA."
"Cheers!"
"Thanks to ppoitras for the bottle"
"This hazy amber beer forms a modest head, and looks much like many a British IPA. The aroma offers chocolate and coffee notes as well as a subtle hint of the citrus within. The Lost Sailor is a remarkably complex, and almost overly balanced brew. It pairs hop bitterness with a perfect compliments of malts that not only stand up to the abusive flavors but can compliment and almost surpass them in intensity. This balance is reminiscent of a barley wine, and is quite remarkable for a full bodied ale with such a modest alcohol content. If there weren't so many beers to try at the HopHead throwdown, I would have ordered a few more of these."
"poured a nice cloudy amber,with a decent head that left lacing down the glass, very nice looking, nice complex fragrance, pine, rasberry notes,a bit sweet smelling, taste:strong lemon presence, malty, with slight hops,,alcohol taste at the end, mouthfeel is mildly carbonated, tastes and feels a bit like cold tea,light yet a touch creamy, very refreshing! drinkability: I would say high! this is good stuff, and seems quite easy to drink! recommended!!!"
"Well balanced IPA, not the over the top intensity that I prefer in an IPA, but solid overall. Check this out and support this small Massachusetts microbrewery."
"Overall a nice offering from this company.. One of the better beers they produce IMHO..."
"It's not a hop monster Imperial IPA, but it's a good quality IPA on the low side of American or high side of British."
"Drinkability: A unique IPA, good for a change of pace. I like it, but I don't think I'll be drinking it regularly."
"Fighting a hard fight in a nation of ballsy IPAs Berkshire has a nice English-styled one going on here. Not always one Id go back to, but at $2.75 a bomber and drinkable as ever this would be a great summertime choice for picnics and sociable get togethers. Make sure you check the freshness date on the side of the bottles though, as this beer is low in hops and alcohol and won't sit well for long."
"Zum wohl!"
"This will be my brew for the summer, simply fantastic!"
"pours a clear honey gold, with plenty of carbonation, forming a tiny bubbled fuffy white head that sticks and trails down the side of the glass. aroma is wonderful, load of floral and bitter hops, slightly citric. The body is on the medium/light side with a flavorful malt profile well balanced by plenty of hop oils, and bittering. An easy drinking IPA, really well made, perfectly balanced and quite drinkable."
"Golden orange color with ample small bubbled carbonation. Smooth, citrusy hops which melds with the beer rather than overwhelms. Very smooth for an IPA, would definetly classify as an English style. Very balanced overall. Easily would be a regular session beer for me. Sent directly from mikeys01 cellar, thanks for the chance to sample a beer otherwise not available to me!"
"A nice floral hop aroma stands out from a light biscuity smell. The malt is a little doughy with some caramel notes. Lemon, lime and grapefruit bitterness are front and center. A mild metallic tang and slight grassiness bring up the rear. Balances out as it warms."
"Pours a hazy deap amber with a nice white head. Mmmmm... there's the hops! Hops are quite nice: bitter, yet sweet. The malts go unnoticed throught the hop flavor but are still there as the backbone with their fruity goodness. A nice mouthfeel for an IPA takes me back home to sip after sip of this lovely brew."
"Hazy honey color with a beige head. Head rises up big and foamy but settles right back down again. Aroma is bright and hoppy, lots of citrus and pine. Very fresh and clean smelling. Flavor is strong hops, very well-balanced, with hints of orange and sweet malt. Creamy mouthfeel with tingling sensation on the tongue. Lingering flavor of honey and hop bitter. This is great stuff."
"Nice golden orange with substantial head on initial pour. Well carbonated. Aroma was excellent...a light fruity (citrus) that invites you to drink. Not the usual bitter kick of an IPA, but interesting nonetheless. Very citrusy and well-rounded with a smoothness that was unexpected. The bitter quality of the usual IPA hit as an aftertaste that didn't overstay its welcome. Mouthfeel was nice...medium bodied and very drinkable."
"Definitely worth trying a few times, just to figure it out."
"The beer pours a golden color, that is somewhat hazy. The white head was minimal, and didn't stay long or provide any lacing down the glass. The aroma is lightly of hops (pine?,grapefruit?) and fruitiness (?). Hard call as to the specifics. Taste is a mild maly sweetness, with a bitter finish. Fair to middlin."
"Pours a medium-light amber, small white head that doesn't last too well. Aroma is light, fruity (pears, grapes), mildy hoppy (floral, pine). Flavor starts slightly fruity (mostly pears), middle is thin, ends mildly hoppy. Medium body, mild carbonation."
"This is a wonderfully tasty beer. Poured a cloudy dark orange with dense tan head. Aroma was just beautiful- juicy fruity peach, apricots and grapefuits with a sweet malt background. Tasting it was like biting into an over-ripe peach that drips down your chin onto your shirt. The flavor aspect of the hop is really accented here as I didn't find this beer to be overly bitter but mightily flavorful. Finishes sugary sweet but a little thin, but with enough body to hold up to all the fruity flavors. Very enjoyable."
"Pours with a white head that lasts forever and leaves a good lace. Color is a light cloudy amber. For an IPA this is not over powering with hops like many are. Starts sweet but the hops do kick in before the finish. Medium bodied, slightly bitter but not dry."
"This beer, while appropriately bitter, does not provide the crazy explosion of hops provided by the big IPA's so celebrated these days. And that's part of what I like about it. A great, balanced beer by Berkshire -- one of my favorite IPAs."
"Deep honey coloring; thick white head with outstanding retention. Sharp, penetrating hop aromas; apricot fruitiness with some pine notes. Low carbonation. Toasty and caramel malts at first, followed by a big hop flavor that takes you into a shortish finish. This English-style IPA is much more balanced than many of its American-style counterparts. Just a fabulous brew, and one which I'll pick up a good deal more of next time I'm in western MA."
"This is a kickin' IPA.  Strong hop flavor and good bitterness.  This beer was not hopped for bitterness alone.  Whatever flower used has a great aroma and flavor characterisitc.  Quite good all around."
"A damn fine IPA, and one of the best in MA. This IPA really appeals to me because it shows off both a big malt and big hop character, but the beer is so in balance and the flavours are so smoothed together."
"Notes: One of the better domestic English Style IPAs I have had in a long time, well balanced and poised as a session beer."
