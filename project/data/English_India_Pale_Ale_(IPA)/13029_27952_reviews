"Gold pour with thick tight head (draft pour into 12 oz tulip); grassy citrus notes; tight bubbles lace down glass; fresh cut grass and just a hint of lemon; lite mouthfeel; liquid goes down smooth; dry, grass hop finish; overall very lite and refreshing."

"Bottle. Golden, clear with nice thick, medium, white head. Good lacing. Average lasting. Starts with nice malty character, nice medium citrus zesty aroma, touch of tropical fruits. Light to medium bitter, orange peel, grapefruit, light resing flavours. Almost medium bodied, smooth, lively carbonation semi-dry. Finish is bittersweet. Very refreshing beer. Nice, well balanced, refreshing an very drinkable IPA. Solid."
"I had this on cask at churchkey. I realize this is an English IPA and it is meant to be this way, but I just don't enjoy these non-hoppy IPAs. Kind boring."

"Poured from 500 ml bottle into a Liefmans Goudenband glass (my preferred all purpose beer tasting glass). Tasted July 2014. Purchased at Whole Foods in Austin."

"This beer was a pleasant surprise. I am used to drinking super-hoppy and bitter beers. However, this beer had a nice bit of hops but it was very smooth and very easy to drink. On top of the hops, I also got subtle notes of citrus, pine, and grass. Would definitely want to drink again."

"Im not getting the hype on this one. Light in color. Smells funky like a farmhouse ale. Tastes about the same. Slightly bitter. Plenty of carbonation. If it didn't say IPA on it, I would think I was drinking a farmhouse ale. Maybe it's old.... Was new at a respected bottleshop tho."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very good beer to drink for a long time."
"Bucky snagged a 500 ml bottle of the brewery's Jaipur India Pale Ale (""Jaipur""), which was 5.9% alcohol by volume with a best before date of November 28, 2013 printed on the back. A little wary about this one...half-expecting a nuclear hop bomb. An overly aggressive pour produced about 2.5"" of fluffy, snow-white head that lasted for quite some time, leaving some beautiful, sticky lacing down the glass as it retreated. The beer itself was a cloudy, yellow/gold colour, taking on more of the golden hue when backlit. Jaipur's aroma was dominated by grapefruit, with undertones of pine and orange. Its flavour began with a slightly sweet, juicy mix of grapefruit, orange and pine, transitioning to a distinctly bitter finish which lingered as a long-lived aftertaste. Definitely bitter, but not so bitter as to overwhelm all else and ruin the experience. Thornbridge has the balance just right on this one. Jaipur had a fairly active but suitable level of carbonation, and I would describe the beer as light to medium bodied. Though I'm not a huge fan of IPAs generally, this is probably the nicest one that I have tried to date and I would certainly drink this beer again. At $4.95 per 500 ml bottle it is pricey, but quality (and British beers sold in Canada generally) usually are."

"This is a nice example of a strong Brit IPA, much weaker than we are used to here in the colonies. If you can find one, a nice change from our usual hop bombs, smooth and easy drinking."

"If you find this beer fresh, drink it. Drink all of it. The floral hops in here are out of this world. A nice biscuity malt backs it all up. Very light, very delicate, and very good. If this came in reasonably-priced six-packs here in the US, I'd drink it all the time. Easily the best IPA out of England I've had so far, and actually rather unique."
"O: Great drinkability. Excellent English IPA with an American influence"
"I'm slowly learning that good English IPA means balance. Damn right. This has it all. Been staring at this one literally for years and never pulled the trigger because it is always $10-$12 for a 1 pint 9 oz bottle. Sometimes you need to pay a little to get something good. This is worth the price. Loved it."

"I'll call this a ""delicate IPA"". Smoother, less effervescence, less hop punch. Really beautiful flavors though. Grapefruit, apricot/orange, herbaceous/floral. Refreshing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- While English IPAs are usually more malt driven, this is closer to an American version since the hops are definitely more apparent."

"Pours a hazy yellow-orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with lots of fresh citrus flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some great citrus forward aromas and tasty flavors that make it very easy to drink."

"Overall Impression: For a beer that is ranked this highly on Beeradvocate’s top beers in Britain, I honestly expected more. It is a little too light in body and malt character, and uses obviously American hops, to be considered an English IPA. When compared to the best Ameican IPAs, this would not have a prayer to make the top 50. That being said, it is quite refreshing, light on the palate, and thirst quenching."
"Well done and pleasant beer, great drinkability."
"O/D - A nice IPA. Lovely interpretation of the American style. Great hop profile, light, and really drinkable."
""
""
""
"Evokes a somewhat bigger Stone & Wood Pacific Ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The nice dry British hops character is full with much softer pale malt flavors underneath. The dry hop character takes on an almost astringent quality but there is enough depth in the hops to counter that."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good IPA but lacks a bit of the malt flavours to balance."
""
""
""
"This is a pretty simple beer. Juicy hops and that's about it. Fresh it's very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A very refreshing and innovative take on the American IPA style. Enjoyable."
""
"O: Good but surprised at how highly others are rating it. It is well balanced. Very versatile, as its pretty middle of the road in taste."
""
""
"This one is very good. Loved it."
""
"Nice, very much like an American style IPA which wasn't at all what I was expecting. This one is a beer I had heard a lot about prior to drinking it and my only regret is that I put off trying it for so long."
"Mouthfeel - Low carbonation in appearance but perfect level of carb in the mouth. Provides a good explosion of flavour on the tongue. Smooth, surprisingly easy drinking beer for the ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Solid beer. Can't help but feeling a bit of disappointment. Supposed to be one of the most legit EIPAs out there, and I get it on cask. Yet it fell short. A treat to try and tastier than I am willing to admit. Just expected more and shame on me for that. Still one of the better EIPAs I have had."
""
""
"All around an excellent IPA."
""
"Happy to try this at My Place in Newtown, CT, this English IPA shows a clear pale amber color with a fair white head and very little signs of lacing. The aroma brings solid pine citrus hop and biscuit malt hints. Not bad as English styled IPA's go. The flavor brings very much the same profile as the aroma, no surprises, decent enough and probably a bit more hop than many other British hop brews. I find it to be medium bodied with decent carbonation for a very solid, liquacious feel with a little tinglation. Very nice IPA, not highly memorable but plenty drinkable and worth a revisit anytime."
""
"In short, a well crafted IPA that remains smooth and non-harsh despite all the hops packed in (500 ml into tulip,BB 04-23-2013)."
""
"Pours a nice foam, that later lingers as thin crust. Incredible aroma, mango, passion fruit and some pineapple easily identifiable. Flavour follows the same fruity track, with bitterness of decent amount of hops and honey sweetness at a perfect level, as a supprot actor. Start crispy but than velvet as flavours blossom everywhere. This is how an IPA with high drinkability should be. Alcohol is a master of disguise here. Narcisism looking for perfection. Amazing."
"O- An interesting IPA, has very assertive, citric hop flavors for an English IPA, definitely give this a try."
""

"500 ml bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours cloudy golden orange color with a nice 1-2 finger dense white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Good soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big pineapple, orange, mango, lemon, herbal, floral, grass, grapefruit, bread, and earthy spiciness. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance; very pleasant. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, bread, herbal, floral, grass, mango, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, bread, herbal, floral, grass, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance of malt sweetness/bitterness; with zero astringent hop flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with almost no warming noticed after the finish. Very smooth and drinkable. Overall this is a highly excellent English IPA! Great flavor balance and hop complexity; and extremely smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."
"O: A perfect IPA for a warm summer day. If you like intense citrus tones in your IPA this is a mush try."
"Overall a very good beer, not very bold or spectacular (except for the phenominal smell) but certainly interesting enough to seek it out! A very nice beer that I would love to session."
"O: Very floral and fruity - a style I'm becoming all too familiar with, but very sessionable non the less."
"Still can't see the fascination of this beer: nothing wrong with it, but I'm underwhelmed compared to most of my mates."
""
"Overall , a surprise package, not a stylised EIPA by any means. Easy drinking for 6% tho. Down 0.5 for price"
"Still, this is a lovely little IPA from Thornbridge. It has stacks of aromatics, and a solid, drinkable basis. And that aroma, oh god, that aroma..."
"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium pure orange amber. Moderate, active head with lots of lacing and active carbonation. Nice looking. Hoppy light malt aroma. Interesting flavor progression. Starts as a medium bodied, creamy lager-like malty ale, then changes to a hoppy, spicy flavor, citrus and finishes hoppy like an IPA. Very well done. Will try again."
"Given all of the labeling as well as being able to see suspended particulate, I went with about as gentle a pour as I have ever employed. This resulted in just a modicum of bone-white head that quickly reduced to wisps. Color was a hazy sunshine yellow. Nose had a grassy, minty quality. Interesting. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was unexpectedly of fresh-squeezed grapefruit. I was in a swoon! Good on you, Clarke! I wonder how much different it is from a cask ... Finish was really hoppy and if you had told me that this was an English IPA in a blind taste test, I would not have believed it. This was a really fantastic beer. More please."
"Inoffensive entry with biscuity malt, followed up with a spot of marmalade. How English. Hop flavors sneakily layer on top of it until it occurs to you that this is actually a pretty ballsy beer. Zesty - lemon, candied orange, maybe a bit of mint. Smooth as hell in the mouth - subdued carbonation and admirably more-ish. I could drink this all day, any time of the year. I've always maintained that a well-made English IPA is a thing of true beauty and this is both of those things."
"Overall, Thornbridge Jaipur is an exemplary English IPA with more intensity than traditional examples of the style. This flavourful, hoppy thirst-quencher is one of the best UK beers that I've sampled. A very impressive brew."
"Very easy-drinking and approachable."
"Final Grade: 4.25, a high A minus (nearly an A). Jaipur IPA seems to have inherited a lot of traits from American-style IPAs, but the fact that the hop flavours are not palate-scrubbingly powerful half-heartedly corroborates the idea that this is an English IPA. But this is all semantics - it's still a ridiculously tasty brew, and there is little doubt in my mind it would be a regular purchase for me if it became a general listing (instead of just seasonally-available). It is well worth the price, and I would eagerly recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious, potentially sessionable IPA."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the India Pale Ale Style."
""
""
""
"Although the beer tilts decidedly toward hop flavor and bitterness, it's not without the firm support of malt flavor and feel. This beer will surely delight the palate of any fan of English beer."
"Hazy yellowish-orange, surprisingly almost no head was formed (no hiss or pop either when I popped the cap...). Some clear bubbles form a head, but that's about it. Faint floral and lemon quality to the nose, touch of citrus zest. More citrus, lemon, and grainy flavours on the palate, definitely some English character to the malt here. Medium body, but a surprisingly very low carbonation. A good beer, but based on this experience (or bottle), I'm not sure if I'd grab another right away."
""
""
"O: A melting pot of old and new. This ""real ale"" is kinda rustic, yet agressive and hop forward. One of the better English IPA's I've come across. Well done."
""
""
""
""
"Cloudy pale yellow body, soapy white head. Good retention, very little lace. Aroma is floral and lemony with softer evergreen undertones. Lemon and biscuits up front followed by citrus pith and a firm bitterness that lasts well into the aftertaste. Light-bodied with low carbonation. I love light-bodied beers with solid flavours in the summertime, and this strikes me as a very well made golden ale. Pretty moreish stuff."
""
""
"Overall: A really complex bit of IPA. Lots of subtly which shows off the strong distinction between big brash American IPAs and their often overlooked British/English cousins. The sweet flower aroma and the wide array of citrus flavours make this a good example of the skill and subtlety of English brewing."
"English beers are usually the most familiar, but their brewers are still evidently capable of surprises. Jaipur is as sunny as any beach in India (or San Diego, for that matter). It manages to embrace the modern (read: American) style and level of hopping, but still drinks like a hearty, rustic pint of real (read: traditional British) ale. A really impressive offering."
"This is a great English IPA. Very hop forward and an excellent showcase of English hops. Seek this out."
""
"Bottle: Poured a hazy deep blonde color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some pretty good lacing. Aroma of floral hops with light dry notes with clean cereal notes is quite enjoyable and seems to be split between an American and British IPA. Taste is also a great mix between some floral and hoppy notes with a dry finish with some clean cereal notes with some light residual sugar coming through. Body is about average with good carbonation. Love the mix between citrus hops and floral dry British hops notes."
""
"D - Good drinkability. Hops are strong, but have an understated quality that lets the malt come through."
"Decent worth and worth a try, but a little too bitter to be a fave."
""
"A refreshing and drinkable British IPA. Not quite enough malt for my palette."
"OVERALL: Solid English IPA. Lots of flavor and complexity for the style, and plenty easy to drink as well. Would gladly drink this regularly down at the local pub. Cheers!"
""
""
"O - A tasty english IPA, solid hop presence, unique flavours that are sure to please most critics. Some musty notes keeps it out of the realm of an American IPA. Well worth grabbing a bottle, and I will likely grab a few more before they disappear at my local LCBO."
"Picked this up at the LCBO. Had a best before of july sometime this year. Pours a bright golden yellow with a good amount of head. Tastes of grassy and lemon like notes. Has a crisp taste to it, but the flavour fades kinda quickly to an average finish. Don't think I will go out of my way for this one again."
"O- Quite good for an English IPA. The English styles or IPA and Barleywine aren't really my cup of tea but this really stands out."
"All in all, a lot more flavour than I'd expect from anything classified as an English IPA and a truly pleasant surprise!"
"M - Medium body with moderate carbonation."
"Overall - Not what I was expecting, but still a very good beer. It reminded me a pilsner at times. There are still shades of a EIPA and an American IPA as well, just the amount of noble hop flavour throws it off a bit. A little pricey for me to stock up on this one, but well worth a try."
"O - an excellent IPA with some Amercian IPA characteristics - definitely buy it when you see it"
""
"I was really impressed with this. One of the better IPA's i've ever had."
"D: Very good English IPA that is very well balanced and easy-to-drink. Quite impressed."
""
""
"Overall, very nice. Perhaps not the most traditional English IPA but a very nice beer."
"An enjoyable brew, but those looking for a hoppy blast will do well to limit their search to this side of the pond."
"Overall, I wasn't blown away by this but its certainly sessionable and well crafted. I would love to try the cask version or a fresher bottle."
"superb!"
""
""
"The palate has a very nice herbal hop bitterness with a deliciously snappy mineral character, making this very refreshing. Cracker-like malts make this drying and refreshing. The mid-palate has hop resins and mineral incorporated in a way that each character enhances the other. Drying with a bitter finish with nice resins, the hop character is decidedly American with a little bit of an English leafy and earthy character. Light in body with crisp carbonation, this beer is excellent. Highly recommended. I'll have to revisit it when I find fresher samples."
"O: A solid IPA for those who want drinkability over flavor. A bit lackluster for my taste; I enjoyed it but wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
"O: Really enjoy the English IPA as a different type of IPA than the ones I have been drinking a lot of recently (West Coast and DIPAs), the lower ABV and slightly lighter hop bitterness is a nice change. Very easy to drink and the lower ABV definitely makes this one sessionable."
"A good hoppy English IPA, well done!"
""

"Picked this up at my favorite beer store in Belgium, Dranken Geers. Nearly clear yellow pour with just a touch of orange. Nice two finger head with good retention and lacing. Wonderful citrusy, floral nose with hints of lemon, orange zest, tangerines, and grapefruit with just a touch of ginger. The taste mirrors the smell and is dominated by the huge citrus profile. Mouthwatering, juicy notes of tangerine, lemon, and grapefruit with a hint of mango and pine. A solid sweet caramel malt base balances out the resiny fresh hop bitterness perfectly. The mouthfeel is awesome as well with just the right amount of carbonation, a touch of oily hoppiness, and a really refreshing and crisp dry bitter finish. Once again Thornbridge has managed to come up with a spot on style interpretation that is totally drinkable. They have quickly become my favorite brewery. They just don't make a bad beer. One of the best IPA's I've ever tasted!"
""
"Overall, great beer. Got to be my favorite British-style IPA. Try one!"
""

"On tap at Local Option in Chicago. Served in a tulip. Slightly hazy straw color. Thick white lacing clings to the glass. Muted hops and malts with a distinct floral aroma. Wheat flavor with a floral hops finely integrated. Not overpowering. Medium body with a light carbonation. A nice easy drinker. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall/Drinkability: I really enjoyed the smell and taste on this one, but for the price I cannot see myself getting it again. Still, with all that hop aroma and flavor, I suspect this beer would be quite something fresh out of a cask so if that option was available, I would pay for a glass again. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that as it warms up to something more of an English temperature, it gets more and more bitter. Almost, but not quite, mouth-puckering bitter. Overall, an interesting take on the English IPA and I'm glad I tried it. As for drinkability - one glass (albeit a large one) is enough."

"O- A nicely balanced and easily drinkable ipa. Felt a bit heavy on my stomach for a couple for hours, but maybe it was just me"
""
""
"Love it."
"O: This is a wonderfully flavorful, gorgeously balanced IPA that straddles the line between English and American variants of the style. Very much worth trying."
"Damn good taste not hta bitterness you get sometimes. Thanks for this treat Craig!!"
"2013 update: I found a bottle in a local beer store in Louisville...and it was not good. I don't know if it was ruined by light or time, but the beer (sadly) tasted nothing like what I had in the UK. And it was quite pricey to boot (something like $7 for the bottle I purchased)."
"Overall Drinkability - Enjoyable. Decently complex. If I was in the mood for something bitter, or was trying to pair this with a meal, I might enjoy it substantially more because it has good balance and presentation of characters. Unfortunately, it's not so great at being a stand-alone beer on this ocassion. Still worth checking out. No off characters."
"Very nice IPA in the British, rather than US style. Nicely balanced with solid hop profile never quite taking over. Would recommend it."
"The main trouble with English beers coming over to BC is even when they just arrive in stores thye often don't taste fresh which is a problem for a beer which relies on floral hops notes and a subtle citrus note. I liked the beer but could detect age in the flavour and a drop in the level of the hops used. It ended tasting a lot like the Brockton IPA from Granville Island when I know fresh it probably more sublime. Not worth the $7 a bottle when I can get fresh Brockton in cans for $12 a six."
"85"
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. I got a bottle of this at The Beer Store in Southampton, PA. Pours a hazy straw color without so much as a hint of a head. Perhaps would have been otherwise with a straight down the center pour. Very interesting nose. I can't quite place it. Mild pine and citrus. Malt. That's it. MALT. The taste confirms it. The taste definitely reveals some hops, but it's still a very malt forward beer, which is different for an IPA. The mouth feel is smooth, with a bit of a sharp bitter bite at the tale end near the tip and the sides of your tongue. Overall this is very good beer. Glad I got a chance to try it. Wouldn't hesitate to order a pint of this going forward."
"Cheers!."
"O- tasty and crisp a nice hop profile with malts..like a PA to me"
"Wow - an EIPA that isn't afraid of the almighty hop, and what it can do for you, to crib from a famous American trope. A lovely, dry, and fruity India Pale Ale, by anyone's scale."
"A fine beer, particularly on cask. I had this on handpump at the Brick Store Pub. A very nice pour with excellent clarity and a nice fluffy white head about 3/4 of an inch tall. Lovely leafy hop aromas leap from the glass. Nice herbal notes with a hint of mint peeking through. The taste is also quite nice with more leafy herbalness, an earthy bitterness, and a lovely creaminess. Soft, bitter, and creamy in the mouth, this is a beer I tend to get a glass of every time I see it on. Definitely moreish."
"english IPA in the sense that its made with an american temperament and english hops. must say that it quite a wonderful beer... but ever beer i've had from them has been. great hop richness and an abv of a APA. pour is yellow golden almost clear with a nice sticky head. nose grassiness. the beer itself had a wonderful feel of intense grassy lemon zest. very dry and quick finish. like bit of sweetness in there. no mineral nots. a bit chalk dry but about as much as a belgian saison."
"Hazy pale golden colour, one finger frothy white head, good lacing left behind. Smell is of lots of hop, pine, malty and grainy, cereal like qualities. Taste is floral and grainy, big hop kick, pine and muted citrus, light sweetness, drying bitter finish, citrus in aftertaste. Light-med carbonation, very oily and resinous, med-full body and very nice overall. Very nice english IPA, well made and enjoyable, quite drinkable."
"Very good IPA - enjoy it!"
"O - the focus here is hops as it should be, could use a little more malt flavour support, but overall an extremely drinkable beverage"
"overall a very good beer, but not something I'd frequently go out of my way for."
"Good, natural carbonation. Even at 5.9%, a decently sessionable IPA."
"Very dry IPA which is an awesome way to go, highlighting the hops even more. Great bitterness and resin-y flavor with moderate-medium body with fair carbonation. This beer is excellent and I applaud it. Bravo, Thornbridge."
"* gold medal, 2010"
"O - very drinkable, not what you necessarily expect from an IPA, little high for a session beer at 5.9% but this is very good. $10 for a 1 pint 0.9 fl oz bottle at Brasserie V."
"D - Not the most overly complex IPA, but nicely balanced and an impressive mouthfeel."
"Overall: Surprisingly delicious - interesting enough, but not overpowering, potentially making it a good session beer. Having recently been to Jaipur, India, it is apt - one of the cleaner Indian cities, this beer is not massive like other IPAs, but interesting enough to raise eyebrows. Can only assume the skunky taste other reviewers found was due to a bad batch."
"A very good IPA, I've been a little weary of English IPAs of late having developed a taste for the massive American IPAs but this is a great example of what England can do, it's got a good alcohol strength, a pleasant taste with a good hop profile. This is definitely a great savouring beer but would also work well in session quantity."
"Quite the easy-drinker for the style, it holds its own and delivers a hop kick that is more than simply one-dimensional. Malt presence is pretty absent, this one is all about the hops."
"Cheers!"
"My only regret is that not more people got to try it fresh from the cask. I suppose, after all, that us Americans prefer a bit more oomph in our ales. However, I can hardly imagine even the most bombastic of palettes turning down a second pint. “Moreish” indeed."
"I took a shot in the dark buying this one but I'm so stoked I did, worth looking for if you can appreciate something other then a big alpha acid enamel stripper the Brits don't get(or need to with gems like this)."
"This beer pours out as a clear golden color with a thin fizzy white head on it. The lacing it very light but does show around the glass. The smell of the beer is lightly citrusy with a good amount of malts in there too. The taste of the beer is a little on the weak side, I do like the flavor flavors it does have though. Mouthfeel was pretty thin actually, the carbonation was limited but had enough to kelp it interesting. Overall it's a pretty nice regular ipa."
"Well-balanced beer, very drinkable. This version on tap just wasn't a pretty beer. Maybe I'll try a bottle next time."
"I like a good, dry beer, so this is right up my alley. I would have this again, but I can see how it would not be for everyone."
"Overall, I love English IPAs, but they're difficult to find here in the States. Glad to see Jaipur on the shelf. Fantastic beer."
"Poured clear, light gold, with a bit of a white head. Floral aroma, with a floral taste, accompanied by very light citrus hopiness, and a bit of breadiness. Extremely mild and smooth for an IPA. Light, crisp mouthfeel, and easy drinkability. Very easy-going for an IPA, and surprisingly light on the hops. I prefer my IPAs hoppy, but this was a pleasant surprise."
"M&D: smoothly carbonated and medium-plus bodied IPA for the 5.9% alc. content, this bottle-conditioned version (well, at least it’s unfiltered and unpasteurised according to the back label) is no less good than the draught/cask version as far as I’m concerned. If one is after a well-balanced English IPA, I think this is a perfect choice due to its high level of drinkability and marvellous balance pleasantly felt on both the nose and the palate."
"I love real ales on cask but am not the biggest fan of English IPAs. This beer was a perfect example of both. I highly recommend that you seek this beer out on cask if you have the chance."
"Clean, crisp, refreshing. Great balance of earthy, flinty, biscuty malts to the earthy, floral, citrusy hops. Still some berry like notes on the finish. Nice and dry not overly bitter from hops but a food that could pair well with many of dishes."
"Flavour - Flavour presents a little malt sweetness with loads of earthy, spicy hops and an intense but not overbearing bitterness."
"The mouthfeel is acceptable. The beer is a bit chewy and grainy in my mouth, but the medium body is bolstered by a decent carbonation. The overall score is between average and good. If you love English IPA's, this is your beer. Not my thing, but a good example of the style overall."
"HV"
"Great out of the cask, and solid. Nothing fancy, challenging or complex, just flat out good and very drinkable."
"Serving type: bottle"
"O - Very pleasant overall, either on its own or as a session drink."
"No off flavours here. Along with a light body and lower ABV, this stuff ends up going down pretty easily. This seems to be one of the more highly-rated English IPAs out there; I guess when it comes down to it, English-style IPA is just not my cup of tea."
"-Cheers"
"I'm proud to have been a Jaipur drinker since 2005. Long may that continue."
"I'd place this beer below Meantime's for my favourite in the category, but it only loses out by a whisker."
"Light and crisp, yet a nice round biscuity malt body. Crisp grassy hops with a dry bitter hop bite, loads of hops. Hint of metallic bite, honey, wet grass. Hefty hops and body for an English IPA, almost what a English DIPA would taste like? Really drinkable, this would be superb on cask."
"Only 5.9% needed to make what must be one of the finest beers in all the world. Take note craft brewers everywhere who can only get good flavour by making their beers as strong as wine."
"I have great respect for this brewery, and this brew again confirms it. Yes, English understated and smooth drinking craftmanship, yet delivers an IBU bitterness that wakes up the taste buds. Enjoyable drinkability, though more of a sipper to save the buds from being shredded. Like an imperial English IPA.Bottle from Premiere Gourmet."
"A second tasting of the beer was even better in terms of the smell--no skunk! The malt was much more present in this tasting--soft and balanced."
"I'm no foodie but you cannot go wrong with Jaipur. Check it out."
"M- Very low carbination, very easy to drink. Would nearly go as far to call it a session beer if it wasnt for its ABV"
"D - This is a nice, British IPA. The musty hop character works nicely with the dry, toasty malt. There is nothing complex going on here, but the beer is sessionable despite its alcoholic strength."
"D - This has good drinkability somewhat expensive but worth a try."
"A very interesting and delicious IPA from the folks at Thornbridge and definitely worthy of a try."
"A good beer; a citrus dominated India Pale Ale, but I would call it an ESB if I didn't know better."
"Very well balanced, but packed with flavors - impressively so considering its modest ABV. Highly recommend."
"The aroma is sweet and hoppy with citrus, grass, carrots, and caramel malt. The appearance is hazy amber with a huge head for an IPA. The taste is like the aroma but a touch of vegetables and astringent chemicals. Not a good way to finish but thankfully the bad stuff was the weakest part. The palate is thick for an IPA. The beer is drinkable overall but not a great beer."
"Warm with low carbonation. Medium body with a lightly syrupy texture with a light bitter finish."
"Overall I enjoyed this nice English IPA from a cask, even if it wasn't a ""proper"" cask. A solid and well done beer that's worth a shot."
"D: Very drinkable."
"D - this is a really good English IPA. It is nice to take a break from the American hop bombs with this lighter, very crisp IPA that is full of lemony and citrus hop goodness."
"Poured a goldish orange with minimal head on top of a light blend of herbal tea-like hops and some caramel malt. Very light and pleasant, little bland, but a good citric herbal hop like presence that is subdued and a decent sweet malt base that complements the dominant hops. Finishes crisp thanks to carbonation and minor hop bitterness and the ABV is well-hidden for such a light tasting beer that is made to enjoy on a warm summer day."
"Bottle-Conditioned 50cl bottle from The Beer Emporium, Sandbach. Poured into an oversize Moors glass. Pours a hazy orange colour good white head stayed on the glass the whole drink. Intense hop aroma dominates with resinous pine. I really like this beer, the hop sensation hits straight away, the citrus flavours of orange,grapefruit being prominent. Mouthfeel is comfortable without a lot of carbonation. This is a beer for the hopheads, very drinkable. I found the bottle-conditioned version more to my liking than the filtered version, having more indepth flavour and a more satisfying body feel. I'm sure that this IPA has a more USA feel than most English Indias."
"D: The beer is very drinkable and rather refreshing. The low alcohol content makes this quite sessionable."
"D: A well done, drinkable beer."
"F: It finishes somewhat bitter with almost a touch of astringency. The grassy floral hop character really builds to a nice finish. Touch of malts. It is mostly dry too. The freshness of this really shows and makes the beer much more tasty."
"D- Excellent flavoursome IPA with excellent balance and hop refreshment."
"a very drinkable, proper strength (thank God!) british IPA"
"Perfectly drinkable. Especially on a 24 degree (celsius) London Summer Sunday."
"As I drank more,a sweetish honey malt flavor came thru more and more."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Soft natural carbonation."
"Pours a nice cloudy yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some hops, slight yeast note, some citrus. The taste is pretty nice, malty, sweet, nice little hop bite with some bitterness, slight citrus note. Medium body. Drinkable, a very nice brew."
"Very good drinkability, a good EIPA from the source so to speak, with just a bit of American influence IMO. Would to get a hold of this on cask or even just a 7 day old bottle..."
"An excellent example of the style even though it *is* hop forward. I'm so glad I tried it."
"The mouthfeel is surprisingly refreshing for the style with minimal unpleasant coating and aftertaste."
"Slightly hazed golden brass with a bubbly off-white head that reminds me of a colorblindness test. Lots of hay, orange, lemon, and arugula right out of the gate, plus a faint waft of floral honeysuckle. Malts stay well-hidden behind the veil of hops, but you know they're back there. The taste is deliciously, inappropriately hoppy; bitter orange and marjoram and a bit of leafiness are well-countered by malts with a mild but distinctively fruity sweetness. Pineapple comes to mind. The finish is lingeringly bitter and lip-smackingly, though overall the mouthfeel is pleasantly full and slick. This one is difficult to put down - I wish more UK brewers would use hops in such a bold and skillful way."
"Drinkability is fantastic - never wears on the palate."
"Overall - An excellent IPA - definitely the best British example i've tried... recommended..."
"This is a terrific IPA, light in color, full of flavor, aromatic, and satisfying. The beer is a completely transparent golden color with a nice white head - beautiful lace and nice density with relatively good staying-power. The aroma is great. For an English IPA, it has a lot of fresh hop aroma (dry hopped...). It's very floral, and there's even a little citrus, although the smell is a sweet, not-overpowering citrus. Great taste as well...lots of pale malt, slightly bread and biscuit, with an undercurrent of fruit (apricot). Hops are present as well, but are balancing on the tongue, not nearly bitter. Moderate mouthfeel...the brew has some heft, but is light enough to not be filling...makes you want another. This is a very appealing and rewarding English IPA."
"Super drinkable, and a fine session beer!"
"I would really like to try this out of a firkin. It seems that others thought much more of it out of that container."
"This beer was a yellowish blond with a very farmhouse appearance. A nice white head formed on top. Owen says this cask used some american hops (cascade?) and you could smell it in the citrusy hop aroma. The taste was rather impressive for a cask as it held its carbonation and hop presence quite well. Although not my favorite beer, I was very impressed by this cask offering. Unlike most British IPAs, this had a crisp, citrusy hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was creamy with little weight."
"This was the last beer we tasted so my perceptions may have been a bit off by that point... This beer had a very nice hop aroma. It was a nice dry ipa and very hoppy. I could sit down and drink several of these without problem. Very enjoyable."
"Cask-conditioned and served via handpump at Pizzeria Paradiso in Washington DC, the Jaipur IPA was delivered to me with a short head of white foam resting atop a mainly clear golden body. The head held well, and it left short walls and sheets of lace as it went. The aroma offered notes of tart apple, marmalade, and grassy and spicy hops; all of which carried over into the flavor along with some added biscuit-like, mildly sweet malt. It was hoppy, but not overdone, and well-rounded. A solid, but again, not overly-done, bitterness anchored it, leading to a long, grassy and spicy bitter finish. The moderate carbonation and smoothness helped with that, and it was remarkably easy to drink."
"Light, bright golden/ straw color with a compact-yet soft white head that stays small but leaves good lace. Nose of earthy herbal tea with lemon. Flavors of earthy hop bitterness (UK style) but in enough quantity for an open-minded US hophead to appreciate. Light, dry cracker malt taste in the middle with a light to medium silky mouthfeel and mild bitter finish. I drank it with some mild flavored fish - Tilapia with just a little salt, pepper, rosemary, in a small amount of blended olive oil and butter. Good stuff."
"Drinkability: Almost the definition of a session beer."
"A fantastic way to end the festival!"
"The appearance is a nice golden straw color, with a frothy, bubbly head (ala cask conditioning, thank you very much), and good carbonation. The aroma here is somewhat subdued, perhaps by the cask (although I don't think so), but still maintains a pleasant sense. Very piney and a bit grassy, but strong too, and almost a slight marijuana smell. Seriously, I'm not making this up. The taste is fabulous. Rubbery (in a good way) with lots of spicy hops. This beer very much reminds me of the Victory Hop Wallop. I mean, they could be identical twins practically. Mouthfeel is full and chewy; very solid. I'd take this cask version of the Jaipur IPA over mosts standard IPAs anyday of the week, but I also really really like spicy, hoppy IPAs. A worthy component for any hophead's repertoire, for sure. Drink up."
"This is one of the best UK cask beers I have ever sampled anywhere. I will definitely look for it on my next trip to Britain and will certainly order it any time I find it available in the US. I rank it on par with Hop Back Summer Lightning - an excellent pint!"
"Out of the cask, this beer pours a very attractive cloudy yellow/gold color, with excellent head retention and decent lacing. There is not a lot in the nose, maybe some wet earth and leafiness. On the palate this beer is most impressive. Nice citrus from the hops, with just the right amount of bitterness interspersed with the sweet malt. This beer is very light and refreshing to drink (in comparison to most of the IPA's and DIPA's you find in the states), with excellent mouthfeel and crispness. I guess in England this would be considered too high in alcohol for a true session beer, but I could easily see myself tossing back 3 or 4 of these on a warm afternoon. Very impressive. Like nothing you are likely to find in the U.S."
