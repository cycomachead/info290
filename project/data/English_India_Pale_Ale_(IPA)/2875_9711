The nose picks up a nice citrus nutty pine. The flavor follows suit but adds a peppery grass that’s a little on the harsh side but not bad. Carbonation is sharpish, very fine and body is between medium and light. Drinks easily and is pretty refreshing with a tingly feel that maintains fair constitution. The citrus bread flavor holds on through the finish. Definitely worth a try as a satisfying hop refreshment.","Durge","Beers"

1.95,-45.1,3.5,1,2.5,3,1,"I know that some may say it's not fair to judge this beer because it was probably pretty good leaving the brewery. Carolina packaged this beer in their own labeled clear growler that is very spoil-prone then they deserve this kind of review. Beer people know that clear glass is terrible for protecting beer and that's why even BMC prefers to package in cans or at least brown bottles, but a naive consumer might think that a growler-packaged beer is fancier and higher-end. They would've spent good money expecting a good beer to only be disappointed by something that should be poured out. I think this is awful and Carolina should be ashamed of putting such a poor product on shelves. The retailer, Total Wine & More in Raleigh, shares some of this burden of shame too, but I had other growler beers from that store and they were fine. This was definitely Carolina's fault and I hope that they would address it. I will contact the company shortly","Soonami","Aug 21, 2010"

Spicy, piney hops with a citrus finish. Not heavy but powerful enough and more split than balanced. Mouthfeel is overly thick at first but thins out nicely. This is an easy drinking IPA that won't please true hopheads but will easily quench a thirst on a Saturday afternoon.","daliandragon","Jul 26, 2008"
3.46,-2.5,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Flavor picked up my impression a bit, with some good notes of zesty, citrus hops, biscuity malt, and a touch of tropical fruit.

The taste was quite interesting. It was a little on the sweet side for an IPA, the malts overpowered the hops, but the hops did show through nicely in the finish. To its credit, the beer did get hoppier as it was finished. The beer was light and crisp and somewhat easy to drink, if it only overall tasted more like an IPA.","atsprings","Aug 20, 2005"
3.39,-4.5,2,3,4,2.5,3.5,"Had this at the brewery location, poured by the staff. Not very impressive looking. Sort of flat looking. Leaves a minimal amount of "lace" on the glass. Is a brown color. Actually looks almost identical to the Brown ale they had, but with worse carbonation. Smells very earthy grassy. It tastes pretty good though. Has a nice balance between the hops (not sure of the mix, a little like cascade, but something else in there too) and the malt. The mouthfeel is actually much more syrupy than I had expected. Overall though it is a tasty beer and I can enjoy drinking it.","cracgor","May 13, 2005"
3.38,-4.8,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not a particularly complex IPA, but very solid and enjoyable. Poured an orangey-varnish color without any head. Nose was just slightly of hops. Flavor had a nice malt base going on. Hops provided some citrus rind and Christmas pine, but there is just a slightly unappealing varnish flavor. Mouthfeel had a nice medium feeling body to the beer.

3.78,6.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Pours a coppery golden color with a thick, foamy white head. Smell is light citric hops with a sweet caramel malt background. Taste is light floral and citrus with an oily mouthfeel. It ends with a sweet but mild caramel malt, and leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste that is gone quickly. A highly drinkable IPA, that is not quite as complex or hoppy as it's main North Carolina IPA competitors (Hoppy Hour and Big Boss), but a good attempy none the less, and I definately see the English IPA style as being apropriate.","silver0rlead","Sep 26, 2004"

4.07,14.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"On-tap at the Carolina Brewery. Light copper in color. Thick and long-lasting off-white lace coats the glass. Prominent notes of grapefruit in the nose. Very nice. Flavor is HOPPY! In your face, teeth-rattling bitterness is all that comprises the flavor. Nothing so much as shows itself to try to tame the hop landslide assaulting your palate. Almost to the point of being unbalanced. Finishes very bitter, with a splash of grapefruit juice squatting on the palate to remind you what this is made of. Biting mouthfeel but still drinkable. Not for the faint of heart.","OldFrothingSlosh","Jul 17, 2003"
3.85,8.5,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Crisp and hoppy in the nose, this beer is bright and bitter, with a nice clean finish and slight floral and fruit notes in between. Solid all around, but nothing to really sing about. Still, I liked it and I'll have it again.","RockyTopHeel","Beers"
3.81,7.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Very hoppy but still balanced more then some IPAs. I wouldnt recommend this to someone who isnt a hop head though.","fattychubs","0"
