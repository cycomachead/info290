3,7.1,3,3,3,3,3,"This was just one month old but the hops were not suitably strong enough to warrant calling this an IPA. I get a mixture of lemon and a light herbal note that compliments a sweet caramel body. Some rose petal and a ribbon of floral perfume coasts through. This is weak and cheap, but at $1 a bottle that's to be expected. I found this off style but with enough flavor to warrant a try.","KYGunner","Feb 28, 2015"

2.92,4.3,3.25,3,2.75,3,3,"The FDA should have a rule that a label cannot say IPA unless hops have actually touched liquid. Glad I bought one bottle instead of a whole 6-pack at Trader Joes. Possibly the recipe changed? ABV is 5.7% and color is closer to brown than to ""bronze"" or ""copper"" in previous reviews. No trace of Federal Jack on the label, and it says brewed in Portland ME not Kennebunkport. Definitely not worth $6 a six-pack when Mission Street IPA is the same price.","CAcreeks","Jan 05, 2015"

Folks go into a lot of detail about things that I don't make out – like caramel and malty taste factors, and grassy hop smell. I can tell that there are hops in this brew and that it has a crisp refreshing taste; and someone said that the finish is dry – I agree. The head is light, and lacing is minimal, but when all is said and done there's still a wee bit left. Torpedo blows this brew out of the water, but it's a good beer, and as of this review will be my standard of comparison for a good average brew (3 points across the board). I'm reporting on a 12 oz. bottle from Trader Jose's with a freshness date of June 2015.","Redog","Nov 26, 2014"

I flew in from CA and was treated by one of these beers which was purchased at Trader Joe's (I am always hesitant to buy or drink beer from a discount beer place. Especially a place that doesn't store beer the correct way.). The beer was nothing outstanding but I did not detect any crazy off flavors or anything unpleasant. The one thing I didn't like is that this beer comes off more like a Pale Ale than an IPA. Low hop aroma and flavor, not a very bitter beer and not the most ABV ( this beer doesn't even top 5.7). The one thing I liked about this beer is the easy drinking qualities this beer had. I had several and was not sluring my words and the beer tasted just fine. If someone passed me this beer in a glass and told me nothing about it, I would not even have a single complaint.","i4ourgot","Jul 26, 2014"

Aroma dominated by caramel malt with faint hops; sweet and a hint of diacetyl. Flavor starts malty, with light sweet fruit and caramel malt, but changes to a dryer, grassy malt finish with somewhat astringent hop finish. Medium bodied. Odd that this was labeled as an IPA, there is little distinct hop presence except for bittering hops in the finish. The color, maltiness and low key neutral hops seem to put this solidly in the amber ale category. An adequate amber ale with a somewhat sweet, but decently malty start, but unbalanced with a mediocre finish. Slight point reduction for not being to style.","LiquidAmber","Aug 29, 2012"

A little too much in the gum flavor. The taste is somewhat spicy up front with a band-aid taste next and some fading hops in the back of the throat. A lot of malt in the mix too. It has a medicine-like aftertaste with a slight bitterness. Sort of a mess. Overall I didn't hate the sixer for the price.

It pours a mostly clear orange flesh-amber topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises orange zest, wheat, coriander, light black pepper, light cilantro, light lemon zest, and light caramel. We're definitely looking at some spicy citrus hops here, folks, so no misconceptions regarding pine should enter into things. The taste revels in the juxtaposition between the sweet caramel and light buttery biscuit and the peppery, herbal, bitter hops that nestle thereamongst. The malt, though, drops out kinda quickly, leaving a sensation akin to licking bay leaves (or something along those lines. There's definitely chlorophyll involved.) So a promising start shoots off a cliff a bit, but, luckily, not too fast to really torpedo things entirely. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish.

Taste is much like the smell, fruit and caramel with a very mild hop bite. Medium mouthfeel with crisp carbonation.

3.03,8.2,3.5,3,3,3,3,"I tried this the other night at buddy's birthday party and found it palatable and party-worthy but not spectacular. Had I drank it while sitting at my desk with my critical faculties fully attuned to the beer then I might share some of the hyper-critical opinions of my fellow Beer Advocates, but luckily (for myself) I was able to be busy enough to enjoy this beer. It poured a golden orange with a small head head and smelled of sweet malts and citrusy hops. The taste was not as aggessively hopped as I would have expected from an IPA, but it made for some easy-drinking without feeling the need to pair it with party snacks. There are definitely more exciting IPAs out there but this one can be enjoyed by just about any macro-brew drinker willing to give a microbrew a chance.","droomyster","Jan 10, 2009"

Not really an IPA, too much malt and too little hops. Tastes mostly of a sweet malt with a hop background. More sweet than bitter, but smooth with little carbonation. Overall, it's easy to drink but definitely not an IPA.","Tone","Nov 25, 2008"
3.95,41.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This poured a slightly hazy copper with a bit of tan head. It smelled like orange and grapefruit hops, caramel malt, and a bit of brown sugar. It tasted like sweet caramel and honey malt, and sweet orange and bitter grapefruit hops. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was much tastier than I expected, although not in a traditional IPA sense. It had a very nice, sweet flavor and pretty good body, and it was clean and easy to drink. This was surprisingly enjoyable, and definitely makes me want to check out other beers from Federal Jack's.","Pencible","Nov 03, 2008"
2.02,-27.9,4,2,1.5,2,2.5,"First off, this beer looks REALLY nice. Nice color, solid head, and good retention. However, things go downhill really quickly. I took a sniff of this and said ""This is not an IPA."" There is no really hop presence on the nose - very much an amber or red. The taste follows with no assertiveness. Lots of sweetness, but very little bitterness. In fact, as it warms, it gets even sweeter - weird. Not sure what was going on with this beer - maybe it's mislabeled? Not recommended.","montageman","Nov 01, 2008"
4,42.9,4,4,4,4,4,"The taste is light caramelly, bready maltiness, very juicy, with a light citrusy-leafy bitterness with hints of pine and grapefruit, apple, and orange marmalade. It's on the sweet side for an IPA, starting quite sweet, but the hops do just take over by the finish, with a lightly hop-dominated, lightly bitter finish, but still riding a somewhat thick sweetness. It's got a solid body, and is pretty balanced, making it tasty and drinkable, and voerall a good, solid beer. This clearly isn't a West coast-style IPA, but that's fine and I wasn't expecting one, nor do I want all IPAs to be like that anyway.","Offa","Oct 29, 2008"
2.12,-24.3,4,2,2,2,2,"Picked it up at Trader Joes Arroyo Grande and wish I would have kept my money. By far one of the WORST IPA's I have ever had. Poured from the bottle with good carbonation, settled with a dirty white head and gold in color. Smell was terrible. I could not smell any hops. It smelled like pure barley and water. No hops to mention, no backbone and no IPA.","barleywinefiend","Oct 29, 2008"

Taste is very very sweet with a strong soap flavor that lingers. This does not have that bitter hop taste of a I.P.A. This was husky soap sweet. Not true to style. I could not finish one 12 oz bottle. I asked the check out girl if she had tried it she said no but I could return it for a refund if didn't like it. I found my receipt in the trash and will get my money back tomorrow. What kills me is I have five beers that I cant drink and it's too late to go out. Should have picked up the stone I.P.A..

4,42.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured a medium, clear copper with a light white head that dissipated pretty quickly. It was pretty bubbly and smelled of both hops and strong malt and tasted just that--quite hoppy without masking a great maltiness as well. It feels medium bodied and delightfully bitter in the mouth. This IPA goes down pretty smooth with a slightly bitter and hoppy malt aftertaste which I found pretty enjoyable. Not bad at all for a $1 bottle of IPA!","jeremyd365","Apr 23, 2008"
3.32,18.6,3,3.5,3,3,4,"Light copper pour with a white head that leaves pretty quickly. Then the aroma gives a nice floral, woody character from the hops, but a little muted.

Taste is fairly similar; pretty good balance of hops and malt, although that apple-y malt flavor rears its head a little too much. Overall, this beer is just kind of insipid; thin and pretty weak, with some odd off-flavors that are decidedly un-IPAish.
