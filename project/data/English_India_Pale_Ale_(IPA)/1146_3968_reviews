"Overall: A decent take on an IPA. Nice citrus and grassy hop notes. Nothing great but a nice lighter take on the style."
""
"6 months past exp date so I will not do a thorough review. I remember it tasting a bit better previously. Very good example of the English IPA style. The English malt is not too strong and the hops are not overwhelming and little bite."

"A serviceable IPA. A vaguely fruity note in there, but it works. Otherwise well balanced -- mild but discernible hop bite on the finish."

"Had at Rocco's. Cisco likes"
""
"Clear, maize color. Poured fresh (1/14/15 BO) bottle from Wegmans into pint glass and produced two fingers of foam. Citrus notes in the smell. Very balanced malt and hop profile which matches the advertised English IPA style. Overall, a great representative of the style,"
"Will seek out and purchase again."
""
"Overall: I've always enjoyed English style IPAs but this still surprised me how good it is. It's very approachable for an IPA and is definitely a good starter beer for people just getting into craft beers but it also would easily be appreciated by passionate and seasoned beer drinkers. I am the latter. Cheers."
"If one puts aside any AB bias, this is a solid IPA if you're wanting an English IPA with balance."
"The best beer at my softball night bar. Not much to choose from."
""
""
""
"The aroma had me a bit worried but this is a good tasting IPA, perhaps a breakthrough IPA for people getting into the style. Not bad, don’t pass it up."
""
"Overall: 4 - A solid B beer, this is an enjoyable IPA. If you're in the mood for an easy drinking, pretty sessionable IPA, this would be a solid choice."
""
""
""
""
"Not my favorite IPA, smelled more like a sour than an IPA. Flavor was not there at all."
""
""
"For whatever reason I bought a six pack with no high expectations. This IPA was a very pleasant surprise. Beautiful golden color with a solid white head. Extremely well balanced and very drinkable. Lots of floral, pine and grapefruit taste going on. Beautiful IPA that's not overwhelming hoppy and bitter. This is my new ""go to"" IPA when you plan on having more than a couple."

"lol @ some reviews.  The bloke who said ""Way too much hops for me"" is actually a wine-loving chick.  The guy who said ""quack quack quack yum"" gets a mugs up from me."

"Dry fruity hop aroma.Amber gold colored body. A touch of pine in the nose too. Light fruity bitterness Wet and dry finish. Hint of malt sweetness. Crisp and filling. Indescribable at times. Amazing."
"Looks good, has a clean taste. It's ok, nothing spectacular."
""
""

""
""
""
"one of my go to ipas.  always good to have around."
""
""

""

"First thing I noticed was the smell of citrus, I personally love it. when poured it pours a fluffy white head and is kind of a orange/amber color. At first I was a little apprehensive because of lesser ""pale ales", but i was quickly proven wrong. The hops definitely make themselves known and have somewhat of an overpowering presence but at the same time it is still delicious. It's not as smooth or drinkable as other beers but is definitely worth a shot and is a good first IPA for anyone who has not tried an IPA."
""
""
""
"Gold with creamy white foam (16oz draft) with good lacing;grapefruit nose; hoppy lemongrass start / ""Midwest"" style IPA showing a smidge of citrus hops; medium lite mouthfeel with dry bitter finish; overall, typical Midwest style commercial IPA and easy to drink and tasty."
""
""
""
"O:  A good beer.  Much better than expected."
""
""
"Overall- A really good IPA, I recommend it"
"Not the worst IPA. Easy to drink, fairly smooth and not overpowering like IPA's tend to be."
""
"Give me this bird anytime!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Not much hop presence, a little too malty, but not bad"
""
" Came out in a tall glass with the hour glass shape , the beer tasted fresh , the hops were not there so much in the noise but really picked up on them while drinking , after a few desert wings and hot wings I could have been drinking coors light but I kept ordering these , all in all not a bad IPA in a dry county where I live"
"Good everyday type beer. Great after a long day"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent IPA, doesn't really pack much of a punch though."
"Poured a clear golden orange body with well-carb'd one finger head and lace patches down the glass.  Light citric hops and a little bit of sweetness and bread in the aroma.  Smooth, easy drinking IPA, ""session"" like, there is a caramel/honey like sweetness that balances with herbal, citric hops that are light on the tongue.  Little bit of breadiness for fuller mouthful and clean finish.  Simple and enjoyable beer."
"A go to easy drinking IPA of which you can have a few without getting tired of the taste and it doesn't kick your *ss."
""
"Very smooth IPA with a low bitterness.  A very well made session IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's ok. Not my first choice if I'm going for an IPA."
""
""
""
"Bought a sample pack of Goose Island beers. The IPA poured with a clear golden brown appearance with average lacing. The beer had a very thick head but it dissipated quickly. Aromas are similar to a dried, citrus fruit smell and malts. In terms of taste, the IPA more has a bitter and bready flavoring over anything citrus-like. I did like the carbonation for the IPA; crisp carbonation and dry. Overall, not too bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 oz bottle.  Pours deep golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head, nice lacing and lively carbonation.  Aroma is of citrusy, piney, herbal hops and caramel malt and some fruit.  Body is medium and crisp.  Earthy, herbal hops, caramel and biscuit malt and ripe fruit fill the mouth.  Finish is long, dry and earthy.  Good English style, drinkable IPA."
""
""
"Overall: Goose Island has been a bit hit and miss for me - on the one hand I loved their 312 Wheat beer but Honkers was a bit of a let down. This, I feel, hits the bullseye for me - for sure, there are more aggressively hopped beers out there but this is a good introduction to the more bitter side of things."
""
"Overall- Quite classic and worth checking out if fresh."
""
""
"Overall: very good, but a bit too aggressive and lacking the subtle and balanced flavors of the milder English IPA style."
""
"Honestly, it is an impressive IPA. Unique in it's character. It's very balanced because of the strong malt. Not extremely hoppy for an IPA but nonetheless a tasty concoction. Went great with pepporoni pizza and sausage! Another winner from Goose Island."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice but NOT AN ENGLISH STYLE IPA! It's a generic piney American IPA, albeit a good example of one."

""
"Way too much hops for me."
""
""
"I love IPA's and this is one of the better ones that I've had."
""
""
""
""
"O: a nice ale, though I am admittedly partial to the more American approach to the IPA - presents a clean body with subtler hop expressions than you'd get in many American IPAs. The malts are sturdier, and the ale has distinct character."
""
""
"Delicious Beer easily my favorite"
"Amazing beer easily one of my favorites"
""
""
"one of the best IPA's ive ever had. not super hoppy but deff an ipa"
""
""
""
"Nice Amber color, lite hoppy smell, hoppy bitterness, lite mouth feel. Good IPA for a 5.9 alc, 55 IBU"
""
""
""
"It's probably a good beer.  I'm just not a fan of IPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
"best IPA ive had, great all day IPA"
""
"Too bland and uninspiring...tasted like a hoppy Yuengling"
""
"Smooth and crisp beer. Low IBU of 55 for an IPA. I did enjoy it at the Phoenix airport."
"Good beer one of better ipa"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"At 55 IBU, this isn't really an IPA but rather a pale ale. It's an easy drink, and meets expectations as described on the bottle with a citrus nose followed by a malty backbone and hoppy finish. But this is not hoppy enough, to me, to be called an IPA. Label it a pale, and it may get a slightly higher score from me."

"Drier than I expected. Ok but not great."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I would say this is an average IPA. Maybe above average. It certainly looks pretty in a glass but the oily mouthfeel and the bready, dryness at the end prevent this one from being a GOOD IPA. I think it seems like Goose Island didn't want to commit in anyone direction so it ended up being somewhere between an American and English IPA. Decent!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A rather bland and uninspiring IPA. Granted, it's supposedly an English style and shouldn't be expected to have the pizzazz of an American west coast styled IPA, but this particular brew still lacks any real depth or character. It does have a decent hop bitterness (for the style) but otherwise has little going for it."

"3.41/5: InBev be damned, this is a nice IPA"
""
""
""
""

"Honey yellow in color with good clarity. Poured with a thick, soapy foam that slowly reduced to a healthy, soapy cap. Biscuity, lightly toasted malt aroma followed by fresh citrus and floral hop notes. Medium bodied with refreshing, crisp, carbonation from beginning to end. Bready, biscuity malt flavors up front followed by citrus and tangy floral hops through the middle. Citrus orange hop flavors return and intensify near the end as this finished crisply with light biscuity flavors and lingering hop bitterness."

"12 oz bottle in a goblet glass (not in a thistle like the bottle recommends).  Amber in color.  Medium size head, and lacing that really clings (almost sticks) to the glass.  Smells of flowers and malt, almost a perfume fragrance to it.  Taste is quite strong, dominated by hops.  Faint fruit notes.  Really herbal and leafy.  I can certainly taste an alcoholic tinge in the back of my palette.  For an IPA, I've tasted better.  Overall good."
""
""
""
"O: very enjoyable; aroma is really nice and the bitter finish is a great ending;  hoppier and more bitter than I expected from an English IPA;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This goes down really well, it has a big drinkability. Still, expected it to be more ""American"" (didn't inform myself before, the label does say ""Old World Style""), but it's still a solid IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a bright, gleaming orange color, with a big, creamy head that clings to the glass. The aroma isn't overly skewed to the hoppy characteristics, with notes of citrus peel and pine contrasting against light bready malts. The flavor is a bit dull and earthy, although there is some bright pine character and a light bready sweetness at its base. The light, fine carbonation is nice, but there isn't as much lingering bitterness as I expected (although I'm not sure how I developed such an expectation). Overall, this is a solid but unremarkable IPA that I will gladly drink up but won't seek out."
""
""
"O - Great IPA.  Very drinkable.  Perfect sixer for a barbecue."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear golden honey color.  A good head of white foam that lingers for a while.  Has a nice citrus note, not overwhelming but nicely balanced.  A solid go to IPA on a Summer day."

"Poured from 12oz bottle into a chilled glass. Pours a medium amber color with a two finger white head that dissipates quickly, moderate lacing on the glass. It smells of light malt, a fruity essence mostly citrus notes, a nice smell actually. Tastes of light malt, and citrusy after tastes. Light bodied with a crispy carbonation mouthfeel. Overall a decent IPA the best part of it is it's aroma"

"A golden ale in colour slightly hitting the ruby reds in glass. Head disappointingly loose and short lived although small remnants remained floating downstream like soldiers pushing the enemy back deeper down the glass and into my belly.  Taste is hoppy up front, bitter down back. Floral, fruity and slightly spiced. Delicious. Mouthfeel is full and fresh and long lived. On reflection? I would do it all over again!"

"Overall this is a very good representation of what an IPA should be. Not the best I've had, but a good option as far as easy to find supermarket beers go. Has a strong enough hops character to push it to the IPA level, but also has that malt backbone that is sometimes lost in an attempt to showcase the hops. With some better local options in NC, I probably wouldn't buy this one again, but still a good beer."

"Overall 3.75: Very good IPA. Great balance of malt and hops and a very appealing blend of hops. Satisfying and perfect for sessioning. Will not make you re-evaluate your opinion of IPAs or life in general; just a good, solid beer. If you find it and are on the fence about whether you should purchase it, IMHO, it is certainly worth a try."

"Deep amber in appearance. Nice malty smell with hints of ginger. A bit stronger than most American IPA's, very full bodied. Malty mouth feel, with strong hop signature as it goes down. Very sweet after taste with bitter hop characteristics. Excellent beer , not just for type, but overall."

"Poured a nice clear amber with a half finger white head that dissipated leaving some lacing. It looks pretty nice, true to form for an IPA, but nothing standout. Scents of orange, grapefruit peel, some tropical fruit, peach, slight floral aromas and extremely faint pine resin. A very fruit forward aroma, yet also quite muted in its overall intensity for an IPA. Still very nice and appealing. Flavor begins with faintly bitter citrus, moving into strong floral hop notes and faint pine resin. Finishes with a nice hit of floral hops and citrus peel, with some slight pine. Aftertaste is floral with some hints of bitter citrus peel. A very floral IPA flavor and not as bitter and hop-forward as many American IPAs, but a good English IPA flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with low carbonation and a resinous feel. A good, true to style IPA mouthfeel. Overall this is a pretty good IPA, with a nice aroma and flavor combination, that while not the most pronounced and bold, are well balanced and pleasant. It's not the greatest IPA out there, even for an English IPA, but it is nice."
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely a better-than-average IPA. Hops are prominent but yet restrained. Moderate carbonation. A little malt and sweet fruity flavors too. This is an easy-drinking, flavorful beer that doesn't cross the line into pure hop-bomb. Nice in the summer."

"O: Goose Island IPA is not an amazing beer. It's just not. It's a bit on the ""safe"" side. Hop-forward, but never bordering pungent. Nothing out of the ordinary in any department. What Goose Island IPA is, however, is an extremely approachable example of the style. It's perfect as an introduction to IPAs as well as a session IPA, I think. There's nothing overwhelming going on here, it's not sitting on an obnoxious ABV, and it's certainly not a polka dotted unicorn that's only found once in a blue moon. It's simply a middle-of-the-road IPA and I happen to love that. This always has a place in my fridge."

"Nothing exceptional, but a very good drinking IPA. In the middle in so many ways - Pleasant aroma, taste and bitterness. Not over-hopped, like so many craft IPA's have become. Definitely a brew that can have one after another, and it will stand up. Certainly a beer to have when you're having more than one."

"DATE TASTED: February 14, 2014... GLASSWARE: Corsendonk thistle...OCCASION: in between storms--with another of Dave's Super Bowl leftovers... APPEARANCE: massive, mountainous white head that begins as an iceberg peak; consistently active, orange amber body; glass lip to beer top lacing... AROMA: aromatic floral hops; slightly malty; piques the interest...PALATE: creamy, active and warming at the throat; the modest alcohol is properly situated--a balanced mouthfeel...TASTE: powerful,, cutting, arresting--any siege-like hyperbole aptly fits; wonderfully sprucey and citric without being overbearing... OVERALL: kudos to Dave for his Super Bowl selections--both Honker's and the IPA play well as samplings or sessionables; a big IPA that remains accessible and relatively affordable..."

"This is a pretty decent IPA from Goose Island. There are tons of Grapefruit notes in the nose and in the taste of the beer. There's not a whole lot of complexity going on here though. Overall a very pleasurable and easy sessionable beer with a pleasant mouthfeel and some nice carbonation. Very little bitterness. Lacks the real heavy hop character in most IPAs brewed today."

"The Verdict: Not bad. A solid, balanced IPA with everything you expect. I may not go hunting it, but I won’t turn one down either."
"Decent IPA but i did expect a little bit more from Goose Island. The flavor was good out of a bottle or a glass but i tended to prefer a bottle because it caught most of the dry flavor from the IPA. Good as a casual drinker or to have after a light meal, but not up there with my favorite IPAs. However, I would recommend it as a beer you absolutely have to have after eating pumpkin seeds"
""
""
""
"Overall: This wasn't a bad brew, but I was really let down by the flavor. Everything else about this beer is pretty great, but the flavor is just lacking the complexity that I've come to expect from really great IPA's. Solid brew, but not sure I'll be coming back to it, especially with how saturated the market is with IPA's right now."

"Over all a nice english IPA. I have had better American IPAs but this is an offering I would go back to time and time again, cause its just so darn drinkable. 5.9% helps it to be sessionable and flavorful in one package. Try this one out, I'd buy again."

"O - okay.. I hate the fact the giants bought one of my all time favorite breweries. It sucks honestly! But now the major question...?? Has my old friend been changed since the buyout? Not as of now anyway. Will it? I sure as hell hope not. Goose Island India Pale Ale has been a friend of mine as well as my close friends and family for years now. Whether its been a mid summer camping trip with those late night camp fire stories or a cold winter Friday night after a long week. I hope InBev never change GI. They are marketing people and if you buy a brewery with as rich craft beer tradition as this one you know the only way to sell it is to keep it the same. I can say though with confidence that India Pale Ale from GI hasn't changed as of now anyway. Lets hope it never does as it really is an enjoyable, flavorful, legend in our world of craft beer"

"Anyway, great smell - fruity, not one scent overpowering the other. Has a great hue, lacing all the way down the bottle, and a good head that pours out of the bottle, white and frothy. Mouthfeel was too carbonated for my taste, and speaking of the taste - it was bold, refreshing, and I could taste the distant fruitiness in there - mixed well with the hops. Unfortunately, it is an IPA and I'm not quite there yet. Overall, a really good beer and one that I would reach for, even if it is an India Pale Ale..."

"I call this a muted ipa. In a way disappointing, because its missing a certain hop bite characteristic of other solid IPAs, in my opinion. The malt and bread takes over and tames any hop forefront is best as I can describe it. Now there is a pleasant citrus flavor going on that's zesty and refreshing. The mouth feels smooth and nicely carbonated, unlike how it looked upon pouring this into my pint glass. But all in all, this one is borderline for me. There's enough tart and rind in the initial taste to satisfy, nothing outstanding or complex, a good mouthfeel, but then a bland breadbasket of malty cardboard to remind me this is not my favorite example if the style. Is that last statement i just made a bit harsh? If it is, then it may just be my honest impression of what's left in an ipa's flavor when there aren't enough hops to taste! Still, im glad this respected brewery is now available in my market."

"I feel this is one step ahead of starter IPA as the flavors are not liberally complex but it does not assault you with an over hopping. Just a good tasty ale, and that's all right with me."
""
"Pours a nice clear copper color with a bubbling 3 finger head that slowly falls but never departs. The nose is very nice. A balance between spicey, fruity, sweet hop and caramel malt base. I like the hop profile on this. Not too strong in any one direction, but with a lot going on in it. Flavor is not as nice as the nose. The hop is mostly spicey to a touch earthy over top a solid caramel base. Good balance, but not popping enough in the hop. It could shine, but it is a slight disappointment. The feel is moerate, with a light to moderate carbonation. The slighly light carbonation is probably from my aggressive pour. Overall, a very solid brew."
"O - You know this beer is not horrible. I'd drink it again. But I also wouldn't be jumping for joy shouting ""yippy skippy! More Goose island IPA!!"" 3.5 is the best I can give it."

"sorry, I tried to like this beer but I just cant get around the soapy taste of it. Everything about this beer screams awesomeness.-the color is superb, it smells of grain and grass and good piney hops. but then something happens. . . the beer goes sweet but not in a good way. and then boom! you are hit with floral,soapy, perfumey nastiness. I believe this is the same yeast that they use in the goose island honkers ale (E.s.b.) which is very fruity also. fruity esters are out. ymmv. :)"
""
""
""
""

"Overall, a good but not great IPA. I could certainly see myself having another one of these, but would not go out of my way to find it or recommend it to a friend. I did enjoy this more than any of the previous offerings by Goose Island I have tried."

"The was a nice, clear orange color with a decent white head...and from here on out, I think that GI really missed the boat on the English-part of the IPA. Both the smell and taste I expected to be more malty than they were, as both I felt were too hoppy. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice citrus and pine hop to both the aroma and taste, but I thought that it should not be as pronounced. The beer had a light to moderate feel, nice carbonation and a nice dry, bitter aftertaste. Overall, a decent IPA, but certainly not an English IPA."
""
""
"On tap at an airport bar. Go figure. Pours an average golden copper color. Smell is very citrus forward with a hint of sweetness. Taste follows nose with just a bit of floral hops in there. Highly carbonated and below medium bodied. Overall, pretty average. The flavor is not enough to hide the hop bitterness, which makes it hard to drink. This beer is rated at 55 IBU, but feels way higher."
"This pop is a delightful copper color. Smells like beer, not fruit. An astringent and bitter start gives way to a crisp finish, with a sparkling aftertaste. A very nice brew."
"O - This is my first review. IMO Goose Island IPA is underrated, as I feel it is one of the best commercial East Coast IPAs, and at $8.99 a six pack one of the best values."

"Goose Island IPA has a thick, spongy, off-white head, a clear, orange-gold appearance, lots of tiny streaming bubbles, and thick, splotchy lacing left behind. The aroma is of faint citrus, pine, and some white bread. Taste is of citrus & pine, walking hand in hand with white bread and white bread toast. One would not guess this is a 55 IBU beer. Mouthfeel is light to watery, and Goose Island IPA finishes crisp, clean, refreshing, dry, and drinkable. Overall, this is most excellent. RJT"
""
""
""
"Personally the light color of this IPA is classic to me. It has a nice initial flavor and finish. Not too bitter and lovely aroma that evolves as during the tasting. For a mass produced beer, it continues to have a lot of character and flavor. Respect!"
"A burnt amber color with a tan head, this is a very enjoyable ale.. The smell is of peppery, spicy hops, and the taste is a solid malt backbone, semi-dry, with lots of hop bitterness. Rugged and earthy, but well constructed. This is a very drinkable IPA."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer and one I could recommend. That being said, it's not one of my favorites and for this style there are a lot of better options. I would drink it again, though."

"Have been drinking this one for awhile. Not a bad beer, but have had so many IPA's now that surpass the maltiness and hoppiness. It is a decent beer, but if you like IPA's it is just sevicable. Decent balance of flavors, but not enough of the hops for me. Have only tried a few Goose Island entries so I am far from an expert on their overall offerings, but this one is just OK in my book."
""
"O - I like this beer. The smell does not excite me as much as many IPAs, but the taste is nice and above drinkable."
""
""
"Tried this for first time last night. Very balanced for an IPA. No smells or tastes overpowered any others. Just the right amount for someone starting to explore the IPA scene. Paired well with dinner which was Grilled Salmon and Grilled Yellow Squash. Carbonation was spot on, and aftertaste was mild hoppy."
""
"O- in a world of in your face hop craziness, there are still a few EIPA's that arent complete malt bombs, this is one of those, its just an easy to drink beer, not fancy, and not too over the top hoppy. It is however pretty tasty and nice to have these from time to time"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I probably won't revisit this beer. It's a solid option if there's nothing else, but it's hardly impressionable if it's your first time sampling Goose Island. They have far better offerings, and I suggest starting with those."
""
""
""
""
""
"GI's IPA is not flashy but it's very well-executed. In the current (2013) market, maybe it's more of an APA, but whatever."
""
""
"O: A balanced and sessionable IPA without much flavor or complexity. I imagine this brew would have been looked upon differently before the hop-bomb invasion. Alas, now it will probably serve as a good introduction to the style without insulting those who prefer something a bit more assaulting."

"IPA poured a dark golden color with a lacing head that wouldn't quit. The smell was rather malty and a bit stale, with hints of hops. The taste was much of the same, strong malt flavors, hints of hops, and a bit of a stale flavor. Flavors were full, and nice carbonation, but it didn't overcome those stale tastes. Overall an okay malty IPA."

"O: lighter on flavor but still good"
"Overall: This is a great IPA, no getting around it. It is wonderfully balanced- it won't destroy your palate, but it also provides a nice kick of hop flavor that you would want from an IPA. I could imagine this would be a good beer for those new to IPAs, or for those of us who want to have multiple IPAs in one sitting and still be able to taste our food and feel our tongues."

"This is a classic English ipa with traditional hop characteristics that are appropriate. The addition of the cascade hops helps diffuse some of the English malt mouth feel and brings forth a nice refreshing citrus note at the end.the beer poured a nice lacy head that maintained its bold prescience throughout the consumption."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - An excellent introduction to American Ale!"

"12 oz tap pour, to the rim. Clear burnt orange color. Citrus hops on the nose, not much else. Full body, nice, sweet malt flavor with a well balanced hop bite. Really kind of muddled, not dramatically citrusy, nor overly resiny. Clean tasting, crisp drinking. Simply not memorable."
""
""
""
""
"O- Decent little English IPA. Not excellent, but smooth and clean."
""

"Poured from tap into imperial pint at chilis to go in the west palm beach airport. Nice golden color with 2 fingers of foam and lots of lacing. Nice piney hop aroma but mild like a noble type hop wih a good malty nose. Nice bitter hop flavor with bready malts. Its a bit over hopped and under malty for the style but a great brew overall. Nice find in an airport..."
""
""
""
"An enjoyable, well done English IPA, though nothing overall there was nothing particularly memorable about it."
"O- Overall, I'm not sure how this beer made it past me all these years without me trying it. It wasn't particularly outstanding by any means, but it was above average. It wasn't worth the $8.75 that I paid for it, as I could pick up a six-pack for that price, but it sure beat the rest of the selections available. This beer smelled really nice. If I'm ever in a similar scenario I wouldn't hesitate to purchase. However, at the bottle shop this will never be a purchase as there are many many better beers out there."
""
"Overall, a good interpretation of the style. Doesn't really stack up to the likes of Samuel Smith but for a widely available American beer, it's a nice job."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a translucent yellow orange with a one finger head. Smells of floral and earthy hops, very inviting aroma. Tastes of floral hops and earthy aftertaste. Beer is a tad over carbonated, but light body finishes nicely. Overall, a superb beer."
""
"O- Delicious, and mild for an IPA, but still well within the range. A good IPA to break into the style. I'd recommend this to new IPA drinkers."
"O: Had depth, balance and was very well crafted, they nailed this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a golden amber with a half finger white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of sweet biscuit malt, light citrus hops. Flavor dominated by lemon citrus and citrus and grassy hops, light biscuit malt. Finishes a bit abruptly with mild citrus, apple juice, but a faint residual grassy hop bitterness. Nice medium body with light creaminess. An adequate IPA, but could have used a bit more malt to support the citrus components. Hops a light to moderate. Not quite as malty as I'd expect for and English IPA style."
""
""
""
""

"This is a nice, simple and very drinkable IPA. Not a hophead dream come true, but a good easy drinking affordable IPA nonetheless."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I really like this English IPA. It is quite malty. The moderate bitterness is enjoyable. The grapefruit and pine are refreshing. Honestly, it's close to an American IPA. I would probably get this again."
""
""
"Pours a golden copper color with a finger of head, some of which sticks around for a bit leaving nice lacing on the glass. The nose has hop notes and some lemon as well. The flavor is a solid combination of malt and hops and the finish is dry and bitter. This is a pretty good offering for a single IPA."

"O - Nothing spectacular here. Worth ticking off the list, but won't seek this out again."
""
""
""
"Overall - A quality example of the English IPA style. This won't satisfy those hop heads looking for their next ""hIghBU"" fix, but it suits this beer adventurer just fine. One I'll have to revisit at some point in time."
"To be honest up front, I need to revisit this, as this came on the heels of a weekend IPA binge. No chance in this scenario, as I tackled some top notch IPA's over the weekend. Had this on tap in CO, so likely not the freshest. This was very good combined with blackened fish tacos. Very easy to drink!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This IPA has a big foamy body. The carbonation is noticeable in a frothy rather than prickly way, accenting smoky dark malts. It goes down easy with very little bitterness for my palate, which is accustomed to mouth-wrecking northwest IPAs. This one is more in the British style, with notes reminiscent of Belgian yeast: a bit of bubblegum and some tropical fruitiness. Alcohol warmth sends this one through the mouth smoothly as lacing lines the glassware. English-style Chicago IPA in the Seattle-Tacoma airport; just fine."

""

""
""
""
"O: Overall, above average but not great. Ill finish the 6 pack bout doubt I would buy this again. Not that its bad, there are just so many great IPAs available, and this is not one of them."
""
"This beer pours a medium golden hue, with a two fingered, fine bubbled head, which has good enough retention. The aroma is ripe with sweet stone fruit and tropical fruits, and a bit of honey. The taste follows the nose, with a medium, balanced hop bitterness, and a sweet malt character - a tad bit too sweet, but good flavor overall. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mild bitterness perception, and rather wet. Overall, this is a very nice tasting English style IPA, but maybe a bit too sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Solid ipa – great flavors and aromas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent average IPA. Easy to drink, good with food. Worse than others, better than most."
""
""
""
""
"Bright citrus hop aroma, particularly through the foam initially. A bit more difficult to gather as the pours settles however, yet always available with some agitation. Taste starts with a creamy grainy delivery. Segues to a coarse middle of neutral grain followed by a watery flash and a decent lingering bitter orange character that doesn't have a harsh character to it. Medium bodied feel though it varies through the palate quite a bit. Overall a decent beer for the style and offers good drinkability yet doesn't quite grab you either. Likely exactly what they were aiming for however."
"Taste is decent as well, but nothing great. Pine and orange peel hop flavors with more bitterness than flavor. Malts are big enough, neither applying a slather of sweet caramel nor ghosting across like many a West Coast IPA. Mouthfeel follows in the same vein, solidly medium. Really, this beer is pretty boring and just tastes like a recipe formulated back in the 90's....thats no fault of GI really, I understand the need to keep a consistent recipe for the fanboys, but I wont be buying this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Too sweet for me. Although the nose is great, there isn't enough flavour hops to offset the sweet malt to keep it interesting."
""
"Overall. Maybe not my favorite ipa style, but that being said it's a good brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great example of a classic English IPA. The balance of hops and malt is spot on. I love that the malt shines through on this and that the nose and flavor of the hops do not completely cover this up. The beer is crystal clear...which means they have great filtration. This is a more sessionable IPA and I love enjoying this with a burger."
"O: classic IPA that isn't too much of anything. 4. Great IPA to have a few of at a time, nice for all year round."

""

"Goose Island brings another quality product to the table. Sure, there are more explosive IPA's on the market, but this is one that I would feel comfortable doing as an everyday IPA, considering its not too high alcohol and relatively lower price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't like IPA's but this one is an exception. It has a nice bitterness to it, but doesn't leave an aftertaste in your mouth the way most IPA's do. I've recommended it to others who are not big fans of IPA's and they like it as well. Maybe this is a nice ""transition"" beer if you're used to drinking beers which are less hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I used to drink a lot of this beer. It was one of the few beers that, once I started drinking it, I could not put down. It was simply delicious. Now it is just average; one of many of average American style IPA's. I don't know if AB-InBev/Goose Island intentionally changed the recipe to cut corners, or maybe they had to change the recipe due to a shortage of certain ingredients. I don't know. But, it is not the same beer. And I came to this conclusion before knowing about the AB-InBev deal."
""
""
""
""
"Clear golden orange with a thick, lasting head of foam and big clusters of lacing. Floral and citrus hops greet the nose followed by sweet, toasted grain. Green pine and grass. Somewhat sweet peach, grapefruit, and floral hop flavor. Biscuit-y malt underneath it all. Medium bodied and not seriously bitter. This will likely fall into our ""tasty, easy-drinking"" six-pack rotation."

"Bottom line, this may be the best IPA available in limited market areas or gas stations, but it serves the purpose and may be your best choice if you are on vacation,in the sticks,or in a ham-and-egger sports bar."
"The beer is a nice golden amber color with a solid frothy off white head. It's aroma is filled with tropical fruit and citrus, the smell is very inviting. I love the taste as well, I noticed strong pine/ hop resin flavor followed by a subtle light fruitiness. It feels very smooth with a medium body and a dry finish. This is an exceptional ipa, I would definitely drink this brew on many occasions."

"O-Really well balanced brew. Will definitely seek this out again"
""

"Overall a pretty solid beer. After my first sip I told Da Boss that this drinks like a classic English IPA...very true to the style."
""
""
""
"The clear golden amber body was quite effervescent and formed a two finger thick foamy head. The aroma hops were citric floral, and came across as sweeter smelling than a typical IPA. The taste was a combination of biscuit like malt and grapefruit from the hops. The body felt a little more thin than typical IPAs from the East Coast and Midwest, and leaned more towards the West Coast style of the likes of Stone and Rogue. It got fuller and rounder as it warmed up."

"overall a 3.5 in my book... wouldn't go out of my way to get it, nor would I necessarily recommend it..."

"notes; this is fantastic beer, nicely balanced with bitterness slightly outweighing the crystal malts. will buy more soon."
""
""
"This IPA is all over my town locally now on tap. It is a good representation of the style, not over the top very drinkable and sessionable but with a good hop bite to it. The color of this beer is very nice and darker then alot of IPAs out there. Lacing of the glass is exceptional. Mouthfeel is a little thin for an IPA but not bad. Are there better IPA's? Of course. But this is a good fall back that won't let you down."
"D: Meh. Better than macro swill, nothing offensive, but very plain and lackluster, boring. A chugging beer that's not chuggable due to the aggressive carbo."
"A decent tasting IPA, the light citrus and maybe a hint of malts make this a pretty easy beer to drink, I do although like a bit more hops coming through but I guess at $6.99 a 12 pack this will do just fine for a couple of days."
""

"Poured into a tulip glass. The beer pours clear golden with a thick white head that retreats slowly. Webbed lacing is left down the side of the glass in abundance as the head recedes. There are some visible streaming bubbles as well. There are aromas of sweet malt with some pine and citrus from the hops. The malt and citrus hop flavors tend to dominate up front. It's almost like a bit of orange and not so much grapefruit. It has some nice bready flavors from the malt and there's a touch of caramel. The hops yield a nice floral quality in the flavor and the back end bitterness helps bring some balance there. This is nicely done. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is slightly dry and crisp. The smoothness of this beer helps the drinkability in many ways. This is a very good beer and would be a fine gateway IPA for newbies to the style."

"well, I guess this is going to be everywhere now since its corporately owned now. I had it on tap at the stadium inn on evans. the pour revealed a amber tinted golden color with less than in inch of thick soapy white head. English malts and mild hop bitterness are well balanced in the nose. hops in the pine family, but nothing aggressive, and actually smells more like a pale ale than an ipa. the flavor is also well balanced, but sort of generic. more malty than most, even of the English variety. there is a huge bready body, its like taking a bit of sandwich in a lot of ways. the hops don't really present themselves until the end, where some bitterness appears against the caramel malt sweetness. lots of body, good carbonation, just a funny aftertaste holding this back. overall I am not super impressed, but ill take it over most everything else coming from Budweiser these days. it will have to work in a sports bar setting for awhile im afraid."

"Poured into a beer glass, Has a slight 1 finger head, and a nice golden color. The lacing is nice and stays consistent as I drank. A nice citrusy smell. A decent amount of fruit at the beginning, and follows with nice malt finish. Nothing overwhelming, but nice composition. Light amount of carbonation, with a lighter body - I'd like this on a hot day. I thought this was a very good beer - not a crazy hoppy west coast beer I generally have and enjoy."

"O - Overall, It was pretty solid although nothing great. Very easy drinking, but with no true complexity. Would fare well as a summer beer."
"Overall: Wow, i can't believe this is scored so low! (Relatively speaking) It has the most amazing balance, is enjoyable, has a lot of depth, finesse and flavor. Probably just lacking a bit in the flavor depth department but it's still world class. On a side note, after checking the hops used, i have got to say, they really achieved something special. For those of us who brew, to get 4 different hops in and make the hop character taste seamless, rich and deep is just nothing short of masterful."

""
"O- I still love Goose Island even if they were bought out by InBev. As of now I haven't seen much quality deterioration. This beer is greatly drinkable and not overwhelmed with hops. Great beer to relax with."
"Fresh keg just tapped, full carbonation evident then and still three days later. Nice aroma, I like the hop scent. There are those that reviewed this and commented it is closer to an English style IPA and I agree with that but the nose has a bit more aroma to it from the "" Styrian, Fuggle, Cascade, Centennial"" combination than the usual from that island nation. This is not a phenomenal beer to me, very drinkable 5.9%abv and not offensive in any way. Gotta like the price too. So I rate it over 4 points on every item, I just like good IPA's and appreciate the occasional changeup from the higher ABV suds I have had lately."

"O- I live near Chicago so this beer is always available and priced reasonably. For the price, this is an excellent IPA. I love the bitter hoppiness and will continue to purchase this beer. One of my favorites by Goose Island."

"Really unexceptional, bought thinking it would be something special, to bitter in not a good way. Should have done more research, would never have bought had I realized in was owned by a major... My own fault, and I have had worst so just average for me."

"Pours a deep amber in color with a average white head and above average lacing. Smells of sweet grapefruit with some yeasty notes and citra hops. The taste is not quite up to par with the smell but still a nice mixture of wheat grains lemon and a lingering hop taste. The mouthfeel is good for the style and makes for a sessionable 5.9%. Overall I am pleased, not something to seek out but a good ""English IPA""."

"Pours a orange amber with a medium lasting beige head with good lacing. Aroma and taste of caramel malt, bready, yeast with some good earthy piney hops and some mild citrus notes. Palate is a nicely balanced combination of sweet malt and hops with moderate carbonation. Finish is of caramel malt, yeast, some citrus flavors followed by some nice earthy piney hops for balance. Overall a very good, tasty and nicely balanced English IPA."
""
""

"12oz bottle. Bright yellow color, good head. Aroma is mildly hoppy, fruity, nothing spectacular but nothing bad either. Flavor had a definite hop aspect, mild bitterness, decent.

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and herbal hops. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors."

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Off-white head, moderate retention. Soapy and clear lacing, clear copper body. Aroma is very, very, very floral. Almost like an artificial lavender flavor. If I was a bee, this would be my go to beer. Some malt/caramel sweetness. Taste is once again, very floral bitterness with some sweetness on the back end. Creamy and tongue coating. Interesting and unique IPA, maybe not the most delicious, but interesting none the less."

It's not bad beer though and has quite a solid hoppy character, just find it wanting a bit of balance, quite a bit of astringent bitterness for a relatively light body. Once it calms it remains quite fresh and fruity, but nothing beyond a good though somewhat average IPA. 3.5"

"Goose Island IPA pours a bright gold with a nice, but not huge head. The aroma is citrusy, herbal and piney, with some nice floral notes. Spicy hops dominate the flavor with a really nice pale malt background. Slightly resiny citrus comes through in the finish, with a nice, assertive hop bight. Overall I think it's a really nice IPA, a bit different than some of the hop bombs out there, but really balanced as far as the style goes."
""
""
""
""
"Yields two plus fingers of frothy, loose eggshell white foam, its delicacy causes it to crater, more like form long valleys, nice retention once it gets down to a surface coating, the lacing is thin but wide and sticks extremely well. Light amber color consistent and bright, mild yellowing around the edges, not a whole lot of bubbles but what’s there keeps coming, manages to catch your eye. Yeasty and honeyed in the nose while concurrently maintaining a bitters to peat and green hops edge, peppercorns, tangerine rind, as it warms more caramel and apricot to nectarine fruit scents appear, full presence and good lasting power. Medium to full-bodied, creamy mouth feel that has it both coating the palate and pushing outwards towards the cheeks. Perhaps slightly over-carbonated but depends on what texture you desire. Some mineral water, quinine, bitters through the attack then it’s warm biscuits, honey, caramel, orange to tangerine pulp, wet flower petals and even some mint leaf. Full peach, apricot, pear, green melon fruit. No matter how you slice it, not very herbaceous, not very toasty, not very spicy, neither sweet nor dry. As if insidiously crafted to appeal yet defy description of why it’s appealing."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the drinkability. There was a nice balance by the end, and the hops remained crisp to the last drop. We found the nose to be overly dominated by hops, and we really missed that dark, fusel phenolic character so characteristic for the style. This is easily a sessionable beer, but stylistically this was not a home run for us, as we would better characterize this as a dirty American IPA."
"Overall: Okay, a good choice when there was nothing else."
""
""
"O-much better if you drink this as an APA rather than an IPA. It's mild and easy drinking with out much bitterness or flavor. I got a 6-pack. It won't be wasted."
""
""
""

"This was a mediocre IPA. Unfortunately I wasn’t lucky enough to have tried this beer before AB – Inbev got their hooks into Goose Island. I’m guessing it was probably way better and more robust back then, judging by other reviews prior to the acquisition."
""
" The flavor has hints of orange zest with pine and light tangy yeast with subtle herbal hop flavors which go well with the light malt which tastes less sweet than expected with mild toasted grain elements and light pepper mixes with subtle grapefruit tinges in the semi-dry finish. Overall a solid IPA, I enjoyed the flavor with plenty of hops to dwell on while quaffing this -well balanced w/ a nice malt backbone."

"O: A really nice, Americanized English IPA at 5.9% ABV. Paired nicely with my spicy jambalaya and grilled monk fish. I'd definitely pick this up to compare to the bottled version, hoping for similar results."

"On tap in a shaker. Pours an amber-orange color with thin head; some lacing but not a lot. The nose is rather subtle, unexpected with an ipa. It has soft fruit smell like a fresh cut orange, floral and citrus hops as well. The taste is rather sweet malt with solid pine and grapefruit hop bitterness. Ten mouthfeel is a little thin with a crisp, bitter finish. Overall a very well-balanced ipa, but nothing overly extraordinary."

"Good not great. Like most Goose Island beers I've tried. It doesn't really have that distinct India Pale Ale flavor that is to be expected but it's unique in it's own right.

Nothing super special here, but just overall a nicely done and very drinkable IPA."

Lightly spicy and flowery. Malts as well. Maybe a bit too flowery for my tastes but still tastes pretty good. Light and thin mouthfeel. Overall, the floral hops are the main flavor a maybe push the envelope on being too floral. An alright IPA."

The lacing was consistent throughout and was visible at each pause from drinking. The smell was pleasant and clearly hopps. The taste was excellent, smooth with a hint of citris. The mouthfeel was very pleasant and encouraging. I have not been a fan of other india pale ales and was hesitant about trying this. I was surprised by the taste and the quality of Goose Island will place this on my buy list for the future."

"O: this wasn't a bad beer, but wasn't anything spectacular but I was hoping for better. Being that it was pretty light, it might be good for a good April day as today. I thought it would be maltier since it is considered an English IPA, but in reality I'm not disappointed with this beer I guess I was only hoping for better. I think I would only have this again if it was on tap."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is an orange-yellow coloring that is clear and crisp, with a thin, filmy coating of white head on top. Aromas have a great citrus blending balancing out a floral hops presence. Tangerine and grapefruit dance around the nose. Flavors are more malt forward, with a strong hops presence on the tail end of the palate. Initial flavors are a subtle caramel malt, and then the green, fresh, and peppery hops attack the lateral tongue and the back of the throat with peppery spice and aromatic, floral, and resiny bitterness. Good flavor profiles. The aftertaste is bitter, with only a hint of the citrus sweet left behind to balance. Quick, slightly dry finish, leaving the palate with a slight astringency feel. Decent balance of flavors and an easily drinkable body and ABV make this a very sessionable IPA."
""

"O: Smelt great but nothing crazy for an IPA, Not a bad beer to have a couple of though."
""
""
""
"o I would choose other IPAs over this one. Nothing stood out but the citrus, which was too sour."
"Drinkability: Tasty and very refreshing. I do not think I have ever had a proper English IPA before, but I do like this version’s hybrid characteristics. It is mostly malty but offers adequate hop taste and bitterness."
""
"This beer poured out as a nice clear looking yellowish gold color with a white head on top. The smell of the beer is floral from all the hops in this beer. It smelled very refreshing to me. The taste of the beer is slightly sweet up front with a nice citrusy bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is a little on the heavier side which I liked a lot. There is a nice crisp carbonation to it. Overall I though this beer was very good, I would probably buy this in larger amounts if I ever come across it."

"Bottled 1/5/12. Pours a clear golden color with a medium-large off-white head that goes down slowly. Scent is nice and hoppy. Some nice citrus and pine notes. A little bit of malt, but not as much as I was expecting from a non-Cali IPA. Taste is initially a little floral with some floral hop flavors, immediately followed by bittering pine notes. Some nice lemon and grapefruit flavors, but very mellow. A very easy-drinking, user-friendly IPA. Finish is sweet and not as bitter as most IPAs. Mouthfeel is light and creamy. Drinkability is very high. Overall, not the best IPA, but a very good one. Highly drinkable, but not very memorable."
"Grabbed this because Goose Island is new to Maine and it's a little over a month old (bottled 3/3/12). I wonder if this would be better fresher but this seems to be falling short. It's enjoyable, just not what I'd hoped."

"On tap at Katie Mc's, Huntington, NY. I have to say hooray for Goose Island IPA. Bright golden color, well-carbonated. Pleasant floral aroma. I admire the hop character a great deal - herbal and aromatic, a little fruit (but not grapefruit), with the right amount of bitterness. Nicely malted with a nice dry mouthfeel. I normally only have one pint of an IPA; this was such a pleasure to drink I went for a second."

"O: This English IPA was decent, not great, but a good beer to keep around the house . Good for the english style, I guess, but it really didnt jump out at me as a premier example, or even in the top 25%. I'd drink this again, and i'd like to try it on tap to compare. I'd recomend to a beer geek friend."

"Pours a clear golden with a thin off-white head. Smells of mango and some peaches. Taste is a fruity, earthy hop blast up front, followed by a light cracker malt middle, and a dry, earthy, tart finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium carbonation. Overall an excellent beer."
""

"O - I was shocked to see this on the tap list; since they hadn't yet announced that they were coming to PA; I had to get one and boy was I happy I did. Awesome flavors and very drinkable, good stuff for sure."
"Overall again I gave it over six months and tried it again but I don't really like this one that much. Taste is pretty clean and balanced but something with the hops doesn't agree with me. Lucky me it's not around my area since I wouldn't be missing it much. Good IPA overall."

"At Garcia Brogans this one is a clear yellow amber color with a decent white head and nice lacing. The aroma is of solid citrus-floral hop prevailing over lemon bread ideas. Sweet and hoppy, quite nice. The flavor follows with biscuit grapefruit and sunshine grains. It offers lively carbonation in a medium-light bodied brew though the feel approaches a slightly syrupy idea with fairly thick papaya/pineapple/citrus combinations. This is really a very drinkable IPA and entirely enjoyable. The IPA lovers will clearly enjoy this bitter brew. A nice surprise for me."
"Overall a nice, simple and very drinkable IPA. Thanks goes to my little sister Emily for this one!"

"Goose Island's IPA pours a hazy golden deep amber with a 1 finger white head, decent lacing as well. The smell is hoppy but light, with some fruitiness in their. It's a dry bitter taste that I would expect, but overwhelming. It's pretty easy drinking and good IPA. Would I drink it again yes. Would it be my first choice, probably not, but overall a good IPA."

"Not my preferred styling of beer but enjoyable if a bit thin on the mouthfeel for such a bombastically big hitting taste."
"O: Very disappointed considering how awesome the nose was. Everything I've had from Goose Island has been awesome up until this."
"Overall, an excellent version of an English IPA. The English herbal hops really show along with some more citrus hops. There is a very good balance of malt and hops. I was shocked at how refreshing and tasty this was for a $7 six-pack. This could be a new go-too session beer for me."
"O - Much different than a American IPA, where you get that punch of hops, but the strong presence of hops is still present. Also, the hops have more of a spicy character. Very nice IPA."
"Overall an ale I think many would enjoy and one I'll look for again in the future."
"Overall - Pretty good, plenty of hops but certainly not a hop bomb. Not the most balanced beer, malts arent all that up front. Still soild, and worth a drink, just nothing world class or anything new to the style."
"More @ http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"Overall - This is a well made IPA. Nice job Goose Island."
"O: I didn't really expect much out of this beer, but it's good. I have a feeling that Goose Island will be available here soon and when it is, I'll be purchasing this again."
"O - this is solid. its the IPA I suggest to friends who are unsure about the style"
"A decent American-slanted English IPA, the stunted mouthfeel being the only thing holding it back from attaining a well rounded profile.  If my flight back home was any later, it would provide me with a dilemma - more of these, but at inflated airport lounge prices? Hard to say."
"Pours bright orange with thick, foamy white head. Lots of active carbonation. Citrus hop aroma and lots of it, with some floral and resinous notes as well. Faint caramel malt. Good citrus flavor with floral and planty notes. Very well balanced compared to many other IPAs, making this beer eminently drinkable."
"Overall Impression- I can tell this is one of their brews in the line up that aren't a specialty from Goose Island. Enjoyable, drinkable, but very light. Can't believe this is my first time having this! A bit light for my taste but I can see where this would attract those fans trying to get into new styles."
"O - Dare I say ""sessionable""?? I think this beer fits that characteristic quite well. It's relatively inexpensive, not too big, not too bitter, but offers an outstanding hop flavor profile."
"I have had this beer many times. I am not going to go through a formal review on this one. It is a very solid beer, nothing extraordinary about it. Easy drinking beer, good taste, very solid. I won't go out of my way to get it, but will drink it when it is available and there are not any better choices."
"D/O: Although it comes in at a svelt sub-6% abv, this beer is all IPA in the taste--and the taste is excellent. Its flavor profile is noteworthy from start to finish, coming completely unexpectedly after the lackluster smell. With apologies to Widmer, this is the best pseudo-craft IPA on the planet."
"O - Good English style IPA. Very light in body but good flavor."
"Overall it's a good and drinkable ipa. It just seems like it's missing something."
"Nothing special in my opinion."
"Definitely worth a try, and has all the makings for a very good sessions beer."
"this has to be the freshest batch of goose isl ipa i think ive ever had, first it didnt look amazing out of the glass which isnt anything new but boy when you get to the nose on this one its all citrus and floral and a light malt backbone, the taste is right on par with the nose and has a wonderful fresh hop taste with a good solid bitter, this is a stunning beer which hasnt happened ever before when ive drank one of these. the mouthfeel is a medium body with a good amount of carb that dances as you enjoy the sip. overall this is a steal for a 6er and its weird to rate what is an AB-INBEV beer so high but i guess you can thank greg hall."
"Overall: I barely found it to be bitter enough, but the recipe is uniquely spiced and quite balanced, so it's a nice jab at this style of beer. Sadly, as of this writing I have little to no experience in British IPAs, but this has definitely peaked my interest in trying more of them."
"Great beer! A total sessioner! I can see why people would drink it every weekend!"
"Overall: Great IPA. Recommended."
"Looks like a great beer from the start of the pour. Nice whitish creamy head that lasts big time. Lacing the glass, and still looking good. Swirl to make some more foam. Hop and malts blend to create an aroma of walking in a flower field, wait maybe the candle shop. Anyway, the flavor pretty much matches until you taste the malt presence. Kinda like a scotch character you get from barley whiskey. I feel that makes this beer taste I guess English. The use of the ""C" hops brings me back to the west coast style."
"Notes: Overall, this moderate to medium-bodied brew is one of the most balanced American takes on the English IPA style. Flavors are complex, yet subtle enough that they don't scar the palate. Quite tasty, and very easy to drink. This one is a winner!"
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle, served in a Sam Adams Boston Lager glass."
"For some reason I feel that there is something missing in the finish of this beer, but I could not tell you what. Overall a very decent and nice IPA."
"Also I can say... I'm glad the woman doesn't read these reviews."
"Very nice - the blend of malt and hoppy flavours is excellent. The hops distinguish themselves but are restrained by American standards, with an interesting spicy quality. Very drinkable, and great on a hot day. Recommended."
"This beer is well balanced and very drinkable. The bready malts are not too apparent like in some other English IPAs and the strong citrus flavors give this beer a unique twist on the style."
"Overall, the flavors and craft of this brew are good, and the balance between hops and malts is fair enough to allow both flavors to play on the tongue. However, I found myself wanting something extra from this beer, as the flavors, while good, are fairly standard for an IPA, and thus there's little in here to set this brew apart from many of its peers."
"a rather accented IPA hop quality. nose of a good grain base and honey undertones to pine. there is a subtle tropical fruit citrus. very subtle but it gives way to a somewhat smaller batch feel and more concentration on the hopping. palate of pine sap, hints of mango with a dominate orange skin astringent mineral note. pretty consistent and easy to drink."
"O – A well-balanced, highly drinkable English style IPA. This was a nice diversion from many of the hop bombs that I have been drinking lately. This offering could easily fall into the session beer category."
"O-Something I could drink regularly, very potent and great flavor."
"If you're looking for a citrus-y, dank American IPA, this isn't it. But as an English IPA, it's a real good one. Lots of English-style hop flavors and an easy one to drink."
"O - A very solid IPA and one I would have again."
"12 oz into a snifter...bright body, but not nearly so bright as some of the top West Coast IPAs. Decent head. Aroma has a good hoppy character, but not super intense. Taste has a good bitterness but not a tone of malt backbone and it's not nearly as hoppy as the standard-bearers of this style. Fairly smooth though. Mouthfeel is quite good. Nothing objectionable here. Overall, this is one of the better Midwest IPAs, but that's not saying it's in the top 5 of that category and not in the top 20 US IPAs either (or English, for that matter, since this is described as an English Style IPA, although the hop profile resembles many US IPAs). Usually a decent value here in Chi though, like 2/3 the price of many others, so it's recommended."
"Goose Island India Pale Ale pours a crystal clear light orange. There's initially about a finger of dirty white foam sitting atop the beer, but it doesn't show much either in the way of retention or lacing. The nose is classic grapefruit citrusy, with a solid background note of orange. All in all it lacks a little punch though. There's a brief bit of bready malt at the open of each sip, before a little bit of bitterness rolls through mid palate. The close features the anticipated grapefruit and orange notes, but there's also something else, a slightly unpleasant aftertaste that at first I couldn't put my finger on. It was only in reading some other reviews after the fact that I was able to hit on what it was, and that was a bizarre soapy note to the finish. The body provides a solid frame for the beer, yet remains relatively light. That, combined with a nice lively amount of carbonation, results in a fairly spot on mouthfeel for an IPA. Goose Island India Pale Ale comes off as a beer that pairs American hops with an English sensibility as far as hopping rates. That makes the beer an American IPA in my book (despite how it's listed here), and one that just doesn't have the requisite punch to it. Still a fairly enjoyable beer to drink though."
"EDIT: Ok, had this one again a year later and liked it a whole lot more (on draught). Appreciate the well balanced ENGLISH aspect of this beer; when first reviewed caught up in American hopbomb IPA craze and less able to appreciate this beer's lovely balance between hops and malt and the earthier, herbs and grass hop character. A nice change of pace and particularly lovely on tap."
"The alcohol is here but can barely be felt. While I like an English take on a style that's pretty popular here in the states, this left a bit to be desired. Goose Island has such popular beers and one has to wonder if the takeover by Busch has compromised the consistency of the product or not. For those looking for a mellow take on a strong style, this would be a great choice. As for me, I'm willing to give it another go on tap to see of the discrepancy between that and the bottled form is still present or not."
"The beer is good. It’s not great. You don’t expect it to be great. It’s just good. A beer that I would drink again and again. That, and I LOVE Goose Island… just the name, the logo, and the atmosphere I get when there."
"O: This beer is very easy to drink because the taste is very balanced; the relatively low alcohol content makes rather sessionable."
"O- This is a nice beer that I will be getting again, easy to drink and great for a hot day. Would definitely like to try it when it fresher."
"O: As my first taste of any Goose Island stuff (had in bars before, but never bottle), this is a good one. It's a really mild and easy drinking IPA offering. I would definitely drink again, but not a favorite. Good SUMMER IPA...for the heat."
"I'm not sure if it's the fact that this is an English IPA, or what, but I'm just not a big fan of this beer. I had high hopes for Goose Island, and so far I don't like their IPA, or 312 Urban Wheat. To me, this IPA seems to be a bit too ""full"" and not ""bright"" enough for me. Again, it could be the style, I don't know. I'm not a big fan of this IPA, but it wasn't bad."
"O: Not as unforgettable as the packaging would suggest, but not bad. Pleasing summer IPA that brings crisp fruitiness to the fold. I’ve had better from Goose Island and come to expect more."
"O - Not a go to beer for me, but a solid brew. It's well balanced and highly approachable - it would be great for those just getting into the style."
"Not really English, but the proto-typical American IPA. I wouldn't know there's Styrian Golding and Fuggles in there, since the Cascade and especially dry Centennial take over. Most brewpubs breweries do something similar these days, but it's interesting to see how it was back in '93. Simple and reliable. I hope Bud don't change it."
"O - Overall, pretty good on its own or as a session, with the 5.9% ABV not being too heavy."
"Another one of the varieties in my beerkraft order. Really surprised by this had no idea something worthwhile could come out of Chicago other than a Navy recruit. Right from popping the top I knew I was in for a treat. the piney aroma oozed forth and pushed itself upon my nostrils, thrusting its hoppy splendor against the wall of my senses. Pours a medium golden color with a decent head and the lacing starts almost immediately. It smells like a herb garden with the piney penetrating me easily.It tastes wonderful, light, hoppy, citrusy with some fruit/floral qualities. Mouthfeel is splendid. I could only hope for a splendid beer like this to assault my senses on a regular basis. Nice sessionable beer and overall a great American IPA not from the west coast. Cheers."
"Pours a nice dark orange color. White bubbly head. Decent carbonation streaming from the bottom. The smell is floral, citrus, malty, overall a very well balanced IPA aroma. Nothing overpowers the other aromas, which I like. The taste is great, starts off bitter, then smooths out to citrus and the malts. Medium body. Overall, this IPA is very well balanced, and I like it a lot. Another great offering from Goose Island."
"Overall a good solid IPA. I enjoyed it. Wouldn't mind picking up some more in the future."
"Poured a cloudy straw-yellow with a foamy white head that receded rather quickly. Piney hops in the nose. Similarly, piney hops in the taste with a citrus bite, and some smooth earthy hops in the background, for a pretty decent balance. Not overly bitter or hoppy, but a slightly sweet finish from the malts. Medium mouthfeel; a moderately drinkable selection."
"I am starting to realize that I do not like the everyday Goose Island lineup. Lemon zest hops strike me right away. Sort of like Dawn dish detergent it's so powerful. Either this is a bad one, or I am not the norm who likes this beer."
"D- Easily drinkable, and what you expect from an IPA, but it doesn't really pass that by much. After having mine, I thought that it may have faded a bit, but after seeing several other reviews, it doesn't seem like it would have been very potent fresh either."
"O- Pleasant. I would like to try this one down the road and compare to my notes today. I hope nothing is tampered with the recipe. This was generally a wonderful IPA. Highly drinkable. The stickyness of this IPA is wonderful. Also a creeper at 5.9%, if your not careful this one could sneak up on you."
"O-One of the more earthy beers I've had. SN Estate and Stone IPA come to mind as others. Not the sweetest version but earthy and a good example of an earthy IPA. Don't ruin this on InBev."
"Bottle. No date on this one that I could find. Poured into a New Belgium tulip style glass a clear, honey golden color with a slight off white head that has a pretty poor retention. The head does collar slightly around the glass. The aroma is a slightly skunky citrus note that like over ripe grapefruit and orange. Medium mouthfeel. Muted citrus flavors with a slight sweetness. Rather bland in flavor to be honest with a minimal hop presence. Even in the back end there is minimal flavors. Overall, this is a subpar APA that I would not consider buying anytime soon."
"D - Pretty nice, this is not an over the top IPA, but it is an easily quaffable beer and quite sessionable by American standards. The hop aroma is quite nice and while it pokes through the malt in the flavor profile, it is a bit more subdued than I would like. The malt manages to be thick and bready without becoming overwhelming and it finishes just dry enough to keep the beer drinkable."
"O - A nicely balanced, fruity, juicy beer. Fine session beer."
"Very restrained and balanced."
"Kind of neutral on this one. It's good, but perhaps a bit too similar to our typical regional brews for me."
"O- Solid IPA overall. Not the best I've had, but up there. Definitely my drink of choice at Citi Field."
"Overall: A very sessionable and well-balanced IPA. I could drink several of these in a setting without getting bored. Try it!"
"This was one of a sampler 12 pack bought in belvedere IL. Very reasonable priced. I think it is a great IPA best one i have had in a while. Very smooth with good drink ability. A very good mix of bittering and aroma hops. Great Job!"
"D - A nicely balanced brew, good blend of hops with the dry sense and a slight sweetness."
"O- Nothing special here. Fairly light overall."
"Drink- Overall, this is my 1st regular lineup beer from GI. A nice beer, malty, sweet."
"*Paired with a Chicago style hot dog and a dipped Italian beef sandwich."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy and it has nice flavor. It has a little more malty sweetness than I usually like, but it is a very nice IPA none the less. I would definitely pick this one up again."
"O - Refreshing beer that can be drunk by the six-pack without getting bored of the taste. In my opinion this is a great example of an India Pale Ale."
"Beers like Goose Island IPA and Magic Hat Blind Faith make me wish more American breweries would attempt to over-Americanize the English IPA style, because the results are great. Goose Island IPA isn't mind-blowing, but it is really good."
"D: I don't have a lot to say about Goose Island IPA, but I would drink again...and again. Recommended for a solid all-rounder; it might not be winning any awards (Wait, what's that? It did? Three silvers, a bronze, and a gold in the Great American Beer Festival and a 2010 gold in the World Beer Cup?) but it's a great beer nonetheless."
"I poured this 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It poured a cloudy pale golden color. It produced a think 3 1/2 finger think white foamy head. Excellent Head retention and excellent lacing. The aroma is is very much dominated by malt and bitter hops- slight notes of citrus. The taste is malty, piney and hops spring out in the front and during the finish. The finish is a bit dry with an almost ""oily"" taste- The beer is very smooth. Overall, a very good IPA."
"A highly drinkable beer that also has a nice flavor. Could easily be a staple beer for those that like IPA's but dont want anything that leaves a strong after taste."
"Overall: A really solid IPA all around. This is a nice break from the hop bombs and palate-wreckers that everyone is obsessed with brewing. Its an unpretentious, no-frills, damned drinkable IPA."
"D- A sound IPA all around. Balanced enough, but definitely hop-centric. The 6 pack won't last long, which I say is testament enough."
"Taste is more than medium bodied, one of the more thick IPA's I've ever tasted. Some good bitterness but doesn't really smack you in the mouth with hops. Pretty well balanced, tasty but not overpowering. Not the most spectacular IPA I've had but definitely above average and very drinkable."
"D - my new favorite IPA, Its one of the best, I mean the Alstöm gave it a solid B+, like most craft beers 6 pack is blenty"
"D: Very drinkable. Maybe not the best but certainly not the most ridiculously flamboyant IPA either. Good."
"Nice IPA on draught at the long gong Tailgators in Clinton Ma. I think the best they had on tap. Very nice on the nose and a very nice mouthfeel. Depending on which bartender was working would lat you know how good a pour you would get. It's a shame the Gator is gone, a great bar to sit at and have a coupla brews"
"OVERALL GRADE: C-/C"
"Drinkability: Slightly high ABV is well masked by flavors. The general well-roundedness of this brew make me want to come back to it again and again. Maybe this isn't the IPA for hopheads, but it's a very good beer all around and is a good introduction to the IPA style. Whether you're a fan of IPA style beers or not, this is worth a try. Drinkable, enjoyable, and easy to find. I could drink this with no problem through a session."
"Mouthfeel is heavy, and definitely not light nor watery. This is a delicious IPA!"
"D - Just ok flavor and body."
"D: Drinkable just notthing special"
"D: Not what I'm really accustomed to with the American IPA being my weapon of choice for the broader style. Not awful, though."
"Drinkability -- The more I consumed of this beer, the more I enjoyed it. There is so much to love: subtle and well-rounded, both quenching and engaging, plus the mouthfeel is impeccable. I feel foolish for not having tried this sooner. This is a beer even your Corona-drinking Dad can rally 'round."
"M and D - Thin body, moderate carbonation, nice balancing act of resin and dryness on the palate. Very easy to drink, one of my go-to session beers."
"Very good brew. Very smooth and drinkable but lacked a little in the flavor department for me. There are better IPA's out there though. The plus of this one is that it's a bit closer to sessionable than some others. Good beer Goose Island."
"Pours a hazy orange with 1 finger of sticky, tight white head, good lace on the glass. Smells of citrus, hops, grapefruit, lemon and a pretty strong maltiness. Taste is of crisp citrus, hop bitterness, grapefruit and dry malt. Nice medium mouthfeel, served at a perfect temp. creamy and very solid. Drinks very well, solid IPA would gladly revisit."
"(this ale was bottled Dec 2010, by the way)"
"D: Not too heavy, and the tastes are unique but not tiresome. I could see myself going through a few of these."
"Out of a bottle this brew was a cloudy, light-apricot color with one finger of off-white foam. The retention was decent as a small collar and it left consistent spots. The aroma was of spicy, noble hops, grapefruit zest, hoppy resins and light mustiness. The flavors were on-point; it was full and inviting with an enjoyable, lingering finish. The flavors were built around a crystal malt backbone augmented by some Caramel/Caramunich malt. The hop profile was juicy, rich, spicy and noble-hop-heavy. Not as musty as the aroma and pleasantly so. The mouthfeel was quite good, the body med/full and the carbonation appropriate."
"drinkability - overall a good beer, didnt find the pine flavour too dominant as in other IPA's. Would stock for future tastings and sharing."
"Overall: A decent IPA, especially for those who aren't huge fans of IPAs in general. Hopheads will be left looking for more, which is the boat I'm in (did not know I was getting an English IPA from an American brewery). A good beer to experience nonetheless."
"The color is typical of an IPA, golden/straw, very clear with a bright amount of good carbonation. Aroma is quite hoppy, with both citrus and pine notes. The flavor has great bitterness but you can also taste the floweriness of the flavoring hops. Overall,this is one of the most drinkable beers in a category that I find to also be the most drinkable. I'm glad to see that it's as available in New York as it is."
"A little crisp up front and a little leathery in the middle. Finishes dry and leaves my mouth wanting more. Not too bad of the English IPA style!"
"Drinkability: Decently drinkable but not very sought after by my taste buds."
"Another Goose Island beer that surprised me. Very solid beer, that I would recommend to someone who hasn't had experience with ipa's. Easy to find, solid, cost efficient beer."
"Mouthfeel was alright. Perhaps a little more carbonated than an IPA should be. Drinkability is good. Goose Island IPA is a solid, but unspectacular representation of the style."
"On a business trip to Southern Minnesota I was able to get a 6 pack of Goose Island IPA to get me through the week. With no fridge in my hotel room, I had to put a Goose Island on ice before dinner to have a cold brew to end the day. The days ended well! With a thick head and inspiring aroma, the Goose Island looked good even in a plastic cup. Flavorful hops stand out on top of a luxurious malt base. Very smooth drinking and a nice finish round out an IPA that is much better than average. Recommended if you like IPAs."
"Beer pours out a slightly hazy orangish yellow color with some decent lacing.The smell is actually quite present, I was under the impression that they brew mostly with pelletized hops but fortunately this beer has some nice citric whiffs that pop, and some slightly ""candy"" smells that reminds me of FFF. Weird! Anyway, I think this beer has changed over the years for the better. It starts off quite bitter, dry and hoppy, with a touch of malt sweetness to add some balance, very citric, lemony, and fruity. The mouthfeel is a tad on the watery side. What do you expect this is a Goose Island beer! We live next to Lake Michigan! Overall this is a fine beer and I feel happy to have some in my stash."
"Goose IPA pours cloudy yellow with 1 1/2 fingers of head that hangs around to the end. The nice head allows for a bold, sour citrus smell that punches you in the nose...maybe some pineapple or grapefruit in there as well. The taste is very bitter up front, not dissimilar to a grapefruit, with a lot of hop presence to follow. This is a good IPA, but I think I like the smell even better than the taste, not as a criticism to the taste. This beer is also very crisp and refreshing, drawing a connection to the Honker's. This is definitely very bitter rather than the expected sweet, it just depends on what you are after for that particular session. I'd have another...and another. My partiality usually lies with American IPA varieties, I'm bending the rules here."
"Serving type: bottle poured into a pint glass."
"On tap poured into pint glass at Goose Island in Wrigleyville summer of 2009. Pours dark gold with a thick white frothy head. Aroma is herbal hop and grapefruit citrus. Flavour is good hop bitterness, some pale malt showing through and a bit of a thinning out towards the finish, though a nice lingering dry-ish bitterness. Very drinkable."
"If these ratings were based on Value... they would be a lot higher. I got these for less than $1.40/beer and I have spent a LOT more for beers that were not as good as Goose Island India Pale Ale."
"Drink - The beer seems just a little bit unbalanced but it still very tasty. There are more malty notes than fruity ones. I'm happy I tried it and it's worth seeking out."
"Overall, I'm very unimpressed. Usually Goose Island comes out with more quality stuff. Look else where for a good IPA."
"D: This one was okay to me. I don't think I would ever get it again. The hop flavors were all over the place and almost too bitter. Not very well balanced in my honest opinion."
"D - I like this beer, but I usually look for a more powerful citrus flavor in my IPA's, but I did enjoy a few of these in a sitting."
"The M&D of this brew is also great. Feels full and nice as it goes down. I like the way goose island has made this beer to be so drinkable but be flavorful."
"D- A very mild interpretation of the style but solid none the less."
"overall, another great brew from goose island. an ipa done the way it should be done. ive also heard that goose island is barack obama's favorite for what its worth. (i dont wanna turn conservatives off) haha."
"Very light and carbonated. The bitterness is balanced great with the body making very drinkable."
"D - Not at all surprised that this beer is the gold standard for English Style IPA at most contests. Fantastic, expressive English Hop characteristics, with enough balance to actually pair with food (threw some slow-roasted pork loin with cracked pepper at it earlier, worked like a charm). This is a beer that will always be welcome in my house."
"D/M: smooth on the pallet, great taste, slight carbonation tingle, slight driness on the pallet"
"D - easy going; session-able but would like to have a little more complexity"
"I actually missed this somehow while I was in Chicago in May, but Penn Station in New York to the rescue! Nice 32 ounce pour for like $6 or something at the pizza place near the Long Island Railroad. Pours a golden orange colour with a finger of head. Almost no lacing, but really nice head retention. Smells of citrus hops with a very bready malt. Medium bitterness level for an IPA. Quite a high carbonation, which could be toned down a bit to make the mouthfeel nicer. Nice beer though."
"Very drinkable IPA. I will definitely be stocking up on more of this brew."
"Been wanting to try this one for a while and finally got my chance while in NY for the holidays. Pours a hazy, bright, golden/orange with a slightly off-white head. Average sized, foamy head that leaves some nice lacing when it goes. Scent is hoppy with a nice spicy character to it. Taste is floral hops with some honey tones and a nice biscuit malt backbone. Good but not my kind of IPA. Not a bad beer but couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed, that's my fault thought, think I hyped this a bit too much in my head."
"The taste had a dry finish and just the right amount of bitterness. Enough to give it that distinct IPA feel, but not so much that I can't drink more. I finished a 6 pack rather quickly. I was very impressed with this beer."
"I look forward to finishing off a bunch of these tonight. And that's what this brew is good for. It won't insult your pallet."
"Drinkability: A good IPA, very well balanced, though it does seem a bit hoppier than other English IPAs I have had (not overly so, however). A solid beer I would be happy to drink again."
"D - Big fan of this beer. I could see myself getting this one again many times over. Quality. Very sessionable, too. And surprisingly cheap."
"d 3-3.5 even though i like a ""balanced"" ipa, this one is too far tilted toward the malt and desperately needs more cones."
"Reviewed on 3/10/2010. Growler from Big Z Beverage. Pours a clear orange with a thick, fluffy white head. Aroma of citrus, rich hop oils, tropical fruits, grapefruit, and melon rind. Flavor of plenty of citrusy hops, rich caramel malt, grassy and garlicky hops. Very tasty, superbly drinkable. This one surprised me since I never really heard anyone mention it as a top IPA, but I found it to be quite good."
"D/O- This Goose Island offering would do wonders on a summer day. Have had this beer many times in the past few years...I believe it to be underrated for the style."
"D- Nice drinking IPA. The hop oils keep your mouth tasting fresh between sips and after finishing a glass. This beer is much better when extremely fresh. I really noticed the lack of aroma compared to GI IPA I've had in the past."
"All-in-all, a good IPA, but let's be honest, it's pretty average. Nothing really seems to stand put about it, however, that's not to say it isn't worthy of drinking. It's a good beer and I enjoyed drinking it. "
"Overall/notes: It's pretty obvious that it's an English IPA. A much maltier character than its American counterparts. It's a really decent beer, good for small gatherings and whatnot. This is one of those brews that you don't drink because you want the end-all, be-all of beers, but because hey! You like it. Nice work."
"The taste starts with carbonation on the tongue a sweet pale malt enters. the carbonation fills the mouth and cuts the sweet malt to show a earthy hoppyness it is pungent but finishes with a smooth bitterness."
"A Chicago beer from a Chicago glass. Good times. It pours a lightly hazed golden straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises ruby red grapefruit, pine, and some nicely sweet caramel. The taste brings more of the same, though the caramel is lightened a bit and a touch of mint is added. The body is a hefty-ish light, with a light moderate carbonation and a velvety feel. Overall, a very nice IPA, one of the better beers I've yet had from GI."
"I'm glad I saw that this is an English IPA before I took a drink, or else I'd have been seriously concerned that it wasn't a very bitter IPA. Now I see why. Upfront, there's a decent dose of pine and spicy hops that hit right away, fading into some bready, toasty malt that finish off the body. Finishes with a tight snap of hops with a faint lingering of toasted grain afterwards. A very good English IPA, which I will admit I typically enjoy more than American IPA's."
"D: friendly beer, but not my first choice. However it kind of grows on you."
"D: Sessionable, but doesn't stand out for the style. Perhaps GI is going for the sessionable route here."
"Thanks, but I'll pass.."
"D: I may return to this beer if I ever find myself in one of the Goose Island brewpubs, but I wouldn't choose to crack open a 2nd one right now if I had other options."
"Pale orange with a bubbly body which results in a decent sized tan head which doesn't fade as much as it sinks in the middle, which leaves a thick and short lacing behind. Oily hops at the nose initially with some malt, some orange peel and very faint citrus in the back. First pull reveals a very smooth drinking IPA with a pleasant hit of citrus and light fruits followed by a balancing hop bitterness and a malty, somewhat creamy core. Light to medium bodied and crisp when all is said and done. Not a hop bomb, just a well made IPA that hits the spot at this particular moment."
"I would not turn one down if a host offered me one but it is not a beer I would buy for myself and keep in the fridge. But what the hell do I know?"
"Interesting flavor, worth a taste."
"As a note, this beer is almost 4 months old. The beer pours a hazy golden orange with a coarse white head that leaves some lacing but not too much. The aroma is good, but not great, I blame the age. There is some bitterness to it, but it seems muddled. Though oddly I didn't expect to taste oak, yet I do. It feels good to me on the palate, and is pretty easy to drink. I would like to try a fresher one and re-review."
"Overall, this is a good IPA. What throws me off with it is the barley finish. I'm not fond of when my IPA takes on this persona. I'd recommend this to the IPA drinkers out there, as its definitely something good to try."
"The nose flows straight into the taste which is just a bit hoppy and bitter over a fairly complex malt base. As much as I love my C-hops, occasionally somethig like this just really hits the spot. Great feel and drinkability; this is a real winner."
"D-- Good solid summer beer. For the boldness of it, it is very drinkable. Well hidden ABV and very tasty beer. Good example of an EIPA"
"All in all, this is definitely a solid, easily accessible, session beer. This seems like it would be great to sip on a summer afternoon to cool down your taste buds. Worth a try if you have the chance and like IPA's."
"Drinkability is ok, not my favorite style, but I guess this is a reasonable enough example."
"This beer pours with a huge fluffy white head. It is clear light golden amber. The smell is sweet malt, and a bit of caramel. there is also some nice floral hops, kind of subdued even for an english ipa. Taste is mostly malt, some sweetness, and nice floral hops, with some citrus in the background. There is a nice bitterness as well, but this beer is very balanced. Mouthfeel a little thick, i would like it a bit drier, but its good."
"I poured into a pint glass to two inches of off white head. This brew is gold in color. The aroma is mild citrus hops. The taste begins citrusy and finishes with a dull bitter taste. I like the fact that this is mild. It is very easy to drink and I don't get ""bittered"" out after a few. I've used this as a go to beer before."
"As the beer warmed up, the hops tasted fresher. I definitely shouldn't have opened this right out of the fridge. This IPA stands out as a great light-bodied session beer."
"D - Great session IPA. One of the best in that category. Quite easy to drink."
"D - Very drinkable - I'd session this for sure."
"D: A solid all-around session IPA -- still wish I had tried Sofie instead as this is solid but a bit unspectacular."
"Dark gold with an impressive head and lace, grapefruit and floral hops in the nose and on the palate, with maybe a touch of pineapple or tropical hop juice. Very fresh tasting and zesty, it's a full-bodied but very smooth beer--nothing out-of-this-world, but no points of contention. A great beer to have around."
"Now, that being said, I really do like this beer. The hops are clear and crisp, allowing for a good drinkable beer. I just would like to see a more clear point to this beer and a direction."
"Overall, fairly forgettable. I've liked other Goose Island beers but I really didn't care for this one very much. I wouldn't bother if there's something else on tap."
"D: Not bad. IPAs aren't my favorite style, and this isn't an ass-kicking example of either the top American or English styles, but it's certainly palatable, and in the dollar-a-bottle range, I'm happy to put one back. I like the more toned down examples of IPAs, frankly, but this isn't as good as their Green Line, which I wish they'd bottle."
"On tap at the BIG E in the shock top booth! Yeah I was as confused as you are.. Nice above average ipa. That fresh hoppy citrus kick to it. Nothing blowing my mind here but very glad I got to try it on tap. My first beer from the brewery and I am impressed. Still have to try the 08 and 09 bourbon country stouts and the BCBCS in my beer fridge."
"D- very drinkable great session hoppy IPA"
"Shame about the malt."
"I certainly enjoy other IPA's more, but from a rating perspective well Goose Island has just done an amazing job making this brew."
"D - totally solid example of the style"
"Pours a 2"" head which settles down to lace in minutes. Color is interesting - kind of bronze yellow - almost but not completely clear. Smell and taste are classic IPA and it delivers enough hops for hopheads but not too much that the mere mortals can't enjoy it. In fact that's the only drawback - Ive had crisper and bolder IPAs. Still, it's a fine brew."
"D - Goes down very well without being slammed by a wall of alcohol."
"Not bad. Another good beer from Goose Island."
"D - I can drink this pretty much anytime I want a beer. have not had a food yet I don't enjoy it with (cheap, very spicy tacos seem to pair the best). undying love and loyalty to this, as well as Goose Island's Honker's Ale. top notch"
"Drinkability is high, between this and various other great GI beers, I'm quite happy with Goose Island and always plan to buy more of their beer in the future. It's reasonably priced as well, which is a nice perk, but I'd rate the drinkability just as high either way."
"Absolutely"
"Notes: Not the classic one would expect. It's worth the try, and worth grabbing at a bar, but it lacks a richer hoppy sense that makes me long for other IPAs ahead of this one."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability is pretty good, it's a pretty nice hoppy and easy drinking beer. It had some nice hop flavors but also had a decent malt base to it. Pretty good overall."
"I've been pretty lucky with all the American craft beer IPAs I've tried recently and this one was no different. A nice thick rocky head was maintained by a surging attack of thin beading. Quite distinctive with a juicy slightly sweetish bitterness which gives an almost gingery peppery quality to it. Could easily get goosed on this if I had more. Quality from start to finish. And to think that this is just a middling quality IPA among other a host of other more seemingly better versions."
"Drinkability: Even though it's 12:30 am on a wednesday, I want another beer! Although I can't say I'd order the same one if given a choice. If nothing else looks good, I'd take another."
"Poured a cloudy golden color into a pint glass, with a clean, white, persistent head. Pleasant citrus and floral aromas carried over to the taste, which was primarily bitter hops and citrus. This is not a particularly complex IPA, and one that definitely falls on the dry side of the spectrum. That said, it is very drinkable and, given the reasonable ABV, one that is a nice break from some of the more overwrought beers in this style. I would recommend it as a good compromise IPA, and one that would work well as a session beer."
"pretty easy drinking though a little too bitter to be one to just sit there and pound for me."
"Goose Island is an IPA that is not over-the-top with bitterness. An easy drinking IPA."
"D- Ehh just ok. Fills me up more than you would want from this offering."
"Wow - didn't realize how long I have been enjoing this beer until I noted that my earlier review was way back when it was called ""Smooth India Pale Ale"" and the label was pinstriped. Goose Island IPA is readily available in my neck of the woods, and, like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, is a reliable go-to beer for a hops-fix. Nothing flashy, but this beer hits all the points for the style, although perhaps a touch more hops and a bit less malt than the classic English style. Nice body, easy to drink with just a bit of a bite at the finish."
"D: Yes I would gladly drink another. They are tasty and pleasing."
"Strong Hoppiness on nose. Assertive bitterness on tongue with lingering sweetness behind, which causes it to lose a bit of the refreshing character which reflects the best IPAs. A nice effort, but seems a bit manipulated; everything is in the right place, but it seems almost contrived."
"D: Goes down easily, nicely blended, mild kick, good representation of style. This is an IPA that is pretty true to style that is worth sitting with for a while!"
"could easily drink a few of these. a very solid example of the style and definitely recommended."
"D: Great, the same price as Bud light at this show, is there even a question. Having 4 glasses and still craving more, due to the lingering taste and overall great beer, I would say this goes down easy and is a good tasting beer."
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side. Drinkability is high."
"Drinkability: On a patio on a perfect summer evening, it was the perfect beer. Very good."
"Pours a clear golden color with a nice sized frothy white head. The head sticks around all the way to to end and leaves nice lacing all around the glass. The smell right off reminds me of a lot of Goose Island brews I've had before with a lot more hoppy kick. Theres also some citrus aromas and it's a little floral. The taste is hoppy, citrusy, a tad bit malty. In the background there is a hint of pine as well which is more apparent as the beer warms up. As it warms up there becomes a small grapefruit taste too. Overall the taste is bitter but finishes smooth. Pretty good. Mouthfeel is nothing out of the ordinary for an IPA definitely not lacking. At a little less than 6% ABV and a great taste this is a really drinkable beer. This IPA isn't a hop bomb or anything but it's refreshing. I love to pick up some up when I can and I think it's great on tap. Overall another solid brew from Goose Island."
"D: Solid if perhaps simple IPA. Not groundbreaking or anything, but a very enjoyable Midwest IPA. Very Sessionable."
"tastes good though. I like this beer. pretty good American IPA."
"As and English IPA it does the trick, though I tend to prefer the hoppier American varieties, but I can't criticize them for doing what they set out to do."
"12oz. bottle served at 48 degrees in my SA Perfect Pint. Bottled on 04/07/10 indicated on the label. Poured a light, translucent copper with a half inch, loose, bright white head that settles into a solid skim. Thick swaths of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose reveals some citrus hops, and an earthy/bready character. Taste follows nose - some caramel notes also come out in the flavor profile behind the biscuity character in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light, with the perfect amount of carbonation. Very solid English IPA. Perfect balance and very drinkable."
"D: If i had a gripe it would be the beer is a tad sweet, another 10-15Ibu would make this a great american IPA, otherwise its really more of a well hopped american pale ale that could be a tad drier. Good beer though, no problem drinking a couple. Well crafted and worth a try."
"Butter in my IPA! Why!?"
"Drinkability - Easily drinkable. Reminds me of the freshness of spring. Love the bitterness of this beer and the smell was possibly the best aspect, in my opinion. This beer is perfect for the warm spring and summer days."
"Overall: More refined than Honker's Ale, so this beer is definitely a slight upgrade in my opinion. World class in my opinion."
"D- I could drink this beer all the time, it is my favorite IPA, and will probably be in till I find an IPA that surpasses the Goose Island IPA, so thanks to my Chi town fellows that brew such a better wonderful IPA!"
"M/D: Super drinkable, my new go to session ipa at 8.00 a sixer."
"The Goose did not disapoint! Great fresh offering. Nothing too flashy, but doesn't advertise as such. Great offering to have on hand."
"Pours a clear, golden color. One inch head of a white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hop oils, floral hops, slight sweet malt, and slight citrus. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is slightly smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of floral hop, hop oils, sweet malt, slight citrus, and a hint of roasted malt. Overall, the hops almost mask other intrinsic IPA flavors."
"D- Smooth and well-balanced, high drinkability"
"It was a pretty good IPA that had a little more taste and character to it than traditional hop bomb IPAs. It would probably go well with a burger or on a hot summer afternoon on the porch. I'm not sure if this is one that will stick in my memory to go seek it out, but if I'm in a bar and it's between this and traditional bar alternatives, I'd go for this one."
"The taste is a bit off. The hops don't hit the mark where they should and the odd fruity flavors do not complement the hop flavors. There is some leafy bittering hop towards the finish but it just doesn't sit well with that fruity mid section. There is a drying, almost saltene, flavor towards the finish that has some similarities to the Honker's Ale from Goose Island that I just had. This isn't a bad IPA but I was expecting better. The saltene end notes work better in the Honker's Ale than they do in this beer. The mouthfeel is about right, neither smooth and creamy nor prickly and husky. It splits the difference nicely. The beer is plenty carbonated."
"D - This would be good on a warm afternoon after going to a Cubs game."
"An enjoyable, serviceable, sessionable IPA.... it's nothing special, but is enjoyable enough, and the low 5.9% abv. is something to appreciate."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, this beer's only downfall. This is my favorite kind of IPA, tons of hop flavor and aroma without overwhelming bitterness. I could enjoy a few of these."
"D-Easy to enjoy, smooth & enjoyable. This one really hit the spot the day that I purchased it. Delicious."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy amber color. Nose is light grapefruit hops. Flavor is grapefruit hops with a lingering bitter aftertaste. Malts stay hidden. $1.95 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"I wasn't too excited to try this beer after reading some of the reviews, but when I went to the liquor store there was a little star-rating tag in front of the beer and I couldn't resist. I was suprised at how similar it tasted to Dogfish 60 Minute! It poured ok.. a decent body with a small half-inch head. Was a lot more clear than I would expect for this style, and the taste reflected that. It was a little on the watery side. I'd have this beer again, but it wasn't my favorite for this style - not even close."
"This is a decent IPA, but not one I would chase again. Not sure I enjoy the dry nature of it."
"D: This was smooth sailing for the IPA lover in me and the non-IPA drinker in my Gal..."
"Mouthfeel was not too thick or thin. This had plenty of carbonation. An ok ale if you just want to drink one or two brews with a lot of flavor. I don't think I would want any more than two at the most. Of the 4 varieties in the Goose Island mix pack this ale was alright but would be my least favorite."
"On-tap. Pours a hazy deeper gold. Decent off-white head with not a whole lot of retention. Really couldn't spot a whole lot of visual difference from my friend's Coors Light, except for a bigger head. Smell is fresh, high-tipped sweetgrass. Very clean, love the fresh hop scent. Taste is maltier, with a light, raw sugar-like base that is very nice. Hops almost act as support, although you get a big, spiced, even mouthfeel all around. Big citrus flavor. Very good."
"M/D: Very frothy, thicker body, especially for an IPA. Nice delicate carbonation. I'm only good for a few of these, can't get over the odd, faint soapy flavor."
"Overall, I was disappointed. My father had ordered a 312 at my suggestion that night, which put me in the mood for a Goose Island for my second beer, but as mentioned in taste, it was just too spicy. It was more than just a hoppy floral flavor. I think I may try this beer again in the fall or winter when in the mood for an IPA, as I feel it may please my senses more in that time of year. I just can't really say that I reccomend this to anyone or am looking forward to having it every again..."
"Drinkability: Very good. Simple yet nice and piney. I sort of see this as a comperable and cheaper version of some of the west coast pine ipas that I like. The hops are not overpowering. A good brew."
"Overall, this is a nice session beer but nowhere close to being a world-class IPA."
"I could easily have a few of these, in fact I wish I had more. Every aspect of this IPA can be identified yet no characteristic overwhelms. Love it!"
"D - Excellent. Can easily do a few of these. 4.5"
"D=A ""gateway"" pale ale, in which aficionados will find nothing to reproach, but little to muster their enthusiasm. A wonderful beer, but not a wonderful IPA, for better or worse."
"One of my new favorites from Goose Island. Bottled on 2-2-10. Having hot dogs with macaroni and cheese with fresh grated parmesan cheese for dinner and this beer pairs perfectly. A - great looking beer with 3 inch head in my Duvel tulip. S - not very hoppy, more earthy which fits the english ipa style. T - very refreshing after an afternoon of running errands. M - frothy goodness. D - could easily session these."
"Pleasantly drinkable, flavorful, and not harsh. I would definitely buy it again."
"Drinkability - A wonderful drink. I'm looking forward to the rest of the pack when I get back to the States. WDA (would drink again)."
"And no doubt, refreshing while almost heat-stroked while rushing through my irish bacon. not bad at all."
"Excellent blend of malt and hop on the initial sip. The swallow and aftertaste are all bitter hop. Full bodied without being too rich. It's a classic example of the Brit IPA genre."
"drinkability - its been many months since i last had a GI IPA so i was very suprised to be enjoying it this much"
"This is my first beer from Goose Island."
"Drinkability- This is one of the most drinkable IPAs I have come across. It is not a hop bomb or big IPA but it is very drinkable none the less. This would be a good beer to bring someone into the craft world. If you know someone who is new to craft this is a great initiation beer. It gives them a proper introduction to the IPA without destroying their tongue the first time out. It's medium body and carbonation make this a very smooth and refreshing beer that is easy on the pallete and wallet. I think this was my favorite offering out of this pack."
"D: Decent IPA, could use more hops for my liking but overall a good beer."
"F: It get more bitter as it finishes but never really gets very bitter. Some earthy spicy hop flavors linger a bit, with that pale flavor. It actually finishes very clean too. Overall a pretty nice balanced IPA, doesn't seem very English style, but has some parts of it, perhaps more of a marriage of English and American basic IPA."
"M/D: Nicely carbonated, despite the lack of head, I am a bit surprised by the texture of this beer. It is very enjoyable, as the viscosity of this beer is right on point. Definitely happy that I picked it up, Goose Island India Pale Ale does not disappoint."
"D- Fairly high, really liked it. Glad it's finally in stores in MA, I bought a single and will be buying more of these for sure. Thank you, Goose Island for a tasty beer and for *dating* your hop-sensitive products!"
"pours a pretty clear orange color with a nice frothy, white head that retains very well. smells of resiny hops, citrus, pine, ruby red grapefruit, some tropical fruit notes. Taste is very balanced but full of different layers of hop flavors which im sure the freshness has to do with. Pine, resin, citrus, grapefruit, backed by a sweet malt presence. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation, semi dry finish. Quite drinkable, even better burps."
"D: Very drinkable and all around great beer."
"Notes: Pretty balanced hoppy beer. Not an amazing beer, but a good beer for a hop centered beer but not a really bitter or heavily hopped beer."
"This is a very tasty, easy to drink beer. It's very hoppy but not overly bitter. I could definitely drink a few of these at one sitting, however all the hops will probably tire out my palate after the first beer. I'd pair this with strong flavored food like spicy thai, bbq or a strong cheese (e.g. stilton)."
"Pours a nice golden orange, very littel head that quickly fades. Aroma is pine and a little grapefruit. Taste is nice a simple. Nothing overwhelming or oustanding. Just notes of grapefruit and pine. Not a very hoppy IPA, and nothing that makes you go wow. Its a great session IPA, as its easy to drink and doesn't leave you with that over hopped mouthfeel. An ok example, but there are much better out there."
"Libation: This is a solid, crisp, smooth IPA. That said, it's a bit to smooth and simple. I like all the flavors here, but I'd prefer a bit more of a hop forward profile. It's very drinkable and smooth, but the story here is that there just isn't enough 'umph'. It's quite good, but in my opinion some minor adjustments could make this much better."
"I knew that I was going to like this brew after enyoying a sixer from DeCicco's in ardsley. thats when i decided to put a half keg in my beverage-air kegerator. much better then the bottle maybe because it was kegged 10 days before I tapped it! I called the brewery to confirm the date on the keg, what they called the born on date. the floral hop aroma was music to my nose! thick creamy head,resiny, with nice sticky lace...need to say more...i dont think so...this is really good stuff and will be a favorite here back again...yum!!!"
"Not my favorite IPA, but a decent one. Next time I try this I'll try a fresher bottle (this one was too old - bottled 6/23/09...yikes)."
"This is a crisp brew with a smooth medium to full body and light carbonation."
"Overall- not to shabby of an ipa. no stone or a two hearted but a good stepping stone into those heartier ones."
"The feel of this beer is light but does have a slight sting of hops flavor as it first goes down. It is pretty easy drinking and does not have a hard aftertaste. A really nice brew."
"D: A solid IPA that definitely meets GI's more mainstream status. This was quite likeable and I'm sure pretty easy to find in the Chicago area, making it a solid choice. Try it if you come across it, but don't go out of your way for it."
"D: incredibly drinkable and is hoped spot on to the style that is trying to be copied. awesome brew from goose island, smooth and relaxing. would drink again and again."
"D - A good solid beer and quite drinkable. Not among my favorite IPAs, but a very approachable brew."
"Pours a opaque yellow-amber color that reminds me of passion fruit. Head was thin and white, but pretty stable throughout the entirety of the drink. Smells of citrus fruits and some hops. The taste had less fruity overtones and more floral hops and spices, although there was a slight citrus bit to it. Decent amount of carbonation and kick. As my first IPA, I was definitely impressed and will look forward to trying others."
" ~ I recommend this beer to my friends. This is certainly worth a try. I'm not sure what the cost is for a brew like this but I would hope its not more than $3.00/pint."
"Cheers!"
"D - Quite enjoyable... Definitive proof that IPAs can be subtle yet effective... A terrific job by the folks at Goose Island... I love the simplicity of this one..."
"D- This is a lovely IPA. This is a lighter IPA, not a 'big"" IPA like Furious or Two Hearted. This is a totally sessionable, good tasting IPA. If it were summer time I'd buy this in 12 packs to drink on the patio. Good stuff."
"Overall, this getting a B+ overall seems a little high. I have had much better IPAs then this and this just doesn't seem to compare at all. It is very malty and doesn't pack a nice hop punch like it should."
"Good six pack in a night IPA. Overall - Good. However the finished bottle left me wanting to find a stronger, better taste than this IPA provided."
"D. A pretty good standby IPA in my book. Nothing amazing, but it is good and consistent. a good session beer."
"D - Very good. I could easily have several of these."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into Frosty Freezer mug. Wonderful citrus aroma! Smells of FRESH whole hops! Nice 1/2"" white foamy head, good lacing down to the last drop. Carbonation just right for a warm day on the deck and a snappy, dry finish! For me the finish is one of the most important aspects of a great ale, it leaves me wanting that next sip! I love this brew!"
"A good American-style IPA is to new-age brewers what a béchamel sauce is to classic French chefs, it is the most basic of recipes and arguably the most important as well. Without it, you're nothing. Not surprisingly Goose Island, a great American brewery, has a great IPA - who would have thunk it? You won't go wrong picking this one up. Trust me."
"More pale and thin looking than most IPA's i've come across. Understated hoppy citrus smell. Pine and sweet grassy floral notes come out. I love the taste of this beer. Very crisp, sahara desert dry finish. Not as strongly hopped as other varieties, but plenty of grapefruit hoppy bitterness. Evidently this is an English IPA. I guess I like English IPA's. I could say it tastes like citrus, pine, rasins or whatever to describe the flavor. At the end of the day, it tastes like really good beer. Not as thick and intense on the mouth which makes for a smoother, more drinkable expiriance. This screams out for something really spicy to pair with it. I like it, it's good."
"Mouthfeel, these are more apt to struggle down the stretch, losing the hop and bitter edge, malt begins takeover, but it remains a drinkable beer, because you start back fresh for the first half of the pint. I think those beers that struggle down the stretch may just be the rare blended batch."
"D - this is a delicious ipa that tastes very good and isn't over powering worth a try sometime"
"It has a nice bittering spiciness with a sweet touch that finishes with a dry spiciness. A very nice IPA!"
"this beer pours a nice pale golden color with an off white head that recedes to a thin layer of lace that sticks around for the majority of the session. the aroma is really nice, a good amount of sweet malt aroma to back up the pronounced clean citrus hop profile. the taste follows suit with a nice biscuit sweet malt profile balanced nicely by the hops at the end. the medium mouthfeel and good co2 make this a really good ipa."
"D - went down quite nicely with the second half of my amazing meal. a very solid IPA."
"Note: I'm reviewing this with a bit of a cold, so my senses of taste and smell are a bit blocked."
"The beer pours a hazy dark golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a pretty standard IPA aroma; pale and Carapils malts along with loads of citrus hops. The taste is good. It has a smooth pale malt flavor with a really nice bitter hop bite. There is a good amount of body here which only enhances the drinkability. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine example of an American IPA. It says English style on the description, but I'm tasting a nice West Coast IPA here."
"Overall, this is a very nice, low-key IPA. I'm not a huge supporter of the EIPA (because hops are the nectar of the gods and are not to be found in EIPA's), but this is a nice, mellow brew. Nothing standout, but a solid brew nonetheless."
"Overall, drinkability is excellent; perhaps a sessionable IPA. The bitter finish is assertive and resinous but not overpowering and reminds of Bridgeport IPA."
"A good session IPA, very good hop flavor. Not overpowering on the alpha acid, but still very present."
"A nice IPA, with character. Perhaps on the sweeter end for my tastes - I prefer the riproaringly hoppy or lusciously fragrant west coast style - but a good example all the same."
"I find this more drinkable than any IPA I've had."
"After having read a few reviews of this beer out of the bottle I was concerned it would disappoint, but man did it deliver. A pungent punch of hoppy bitterness struck me and lingered on the palate with a slight maltiness which matched nicely. I often struggle to find other aromas on my palate and I can't identify anything else, but all I know is that this is what I want my beer to taste like. A sensational IPA, and out of the bottle it is as nice as on tap IMO, as its carbonation was substantially lower than my previous sampling."
"Amber/honey color, clear with a few particulates, and a cream colored head. Aroma is obvious, but not overwhelming. Sweet grapefruit and caramel malt are inviting. Flavor is milder than the aroma would suggest. Lightly sweet citrus with a bready malt backbone, finishing with a moderate earthy bitterness. Neither offensive, nor exciting. Body is light-medium and mouthfeel is smooth with moderate carbonation noticeable. Overall, this is an easy drinking beer, but somewhat average in terms of flavor. Does not leave me craving another."
"D - I can't drink it because it tastes like I got lost in the forest and had to chew on pine needles to survive. Maybe I just had a bad bottle, but this seemed almost like making an IPA to make one and not really knowing exactly what goes into it."
"nice super smooth mouthfeel. moderate fine carbonation. easy to drink, goes down very nicely. i paired 2 of these with a bunch of different cheeses and the combination couldnt of been better. very good ipa, as well as a great session beer."
"D: High for a spicy and bitter beer. It is strong, but at the same time hard to put down."
"D- Very easy drinking beer that I can see becoming a regular for me. Also, a very refreshing beer to come home to after a hard day of work. I've become increasingly impressed with Goose Island's year-round offerings."
"Drinkability: All day, baby! This is such a solid beer that has such a simple presence that it makes it hard not to drink. I like the bitter and the citrusy aspect of it and found it to be quite refreshing. Also, the really nice aspect about Goose Island is that it's really reasonably priced - only 6.99 for a sixer of this offering, so it's definitely going to find its way to my fridge."
"Picked this one up of the singles shelf at Simones Beverage in Lakewood Ohio. It was pretty cheap around $1.50 but I was hoping for a little more out of this one. Poured from bottle into a nice clean 12 oz. snifter. Appearance and smell that I would consider average/normal for an IPA. Taste...hello taste...taste are you there. Very boring average IPA with low drinkability because I gotta have flavor. Wouldn't go out searching for this one if your more into flavorful IPAs and double/imperial IPAs."
"D: Very drinkable, can fill anyone's hop fix if ever encountered."
"Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Dark gold color, slight haze. Left a 1/2"" tight white head with pretty good retention. Some lacing. Smell is good, citrusy. Taste reveals a pretty powerful hop presence, plenty of bitterness. No surprise from the initial smell, very citrusy. Good carbonation, leaves your mouth a little dry though. Considering that, I would say the drinkability was just okay. Leaves an aftertaste just to remind you of what you drank! Overall a good IPA though."
"Drinkability - I could drink a 6 pack of this quite easily I am thinking, seems to be very drinkable because it is light and not overpowering."
"T, M, D - Bit backbone of citrusy hops (Cascade hops perhaps?)...the grapefruit notes in the nose come through well in the flavor. A bit of toasted malt as well. This is a medium bodied brew, creamy, maybe even a bit oily on the finish. A good example of an IPA that is high on the drinkability scale."
"OVERALL: A decent taste profile on this one, and certainly looked the part, but not quite bold enough to make a statement. Right in between an APA and an IPA, though I'd probably put it a little closer to the latter. Can't really compete with the more flavorful IPA's out there. A non-offensive beer to have while watching the game, but not one to sit down and enjoy on its own. There are more interesting English IPAs out there. Easily forgettable."
"Appearance is a slightly cloudy/hazy golden color. It has a nice frothy head. This IPA has a nice floral hop aroma. This is a very well balanced IPA with just the right amount of maltiness, not too bitter with a nice finish. Has a nice smooth and silky mouthfeel. Not very much carbonation, but not a bad thing with this one. I really like this one. One of my new favorite IPA's."
"* Drinkability is high as a sessionable IPA. I enjoyed the citrus hoppy-ness and think overall this was an enjoyable IPA. Not the best ever, but enjoyable example of the style for sure."
" Overall easy to drink but not a memorable beer. Will make you hungry if you drink more probably from being so light..."
"Well-balanced IPA with all the desirable attributes, and nice I can pick it up at my local supermarket any time. This will likely become a regular entry into my beer rotation."
"The taste is rather boring, with hints of lemon and hops. Mouthfeel is pretty good, can't crush this."
"12 oz. bottle served in a tulip glass. Pours a hazy orange-red color with a good sized, billowy white head, good lacing. Aroma is sweet, caramel malts, light but very good citrus and pine hop aroma. Flavor is fruity, grapefruits, citrus and pine hops again. Good balance of flavor and bittering hops. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy, smooth finish with a slight kick of hop bitterness. Good beer, very drinkable, I like this one."
"Overall, a nice everday IPA to have on hand in your fridge. Tasty, tangy and fresh tasting."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Feels creamy in the mouth with active carbonation and a medium body."
"Overall, a nicely drinkable IPA."
"D- This is a very drinkable IPA. Goose Island has a trend going with their year around beers and seasonals (Harvest Ale..Summer Ale) that makes them a little more tame for the BMC drinkers and this is evident in this beer. It is not a altogether bad beer but very one sided and not even to the good side. Good intro beer for the up and coming craft person but I will let it sit at the sidelines unless there is nothing better to drink."
"Goose Island India Pale Ale is a hazy golden beer that leaves a white ring around the glass. It has a hoppy citrus aroma. Pine resin is detected. It smells slightly sweet and floral. It has a lively, smooth medium body with a crisp finish. It has a nice piny bitterness that's well balanced by a light sweetness. It tastes so fresh and so good!"
"Drinkability - Not having had too many Goose Islands, I'd have to say my first experiences are mostly pleasant. Thoughtful, good tasting, easy drinking beers."
"D: Nicely balanced and highly drinkable IPA. The hops aren't in your face, but still has great flavor. Plus the modest ABV, makes this a great session beer. I had this on-tap at City Crab in NYC, and it paired great with crab cakes."
"The only criticism is that it lacks any ""superstar"" qualities. It could be sweeter for my tastes."
"M/D: Feels like an IPA. Lighter body with the right amount of carbonation to make this one a good thirst quencher, but nothing more."
"D: Rather pleasant overall. It could have used another layer of depth, but wholly pleasant, and I'm glad to see it available in many non-beer-specific bars around NYC."
"It's a highly drinkable, highly enjoyable, above average IPA."
"D: This is a nice IPA. It's fairly low ABV makes it go down easily. The fruit sweetness in the flavor is a nice change from many beers of this type. I'm glad I picked it up."
"Drinkability: I've always heard good things about this IPA, but have never had the chance to try it. The highlights of the taste and mouthfeel have been combined seamlessly. This is a very sessionable, high quality IPA."
"This beer has a somewhat hazy and golden amber appearance. It has a slightly hoppy scent. The taste is pretty good. A definite hop bite, but it doesn't over do it. Its also has a nice citrus hint. This beer isn't highly carbonated. The combination of these makes the beer very refreshing. I'm glad I was able to bring a few back to TX."
"Pours a nice light amber, goldenrod, straw color with a healthy heaping of pale head. Smell is hoppy, sticky, citrusy, floral, piney, and yummy. Taste is right on par with the smell if not a little behind with not quite the level of bitterness that the aroma suggests. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good."
"D: Substantial, refreshing and poundable. Got to love that in an IPA. I originally had this as an A- but upgraded my review because I have been spending some quality time with it. A really delicious brew."
"I am a home Brewer always looking for new beers to try and than try to replicate. I was walking through my local package store in Mankato, MN and found this Ale. I have a friend who is also a home brewer who suggested I try Goose Island products sometime. So I picked up a sixer of Pale Ale. Very impressed! Not really that bitter for a Indian Pale Ale, but I believe I like this better than most. You could definetly get yourself in trouble downing a six pack on a warm afternoon. Very nice, but not over powering citrus aroma, bitterness right to my liking, drank it out of a bottle, nice graphics by the way. I recommend very highly. Lastly, it taste alot like Brau Brothers Brewing Pale Ale, either one is a good choice"
"D- Not really as bitter or hoppy as I was expecting. An easy drinking brew but it feels more like an APA and not an IPA."
"Drinkability: I like it, I could do more of this one when I'm in the mood for some crisp hoppiness. Would like to try this one on tap in Chicago some day."
"This beer pours an ordinary orange color, common with other IPA's that I have had. There is a nice two finger head to the pour with a good amount of cling to the glass. The smell reminds me of your average IPA with hints of pine, citrus and light malts. The taste is current with the smells; you get a nice, if somewhat weak, balance of hops. There is a nice hop and malt balance that finishes off smooth and noncommital. Overall this was in my opinion an average IPA and good but not anything that would draw me back to it. I percieved a lack of strength in the beer but it had a good balanced taste. An okay IPA, however nothing extraordinary."
"Had this a while back, but took some notes. Poured a golden color with frothy white head that faded moderately quickly and left lots of lacing. Smelled of piney hops, caramel malt, and some hints of citrus. Tasted very similar minus the citrus. Pretty smooth, just slightly overcarbonated, very easy to drink."
"D- This is a highly drinkable beer considering the low ABV for an IPA along with the cheap price tag. I have a feeling that this will become a staple in my fridge this summer."
"Yes, this is a very drinkable brew. Tasty, not too high of an ABV, would be great on a warm summer day."
"Overall. A very solid representation of the style, with the earthy hops lingering on the palate."
"A very well rounded IPA. Highly drinkable. Recommended."
"Great finish, smooth, but a tad watery. A great all-purpose IPA. I'd pick up a six pack in a heartbeat."
"Drinks pretty smooth through the hops."
"This beer has a nice amber haze to it and and a nice foam head that sticks around for a while after the pour. A standard IPA smell to it , hops and goodness! Very good balance between the malt and the hops. The taste is malty sweet at the beginning and then the hops dominate after the first second. Motuhfeel is a little on the light side for an IPA , atleast to me. This is a very drinkable IPA , I could finish half the 6pack tonight!"
"I have had this beer many times and most recently on tap while visiting Goose Island while in Chicago. This is a quality representative of the IPA style so there is not much I can add to this other than to say it is a prototypical IPA and a well done one at that. Hops, pine and citrus. It is quite drinkable as well."
"Drinkability: A great IPA whose aroma doesn't really match the flavor. I wish the taste was more like the aroma. A solid session brew worthy of case purchase."
"D- Very, very drinkable. Has some DIPA characteristics. I think this could only get better with the presence of some fresh hops. One of the better IPA's I've had. I will seek out a fresh bottle."
"I think this review is probably low because the hops have faded, but I'm reviewing the beer in front of me."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink, though a little sweet."
"Overall, this is good, but has the hop profile of an APA to me. I would get again for the right price."
"Had this on tap at the El Bait Shop in Des Moines. Poured in a pint glass. Appears a nice dark golden color with a pretty decent head. Aroma of mostly grapefruit and some pine. Taste is quite balanced. It has a very good fruity flavor with hints of spiciness. It ends with a nice sweet citrusy note. Good beer, and a good session ale. Hope to see this beer in TX some day."
"D= This was the freshest Goose Island IPA I have ever had and it was excellent. Easy to session too!"
"D: Very easy to drink. Could session this IPA all night. Nothing groundbreaking here but an extremely solid, drinkable IPA from Goose Island. Would definitely have this often if it was available."
"D: Good intro drinkability."
"Not as good as I remember from in the past, but I think my IPA tastes have changed, as I used to think Furious was too bitter."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Honker's Ale shaker ""pint"" glass. Appears a clear golden yellow color with about a finger of fluffy, lingering bone white foam. Smells and tastes of toasted grains, sweet malts, lemony bitter hops, mildly grassy, a touch of grapefruit, and caramel. This IPA is medium in both body and carbonation. Certainly worth seeking out if you are a fan of the style."
"This IPA has a nice flavor, but it just does not seem that inspired to get a better review. To me, it seems a little light on the flavor side, maybe to make it more marketable. I wish it would kick me in the mouth a little bit more."
"D: Moderate ABV and good balance make this one very drinkable."
"Pours a deep golden color. The smell is an earthy blend of spicy hops and toasty malt. The taste is solid. It is brewed with four variety of hops: Styrian,Fuggle, Centennial, and Cascade. The slightest sweetness of fruit touches your tongue at first taste but is quickly held back by the dry malty middle, which is cut through by the medley pine from the hops. Nice and dry, with a good aftertaste. A great example of the style, and dangerously drinkable. While their are other examples of the style I still prefer, (Furious, Hop Ottin',Green Flash) this beer is quite tasty. Very drinkable, and I could easily drink it all day considering it is 5.9% compared to most the IPAs/IIPAs I drink. Props to Goose Island for this solid, regular release."
"D: This is a solid IPA. Not my first choice out there, but worthwhile. I'd give it a whirl again."
"D - Nicely balanced IPA, though I think I may be growing out of the style. Not overly hoppy or malty. Mission accomplished."
"D - A decent beer that would be a good session beer if the abv were lower."
"A damn fine IPA. Hop maniacs might not be overly impressed, but I find the balance of strength and smoothness of this brew to be admirable."
"Theres way better IPA's out there that are in the same price range and A LOT more better in flavor. I would skip on this one if you come across it."
"Definitely recommend!"
"D -- Good drinkability for an IPA, flavors blend very nicely. Goose calls this an English-style IPA, but I find it balanced more to hops than most English varieties."
"Well, I'm disappointed.... I was hoping for a lot more from this. You live and learn..."
"D- I've recently had a kick with DIPA and IIPA's and it had been a while since I had a GI IPA. It was one of the first IPA's I got into, and for some reason I was expecting less when I came back to it. I was pleasantly surprised with the hop character and the overall balance. This is a highly drinkable and delicious IPA."
"excellent and accessible IPA. aside from the bourban c. stout, this one is definitely a gem from an all around pretty good selection of brews"
"On draft at the brewpub in the Summer 2008. I've had this many times and I find that it is as good in the bottle as on tap. Cascade, Centennial and Fuggle hops combine for a nice floral nose. The pale malt backbone matches the hops in a light way. A bit heavy for a quick quaffer, but too good for a lawnmower only, keep some around in the summer for those hot days."
"This is a good product by GI and very available and economical in my locale. It makes for a great session IPA or even an introductory IPA for a newbie."
"D: I have no problem drinking this one, and look forward to the other 5 (not all in one night, most likely)"
"GIIPA, as I like to call it, has a nice pale/golden color with a finger width head. It has a very nice floral character to the nose. It has a nice citrus hop flavor with some nice sweet malts and a good bitterness at the end. It has a nice medium body and is overall a very good and drinkable beer."
"The beer is smooth at first and moves towards a more gritty mouthfeel from some astringent hop acidity. It's presence is a nice compliment to warm barley grain flavors. Well balanced and a fantastic beer. There are IPA's better out there but this one is a solid brew. It is a complete package of good looks, great scents and a more then pleasing flavor. Drink it."
"D - A good IPA with great balance. Not too hoppy although it is older, and nice and malty too. A good sessioner I could any time of the year."
"Easy to drink, could drink one after the other all night long."
"D: This is an IPA that should appeal to a wide group of beer fans. While it will not knock you over the head with huge IBU's, it will leave you satisfied if your goal is a well balanced, hop forward, tasty brew. I look forward to many of these for years to come."
"Honey amber with a ton of suspended yeast particles. Patchy white head that leaves fine lace on the glass. Cascade hops and toasty grain in the nose with some citrus fruitiness. Tastes nice and hoppy but well balanced, not an extreme DIPA just a tasty brew that always hits the spot. Creamy and smooth bodied. Good stuff and a steal for $8 a sixer."
"Taste: Bitter hoppy taste that lasts throughout the drink. There is a hint of a flowery taste which could be called sweet and is a good balance to the bitterness."
"My bottle says that it was bottled 11/04/08. That's about four months ago. It also says that I should pour into a tulip glass but I chose my pilsner glass instead. The beer has a nice cloudy orange/yellow hue and a well-retained large bubbled head. The foam sticks to the glass as it's drank down. The aroma is not overpowering, which is good. Smells hoppy and citrusy with a bit of pine. Tastes bitterly hopped and fruity in very good ways. No lingering unpleasant aftertaste, either. Very smooth and easy drinking. Good IPA."
"Consumed at fifty degrees. A nice surprise. Pours light orange with thin head and almost suspended carbonation. Smells of faint citrus and slight pine. Hops up front and bready out the back with surprising balance for the lack of abv. An enjoyable ipa, but nothing outstanding."
"Drinkability: Pretty high. Cut the stickiness a little in the aftertaste, and I could drink it all day. I think it's a good gateway IPA - not too bitter, not too overwhelming."
"Very drinkable, will buy again."
"Drinkability is good."
"Highly drinkable--lower abv than many IPA's makes it a solid go-to IPA."
"I really like their IPA. It's not the best one out there but it's one that can be put back easily and one of the more balanced. It's almost like it's trying to be English. Good stuff."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a deep golden color with a finger of head, good retention. Smell is lightly citrus but mostly biscuitlike. Taste is a little too malty for my liking, Its good for the style but I like hop heavier IPAs. Light to medium mouthfeel. This is very drinkable and I could drink a six pack in a sitting easy. I'm a big fan of Goose Island but feel a little let down by this offering. I think they didn't use enough bittering hops to really make this beer stand out. If they ever make a dry hopped version of this I think it would be a perfect balance. Overall a decent IPA but not one I'll look out for in bottles again. I look forward to trying this on tap to see if it the hops had just faded in this bottle."
"D: This one is definitely on the hoppy side, but it drinks and finishes smooth. So for the style it is an easy drinker."
"Overall, a very good beer from GIBC."
"Bottle into Tulip. Good but not spectacular aroma, good color and lacing throughout. Medium-bodied; citrus & piney notes. An above average India Pale Ale. Good bitter finish and very enjoyable. One plus is it is the only IPA at our WM Supercenter, so Cheers to that when I need an IPA fix and am among the masses!"
"Pours a huge head, light tan, big bubbles, lasting, good lacing. Very clear, light amber body. Very bitter hoppy aroma., just lots of bitter acid. Surprisingly balanced taste. Malty with a little hops. Cleaner and sweeter on the end. Not very complex or overall flavorful. Okay but more a pale than an IPA."
"d: pretty good but unbalanced in a way i just didn't dig as much as other IPAs."
"D - Oh man, I could drink this all night. Great flavor, good body, and not too high alcohol content. A sessionable delicious beer."
"The taste is a well balanced IPA, hoppy, but not overpowering. This is the third selection that I have had from Goose Island and I am impressed. The mouthfeel is very nice, just makes you kind of hungry like a lot of IPAs tend to. Good drinkability, a couple of these would compliment a plate of hot wings well."
"A super IPA, the mouthfeel is very smooth and full. Extremley drinkable indeed."
"D - The sourness and lack of that hop freshness taste made this one a little harder to get through."
"I greatly preferred this beer when it was darn cold, but its still a solidly crafted IPA upon warming, too."
"I can't say I was overly impressed with the lack of taste and safistication. It's not bad, but it doesn't have much to distinguish itself. Just another overproduced micro on its way to macro land."
"D: I was highly impressed with Goose Islands IPA and will pull for a sixer of this boy the next time I'm so inclinded. A smooth and sweet IPA at first with growing hops bitter bang not far behind. Good clean delivery and not too shabby in the IBU tally count. This is the IPA if you want something creamy but still full of hops."
"Notes: A drinkable IPA."
"Overall-nice IPA, well balanced and tasty. I'm a fan."
"With that said, Goose Island hasn't produced another style that I consider worthy of even brewing. Sorry, I just feel it needs to be said."
"I can drink ten of these babies. Full of flavor but goes down easy"
"Nose is delicious and hoppy, running the gamut from piney to slightly floral to sweet citrus. Flavors follow the nose, leaning toward pine with a good dose of juicy citrus thrown in for good measure. Medium-bodied and crisp, leaving me wanting another sip. A solid IPA."
"Overall - Good beer. Again, hops prevail. This is what an American IPA should be in my mind."
"This is a favorite of my beer buddies, and has many times been considered the best all around IPA we have tried."
"D: The flavor and generous carbonation make this a very drinkable beer."
"Edit: Just realized this one was about 5 months old at time of consumption. Probably not a very fair assessment."
"Cheers!!!"
"Drinkability: A decent, balanced IPA that satisfies both the hophead and the mainstream"
"M/D: Body is light, carbonation is slightly prickly but feels appropriate. Extremely drinkable. Nothing over the top here, just a good American IPA."
"HV"
"Maybe I didn't let it warm enough when I had it a few days ago, but I definitely wasn't especially impressed. But this is a good beer. I even thought at the time that it was more of a Pale than an IPA, but maybe the temp or something I had eaten, or having been traveling all day, or some combinagtion thereof, obscured my palate."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied, nice."
"D- I bought this actually thinking about SN Celebration Ale. I don't think GI IPA gets enough credit. After BCS and Matilda, this is Goose Island's best. And its so classic and versatile. I remember drinking this at a music fest downtown Chicago in July and the hops tasting just as good in 90 degrees as they do tonight in Chicago with snow and 9 degrees. Probably my favortie IPA."
"Wow. This is a great tasting IPA! The pineapple taste mirrors the scent. Great hop bitterness at the onset, during the drink, and at the finish, but without the bitter aftertaste. This IPA will not burn the mouth out, but man is it satisfying! Very smooth and crisp. I really like this beer..."
"Mouthfeel is thin and a bit watery but that just makes it go down easier."
"This beer's good, but I think I have screwed myself up as of late because I have been tasting a lot of Imperial IPA's. This beer just doesn't do it for me in light of what I have been drinking."
"Pretty light body. Mild carbonation. This is not a bad IPA at all, and is a very drinkable beer. This would be a good session beer for me."
"I liked this one. Not a total hop bomb. I would be able to drink a few of these without overloading the tastebuds with bitterness."
"Drinkability- This is very nice for the craft swilling needs. If I needed a six or twelve for just kicking back and watching a game, or going to a movie marathon, I could take this as one of the better choices. Very smooth to kick back with."
"I find this to be a very easily sessionable IPA. I was down three of these before I could blink. This guy does everything really well, but not great. A good go to IPA."
"A very easy drinking beer though the taste is average for an IPA."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Pours a hazy, sedimenty, copper with fluffy white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell is strong of caramel malt and very sweet. Hop smell is minimal. Taste is stongly of malt which was unexpected. Some citrus hops but overall somewhat bland. Mouthfeel is somewhat light thanks to the moderately high carbonation. Overall a good beer, nothing amazing. I should have check the date on it becuase the overall hop presence seemed to be dull. Hopefully it was just an older bottle."
"Drinkability is pretty good, but its a bit weak for the style so its tough to give a really high score here."
"D: Highly drinkable, no alcohol presence at all, would taste great on a hot summer day. A very good american IPA but not one of my favorites, I would think of it as a british IPA with american hops. Worth trying."
"An extremely well balanced and tasty IPA from Goose Island. I just wish that I had better access to this, as it would be a staple in my fridge for a quick, hoppy, fix."
"Pours a nice dark amber in color. There's about three inches of head atop the beer. Smell is piney hops. Taste is more of the piney, grassy hops. There's a little bit of a juicy, citrus hop flavor as well. Very good, biting mouthfeel. This is a good IPA."
"Very drinkable, and a beer that one could easily have a session with. Pretty hoppy and it has a bite, but if you are into that kind of beer, then this one should be right up your alley."
"Good IPA, pretty straight forward. Easy to drink and refreshing. Not a prime IPA, but worth a try."
"Received this as an extra in a trade with BuckeyeNation. Thanks! Pours golden, a little on the paler side and very slightly hazy. Okay head that fades to a thin swirl. Fairly nice hoppy aroma with citrus and some light malt. The taste is a little lighter on the hops and heavier on the thin, sweet malt. Some earthy bitterness on the finish, but pretty light. Somewhat thin, but pleasant enough."
"D - this is an above average IPA, meaning it is not overly bitter as some can be, yet it is assertive in it hop taste as it should be. This is a great example of the style."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew very tasty"
"Draft at Goose Island Clybourn brewpub. A clear pale gold, little head or carbonation - seems to be a trend here. Lovely aroma of... well... of marijuana. Lovely fresh hop flavour. And there's that weed again. This is wonderful stuff. The star of the show at Goose Island this evening. They are out of the Imperial IPA - I can't imagine what that would be like. Hard to top this."
"Felt great. Good carbonation gives a crisp finish, leaving little bitter aftertaste."
"Wow! This is a well crafted IPA in all aspects. Pours a burnt orange color into my glass. There is a thick foamy head that immediately forms and eventually simmers down to a fine creamy film. Carbonation is slightly visible, and a thick lacing forms all the way down the glass. This beer is very aromatic, a bouquet of spices, malts, and bitter hops fill my senses. This is a very traditional aroma that is well balanced. The mouthfeel is thick and full with a very nice finish. The flavor is outstanding. Spicy and citrus flavors from the hops immediately hit followed by a smooth maltiness. At first the intensity from the hops overwhelm my palate but after a few tastes this beer comes together in wonderful fashion. Well rounded and outstanding in all categories, well done."
"I probably would have had a second one had there not been a tempting tap full of Sixpoint Sweet Action right next to it."
"Drinkability: A chicago classic, a very sessionable brew, good intro to the love of the hops."
"Pours a golden brown with a one finger head that dissipates somewhat, but leaves decent lacing throughout. Smell is of hops hops and more hops. Taste is excellent. Piney hops come through strongly followed by malt make this a very strong tasting but well-balanced IPA. It's very drinkable, and definitely sessionable. This is one of my favorites to pick up when I'm watching a game or just relaxing and drinking beer. This was the first IPA I ever had, and it's still one of my favorites."
"A very solid moderate IPA."
"This is just a nice standard IPA, good solid hop backbone and nice malts that don't get in the way. If I lived in Chicago this could be a ""go to"" IPA."
"D: Having this after flying all day, so maybe it's going down better than it should... but it's pretty tasty and easy to drink, at that."
"D - I am not normally an IPA person but I like this one."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, there are some others in the style that I would pick first, but this is still a good beer that is worth drinking for a while."
"Pours to a good head that had some nice lacing. Brownish gold in color with a offwhite head. Ale was kind of hazy. You could also detect this hazy appearance when pouring. Also left some sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Smelled of hops citrus and pine. I think the pine smell was the strongest. Smelled good in the nose. Almost a floral smell. Tasted a lot like it smelled. Good flavour of pine, citrus, with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Pine taste hung around for a while. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was good also. I would love to make this a session beer. But I think it might get me in trouble because I would drink them to fast."
"Pours smooth, with a darker orange coloring and haze. Very pretty to look at. Smell of Hops is intoxicating, but not overwhelming.Taste is surprisingly light for an IPA, a little citrus-like tint to the taste. Nice after-bite. Feels light, goes down easily. Probably a very good session brew. My friends love this beer, I think its alright, but I've had better IPAs."
"I think this one was designed by the brewery accountants which Mosher talks about in Radical Brewing. Seems like they skimped us good on the malt and especially the hops. It's not bad, just a big let down for an IPA."
"D - Subtle hoppiness makes this extremely drinkable. Nice beer."
"D- Meh, it was OK. I probably wont be seeking this one out again anytime soon, unless i see it on tap somewhere. There was nothing i had against it really, its just kind of boring."
" I liked it and thought this could be a good session beer."
"Really an enjoyable beer. East to drink and flavorful."
"Notes: Had this on tap in Chicago once or twice and it seems to translate well in bottle form. Definitely a repeat buy for these summer months."
"D: Uber!"
"Well this was a hard IPA to get a handle on as it seemed reluctant to show its self in the glass. The hops took awhile to appear and then the malt backbone had to be coaxed out. The beer is low in carbonation and slightly oily to the taste. It doesn't have the fresh punch that I look for in an IPA but once it warms up it proves a sessionable example of the style."
"A great try for any IPA advocate. Uniquely flavored and easy to drink."
"The mouthfeel was a bit oily adn didnt dry the palate at the finish which would make it tough to session as it gets sort of heavy feeling after one or two."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. I kept licking the top of my mouth after each sip. Overall, a relatively mild IPA. Could certainly be an intro to the style for those unfamiliar. This would also be a great session brew."
"Overall, a wonderful example of an IPA that leans just a bit more towards hops, but showcases their wonderful flavor properties; not just tries to numb your tongue. Highly recommended.l"
"Poured in to a tulip glass as recommended. I recommend tulip glasses for almost all beers. Very thick head that leaves thick rings as you drink. Deep color, slightly cloudy. Excellent taste. Tastes good very cold. This is a very readily available beer in Chicago area that is hard to beat. I keep trying other IPAs, but keep coming back."
"This is a very good beer that is highly drinkable. This is the type of beer that begs to have another drink. Although I usually like my IPA's to have a little more bite, I still highly recommend this beer. Can't wait to try the other Goose Island styles."
"From a bottle into a pint glass. Nice orange-amber color to it. Started off with an inch of head but died down to a small layer on top of the liquid. Left moderate lacing. Smells of earth and fruits. Initially a mild fruity taste that turns into a moderate bitterness. Not too interesting, but not bad. Finish is pretty short. Low to medium amount of carbonation that made it have a nice soft mouthfeel However its easy drinking and people would have no problem drinking a few in a sitting."
"D-very smoothe and balanced for an AIPA,also nice to be able to enjoy some beer that is brewed in my home state"
"D - Even though this beer isn't balanced, the hops work for this brew. I could see having a few of these in a session."
"M/D - Full bodied and smooth feel. Very drinkable IPA."
"A golden orangish color, with a white head, that is a quarter inch high develops. piny and earthy aromas come through at first scent, followed by some citrusy aromas. There is a slight taste of malt at the beginning, then the hops take over from there, with some good bitterness and a citrus aftertaste at the end. The feel is medium bodied, but leaves a nice dry finish at the end. This beer is true to the style, immense hop flavor and aroma in a glass."
"This is a very drinkable malt dominated IPA which is a change from most hop accented American IPAs. It is surprising that this ale is about 6 percent ABV given the light flavor. A good warm weather choice, but if you are looking for a hoppy IPA, you may want to pass on this one."
"I really enjoy what I have had from Goose Island. My previous review of the Honker is probably too high for what it is. Overall opinion is that Goose Island as a whole has some very very decent brew but could easily reach the next tier. Maybe I need to sample more of their offerings."
"D: This one's easy to drink but one'll do."
"Good stuff...recommended..."
"Overall a pretty good ipa i tend to like them to be a bit more hoppy but this was nice for a change and a more subtle flavor"
"D-Certainly solid but not a wowzer for me. I like it just fine but doubt I would find myself reaching for it often...something simply does not click for me."
"D: I can drink this for a long time, I will definitely buy a sixer next time I'm looking for something familiar."
"Decent IPA. Yes, I'll have another."
""
"D: Yep, this is drinkable."
"D- so full of fruity flavors it's hard to put her down. bitterness is a bitch though, and for a session i'd have to move on..."
"One of my all time favorite IPAs; still holds up as well as anything I've had"
"Slight haze on an orange golden haystack with a fine assed and fuzzy white lid. Sexy nose. Lemon zest, orange, and grapefruit entice as spicy, grassy hops mingle with sweet floral and pale mat aromas. The medium body displays buzzingly fine, creamy carbonation that tickles the tongue with a perfect amount of sharp bitterness. The fresh citric fruit and rind bitterness flow straight through to the finish, the pale floral sweetness is subtle, but definitely adds to the brew. Earthy spice shows up and joins the bitter finish. I find this an excellent offering that even the non-ipa fans could enjoy"
"This is one of my favorite IPA's. I love that this beer is not bitter at all, but it is obvious there are plenty of hops and it is well balanced with a good dose of malt. Recommended."
"Of the IPA's I have sampled, this was definitely one of the best overall. It was highly flavorful, ridiculously drinkable and it paired perfectly with my crab and shrimp stuffed salmon."
"Tasted on 2/12/08."
"Excellent, and a terrific accompaniment to my butter and garlic tilapia."
"Pours a light orange/amber color with decent head and lacing. Has a very strong floral scent that covers up any bitter or sweet scent for the most part. Decent taste, again it's very floral, too much so, but it does have a nice bitter aftertaste. Goes down fine. While I love Goose Island's oatmeal stout, the IPA just isn't the best."
"Mostly transluscent honey colored pour with a nice whitish head. Smell is mildly hopped with some sweetness showing in the nose as well. Taste is somewhat mild hop bitterness and flavor, with a smooth, creamy tart sweetness following. Almost more American Pale like to me, but it makes for a very nice drinkable IPA. A bit unique, and friendly at the same time."
"Overall, this is a good beer. Not the best GI product BUT it still ""worth a try""!"
"This is a great American IPA... Poured a hazy copper with a nice full head that disappeared, but left consistent lacing throughout the drink. Its nose was full of citrus and pine, the hops just cut right through it! The taste was full of hops, but had a nice balance of citrus and woodiness. This beer was easy to drink, had a great mouthfeel and went wonderful with the ribs I ate! Goose Island is a great brewery, and this beer carries on the tradition."
"Not the best nor the worst but definitely a pleasant drinker. Wish I could have these around here on the East Coast more often."
"Overall Impression: A nice IPA. Nothing extreme, fairly mellow but with lots of complex hop flavors. A nice beer!"
"This is about the only American-style IPA I can find when traveling in downstate Illinois. While it's nowhere close my local favorite like Racer 5 or even SoCal guys like Ballast Point or Green Flash, Goose Island's IPA is a respectable and enjoyable rendition that I'm happy to get more of."
"Pours a slightly clouded amber with a creme head that doesn't really stick around but leaves lots of evidence (that means lace) on the way down. Nose is very piney and sticky hops. Seems a bit salty as well. Flavor is hoppy of course. Tangy tones rule on this one. Minor bitter hop edge is there as well. Feel is nice. This is a smooth and well balanced IPA. I'd love to see a cask offering."
"Pours a clean golden yellow with orange-ish hints, with a white head. In the aroma, grapefruity hops. In the taste, hoppy and a light malt to back it up. A small bitter, and lighter body mouthfeel and a small grapefruity hop aftertaste. Great everyday IPA, kind of light but a nice balance."
"Nothing to write home about. This ale poured cloudy -too much chill haze for my tastes. Decent head and lacing. Very neutral aroma for an IPA. The body and mouthfeel were average -pretty firm malt base. However, the taste was dominated by Cascade hops. The malt sweetness and citrus taste of the Cascades gave this ale a definite American IPA feel. I've grown rather tired of Cascades. In this case I think it was overdone."
"I must admit being a bit underwhelmed on this one. I would think the IPA would be more towards the alpha acid side. A good beer as a safe choice when there is nothing else around."
"Poured a nice attractive orange/amber color with decent white head that stayed for a while. The aroma was was of citrus fruit. The taste was hoppy but well-balanced by the maltiness. The mouthfeel was good and the drinkability of this IPA was way up there. I liked."
"Solid quencher from start to finish. I'll be getting more of these for trips out to the lake in the summer."
"D: The alcohol content may catch up with me if I put back a few of these. By the end of the glass I'm getting a little overwhelmed by the hops."
"D - very nice American IPA, this is perhaps one of the better Goose Island beers I've had"
"Pours a pale golden color with a white pillowy head that so slowly dies down. Smell is citrusy and piney hops and not much else. Taste is strong on citrus as well with a nice bitter finish. Plenty of nice carbonation makes this one a strong IPA. Not the best offering from Goose Island, but a solid beer."
"I like this beer for what it is; its not trying to be over the top with citrus hops and bitterness but a well balanced beer and well crafted. I hope to drink this more often."
"Great IPA. I would say it's closer to an English version. Perfectly drinkable, and it won't ruin the palate. Give this one a shot."
"edit: Flavor stands up to the hottest salsa, just thought someone might want to know that."
"Overall, it's a great American IPA."
"Color here is a light amber with a pretty thin and quickly disintegrating head. Can smell a good bit of hops coming off of it with a fresh pine and cut grass smell to it. Taste at first is rather smooth and then get hit with a sharp, bitter, pine hop taste that is throughly enjoyable and is offset a bit by a sweeter malt that comes later in the tasting. Pretty nice for a simple IPA imo. The carbonation is pretty good with the hops and the only thing i don't really care for is that in the after taste seems to leave a bit of a weird film in my mouth which just feels odd."
"Taste is hoppy and has some strong citric notes. The beer is not extremely bitter, but is medium bitter when compared to IPA standards. The beer is not as bitter as I expected and hoped for. Body is medium and for my liking could have been a bit thicker. A very drinkable beer for the IPA novice."
"12 ounce bottle, says best before 03/29/2008. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a honey/orange color with an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Nice clean aroma of citrusy/grapefruit hops and a bit of floral hops too. Taste is similar to the aroma as far as the hops go, but there's also some spice and matly sweetness noticable. Mouthfeel is light/medium, it's smooth and leaves a slight coating on my tongue. Drinkability is good, it's a nice refreshing IPA that's quite sessionable. Not a bad choice at all!"
"This beers pours a cloudy orange with a active white head that leaves a lot of lacing. The smell is fruity and hoppy. Initial flavor is of hops and carbonation, but has a bit of spice to it as well. Finishes smooth with a nice mouthfeel. This is a good summertime beer, maybe the best IPA Ive had."
"Overall- A little too light but another easily drinkable beer by GI."
"4's across the board. Solid and tasty IPA. And who gives a damn if they're affiliated with A-B or not...good beer is good beer. I don't know why that's even listed under brewery notes; who cares. Anyway, this is a nice IPA that I would definitely have again."
"good beer. could drink more than a few of these. will drink again."
"The taste is balanced, fairly pronounced hops bitterness with a hint of malt in the finish. The beer is crisp but overall mouthfeel is a bit thin. I was expecting the thinness to fade as the tongue got coated, but this did not happen. Drinkability is good, between the 5.9 abv and pleasant taste, I could see this as sessionable. Overall a pretty average IPA - wouldnt seek it out but wouldnt turn it down either."
"I enjoy IPA's, and this one is very good."
"D: Enough hop character to maintain its identitty, yet little enough to make this one a great candidate for session drinking. An excellent everyday beer."
"Tastebuds warm up to the hops right away. One of the few IPAs that I could make a session beer, which may or may not be a good thing. G.I. plays it safe with this one for malt-mouths like me. I'm dissapointed that it isn't more experimental, but happy that I can have more than one without my taste buds jumping out of my mouth and looking for a fire extinguisher."
"A great IPA from Goose Island that, to me, seems very underrated. I have sampled bottles in the past and they weren't quite as vibrant as the fresh tapped version."
"D-Damn fine brew, I wish I had more"
"Overall, not my favorite IPA for sure. A fair brew, though, with a different hop balance than others I've tried."
"Drinkability - despite the powerful taste a very juicy and refreshing beer."
"An ADIPA ( all day IPA ) , this one is very easy to throw several back. Not one of the best i've had but no slouch either. Try it , you'll like it."
"I found this IPA to be very....average. It smelled a bit hoppy, but the taste was a not very exciting balance of hops and more maltiness than I expected. Still, this isn't really a flavor-packed IPA, and maybe more extreme IPAs, APAs, and DIPAs have made too cynical for this beer. Yet, it also didn't seem to be an ""English-style"" IPA/bitter. I also found it to be a bit watery in mouthfeel. Not quite sure what drawer to put this beer in in my mind, which combined with uninspiring messages from my taste buds left me feeling a bit unsatisfied."
"Bottle courtesy of Piscator34: Poured a deep hazy beige color ale with a nice foamy head and good retention. Aroma of bitter and floral hops is dominating and quite enjoyable. Taste is a nice mix between some caramel malt with some floral hops and a medium bitter finish. Good carbonation with full body and well balance for the style."
"D: A session IPA if there ever was one. Very easy drinking...Another please."
"While in Chicago, I tried a bottle of this during lunch at the Frontera Grill. I am not a huge fan of IPAs, but this one was quite nice. Went great with some spicy Mexican food. It poured a nice golden red color, and you could definitely smell the hops. The taste was interesting, though. Some IPA tend to be overly hoppy, and almost hard to drink a few. This one was just subtle enough to enjoy, but still know you are drinking an IPA. The middle ground with hops is what I enjoy, and this one hits the spot. An excellent example."
" Overall this was a tight little IPA. Nothing to scream about and there are actually some local ones that I can get that I actually find a bit tastier. Again not to say that this was bad, just not really impressed with it overall. I would not turn it down if it was offered, but there are better ones out there. Still worth a try though."
"Served in a house IPA glass at the Clybourn brewpub. The beer was served a nice amber with a decent semi-lasting head. The aroma was a decent blend of citrus hops against some sweet malts. The beer was a good hop blend that leaned on the citrus side that just slightly overpowered the sweet malt backbone. The beer was crisp and refreshing, just slightly light for the style. For the most part, this is an enjoyable IPA, but far from the top of my list."
"Immediately one of my favorites, it's missing just a tad of the depth of Two Hearted, to my taste, or maybe that's just me in this moment. I'm looking for this as much as I am that when I'm in the midwest from now on."
"Mouthfeel is medium , good carbonation. Overall a pleasure to drink. I consider it a session beer, although I tend to get drunk after 6."
"T: very balanced, a little bitter and and sweet good i liked it what more can i say. there was not a lot of depth but it had great character and was extremely easy to drink. definatly a ood beer"
"Drinkability is okay, but why. This is an IPA -- it should rattle your teeth a bit more, but it doesn't. One more pretty nice, above average beer from a pretty nice, above average brewery"
"I could have several of these any day of the week, not cloying on the palette like many other IPA's comming on the market just to try and make hop heads happy"
"Pours a light amber with an orange-ish hue, very clear. Big head. Wonderful fresh american hop aroma (Cascades), almost completely hides the malt aroma. Flavor is rich and malty and HOPPY, again very fresh Cascade hops. Medium bodied and well carbonated. This brewery produces nice beers, this is one of their better offerings!"
"Pours an amber-copper slightly foggy beer with a finger of white head on top. Nose is fairly mild, light floral hops mostly. Taste is citrus fruitiness, light caramel, and light roasted malt, with a fairly nice bitter hoppy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is average, solid carbonation and medium bodied. This one's a solid beer, although it's not particularly unique or interesting. I'd drink it, no question, but I think I'd go to other IPAs if they were available."
"drinkability is mediocre. the beer is sharp, yet light bodied, so drinkers privy to the unique taste will put back a few with ease."
"Pours out a nice light hazy orange. Slight white head and lacing. Nose is of spicy earthy hops. Taste- hops at the front of the tongue- not a huge hop bite, slightly oily, heavier on the bitter side. Bitterness slides into a solid malt backbone. Good balance- finish is woody and dry. Nice mouthfeel and good carbonation. Classice american IPA stylings. Nice combo of traditional british IPA and left coast American IPA."
"on tap at the brewery in chicago this was brilliant. i haven't found the bottle to quite hold up. though this is definitly a good beer even in the bottle."
"Feels thick and also very dry. Has a biscuit/yeast base, but also has a clean finish. It's well balanced overall. Dry and bitter; bitter in both the hops AND the malt. A good, serviceable IPA."
"Drinkability is good with hops that don't numb the senses. This is always a welcome beer when I'm in the Midwest."
"D-A middle of the road IPA. This is in no way a bad beer, just slightly mediocre. With so many IPA choices available, I wont seek this out."
"Drinkability: A very delicious beer and one that I'd be sure to reach for again, very very refreshing."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. This beer poured a hazy light amber color with a small beige head that fades slowly. Some light lacing is left behind. The aroma is fruity, citrus hops along with some light toffee notes. The flavor consists of orange, grapefruit, and some lightly sweet malts. Very nicely balanced for an IPA. The mouthfeel is light and slightly watery. Light to medium-bodied. A solid IPA from Goose Island."
"D: A very good IPA and one that I would reach for when I need to get my hop fix. Overall an outstanding testament to the style and a must try."
"Excellent beer with great balance. Highly drinkable."
"Among the best IPA's I've ever had."
"Taste is of carmelized hops with a bready note. Some sweetness to the beer, but it's counteracted by a well-placed bitter hoppy finish. The body of Goose's IPA is medium to light, crisp, and it has an average amount of carbonation. Easily drinkable and tasty, but a bit one-sided to be classified as a standout IPA. I did manage, however, to polish off 3 of these in one night and I could've easily had 3 more. Solid brewing from Chi-town."
"when i first had goose beers as a youngster (and had only drunk macros and malt liquor), this left a soapy aftertaste. fortunately after being opened up to craft brews i sensed this one quite differently. this looks like your typical ipa, light amber in color, typical head for the style. the aroma is more dominant of pine with some floral notes. they are not using the citrusy hops here which i now am in love with, though. a little caramel malt sweetness upfront is quickly taken over by the bittering hops. this was my first ipa after being enlightened and it left me wanting more. i finally got the hops thing. i finally got the piney bitterness rather than soapy flavors i imagined before i was used to hops. medium in body. long finish. an overall decent ipa."
"Taste is very mellow, and leans towards the malt in a big way. Crackery malt with some bready baking notes, caramel, vanilla. Whatever hop flavour there is here, it's mostly a herbal hop character with a bit of floweriness. There's an interesting flavour in the finish that is very green, and reminds me of eating peas in the pod, right off the vine. Little in the way of and IPA character here, it's more of a jazzier APA. Mouthfeel is mild on the carbonation and isn't nearly as dry as I'd expect. It's easy drinking, but besides the aroma, this beer has very little of the things that I've come to love in an American IPA."
"drinkability is great. well balanced and very enjoyable."
"I could easily have a few of these."
"A pretty good IPA, and another great beer from Goose Island. I've yet tasted a bad beer from GI."
"Nice mouthfeel and nice drinkability. An easy beer to make a session out of."
"Ole Rog must think the Cubbies are gonna win the World Series too !?!"
"Still, Goose island is a noble brew, and I think they would agree too."
"D- There are so many better offerings out there. I had higher expectations for this. All I can think of about this beer is ""so what?"""
"Not too bad a brew at all. I will definitely hit these here and there."
"It is a very drinkable ale."
"Purchased at corner store, bottle stated best when consumed by 8- 19- 07. Chilled and poured into a nonic despite the suggestion of a tulip glass as specified on the label. Nice two fingers of gray-ish white head, which dissipated at a medium pace and lingers little more than a centimeter off the surface, leaving slightly thin lacing. The body is a very light amber color with a slight hint of peach and blond straw colored highlights. The body is translucent with decent clarity. Smell is spicy hops up front, slightly piney, big notes of grass and earth with a subdued malt character I get small hints of butterscotch and strawberry, not sure if this is strictly from the malt though. Taste wise the bitterness is not quite as assertive as I thought it was going to be, but in terms of balance it is quite adequate. Personally I might want a slightly more strong malt character/ alcohol to allow for bigger hop function, but as I said before it is well balanced. I guess Ive become so accustomed to what Id consider to be American style IPA where I feel this is more an English style. There is no question this is a very drinkable IPA, the alcohol is low enough to make this very sessionable. Not my favorite, but definitely a solid offering."
"Eric"
"Tastes pretty good, but a little bitter. I normally like hops. I remember liking this beer more than I do now."
"It does have a good mouthfeel as the taste buds acclimate to the aftertaste. This is a tasty hoppy IPA, quite a good one I think."
"Overall not a bad IPA, nothing about this beer really stands out to me and amazes me, but it is what it says it is...no fancy names, just India Pale Ale...That's what it says and that's what you get. A very drinkable beer."
"Pours dark, slightly hazy yellow with a bit of a head. Some lacing remains after the beer is gone, comparable to English bitters. The most noticeable thing is the floral smell of dry hops, which is not overdone and very enticing. Taste is sweet at first, giving way to citrus flavors, lingering hop bitterness, and the floral elements noticed in the smell. Mouthfeel is nice since the beer is not overly carbonated and is very thick. The hops are strong enough that this is firmly an IPA, but they do not dominate the malt characters. A balanced, sessionable IPA."
"it pours a strong dark yellow almost aproaching amber. with a samll head that goes quickly and some lacing left consistently. Very fruity and sweet aroma as well as spciy with hops ver very present and accounted for. Earthy and flowery smell as well. Taste begins smooth and with some maltiness and ends perfectly with a strong hop induced bitterness and some flowery undertones that linger on well after the first sip. A truly inspiring beer. A very refreshing well balanced IPA. Over all a great example of what an IPA is."
"So what gives? Has AB pulled IPA from the shelves in mid-Missouri so it can peddle its own weak Pale Ale with the fake-looking woodsy six pack cartons?"
"Pours a light copper color into pint glass. Decent head and decent lacing. Aroma is overwhelming hops. Very strong aroma. Taste starts bitter than envelops you with a sugary sweetness and then the hops come back in for a bitter bite as it goes down. Finish is a little cloying. Definitely gets better closer to room temperature than fridge temperature. Very drinkable IPA, up there with Bells Two Hearted for very sessionable IPAs."
"This is one of my all time favorite beers. It's light but full of flavor. You really get the taste and smell of fresh hops and citrus whenever you take a sip. It's a great golden color with a fairly decent 2 finger head, not bad for an IPA. All in all I would highly recommend trying this beer, especially on tap!"
"The beer that converted me into a Hop Head. One of my favorite IPAs. This ale pours a vibrant copper hue with a nice head that leaves a fair amount of lace as the beer is consumed. Smell is piney hops with some floral notes. Taste is intense hops. The pine and floral are there in subdued fashion. Mouthfeel is a dry and crisp, but seems to demolisht my palate like a DIPA. One of the my favorite IPAs to drink, another solid Goose Island offering."
"A fine and extremely accessable IPA here. And its affordability is a big plus as well. Reccomended!"
"D - This is a very good American IPA. Another great GI product."
"This easy-to-drink IPA is a great little session beer and another fine product from Goose Island."
"I enjoyed this one. It's full of flavour and easy drinking. A nice introduction to the brewery overall, as it's got me wanting to try more of their stuff."
"Very slight citrus (almost grapefruit) aftertaste"
"The beer pours out a big frothy head that lasts until the end of the beer. The smell is hoppy and a little of for some reason. The taste is very hoppy with some grassy/fruity hops put together to make a very good mix that balances between too citrissy and too grassy. The mouthfeel is very nice and smooth with a slight carbonation that isn't bad on the palate. Overall I liked this beer and will be having more of it."
"pours a deep reddish golden brown with a slight head on it, smells great as the hops release a bouquet of bitterness and spicyness. Tastes good, but isn't as strong of a hopness as expected with an ipa, i was kinda dissapointed expecting an overpowering amount of hops, tasted more like a pale ale than an IPA but it was still a great beer. i hope i can find it on tap as well as in a bottle more often."
"The taste is more of the same; big, over the top hop flavors of pine, floral, and citrus (though the citrus takes a back seat). There is a very subtle malt presence. The finish leaves your mouth extremely dry. I don't know how many of these I'd have in a row. Overall it's a solid, if standard, American IPA. Not much here is bad, but not much stands out, either."
"D: Very good. This IPA is a fantastic go to beer and seems like it was made to compliment spicy food (Fat Willy's Rib Shack in Chicago). The spicy hops and roasty malt meld together excellently. Sessionable!"
"D - This beer helped bring me to the world of craft brewing and it is as tasty as I first remember it."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a golden-copper color with a thick off-white head that coats the glass in lacing. The smell is prominent, primarily of hops; citrus and pine. The taste is heavy on the grapefruit, slightly of pine and finishes smooth. The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with not very much carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, full of taste yet easy to drink. An excellent American IPA."
"Clear light copper/orange with a light, white head. The aroma is nice and hoppy, both citrusy and piney. Starts with a sweet, malty flavor and finishes with a nice piney bitterness. Smooth mouthfeel, this could use a little more carbonation. This is a good, but a little average, IPA, but one I would certainly not turn down."
"A great session beer. Hoppy aroma with a nice head poured on it leaving great lacing down the glass. Has sweet malts which counteract the moderately hoppy brew. Pours a strawberry blond color and has some bite to it. Can't complain for the price and I will make this a regular in my fridge."
"Straight up this beer is one solid well balanced American IPA which caters to both hop fans and the casual drinker."
"A nice, standard American IPA. This one won't blow your socks off, but it's plenty tasty, relatively well-balanced and drinkable IPA. Reminds me off the bat of Wisconsin's Bitter Woman IPA as there's a little biscuity malt mixed in with the hops. Hop flavor is mostly pine with some floral. Worth a try if you like your IPAs on the less-extreme end of the spectrum."
"Drink-ability: A good solid IPA, not very complex,"
"Pours a nice clear golden yellow color, nice carbonation, nice foamy head, some nice sticy lacing afterwards. Scents of hops, slight malts, and some citrus. The taste is nice and hoppy with a slightly dry bitter finish, I like. Medium body. Very drinkable, another great beer from GI. Thanks to jhammerly and BuckEyeNation for the trades."
"D - This is a very well made IPA. The hops are there but are at just the right level to make this the closest thing to a session IPA without it being a regular pale ale."
"This offering from Goose Island pours a foggy dirty blonde that leaves a thick frothy tan head that leaves a sticky residue that stays with this head. The aroma is honey, hops citrus, earthy west coast feel to this IPA. The taste actually starts malty sweet, folllowed by healthy dose of bitterness as not to forget this is a IPA. This IPA continues to take your palate on a herbal, honey, tea, ride and the finish is very nice. This is a quality IPA if it were distributed around here I would have this in my fridge all year."
"Drinkability is also very good. This might be weird to say, but the only complaint I have is that everything about the beer is too middle-of-the-road. It has a predominant pine hop flavor - but not too much. With secondary flavors being too low on the list to register, there isn't much to distinguish this beer from others. I'm sure the problem here is just that I'm not a huge fan of IPA's, and enjoy finding resonating flavors to perk up my interest. So it is only a quible. An extremely smooth & mellow beer, I just wish it was more refreshing."
"D: Very good beer to drink by itself and paired nicely with some good pizza as well. Not the absolute best IPA I have ever had, but certainly a solid choice. If you see it, give it a shot."
"Drinkability is OK. I'll go for this ale again, and I'll try to make sure I get it fresher. For best enjoyment, let beer warm slightly above fridge temp. Cheers!"
"A very drinkable IPA with enough offered to ensure future purchases."
"This beer is an above average ipa. This would make a nice session beer. The beer was a lighter orange with a fair head. There was a little lacing. The smell was hoppy and the taste was predominatly hops as well. There was a lasting bitterness common with the style. I could drink this beer again."
"Overall a nice session IPA that I would probably drink often if it was available to me."
"Will be having a few of these later on today and then bragging about the special purchase of 24/$12.99."
"Thanks, Jimi."
"D: This is a refreshing beer, especially if you're into hops. It's not over the top hoppy, but I think it's a nice version of an IPA and one that I could see myself sessioning."
"the flavor is first most a hopsack backed by a firm chunk of malt. the body is not to heavy or carmelized. lingering citrus flavor sticks with you long after the beer is gone."
"Also, not like it made a difference in my testing, the bottle was well done in that not only did it show the best-by-date, but it also showed what glass it should be served in. Now that's classy."
"In total, a good IPA, and one I would drink again. Not the top shelf, however."
"Opinion: I think that this is a pretty decent beer. I am not a huge fan if Am IPA's, and this is no exception. I respect that the finish isn't chalky like so many of them are when the idiom is use more Gypsum. It is a clean and well crafted beer just the same...I just won't be partaking in it that often."
"Nicely smooth and chewy, bursting with vibrant fresh grapefruit flavor and a touch of sweetness. A very respectable IPA."
"The bartender tapped the hazy amber beverage into a pint glass. Floral hops dominate the aroma with some grain in the background. Tastewise it has less hoppy than I expected but very well balanced. The malt character rounded out the pine bitterness and finished it with crispness. Not knowing too many bars around the area, this was a great bet and this was the finest of the beers that I tried."
"This one is full bodied and solid. Carbonation is decent and drinkability is pretty good, although for me any highly hopped beer gets a little overwhelmig after one or two. The aftertaste is a little too bitter and biting, but other than that, I love this beer."
"Not a bad brew. I could drink a few more, but I think there are better on the market."
"Get my buzz on- y"
"Poured a peachy copper color with a thin half-finger head of bone white foam that slowly falls away to a skinny white ring of lacing. Aroma is light and crisp, grapefruit and big floral hoppiness, paired with a yeasty breadiness. Spicy and grassy undertones with notes of piney hops finish out the nose. Taste is much of the same, grapefruit and floral/grassy hops matched with a sweet caramel-toffee malt balance, appreciative hopping not too much. Slightly drying bitter aftertaste resulting from the hop oils. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium levels of carbonation. Light, crisp and clean are the words that sum up this beer for me, displays all of the characteristics I like to see in a lighter IPA. Drinkability is superb, easy to just kick back a few, less than 6% abv and decent complexity. Recommend trying, would purchase again."
"Goose Island IPA was a slightly hazy orange-amber color with a nice white head. The head had good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was dominated by citrusy hops. The taste was also heavy on the hops from the beginning all the way to the lightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel was good, a medium body with medium carbonation. The drinkabality was great; the good flavor and light bitterness just made me want more. This is a good IPA that I can actually find in my area and will definately purachace again."
"This is simply put a quality brew and I'm thrilled to see more Goose Island beers, other than the also good Honker's and Nut Brown starting to be available in my area."
"Medium golden body, clean, with a respectable amount of eggshell white head. Light fruit with toffeeish malt over pleasingly bitter pine, Scotch tape, and citrus hops. Toffee malt up front with fruity shades mid-palate. Hops come in, not over the top, but forthright with solid pine and pineapple flavors. Finish is dry. Creamy feel on a medium body. Appetizing and refreshing. A solid, sessionable IPA."
"Just like the Honkers Ale, I was able to enjoy this Goose Island choice with some great deep dish pizza. Not too hoppy, but a good balance for those in my party who wanted to try it. I'll call it a could ""starter"" IPA. Easy to drink, nice carbonation, and one I would order again when I'm in the greater Chicago area."
"Overall a nice AIPA. Good overall spiciness but the mild sweetness put me off a bit. Still, makes this beer very quaffable."
"Overall, Goose Island IPA is a good beer, yet not as bold and complex as Stone IPA, Victory IPA and Great Divide IPA. Funny thing, I still drink a six pack."
"D: Good thirst-quencher."
"Edit: just revisited this beer 9-7-08. Still an awesome beer. Great clarity in the apricot colored brew. Nice floral/citrus hop nose and taste. Hop twang is balanced by the sweet malt background. A medium mouthfeel with good carbonation makes this one to enjoy again and again. I modified some of my original ratings to reflect my latest sample. Highly recommended"
"D: Highly drinkable. I could drink these all night long. A great session IPA as the abv is quite low. Goose Island has great offerings."
"Probably not extreme enough for some hopheads but this is textbook IPA. Nice product by Goose Island."
"Appearance is a cloudy super carbonated dull amber with little head. Nose is very roasted for an IPA with little hops apparent. Taste is ok with hops up front. Mouthfeel is carbonated at first with some malt finish. I was not impressed by this one, hopefully a bad bottle in which I have more off which I will review if better."
"A decent ipa with subtle flavoring. Give this one to your pals that aren't all about the hops and it will be enjoyed."
"The appearance is golden to pale in color and brilliantly clear with a strong long lasting white head. The flavor is malty and well balanced with a nice dose of hops. This high gravity beer hides its alcohol well and has a nice bitter finish also it is medium bodied and appropriately carbonated. Overall, this is a classic example of an Americanized IPA. British IPA fans will be disappointed with this beer's American hop profile. This beer is great straight from Goose Island's tap."
"Pours a nice nectar orange with a head that settles nicely as the session progresses. The aroma is of pungent hops and citrus berry. A hint of honey will stick to the nose. The taste is smooth, with a nice hit of the hop character to balance the sweet nectar honey. Very nice offering, could drink this again."
"The taste left something to be desired, as it didn't seem quite as hoppy as it did in the smell. The malt base is a little dull, somewhat biscuity with subdued hops on top of it. Doesn't really stand out, and it's less than assertive."
"after having a few bottles of this beer over the last few days I decided to rate this. ffrom the bottle, poured copper with a nice off white head with some lacin. aroma a nice sweet hoppness comes out first, than caramel, orange, some floral. flavor a dry hop spicey, some malts sneak out, couldnt get the sweetness or caramel I got in the aroma. This has got to be one of the better IPAs I have had from a bottle no harshness just a nice smooth beer Glad I picked up a 6er bad thing is I am drinking my last bottle have to get more."
"Mouthfeel is hoppily spiced and sweet at the front of the tongue leading to a medium bodied balanced brew."
"Pours out with a slim head, fast dissipation. Color is deep gold/ light copper, very clear. Aroma of tangy, grassy hops comes through, but could be stronger. The taste has nutty caramel malt undertones to match the nice hop flavor. Solid bitter finish with a slight roasted character and spiciness. Mouthfeel is light, but avoids being watery, adequate carbonation. Solid IPA with a good malt flavor for balance. Definitely not an explosion of hops, if that's what you are looking for, but nice indeed..."
"This is a great beer. A real treat at the end of a hot day. Probably too rich for most to enjoy more than a couple in one sitting, but definately allows for quality over quantity. It is by far and away my favorite American single IPA, and ive had more than a few in this style. This beer has turned me back on to Goose Island, after being silly enough to take the claim on their oatmeal stout bottle seriously that it would make me forget all other oatmeal stouts. It didnt. But this IPA has made all the others ive tried a whole lot less memorable."
"Hopheads are likely to disappointed, but I like IPAs with some malty balance, which this one has. A good beer to introduce someone to the style."
"Drinkability/Overall: With a well-traveled palate, I can easily recognize this as a balanced, well-made IPA. Big, juicy and imminently drinkable."
"Six pack was purchased in package store in Omaha and consumed in Dallas. Light amber color with some haziness. Medium white head that dissipated rather quickly, but still left lacing on glass. Noticeable, but not overpowering hop character in both aroma and taste. Doesn't knock your socks off with hop utilization like many American IPAs try to. Maltiness is nicely balanced with hops. Everything in this beer has been done in moderation and the result is a very drinkable beer. I will stock up on it whenever possible."
"Body is medium, creamy, and very easy to enjoy. By buddy brought me back a few of these from Chi, I will enjoy them!"
"A decent IPA but nothing too special. Since I like hoppy beers this is a little lower by my ranking but this is an ok beer."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle that's looks a little different than the picture above ... presents itself as a medium gold color with a rocky white head that stands tall. Lots of lacing in the pint glass. Nose is of citrusy hops, piney, and somewhat sweet. Palate is a very good balance of hop astringency and malty sweetness. Definitely an IPA, in that it leans heavily toward the hop presence, but isn't overpowering. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, some lingering sweetness on the tongue. To me, this is a great ""standard"" American style IPA ... very, very drinkable. This one is one of my staple beers that I like to have on hand at all times. Doesn't challenge you, but always satisfies the thirst for a good hoppy IPA. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Light body, good hoppiness and mid level alcohol make it a pretty easy drinker."
"Notes: A good IPA that is well worth your time."
"Light mouthfeel, easy drinking despite the metallic taste."
"D - Pretty good beer, but nothing special."
"Very enjoyable IPA. One of the tops in my book."
"Purchased from Consumer's Beverage Center on Elmwood in Kenmore, but they have them at a couple other locations, too. 12-ounce twist-off bottle, says to pour into a tulip glass. I don't have one, so this went into a 17-ounce snifter. Orange amber with a sticky white head, plenty of lacing, even after the foam settles to a thin cover. Nose is appropriately floral, citric, and piney, with a bit of underlying caramel malt sweetness. There is, however, very little sweetness to speak of in the taste. Rather, there is a bitter pine and grapefruit pith flavor up front with a toasted biscuit finish. No mineral content. Hops are right there the whole way through. Clean, snappy mouthfeel with a medium body. Not too juicy and just dry enough. Much better than I expected. I'm happy we're able to get a couple Goose Island beers here in Western New York now (this one and the Honker's Ale), but I'm hoping the price will come down a bit. Good, but not quite worth $10 a six-pack."
"Very solid IPA, not great, but something you can always fall back on if the store doesn't have what you were really looking for. Being in the Midwest this summer and having access to Goose Island will be nice, and this beer will definitely become a regular. The price is right also."
"To me, this is just your run-of-the-mill IPA. I guess that's what I was expecting from Goose Island, reliably good (not great) beer. Originally from Michigan (Kraftbrau, Bells, Darkhorse, Short's), I'm accustomed to a much hoppier beer to be labeled ""IPA."""
"Mouthfeel is light, slick, and vapory. The intensity of this beer along with a heavy feeling in the gut makes it hard to rate drinkability high, but I have to since I usually go for two. This beer rocks."
"Bottom line: good solid IPA."
"Last swigs: Perfect session IPA. Gets the hop head satisfaction in an easy way."
"Pours copper with decent clarity. Two finger head, off-white and creamy. Shows decent retention and many stubbord patches of lace. Fresh and hoppy aroma- citrus and grapefruit, with a faint toasted pale malt background. The pale malt is strong at first sip, then lost in a sea of cascade, centennial and chinook riptides. full of hop flavor, but the acidity is mild. Dry aftertaste with loads of oily bitterness. Medium carbonation in a light body accentuate the dry and bitter mouthfeel, but gracefully fades and the finish is mild-mannered. The balance sways towards the bitter end of the spectrum, but west coast IPA fans will love it."
"Drank very easy. Just a little too restrained to warrant better grades. Still a nice IPA with no pretense"
"Pours rich golden with a thin head, good retention,and nice lacing. Lots of bubbles.Aroma is of hops,with a hint of spiced fruit. Body is medium, and carbonated. Taste is hops from start to finish. This beer may not be the most well balanced, but it's good tasting,and refreshing. A winner!"
"Very fine carbonation accentuates the hops nicely. Extremely drinkable and a regular favorite of mine. A classic U.S. I.P.A. Best before date of 9/3/06"
"This is a very drinkable beer, and an excellent example of the style. A good, well above average, IPA and would certainly have it again."
"I will say though that I did enjoy drinking this beer, and it's a fairly good IPA"
"Overall a pretty drinkable IPA in that it is not too strong (ABV) and the hops character is nice and pronounced without being overly bitter for those who don't like a ton of hops."
"Pours a hazy golden-orange hue topped by one finger of creamy white head. Appealing zesty aroma of spicy, bitter American hops, some light malt, and a touch of citrus. Palate is mostly nice bittering hops, a touch of light sweet malt, and notes of citrus and pepper. Body is nice, pleasant and well-carbonated, if slightly foamy. Easy-drinking for such an assertively-hopped beer. Great on a spring afternoon."
"This beer has an extremely hoppy aroma, with a hint of a fruity, citrus-like... smell. Served in the correctly assigned glass (tulip-glass, as per the label), it has a suprisingly long head retention and fantastic visual appearance. Very drinkable and good with pastas and as a summer beer. Drinkability is a definite."
"Goose Island IPA pours a hazy orange with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is definitely hoppy. The taste is also hoppy, with some citrus notes. I liked this one, quite a drinkable IPA. Definitely worth a try. Goose Island is definitely making some interesting beers."
"Drinkability - this goes down easy, but diacetyl taste diminishes this ale for me."
"Very easy drinking brew, and I never finished one without wanting another. I liked this IPA because it was on the low end of the high-hopped IPAs. Call me crazy, but when I ask for an IPA, I don't want a Double IPA. Since this beer wasn't as bitter as other IPAs, it was easy to down a couple in a row. Still, it was complex enough to keep me interested."
"In my pint glass, the beer appeared a soft, translucent orange in color with rust colored hues throughout. An eggshell colored head of medium size developed and lingered for a bit leaving behind bits of lacing. Fair to medium level of carbonation. Aromas of citrus, grapefruit, butter, and hard candy. The taste was quite hoppy with a strudy malt presence that gains strength in the middle and continues on into the finish. Somewhat balanced, but still a hoppy beer with loads of citrus fruit juicy flavors covering my mouth. A bit slick in my mouth with a nice refreshing core. Flavorful and refreshing with considerable bite makes this a beer to have repeatedly."
"Overall this is an inoffensive IPA. It is decent but unremarkable."
"Here's the thing... I thought this was a good beer but it didn't seem to have the big body, or the large amount of fortifying hops that I've come to expect in an IPA."
"Overall: The complexity of the beer makes it worthwhile but the flavor seems to be out of joint in comparison to the strength of the aroma."
"D: I could sit down and drink two in a row with a meal. However, I don't know what that meal would be."
"Dark gold color with a white head. Almost no carbonation bubbles. Smell is classic American IPA. Nice pine and citrus notes. Taste falls a little short of the smell, some pine but not very big. Noticable bready malt flavors. This has a bitter finish that you would expect but it is a little on the harsh side (and i normally enjoy a nice bitter finish). Also a little thin on the mouthfeel. Overall a nice IPA but not great. I could see drinking this if it was readily available and the price was right."
"EDIT: I have to add, a following glass with a vigorous pour yeiled a good head that indeed did lace quite well, so don't be afraid to pour this."
"This brew pours a clear bronze color with ruby tints. The head is two fingers in height, and recedes rather slowly into thick lacing. The aroma is very storng without being overpowering. Cirtus hops dominate the nose, but there is some interesting and appealing earthy barnyard funk in the back ground. The sip begins with juicy hop then fades into some nice funk for a split second before morphing into a bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a very good IPA, but not quite great. I will certainly drink this again."
"Would certainly pick up another if I need a standard IPA, but nothing I'm writing home about."
"A golden orangish color, with a white head, that is a quater inch high developes. Piney and earty aromas come trhough at first scent, followed by some citrusy aromas. There is a slight taste of malt at the beginning, then the hops take over from there, with some good bitterness and a citrus aftertaste at the end. The feel is medium bodied, but leaves a nice dry finish at the end. This beer is true to the style, immense hop flavor and aroma in a glass."
"This IPA is maybe just a little too full and heavy on the tongue, but it doesn't get out of hand paired with the equally just a little too high carbonation. It does bring the drinkability down a little. Overall this is a really nice English style IPA, a solid representation of the style from a brewery that always seems to hit things right in the middle. Not the best out there, but far far from the worst. A nice beer to keep around for fans of English IPAs."
"It's a nice enough IPA but nothing outstanding in many ways... This is a lot closer to an APA in body and character with just a little more hopping. Good and in some ways memorable but there are a number of nicer IPAs out there."
"Da solid IPA, would buy a 6 pack to enjoy in a sitting."
"Drinkability: This is a very solid IPA. This beer has remained in my beer line up for a long time. This is not the hoppiest IPA on the market but you could do far worse than Goose Island. Overall a very drinkable IPA."
"Disclaimer: A fresh Goose Island IPA is sublime. Do not let this review affect your purchasing or views of that version. Mmmmm, fresh Goose Island IPA . . ."
"A solid all around IPA, if a bit on the abrasive side."
"Drinkability: Drinking multiple bottles is no problem. Again, very smooth, very tasty. The hop aftertaste lingers for a while, then fades and leaves you wanting another drink."
"Notes: As Ive started to review, Ive had a difficult time reviewing to style and not personal taste. (Something that will get easier with time and experience.) Well IPAs are my personal taste and this one is right on. A great (single) IPA alone or with food."
"Thanks to bditty187 for this one."
"Taste- Starts out with and grapefruit hops flavor that leads into a more snap, crackle, pop of hops. Can't classify the hops bitterness at this particula point on the tongue, but it's good none the less. Ends with the only real notice of bread dough, crystal malts in this great IPA."
"This beer is light-medium bodied on the palate and resembles water in a way. The amount of carbonation is appropriate for the style, and it is easy to drink. It leaves the mouth feeling dry as well. Overall this is an ok beer, but I wouldn't buy it again. There are so many better IPAs on the market, why would I buy one that is not nearly as good as the others? I would only buy this again if I was craving an IPA and this was the only one within miles. I expected more from this beer. When I sat down to try this I was looking forward to a great IPA, but instead I only got a mediocre one."
"Verdict- It's not an amazingly complex or dynamic pale ale, but it's a good middle-of-the-road beer."
"All in all an excellent IPA."
"will drink more in the future"
"Refreshing on the palate, but all bitter and hops. A decent session beer, but not the best of this style. Touch of rosemary and grapefruit on the palate... bitter on the backend with lingering effects."
"I love this beer. I really, really wish I could find it here in MA. My next trip to the Midwest will include a case of this stuff for future enjoyment."
"Drinkability: very easy drinking IPA, as this can be consumed all afternoon."
"This one poured with a white, fluffy head that was disappointingly a little choppy, lacking consistency. The color was a nice golden bronze with a nose that clearly involves hops straight out of the northwest. Certainly high citrus and grapefruity notes are present in the aroma. Its a sturdy, medium-bodied brew with a sharp hoppy context. There is a clear grapefruit presence with a floral bouquet mulling in the background. Just a tad of off-setting maltiness serves as a creamy addition. It finishes bitter and grainy dry that's more lemony and sweet then the mouthfeel. Solid IPA."
"On tap at the Clyborne brew pub. Clear yellow color with a foamy white head. Very nice fresh piney hop smell. Full mouthfeel. Has a nice grainy malt taste that is quickly overtaken by a tasty PacNW hop flavor. Not overly bitter or harsh, a good ipa here, very drinkable."
"Ill remember this one come next spring/summers drinking sessions."
"M&D: I like the way the lightly spicy texture blends with the medium-strength hoppyness (by American standards) plus a subtly fizzy body, the palate and mouthfeel of this beer is just ideal as a more-ish IPA. Not as big, thick, and complex as many more audacious American IPAs, but I suppose it's like a reasonably flavoursome session beer in America as is a Best Bitter in Britain~~ Nice!"
"~I'd get a 6'er of this stuff, I suppose."
"Pours a murky apricot color with your average head. Lots of citrus in the nose, piney, with a butterscotch undertone. Definitely a west-coast IPA. The taste is subtler than the smell, and there is an initial sweetness that morphs into the hoppy grapefruit sourness. The finsih is slightly bready, and there is more carbonation than I expected. A good, solid IPA."
"BB 06-07-06. Nice head and a golden beer with fine haze. Nose is very hoppy, american caqracter and overall very piny and citrussyfruity. Some malts there in the back but overall a very green nose. As is taste that also depend majorly on hop cracter but has a nice sweet malty touch and is overall very refreshing and easy drinkable. Fine but not overdone carbonisation makes it a very balanced IPA and gives it an overall plesant and great mouthfeel. Yes this is a very fine brew and for american standards very balanced brew, BTW not many IPA's available in the netherlands and very glad to see this one has arrived."
"No big surprise here. Like most IPA's this is pretty neutral and not worth chasing down. It has real nice malty taste and a good hop mix with a touch of grapefruit like citrus and a spicy nose nose but it is a little grassy. Good for the local market and I would hessitate to get one if you see it and want a standard session IPA."
"The body is a medium grade and good drinkable score. I thought this was a great session IPA. Not a hop heads best but still very good."
"This is the first American IPA I've had the pleasure of sampling and it is definitely hoppier than the Englis versions I've tried. Very herbal tasting with notes of oak. Light malt body and very fruity.Clean and refreshing but very substantial at the same time. I think I've found my ideal summer beer. I' too lazy to poor this beer right now as I would have to was the glass, however I think that every beer becomes baeutiful if it tastes good, so it really doesn't matter. Recommended."
"overall: overall a pretty average to slightly above average ipa. taste isn't overly complex. great hop character with hardly a balance in the malts. would make an excellent session. must try if you can get your hands on one, and can drink all night if it's more easily accessible to you. thanks to mlh1227 for the try."
"Update  The big biscuity hops are really the story here, but its still a well-balanced AIPA. It was nice when I had it and rated it in 2005, and this 2006 vintage is more of the same."
"As fantome would probably say - ""you've come full circle"". Poured out to a nice orange amber color with a huge white foamy head and rings of lace around the glass. This beer just looks good. Makes you want it. Smell is great; aromas of hops, spice, herbs and citrus fill the nose. Taste is solid; flavors of citrus dominate, with a hoppy backbone that is supported by the complexity of hints spice and light pine. Mouthfeel was good; this wasn't too heavy or filling, the way a good pale ale should be. Good level of drinkability, this would be a great summer brew or even winter brew for that matter. There will always be space in my beer cellar for this brew. Recommended."
"Session? OH YEA!"
"Drinkability- On of the better IPA's from the recent stash I brought back from Washington. Would purchase again if it were available here."
"I remember having this at the clyborne brewery and it wasn't too great, it seems to be much better bottled, good job Goose."
"-UF"
"Nice head retention, fantastic color, aroma is possibly the highlight of this brew - very nice combination of malt and hops. an excellent beer and a bargain at 6.99 a six pack."
"Try it if you haven't. And throw a six of the fresh stuff in the fridge if you have and show your uneducated beer friends that IPA's can be simple and not palate assaulting."
"Pours a nice clear copper color with a bubbling 3 finger head that slowly falls but never departs. The nose is very nice. A balance between spicey, fruity, sweet hop and caramel malt base. I like the hop profile on this. Not too strong in any one direction, but with a lot going on in it. Flavor is not as nice as the nose. The hop is mostly spicey to a touch earthy over top a solid caramel base. Good balance, but not popping enough in the hop. It could shine, but it is a slight disappointment. The feel is moerate, with a light to moderate carbonation. The slighly light carbonation is probably from my aggressive pour. I'll have to try it in a standard pint next time. Overall, a very solid brew. I'm drinking it very quickly, so it can't be all that bad."
"Drinkable and worth a try if you like a kick of hops."
"Very nice beer, great low price, and and an easy drinker. Definite session material as with almost all Goose Island beers."
"Drinkability: One thing I look forward to in an IPA is a long-lasting finish, usually very hop-dominant, which I didnt really get much of from this beer. That was its biggest downfall. Otherwise, its a fairly good beer."
"Drinkability is very good on this always consistant IPA, not overly bitter like some, this is one of my favorite session beers."
"A fantastic IPA. Copper in colour with loads of leafy hops, citrus, and pine notes. Grapefruit and white grape flavors abound. A fair amount of malt and bitterness as well. I could see some fans of really bitter IPAs thinking this one is a bit on the tame side, but it strikes a near-perfect balance for me. This is one I really wish I could get locally."
"I think its a very drinkable beer but it didn't impress me."
"Paid $1.00 for a bottle"
"Overall, a decent IPA. Kinda clashed in the taste and I have no idea what was up with the appearance. Plenty of better IPA's at my beck and call for me to miss this one."
"Though IPAs are not my favorite style of beer, this is a beer I will probably drink again."
"Overall - An excellent IPA , one of my favourites... highly recommended !!!"
"A very drinkable IPA. It would make a fine session beer. If not the first Goose Island beer I have purchased, it is the first I've actually gotten around to drink. So far, I am impressed."
"Drinkability is good. Just some old fashioned clean and refreshing stuff. Sessionable for sure."
"This was brought back to Houston for me by a friend that traveled to Chicago on business. Pours a nice copper colour with a good frothy head that disappaits to a thin, white layer across the top. A nice hoppy flavour and aroma with good balance between hop and malt flavours. Bitterness is not as strong as other IPA's. A medium smooth mouthfeel with a slightly dry finish. A very decent and drinkable IPA."
"A clean yellow beer with orange highlights. Has a big foamy white head. The aroma has a big spicey peppery hop boquet. The flavor is mostly a tea like sweetness that blends out to a dry hop finish. The aroma got me all pumped up. The taste left me dissapointed."
"This beer poured a very nice orange amber color with a fluffy/cramy white head. The aroma wasn not strong for this. What I could smell was a bitey floral-like citrus astringency smell. The taste was full of sharp hops, that over-took the palatte. The was very little if any malt flavor. The mouth feel was very sharp and bubble like a macro brew. Large bitey feeling. This would be an Ideal session beer. Light flavor, light body. good flavor. But not my favorite I.P.A."
"Pours golden to copper in color. Head fairly quickly dissipates with a thin film of foam left on the top. Aroma is definitely of grapefruit. First sip reveals a strong grapefruit citrusy flavor. Mouthfeel is odd with an almost oily feeling in the first sip. Second sip gives more bitterness than grapefruit. Not much malty balance to this. Further sips reveal a bit more watery mouthfeel. An acceptable version of the IPA not great."
"I ~think~ this was the beer that introduced me to IPAs years back. Either way, whatever memories I have from back then were supplanted this past week. Orange-reddish pour, light, really bubbly, with a foamy off-white head that stuch around. Strong hops on the nose, biting pine, perhaps a bit too strong but worked in the hot weather. About the same on the tongue but giving way to a slight maltiness toward the finish. Not like the IPAs I enjoy now but a fond memory."
"Finishes dry and hop sticky. This a full bodied medium and worth a few."
"For me, the return to this IPA is like a surprise visit from an old friend. It fits like a glove and is as comfortable as a worn pair of shoes. It's comfort food in a glass and immediately brightens any day. Every sip takes me back to my first day of kindergarten (at least beer-wise)."
"Happy to find this one still available at the Blind Tiger in NYC, on tap.Poured a light-medium shade of amber, slight haze, off white head and nicely developed lacing. Floral hoppy nose, also plenty of piney hop goodness. This is a well hopped IPA, but its not over the top. The hops are punget and taste very fresh and flavorful, but they do not over power this beer or your taste buds. Well hopped yet still nicely balanced and highly drinkable brew. Smooth, soft mouthfeel. Nice quaffer, seek out and enjoy this one on tap."
"NIcely done example of the style I'll return to when I want a change of pace from the huge hop bombs."
"This beer was medium bodied at best, and moderately drinkable. For an IPA, it was nice, but nothing to write home about."
"Well this beer comes highly recommended to me. The beer pours orangish amber in color with ample light beige head. The aroma is a nice balance of floral hops, caramel malt, and fruity yeast. The flavor is upfront bitterness followed by a solid caramel toffee sweetness and a lingering hop finish. This is what an IPA should be hoppy and balanced, and thusly very drinkable."
"I know you won't be too mad if I spend this night with my Goose Island IPA. We can share her. Just don't steal her away. I can't afford to lose any more beer lovin' to you..."
"Brilliant medium amber, full white head dissipates somewhat, but has nice lacing. Intense hop aroma, mainly citrus and pine, light maltiness and a hint of alcohol. Strong bitterness after the first sip, but stays well balanced with citrus hop flavour and malt. Slight alcohol warmth. Finishes medium dry. Medium/light body and carbonation, slightly creamy texture. Very nice IPA. Thanks Viggo!"
"Drinkability: Excellent. I could drink (and have drank) many of these in an evening."
"This beer pours a golden yellow. It has a thick fluffy white head, with a slight yellow tint to it. It fades slowly leaving too few laces. The first scent I detect is a piney floral one. It smells hoppy. It has a citrus scent also. I also detect faint hints of lemon. It tastes piney. It has a citrus taste with slight fruit flavors making an apperance. It is not as hoppy as the aroma led me to believe. The flavor is actually quite mild. I think this might be a good beer for people, like myself, who do not usually drink hoppy beers. It leaves a piney taste on the palate. It goes down smooth. It is carbonated very well. I think this beer would make a good session beer because for an IPA, it is somewhat mild. Also, it is not high in alcohol. If you get a chance to try this one, give it a shot. You will probably be glad you did. Thanks to Mentor for providing this beer."
"I was surprised and impressed by the delicate and soft nature of this beer's flavor and body. Not pungent or bitter at all and only a hint of dryness. The malt is showcased well with the hops still taking most of the spotlight. Very balanced and is better suited for the 'Pale ale' (not IPA) category. Still a good offering from Goose."
"Nicely drinkable beer."
"Best by 102605"
"A tasty, amazingly refreshing ipa, well worth the money. Also goes great with spicy food, cuts through the heat so well. You end up getting cooled and refreshed from the heat, and the hops cut through enough that you have a strong flavoured beer even paired with such aggressive food"
"Pours a clear copper color. A half inch head holds on for the entire ride. This beer is not overly aromatic but has a good smell. For me floral hops and citrus come out in the nose. The flavor is refreshing. I can detect citrus along with the bitterness from the hops. It finishes well balanced. The beer feels medium bodied as it should but it also seems to feel a bit acidic which can take away from the enjoyment. This is a highly drinkable and all around well crafted session beer. I could see getting this again in the future. It is a good brew to relax with when you feel like something simple yet tasty. It also went great with the New York strip steak I grilled up for dinner."
"12 oz bottle obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) and consumed the same evening (May 2005). Pours a 1.5 finger off-white clingy head over a light rust-orange liquid. Just a hint of chill haze. Smells co-ho citrus hop during the pour. Rich Amarillo hoppy. Citrusy and cotton candy. Orange and tangerine, not grapefruit. Sweet is quite below the hops. Pear and apricot. Tastes bitter hoppy carried later by a malt sweet then arises a floral hoppy from the back and concludes withe a delightful toasty & nutty. Really a nice progression. No single flavor is over the others and the flavors overall are pleasant. Great, as so many IPAs are 'in your face' hoppy. The middle, after the inital hops had some pear and apricot (not quite apricot...more honey-like, as if it was apricot jelly). This beer is tasty quality and highly quaffable. Md-light mouthfeel that has a creamy quality about it and is mildly carbonated with fine bubbles forming on the entire flat of the tongue and making an acrid burn in the aftertaste on the sides of my tongue."
"Drinkability: Gimmie. Lots. I'd say this is better than the regular goose pale. If I could get this rather than Goose pale, I'd get this."
"D- This is a well built beer. It has good hops but not huge hops and the malt is caramelized enough to give it a nice base. Very good for a session beer or a summer grilling' brew. Goose Island really hit a strong beer with this one."
"It is growing on me now that half the glass is gone. It is very drinkable and since it is not real expensive it would be a good beer to stock up on for the summer."
"Out of the bottle and into the glass. Head cascades to the top and sits atop the beer for most of the ride and leaves some impressive lacing. Body is a clear, dark gold. Smells of floral, mostly a floral aroma with citrus following behind, and then behind that too is the malt that does not want to be pushed aside by the hops. First drink, I'm surprised by how much of the malt comes through, but lets the hops come through too. Sweet malt over your tongue, but before you can get sick of the sugars, butter and caramels, you are greeted with the citrus, deep bitters and earthy tones of the hops. Nothing too hopped, too light or too malty. Will probably revisit this beer in the future."
"Hazy apricot color with an off-white foamy head that does not rise too high, and sinks quickly to nothing. Aroma is bright and fresh, sweet citrus hops, and a bit of pine. Mild flavor, initially malty, not too strong upfront, but moving to citrusy hops, some bitter orange peel, and some bitter pine. Finishes crisp, a little carbonation tingle, and a sweet tangerine aftertaste lingers long around the mouth."
"A kick ass beer! Big hops and tasty malts equal a great drinking beer."
"Pours a golden hue with a generous amount of head. Note quite crystal clear, but close. Aroma of piney and citrous hops, leafy and floral. A little malt in the nose as well. I'll have to admit I was a little let down by the taste. Although by no means was it bad, it was simply a middle of the road example of an IPA. The trademark hops were there in the usual fashion, as well as a faint presence of toasted malt. Decent mouthfeel, easily quaffed. Dry hoppy finish. Not a bad beer to have at a bar or sitting with friends, but it is nothing remarkable."
"Bottle: Poured a medium lightly hazed gold with a fair tight cap. Soft carbonation. Aroma of grapefruit, apricots and sweet malts. Viscous mouth feel...good malt spine gives a sweetish biscuity taste where mild hops and the yeasts add an apricot taste that turns bitter in the finish...very nice.. I like this IPA... wasnt expecting this from GIB."
"Good medium mouthfeel to this very drinkable brew."
"A drinkable balanced IPA that isn't over the top and tuned to please a hophead. This is brewed closer to the British version of the IPA than the American version. Very drinkable"
"Pale gold, thin white head, little lacing. Aroma is hoppy and floral, a little nutty. Tastes pretty good, but not the hop bomb that I look for in an IPA. Grapefruit, pine resins, good malt presense becoming more noticeable as it warms. Mouthfeel is thin and a little oily. As I mentioned this is not a hop monster. I find it to be a little lacking if this is a single, but because it is not overhopped it makes for a pretty tasty session brew."
"D&N: Not bad, not great. Too fizzy for me to like, sort of a Unibroue feel to it."
"Pours with an off white head over clear amber gold liquid. Rich, super hopped nose with sweet background. Fresh floral hops wash over the palate, leaving a pleasant bitterness behind. The finish is long and bittersweet. Nicely bitter without the over the top hopping seen in other IPA's."
"This is not an IPA for strict hopheads, but it is nice if you're in the mood for a change. The key here is variety over strength, and this very interesting blend of hops works great."
"Drinkability: A good beer, nonetheless not quite what I was hoping for. I had hoped for more hops, yet felt if only slightly more hopped than the Honkers. Will I purchase this one seperate? Only on sale and if the Honkers is out of stock."
"This was quite a pleasant surprise. This IPA was probably the least hoppy I've tasted, but nonetheless it was still wonderful. The beer pours to a dark golden color, resembling more of a Pale Ale than an IPA. The head is moderate, and doesn't last long, but neither will the liquid if your experience is like mine. The taste is of hops, but not overly hoppy as some IPA's tend to be. The Pale Ale taste still shows through in the aftertaste. I will definately drink more of this, particularly during the change from Winter to Summer when I will still be craving hops, but won't quite want such a heavy brew."
"Picked up a Goose Island pub pack, always had pretty good brews for the price. Their IPA pours a light amber colour, with some haze and residue in the bottom of the bottle, I think probably from dryhopping. Lots of white head and lots of lacing. Smells very hoppy, kind of like Cascades with a little bit of maltiness but majority is hops. Tastes hoppy as well, with a very pleasant bitterness, a bit of a toffee smoothness to it as well. Very good taste, and quite refreshing. The mouthfeel is nice and smooth, with plenty of carbonation. Drinkability is very high, good for any time of the year, I recommend it wholeheartedly."
"Its a nice enough beer and drinkable..but not very exciting."
"Goose Island India Pale Ale is a rock solid IPA, if this is your fair you will be right at home."
"Pours a clear golden pils color with some orangy tinges to it. Thin white head that dissipates quickly. Subtle sprucy hops and a honeyed malt profile with some underlying fruitiness. Rather balanced and soft, easily drinkable and not very aggressive compared to some other monster-of-an-IPAs that are out there. This is my first Goose Island beer I've tried, and it's pretty good IPA. I'm looking forward to trying more of their beers in the future."
"Just a really, really good standard IPA, proving again that a beer doesn't have to be 15% alcohol to be good, and also proving that the folks as Goose Island know what they're doing. I'd heartily recommend this one."
"Drinkability: A highly drinkable IPA. Very good. Enough to keep the palate interested and aroused but not so much that it blasts your tongue into oblivion for the evening. If someone is looking for a nice, hoppy crossover, I would definitely steer them in this direction. Good stuff."
"Very drinkable, one of my favorite IPAs, can be paired with any food at any occasion. Can be found anywhere in Chicagoland at very cheap prices. ABV isn't too high, so you can pack these puppies away and not worry."
"During drinking, in the middle you will taste the malt usage in brewing. The aftertaste is quite better. (Again, the hop lovers dream) I would recommend it. Although, it's a beer that I do like having one or two a day. But not something I can consistantly drink on an all night basis."
"Much better on draft than in the bottle."
"Pours a golden color with a medium white head that has good retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is hoppy with some slight fruits and a bit of malt. The flavor has a caramel malt backing with a strong hop presence. Well balanced. This was a pretty good IPA and easy to drink."
"Drinkability: At $5.99 a sixer at certain locales, this may be the best IPA on the market around Chicago (where I live). This stuff is simply divinely-inspired. Kudos to the folks who've made real beer a way of life for the past 16 years."
"12 ounce bottle. A well made IPA."
"The Goose Island India Pale Ale pours out a goodlooking amber with a smallish off-white head. The aroma is of citrus hops and a good malt backbone. Nice lacing down the glass and an unstoppable citrus flavor. Nicely bitter with a bitter finish. Good drinkability and a solid mouthfeel from the ample carbonation."
"Final Thought: This and Magic Hat Hi.P.A. are in their own league when it comes to IPA's... outstanding beer and Goose is now 4 for 4."
"Drinkability: This is one of my old stand-bys. A very solid IPA, and bitter enough to impress any hophead. At 5.9%, it's got a mild alcoholic bite to it, and still is highly quaffable. You can tell Goose Island puts a lot of work into their brews. This is one IPA I recommend anyone to try."
"This is about as averagely hoppy as the Golden Summer Ales that British brewers are currently making as fast as the British can consume them. This does, however, have a very fruity malt base, which the Golden Summer Ales do not have. The fruity malt is a beautiful counterpoint to the citric hops, and tastes very English if just a little syrupy. The hops seem to be the main thing here, and they are very tasty. I assume the hops are American because we have no hops this sharp in Britain. Very enjoyable."
"Man, I wish I had a sixer of this, as opposed to only one more bottle. Darn good IPA here, very flavorful, but not so overwhelming that it couldn't be a good session brew."
"Pours an attractive hazy copper hue under a one finger white head that fades very slowly and leaves some good looking lace. The nose is almost caramel sweet to go with some nice flowery hops. The mouth is mildly carbonated and fairly heavy, although not sticky. There's some nice smooth malt to open, followed by a mild but insistent hoppy bite. Citrus and flower blend together well to give a smooth as silk impression to the hops, without a lot of bitterness and nothing overwhelming. A good middle-of-the-road IPA. Sure, I'll have another!"
"Pours out a nice clear golden orange with a small head that lingers only for a few minutes. Has a piney hop aroma to it along with some maltiness. Upon first sip there is a enjoyable hop flavor that tastes a bit piney as well. Pleasently bitter with warm malt undertones. Seems to be a bit lacking in body, but overall the mouthfeel is good and allows for easy drinking. After a few sips the bitterness comes through on the back of the palate a bit stronger...but not overwhelming. IPA is one of my fave styles and drinkability is high on this one...it has a solid flavor and a sixer is not too expensive...making it a good session brew."
"Delicious IPA, very straightforward and while not especially comples, exactly what I expect when I think IPA."
"A hazy apricot tone on the pour, not much of a head, but it forms a frothy ring and leaves some lacing. All hops on the nose, orange/lemon/grapefruit zest. The hops don't leave any room for malt in the flavour as well, this is a very citric IPA, starting with notes of orange and tangerine, and finishing more with grapefruit rind, with a sticky pine aftertaste. Still enjoyable for the hops alone though, if you're into that, they are not overwhelmingly bitter, but predominate the taste. Mouthfeel is a tad watery, but this is an easy drinker, I feel satisfied. A bit one-dimensional over all, or very lopsided. Yet I keep going back for more until the glass is empty. As it warms up some malt finally manages to break through the brick wall of hops, adding a little more character. Thanks to northyorksammy for holding on to this for me for so long."
"This ale pours a hazy golden brown with a thin head. The smell is divine, very sweet and hoppy, with almost a banana-like quality to it. The taste is refreshingly tart. While not my favorite IPA (Bell's Two-Hearted Ale probably takes that prize), it holds a special place in my heart."
"Pours a nice golden amber with some orange hues present. A billowing white head appears and laces the glass thickly. Aromas are very hoppy and citrusy but that's all I can sense in this one. For taste, this beer hits initially citrusy and tangy, with the hops dominating. Following there is a little bready malt followed by some caramel and a nice sweet taste. Finally this brew finishes resiny and piney with the hops leaving it a nice IPA. This beer is fairly light bodied and smooth with does make it quite drinkable, but unfortunately I would have liked a little more up front raw hops. A nice session beer though."
"Drinkabilty: A great IPA. I'd take this any day."
"Poured a bright orangeish-gold color with a bit of haze and a good-sized foamy white head. The head soon fell back to a thin foam cover on the surface that left a little lace on the glass. Hops definitely dominate the aroma. Fresh, piney, citrusy, hops in abundance. The taste, as well, is predominantly hops. A bit of malt sweetness does peek through, but the main flavor is pine, orange/grapefruit, and spice notes provided by the hops. Mouthfeel is medium- to full-bodied and satisfying. A pleasant lingering bitterness with echoes of the hop flavors are found in the aftertaste. I haven't tried a lot of IPAs yet, but I like this one pretty well! My favorite Goose Island offering, so far!"
"orange-copper in color with an off-white head that settled quickly. moderate amounts lacing. respectable. smell was a faint citrus aroma, oranges and grapefruit, but moreso grapefruit. Taste, robust citrus fruits again, with a tid bit of a grainy taste. ha sa nice bitterness that makes its presence known. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. finishes rather bitter and very dry. An above average IPA i would say."
"Appearance: Copper orange hue with a big fluffy creamy texture tan orange tinted head leaves fine intricate lacing great head retention, in short a very nice looking brew. Aroma: Strong upfront citrus scented hops with a mild earthiness with biscuit bready sweetness to balance. Taste: Flavors harmonize well but the hops seem to take a timid grasp on the flavor profile warming alcohol and biscuit bready sweetness from the malts take ahold with some shots of bitterness and hop flavor piney citrus notes. All in all nice IPA a bit reserved and more English than American in nature, and it's not like Goose Island tries to hide this fact with the Union Jack flying on the label. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied great texture grabs ahold of the palate nicely glides smoothly down the gullet with an even carbonation unoffensive yet not totally uninteresting. Drinkability: Smooth crisp more balanced IPA very enjoyable I'm a fan."
"Very refreshing, smooth beer, worthy of praise."
"Drinkability - I'd get it again, as long as there was nothing else available that I know I like better. It is enjoyable."
"Had again March 2005 and smoother, had only slightly cold, thanks Viggo. Had 4 years later on tap at Mahaffey's and noticed lace dots, like that grapefruit."
"A new offering from the local beer store. Not a bad one either. Nice strong hoppy nose. Lace on the glass til the end. Yellow orange in color. Taste is quite hoppy and some malt also. Not as much citrus as other IPA's. Lots of carbonated bite during and after the drink. A little waterly finish. Overall a good and refreshing drink."
"I'll be sure to throw some more of my money into this brew. My first from Goose Island but certainly not my last. I can't wait to give their others a try."
"This was my first American IPA, now available in Norway! Deep golden colour, good head. Lovely hoppy citrussy aroma. I got more pleasure sniffing this beer than I got from drinking it. Flavour is all hops (where are the malts?), dominant initial grapefruity bitterness like I expected (not unpleasant), quite drinkable, but the one-dimensional, medicinal and wormwoodlike bitterness that remains in the aftertaste is not to my liking."
"This is a decently drinkable IPA. I can't decide if the flavor is nicely strong or overpowering, but it definately tastes like an IPA."
"Pours to a permanent off-white head and orange-gold color. Aroma is of American ""C" hops, don't know which ones, probably Cascade. Flavor is surpisingly malty and sweetish, not really as bitter as one would expect. Nice full bodied mouthfeel and refreshing bitter (less sweet at the end) finish."
"This reminds me of a West-Coast Pale Ale, similar in ilk to Sierra Nevada and that trademark Cascade hoppiness. The hoppiness towards the finish is a little too astringenct, but otherwise it's a very solid, cleanly fermented IPA."
"This beer has a tart bracing mouthfeel with perfect carbonation for style. Very drinkable, but watch out as this packs a decent alcohol punch which is not present in the taste. Very enjoyable beer and Im looking forward to trying their Imperial IPA soon!"
"This is my summertime staple. Just the scent of this beer reminds me of cookouts and listen to music in my apartment parking lot. Poured a nice golden orange color with a decent sized white head. Smell is very smooth and hoppy with out being overbearing. Taste is very clean and refreshing. The hops don't dominate this brew but their presence is felt. It finishes with just a hint of citrus and malt. I should also note that this beer is extremely consistent, I have yet to have an off bottle or one that varied to an extreme degree. This will probably remain my summer session beer."
"A slightly hazy (bottle conditioned) orange-amber body sits beneath a frothy head of ivory that slowly settles into a creamy 1/2"" cap of foam that holds lasts and leaves sheets of lace throughout the first quarter of the glass. The nose delivers citrusy (orange, grapefruit) and spicy, piney hops over a delicately sweet malt. Bright and refreshing! It's similar to orange marmalade. The body is medium and it's very fine, natural carbonation leaves it gently crisp and then smoothing in the mouth. Citrusy hops return to dominate the flavor with its honeyish malt acting as a springboard. Some piney/spruce hops appear as its solid bitterness rises. It's really well-balanced and it finishes dry and lingering with some piney hops that last. Quite nice!"
"12oz Bottle best By 08/24/04 Poured a clear dark gold with a bit of a head that died quickly. Has a nice hoppy doughy aroma. Slightly floral and citric. Smooth body and crisp with a bitter finish. Flavor could be better. Decent hoppiness and backed up by a good dose of malt. Reminds me a bit of Brutal Bitter in a way. Overall a decent IPA."
"12oz. bottle: The beer pours a golden color with a hint of orange to it. It has a slightly hazy appearance, with a bit of a white head. A big grapefruit nose of hops. Also a hint of some floral notes. The taste is bold and hoppy: a hint of grapefruit in the taste also. A very good effort!"
"Pours a golden/copper clear liquid with a white foamy head. The head stayed for a while, and there was a little bit of lacing on the glass, but not a whole lot. Smells of citrus, and a little grainy. Taste has a nice grapefruit citrus hop finish. Not terribly sweet. Perhaps a bit thin, but certainly drinkable. I thought this was a good session beer. I have always been happy with Goose Island. It seems that I have never had anything over the top from them, but everything has been good every time that I have had it. That is important, and sometimes understated."
"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle with a best consumed by date. Appearance is a nice orangish amber that leaves a one finger tight white head on top that settles down after a few minutes. A citrusy, slightly floral hop aroma carried by a decent amount of carbonation welcomes you prior to first taste. Moderate bodied with a light grainy aftertaste competes with uninspired hops. Some lace clings to the glass as you move down the glass. An easy drinking beer but nothing to get excited about. Nothing that jumps out and says wow but it is still a well made beer."
"American IPA might be my favorite style. Goose Island's version isn't the best that I've ever had, but it's a lovely drinker all the same. The world needs more hoppy (yet still approachable) IPAs like this one."
"695"
"Pours a almost perfectly clear copper color, topped by a pale cream head that is supported by fairly low carbonation. Some notes of pine and citrus in the aroma, quite a bit of hop floral nectar characteristics. A bit of fruitiness and sharp astringent hoppiness in the nose as well, but in a good way. Taste is sharp and bitter from the hops, supported by a biscuit like maltiness. Quite a dry beer overall as well, but quite a bit maltier than I at first realized. A good amount of hop flavor and a solid dry malt character in the middle is a counter point to the bitterness in the finish. The hops are sharp produce a tingle as this beer passes my lips, just like a good IPA should."
"12 oz bottle pours a clear, bronzy gold, with an offwhite head that is short lived, but leaves coats of patchy lacing all over the glass. Aroma is all hops, with spruce pine and sharp citrus assaulting the nose. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and has a sharp hops bite. Taste is grapefruit rind and pine, with hops resins coating the mouth. This has a fresh green hops sensation all the way through, but there is a hint of sweet toffee and honey that attract a bit of notice and lend a little bit of balance. Finishes with a piney hops twang that is dry and crisp. Very refreshing and nicely drinkable. A good American IPA."
"pours out out a cloudy orangishbrown-yellow. a little hazy with a nice white head. smell is totally hops very strong. a little alc. smell as well. taste is hoppy but not as strong as the smell will lead you to believe. citrusy tangarine fruit flavors and a little wheaty. fruit taste lingers. it's drinkable. i always seem to compare g.i. and sam adams because they seem to have a lot of the same characteristics. such as, very flavorful and very good but a bit too heavy to be a session beer. i feel the same about this beer. i'm not an IPA lover but i'm slowly learning to enjoy them. i enjoyed this beer."
"Bright, peach-fuzz orange, cloudy, thin head, tiny carbonation. Some hops and fresh fruit, some pine on the nose. Up front, a rather decent dose of hop flavoring, bordering on medium bodied. Some grapefruit rind, peach, some citric notes present, although tucked away. Slick, finishes more dry than bitter. Decent flavoring, but won't appear on the Top 10 list for IPAs, yet a superb session style."
"Comes in a 12 oz. twistoff, with a picture of a goose surrounded by hops on the label. Copper color, with an off-white head. Very sharp hops smell, with hints of orange and grapefruit. Very strong hops-wise, little malt balance. Very sharp, bitter, and dry. Maybe a little too much hops, but I still love IPA's, and this one (which originally assaulted my tastebuds into hop-headedness) is no different."
"Clear golden-bronze with coppery highlights, the off-white head reached an adequate size of one finger in height. Fades slowly to a loose cap rather quickly but the remainder lasted well. A decent amount of webby lace was produced as the beer was sipped away. The nose leaves little doubt as to the style of this beer, IPA all the way. Loads of pine needles, grapefruit rinds, and dried wild flowers dominate the bouquet. I find the aromas to be very agreeable, albeit one-dimensional. Inviting. The palate proudly shows the 58 IBUs, the taste is slightly raw and unrefined, the perfect amount for my tastes; the hops are largely floral and piney with only traces of citrus flesh, more bitter rinds than anything. This is not really a juicy IPA; kind of dry actually, I find it pleasant. The maltiness is noticeable occasionally, hints of toasty caramel grains are detectable but they provide little in the way of flavor support. Id like to taste more biscuity-crackers maltiness in my IPA. The finish is heavy on foresty aspects, sap and needles. The abv is small enough to drink this back-to-back-to-back and there is enough flavors to want to do so. The lack of maltiness is noticeable in the mouthfeel, it is a touch to thin for me, vaguely medium, natural, low but embracing carbonation; a touch too slick on the tongue. As a whole I enjoyed this IPA, if it was available locally Id quaff it often, it is too drinkable to ignore. Purchased in Sioux Falls, SD."
"This beer is a study in balance. I've had occasion to sample a few hop bombs lately and this is no hop bomb. It is a beautifullly poured pint that smells of the glory of hops as I bring it up to my nose. The first sip enervates my entire pallate and asks me to drink again. It is so tasty that I stop to enjoy it. What a great reason to stop... I know many of us are seeking the maximum hop experience but this is a wonderful session beer. I look forward to returning to try it again. It is low enough in alcohol to be a session beer, but good enough to find a designated driver. Take care."
"Looks nice, your standard IPA appearance. Smells hoppy and spicy. Taste is hoppy yet watery and there is (I swear) an old greasy sweat sock taste lingering in the back. There seems to be some substance/texture missing from this too, on further reflection, it's really watery. This is the worst tasting IPA I've had."
"*For a great example of how that metallic taste can be a good or bad, compare this one to the Honker's. In the case of the latter, a strong and unbalanced metallic tang kills the taste."
"This beer is a nice orange colored brew, with a small white head topping it off. The nose is all hops, and smells pretty damn good. The first taste you get is a nice kick of hops as expected, nicely balanced with a subtle, sweet malt base. Citrusy hints as well, overall a very well put together beer. One i will buy again."
"I had this right at the brewery's breakroom with some homebrewers. Not a hophead's IPA, but a good one to suggest to friends. We all agreed the color was a robust ""orange."" A nice fizzy head helps spread the hop aroma. Yes, there is hop bitterness, but as Dick Solomon on ""Third Rock"" said, ""Not in that fun, spanky way."" You also get a balanced fruity taste that matches the maltiness nicely. Well done, and in stores round these parts at popular prices."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy light orange color with two fingers of head. There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is fairly hoppy, with hints of malt and floral aromas. The taste is very balanced for an IPA. There are good hop flavors with citrus with malt in the background. The body is just a little light, but the drinkability is fantastic. A great all-around IPA."
"Pours an attractive hazy, moderately deep golden and sports a nice foamy beige head,and leaves ample lace throughout. The nose is both mildly sweet in a fruity way and spicy in a ginger-esc sort of way. Some malty, bready notes are also evident on the nose. In the mouth more spicy gingery hoppiness. This is like an introductory IPA...and that is a good thing! Too many people are turned off by overly hoppy brews, yet if they warm up to them over time who knows, they may find they take a liking to the style. Another solid effort from a brewery that finds its niche in session styled interpretations of the great beer styles. And here in Chi-town the freshness and price of these brews is on target and represents honest value."
"This one goes down easy and smooth. Seems like a good session beer to have. Very balanced with no flavors that come on too strong, kinda surprising for an ipa. Malt is woody and hops are citric which is a good combination. Finish is a little weak but the body is nice and round and full. A good beer to have but nothing exceptional."
"By the way the date on the bttle reads 8/28/02...this is 9/11/03...maybe the year of aging smoothed out the bitter hop profile, but I doubt it..this seems more of an English Style IPA to me..."
"Lots of flavour, as you would expect from an American IPA. The nose and flavour were quite sweet fruity, and full of lychees and pine. The finish dries out a bit aswell, which definitely makes a bit more bearable. A good beer.Just a little sticky and sweet to start with."
"Pours a deep golden color with light to medium head that leaves some nice lacing,the aroma is somewhat grassy with a light sweet smell that lingers.First taste I get is malty and sweet but the hops come in and make this beer have a nice dryer finish.A real nicely balanced IPA,very enjoyable."
"Gold color, medium head. Mildly hopped with very pleasant aromatic hops. This is a slightly sweet malted IPA. This is more of an English IPA in that it is not real hoppyor bitter, but it does have a very nice hop signature without being overpowering. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Medium amber colored beer is topped by a thin white head that quickly fades to a thin collar of foam. The aroma is both sweet malt and strong citrus hops with just a hint of a nice sweet floral/bubble gum component. The taste is very balanced, with good malt sweetness up front leading quickly to the citrus hop flavors, but some sweetness slides in on the finish. The bitterness cleans up most of the flavor, but there is just a hint of sweetness, like a good pink grapefruit, in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very solid, with a moderate carbonation feeding the suppleness on the tongue. It all adds up to a supremely drinkable brew, a good example of the sum exceeding the total of the individual parts. This is a study in balance and quaffability. Probably the most enjoyable Goose Island offering I've had."
"An easy drinking IPA with a distinctive hop flavor, yet surprisingly well balanced for the style. It pours an orange tinted gold with a white head that quick disappears. The aroma is piney and citric. The taste is hoppy, but not over-the-top as I've come to expect from American IPAs. There's a subtle light malt undertone that provides nice balance. The mouthfeel is light compared to most west coast interpretations. Not bad, but there are so many better IPAs out there."
"Not a session brew...acceptable."
"Pours a nice golden hue with a fair sized head that fades a bit too quickly, that leaves a bit of lacing. Aroma is spicy, floral, and just plain hoppy with a hint of malt sneaking in. The tase was what really impressed me, its not the ""more hops=better beer"" kind of IPA, its the ""correctly hopped=better beer"" kind of IPA. The hops are what this beer is about, with a good hop nose and flavor without an oppressive bitterness. After the first few tastes the flavor really settles in with a good bitterness, roasted malt, and oily hop flavor...in about that order. A pretty good session beer."
"I sampled this at the Goose Island brewpub, although I have had it many times from a bottle as well. It pours a clear orange/light copper color. A nice off-white head diminishes very quickly leaving only a small thin layer of fine bubbles. Remnants of the head ring the glass throughout drinking. A pleasant flowery/orange (citrus) aroma is present, along with the smell of hops. Tastes very good, some sweetness and a nice hop taste comes forth (though not as hoppy as many IPAs). Very smooth easy drinking beer."
"Goose Island IPA: to my surprise, and despite the dozens of time I’ve had this beer, I guess its time to do a review. Well, its damn fine. The beer pours gorgeous amber. Not too much head, and it leaves the tiniest bit of lace. The aroma is fantastic, very floral, very hoppy, very nice. The taste is not quite the standard, but I believe that it improves upon it. Very nice, assertive hop flavors, with a nice base of malts that make this a special IPA. Buy it if you find it."
"Pours a clear golden copper color with a nice fluffy white head that rings the glass and sinks to a nice covering film. Fresh hop aroma with a bit of a bready and an increasingly present caramel nose as the brew warms. Caramel, slightl diacety, and malt opens up the taste before being washed away in a tide of hops. Fresh piney hop bitterness with a bit of flowery/earthy hoppiness is present. The hops fade about halfway through the brew and let the bready malt gain the stage for a bit before they return for a bitter flourish at the finish that leaves a nice bitterness on the tongue. Although the hops are the main part of the brew the malt provides a nice medium body but also seems to get a bit cloying as well. The slight cloyingness of the brew detracts from what is otherwise a nice session brew."
"style IPA's I usually find."
"An orangish amber with a decent head that quickly reduces to a thin line. Hops and hops on the nose with a hint of citrus and malts. The beer has a wonderful hoppy taste balanced with a citrus tang that livens the top of the tongue. A great smooth IPA with a touch of spice. Has a nice bite on this with a good balanced flavor. I really liked this one."
"Color is a clear golden yellow with a thin white creamy foamed head, some spotty lace. This smells like an IPA, oh....so hoppy fresh. Nice estery aroma of peach and a bit of apple, super bright and strong on the nose, just as it should be. A treasure of pleasure to wiff. The taste is nicely bittered hop, firm & mild, lightly earthy, supreme drinking here. Has a waxy/oily feel and is quite full with dulled lightly bittering dryness, ...nice! I was surprised to say the least, the goose has landed, I'm impressed, good job on this IPA. Hopheads should be able to enjoy this I would think, I did, and I don't consider myself to be, but I know decent IPA's when I drink em and this fits right up there."
"Time to be goosed. Goose Island IPA pours hazy golden peach color with a decent creamy head. Aromas of citrus, flowers, grass and some sweet malt. This goose has a solid full body that is quite drinkable, the malt base is caramel and toasty bread, hop flavor is earthy with a bit of citrus. I enjoyed this beer very much, it was quenching for the fullness of it and had a nice balance with some complexity in flavors."
"Tasted: 03/21/03"
"It's slightly cloudy golden/copper. A small head is rather dissappointing at first pour, but it laces well. The aroma is awesome....citrusy hops. Zingy carbonation hits first, then hops of course. The hop character is powerful, yet not overdone or harshly bitter. The only strong bitterness is in the aftertaste and it's not annoying at all. The finish is dry and crisp. An awesome IPA, wonderful hop character and not overpowering."
" No longer on avail. on nitro, the beer has changed to a lighter body IPA with a midrange hop that seem to conflict with each other from time to time. Very drinkable and refreshingly lighter, by far my favorite Goose Island Beer."
"A good IPA. While I really enjoyed the aroma of the hops that they used, I did not enjoy their flavor as well."
"Average IPA color-rating in the English or light-American style, a hop-hazy, pale off-yellow appearance. Wait... then again, after puring the remaining ½ bottle before beginning my taste, quite a bit more haziness was revealed. The medium-strong aroma of sweet, piney citrus was matched by a good mouthfeel sense and bolder taste. I like IPAs very much, and this one is a good, standard-style but above average offering."
"Overall a good ale from Chicago. Plenty of hop bitterness balanced with some rich malt flavors and a hint of the alcohol so as not to let you forget that it is there. ""I'll have another please."""
"If you can get this stuff, do so. If you can't, look for Hop Devil, which is as good, or better in my opinion, since I can actually obtain it!"
"This was the first IPA I've tried and I believe it was a good introduction. Poured a murky deep gold color with very a little head that dissipated quickly. Aroma is all out citrus with hops in the background. The taste was good and hoppy. A bit of a citrus flavor but mostly nice crisp hops. A very crisp refreshing brew. I would purchase again."
"Hazy copper color with a tan head. Leave a good amount of lacing. The aroma is that of citric, spicy cascade hops. The flavor that hits you is a citric lemon zest hop flavor, which flows into the hip hop bitterness in the dry finish. Not a bad IPA, but it really doesn’t stand out."
"slightly hazy, light copper color, moderate foamy head with lots of left over lace. the aroma slapped me silly, lots of piney, resiny, and woody hop aromas...amazing! medium body with lots a lot of hop aftertaste in the finish. hopiness runs the gamut from citrus to grapefruit....pine to palm. pretty dry finish, so it leaves a refreshing crispness that i find appealing. maltiness rides in the backseat. goes down smooth with a huge hop profile that stimulates the senses! great stuff. did i mention that this is hoppy? maybe over-hopped for delicate palates...but it's all good. only hardcore hop-heads need to try this IPA. it's rough and tumble."
"Pours a clear golden orange in color with a thick off-white head. Very good retention that eventually gives way to a thick, clingy lace. Well balanced aroma. I expected more hoppiness on the nose for an IPA, they're there, but so is a sweet maltiness. After my first sip I wonder where all those hops were hiding. Resinous pine is the most prominent taste. Much hoppier than the aroma indicates, nice bitterness, but not very well balanced. The malty aroma fools me into thinking I'll taste some malt, but not with this beer. I think I just burped up a pine cone. Finishes dry. A beer for hop lovers for sure. Thin mouthfeel and decent carbonation for the style. I thought it was OK, but I""ll search for other IPAs before I buy this one again."
"A hazy pour with the color of a peach that's just turning brown. Topped off with a reasonable amount of creamy foam that quickly gives way to a thin layer of lace. The appealing smell is highlighted by floral hops on a detectably sweet malt base. Taste is similarly balanced between hops and malt with decidedly less bitterness than many English IPAs. Hops are omnipresent at the front end, slowly yielding to the sweeter taste of grains. Finish is somewhat dry and bitter with detectable alcohol--less enjoyable than the rest of the drink. Coats the mouth a bit, bumping the mouthfeel down a notch. This is quite a drinkable IPA, but hardly the best example of the style."
"Sharp bitterness on the palate at first, ultimately, but not immediately, mellowing out. Excellent texture for the hopheads, as each individual sip requires one to stop, savor, swallow. The hop attack is huge, and clearly, not for everyone. I enjoyed the hell out of this tasty IPA! Puts others to shame."
"Clear bright amber color, 1/2 inch small-bubbled head on a reasaonably hard pour. Zazzy hoppy aroma, some nose hair prickle...flavors start bitter and resinous, lemon pith and balsam-like characteristics that are just shy of mediciny phenolic. Malt never really asserts well, a touch of bread mid mouth before a warbling hop finish. Quenching if not delicious. This review might lead some to think this is a hop monster, its not...lower carbonation and overall muted flavors just leave this brew on the over-balanced to the hop side of the fence in my opinion. A later bottle was more malty, but almost orange soda in its take."
"Cheers to my brother Mikey for bringing it to Florida."
"12 oz. bottle, pours clear light amber color, nice head, leaves a lace in the glass. A flowery strong piney aroma, medium body, balanced malt and alot of hops, I like this IPA one of Goose Island best brews. I can put down a few."
"Coppery golden color with a whitish head. Nice floral aroma. Well hopped, but the malts don't seem to have a lot to say. Tastes good upfront and in the middle, but finishes poorly with lingering bitterness. A good IPA, but miles from the wonderful flavor of a Victory Hop Devil. Drinkability suffers due to the way the beer finishes."
"Poured a pale amber, with good carbonation, but very little head. Hop aroma with slight citrus fruitiness (hint of orange). Very well balanced, yet bold hop flavor. Carbontation tickles the tongue. Salty bitterness beckons you to take another drink to quench it up front, only to be smacked with it again in the finish."
"Somewhat enjoyable...but nowhere near a great IPA."
"Slightly cloudy copper with a thin lace of white on top.  Beautiful floral hop aroma... with maybe a touch of spice.  Taste is slightly one dimesional... very hoppy with an oily bitter finish.  A touch of malt, but not really enough to balance this one out.  It has a medium body, and prickly carbonation.  Overall, a decent IPA, but not one I'd go out of my way for."
"Well, this is a very light copper colored ale with an initially  well-formed head that reduces but is everpresent throughout the tasting.  The thing that impressed me is the well-rounded floral hop aroma on top of the malt sweetness.  The taste is very citrusy, with orange the dominant taste: for an IPA the hops are present but not caustic.  This is an IPA that is very drinkable -- even with the high IBUs it is a mellow drinking beer."
"Kind of thought this to be an mediocre, average at best, IPA. Hops are a bit out of place and the malts are uninspiring. Expected more from Goose Island."
"I'm not always a big fan of IPAs, but I could't find much wrong with this. Great hops ratio and better coloring than your typical IPA. This and Samuel Smith's are both IPAs that kind of transcend the norm."
"The beer has a very small amount of chill haze evident.  Nice light copper tone.  Medium bubbly off-white head that is well retained.  Very nice grassy and herbal hop nose, which is the result of some hefty dry hopping I would assume.  Hops are earthy and perfumey at the same time, if that's possible.  Some slight pine tar notes.  Malt backbone is evident, but definitely in the background.  A nice lingering bitterness makes its presence known long after the drink.  I like it.  The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated.  Body is about medium-full.  This isn't one of my elite IPAs, but it is definitely a good effort."
"It poured a copper golden color and left a nice white head that left some nice lace.  A little bit of carbonation.  It had an aroma of hops and some hops and some citrus.  The taste was of hops, citrus and malt.  The finish was a touch dry and bitter with elements of the forementioned, which was good.  I found this to be a great IPA for the money(at least in my state).  While not the best by far, a good IPA for those that aren't trying to break the bank."
"My first IPA, and its a good one.Poors a deep amber color with a good one-inch soft-fluff head that later laces the glass. Stronger than regular pale ales of coarse at 5.9 but maintains its smooth and crisp finish.I too noticed the mouthfeel. A malty, hopped-up aftertaiste on the mouth roof does last awhile. This is a good finger food eat'n beer or one to relax and sip awhile."
"Notes: Damn good IPA to be had here, clean on the tongue with lots of hop flavour rather than going overboard with bitterness which rests at a substantial 65 IBUs."
