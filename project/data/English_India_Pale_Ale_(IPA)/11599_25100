The nose pretty basic for the style. Some minor floral tones, mild citrus, and a sweet balanced finish. The body had moderate depth; decent carbonation. Easy drinker. Not too filling.

Nose of biscuit and toffee in the backbone, with a sharp, tart, grapefruit character and some floral highlights. Smells bright and light. Flavors are bitter and tart forward, with grapefruit notes abound. Solid roasted toffee backbone, with a rich sweetness. Very well balanced, and some peppery notes at the end of the palate. Spiced and resiny bitter aftertaste on a light, smooth body. The beer has a crisp, drying finish. Very balanced and very solid. Good beer.","GarthDanielson","Aug 07, 2013"

3.95,7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Had while sitting at the brewery on a recent trip to Asheville. Served from cask into a Green Man shaker. Poured a slightly hazy red-orange with a one and a half finger bone white head that subsided to a one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, bitter hop, citrus hop, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, bitter hop, and slight citrus. It had a light feel on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice IPA. Definitely had a pretty nice citrus aspect going on in this one. I just wish the flavor would have been a little more robust in the citrus aspect. This one is definitely worth trying if you are in the area.","thagr81us","0"
3.85,4.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"On-tap at Jack of the Wood, in a shaker pint. Mostly clear dark orange with thin off-white head leaving a ring of fine lace. Smell: earthy, peach tea, slight grapefruit, lots of caramel. Taste: fruiy - peach and orange - herbal spiciness, a little grapefruit rind. Big toffee backbone. Nice lingering bitterness. Solid carbonation. A nice English-American IPA hybrid.","babaracas","Mar 09, 2011"
2.27,-38.5,4,2,2,2.5,2.5,"Nope, not like this at all. Beer is thin and has nearly no hop flavor, some malt on the lead off but overall the beer is just a gross mess of off flavors. Why am I drinking this? Well I'm not anymore.","drabmuh","Mar 08, 2011"
2.12,-42.5,4,2,2,2,2,"The beer appears clear and orange in color, with a half inch of head that leaves some decent lacing on the glass. The aroma is odd, with scents of hops and weird herbal notes. The flavor brings more of the same, with a prominent taste of overly cooked vegetables. The beer is out of balance and off putting. An astringent bitter taste lingers on the tongue. Not recommended.","Huhzubendah","Mar 08, 2011"
2.54,-31.2,4,2.5,2,4,2.5,"d - Not a very good IPA. Smell and taste seemed to have a lot of grain/bready malts to it, as well as a small amount of vegetables, which I did not enjoy. Wouldn't seek out again.","mdfb79","Mar 04, 2011"
2.24,-39.3,4,2.5,2,2,2,"Pours a light copper color with a single-finger white head and a bit of lacing as it slowly falls down my glass. The nose brings forward some light malt and English hops--maybe grassy and herbal--but along with that comes a bit of an off care and slight vegetal notes. The taste is similarly lacking in any hop component and simply has a mild graininess with a bit of vegetable skin. Mouthfeel is medium with average carbonation for the serving type. Drinkability is not particularly good. I would not say that there were any straight-out flaws or off-flavors with this beer, just that there was nearly nothing in the way of hop or malt character to really hide any flaws.","Thorpe429","Feb 21, 2011"

4.1,11.1,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Green Man IPA pours amber and very clear, not a whole lot of head (but I had it on draught, and the bar tender wasn't trying to create any head). I couldn't smell a whole lot, but the taste was huge and delicious. It almost had a dirty rawness...similar to the Green Man ESB. There was so much flavor and it was surprisingly well rounded for a local place. This was the second sampling that I've tried from this brewery, and I have really enjoyed it both times. There is a nice bite, with a pleasant sweetness/bitterness combo. There was so much flavor in this beer that I wouldn't call it easy drinking, but I want to want more of it.","beerdown77","Jun 06, 2010"

4.1,11.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"On tap at 12 Bones barbeque joint in Asheville. The brew arrives as a mildly hazed copper amber with a small offwhite head. Nice sticky lacing is left on the glass. Aroma opens with pink grapefruit, quickly seguing into herbal and grassy hops with a hint of toasty caramel. Smooth and well balanced, with a medium body. Taste has a floral, grassy, and herbal hops bitterness that is balanced very well by a subdued toasty and caramel biscuity maltiness. Supremely well balanced even though the hops run the show. Wow! This one is a pleasant surprise. Very enjoyable, and ideal with the blueberry chipotle sauced rack of ribs.","merlin48","Mar 03, 2009"
3.52,-4.6,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"64oz growler from Bruisin' Ales into a Le Merle tulip glass pours a crisp dark orange with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a decent amount of Earthy hops (a hint of pine) and biscuity malts. The taste is a decent balance of Earthy hops and sweet malts, almost more like a standard Pale Ale, but the beer does leave a nice bitter hoppy finish. The beer is on the light side of medium with a touch of dryness and decent carbonation. This one is somewhat enjoyable, but I must say it's the weakest Asheville IPA I've had yet, and I've now had them all, at least until the next one comes around.","atsprings","Jan 10, 2009"

3.95,7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"This one pours a nice amber in color with good carbonation and excellent lacing down the glass. Smell is a good balance of hops and malt. Somewhat piney and earthy with hints of citrus in there as well but malts are about as pronounced. Caramel malts and I notice the honey sweetness as the beer is described to have. Mouthfeel isn't overly bitter and pretty light. Not too drying and not the same feeling as an English or American IPA. Good drinkability but it gets you easier than the Porter will. A nice take on the English version of the IPA. I enjoyed it.","ncvbc","Sep 24, 2007"
3.06,-17.1,4,3,3,3,3,"I love ipas, but I wasn't impressed with this one. It started well enough with a nice pour, amber with a very good head, some nice retention, and a bit of lacing. The aromas were thin and grainy with a touch of bitter hops. A bit of sweetness as well, but not really integrated. Taste was similar. A thinly carbonated hop tea with no real malt nalance. Thin and watery, with one note spicy bitter hops and just a residual sweetness. Out of whack and quickly tiresome to the palate. Needs more carbonation, structure, and malt.","Georgiabeer","Sep 12, 2007"
