"Notes: The brits may have done it first, but I don't think they do it best.  This, however, is a very nice example of what an IPA can be."
"Great looking beer, lots of lacing left on the glass. Very British in the style. Loads of earthy, grassy hops. Medium high bitterness with excellent drinkability. I prefer American hops, but it is certainly a great beer!"

"O: Really nice brew, found in Kunming and drank here January 20th, 2014.  Will let it warm a little and see how it does with Burger King."
""
""
"O: date on bottle is 6/9/14 - not sure if that's the bottling date or best by date; either way it's old and may have lost its hop profile;"
""
""
"   Would recommend, and would buy again."
"Cloudy orange colour, big head that leaves a good lace. Smell of tropical fruits, citirus, spices and caramel. Good carbonation, medium to full body, Taste of tropical fruits, spices, pine, bitter finish."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, this is a very solid beer to drink for a long time if you want an IPA with less of an edge than most."
""
"Overall: For an EIPA, this is probably the best one that I have had so far. Hoppy, herbal, malty, and delicious."

"P.S. My bottle's label mentioned a 7.4% abv; not 7.5% as mentioned in the description above."

"Overall / Drinkability: For the price of a small bottle, not something I would buy again. Good, but not amazing. However, if it were on cask in the UK at a lower price, I think I would definitely have another. A beer for savoring, and all the flavors come out at proper British beer temperatures. Let it warm up a bit to get the aromas and tastes. So a good beer overall, but rather expensive to have often or to drink a lot of."

"Overall, a pretty decent English IPA from a good brewery in England. I would really like to try some more of this brewery's beers."

"Appears bright flowing tangerine with a chunky textured off white head, fine bands of even lacing grace my chalice. Aroma has bright orange citrus notes with mango tropical fruit based hops. Earthy yeast notes with pure liquid bread malt layers. Flavor is well meshed subdued hop bitterness with complex malt base orange fruit acidity from the alpha acids complement each other so well. Perfect hybrid aggressive hop flavors with complex malts still quite English in nature this is a must try IPA from across the pond. Mouthfeel is delicate resinous and naturally carbonated great stuff cheers for sure I appreciate the smaller bottles beautiful tear drop design, great stuff! Overall I've spoke my peace best English IPA I've come across now go find some."

"O: I have long admired Meantime's desire to both innovate and faithfully recreate the styles of the past, but that being said, their actual beers are normally hit or miss for me. This IPA is not bad, but it is somewhat harsh, overly brash, and aggressive. It is definitely not the most drinkable example of the style. It does, however, display a commendable complexity and is solidly crafted. I would recommend this ale to fans of stronger British ales, especially those who fancy themselves EIPA connoisseurs."
""
""
""
"Could use more carbonation."
"Quite hoppy but not overly bitter and with a solid caramel and sweet malt base that was very enjoyable."
""
"I find it hard to rate styles I find boring and this ones a boring example of a boring stye. I'm board now for sure, time to go fire off bottle rockets towards the seniors home across the street."
""
"Taste-Toasted malt,toffee, caramel, mineral note; all just barely balanced by a good dose of noble hops and white-grapefruit -rind bitterness. A classic English IPA, that begs for a spicy food pairing. Indian, Thai, or maybe just a hunk of aged white cheddar."
""
""
""

"A quite tasty English ale, one which I would have much more ease believing if you told me it was a hepped-up ESB, rather than another rendition of 'we're not an American band' IPA. Give it a rest. Anyways, a rather sexy bitter ale, with a grand ol' bit of warming sass, sans the typical flavour consequences."
"one of the odd examples of an English ipa that tastes more like an American ipa, usually its the other way around, but this one is hop heavy without all the caramel malt sweetness. the pour has a nice reddish color to it, fairly hazy, with a few fingers of lasting khaki foam. the nose is big bold woody oily American hops, centennial maybe, maybe something else high alpha, but this has a real hop forwardness to it. the malts aren't really sweet at all, just biscuity in a supporting role. the flavor agrees with the smell, hops all the way. there is a nice citrus element to it, orange peel and a lot of bitterness in the finish. the alcohol is well hidden in taste, but you can certainly feel a big bottle of this. the yeast imparts an almost Belgian brightness to the mouthfeel. its effervescently carbonated, which is nice in a big ipa for once, and the body is fuller than medium but not filling or weighty. overall this is an exemplary beer, a whole lot better than meantimes coffee porter, and one that's actually pretty fairly priced at under 13 bucks for a 750ml. its worth all of that, a real treat where I honestly least expected it."
"One of the best IPA's I can remember tasting. Richness and depth of malty flavour with the bundles of happy hoppiness you'd expect. Feels like a real treat! Pretty strong but the alcohol is beautifully disguised."

"O: purdy good, purdy unrefined (in a positive manner) - malty like a Helles and quite orange-flavored - the bitterness is soft, but on the high side for a UK version - would be interested in having again, hopefully more fresh..."

"Well balanced beer considering the style and it has a very good drinkability. Traditional English IPA, with less character in comparison to the US counterparties, though still above average."
""
"Pours a murky orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, and citrus zest. Taste is much the same with a mild hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink."
""

"A seriously excellent UK IPA: fruity and dry, zesty and sharp but without all the skin-flaying harshness found in so many American models. Even my wife, ever-hesitant toward IPAs as a class, enjoyed it. And you won't need to drink a bottle of water afterward."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best before 7/1/2013. Pours very hazy orange copper color with a nice 1-2 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of orange, grape, pear, caramel, biscuit, herbal, floral, honey, toast, and earth. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of orange zest, grapefruit, pear, caramel, grape, herbal, floral, biscuit, toast, honey, and light earthiness. Light amount of earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, light fruit, caramel, herbal, floral, biscuit, toast, and light earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity; with a great bitterness/sweetness balance as well. No cloying sweetness at all after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, lightly slick, and crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent English IPA! Extremely well balanced with good complexity; very smooth to drink. Highly enjoyable stuff."

"This was a change of pace from my usual IPA haunts and I liked it. Nothing over the top or knocking your socks off but I felt completely satisfied with it at the end of the glass. One other thing to note was the bottle design with narrow neck and much wider base. It certainly is visually attractive compared to the usual beer bottle (a few non-beer drinkers told me as much when they saw it) but more than two of them would start taking up a fair bit more floor space in your fridge than standard bottles or cans."
""
""
"Overall: A really nice example of the style, it doesn’t look pretty but has a lot of bitterness but a nice malt backbone to balance it. Floral english hops can be a nice change of pace from the American IPA citrus bombs."
""
""
""
"Overall: not a bad IPA. Fairly simple and not too memorable but very drinkable with a well hidden alcohol level considering the ABV."

"VERY NICE, WORTH TRYING!"

"O: This beer is well balanced and goes down rather easily since the hops are not overpowering. I had no problem knocking off a 750 mL bottle of this by myself."
""
"Crisp and smooth mingle well in this beer. It flows well and has a good carbonation to keep things moving. The body is medium."
"Pours deep orange with bubbly white head that fades. Interesting but pleasant aroma of toasted grain, mild hop spice, slight toffee. Tastes of toasted breadiness, light toffee, citrus, slight tang, and then dry and bitter with some alcohol burn. Medium bodied with light carbonation. The high alcohol hinders the beer in this instance. It bites, slicks, and annoys."
"On-tap. Pint glass. Enjoyed on nov´11. Golden color, chill haze. Off-white, creamy crown. Copious collars & spots. Good retention. Hints of orange & resiny hops to the nose. Sweet malty & hoppy upfront. Mildy malty in the middle followed by smooth astringency. Medium body, medium carbonation. Oily resiny finish. Fruity aftertaste. Refreshing. Nice drinkability."
""
"Overall not too bad, definitely not near American style IPAs with hops and bitterness, some interesting U.K. like earthy hops that don't get overly bitter or icky tasting, and fairly well balanced between the hops and malts, but not a quick drinker."
"O/D-I did not enjoy this at all. After the first sip I was looking for the next beer to order. Hate to slam a beer, but I will not dabble with Meantime's brews unless I hear good words from someone else."

"a pretty decent english IPA, but not something that i would ever really buy again. it does however leave me interested to try some of their other beers."

"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a pint glass, coded date, very cool bottle. This pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a nice off white head. The smell is of light hops and caramel malts. The feel is medium to a little heavy. The taste is pretty good, caramel and other malts, a nice medium light hop bite, very nice."
"Very yeasty nose but not much beyond that apart from maybe a smidge of white pepper. Lighty orangy yellow sparkle. Thick ever so just off white two inch head with some decent beading. Light, clean and lightish yet persistent with an understated melon to martini like bitterness which makes for a very satisfying mouthfeel. Very classy. Doesn't drink anything like a 7.4% ABV beer. Probably the most sophisticated IPA I have ever had. Could imagine splitting a bottle of this poolside with Cary Grant. While chatting up Grace Kelly."
"Picked this up at Bert's Bierhuis in Utrect, The Netherlands. Slightly hazy amber-yellow pour with two finger head with nice retention and lacing. The nose is pretty much dominated with sweet caramel malt that plays well with the fruitiness. With that said, it's not your typical West Coast citrus bomb, but more mangoes, apricots, and tangerines with hints of bread and grass and just a touch of pine. The malt dominates the taste initially with tons of sweet caramel and toffee. But as it warms, the bitter hop bite comes into play to balance this one out to perfection. Hints of orange zest, biscuit, tea, and toast with just a touch of pine. The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and sweet to start, but yields to a subtle tangy, bitter finish. At 7.5%, it's a little stronger than the typical English IPA, but you don't notice it and this is oh so drinkable. A really nice example of the style and my first, but not last, taste of Meantime!"

"O: Truly an English IPA as there is no noticeable hop profile here. Not bad, but definitely needs a bit more character to be memorable."

"O - I am not sure what happened with this one. I think I may have gotten a pour from the bottom of the cask. Oh well, I enjoyed it for what it was but I doubt I would seek it out again."

"Overall a rather delicious quaff. Completely different than the American style of IPA. At 7.5% ABV, which was never noticeable, it was the strongest beer at the festival. I would drink this again."
"O - not a beer I would have ever tried, but definitely glad I tried it. Decent beer."
"This 11.2 ounce bottle was poured into a pint glass. A low head built up on this cloudy (bottle-conditioned) IPA, with a pale orange hue. Mild hop aroma, moderate bitterness, with hints of light caramel, and a certain warmth. Very little lacing. It's overall hop bitterness and body lend itself closer to an American IPA then a English one, at least that is what my tongue is telling me. Refreshing."
"overall, not especially impressed here. it's a decent enough, slightly above average beer that i will not be tripping over myself to revisit."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish to yellow color with an off white head. In the aroma, earthy, grassy, and some pine hops. In the taste, gingerbread malt with earthy and grassy hops, with just a touch of lemon citrus. A mellow hop bite and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a lightly dry and mellow hop in the aftertaste. A nice English IPA, quite enjoyable."
"Overall, impressed and am hopeful this shows up at our shop in Paris asap...definitely would be a go to if I am in need of some hops!"
"If only this was on-tap every night."
"This beer has a good base and I think the malt content is just about spot on but the hops really need work. But, then again, English beers traditionally focus on malt so that's not too surprising. If this beer had NZ hops added to it at the start of the boil and also in dry hopping I think it would be pretty fantastic."
"O-Overall this beer is just OK. Pretty drinkable, decent flavor, but nothing too outstanding, that's about it."
"I may get this one again because it is a well crafted IPA, but I am definitely going to add Meantime to my list of breweries and keep an eye out for their other beers to try!"
"A clean British IPA, solid and not exciting."
"O- This is not your typical English IPA. Solid beer overall, worth a try. I would buy this again."
"Overall I like it. Worth trying but there are better IPAs out there"
"This is my favourite of all the English IPAs I have tried so far."
"Overall: The biggest thing I like about this beer is that it is balanced. The alcohol is completely hidden. It is not a hop bomb, and the flavors compliment each other extremely well. I could drink this all night long. Overall just an excellent beer."
"O: Traditional English IPA. Not aggressive as an American IPA however very tasty and drinkable"
"Nice. Plenty of hoppy aroma but little bitterness; different from an American IPA that has both considerable aroma and overwhelming bitterness. Perhaps a little sweet, but the malt and hops balance well and the presence of yeast adds depth. A pleasantly crafted English IPA that is worth sampling."
"Overall: a bit weak in terms of an IPA. you expect that nice brittish hoppy bite, but you dont get it..The sweetness would be much more balanced if there was a bit more hop in there."
"O: This is a nice beer, Sam Smith's when it's fresh is better, but this gives a pretty clear view of the EIPA, worth a pickup."
"Unfortunately, English IPA's don't get the credit they deserve. This is a world class example that should not be ignored!"
"O: I think I would like a touch more of the english hop flavors, and a touch less of alcohol. Seems just a touch solventy for me. I like the malt flavor, but the hops loose if for me. Solid bitterness, just wish there was a touch more hop character."
"And again, awesome bottle/bottlecap. Counts for extra points with collectors I bet."
"Taste is very subtle and refined compared to the wallop of hops you get when tasting an American IPA. It fills your pallate with citrus and spice and then flows smoothly down the throat leaving an undertone of bitter hops. I drink this very often and each time i drink it i fall even more in love with it."
"This is a great example of a classic English IPA. I would definitely pull this bad boy out to show someone not familiar with the style what it is like."
"O- A good drink. Definitely worth a try... sweet bottle btw."
"The taste is pretty sweet and fruity, all things considered. Some caramel in the background as well as a bit of yeasty fruit. Other than that, also some floral and herbal hops. Mouthfeel is slightly bitter and a bit cloying with all the sweetness. Medium body. Drinks pretty well and the alcohol certainly isn't all that noticeable at all."
"Conclusion: In my opinion this is a very good example of this style. Hopped up with English style hops and malty enough to keep things from going off the hop deep end. Complex for this style."
"I'm not sure if I got a bad batch or what, but my first indication of a bad beer was on the POP. There was none. Popped the cork, and nothing. There was no head or carbonation when poured into a tulip glass. The smell was foul. Like malted mold. The taste was absolutely awful. Slick and musty. I had to pour it out. I'm assuming, since everyone else rated it so well, I got a bad one. Won't try it again."
"Although this beer is not as aggressive with its hops flavor as an American IPA, it is a very solid offering. The taste is balanced with a decent malt profile to work with the hops."
"D: Overall, this is a finely balanced IPA. The flavors are developed without any one being domineering. Very reserved, yet satisfying."
"I don't see the appeal of this beer except for its fancy bottle and cool label. I've never had a true English IPA (except this one!) but I am sure there exist much better representations of the style. This one was a complete waste of liver and dollar alike. One of my friends that I shared the bottle with went as far as calling it a vile beverage. While I might not have such an extreme sentiment, I am not buying this again, and perhaps avoiding it for free too, unless it smells of something remotely hoppy, in which case I would chalk my experience up to a bad/old bottle."
"D: A good beer, but one of the best. I am a bit full -- perhaps I'd enjoy this beer more on a emptier stomach? No, probably not. If you want an English IPA, Meanwhile's a solid pick, but I wouldn't go out of my way to pick one up."
"Beer is pretty full bodied and has this spicy / bitter finish to it that is pretty nice. Overall its a good beer. The forward malt sweetness is well balanced with the carbonation level and the midpalate flavors of mild spice and earthiness. The bitterness at the end is mild but appropriate with the levels of everything else. It's quite a good beer, one of the better English IPAs I've had."
"My gripe is why can't they bottle this stuff in at least a 12 oz bottle? What's with these short 11.2oz bottles? It doesn't even fill a small glass! Reminds me of so many things we find in the supermarket where the price stays the same but the contents continually shrink."
"I knew this IPA would be different than the American ones I'm used to, but I was still shocked by how different. The beer pours a deep gold, much lighter than most IPAs and has a good level of carbonation.The smell does not reveal much hops. The first sip was surprisingly malty and even had a strong presence of alcohol. The finish is dry as expected, but not the powerful taste I am used to. The lack of strong hop presence leaves the beer unbalanced in my mind."
"D = Overall, this brew is subtle in nature, but lacks character with only having sweetness and a surprising finish. However, it is the transition from sweetness to this finish that offers a pleasant surprise. This is its greatest strength, but also is the greatest weakness of the brew. Overall, I was not impressed with this brew being representative of the IPA style, even by English standards of putting less hops than the American counterparts. . It was far too sweet and grossly under-hopped."
"I've been passing by the beer for a while and glad I finally picked up a bottle. I will revisit this again."
"D: 7.5% ABV isn't too bad, especially for a small batch beer. Tasty stuff!"
"pours a slight hazed copper color with a great head and lacing..smell was toffee and malts and floral noble hops and some roasted malt/caramel notes..taste was great it was sweet floral hops with roasted malts the hops lingered and went from floral and grassy to a nice light bitter finish,it was delicious..mouth feel was medium with nice carbonation,it was sweet and crisp and had slight biting finish..drinkability was good its a solid ipa..really enjoyed this 1"
"Gorgeous IPA.Color: amber / orange. White/Beige head, high formation. Aroma of hops, malt, citrus and something fruity. Flavor well balanced between malt and hops, bitter far right. Good balance between body and carbonation. I really love IPA´s like this!"
"Overall a good EIPA. Advertised on the tap handle as an IPA in big block letters. It was a fine a fine beer, but American drinkers should take heed of the fact that this is an authentic English design and not a hop bomb."
"D - not feeling it...overwhelming soap and malts even for an Enligh IPA (a stlye I can appreciate). finding it hard to polish off the bottle and move on."
"D - This is an excellent English IPA. It seems very true to what I would expect some of the orignial versions might have been like. It's very impressive and well done. I'll be looking for this one in the future."
"A careful pour so as not to stir up the lees resulted in a finger of off-tan head with low retention. Color was a slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose was faint and light with a malty/sugary presence. Mouthfeel was medium with a very malty-sweet taste on the tongue. Finish had a mostly sweet taste with a slight tang of hops on the extreme finish. It was a really mellow experience, like drinking hops tea. This would make a great entree into IPAs for those who may not yet be committed hopheads."
"If you're gonna deviate from the style, do it all the way like Stone's anniversary selection. This beer was ok, but at $10 a bottle, I'll stick to checking it out in sample size."
"D- A decent ale that is both light and refreshing. I don't think I would by this beer again but would not turn it down if it were offered to me."
"This beer is a great example of the traditional English IPA. If you are looking for a West-Coast American-style IPA, you may be disappointed with this brew. However, this does allow the drinker to experience where the Western IPA brewers derive inspiration."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Found this on tap at M'Coul's in Greensboro, NC sporting a dark hazy amber color with a whispy white cap and very little lace. The aroma offers firmly malty pine hops, with the accent on caramel malt. Nice. The taste brings much of the same with sweet malt and tangy pine hops. There's a malt liquor subtlety and root beer touch with a hint of dry clove. It's medium bodied with a bright clean somewhat aqueous feel with minimal carbonation. Toffee and nut noted in a very drinkable Enlish IPA. Not bad."
"D - This is a classic IPA which I regard as the benchmark for the style and so nice to see that it comes from the home of IPA's"
"This beer seems to do a great job of sticking to the traditional English IPA character. If compared to an imperial or American, one may be disappointed. The subdued hops and pleasant biscuit give this a nice balance at a generous abv. Certainly worth a try for anyone."
"Good drinkability. Alcohol is well-concealed. Pre"
"Bottle: Poured a hazy light amber color ale with a super huge foamy head with nice foamy head with great retention and good lacing. Aroma of grassy hops is really nice with a subtle caramel malt balance. Taste is also dominated by loads of grassy hoppy notes with lightly sweet caramel malt which is well balanced by floral notes. Body is quite full for style with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not as bitter as the American IPA nor as dry as the English IPA but very nice with loads of floral notes."
"Wow, I just realized that this beer is almost gone, it is pretty easy drinking and very delicious."
"If nothing else this is a very interesting beer and well worth checking out."
"Libation: I really like IPAs and I go for English versions when I can, but I must say I'm a bit disappointed with the Meantime offering. It's tasty and well balanced, but doesn't really lure me back for more, especially at the going price."
"I could easily session this if it weren't for the ABV. This is the best British-brewed IPA I can remember drinking. Thanks Eric!"
"Drinkability - not the best value at $9 for a 750ml, but certainly glad to see Meantime locally. I'd have it again but no as an everyday IPA."
"At a little over $10 a bottle, a strong argument could be made that better value can be found elsewhere, though I'm not sure that many better examples of this style can be found at any price. Every aspect of the flavour is expertly balanced, its one of the prettiest beers I've seen in a long time, and the flaws of its carbonation are easily fixed to reveal a decadent body. Serve slightly below room temperature and enjoy. There's no doubting this is a benchmark for the style."
"Body is a little lighter than I would have liked, but the carbonation is absolutely perfect. 7.5% ABV is hard to believe. A supremely easy drinker. This is a beer I'd really like to be able to find locally."
"It's got great balance and enough of a hop bite to please most I would imagine. Drinkable in spades but I imagine the slightly higher ABV for an IPA would limit too many of these (as would the price). Well done from bottle to last drop."
"An excellent beer, I can see why Meantime gets a lot of praise in the UK (2008 Brewer of the Year). True English IPAs are tough to come by in Canada, so you should give this a shot before it disappears. Cheers to R&R for importing!"
"Ridiculously easy to drink for a beer of 7.5%abv, nearing a double IPA. An excellent beer."
"Overall, this is a lot like drinking a stronger version of an ESB, and that classic English malt balance definitely comes through in spite of the higher quantities of hops."
"D: I would have a few pints if I was in the mood for something a little different. Unusual with all the cidery qualities, but overall very drinkable."
"This is my first English IPA since becoming serious about evaluating and rating beers and I enjoyed this side of the style. The flavor profile seems to be like a little brother to a barley wine. I think I'll have to search for more examples."
"Notes: Good example of an English IPA, the hops are fairly strong and give a lot of flavor, but it isn't a kick you in the mouth beer. Worth keeping an eye out for it."
"Overall it's a good example of the style but not a style I'm crazy about. It has some redeeming qualities but not what I look for in a hoppy beer."
"Very drinkable beer with good carbonation and flow."
"T+S: Very floral hops, probably the most floral I've ever smelled/tasted. Nice clean bitterness as well, no malt though. I wish it was a bit creamier."
"D - very good, quite unusual for the style but enjoyable, possibly a session IPA"
"D: Could I drink this all day? Probably not, but I enjoyed it so much that I think I could give it a crack. After all, I downed a 750ml bottle in no time!"
"On the whole this is a good, drinkable IPA. Unfortunately, it lacks the X-factor that makes an IPA great."
"Poured from the bottle into a standard pint glass. Poured a slight brown with some cloudiness and a light tan head that dissipated quickly and left little lacing. Aromas revolved more around the malty sweetness than the hoppy bitterness. Some alcohol also in the aroma. Taste was sweet as well, almost a hint of brown sugar detected. Light to medium bodied, with appropriate carbonation and some slight oiliness on the finish. Good beer though the sweetness could limit drinkablility some"
"I hope this is just a terrible mistake and the beer has simply turned, but the store I got it from rotates their stock often enough to make me believe this is just what this beer is. Sad."
"Pours a golden brown color body, with an average tan color head. Diminishing. Malty aroma, bitter dusty, musty. A little funky. Light taste, some maltiness. More dustiness in the taste. English tasting. Probably the yeast or the hops. Eh, not so tasty. Might be something off with this bottle."
"I bought this beer and had no idea it came from England. It said Greenwich and I thought they were talking about Connecticut. As soon as I drank it I sensed English IPA, i looked at the bottle again and realized i was right. This is a very good example of the style and reminded me that I should drink this more often. Not nearly as hoppy or aggressive as a standard IPA, this is still a great beer and very refreshing while being interesting."
"good beer, but i was kind of expecting more. life lesson if you want to be happy, lower your expectations."
"Carefully decanted from a 11.2 Oz. bottle. Pours a clear golden color with a large cream colored head that had excellant retention. The head settles to a thick cap with heavy lacing left on the glass. The aroma is not what I want it to be. Weak hop elements of citrus and bready malt. Smells like a weak APA. But this beer redeems itself in flavor. Nicely balanced between citrus, floral, and herbal hop elements and soothing bready malt. Bitterness is appropriate for the style. Finishes with a little herbal aftertaste. Nice body but I would like to see a little more substance especially when the ABV is at 7.5%. Nicely carbonated. Too expensive to be a regular in my lineup. Also has more alcohol than most other English IPAs."
"quite a nicely hopped engislh ipa. a bit murky orange with an off yellow white head. nice lemon zest with a light dry peppery but bready quality. nice mild sweet maltose and a wood earthy finish bitterness. quite a nice bright beer with an elegant wide malt character."
"D: That 7.5% ABV is very well-hidden. This beer is smooth and clean but has a nice wallop of hops hidden inside, and a malty sweetness that somehow manages not to cloy. Is this the greatest EIPA ever?"
"Drinkability is very good. Almost too good. Good thing I couldnt afford to have more."
"D: A little too light on tongue, but tasty and refreshing."
"It's not to say that they can't make a hoppy IPA. This is a decent version of the style that originated there and it's actually better than a few other examples that I've had."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer is on the verge of being over carbonated; thus, the brew almost stings the tongue. I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these a night."
"First off, I'm a huge IPA fan and, therefore, I am somewhat critical of IPAs, in general. Once de-corked and the beer poured, the beer smells great. Mid-way through your beer, I found myself saying aloud, ""I can't believe this came from a bottle."" The beer actually tastes like it just came out of a tap. Excellent beer to enjoy."
"D - Very smooth beer that belies the alcohol content. A bit pricey, so I won't be buying a sixer of this, but very tasty"
"D: Overall, seems a bit overly bitter. I'm a hop head but found the bitterness from the hops to be a bit unbalanced. Definitely not your typical English IPA. Enjoyable beer but probably wouldn't purchase it often."
"D: It's a drinkable beer. But not what I expected from an IPA. Slightly Belgian IPA? Interesting take."
"Overall, this is a wonderful beer. If only it were cheaper, and came in imperial pint-sized bottles. Just the same, I'm glad I took the chance on this one -- its accolades are well deserved."
"D: It's not bad by any means, but I think I'll stick to the American IPAs."
"D - Too resiny to drink loads of it and the alcohol will knock you about abit."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy copper-orange color with a one finger of thick creamy white head. Head recedes rapidly but leaves ample lacing on the glass. Nose is of some floral hops, caramel malts and a touch of fruitiness like apply. Taste fell somewhat flat for me. Floral hops dominate at first and then malt takes over, some grainy and pale malts in here, a touch of apple, and the finish is of caramel malts. The balance of the flavors seemed off. Medium body, moderate carbonation, goes down smooth and crisp. This beer went down quite smoothly but not one that I would sit with for an evening."
"The taste is quite candied sugar sweet, almost Belgianesque underneath, but there is some unusual hoppy acerbicness, a thick syrupy consistency, and a fairly boozy presence. This beer is just odd. There is all the makings of a sweetish Belgian beer, with its sweet florals and syrupy texture, then you get some hop acerbicness and some drying notes, maybe some hop leaf notes, and then you get the syrupy ABV presence in the mouth and throat. This beer is just plain unusual for the style and not a typical English IPA that I've ever had. Worth a try, but it is unusual."
"D- This beer doesn't really have any hop aroma or flavor except for the bitterness that doesn't have much character in itself. No real off flavors except for the plastic and there were no real hop flavors except for the bitterness."
"This is by far the best English IPA I have had, I would consider it the benchmark for the style. Highly recommended."
"D - Drinking a whole bottle on my own and although I would love to sgare I am liking the fact I have more."
"D- Loved it! I was particularly taken by the typical English IPA character tweaked with a very present yeast aroma and flavor. I will definitely be drinking this again."
"My first time trying an English IPA was not a good one, please someone assure me that this is just my bottle, but this wasn't that great, I was looking forward to this alot more."
"Rather drinkable, alcohol is barely noticed. The flavor profile is rather enjoyable and rounds out as it reaches room temperature. Will have to revisit."
"This is quite possibly one the better, if not the best English IPA's I've encountered in quite sometime. Super sessionable and a well balanced subtle tasty treat! Damn yummy stuff!"
"D - This is an interesting English IPA with a lot of hop character. The Belgian level of bottle conditioned carbonation is an unusual twist for the style, but it helps lift the somewhat sweet finish. Not a bad example of the style, but I still greatly prefer American hop character in my IPAs."
"D- I found this to be a sipper and while I really enjoyed my 11.2 oz single, I wouldn't really want another right away."
"A very interesting take on an English IPA. It pours a sandy bronze color, with a billowy white head that doesn't last but leaves lacing down the glass. The smell is very floral, sort of buttery. The taste is more savory than you usually get from an IPA, with some meaty, fatty notes, but also some nice herbal, floral, and citrus tones and a sharp, bitter finish. It's moderately carbonated, rather full-bodied, pleasant on the tongue. Not the easiest to down, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"I like this brew but am somewhat disappointed and frustrated by it. I would have to say Brooklyn's East India and Twisted Thistle, and probably a few others would be ahead of this in my book. Still, worth trying, and I'll probably give it another shot at some point."
"D- Very drinkable and a good representation of the style."
"Thanks for Reading"
"perhaps a bit too sweet, and frankly i still want more hops, ""english"" or not."
"Poured into a grapefruity colored decent head with a larger than usual bubble ring. Nice color. Smells floral and hoppy, of course that is the hops... Very complex smell. Slighty grapefruity as well. Taste is crisp and refreshing with a great forward, hoppy center and malty aftertaste with still a hops at the very end. Yum... Mouthfeel is good, complex with hops and malty equal. Malty and hoppy, very good. Easy to drink this above average gravity beer."
"750 ml corked bottle"
"An interesting counterpart to the overly bitter American hop bombs. This takes the style in the other direction. A bit to sweet IMO. I expect English IPA's to have a great balance between malt sweetness and hop bitterness. This does not. Though, as the history goes this is probably closer to the original IPA's made in England during the 1700's than anything else I have had."
"Pours with a dense cream white head, mainly tiny, sticky bubbles with a few larger ones interspersed, carpets the glass sides with lacing. Warm glow to the fat sunset orange color, as much light brown mixed in as yellow, moderate transparency. Excellent clarity to the nose with spacing among the pine oil, grapefruit and orange citrus, daisies and other wildflowers, green apple and pear fruit, golden honey and sweet tea scents. Close to full-bodied, here it is more compact and woven into a unified whole. The carbonation level is excellent and carries the flavors while allowing the palate to enjoy the array of textures. On the sweet side of the spectrum, emphasizing pink grapefruit, tangerine, lime citrus, honey and flaky pastry dough. The malt flavor is there, smoothing influence too, but it does not reach the level of chocolate or caramel found in other beers. Light clove and cinnamon spice break through near the end as well as dried oat cereal. Very clean finish with tempting aftertaste and weight echoes across the tongue."
"D: Refreshing drink, but not impressive. Hops are nice, but delicate. Malts are small and smooth. Doesn't quite spark my interest enough to try again, but was decent. I prefer the hoppier, maltier, stronger American IPA."
"Happy sampling."
"Solid drinkable beer and one of my top rated beers for style."
"D - Good, very different from the standard American IPA. Very creamy and drinkable. No alcohol feel either."
"D - Good beer, but still waiting for my IPA wow moment"
"Thanks to Keith for sharing a bottle. This appears a classic hazy light orange with a tight white head. The hops and malt are a little too well blended and neither really stand out. I can tell there's a grassy/citrus mix and dry bready malts, but they're hard to pick apart. This sort of flavor reminds me more of a under-hopped pale ale. Otherwise this beer is very drinkable and overall tasty. I'd just want a little more from it."
"d) All up, it's very tasty...but somewhat sweet. I think it's on the same vector as English Barley Wine, only lighter."
"D, notes: The bitterness in this beer is very well done - smooth. My sense is that this is a perfect example of the style."
"Pours with a large creamy white head. Somewhat cloudy, lots of particulates. Deep amber color. Sweet resiny, yeasty, alcohol aroma. Definitely restrained in the use of hops, no in your face pine or citrus here. Medium chewy body. Honeyish malt throughout, bit of a marmalade flavor along with caramel and dried friut. Crisp bitterness in the finish, very well balanced."
"7/4/6/4/14 (3.5/5)"
"Poured nice deep orange with a small white head, Smelled and tasted less than great. Smelled of malt and some hops, rather let down. Tasted some hops, plenty of malt and if you let it go for a minute the bitterness will hit you at the very end but not much. It was an average IPA but not worth what I paid for it, however always worth a try and not to bad."
"D- Very Smooth, EASY to drink. Very good alternative to an american IPA."
"B'ham UK January 2009"
"Nice hazy orange-gold pour with a thick squatty head. Aroma is mostly orange-citrus hops and sugary sweetness. Extremely smooth taste of the same citrusy hops, with some Granny Smith apple-like aftertaste mixed with a solid malt back. Some soapiness as others have pointed out, but overall, a really good beer. Stays kind of in the middle of an English IPA and a West Coast."
"Wow! Great beer! Got this 750 ml cork finished bottle in Miami Beach a couple months ago. Poured with a big foamy frothy head and some lace. Hazy medium amber color. Nose was grassy, citrusy, a bit hoppy and malty. Nice and bitter on the tongue in the mouth that perfectly goes with the champagne carbonation. Great mouthfeel. Excellent beer. Nice change of pace from the amped American IPAs. A bit boozy warmth there. Good burps too. Finish leaves me smiling. Wot a beer. Wish I had more."
"Very interesting this claims to be an authentic IPA. After so many over the top West Coast IPAs this one made a believer out of me that this was the way is was supposed to be done. From a 750 ml C&C bottle, this poured a slightly cloudy amber color with a nice fat off-white head that left glue-like lacing rings. Very attractive. Nose of caramel malts and some grassy hops. Very smooth and rich mouthfeel. Flavor is of citrus and pine hops, and the finish is nice and bitter. One of the easiest drinking IPAs I have seen."
"This is certainly no hop bomb and heavy on the malty and fruity sweetness. Still a very drinkable brew."
"Drinkability - High. If it weren't a challenge to remove the cage and cork from the bottle I would've enjoyed more. Recommend enjoying this IPA across the pond as it happens to lose something in shipment (i.e., not as bold/spicy)."
"I had this in September at the tied pub in Greenwich, and I was interested to see what others had rated it. The color is a nice amber, and lots of good hops aroma, but the bitter flavor is not as strong as an IPA here in the states, but stronger than most British IPA's I have had there. I would compare it most to a slightly hoppier Sierra Nevada, or possibly a Stone Pale Ale, nice to drink and pleasant enough for me to hunt it out this side of the pond."
"Overall: Excellent. Keep in mind, though, that this is an English IPA and not an American IPA. So if you're looking for a hop explosion, you might be disappointed. Either way, I highly recommend this one to all who enjoy a nice IPA."
"A solid beer, but just not what I'm looking for in an IPA any more."
"Overall a very good beer. I would recommend to anyone looking for a top-shelf IPA. Could drink this one again and again."
"D - Easy to drink. Sweetness is somewhat limiting if you are drinking it without spicy food."
"25.6 oz bottle. Pours a dense pale orange with 3 cm white head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma of fruit and hops, a hint of something malty. Initial flavor of sour apple and citrus. Ends hoppy and with some fruit flavors. Light to medium body, limited lacing, moderate carbonation, and some alcohol noted, especially with warming. Overall, a very different IPA than I was expecting, very good, kind of champagne like."
"Just bought one large bottle of this (1 pint 9.4oz) and it went down smoothly"
"pours a copper color with a nice frothy white head with great lacing. the nose is yeasty, alcohol, floral hops, leather, old oranges. the taste is mellow hops up front. floral and citrus hops but definately English style because if it was American, the hops would be trying to take over my brain with all of their immense power. also tastes of orange citrus, sweet malts, subtle earthy tone. medium to full body, very sweet finish. I even split the bottle with my girl and we both couldn't finish it because of how sweet it is. although it is probably my favorite English IPA"
"This ale was a real treat, and one that I will be returning to often."
"I have enjoyed all the beers I'v tried from this brewery (this, the porter, and the Scottish ale). Poured into a pint glass, the beer was an orange color with a thick, white, sticky head. Aroma of malt and hops, fruity and floral. Sweet malt taste up front, with an intensifying hops presence. Still, the beer was subtle and not at all a hop bomb. Very nice, would be a good session beer."
"D: It was a great session IPA. It was well balanced and entertaining."
"The taste is sweet and bitter, full of flavour and complexity, applie, pine, honey, citrus, a clear grassy quality, fruit, stewed fruit, and orange marmalade sweetness with alcoholic warmth coming through. It has a dryish, hoppp, spicey finish and is great alone or with food."
"This is a nicely balanced quaff to please the palate - and not the least bit complicated. Really, a pleasant session beer that is nowhere next to being a ""hop bomb."""
"This one poured nearly clear, with a deep orange colour and an inch of beige foam. After it settled a bit, the cap formed a thick, clumpy collar and some chunky lacing. Nice aroma, fruity esters, caramel malts, and floral/grassy hops with notes of citrus. Good flavour too, with oranges and biscuity malts up front, grassy and herbal hops, balanced bitterness, and a bit of alcohol in the finish. More caramel appeared in the malt profile as it warmed, along with orange peel and cake. Medium bodied, seemed like the attenuation was on the low side due to a bit of a sugary mouthfeel, well integrated carbonation, light alcohol warmth and spiciness. This stuff is quite tasty and very easy to drink, plus the balance is great. Definitely something I'd grab again."
"I actually liked this quite a bit. I'd come back here for sure."
"Pours a hazy, honeyed orange color, fluffy off-white head, not a lot of lacing...tons of floaties in the glass. Rich malty smell, soft grassy hop aroma, very sweet and bready. Sweet caramel taste, some tangerine, a hint of pine, a hint of the alcohol creeps in, but it's nice. Creamy, active little bubbles, very slight lingering hoppy bitterness...it's there, and you know you've been drinking an IPA, but definitely this is a nice change of pace from the hoppier beers I'm so fond of. This is excellent, and I look forward to trying more from this brewery."
"It took a while for me to get through half of this- by the time I got to the second half, it was muuuuch warmer. And it really started growing on me. It became more floral and grassy, the flavor really improved. I'd for sure get this again, and let it warm up more before I drank it. TRY this."
"However, I believe this an authentic EIPA, and for that I think I'm generous with the score."
"Pretty good EIPA. This beer has great balance, something you don't find in most AIPAs. This is one decent beer. Recommended."
"This is a very nice beer. It's not extreme nor is it bland. It's well balanced and easy to drink. I like American IIPAs a lot but this would be nice to have on a regular basis too."
"Very attractive looking corked and caged 750ml bottle. Pours a very attractive golden orange color with a nice creamy off-white head. The aroma is sweet malt and citrusy hops, a lot fainter than what I expected from an IPA. The taste has to be one of the sweetest IPAs I have tasted, almost a honey like sweetness with some hops in the finish. I am not a huge fan of this beer because of the high amount of sweetness. If it was a little less sweet, I think it would be a great brew, I think the hop profile is pretty solid."
"This poured a slightly hazy, dark gold color with good white head. It smelled much sweeter than expected, like lots of caramel malt with some prunes and citrus hops. It tasted very mellow and balanced, like roasted malt and caramel with some sweet citrus hops. It was thick with no carbonation, and had a lasting sugary aftertaste. Overall this was a very sweet and malty beer - hardly what I consider an IPA. But it still had very clean flavor and great body."
"M/D: The beer was full bodied with the right amount of carbonation. Nice bitter aftertaste, but highly drinkable. I will be going back to buy more in the near future and plan to keep it in stock all summer. Exceptional beer. Highly recommend to any lover of the IPA."
"D: I was not impressed with the taste, was expecting more hop flavor and complexity."
"Nice medium bodied mouthfeel, and the carbonation is quite minimal, as if it had been poured from a tap. So there was no extra carbonation like in most bottled beer. Very easy to drink, but the sweetness is a bit over-whelming."
"D - This is an excellent English IPA. I really enjoyed trying this one."
"Would very much like to sample this brew again, wish i could find some smaller bottles of the stuff (750ml was size of the bottle) would love to have a six pack sitting in my fridge."
"Taste: Mirroring the aroma, the fruit and caramel are in it to win it. Fruit is complimented by burnt currant and toasted bread flavors from the malt. Hop flavor comes on mid palate, herbal, grassy and mild. Finish is bready with some lingering earthy flavor from the hops as the malt drops away."
"Good. If I ever get to sample a fresher batch I will re-review."
"Very carbonated, can see it and feel it. Not sure about this- very pricey, but also very different in a good way."
"Drinkability is fairly high as the alcohol is relatively moderate and the flavors are great. Alcohol is also well hidden. Add it all together and we have a very drinkable English IPA. Quite a nice brew."
"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into two pint glasses. Pours a deep gold color with a strong head. The carbonation rose in a cyclone fashion which was preety enjoyable to watch. A lot of hops in the nose. Taste is even hoppier with a dry and bitter finish that takes some getting used to. Pretty different from American IPA's, but still tasty. Overall, a very good IPA. While I prefer American IPA's, this is still a damn good brew."
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer. As an english IPA, this is a nice take as I understand it, and definitely sets it apart from other IPA renditions. As such, it's worth coming back to, provided one knows what it is. Time to try the london porter!"
"D: Good drinkability. nice malt tones add complexity to a good english ipa and is enjoyable."
"It looks like a Hefewiesen in its cloudy yellow appearance. The aroma was mostly clean with subtle hops. Hopheads will not be overly excited about this brew. I thought it was well crafted and would strongly recommend this beer."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and soft, booze is unapparent, body is a shade under medium thickness."
"A friend picked up a bottle of this for a recent tasting. Pours a quite cloudy straw shade with a thick head. Aroma is weak for an IPA. Lots of carbonation, almost tingles like champagne on the tounge. Where's the hops? The hop kick is essential in an IPA and this just doesn't have it. No bitterness. Really disappointed with this English IPA."
"Only my love of all things British allowed me to fork out the ridiculously expensive amount of green it took to buy just one bottle. Orangey amber color had good head retention and decent lacing. Aroma was inviting, a bit of citrus and other fruity notes were evident. This is supposed to be made true tot he original style which was loaded with hops but I didn't think it was that hoppy. Some orangey hoppiness seemed to be the main flavor, a flavor I have detected in some other IPA's but I expected a bit more sharp hops here. All in all not a bad beer by any means and it tasted good in it's way. Just a bit of a letdown and way to expensive."
"CHEERS!"
" However upon first taste one is let down. There is a frothy citrus note leftover in the mouth as sort of an afterthought to lots of carbonation. Not very bitter overall, and somewhat devoid of depth of flavor. Perhaps just overly subtle. I don't know why this beer gets the applause that it does, and it is MOST certainly not worth the coin."
"D - If only it came in smaller bottles...it would be great. Complex without being overpowering. A beer well worth trying."
"Drinkability- This is a damn drinkable and creamy beverage. Every sip gives another taste of hops and malt. This is just what a beer of this style should be. Very nice work from a brewery that I can find no more beers from."
"Recommended..."
"This is easily my favorite English IPA. Well balanced and quite tasty."
"D = This is a great English IPA. One of the most drinkable of the style. If you haven't had it, go for it."
"D: Incredibly drinkable. The fruits and the hops really keep you addicted"
"750 ml caged and corked bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a hazy yellow-orange body with a good inch of rocky off-white head that leaves some lacing and clings to the side of the glass. Smells citrusy, grassy, and herbal (if I had to guess, Fuggles?) Tastes citrusy (grapefruit, orange), grassy, sweet, with some caramel. Full, rich body, though not viscous by any means. Moderate carbonation, enough to leave a semi-clean finish. Wow, very tasty and dangerously drinkable. Far and away the very best example of the style (English IPA) that I have ever encountered. One of the best IPAs of any kind I've had. A bit pricey (9$/bottle), but well-worth the treat."
"At 7.5% ABV, it's a big, but not too big, beer. In moderation it makes a fine session beer. As with most beers, it seemed fresher and better on tap. A tasty treat for anyone looking for a solid IPA."
"D- Very drinkable/sessionable. This one definitely hit me by suprise. I might have to seek it out again."
"Poured hazy orange w/ a four finger off white seafoam head that left a good amount of sticky lace from top to bottom. The aroma was subtle, however I got hints of sweet pear, white grapes and straw upfront. Somewhere in the middle he scent of fresh cut grass and flowers with a doughy finish. I was not so impress with the taste or mouthfeel. Medium body with a toffee sweet beginning that faded out quicky, leaving a light alcoholic and soft carbonation feel. A long lasting bitter ended the drink. Overall, I felt this IPA was on the weak side. Then again I prefer American IPA over English IPA, I feel American IPA has more depth in all catagories."
"Overall well worth the $8.99 I paid for it at the Whole Foods Market in Tualatin."
"M - overriding carbonation, all the bubbles fill the mouth, with lots of air on the swallow, then the hoppy bitterness presents itself."
"the color of light orange peel with a small head of slightly off white foma. Aromas are citrus and hop with some nice fresh baked bread malts as well. This one is not that hoppy for an IPA but for a British IPA it is quite hoppy. Very refreshing, zesty, and drinkable due to the smooth mouthfeel and snappy hop spice flavor. A goodie."
"Overall, a very nice english ipa. A bit pricey, but worth checking out as it has a good complexity and nice flavors that work well together."
"Thanks again, John!"
"D:Very good. Nothing real intense so very approachable. You could even say light enough to drink all day long."
"Near-perfect balance in this brew. I'm going to save a bottle and see how it ages. A buy well worth it."
"Amazing and very different from the traditional piney grapefruit IPAs I am used to. A must try for any IPA fan."
"Overall Impression: Mellow English IPA, easy drinking."
"Still good on tap at Town Hall, 10 months later though liked it better in the bottle."
"750 ml. glass bottle- color of hazy orange, with a thick light cream colored head - nose of dried apricots, yeast, and stale ginger  taste of some hops, citrus (mostly grape fruit, and lemon/lime), and slight malt- body is medium , and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of resin, and some sweet malt"
"Pours a fully clouded orange with a very minimal head. Nose is perfumed and also with hop character. Flavor is very smooth and consistent with hops. There is a definite salty tone. Feel has a lot of bubble and a good liquid feel. Overall this is a good smooth IPA. Nothing showy at all, but more along a traditional line I would say. Nice to try."
"Pours a cloudy orange/peach haze. Nice fluffy head with good lace. The nose is of hops, but not the piney grapefruit hop smell of NW IPAs. the british brew has a subtle nose. The taste is incredibly smooth. Spicy at first, then picks up speed with hops flavors. Very unique hop taste, but still has a nice bitter bite. yet uniquely smooth. Kind of strange, and reminds me more of a cross between a belgian and an american style IPA. Very interesting beer and very very refreshing. good beer from meantime. Recommended. i will say that this beer was in the cellar for a while, so some of the hop flavors may have diminished, and i may have underrated the nose."
"A highly interesting and different IPA. I suspect that it might be even better off after a few years in the cellar."
"I've had a lot of beers that are 5's in smell or in taste, but this is by far the best feeling, best drinking brew I've ever had. The fact that it's still quite hoppy is a bonus you don't even appriciate until the thought hits you."
"Overall: Good for kicks. Give it a try."
"This brew is probably the best English IPA I've had to date ... just tastes like I always hoped my EIPA's did... there is something to do with the hardness of the water. I told Brenda that I would probably never buy this one again, just based on the price... I ""think"" I may have lied a bit."
"D: Really drinkable. Totally unique beer. Definitely worth the $9. Everyone is noting that this is a UK IPA but it would be better described as a historical IPA along the lines of that 4 pack Sam Adams puts out. Well done."
"This has a frustratingly elusive quality, but it's also clearly damn good. Maybe it's one of those beers that tastes wildly different went stored and drank at different temperatures. Maybe it has the kind of complexity that takes awhile to unravel. There's just one bottle here (granted, a nice big bottle), so I can't claim any kind of trusted experience on it. I do know it's an easy-to-enjoy IPA...one that hides it's 7.5% very well...one that clearly differs from its American counterparts. Would love to try their Porter."
" A great beer. Has some more all around heft than I'm used to with an English ale. I'd like to see others follow Meantime's lead."
"looks really nice... hazy light orange. nice frothy white head that diminishes slightly, but pretty much sticks around the whole quaff. nice lace as well. i expected the smell to be a little more pungent, but it is pleasing none the less. nice brit hop profile. citrusy, but not grapefruity. sweet malt and some biscuit. taste was better than the nose suggested. i experienced a well balanced beer that had a generous hopping (dry hopped too), but a hopping that didn't strictly run the show. i enjoyed the sweet malty backbone and long smooth finish with a bite. i just really enjoyed the taste, and the bitter thing i experience in most of the english ipa's i've tried wasn't there. i appreciate the taste of the hop more that way. almost what i would call full bodied, and very soft and silky. i'll have another please."
"Drinkability- Seems more like a well balanced American made IPA than one of English style. Either way it's a great beer that is tops for me in English and one of the better ones under American. I've past this beer by several times because of the $10 price tag, but I will be returning again to try. Excellent job."
"Poured a slightly hazy golden-orange. One finger head that hung around a while. The aroma was lemony and tea-like. The flavor threw me for a loop at first - it was well-hopped, but with English hops, so the profile was different. I tasted crushed children's chewable aspirin at first that soon expanded into an earthy hoppiness that became pleasantly balanced between hop flavor and bitterness. Grainy malt lent sufficient backbone to carry the hop flavors and ale fruitiness."
"I spotted this one at the local grocery store and had to give it a try. I had never heard of Meantime Brewing Company but I was intrigued. The beer pours a golden copper, very hazy with a thick foamy head that lingers. The label warms of a slight haze, and I am certainly not disappointed. The aroma is sharp resiny, piney and herbal hops with a light background of pale malts. Malt sweetness and hop flavor, mostly citrus and pine, appear in the flavor up front. This is followed by a strong, assertive bitterness. I think the beer could use just a bit more malt sweetness to balance the bitterness. I'm curious how true this beer is to 1820's IPA's. I like the idea, I'll have to look for their other beers."
"Now, on the second tasting, I can say that this is one of the best IPA's I've had to date. It does not disappoint. However, this is a beer that should be savored..."
"An interesting beer from an interesting brewery, well worth trying."
"A tasty beverage but a mild IPA. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer but its a simple and subtle IPA. Definitely a british IPA it has slight sweet fruity/citrus start and a subtle hop finish and low carbination. At 7.5% the flavor grows on you and is delicious especially at the bottom of the 750ml bottle. Very worth a try."
"This was a very tasty beer. I hope the rest of Meantime's brews are this good. I plan on trying the Porter next."
"This was one of the best beers I tried at the Charlotte Oktoberfest. Meantime had some very nice selections, but I only went with the IPA and believe I made the right choice. Can tell the alochol is in there, but the hops mask some of it. Nice orange hues with a good head. A bit hard to drink a pint, but I will do my best given the chance next time."
"Pours a cloudy golden amber color with a big foamy off white head that resists fading. Visible effervescence and a few ultra tiny suspended particles. Considerably more sediment on the bottom. A good amount of lacing. The smell is sweet, floral and perfumy. Light bodied, the mouth feel is lightly carbonated, yet slightly sour and smooth. The flavor is lightly lemon and tropical fruits. A nice drinker. Really glad that i had the opportunity to try this one."
"Pours up a lightly hazed peach color with a volumnous light beige head that stays pillowy atop the ale for a good while. Lacing all the way down. Zesty aromas of Fuggles and Golding hops with a bit of honeyed biscuit in the malt department. Malty and sweet upfront moving towards a grassy, herbal hop bite mid-palate and finishing lightly bitter with some lingering fruitiness akin to fuzzy-skinned fruits like apricot and peach. Carbonation is pretty subtle, but ample. Mouthfeel is about average with a good amount of malt to give it a good body. Very drinkable and fresh tasting. One of the better English IPAs to come from across the pond. Rather expensive due to its corked and caged presentation, but I'd have it again."
"This beer pours a hazy red color with bright orange hues. The head is mammoth, billowy, and white. The aroma is floral with a hint of citrus, and a slight, pleasant metalic notes at the end. The taste is like the aroma with a moderate bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than medium bodied. Carbonation is adequate. Overall, this is a very refreshing IPA with a subtle and complex flavor profile. I will certainly drink this again."
"M: Rough on middle-back of my tongue, Harsh first two sips. Smooth as silk afterwards!"
"Overall: First time I have ever seen this beer and let me tell you the bottle is beautiful. It pops open with a bang and pours with charm. The taste is nice. Much different than the US versions of this brew, but very nice in its own right. It's very balanced, hopheads may be disappointed, but you have to give credit to how they really brought out the malts to compliment this one. I really like it and will buy it again."
"Decent beer, with the bitterness levels of a good American IPA, but the hop flavor is somewhat disappointing. I don't find goldings make a great hop flavor when used to excess. Not nearly as complex as many American IPA's in the hop department."
"Drinkability: high, I enjoyed this one and was sad to finish the bottle."
"This is a fantastic IPA, incredibly well made. Truly world class, it's super tasty and easy drinking, and goes down with zero indication of it's ABV, which is formidable, especially for an English Ale. Luckily, it's elegance encourages one to savor the nuances and really enjoy the brew. As they say on the bottle tag, ""Drink the beer and savor the good things in life!"""
"D  Very easy to drink, even at 7.5% ABV - but take your time with this fine example of British craft beer. Its expensive, but I dare say its worth it."
"Pretty great beer. I was afraid of skunking considering it was an import for me with a green bottle, but no such problem."
"Cheers!"
"This is a smooth drinking, almost sessionable IPA. If it weren't for the bottle size (750ml), I would easily be able to put away 3 or 4 of these."
"of hops. Dangerously easy to drink, beware."
"d- thank you, may i have another?"
"Drinkability - Very easy drinking..."
"Most flavorful English IPA that has ever graced my palate! Felt like taking a break from the typical hop bomb IPAs I consume (Stone IPA / Pliny the Elder / Hopsickle) for this and was greatly rewarded with complexity not found in most IPAs."
"Overall I'm very impressed. Not just your average hop-bomb IPA, but something with lots of character and complexity."
"Uncaged and uncorked, this poured with a nice sexy yellow-orange and a poofy, survivable foamy head. The aroma is kinda yeasty, reminiscent of a Belgian golden more than an IPA; the flavor on the other hand is heartily fruity, although theres a big warm undertow, too. This is an interesting interpretation of style, fitting neither the American nor British stereotypes. Again, Id almost guess this as a Belgian ale in a blind taste, except for the sturdy furity (orange blossom, mostly) body. Quite enjoyable, quite different. (#2800, 4/17/2007)"
"Comments: Very enjoyable IPA. Not over-the-top bitter, but excellently balanced with solid malt bill. Good entry into the US market for Greenwich, but a bit pricey at approx. $10.50 for a 750ml."
"Drinkability: While I prefer AIPA's this is a good example of the English style, but it was not altogether without some aspects that reduced its drinkability for me"
"D: For the style, it's right on. Just don't have any pre-conceived notions of what you're getting. Worth trying."
"I've been sitting on this one for awhile. I got a nice loud pop when I removed the cork. Pours a cloudy orange color, nice carbonation, little fizzy off-white head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet/tangy malts/hops, citrus, apricots, and caramel. The taste is sweet/tangy, slightly malty, slightly hoppy, a nice touch of citrus/apriocots, and some caramel thrown in. The finish is quite dry for an IPA though. Medium body. Very drinkable, I really like this one. A very nice English IPA, highly recommend."
"Good call!"
"Large bottle caged and corked, with ""BB"" dating etched onto bottle. Pours cloudy peanut butter amber with a decent amount of sediment especially on the bottom of the bottle. Tan head, cramy and long lasting, leaves respectable splotchy lacing. Nose I get is a touch of lime and some grainy hops. Resiny hops, more lime notes highlight this very charasmatic and worthy full throttle Brit style IPA. Nice to actually try an IPA created in England that has some character and complexity to it. Well worh a try."
"D: Good beer but pretty boring if you are used to West Coast IPAs. But this beer has its own thing going on and its quite quaffable. The 750ml slid down the gullet with ease."
"I love the Meantime India Pale Ale bottle and label. The brewery has done a fantastic job with packaging and has come close to putting a beer into that package that measures up to the best of the style. After Ridgeway's version, this is my next most favorite English IPA. If you're looking for a delicious beer than won't wreck your palate for the rest of the day, this one fills the bill quite nicely. Good stuff."
"Notes: Another brew that grew on me in the span of 30 minutes. At first I thought it was average but as time went on the subtleties showed their face. I cant remember every having an IPA as dry as this and I liked that factor. Odd malt bill is the only detractor although I can see alot of folks digging it, I couldn't get into that part of the beer. Everything else was excellent."
"Drinks easy enough for the abv, I suspect I'd like this fresher. I believe more lively carbonation would bring put the hop profile better. Not a bad EPA though, just believe this bottle-conditioned beer has to be at its peak to bring out the best in it. I will continue to seek out other offerings from this brewery as both this & the porter were pretty tasty IMO"
"Herbal hop bitterness leads things off, and transitions into a mildly sweet and slightly acidic state. Finish is astringent, with the hops reasserting themselves. Notes of tea appear towards the end as well. Decent slick mouthfeel at first, though the bone dryness of the finish is offputting. Overall a good beer, though I prefer an American IPA."
" This full-bodied IPA is thick and very flavorful. Definitely one of the better English IPAs I have tasted. At a modest price of around seven dollars for a 25oz. bottle, It is definitely worth a try. As odd of a brew this is, it definitely has it's perks..."
"I dig this beer; it has a smooth personality. It would be easily overshadowed by a west coast hop bomb, so try to ignore that when you drink it. It definately doesn't have the punch I was built up to from the label. Its got a high level of sophistication that makes it very fun to drink. I think this would rock from a cask. I'm inspired to try their porter now. Cheers!"
"D - Wish I could have this beer every day, but the price and availability limit that option. If you see it, buy one (or several)."
"A copper color, slightly cloudy in the glass, with a inch and half off white colored head forming on top. A surprising malt aroma hits the nose at the start, then after each following scent a hop aroma gains strength, with citrus and earthy aromas. A twinge of alchol is present in the scent as well at the end. The taste starts with that malt flavor, that gradually gives to grapefruit bitterness of the hops that lingers on the palate. a heavier fell than what one would expect, the feel of skim milk, maybe a bad example, but it does have some weight. A strong IPA, particularly for and english style one. This beer brings more hop flavor to the table, and it is most appreciated."
"D - Okay. I might have this again, but I certainly wouldn't pay for it."
"A very nice IPA, very drinkable, and one I'll go back for."
"As it warmed it became harder to drink. Maybe I should have drank faster."
"Drinkable? Well I finished the glass. Not that great to my sense of taste."
"Drinkability: Could drink these all day, if not for the rather high ABV. Speaking of the ABV, it is exceptionally well hidden. A very balanced and lip-smacking beer. Would love to try again, but 10 dollars is a bit steep. Still, one can tell Greenwich/Meantime puts a lot of care into crafting this beer, and it shows in the quality of the brew as well as the beautiful presentation."
"A nice ale, like I said...but I could have spent the $7.99 on much more beer per volume. Oh, well, ya lives, ya learns..."
"Drinkability  This one hit the mark for me. The careful balance and session-style flavors make this a real treat."
"It was expensive and that's too bad because I really like this beer but probably won't repeat the purchase because of the price."
"I do have a slight suspicion that maybe the bottle was bad? When I popped the cork, there was no 'pop'. I basically pulled the sucker out, no fanfare at all...might be the reason for little to no carbonation feeling."
"Drinkability: this is an easy to drink, definite session beer. Worth picking up."
"If I wanted a true English IPA I would reach for this everytime. My personal feeling is that this is not the beer to quench an IPA craving, unless that craving is for an English IPA. Tastes good but not good enough for me to buy again. Those are my personal feelings and did not impact the overall rating."
"Recommended."
"Overall: This is an outstanding IPA, but scoring it is a bit of a problem, as the lackluster head, off color, and very subdued nose detract. Further, IPA lovers expecting a bold hops presence arent going to find it here. Still and all, its an outstanding beer in its own right, and I heartily recommend it."
"A nice enough English IPA, that pulls on authentic DNA, but I honestly feel that the bottled version has too much toffee malt and sweetness though. Given the price I will not be picking this one up again."
"Pours a cloudy golden amber with a thick off-white head that retains impressively. The aroma has some serious english hop character, with lemon, berry, floral and herbal notes, along with some cane sugar, orange marmalade and alcohol...incredibly complex. The flavor also has some serious english hop character, with notes of lemon, berry, herbs, flora and minerals, along with some cane sugar sweetness, toasted bread, fruity esters and an alcohol wallop. The mouthfeel is medium with good drinkability. An excellent english IPA, complex and authentic."
" Wavz"
"I'm not sure if this is the same ber that other reviewers have--it came in the same bottle, but it' odd that I had no head on this beer at all. I actually commented to my husband that it had no carbonation. It's a nice lemony-amber color, slightly cloudy in appearance. There's an herbal/citrus hop bitterness and flavor. It's malty enough that it's definitely an english ipa but has a great hop flavor that balances out the maltiness. Is it drinkable? I'm sure that if it was a little more carbonated it would have a lot more pleasant mouthfeel."
"M&D: softly-carbonated and very creamy on the mouthfeel, allowing the complex flavour profile evolve in its own time without fizzy interruption. The full-body is a natural result of 7.5% alc. strength, but never heavy. Compared with my last note 10 months ago, this bottle seems to feature more maltiness on the palate and more profound fragrance on the nose, yet the aftertaste of bitter and tannic hops remains very impressive indeed. Fantastic to drink~~"
"This is a great English IPA, its just not as bitter as I was expecting, rather its more herbal and floral with a strong malt base. I thought it would be a British version of an American IPA (read: over the top hops), still good though."
"It was alright for an English IPA, just not worth the nearly $10 price tag in my opinion."
"Could honestly drink this all day. Smooth as a IPA can be. Very good"
"Other comments: This is a great beer. Probably the best American-esque IPA brewed in England. It's not as piny or citrusy as the usual American IPA, but there's a kinship there. Scrumptious!"
"D - Lovely stuff. 750ml was quickly gone."
"Copper in cooler, and very hazy, there is a ton of sediment in this beer. Its topped by a fluffy egg-white head that leaves a nice lace on the side of the glass as it settles. The head shows nice retention in the process. The nose is all noble hops. Very floral, a little grassy with a nice citrus back., There is a touch of light caramel on the finish. The flavor is a wonderful balance of hop and malt. More of herbal quality, like fresh cut hay, with a nice citrus lemon bitterness midway through the drink. The malt does show with a nice balancing sweetness. A little caramel and green apple. The mouth feel is slick, and smooth. Really nice drinkability. I think this is a marvelous beer."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle pours a clear light amber color with a creamy white head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass. Citrus, grapefruit and lemon aromas, grapefruit, caramel and lemon flavors. Medium bodied with a full and creamy mouthfeel, an all around great English IPA."
"Bottom line: Best example of an English IPA I've ever tasted and I hope to buy more on my next visit to Colorado. Folks, this is a winner!!"
"Overall - An excellent IPA.... Glad i can now get my hands on this... Highly recommended..."
"Body is nice and full with a very good carbonation and bitterness. Quite drinkable."
"An exceptional beer, quite possibly the best English IPA I've ever had."
"Drinkability: Very much so. I can't help but lavish this beer with uplifting compliments, positive energy, good-cheer thoughts and sugarplums."
"Big 750 mL olive-green champagne bottle with a buncha info about the beer on the label. As I removed the cork, there wasn't much of a ""POP!"" so I was a bit worried it could be flat, but it pours a sediment-laden orange/apricot color with a half inch head that reassures me it isn't flat. It smells citric and soapy with sweet, vinous malts and hints of melon rind that are sharp/tart. It is medium and smooth on the palate with flavors of perfumy/citric hops, soap, the same tart melon rind character, yeast, and a good bitterness that is there to let you know it's an IPA without ruining your palate. Interesting to see an amped-up English IPA designed for the US ""bigger-is-better"" market, and I'd say they hit their mark, I just wish it weren't 10 bucks a bottle."
"A fantastic english big bad ipa, lots of flavour and worth the cash. I'm happy and proud that an english brewery is making such a big bold beer, great drinking such a big beer that isn't a US import"
"The beer came in an elegant looking Champagne style brown-green bomber with the information about the beer printed on contoured labels. Having a wire cage and cork added to the overall refinement of the packaging. As the beer relinquished the confinement to the appointed Imperial Pint glass, the color looked golden amber, the body slightly hazy, carbonation ample, and head well proportioned at two-finger thick. The appearance was pretty spot on for an IPA from either side of the Atlantic, while the smell was that of signature English hops. The restrained spiciness, and full on earthiness of the hops could not be mistaken for anything but Fuggles & Golding. The taste indicated that the hops had been added in amounts typically absent from the beers brewed over there. It wasnt overly bitter, but it was certainly spicy and snappy. There was also a good deal of citric acidity that makes the American versions of the style so quaffable. The very cohesive flavor profile set off fireworks in my mouth with each sip. The body was medium thick and carbonation soft and creamy, i.e., the typical IPA mouthfeel that makes me long for the next sip. Aftertaste was long drawn out and citric. Kudos to Meantime for incorporating the American influences so well, while keeping the beer an English IPA at its heart. Will have to pick up more next time Im at Greens."
"This beer is pleasing to drink, but seemed strong as I had it. I probably wouldn't have wanted to drink the whole bottle, but I'd get it again to share."
"This Meantime poured a slightly dark golden color with about an inch and a half of off white head that leaves light lacing. You can smell the fruity hops and the malty sweetness almost evenly. The taste starts with the sweet malt but citrus hops take over in the end with a little caramel flavor as well . Medium bodied with only slight bitterness from the hops. Shouldn't have any trouble finishing off this big bottle my self. My new favorite English IPA."
"Burning forest in color, with a full lofty foam. Fruit cocktail hop aroma (peaches, apricot, pear), with a touch of floral aromas, along with a mildly vibrant sweet malt, caramel thing going on in the nose as well. Well balanced malt and hop flavor, though it is hop accented. The hops are still fruity, just like the aroma, but they also seem piney and resinous as well. Definately not your typical ""English"" medicinal, antibiotic hop flavor, which some American brewers seem to seize, but rather a fresh, very lively and fitting hoppiness. The malt was very sweet and lingering. Overall, I found it very tasty."
"750 ml bottle, corked and caged. Meantime IPA has a hazy orange topped with a large, white head. The aroma is mainly hops, with citrus and herbal qualities. Bready malt flavor with lots of fruit, including orange and pineapple. Sweet in the middle, but the finish is fairly bitter. There is a herbal hop flavor that I didn't like at first, but it grew on me as the beer warmed. Creamy mouthfeel. Good drinkability. It was by no means a difficult task to finish the 750 ml bottle on my own. It's a bit expensive, but worth it."
"Wow what a nice bottle presentation. Poured golden and hazy. Great smell of hops  definitely not an American IPA but the british IPA with use of fuggles and goldings. There are some great flavors of fresh baked bread, pear jam and pineapples. Crisp, clean with enough body and alcohol to tell you this is a serious pale ale. I wish I had seen this in England.$11.99 @ Chevy Chase Wine in DC."
"The aftertaste is bitter, with some floral notes. I am not enamoured of this beer, but given the storage situation where i bought it that may be part of the issue."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a frothy 1 1/4"" off-white head above the clear golden amber brew. Head fades quite slowly, and light, delicate lacing is prevalent, not unlike a cask ale would produce. Aroma is balanced, yet that does not indicate boring, as hops and malt sweetness are present. Taste is also cask-like to my tastebuds, with sedate grains giving way to ample lightly fruity hoppiness, more than what the style classification would lead you to expect. Mouthfeel and drinkability are superb, would love to find this one locally, perhaps for a bit cheaper, and revisit over and over."
"Moouthfeel- First pour was in the traditional IPA vein of dry and hoppy as far as the palate was concerned. The second pour was a rich hop and malt palate that this beer went great with my corned beef hash and pickles lunch swimmingly."
"The after it's de-corking for the 750ml brown bottle resides in the glass a beclouded amber with a prestigious creamy light tan head, the lace forms a tight skirt around the glass. Nose is rich in hops, sweet malt, and a citrus-like crispness that makes the mouth water, start is sweet with a pleasing grain profile, the top is middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is nicely hopped, mildly acidic and the aftertaste desert bone dry, a nice IPA, that hits the ""B" spot after a long day of toil and trouble, worth a sample."
"750ml corked bottle. Cloudy amber colored body with a quick rising tall off white foamy head. Nice rings of lace as the head drops. Citric and floral hops come out quite nicely in the aroma with a solid malt backbone. A bit of hop juiciness with some caramel rounds it out. Flavor starts with some sweet caramel and bready malts before the hops come on again. Citric hoppiness adds a nice bitter edge along with some earthy notes. Nice strong flavor that is fairly balance while letting the hops take center stage. Finish is a nice lingering dry grapefruit bitterness. Plenty of body to carry the great flavor and quite smooth. Really easy drinking stuff to boot. If this was a little bit cheaper and more available locally I would definitely make it a regular."
"Pours a clear straw color, good head and nice lacing. Aroma is hoppy, but not reconizable to me. A good mix of citrus, grassy hops, and a slight dash of spicy hops. Flavor is remarkably balanced. Slightly sweet up front, and then that's washed away by the hops. Mouthfeel is okay, a touch thin, but the carbonation is nice. This is a winner in my book."
"Drinkability is good, very enjoyable big but not strong, 7.5% no noticed at all. One of the best English IPA's I have had. Pricey but worth it."
"Flavor hits with juicy floral and leafy hops, backed up by sweet and chewy malt. Light notes of toffee and butter. A well-balanced IPA, maintains sweetness and a very drink-more-of-me profile throughout."
"[a big thanks to LuckySevens82 for this brew - what a find!]"
"Very likeable IPA that seems to be brewed for the hopped up American market. I will be looking for this one again."
"Absolutely required reading here."
"Solid English IPA character, this one is a good performer. And you know what, this packaging does it all for me, it just reeks of class. Even though a bottle runs about $10, it's still worth every cent of it. Better than spending $10 on a bottle of mediocre wine, and much more enjoyable with food."
"This is certainly not anything like your standard, subtle English IPA; this is full flavored, including a bracing bitterness that is not typically associated with an English beer. I definitely like this beer, better than I allowed myself to hope for. This is certainly balanced, but I do like the differing hop notes that play against each other."
"A beer that I have noticed a few times in the area and never picked up now I have and looking forward to it,poured a slightly hazy golden with a a real orange hue with a frothy two finger head on top leaving a sheet of lace behind as it settles.Very herbal,minty aromas due to the large dose of fuggles thrown in with a nice caramel undertone.Well balanced but with a real nice big hop profile,herbal ""green"" flavors hit ya but the big caramel sweet malt backbone holds up well even showing thru at times.Wow this is a nice big English IPA more subtle than some American counterparts but thats fine,well made and a treat to drink."
"Beer is good. Happy English trad beering. Perhaps one could argue that this is too soft, but it adds charm to this creation."
" The mouthfeel is slightly carbonated, and very smooth. The drinkability is good, owing to the low ABV and balanced, mild flavor. I would buy this again if it were cheaper."
"Overall, very very drinkable, and very enjoyable. Certainly one of the best English IPAs I've ever had."
"""Remove cork, hold glass open end up, pour, taste, swallow."""
