"Great citrus nose, really well balanced taste. Definitely a winner

"Great citrusy taste and a good alcohol buzz. Good stuff, my top 5"

"I'm quite glad that I got this chance to try Great Lakes' Chillwave. Were this available in Georgia this juicy, delicious explosion of hops would find regular refuge in my refrigerator. Certainly worth a try for any hophead."

"Good frothy finger high head, mixed bubble sizes makes for uneven surface, light tan color, excellent retention, the lacing is very thick and covers wide swaths of the glass side. The liquid is as close to red as orange, very deep and glowing, at first you could miss seeing the tiny bubbles meandering within, very pretty to look at. Thick, clingy nose of molasses, pine sap, pink grapefruit pulp, it’s more spicy and smoky than herbaceous, pineapple, mango, nectarine, apricot fruit scents, more chocolate and malt appears as it warms, ends with even more smokiness like meat fat on a grill. Full-bodied, beef jerky, iron and slightly soapy, sticky in a dry residue fashion. Plenty of pine and grapefruit, tangerine citrus, here you get a bit more herbal stiffening but not enough to inch into “refreshing” territory. Cocoa, caramel, molasses sweeten the finish. The carbonation seems to be at an average plus level but the beer is so dense you need even more. Cherry, pineapple, nectarine, peach, mango fruit, in keeping with the whole more heavy than juicy and flowing. It’s a good enough brew but not sure I’d want more than one in a sitting."

"This is the best Double IPA i have had so far. The taste is phenomenal and goes down smoothly, very easy to drink"

"Overall- I've had this in four packs and even before the name change but like all beer (to me) it's better from the tap. I remember the hops being not so pungent from the bottle. I will say I do appreciate a imperial ipa or even a standard ipa that isn't blasted with bitterness that it mutes the hop flavor."
""
""
""
"Proof that beer ratings don't always sway the palate, I went into this one super excited only to leave disappointed. While not a bad beer by any stretch, it isn't a 95 in TheIPAHunter's® book. Picked up two 4-packs prior to my fantasy baseball draft and left 6 of them in Pennsylvania to be shared by others who may enjoy the flavor profile more than me. You get hints of Mosaic hops in the nose and the taste, but the malt addition is a bit too much for my taste. I believe this was done to drown out the ABV and, while it works, it's to the detriment of the wonderful citrus notes that Mosaic hops can provide. Glad to have tried, but won't be seeking this one again in the near future."
""
""
""
""
"Wanted to love this based on reviews but just don't get it. Pours syrupy, dark golden and looks great. Leaves one hell of a lacing but has a strange aroma. taste was overly bitter on the mid palate and finished with an indescribable off taste, maybe oxidation? Ended up pouring this one out."
"Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer.  not Pliny, but certainly a superb rendering of the style. Luscious tropical fruits, beautiful hops, nice malt presence.  recommended"
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pain the butt. I should have to write reviews if I dont feel like I want to.  I believe that we are all responsible adults on this site and the drop downs are more than enough and if we want to write a review we can"
"This is just a really good DIPA."
""
""
""
"The big kicker was that the malt backbone covers up the alcohol AND hop taste. Yes, it is awesome that this is 9.4%, but I don't mind a little alcohol taste and I want to have those hops upfront and personal with a double IPA. Too much malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best DIPA's out there"
""
""
""
""
"A really juicy hop forward DIPA with tons of citrus.  Not a whole lot of malt balance but it does carry some sweetness to keep it from getting out of hand.  The citrus does hit hard up front but backs off a bit.  Something I'll defintely pick up again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect blend of sweet malt and piney/citrusy hop favors.  Great DIPA."
""
""
""
""
"O: Chillwave DIPA from GLBC is an amazing DIPA with a top-tier aroma and unique, new-school hop presence with berry-melon accent on a more traditional citrus-pine base with stellar feel -- an exceptional DIPA with IIPA ABV. Wonderful brew!"

"incredible. first time trying a great lakes beer.  one of the best dipa's ive ever had"
""
""
""
""
"I'd love to re-review this one uber fresh. So far, this Californian is more impressed with Ohio than Vermont."
"A fine mix of sugar, clover and malt from what I perceived. Very tasty, the mouth feel can be mistaken as slightly syrupy although it seems that there is a subtle note of orange and orange peel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic beer. Amazing nose, very drinkable for the high abv"
""
""
"Very sweet DIPA. Almost syrupy. I see the very high reviews for this and wonder if I got an off batch, but I'm not in love. I get very little hop presence. Nothing offensive, but not a beer I would get again."
""
"Sorry guys but I could tell right away this was a malty dipa.. Def not my sweet spot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great Double IPA. A lot of mango and citrus qualities. Glad I bought the last 4 pack. Want this on tap."
""
"The good reviews for this one are right on. Nothing new that i could say."
"12 oz bottle poured in a can glass.  Citrus aroma, and the Mosaic hops are good.  Very smooth for a double IPA.  Incredible well balanced, but still hop forward.  Outstanding beer that you can keep on drinking."
""
""
"Being in GA it is only when I travel that I can get my hands on Great Lakes brews.  I find their products to be consistent with style and always clean front and back. I stumbled on Chillwave in a craft shop in NC.  I have not been able to acquire Heady Topper or Pseudo Sue, but I can't imagine anything better than this CW stuff.  Bronze color, floral and citric aroma with a malty wildflower honey background, and a taste that follows perfectly.  CLEAN crisp and absolutely delicious.  The best 2xipa I have found to date.  I am going to have to find a recipe clone for this.  Highly recommend!"
""
""
"Best IPA they they brew."
""
""
""
""
"Clear copper color with a one-finger head that faded to a thin film, but left some nice lacing. Smell was big tropical and citrus fruit, with some slight piney aromas. The taste was of pineapple, mango and grapefruit, with a nice sweet malt backbone. Very complex, but all the flavors were distinct, yet well blended. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, with a nice crisp finish. Overall, this is one outstanding beer. Well done, Great Lakes!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor profile is world class.  It is reasonably intense, rather complex and very well balanced.  The 9.4% alcohol is evident only in the finish.  It begins with a burst of sweet fruit that separates into mango, passion fruit and orange.  The middle effervesces into a mild orange rind bitterness over a fading caramel base sweetness with a touch of spicy pepper.  The finish is a lingering subtle rind bitterness with alcohol notes."
"Honestly one of the best dipa IMO. Great hops, great taste, with a slight sweet finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A real gem. Up there with the other juggernauts of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth - that ABV is just lurking in the background, ready to pounce."
""
""
""
""
""
"Everything about this DIPA is just fantastic, one of the best out there"
""
""
""
"This is a great DIPA! I love the hop and malt profiles and how well they blend together!"
""
""
""
"Amber-copper-honey-orange colored, with a moderate-sized white head and some lacing.  A strong aroma of big, hoppy goodness with grapefruit, pine and resin most prominent, the same notes also carrying over into the flavor.  Medium bodied with nice hop bitterness on the backend, but not at all as bracing as West Coast examples.  I prefer just a tad more malt backbone (there's a hint of honey sweetness and some tropical fruits), but still fairly well balanced.  Better than many of the current crowd favorites that are all hop aroma and flavor with no malt and no bitterness at all.  This is a great beer."
"Received a bottle of Chillwave Double IPA from a friend.  What a very good IPA.  Very hoppy but not too much.  Great tasting IPA that I would drink again.  The look, the feel; all rolls up into a beer that I would recommend!"
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I haven't had the pleasure of drinking a truly """juicy""" IPA in a while. My only regret is that I wasn't able to seek this one out sooner. My calculations put this one at about 6 weeks old and experience with scores of IPAs tells me that's about a month older than its peak flavor. That being said this was a very good DIPA. Would I drink it again? Yes, hopefully at the brewery some day."
""
""
""
"First Great Lakes brew. Aroma is superb. Tangerines, mango, apricots. Hoppy juicy mouthful followed by piney resin finish. A little alcohol on the finish. Went and got another 4 pack."
""
"Perfect beer for hop heads who want that great, bitter flavor. The aroma on this brew is what really sets it apart and makes it unique. As an Ohioan who loves Great Lakes and Ohio brews, this is one of my favorites!"
""
"If the alcohol taste wasn't so ever-present it would be phenomenal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- really good DIPA. Up there in the upper echelon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice ruby color, solid head. Smells fruity maybe a little cherry blossom and honeydew. Taste follows the nose but is more boozy.  Reminds me of hopslam"
"Not my style. Not bad, just not my style.."
""
"One of the best double IPA's I have ever tasted.  Incredibly balanced, nice hop vs. fruit hit, great drinkability.  Not nearly as bitter as you would expect for 9+ ABV (will sneak up on you quickly if having more than one).  Terrific IPA!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - 4.5"
""
""
""
""
""
"A really great IIPA, goes down way too smooth!"
""
""
""
""
"Just had my first one last night and I have to say it's a really solid DIPA.  Still not up there with Heady, Pliny, Dinner, but it belongs with that crowd as it is extremely drinkable and has an amazing aroma."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great DIPA."
""
""
"O - This, admitedly, is my favorite style, and I found this to be a worthy contender for the upper echelon of the category. The fact that it is available and decently priced here is a plus."
""
""
""
"Never would have guessed this was 9.5 ABV.  Mosaic hops really shine through and balance the high alcohol nicely.  Need to get some more of this before it is gone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Really glad I was able to get my hands on a 4 pack of this, great flavors and super well balanced. Great Lakes Brewing is putting out some really good brews, super happy with them. This might be my favorite from them."
"Very well done.  A little darker amber, looking more on the English style.  Aroma is nice and floral, not overly citrusy or piney but balance.  Taste is very hoppy but not overly bitter.  There is a nice honey sweetness that balances the beer nicely.  Very smooth and finishes clean.  Very well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours golden amber with an off white head, which sticks around. Aroma offers some honey, florals, peach,toast and just a touch of alcohol. Flavor is sweet and fruity; honey, peach and orange with light pine in the finish and some toasted caramel(?) malt underneath. Very mild alcohol, felt more than its tasted. A medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, glad I gave this a second chance because I like it a lot more this time around. Not my favorite of the style, probably a touch sweeter than I needed, but I am definitely a fan. Would drink again happily."
"Big Edmund Fitgerald fan and a hophead so grabbed one when I first saw it.  This is very well made, smooth hoppy, high ABV beer that hits the mouth smoothly and goes down easily.  Surprisingly a little sweet on the tongue. Wow, 9.5 barely noticeable. Very, very hoppy with little secondary flavor like citrussy or floral.  I'm repeating...very smooth, high ABV not noticeable, but I guess I was hoping for something really exceptional from Great Lakes in a double, some kind of unique flavor touch. But you won't be disaapointed either way."

"Look is a good amber color  mild carbonation.   Smells off the hook  tropical  pineapple mangoes maybe passion fruit.  Taste is the same  huge tropical notes with a slight malty mouth.  Feel is full and thick with a great aftertaste.  Overall  a great beer. Cheers  great Lakes"
""
"This is an exceptional DIPA.  I happen to prefer a more hop-centric and floral nose in IPAs / DIPAs and that is the only detractor (if you could call it such) in my review.  I am glad to have a couple more bottles to enjoy!"
"OMG. This is my new favorite."
"Loads and loads of fruit and tropical taste and smell.  Reddish/orange tint to it.  Not a lot of head.  One of the most delicious IPAs I've had."
""
"This is an excellent DIPA, with a great hop profile without ignoring a great malt body. Big beer, but very drinkable."

"Another fantastic Great Lakes beer"
""
""
"Been waiting patiently like a monk for this offering. LOVE the GL seasonals, absolute standouts. Medium amber with a hint of head into the tulip (my BA bro Jens4212 supplying the fresh bottle, and sampling side by side). Grapefruit, passion fruit, tropical fruits (he mentioned papaya, I haven't had it), some bitterness also standing out in the aromas. Huge mango explosion on the front of the tongue for me, some warming alcohol, and just the juiciest, tropical IPA you could want. Finishes crisp and clean, with a hint of the tropical note. Excellent inspiration for what can be done with those HOPS! The circle of fantastic GL seasonals has been completed. I'd recommend trying them all."
""
"Best beer I've ever had"
""
"O: This beer is drinking a lot better than I remember it from last year.  It has some interesting bitterness on the end and it's a touch overly sweet but it's got a lot of fruit flavors that pop.  I had this when it was alchemy hour and thought it was mind bending last year as Chill a Wave not so much.  It is tasting pretty damn good now."
""
"Doing a side-by with juju. Deeper orange color. Incredible hop aroma. Full citrus. Juju thicker and sweeter and smoother. Tie. Ohio rocking the IPAs. I was almost going to skip buying Chillwave in bottles. So glad I didn't. One of Great Lake's best."

""

""

"Too sweet. It kills the hop flavor. Unfortunately unimpressed..."
""
"This is a very fruitful and pine tasting beer. Bronze color with a full flavor and feel. Overall a very hoppy and fruity taste."
"very good IIPA from Gl.. nice to get to try it.."
"Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA and one I highly recommend. The beer has a whole bunch of notes that makes it taste like a tropical paradise, and definitely a welcome sight during the cold."
""
""
"F:  perfect carbonation. As Lawrence Welk used to say """ tiny bubbles""""
""
""
""
""
""
"Huge. Citrusy. Fresh. Just loads of orange peel, mango, passion fruit, fruit punch. Incredible mouthfeel. Reminds me of a bigger and much better nugget nectar."
"Great beer by a great brewery"
""
""
""
""
"Great brew, for very little hype if any this DIPA blew me away"
""
""
""
"T: same as smell with a slight hop finish F:Creamy O: to bad they don't have this all the timeYUMM"
""
"O.  There is not much I could say bad about this beer.  I was expecting it to be good but not this good.  1 of the best DIPA's i've ever had hands down.  I WILL be going back for more."
""
""
"Wanted it. Got it. Was not let down. Experienced a beer alchemy hour with this brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Chillwave. 12oz bottle poured into tulip. Slightly hazy copper orange with off-white head that settles to a ring and islands. Aroma is orange juice, pineapple, mango, caramel, grass, and bread. Taste is strongly sweet for the style with tropical fruit juice and caramel notes followed by spicy, peppery hop bitterness. Alcohol wafts through on the swallow. Medium body, thick resiny texture, shy of moderate carbonation, grassy bitterness on the finish with some residual sugar."
"Fantastic rare breed of beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Aroma is pine, citrus and big hops. The flavor is grapefruit, fruit, hop resin, mild sugar/sweetness notes and a tangy/bitter/warming finish."

"Right out the gates I was expecting a big hop presence, I really didn't get waves of dank hops as expected, instead it's a rather smooth and subtle taste, not bad b any means. Just not what I was expecting, malt has more of a role than with most double IPA's. At 9.4% I was expecting a taste bud buster. That never happen... It is ridiculously smooth and drinkable for being so high gravity. It just doesn't seem to crave that dank mouth watering hop bill that I have came to love with some of the other DIPA's. Low burn and easy to drink makes it worth seeking~"

"Best IPA I've had thus far."

"Absolutely perfect nose of Mosaic happiness and just a hint of honey like sweetness.  Luscious grapefruit and orange bomb that somehow defines and defies the idea of a """balanced""" IPA.  Amazing when fresh yet still impressive when unintentionally aged.  Perfect beer in my book.  5+"
""
""
"One of my all time favorites! Loved it when it was named Alchemy Hour and love it now with the new Chillwave name. THE TASTE STAYED THE SAME!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark golden amber with slowly fading off white head. Aroma is of caramel malt, citrus, orange floral pine hops, nice fruity essence. Taste is sweet caramel malt, yeast, citrus orange, a bit of tangy grapefruit, earthy pine hops bitterness. Palate is a full body, smooth with good carbonation. The finish is of caramel malt, yeast, citrus orange peel notes, some tangy grapefruit, with some good earthy pine and herbal hops bitterness for balance, alcohol is well behaved. Overall a very good, smooth and enjoyable brew."
""
"Almost as good as the El Dankerino :)"
"Medium amber body. Drinking on tap. Mild hoppy aroma. Bitter grapefruit taste with a hint of sweet apples at the end. Different and delicious."

"O - A great fruit forward DIPA: probably the best example I've had yet in that range of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste is a wallop of thick, lavish hops. I get citrus again and plenty of tropical notes along the way. As well, a fairly large malt presence underscores the hop assault for balance. The body here is heavy, taste is heavy (yet, as before, balanced), and oh-so-easy to drink. A superlative IPA!"
"Arguably the most under rated best IPAS ever. This rare IPA is great. Border line dangerous because how tasty it is. This double is a must try. Used to go by alchemy hour I believe but re packaged as chill wave. Great flavor retention and hard to believe there's any alcohol in it. Very refreshing. But not surprised these guys are great."

"Final Word: A fantastically balanced Double IPA! While the description of the flavors might have seemed fairly straightforward or basic, it’s how rich and balanced those flavors are that makes this beer special. The hop forward nature of the brew allows the flavors and aromas of the hops to be fully expressed and experienced, while still giving the balancing malts their time to shine in the finish. Hop heads will love the strong flavors of their favorite ingredient, while those of us looking for drinkability still have a beer that finishes smoothly and easily! This beer is a must try for any beer lover, and is a great IPA to keep on hand. Drinkers unaccustomed to strong hop profiles might still be overwhelmed by the hop flavors here, but anyone with a few IPAs under their belts will find this beer very satisfying!"

"Amazing smell.. one of the best. Great mouthfeel. The taste is an explosions of orange and grapefruit, how I like them. There is a sweetness there, but it's not over the top. It's hoppy as you'd expect a DIPA to be, but not over the top and astringent like some. Honest, this is the bets DIPA in Ohio. Somet think Bodhi is amazing.. it's good.. but THIS is hands down the best DIPA for this state. I do miss the Alchemy Hour name though!"

"O- Just wow. I wish this was available year-round. Im glad its readily available when it is released, as this is a job well done by Great Lakes. I like my IIPAs juicy and hop-forward and that's exactly what this is. One of my go-to ales when its out."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas."
"O: A solid offering for a double IPA that doesn't attempt to reach too far to be overly complex. But rather does a very solid offering of hops with bold malts, a clean and uncomplicated brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a dark golden orange body with good head and lace patches with an aroma that can be described as both citric hopped and touches of grapefruit sweetness as well as some caramel/sugary goodness. Medium-bodied beer that goes down easy and has both a citric hop and grape profile that is balanced with some caramel sweet malt for a beer that is both hoppy and sweet. Nothing earth shattering or new in this beer but it sticks to the """rules""" and does the style justice."

"Returned with a fresher bottle to make sure I know if i initially tried this beer past its prime. Oxidization is gone. Mosaic hops are much more distinct. Mosaic onion hops, which I enjoy. Was definitely fresher this time but I leave this beer with a very similar rating to my initial experience with it. Bumped up from a 3.99."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've found it hard to disagree with a single beer Great Lakes brews and Chillwave is no exception. There are a lot of great fruity and earthy hop complexities to this beer; enough to hold it's own again some of the top dogs of the style. Great beer, bro!"
""
"great job great lakes!  nice citrusy with a nice bitter balance.  doesnt look like its going to taste, but surprised on the good side."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Pretty solid stuff here most noteable due to freshness. I believe this is the most hoppy offering I have had by Great Lakes and while it was good, it seemed a little malt heavy."
""
""
""
""
"Very solid malt backbone and interesting mosaic hop profile - great beer! Taste is a bit on the sweet side but it's a high gravity beer so I'm not surprised. It's too bad this beer isn't more widely distributed because it is a nice change from the west coast ipas (which I love)."
"Mouthfeel: Thick sticky and tasty is the best way to describe this beer."

"Distinctly different hop profile than Pliny, much more fruity and probably the best example of a """"new wave""" IPA i have had, with the cutting edge fruity hops, while Pliny stands as the classic and best crafted western IPA. Most comparable DIPA I have had was Enjoy By 4/20/14"

"Great Lakes Chillwave Double IPA may not be groundbreaking for the style, but it is a really solid and flavorful rendition nevertheless. Fans of more balanced, hoppy beers should definitely seek this one out."
""

"Drink- It's good, but wasn't expecting a Hopslam clone just smaller. A nice offering from a good brewery."

"I lived in Cleveland for four years in my 20s and probably have more experience with Great Lakes than any other brewery. I've tried all of their regular beers and many of their seasonal beers. I've also been to the brewery twice. This is by far my favorite beer of their's. Usually I find Great Lakes beers too hoppy and bitter. This one is just right though, which is funny considering it's a double IPA. I love the way it looks in the glass. It's just gorgeous. A sort of orangey yellow haze that makes me excited just looking at it. The taste is almost fruity. Tropical fruit. In a good way though. I don't know what else to say. Just try it. I buy it whenever they have it at the grocery store."

"Overall: I wish I could rate this higher, but I've had honey that was less sweet. I won't rule out the possibility that this lost some character in transit, or that my palate is fatigued, but this just doesn't do it for me as a DIPA."
""
""
"D - It's a bit surprising, but rather refreshing that in a craft beer world with an over abundance of American Double IPAs, there can still be very pleasant surprises like this that are completely unique... This is world class for the style and I couldn't provide the slightest constructive criticism as this one hits on all cylinders... Highly recommended..."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is good, but not great."
""
""
""
""
"This is a strong, drinkable beer. It's a little heavy for me. Not the alcohol content, but the overall beer itself. I would enjoy a little bit more of a hop kick."

"It pours a standard copper color with small head/lacing. The smell is dominant tropical fruits with a hop presence... love it. Initial taste follows the nose, but it quickly fades and ends with a very bitter finish. There is no mistaking the 9.4 ABV in this brew. Overall, it's outstanding for the style, and I'm looking forward to having this fresh on tap from the brewery."

"O: boldly-hopped but oily-smooth """IPA"""... I'm not sure I'd pour this into a snifter, though I'm sure it helped better concentrate the aromas - a balloon or tulip would be more desirable - display some head, see where it goes... this is a bit of an odd hoppy beer - drinks more like a hop cordial... perhaps worth a second chance"
""
""
""
""
"Very drinkable beer here that I could easily quzzle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is the best DIPA I have tried in some time. I imagine this is the Midwest's version of Heady Topper. Seek it out!!!"
""
""
"Overall a really good beer where the taste can't quite live up to the smell. Fantastic, fantastic smell, maybe top 5, but the flavor does not quite live up to the smell. Still, try it if you can, it's good."

"Overall - Chillwave is a very nice variation to a """traditional""" double IPA. The mango-like hops make for a very drinkable 9%er. The only flaw I can think of is the lack of lingering carbonation, which would only add to the complexity of this beer. I would definitely drink this again."
""
""
"**I'm still kind of new to IPAs and craft beer in general. I'm finally starting to taste the difference between different IPAs. This one and dirt wolf are both awesome. Just picked up a bomber of the collab black double IPA by 3 Floyds, Surly, and Real ale brewing. Going to share with a friend and review soon.**"

"Overall: A wonderful DIPA. Full in favor and body. For a true hop head, which i happen to be, you can't ask for much better. I will be reaching for this more often"
""
""
""
"Very nice. I’m a fan. I don’t think I could drink more than one of these given the sweetness. Scratch that, I could definitely have another. The fruits are nice and full with plenty of well rounded out flavors. The honey malt is definitely coming into play. I can’t say much about this beer; I’m not saying its one dimensional, but it is definitely big on sweet fruit flavors. Do try."

"very excellent brew! the DIPAs on the east coast have a very distinct way to them.... I like 'em!"
""
""
"Pours a dark amber with orange and light brown coloring. Smells delicious - lots of sweet citrus, mango and maybe even pineapple. Taste is just as good - tastes like delicious mangos and clementine. Tastes unbelievably fresh."
""
"Overall: Damn this is a great DIPA. I'm amazed at how balanced it is, how fruity it is, yet it still stays true to its character. Go get it, drink it, and be merry!"
"I think Great Lakes should make this all year round if possible. This was quite the beer."
""
""
""
"o - overall, really nice. Worth checking out if you can get your hands on it."
"Overall: the aroma is phenomenal, I also appreciated the bubblegum flavors from both the aroma and taste (not sure if everyone gets this; we all have different palettes). Just wish there was a little more oomph in the fruits."
""

""
""

"Really nicely done Imperial Pale Ale done up in a popular style, which is a tall hop bill with just enough malt to support the bitterness. Chill Wave very much reminds me of an imperial version of Long Trail Limbo IPA in many respects."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a good version of the style. To me, it doesn't rank near Sucks,Hopslam, or Enjoy By. However, I would recommend it to lovers of the style and would drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is really good. Plenty of different hop aromas and flavors happening while some sweet malt tastes lay a nice foundation for a lingering, pleasurable aftertaste."
""
""
"O: Oh yeah, this rocks. The sweetness of this beer is pulled off nicely, coexisting beautifully with both the savory and tropical notes. Great Lakes pulls another winner out of its hat: I really wish these guys distributed to my state."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a dark, burnt orange; almost amber. On the nose I got a heavy dose of candied tropical fruit. Sweet mango is jumping out, along with some tartness. Taste is incredibly sweet, with lots of malty caramel. Finishes with mild bitterness. Mouthfeel was fine. Just kind of a meh beer for me, and way too sweet for where my palate's at. Needs more hoppy bitterness to balance things out."
"Chillwave is a free swinger, a bigger beer with nectary, pungent hops. And it adds another dimension to the Mosaic hop enigma this time bringing kiwi and copious amounts of stone fruit into the fold."
""
"The citrus/grapefruit taste isn't overbearing and works well with the hops to give a nice Double IPA, highly recommend it!"
""
""
"Pours a clear honey-gold body with thick foam staying around 3 fingers thick; tight lacing all around. Wonderful sticky hops in the aroma. Flavor is more mellow; crisp caramel malt mixed with hop juice but very balanced, maybe a bit too much? Bitterness is not strong and ends in a real sweet tooth. Very drinkable but disappoints a little as i found it a bit too tame."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"With the caramel and honey malts and fruit-forward hop profile, this is an interesting Spring DIPA. In some aspects, that malt profile reminds me of a Maibock, but the hops clearly take it into IPA territory. Nice use of Mosaic hops. Recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Great DIPA and an annual treat--sweeter to me than Hopslam."
""
""
""
"It has similar to both Hopslam with its chewy mouthfeel and pine, but also Nugget Nectar for its big candy sweetness. In the end, the beer is a bit lacking on the front of fruity hop notes. The sweetness probably masks that and is a detractor."
"O - This is now my favorite DIPA. I love Stone's IPA's; however, Great Lakes does a fabulous job on this brew. Highly Recommended ! Cheers!"
""
"pours a nice amber with a finger and a half off white head. Amazing smell, like canned peaches. Fresh fruit flavors follow in the taste with a nice bitterness. This beer is just about perfect imo and hangs with two of my other faves, dirtwolf and lagunitas sucks. Buy this!"
""
""
"Overall, this is my first encounter with Chillwave, but it won't be my last. I'm a guy that likes some type of balance in my IPAs. This one has it all. Even after one 4-pack, I would catapult it right up there with my other favorited DIPAs: Dogfish Head 90 Minute, O'SO Lupilin Maximus, Lagunitas Maximus and Hopslam. This is the first Great Lakes offering I've sampled, but won't be my last. This is an excellent example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Bright copper orange in color with good clarity. Poured with a dense white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Aroma was a well balanced blend of caramel malt, grapefruit, and ripe pineapple with pine notes at the end. Medium bodied with slightly oily feel beneath pleasantly robust, rich carbonation. A maltier, fuller bodied feel than expected for a higher octane DIPA. Grapefruit and ripe pineapple hop flavors over a sturdy caramel malt backbone. Minty hop flavor near the end with a musty, citrus hop aftertaste. Booziness is there but is superbly masked by the aromas and flavors. "
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a gorgeous deep clear amber with a nice big creamy white head. The head has moderate retention but a nice collar, leaving nice lacing. The aroma is big citrus hops (grapefruit ntoes) and a subtle hint of caramel malts. The flavor is good but a little one-dimensional when compared to the aroma, with the hops dominating and little depth from the malt. The mouthfeel is thinner than I'd like for a DIPA, but all in all, this is still a very good beer."
""
""
""
"A very nice DIPA – no flavor of alcohol – just a slow burn after it hits the stomach. The appearance and aroma are very pleasing although I like a little more lacing. The flavor seems muted to me, with the citrus being more pronounced in aroma, and just the grapefruit bitterness showing up a minute or two after swallowing. Overall, another good beer from Great Lakes in Cleveland."

"O: Very solid Double IPA, definitely not a disappointment by any means!"
"O: a really solid beer, great lakes does not disappoint"
""
""
"Overall a nice double IPA. I've had it before and remember it being mud more flavorful, full or citrus and pine notes. However this bottle has too much alcohol in the nose, only slightly dissipating in the taste. Tends to overwhelm everything else. Still worth trying, though, since this brewery makes really great brews."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hopbomb, not bad but not really my style."
"O- A really outstanding Dipa, not the best I've had but right up there, probably top 10, there are just so many good ones now...and so little time!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very good citrus-forward west coast style IPA. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"O: The bottle I had was very fresh and very delish. I've had a lot of GL over the years and they have been solid, but this one blew me away. Big juicy aromatic and a great combination of hop flavors. I would compare it to Head Hunter or even Dirt Wolf with less dank."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle pour from recent batch nice fluffy white head solid good lacing and well carbonated. Nose is sweet malt, mango, alcohol and a touch of resin. Taste is vegetal, bready and boozy. The strength of the beer overshadows the hop profile which is a shame. Mouthfeel is great for a DIPA with great bubbly medium-high mouth coating. On the whole I am continuously let down by this one. I had it when it was released under another name and a few bottles of this year's and think the flavor is just a disappointment. I would not grab this on tap even if it was same day fresh."
""
""
"O: Solid DIPA from Great Lakes; well worth picking up."
""
""
"Overall - one of the best Great Lake beers if not my favorite. I hope to find this in tap somewhere!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a semi-opaque hazy copper with a touch of fluff gracing the surface. The aroma is wonderful: juicy fruits, powerful hops, almost a buttery note lurking in the depths. Not a trace of the ABV. Taste follows the nose: bright hops, grapefruit and mango, and a wonderfully sweet yet subtle malt backbone. An excellent brew, and one I'll keep an eye out for in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden amber with a thick, off-white head that dissipates slowly. Decent lacing. Lots of tropical fruit and citrus on the nose followed by pine resin and flowery notes. Lots of pineapple, grapefruit, mango, tangerine and orange on the tongue. The pine resin and earthy hops are not as apparent, but they balance out what is almost a too sweet beer from the malt profile. Full bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is almost perfect DIPA, only the too-sweet finish keep it from the pinnacle!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark orange with minimal/visible carbonation. A small off white head sat atop but quickly dissipated. The aroma is earthiness, pine and resin with some citrus fruit undertones. The earthiness and pine/resin comes through first and the citrus fruit aftertaste lingers for a bit. It is a medium body brew with strong bitterness from the hops. Overall, it is a flavorful DIPA."
""
"O - I was quite pleased to pick this up from the Jungle Jim's growler fill service when I was in Ohio yesterday. It was something I hoped to try, and to get it fresh is a particular treat. A wonderful rendition of a popular style, Chillwave is one I'd pick up again in a heartbeat."
""
""
""
"O: A very nice DIPA and glad I tried it. Burst of hop juice and pretty complex. A comfortable and enjoyable amount of bitterness."
""
""
"Overall: Great Lakes normally kills it and this is one of their best in my opinion. Phenomenal DIPA."
""
""
"Overall: I'm glad I got a 4 pack of this before the liquor store ran out...!"
"Crystal clear copper hue with a nice sticky finger and half tall white head. Lots of papaya and mango on the nose along with other tropical fruits, smells great. Incredibly incredibly smooth. Sweet tropical fruits , a bit of pine and grassiness, some sweet caramel and and sweet breads beneath it all, well blended flavors , balanced but overall sweet with bitterness just keeping things in check with a touch of alcohol heat. Really really nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my new favorite IIPA's, it's like an Imperial Fresh Squeezed IPA from Deschutes. The Mosaic hops and sweet malt profile make this beer extremely drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer at first, but as it warmed, the DMS aromas and flavor came out more. It's not bad by any means, but without the DMS it could be great. I'm not for sure where the DMS is coming from since it was poured at a bar that regularly rotates and cleans its taps."
""
"O - Probably my favorite IPA, but I do not have much experience with Double IPAs. It is sweet and refreshing and not overly bitter, especially for an IPA. I could see enjoying this beer on a warm spring day, on a beach, or in a tropical location. Although, it is still enjoyable during in this winter that will never end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Well this is a damn good beer, I really enjoyed this on, I will probably go through a few 4 packs of this while it is around!"

"O - Really solid DIPA that is aggressively hopped and yet balanced nicely."
""
""
""
""
"VERY GOOD; TRY SOME!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I'm really impressed by this beer. After having a few of the recent popular Mosaic beers and not really liking the sort of medicinal aspect of this hop I was surprised to not get any of that in this beer, just the wide variety of fruits that I like out of Mosaic. Only got one bottle of this to test the waters and will definitely be going back for a full 4-pack."

"O-This is a really nice DIPA. It has fresh and clean flavors, and a well-balanced taste overall. It isn’t the most bitter example of the style out there, but just a really tasty and nicely made example. Really enjoyed this way to go Founders I need to find some more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this will sit in my top 10 favorite DIPAs for some time. This leans heavy on the bitter spectrum, but the tropical tart and sweet flavors shine just enough."
""
""
""
"O- Like Heady Topper and don't have access to it? This will at least scratch the itch for Heady a bit."
"Overall: a well balanced DIPA that is nicely refreshing and enjoyable. One of my favorites from GLB."
""
""
"Simply awesome beer, top 3 DIPA hands down!  If you see this beer buy it!"
""
""
"Pours a brilliant copper color with a half finger of head that dissipates quickly but leaves some lacing behind. The nose is a fine blend of hops and citrus. The malt backbone on this offering is solid – in fact, this is quite a well-balanced DIPA. The finish has bitterness along with a hint of sweet, but it’s not super-hoppy. The biggest drawback is that the alcohol gets just a bit too much at the very end."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyed more on re-review than initial thought of it being an under 4 beer (but maybe not 3.75 low).  Warmth helps a tad, but not too warm on this one."
""
""
""
""
"overall this is a great DIPA from the guys at great lakes. A very strong DIPA with moderate IBU's. I always pick up a few four packs when that season comes around. I like the taste of this better than rye of the tiger, but i like the IBU's of the tiger better than chillwave."
"Overall - A good DIPA, but not the best in my opinion. I enjoy Victory Hop Ranch more than this, but would put this ahead of Victory DirtWolf."
""
""
"Solid beer, not great enough that it would be at the top of my list for a pick when sitting down for a strong double IPA."
""
"O: It won't give you a headache."
"O. I was a little disappointed. I felt the sweetness actually lended to the lack of smoothness. This ale was overshadowed by other top shelf DIPAs that came out this season. With that said this is a good beer and worth the 10.99 per 4 pack price. I recommend this but I won't keep it around."
""
"O: I really really love the mosaic hop, aromas and flavors are amazing. This beer is amazing, really easy to drink beer. An easy decision to be a new go to beer, hope to see this around more."
""
""
""
"OVERALL: I LOVE Hopslam. This is on par with Hopslam."

"Great Lakes has a winner with Chillwave. It might not be the best that I've had, but it can run withthe big dogs. I'm saving room in the fridge for more."
"O- I love it when a beer lives up to its hype. Just about every bit as good as I expected."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability is ok. To sugary sweet for my taste in the style."
"O - This is one I have been looking to try for a while. We don't get Great Lake in Delaware, so I grabbed a 4-pack on a recent pass through New Jersey. I am glad I did. This is a fantastic double IPA with great balance. Citrus is probably the most prominent flavor, but I enjoy the caramel malts that it also offers. Reminds me most nearly to Evolution Lot6, which is among my favorite beers of all time. This is definitely one I will revisit, if given the opportunity."
""
""
""
"O: This goes down pretty easily for such a high ABV. There is no boozy taste and it would be easy to drink 2-3"
""
" The taste is great - lots of hop flavor with more of an orange type flavor with mild mango and grapefruit accents. The malt sweetness appears in the taste more toward the end of the glass but really just supports the hops which have a lot more flavor than bitterness and the alcohol is practically non-existant in the taste, there herbal and light pineapple flavors inthe peripheral make this a pretty decent Imperial Ipa to sample in multiples. Overall I would say based on having this side by side with Victory and Goose Island Imperial IPA's as well as DFH it is pretty impressive -very flavorful and not harsh in any way."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a very nice IIPA that is more sweet than hoppy, but don't take that as a negative. The juicy tropical flavors come from the Mosaic hop that is complimented by a sweet honey flavor. Easy to drink considering the ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I like this and it is good, but I wanted to like it more; I like my DIPA's more bitter, more bready, more grapefruity, and more piny. This is really cloyingly sweet and overly tropical. Other than its awesome aroma, it's a disappointment for me."

"Very tasty DIPA, just a bit too sweet"

"I was so excited when my beer guy got this in at the store. Having not tried alchemy hour I was thrilled to sample chillwave. THIS ale pours a beautiful clear copper color with a thick white head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The nose is a very fresh blend of citrus, pine, and tropical fruit. There are a lot of fresh hops here, supported by just enough malt to some what balance this beer. The mouth is medium bodied and coats the palate gloriously. As far as flavor, this one has it going on. It is a total hop bomb with tons of citrus, pine, and grass. There are significant notes of mango, pineapple, and grapefruit. This is way beyond what I expected from a nob west coast ipa. Beautifully bitter and hoppy and so fresh one can almost taste the tap. This is a brewery that I had long ago lost faith in but if they can produce s west coast style ipa like this than maybe I should rethink my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"finally, another great DIPA. actually pretty similar to hop ranch, but no weird off notes. big grain and citrus note, earthy and fresh, juicy and dank. all the typical adjectives and more. clean, fresh, tasty. not even that pricey compared to the other 4 pack dipa's."
""
""
""
"I hate to say but this is the second Dipa this year that disapointed me again last years offering was better but this is still very good I only have 1thing to say is where did all the sweet grapefruit go that this had last year for me a bit disappointing"

"o: Dangerously drinkable and almost, but not quite, top tier. Really liked this one though."
"Overall a very good offering from Great Lakes. Not in the top tier of DIPAs, but rock solid and nothing to complain about. High quality brews like this at a great value make me very glad that I have easy access to everything they make."
""
""
""
""
"O: Another winner in the overall dipa market. will drink again"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy orange amber color. Medium-sized rocky white head. Rich sweet malt aroma with a big pine hop bouquet. Huge bittersweet toasted malt flavor has a complex hop bill. I detect notes of citrus, pine, tropical fruit and chewy, resiny bitterness. The 9.4% alcohol is easily lost in this complex menagerie of malt and hop flavor. Despite the huge flavors here, there is a sense of balance that allows for a wonderful warming and spicy bitter finish. Nice clinging lace stays through to the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sad.  It's certainly not a drain pour.  It's still pretty good--say, about 3.90.  Oh, well.  Gonna have to drink all these in short order!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very worthy DIPA. I'm not familiar with Mosaic hops, but this is a bold beer, even for a DIPA. It has the bitterness DIPA drinkers look for and enough flavor to appease any beer drinker, along with some sweetness from some good tasting malt that provides a touch of balance just to say that it tried."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is the same; dark copper body, more or less clear with a nice two finger white head with good retention, not a ton of lacing. Smells like passion fruit and pineapple, very intense and pungent. Flavour is nicely balanced, with passion fruit, citrus and pineapple vying against the bread and caramel malts. Really well balanced beer that is a pleasure to drink. Mouthfeel is as good as it needs to be, with just the right bit of carbonation, actually not very bitter for a DIPA, nice and dry with a passion fruity finish. Overall, this is a really nicely done DIPA that needs to be drank fresh. I loved it and for $9.99 a 4-pack, I would buy this any time over a $8.99 bomber of Toppling Goliath Sosus, which is another Mosaic DIPA that hit Madison at the same time I picked this up. Don't get me wrong, that is clearly a superior beer, but until Toppling Goliath starts bottling 4/6 packs, I'm going to choose this one 7 times out of 10."

"O: Great Lakes has really hit a homerun with Chillwave. One of the best dipa's out there and Ohio continues to turn out excellent ipa's."
""
"I heard about Mosaic hops and then this beer was released last year, and then I heard about Mosaic hops from just about everyone a very tropical fruit softer flavored DIPA that goes down so smooth it's hard to explain to those who've never imbibed on this God send of a beer from the armpit of Ohio where some say there's nothing good except for Great Lakes. I disagree a lot more good food and music places then Pittsburgh would know what to do with but I love both cities therefore I digress. Aromatics contain tropical fruit a bit of mango/papaya/citrus notes if that, nothing is harsh just smoothie tropical fruit notes. Flavor wise it hits with some vinous herbal hop bitterness and a bit of citrus pith that lingers to create a rolling bitterness between sips. There's more bright citrus/passionfruit/mango juice on the palate with waves of bitterness grasping the taste buds between sips. Nice textures, hop oils are slick but not resinous, even carbonation medium bodied way too easy to consume in number considering the ABV weighs in at 9.4%. The expiration date on this is dead on very fresh just released in Ohio the best by date is 5/11/14. I saw an episode of No Reservations: Cleveland where Anthony Bourdain visits these chillwave riders while drinking Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold."

"Dark transparent orange color with small off-white head and nice thick rings of lacing. Aroma is strong and perfumey with dominating citrus and tropical fruits. Flavor has nice balance of bitter hops and sweet candy citrus notes, with much resin and pine. Medium mouthfeel with slight oiliness. Very good overall."
""
""
""
"Have tried it side by side with a few other highly rated DIPAs and IPAs, and this is superior. Has a complexity and drinkability that most others can't compare with."

"Used to be a fruit bomb but has gotten somewhat cloying and sweet over the years. Was once my favorite DIPA. Had this enormous tropical fruit nose and taste. Now it's a pretty solid beer with fruit notes that get pulled back by a malty sweetness."

"Downright one of my favorite beers. If you're not a fan of hops, well, you may still enjoy this year. The color is outstanding, a nice golden orange. Pour is really nice too, with limit head, and just gives off an aroma of hops as it falls in the glass. The taste, for me, is out of this world. It is very hoppy, but is smooth until the last drop, with a great citrus finish to it. Highly recommend this brew."

"Drinkability: I'd not buy this beer unless I knew that it was super fresh(when I worked there it was brewed in January/February). I wouldn't buy it more than a couple months after that. Too bad, its a nice beer from what I've tasted at the brewery but the shelf life just sucks."

"Another great beer from Great Lakes Brewing. On more seasonal IPA to look forward too. A nice clean taste and smooth. Light in color and I think better than their Commodore Perry IPA and Lake Erie Monster (and I love both of those beer a lot). Great Lakes Brewing fills a big hole that other brewers don't touch and they always do a great job."

""

"Pours a clean orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a sweet orange citrus hop. In the taste, sweet to dry orange citrus, and presence of dry alcohol in the end. A small bite and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry alcohol and orange citrus hop in the aftertaste. Quite a sleeper, small alcohol notes, but big orange citrus hops."
""
""
""
""
"Pour is darker amber with a tight billowy light tan head. Nose is very aromatic, light biscuit and dough with a huge hop punch, tons of grapefruit juice and light herbal notes. The taste is a bit more bready and doughy, hops are still huge behind, grapefruit ad strong tropical fruit flavors with a faint herbal touch and virtually no bitterness. Medium body, moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I had this when it was known as 'Alchemy Hour' and remember being underwhelmed. It must have been past fresh because this is an outstanding DIPA that's just bursting with tropical hop flavor. Highly recommend!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very good beer. Deep golden color, moderate lacing. Smell is fruity , with a hint of onion. Taste is initially pineapple, citrusy then slight oniony in aftertaste. Really enjoy this a lot when I can get a hold of it. Hides alcohol content well. Definitely a very affordable great double IPA."

"O: This is one of my staple DIPAs. What great stuff. Its balanced but it has enough hops to satisfy everyone. Its big on flavor and aroma and leaves you wanting more! /96"

"Overall, this was a very solid beer. I was quite impressed with it even with my preference for a one-sided DIPA. This would be a definite recommendation to anybody who is looking for a more inviting DIPA with less harshness, that at the same time holds true to the style."
"Ohhhh what a delicious and beautiful IPA!! Hiked our nearby Wantastiquet and enjoyed this beer out of the bottle at the top with my partner. Clean yet complex - refreshing and drinkable even at near 10%! Lots of citrus laced with dank resiny-grassiness. Really pleasant - makes me wish I lived somewhere I could get this everyday. We had the second bottle the other night with some homemade beef chili - a great beer to pair with spicy food, especially anything with Sriracha."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Alchemy Hour from Great Lakes is hands-down the best DIPA I had so far ... this is an awesome, fruit-filled DIPA that hides its 9.4% ABV ... the combination of mosaic, cascade, and nugget hops is amazingly well blended with the sweetness of the malt"
""
""
""
""
"Pours brilliant amber, slight haze and a creamy head that fell off pretty fast but left some nice lacing behind. The color is remarkable like the blush on a ripe peach. Nose is tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, apricot. The nose is like sweet perfume with floral hops and a fat malt character that yields up honey, caramel and cracker. Taste is extraordinary with plump, juicy ripe fruits and herbal hops light and earthy. It’s got a a sour zing and is resiny and dry. There’s a touch of alcohol on the palate but it’s inviting and warming. The malt is steady and sweet with some crusty bread mid palate and the hops splash up bitter with some light pine at the end for a dry finish. This is a fantastic DIPA that’s abundant with fruit, loaded with malt and exhilarating with bitter hops. Stupendous!"

"From the bottle, the ale poured a dark copper color producing a white head with a few large bubbles. The lacing on the sides of the glass was modest at best. The nose on this one is huge. One detects citrus notes of grapefruit, pineapple, and grass. In the initial taste, one detects a peppery citrus sensation immediately. Accompanying notes include sour grapefruit on the sides of the tongue, orange, grass, and a biscuity malt backbone. The peppery grassy sensation takes over in the aftertaste and warms the back of the throat. Alcohol becomes a little more prominent in the aftertaste. The one disappointment I have is that the mouthfeel runs a little too thin for a DIPA. I want this one to last a little longer. This is a good one."
"Overall (4.75/5): I thoroughly enjoyed this offering from Great Lakes. Probably my favorite from them. One of the nicest things about this beer is that it is a very different take on the big DIPA style that stands apart from the West Coast examples and East Coast stuff like DFH 90 Minute as well. It's truly it's own beer. Absolutely standout stuff."

"The mouth feel is great, leaves a nice aftertaste on the tongue, not to heavy, but just a very good drinking DIPA."
""
""
""
"M: Light and effervescent at first, turning sticky and drying."
""
"Overall- one of Great Lakes' best offerings in my opinion. Bummer that it is a limited seasonal. They should keep this on a bit longer into the summer months. And if Widmer actually sued over the name, it will be a bummer that this will be gone- hopefully the recipe stays and the only the name changes. Can't wait until the next release of this one"
""
"It's hard to say whether this beer is semi-sweet or semi-dry in the feel, but I like the median it finds. It all sits on a solid medium body that's got a nice, crisp bite as well as a certain creaminess."
""
""
"O: An incredibly balanced beer, Big, juicy hops in the nose and taste supported by a creamy malt character and balanced out by the perfect amount of bittering hops. The finish is long, complex and ultimately clean."
""
""
"D: This was a very nice double IPA. It had a great scent and taste, but the body was weak. The alcohol was really well hidden, and the finish was smooth, so it was easy to drink. Maybe not in the top tier, but I will really enjoy this six pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I think this is a bit too sweet for what I am looking for in a DIPA. It has a good burst of hoppiness, but the honey malt is simply too strong for it to be among my top tier of the category. Still, it is strong offering from a quality brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall/Comments: An excellent offering by GLBC. The flavor profile on this beer is extraordinary and the aroma compliments if very well making it dangerously drinkable!. Consumed 3/19/13. Classified as an American Double/Imperial IPA at 9.4% ABV."

"This brew pours right in line with the style with an amber hued body. Head is just about an inch with an average pour. The nose is bright and lush and full of bursting aroma. Citrus rind juicy fruit and resin come through nicely. The smell is sharp and prickly goodness. The juicy feel of this beer continues through to the taste. It is absolutely gushing with mango, grapefruit, and lush citrus. The bitter tones play nicely but mostly as a balancing act to the wonderful flavor scheme. This drinks like the perfect summer IPA. I really wish I would have bought a lot more of this gem as this one sold out fast and has really flown under the radar. Mouthfeel is crisp, dry and just rite. A truely wonderful IPA that I will seek out again."

"O-one of my favorite beers of lately. incredibly drinkable and very cheap, I love that this is on tap everywhere. super drinkable but the alcohol does hit you eventually."
""
""
""
""
"I was really happy my neighbor found this brew...always like trying the new beers of GL. This beer pours a hazy brilliant orange with slight copper hue. The 1/2 finger thick slightly offwhite head was nice and frothy. The smell reminded me of Ports Wipe Out IPA. There is more floral notes than pine or citrus...Iwould have guessed columbus hops, but bottle says Mosaic. The taste is a very well balanced brew between floral, malt and ABV. The beer is a touch on the sweeter side, which must be from the honey malt used. The mouthfeel is full in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a very good beer, but at 9.4% ABV...it would be tough to session."

"O - Good and fruity IIPA from Great Lakes that is gushing with citrus and mango flavors. Love the addition to the lineup."

""
"O - Balanced and not overly hoppy. Sweet bready and orange."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"All in all, it's smooth, hoppy, and drinkable, despite the high ABV. A real hophead's treat, one that doesn't tear anything loose from your critical components, merely releases pleasurable flavors. And isn't that what we're looking for? I could drink one, and drink one, and drink one, and never tire of it, until that decision is made for me. Tonight, though, one is plenty, and off to sleep...."

"O: Holy crap this is a great beer. This may rival Hopslam for the DIPA crown! An excellent combination of hops and malt, so much more than """hoppy""" like the average DIPA. I just looked at the GLBC website and it appears this beer will be back next year."

"O: Quite liked this beer, a nice, assertive DIPA from Great Lakes."
"Bottle: Poured a deep amber/orangey color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of fruity hoppy notes with light citrus notes as well with some residual sugar. Taste is also dominated by fruity ester with fruity hops notes and some citrus undertones with some light residual sugar notes. Malt backbone is solid and provides a nice smooth aftertaste. Body is quite full with good carbonation, Solid rendition of the style with good effort to limit the amount of bitterness in the aftertaste."

"Another outstanding offering from Great Lakes"
"Appearance is somewhat hazy and dark for style with a velvety head and lots of lacing. Nose is somewhat nondescript with mellow fruity hop character with notes of tropical fruit, pineapple, and peach. Taste pops much more than the nose lets on. Juicy hops dominate the palate with mellow bitterness and decent balance, mild malt presence. Carbonation is high with medium body. Overall, very taty dipa. Only complain is that it is lacking in aromatics."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall an exceptional beer. Great job, Great Lakes. Love the label and theme, too. Surfing in the Midwest--right on."
"Nice copper colored ale with a light creamy sheet. Smells like BO, apricot, peaches, resin, some pine and sweet malts. Nice nose. Flavor is malt, some cracker, some tea and peach. Overall the taste is more malty than I enjoy in a DIPA, but has a herbal character that seems appealing. medium on full bodied with moderate carb and a wet finish. Overall the beer isn't bad, but nothing special. In fact, I'd recommend this for somebody that really loves DFH beers, seems to fall in line with their style."
""
""
"O-To be honest I was hoping for more than this. Solid but flavors are bit muddled...a bit too much sharp alcohol notes....citrus not as bright as expected...Not in the Abrasive/Surly Sucks/Hop Slam tier in my opinion but solid enough. I bought 12 of them without trying it first so I will certainly still be enjoying this in the future."
"8.2/10"
""
"As usual, Great Lakes Brewing impresses. Alchemy Hour DIPA is probably their second best beer or so (after Edmund Fitzgerald), though it's hard to really pick a favorite. This is an easy drinking beer, even with that slight alcohol burn on the finish. A very, very good representation of the style."
""
""
""
"Overall - Good hop flavor and it isn't overbearing with the sugars. Just a bit too sweet and too hot."
""
""
"Overall: This beer is so very underrated. Many people seem to view Great Lakes as a fairly safe, somewhat boring brewery (a view I most definitely do not share), but this proves that they can hang in the recently IPA-crazed beer landscape. If this beer had come from Three Floyds, Russian River, Cigar City, or any other “elite” brewery, people would be raving about it left and right and lining up to get a case. Great Lakes has quietly made one of the best IIPAs around. I wish this had a permanent spot in their roster, because it would secure a permanent place in my constantly rotating refrigerator. 19/20"
""
"Overall: Very nice double IPA here from Great Lakes. I enjoy the Lake Erie Monster, but I think I like this one even more, as it has a sweeter and fruitier taste than the Monster. Really good stuff!"

"Great Lakes Alchemy Hour Double IPA ---4.5/5"
""

"O- Very nice beer, well balanced and minimal bitterness from the hops. Alcohol peaks out a bit at the finish but at 9.4% ABV that is to be expected. I would recommend any fan of IPA's check this one out."
"a nod to the hectic freshwater surfers of the great lakes, this imperial ipa would warm any winter warrior after just a bottle. thanks to thebrewo again for hooking this up in a wonderful trade. the pour is a honey color with an amber hue, thick looking, and very clear, with less than an inch of off white fizz that settles to a thin film relatively quickly. the nose is oily resinous hops of course, and sweeter residual sugar notes, caramel malt, and plenty of sturdy alcohol. the booze is really quite intense. the flavor starts out with a lush fresh cut cactus sort of vegetative and refreshingly cooling hop profile, very unique before the fruity esters creep in. more malt body than expected, also on the sweeter side, sort of stopping the refreshment in its tracks. bitterness is not huge in this beer until well after the swallow, where it sort of crawls out of the throat and back onto the tongue, drying me out a little. cool complexion of flavors here, but the booze stands out too much. its just too strong, even for the style. it makes it more like a beer with a shot of middle of the line vodka dumped in, not quite offensive, but bordering on it in my opinion. I think it detracts rather than adds. mouthfeel is fine, and the lively carbonation cuts through some of its massive almost gelatinous body. I would rate this higher, but the alcohol intensity is a drawback for me, it takes away from an otherwise extremely impressive offering from great lakes."

"O- This beer has a nice full hops flavor with a good citrus profile and some nice depth to it. The aftertaste has a really nice pungency without much bitterness making easy to drink but warming aswell."

"O - This hop bomb is something all hop heads should seek out. A new east coast Double IPA monster! Smell on this beer is second to none for a Double IPA.

"D – Well it’s one of the more ‘conservative’ takes on the Mosaic hop (along with New Belgium’s Rampant), it’s still quite enjoyable and one of the best hoppy beers I’ve had from Great Lakes (along with Rye of the Tiger). Glad that this comes in 12oz bottles, as it packs a punch."

"O - Good to see an DIPA of this style coming out of GLBC. They will always have some of our favorites, but its good to see some a little more unique coming from This great brewery. It's not a wreck your palate like its Lake Erie Monster relative as its just a brilliantly crafted Double IPA letting you look forward to warmer weather. I'd like to see this stick around in the GLBC bottle release calander. It's definitely something anyone could enjoy and if you like fruit flavors then you can't pass it up. 2 thumbs up to Great Lakes for releasing an ale of this style. This is somewhat uncharted territory for GLbC and they knocked it out of the park considering this being their first release in bottles of this kind of ipa(to my knowledge anyway)."
"O - I really enjoy this beer. It has what I would describe as a toasted dank hop aroma/flavor that I'm getting in more and more new beers lately, so I suspect Mosaic might be the common denominator. For 9.4% ABV and 80 IBUs, a very well balanced Imperial IPA."
""
""
"Overall: If you look at my profile, and my previous reviews, you will see I love big stouts, barleywines, and the like. I like sweeter beers with high ABV. I've had Heady, Pliny, Sucks, Hopslam, and I've always maintained my preference for maltier, less hoppy beers. Maybe that's why I like this so much. This is the best IPA I've ever had. I will buy much more of this and drink it all summer."

""
""
"O - Overall, It's a good IPA, but nothing astounding. I didn't like it as much as I hoped I would."
""
"Hazy amber orange with a skein of off white foam and curtains of lace. Powerful pineapple, mango, star fruit and alcohol are noticeable in the nose. Taste does not disappoint. Bouquets of mango, papaya, orange peel, pineapple, substantial malt presence tames, overall bitterness is moderate. Lightly sweet and juicy, chewy well crafted body, perfectly carbonated. Dry medium bitter finish with lingering tropical elements. Very good."
""
"A really good IPA, this super fresh is probably really amazing, very good now however. I'll buy this again"

"M: Big medium. Good texture"
""
""
""
"O: Drink this beer fresh. I boosted the overall score to help it out, because I know I enjoyed the first bottle of the four pack a lot more than this last one."
"D/O Drinkability is not that high with the high ABV and the """bigness""" of the beer. Overall this is a very fine beer. 4.5"
"D/O: Recognizable as the older sibling to Great Lakes' Commodore Perry IPA, this beer achieves balance while striking a fairly traditional posture. It lacks the obvious mark of fine craftsmanship that the standard IPA exudes, with a smattering of questionable sensory qualities but still outnumbered by appropriate features."
"Overall – Wow, not what I was expecting at all. It tastes like some kind of Oktoberfest version of a DIPA. It's also missing way too much carbonation. Not my type of DIPA."
""
""
""
"O: I think I'd like this better with a little less alcohol. One of the few DIPAs that I liked less as it warmed. The booze hits hard and fast, obscuring pretty much everything else this beer has to offer. I won't hesitate the finish the 4 I bought and I'll enjoy them when I know I won't need to drive, but it's not like I'm going to mark my calendar so I don't miss this one next spring. All in all, I like their Commodore Perry better. By no means a bad beer, but there are DIPA's a prefer to spend my money on."
""
""

"O- The idea of a DIPA/American Amber Ale hybrid came to mind on this one. It works and I like it."

"O-this is a nice double IPA. Great flavors, good blend of hops and bitterness. It has an outstanding drinkability and the flavors last log too. Every sip is enjoyable."
"OK....like ya'll, I'm not a 'beeradvocate' snob just yet... This beer is fricken good, hold me back, whoa, i'm gonna rate it a 6... Oops, clicked the 'review', not quite 250 characters yet...c'mon, hesitations (....) don't count?... I like the beer! alright? Sit it next to the double wide and I like the Alchemy better, sit it next to the abrasive and I like the Alchemy better, I drink it and I like it better than a lot of different IPA's..."
"The best hoppy offering from Great Lakes. The new name, Chillwave, is pretty dumb compared to Alchemy Hour, but don't let that dissuade you here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This was an excellent beer. Would love to try this more fresh but this was great nonetheless. The mosaic hops add a great flavour profile to this."
""
"P poured one and a half bottles into an imperial nonic with a godd rich amber tinged deep golden,a one finger bone white head atop.Aromas of grapefruit rind,sweet alcohol,and a bit more grassy hoppiness.Sharp and in your face grapefruit flavors along with some grassy/herbal hops over top of sweet sugary alcohol,it's sweet but the hops win out here.Alot if not most of the beer of this style are too sugary sweet,this is pretty sweet but it has intense hops to combat that sweetness,a great beer from what I consider a top 3 in the midwest brewery."
""
"Overall, this is a solid double IPA from Great Lakes, a brewery that consistently churns out highly drinkable beers. I initially loved this one but as the beer warmed it lost a lot of it's best characteristics. The aroma is fantastic for the first 5 minutes or so and the taste is nicely complex and fairly balanced for a beer that is over 9%. If this one wouldn't have petered out so quickly in the aroma and taste department I'd be giving it a higher rating. As it stands it's still a pretty darn good beer and if you haven't tried it, I definitely recommend it."
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite DIPA I've had so far. Well balanced, medium mouthfeel, I love my ABV's and they're well hidden. Beautiful clear amber color, Mosaic & honey well present, and that's my personal preference as they complement each other very well. Knocked Hopslam off #1 for me. Just sayin."
"O- Definitelt west-coast style with the bright citrus hoppy notes, well balanced and easy drinking. Solid DIPA."
""
""
""
"O - Step down hopslam, you've been replaced. The mosaic hops in this beer pop, and its incredible, but it has a malt foundation that isnt found in some other comparable double IPA's, the 9.4 is hidden rather well too. The first time I had this, I couldnt believe what I was tasting, and each time back to it has just been a treat. Great Lakes came close with Lake Erie Monster but it fell a tad short. And this picks up where LEM left off. Great Lakes is a fantastic brewery, excellent representation of their skills."
""

""
""
""

"Overall: Fantastic imperial IPA that is not just for hopheads. I am fairly new to IPAs but this is definitely one I would seek out again."
""
"There’s no doubt in my mind that Alchemy Hour is the DIPA that we’ve been waiting for Great Lakes to brew. It’s been a long time coming. Put simply – this is a fantastic, west coast style DIPA! If you haven’t tried it yet, grab a 4-pack or two while you can. Great Lakes, please make this an annual or semi-regular release! Excellent stuff!"
""
""
"[O] Nice beer and a nice departure from the standard double IPA these days. Overall though, I'm not a huge fan. But I like what the Mosaic hops bring to the party...I'd just like to see them layered with a little more juicy, tropical fruit flavor. And maybe bittered to a lesser degree."
"ABV is completely masked with giant drinkabilty, easily one of the best DIPAs I've come across since Myrcenary. Another great brew from Great Lakes"
""
""
""

"O-Really good DIPA that strikes a unique balance of citrus tang, sweet malt and bitter hops. Worth a try, but if you're looking for really dank hoppy bitterness go elsewhere."

"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body with a medium to medium-low level of carbonation. This results in a beer that is never fizzy on the palate, but lightly and gently foams as it moves across. Closes with a flash of ethanol heat in the nostrils and on the back of the throat, leading to a dry finish with plenty of lingering stickiness hanging on the palate."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer and a good example of a DIPA, it was very true to style while having a nice tropical fruit element that really shined through in the aroma. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, the alcohol showed up only a little, it wasn't overly bitter, and the flavors did a good job at holding my attention. I might be up for drinking two of these but I think that I would be my limit. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma, it was very good and I couldn't get enough of great tropical fruit aromas it had. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, but if the flavor was a little more tropical and intense like the aroma was this would be one awesome beer. I would buy this beer again when looking for a good DIPA, I might even get a four pack of it, I would recommend this to anyone who loves DIPA's especially the ones that are heavy on the citrus and tropical fruits. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer and I thought every aspect of it was good, but I don't think it's a top tier DIPA, it's just a little short of being up their with some of the best of the style. Good job Great lakes, I always expect solid beers from you guys and this one turned out to be pretty good and I enjoyed it. I would take this over Lake Erie Monster any day, I hope they brew this again."

"O. Sans Eddie Fitz and Nosferatu, this is about the only other Great Lakes beer to impress me. Still, there is something about the overall flavor and aftertaste that gets a bit tiring and is keeping me from buying multiple 4-packs."
"Overall impression: The alcohol is a bit much for me to call """world class""" as others have done. However, the hop aroma and flavor are so unique and distinct that I find this really enjoyable. I prefer my DIPA's and IPA's dry and drinkable and this is getting into American Barleywine territory for me. Regardless, it's well crafted and a unique one to savor. Well done GLBC!"

"Good job of the West coast style. Mosaic and nugget hops meld well with the honey malt. Simply put, this is a great beer."

"12 oz bottle in a glass. Definitely a beer for hop heads. Color is about 10 SRM, nicely laced. Taste is full bodied, rich, with floral hops throughout. Not really any soapy or overly bitter hop tastes, just pleasant with a malty backbone. Does not taste like a 9.4% beer - be careful."

"O: 4.5 - I watched the review of this beer on BeerGeekNation and, after Chris' stellar review, felt like I needed to try it; like I said, this is exactly what I expect and want from a Midwestern DIPA with a nice balance of sweetness and hop flavor; however, I prefer the huge hop (dank, piney, resiny) aroma of typical PW DIPAs like Maharaja or Pliny the Elder to this this, but it's certainly well-crafted and balanced; suffice it to say though, it blows the 2013 Hopslam out of the water"
""
"A nice sharp citrus bite - bitter orange and grapefruit giving way to sweet ruby red grapefruit and mango notes. A slick somewhat substantial malt backbone is there to hang the other flavors on. A very good DIPA. Definitely a tasty brew."
"O: Pretty good drinkability for the ABV. The tropical/sweeter style of this Double IPA is right in my wheelhouse. A bit like Abrasive, but not as much intense, in your face hops and maybe a bit sweeter. Overall, one of my new favorite double IPAs."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have just been all about the Great Lakes recently and for good reason. They make a lot of killer beers and at a competitive price. This one does not disappoint. wonderfully complex and tasty. Not overly bitter and good balance. Almost a perfect DIPA for me. Can't wait to try another Great Lakes brew"

"D: I like this one a lot. It's big, with a unique hop profile and a balanced malt bill. To borrow from Theodore Roosevelt, it speaks softly and carries a big stick. Great Lakes beers generally show more polish than innovation for innovation's sake, but this manages to do both."

"O - This stuff is great. Couldn't get it in my area, but luckily I commute over an hour and it was just sitting around by the case. Got 2 4 packs, and I'll probably get more soon before it's gone. I'd definitely give this a go no matter who you are. It's low on bitterness for those of you who aren't hopheads, and for people like me it provides that awesome fruity hop flavor with low bitterness and without getting syrupy. It's dangerously drinkable and I don't think you can really go wrong with it. Highly recommended."
""
""
"OV: not a bitter/biting hopbomb as most DIPAs, but more like a well balanced and rounded blend of malts and hops that make for a damn fine tasty brew. Glad I have 3 more to enjoy and savour. Also, the alcohol is well hidden, perhaps too well."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark, clear copper amber with a cream, off white dense head with excellent retention and streaks of lace. Nose is filled with resiny and leafy NZ hops, green and raw with little malt detected. Flavor unfortunately takes a dive with a strong sweet bready malt base, citrus juice and a tame hop profile with minimal bitterness in the finish. Resiny and chewy medium thick body, well carbonated, but just... ick. The sweet malty and green tasting body without much bitterness is a turn off."
"I've always been impressed with GL and this beer doesn't fall short."
""
""
"Pours an orange-yellow color, with a finger width of white foam. The smell is, as stated above, fruity, piney goodness. The taste falls in line with a bit of a burn at the end. The 9.4% is well-hidden until then. Got a 4-pack for about $11. Worth every penny and I will buy another 4-pack when I drink the last one later on this afternoon. Enjoy!"
"Overall: I've loved most of the products I've had from Great Lakes Brewery, but this one is not a favorite. Neither Commodore Perry or this were anything to get too excited about. There are a ton of DIPA's out there these days and I would recommend a few others."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A nice DIPA from Great Lakes, it's quite sweet at times for me but the fruit flavors are very well done and enjoyable. I definitely prefer Lake Erie Monster to this beer but I wouldn't complain if I had to have another."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the fresh and fruity aroma. The hops are extraordinarily fragrant throughout the entire tasting, striking the perfect blend of tart, tangy, sweet, fruity, and zing. The flavor follows nicely, but with much more bitterness from earth and herb than from the fruity sweetness and citrus in the nose. This is not a negative, but just a bit of a surprise, as we were expecting a much sweeter, more malt-balanced beer. The flavors actually tended to muddle a bit with warmth, so enjoy this experience closer to fridge temperature than cellar temperature. All in all this is a great beer, but it is the aromatics that really stand out for us."
""
""
"Overall, an excellent IIPA that in my opinion is on par with Hopslam with being one of the best options on the market. You really need to let this beer warm up a little to get the full experience but an amazing offering from Great Lakes."
""
"O-Very well balanced DIPA, not cloying or overly sweet"
""
""
"This one pours a clear, deep, orange-amber with a clean, white head that settles slowly. Some evident booziness comes out in the aroma, alongside strong notes of grapefruit, pine, and some faint, crackery malt. Lots of hop-bitterness are delivered by a medium-full body that washes over the palate. Grapefruit rind and pine seem to overpower any evident malt. Though a good example of the style; given a choice, I'd take a Lake Erie Monster over Alchemy Hour."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours clear dark copper with a small, frothy off-white head, short retention with light lacing. Aroma is peach, pear, and apricot esters with straw and cereal malt, resin and pine hops. Flavor is heavy hops and bitterness with light supporting malt, fruity esters and a dry finish. Full body and medium carbonation."
"Citrusy grapefruit and tangerine peel flavors, moderate yet balanced hop bitterness, smooth with a supporting pale malt backbone, dry bitter citrus aftertaste. Sweetness builds but gets balanced by the bitterness soon after. Overall it's pretty drinkable, though I haven't had more than one in a sitting."
""
""
"O: A good change of pace from the hop-head crazy DIPAs. While I do love a ton of bitterness and hops, this is a beer I could have a few of without a ton of palate fatigue. Nicely balanced, easily drinkable, worth picking up a few if you get the chance."
""
""
"O - I'm not a hop-head, preferring malt-forward styles such as Scotch ales and Marzens. This beer, however, might be the one to pull me over to the dark side. It's absolutely delicious. While it features the hops, it's extremely well-balanced rather than being a hop bombing raid, so the malts, which are excellent partners, are clearly present, too. I almost got in the car and made the round-trip to get a full growler after my 'sneak-preview' tasting when I got home. I had tasted this at Peaches St. Paddy's Day weekend and liked it, but had forgotten how good it is. I want more. If you get the chance, be sure to have a generous taste - it's an absolutely delicious hop nectar. Another fine demonstration that the folks at Great Lakes really know what they're doing."
"O-has some good flavors, but just too much sweetness for my liking in a DIPA"

"The taste is beautiful, which really is what matters. Grapefruit and honey hit the front of the tongue and pine, earth, and musk follow. Sweet at times, bitter to end, this is a smooth easy drinking beer. At 9 percent there's no hint of alcohol in taste or feel making this a dangerous brew to boot."
""
""
""
"Overall a solid, very nice offering from Great Lakes. I may have been expecting a bit more, but the beer was fantastic regardless of my prior expectations."
"Medium bodied with prominent earthy bitterness up front that lingers over the sweeter notes and malt backbone into a dry finish. Dry and resinous with grassy pine needle and spruce tip flavors countered by subtle citrus and sweet malt backbone. The citrus/tropical fruit character from the nose is missing here but there is some caramel sweetness as well as some toffee, hazelnut and biscuit. The high ABV is well masked making this beer easy to drink, but the malt flavors are a bit too prominent for me. Some nice hop flavor up front but it falls off mid-palate with too much malt sweetness for the style."
""
""
""
"Pours a very nice copper orange color. Aroma is awesome, i get tangerines, wildflower honey, pine, some mango and green onion...very hopslam like to me. The taste is where this outshines hopslam for me. Really nice citrus up front, with a nicely balance malt sweetness. Some honey and tropical fruits. The alcohol is very well hidden. Mouth feel is nice, a little thinner then I expected, but is very smooth. Overall a great DIPA, one of the better ones I have had."
""
"What a great double IPA! Orange in color, beautiful citrus nose, great hop bite. Alcohol very nicely disguised. I would highly recommend this DIPA to true hop heads; it hits the perfect balance of bitter hops and citrus nose. One of the best DIPAs I've had in a while."

""
"*Overall a great DIPA that you should try if you enjoy this style. I am a """malt-head", but with the right food pairing this is a very enjoyable brew."
""
""
"I've gotten somewhat used to great IPAs that were able to avoid such a harsh bite and was liking them a good bit. I have to say I like this and like the bite though I think I've come to like the almost creamy body that some of the double ipas have gone to."
""
"This poured out as a clear orange color with a white soapy head on top. The retention is thin with a scattered lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is hoppy with a big malt balance to it. The taste of the beer is hoppy with a boozy malt flavor, slightly fruity and floral tasting. The mouthfeel has a medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Overall it's a pretty good IPA, it's worth trying."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: Overall a finely crafted DIPA - a good version of the style. Drinkability is quite good as well. Many DIPAs I usually need to stop at one due to the high ABV or the fact that the hops thrashed my palate and I need to stop, this one though, I want another, but I have to work tonight so I'll stop at one. My palate is not worn out by this beer either. The beer went well with food (burger and baked beans) and I'm glad I got a 4 pack. Time to save the rest over a few upcoming evenings. Quite a good DIPA."

"Overall an awesome beer that I'm happy to have found. Given recent revisits to some other DIPAs that I thought were amazing at the time, Alchemy Hour does very well in comparison."
"a hopslam imitator/competitor? naw, just a solid ~10% IPA, give it a try."
"O - Not the hop-bomb like Lake Erie Monster is (not that it's a bad thing....) very well-balanced, clean taste, very drinkable."
"overall, I like this beer a lot and would buy more. Their price point is very good, especially compared to other beers in DC that are available."
"Beer pours clear amber with about 2 fingers of khaki head that dies fast. Rests with a fine lacing surfacing the entire beer. Beer smells sweet, and fresh. I pick up floral hops and clovers. A little bit of a bright berry flavor hides in the background. The beer has a pretty special flavor. Sweet, a little grainy, and a burst of very crisp hops. I get the clover flavor again which is more pronounced in the taste. The aftertaste is wonderful. A very bitter and peppery flavor lingers on my palate. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a higher than average carbonation. The beer is not too creamy--instead has a crisper character. Highly enjoyable and drinkable."
""
"Overall, I like this one. I'm not CRAZY about the hop profile (heavy pine, and a somewhat-persistent bitterness), but it's easily in the better half in regards to IIPA's. Great mouthfeel and a lovely look. If you see it, definitely grab it!"
""
""
"Overall curious as to why this got such a high rating, I do have strong reason to believe my bottle was well over a month old since the best by date is etched as """4/30/12""" but it really shouldn't change my experience this much as other clam this to be a hop bomb with strong resinous tones. Gonna try a ST Unearthly and see if it's my palate..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good DIPA for when you're in the mood for something resinous and bitter."
""
"Finally, Great Lakes takes a shake at a decent DIPA; too bad it's upper mid-tier at best."
""
""
"Unique hop profile here, very solid DIPA. Probably along the lines of the new wave of DIPA's with these new hop varieties. This one is an absolute winner!"
""
""
"Overall: In all honesty I have not been overly pleased with some of Great Lakes offerings but this one meets expectations. I heard so much positive about this that I had to give it a go and I can say I'm glad I did. Have I had better? Yes but in the same breath this is a pleasant surprise."
""
"OVERALL: A serviceable double IpA from Great Lakes. Lots of flavor and packs a punch. Good stuff."
"Another one of the better DIPAs that are hitting the market now. Not too bitter but good hop flavor."
"Poured a slightly hazy medium amber color, with a thin cap of white bubbles for a head, a few strands of lacing on the glass. Aroma was decent, citrus, pine, but there was an underlying soapiness in there that was quite unpleasant, and that I hoped was not going to translate into the taste. Well...it did. Pine/herbal hop notes, orange oil, with a major soapy element going on, and a rather sweet malt base; higher alcohol is not hidden. This really did nothing for me. Too sweet, too soapy. Slick mouthfeel, medium body, unpleasant aftertaste. Not at all exemplary of the style. Will not be revisiting this one."
""
""
"Taste-Honeyed, toasted malt, brown- sugared tangerine, with juicy, tropical hops providing a snaking, underlying bitterness that weaves nicely between all the flavors. Very smooth for the high ABV. A hophead's tasty treat. Excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a darker orange color with a minimal head that dissipates right away and leaves a thin ring of lacing. Smells of tons of peaches, light juicy orange, mango, maybe some papaya or guava, stonefruit, along with some carmel from the malt, and light honey. Somewhat dry aroma. Taste starts with lots of sweet, juicy fruits. Peach, mango, papaya, and some grapefruit. Sweetness from the honey shows through already. The middle brings more honey sweetness as well as some carmel malts that really balance the fruity hops. Starting to get the resinous bitterness from the nugget hops. The finish a wonderful combination of fruity hops, sweetness, and slight bitterness. Lots of juicy peach, mango, some tangerine, papaya, stonefruit, little grapefruit peel, honey, and carmel. Slightly dry and bitter, but the sweetness cuts the dryness and bitterness wonderfully. Full body with a creamy and oily mouthfeel. The mosaic hop never disappoints, and the nugget hops provide a nice resinous bitterness to contrast the fruity qualities of the mosaic hops. Hoppy, yet very balanced and the flavors the hops bring are pretty complex. One of the best showcases of mosaic hops I've had. Excellent double ipa."

""
""
"This one is a nice sipper. On the lighter side for DIPA's, which a lot seem to be heavy. I also like the nod to Great Lakes surfers. Surfing one of the Great Lakes is on my bucket list now."
"While I absolutely love the Great Lakes Brewing Company, I wouldn't say they're exactly known for their IPA's (the Lake Erie Monster being the exception, of course). Regardless, in a region where every brewer and their mother has 5+ IPA's to their name, this one manages to stand out. While I've had better IPA's, I have an incredibly difficult time finding anything wrong with this brew. From its golden-brown color to its semi-sweet ,"flowery""" aroma, this is everything an IPA should be."

"O. I have to say I am surprised. Lake Erie Monster (Great Lakes' other DIPA) has never been very enjoyable for me, so when Great Lakes said they were chasing a West Coast styled DIPA, I didn't have the highest hopes. It's not their fault, they just seem to specialize in balanced, middle of the road, high quality lagers and ales. Well color me impressed. Alchemy Hour DIPA is easily one of the best beers I have had in recent memory, and is a top notch DIPA in every regard. This reminds me a great deal of Hopslam in its balance and sweetness. A spectacular, must-try achievement from a brewery that doesn't miss often. I love you Great Lakes!"
"Overall: This is an extremely good DIPA that I think is much better than the more boozy tasting and borderline cloying Lake Erie Monster. Actually, this is about the closest beer to Hopslam that I have had, albeit with different hops. Fantastic job, Great Lakes!"
""

"Overall – For a 9% abv brew the alcohol was very well concealed by the sweeter and hoppier flavors of the brew. While the alcohol was well hidden, it was still a nice slow drinking brew due to its resinous aftertaste and creamier body. It was a nice drinking double and one I would recommend for a try."
""
"Hazy burnt orange with a tight, frothy head. Super juicy, pulpy citrus aroma - resin, some sharp earthy notes, and moderate alcohol. The flavor is quite hoppy: all tropical and citrus fruit. There is quite a bit of sweetness under all those juicy hops. Rindy, resinous, and floral, but it's mostly all about the fruit...the aftertaste is like ripe mango. Slick, oily, medium-full body with perhaps a bit too much heat. Pretty tasty, but I wouldn't drink more than one in a sitting."
""
""
""
"The beer is orange with a half inch of off white head. The aroma brings citrus, pepper, bready malts, alcohol heat. Interesting flavor. Malt and pepper balanced with hops. Isopropyl alcohol in both the scent and flavor. A bit odd. While this beer presents some nice flavors, it's a bit off overall."
""
"I was not a huge fan of this beer when I first drank it. After drinking a few, I realized that it is a good representative of the style. While I do prefer beer to push the envelope a little more, I have to give kudos to Great Lakes for a solid beer."
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty good DIPA. The alcohol is prevalent but it's not overpowering. It is a bit heavy at times. The malts tend to out shine the hops at first, but the bold hop character takes over as the beer warms. It has a nice, intensely bitter finish. For such a big beer it has good drinkability which is helped by it's balance. In the end, this is good beer that I would definitely have again."
""
"O- The best IPA I've had from Great Lakes, one of my favorites from them overall, this is a really delicious beer that takes a great take on the West-Coast hop profile. I'll definitely be having this again next time it's available."
""
"This is far from sessionable but it's satisfying my hop fix for sure."
"Overall: A very nice beer making great use of a new school hop. A seasonal staple in the fridge for any hophead. Really looking forward to the Rye of the Tiger release."
"Overall - An excellent Double IPA that has a big fruity hop profile that is not that common in the usual DIPA suspects. It doesn’t seem to have the big IBUs that some hop heads seem to gravitate towards, but this brew has a decent balance that could make it a little more accessible to be a crowd pleaser. The only down fall to this one that I found was the coating of the mouth by the thick heavy malt body, but to me, that is a minor problem and I could enjoy this brew on a regular basis, if only Great Lakes decides to make it year-round! Right now it is only considered a Spring Seasonal beer and may already be gone from the shelves."
"Thanks to a VERY generous BA for this as an extra. Best before: 05/07/13. Pours an almost-clear amber color with a large white head that takes some time to go down. Scent is very tropical with tropical fruit notes and a bit of honey. There is some piney-ness, but not as much as what we're used to here on the west coast. However, I love the way the hops outnumber the small malt profile on this one. Bravo, Great Lakes. Come to think of it, this may be my first Great Lakes beer I've ever tasted. More tropical fruit aroma with a bit of grass and citrus. Taste is just as the nose leads you to. Awesome tropical fruit flavors (pineapple, mango, papaya, guava)...also with a hint of kiwi. The malt backbone definitely comes through in the taste, which was what I was hoping WOULDN'T happen, however... it works with this beer. Lost a couple points...but not too much. Tropical hops with a hint of citrus and some honey and caramel malt flavors. The sweetness of this beer mellows out the bitterness that should be here. A little or bitter with a little less sweet would do this one good. Mouthfeel is PERFECT for a DIPA. Pretty much spot-on. Not too thin, not too sticky, not under-carbed. Drinkability is scary high for the ABV on this one. No alcohol warmth detected. Overall, this beer is a pretty solid DIPA. The nose is great, but the taste is still a bit too malty. I know us west-coastians think differently when it comes to our IPA/DIPAs. Very tasty beer that I would definitely purchase on the regular if it were distributed to California."

"Complex and nicely balanced. The 9.4% abv isn't noticeable. Pretty much everything you'd want in a DIPA, but there is this milky flavor that sets it apart."

"O: wonderful DIPA from Great Lakes. Doesn't disappoint. Be careful because drinks much easier than 9%. Recommended"

The smell of this beer hit on a lot of the characteristics that I find pleasing in a DIPA. I enjoyed this one somewhat slowly and was glad that I did - I might have to grab another one of these before I leave the Cleveland area."
"O-Not a bad beer at all. Very interesting. Very bitter and dry, but sweet. Fairly smooth, acts as more of a sipper DIPA. Pretty balanced with the sweet, but has a nice malty finish. I actually enjoy this beer more as it warms."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 5/1/2013. Pours lightly hazy orange amber color with a small fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge mango, grapefruit, orange zest, orange rind, tangerine, pineapple, floral, caramel, honey, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great balance and complexity of hop and malt notes. Taste of big pineapple, mango, tangerine, orange zest, orange rind, floral, caramel, honey, light pine, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, tropical fruit, floral, caramel, honey, light pine, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of hop and malt flavors; with a near perfect bitterness/sweetness balance; and absolutely zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy, lightly slick, and sticky mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Dangerously easy to drink. Overall this is an outstanding double IPA! Great malt and hop complexity and balance; and extremely smooth to drink. An incredibly enjoyable offering."
"I get almost nothing off the nose of this one. Flavor is even. Earthy tones are definitely there with a fair portion of pine. Boozy aftertaste. This is a good iipa. Seems others think much more highly of it than I, although I do think it's good. The burn from booze and one dimensional (somewhat) character keep it from a higher rating."

"Overall (4.0): This has a really nice smell and an interesting flavor profile, which I like quite a bit, but it also doesn’t quite have the kind of aggressive hops character I was hoping for—not like Lake Erie Monster does, which I love. Still, this is very good, just like a honey-smooth ale loaded with late-boil hops. Glad to have tried, but for my money, give me more Erie Monster."
"O- Great Lakes killed it on this beer. This is my new favorite brew by them. It is superbly balanced and very delicious. It was quite different on tap but very good never the less. Definetly, check this one out if you can get it."

"An outstanding effort. Perhaps, more enjoyable than Lake Erie Monster; although, a different beast altogether. Leaning more toward the left coast, but not sacrificing Midwestern uniqueness in balance and malty enterprise. Not pithy and super-bitter, yet not terrifyingly smooth, neither. Just one of the new class. And, I love it."
""
"Overall I had the bottle version of this numerous times and wasn't overly impressed, but the draft version is much better. Still, I prefer the Lake Erie Monster a bit more, but this is one solid DIPA. Great Lakes is a world class brewery and this is no exception."
"Pours orange-amber with a one and half finger off white head. Above average retention and remnants of lacing on the glass. Big tropical notes accented by floral notes and fresh cut grass and clean alcohol on the nose. Blood orange, passionfruit, pineapple and papaya. Light caramel accents midpalate. Finishes with fairly intense citrus rind upfront that tapers off quite quickly with floral notes and very evident alcohol. Full body that feigns lighter at times, slick and smooth. A solid DIPA that will please those that appreciate a bit of heat with their hops."
"Overall - a fine DIPA with some unique flavors. I do enjoy the tropical notes."

"I learn more about surfing from beer than anywhere else... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunset amber topped by a finger of light cream-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit zest, deep grape, light toffee, grass, mixed greens, and a decent amount of chlorinated hard water. The taste brings in more of the same, though the chlorine is thankfully diminished (nearly gone entirely) and there's significantly more citrus rind to be found. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a generally solid DIPA, but one that exhibits occasional characters than just don't endear it to me."

"O- This beer is delicious and dam near everything I hope for in a DIPA."
"Not terrible, but very much a """mehhh...""" DIPA. At least for me, this beer is a bit too sweet and isn't nearly hoppy enough. Alcohol is more noticeable than I would prefer as well. Can't see myself ordering this one again any time soon."

"O - wish it was thicker, viscosity is low. missing carbonation and frothiness some excellent IIPAs have. I personally love grapefruit so I like this. But, I wish the sweetness and bitterness could have been more mellowed together. I felt it was sweet in front and a very bitter lingerer."

"The beer pours a clear coppery amber with 3/4""" of white head that settles down to a centimeter of fluffy white blanketing. There is sticky lacing and it appears generously carbonated. The nose is predominantly spicy and piney hops with a touch of grapefruit/citrus. Booze and sugar become more prominent as it warms. The taste pushes forward a big sweetness to balance out this bitter beast; it's reminiscent of granulated sugar on grapefruit, which is then followed by a lingering lemon zest bitterness. Sharp, bitter hops clash with a huge malty sweetness in the mouthfeel, leaving the nearly 10%abv as an afterthought. It's grapefruit rind bitterness is well matched by sweetness resulting in a (surprisingly) drinkable DIPA. This beer reminds me of """this one goes to 11," with some obvious differences. If you're in the mood for a fresh, syrupy, hopped up DIPA that's affordable and easy to obtain (north east region)...this is your beer."
"Great Lakes has really outdone themselves with this beer. It is one of the best DIPAs I've ever had and joins the Blackout Stout and Christmas ale as one of GLBC's best offerings."
""
"O: This is one of my favorite DIPA's. Truly a great beer. Admittedly, I am a huge Great Lakes Brewing Company fan, but this beer is even better than I hoped for. Awesome."
"A great new offering from Great Lakes and a hopheads dream!"
""
""
""
"Pours with about 1/4""" of foamy head and minimal lacing, that disappears in about one minute leaving a beautiful golden clarity that lives up to name. Very forward citrusy aroma with a hint of honey. Hopheads will love the ample Mosaic and nugget hops dosage which dominates the flavor, as it should, but is still balanced by a solid malt base and trails into some honey notes again as well. Drinkable as hell and the 9.4% makes for an enjoyable time as well."
""
"o: Very impressed with this offering from GLBC. Very drinkable but just the same the ABV sneaks up on you. Yeah it's a bit pricy but I heartily recommend this for IPA fans. This will be a yearly purchase."
"O Very nice balance between honey maltiness in the middle and a nugget/simcoe hoppiness in the front and definately in the finish . I will buy this well hidden 10% abv brew from the shore of the Erie monster and great Christmas ales again before it's gone for the year. Seasonal offering not to be missed from Great Lakes Brewing."

"JJ"
"What a terrific new beer from Great Lakes. An entry that stands its own with Hopslam and other top shelf seasonal IIPAs. This is definitely one I'll seek out every year. I only bought one 4-pack and I should have bought more. The 4 cases my local store got sold out in only 3 days. Nicely done Great Lakes!"
""
"O: This is a great beer! Probably one of my favorites now from Great Lakes. this is also a dangerous beer because the ABV is 9.4 and it just tastes so good."
"I cant really make up my mind on this one, honestly. At times, I am totally on board with the interplay of the malts and hops, and at other times it just seems too sweet and convoluted. For shear complexity alone, though, I would give it my vote."

"12 ounce bottle, label stamp says enjoy by 05/09/13. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a slightly hazy orange/amber color with about a half inch off-white head that faded away quickly, but has a good amount of lacing. The aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like citrusy hops (mango, pineapple, orange), along with some floral hops, honey and caramel malt. It tastes like citrusy hops (orange peel, mango, apricots, grapefruit), floral hops, honey, and caramel and bready malt. There's a nice lingering bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation. I think this is a pretty good brew, Great Lakes has done a fine job with this one! $9.99 a 4-pack."
"O: If I didn't mention it already this is a very bold beer :) Quite well made, not that I'd expect anything less from GLBC. It's in your face yet balanced and complex. Though I wish it would be released in April not February as it would be great to sit and sip on a warm day outside, not by the fireplace in the middle of a Cleveland snow storm. That being said, I only bought one four-pack and need got get more"
"Always have been a fan of Great Lakes but sometime felt they were lacking a real nice hoppy beer, well this has changed that! Pours a beautiful orangish copper color with thick head and lacings that completely cover the glass throughout the process. I think the Mosaic hops create an experience much like no other hops can touch. Slightly bitter but the tropical flavor provides sweetness that would otherwise be needed by a malt backbone. I wouldnt say it is fully balanced but again I dont mind the Mosaic hops shining through in this beer. Aroma's are fantastic, mango, pineapple sweetness. I always try not to judge this as a WC IPA since I think some breweries in the midwest are redefining and creating their own with what they have available and this is a great example. Amazing Brew!"

"What this beer really does is that it quenches the winter's thirst for hoppy beers until the height of summer when Erie Monster returns. But does it really buy us time, or does it shift the framework of time in such that we now love these hoppy ales as much during the winter as we do summer?"
"O- I'm used to Great Lakes beers being top notch, but never though they would nail a west coast style beer with such success. This rivals the best double IPAs, it's slightly sweet, earthy, citrusy, and did i say juicy?I had high expectations for this one and it surpassed them, thanks GLBC for adding this to the line up!"

"Overall, it's worth trying if you're a DIPA fan. I credit Great Lakes for not brewing something highly citrus forward that would get lost in the shuffle. It wouldn't be in my top 5 DIPA, but it's certainly an enjoyable beer."
"O- Really good DIPA from GLBC, this beer took me by suprise, huge citrus notes, huge floral notes, just all around classic DIPA every thing fits just right."
""
"A good looking beer, about a full finger or so of white head on top of a golden amber liquid body. Smell is the typical unique Great Lakes malt aroma, backed up by some floral and fruity hops. Taste is more of the same, following the typical Great Lakes recipe for IPAs. Similar to Lake Erie Monster, but less hoppy and more fruity, although I wouldn't really classify the taste as """fruity""". It's more floral and citrus if anything, but either way it's less aggressive than The Monster. Mouthfeel is decent, once again similar to the other Great Lakes offerings. They don't deviate much from their base recipe, and this brew is no exception. However, at 9.4% ABV, it's a high-gravity option that has good flavor and low alcohol presence. All in all, a winner and a solid B+/A- rating."

"O- Meh. Would rather have Lake Erie Monster... or the new Rye of the Tiger when it comes out."

"Overall-More, that's how my mouth feels after a drink. Really solid stuff coming out of Great Lakes these days. High ABV that can hardly be tasted. Priced right, available everywhere in my area, even saw it at a gas station. As good as hopslam, if not better in some ways. 4.5"
""
""
"Quite simply the best thing Great Lakes has done. And they don't miss often. Good hop up front but mellows quite nicely. The ABV is sneaky on this one. A couple pints of this will surely wash away the rigors of the day. If HopSlam was to your liking, then you have just found a fine substitute."

"Overall - An outstanding, outstanding brew by Great Lakes here. Excellent brew."
"Mouthfeel is nice and thick, with not a lot of carbonation. Works pretty well with everything else going on. Overall this is a great brew, nice and complex, and pretty drinkable for the style. Definitely glad I grabbed this one."

"A true winner. Thanks Great Lakes"

"Pours a clear honey color with fluffy straw colored head. Aroma is of grapefruit, clove, lemongrass and fresh pine resin. The flavor is reminiscent of ripe ruby red grapefruit, with bready/malty sweetness. Some alcohol in the nose but it Mary's nicely with the hop and malt balance. Mouthfeel is rich and full and the drink ability would be wonderful if the Abu wasn't 9.4% great job GLB."
"Overall, this is a good beer but people here are acting like Great Lakes redefined the IPA. I love West Coast style IPA's and this can't hold a candle to the real-deal WC IPA's out there - Bad Boy would kick this beer's pansy ass. Poor Man's makes this look downright indigent. Again, I'm glad to see Great Lakes taking their portfolio in more of a new school direction, but this is just a good beer, not a game changer and certainly not a 4+."
"O - I love this beer. I have bought a dozen or so four packs. Great Lakes = great beer! This is one of my favorite DIPA's. I am sad that it's time is passing for this year."

"O: Been waiting to try Alchemy Hour since I heard about it a few months ago. A tad sweeter than my normal goto DIPAs/IIPAs , but very tasty. One of the smoothest drinking 9.0+ abv beers I've had."
""
"Pours a brilliant deep clear orange with an off white head that quickly dissipates to a slight ring on the glass. Aroma is of big tropical fruit notes, peach, mango, orange peel, muted pine, booze, honey sweetness. Upfront there is a big pop of tropical fruits followed by a honey sweetness in the middle of the mouth. At the back of the palate the sweetness transitions to a dry finish with grapefruit puckering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium to medium light. Deceptively smooth and light, the alcohol is perceptible but well hidden. What alcohol does come through helps cut the sweetness and keep the beer well balanced. A well crafted and enjoyable west coast DIPA by Great Lakes with a midwest uniqueness."
""

"Pours a deep orange/brown, looks almost exactly like honey. Smell is great! Mango, pineapples, grapefruit, smells like a tropical fruit salad. Taste is similar to the scent, grapefruit up front, some pineapple sweetness, finishes bitter with a touch of booze. Drinks very smooth for the ABV. Carbonation is spot on. Great mouthfeel. Great Lakes has really done a great job here. People should seek this out, I would say this is easily on the same league as Hopslam."

"A tropical beer to warm your soul and welcome higher temperatures! Pours a dark orange with a lasting head. Grapefruit and citrus with a pineapple sweetness and a slight sharp aftertaste. A nice balance between sweet and bitter. Nicely carbonated and resonates in the mouth. Great Lakes has created one nice DIPA, just sip slowly...this one is very good and very strong! Can't wait to see the new label for this one!"
""
""
"A very enjoyable DIPA, this is what I expect from brews that want to tackle this style."
""
"Bravo! Great Lakes hit a homerun with this one. I'm not being a homer. Hopheads should rejoice!"
""
"Danger! This is one smooth DIPA. Could easily forget it packs a huge ABV. At $10 for a 4-pack, competes nicely with Ohio's other hop forward brews: Head Hunter and White Rajah."
