Maybe this f bottle is a bit old at around 4 months, but I've had it fresh and hardly have noticed a difference.

4.1,0.7,,,,,,"Pours a shade darker than the typical DIPA amber with a smallish head of fine foam.  The smell of the beer was earthy, a little citric, and milder than I was hoping.  The taste was more hop-centric than the smell, as the citric flavors seemed to kick into overdrive at the start of the sip.  The beer stayed citric mid palette, and allowed a touch of watermelon to slip in towards the end of the sip.  The finish was surprisingly a little sweet, and the aftertaste was herbal.  This was quite complex for the style.  The body was medium dense and the feel sticky.  A balanced DIPA.","rajendra82","Aug 28, 2014"

4.54,11.5,4.5,4.25,4.75,4.5,4.5,"Poured undated 12 oz bottle into pint glass. This is excellent beer. It brings to mind """Pliney the Elder""". The flavor profile is very similar. Pours a clear golden-yellow with a tinge of orange, with a thin white head and minimal lacing. Not a huge aroma, but its clean, floral and slightly dank, with some pineapple and peach. The taste is wonderful and just gets better the more you drink it. It's somewhat fruity and buttery with a perfect balance of sweet maltiness and huge hops but low bitterness. Mouthfeel is full and smooth with low carbonation, but still refreshing with well concealed alchohol. Overall, I'd say this is world class...a really great Imperial IPA.","FFreak","Jul 23, 2014"

Pine and caramel are abundant in the aroma. Flavor is of pepper, some pine and the caramel malt sweetness is really working here for me. Very smooth to drink with just a moderate bite on the palate. Dated 5/01/14 and enjoyed 6/22/14. May not be fresh for and IPA but this was fantastic! In closing, never had seen or heard of this brew but always not really sure what to think of Southern Tier beers. Either I love them or they are just okay, for me alone. Unearthly is quite awesome. Glad I picked this one up; which I did just because it was an Imperial IPA and it did not disappoint!","dpgoblejr","Jun 22, 2014"

This one pours a beautiful hazy copper color with a thick off white head that gives way to a nice film and lacing. The nose is malty with a slight hoppy bitterness. This bottle was born more than a year ago so the hop notes have subsided and left a rich malty beer almost reminiscent of a scotch ale more than an ipa. The flavor further confirms this opinion. Id love to try a fresh bottle of this ale because even an older one is impressive.","lochef81","Feb 26, 2014"

Pours crystal clear bright orange amber color with a 2 finger dense off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of huge tangerine, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange zest/rind, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grass earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt balance; with great strength. Taste of big tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, orange zest/rind, lemon zest, light mango, floral, grass, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, orange zest/rind, lemon zest, light mango, floral, grass, light pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of citrus/tropical hops with moderate malt flavors; and a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and fairly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent DIPA! All around great complexity of bright citrus/tropical hops and moderate malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 22, 2014"

Tastes more like a Barleywine than a DIPA. With that being said, it is still a pretty nice beer.

I've heard a lot of good things about Unearthly, so when I saw it at Wegmans in Syracuse, NY I decided to give it a try. Looks like your standard IPA. Golden copper. Smells very boozy and sweet. No sense of hops in there at all. Taste is really sweet and boozy as well. Hops play such a small role in this beer. I'm wondering if I got an old bottle or something. Mouthfeel is a little syrupy, but overall not bad. This beer is just way too sweet and malty for me. It doesn't even really taste like an IPA.

4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Another great beer from this brewery. It's an amber colored, transparent liquid. An off-white head sits on top, long lived and lace-producing. Resin and pepper hop aroma. Some herb and sweet malt in the scent. The real pleasure is int the taste...sweet, a hint of toast, honey-topped bread, and flowery, mildly bitter hops. Lots of alcohol warmth, and a 'big-beer' feel. Thick, sweet, bitter in the finish. A bitterness that keeps coming in the aftertaste...wave on wave. Full, thick, and luxurious in body. Full-on high abv IPA.","Suds","Jul 06, 2013"

4.18,2.7,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"this is everything one could hope for in an east coast imperial ipa. it pours a decadent orange brassy color, dense and bright, with a luscious head, just off white, about an inch tall. the nose on this is intensely hoppy, oily heavy, and delicious. it reminds me somewhat of the founders centennial ipa, in the sense that its got that almost lumber quality to it, woody and sturdy, earthy and bitter, very nice aromatics here. I cant place the hops variety exactly, but its familiar to me for sure. big bitter hops all the way through the flavor of this one, with that fresh milled lumber element coming in and out. I get some sort of English malt underlying it all, and maybe even some English style bitter hops, but I also get bold American fruity and piney hops, sappy and fresh, penetrating my palate. the hopback process has been an obvious success here. good carbonation, fuller body, almost chewy in that classic way my mother describes big beers she cant comprehend. satisfying after a few days of not drinking, and a beer I am already dying to score again. one of the best from southern tier for sure.","StonedTrippin","Jun 23, 2013"

It doesn’t assault the nose like some IPA’s but boasts it’s hops behind the strength of it’s malt. Slick pine, oak and moss. On the palate the malt stays steady and sweet while the hops come up to a tart flourish. The body is heavy and slightly thick, mouthfeel is creamy but a little syrupy. An expressive IPA that lingers bitter and amenable.","utopiajane","Jun 11, 2013"

I get some floral hop notes along with some grassiness maybe a bit of mild fruit. This is a very malt forward IPA without a lot of hop bitterness on the back end. There is some bitterness present. I get some fruitiness that reminds me of peach as well. The body is full and moderately carbonated. The finish is slightly dry. This is a good beer.","acevenom","Apr 04, 2013"

The lacing slides down the glass and glitters like a fireworks shower explosion. Sweetness of miso and caramel peanuts remains in the aftertaste with a bit of excess gas. Overall, an amazing strong IPA with its 125 IBUs that will lead me to more Southern Tiers. Easily one of my favorite IPAs ever.","shigg85","Jul 01, 2012"

It could just be that I’m not crazy about the particular hop profile, but this beer seems to be a bit lacking in that department, especially for something that touts “aggressive” and “unearthly” hop usage. Still, this is very tasty, the hop (and rye?) spice is a nice touch, and the alcohol is hidden very well. A final point: there are some breweries that have a certain “taste” no matter what style you’re drinking. Sierra Nevada is one example. Southern Tier is another. I’ve had a couple of their beers (only reviewed one), and they all have something about them that resonates through all of their offerings. I enjoy when beers from the same brewery have this quality and see it as a nice signature touch.","BlackBelt5112203","Jun 10, 2012"

As an example of the style, I don't think I could recommend this, but for a big, bold, sweet beer that gets you hammered, it's worth the bomber (or growler if you can find it).","mrmkahn","Jun 09, 2012"

Nose has some flesh citrus notes with a good dose of pine and resinous hop notes. Really sweet and sugary malt notes - perhaps 'over'-balanced in terms of malt character, a tad much for what I'd prefer in a DIPA, but not bad by any stretch. Taste has more flesh citrus, pine, honeydew melon and some sweet sugary cookie/biscuity malts with a lot of sweetness to it. Alcohol is meshed in with this. Full bodied for the style, and carbonation remains low and smooth; harder to finish as it warms due to the sweetness however. Filling and easily destructive of sobriety, but I don't think I enjoyed this much as I have previously. Perhaps bottle freshness was the culprit.","liamt07","Feb 27, 2012"

I get some cereal graininess, sweet malts, and light citrus and maybe mango. The taste is along the same lines as the smell, just more intense. Sweet malts hit you up front, the bitterness comes through in the middle and end, but the malty sweetness keeps it balanced the entire time. Mouthfeel is creamy. Overall, much better than the other Southern Tier IPA offerings. I would have liked to see more bitterness as this is a pretty sweet DIPA. My main complaint with Southern Tier IPAs is that they all seem to be too sweet. I love balanced IPAs,but this one is a little more malty than it is bitter. The 9.5% is definitely noticeable, but not unpleasant. Good DIPA and one that I would recommend to those who like sweeter DIPAs.","hmf05","Nov 07, 2011"

Citrus and pine smell with a sweetness I cant really describe. Tastes hoppy up front then transistions into a slight alcohol taste that is well balanced. Ends with a nice sweetness. Very nice mouthfeel, carbonated great with the right bitterness. Overall I'm very happy with the this beer. i bought it on a whim and I'm glad I did.

When it hit my palette I thought """fruity""" which is normally not something I like. Someone described the taste as medicine-like which fits initially but by the time I finished my first glass I was anxious for more.

See what dating your bottles can do, ST? I'll definitely be buying more of this. And 2XIPA, while I'm at it.

With that kind of sweetness and the ABV of this beer, it's flavor is almost like a cross between a barleywine and an IPA. Like barleywines (which I don't particularly care for) it was a bit medicine-tasting to suit my palate. I did like this one a bit more than the oak-aged version. I probably won't buy it again, but don't let that stop you. It could be just what you're looking for.","deadonhisfeet","Oct 22, 2011"

Smell is very much like a barleywine with malt, caramel, toffee, and lots of citrus zest hop aromas. Taste is also very much like a hoppy barleywine with malt, caramel/toffee, brown sugar, and some citrus zest on the finish. A mild bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a mild carbonation with a crisp yet smooth and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that seems much more like a barleywine than a DIPA. I am pretty sure this was not intended but it's very good none the less.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 14, 2011"

This is not a session beer, and not a beer that I’d split with someone, but it is a very tasty DIPA that I will come back to year after year because it always tastes so damn good and flavorful, and always is an experience to drink. This is a slow sipper that is meant to tingle your mind the same way it tingles your taste buds.

There is a nice tropical element in this that seems outweighed by the caramel malt slightly which is unfortunate. I prefere a more dry Imperial IPA, but for this style I think this beer is very good.

Lots of sweet flavors in this beer hide the alcohol well, and balance out the bitter profiles. Mouthfeel- syrupy and sweet but not cloying, appropriate carbonation, well balanced. This reminds me of DFH 90 minute in a way (maybe the malt profile?) Drinkability- for 11%, the abv is well hidden here and this is an overall well balanced representation of the IIPA style.

First taste is a rather bitter bite of hops - earthy, floral are dominant with pine and citrus in the rear. Strong toffee, carmel and bready malt backbone, slightly sweet.

There isn't a whole lot going on with the nose. Some light malt with a light lemon and grapefruit citrus. On the palate, this beer is much more exciting. On the front of the palate, it tastes dangerously hoppy, but that quickly fades to show a very balanced IPA. There are some biscuit flavors, with just a hint of sweetness. The back of the palate is dominated by citrus rind notes. The carbonation is average, with an oily and coating palate and a long lasting bitter finish. This beer is very good.

4.47,9.8,4.5,5,4.5,4,4,"I just picked this up at RSVP in Portland, ME. It's my first Southern Tier purchase since they began distribution in Maine. The bottle was warm, so I chilled it in the fridge for about 20-30 minutes before pouring it into my Smuttynose Big Beer Series goblet. The beer pours out with a big tan foam head. Some carbonation is rising in the liquid, which is translucent and has a beautiful rusty orange hue. Swirling the beer leaves a decent amount of lacework. This is a very pretty beer; nearly perfect for the style. The aroma is magnificent. Big, bready hops fill my nose. There is also some pine and malt sweetness. This smells like a hearty beer. The flavor begins with some light grassy hops as soon as the beer touches my lips. Big, artisanal bread malts make up the backbone of the beer; they appear next. On top of the malts are chunky, bitter hops. When I swallow, I can pick up a bit of the alcohol and a lot of bitterness. It is hot, sharp, and in your face. I like it a lot. There is hardly any sweetness, which is equally surprising and impressive. This is pretty full-bodied beer. It leaves a noticeable coat, but not as much as many beers that use the """Imperial""" qualifier. There is average carbonation and some stickiness on my lips. The bitter oils can really be felt on my tongue. For a strong, hoppy beer, this is pretty drinkable. I wouldn't order round after round of Unearthly, but I certainly won't have any problems finishing all 22 ounces by myself. I'm really enjoying this brew. I think it offers great evidence that top DIPAs do not have to come from the Pacific time zone--us folks back east can work our hop magic as well.

This juxtaposition and mutual transformation is quite pleasant, though it clearly gives the beer more commonalities with great Barleywines than it has with high quality DIPAs.

Bomber pours into tulip a dark amber, almost reddish hue, with sizeable eggshell color head that leaves tremendous lacing about the entire glass. Surely is on the darker side for an IPA, but can be expected due to its """Imperial""" status. Smells of light hop, and more malt than expected. Alcohol twinge also touches the nose after a hefty whiff. Taste on this bad boy is surprisingly malty, seems to be more pronounced than the hop bitterness. That malt backbone makes itself known, but is followed up sharply by a stinging slap of hops on the taste buds. Surely an interesting spin on the """Imperial""" IPA. Feeling this one out is a real pleasure, tingly on the palate, also the slick and oily characteristic that is so often associated with IPAs is present. For such a """big""" beer, the drinkability is certainly above average, just because it does taste so damn good. In my eyes, Unearthly has certainly redeemed itself.

The beer is a clear, dark copper color with two fingers of dense white foam that bubbles over the rim. Smell is of spicy, piney hops. Some citrus notes but they are secondary to the pine. Tastes of piney spice, and bitter hops backed by sweet malts. Some caramel, but by the time it reaches the back of the tongue the hops have regained control with a vengance. Finish is dry and bitter just the way I like a big DIPA. Feel is right for the style with enough bubbles to keep things lively, and a viscosity level that sticks to the mouth but is not too thick. ABV is well hidden making this a very drinkable beer. IMHO this is an excellent DIPA, that I am glad I got the opportunity to try. If it was available in Cali I would buy it on a regular basis.

Tons of syrupy, sweet slighty toasted bitterness up front with some perfumy notes at the back of your tongue. For me it's borderline too sweet, but as you work your way through a bomber it mellows and balances out enough to make it quite enjoyable. The alcohol, as always with Southern Tier, is extremely well hidden.

4.05,-0.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours an amber orange color with a huge head that retains throughout the journey. Moderate lacing and carbonation. Smell is pine hops to the max, caramel, alcohol, and a bit of dark fruit. Taste is hoppy as hell, which is a delicious thing. As it warms up it gets a little sweeter and the booze starts to come out. The finish is an all encompassing bitterness, take it or leave it. Personally I enjoy the bitterness, but drinking more than maybe 2 glasses of this may prove difficult. Mouthfeel is a bit watery and doesn't really stack up with the rest of its attributes.","atremains","Aug 29, 2009"

Smells of pine hops and some malts that turns into raisins and a bit of alcohol with hops, good smell here. Tastes extremely bitter with citrus and piney hops, also get the raisins in here, some alcohol shines through, malts which contribute some sweetness, a tiny bit too much alcohol taste here for me. Mouthfeel is medium and creamy with pretty high alcohol warming that leaves a piney/raisiny aftertaste, not my favorite after taste. Drinkability is decent here, alcohol and raisiny taste will overcome the hops for me after a while, this is definitely for you if you love bitterness though, glad I picked this one up.","cbutova","Aug 29, 2009"

The caramalt sweetness is just okay, and--again--not really what I'm looking for from an IPA. My take on drinkability aligns with basically every other reaction to this beer--it's okay at best.

4.5,10.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours deep-gold and slightly hazy. The nose is immediate with forward hops and sweet grain notes reminiscent of grape-nuts cereal. Clean, clear. deliberate hoppy notes. When poured an off-white-tan head forms with creamy top and medium to small bubbles below. Half-inch head stays till the bitter end. Medium body with hop throughout the palate. The hops is countered with malt notes that evidence sweet caramel, toasted grain and toffee. Hints of leather. Average carbonation. Creamy texture. Pleasant bitter lingering with notes of sweetness. The alcohol is not evident on the palate, but with 11% ABV this ale warrants caution. Moderate to marked lacing. The flavor is long-lasting. This ale is excellent on its own, but would be great with food that needs a bitter or structured accompaniment. Would be an excellent aperitif.","carlborch","Jul 30, 2009"

Wonderful hop aroma, nice copper color, with a fluffy tan head that laced the glass evenly throughout consumption. The taste was reminiscent of Flying Dog Brewery's Double Dog DIPA, possibly due to the high alcohol content of both beers. The taste is slightly coppery with a strong hop presence and a definite alcohol finish.","cullen0013","Jul 22, 2009"
4.23,3.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"I really liked this, I saved it for about 8 months or so and finally decided to break it out. I was a little worried about the flavor being a little compromised from this bottle because I had it in the fridge and had to move. It was in the fridge then went back down to room temp during the move, it happened again after taking it to a a friends for his birthday but we didn't end up drinking it then either so it went back down to room temp again. So this bottle survived two to major temperature changes. Well to the appraisal. From a bottle poured into a Sam's perfect pint glass. This beer had a great look to it, slightly darker than a normal IPA, almost a quality lager. Had a golden color, not completely clear with the slightest of slightest haze. Had some pretty good lacing to it too, lasted the entire drink. Smells is good, has a nice strong hoppy smell to it. Tastes great nice strong and refreshing hoppy taste. The taste lingers on a bit which is really nice. Had very good mouthfeel and drinkabiliy as well. Very nice drink to have, especially on a nice summer or warm spring day. Great brew from Southern Tier, highly recommended.","AndyAvalanche","Jul 16, 2009"

Yeah it gives you a warmth to the belly but I've had 7 percenters that had more kick. Despite the negativity this is a tasty beer.

The taste is very sweet and not bitter at all. Hoppy, sweet, grapefruit, has a very similar taste to many other IPAs I've had and it stands up there as pretty good compared to those. For having an 11% ABV I think it's hidden very well. I'll be able to finish the bomber pretty easily no problem.

The flavors were equally complex, lots of citrus and citrus rind that then gave way to herbal and piney elements along with alcohol and doughy malt that balanced the beer nicely. The 11% was very well-hidden, it drank like a beer half its strength. The mouthfeel was creamy, soft and a touch oily, the body medium/full and the carbonation delicate. The hop complexity was impressive and the beer totally on-point for the style.","thekevlarkid","Apr 15, 2009"
4.47,9.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear and inviting pale amber color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of strong hops, some sweet malt, and faint notes of earthy malt as well. This brew smelled amazing from the moment I popped the cap and only seems to get better. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a high carbonation level. Tastes of a couple types of hop very nicely blended up front, then some earthy malt comes through strongly, there's a general sweetness (brown sugar?) that comes through, there's also a slight pine kick, and the finish is more hop flavor. A slight dryness is associated but not to a bad degree. The finish is very smooth and the overall flavor character is well blended. I highly recommend this brew.","Tone","Apr 12, 2009"

Mostly hop flavors but some malt foundation for the hops to cling to. Body is average for an ImpIPA, as is drinkability. A solid, but not outstanding, version of the style. This beer very much reminds me of Stone IPA, but obviously with more of a kick. Since that is one of my favorite IPAs, this is a good thing.

When tasted it reminded me a bit of the DFH 90min due to the Malt being easily detectable, though in this particular beer it was very prominent. Hops are right there along with it, but I feel that I had an older beer as they were not as strong as I have heard. Unearthly was a very easy beer to drink and very smooth.

A bit of an Earthy, herbal smell, with a bit of a crisp floral note, filled with hop resin, but the smells are subdued. The taste is pretty nice. There's a big hit of bitterness, and some good sweetness to balance it out. The hop flavor is very resinousy, with a bit of sweet citrus taste, no peel. A tiny bit of fruitiness from the hops with a big peachy burn from the alcohol. A little less alcohol is really all I'd like to see. Something about the taste really reminds me of a bag of pungent, resinousy hops. The mouthfeel is kind of thin, and the alcohol burn kind of turns my mouth off, but really the resinous feeling is one that I've come to love. It might not be a favorite of others, but I find that it enhanced the mouthfeel here. But I really enjoyed making my way through this beer.

SMELL is floral and citrus hop blending, as mom noted, with rich malty backbone. Well balanced and blended, complex, smooth, inviting, has long legs. TASTE the malty sweetness, floral and citrus hops, with medium bitterness ascending through the middle, and then lingering a bit. Quite smooth and mostly balanced.

The nose of intense citrus and floral hops rises pleasantly. The mouthfeel is thick and sticky with a viscous pine resin punch ably supported by a malty sweetness and grapefruit citrus structure. The alcohol is obviously present in a warm backing roll. It lingers long, leaving a spicy, oily, pine forest misted in a fog of citrus. As the mouth becomes familiar with the onslaught of hopspice, the backing sweetness of toasted malt becomes more apparent and hints of flowers suggest themselves. Tastes WAY too good and goes down WAY WAY too easy to weigh in at 11% abv. Afterwards, all that alcohol still numbs the mind less than one would think.

A little sticky as well. It is truly hard to believe this beer is 11% abv. A fantastic IIPA, though short of elite.

With that said the aging seemed to have taken away some of the bitterness of this beer. The Red Wheat in the beer gives it the nice color. A nice light bronze color with a 1 to 1 1/2 finger head. Lacing is nice and sticks to the glass nicely. The beer is very sweet for an Imperial IPA. I don't know why people think it's a DIPA, but it's not. Smell I get a nice citrus (orangey) and floral hop aroma. For a high abv/ibu beer I get none of it, which I find good about this beer.

It pours a clear deep copper hue under a short-lived light beige one finger head that manages to generate some very impressive lace before fading to film and collar. The nose is a wonderful bouquet of citrus and flower, strong on the grapefruit but not ignoring the carnation, either. The mouth is slightly sticky and quite prickly, evidence of significant carbonation. The taste is all hops, predominantly citrus again. but with a significant espresso bitter hiding underneath. The citrus fades on the swallow, leaving the dry espresso bitter to dominate the finish and aftertaste, achingly urging another swig. There's plenty of alcohol here, which does not try to hide its influence. This is a bold and uncompromising drink, not for the faint of heart. Yum!","Globetrotter","Dec 30, 2008"

Upon hitting my lips, I felt very strongly that I was experiencing a cornucopia of hops. Lot of dry hopping involved I presume, given how intimate and """fresh""" all the estery, citrus flavors come together. With a smooth palate, Un*earthly just seduces you into an indulgence of citrus, grapefruit, and pine, all of which are perfectly balanced by sweeter malt and ripe orange.

Taste follows nose - malt is picked up in the mouth, followed by sweet and culminating in a slightly bitter/astringent finish.

In the taste, the hops are more peppery/earthy/vegetal; aside from the slight caramel flavor, this beer is very dry in the mouth. For a big IPA, the malt is very impressive, as it plays a supporting role while still being very interesting in its own right. The red wheat definitely comes through with a sharp tartness in the finish. The alcohol level in this beer is near-invisible, and if I didn't know any better, I'd guess it was maybe 7%ABV.

The smell was huge filling the car as soon as it was opened(thats right I said the car). Big time piney spice smell that faded into what could best be described as old cheese although strangely not in a bad way. Delicious hop explosion right off the first sip followed by a slightly soapy taste(again not in a bad way) finishing up with a very mild smooth alcohol warmth. Definite hop oil mouthfeel coating the mouth and leaving that hopspice all over the tongue Very well balanced and unassuming for an 11% ABV.

Medium in body with good carbonation, smooth, sticky, sweet, and bitter with noticeable alcohol that comes out more as the beer warms up and becomes medicinal.

Floral and citrus hops appear in the middle, but seem more no more abundant than in the standard IPA - perhaps they are subdued by the malt. The mix of flavours makes the aftertaste pleasant, with the alcohol only peeking out from behind a curtain of resin and malt.

Dominant scents include sticky pine, ripe citrus fruit, and subtle earthiness. I also get some lesser scents including bready malt and an underlying honey sweetness smell. The taste is of very sweet honey-like malt and bitter hops. There is a bit of a caramel undertone to this beer as well. The hops seem a bit subdued and do not have the quality on the palate as they do in the nose. The mouthfeel is medium and the alcohol is very well hidden. The drinkability did not hold well for me on this beer. It was very sweet and I suspect underattenuation on this beer. That would explain a nice body and mouthfeel and an overall sweet taste.","TheodorHerzl","Apr 03, 2008"

These ST bombers can get expensive, but this one's certainly worth it, and I'd undoubtedly try it again, and if you have to choose either the Hoppe or this, choose the latter.

4.52,11.1,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Unearthly poured a clear honey amber that had a 1 inch head of creamy white foam. This creamy foam had really good retention that left behind a small white film and quite a few thick streaks of creamy white lace. It had a big time powerful aroma of sour grapefruit, fresh pine, citrus hops, citrus fruits, more pine, and then it ended with more sour grapefruit. The taste was just as powerful as the aroma. That means the taste was just filled with pine, sour grapefruit, citrus fruits, a pinch of earth, and then the taste ends with powerful citrus hops that tasted like the hops unleashed a wolverine sized aggresiveness of hops on your tongue. If you couldn't tell already, it was a full bodied beer that had a long lasting aftertaste of pine, grapefruit, citrus hops, and citus fruits. Where was the strong ABV of 11%? If it was in there, I couldn't feel it and it was probably covered up by all the citrus flavors and pine that were in here. Overall, Unearthly was noting short of a great hoppy beer. I was happy that I got to try this hoppy winner on tap. Just be a litte careful with this one because it will sneak up on you.","AltBock","Mar 18, 2008"

It's boiled with Chinook and Cascade, sent through the hopback with Styrian Goldings, then dry-hopped with Cascade, Centennial, and Chinook. The hop bill listed on my bottle doesn't match the one online, so either mine is an old version, or they haven't updated the site yet; the recipe on the internet lists this brew as 153 IBUs, and the bottle suggests it be served at 42 degrees, but I sampled it warmer than that. The beer is a nice, lightly-hazed orangey/amber, with low carbonation and three fingers of tan head that leaves some nice lace. Lots of hop oils in the nose, with juicy citrus (candied orange, grapefruit), sea salt, pale malt and just a hint of wheat. It has a very malty, thick, lightly sweet body with strong citric grapefruit, a medium/high bitterness and a suggestion of tartness. Smooth, dry, and lightly numbing on the palate, with low carbonation and a lingering finish.

A high level of complexity is shown on the palate with nice malt balanced richness, and hop created sweetness. There is a steady bitter feel but it is welcomed and warm with just a touch of alchol which is amazing considering its 11% alchol. As I continue to drink I continue to love this beers balanced sweetness, richness and bitter feel. This is an awsome achievement of craft beer. Drinkability is of the chart for this level of alchol.

While very smooth and likely to be drinkable with many foods, it didn't strike me as a double IPA that I'll return to just to drink on its own.

Smells of honeyed malt with a good dose of citrusy and floral hops- delicate and flower-like. Well balanced with the ample malt there in a supporting role for the very fresh smelling hops. The taste is absolutely beautiful. A very slightly floral sweetness begins the flavor parade, which then gently merges into a complex citrusy and floral hop bitterness with a nice touch of pine on the finish. These hop flavors become more herbal as the beer warms and opens up. This is one fresh tasting beer!. The mouthfeel is incredibly creamy and quite soft. Amazingly integrated and drinks well below the 11% abv. Deliciously drinkable despite the high alcohol. Like many great beers, this is complex and changes a good bit in the glass.

It starts off strong with a good hop bite and finishes with just the right amount of hop bitter aftertaste. Not sure of the age of this one so it may be older and more mellow than normal but I really enjoyed it. It gives the great hop taste without shredding your tongue to oblivion. Great mouthfeel.

The aromas are fresh floral hops, with some nice citrusy resins in the mix as well. Lots of pine, and citrus witha bready malt backbone as well. The taste is quite similar to the aroma. This is a big double IPA but it hides its strength well. The hops are abrasive and oily but the malt backbone is big enough to keep this one together.

Sour pineapple/mango in the hops, with bitterness and resinous notes. The sweetness and the booziness were nicely in check, most likely drowned out by hops.

I would've guessed 153 IBUs would've brought me more bitterness. The bitterness is there, don't get me wrong, but it's not over-the-top. The alcohol actually lingers more than the bitternss.

Very herbal hop profile to be sure, a bit medicinal. There's a super-hefty malt bill too, but all that lovely butterscotch and vanilla flavour gets dominated by the hops. Finish is aggresively bitter and fairly dry with nothing but hops left behind. Mouthfeel is buzzing from all the hops and the fairly agressive carbonation, the body is a bit thick and the booze definitely comes through. This is a balls out Double IPA, perhaps the most bitter I've had to date. I find many tend to be more balanced than this, but this is a straight-up hop bomb with no apologies.

(The bottle reads that it is brewed with chinook and cascade in the kettle, styrian goldings in the hopback (I guess not all American hops), and the 3 C's for dry hop). The taste is incredible. It's way more balanced than I expected at 11%. Warming ethanol makes way to malt quickly kicked in the mouth by a huge dose of the hops. Delicious. Medium to heavy body, a little viscous.

Dark sediment lingers at the bottom of the bottle. Recommended a bit cool; as it warms the viscosity becomes more apparent and the carbonation fades from lively to non-existant. Huge, sticky hoppy kick, and a big chewy malt base. 153 IBUs don't really dominate or overpower as one might expect, but do provide a great hoppy contrast to the malts, and do a great job in the process.

If I had to fault this beer, it is on the sweet side, but given the 11%, not a surprise. Not overly sweet, I thought played well with the hops.

The nose is quite pleasant and not too bold, but still enough hops. For 11%, not much alcohol hits my nose, but the hoppiness is clean and floral, and not overly big. Some slight sugary sweetness also hits my nose, but the subtle hops take over the aroma of this one. The sip reveals a quite sweet shot up front of some rock candy, with a biscuity flavor coming through that reminds me of mom's chicken and dumplings (YUM!!). The hope end up taking over with bitterness, along with a healthy dose of alcohol that comes and dries it out almost completely, leaving almost a bourbon aftertaste (feeling also). Carbonation is mild on the sides of my tongue and the bitterness makes me feel like I'm eating hops, and the alcohol makes this very dry. Overall, one bottle will do for me I think.

Oily hop and alcohol flavor. hops are the defining flavor and there is a good amount of bitterness but not a ton.

The dryness of the hops, combined with the pronounced alcohols leaves a very spicy and dry sensation immediately. The flavors, though rich with caramels and barley, are thinned by the alcohols and citrus hops. The hops deliver strong citrus, pine, and earthy flavors of higher proportions. Along with flavor, the hops give a serious bitterness without the soapy, metalic flavors expected in big ipa's. The feel is full and rich, but I stop shy of saying 'thick or heavy'. Finishes with a focus on the dry, spicy hops with back-up tones of carmel malts and smooth fermented barley. Well balanced and strong flavored.

Roasted malts, caramel characters surrounded by extraordinarily tasty dry bitter hop characters. Alcohol is there but at eleven percent it does a great job of not making a dominant force. Fantastic mouthfeel that maintains crisp even carbonation to the end. Notes of toffee and buttery flavors get stronger as it warms.

4.32,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I had a chance to try a split off a big bottle of this last evening. Wow! Good color, nice head, inviting. Impressive hop aroma, substantial hop flavors (perhaps more Cascade in the aroma and flavor than I'd like, but that's ok) but so beautifully balanced with the dryness of the alcohol (high at 11%) and the chewy caramely malt that it sure shocked me when I heard how many IBUs it had in it. A very nice example of the style. By the name alone I had expected a bigger dose of hops, the balance thrown badly askew, so I was quite happy. I think this would hold up well against similar product from other makers (Victory, Stone, Stoudt, DFH Burton?), but I think the true hop-head would probably be better off with Weyerbacher Hops Infusion or Three Floyds' Dreadnaught or maybe even the (lighter single IPA) Legacy HHH because of this deceptive balance.

The flavor focuses more on actual hop flavor than just over-the-top smack you in the kisser IBUs. Great tangerine, pineapple, and pine rosin flavors that are very well balanced with the malt profile. This beer also does not seem to be 11% ABV; it's very well crafted. Mouthfeel is solid, without the thickness of most big beers. Drinkability is fantastic.

It pours smoothly into my pint glass with a rich, frothy head and an orange-almost reddish color. The aroma of hops dominates his beer and going in for the first sip, I was worried that it would be too much. On the contrary, it was perfectly balanced. This is a true hop-heads delight.

It has huge caramel notes balanced out by big juicy and sweet grapefruity hop. There is a lot of sweetness in the nose here. Its almost a bit too much for me. Flavor is pretty nice. It is definately dominated by big caramel maltyness. It is backed with a moderate grapefruity hop and a very mild and faint piney hop that is mostly flavor. The bitterness on the finish is very mild, and I think this keeps the beer very easy drinking. There is really no hint of the 11% ABV in the flavor at all. Mouthfeel is thick, almost a touch slick and syrupy. The carbonation is pretty much absent, so this one really sits heavy. As far as DIPA's go, this one is working well for me. The nose is a bit strong in sweetness, but this is more balanced in the flavor. Its defintaly letting me know that the alcohol is there as I drink more of it, but its not in the nose or flavor.

4.32,6.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Just be careful of the 11% ABV. Other than that, I want to try this big bodied beer the next time on on a walk in the woods. Great with cheese and crackers or BBQ (hot dogs/hamburg).","tonytuffnuts","May 16, 2006"

4.33,6.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Had it in a pint glass, served from 650ml bottle. Nice and red with a small but noticable head. Deliciously hoppy from the start with a slight (very slight) syrupy flavor. Very bitter, but in a good way. I wish I had a couple more to drink right now, but the store's closed.","swhitt","May 10, 2006"
4.44,9.1,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Mouthfeel is rather big and chewy...this one really makes itself known with each sip. Mellower on the carbonation side, which is nice. I really enjoy the flavor here, but the 11% abv hinders the drinkability a bit for me, as this bomber is gonna get me plenty buzzed. Overall, a wonderfully hoppy brew that still maintains a sturdy malt backbone...this is a DIPA I hope to have the chance to come back to again sometime and another winner for Souther Tier. Thanks warriorsoul!","orbitalr0x","May 07, 2006"
4.22,3.7,4,4.5,4.5,3,4,"D- Very, very smooth for a double IPA. 11% is not evident in taste, but after one bottle I could feel it in my brain. Best to enjoy in moderation.","PenguinBeerFan","Apr 25, 2006"
4.29,5.4,4,5,4.5,4.5,3,"Holy hops!! What a beer this is. Grassy smell and taste, grapefruit galore. Only problem is, too much alcohol. A person can only drink a couple of these, if they are in a 12 oz. bottle, cause it waxes you!!! But it has nice malt character on the front end, followed by some outrageous hops. Great divide IPA is probably the closest to this terrific beer. Highly recommended, just don't drink too many.","bigdeuce","Apr 24, 2006"

4.45,9.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Probably the most drinkable 11% beer I've ever had. Very dangerous. You don't notice the alcohol until it hits you. At $6.99 a bottle I would probably be satisfied drinking two Big Foots instead of this, but still one of the better double IPA's out there.","ej285701","Apr 22, 2006"
4.2,3.2,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This certainly isn't a beer for all day pounding, but as DIPA's go, this one is right there. Great hop character, enough malt backbone for balance, and a good alcohol kick, which, let's face it, is part of the DIPA thing. Overall, a very nice job, and a good representation of the style. And at 11%, it will hurt you quick!","jakester","Apr 22, 2006"
4.45,9.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability & Notes  Great beer, more like a double red along the lines of Nugget Nectar than a traditional double IPA, did I really just say traditional DIPA? The malt character is much more evident than is standard for the style, but the hops are still huge, fresh and clean. By far the best beer I've had from Southern Tier, time to grab a couple more bottles of this.","OldSock","Apr 20, 2006"

4.97,22.1,4.5,5,5,5,5,"This is the best DIPA I have tried so far (havent been that many yet unfortunately). I beer like this proves amply that DIPA is just as complex and nuanced a style as a Belgian Quad or a Russian Imperial Stout. They arent just about high hop levels.","CAMRAhardliner","Apr 11, 2006"
4.63,13.8,5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"Poured a great rich clear bronze witha very well retained 1/2 finger head with a fine bead just a pleasure to look at I have to say.The aromas are quite citric alot grapefruit in there maybe a note of apricot over top of caramel malt a whif of alcohol shows thru more so as it warms.This is not an in your face DIPA although the hops do pack a good punch not to mention alot of complexities citrus and piney cascades and chinooks really show themselves I even get a little earthiness as it warms saying all that there is a big enough of juicy lightly sweet caramel malt backbone to almost hold up against the hop onslaught.Wow amazed at this beer the alcohol is so well hidden you would have no idea how big it was and the hops take the show,"an unhibited infusion of hops""" per bottle that sums it up,kick ass!","oberon","Apr 11, 2006"
4.8,17.9,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"Very enjoyable and drinkable. Beer flavors balance out superbly with the alcohol there to remind you of its """double-ness.""" Despite the high ABV very drinkable and enjoyable. I'll look for this again soon.","Sycodrummer","Apr 05, 2006"

4.53,11.3,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"I am so sold on Southern Tier beers, it's not even funny. I tried and thoroughy enjoyed their IPA and the Java Stout, but this is better than either of those. What makes it incredible is the fact that it is a whopping 150 IBUs (it says it right on the side...props to the brewers for providing all the numerical info right on the side of their bottles) and is balanced with a piney sweetness, but is not syrupy in the least. This beer is of the quality of DFH 90 min, but bigger. I loved the cascade hop dominated taste, because it was so balanced. I could truly drink this beer all night (scary thought).","bignick","Mar 30, 2006"
4.63,13.8,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Southern Tier has a good thing going with their new series. Its just smart marketing in my opinion. The 22oz bottles make for a good sit down session at home. I LOVE that they list the specific hops, malts and grains they use. Now that Im a home brewer, I can actually visualize what went into the beer I am drinking. Itll also come in handy when I try to make a clone of this one!","dem","Mar 28, 2006"
4.38,7.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2""" beige head over the clear deep copper brew. Head lasts well for the style, and lacing is prevalent. Aroma is fruity hops, with some pine underneath, not as intense as I had expected. Flavor makes up for the any lack in the nose, hops are front and center. Lupalin slam in the teeth, then mellows down a bit and you can feel the malt and alcohol warming everything it touches. Mouthfeel is impressive for something so hoppy, and drinkability works as well. Nice job with one.","ppoitras","Mar 27, 2006"
4.35,6.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Taste is of...suprise!...HOPS! Starts with a mild bitterness courtesy of the chinook and cascades that is lifted by the decent amount of carbonation. Tough to detect the malt here, but I'm sure it's there helping to balance this one out. For 11%abv, amazingly you cannot detect the alcohol, which brings up the drinkability considerably. This is easily the best double IPA I've ever had, and will give me a great scale to judge others by. Highly recommended.","bkett01","Mar 26, 2006"
4.42,8.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"M & D: Both are great. Slick in your mouth with an almost oily feel upfront that leaves pretty quickly. Carbonation at first but also fades fast leaving you with a nice floral aftertaste. Well balanced dipa. Not much bitterness to this one, but an awesome offering from Southern Tier--my favorite from them so far.","bjohnson","Mar 24, 2006"
4.45,9.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear copper, with traces of carbonation rising to a soapy ecru froth, which is not too big since I poured it into a fluted glass as per the bottle's instruction. Aroma is piney, piney, piney! Subsequent sniffs reveal a sugary candied citrus peel scent, but man is this one about the hops and nothing else! The taste, fortunately, does not follow the nose. I say fortunately, because that aroma led me to expect something obscenely over-the-top pine juice phenomenon. Instead I get a much more subdued and subtle citrusy pine flavor with a sweet caramel malt follow-through. I do think there are some reasonable limits as to the outrageousness of the hops in a DIPA, and hence, I believe that a certain """balance""" is feasible and appropriate to expect. Southern Tier achieves such balance with Unearthly. As it warms, more malt emerges, and the flavors become rounder, softer, and fuller. Something of a mineral twinge at the finish. Hop bitterness lingers. Lacing is webby, but head retention is minimal -- 11% abv will do that to a beer, I suppose. Medium bodied and juicy. Not my favorite DIPA -- meaning there are others I'd pick up instead on a more regular basis --, but this is absolutely stunning as a foray into """Big Beer""" territory.","orfeu","Mar 06, 2006"
4.5,10.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a solid malt bill that boasts of pale and carapils malts along with a wonderful hop aroma. It's intensely bitter, but equally stong in malts giving it a warm and balanced scent. The taste is great as well. It has a rich malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes warm and satisfying. The hops are true all the way through and add a kick ass bitter bite which helps hide the elevated abv.. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer that is quite drinkable even with an 11% abv.. It's just another fine offering from Southern Tier.","WesWes","Mar 04, 2006"
4.5,10.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, this is a great double IPA. One of the better hop bombs that I have had.","Naes","Mar 03, 2006"
4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"22oz bomber. Deep, crystal clear filtered amber. The head rises to 2/3""" or so before settling to a steady layer leaving intricate lace. Hop notes immediately pull you in for an intense piney and perfumey assault on the senses. A sturdy multi-grain character balances with some bready notes in the nose. Floral and perfumey hops once again are predominate in the taste followed by piney and citrus elements. The caramel sweetness lent to the brew by the hefty grains is countered nicely by a reassuring warming by the alcohol. This brew is quite comfortable subbing for a fine cognac with it's intense aromatics and warming effect. I'm kickin back like the ladies man Leon Phelps with this bad boy. But there it goes again petitioning me to drink again...and again...I of course oblige, possessing little restraint. The body however welcomes consumption in this manner as it is moderate/medium sans the syrupy thick mouthfeel of other similar brews. It seems to shift at will from satisfying big ass sippin' IIPA, to a very drinkable but potent brew concealing the 11% abv quite well. Cheers to Southern Tier for a fine brew.","John","Feb 26, 2006"
