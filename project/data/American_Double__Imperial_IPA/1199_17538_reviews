"O: The hops are big in this beer but it has the alcohol and the malt to balance things out."

"I died a little. One's a plenty, I have 3 more."
""
"Kinda like a super hoppy barley wine you can taste the 112 Ibus but its perfectly matched by the absurd amounts of malt"
""
""
"Overall:  Been wanting to try this for a while so I was fine with buying last years.  Given the strength, I didn't expect much to fall off.  Feels like a hefty, boozy, syrupy barley wine than anything.  I'll still seek out a fresh bottle this year, but I think this doesn't age as gracefully as 120 minute does.  I'm expecting I would prefer this fresh since any hop notes in this 10 month bottle are subdued by everything else."

""
""
""
""
""
"O- Just not my thing, but it's not terrible. There are multiple triple IPAs that I like better, but this isn't a bad beer."
""
""
"Reminds me of DFH 120, but hoppier. Its got a kick!  Overpriced, but you only live once.  Founders is an exceptional Brewery...all their brews are dee-licious."
""
""
""
"Much love for founders but this is just a hot malty mess."
"A very very very good triple IPA! Let it cellar a few weeks."
""
""
""
"Going out of my dining-out comfort zone with this one,  Founders Devil's Dance Triple IPA clocks in at a hearty 12% APV, making this my kind of beer!  With a fairly mild malt aroma and bitterness out of this world, it leaves a carmel aftertaste that was more than what I expected. This does result in the usual IPA hoppiness being overrun by the malts. Slightly silky mouthfeel but no sticky residual. Went well with the calamari I ordered as an appetizer and even better with the rack of lamb."
"O:  About 7 months old, but still delicious in the form of an American Barleywine.  If it's anything like fresh Double Trouble, then I want some."
"This one was a drain pour. Tastes like medicine"
""
""
"Great taste for a triple IPA. Brought two..gonna open one a year later..wish me luck"
""
""
""
"Glass- Perfect Pint"
""
"Overall: Awesome Triple IPA. I like this more than the Double Trouble. Seems like I am in a minority."
""
""
"Very good Ipa and enjoyable!"
""
""
""
"O:  This is a pretty big beer with a lot of complexity and it will be interesting to see how it changes as it ages.  I wish I could have gotten to this beer when it was fresher but there is still a lot of hop flavor in this beer.  the front end seems to have faded the most but the swallow is amazing."
""
"V - Quite expensive at almost 20 dollars a four pack."
""
""
""
""
"Wow!  Great mix, thick malty hoppy sweet goodness. Fantastic experience from first sniff to last drop. Hides the ABV well. My favorite beer to date."
""
""
""
"Very good overall brew. The ABV is hidden very well. Really enjoyed this brew."
"It sure hides that 112 well."
""
"Wow. Bought this because i found a single for 7 bucks, not about to pay 25 bucks for 4 of these. That said, this is one of the best TRIPA's i've ever had. Couldn't drink more than one for sure, but what a treat. If you can find a single pick it up. I wouldn't want to sit on something like this, so be ready to drink it."
""
""
"Way too boozy for my taste."
""
"The one I tried was in the bottle about 6 months.. I would have liked to try a really fresh one!  To me it was really malty. I did taste the hops but this beer is super sweet. And not something you was to session at 12% ABV it's more of a once in a while treat if you like super high ABV malty beers."
""
""
"A strong, malty, hoppy red dipa. I will look for this one whenever i can. Awesome."
""
""
""
"	At any rate this looks incredible. There’s a malty amber, slightly reddish-caramel hue to it that’s inviting and mysterious. Hops have faded, leaving some notes of a candied orange peel and straw lingering around. The flavor has a surprisingly rounded bitterness that hits midpalate with a drying finish and just enough malt to give it some definition without feeling heavy. So: do I wish I had this fresh? Yes, of course. But am I disappointed that the only taste I have of it is one from a bottle half a year old? Not in the least."
" If you love hops this is the beer for you! If you like a good buzz, this is the one for you! I had just one and as I'm typing this I notice that I'm almost smashed!! Another good brew from Founders!"

"Intense. Taste of explosive malts and hops attack your palate aggressively. Very long bitterness. Not my kind of booze but drinkable."

"Ok, I understand this is not your every day IIPA.  If you're looking for an Enjoy By clone, walk on by.  This is a TRIPLE IPA, which I believe is deserving of it's own category.  The malt bill is heavy duty, the hops in equal proportion.  Beers of this ilk, cross the bridge between American Barleywine and DIPA, and that's exactly where you will find Devil Dancer.  Fruity, tangy, cirtrusy hoppy, malty....yes you've got all of theseys.   Oops, I'm stuck.  Not a hint of alcohol while weighing in at 12% ABV with 112 IBUs.  This beer is an EXPERIENCE, not just another DIPA.  Next year, when you buy your four pack, drink two and let another two sit for 4-5 months.  You'll be rewarded I can assure you...."

"SUPER/MEGA bitter, I mean bruisingly over the top. Some may enjoy that. Founders is possibly my favorite brewery. It's just the style is so extreme and aggressive that I can't bring myself to enjoy it. The 'Look' however, is absolutely beautiful~"
""
""
""
"Sticky mess with little hop differentiation and aroma"
""
"O – Very much a hop bomb, and that was the intention.  That said, it’s a bit thin and a bit unbalanced for my tastes.  Good, but not great."

"Copper red. Some head from the pour, fizzling down to a slight ring around the glass. Smells more of caramel malt than anything else. Some hops presence in the nose but nothing typical of the major hop bombs on the market. More caramel in the taste. Some citrus hop in the finish but it really competes with the malt body and fails. Tastes more like an imperial Amber or red than anything. A slight alcohol bite can be noticed in the finish as well. Rich mouthfell. This is a big beer and the malt body lIves up to that. Overall this is pretty good but not as an IPA. Maybe an imperial hoppy Amber ale. Is that a thing?"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a copper orange with a medium tan head. Aroma is of floral hops, grapefruit, citrus and caramelized malt notes. Taste is floral hops, citrus and grapefruit flavors with sweet caramel malt, has a bit of toffee notes as well as it warms up. Palate is a medium full body, a smooth mouth feel and good carbonation. Finishes with a sweet caramel malt toffee flavor followed by floral, citrus and grapefruit notes. The ending is somewhat sweet dry bitterness with a bit of toffee on the end for balance Seems slightly on the bitter side, alcohol seems well hidden but hits you in the end. Overall a good flavorful and good drinking brew."

"Overall (7/10) - This is a great beer and even after three months I'd expect to get some more hopiness out of this one.  The orange marmalade flavor is very memorable and the dangerously easy way this drinks is even more memorable.  I will try to grab one next summer and taste a little fresher to see if my opinions change."

"Poured a rich, semi-cloudy amber body with no head, but a thin ring of off-white lace. Quite nice looking, like a good Barleywine. Scents of rich, sweet malt with notes of caramel, brown sugar and molasses, strong fruity esters reminiscent of overripe stone fruit, moderate-high scents of alcohol, and an underlying hop aroma with notes of pine, indeterminate citrus and faint tropical fruit. Overall impression is of an aroma that is far more weighed towards the malty sweet and boozy end of the scale than the hop side. It reminds one of a strong English Barleywine. Quite pleasant. Flavor begins strongly sweet with notes of caramel, overripe fruit and a bit of alcohol balanced by faint hop bitterness. This moves into a still sweet middle with notes of caramel, rum-soaked fruit, medium levels of bitter hops and alcohol. Finish is still sweet, with notes of caramel, brown sugar, rum-soaked fruit, a bit of indeterminate citrus peel and flesh, alcohol and a still medium level of bitter hops. Aftertaste is semi-dry with notes of bitter, piney hops, dried apricot, toasted malt and alcohol warmth. Overall impression is of a rich, malty profile, balanced by alcohol warmth and a nice level of hops that shine on the aftertaste. Very much a Barleywine is impression and quite the good one. Mouthfeel is full bodied, with moderate-low carbonation and a sticky, chewy mouthfeel with a slight alcohol warmth. Overall impression is of a classic Barleywine mouthfeel that is warming and pleasant. Overall this is a nice Barleywine. It shines in aroma and flavor, and is aided by its mouthfeel. It hits the style quite well and trends more towards the malty sweet variety. Hops and alcohol keep it from becoming cloying, which helps the overall impression of the beer. Quite nice and highly recommended."

"1 Year, 3 month vintage: The appearance is much murkier and hazier in appearance with a similar styled head and retention. The alcohol profile is much more forward, grainy and boozy with a muted peppery and herbal hop profile. The flavor is similar, although much of the edgier hop profile has faded and a slightly fruitier and herbal hop profile remains, it doesn't remedy the booziness that has been revealed within this beer by time. The texture is slightly less clean, mildly chewy and peppery. Alcohol presence is moderate, and murky grain is amongst the many imperfections this beer has. Miles away a less favorable beer than the fresh vintage, nearly a drainpour! Drink as fresh as possible!"

"Had it about 2.5 months after it was bottled. Good beer. Very hoppy and strong. Not as carbonated as other really hoppy beers, but very smooth. Not as bitter as I expected."

"Overall: Interesting drink. Sweet then tart. Explosion of hop bitterness nice sipper that punches you in the face with hops and also balances it with quite a bit of malt. Another great Founders brew. A different, full flavored beer but not a style that I will repeat."

"DATE REVIEWED: August 2, 2014... GLASSWARE: Hoppopotamus pint... OCCASION: laughing and analyzing with Ryan , Jer, Shan and cousin Cheri...APPEARANCE: dark brown, iced tea-like body; off-white,, pencil-thin moustache-like head; could not expect much more, given the alcohol content... AROMA: tight, punchy hops; pine resin and some doughy malts; a bit of a brown ale too...then subtly scotch and bourbon in its end and warmth... PALATE: full, warm and rather flat; as the glass drains, it evens out and fills pleasantly... TASTE: sour lemon and smoky warm hops; coal and port elements; some cognac too--a complex experience, with the bourbon power invading; strong and shouldering.... OVERALL: a big beer to experience, and at 12% ABV, intriguing...however, at $19.99 a four-pack, NOT worth the experience--a nuance that does not deserve its price tag...still an experience to have...."

"O- Good beer. A lot different than I expected. I thought it would be just a hop bomb, but it is in my opinion a well balanced beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

"O- It's a big booze bomb. For me, that suppresses the flavor and the effects of the hops. Oh, well."

"This tripple goes down smooth but packs a punch. The appearance is amber with a ruby tint, the smell reminds of chemicals and cardboard. Taste has notes of caramel, hops, alcohol, some more alcohol, full malty sweet body. THe mouth-feel is a little weak as the growler has set for over 96 hours since original opening. I am not dissapointed in this beer, but would not go out of my way for another."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - At 12% ABV, this one is quite boozy and goes right to the head, so be careful with it! If you're used to the bright, bitter, flowery kinds of IPA's, I definitely recommend you seek this one out to get a taste of the dank side."

"Value: horrible"

"Interesting, expected something stronger.  Not necessarily a bad thing.  Robust without over powering hoppines.  Malty start is as vibrant as some of the great imperial IPAs out there.  Though enjoyable, I preferred the back woods bastard from founders. Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
"A sipping DIPA with a crazy amount of malt and surprisingly enough hops to balance, though it doesn't particularly excel in that department. I was fearing the size of the beer but it is drinkable in its own way."
""
""
"The color and smell of the beer is great. It has a nice caramel color and a sweet hoppy smell. At 12% the alcohol content is a little high for my liking, but its a nice beer to sip on for a lazy cool afternoon. To me this is more of a fall beer to drink at night."

"My first Founders!!! Can't get it where I live in CO. So when I saw this triple IPA on the East coast I had to try it. Big IPA fan but didn't expect the barley wine quality. Beautiful red color. Very intriguing smell. As for the taste the malty base hit first. Bready, some citrus, strawberry sweet maybe. Took a while to figure this one out. The mouthfeel is what was disappointing. I would have enjoyed this much more if there was more carbonation. No way I could sense the 125 IBUs I was expecting. Overall I enjoyed the beer but I felt like I should have bought the double trouble for my first Founders IPA experience."

"Thank you Roguer for the chance to try this beer."
"Pours dark for an India Pale! This got me excited. Then the smell got me excited - smells like some of the best IPAs I've had... Pliny, Double Jack... this one's up there. The taste meets and/or exceeds expectations. Maybe a little on the sweeter side, but if that were adjusted more to my taste she'd be getting a perfect 5. Can't be just handing those out to anyone. Still can't believe this beer doesn't score higher. Very creamy mouthfeel with a tickling carb. Awesome brew. Try it if you get the chance."

"A vigorous pour got only a modest head on this dark mahogany beer. The nose is excellent, though, very heady, with a rich, complex maltiness and a flowering of grassy, citrusy hops. Flavor is big as well, with caramel, toffee malt notes, a ripe fruitiness, and, of course, high bitterness and lots of hop flavor. The malt really makes it, I think. Despite the very high strength, there's little alcoholic burn, though it's definitely a warming beer. Body is substantial without being overly heavy. Very good beer. Good sipping beer."

" I've had many DIPAs and even a couple that claim to be """Triple IPAs," and this doesn't stand up to most. Throwing as much barley and hops as humanly possible into a kettle doesn't make a good beer. The flavors are overwhelming, and not in a good way. More of a ridiculously overhopped barley wine than anything else."

"Has a fizzy, tan head that just isn't into it. Color is dark brown. Has a deep caramel and subtle piny hop aroma. Tastes like a slab of caramel candy has been melted and poured into your mouth, followed by more caramel mixed with hops, then some grain, persimmon, and a little spice in the distance. A sweet and hot mess that isn't bad for what it is, but living proof there can be too much of a good thing."
""
""
""
""
"O: I apologize if the brewers responsible for this actually read this review, but... what happened here? The label looks like a Metallica cover (not one of the good ones), the triple-quantity hops are muffled by malt, and I get outright sweetness here and there. I like the flavor and would gladly drink another, but this is so far from the intended style that I'm kind of chuckling about it. Again, I love the completely unassuming 12%, you deserve a standing ovation for that, but next time could I get some hops with my malt?"

"O: Really good. My first ‘Triple IPA.” I know its not considered an independent style on Beer Advocate, and I see why after trying this. Its like a double IPA, only jacked up. Its really like a double though, just thicker in body and substance. I think your tongue can’t take any more in, so it levels off."
""
"Overall: Not really an IPA, more of an IPA/Barleywine hybrid. The cough syrup aftertaste is a little off putting. Overall, worth a try if you can find it on tap!"
""
"Disappointing compared to the 2013 bottling."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A lot of hop bitterness going on, even for a 2 year old beer. The booze is very well hidden and although this is a bit of an extreme beer; it is actually very drinkable. A beer worth trying at least once for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not quite what I was expecting, but not surprising at all... instead of cramming in 10 hop varieties, try dialing it back to 4-5 max and take a time learning how to stack them neatly and in some kind of legible sequence... really, this comes across as a bitter-ass barleywine, no question... hey, if that's what your into..."
""
""
""
"Being new to IPA's this one really did get me hooked. After having others and coming back to it, it was not a let down by any means. The Colorado was beautiful,but Colorado doesn't mask the smell of alcohol,or stop it from burning your tongue. Overall,I enjoyed every sip"
"O - Glad I tried it. Took the edge off a long day. Pricey (6 a 12 oz bottle), but certainly worth a try, especially if you are looking for a barleywine-esque experience."

"Pours a dark, slightly cloudy amber with a minimal off-white head that disappears quickly. Aroma of caramel, malt, leather and a bit of red fruit. The nose is perfectly indicative of the taste. Really boozy, as there's no attempt to hide the alcohol. The one thing that is hidden are the 112 IBUs, as there's just a slight touch of bitterness. Medium-heavy mouth that coats the tongue with caramel malt sweetness. If you're expecting a West Coast IPA, you won't find it here. There are plenty of those around. This malt bomb is pretty darn good, and only gets better as it warms. I'm glad I went ahead and bought the four-pack."

"The beer pours an off white head that dissipates quickly and does not leave much lacing. The beer itself is a dark ruby color that borders on purple. The beer smell is fruity sweet with a floral hop aroma that is overcome by the sweetness. The beer also has a teeny tiny booze smell that is easily overcome. Otherwise, it's hops and fruity sweetness. The beer taste has a strong fruity malt sweetness with a complex hop taste. The hops range from a strong pine but the combined notes come off as a strong strawberry with a hint of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with biting carbonation. The beer itself is a bit thick but still smooth. Overall, a fairly unique TIPA that deserves some attention."
"O - Worth trying again this year. Aged one last year for 6 months and it was fantastic."

"O - An excellent triple IPA, the malt is forward, with hops making the accents rather than the core. The price point is such that while I enjoyed it, I'm unlikely to seek this out regularly, but it was good to give it a try."

"Pours a deep, slightly hazy, mahogany with minimal head. A slight bit hangs on around the circumference of the tulip glass. The aroma is interesting, with a combination of pine and floral hops and sweet malt notes. The taste has great depth, mirroring closely the aroma with just a hint of alcohol. It has a nice weight to the body. This is a very good-to-great Imperial IPA."

"12oz bottle: This one pours a fairly clear reddish-amber color. There was a very thin off-white head on it that didn’t leave any lacing. It has an interesting nose. Definitely piney, but a woody aroma to go with it. Smells like a lot of malts trying to peak out from under the pine. Nice taste! It has a pretty good hop bite to it, but a huge underlying amount of malts there too. A bit of malt sweetness coming thru. Seems to be more of a hoppy barleywine than anything else. Very good. Wish I had bought another to check in a couple of years."

"Rapey label, """triple ipa!!"""... pours a clear orange tinted ruby with thin cream colored head... thin ring, nothing on the glass. Smell: caramel, fruity... pineapple, apricot, citrus peel. Taste: caramel, stone fruit note, dried citrus, pinesol, dried tropical fruit note, lots of bitterness.. I wouldn't label this a barleywine, this clearly seems to be pushing for an over the top DIPA, which it reaches, but not otherwise special."

"Triple IPA, hmm. I have had several DIPA's lately that blow the socks of this one. Founders claim that its over 200 IBU's and I know that doesn't have to mean super hoppiness, I honestly felt this was more like a hoppy barleywine or strong ale than an IPA. It was sweet, way more sweet than I was expecting it to be. I have tried several beers lately from Founders and honestly I have not been impressed. For a national distribution from the state of Michigan Bell's has this brewery beat hands down, at least the ones I have tried. This has too much alcohol to be enjoyed alone, you drink one, its not all that tasty and then you basically have to stop for the evening unless you want to get totally intoxicated. That takes away from the enjoyment experience of beer to me. Also, this beer is ridiculously expensive like $24 for a four pack. I understand the alcohol content is part of this but I will never do it again."

"As a huge Founders fan, it is with great disappointment but I submit this review... It looks beautiful -almost a strawberry red in color. But then you take a sip and realize that this beer is basically terrible. It tastes and feels like a decent IPA at first, but quickly transitions to a subpar IPA with a few shots of vodka added. I love a good strong beer, but I don't like getting alcohol face after taking a sip! I will continue to enjoy every other Founders offering, but will surely stay away from this one in the future."

"Pours a nice reddish amber with a small head. First smell is very piney. Very strong pine scent. Taste is pretty good and the first thought is that I'm drinking a bourbon mixed with beer. The alcohol at 12% is fairly noticeable and obviously very strong. A decent beer. Not sure if it's worth $5/bottle."

"O- This is really a barleywine, not an IPA. With that in mind it is a pretty good barleywine. Really love the color, nice sweet malts, and the hops are great for an American version of an English barleywine. My one major gripe is with the price, 20 bucks for a 4-pack is a bit much for a beer that does't taste that much different than Bigfoot, which I think is actually noticeably more hoppy. I can imagine a barrel aged version of this would be great."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy dark amber color with decent head. Nose is boozy, some tea notes, candied aromas, and earthy floral. Palate offers a whollop of hops and malt, plenty of bitterness, but is actually quite drinkable for the IBU and ABV. Boozy, yes, but still drinkable somehow. Worth trying as a novelty, even if someone isn't a regular consumer for the style range."
""
""
""
"Poured in to a glass from a bottle. Head was nonexistent. Not an awful beer, but definitely not what I have come to expect from Founders and definitely not justifiably $20 for a four pack. For my palate I taste more alcohol than flavor. Now that I've had it I'd doubtfully buy it again."
""
""

"O - Payed 20 for a 4 pack so I'm rather disappointed since it's my first triple IPA, I can think of a ton of DIPAs and IIPAs much cheaper and way more enjoyable. Founder can do better"
""
""
"O- I keep making comparisons to Brown Shugga with this beer, particularly in the aroma, but I like it better than Brown Shugga for sure. I just wish it wasn't quite so boozy. I'm really curious to see how this develops in the bottle after a few months. I know that Brown Shugga doesn't really improve with age but I have higher hopes for this since it's not quite as sweet and the ABV is higher. I might change my score after having an aged bottle."
""

""

"Overall, a beer that is interesting and unique, but I can never bring myself to buy a four-pack because about one per season is plenty. It's just too over-the-top with hops and is a bit of a jumbled mess. I like it, but only in extreme moderation (oxymoron, I know). Founders can almost do no wrong in my book, but this particular beer is not one of my favorites."

"This is definitely a big beer worth trying. Actually, I'd like to have this regularly but I am afraid the alcohol content is not healthy. This stuff is strong!"

"O - My first so-called """triple IPA," I give the beer an outstanding because I am a fan of American Strong Ales and I think this is an interesting example that completely drys out (and wrecks) the palate on the finish. Lives up to the other tasty heavy beers that I've had from this brewery"

"Bottled 5/20/14. Deep amber in color. Aroma is amazing. Predominately ripened pineapples and candied oranges mixed with some caramel and alcohol soaked hops. Taste is immediately astringent bitterness mixed with alcohol. A pungent hop flavor blend of pine and citrus make an appearance before a strong alcohol burn takes over again on the finish. A brown sugar sweetness is there to complement. Not a real pleasant drinking beer, but at the same time not bad. I feel like aging could help. Just a whole lot going on.. almost could call this a hot boozy mess. As flavorful of a beer as I've had in a while. Full bodied with lots of bitter and heat. A hop-head/booze lover's delight. Glad I got the four pack. Giving one away as a gift and the other 2 will probably be aged for a year+. I'd recommend to those who have never tried this beer."

"O. I like it more than I remember when I first tried it 2 years ago. Back then, it was an onion bomb. Now, it has quite a bit more balance, almost like a super amped up Nugget Nectar. Reminds me quite a bit of a strong amber, with a prominent caramel malt creaminess to combat the super aggressive hops. And boy are they aggressive. These aren't your tropical, fruity hops. These are tongue blistering, dank weed, slightly oniony, herbs in the garden hops. And they're pretty darn tasty at that. A hop beast through and through, Devil Dancer dances its way across the palate leaving a searing trail in its wake."

"This is an incredibly intense beer! Pours a deep amber red with a thin head. This beer blasts you in the face with alcohol and caramel. This thing is incredibly friggin thick, bitter and resinous. Dark fruits, plums, raisins, figs and syrupy sweetness mix with hoppy bitterness to create a unique beer experience. I can understand how this isn't for everyone but it sure as hell is for me!"

"Overall: Not pleased. Not terrible, but definitely not as good as I hoped. It had some hints of some good flavors but nothing quite stepped forward to push the alcohol into the back seat. Would I try it again? Yes, maybe it was just a bad night lol."
"Overall, I would recommend tracking this down, because it truly is it's own animal and unique among things like Barleywines, Palate Wreckers, and 120 Minute IPAs. Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moon light?"

"Brown pour with a 2 finger head that laces well. Nose is slight, but of malt, alcohol and hops. The taste is complex. The malt serves as a backbone to aggressive hoping, which is amazingly balanced in terms of flavor and bitterness against a 12% alcohol content. Full bodied, which is rare in an IPA. It finishes balanced as well, with hop flavor and malt as the base with a lingering bitterness and alcohol note. This is a well crafted beer, especially considering the IBUs and alcohol content, but it takes those factors to extremes."

"Honestly, this isn't that great. It's surprisingly sweet and abrasively bitter. This is one of those biers that is bitter, but not really hoppy. It's also sweet, but not really malty. I like hops, and I like malt. But this is just the worst aspects of hops and malt. Then the booze is very noticeable. This isn't as refined as I expect from Founders; it's a bit crass. I don't want to finish this. I was hoping for something a la """Revelry""" by Two Brothers, but this was a bust."

"I was overwhelmed - in not such a good way - by my first two bottles of this. Just seemed excessively bitter and almost - to this hop head - undrinkable. I had to force it down. But I learned to really appreciate it once the shock wore off. The hoppiness is not just bitter but rather complex, especially if you let it warm. And the high alcohol content is nicely masked. If this were priced reasonably, I'd buy up a bunch whenever it comes out. But at $20+/4-pack this outstanding beer is just not worth it. But offer me one at your house, and I jump at it."

"Pretty solid double IPA, really more like an American Barleywine. Good flavor and balance, quite enjoyable, and while it feels strong, it doesn't feel as strong as it is. Worth trying for sure, though there are better ABWs and DIPAs out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's hard to review as a IPA,DIPA or a Belgium triple.. not really what I was expecting and it certainly is a beer that hits hard... and that's not always a bad thing, but it's a fine line between making a triple style beer that is very strong, or a very triple hoppy beer, as I think the large amount of malts and thick body kill the hops a bit even as much as they tried to compensatre for it... an interesting beer for sure and worth trying... not your typical refreshing ipa, and more of something you can drink in the winter when you want a more hoppy alternative to a stout or barleywine."

"Full thick body with a huge malt bill, caramel burnt brown sugar followed by massive hop presence and bitterness. Oddly no taste a booze but again a little soapy, bitterness is high but the malt lingers around with the hops nicely. A good beer I prefer double trouble though."

"until I had the Molotov cocktail from evil twin, I was not sure an American ipa could get any bigger. this thing is colossal. it pours a yeasty thick burning orange honey color with a foamy white head that relaxes with time. it smells like dense hop oil, dank and west coast, but more complex than the generic version of that, with some citrus, some residual sugar sweetness, and a malt body that exceeds the double ipa style norm. long bitterness dominates a finish otherwise crowded out by alcohol and a hoppy extract that seems somewhere beyond necessary. balance doesn't matter here, as this beer is all pedals to the floor. hops are not unique but they are strong, and the alcohol is overbearing with the provocative carbonation. a pint of this could kill a man, and im not ready to die..."
""
""
""
"O - It is incredible what Founders accomplishes with this brew - drinks as smooth as an every day IPA, yet knocks you on your can before you can think about it. A sipper at the least or a nice way to close out a Saturday night and a day of watching football with a body buzzing bomb."

"Overall - Okay, I'm very glad to have tried this beer, but am not sure I would seek it out again, especially since I have 4 of them (actually gave a good friend of mine one to try). I find this far more interesting than I do tasty. For such a powerful and potent beer it really does have nice complexity, although balance is out the window - as it goes from syrupy sweet to almost cloyingly bitter. And the alcohol is far from hidden. In fact, you need to drink this one on the colder side, as the alcohol rises exponentially with beer temp. I would recommend pouring half the bottle into a glass, then returning the bottle to the fridge until you finish. Bottom Line - try this for sure, at least so you can say that you did - BUT, if you are like me, you will realize that there are FAR BETTER DIPA's that are readily available and much less expensive that your $$$ are better spent on. If you want to """repeat""" this more often, and less expensively, Double Dog should somewhat fill the bill until next summer ;o)"

"Pours red-gold with almost no head. Smells like apricot and citrus. Taste is bitter biscuit with some orange rind. Nice chewy mouthfeel and the alcohol is very well-masked. This is a nice beer but it is way too expensive at $6.50 for a 12 ounce bottle."

"D- Very bitter and boozy. very bold and agressive beer overall for the hoppiest of hopheads! Would definitely get again! I'm going to age one for a year or so and see how that affects the hop/malt flavors."
""
""
"Pours a nice rich copper color into a pint glass, very little head at the top. Aroma of pine with sweet caramel malt, and big hops. Has a very hoppy taste with a huge bite. I can taste the alcohol, but it's not too overwhelming. It's very balanced considering the percentage and it definitely doesn't taste boozy at all. Very enjoyable and gives a nice warming feeling. Tastes more like a winter beer"
""
"O - Worth a try but I might be one-and-done with this one because of the price and availablility. Crossed into the realm of a barleywine, but still had a lot of good aspects. Not really sure what style this is."

""
""
""

"O - This style is always are hard one to produce, but I feel there is more bitterness from the alcohol than the hops. You do get a high level of hops in the finish, but you never get that roof of the mouth IPA bitterness only on the tongue towards the end. I was hoping for more hops personally, but this is a very well constructed and executed Triple IPA."

"Overall-this is a very interesting brew, I figure its a lot closer to the barley-wine than a IIPA. Those styles have always been close in my mind, especially the stronger IIPA's. this is one your gonna want to take slowly, let it warm up a develop a little. At its price point, which is high, you be stupid to rush. 4"

"This is a very good triple ipa to try if you have not already done so. Very nive copper color. Loads of hoppy flavor. Extremely hoppy with a strong flavor of sweet malts, a bit of caramel and citrus with a hint of butterscotch. If you like hoppy beers, try this one."
"I'm glad I tried this one, but not sure if I would go out of my way for it again. I'm glad founders does this as a 12oz 4-pack. It is pricey, but not much more than your average DIPA in a 22oz bomber."
""
""
""
""
"O - The nose is underwhelming, but the taste is pretty nice. There are some underlying notes I like that I wish were accentuated a bit more, but the alcohol and malts are overwhelming. However, I really like the bitter, herbal notes."
"Taste is definitely more balanced than what is supposed to be a """Triple IPA", the mixture of malt and citrus hops seem to be battling each other for dominance although there is quite the bittering effect in the aftertaste, bit of a spicy rye character that was not expected, carbonation is medium-low with a fairly sticky mouthfeel, overall too much is going on with this beer to be effective."
""
""
"Atmosphere is really good. Dark hue, nice foamy head, and some fair lacing. Nose is full malt with some sweet and pine tones and a woody or earthy tinge. Thick and syrupy pine resin, butterscotch, unsweetened chocolate, and citrus pith. Overall, this is a great quaff."
""
""
"Surprised to enjoy this more than Doom. Almost a rye-like character. Sweet and malty with a complex hop blend that leaves you going back to the glass to pick out the distinctions. This is a big beer with an appreciable complexity. Great way to celebrate IPA day."

"This beer was ok. I was hoping for much more. It poured dark yellow with a lighter head. The beer had a descent smell and taste. It had thick texture to it. The taste is bold. This beer is also too expensive. I have seen them go for as much as five dollars a beer."
""
""
"This beer hides is 12% decently. It’s a very aggressive and big beer, but also balanced. The sweetness is not too much, nor do the hops get offensive. Beers like Hercules DIPA or Maharaja push this style, as well as the American Barleywines. Having those in mind, this beer does the “bigger than Double IPA” style really well."

"O: This is a beast. Huge flavors and booze to match. It hits hard but is enticingly delicious. This is hands down one of my favorite hardcore IPA's."

"O - The malt bill reminds me of souped-up Southern Tier Unearthly. The big sweetness here just doesn't fit, the hops are decent but this is just a bit too abrasive to really enjoy too much. That being said, certainly not the worst."

Not too sure what the difference between a triple IPA and a really strong DIPA, but this is very well balanced, has enough hops to satisfy a hop head but not overwhelming bitterness like a Ruinten or Ruination, and has great floral citric flavors to match. Well done Founders, I waited long enough to try this and am thoroughly impressed."
""
"O - Devil Dancer is a big beer boozy beer. I only need one a year. For fans of big hoppy beers this is definetly recommended."
""
"O: Wow - a big beer... Pretty noticeable alcohol in the aroma and taste, especially as things warm up. Hops are big time, but the malt isn't entirely lost... This kind of reminds me more of a super-hopped barleywine, especially with the feel. Glad I tried this!"

"Poured into snifter; translucent deep orange with a fluffy white head that stays as a disc of foam and leaves delicate lacing. Smell is boozy and sweet, with lots of sweet tropical fruit. Pineapple and mango, banana even, as well as some darker fig-like scents. Some spicy almost rye-like notes in the nose as well. Taste is HUGE; sweet fermented fruit awash in boozy sweet almost bourbon-like alcohol, with an insanely bitter finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. My memory of 120min is a bit fuzzy, but this might surpass it as the best extreme DIPA I've had."
""
""
""
"(O) This big beer is more drinkable than one might think and is quite unique. This so-called triple IPA actually reminds me of a barley wine. It may not be what you’d expect, but it’s worth a try if you can find it. Keep in mind that it’s a seasonal offering, so be sure to mark your calendars for early summer."
""
""
""
"This pours a clear, light brown color with almost no head. The aroma is rich with hops. The taste is bold, bitter, yet still a little sweet with lots of citrus hints. I completely agree with their description of “Dangerously drinkable and deliciously evil.” Lots of hops and lots of bitterness. One of the best made IPAs I’ve ever had."

"Stoked to be able to try this, thanks Max! Darker color for an IPA, but looks great. Good lacing, small head. Nose is floral but hints at the malt presence to come. And malt there is, malt for days. Reminds me of double jack, if double jack had about twice the amount of heat and four times as much hop presence. This beer definitely builds as you go, and I'm not certain if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I'm on the fence with this one. Good, but needs a bit of work. I don't think I can categorize this like I would other triple IPA's that I've had like younger or notorious because of the huge caramel malt body which overshadows the hop action, but I like it just the same."
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a rich, vibrant, dark caramel coloring with a thin, frothy, off-white head that starts as a low profile coat and settles into a ring on the surface. Aromas are robust, and very rich in caramel malts, smoky and roasted. Tropical fruit sweetness blends with a spiced and bitter hops character, giving an overall tangy, rich nose. Flavors are bold and robust. Holy shit, this one's got some body. Wow, this is a rich, smooth, thick brew in mouth. Roasted caramel backbone, with a blast of pepper and resiny hops, with a bitterness that is relentless, and builds as you drink. Pine pitch throughout, along with mango, pineapple, and grapefruit sweetness. The malt profile is profound, and continues to pack a punch with every sip. The spices build as you drink, and combined with the ABV, you are left with a nice warmth. Tangy, rich sweetness and spiced, resiny bitterness in the aftertaste. This beer stays with you long after each sip, and it is a sipper. This beer is a beast, and leans a bit towards the malt-bomb side, but with some very clear bitterness and heat."

"Founders Devil Dancer ---3.5/5"
"O: worth a try but the alcohol overpowers the hops. A bit boozy for my liking, not enough of a beer backbone for me."
""
""
""
"Had a bottle (from my son for my birthday) and...WOW. Though the ABV is super high, it could not overpower the extreme delicious maltiness of this beauty. The hop finish was intense as well, but due to the tremendous malty beauty that this beer delivers in droves, the balance was awesome. Intense all the way around, it was definitely a party in the mouth experience, and one of my favorite beers ever. Thank you Founders, I look forward to sampling this beauty at your brewpub. Cheers :)"

"Overall, I can reccommend trying this beer, though personally I doubt I will be out getting a 4-pack of it every week. It is a strange beer, taste-wise, but I'm certainly up for trying some other breweries offerings for comparison."

"Overall, a strange, strange beer. As many have said, it really is a pretty extreme beer that, to me, is distinctively Devil Dancer. It drinks pretty well and it tastes solid, but I don't think I'd pay whatever the cost is for a four-pack of this stuff. I tend to love Founders offerings, but I just like this one."
""
"The taste is overwhelmed by floral and citrusy hops. The bread is there too but it is really in the background. Triple hops really make a difference in this brew."
""
"O- this one is a slow sipper. Thick, boozy and full of hops. I didn't have high hopes after the aroma but the flavor made up for it. Definitely worth a try for hop heads."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel has a big oily feel. Finish is dry and bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this beer is a very good DIPA. Big hop profile, but an even bigger malt bill to stand up to the alpha acids. Very nice hop resin left behind in the aftertaste. I love that in a DIPA. The alcohol is a little sharp at 12%, but still isn't that fiery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Color is exceptional...most amazing deep copper hue with tincture of fluorescent pumpkin. Pours into the glass like a churning alchemaic event that foreshadows the bold taste to follow. Taste is pure fog cutter that shreds the minutia of whatever you were thinking of before your first sip. Kudos to the brewmaster!"

"If you haven't had it, GET IT NOW."
""
""

"O - Great beer. Great contrast between the great hop flavor and caramel malt sweetness. One of my favorite to trade for."
"Beer is heavy-bodied, substantially weighty with moderate levels of carbonation, resulting in a fairly smooth, lightly fizzy beer with strong bittering agents and quite perceptible ethanol. Ethanol is easily felt on the tongue and back of throat, as well as in the nostrils; other, equally strong beers have hidden their alcohol content much better than this. Closes quite dryly, as expected from the hops and ethanol. Ethanol burn lingers well after each sip, as does the substantial stickiness from the immense amount of malt used in the beer."
""
""
""
""
"This beer is not for everyone. It's not for pounding or chugging. It's for slow sipping and careful appreciation. DFH 120 is definitely the closest parallel, although this is less wine-like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The smell was dense and dark and full of caramel. It had a slight smell of oak but I don't think it was oaked aged. The taste was balanced and pretty smooth for such a high abv. The taste was caramel filled and bitter through and through. Overall a wonderful beer which I would buy again."

"damn tasty, maybe one bottle is a bit much... can this be a desert IPA ? or something along that line? the various differentiation in the bitter flavors is really interesting, a really nice beer. not something I would reach for often but something to perhaps have a bottle with friends once in a moon"
""
""
"Overall - Not bad, a little boozy and there are hoppier """TIPAs""" out there which I would likely reach for before choosing this one. Would still recommend though because it is a powerhouse."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"***edit. I was able to enjoy this on tap on 7/22/13. I would rate on tap quite a bit higher than bottled. More of a well balanced blend vs pine forward on tap. Overall closer to 4.25."
""
"O - Not to many Triple IPAs out there so it's tough to judge based on style with a limited control group. Sugar in the beer allow the yeast to create loads of alcohol. Tries to seek balance on a super hoppy beer so it is very sweet and very bitter. Get past the bitterness and you can enjoy this sipper."
""
""
""
""
"I like this beer. I believe this beer is intended to be """unbalanced""" to ensure the hops are front and center. Any maltier and i think this would taste more like an american strong ale. I like this beer and anyone with the balance sheet to afford it at $22 a 4-pack must try it. A great treat for the hop head in the best of us."
""
""

"This beer gives the feel of over the top, in your face, Bam...hops! It succeeds but the alcohol taste and burn ruins it a bit for me."

""
"Cheers."
""
""
""
"O: This is a really unbalanced beer and seems a little extreme, even with what's out there today in the IPA DIPA market. That being said, it is drinkable. However, I think Founders needs to brew up a good replacement for this next year in my opinion."
""
""
"Although this is a massive beer, it hit all of the right levels for me. Intensely hopped and a huge malt backbone, the beer geek in me was enjoying this one until the last drop. The alcohol is not well hidden but there is so much more going on you will forget about it altogether. For anyone looking for gigantic beer, a true strong ale, don't hesitate to dance with the Devil Dancer!"
""
""
"great looking amber orange, minimal head/lacing and all that jazz. smell is beautiful sweet pine, fruit, alcohol. taste is slick and syrupy, with an unbelieveable amount of hops. pine, earth, alcoholic fruit, malt and spice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dont hesitate to buy this! I'm going back for more"
""
""
""
"O- Incredible! This is a Founder's IPA here. Refreshing, yet a sipper. I enjoyed this much better than Double Trouble, due to the malt load. Impressive...relax and enjoy this one!!!"
""
""
"Overall this beer is about what i expected it to be. Founders makes some amazing stouts, but i feel their IPAs are a step below the elites. This one is no exception. Good, but not world class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Gotta love a huge hop bomb. This one is pretty well balanced and has some highpoints that are elite. Comes on a little strong and boarders on going over the top but it is no doubt a fun beer to drink."

"Definitely the most balanced batch of this yet (even though it's still a massively bitter hop bomb), and certainly my favorite rendition so far. I'd pick up at least one bottle to try it or get a sampler on draft if you were put off by it before. It'll be interesting to see if certain flavors fade or become more prevalent as time goes on."

"O-interesting sipper, but not something I would make great effort to seek out"
"Pours a nice, ruddy, clear mix of brown, red, and caramel. The smell is very malty, and has a nose almost like a barleywine. It has a massive alcohol hit, and it's so smooth that it invites you to pound it, even though you know it's going to kick your ass. It says it's an IPA, but there's so much malt to get it to 12% that it totally dominates the hops. You don't get a bourbon -style alcohol burn, but it lets you know that it's a high ABV beer. It there going down, and if you swallow some air along with it, that alcohol gives a reminder on the way back up. This is not a summertime IPA (unless you plan on being unconscious as your summertime hobby). The depth of flavor allows it to pair with a lot of different foods."

"O - This isn’t a bad TIPA. I feel they don't hide the alcohol well at all. I would drink one and that's about it, move on to something else more drinkable.(but it is 12% so how many would I drink anyway?) Plus the fact its $20 for 4 pretty much seals the deal, I might not get this again. Might!"

"Pours an orange-red amber color. Small off-white head. Scent is not what I was expecting...quite malty. Pineapple and citrus hops...nothing piney though. A bit off booze with sweet sugary aromas. Some bread-like aromas also. Taste is...wow...I'm very hesitant to call this a triple IPA. This taste very similar to Bigfoot with a bit more booze. This definitely tastes like a barleywine. Very malty with caramel and sweet brown sugar at first. Tingly, spicy booze and hoppiness. The booze can be a little overwhelming at times. Mouthfeel is full bodied and tingly. Drinkability is fair. Overall, this is not one of my favorite Founders beers. It is good in small doses, but this is not an IPA. Being from the west coast, I'm used to triple IPAs tasting like PtY, Drake's Black Label, Expo, etc. This one is much more malty and boozy. Good beer, but not great."
""
""
"O- What is lacks in looks and smell, is totally overridden by the taste. A massively complex brew that hopheads should seek out."
""
""
""
"O: I haven't had many TIPA's, but this seems like a more than fair example of the style. Very boozy, sweet and almost spicy hot, but the hops do a good job of keeping things balanced. Real hopheads might want to steer clear of this, but if you don't mind some heavy malts and booze in your IPA's, this might just be a fridge staple!"
""
""
""
"I wasn't a big fan of this one. Founders is a brewery that usually impresses, but I feel like they missed the mark and overcomplicated this brew. The hops are all over the place. The huge malt character is just not pleasing. The drinkability of this beer is zero. Not to mention the $5+ pricetag for a 12 oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This isn't exactly an everyday kind of pleasure, but for what it is, it's quite good, a real blast of extreme flavor. An intense, mouth-pummeling drink."

"Overall: While I was initially skeptical of the beer based on the first two grading categories, the last two (the important two, as I like to call them) really made up for it. Hopheads will love this beer. It was easily worth the $3 for a single bottle that I paid, and I would even say that it beats out DFH’s 90 Minute for my favorite DIPA, though I will have to reevaluate that when I finally give that one its long-delayed review. Pick this up if you like hops, like a good melding of East Coast maltiness and West Coast palate destroying IPAs. 16/20"

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A really good Triple IPA. It’s so easy to go overboard on the hops when it comes to double and triple IPAs, this is one beer that balances the strong flavors and subtle nuances in a great way. Would definitely recommend."
""
""
""
"Overall - Powerful IPA with some bold flavors and a somewhat unappealing mouthfeel. Hopheads like myself may enjoy it, but for the price you can do much better, especially with Founders."
""
""
"Orange-brown in body with frothy milk head. Aroma of citrus, citrus rind, caramel, toffee, subtle hazelnut, some medicinal notes, booze. Tastes of deep citrus juice with sour rind, caramel, toffee, light hazelnut, grass, lemon zest, hop resin, and booze. Chewy medium bodied with medium carbonation. Slick on the palate. Big boozy, malty IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very solid DIPA from founders, they never seem to disappoint. They call it a triple but the booze it not as overwhelming as some others beers in this style. Nice balance, nothing uber standout though."
""
""
"That's not the case when it came to the alcohol here. this is strong and not afraid to admit it, and I could feel it after one of these. The crystalline malts balance this out nicely and for those willing to take the dance with the Devil, their efforts will be rewarded. It's not a West Coast """hop bomb""" but it held its own and everything that shone through the alcohol worked together well. This just isn't head and shoulders above the other IPA's out there."
""
""
"Overall. A big IPA for sure. Huge malt base provides ballance, but I prefer a little higher hop to malt ratio."
""
""
""
""
""
"Yuck. I was very disappointed with this. Founder's puts out amazing stuff, but this just missed the mark. Instead of an incredibly complex, hoppy brew, I was sucking on a hodge-podge of malts, unwanted bitterness, and overpowering alcohol burn. I'll definitely be passing this one up next time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a good beer, but a strong beer too. This may be the limit for an IPA. Starting to lose some of the flavors a typical IPA should have in place of boozey flavor. Glad I tried it though!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"When i poured this beer, it has a nice reddish copper color body with no head to it. The smell is bursting with hop bitterness and some citrus. The taste is like wow, nice and bitter up front from the hops and then a little malt on the back of the tongue. It even gets nicer as it sits and warms up. The mouthfeel is very nice, kinda heavy, its not a sipping beer but its not a chug it down either, its somewhere in between. It leaves a nice stickyness on the tongue also. Overall a really good DIPA."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Man, what a wonderful triple APA. You can tell that a lot of work went into this and it was done very well."
"O: This beer has a bold hops bitterness that makes it truly unique. The malt sweetness is an underlying flavor that provides more to the complexity than balance. It has a pleasant floral flavor along with the raw, unbridled peppery bitterness that is the focus of this beer. The bitterness is sure to please hopheads."
"Overall: Anybody want to put this one in as an extra, please trade with me. I really enjoyed this one, and hope to have many more chances to try it again...and again."
""
""
""
"The beer was advertised as a triple IPA. To me, this style doesn't work. The hops were there but the malt and overall taste was reminiscent of a blond, not-well-made, barleywine. Personally, for the cost, I would saver your money and buy Bigfoot or something similar if you're looking for a hoppier, high-alcohol beer."
""

""

"Overall - meh. Spend less money and go for Double Trouble."

""

""
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma. The malt backing was huge!! There was such a full, potent quality, with sweetness of caramel and pales, while adding buttery character, spice, and wood. This helped to hold up against the monstrous booziness. The hops were a bit subdued, but retained enough vigor to keep this classifiable as a DIPA. This is a strong tasty brew, and certainly not a surprise from Founders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad """triple IPA""". Better flavors than others I've had, but still not something I'd sit down & drink often."
""
"Overall, as I said above, a mess of a beer but I actually like it. It is boozy and it is anything but subtle, but has its charms. Not something anybody would want too often."
"O- I've had this super fresh and now with a little time on it. Both experiences were amazing."
"Really a great beer that everyone needs to try once their taste buds are ready. This is really a complex beer, very hard to describe, and very strong. This beer needs to be treated with respect or the drinker will find himself in a world of hurt. Very enjoyable experience, but also a very serious taste that might not be acceptable to a large audience."
""
"O - With the combination of sticky sweet and the alcohol burn, this one didn't work for me...I know some people enjoy this type of big IPA, but I like to taste the hops and prefer my IPA's on the hoppier side"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid drinking BIG ABV beer. Easy drinking and nicely done. Not one I'll hurry to get but one I'll pick up a single and enjoy it slowly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: glad to try this once. alcohol does not hide itself. A bit pricey."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I had high expectations, I mean it's billed as a triple IPA. The hops are there, but the alcohol is just way too overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
""
""
"Overall a damn strong IPA that has a lot more malt than I anticipated. The only way they can make such a bitter beer palatable is with a ton of malt."
"Pours from the bottle a cloudy orangeish-red. Minimal head. Not a fantastic looking beer, but not bad either. The nose is surprisingly mild for this monster. I don't smell much - but here goes: citrus fruits, pine needles, and herbal notes. That's about all I get. The taste hits you hard - an assault after the subtle nose. It's like every hope variety in the world is included, and a sweet malty backbone attempts to balance it all. Bitter and sweet, but mostly bitter. Tastes of lemon, orange, grapefruit, pine resin, something almost medicinal, hot alcohols (fairly well covered under the bitterness), and caramel in the background. I'm reminded of an American Barleywine in the overall mouthfeel and taste. Top notch ale. Hence the price tag..."
"Overall, a very solid beer that is very well balanced in my opinion. Boozey and malty for a so-called “triple IPA,” but more appealing to me than some overly hoppy DIPA’s. Gets me excited for my first taste of DFH 120."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - To me this slightly resembled something like a DFH 120 min, but it falls very short. It is a huge, sticky, IPA that looks beautiful in the glass... but comes up a little short on taste."
""
""
""
"Devil Dancer pours as name ironically implies; a dark blood red with very little head. The aroma is incredibly hoopy, very floral. The taste is massively heavy with hops, fallen on a strong oakey backbone, a warm alcohol taste lingers afterwards along with the bitterness and dryness one would expect. Very strong flavor, will be on the palate for a very long time. Overall a fasntisc must try beer, but not for the fair hearted."
"Overall, this is excellent fare, and while the overpowering nature of the hops will make this undrinkable to anyone who can’t even take a simpler IPA, it should definitely be on the list for any serious hophead. The hops in here are well chosen to present a variety of flavors, and balanced slightly toward the more bitter of those flavors, but with just enough citrus left to prevent the drinker from feeling like they’re chewing on pine sap. Simultaneously, the huge sugars in here play nicely off of the hops, bursting on the tongue in sweet goodness. In fact, it’s hard to imagine more flavor being crammed into a bottle. A must-try."
""
"Something different as far as a strong imperial pale ale, but I doubt I'd revisit this again. I've found that when I find a big IPA that I really like from a particular brewer, I tend to dislike their imperial stout offering(s). And vice versa. Based on that experience, and having tried this """triple IPA", I'm sure I'll love some of this brewery's other beverages."
""
"Overall: Well, its more like a hoppy barleywine, and of I was in the mood for a DIPA, this would not do it. This wasn't my first of these though, so I was ready and looking forward to it. Nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is thick and full bodied. The beer is borderline syrupy but it works. Very dry and awesomely bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is good- medium full body, low carbonation, good dose of resiny hops. This is a very good beer, but in a crowded field. Perhaps too expensive for what you get."
""
""
""
""
"O- see above"
""
"Overall I enjoyed this beer and was a little impressed, I thought it was a great example of intense DIPA, for being as intense as it was it was still nicely balanced. This beer had pretty good drinkability, the alcohol didn't show up as much as I thought it would, it wasn't overly bitter, and the flavor sure kept me interested and on my toes, but one is enough for me, but If i was on a mission to wreck my palate and get wasted I could see drinking two, but anymore then that just wouldn't be a good idea. What I liked most about this beer was how intense yet balanced it was, it had the best of both worlds and that worked well with this beer, the taste was the highlight. What I liked least about this beer was the higher amount of sweetness, it was a little too sweet at times, but that didn't hurt it that much since that comes with the territory. I would buy this beer again, but probably not till next year, at over $5 dollars it's pretty expensive, but sometimes you got to treat yourself, and a couple of these a year seems like the right amount, I recommend this beer to anyone that loves big and intense DIPA's. All in all this was a great beer, that exceeded my expectations, after hearing a little bit about this beer I was afraid it was going to be one of those too intense and overly bitter DIPA's, but once I got down to it it wasn't nearly as rough as I thought it would be and the balance really impressed me. Forget what you heard about this beer and just try it, you will be glad you did. Founders comes through with another great beer, great job guys this one's impressive and worthy of it's name, sometimes you have to dance with the devil.  2014 Edit I aged a bottle for a year and it turned into a nice barleywine, the hops died down with just a little bitterness remaining and I thought it was a good beer, I really enjoyed it aged."
"O- If you didn't see it coming already, I cannot shake the correlation to DD and BB. That said, this is a wonderful beer, but being that it is a seasonal, limited availability and quite pricey (I've seen it range from $5 to $7+ per bottle), I just don't think it is worth the extra money (although I could only imagine the base cost to make this beer!). I will just be thankful for being able to quaff Burton Baton year-round and at a significantly lower price. Although a tremendous fan of all things Founders brews, this will be a one-time purchase for me."

"Overall. Very complex on both bottles (yes I had to say it again). Hopheads may be dissatisfied with the lack of upfront hop on the nose but the super intense bitterness and long finish bring you home. I don't tend to let my IPAs get any age but held this one over just to see. I found that one year really softened it and I enjoyed it more for the intense layered bitter brown ale that it is. Enjoyed the year old brew more. Will save two for next year."
""
"O- A decent beer in my book, but I expected more pungent grapefruit, pine resin, hoppy flavor from this one. Not overly disappointed but then again, not overly excited either."
"This is a solid beer. It's hoppy, it's malty, it's probably more a Barleywine than a DIPA. It's sweet and bready but hoppy and smooth. I love this beer no matter the style. I'll have it again in a heartbeat."
"Unfortunately, Devil Dancer was a let down.. Very overpowering and not smooth. Very rough and not well rounded. A slight mess, not recommended."
"O - A great triple that has many of those barleywine flavors. Simple but well done."
"O: This IPA is for the true craft beer drinkers, very bitter and warming, I enjoyed this brew but at a very slow pace."

"Dragged my feet on this one for a while, but when I saw it on tap the other day, I figured my time had come at last. Served in a snifter, a very attractive, brazen, reddish copper color, hazy, with a neat little cap of dense white head that retained well and left a bit of lacing on the glass right until the end. Aroma is expectedly hop-dominant, piney, citrus zest/pith, caramel and bready malts in the background. Big blast of fresh hops in the taste, unctuous resin, citrus pith, with a thick and ubiquitous malt sweetness, for a nice counteraction that still leaves the hops clearly in charge. Strong, bitter aftertaste, and can be a palate-wrecker for the unprepared. Chewy and full-bodied, warm with booze. Very nice for the style, and really hit the spot for the hop-craver in me after a string of light summer beers."

"Poured 12 oz bottle dated 6/18/12 into goblet. Bottle describes it as a Triple IPA with 112 IBU. Pours with no head whatsoever. Nice looking color though, a dark clear copper. Nose is my favorite part I think, lots of dank hops. You can almost picture a hop oozing with resin. Sorry I forgot this was a PG site. Taste is sweet caramel up front with the hops kicking in for the middle with a pine/citrus blend, then a bitter finish with a lot of warm booziness. My beer belly is warm from just a couple ounces. A bit syrupy feeling with carbonation on the lower end. Overall this is a decent sipper."

"O: WHY DIDN'T I GET A GOOD CIGAR TO PAIR WITH THIS? To me, this is an excellent beer to sip while smoking a nice cigar. A little pricey for what it is, though. Think of it as a great 'every once in a while' beer and you won't have any problems."
"O) Admittedly, I had some reservations about this one. This was pretty much based upon the talk of an onion flavor in past batches. I am not typically a fan of that onion or garlic flavor that can occur with certain varieties of hops. This however had a wonderful aroma and taste. Glad to recommend this brew."
"Grapefruit bite followed by a slight honey sweetness then pounding in bitter pine resin. Thick and syrupy with some interesting notes, but perhaps a little too big for its britches."
"D - To me, this comes across as more like a barley wine than a DIPA, but it works pretty well nonetheless. The malt is rich enough that this could improve with time while the hops have enough punch to make it surprisingly drinkable for what it is."
"Overall: this one warms you up quickly and burns a little. The alcohol is obviously prominent as are the hops. Try it for sure, would still with one bottle and maybe sharing it."

"Overall...great...really liked this..."
"O: Very good (Triple) IPA! Very impressive given its ABV."
""
"Overall I enjoyed this 2012 version exponentially more than last year's version, but I still don't think it is an extremely drinkable or enjoyable offering. I think they must have over dry-hopped last year's because it smelled and tasted like a head shop or a Phish concert. Don't get me wrong, this is super hoppy, highlighted by intense floral aromas and piney resiny flavors but it is not overtly offensive in the taste like it was last year. Still a one and done for me and I don't plan to revisit anytime soon because the intense flavors are just too much to enjoy in bulk or even once a year in 12oz form."
""
"O: Interesting, I didn’t think I would like this but its really interesting. I wouldn’t say this is an IPA but its good as some kind of strong ale IPA hybrid."
""
""
"This is a medium to full bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. A bold sipper with some of the most intense dank aromatics but an overbearing solvent alcohol inclusion that isnt integrated that well which hinders its overall drinkability."

"According to Founder's website it's only available in July so get it before it dissapears."
"O: Im not sold on this one.  Its not bad, and I appreciate the effort of creating a huge IPA, I just dont think its executed well.  It make me long for a DFH 120 or CCB 110k batch 5.  To those who are big fans of this, I suggest you try the 110k b5 as its similar to this (big malty IIPA with strong hop presence), just done about 10 times better than this IMO.  "
""
"Overall: I have to say I love Double Trouble, but this brew is complex and yummy. I paid just under $6 for a 12 oz bottle of this and believe it was worth every last cent, thankful I grabbed a few."
""
""
""
""
"O - Another great effort from Founders. None of the """onion""" that was mentioned last year in this years batch. Glad I was able to pick up a few of these."
"O-Overall this is a good IPA for its ABV. Was surprised of the lack of hop presence in the aroma and taste which was not expected at all. Happy I tried it and hopefully they will add extra hops to give it a overall better more appetizing smell and taste!"
""
""
""
""
""
"My only issue is the price -- $5.59 for a single 12 oz. bottle is far too steep."

"If you're looking for something subtle, you choose the wrong beer. If you wanna """Rock Out With Your Hops Out", this is the one for you."

"Pour yields about a finger of light, light tan head, which fades to almost nothing, with decent retention on glass. Dark orange/Ruby Red grapfruit coloring, looks fantastic. I was not expecting the smell to be so dank, particularly because I just tried this for the first time 2 days ago on draft, after picking up six bottles, and was not terribly impressed (which leads me to embark on another story, for another time, about my fondness for bottle over daft in most cases). This, though, is amazing. I smell pine resin, intense malt with a dash of caramel but not much. There is citrus, most likely grapefruit, and of course sick hops. Taste out of the bottle dwarfs the draft version I had but two days ago. In general, taste here follows the nose. Dank pine resin and citrus hops galore, brilliantly hide the 12%ABV. Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth, with light to medium carbonation and light bitterness. Overall this is excellent. I suppose I enjoy this more than most, but then again, Founders makes my favorite beers. I should have bought more of this."
"O. Overall, a very nice beer that I enjoyed. Might be a little too much for your average beer drinker, however hardcore beer nerds will enjoy this one alot. Another solid offering from Founders."
""

"The taste wasn't as high in hops as I thought it would be. There was actually a fair amount of sweet maltiness that masked some of the hops. Add in the alcoholic warmth that is sure to come with a beer with this high of an ABV and you are left with a fairly complex beer. That said, it didn't pack the citrusy hoppy punch that are present in most of my favorite IPAS."
""
""
""
""
"Triple hops brewed...done right!"
""
"O- Awesome IPA, pretty ridiculous and over the top but thats a good thing. It's like they took a massive barley wine and decided to turn it into an IPA afterwards. Im going to age a few of these guys. At 6$ a bottle, they better age well."
""
"O: Happy to have tried it, but will not be purchasing again. Balance is not all that well in my opinion, and I find that the alcohol is plainly too much to thoroughly enjoy this brew. The hops are huge (which is great), but I prefer the hops to be complemented by a nice balance of tropical fruits and have a lighter mouth feel that creates higher drinkability. In addition, the complexity is very shallow. Glad I bought only a single."
"Very interesting beer, but not one to drink a lot of. A little bit ti overpowering for my taste."
""
"Overall, this is a disappointing beer and drinks more like an American Strong Ale."
"Great overall. Incredibly thick, rich and flavorful. Although the caramel and malt slightly steal the show. This shouldn't be considered an IPA but something more akin to a barleywine. A bit pricey but something I look forward to trying year after year."
""
""
""
""
"Pours out an amber hue with a thin whitehead that maintains some retention and lacing longer than most beers I have tried. It has a toasty malt, pine, citrus and caramel aroma. The taste is loaded with pine and citrus hops throughout that is balanced by some caramel and toasty malts. The warmth of the alcohol is throughout. The smooth oily buttery feel makes this very strong drink rather easy to drink, maybe too easy. This is a very yummy beer that is a must try, but even though it is very good please remember it has 12% alcohol so don't drink too much at a time."
""
"Far different than last year's offering, which was overwhelmingly oniony. More bitter than flavor hops, and a big malt backbone to carry the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Cost: $19.99 for a four pack."
""
"O- I like this, a good DIPA that has a lot of hop flavor throughout the drink. A little overpriced in my mind but a good beer to try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I wanted to love this after the reviews I have heard from my friends but I simply cannot support a brew of this kind. It tastes like a brute mixture of a fine IPA and barleywine, not mixing as it should. Certainly interesting but at $18/4pack I will not revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very well represented brew. Not many can post the """triple IPA""" label but this one delivers. I do prefer Hoppin' Frog's Hop Dam which has more of the piney hops for my taste."
"O-a bit much for my taste. It seems balanced but at the same time it is so strong it takes away from the complexity. definitely a sipping beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It is a hard beer to review, I really like have come to a point in my life that I think in actuality that I love it.. It is very good but you can't drink this back to back... yes the alcohol is strong but this flavorful stuff. In a way better than you think, I picked up the last four-pack at the beer spot around my way and honestly looking forward to the next three.. Salud!"
""
"O: Eh....way too hot to be enjoyable. There's some flashes of goodness here, but the alcohol is too overpowering. The onslaught of hops isn't enough to hold off the unstoppable alcohol. However, it is fairly interesting and rare, so it's worth a try just to say that you've tried it."
""
""
""
""
"I'd like to see more brewers take a stab at this concept. This one's tasty I think."
""
""
"O: Founders is asserting themself with this one. It blurs the line between barleywine and (T)IPA, but nevertheless it is a great brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, definitely a future pass based on price point. Right off the cuff I can think of two significantly less expensive IPA's that I would prefer to drink over this beer. Was it a decent beer which was drinkable (especially for the ABV), yes. Would I recommend trying it, yes. Is it worth really searching for, no."
"O- a very nice iPa but the mouthfeel fell short for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"It better"
""
""
"O - This isn’t a bad DIPA. It’s just a little too harsh and unbalanced for my liking. However, for the alcohol content and it being a “triple” IPA, it is pretty drinkable - a sipper, but drinkable. Not bad, but I expected a bit more from a Founders beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is my favorite IPA hands down. Champion style beer that isn't too much of a Palate Wreaker. Just fantastic goodness in a glass!"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is my first Devil Dancer, and after hearing all the onion and garlic bashing about this I was expecting something offensive. Instead I happily found very strong orange notes instead of onions. Sort of pricey (paid $6 for a single bottle), but it's definitely worth at least one try. I would buy more if I had the money!"
"O: Delivers on its ABV, and is a slow sipper. The sticker price is too high, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep red amber color. Really beautiful. Nice head that fades quickly. Aroma is of strong grapefruit and alcohol. The heavy grapefruit smell really matches the red hue of the beer. A bit aggressive on the alcohol, but that’s what I like. Taste is full of flavor. Others have found this unbalanced, but I disagree. There is significant malt flavor mixed in with the strong grapefruit and alcohol notes. A bit of pine on the back end. Not as drinkable as something like Hopslam, but perfect if you’re in the mood for something a bit more extreme. Only negative here is the price. At $22 for a 4-pack, I can find some other good stuff."
""
"Pours a orangish amber with a one and a half finger head. An absolute blast of citrus rind, pine and alcohol floods the nostrils mixed with some sweet malt and bread. The bitterness can almost be tasted through the aroma. This brew opens with one of the most intense hop assaults my tastebuds have even been exposed to: Citrus rind and pine x 100 and alcohol dominate. Midpalate there is some sweetness from the abundant malt body, and the intense hop bitterness once again floods the tastebuds through the finish as the abundant alcohol brings warmth to my cheeks. Heavy, syrupy body with a surprising medium level of carbonation. This is one of the ultimate palate numbers."
""
""
""
"O: Sadly, not what I expected at all. The bitterness is fairly mild in comparison to other IIPA's and leaves me wanting more citrus or pine/resin hops. It's good, just not really good. Also, watch out as it does go down fairly easy."
"o - definitely on the demonic side. enjoyable, but a slow sipper for sure. feels a little rough around the edges. the package says it ages well so maybe i'll save one and see what happens."
""
""
""
"this is a very nice sipper. overall, for an ipa it is too much i think - i'm not sure how it is fresh, but any hoppier/more bitter than this and it probably wouldn't be all that good. the year of being aged i think gave the malty background more power in the long run - and helped even this one out."
"O-Take this beer camping because it is intense. Age should do it some good, the alcohol is too present and the hops overwhelming everything."
"O- Kind of disappointed in this one. Usually I'm a big fan of Founders, which is why I felt like I had to try this one. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great. For 12% it was decently well hidden, but the flavor wasn't anything much above average- mainly bready malts, bitter hops, and a bit of caramel. For $6.40/12-ounce bottle it definitely wasn't worth it. Glad I only bought one. Double Trouble was significantly better."
"Holy palate destroyers batman! Medium dark golden pour, cloudy. inch head. Smells of grapefruit, peach, almond and bread. Taste is Hopslam's hops + 1, and thats not always a good thing. It eschews any attempt at balance and just goes wild on hops. I like it, and its pretty unique, but I couldn't see this being a regular beer especially at the price. Though I would certainly recommend it for hop-heads and other adventurous souls."
""
""
""
"Overall (3.5): This is not an IPA or a (D/I)IPA, and if we’re going to call this a “Triple” IPA then we need to be more specific about the Pale Ale Spectrum taxonomy. This beer is special in its own way, but it is a thick, boozy, oniony mess of a “pale ale” in its own right. All of that is not necessarily bad, either, it’s just an entirely different animal. If I want a hop fix, I’ll go for something dry-hopped to hell between 7-9% ABV, depending on how long my night is / how many I’m in for. If I want a hop bomb over 10%, I’ll go with something like Hoptimum. This is one that I’m glad I tried, but probably won’t pick up again."
""
"The body is heavy and somewhat sticky with low carbonation. Overall this one isn't offensive but I suppose I just hoped for more a tongue bruising hop experience. This seems like more of a barley wine to me."
"O: I love this brew, and look forward to its release every year, an insanely aggressive palate wrecker with enough booze in it to give you a good solid kick in the ads."
""
"O: After tasting, it definitely seems like a 2012 bottle. The hops are still very present, as well as the alcohol. A definite sipper, but a tasty one. Definitely recommended for people who like big beers and IPAs. And for those questioning the pricing ($5ish for a single, $19 for a 4-pack) just think about all those $10 bombers and imports that are $6+ for an 11.2 single"
"O - Definitely tasty, but a little one dimensional. The wow factor for this beer is good but at $20 a sixer and its over the top aggressiveness, this isnt going to become one of my go-to's. A fun hop bomb none the less"
""
"(originally reviewed: 07-17-2011)"
""
""
""
"O- Only an idiot would try a 12% IIPA and complain about the alcohol burn... so I won't. It doesn't bother me that much at all, but I wish it had a bit more balance between the booze/malts/hops. Probably not something I'll get from them all the time at $20/4-pack... but I'll definately be having this one again down the road."

"Note: I had a sample from a 2011 bottle on 2014-06-08 and found it better than when fresh. Kind of surprising it held up so long. The over-the-top prickly, hop-forward-onion-like bitterness had faded considerably; so as a barleywine instead of a Triple IPA, I liked it more. Didn't change my ratings after this most-recent tasting since it is obviously unusual to hold onto a beer like this for so long."
""
""
""
""
"O: The beer definitely tastes strong, but the alcohol is well masked from the taste. I enjoyed it because it packs in a lot of hop flavors."
""

"O: Good but not great in one of my preferred styles. I think I would appreciate a little more focus in the hops flavors rather than the mixture of flavors you get in this beer. Definitely sessionable and I could enjoy another right now."

"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a foamy tan head that settles to an oily film. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus zest, honey, and some herbal and vegetal hop aromas. Taste is of citrus zest, grapefruit extract, and some herbal and oniony hop flavors. There is a somewhat assertive bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer and it’s nowhere near as bad as I have heard some people make it out to be."
"o- i was really excited to try this, but i wish had saved myself the $7 and gotten something else. I'm not sure what went wrong here. i'd be afraid to try this again"

"Not quite sure what to make of this beer. I've put a couple in the cellar and I'm hoping aging can improve this beer. It seems like the hoppiness subsiding would definitely benefit this beer and take away the harshness. However, the onion-y hops are something that I absolutely detest, so I don't know if that will get any better."
""
""
""

"Overall - A very “heavy” IPA with some wonderful characteristics. Its mouthfeel and appearance are some of the best around for an IPA. The aroma is very nice and if you are feeling like a hoppy warmer this is a beer for you."

""
""
""
""
""
"I've heard this ale described as liquid weed, and I can see why. It's earthy, peppery, hoppy and sweet, and leaves the tongue and gums tingly and numb. A one and done for sure, this 12% abv beast is a real sipper."

There was some good grapefruit in there but it was still past its prime. I really would love to try this fresh. *grumbles to self about freebie way past prime IPAs/ want to have this fresh!***"

"2013 Update - My tastebuds are now more acclimated to the hops and extreme DIPAs and Imperials so I re-reviewed. Plus the 2013 vintage is just better than 2012 was."

"I wanted to like this beer very much, but I didn't. I found it very dry and hoppy, but I definitely detected the alcohol. Perhaps it's just me, but I think it detracts from the flavor of the beer.

"Overall: This is a very good beer. Being a huge fan of Founders, I may be a little biased, but this has plenty of hops in it, a beautiful flavor, and enough alcohol to put somebody under. Highly recommended."
"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled 6/2/2011. Pours slightly hazy brick red color with a small 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin lacing cap. Some decent lacing clinging to the glass as well. Aromas of big mango, orange, grapefruit, pine resin, floral, caramel, and some toasted malts. Some excellent aromas here with good strength and balance. Taste of big orange, mango, pine, lemon zest, caramel, toasted malt, and spiciness. Big sweetness in the front that leads to a strong brutal bitterness on the finish that lasts. Lingering notes of caramel, citrus, pine, and spiciness on the finish for a while. Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that goes down smoothly, but is still a sipper. Alcohol is extremely well hidden for 12%, the warming on the finish is barely noticeable. Great balance of flavor and bitterness. Overall, an excellent and tasty Imperial IPA from Founders."
"Enjoy!"
"I've had this a few times, tap and bottle and it varies from place to place. This is a very great example of this beer. it isn't the best, but it is exceptional. I cannot put how wonderful this beer is. It is an odd style to consider. It is about as big as a hop forward IPA can possibly be. Any larger and the malt might get out of whack."
"I am a huge fan of Founders, but I don't have to love everything they offer."
"Aroma is sweet some fruit and molasses. Appearance is amber translucent. Taste is sweet and alcohol. Some caramel and light hops. I was expecting more hops to come from the taste, but it was more sweet and alcohol. some clove on the taste. palate is sweet but alcoholic. Overall not my favorite but it was decent. would like it on tap in a smaller pour though. Once again thanks Chi81 for the extra."
"Considering the 12% ABV and the 112 IBU’s I do not believe that this ale was too old. I also know the owner of the bottle shop and he is very aware of how to store and care for beer."
"I wouldn't be against giving this beer a second chance though, maybe I should have left it in the fridge for another 6 months."
"O: This beer is too hoppy. I can't imagine anyone thinking this is appropriately hopped. It lingers in your mouth for a long time. The hop flavor it does have is not very good."
"I'm not really a fan of marijuana or its associated smell/taste, but I can appreciate that it has been so well thrown into this beer. Also, how can you hate any 12% beer?"
"O. Probably the most bitter beer I have ever had. This is a hop bomb if there ever was one. If you like hoppy and I mean really hoppy beers it doesnt get much better than this. This is definitely not a beer for the faint of heart, or probably most people, but it works for me. A unique beer for sure. What can I say it has me hooked."
"Pours a hazy orange with little head that has practically no retention. Smell is a powerful combination of orange and hops. The upfront taste is dominated by a fruity citrus blast followed by a tongue twisting assault of hop goodness. The sweet alcohol finish is a bit of a downer, however. I'd classify this one as a noble effort by a great brewery, but I'll take a super hoppy DIPA over this TIPA anytime."
"O- a really really good Imperial Double IPA that is very strong and will knock you on your ass. Has a very love/hate smell, but the taste is amazing and very balanced for a Double IPA. I'm not the biggest fan of IPA's and I love this beer. Had it on tap at Founders and in a bottle and both times it was fantastic. One of my favorite all time IPA's."
"Looks good and smells good, tastes pretty good but the alcohol is very in your face all the way through, love hops but this one leaves a bad aftertaste, not my favorite founders brew"
"Overall, I think this beer is terrible. It smells like weed, it tastes vaguely foul, kind of how I imagine a pot beer would taste. My taste buds are generally in-sync with the Founders brewers, and I tend to really like their beer, but this brew is awful. I'm going to cellar the other bottle and hope that age managed to work some miracle and redeem this concoction."
"overall- the fresh is definitely a unique experience you need to have. but the year old I think is actually more enjoyable and tasty. after drinking both, I'm ready for a nap."
"D-Overall this beer is undrinkable. I took 6 drinks or so and poured the rest out. It wasn't bad tasting. it was just an assault on the mouth. I think some hop heads would love this. I love DIPA's but man this is too super duper hoppy for me. Give it a try and see if it kicks you in the face like it did to me"
"I found this beer very smooth and balanced without the floral aftertaste or bitterness that I find off-putting of IPA's. This is a sipper from a snifter, hidden alcohol."
"O: I'm not really surprised since it's a triple IPA, but the bitter hops really overpower everything in this beer. Glad I tried it, but it's not my style."
"D/O- Normally I'm a fan of boozy beers but this took it to another level and the rest of the flavors were sort of lost as such. Definitely would try again in the future, perhaps a fresher bottle, but would not go out of my way to seek out."
"O: Disappointing, probably the first beer from Founders that I haven't at least enjoyed. Usually their beers are right up my ally, but this one misses the mark."
"Its one of the hoppiest beers I've ever had for sure. Definitely a must try for a hophead."
"I just don't see the point in this exercise. Seems like a waste of so many hops, but let's support our farmers."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into tulip glass. Pours hazy amber-copper with a small tan head. The head fades slowly to a thin remnant and leaves a small amount of fine lace. On the nose, there are huge notes of grapefruit and citrus peel, along with funk, caramel, pepper, grain and a touch of pine. The flavor is moderately sweet with intensely bitter hops. Dominant notes in the flavor are citrus peel, toasty caramel malts, resin and pine. The finish is long and bitter with resiny hops. On the palate, it is medium in body with a smooth, syrupy texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a great triple IPA."
"Overall, this is an incredibly complex beer that runs the gamut on a large variety of aromas and taste. Bitter, but not as much as I was expecting. Wish I didn't have to score this one, its so different from anything else. Onion flavors were just as appealing as they were repulsing, as weird as that sounds. While this may not be my favorite beer, I applaud Founders for doing something different. Will probably sip on this for the next 1 1/2 hours or so and see how it changes as it warms."
"Overall, this is a great beer. Not a """triple IPA""" at this point, but closer to a barley wine, and an damn good one. Thanks again to Chris and Matt Capone for this brew."
"Overall - This is an impressive exercise in brewing, but that's about it. It's an all around good beer, but nothing spectacular."
"Balance is nowhere to be seen. I know that I should probably ding this beer for that, but the bitterness compels me to keep drinking it. It just destroys your mouth, and leaves you wanting more. As a Triple IPA should. Very good."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A sipper to be sure. Not sure I like the release date on this one. Would prefer a fall/winter release, but I'll take it when I can get it. Big Beer....not for the inexperienced."
"Overall: this is an enjoyable strong ale / double IPA / whatever. Like I said, it is a bit all over the place, but it is still a pretty tasty quaff."
"O - well, it's boundary pushing but that doesn't mean it's great. I wasn't extremely impressed here, but they did do a great job hiding the alcohol. Founders is a fantastic brewery and I am happy they do things like this. This one isn't a big hit in my book, but it wouldn't keep me from buying more offerings from a brewery if this was some new brewery and they released something like this. Have to applaud the effort."
"O: Overall, this is a ridiculous beer. My tongue is numb, I am slightly scared, but I welcome this experience now, and will revisit at some point in the indeterminate future. This is maybe the most intense beer I have ever tried, my mouth is on fire, I feel like the Devil IS dancing on my tongue, and Why did I so this to myself? However, I highly recommend trying this beer with a friend, it is just too much beer to handle alone, metaphysically speaking."
"O: Not as hoppy as I imagined. Booze is hidden okay."
"O-Great poster child for extreme beer. Better than the totally undrinkable and utterly nasty 120 minute, this is an answer to a question that I for one, did not ask. I love a great strong ale. This is fun, but good, it aint."
"Drinkability is pretty low here. While the ABV is well hidden, the hop flavor doesn't make up for the intense hop bitterness. All pain and no gain. Dissapointed here, had a hard time finishing it. I guess this was more beer than I could handle."
"O: Wowzaa! I haven't had a hop bomb like this in years. I mean, when you first start drinking IPA's and you look for the most intense oral hop rape?! Yeah, this does that....again. Fuck me rotten this is insane. I can't even tell if I like it cuz I finished so fast, which makes me want more! Like my first piece of pussy."
"This can only happen in America. I love Founders, but leave this to DFH or someone. No class, just a very poor example of a style that can be truly great."
"O: Not crazy about this one. Bitter, but lacking. I just can't really get into it."
"M- Great. Very full and rich. Almost creamy, in fact."
"This is bold. Tastes like it has more alcohol than it does. Glad I got to try and maybe I should have had it a bit fresher, but this tastes like it could be aged as well. If you dont like bitter, dont bother."
"TheBeerAlmanac.com"
"O: This is a very good beer but not one that you could drink everyday. Personally, the aftertaste lasts a little to long in my mouth and my mouth starts to feel burnt towards the end."
"Overall: First time I have tried a """triple IPA""" according to the bottle anyways. Its an aggressive beer, living up to some of the hype. Its definately a sipper. I expected this beer to rip my toungue out from the bitterness. This beer was not like that at all. I think that I have tried other hoppy beers that seemed to have a more bitter bite than this beer. All that said, this is probably my least favorite founders beer that I have tasted. Its still worth a try for all you hopheads out there. Extra sharp cheddar cheese pairs well with this beer."
"O: had this on tap at the brewery and it was awesome. In bottle form, this is the worst double IPA I've had. This is the only Founders beer that I have not absolutely loved. If you want a great, big DIPA, grab the Double Crooked Tree from Dark Horse."
"Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is very drinkable considering its body and ABV. The body is thick and coating, but is not syrupy and only slightly sticky. The carbonation is not overly apparent and could definitely stand to be a bit stronger."
"Devil Dancer is a really great double (or triple as the label says) IPA. Another grand slam from Founders, keep it up!"
"SkÅL!"
"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle into a pint glass. Nice looking beer. Bright amberish color and silky cream head. Nose has lots of malts and hops. But a bit boozy. As is the taste. Medium to full body well carbonated. Not bad, just too much alcohol. Really gets in the way."
"O - pretty solid beer. Definitely a sipper, not only because of the alcohol but also because of the bitterness."
"Overall I thought this beer was one of the worst beer experiences of my life. I know that it is best fresh and that the hops fade with time. However, with this one the hop pressense was still there, it just tasted awful. Not sure really why it tasted so bad."
"O: If you like hops, this is a must drink. Recommended. Will have again. Stupid unbalanced."
"O- I find it better than what others are saying, but I wouldn't choose this over any other Founders beers I've had. It's very different, very strong, and damn, it would be awesome with some Cuban food with extra garlic and onions."
"I don't agree that this beer is undrinkable. It has a lasting effect on a guy, especially on the tongue. The aftertasted goes on and on. As a pairing I'd go opposite of this and drink it with something really hearty, like a prime rib or a pork chop."
"Reading some other reviews of this beer, I noticed a great discrepancy in the description of the beer's appearance, head, and lacing. Did I wait too long on this one? No real head to speak of and only minimal lacing but carbonation was still there in appropriate levels. Hmmm. To each their own, I suppose."
"There is really nothing at all subtle about this beer, and if you don't like Simcoe, you should stay away. If you do like your onions and garlic in your beer, than this hop-bomb is pretty damn fun to experience at least once, although the price is kind of absurdly high. One """hop bomb""" per week of something like this is more than enough to satisfy the masochistic tastebuds in my mouth.... I personally prefer the Oracle for doing the same thing only with less onion character."
"O: Devil Dancer sure is a good name for this beast. It's up there with Hopsickle as the most outrageous hop-bomb I've ever had. That said, I'm not a fan of the dank herbal hop quality, it's just way too much for me, especially with the potent onion/garlic thing going on. It succeeds as an all-out, take no prisoners hop-bomb of epic proportions, but it's just not my thing. I really couldn't drink much of this stuff."
"overall, I guess it is what it is...an out of balance hop-bomb. would be interesting to see what it was like with some age on it. seems a bit hot now and I dont know if i would necessarily seek it out again, but tasty no less."
"This is really an extremely hoppy beer when its fresh. Definitely in need of some age."
"Just not really into this one at all. Won't seek it out, but like always I'm glad I tried it."
"O – A liquid shot of hops."
"O: This isn't one of my favorite Imperial IPA's I have ever had, but its not bad. The alcohol is definitely noticeable in the taste, which isn't a terrible thing, but it's not a great one either. The main flavor is extreme bitterness which I like but it's pretty one sided. A lot more complexity could be present and that much hop flavor could easily hide any flaws. An okay beer."
"Overall: It's not my favorite. But I could drink it again. The smell is much, much better than the taste. And the bitterness is probably what kills it for me."
"Overall - It's tough to rate it. For what it is, it's good. It's an over-the-top IPA and it actually tastes good. Much more drinkable than 120 and Double Crooked Tree."
"Cheers"
"O: I'm taken aback and slightly offended by Founders Devil Dancer. All the part are there, expect the most important part: the flavor. It's unlike any DIPA I've ever encountered, and not in a good way. It's oddly aggressive, yet unique beyond compare. It's also exceedingly hard to drink. I do hope my drain enjoyed it more then me."
"O: This is really pretty good, and even a bit trippy. Unfortunately though this really showcases a maximum of two dimensions. Good flavors fall to a """meh""" state as I get numbed with repeated sips. A beer like this doesn't gain as much as it should for being 12.00%. I'll give this beer some credit as it isn't as overbearing on the sweetness as many others in style (TIPA), but I wouldn't reach for another one of these. This is the biggest hippy beer I've ever had."
"This beer pours a dark copper color with minimal head. the smell is a combination of bond water and hops as well as a definite alcohol presence and sweetness. the taste is sweet boozey and bitter hoppy with some piney hop notes. the mouthfeel is to full for the style and overall this is not a beer i would seek out let alone pay over 15 bucks for a 4 pack"
"overall - I wish it had been a bit calmer. Nose was fantastic, but the booze and hops were too extreme for me."
"Randall"
"O- A tasty beer that is a good sipper. The flavors aren't as seperate as the aroma is, but still very good and would buy again if I could find it."
"O: Would be an awesome beer for a weed smoking hop head, but the alcohol is pretty evident. Don't know what this would do with a little age. Guess I'll have to get a few and give it a shot."
"Aroma is marijuana, lemons, pine and toffee. The dank marijuana flavor only increases on the palate. Unfortunately, there’s also a pretty big solvent note and booze is apparent. It drinks somewhat easily for the abv, but this is still a big and sorta sticky beer. A big bitter finish reins in the malt sweetness. It’s a huge rich DIPA that stays away from the candied hop territory of sweeter versions. Appearance is a bright orange-amber with a small, dissipating off-white head. Pretty good stuff but not something I’d want often."
"Bottled on June 17, 2011. Dark copper orange in color with a light haze. Poured with a thin white head that reduced to a wispy cap that left a few sticky lacings. Intense, pungent herbal hop aroma with citrus orange and grapefruit in the background. Smooth and oily feel. Flavor is all hops. Pungent, earthy herbal hop flavors that simply overwhelm your tastebuds. The first sip had a biting tanginess that seemed to numb my tongue and I never experienced that sensation again. Finished semi-dry with a noticable alcoholic heat and a lingering herbal bitter aftertaste. IPAs are DIPAs easily my favorite, but this was over the top for my thirst for hoppy beer. Most definitely a sipper."
"O - This beer was a bit too intense with the onions and earthiness when fresh. I've cracked a bottle open every few months and as this is my last 2011, I decided to update my review. My conclusion would be that Aged 2011 > Fresh 2011. It changes a great deal much like 120 minute. Just wish I could have resisted the temptation and held onto a bottle for two years."
"Overall- The mouthfeel gives this big points. Not a beer for you if you want a citrus bomb, but still an enjoyable beer that packs a nice punch."
"This beer was bottled on 06/17/11 so I am compeled to find out what a little age does to this beer."
"This beer is HOT! Nice hoppy nose, but as soon as the middle of the tongue, the heat from the alcohol really kicks in. I think they could have shaved a percent or two off the ABV and had a more balanced, but still aggressive brew. But I am guessing that this was not at all what Founders had in mind. Attractive looking beer in the 8 oz snifter-type glass. Taste was good, when I could get past the heat. The beer did agree more with me as I went..."
"O: Awesome Double IPA. Doesn't drink like its 12%, more like 8%. You do pick up some alcohol, but nothing harsh. Worth seeking out and buying each time this stuff comes out. Interesting to see what some age will do on this."
"Overall, this is what is advertised. An aggressively hopped dance with the devil. Can't say I didn't enjoy it, but its a serious beer. Boys need not apply."
"Overall Impression- Very strong and interesting all the way through the drink. What a beer for an anniversary review. It was stronger than ever and this was what I was looking for. If you get a chance, get after it! It changes my mind about Double IPAs."
"To me the smell is one that I have never smelled in any beer before, personally, I almost think it smells like weed, especially on tap."
"Bottle and tap. Had lots of hype on this one and it certainly disapointed to say the least. Aroma: Overpowering fruity hops, light cherries, Onions(!), ughh. If it wasn’t for the onions, it would have been OK. Appearance: Copper pour with small head. Flavor: Lots of fruity hops again, but unfortunately the alcohol is not hidden at all and takes all the place. Lots of sweetness also. Palate: Rich and heavy, lots of alcohol. Overall: Could not finish half the bottle. It wasn’t so bad on tap though, but the alcohol was overpowering. I can't believe this is so highly rated."
"A good beer, probably trying too hard to hit high ABV and huge hops. A little more balance would make this a better beer or at least for my taste. Really glad I got to try this."
"Overall, a pretty enjoyable beer, but it was a lot to take in at one time. Really feel the 12% after just one."
"D/O: Palate punishing in taste and, particularly, in texture, this beer takes no prisoners and apologizes to no one. Even the Stone gargoyle might decry this a drain-pour, yet it is probably the perfect concoction to scratch the itch possessed by a few jaded beer devotees. The alcohol is potent in its physiological effect, producing a more intoxicating effect than even a 12% monster should. A must-try, but be warned that 12 oz. is probably too much for a mere mortal to stomach."
" Overall its just ok,not really impressed all that much, like I usually am from my favorite brewery. I am going to have to try another bottle."
"O: This was something else, a real test of one's love for hops. It was so sharp and filled with spicy hops, yet so thick and rich... very well balanced. I can't wait to try it again."
"O- a little too hoppy, but incredibly smooth for a triple"
"Poured into a 13oz tulip. Wow this beer is so dank! So attractive, bright amber orange, with a inch of white sticky head. Smell is so memorable, yes some onion, mango, pineapple, booze, and pine. Taste more intense then smell, it some how works, even with the onion taste. I feel it drinks easy for the twelve % abv. On yhe thicker side or the style, enough carbonation. A must try for a hop head or someone who likes beers that are unforgettable. Will seek this out next year, can't wait to drink with another Ba for more thoughts."
"O - This is definitely one of the most bitter hoppy weedy beers that I've ever had and I'm diggin it and its a good thing I was in the mood for hops when I opened the bottle a mut try for the hop heads out there"
"2.5 D: The back and forth of the sweet and bitter is a bit too much for me. They should have focussed on a few flavors instead of trying to jam this beer full of all of them."
"SNOOGENS!!!"
"Overall one balls to the wall 3xIPA that will blow your tongue right off with the amount of hop flavor and bitterness there is. Beyond the generic hoppiness The malt lends a nice counter and the alcohol is warming and intergrated very well. This is a great beer."
"0-good beer. would love to see what some age does to it."
"O: An outstanding Triple IPA! Most IPAs around the 12% abv range tend to be a little more focused on the malt (not on purpose, of course). This one is still all about the hops; Big, huge, bitter American hops! Mmmm...I'm dancing with the Devil. :)"
" ~ This is an amazing beer. This has to be one of the best Imperial IPAs I've ever enjoyed. I'm even more impressed at how well it aged over the past year."
"UPDATE 7/4/13: Pulled out one of these that I've been aging for 2 years hoping that the bitterness would fade and malty goodness would take over. Nope. Still oniony, dip tobacco flavor. Yikes. I'll check back in in two years."
"Nonetheless, I can't deny that such Olympian heights of hops, good (enough) mouthfeel, and improbably well-balancing malt backbone serve largely to highlight the fact that I would be totally in love with the flavor of this beer if certain other hop flavors were as well incorporated as the savory Summit-ish flavors and pine. As it stands, I like the beer, but I would rather love it."
"Bought a bottle at Capone's bottle shop about a week ago, but still have it. It's on tap, so why not. This stuff is very unique. Big caramel profile. One of the most aromatic beverages of any kind that I've smelled. Heavy caramel scent ant initial taste. The finish is remniscent of the torched sugar atop creme brule. I thought there was no way this could resemble creme brule in any capacity, but it comes through in spades. Sweet, but not in an overbearing way. Nice way to finish your night of tasteful drinking."
"O: I am no poet, but Devil Dancer inspires more than mere prose. It is masterful in every way, and will inspire and impress whether a few weeks or a few years old, as it will no doubt age with the best of them. Devil Dancer is certainly not for the faint of heart, but if you are truly prepared to dance with the devil, you are in for one spectacular ride."
"Overall - amazing smell, just not my favorite to drink. If I were in a different mood I probably would have enjoyed it more, but like I said I have been enjoying a lot of 'drinkable' beers lately."
"O: I like it. It pretty much tastes like you're chewing on hops. And nothing else. I've had another bottle that tasted quite different. Tentative recommendation - if you love hops."
"Cheers!"
"Overall - Pretty awesome. Just a tad too bitter to be one of my faves, but very good nonetheless, and certainly very interesting. I will have to try this again from the bottle, or as my first beer of the night from the tap, to get an even more careful read on it. 4.5"
"WOW. Is all I can say about this beer it is extremely intense. As it warmed up it seemed to have more intense characteristics similar to Double Trouble. There is intense bitterness and alcohol burn but is balanced by citrus and malt flaovors. Overall a massive beer that is worth drinking once a year."
"O (D) - this is a crazy hoppy beer. It is extreme. Probably a little too busy if you want a DIPA. But I like it."
"OVERALL: I see why there are mixed feelings about this beer. It is not for everyone, but if you like surprises and aren't afraid of something a little different in your DIPA, give this one a try. It may push the bounds of a Double IPA, but it certainly still is one, a very good one."
"Overall: This thing is intense. Loads of hop flavor, running the entire gamut from citrus to pine to delicate to straight up bitter. It's aggressive and never really lets up. It's the type of beer that's worth the money, but it will wreck your taste for the rest of the night, so make it worth it."
"The CPJ"
"D: Awesome nose and flavor, but at 12% ABV can not imagine having more than a couple of the 7 oz pours. The high hop quotient was destroying my palate as well. But in small quantities, highly enjoyable. Another Founders success."
"Well, I've had this one before, maybe a year or two ago. Has the price gotten out of hand? I bought a four pack of this stuff once. Expensive, but not crazy expensive like it is now. Anyway, I poured it into a tulip glass. Very little head. The color is very dark and itlooks pretty thick. Phew! No quite digging the aroma! Very pungent hops smell, almost oniony. Now I know what people are talking about when they complain about Gubna (although I didn't get that smell with that). Ok, I'm taking several sips before I type my comments, because the taste is evolving a little. There's still a little of the onion here, but also some strong, (regular) hops taste. Everything about this beer is strong. I really don't remember it being this in your face. This is getting better as I get used to it, but I'm glad I only got one bottle this year."
"I certainly hope that the point of this beer was to produce something over the top and unable to be categorized as this is not something this all that enjoyable to drink. It reminds me of my experiences with DFH World Wide Stout. Point made! Please get back to the wonderful beers that can be palated."
"Overall: This seems to be a beer made on a dare. Unlike most of Founder's brews that treat intense flavors with care and finesse, this one is an all out assault on the drinkers palette. I'm glad I tried it once. I don't think I'll ever have another Imperial IPA that packs in this big of a wallop, but that is OK by me."
"Overall: This is not for me, though I appreciate the chance to try it. Far too harsh and far too much onion."
"On tap at Ashley's in A2. Taking a nice big whiff the aroma blew my mind. It was not only grapefruit, but loads of tropical fruit too. A sip was a wave of flavor, nice citrusy hop flavor up front with a sweet body and a bunch of hoppy bitterness, but really well balanced, almost surprisingly so. The alcohol warms the end as the flavor continues to shift through. This is an awesome beer, well done again Founder's!"
"Thanks to my old trading buddy discovolante65 for the opportunity. "
"As I start to pour the color is Damn flawless amber and blood slightly darker on top. There is no head then a nice head finally settling to a sea foam. Smells like butterscotch tropical fruits citrus burnt sugar cane and some fresh ganja. Taste is crazy the bitter is there but not overwhelming it does destroy the palate though. Hard to describe but I see where people get onion and garlic but I can't say I agree. The alcohol is obvious the pine and citrus hop are there also other American hops rolled in zesty seasoning, toast, tobacco, skunk weed and fried sugar. Then you get the turnoff of earwax and cologne. the mouthfeel is soft then it sits under the tounge heavy with bitter and the unpleasant flavors fade until the next sip. Overall not overly bitter but freakin odd."
"Overall a very delicious beer. I would recommend it to anyone who really loves hops."
"O: very happy I tried this yet I want to see what happens with age. Definitely want to take a second look at this one."
"Cheers to Founders for making a triple ipa!"
"Overall: My first """triple IPA""". An extremely tasty, complex IIPA. Just enough sweetness to provide a sense of balance. I can see why this one was so sought-out. Just wish availability hadn't been so limited."
"O - Well its certainly very hoppy, and I like hop monsters but this seemed unrefined. Maybe more time or another flavor note or two would do some justice."
"12oz. bottle served in a Duvel Tulip. Poured a clear amber with a finger of off white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Seemed to be bottle conditioned. Big hoppy aroma of pine, weed and onions. Lots of malt, fuller side of medium bodied. Plenty of hop bitterness to round out the sweetness. Very aggressive. More of that onion flavor which I didn't particularly enjoy. Very drying finish from the hops. Way over the top, this didn't do much for me."
"O: This beer is HUGE! Huge hops and malts. I guess that why it is said to be a TRIPLE IPA! I though it was very well made."
"Re-visit: I just cracked a bottle with 8 months on it. The more delicate tropical hop elements are all but erased, but there's still a ton of bitterness. Very spicy and peppery. Even reminiscent of chipotle. This is one of the only beers I've ever had that could go step for step with habanero in a spicy dish."
"O - This is the first """triple""" IPA I have had, but I would like a bit more balance in the malt department. The hot, peppery alcohol flavor is to be expected, as well as the bitterness (obviously). It lacks the toasty and citrus flavors to counter. The feel is excellent, however."
"Very oily hop mouthfeel and a good measure of alcohol to boot. This one delivers as advertised. Top notch, once again, from Founders."
"This is a tough beer for me to rate. On the one hand, I did enjoy it as a whole, perhaps solely because it truely is a unique experience. But when I really had to think about each category there were definitely flaws, some of them pretty substantial. For one, at a certain point it seems like drinking more is pointless because it truely does a number on your palette. That being said, this is a beer that I wouldn't mind seeing the same vintage of down the road a bit."
"D: i like the concept, actually love it, but this really needs some more time. maybe it got too close to room temperature to let the heat shine through too much? who knows, but it feels like im drinking a fine scotch rather than a beer. very mixed feelings right now."
"O: HEAVEN."
"O - Dissappointed with this to say the least. Paid $6.95 for this and it was a waste. I want a hop bomb, or some oily pine notes, something. Instead I get something that is boozy and just sweet and bitter. Definately would like to try this next year, but not if I have to pay for it."
"this is quite the balanced barley wine with a depth that is accentuated by the mouthfeel. Had it with a founder's cent along side and it had a similar density, except with a continuously expanding palate dimension. Nice apricot nose that gives way to hemp... A tad oily. Palate of citrus fruit and pine sap... Bitter of a intensely accurate dandalion green and cannibus. Excellent reduction of the palate to a light tingle. So sharp its like drinking perfume. Very drinkable when fresh."
"Drink- Overall another big time DIPA. Glad I got to try this one. A bit hard to take down and a little spicier than I was hoping. Not as smooth as some other."
"Edit: had this beer again, but out of the bottle, and it tasted like onions-don't know why the previous tasting was soo good. Let down!"
"Not sure what is going on with this beer. Had high expectations. Struggled to drink just one. Love Founders but they missed with this one. For 18 bucks a 4 pack this should be much much much better. I kept waiting for it to get better as it warmed but that did not happen. Looks like you either like this beer or you don't. No middle ground. Disappointed to say the least."
"Overall: A very tasty, complex, and interesting beer. It is very in your face but still pretty drinkable. It has instantly become one of my favorite Imperial IPA's."
"O- I have really liked the other Founders brews i've tried, but this one isn't for me. Too much malt and the odd off-flavor for me to enjoy. Worth a try, but not worth the price. Almost seems like a Barleywine in some aspects."
"O: This is a really nice Imperial IPA. This has an extremely high ABV which makes this a sipper. I probably could only have one in a evening but would have it again without a doubt."
"O - Everything else is there to make it a worthwhile brew but the taste honestly is a mess. The appearance is great, the feel is ok, I can see why people like the smell. But all in all, I doubt if I will even make it through this whole thing. I tried it, glad I did. But definitely not my cup of tea."
"Overall, this one is pretty potent and a bit hard to drink. However, I did enjoy it, but I am glad I had josssmith to share it with me. Thanks to McNuts for this extra."
"O Quite an intense beer. Lots of flavor and an absolute palate wrecker."
"overall, a unique beer, i'll give it that, but not my cup of (triple) IPA; definitely not one of the better offerings i've had from founders. 3 more in the 4pk..."
"Yes, I know I am reviewing a year old DIPA. I usually prefer my IPAs and DIPAs on the mellow side anyway. I will bet this is one hoppy son of a bitch fresh. Worth a try."
"M/O: Good crisp beer but i wanted some more carbonation to really bring out the flavor. The flavors all work but the beer didn't have the characteristics I was expecting with the style. Slightly flat."
"But my God, it smells. For that reason alone, this beer gets high marks. Buy one to smell it. It smells it smells it smells."
"O- this is a great beer from Founders, but i think if i had to choose this or a Double Trouble it would be an easy decision....DT."
"This beer is nearly flawless and wonderful. Likely worth the high price tag if you enjoy plenty of hops."
"Overall-- quite enjoyable, but I couldn't drink this everynight! It is much better on tap than out of the bottle. (much fresher and hoppier tasting)"
"I’m a fan of hop-forward and even ludicrously hoppy beers, and Devil Dancer absolutely qualifies as both. I can’t imagine Founders expects anyone to drink more than one at a time. I can’t say I didn’t enjoy it—in some ways I did, very much—but to call it a “sipper” is an understatement; this is a commitment, a test of endurance, even a dare. Either way, I’m glad to see Founders doing something so experimental and challenging."
"O: What a unique experience. A triple IPA is a cool idea, but ultra-hops aren't enough to distract me from this beer’s most extreme pitfalls. Too sweet, too thick, too rough; ever heard the saying “too much of a good thing?” That’s exactly what I’m talking about. Now, while it didn’t exactly sit well with me, it was way different than any beer I’ve ever had. This beer was all about taking chances, and that’s what Founders does best. Ah, originality – now that’s something I can drink to. When I do, though, I probably won’t be drinking this! Once dance with the Devil is enough for me..."
"O- This beer is disappointing, I had it a while ago with a good amount of age on it and it was a lot more balanced and enjoyable. This is a very strong unbalanced IPA, glad I saved money and only bought one bottle, I have no plan on drinking another one until the next batch is released."
"Overall, not a bad beer, but not worth the asking price. However, it's quite drinkable and may appeal to many who like extreme beers."
"Overall, not my favorite beer ever, but drinkable. I've got a few bottles that I'm going to try out at different intervals"
"Overall, I love onions don't get me wrong but onion flavored beer, C'mon guys. I had Founders brewing on one of the highest tiers and now they have dropped a few notches. Next year i know what to avoid...Booo"
"O: this beer is a top 10 - it is strong (12% abv), rich, and flavorful. I actively sought it out and depleted all my local distributors - consuming what I bought enthusiatically - I recommend that you do the same when it's available"
"Overall this is an interesting beer, very malty and even more hoppy. Both are overdone in my opinion. The hop profile is good, there are some great aromas in there, there is just too much of it. Same goes for the malt bill, I have had barley wines with less malt. The body needs to be thinner and there needs to be more carbonation to help all the flavors dance on the palate, it is called devil dancer after all."
"I would share this beer with someone for the IBU experience, but this is probably my last time purchasing it for individual enjoyment. It tastes like a sweeter Nugget Nectar with 300 times the amount of hops."
"O - Interesting, intriguing, and definitely something I wanted to try, but I am very happy that I bought this as a singleton. If I dropped the near-20 on the 4 pack I would be pissed."
"My suggestion: If possible, get just one bottle of this until you try it. Or share with friends. Won't buy again, but still fun to drink. Certainly not worth the price tag. I'm not going to bother buying another to age, but it will be interesting to see what happens."
"O: It is certainly quite the original brew, and while I enjoy it.. I think it might almost be better suited as an ingredient in cooking. This has such a strong onion/garlic flavor that it would be amazing in beer cheese soup or as part of a marinade."
"O. I am not sure what to make of this beer. The onion taste doesn't repulse me like it has with other reviewers, but this just isn't a beer I am dying to have more of. Glad I only bought one 4-pack but at the same time glad to have been able to try this stuff."
"Overall this is an awesome double IPA that you all should try."
"Odd scoring, but I've got some reasoning here. I rated the taste as a 5--exceptional. I do that literally: It is, by definition, an extraordinary beer. Unfortunately, I found the fruit notes on the palate too cloying for the earthy, resiny pineyness that should have carried the day IMO. As an excercise in brewing, Devil Dancer is incredible. As a beer, it seems to be part of the problem that is """Uber-hoppy""" beers. It's undeniably good, but it's not exactly for me."
"O: All in all a very well balanced triple IPA. Solid notes of English influence, blended with high octane hops, make this brew a winner. Nice to give it a try and will revisit each year, but not at the price and effort of tracking down."
"O - Overall it looks the part and doesn't smell too bad but I wasn't impressed with the flavor."
"O: very nice, not the best ive ever had but definitely still a good brew, taste could have been a bit better, it was slightly toned down"
"It's unfortunate there's no balance, because the appearance and aromas really got me excited. If they can find away to make this a balanced beer, it could be a real winner. I'm still glad I tried this one and totally understand why many people enjoy it. Not bad though.. what else would you expect from a """Triple IPA"""?"
"O: Although the average of the above scores is closer to a 3.5, I really thought that my overall impression of this beer is relatively low. I have had it annually for the past 3 years, and I really don't think I'll continue again next year. It's an interesting concept, but the specific hop and malt choices don't work well for my palate. I'd rather have a well crafted DIPA or two good IPAs any day over this brew."
"The mouthfeel is extremely syrupy with an average amount of carbonation. There is a thick film left in your mouth after every taste. Overall, this is just too powerful, too sweet and not really that appealing. Glad I picked it up to try it out, but won't be searching for more. If things were just a bit lighter and blended together better it could be a great brew."
"An intense hop experience. Bitterness is high, but not prohibitively so-this one has enough malt and enough booze to make the hops tolerable, and in the end its actually quite tasty. That said, I think it's worth purchasing just to smell it-the aroma is actually insane."
"O: Definitely an interesting experiment and if there ever were a Triple IPA, this would be right up there. Honestly I found it very similar to Hopsickle (another ridiculous hop bomb), though this one is stronger in ABV and in the malt - making it somewhat balanced. This would be way better if it weren't for that odd aftertaste that I felt really detracted from the flavor. Everything else was pretty stout though. If you don't like onions/garlic, avoid this beer."
"Appearance: 4.5/5; Aroma 3.5/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 4/5"
"After reading some of the reviews, I wasn't sure about this one. It's somewhat drinkable. Its kind of boozy but not too off putting. I probably wouldnt drink this again because it's not really my style but it was worth a try"
"I can respect everything about this beer, as it's clearly brewed for the massive hopheads. What I can't do is enjoy it. And I have loved many a DIPA, so it's not just the style. The massive level of alpha acids makes the beer taste like little more than a bitter onion bomb to me. And I like more complexity and flavor. An unquestioned drainpour."
"O- I have always been a fan of Founders, and a hophead, so I was a little disappointed, I didn't get to try it last year. I heard some bad things, but figured it was just people not ready for this much hop. Well, if it's true, throw me into that category, because the Summit hops were just too much for me. I like my hops citrusy, not harsh and oniony. Over all just not good. I could have finished it, but decided not to and poured out about 1/3 of it."
"Overall solid, I enjoyed it better than I would have predicted a triple IPA that broke the IBU scale; I'm not a bitter beer man."
"O- Had this last year and thought it was better then. Think I will let the other 3 bottles age for a year or so."
"A lot of clashing going on in a confusing battle and assault on the senses. A novelty beer to brag about trying, but not one to sip alone. This hop bite is medicinal and lingering for entirely too long. A definite oily, resiny, sticky, hop bomb."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down good and tastes great. It is a little bit of a slow drinker, but if you are a big DIPA fan, I think you will love this. Overall, I thought it was an awesome beer, and I am really glad I got the chance to try it. This is definitely worth checking out."
"$5.75 on one bottle well-spent. I hope I can find it again next year."
"O- This is no gimmick, the balance is a work of art in a bottle."
"-Cheers"
"Overall this is an absolute hop monster that still manages to taste excellent. Is it over done and over the top? Surely; however, it does get easier to drink with each sip. I recommend cellaring for a year or three to see what flavors arise as the hops mellow."
"Other than maybe to try on tap, I doubt I'll try this fresh again. At least with the 2011 batch. I'm very interested to see how a year of age would do with this (yes, age a DIPA..make that a TIPA). As said previously...seems more like a novelty beer than anything else. It's not an F, but a bit of a chore to drink through right now."
"Overall- It is worth trying, but it’s not the complete hop orgy I was hoping for. I can see where the onion flavor can be a total turnoff for some people, it’s not necessarily pleasant, but it doesn’t completely ruin the beer for me. Triple IPA is not an official style, but there are many other Imperial/Double IPA’s in the 8-10% ABV range that I would chose over this."
"INTERESTING, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
"Not even halfway through, and I'm already breathing fire. Potent."
"O-- Good but one dimensional. Smoke taste does little to help the massive grapefruit taste. hurts it really. It is a sipper and a good nightcap. Would I buy again? Doubtful due to the smoke in this. Needs to be brighter and more citrus I think."
"Had a lot of hopes for this beer coming off double trouble and it just didn't live up to it. For the price($22.00) there are better double/triple IPAS out there."
"Overall, this is not to my liking. I know they put a lot of effort into this and some people really like it. But this is one of the worst beers I've tasted in a long time. If you don't like summit, avoid this beer."
"Overall, I could probably only drink a little bit of this at a time cause it's just so massive. A truly sippers IPA, but for some people this beer must be a hop heads dream brew."
"Overall I love this beer, a perennial favorite for me!"
"Overall - Devil Dancer is a beer that is fantastic whether it be on tap, or found in a much sought after four pack. It has a great taste that any true IPA drinker will enjoy, and though it has a high alcohol content (12%-13% depending) it is not an overpowering characteristic of the beer as many would think. Highly recommended, and its a great beer for any beer lover to try."
"overall - try this one fresh, I deleted an old review because after having this fresh I realized that it is a different beer when it is fresh. Founders Rocks!"
"O: Damn good beer. One of the most complex beers I've ever had. Couldn't drink too many, but I like it a lot."
"Future outlook: Great stuff, but intense (and $$$). I'm glad to have 4, yet probably glad to only have 4. I'll get this again next year, as I should be recovered enough by then."
"Note: After finishing one bottle tonight, the bitterness is seeemingly never ending. A tongue scorcher."
" Now the challenge is to find more or wait until next July!"
"Good luck"
"Cheers."
"The pour is a very dark amber with small greenish/off white head (reminds me of the after product of fermentation in a carboy) that coats the rim of the glass. Hundreds of carbonation bubbles sit on the sides of the glass and wait their turn to race to the top. The smell is the strongest smell of hops of any beer I have ever drank. As soon as I cracked open the cap I got a rush of piney citrus through the nostril. Once I poured into a glass I could smell the hoppiness 5 feet away. I think this smell could be a turn off to some, but I love it. Whoa, this one is bitter, but I like that. I catch a floral variety of fresh hops and bitterness all alike. The alcohol is well masked for being 12% ABV. The mouthful is pretty thick and very carbonated. This beer has the most hop presence out of any beer I have ever had. The smell and the taste will explain the words hop and bitter. Being a hop head this beer is awesome, sort of a novelity in a sense, but I can see myself enjoy this beer every summer when it is released."
"Overall: A great example of Michigan ingenuity. Once again, bravo to Founders!"
"O: probably the most bitter IPA I've ever had, but it is balanced out and not overly sweet to do so."
"O- I am glad to have found this sold as a single from Tippin's Market in Ann Arbor. The price is kinda steep, but hey this is a Triple IPA and $5.75 is less than I paid for some other bottles of premium IPAs (Brewdog/Mikkeller) I will probably buy this again while it is in season. All around an excellent brew."
"What a brew this is! Poured out as a golden copper color, the head was thick and white at first. The head settles but leaves some white soapy looking suds on the glass. The smell is incredibly hoppy. Just an assault of hops on the nose, not too much else. The taste is the same way, it's super hoppy and bitter. I was expecting it to be pretty extreme but not this much. The mouthfeel isn't too bad really but it tingles a lot with every sip along with a warming booze feeling too. Overall it's fun to try, glad I did but holy crap! I may buy more one day."
"D - This will ruin your palate for pretty much anything afterwards, but it's a good beer that I'll be having several more of."
"O - For as many IBUs as this has and for the alcohol content, this is a good beer. It doesn't lack in taste and coats the mouth with flavorful hops. Perfect for a summer night and would go great with food."
"O: I thought this beer was good, but not great. While I like the bitterness that was employed in this beer I felt that there weren't enough subsequent flavors to compliment the rest of it."
"O- This is not a beer for the faint of heart, if you picked this up you probably know that. It's another exceptional specialty brew from Founder's. Now, if we could only get more of this, that would be amazing."
"p.s. the 2011 version is on the chalkboard as 13%, not 12%."
"Hops are very abundant throughout the whole experience of this beer. It pours a burnt orange color with an offwhite head. There is some lacing after awhile. The smell is 90% hop and 10% malt. The hop smell is flower and one can almost distinguish the different kinds of hops, but my nose isn't experienced to tell you what they are. The taste is mostly hops with some maltpoking in. There is a slight alcohol burn at theback of the throat. It leaves an almost peppery smell in my nose after I sip it. Overall this beer was a good experience and I will make sure to get it again."
"Sharp bitterness, some malt sweetness and alcohol bite. Nearly no hop flavor. Pretty much godawful. I'm a fan of big beers, maltiness, hoppiness, angry fusel alcohols, and sometimes all of them in combination, but there is nothing in this beer that screams """I did this right.""" It's not so much a battle of flavors as a gathering of some co-operative organization without a plan for action or a leader. Whose turn is it this week? Oh, mine? I thought it was Dave's turn this week..The price tag is the only thing that kept this from a drain pour. At least it's pretty dry for a 12% IPA."
"I'd probably lean more towards the 2011 as being slightly better, but it's difficult to compare since the 2010 was more like a hoppy barleywine and the 2011 like a super-hoppy DIPA. I think I may hang onto one of my 2011 bottles for a couple of years to give it more time for the alcohol and hops to fade a bit more."
"Devil Dancer pours a murky orange color with minimal head. No lacing to speak of. The nose is dank citrus hops and a huge malt presence. Taste follows with bitter citrusy hop notes at the forefront giving way to a pretty well balanced sweet malt bill mid-palate. the finish is sweet and juicy with a mild bitterness which lingers for a bit. Feel is medium to heavy with a fairly low level of carbonation. Overall this is another tasty offering from Founders. Glad for the opportunity."
"Overall, I got this beer because I've never heard it before, it's hard for me to get, and I just wanted to try it. I do like it, but I'm still processing it. I think it's worth trying, especially fresh."
"O- Such a fantastic beer. I had it fresh as well when it was first released and remember it being awesome. I'm sure it is a totally different beer after the aging. Either way, seek it out, drink a few fresh, and hold on to a few. Founder's just doesn't do bad beer."
"D - Pretty drinkable. The beer is big and heavy with lots of rich and complex flavors. It is also a bit booze, but overall, it fits into the big flavors well. Tastes like a super-hopped barelywine."
"O- I've had this a few times now, both fresh and aged, and this is the best batch so far. Super hoppy and bitter, with a great malt presence to make it well balanced. With an ABV of 13%, it's surprising how drinkable it is. Alcohol is only noticeable in the warming sensation in the throat. Pretty excited to see how this one ages. Different and definitely worth trying this year."
"THIS IS A REVIEW OF A 2010-1YEAR VINTAGE."
"O - Not my favorite. This just seems like an over boozed double IPA. Hops are minimal and the sweetness is overpowering and takes away from the drink as a whole."
"Pours a golden orange color with a big head that left behind some lace. Smells of sugar and a lot of hops. This beer drinks way too sugary and it makes the alcohol seem much hotter. Has a gritty feel to it. Pretty nice alcohol punch if that is your thing but it is not mine so hard to drink and merely average."
"D- hop bitterness, but none of the hoppy flavors. Too sweet for me. Age is the issue here I am guessing."
"Overall I liked it though and would like to try this beer again."
"D - It's high ABV, hot, and a lot of sugar. This one is just hard for me to get a ton down. It's solid, but hard to drink"
"This is a sipper for sure, and I usually feel a bit dehydrated about halfway through a bottle. Probably the last beer of the night as it is a bit of a palate wrecker."
"D: this beer is too heavy for my liking. Its not bad by any means, but seems to be heavy handed for the sake of being heavy handed and the result is something that is difficult to drink a lot of."
"Altogether this is a rich complex beer with lots of alcohol kind of tainting the beer. I like this beer, but the domination of the ethyl is a bit much."
"I find this beer to be worth the cost and a treat to drink. Yes, it is really full of citrus rind and oil but it is done in a pleasant way."
"Holds your nuts on this one, it's gonna bite."
"Overall, I have liked this beer for a very long time and just never got to rating it. It is tastey and the ABV is reasonably hidden, yet potent enough in flavor that you don't need more than one. Yum."
"Drinks scaringly easy, and I would hate to see myself if I ever had the opportunity to buy a case of this. "
"D: Like this one pretty good but not really over the top for it. I would get this one again if I had the chance but I wont be running around to find it."
"I had Devil Dancer at the Founders event at Big Hunt in DC. It poured with a cloudy orange colour and although it didn't have much of a head, it maintained good lacing. It has a delicious, sweet, orange smell that made me want to drink it immediately. The flavour was initially tangy and orange then some tangy, bitter orange rind flavours kicked in. Throughout, there was a delicious tang in the back of my mouth. The bitter hoppiness built as I drank more. My glass was nice and thick in my mouth but lacked carbonation. I love was double IPAs, and this was really delicious: one of my favourites of the style."
"Recommendation: I'd suggest that you don't try this beer until you are about 3 years into your craft beer experience. It's just too hoppy and sampling this earlier in your beer career might scare you away from craft beer. This is a good beer for a once a year sampling and 8oz. may have been a bit too much. If you happen to have a bottle of this I'd split it between at least 2 people."
"This brew has a very nice drinkability. Though the high ABV might be a turn away for some beer drinkers, its hidden really well in this brew and gives it a nice warming bite. This brew has over 10 different styles of hops, its makes this brew a hops lover dream. Another great brew by Founders."
"Fairly thick mouthfeel with low carbonation, syrupy to some extent which makes this a sipper. But definitely a good beer after a night of packing when its in the single digits outside."
"Appearance is dark burnt orange with a one finger head. It smells like grapefruit, orange, along with other citrus accents, some spice as well. Taste has hops, caramel, malt, sticky pine in the finish. MF is fairly strong, not too much carbonation. With a high ABV and the general richness of Devil Dancer, it is a task to drink just the one. That being said, it was interesting to try."
"D - I don't think I'd sit down and drink a few bottles of this. It's a good chaser though to a lighter beer as a start and then move to this."
"2011: Had two 8oz glasses at the brewery. It had a just awful aroma which was somewhat onion-like as is frequently mentioned. Taste however is solid. It's also seemingly far more hoppy this year (yes it's possible), and was probably the first beer I can think of that I wouldn't want to have any more hops. Not a drink to take lightly."
"Edit: had the 2011 version within a month of bottling. Found the beer to be better than I originally thought. Still sticky and piny a bit boozy, but probably 4 across the board this time around."
"Overall impression: Glad I tried it, but I'll take a pass next time."
"Overall the beer is great. It lets the hops shine by allowing their bitterness and flavour to pass through in the taste while keeping it in check with the sweet malts. I've had more bitter beers, but this was great. Certainly worth trying another."
"little improvement but other than that this is one that hop lovers should look out for."
"Pours a bright orange/copper color with a huge frothy white head that never fades and leaves a huge amount of lacing on the glass. Great pour. Nose is dominated with hops and citrus fruits. Very sweet smelling and really overpowering. Taste is smooth for the 12% abv. Lots of citrus, floral, and breads up front with a huge hop bomb that finishes the quaff. Unbelievable DIPA. Mouthfeel is full bodied with hops that dance on the tongue. Drinkability is solid. Obviously the 12% diminishes this category slightly but still an amazing beer."
"Drinkable when you seek out a true palate wrecking beverage, but not for amateurs and not my first choice for drinking more than one. With that said, it's a very tempting diversion."
"D: Definitely a sipper and not something of which I would drink more than one. A good beer to enjoy slowly on a cold day."
"Marry me, Devil Dancer."
"D: A sipper for sure, but good, just not an IPA. I'm actually sort of baffled as to why they call this an IPA. The amount of malt required to balance out the comical and gimicky amount of hopping here makes this actually a pretty standard barleywine resting on the hoppier side of the genre ... but that's common these days. As an IPA it's sub-average, as a barleywine ... it's about average."
"This is an experience as much as a beer and it is a great one."
"Wow, the alcohol is HOT on this beer! Reminds me of the hotness of DFH 120 minute, begging the question -- would this [IPA] age well at 12%? The beer is dry-hopped for 29 days with 10 varieties of hops, and ends up with 112 IBUs. Awesome. The carbonation is a little heavier than I would expect a 12% beer. Aroma is.... malty. Heavy, alcoholic malts. Taste? Heavy, alcoholic malts. Very bitter. It may sound like I'm beating down on this beer, but sipping this like a port wine makes this much more enjoyable. Yeah, maybe I could sit for a few more minutes to sip and sniff this beer, but guessing ingredients would be a dart throw, and I never win cricket. I think I'll try to cellar one of these after sending the rest to share with my friends. I'd like to see if flavors develop and alcohol loses bite. It may seem like my score is low, but I enjoyed this beer."
"EDIT-Upon consultation, I've adjusted the drinkability number down. This beer is, err, not good."
"I thinks this is a cool beer to have, to really see the edge of what you can do with hops, but not simply over the top in one edge. Can't think of a more hoppy beer out there that I like. It isn't subtle, but not a one dimensional sledgehammer either. Wish I had more of these to age, but I got 2 this year (thanks oreo, this and nemesis as an extra? Awesome dude) and have now drank them both w/in about 60 days of getting them."
"Purchased this at Oak Tree Buy Rite in S. Plainfield, NJ. Into a stemmed Stone glass, it poured a cloudy copper hue, with two fingers of offwhite head that retained very well and laced very little. Little visible carbonation. Smelled of grapefruit, caramel apple, sweet raisins, and maybe a little pineapple, with a definite alcohol presence. In the taste, malty caramel apple raisin gives way to a bitter dry peel finish, with a LOT of alcohol evident. Smooth, no carbonation, yet viscous thick. Good for sipping; there is NO way you could slam this down."
"Beer is thin to medium bodied and in your face bitter. the back palate is overwhelmed by bitterness and it creeps forward into the mid palate. 112 IBUs or whatever, I believe it. I really do. Its aggressive, a little sweet up front, you miss out on all the nice hop flavors in the midpalate unfortunately. I've had much much better IPAs in the past."
"D: Too much for more than 1. I would not buy 4 again, but I'd order a pint sometime. Too high ABV for more than 1."
"Clear copper-orange pour with quickly fading head and decent lacing. Big hoppy, floral, citusy nose that reminds me of a barley wine. Lots of orange and caramel with a hint of pine. The taste is huge, sticky, resiny bitterness right from the start. Tons of grapefruit and pine with sweet caramel malt trying to emerge, but it's quickly overcome by the puckering bitterness of this awesome hop bomb. Slightly syrupy, sticky and oily and the warmth of the alcohol is definitely present, but it's disguided really well for a 12% brew. It's about as drinkable as a beer this big can be. It's a sipper for sure, but I almost wanted another when I was finished. Once again, Founders doesn't disappoint!"
"Fairly full bodied, very sticky and syrupy, wraps around the tongue and refuses to let go. Very slow and almost tough drinking throughout, as the 12% seems highly apparent and overdone. I love founders but this is just too much."
"Drinkability: I like the fact that it was more balanced than hop bomb, but by making it so huge I think some possible complexity was lost. Even with all of the different varieties of hops used, I was only able to extract a few flavors. Also, it goes without saying that at 12% ABV, this is a sipper."
"Great triple IPA from Founders."
"I can't read the bottled on date as it's a bit screwed up, it looks like 11/10, but that's clearly not the case as I bought it on the 6th of november in MA."
"The out-of-balance hop presence, combined with the 12.00%abv will keep you from reaching for this one over and over. A very great every now and then kind of beer."
"D: I told myself last year that I should try it again before writing it off for good. I did, and I have. I don't know what people like about this beer, but it's not for me."
"- Overall very hoppy.. very malty, and super drinkable... the heat is no where in sight.. a very strong brew... with the ability to sneak up and knock you on your ass. Very good."
"Back to previous glory. The 2011 I drank fresh was awful. Thought I had a bottle infected with garlic and onions until I saw similar responses from many ba'ers. To be fair it settled down and was a fine beer after a few months. This year is great fresh."
"Cheers!"
"Tastes more like an American barleywine to me."
"d- it took me more then an hour to finish, the weigh and depth tickling my brain... i could drink this beer until my eyes closed... absolutely dreamy!"
"The complexity of flavors are so interesting that you can't help but want to take another sip. However, the intense hops and dense body make it difficult to drink more than one bottle. All I've got to say is savor it with the utmost care and respect as it could very easily kick your ass. Definitely a must try for adventurous hop lovers. I would love to try it one tap."
"Overall, complex, sinister, abusive and delicious."
"D - I wouldn't be able to make it through a second, but not too bad for one. It's a little bit of a mess but has a bunch of flavor."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. Clear copper with a sticky 1 inch head. Ton of pine on the nose, also some alcohol and caramel. It has enough malt to make it balanced, even a bit sweet. Lots of piney resin, nice long bitter finish. Definitely full bodied, the mouthfeel is very sticky and resinous. A damn fine beer, thanks to bauermj for this one."
"Pours a translucent, somewhat hazy orange amber with a minimal head - which may be an artifact of the pour - and just a little lacing. Fruity aroma has undertone of malt and a hint of caramel. Flavor is fruity and citrusy with a malty tone and a caramel hint. Texture is fairly smooth and subtly fizzy."
"Not something I'd want all that often, but I have to give props to Founders for such an intense, extreme IIPA varient."
"Devil Dancer tastes and feels like a smoky camp fire on a beautiful cool autumn evening"
"This is my third time drinking this beer (one left). I respect the effort and it's alright if you're in the mood for extreme. On the other hand, for me it's nowhere near being good enough to justify the high price. No thanks."
"Drinkabilty - You cant drink this every day. this would ruin you for sure. And, there are better High end ipa's out there. This beer sacrifices taste and flavor for just extreme hops. I would like to drink this with less alcohol and hops, and more malts and spices. And, its expensive on top of it"
"D - Something i could sip on for a while but a very good beer."
"I bow to Founders once again."
"Drinkability suffers here because of the alcohol on the tongue. Honestly is just overloads your palate with so much, that I have to carefully sip my way through one of these! For a Trip IPA and 12% ABV though.... I would put it above average though..."
"The beer pours an orange color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of flowery and pine-scented hops. The flavor is more complex and is very hoppy. I get a lot o citrus and pine notes as well as some caramel malt. The bitterness is about medium and is not as bitter as I was expecting. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"The beer is a deep orange-amber color with a thin off-white head that fades very quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. The aroma is of hops, brown sugar, citrus and caramelized malt. The taste is balanced, but hits you very hard with everything up front, with flavors of hops, brown sugar, caramel and some fruit. There's a slight touch of alcohol, but not as much as you would expect from a beer with 13.00% ABV. The malt character is decent but The after-taste is hoppy and slightly bitter. Crisp and very smooth, medium body, light-to-medium carbonation, clean and dry finish."
"Where so many other super hops beers have a grating roughness, this beer is amazingly smooth. Slightly turbd ruby/amber with sticky head. Aroma is cotton candy and muted herbal hops. Sweet, but not sticky-sweet and appropriately balanced for the massive hops load. Resinous wihthout pine notes, and a distinct bite of alchohol near the end. Best to keep this monster at a cooler temperature, as the alcohol note grew a bit too sharp near the end as it warmed."
"Well it's all tongue ripping hops here. The flavor is very herbal, almost medicinal with a mellower citrus back end. It difficult to describe this in any way that's not just super hoppy. My tongue cannot separate any distinct flavors. Overall I think this well be better as it warms but it might actually be too hoppy for a repeat visit. Mouth feel and body are fine."
"Regardless, Founders has shown their talent in this one. A lesser brewery could make such an evil concoction, but only a master could fashion something so difficult that also manages to be absolutely delicious. This is a tough ale. But it deserves it's name and it's place."
"D: This is a stronger beer, being 12% ABV and the drinkability, although a smooth beer, is low, as expected. Overall this is a very good beer, I love the hops with a mix of sweet malt."
"Pours a clean orange-ish/copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, mellow pine like hops. In the taste, pine like hops and a quite balanced maltiness. A small bitterness, but mainly smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry pine hop in aftertaste. Hides the alcohol, mellow for how big it is, quite nice."
"Devil Dancer pour a rich, deep orange, nearly entirely opaque. The head only comes to about a finger in height (off white), but sits there for an impressive amount of time before slowly fading. Lack of lacking is the only real letdown as far as looks go. The nose is a huge blast of caramel and resiny, piny hop goodness, fantastic. Each sip brings exactly what the nose promised, along with a monstrous (but given the prevailing sweetness, not overbearing) hop bite, and slight (but not entirely unpleasant) alcohol burn. Devil Dancer tastes like Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA's little brother, and that's meant to be a compliment. The body is thick, nice and syrupy, which is all one can expect from an IPA this big. Carbonation is on the low end, which works for this style. I'm impressed, for a beer this big and packing this much flavor Devil Dancer drinks pretty damn easily. The alcohol, while present, doesn't become a hindrance. Bravo to Founders for crafting a (triple) IPA that approaches crossing the line into being over the top without doing so. Too much of an experience to be a regular treat, but something I can drink every once in a while and enjoy very much."
"D: I mean, what can I say.. this beast is 12% abv!! Considering it's strength, it can be considered drinkable, but honestly, this is a VERY slow sipper that crushes your palate. I feel like I'm still going to taste this when I wake up, even after I brush my teeth."
"D= This one is one that is a great beer but you don't want to drink to many of them in one sitting. This is a good sipping beer."
"D: Too intense for me, I'm not going to lie, but at 4 months old I think it's balanced out the sharp alcohol and maintained the hoppiness pretty good."
"D- pretty intense beer; not very high drinkability in terms of more than one in an evening and in terms of seeking it out seasonally, but definitely a really nice one to try"
"D - This is more drinkable then I imagined for a 12% big brew. Everything is well balanced and the alcohol adds more flavor then booziness. """When you dance wit the devil, the devil don't change...""" indeed..."
"My first triple IPA! Pours a hazy, deep golden brown, with hints of a lighter orange/tangerine around the edges. Couple fingers of offwhite head, and massive, thick and chunky lace. Minimal retention. Aroma is grapefruit, pine and oranges, alcohol peaks through a touch also. Hops are huge here, some dark breadiness as well. Alcohol becomes more prominent with warmth. Malt hits immediately, slick and sweet, very caramel-like. Fruits are hot on its tail, and a wave of alcohol arrives. Seeing as this has been sitting around for quite a bit, it feels as if this almost approached barleywine territory here. Malt is quite sweet here too, and although I heard some people claim that this takes away quite a bit from the beer, I have no problem with this. Many have also claimed that this is an absolute palate wrecker, and although I agree to a degree, I've had suffered more at the hands of other beers (this however may be a function of the bottling date). Does some substantial damage as well. Mouthfeel is a bit slick and sticky, with medium carbonation, and surprisingly reasonable drinkability given the 12% ABV. Mouthfeel became quite a bit stickier and syrupy as it warmed too. One is probably enough for the time being however."
"D: Very thick sipping beer."
"Have to admit I'm a little taken back as this really doesn't live up to what I expect from Founders. Not that it's bad (I managed to finish it) but I can't say I enjoyed it and wouldn't seek it out again. It seems only a handful of these massive, high alcohol 'Triple' IPA's turn out well. I guess even a consistently great brewery can fall short from time to time."
"On tap at Aromas in Athens. Poured into a snifter. Oily, resinous, sticky, clear lacing. Aroma is seemingly dominated by PINEAPPLE! Fascinating!!!! Really, really fascinating. Taste is juicy and malty sweet and bitter all blended together. Amazing masking of abv. What can I say? Style points. Delicious and exciting and unique."
"NOTE: The website says that this one """ages with the best of them.""" I think that if you aged this one too much, it might turn into a Barleywine. I could be wrong."
"FFO Dogfish Head 120 Minute, Southern Tier UnEarthly and other East Coast IIPA's."
"M: full bodied, especially for the style,"
"D - HAHAHAHA 12% Triple IPA...good luck. This is a sipper, a good sipper but a sipper none the less. Unlike any IPA I have ever had. This is probably similar to a Sink the Bismark type beer. Great stuff but its not a daily drinker."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Smooth and mildly efferevescent, its texture is very easy for the strength and style. The wickedly bitter finish dries the mouth completely, a devilish *cough* example of what hops are capable of when added by the truckload."
"Drinkability: A decent beer from Founders, not my favorite, but definitely one I'll get again, especially on draft."
"D- for the ABV, it is very drinkable, i'd say its possible to have a few in an evening depending on one's tolerance. this is just a great IPA. i can't get over how smooth it is for the ABV."
"D- One and done for sure. Seems to be bordering on barleywine territory. This one seems ageable but a lot of hops would be lost. I rarely say this but it might be way to boozy, even for me."
"Thoughts* I think this is a great beer. I like a balance of sweet and hoppy IPA's but I dont think they should label it as a triple IPA. DIPA would be more suitable."
"With VDubb's urging, I delve into a """triple IPA""". It pours a hazy orange amber with only a small layer of bubbles functioning as a head. The nose comprises a somewhat balanced effort between heavy pine notes (both needle and sap) and thick, sweet caramel. Neither side o'ermatches the other without input from the latter. The taste isn't much of a change of pace, though here the piny notes really start to assert themselves on the back end. The caramel doesn't go without a fight, though. The body is a heavy medium, with a moderate carbonation and a thick, gooey feel. Overall, a decent hoppy IPA, but not something to indulge in too often."
"D- Well I can't imagine drinking more than one of these. Not only is the ABV extremely high but the hops pretty much determine your pallet for the rest of the evening. If you going to open one up, make sure you have a free evening."
"Pours a dark copper color with a lasting white head. Aroma starts with sweet malts and finishes with a deep hop character, but not a crisp, citrusy hop? Hard to describe. Sugary malts are immediately counteracted by resinous, cloying/sticky hops, citrusy unlike the aroma. Smooth and very easy drinking for the ABV. Deceptive. After drinking this monster, I tasted the viscous hops on my lips several minutes after. 1 of these at a time is enough for me....but what a wonderful beer."
"Overall, an average to good IPA that really disappointed. One of the few Founders misses for me. Way too sweet and the alcohol was too present. And it lacked hops! Not avail here in TX so got one during my Indy trip and shipped back. Rotation - if avail near me: I might try one again if I could get right after the release so the hops were at the freshest but other than that one is enough. [N;N]"
"Overall, an extreme yet balanced triple IPA. Definitely not something I would call sessionable, but I found the experience enjoyable. Definitely a beer that needs to be tried."
"I understand referencing other brews while reviewing may be taboo, but, to give someone an idea of the flavor: imagine a dry hopped 12% Raison D'etre."
"O - Disappointing coming from founders. Seems like they tried too hard with the hops."
"Poured a orange to amber color. Very thin head, Citrus smell. Wow, this is definately a hopped up barley wine. bitter, malty, sticky sweet. alcohol is present. While I think this is a great beer, I couldn't drink too many of these. maybe some cellaring would tame this one."
"D: Each sip invites the next. Not a super complex beer, but one that struts its stuff quite well."
"Another delicious creation by Founders. I am not sure you could pack much more bitterness in an IPA. Cheers!"
"D - This one grew on me as I got half way through it. It is a very in your face beer but mellows out a little as you drink it. I would love to try this again and even more so on tap. Not my favourite imperial IPA, but a very good one."
"This is a dangerously drinkable TIPA!"
"D: I'm really enjoying this. The alcohol is present but not overwhelming, even at 12%. The profile changes dramatically as it warms; it actually seems playful. I'll be looking for this again."
"D - Well at 7.50 a pop it isn't an unreasonable cost to pay for the experience of trying a triple IPA but understandably it really is too much to pay for it repeatably. Also I really do not appreciate dry hopping enough to really enjoy this beer. I know it was a lot of effort to produce a beer like this and I enjoyed it regardless of repeated consumption."
"Appearance 4, Smell 4, Taste 4.5, Mouthfeel 3.5, Overall 4.5, Score 4.28"
"Drinkability: This beer is drinkable, but i would age it or at least let it sit open for a while to mellow. the bitterness and booze overpowers this. This one is very fresh and really needs time in the bottle. Drink this like a whisky, or a fine cognac in slow sips as its just too powerful and boozy right now."
"I actually like this pretty, very strong, a hop head must, but for sure worth trying."
"Tried this on tap, had nice solid rust color never had a triple IPA so i was expecting it be harsh... and it was not at all but you could not have more than one. it is a 12% beer very strong very good. I highly suggest more people get out there and try to track this bad boy down as im sure if anyone is from jersey on here good beer is not hard to find but you gotta drive around and look for the good ones"
"Notes: Not really drinkable, sadly. It's very heavy and you can taste every bit of the 12% ABV. I actually found it to be rather syrupy and cloying, most likely a result of the super high ABV. I split a 10oz and felt that was too much. For me, one sip was enough."
"Finger plus of deep tan foam with an orange tint, pretty good density but has a lot of larger bubbles which hampers retention, slow and steady dissolve the lacing more thick streaks than """lace""" per se. Burnt reddish orange color, close to brick-like, clear and close to full transparency, close to zero bubbles visible inside the glass (as opposed to outside the glass). Drives into your nose like a pick, even the ample honey, caramel and pine sap can't lessen the brunt of the highly herbaceous hoppiness and sour white to pink grapefruit, close to having a salty saline quality, the pineapple, nectarine, mango, papaya, kiwi fruit scents leaden and gluey, leaves you suspecting that there's more complexity under the massive density but you're not getting much of it. Full-bodied is putting it """lightly," hard to imagine an IPA more densely packed, little sense of movement, impressive if tiring. Pink grapefruit, tangerine, mandarin orange all juicy if not quite vivid. The nectarine, guava, mango, pineapple, apricot fruit steamrolled by the bitterness of the hops, so hard to focus on anything but those hops. Still, there's some molasses and brown sugar as well as pine, can't say it's that floral, would require airiness for that. I respect pushing the envelope but this is too over the top and just very hard to enjoy in its immediacy in your mouth."
"D - Definitely on the lower end of the style. It's a huge beer with lots of sweetness that doesn't lean towards explosive hop flavor like a lot of other DIPAs. I can't imagine having more than one. It's not at all my preference for DIPAs(I completely prefer Double Trouble), but it's distinct and I can appreciate what Founder's is doing."
"O: Very good strong IPA. Amazing aroma and sure to impress any IPA enthusiast."
"D: Not enough carb and a big alcohol punch make this beer drinkable, but not super enjoyable. A bit of a letdown. Aged a few years this would make a heck of a barleywine. Right now it's just an okay DIPA."
"D: This is about as drinkable as a 12% """Triple IPA""" can come. The alcohol is very evident in the smell and taste as the beer warms, but the balance between hops and malts is struck phenomenally well."
"O: Very nice DIPA. I'm glad I have the opportunity to have his on tap because the four packs are a bit of an investment. Not to say it's not worth it though, any hop head would be happy to have this brew."
"Overall,a powerfull, flavorfull, nicely balanced smooth sipper of a """North Coast""" Imperial IPA that will crash through the woods and destroy your campsite-if you're not carefull. Drink with caution!"
"Drinkability: Not one of Founder's strongest, but definitely sippable. I would prefer a triple IPA to have more hop character.."
"7/25/10. After a recent trip to MA I finally get to try my first Devil Dancer. Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Duvel Tulip. Appearance is a viscous brownish gold with very little lacing. I smell a faint hint of hops... Seriously though, hop aroma is overwhelming. Pine, citrus and some caramel. Boozey. And the taste is more of the same. Tastes like hops, hops and more hops. Super bitter pine and citrus peel. Some earth and booze as well but the bitter piney hops are the star here. Delicious. Heavy mouthfeel for the style. Reisnous. My palate is done. Glad I finally got a chance to try this beer and hopefully can get my hands on some more in the near future."
"Served from tap into an imperial pint. Pours red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of subtle malt and BIG hop notes. The flavor was of subtle malt with a MASSIVE hop bitterness/bite while not being overwhelming. It was heavy on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this on tap goes down MUCH smoother than out of the bottle (see my previous review). Everyone owes it to themselves to see what I mean by this. The appearance is very nice, the aroma is a bit lacking however, but it's a massive 'triple' IPA so of course the hops dominate. The big hop bitterness punishes your palate but still manages to go down smoothly oddly enough."
"NOTE: Just had a year aged bottle (bottled on 6/1/12) of this on 6/1/13 and it was sweeter and fruitier than I recall; the aging must have tamed the hops, but the alcohol stuck around in it's new mellow version to keep this beer true to itself. More pronounced sweet fruity flavors, like guava juice with syrup added in, akin to a barleywine. I like the flavor better aged, so I notched up the rating to reflect my appreciation of this triple IPA."
"D - always make room for one, maybe two of these at most during the release each year. if any beer is worthy of the """Triple IPA""" label, its this one. not drinkable by any means thanks to an incredible harsh hop and boozy. while good, puts up a hell of a fight to finish in one sitting. a formidable opponent for even the biggest hop thrill seekers."
"D: One at a time ... As a triple IPA @ 12% ABV,I don't know many who are drinking more than one at a time."
"A deep red rue with orange overtones that shines clearly through my Duvel tulip. A nice grapefruit citrus bomb with malt and touch of booze. The taste is a fantastic balance of sweet malty Founder goodness, thick, creamy, biscuit with lots of hops, its bitter, really bitter, lots of clean pine backed by citrus and followed by more piney citrus goodness. The mouth-feel is nice. I am really starting to love the hop resin as it takes over my mouth and makes my palate feel as if hops had seeped up into my flesh. The malt backbone is thick enough and creamy enough to hold onto all the hoppy goodness. The carbonation is 4 to a 3.75 out of 10, kinda minimal but it serves this big beer well. The drinkability of this beer is present, I believe I could drink this beer all night long, I however prefer to savor beers that are hop over-kill with small sips through out the night."
"Drank another one after waiting 2 months. Much more drinkable. Still bitter but has a much better balance. Almost barleywine, but a bit lighter. I really like this beer better now than fresh, but I'm a barleywine fan. Scent is malt rich now, and flavor still is dominated with hops with a strong bitter aftertaste, but the balance seems good. I now believe I could drink 2 of these in a sitting and maybe even want more. This time around the taste would bump up to 4.5 and drinkability would at least be 3.5."
"D: Well, certainly not a sessionable beer and a palette wrecker. It's not a bad beer and definitely better than DFH120, but still a little overly sweet for my tastes."
"drinkability: amazing. funny story.. My mother in law was sittign next to me and she suddenly said.. Hmm I smell grapefruits. I said smell my empty glass. She was amazed that that what she smelled."
"Much more drinkable than I thought it would be but still at 12% and 112 IBU's it is definately a sipper."
"D: Enjoyably harsh and almost difficult to drink, this one was a sipper, but the flavor profile encourage another sip. This beer is a fine example of hop overkill: just too much of a good thing. This beer would have benefited from a little moderation, though I will note that the high 12% was exceedingly well hidden."
"D: Only the second deemed """triple""" IPA I've had (that I distinctly remember), the other being Hopsickle. But this doesn't have the IPA feel - more like a barleywine with the sweet malts. A sipper for sure with the overwhelming alcohol presence, but this satisfied my craving for hops."
"D-The drinkability on this one is low,in general,but good for what I conceive the TIPA style should be.I was told to share this but I didn't listen.Definitely one and done."
"D = One and done at most. A nine ounce poor would be better."
"DB- I guess this is what a Triple IPA would be like, way too much hops and bitterness. I could probably eat a Jolokia pepper and still taste this on my palate afterward. I have to give credit for making such a thing but it is not my personal taste, too extreme. I really like the aroma but the flavor is too over the top. Worth a shot and this is probably the first IPA I would age because it probably could get better with less hop influence. Price is fairly high and the huge flavor makes this one not that drinkable."
"Drinkability: Fairly drinkable when considered alongside beers of a similar alcohol content. Even so, this beer decimates the senses and might wear me out before too long."
"this is double trouble on hops steroids..pours a nice slightly hazy copper orange color very little head and not alot of lacing..the smell is pungent hops and a plethora of pine and citrus..also smell caramel malts..the taste is smack in your face hops with pine needles then tropical fruits abound like mango and papaya last sweet caramel takes some of the hop punch away ..mouth feel is strong and dry and bitter/boozy but considering the ibu and abv and amount of hops what would you expect..3.5 on drinkability... would not want more than 1 ..still this is a good 3ipa worth trying its just not one i want alot.. however very recommended for a try..as it is tasty"
"A great beer, I wish it wasn't so expensive. I love DIPAs- but what makes this a triple IPA?"
"D-It's not that drinkable, even taking into account the 12% ABV. I can't see myself drinking more than 1 per night. The alcohol is very conspicuous. It is a nice sipper, but a palette wrecker. If you're looking for a hop fix, it won't let you down."
"Quite drinkable, but at the high price $$$$, I can think of several DIPA's and IPA's that are just as satisfying."
"D - Despite the high ABV and the odd blend of hop profiles in the taste, I think this one is quite drinkable."
"D: To be honest, I wouldn't have wanted more than 6 ounces of this. Pretty extreme in my opinion and not very drinkable."
"D-I really liked this beer, though I wouldn't want more than one at a time. It needs to warm up before you really get the full effect of this beer. Once again, Founders is impressive."
"When fresh, this is an intense hop experience. Don't let it sit long though."
"D: This is a good example of the style and a good example of why I am no longer in love with DIPAs. It is crazy to expect balance in a style that is all about zero balance, but that is what I would like. I would love to see some obvious/over-the-top dry-hopping to complement the bitterness. This is too big of a beer to think of reaching for another one, and is one dimensional enough for me to probably not pick up again. Very recommended for the hops lover who thinks that there is no such thing as """too bitter"""."
"D-For how high the ABV, the alcohol is really not noticeable, except the mouthfeel and the sweet alcohol notes in the taste. I find high alcohol Double IPA's to be a little hot, but that is not an issue here. I was expecting more from the nose and taste. The nose was pretty lackluster for how extreme their dryhopping was with this beer. I definitely don't think I could have more than one of these in a night."
"D Not that good. Whether I look at the 12% ABV or the 112 IBU's or the tremendous bitterness, I could only conceivably have one of these per night. That being said, I will provide a rating to the style, a triple IPA, which is not, in my opinion, a particularly """drinkable""" style. This beer was at least interesting to drink. 3.5"
"This is a monster of a beer, be careful with it."
"I couldn't drink many of these, but i feel very satisfied with one."
"D: There are so many flavors that seem to fight for attention that it almost is to much. The hops were equaled out with malts pretty nicely which made it easier to drink. It was a good beer that I could drink for some special occasions, however I wouldn't see myself drinking every night."
"The mouthfeel is full bodied and carbonation is moderate to low. Drinkability is pretty good, it had some great flavors to it but the alcohol came through a little too much to be overly drinkable for me. The hoppiness was nicely done though. Overall a pretty good beer."
"Overall as epic as advertised. Get this one on tap if you can. Not something you could drink more than one of but fantastic for sure."
"It's a good beer that is undone in the end by its own excesses."
"MF/D: VERY smooth while leaving a warm tingle. certainly not as eye-opening as many DIPAs ive tried."
"drinkability - one and done."
"D - I consider myself a """hop-head", but this is just too messy, too boozy, and too one-dimensional. Wish I had someone to split this with, this glass is gonna disappear slooowly."
"d- 6 oz is more than enough for me. i am more of a fan of the big hoppy ipas, (or triple ipas). not my cup of tea, but interesting and glad i sampled it. the $24 4 pack on the other hand, I'm not so sure about."
"D - Man this is some tasty stuff, nicely balanced and smells wonderful. Another great one from Founders, but definitely can't see drinking this all the time, it packs a wallop."
"Who in their right mind comes up with a beer like this? This beer is punishing to the drinker. Pours a radiant orangish amber color with a small head that did not hang around for long. A little sticky lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is the best thing about this beer. The hops give a big dose of citrus and tropical fruit aromas. There is a lot of alcohol as well giving this beer a rum-like charactor. What can I say about the flavor. One sip and my palate was shredded. The bitterness is extreme and lasts in the aftertaste forever. Combined with the huge alcohol flavor, makes this one tough beer to drink. The hop flavors are lost which is unfortunate. The body does its best to carry the IBUs and alcohol and there is a nice soft carbonation. Good texture. This beer in my opinion is hardly drinkable. Very tough when you have to force yourself to take another sip. Wish I just bought a single, now I have 3 more bottles to force myself through."
"d- ahhh. where I gave it great praise before, this one is nothing more than a sipper at best. some intense stuff. the praise here is for how much a really enjoy it and would love to get some more of this one in the future. I'd really like to try it SUPER fresh next year to get the absolute full effect. this bottle is bordering on a 5-6weeks old, so it's still plenty young."
"overall - very enjoyable beer. I'd recommend seeking this one out if you like DIPAs."
"Notes: This one is pretty rough on the mouth and I'm not sure if it knows what the meaning of balanced is, but if you are a hop head, seek this one out for sure. Enjoyed this one."
"d - A pretty nice beer. Lots of citrus and bitter hops in the smell and taste. Would try again."
"This beer is extreme. Must be a true """hop head""" to handle this one."
"All in all, this one was very interesting. I'd say calling it a TIPA was appropriate. It does not have the same flavors as a DIPA, but the strong hop IPA flavor is still very obvious as in a DIPA and standard IPA. The boozy character is definitely a lot more upfront than other IPA's. Definitely try this brew at least once. Worth hunting!"
"I would have to say that this is a pretty good DIPA. Although I would have liked it to be more bitter and dry, it still satiated my want for this style. Also, this was my first growler experience, and I'd say it panned out very nicely. An excellent beer, definitely worth seeking."
"D: One's (12oz. but even a 10oz. surrounded by other beers) enough, it's 12% for christ's sake. Slow down. Actually, I could probably drink another if there weren't three other stouty Founders stouts that I felt obligated to try that night."
"D-A monster of a beer that is best enjoyed FRESH IMHO. I like my hops and they are greatly enjoyed in this one before they start to fade and give way to the gargantuan malt bill. Hard to believe that this clocks in at 12%---it is frighteningly drinkable."
"Flavor is slightly dissapointing...but not bad. Let me explain. The IPA characteristics are just about gone in this one, and it's fresh. It's too much of a malty mess to be likened to an IPA...of course, understandably it's classified as a triple IPA. With this all said, it tastes very good...but sweet mostly, and a mild lagging hop bite that keeps throbbing. The malty thickness, or full body is just making this very interesting. This beer seems like it would be awesome aged, and basically a barleywine at that point. Finishes slightly dry. Carbonation is pretty high and booze is definitely noticable. Overall, very tasty...just different."
"Honey amber with a dense, creamy head of nougat colored foam that leaves rings of sticky lace on the glass. Tropical fruity, and piney hop notes are the first thing I notice in the aroma (I guess they use ten different hop varieties) with tons of caramel malt. Big, aggressive pine sap, citrusy hop flavors and caramel slathered on toast would probably be an accurate description of the flavors. This brew is more of a super hopped barleywine to my taste buds and is actually nice with some age on it. Full bodied with fine carbonation. A lot of people tell me this reminds them of DFH 120 minute but I disagree, this beer is not nearly the syrupy beast that 120 is at all (I like 120, it's just different) but is just a big, extreme beer. I was kind of bummed at how expensive it is this year but I think this is the best vintage in years. Good stuff."
"D: 12% ABV coupled with a disappointing mouthfeel means a one and done."
"A vigorous pour yields a finger and a half of tannish-red head, which stays for a few minutes leaving lacing on the glass similar to a root beer, if that makes any sense. I smell sweet malts, some caramel malts and a little bit of citrus hops once this opens up a bit. Taste is sweet malt at the front, slight hops in the middle and a nice bitter finish that lingers on for quite some time. To me this drinks more like a barleywine than an Imperial IPA, which when aged is expected but this is a fresh bottle. The mouthfeel is syrupy and sticky, feels good, real good. Drinkablility is not so high on this one, you should probably just stick with one bottle and sip it for an extended period. Very good beer, but I don't think it's as good as others I've had in this style."
"As drinkable is a triple IPA could be, definitely more on the IPA side than Barleywine side...thank goodness. Try the Devil Dancer sandwich. The only brew that will cut through the sandwich is this IPA which will cut through the amazingly spicy overload of flavor."
"Beware when you dance with the devil; her kiss is warm, intoxicating, and addictive."
"Having had this on draft first, I imagine my overall rating would be closer to 4.5. This brew performs considerably better in all categories on draft. It is actually a completely different experience."
"Update: The 2011 version smells and tastes of pure caramelized onions. It's hard to stomach and not nearly the beer it has been in the past. If I were to re-rate the beer I'd certainly give it a grade higher than a D."
"For what it is, the drinkability is good. But I would suggest splitting the first bottle with someone before opening one up alone."
"Highly over rated."
"D: Although it's not remarkable in any area, it is a pretty good beer. The almost immediate buzz makes it tough to put a few down, but one is easily consumed. Very enjoyable."
"I'll drink this one again from time to time, but it could be difficult to drink it regularly - just a total blast of overpowering palate wrecking hops - if that's your thing you will LOVE it."
"Fairly drinkable brew. Enjoyable for one, but having more would be dangerous and a bit difficult due to the full body. However, another nice offering from Founders."
"Notes: For my liking this remains in high DIPA territory, which is fine and would seem its goal, rather than developing into a complex sipper where the hops and malt turn it into a different beast altogether (120 Min for instance, which I also love). It works rather well as a muscled DIPA, as a triple, assertive, long and rich, probably over-hyped and often overpriced but it is quite the brew."
"This midwestern hop bomb lives up to its reputation, but it's not as overall enjoyable as Dreadnaught or one of the West Coast IIPA's. Glad I had it, though."
"D - A tad boozy, but very good. Would drink again."
"Pours a pretty amber color with a huge tight cream colored head that left a sheet of lacing as it disipated. The aroma is of fresh buddy hops, nice grapefruit notes. Man this smells like the icky sticky. Some candied tropical fruit notes as well. The taste is hops all around. From grapefruit and tropical fruit to pine and resin. There is an intense bitter character which adds some light chalky and asprin notes. The hops are supported by a fairly heavy caramel malt which adds a good amount of sweetness. This is a big ol bucket of hop juice, the profile really hits all across the board. The feel is somewhat thick, sticky, and slick. There is some tingly carbonation to help cut through the malt. The brew starts off sweet and end quite bitter. There is some noticable ABV burn that pops through here and there. A ridiculously hoppy beer but it works. The aroma is fantastic. I do enjoy most of the hop profile but the intense bitterness I could do without. Consider my tastebuds shot after this one."
"Overall, I love this beer. It's probably not for everyone and the high price tag will scare some away ($20/4pk) but for me it's worth every penny. Yum!"
"Nose is brown sugar, molasses, piney and citrus hops. Taste is citrus hops up front but lots of malt - caramel, brown sugar... then moving to a nice, dry, refreshingly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy for an IPA but not as sticky as I would have expected. Although it does get hotter as it warms (and I sip), you would not have a hint that this is 12%, so beware!"
"On-tap at the Brick Store Pub today. Pours amber with quite a nice head that sticks round. Big piney hop aroma with a whiff of citrus and caramel malt. Huge piney hop flavors with a touch of herbs and citrus. The hop flavor is bitter and bracing to start, bit 1/2 way through the glass a little bit of sweet malt creeps in and balances things. From a fresh keg like this, its a hop lovers dream. The 12% abv is nicely hidden behind the hops, and a big beer like this is usually either too sweet or too hot. Not at all the case here. Spicy and long in the mouth, this was delightful enough for me to have two."
"D- with the intensity of the bitterness at the end, you probably wouldn't want more than one/two, but it was never a punisher of palates"
"Overall: Unlike some folks that have reviewed this one, I could drink more than one of these in a sitting. I don't feel like my palate has been mutilated, and it wasn't so strong that I couldn't possibly consume another. I can, however, already feel the alcohol halfway through the 12oz pour... So I suspect that my tolerance would be the limiting factor. I really, really like this Founders offering. The only thing preventing this from being a perfect score for me was the price... WAY too expensive. There are tons of other brews that I would rather reach for at half the price."
"M/D: I thought it was well balanced, considering the high ABV. It is coating the tongue, but doesn't really linger to long. I see it as more of a barley wine then a triple IPA. I liked it a lot and thought it was complex and well balanced. I was expecting hop overload, like Hop Dam. Demand of this beer raised prices in line with KBS and Nemesis, which I'm not sure it's worth it. I would enjoy it a lot more at 15.99-18.99. Guess I will just have to drink another one..."
"D- This beer is a wild one. I surely will not be finishing this 4 pack. Honestly I dont think I can even drink another beer after this. My mouth is forever ruined."
"What is scary about this beer is that you truly are dancing with the devil when you scarf one down. I don't know where the 12 or 13 percent alcohol is in this beer. It reminds of drinking 18 year old jameson, you know the alcohol is there but its just so smooth one does not notice it. It pours a grand copper color with a very floral aroma. I cannot even describe how this tastes because there are no real words to explain it. Master craftwork Founders hats off to you guys."
"Drinkability -- For me, this didn't fully lived up to the excitement around it, but I still a great time drinking it. Definitely an exceptional 'tropical fruit' IIPA. If you have access to this one, try it."
"I wasn't sure if this was a triple IPA, like IPA with more intense hops and malt or tripel IPA, some amalgam belgian ipa. It was definitely the former and definitely one of the best over-the-top IPAs I've ever had. Great hop aroma and intense bitterness. Very good malt/sweet flavor. Really strong...I'm feeling it now. Definitely get this beer. I forget the name but will post when I see it again."
"Overall a highly sippable, flavor rich, balanced and tasty brew."
"M & D - Nice and smooth, crisp and oily at the same time. Medium body but with great complexity of flavors. Grapes, dark fruits, roses, bread, and so much more. Drinkability is High in terms of flavor for my hop loving mouth but 12% is HIGH!"
"D- Good Triple IPA but I couldn't drink too many of these in one sitting. A little to malty and syrupy for my liking but for the style I got to let that slide."
"Full bodied, syrupy, sweet, oily, and bitter. Very low carbonation. The alcohol has a warming effect, but is not that noticeable while drinking. This is a nice beer to sip, and it gets better as it warms. Well done."
"pours a brown copper color with spare head, spare lacing, and soft carbonation. very very strong citrus hop smell that was very good to the nose. taste was more of a piney grass hop flavor, with some citrus hints. very harsh bitter taste and finish. medium body with a oily sticky texture. long flavor duration and by far the most bitter beer i've ever had. alcohol fairly well hidden but apparent in the finish. this beer was not even close to as good as i expected it to be, still a decent brew but i was very let down."
"D= Wow this beer is awesome. A great hop character to it and a nice malty balance. It says calculated over 200 IBU but this is such a nice soft hop character that doesn't rip your tongue off like you would expect. Worth seeking out."
"In summary on the malty-hoppy spectrum, Devil Dancer is like an East Coast TIPA - heavier on the malt, like an amped up (also Founders) Double Trouble. Simply put, it's too sweet for me. For the hoppiest-nukiest-dang-hopnuke I've ever wandered across, I recommend Green Flash Palate Wrecker. Drinking it conjured up the radical curiosity and puckering confusion of """people like this?""" that I haven't had since, as a beer newbie, I tried SNPA."
"Hop bomb. Poured ruby red with a very thin white head, maybe because it was a growler pour? No lacing and only faint carb when sitting for a little bit. Aroma is of big juicy piney and resinous hops and chewy malts, smells like cherry a little too. Taste is balanced for such a hoppy beer. Nice malt profile with plenty of bittering hop. Real big hop punch, a little fruity, alot bitter and a lingering pine like aftertaste. Smooth sliky almost oily mouthfeel, thick and viscous. Very drinkable for a beer of its size, no indication of the abv and so well balanced I would have 2."
"Drinkablility is not this beers best feature, it is very big and raw. Fun to try though."
"Great mouthfeel and balance. The sweet caramel malt is bashed over the head by a crisp and floral hop character. Surprising drinkability for the abv, very mellow on the palate and quite a pleasant experience. Worth the hype, too bad it's so limited."
"Poured from bottle into a stemmed tulip glass. Pours deep reddish amber with off white head, but not much head. Aromas of onion, pineapple, grapefruit, and pine. Same in the flavor - a very, very, VERY bitter ale - perhaps the most bitter I've ever had? Maybe... low-ish carbonation gives it a slick, smooth mouthfeel. A little bit of alcohol warmth in the chest. Wow. A pretty incredible brew."
"couldn't drink more than one or two of these. flavor profile overload."
"Devil Dancer arrives at the table crystal clear dark amber in color with a nice reddish hue. The head is slightly tan with pretty good retention and leaves slippery lace. The aroma of this beer is impressive. Hoppy with a good dose of grapefruit and pine, as well as a nice fruity character and caramel malt sweetness. One taste and I'm sold. Like all triple IPAs, it is malty and sweet to be sure, but has such great hop flavor. All those hops also, no doubt, help to tame some of the sweetness. The hop character is predominantly grapefruity with some pine and tropical fruit notes. Alcoholic bite is there, but well incorporated. They also have somehow managed to keep the mouthfeel from being too full and far from sticky. Very drinkable for such a strong beer, and another winner from Founders."
"This is not the best IIPA that I have had. It is, however, a very exciting beer that all who enjoy this style should try. It's cost confuses me only in that I might not be able to appreciate all that went into making it. I will likely buy this again in the future, but in singles rather than the full 4."
"1 was tasty, 2 would be a good night cap, any more would be overkill. If this was available in the area I would definately stock up."
"I have a hard time calling a beer like this """balanced," as it is clearly a hop-nuke, but there is a nice sweetness to it that makes sipping it very enjoyable. Unfortunately, this beer becomes a chore a little over halfway through the 12oz. If you're drinking it alone, like I was, it just becomes too much and seems to completely destroy your palate miserably. Maybe a beer for the masochistic. Maybe that's why it's called """Devil Dancer," because when you start your dance with it, it's wonderful, but then you realize how much of that dance you have left, and then it's grueling. My suggestion: split the 12oz. with someone who will appreciate it. That way you get the best of this beer without it getting the best of you."
"In the glass, this one is orange, cloudy and capped with a minimal amount of ecru colored foam, which retreats rapidly to the sides of the glass. Slightly oxidized, I get aromas of caramel, vanilla, light citrus and bubblegum. On the palate, this one is pretty malty, with caramel and brown sugar, but I do get some grapefruit from the hops and a little warmth from the alcohol. Very good, but I am looking forward to trying a fresh bottle this year."
"Tasted from 12oz bottle. Pours cloudy orange-amber with a thin beige head with very strong retention. Nose of caramel malts, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and some yeast. This beer has some sweetness that shows up with the caramel on the front of the palate. All of that fruitiness comes through soon after with the hops and grapefruit kicking in on the back of the palate. There is a flavor that is somewhat medicinal, but not offensive. The body is big, the carbonation is light, and the finish is long. This beer is very balanced, barely showing the high alcohol."
"lingering sourness prohibits drinking many in a row."
"D - interesting combo, alcohol is never hot or overrides any of the flavor, more felt in the chest, takes belgian style ipas to another and might i say better level"
"Drinkability is decent, but I would like to see more hop dominance for a triple IPA. Still, very well brewed and an enjoyable sipper. I do like this beer."
"D= Had trouble drinking all of this one. A little to thick and sweet for me personally. I do actually belive this may be the devil in a bottle."
"Thanks Greg!"
"Poured cloudy, golden yellow, nice 1/4""" head, dissipating into light lace. Nose of fruity hops, taste hoppy complexity, citrusey. I'm not very good at describing IPA's since I've just come to appreciate them. The alcohol kicks in after the swallow, the remnants of a 12% brew burning actually tastes great. Another touche for the guys at Founders!"
"This is an epic beer worth fearing just a little bit. It meets in between old ale, barleywine, and double ipa in a wonderful way. Let it warm up, delicious."
"very sharp drinking beer, not for everyone but it does have enough malt to make it bareable."
"D- At first I thought I may not be able to handle this- and that hasn't happened with an IPA-type with me for a long time. Its in-your-face hops through and through but also has some balance and smoothness. You can tell the ABV is on the higher side but this one still remains pretty drinkable-I did order a second glass. I'd imagine I was drinking this pretty fresh as I read some bottled reviews that seem less hoppy. Great beer overall and nice job by Founder's."
"Great stuff, dangerously drinkable at 12%. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: I think it goes without saying that this beer is a 'one per' session beer. The alcohol content makes this thing potent, along with the abnormal amount of hops. That being said, this beer does go down pretty smooth, all things considered. I'll be purchasing more."
"Just picked up a 12 oz of this guy at my local spot. Founders is steadily becoming my favorite brewery currently and this does nothing to tarnish that. Pours cleanly into a mug, big fluffy head that sticks around 'till the end. Color is a deep devilish red, great color for the name. The taste is out of this world. The hops aren't overwhelming but definitely contains notes of grapefruit and thick grass. Bit of a bite on the tongue, whether that is the alcohol or not it doesn't detract from the taste. Couldn't recommend this beer more."
"F: FInishes very bitter, and it starts to dry off and the bitterness and dryness accent each other as they often do. A little malty sweetness and caramel linger in the background. The chewy candy juicy hop flavor is really what sticks. I wonder if the hops are brighter when it's more fresh, but this is a pretty heavy thick decent 3IPA. It's definitely a sipper. I would like to compare this to 120min sometime."
"Drinkability: After 2 of these bad boys w/ the high ABV level leaves you wondering if you will be able to handle another one. Although its 12% ABV it's leveled out by the exceptionally unique taste."
"I'm glad I tried this one. While not something I'd drink often it was def worth the experience. A solid offering from Founders."
"Drinkable but not one you would want more than one of in a sitting. I think many people will have a hard time finishing even one 12 oz bottle. Thick mouthfeel, syrupy consistency and sticky."
"Drinkability - Consuming an entire glass is tough. It's very thick and the alcohol hits you very quickly. Consuming it slow seemed better."
"In essence for me it was sort of a more drinkable version of a barleywine and probably fits somewhere between the two styles. An interesting beer to drink, but at the price point I don't know if i'd buy it again."
"Overall, its a very good brew that im glad i found. but at $7 for a single and $20 for a 4-pack the economics of it dont really work out."
"3.5/3.5/3.75/3.75/3.5"
"(review by Daniel)"
"Drinkability - I honestly, and I mean this, can't taste the alcohol. This is a very potent brew, that lends itself as a Trojan horse. As stated, the more it warms up, the more the flavors shine through, yet no alcohol notes are detected. This is, in my opinion, very drinkable despite it being an incredible 12% abv. A pretty damn good """triple""" ipa!"
"Drinkability isn't bad. It's just really, really big. Lots of everything lends a balance of a sort, but man. It's like a barleywine got a DIPA drunk and they had a kid the size of a linebacker."
"A fantastic sipper. Warming as it goes down without the unpleasant alcohol burn. Dangerously drinkable, there was a night the entire four pack seemingly disappeared on me. One is certainly all that is needed. Highly enjoyable and a pleasure which should be savored."
"Tastewise, the alcohol is completely disguised. Never would guess its 12%. The hops are big, but surprisingly the malt balances well. I liked it to much, because I could have happily drank 3 or 4 of them but at that gravity..."
"Drinkability: Well, it is what it is. The abundance of hops is evident. And the malt and mouthfeel make this almost """balanced.""" Not one I could have a lot of though. After a Deliruim Tremens and this, I already feel fiiine."
"Drinkability: A great beer with a rather high ABV, but that's just fine for a weekend. Well done Founders, well done."
"Purchased the last two single bottles available at a specialty beer store I drove by in my travels. Poured into a pint glass, not much of a head, hazy amber color. The smell is very hoppy and citrusy - definitely pleasant. I didn't particularly taste the 12% ABV in each sip which is nice for a high ABV beer. I'd recommend this for sure."
"Poured a slightly hazy amber color with a medium head. Huge sweet caramel malt scent followed by that grapefruit hop scent that I absolutely love. At 12%, I didn't find it too overpowering on the alcohol side of it, quite enjoyable actually. Huge sweet malt flavor, but the hops are definitely there as well. Pretty thick mouthfeel for an Imperial IPA, but thats what I like and I'm sticking to it. This beer will knock alot of people on their asses if they drink too much, but when consumed in moderation over a period of time, it could be very enjoyable."
"I was pretty impressed with how well this tasted with four plus months of age on it. It did not turn into the malt monster I was expecting. Would love to try when extremely fresh."
"Overall: Excellent slow sipper. Great balance of hops and malt but the relatively low bitterness makes this seem more like a hop-forward Barleywine than a DIPA."
"D - Very impressive that the hops held this long. This was a single found in the cooler at Party Source, so likely it spent most of its store life chilled. I can only imagine what this beer is like fresh. As it stands, it's a most righteous & dangerous tightrope walk, indeed."
"It was a nice golden amber triple IPA with almost no head. It was poured from the bottle to glass. Very bitter and hoppy smell which also went through in the taste, I believe the bottle says 112 IBU's. Nice sweet and hoppy balance with a strong alcohol taste after. It was kind of harsh going down at first but was good."
"D - Again rated a little low. I know a lot went into this beer, however I can pay more than half of what this cost and get a DFH 90 (although a bit lower in ABV)I know costs may or may not be a factor, but that is how I am rating this one."
"D: Drinkability was fairly good considering its 12%abv which does come through but no more then a typical 8-9% beer. Very manageable with a moderately good enjoyablity factor. Worth a single purchase if you don't mind or can spare the added cost per bottle."
"D: This beer is very well balanced for a 12% abv TIPA. Incredibly drinkable."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Has a great aftertaste. The bitter hops stick to the tongue quite a long time. Light carbonation and a medium body."
"Bottle. Pours a very hazy dark amber. Just beautiful looking. Incredibly bitter and loaded with hops. Tastes simply amazing. No alc. taste in it, but you can feel it running through your body. So be careful if you're taking on more then one of these bad boys. Just blown away by how delicious this brew was. More please!"
"Very similar to the Dar Horse Crooked Tree Double IPA. Both are pretty good but not worth the price."
"Mouthfeel is very big on body, low on carbonation, and huge on bitterness. It's a slow sipper. Without a doubt, one of the most hoppy bitter beers I've ever had."
"Hazy copper/amber (think dirty penny) with thin tan head. Grapefruit intermingling with pine. Also get a hint of a scent that I can only describe as a minty banana. Big pine hops taste, but that's just the beginning. Gooey citrusy orange and grapefruit with a hint of bananas and sweet cherries. The banana component is odd for me, because I've really only had that with Belgians and Hefe's. Rich and thick feel with just the right amount of carbonation. The only downfall of this beer is the price tag. On a forum thread, I picked this as my """money no object""" beer that would always be in my fridge. The drinkability of this beast is the scary thing. Taste wise, I'd love to session it, but I'd also like to be able to walk."
"Cheers!"
"Recommended"
"Mouthfeel is not overly thick but still a bit sticky. The alcohol is not so much noticeable in the taste, just in the warming as it goes down. This beer is exceptionally drinkable, considering the ABV and the IBUs listed on the bottle."
"The feel is quite light is just right for a hoppy monster. Just the right amount of hops and get about the night amount of funk."
"Pours a red amber with a white head and a little bit of lacing. The aroma is of a lot of sweet malt, an assortment of hops, and a little bit of earthiness. Pine comes from the hops in the greatest abundance. The taste is actually quite a bit malty and sweet, not as hoppy as I would think. The mouthfeel is quite thick and has good carbonation. The beer is a little too sweet and hot to be too drinkable, but an interesting offering nonetheless."
"A somewhat cloudy amber color. A 1-finger head that dissipated slowly. Fresh hops in the aroma. Over the top flavor but not overly bitter. As far as this being atriple IPA at 112 IBUs, it doesn't taste any bitter than most IPAs and double IPAs. The 12% alcohol is present but there isn;t the noticable alcohol burn on the tongue. A big beer but not what I would call a triple IPA."
"Not much head on this beer, but it has an inviting, dark, reddish color. Its flowery, caramel smell doesn't quite prepare you for the intense bitterness of the taste. The hops are there in spades, along with a licorice, resinous, citrus flavor that coats the mouth and lingers. The last thing I taste is the alcohol, as the brew's presence fades away. A nice triple, but to my palate, not as delicious Founder's Red's Rye and Centennial."
"For the price of 4 beers for $20 bought directly from the brewery I expected more. With all the hype surrounding this beer I really wanted to love it but I would much rather spend this type of money on some Double Crooked Tree, Hopslam or even Double Trouble."
"Overall, for the abv being so high, this beast is pretty drinkable. My glass is going a lot faster than I anticipated it to and I am enjoying all the hops. I think this is my first triple IPA, and I must say it lives up to the title of triple."
"D - TRIPLE IPA?! Yeah. That's one of the most potent beers I've ever had. It's taking me quite a long time to finish but proves to be a great sipper that demands your attention as it smacks you square in the mouth with every sip. Two of these will knock you on your ass or have you dancing with the devil for sure."
"Great beer, easy to drink, huge/diverse palate and capable of kicking you in the shorts."
"D- This beer is a heavy hitter which I enjoy but only one for me before I go onto something else. Good beer and I would like to see how this beer ends up with about a year age on it."
"The beer was had on tap and was a red beer with a white head. The aroma was very citrussy hoppiness with a hint of pineiness. Very hoppy with a bit of malt, too. You could definitely taste the Amarillo (or very similar) hops in there. I thought this beer was similar to Southern Tier IPA, but I'm really not sure it merits the """triple""" label. I recognize that double and triple IPA's are a bit arbitrary but even so I expected a little more power, a little more hops and a bit more stickiness. However, an admirable beer on it's own, and was a tasty drink!"
"D: This is a beer that I have been waiting to try for quite some time, and I am certainly glad that I did. This beer is a little low on the drinkability just because of the initial bitterness and the alcoholic finish, but still a great beer."
"Poured with a big, foamy, frothy, off-white head and loads of lace. Color is a very slightly hazy deep amber. Aroma is a citrus and apple hop and some malt. Flavor's about the same with a little butterscotch. Mouth is quite soft. Very bitter finish. Some flavors here that clash to me. Liked other Founders stuff much better. Not a session beer"
"Orange color with a small white head. Nothing to make you say wow. The smell brings a little more punch than the appearance. Some big piney hops that slips into sugar cane sweetness. Some alcohol punches through too. Taste is very sweet up front but quickly turns to alcohol burn. This one is a prime canidate for barrel aging which would certainly help smooth out the alcohol. Unfortunately this one just becomes overbearing. Finishes bone dry. Somewhat of a dissapointment for a Founders beer. Glad i tried it but won't make my permanent wish list."
"poured into a pint glass..a pretty amber orange color with a creamy head which quickly fades...smells of carmeliized malt and hops dominate..,with so many hops the taste is piney at first but then the malt and alcohol take over and this beer is syrupy the hops linger on your tongue between sips....i enjoyed this one more than i thought i would ..would definitely drink again"
"Somewhat nebulous dirty orange color with a slight creamy yellowed head. Barleywine-like aroma of punchy dark hops, sticky caramel, pine sap, a bit of steel and alcohol. Heavy, hoppy flavor...very dark, bitter, and dangerous. Dark, sweet malt underlies everything, but the sugar-encrusted oranges, rind, and a piney bitterness overtakes all. Just sinister, dank, pungent hop resin. I'm definitely drinking this one a little too fast; which isn't to say it's exactly an """easy drinker""". The mouthfeel is a creamy smooth, yet abrasively bitter experience, warming the throat on the way down. Love the aftertaste. This is a dark and delicious buzz in a bottle. I only wish the aroma was a little more subtle in the alcohol department, but at 12% that might be a little too much to ask."
"D - Well, high for a 12% TIPA, but overall it is definitely a sipper."
"Hazy, light red to orange in color. Bright white, splotchy head that sticks. Aroma is completely void of hops... NOT! Quite the opposite. Resiny hops bring a range of smells from cedar, plum, fresh pine, cut grass and earth. Any malt aroma is lost in the jungle of hops. This is one big and boozy beer. Floral flavoring hops make up most the taste. Bitterness is there, but not as intense as I hoped. Hard to believe this is 112 IBUs. Very intense, warming alcoholic character. Syrupy going down the hatch, and leaves a biting, dry bitterness with every sip. I'm not really sure if this 'Triple IPA' really qualifies as a completely different style, but I applaud Founders for trying something new and delicious!"
"Smell and taste are very good- a fresh dousing of grapefruit and slight lemon, accompanied by a power punch of hops and well hidden but still apparent alcohol. Slightly more balanced than expected as some honey and biscuity flavor is present. Mouthfeel is heavy and sticky- exactly what I want in my double er? triple IPA's. Drinkability, when you put together all the factors, it's still goes down better than expected."
"Drinkability: Eh. I mean, it was alright to drink, but it wasn't great, and nothing that made it really stand out to me. One was enough, and there are plenty of other DIPAs I'd rather have than this one. All of that said though, it's not a bad beer."
"D- It's surprisingly drinkable at 100+ IBUs and 12%abv. Well balanced, but somewhat overrated imho."
"A deep amber color, with touches of red along the sides of the glass. A quarter inch thick head forms on top, it is cream in color, slowly dissolving away to a thin layer on top and leaving a ring around the glass. The aroma is intense, grass, grapefruit, earth and pine, combine to attack the nose. Then the aroma brings out hints of some sweetness in malt and there is slight twinge of alcohol. A surprising sweet taste at the front, which does not last long, the hops soon begin their assault. An immense grapefruit and other citrus flavors slam into the palate, lingering for some time and blending to an earthy flavor. It all finishes with a grassy and tobacco flavors at the end. A heavy medium bodied feel, with some tingling from carbonation, it leaves the palate an arid dry feel from the middle to the back of the palate. This beer is intense, to say the least, the incredible aroma and deep color are inviting, then you add the intensity of the flavor and the dryness of the feel, WOW. Throw this at anything spicy, it may even overwhelm the heat."
"This is big bold IPA, very hoppy and very powerful."
"Founders Devil Dancer is insane. Twenty-six consecutive days of dry-hopping? Devilish indeed were the people who conceived of this beer. I'll be interested to see what cellaring will do to this beer; to see how good of an American Barelywine this beer will turn out to be. You can't go wrong with drinking Devil Dancer when its in its fresh, young, """Triple IPA""" stage, either. $20 is certainly a lot for only a 4-pack of 12oz. bottles, but Devil Dancer is absolutely worth trying once. If you're like me then once won't be nearly enough."
"CHEERS!!"
"I've had this aged and it is amazing. Fresh is just as good. This beer holds a special place in my heart. Well worth the price tag and I will be getting another 4."
"mouthfeel is truly exceptional. thick and full-bodied... well carbonated. leaves the palate nice and oily. drinkability so far is good, but 12% might slow me down after awhile... we'll see."
"1 or 2 of these in a night, maybe. 12% abv will catch up with you quickly. Enjoyable, but might be a bit too over the top."
"Pours a hazy, red color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of strong hops, alcohol, slight sweet malt, and a general grassy sweetness (hard to distinguish). Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong hops, sweet malt, alcohol, and slight grassy sweetness. Overall, a good blend, body, aroma, and drinkability."
"Very impressed by this beer, although I shouldn't be surprised given how well Founders does high alcohol brews. Bubblegum, saltwater taffy, and caramel malts lay down a sweet (but not cloyingly so) backdrop upon which resinous hops are laid. Bursting with hop flavor, with a well-restrained bitterness riding across the back of the tongue alongside a nice warming alcohol presence. Chewy, thick mouthfeel, but smooth and almost creamy...me likey. Excellent job Founders, but how bout you start distributing to TX already!!!"
"Those who beleive that today's American IPA's share too much in common with American Barleywines should try this one for an education in the differences that should be exemplified by these larger-than-life IPA's."
"Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into my standard shaker glass. The ale appears a rather murky deep golden brown color with about two fingers of rust colored head. The head leaves a sticky lace on the inside of my glass with each sip. Nose and flavor are of boozy alcohol, syrupy, sticky caramelized malts, orange peel, pink grapefruit juice, resinous pine. Quite viscous in body with ample carbonation. A decent barleywine."
"Drinkability - I could probably have two in an evening, and would LOVE to try this on a cask. Anywho... the ABV pretty much keeps the D score to a 4."
"everything I thought it should be. barleywine style IPA that packs a TON of flavor. Over the top, but it works for those seeking the flavors present here. Good luck drinking more than one at a time."
"Really enjoyed this beer. Not exactly, but kinda makes me think of a Bigfoot with a little age on it, after the hops die down a bit. Triple IPA/Barleywine...I don't know, but it is working for me."
"D: Well I've found a new love and a new favorite Founders (which is saying something). This was an amazing brew and it really lived up to the Triple IPA billing (I could easily see this classified as a West Coast Barleywine as it reminded me of Bigfoot). A tour de force of beer as the guys at Founders show why they may be the best brewery in the country (can't wait to try KBS and Old Curmudgeon which are in the fridge). I can't reco this brew highly enough, go find it!"
"High marks again for the mouthfeel. Devil Dancer has more thickness then some RIS I've had. DD is past the full bodied stage and has moved into chewy beer granola bar status. I've found that exceptional beers like this one are harder for me to review because my mind goes in so many different directions at once. It's difficult to find the words to describe such a bold feel, amazingly good aroma and a taste that is one of the best I've ever had, especially when they come at you all at once. An amazing beer."
"Overall this was a solid DIPA (or triple IPA) but it just didn't taste as crisp as I'd hoped. Still, it's well worth a shot."
"I can tell the malts are there but this beer is all about the hops. Lovely citrusy hops hit my tongue with brutal force. Then some slightly sweet malts shine for just a second then a nice piney bitterness washes it all away. This is one huge beer,and its a palate raper. The other night I had one and then drank a Ruination and the Ruination could not hold up at all. This is one uber hoppy beer."
"In evaluating this beer, regard must be had for the high ABV and IBUs, it drinks very well considering for the 12 per cent stated on the bottle. Enjoyable if one can sip and savour, not recommended as a sessional. Overall, another well done project from Founders but nothing I would rush out to buy more of necessarily; this beer resembles a barley wine in some respects. Any true beer lover should make an effort to taste one of these but I'm not sure I would stock my fridge with it, this style separates the men from the boys (and the women from the girls)."
"Very drinkable, and very tasty. A kickass beer overall and one was not really enough. Reccommended."
"Cheers! BTW- Thank you Rasolante1 for hooking me up."
"12 oz. My bottle said 12% abv. Fairly bright orange pour, minimal white head. Aroma is heavily piney hops, small hints of malt, fruitcake, resin. Fairly viscous. There is a sweet malt backbone, but definetely a tongue biter. Not a ton of citrus,with some carmelized sugar. A pleasant tobacco/tea/herbal bitterness lingers a while, clean finish. Rides the fine line of being overly bitter. I thought this might be a bit much after mowing the lawn, but was quite pleasant, though a sipper. Worth trying, as are most of Founder's Ales."
"Founders is undoubtedly one of the best breweries in the country. They consistently produce world class beers."
"D - For the style, not as easy to drink as others I've had. However, this is a good beer, but not mind-blowing. It's also not cheap, at $18 per 4-pack. Overall, good and will drink again."
"D-An occasional bottle would ve welcome, if it were not quite so expensive. Overall, I thought it seemed to lack the complexity and definition that typically lends to strong marks in drinkability."
"D- Very tasty and as drinkable as the style gets from what I've had."
"Drinkability: Wild and wooly, this one I could see many people enjoying. The alcohol does not make itself known, somehow, with the estery balance of the malt and the rich assault of the hops. A true TIPA, one that I'll go back to if I can ever find it again. Another winner from Founders."
" The only thing that I didn't like was that the bottle was a twist top."
"Poured a hazy ruby color with a small dirty white good carbonation. Nose is orange peel, caramel, floral, pine and rather dry. Tastes is grapefruit, orange peel, floral and other various fruits.Lots of caramel malt help it to stay as balanced as possible. The big hop presence is not there up front but through the middle it is. Not much of a hop bite tome at all. You can tell this is a big beer just on the thickness of the pour alone. Well done."
"Drinkability: Moderate at best, but could definitely be higher if I weren't paying attention to the ABV."
"D- Another damn good offering from Founders...as a hop head, this wasn't as over the top and in your face as I was hoping for (I mean, c'mon it is a Triple IPA), but that doesn't mean I won't be getting this one again..."
"Overall, a well made beer, but just a little lacking."
"Really great offering from Founders."
"It's a huge beer, but it doesn't overwhelm or get to cloying. It also manages to hide the alcohol pretty well in the taste, although it will come back to get you eventually. A very good DIPA, but a bit too pricey for me."
"Pours an amazing, beautiful ruby red amber. Thing white head over a red body. Quite awesome. The type of coloring you only see in fruit beers. Smells incredibly hoppy and very sweet. Sort of like an American barleywine. The alcohol is certainly present as well. quite fresh smelling, also. Taste is mainly hoppy with a very sweet backbone. Not as crazy or such as I was expecting, but very good. Has a lot of booziness in the flavor. Mouth is very full-bodied and pretty much just great. Good level of carbonation. Drinks quite well, especially for the high abv. Drinks very easily for how high the abv is. Certainly delicious, a bit pricey though (I had to pay $20 for the 4-pack) so I don't know if I would pay so much to try it again and this is why I gave it only a 3.5 for abv."
"A: A pencil's thickness of heavy foam which quickly dissipated, deep orange to ruby red color, some signs of sticky foam along the edge of the glass - 4.25, S: Solid hop bomb on the nose, alcohol is upfront and aggressive, somewhat piney and medicinal, some peach concentrate and sweet caramel malts - 4.50, T: I swear the first sip took off the epidermis from the inside of my mouth - tongue shredding hop bite which is equally matched with a gooey, sweet maltiness, lots of pine and grapefruit zest, rum soaked bundt cake with a lemon frosting, some raisins and prunes possibly - 4.25, M: Thick and heavy - 4.00, D: A great sipper for the end of a long day, seems appropriate in a brandy snifter, let this beer warm and the flavors truly come out - 4.00"
"Thick, viscous, sugary, chewy, all describe the body on this beer. Quite an adventure, but I had fun through the whole thing. This is a beer that you need to sit down and sip on for a good while, which is fine, since it's overall character improves as it warms and it really loses that harsh initial bitterness once it reaches room temp. An amazing beer, that I hope to enjoy again!"
"This has become my favorite IPA/DIPA/TIPA or whatever you want to call it. I am going to seek out more bottles immediately."
"D: A very good beer, but still give me Hop Slam, Hercules, or Hop Wallop any day. Has its strong and weak points but is well-crafted in any event except for the big alcohol punch which detracts rather than enhances the overall character of this brew."
"J"
"D - This is a great tasting brew. It is extremely hoppy and fairly easy drinking considering the high ABV."
"This poured a nearly clear copper with tan head. It smelled like strong pineapple and sweet apricot hops, with sugary caramel and a bit of alcohol. It tasted like strong copper and pineapple and apricot hops and resin, with abundant sugary caramel malt. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a lasting bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a very strong flavor, but it was clean and tasty. It had a terrific smell and great body. It hid the alcohol decently, considering the high ABV. But the strong, lasting bitterness makes this a definite sipping beer. I'm curious how a year would affect this, given the prominent malt character. But it's quite enjoyable fresh."
"12oz bottle courtesy of dancingcaddis, thanks man! Amber color, short head, looks fine. The smell is spicy hops, weird, doesn't smell like its 12%. The flavor is hoppy and bitter but nothing super special and makes me wonder why the point of a 12% IPA is. There are so many more IPA's that are plenty hoppy (Pliny, Sculpin) and don;t have to have a high abv % to do it so I wonder what the point of this beer is..."
"Absolute sipper here, but goes down very easy. So much flavor that's in your face. An awesome beer that I look forward to having again."
"Pours a brilliant deep amber color with about a half finger of head. Smell is POTENT hops...I mean a knock-you-on-your-ass pine and floral bouquet. Alcohol is very detectable also. Taking a sip it is almost as if someone just put a batch of hops in a juicer and added a bit of carbonation to the concentrate that comes out. This is for hop heads only. Its almost too much though, hop bombs are fine but there is not an ounce of restraint here. Mouthfeel is thick and very oily. This is an extremely tasty beer but not a drinkable one. I'm glad I only bought one bottle because this will be enough to tide me over until next years release!"
"Big alcohol bite. tasty brew, but DIPA, triple IPA... barleywine (my vote's for the third). This is one of my sippers that was too good and ended up being enjoyed a little to quickly for the 12%."
"just swirl sniff sip and enjoy"
"This beer pours a cloudy bright red color. The head is a quarter inch in height, and hangs around for a while. The aroma is citrus, grapefruit, pine resin, and a nice caramel malt backbone. It isn't the most complex aroma I've come across in a DIPA, but it does have some complexity. The taste opens with a sharp bitterness, then some citrus and pine come through, then it all goes back to the bitterness. I love bitter beers, but this one is pushing my boundaries. The mouthfeel is full bodied with lively carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a nice beer. I think it would be a whole lot better if it weren't quite so bitter."
"Founders Devil Dancer pours an orangish copper with a tight compact head. The head fades to a glossy top, but the sheen and overall color takes the appearance of a loose honey. The smell is intensely sweet of citrus and hops. Taste is strongly hopped with an up front but mild bitterness. Mouthfeel is dense with tight compact cabonation bubbles. Last sips yield very little cabonation, and mellow hopped bittersweet liquid. Well hopped, nicely rounded from start to finish, and an overall pleasure to drink."
"Drinkability: To sum up this beer in one word, """complex.""" And this is both its strength and its weakness. At this ABV and with the intensity of flavors here this is definitely a one a night beer and a once in a while beer. I'll welcome another chance to drink it but it is not for every day drinking. So what to say about drinkability. Do I want more? Yes. Do I want more right now? No. Will I seek it out in the future? Yes."
"Poured into a snifter for a clear auburn-tinted brown with light tan head. A robust hoppy smell with citric and soapy smells; a little spicy. Also hints of caramel and bread malt. A hop bomb in a medium-to-full body that is dry and crisp. Very hoppy yet retains a good smoothness for the type of beer (not haggard) and even has minor malt sweetness/stickiness. Flavor is mostly citric hops, slightly floral with hint of roasted malt as well. ABV is noticeable for really dry finish but not overpowering or diminishes the beer; lends itself to beer and warms. A quality sipper and well worth to try one."
"In conclusion I love this beer. It's a sexy beast whose ever so enchanting. And bitter."
"*update* This does age alright, but having this fresh is unbelieveable; this gets a bad knock since most ppl get this via trade with over a year on it. Its an IPA, fresher is best!"
"D- This is much more drinkable than last years version, but the same faults I found in that vintage still exist in this years, just a bit more subdued. This probably will turn out to be a decent strong ale/barleywine in about three years but I won't be experimenting with it at the price point. In most cases the more hops the better, but in this case they seemed to get into a huge rumble with one another."
"D - for a triple IPA, this was a lot more drinkable than I thought. As mentioned, it wasn't too bitter or over the tops with hops; rather it is sweet and well-balanced. Very drinkable and delicious for a beer of this strength."
"Drinkability: It's a sipping beer, for sure. But it still remains pretty drinkable given the big abv and IBU's."
"OK, here we go, the vaunted Devil Dancer. Triple IPA, eh? Whatever you wanna call it Founders just please make some more for NoVa next year. Please. Pours a rich amber tone with a tight, sexy little lacing on top. Oozing out of the glass are rich, resinous, sharp, earthy, DELICIOUS hops. Not much fruit here, just love juice from the gorgeous little cones. I salivate for a sip of this beauty. And sip I do. Sip, sip, sip. Yum, yum, yum. Despite the foolhardy amount of aggressive hops brimming over in this brew, the substantial malt fights tooth and nail to establish a sliver of balance. Immense flavors going on here. West Coast barley wine springs to mind, but no, that isn't quite right. Because barley wine doesn't do this thing justice. Maybe if I had the patience to sit on one of these for a year or two...but nahh. I am drinking my last one tonight, an noble sacrifice to add my review for us BAs. It has an almost creamy finish, once again further testament to this things abnormal balance. Founders, a second askance. Could you do this beer in Magnums for the holidays? Talk about love on a cold winter's eve. Alright, now I am just rambling loose compliments. But you deserve it Devil Dancer. Keep on shakin' your money maker. Cheers."
"Drinkability: The abv is the only aspect hurting this score."
"D= This was an impressive beer, despite my worry that it would be overkill or imbalanced in an unpleasant way. To my great pleasure, it was tasty and though a sipper for sure, it was pretty drinkable. I could even see myself having two of these in a sitting, despite the big ABV."
"The alcohol is obvious in the taste which effects drunkability, but overall this beer is easy to drink."
"This beer reminds me of a homebrew I did a while back, where I boiled too much water off and ended up with a highly condensed IPA (which already had aggressive hopping). The aroma and flavor are dominated by a sherry, alcoholic, malty backbone. The hops are over indulged: the effect is an amorphous bitterness which obscures any of the underlying hop complexity. Overall not a bad beer but a little overdone."
"M/D: Full bodied, a bit syrupy. I would like to have this one again, but I'm not sure if it's the right price."
"D - Umm...perhaps I've been drinking too much recently, but looking at my half-full tulip (yes, I'm an optimist) is making me a touch queasy today. I remember loving this on-tap at Kristina's pig roast, but right now I can't imagine having more than one glass. Still, that's pretty good for a 12% palate-destroying triple IPA."
"The astringency and syrup-like texture makes this more of a sipper, but a tastey one nonetheless. Overall, this is a damn good DIPA and one that I'll definitely have again. I just wish it didn't come with such a high price tag."
"see above for mouthfeel."
"I drank two of these while playing poker, one of my wine-drinking buddies asked to try a sip..he ended up drinking the other half of the four pack. He loved it almost as much, if not more than I did. Excellent beer from a truly world-class brewer. Highly impressed."
"D- Not the easiest drinking. Its a pure beer bomb, and explosion on the palate and 12% ABV to boot."
"Drinkability is good. I am looking forward to the other 4 that I bought, but not tonight. This is too intense for enjoying more than one. Still a great experience. A great beer."
"I can't say this is my favorite Founders beer, but their lineup is so exeptional that this easily ranks with the best of the best IPAs I have ever had. For such an intense ABV beer, this beer drinks too easily. And the flavors here are top notch. Highly recommended and worth the high price point."
"Feels very sticky and super dry on the tongue. I could only drink one of these because during the night since it kinda ruined my taste buds. Insane beer though."
"D: Again intense but not overdone. The alcohol is well disguised. A fine brew but no more than one at a time for me. Wowza!"
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, this brew pours burnt orange with a thin light tan head that quickly settles. The lacing on the glass is amazing. Putting my nose as deep into the glass as I can, all I get are hops. Piney and citrusy all the way around. The taste at first is almost overwhelming. It's fruity with hints of pineapple and citrus alongside piney, grassy notes. It finishes sweet, with toasty malt and hints of caramel. This viscous brew coats the tongue and stays there for minutes after. Devil Dancer is a great start to an evening. Although it's a bit boozy, I think that it will eveolve nicely with a year or two of age."
"Drinkability: I was gonna knock this down to a 3.5 - 13% (12% according to the bottle) is pretty extreme, and it would be an understatement to say I'm feelin' it - but everything else just seems to come together so well I couldn't put it at anything below a 4.0. The alcohol is incredibly well hidden here despite its level, and - that aside - it's just a well made, flavorful (albeit intense) brew. Not one I could see myself drinkin' more than one of or drinking casually, but I enjoy it for what it is."
"D: Founders definitely brought the pain with this one. And honestly, it's a bit excessive. But it really is as drinkable as a 12% ABV hop-bomb could be. If you're about to die of hop deficiency, this beer just might save your life."
"Excellent, excellent beer, & a must-try for hop-heads. Might want to split a bottle with a friend or neighbor, because after about half a bottle my taste buds are scattered, unmoving, all over my mouth. They fell happy."
"The mouthfeel is definately bitter, but it does not have a grainy taste to it that other hoppy beers acquire when they age. It also goes down fairly easy, after the first few sips that is. I wouldn't want more than one at a time."
"Pours a syrupy ruby red color with hues of deep orange. An expected very thin off-white head actually leaves a decent sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Aroma is amazing - sweet citrus (grapefruit and orange) with some floral hop as well. Alcohol, sweet caramely malt, and a hint of tea are present on the nose as well. Tastes are full-flavored - alcohol is very present at first, but sits back and lets the complexity of the ale take over - huge up-front grapefruit, orange and a hint of lemon initially. Sweet malts counter the bitterness better than expected, but the hop bitterness still rides out the finish with tons of pine and alcohol. Leaves a tingle (maybe a bruise) on the tongue with a nice white-peppery hop bite to finish. Mouth-feel is thick like syrup, chewy, but very smooth and oily from the hop resins. Overall, unbelievable quality here, especially when working with 112 ibu's. Excellent craftsmanship but one will do just fine for me, which takes away from drinkability - although now that I'm finished with it, I kind of want another one..."
"D: To call this a big beer is almost an insult. Its HUGE. With that said, its also balanced because all the parts are big to help mellow out the overall taste profile. Its drinkable for such a huge brew."
"I'm coming to the conclusion that Founders rules the darker stouts (read: KBS and double chocolate oatmeal), whereas Bells brings hop reign (read: Hopslam and Two-hearted). I'm okay with that...and proud of Michigan."
"M - Full bodied, some stickiness, a little chewy. What you'd expect from a 13% TIPA."
"Drinkability: Can i send you to my reviews of other Founders beers? The complexity makes it a stand alone beer and I wouldnt wanna ruin it by drinking too much before or after"
"I've wanted to try this beer for quite some time and I finally get the chance, and this bottle is pretty fresh. Pours a deep amber with no haze or suspended particles, and a thin tan head that dissipates quickly, one could easily mistake this for your average amber based on the appearance. The aroma is bursting with fresh hops and a caramel sweetness, this smells exactly like hopslam. The flavor is a lot more balanced than I expected. Massively hoppy with notes of pineapple, lime and mango as well as a nice caramel sweetness that balances out the bitterness. The finish is sweet but not cloying. The alcohol is well concealed considering the strength of this brew. Drinkability isn't great, but for this style and considering the ABV it's pretty good. Honestly this is more of a barleywine than a triple IPA, but it's damn good regardless."
"D: A drinkable beer, to be sure, but not something I would drink a lot of in one sitting. Still, another good beer from Founders."
"D: I really love the flavor, but there's no doubt this is not a keep drinking type of beer. One and done for me!"
"Its a bit sticky on the feel with modest carbonation presence."
"12oz bottle comped by ErikRFS at Flying Saucer Raleigh, poured into a Duvel glass (a real one, not a dollar store Duvel Green one) a crisp amber with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is loads of pine and burnt caramel. The taste is a very nice balance of sticky pine hops and burnt caramel malts, especially nice balance for 12% alcohol. The beer is certainly somewhat heavy, but tolerable with slight dryness. I must say, I've had high expectations of this beer and have wanted to try it for a while now, and it does not disappoint!"
"Pretty cool to enjoy once in a while."
"As far as drinkability is concerned, this would be difficult for newbies or those that do not appreciate hop bombs, but I could drink this all night long and for breakfast if the wife did not catch me. Amazing brew for hopheads that enjoy balance over bitterness."
"Dark orange color with no lasting head or lacing. Big time citrus and pine aroma with a noticeable alcohol smell. Whoa, this thing is bitter! Toasty malts are barely noticeable behind the huge citrus rind, stingily bitter hops, mostly grapefruit, a little bit of pine, thick and oily on the tongue. It was almost like drinking PineSol and hairspray. This beer was a bit too much for me. I like big hop bombs, but it was hard to finish this one as the alcohol was a bit too noticeable and warming. Not the best I've had from Founders."
"12 ounce bottle, 12% ABV, bottled 6/17/2009. I assume they lowered the ABV so they could finally sell this beer in Ohio. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a hazy orange/brown color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like citrusy hops, caramel and toasted malt, and a bit of piney hops. The taste is very good, with great balance between the hops and malt. I can taste citrus (grapefruit, orange) and pine hops, brown sugar, caramel malt, and some tropical fruit. There's also a nice lingering bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and creamy with good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's very smooth and easy to drink. The alcohol isn't too noticable at all, but it does catch up to you after a while. Overall I think this is a pretty good brew. Too bad it only comes out once a year, I'd buy this quite a bit if it was available all the time."
"Heavy IPA"
"The ambience of hops roasted over an open fire dances with hints of fruity sweetness. It's surely a bold dance with the devil that I'll gladly take only on special occasions."
"This is an intense drink but also goes very well with food; intense but pleasing and a drink that shows complexity and lots of character."
"a decent excursion into the vast world of imperials and doubles (triples?). however stated, it was a chore to finish because it comes off so tart and heavy handed."
"12 oz. stubby with no freshness date. Unfiltered, dry-hopped for 26 days with 10 different varieties, and 112 IBUs. The beer is a clear, dark ruby with low carbonation and a half-inch, dark khaki head that leaves a few wisps of lacing. Toasty and bready malts in the nose, along with floral alcohol, crystal malts and some citric/resiny hops, but I was expecting more hop aroma. On the palate, there are pungent hops that impart grapefruit, orange, and notes of pepper. Sweet crystal malts and an intense bitterness strike a surprising balance, starting sweet, then moving to a long and bitter finish. Thick and almost syrupy, fairly dry, with coating hop oils that linger forever. This is much bigger than I thought it would be, and I'm kinda getting what they mean by triple IPA - it's much maltier than a double IPA and much hoppier than a barleywine. Almost in the same vein as the 120 Minute, but much more approachable. Well worth a try."
"Dark amber color with a thin foamy white head that quickly diminishies to a thin film that leaves pretty good lacing.Huge aroma of pine,and floral hops along with big sweet malty caramel notes,a little musty,maybe some bread. Intense flavors of very sugary sweet pine resin,brown sugar,orange zest,peaches,wood,very complex,very barly wine like in aroma flavor and mouthfeel, very little carbonation,and slightly sticky. VERY GOOD !"
"Here's the bad part. It was very heavy, and thick, as far as mouthfeel is concerned. Drinkability-wise, I do not recommend more than one or two in a sitting. After four, I felt weighed down and groggy. I dont think it was the ABV, because I can drink 2 Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPAs and feel just fine."
"D: Pretty good for a beer of this strength."
"Overall, BIG! Reminds me of a beefed-up Dogfish Head 90-minute. Drink with respect!"
"Nice balance, especially considering the high alcohol to this little monster. Great beer."
"pours with almost no head, light carbonation. Color is dark brown, cloudy. Smells of ethanol, rum, dates and orange peel. Alcohol is prominent at the first sip and then a blast of hop bitterness hits. Raisins and bitterness, candy orange and bitterness, grapefruit and bitterness. And alcohol. Body is fairly heavy with a toffee sticky mouthfeel. Good to have one and fairly tasty but could not drink with much frequency."
"Poured into an oversized wine glass, it's murky ruby brown color with hues of orange. No head on this one. The aroma was very sweet, it seems the hops have already shrivled up here. It still smells pretty good. Mild resin mixed with caramel and faint citrus. Okay, now drink it! Wow, what a kick. My throat is being tickled. The bitterness is still here, though not as assertive if it were fresh. Crazy juice baby! Syrupy in the mouth. Big and resinous. There's a little mango and passionfruit underneath this blanket of hop juice. This might be a little too much for me, though it's still enjoyable."
"This one isn't for everyone, you have to love big hoppy beers to enjoy it. But if those beers are to your liking this is definitely one to seek out."
"Pours a cloudy orange/brown with almost no head whatsoever. Not an attractive beer. Smells maltier than expected with fruit, alcohol, and hops notes in the nose. First sip is a ton more balanced than expected. This beer is about a year old. The hops have certainly faded leaving behind a awesome barley wine in its wake reminiscent of a toned-down DFH120."
"7/3/6/3/14 (3.3/5)"
"Pours a nice amber color with foamy off-white head. Hoppy aroma with hints of malt and citrus. Very smooth and well balanced. ABV very well hidden. Creamy and somewwhat sweet with a nice malt presence that balances out the floral and citrus hops. Excellent!"
"As others have said, tastes more like a Barleywine than a """Triple IPA"""."
"D - One and done for me with this. A great experience, but I couldn't pick this up very frequently."
"but otherwise im speechless and blown away by my midwestern friends"
"Drinkability - an awesome bottle of beer; better still with a few years of age on it, IMO."
"american barleywine because of the color, mouthfeel, and strength."
"Seeing this beer on the tap board as 'Founders Devil Dancer 13%' was the only advance warning of what was in store. I had no idea what style it was, only the name and ABV. Served in a snifter, the color was a cloudy burnt orange and the first sniff was of a muted hop well blended; a little grassy, a little floral, some citrus. The taste was out of this world. Medium body, balanced between syrupy and creamy. The mouth feel was very smooth. This is one beer that should not be passed up if you find it on tap, unless you're driving. The alcohol did not seem to present itself to me so it's deceptively 'hot'. I get the feeling that this beer was not a long shot or random but the result of alchemy in the truest sense."
"This beer is insane. No, absolutely insane! Both the alcohol and hops dropped bombs on our palates, and it's going to be hard to recover from the shredding. As for a pairing: ﬁght ﬁre with ﬁre! Aim and launch it at some really spicy food, preferably something with habanero peppers."
"I'm a fan of Founders beers and this one is incredible. Must get more of this."
"Overall, not really what I was expecting. This was more like a barleywine to me. The 13% makes itself well known. If you're looking for a very sweet and hot Triple IPA, then this is your beer."
"Pours dark clear copper with a very small beige head that dissipates quickly to a ring leaving bits of lacing. The aroma leans toward a barleywine with the heavy caramel malts and dark fruits. there are some citrus hops in the nose as well. In the taste, there is a more prevalent citrus hop kick up front before the malts and sweetness take over in the middle and leaves a sticky sweet finish with a hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel is sticky and medium bodied with little carbonation. This is a DIPA that borders on a barleywine with a slightly abrasive feel that keeps it from being great for me and holds down the drinkability a bit."
"not a very easy beer to drink. not a drain pour, but not anything to rave about either. but hell maybe triple ipa's just aint my thang."
"Pours slow and thick out of the bottle, a murky mahogany color, not even a trace of a head on this beer, though a pencil-thin ring develops around the edge of the glass....this thing just looks scary. Massive amount of caramel in the nose, big juicy citrus notes, and definitely more than a hint of alcohol is present. Flavors follow right along, really bitter grapefruit, sticky caramel, and a good dose of pine. Mouthfeel is outrageous on this beer, and definitely steals the show. Thick, oily, ragged, the bitterness will likely stay with me for hours....this is quite possibly the chewiest beer I've ever had. And as much is everything in this beer is turned to 11, there seems to a pretty good balance between hops and malts. A slow-sipping, taste-bud-thrashing beer....wow. Definitely a once or twice a year treat."
"Definitely a one at a time beverage, good thing it wasn't a bomber."
"D - Uh... not sessionable? This is just a monstrous beast of a beer. Gigantic, heavy, warming and jam-packed with flavour. Maybe just a touch over the top but a pleasure nonetheless."
"D-Well I had to say that this is about average for sipping style of drinking most triples, which is generally slow and small."
"This beer has a high APV cutting back on the over all drinkability but the flavor has a great complexity that make me want to keep drinking it"
"D--alot of alchol but not very much hop/malt balance/ also the flavors are not just as full as an imperial should be."
"Time did it well- Id consider it more of an american barleywine in taste and sweetness. So many flavors and bodied functions here that the sheer ridiculous amount of hops go under the radar more than you would think."
"Devil Dancer pours a dirty ruby red brown color, some haze and a small white head. Sweetness on the nose, notes of sweet, peppery malts, wood, pine resin and sugar sweet hops. While tasting you get pretty much the same characters from the nose, the malt sweetness of a barley wine with the ungodly amounts of hops and pleasant, resiny bitterness. i was expecting to get baked with alcohol heat but got nothing, the 13% feels like 8 at most. Medium coating body, decent drinkability, low carbonation. I love big beers."
"Wow, this beer was quite an experience. Did I mention it's HUGE. I would gladly have it again."
"Hard to be great within this style, but this beer tried and didn't fall flat on its face but didn't scream world-beater, either."
"this brew pours up a reddish amber color with a white head. the nose is slight citrus. the taste is caramel, citrus, floral hops. a sweet brew. full bodied, very smoothe. more like a Barleywine. 13% alcohol!? no freakin way! it definately masks it totally."
"Drinkability: A few of these would be quite a tasty treat. Lots of strong flavors and IBUs. Warming alcohol and complex flavor make this a winner."
"D: Overall, Devil Dancer is an exercise in excess: Big on hops. Big on malt. Big on booze. Take 45 minutes and dance with a snifter. One and you're definitely done."
"Wow, this thing is a monster! Pours reddish-orange but my particular bottle had very little head or retention. It did travel cross-country but then again several other beers did and they still poured perfectly. Smell is of hops, alcohol (but only a little) and a strong sweet caramel. Smells like a Barleywine. Taste is good. Taste is of hops and nothing but hops. At times there is a bit of a malt backbone that tries to make an appearance with a bit of caramel but the hops beat it down. A thick, oily, and warming sensation as it does down. Overall this is a very well crafted beer. I have to say I've had several beers that have a much lower ABV where I notice the alcohol more. I've heard people debate on what catagory this beer should be in. As for a DIPA or Barleywine I really dont know. All I know is that this beer has a hell of a kick to it and you should drink this warmer and a bottle should last you about 2 hours or so. Sip and enjoy!"
"I like this one, just very extreme, IMO."
"Since I have no way of telling how old this bottle may have been, I hope that one day I'll get some more of it that's certified fresh and also cellar some. Is it a DIPA? A triple IPA, as the label states? A barleywine in DIPA's clothing? Who cares? This stuff is excellent."
"Big and balanced aint easy, particularly in IPAs to whatever power, but they got the job done right here. Malty than many of its class, and damn tasty."
"i know i'm going against the grain here, and dipa's are my favorite style, so i thought i'd love this triple ipa...but this is just too boozy. on the pour this just looks thick, a cloudy deep amber with a minimal white head that the carbonation struggles to fight through, leaving a decent collar of lace. aroma is boozy and rummy. the aroma also features dark dried fruit and molasses. smells more like a steroidal barleywine than a dipa/triple ipa. taste is big sweet fruity malt, bitterness comes on in waves; smooth at first and then becomes dominant and bracing. evenly balanced between sweet malt and bitter hop but the boozy alcohol dominates overall. mouthfeel is viscous and thick with a just a hint of carbonation. long finish. my overall impression is that this would be much better served as an accompaniement (sp?) to a fine cigar."
"D: Thick and crazy but smooth. This would make an excellent winter IPA if that makes sense at all."
"This is a nightcap beer, but one I would consistently reach for as a nightcap. Give this a try."
"This beauty has a clear red amber color with a big light tan head that declines quickly with good lace. There is a full butterscotch malt aroma, sweet and announcing the alcohol presence. The flavor is strong butterscotch and alcohol and buttery malt. Grapey and toffee toward the piney hops idea. This is pretty potent although it doesn't knock you out as a tough drinker, but that may be wishful thinking. A warm tastiness here. Recommended."
"Devil Dancer's a very unique, yet immensely satisfying beer. It's certainly not for the faint of heart. I'm sipping it, but enjoying it very much. This really is a beer that needs to be experienced for what it is. Lucifer's beer of choice? Perhaps. If so, he's got good taste."
"mouthfeel is oily, lingering bitter hops, sweet hot malts, loads of complexity and just a really nice take on an ipa, heavy and rich, worthy of a taste."
"D-Could drink it all day long...hopefully. Great beer, out of the bottle or on tap."
"This was the closer at the first Stumelagram epic!! .. a very smooth brew indeed... lots sugar and alcohol and biting hops ... jack smokes ... would really benefit with so age on it ... a nightcap beer as defined in the dictionary ... thank you mr stu, this was a good night..."
"Closest thing to this beer that I have had is DFH 120 minute, if you like that you will probably like this too."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving no lace. Cloudy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Sweet alcohol nose. Flavor is a strong, sweet caramel, alcohol and grapefruit hops, lingering grapefruit aftertaste. Nice triple IPA. $3.80 for a 12oz bottle from Yankee Spirits South Attleboro, Ma."
"D: Lowered because of its intense flavours, definitely a sipping libation. Overall a very good big IPA from Founders, glad I tried it."
"So, it has the residual sweetness of an English B'wine and the hop bitterness of a 'Merican one. Smooth and easy to drink! Good thing I've only got this one :) Wait. Bummer, I've only got this one :("
"This needs time to mellow. I say don't drink it immediately, but feel free to grab a couple bottles so that you can observe it over time."
"Overall, it was a good beer that i'm glad i tried. It was simialr to a Stone 10th anny. Because of that i'm assuming when it came out that the hop character was a lot more upfront than it is now. It seems to have aged into a barelywine. That being said, i don't know how old my bottle was or how it had been stored, but the hops were definitely diminished."
"Drinkability: Wow, hard to get down and finish because of the dichotomy of malts and hops and the high alcohol."
"may try another bottle from another source."
"I want more"
"Great beer, wish I could get it in my area!"
"Pours in to a pint glass an extremely murky reddish brown, leaving plenty of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Very little off white head that fades away to a ring around the glass. Nose is full of hugely aromatic malts, amaretto, cherries, plums, alcohol presence, and an earthy hop presence as well. Flavor is more of an explosion of dark, ripe fruits bombarding the pallete with raisins, plums, cherries, very reminiscient of a good barleywine, with a strong bitter hop finish taking over the palette in the end that holds on for dear life, alongside a deeply alcohol warming effect down the gullet. Mouthfeel is extremely heavy and syrupy, light carbonation, and semi-dry, bitter finish. I tend to think that this beer is a bit too extreme, and that is its downfall. Good to have one once in a while in place of a barleywine, but other than that, I shall pass. I expected much more to be honest. Way over the top."
"I'm also a sucker for a fun name."
"Taste - it has a nice balance of carbonation to it's very solid hoppy flavor but this is where I noticed the alcohol, of course, and it was a tad overwhelming at first, but as I finished it off it was very satisfying. Don't have too many of these at one sitting or you won't be standing back up anytime soon."
"Super thick in the mouth. Very bitter grapefruit hop syrup. Viscous as hell. This one hurt so good."
"Really underrated."
"Pours a deep mahogany color with very little head. Minimal lacing. Smells very hoppy with a slight alcohol profile to it, I'm thinking brandy. The beer first greets you with a mix of caramel flavor and bitterness. It's a great combination and not overly powerful in any respect. Very well balanced for a """triple IPA.""" What's really nice is after the initial flavor rush there is a subtle pineapple flavor to it as well. The lack of carbonation certainly adds to the mouthfeel in that it is very thick and syrupy making this beer ideal for sipping, which is probably a good thing to given that it is 13%."
"Poured into a pint glass quite vigorously and produced no head despite this. However, lacing was present atop the beer. A deep brown/red color. Smells of citrus. Flavor begins with hops then with caramel and ends with pine. Pretty sticky and thick. I can hardly detect any carbonation. The alcohol is very noticable. Low drinkability due to the high ABV."
"This beer poured a relatively dark amber color, very minimal head, and the scent of malt and hops was definitely apparent. And for a triple IPA that hops better be apparent! The first few sips were a shock to the mouth...not bad, but I hadn't quite prepped for the overpowering hops. It took me a while to acclimate to the sharp taste. However, after a few sips, this is a nice beer that has a minimal after taste to it. As tasty as this beer is, it is one that it's enjoyable for one or two in a sitting."
"Devil Dancer is yet another winner by Founders. Tons of malt, tons of hops, tons of alcohol...delicious and drinkable too...sometimes just plain transcendent. Such an insane beer that, as I get down to the bottom of the glass, it makes me long for the more subtle, drinkable aspects of less-alcoholic Double IPAs. """Huh?!?""" Exactly. The extreme beer race implanted in us a new, skewed perspective. No complaints, there's plenty of room for beers like this, especially when they're brewed so damn well. Kudos."
"12oz bottle. Pours a dark amber color, not much head to speak of but not surprising considering the 13% ABV. The smell is extremely aromatic, big malty base with a large dose of hops. Taste taste has a very malty backbone with a strong hop presence and some warming from the alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is very thick and slightly chewy. Wow, this is the definition of an extreme beer. Only in America can you find a brewer with the balls to brew this monster. Overall, Founders Devil Dancer is quite an experience, definitely recommended to give it a shot."
"D- A good brew and a slow drinker. Probably would just keep it at one of these."
"Honstly, I'm not sure if this beer does it for me. It has almost the same pitfalls as DFH's 120. It might be a winner if you like the style, but I'm not sure even hopheads would really find what they're truly craving with it. Founders makes some of the best beers around, but this one was just a little too extreme to make it more than a novelty to me. Give it a try, and enjoy it for what it is, but I think this is more of a shock value beer for random occasions than anything I'll keep on hand or hunt for again. Definitely more drinkable than the 120, but it's not quite as intentionally over the top either."
"Drinkability is moderate. Decent flavors are easily consumed, but high alcohol definitely limits this beer. Tastey, but not quite what I was hoping for."
"This beer wasn't nearly as oily and thick as some of the other Imperial IPAs I've tried making for a much more pleasant drinking experience. Suprisingly, this beer goes down pretty easily even given the high alcohol content and enormous IBU level. This one could sneak up on you."
"Damn, this is a big beer. Dark brownish red, not much head at all. Reeking of citrusy hops, and tastes as it smells. Overloaded with hops right to the edge of ridiculous. Orangy, grapefruit, malty, on the sweet side, anything worth doing is worth overdoing, is the motto, I guess. Just because of the intensity, this is not a beer I'd want more than one of; more of a sipping beer. Definitely a must-try for IPA and DIPA fans."
"Good GOD! This Devil Dancer was an explosion from start to finish-- I got smacked in the face with hops right out from the pour. I could smell those hops a-wafting several inches above the glass. It was pretty slow-going to drink this baby, but it went down alright. It felt pretty decent in my mouth- hoppy and of course bitter. The alcohol wasn't noticable until the aftertaste, where I may have breathed just a bit of fire. Overall, this was definitely a fun one, and would recommend to any fellow hophead. Everyone else beware!"
"drinkability is decent. there are only so many hops that one can throw into a brew without allowing the character to get so saturated that the flavors themselves are discounted in the name of the hops, and this one broke the threshold quite a few sips ago. that being said, the richness and blast of hops is enough to cover up the 13% APV, which is a notable achievement."
"M&D: This is a Full bodied beer that coats the palate. No carbonation makes it a little to syrupy. At 13% ABV this is strong. I don't know if it fits into the DIPA category or not, it almost has more of a BW feel. I paired this with a sharp cheddar, and I think it enhanced the taste quite a bit. I'm glad I tried this, but just a little over the top for my taste. Skal."
"I love the hops, but the alcohol is a bit hot at times, as to be expected given such a high ABV. One is enough to sip on, but I know I will be enjoying more of these in the future."
"Pours brown in color with some ruby highlights. Rigorous pour creates no head whatsoever. Any head that tried to form was sucked back down into the devils lair. Smell is piney hops with plenty of malt to back it up. Kind of barleywine-ish. The first thing that strikes me upon tasting is the smoothness and full mouthfeel that it has. Not a tongue ripping TRIPA, but an incredibly smooth and easy drinking beer. Dangerously, there is absolutely, positively, no sign of the 13% alcohol that it states on the label. This beer runs down your throat and begs for another trip before you've even put the glass down. If you have multiple bottles in the fridge, this has potential to be a real shit-kicking night ender. Due to the incredible amount of malt that has been placed in this beer, I have to say that I think this would be great even after it ages for a while and the hops die down. Great beer, from an even better brewery. Oh, and did I mention that it is too easy to drink."
"Pours a hazy, autumn leaf reddish orange and smells heavily of peppery esters with a hint of fresh baked bread. The flavor is dominated by biscuit and caramel malts and and the aforementioned pepper burn. A faint citrus hop twinge pops up toward the back of the tongue and finishes quite bitter w/ a touch of melon. Tastes similar to some Dogfish efforts, but the balance seems a bit lopsided here - not sure if its that the hops aren't super fresh or if the malt sweetness and alcohol are just overkill. Mouthfeel is pretty nice, very resinous and coating, but not too viscous. The hot/bitter end helps cleanse the palate even though its still fully coated. Leaves off nice and warm, sorta apropos of the name. A bit devilish I suppose. A good DIPA, but not quite to my tastes - I seem to prefer the west coast citrus/pine bombs on the thinner side."
"M/D - Full bodied and chewy. Very warming beer. Excellent to sip but I am not sure I could do more than one."
"One negative thing about this beer is the alcohol presence. Considering the fact that it's 13% however, it's not horrible. Either way it does make it slightly less drinkable. Overall, a very tasty DIPA. However, since it cost me 16 dollars for a four pack it's not too likely that I'll be drinking this often."
"I can't wait for Founders to make it into NC. This beer totally kicks ass.(I might have been feeling the alcohol when I made this statement last night but after further reflection I stand by my initial declaration)"
"Overall, my first """triple IPA", and an interesting expereiment. Good, but not something I shout about. I like Founders beers (so far), and I like this one, but don't love it."
"it pours an amber color with red highlights. seems very hoppy with stong aftertaste. the bitterness hits just at the end of the sip. the alcohol is warming. thick and syrupy, but it still goes down smooth."
"d - watch out! if it didn't say 13% on the bottle i never would have guessed it. goes down easily."
"This particular brew is best poured by simply turning the bottle upside down and letting it glurg into your pint glass. This gives a nice aromatic and tenacious head that laces very nicely. Very malty, even sweetish, yet not as hoppy nor alcoholic as one might expect. Definitely not a session beer, in fact, as delicious as one is, two is definitely too many."
"Pours a cloudy deep amber/copper color with a minimal head and little lacing. Aroma says Hops with capitol letters. Grapefruit, pine, resin, flowers they are all there. A little caramel malt tries its best to peak through. Taste is a sticky caramel malt infused with pine trees, grapefruits, resins, etc. Not as overly bitter as I thought it might be, or maybe my palette has been killed by IBU's. Thick mouthfeel, medium carbonation. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, decent brew."
"Drinkability: killer beer here. The high ABV puts a damper on having more than one or two in a session, but this is relatively easy to quaff this faster than you should."
"Glad I had to opportunity to try this one..."
"I had been waiting for this for ages and the local Binny's provides as if by magic. Intrigued to investigate this ultra-hopped monster. Pours a rich syrupy chestnut (lovely warm color) with very little carbonation evident, no head, minimal lacing. Dark malty, floral hop aroma. On the palate, noticeable sweetness to begin, complex caramel malt tones, I did not think the hops overdone here oddly enough, stretching out to a lingering drier espresso bitter finish. It was redolent of an aged oloroso sherry or Madeira and almost the same alcohol level. Also thought it a bit like a darker, maltier Brown Shugga with more depth. Others have commented on the obvious alcohol (it is high); but I did not find it intrusive at all. Sipping and contemplation essential."
"This beer is just too over the top for my tastes. This is clearly more of a liqueur along the Gran Marnier line, or perhaps an aggressively hopped up version of a barley wine is an apt description, but as a double IPA, this is just too much. I do not care for the throaty alcohol burn and prefer instead beers that mask their rather high ABV. At 13%, maybe that is asking too much. The beer pours a ruby brown, with a sticky and syrupy consistency, minimal lacing, no head, no retention. The smell is the best part and outstanding in its own right. The aroma is intense brown sugars, caramel, liqueur, thick syrupy malts, and heavy fruits of the fig and raisin variety. The taste is just overpowered by the alcohol, but underneath it all you will find a pretty hopped up beer, and intense brown sugar malts, caramels, and liqueur ... lots of it. This is a thick and full bodied beer with quite a throaty aftertaste that will requires some neutralization before trying anything else. I would suggest drinking this one last in any beer tasting session. good luck with this one. I don't think I can finish it. It truly is a sipping beer."
"D - it takes an hour or more to finish one, but it's time well spent."
"D: What qualifies as """drinkable""" for a 13% ABV Triple IPA? This is definitely a sipping beer, and not one to be taken lightly. It is very boozy when young, so some age might take the edge off a bit. Can't say I'd reach for one of these often or invest in more than a few a year. Still, it's an interesting """extreme""" beer that truly pushes the envelope."
"Very creamy and chewy mouthfeel. This is a definite sipper. Long, long bitter finish. I've been wanting to try this for awhile and it didn't disappoint. Thanks again to EliteDigger. This was a nice treat."
"Pours a soupy deep ruby and brown with slight haze and a thick off white head that hangs around all day (vigorous pour) Nose is of malt sweetness and thick hop resin. Taste follows with significant hop resin flavors and a very sweet thick malt body. Some citrus/pine hop flavors in here, and alot of spiced hop flavors as well. Malt presence is huge. Alcohol on the finish, with lingering hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is VERY viscous and syrupy. Drinkability is pretty amazing for the 13% abv. Overall a very interesting beer. Very much a sipper, but sure doesn't feel like it. An enjoyable brew, but one is enough for about a year. I think I prefer Midnight Sun's Gluttony, but just by a nose or so. They're both good."
"An excellent beer, a top notch Imperial IPA. Incredible smoothness for the huge hoppy flavor and clinging bitterness. An entirely relaxing and immensely enjoyable beer. Please go buy some."
"D- Strong alcohol, strong flavor. Another great brew from Founders."
"I've been wanting to try Devil Dancer for quite some time, the beer was good, but not great. This 'triple' IPA poured a deep copperish red. I tried to get a decent head each pour but was left with sparce thin caps. Moderate lacing from such a sparce head. Smell was pungent sweetness and hot alcohol hops. Taste was a nice balance of caramel malt and piney resiny hops. The alcohol heat makes it hard to discern much of anything, but thats not a bad thing in my book. Mouthfeel was blasted to death by alcohol and hops. Perhaps the sweetness lasted too long. I drank two of these brews in a sitting and found it to be quite enough."
"This is amazing, well-crafted stuff that is of course very filling, so definitely built to savor."
"Definitely strong and a sipper, but a refined and soothing one that can be enjoyed and appreciated with each sip."
"D- a great sipper"
"This is a bruiser, although I enjoyed the hell out of it; the complexity & abv weigh on you after a while"
"D : Definitely a sipper. Touch to finish a entire bottle."
"This is an interesting beer. At first it hints at a big West Coast hoppiness, but it's balanced out nicely with some bold sweet flavors. For a beer that boasts high IBUs, it's really a dynamic beer, not one that just rakes your palate with extreme hoppiness."
"Additional notes added on 7-23-11"
"7/3/10 edit. Tried this beer fresh and on tap at the Big Hunt yesterday. While marginally better then what I tried previously, the fact remains that this is a sweet, boozy, borderline unbalanced DIPA that is about as undrinkable as any DIPA I've ever sampled. Obviously, it's popular with some folks, but I'll be damned if I can see the appeal."
"T: Very little carbonation, thicker medium body and smooth, almost syrup like. Very strong malt body throughout resulting in a sweeter flavor than expected with a very dry, complex bitter hop finish. Mostly a piney taste, not much citrus. More of a barley wine than a IIPA. As expected for 13%, alcohol is very present and lingers in the finish. I'm not particularly crazy about this beer and will probably avoid this in the future."
"A few more sips in, (and yes the alcohol is quite warming during and after the swallow but we're talking 13%abv) the malt really asserts itself as it should in a well made example of the style. I've had some DIPAs that take it *too* far to the malty side and they were overly sweet and cloying and some that didn't have enough of a malt presence and were overly hoppy. This one finds a very happy medium and I thank Founders for that. Very deicious drop indeed!"
"This is definitely a sipping beer that could probably be aged a bit in the cellar to soften up the hot alcohol. Overall it's very tasty and a hopheads dream."
"Being a hot boozy 13% ABV beer, Devil Dancer is an appropriate name for this fine beer from Founders."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Smokestack Goblet. Poured a silky, chocolate brown, with almost an oily texture. There was no head whatsoever. I actually thought that I had a flat beer with the carbonation was present in the mouthfeel. I poured it rather aggressively and all I could get was a handful of small white bubbles. Smell is huge. There is a huge hop bouquet with sweet malts following quickly. Also notes of raisins and chocolate. The taste of the beer is hops. It's just huge. Probably one of the hopiest beers I have ever had. It is also one of the most acidic beers I have ever drank also. It's hard to drink because of its acidity. Mouthfeel is good. More like a barleywine then a DIPA. It's really had to drink. If the acidity would be turned down then the beer would be much easier to drink."
"-Kevin."
"The beer pours a rusted orange/amber hue with a thin tan head. There is no lacing to speak of during the beer. The nose on this beer is about as complex as you will find in a beer. I think this smells more like a barleywine than an IIPA. The heaviest scents include the very rich maltiness with heavy tropical fruit, resinous pine, and sweet caramel. There is also a cognac like booze smell coming from this beer. Each time I put my nose into it I get something new! The nose is really well done on this one. The flavor profile is equally as intense. For an IIPA the taste is more malt based on this beer. The malt is the heavy hitter here with flavors of caramel and brown sugar and rum soaked raisins. The hop profile comes in after a few seconds but plays second to the malt profile. The hop profile tastes of fresh grapefruit rind and sticky pine. There is some sharp alcohol flavor as well, but in no ways takes away from this beer but adds another unique quality to this beer. This beer will challenge your palate. I don't think this beer crosses the """boozy""" line on the mouthfeel, but I personally don't mind the alcohol on the mouthfeel. This beer is full-bodied and has a velvety texture. I will stop praising this beer when it comes to drinkability though. At 13% you wouldn't last very long with many of these. I had one 12 ounce bottle and that was enough for me for a while."
"Dark caramel to maroon color. Very light beige head. Smell is mellow, malty and creamy with perhaps a bit of vanilla. Taste is dark and malty, but hopped only to balance, I found after the year of age took its toll. Somewhat well hidden alcohol for 13% and drank more like a barley wine than an extremely overhopped beer. Lingering dull earthy hop flavor and some alcohol in the background. I thougt this was ok, but not fantastic."
"4/3/2.5/2.5/2.5"
"D - It's pretty heavy and high in alcohol. A sipper. I'll drink this one and probably not revisit this until next years batch."
"A decent DIPA, but too heavy on the malt for my liking. Actually, just too heavy in general; this beer has no finesse."
"D: Just too much alcohol for this to be anything more than a sipper. But it is a damn good sipper."
"This was a weird one for me. I loved the taste but was expecting something different, hoppier I guess. Still a good brew."
"I highly recommend for IPA lovers!"
"O: This is a big beer that doesn't feel the need to rely on over-doing one aspect of it's own style. I don't feel this is a hop-bomb at all. A well balanced, quaffable IIPA that could only disappoint serious hop heads. This is sure to be one of my new favorite seasonals."
"Overall the most extreme IPA I've ever had. Nothing else is even close. Founder's describes it as a """Triple IPA", and they are dead-on."
"The other day I read in the forums that someone compared a certain aged DIPA to a barleywine, and now I totally understand that comparison. The sweet, complex malt bill has pushed forward onto your palate while the tastebud killing hops have retreated. Anyhow, I don't love barleywines so this aged version isn't my favorite. It is interesting though, and if the hops are too strong in Devil Dancer for you initially, I'd consider aging it for a couple months or more."
"D: Very big beer and as a result a beer that takes time to drink, though as it warms its sweetness borders along cloying and you get really full from drinking 12oz of it, not to mentioned a bit buzzed, still enjoyable and still a must try for any hophead."
"This one certainly reminds me of a barleywine or strong ale, more so then an IIPA; though it does state it's a Triple IPA (which would be my first). I really enjoyed the beer but I must admit that I was expecting more of a hop bomb. Pace yourself, packs a nice punch."
"Split a bottle with a few friends. While the alcohol is very well hidden, it's reasonably thick considering the 13% alcohol. The nose was all fruity citrus hops - like big-time fruit punch with orange and grapefruit leading the charge. The flavors offers more juicy hops along with a sweet malt backbone. It finishes with a decent bitterness and a more herbal hop aftertaste. Frankly I'm not surprised this isn't more bitter, I think there's just too much malt for this to really whack your palate. Still a tasty and fun beer that I'm glad I tried."
"Overall, its a good brew with a nice alcohol content. I would get it again but its a little pricey. I MIGHT get this again."
"Founders has yet to disapoint this guy."
"D- hmm not really as in your face as I expected. Overall thought this was a hoppy BW than an actual DIPA and much sweeter than I ever would have expected. Really seems a bit unbalanced on the sweet side which just seems out of place for something that claims to be a triple IPA. this is the first Founder's beer that I've had outside of the Breakfast stout and KBS and while it is good, the sweetness get to me after awhile. Wish there was a bit more hops to balance it out."
"As much as I love huge IPAs, this one suffers in drinkability. Not only is the malt somewhat out of balance, the hops themselves don't all agree within the profile, with the alcohol throwing things in an even more intense direction. For all the negatives of this beer, I'm finding myself hooked on it."
"I had this one in the bottle about a year or so ago when it was fresh. I thought I was going to love it back then, but was disappointed. I just had a fresh bottle again tonight (which I just picked up in Chicago), and I was still disappointed. In contrast, I also just had DD on tap at the Maproom in Chicago and thought it was incredible. The tap version is quite malty, but with a strong blast of fresh hop aroma and hop flavor along with a sizable bitterness. I would call it a """clean, hoppy, malty, American barleywine""" instead of some sort of IPA, but whatever you call it...it was fantastic. In fact, I liked it so much, I had a second snifter of it. On the other hand, the bottled version seems to have a fairly complex fruity/malty flavor along with an adequate bitterness, but the hop flavor and aroma are severely lacking compared to the tap version. The bottled version also has a strong dirtiness to it as well which wasn't in the tap version. The bottled version (even though it was fresh) tastes very much like it's been aged for many months. It appears that Founders is one of many breweries where the bottled beers taste significantly different/inferior to the tap versions. I like the Founders beers I've had quite a lot, but to taste them at their best, it seems you need to have them on tap. My review of DD is based on the superior tap version."
"D- It was a decent sipper. The high ABV would keep me from drinking more than a small serving at any one sitting."
"All around a job well done by Founders... This is my first Founders brew and I look forward to sampling many of their others..."
"Devil Dancer Triple IPA 13 % ABV . Label is colored a reddish /auburn hue . There is a woman who is being held by the Devil no doubt with orange flames comming from underneath . Smell is some hops and very """ boozy """. Alcohol aroma is very prominent . On the tongue it is hot and intense . As the alcohol warms it is not very pleasant . The lacing in nice to look at all over the glass . Few more sips solidifies my thoughts that this is just too boozy , medicinal . Booze bomb that is harsh , thick , and just not worth trying again . The Devil Dancer will leave your throat and mouth with an oily fire ."
"This is a very tasty but also distinct DIPA, one reminiscent of barleywine to a degree with its strong, thick taste extending well beyond well-hopped. Very impressive, Devil Dancer is a DIPA around which to tread warily."
"This taste nothing like a DIPA. It's a good and interesting beer but I'm not sure if I'll try another."
"One of the best beers I've had yet"
"Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and a bit oily in a good way. You are not going to be sipping this beast in the summer that's for sure. Very large brew. This is an American Barleywine despite being labeled as a TIPA, but who cares about styles? It's a good beer and you should try it."
"D- Not hugely drinkable I loved to enjoy this one. An awesome TIPA, I would recommend it to any hophead out there as one of the best and by far the best that is semi-commonly available."
"this beer poured an orangish-brown with very little head. the smell was mostly hops with a bit of fruitiness and spice also present in the nose. there is a good balance of malty sweetness to go along with the hop bitterness. the finish is a bit bitter. this beer seemed to be a bit thinner than i expected, but it seemed to get a bit better as time passed. this is a fairly easy to drink beer, although, due to the high abv, i couldn't handle more than one or so."
"This beer poured a clear brown with very little head. The aroma is very hoppy with a slight sweetness noticeable. The taste is very, very hoppy with a sweet, citrus flavor also noticeable. I think it turned my tongue inside out! This is an excellent beer, but might be a bit intense for easy drinking."
"I could only drink two of these in one sitting and the alcohol will sneak up on you so handle with care. Over all it is very drinkable and I highly recommend it. I think this stuff will continue age nicely."
"Yep...one of my new favorites within the style. A monster but not really a hop bomb. Pours a murky ruby orange/mahogany color. Thin head that forms a ring and sticky lacing down the glass. Smell is a fresh and piney blast of hops with an impressive malt backbone. Caramel and biscuity malt waft into the air. A bittery crisp sugared grapefruit as well. Taste is just as good as the smell. A well balanced beast of a brew, if that's possible. Slightly warming alcohol but not 13% warm. Resinous and oily in the mouth. A little tickle on the tongue but more of a creamy sensation and big body. Great drinkability. Founders does it again."
"Smell is caramel malts, pretty sweet, very boozy with a big hop presence as well. Smells a lot like a big hoppy barleywine. Taste is right on for a barleywine as well. Sweet malts balanced with big alcohol and hops. Mouthfeel is kind of sticky, medium low carbonation. Drinkability is limited by how big this one is, i guess they give you appropriate warning but this should probably just be labeled a barley wine."
"Overall Impression: Wow. Hard core beer, but really well made and really good to drink. The profile reminds me of Arrogant Bastard and 120 minute IPA, heavy west coast hops with a firm malt back. Seriously good beer, strongly recommended."
"Yeah, I'ld drink this again. I love a good IIPA. to me, strong hoppy beers are something to look forward too. This is not something to turn down. If you do I'll drink it for you."
"D: I would love to try this one from the brewery. Not exactly sure how old this one is but I'd say no younger than 9months. High alcohol and barleywine like potency make this a 1 beer sipper though easy to finish."
"Edit: Got to up the drinkability a bit. I crave this beer every once in a while, so that's got to say something."
"I seem to have picked a good day to open this beer because it seems just right. The hops are not too hot but they are not flat or cardboard tasting. Im curious to see how this one tastes fresh but it certainly holds well for a few months (the one Im drinking is probably about a year old now). Getting close to a barleywine if aged longer."
"D-I like this one but the big hops and the high ABV will limit me to one. Having said that, I am not sure what I would go to next as my pallete is surely ruined."
"d: I'll certainly have more of these, but not too terribly often."
"I was expecting a hop-bomb. This hardly fits that description. It's not a bad beer by any stretch, but I think I would like it better if it were called a barleywine, rather than a """triple IPA.""" I mean hell, it isn't even a single IPA, let alone a double or triple."
"D: This is a great triple IPA, but it's pretty intense. It's definitely not something to be drank in a session, but one here and there is a nice treat."
"If the devil did brew a beer this is likely the kind of tantalizing, tempting tipple I bet he'd brew. Wheat Wine. Double IPA. Triple IPA - whatever it is it is something unique and something special. It is also a fantastic drinking beer, especially given its strength. I'm always down for a dance with the devil - it's ironically a rather heavenly experience."
"On a trip to Michigan I picked up a mix of locals... I made the mistake of trying this one first without first reading the label... 13% and very filling... It' looked, smelled and tasted great but it was about the only beer I tried that night. Maybe I am old but it was strong enough and filling enough that I should have had it at the end of the night rather than the beginning."
"Overall- At first this kicks your ass, but half way through the strong alc calms down in your mouth and the flavor pops."
"Good red body with no head served in a snifter at the brewpub. There is a strong citrus hop aroma. The flavor matches the aroma, but with a very pronounced hop bitterness in addition to the hop flavor. The malty background manages to balance this beer somehow. It is surprising light for the flavor; around medium body."
"D- I think it is a very tasty brew. Not sure how much of it I could drink but I wouldn't mind more of these at all."
"One and done knocks drinkability down a notch. Would like more but I also like to walk. More like a hoppy barleywine than a double IPA but does it matter?"
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"This definitely a beer to enjoy casually and in no rush. Very nice, but I wish the alcohol was pushed back a little. I know, that's hard to do with a 13% abv."
"D - Very full flavored and full of strength, but very drinkable for all the punch it contains. It is both full of hop taste and alcohol which makes for an intensely big ale, as big as most barleywines if not bigger. A very in your face, take no prisoners kind of experience. Up front with malt and intensely flavored hops and bitterness, yet still manages to hold on to some sweetness in the finish. About as balanced as you can imagine a 13% Triple IPA could be. Don't miss a chance to take a wild ride w/ a Devil Dancer!"
"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for sharing this beauty, and especially for doing so with a surprise package that appeared on my doorstep this afternoon."
"Pours a deep (Ron) burgundy with very little head and lacing. Smells of dark dried fruit, fig, plum and piney hops. Tastes very similar to the smells. The strong elements remind me of a barleywine. Sweet and hoppy. Though this is a thick beer the extreme ABV is not as noticeable as you would think. Drinkability is good considering. Overall worth trying."
"Cheers!"
"Thanks to grynder33 for sending this a few months back."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Interesting beer, and definitely worth a try. I'm really not sure I have any reason to come back to this one, though. It's not very drinkable and I'd much rather take a nice citrusy DIPA with moderate, balanced bitterness."
"it does have a very tart aftertaste. but i love this beer"
"Drinkability - this is excellent ale. It is hearty and delicious. It is also easily drinkable in spite of its high abv. The high abv does limit the sessionability, but this goes down so easy, and is so delicious that it would be easy to get carried away. Also this is listed here as a DIPA, but I regard it as an American Barley Wine, and an excellent one at that."
"Pours murky dark amber color with creamy dark, tan head. Smell is of thick caramel malt & a syrupy like hop juice. Taste reminds me at first a little of hopslam, then the malty balance kicks in slowly. This has a sticky and sweet characteristic. There is also a warming alcohol presence toward the end of each sip."
"A """stiff""" beer but very good overall. well worth the effort"
"If you have ever been out drinking and made the last beer of the night be the one that in reality you really should not have gotten as your last beer and in fact maybe made it the beer you had the night before cause it packed such a punch, well this would be that one."
"Had this in a bottle at Monk's the last time I stopped there. The beer was a pleasant copper collor with a nice head. The smell was suprisingly very citrusy with a lot of hop smell. The taste was great. For a double IPA, it has a small amount of hop kick to it. The beer was very carbonated but quite very drinkable."
"D: I'd say he alcohol heat detracts slightly from the drinkability score. Other than that, this is an incredible beer well worth the hype!"
"Don't make the mistake of doing a taste test between this and DFH 90min. You start speaking in toungs and have to ask people what happened last night."
"An interesting beer for sure. Barleywine or DIPA it's hard to say. The dark fruit and hot alcohol make my lean towards American Barleywine. Regardless of this, enjoyable and a good sipper in the winter. I wouldn't rush back to it, but I can see seeking this out from time to time when the mood hits."
"Just didn't do it for me. alcohol heat overwhelmed everything else here other than syrupy maltiness. Looked ok, nice dark amber with a decent, though short-lived head. Aroma was sweet and pungent alcohol, very little hops. Taste was harsh and raw, not much balance at all. Too strong to enjoy."
"Looking at my notes, I'd say only Dogfish 120 compares. Goose Island's Imperial IPA, Hercules, Dreadnaught, Ruination - these are paragons of moderation and balance compared to Devil Dancer. I have to give Founders props for their willingness to make a beer like it, and while Devil Dancer is not a beer I would drink very often, it's certainly a beer I'll drink again."
"The high abv and the prevalance of said abv makes this a one timer for the session (and the day for that matter)."
"D- As it warmed and my palate became increasingly numb, I found this to be more enjoyable and drinkable. Well done Founders."
"Appearance is cloudy tangerine, minor amount of soapy head that dissipates quickly. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is a fresh pine forest. Taste- holy shit is that hoppy!!! Waves of bitterness (grapefruit rind, pine) are pulsating out of this nasty bugger of a beer. The inside of my mouth is a dehyrdated mess after a few sips. Must be a fresh bottle! Caramel malts try to bring a little something to the dance, but its tough. Mouthfeel is pretty quite good. Carbonation is low, but this is not nearly as sweet and cloying as I though it might be. Without a doubt, this is the most bitter beer I've ever had. It would make DFH 120 IPA weep like a child in fear of it. Thank christ it only comes on a 12 ounce bottle- you'd be in the fetal position after a bomber. Thanks Harry- this was F'n great!"
"huge hop flavor, but the beer behind it will not be upstaged. so much going onthis could very much be a barleywine. nice beer, actually (why """actually"""? because it's a goddam monster and sometimes those are just too much) and the 13% is well hidden"
"Pours a stunning foggy ruby red with a one finger off white head that quickly dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Stickiness is there, syrupy much? Smell is of alcohol, sadly, but with 13% abv what else do you expect? Mixed in is some lemon peel with an oily pine aroma. Also, tiny bits of caramel malt apper in the nose as well. Taste is well, a barleywine? My goodness slick, oily hops race over the tongue with flavors of evergreen and grapefruit. For such a hop bomb, there is significant malty sweetness which I find balances out this fairly well. Aftertaste drys the mouth a bit, but not too much. Mouthfeel is very syrupy and thick with hardly any carbonation at all. This is a beast, sip and enjoy."
"rerate: sweet zombie jesus, this is awesome. The fact that Stone IPA is on the Top 100 and this isn't is just more proof that the Atheists are right."
"Overall: A really good beer. Much more aggressive than you would expect out of Founders who I feel usually do a great job of refining styles. With this one they are blazing paths. It has earned its classification as a triple, and should not be consumed by the faint of heart."
"D: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easily for a beer with such a high ABV, not very filling, I liked this beer a lot, but it's definitely one that is a sipper instead of a pounder, because after one or two (three at the most) you're pretty much done for the night. It also seemed more like a barley wine than a """Triple IPA""" unless the difference between double and triple IPA means that there's a lot less hops and lot more sweetness and alcohol. Putting the gray areas between style boundaries behind, this is still a hardcore and very good beer, which I liked a lot."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass from a 12 oz. stubby bottle. Poured a dark, somewhat hazy copper brown color. Almost no head formed except for a small coating atop the beer, therefore leaving no lace. Smell was almost intoxicating. Major hops, a little sweet maltiness in the background, spices, a generous amount of alcohol. I enjoyed the flavor a bit more than the aroma. Very aggressive hops bomb your taste buds, sweet malt. Somewhat peppery and spicy. Alcohol isn't overwhelming. Finishes somewhat citrusy with a ton more hops. Is actually somewhat balanced. Mouthfeel was thick and syrupy, with no carbonation. Full bodied. Drinkability is limited. Very sippable."
"Wonderfully creative and different...great simply to have the experience. However, I am not as enamored as most of these reviews. For me, extremism does not make this a superior beer regardless of how interesting it may be."
"I saw this one at a store once and it was something like $18 for a 4 pack so I said no way. So I must give thanks again to Kane Sweeney for this beer he threw in for free in our trade...a god among men!"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a very deep golden/amber with a heavy haze. There is almost no head to speak of. Aromas of orange and sweet toffee. The smell is delicious. Flavors consist of toffee, grapefruit, and caramel. The alohol shows up with a nice little sting on the tip of your tounge, finishing off with a lasting bitterness. Mouthfeel is very oily. Very light carbonation. This is definately a full-bodied beer. I love IIPAs, and this one for me ranks near the best I have had."
"This one is a good drinker. The 13% ABV is no secret but it's not distracting."
"Not an everyday beer one for special occasions I would say,now I just need to find that occasion."
"I first sampled this beer at the Extreme Beer Fest in Boston. Although my favorite of the fest was definitely Founders Kentucky Breakfast Stout, this one was certainly up there. It pours a orange red/amber, with no head at all, despite a somewhat vigorous pour. The aroma is big citrusy hops, sweet orange and some grapefruit. Taste is just a big hop punch, tons of citrus, with the malty sweetness mostly hidden but still somewhat apparent. The alcohol is present but amazingly diguised for 13%. A little carbonation would be nice, but I think that being just slightly effervescent works for a beer of this strength. At $15 for a four pack, this is a beer I won't be drinking too often, but I can't say its not worth the price."
"Thanks to demcorhip once more for the great beer. This one was extreme."
"The double (triple?) IPA tour continues...this beer is just what the doctor ordered for your hop deficiency. Take one of these and your hop jones will be put to bed, literally if you have more than one at 13% ABV."
"There's so much going on with this massive beer I almost don't know where to start. The pour is deep, murky orange-brown, with a billowy head. Monster hop nose. First taste is a creamy, caramel maltiness, immediately followed by a cascade of hoppiness, with notes of pine, orange, grapefruit, maybe even a little ginger (?). Resiny, billowing mouthfeel. It also has some barleywine-type qualities. Aftertaste is more of the delicious, complex hop whallop. The alcohol is notable, but you'd never guess it's 13%. Complex and intense, an absolutely amazing beer."
"D: One bottle'll do you just fine. Any more and the next morning will be one messy hangover."
"Bottle courtesy of Moejuck: Poured a deep cloudy orangey color ale with a small white foamy head with limited retention. Aroma consists of huge bitter piney and citrus hops are dominating unsurprisingly. Body is very sweet and has a great malt backbone which provides a bit of balance with some of the hops. Body is full with some low carbonation and no alcohol could be directly noticeable, which is quite a feat at 13$ ABV. Overall, I thought this was an interesting experiment at the intersection of an IIPA, barley wine and American Strong Ale."
"Not a bad beer at all from Founders."
"ORIGINAL - 5/19/07 - 4/4/3.5/4/3 - Got this one at Monk's the other day after trying some other excellent Founders brews. Pours a nice amber-orange color with a nice frothy head. Nose is strong on hops, floral and fruity (especially grapefruit sourness). Taste is on the edge for me. It's incredibly strong on the bitter hops, and those hit you up front - potentially a little too hard, in my head. The whole beer through it went back and forth from being too hoppy to just right for me, which is strange. That excessive hoppiness just seemed astringent, sour in the mouth. When it was good, it was tasty, but it just didn't seem consistent enough. Feel was solid, full body, good carbonation. I honestly couldn't finish this whole one; had a friend help me out with it, mostly because the hoppiness was so huge and full that it was just a little too much for me. Taste is interesting and full, but this just isn't one I could have too often (the ABV doesn't help either). Maybe every once in a while."
"Drinkability - one for me and i'm done."
"I would've loved to see a chunky off white head on this one, but sadly I think the 13% makes that near impossible. Drinking this """beer""" I can't help but think of it as some sort of 90 minute/Bigfoot blend. I wish I could brew a 13% IIIPA this good. I love it."
"Tasty for sure and a remarkable over-the-top hop bomb."
"Definitly one you must try if hops are your thing!"
"Bottle received in trade. Good gracious this is fantastic! Pours thick with a dark orange-amber burst color. The flavor is huge and complex. Alot of stuff going on here; malts, hops, tropical fruit. For 13%, it's well hidden. I love my strong IPA's and this is up there with the best I have had, simply and utterly fantastic! Crap I wish Founders was available in this area, I'd certainly be a regular supporter."
"A very impressive beer, simply another great one from founders. For such a huge beer in both hops and alcohol, it's surprisingly mellow. I'd say a little bit of aging might do it some good, but honestly it's perfectly balanced fresh. Good job founders."
"Holy Shit! I've tried some serious IPAs, but this is ridiculous. Not a drinker, a sipper for sure. Kinda rough, but that's fun every now and then. I really enjoyed it, but it was one and done."
"Considering the high alcohol and hoppiness, I found it surprisingly drinkable. Though the closer I got to the bottom of the glass, the happier I was that I only had a single bottle. Definitely a sipper."
"Pours a very deep copper with no head. Aroma is very hoppy with some citrus coming through. Taste is bitter hops with a nice blend of pine and citrus. Malty sweetness provides a decent base to keep it drinkable. Mouthfeel is a little on the syrupy side. Definitely a sipper. Fine DIPA but not exceptional IMO."
"The drinkability is good. The strong bitterness lingers on the tongue. I don't think I could enjoy more than one per session."
"Drinkability is average. This brew is for hard core hop heads only. That said it is a pretty decent brew in this style."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a slight offwhite head that fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm malty scent along with an almost sweet hop aroma that is quite bitter. It seems to be well balanced; at least in the nose. The taste is great! It has a nice malt base that goes down smooth and finishes warm and dry. The hops really mellow the high alcohol. It's a very bitter brew with loads of hop character. It leaves a hop residue on your tongue following the swallow. The mouthfeel is fine. It's a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is one hoppy brew. The taste lingers minutes after the swallow. It's warm and well balanced. This is a beer you can really relax with; a good drinker."
"Wow, what a fantastic Triple IPA! At 13%, this is one you definitley want to take your time with. The Devil Dancer is definitely strong on the pallet but it's excellent balance keeps it quite drinkable. Definitely recommended!"
"This beer poured a-not-too-shiny copper red with a good amount of head which quickly faded to a thin lace. Aroma is quite hoppy and sweet...the hops smell almost caramel-y. Flavor is highly bitter and astringent...you taste the bitterness in the front of your tongue, and you feel it in the back of your throat. This beer is quite dry and crisp and masks its 13% ABV quite well. Very drinkable for a DIPA."
"As it warms the bitterness seems to decrease but that just may be the alcohol effect. This is a good beer and worth trying for any hop lover."
"Drinkability: 13% ABV really impairs this, I would often love to have another after finishing this but under most circumstances it would be a bad idea."
"Although this is a very good beer, drinkability is just above average. Definitely for hop lovers, this is a bold beer that is best enjoyed in moderation."
"Fresh 07 bottle courtesy of hoppymeal. Pours a ruby red and copper with a thin, half-inch head that quickly dissipates. Whats left over clings to the glass and leaves a nice lacing - a trait I find in most all Founders beers. Poking my nose into this one I get a lot of sweet hops - most apricot and apple as well as caramel malt. Fairly big and alcoholic in the nose. Funny, but the hop bitterness is just missing from this beer - especially given its reputation and high IBUs. Its sweet and cloying - not in a completely bad way, but not what you would expect. Definitely big on the sugary malts. Alcoholic and somewhat astringent - not what I would classify as a IIPA or barleywine by any stretch. Definitely an interesting beer, but not one I will go out of my way for again. The one beer from Founders that Ive had that misses the mark. Im curious to try a year+ old bottle Ive been cellaring to see if it mellows/improves."
"I would love to try this beer on tap. Too bad I live in Texas."
"Fucking great."
"Pours a beautiful thick head that retains very nicely leaving a slight lacing. The color is a good brown. The smell is immediatly hoppy with grapefruitiness. Very fresh and strong are these smells. The taste is a blast of hoppiness that's smooth and rich. I love the taste of this one. The mouthfeel is good and a little creamy. Overall I think this beer is great and would love to have more!"
"BIg, boozy, verging on a Barleywine in terms of m/f and drinkability. One and done for me..."
"Overall, this beer hits and misses on different levels. The flavors seem a bit too flat. And nothing really stands out except the bitter finish. It's a good beer, but I've had better. Worth a try, and if nothing else... it's a pretty interesting beer to taste."
"Very drinkable for a beer this big, overall outstanding, I would drink a lot of this if it were more readily available."
"Smooth body, but the alcohol is too hot and the sweetness too cloying. This is very much a sipping beer. Though this is a bit too intense for me, there is nothing necessarily bad going on here. Just be aware that you are getting into some serious brew."
"D: Teetering on the brink of a barleywine but this brew has more taste than any barleywine that I have tried to date. Incredibly well balanced for the 13.00 ABV. The alcohol in this beer is nearly undetectable. A sipper to be savored and enjoyed over time."
"Mouthfeel- Much smoother than a fresh bottle. The high IBUs made this a hard to swallow beer. I love IPAs. Even though the aged version is still a sipper, much easier to relax and feel. The fresh stuff sort of makes you jump. Both are good, but in there own way."
"Overall, this was a very interesting and unique beer. Its color, mouthfeel and taste were more similar to that of a barleywine than a DIPA. Nevertheless, a very good and memorable offering."
"Poured a deep cloudy and hazy amber, pretty much the perfect color for a Triple IPA, or at least that I would like to see. No real head on this, only a very thin film which quickly daeded leaving a decent lace. Lots of carbonation, tiny bit of sediment, only real loss of score here would be on the lack of head. Smell was classic Hop Bomb, deep pine resin, with a strong alcohol presence upon first smell, as it warmed some of the more subtle scents started to come through, a slight sugary sweetness and citrus, specifically grapefruit were now there to be found. Overall smell was very nice, not over powering, but did have enough to tingle the nose a bit. Taste was very crisp, clean, and warming. Alcohol was a big factor in the beginning again, with a huge pine hop hit. Letting it warm brings out the malt that was trying to balance it with a bit of sweetness, but is still overpowered by the hops. This was a very good brew, and I am glad I got to try it. A true hop bomb, and at 13%abv, a strong one at that. Very nice indeed, will search it out again."
"D: Just one, I am not a big barley wine fan, even though this is supposed to be a dbl IPA, it doesn't seem like one."
"Into a tulip glass, pours a lovely kind of orangish copper amber, or something like that, with a decent off-white head that shrinks to a good swirly foam, a solid wall of cascading lacing. Aroma is.... barleywine-ish, to say the least. Alcohols like brandy and cognac, sweet caramels, vinious, bitter hops, could be a little more complex, in that it seems a little discombobulated that continues to the taste. The same stuff in the aroma transfers over to the taste, but combines a lot better, much better, very potent though, ridiculous bitterness, but heavily buttressed by a hefty malt backbone, somewhat Bastard-ish. The mouth is medium to full, a full smooth tongue coating, very nice, warming is nice but maybe a little too much. In all, its a big, big beer, and for once I'm glad to get a big beer is such a small bottle, though don't know if i'll go for this monster again."
"Drinkability: One is enough for me."
"Medium bodied with not too much carbonation. Drinkability suffers due to the high alcohol (which is noticeable) and the too unbalanced, all bitter hoppiness."
"12oz. bottle poured a dark amber color with a small tan head that leaves a few spots of lacing. A pleasing aroma of malt and hops that mask the 13% ABV. The taste is very balanced and full bodied with sweet malt and bitter hops and an alcohol dryness towards the end. For such a big beer this is dangerously easy to drink but I think the high alcohol would do me in before I'm ready to stop drinking such a exceptional beer."
"When I return to a state that sells it, I'll be sure to grab a fresh bottle, but it doesn't seem as though aging has harmed the experience in any way."
"D: Triple IPA? This is a barleywine if I've ever had one, but this beer won't get negative points because of that. This is a well crafted, heavy duty beer. Probably would age quite nicely. Highly recommended."
"Pours a thick dark amber/orange color, nice carbonation, quick fizzy head, some lacing afterwards. The nose is hoppy, sweet malts, citrus, and slight caramel. The taste is big on hops, malty, honey like, the finish is slightly dry. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a high octance IPA for sure, way to go Founders. Highly recommended."
"Tastes like a big MF hop bomb! Hop character indivduates to grassy, floral, citrus, and piney, and this all melds into a fennel/anise liquorice flavour. Mellow biscuits, with some toasted buttery toffee malt character backs all the hops up. Peppery spiciness, and a bit of alcohol to round it all off. Every sip of this beer is extreme and habit-forming. Heavy duty stuff to be sure! Mouthfeel is numbing to say the least, not overcarbonated, but all those hops just make your entire mouth buzz. Body is medium-heavy, with a massive malt presence needed to balance it out. Drinkability is like a fine spirit, one that you swirl around your glass all evening over a good book. Definitely an all-evening sipper. My first Founders and I'm looking forward to more in the future, because Lord this is a great beer."
"So i called up Wine Gallery in Brookline looking for the Breakfast Stout (which I have tried), but they unfortunately did not have it in stock. They did on the other hand have the Devil Dancer, which i've never seen anywhere, so I was compelled to make it over there to pick it up. Grabbed a four pack, which was a bit on the pricey side, but oh so worth it. It says """triple ipa""" on the bottle, whatever that means. Anyhow, it poured a nice light strawberry red color, but really no head at all, which was sort of a bummer, but the color made up for it. Aroma was full of floral hops...very much on the grapefruit and tangerine side. It was bursting with fruity smells and some sweet hop aromas as well. Taste was just as fruity, perhaps even more so. The hops show up towards the end, leaving behind a pleasant bitterness. Mouthfeel was oily and slick, just the way I like my heavy beers. Mouthfeel was the biggest surprise. When I first sipped I thought it would probably be around the 9-10 percent alcohol region, but when I saw the 13% I was floored. The alcohol is completely hidden with this beer. A bit misleading if you ask me, but wither way really tasty. This is an outstanding IPA, and one that I might go back for more of. If it is in your area, I highly suggest grabbing it. Cheers."
"Thick mouthfeel from all the malt but not easy to drink quickly. Nice to try but not an everyday beer."
"Worth trying although with all the other extremely hopped beers out there these days there are better ones."
"D: Far too good. I'd have another immediately if it weren't for my 12 step """beat the hops""" program. Truely satisfies all cravings for hops, IPA's and DIPA's, and extreme beer nuts all in one serving. This is the end all be all for those looking for hops. This beer is to hop heads what cocaine and heroin mixed is to Nikki Sixx from Motley Crue. Heaven. Hell. Call it what you will. This creation is beyond words."
"For such a brute, this brew is decently drinkable. However, as big as it is, I have a hard time accepting it as a DIPA. It's flavor and general characteristics really scream American Barleywine. I'd bet that one of these with 2-3 years of cellaring would be quite stellar.."
"Very drinkable huge beer. Not session fare, but could make for a memorable night of sipping. Not for those faint of hops. A rich and decadent treat that i will look forward to again!"
"First off this looks nothing like any ipa I've had before, but what do I know this is the first triple IPA I've ever had. Color is contains dark cherry colors ranging from a purple to maroon. Very limited biscuit color head on this one which is limited to the rim of the glass with carbonation bubbles crawling up the edges. As one sips the glass is coated in what remains as the beer falls from the lip similar to that of a cognac. Smells of cherry, orange and slight alcohol are apparent in the nose reminds me of Gordon DIPA. First thing I taste is grapefruit as well as pine like fruit esters. At 13% you would assume that the alcohol would be overbearing but it is well hidden with zero alcohol burn. This is a very good beer but one for special occasions or a night cap for that really bad day at work. I took a good hour sipping this one and was happy with each sip."
"Let's get one thing straigt: this is a great beer. What it is not, however, is any form of an IPA, double or """triple.""" It's gone way beyond any reasonable flavor threshold of any double IPA out there. That said, it shows amazing maturity early on for a barleywine. I'm sure it would do well with age, but it's flavors are very well rounded for a fresh beer of this gravity."
"Poured a nice dark cherry color with a beige colored head. Head didn't last long and there was virtually no lacing, but still a nice looking brew. There is just a trace of some caramel in the smell, but this is pretty much all hops. Seemed like there were more grapefruit citrus hops than piney resinous, but either way, they worked very well together. Taste is full of much of the same, but there seems to be more piney hops in the taste than the aroma, there's even a bit of caramel and dark fruit hidden beneath the hops. Mouthfeel is a bit thick, full bodied and medium carbonation; maybe that's not true to style, but it seemd to fit well. Very enjoyable beer, certainly worth trying, if you can find it."
"D - I don't know how other's feel about this, but I could drink this every day. (Note to self: Move to Michigan.) If I had ready access to this and it was cheap, I'm sure I'd drink myself to death within a month. (Note to self: Ignore last note for longevity's sake.) This is the sort of beer that is a terrible idea to session, but I know that I'd find myself doing it anyway. I will make I point to buy this again if I am ever in an area that distributes it. How does it go with food? Well, I had a burrito for dinner. I burrito that I botched and put in about 3x the cumin I should have. Devil Dancer was not only able to hold it's own against this burrito, but it tasted almost exactly the same. Amazing. Top notch performance Founders!"
"Drinkability: I'm glad that I got to dance with the Devil on such a cold day because believe me, this beer will warm you up. This beer is a once in a while treat. No way anybody could drink this on a daily or weekly basis. If love a beer that's hopped like a Devil, then pick this one up. By the way I got this via trade because it's not available in OH due to its ABV% cap."
"Mouthfeel was pleasant, oily and full to medium bodied."
"Pours very red with a surprisingly solid looking creamy head. The head faded and then the lacing came through rather nicely. Nice hoppy odor with some (but not as much as i'd thought) alcohol. It does smell like its going to be strong and heavy, but not because of the alc. ..more of a background malt heaviness. Taste is strong and bitter...lots of hops and alcohol and sweet malts. Bitterness on the front end and the finish. Very much like some of the really hopped up U.S. Barleywines i've had. Like Bigfoot in its first month. Very, very bitter. Sweetness is slightly cloying. It's tasty, but it could use some sitting down (glad i have 3 more). Heavy and thick mouthfeel...overall, like i said, it's really raw. Will be interesting to see how it changes with age."
"Pour and citrus pine aromas was OK  but this is not one that Ill go back for."
"A very nice beer here. Big and full flavored. The high ABV is noticable, but works well with the other flavors. The amount of malt can't balance the monstrous hops, but brings this big beer to a pleasantly drinkable level. Very nice."
"Overall, Devil Dancer is a challenging barley wine with a marvelous mix of flavors set against one of the strongest hop bases I've ever tasted. It's not always pleasant, but there is something intoxicating (no double entendre intended) about such a strong brew. While it's noteworthy for being so aggressive in all of its flavors, there are better, more balanced (and equally strong) examples of DIPAs and barley wines; nonetheless, it's absolutely worth checking out."
"Glad I tried this brew, but I can't say I was enamored. I would say to drink this beer as if it was a strong barleywine rather than a DIPA. Worth a try."
"Poured beer out of bottle into a pint glass, beer is a crimson-dark amber color with a slight creamy head. The smell is overwhelmingly of grapefruit and pine, interesting. The taste too is of grapefruit and pine, with a hoppy finish and alcoholic bite. The mouthfeel was enjoyable, full bodied with a creamy consistency and adequate carbonation. Overall, I have to say that this beer is not very drinkable due not only to the very high alcohol content, but also because of the overwhelming sweet and bitterness. I love IPAs, but this was not what I was expecting. Worth trying though."
"The drinkability is Top Shelf, this is an expertly put together beer. Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Drinkable? Not bad for its high ABV. Not bad at all, actually. However, a bit too sweet and definitely too bitter for my liking. If there had simply been some other flavor to hang on to and enjoy besides grapefruit & pine hops, it would be a different story."
"This one was a real treat. I will have to seek out more and recommend you do as well. Remember, fear not the hops"
"This triple IPA seems to be a lot closer to a barley wine ale, considering the glut of fruit characteristics and strong alcohol. I'll drink the 4-pack, but am not all that thrilled that I paid 17.99 (in Columbus) for it. Certaintly not bad--in fact bold and interesting, but not what I had anticipated."
"Basically a condensate of essence of IPA extract. You might even need to split a 12oz bottle. But man, I'm keeping this one all to myself."
"Excellent, but for the price I would rather have a Dogfish Head 90 Minute."
"I first tried this Triple IPA at the EBF in 05. Loved the sample I had, but havent been able to get my hands on this since then. Medium dark ruby rushes into the Duvel tulip. Ample, sticky, creamy mocha head. Looks inviting. Sweet, sugary malt on the nose with rum-soaked fruits, alcohol, and venomous hops. Slightly medicinal, but not too overly. Toasted, sharp bitterness up front. Moves quickly to sugary sweet and fruit concentrate. Not cloying, however, due to surges of massive hop oil bitterness. Candied bananas and liqueurs linger in an otherwise very bitter finish. Full, syrupy body, that somewhat dries out a bit in the finish. Warming and pretty drinkable for the power and hop fury. Another great Founders beer!"
"This is my first beer from Founders, and I'm quite impressed. Thanks to a friend who drove it down to me. I look forward to trying some of thier other beers. But this one is aptly named... when sitting in a cold apartment, and drinking this a cellar temp, it warms you from the inside. Almost like dancing with the devil. The ONLY thing that I don't like about this one, is the style listed on the bottle. Yes, it is extreme, but the """triple IPA""" bothers me a bit. Either way, it's a solid beer."
"Overwhelming. Hopped beyond my tastes. Alcoholic beyond my tastes. Thick beyond my tastes."
"Overall, more of a Mars Pale Ale than India Pale Ale, a beer hopped to last days on the palate or years on the shelf. Perfect beer for the hophead. My tongue is bleeding, I must go."
"Nice, thick mouthfeel with a lower level of carbonation. A tad sticky with a bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is good...'cuz after you have one, you'll want another, after another one, you won't care because the abv snuck up on you and you're as happy as a pig in a mud puddle. Woo hoo. Gimme another one!"
"Murky iced tea core with gilded apricot highlights. Short, but dense head of small and creamy faded caramel bubbles. Looks cushiony as it settles, leaving a fat band of thick lace and eventually vanishing leaving scattered dust. No carbonation streams are visible. Heavy aromas of orange rind, toasted malt, and some spicy alcohol heat as well as caramel tones. Thick body that is filled with estery alcohol and a musty, funked orange rind; a bit like when you buy a bag or oranges and inevitably come to find the one in the bottom that has some moldy skin. The alcohol is warm to hot all the way through and heats the tongue, the throat, and on down into the stomach. There is a spicy, resinous mixed orange rind and caramel flavor in the finish. Thick and syrupy body, no carbonation, yet not overly sticky with hops. As it warms, it gets even thicker and the alcohol becomes more pronounced. Definitely more of a barleywine now. The malt body is just thick and dense and overrides the hops by a long way. Touch to get down the entire bottle. Definitely big, but merely ok."
"Thanks, HopasaurusRex, for the experience"
"syrupy thick malts, then a blast of floral hops. medicinal and hoppy finish. intensely malty, hoppy and alcoholic, although slightly less boozy than expected given the ABV. not hugely drinkable, but i don't think it was intended for chugging. a decently balanced 13% beer, if there is such a thing."
"The beer pours burnt orange into my glass with a thin tan head that leaves a lot of foam floating around and lacing without ever really having much of a head. The smell is sweet from the huge amount of malts that they used plus all the citrus and piney hops you can fit into a glass. The taste is similar to the aroma. It is nice how they can balance all of those hops with so much malt. There is a bit of alcohol flavor that hits you. The mouthfeel is full bodied and smooth with carbonation. Overall, a good beer, one that will make most others seem rather tame."
"While trying this one, I blindly had a sip of 90 Minute and quite honestly guessed it was Yuengling... Wow... that really is saying something."
"This is one of the few beers that I always enjoy more from the bottle than on tap. While the alcohol is fairly evident here, the few times I have had it on tap the alcohol is stronger and overwhelms the flavors. I don't typically like to age hoppy beers but due to the size I did set a couple of last years aside and look forward to breaking one out now that it's out fresh again. A great dipa from the bottle."
"Last swigs: Thanks to Hoppy Meal for the bottle acquired via trade. Maybe its the triple IPA moniker but this does remind me a lot of Weyerbacher 3IPA. If you dig big beers like me, put on Charlie Daniels Band Devil Went Down to Georgia, and put on your dancin shoes. Big and strong. This makes 120 minute look like 120 seconds. Take it from this hop head: Wow! Now gimmie gimmie gimmie more!"
"Poured a reddish amber color with a small, off white head that left light lacing on the glass. Aroma of pine, citrus fruits, resin, caramel / toffee, and light alcohol. Taste of much of the same, with some woodiness, and light alcohol in the finish. Alcohol wasn't as pronounced as other """triple IPAs"""."
"I think this is my third DD and was surprised I had not reviewed it. Looked and smelled great and despite the style name this is a barley wine and a damn good one at that. F&*K the malts- this is a hop lover's barley wine. If you like the style you will like this beer. Amber, rich, boozy and an alcohol burn to make you respect this beer. Long bitter hop aftertaste with a surprising drinkability."
"D- I started as a hop head, then began to appreciate malts. This one has both in abundance, with the hops dominant. Very good, but very expensive."
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks BeerBeing!"
"This isn't a bad beer, it just seems like another one of those beers trying to hard to be extreme without much in the way of balance or complexity."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass, appearance is an amber hued caramel color with a rough pour only making the slightest whitish head that left a thin sticky lacing. Aroma is sweet and very hoppy, primarily citrus and floral aromas dominate the aromatics, smells fresh and slightly of fruit. Taste is no suprise, larger than life complex hops and malted just as heavily supports this beer very nicely. Great balancing between the two, sweet caramel malts are undeniable. There is a defining heat about this beer between the big abv and the extreme hopping this brew has undergone, hits on all cylinders and forces you to take notice. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and viscous, low carbonation, finish is comprised of hop oils and caramel with a slight dryness from the heat of the alcohol. Drinkability is surpising, although this beer may be considered rough by some, I find it smooth given it's characteristics and I appreciate how well this IPA can hold it's alcohol. Will purchase again."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sweet, bitterly mixed with some evident abv."
"Pours a deep copper, light mahogany color. Thin white head holds for a few minutes then gives up. I think the hops killed it! Strong hop aroma is an understatement. Citrusy, piney and floral hop aromas practically leap out of the glass and fill the air. There is a great malt backbone, which is filled with very sweet caramel flavors, and some ripe fruits. The malt flavors give way to the hop attack very quickly. Loads of piney, citrusy and hop flavors attack the tastebuds. Raw hop flavors. Raw hop flavors. Low carbonation gives this a good mouthfeel. For being 13% ABV, this is dangerously drinkable. Take heed! A solid beer, seems to border on an American Barleywine, but who really cares what """style""" this fits into. If you are into big beers, this is a must try. Big cheers to BAs macallister and pixel for sharing!"
"Intense flavor of caramel malt and hop tang blow you away at first, and it soon settles down into a dry smoked finish that's mildly bitter and considerably alcoholic. Light body, smooth, with subtle carbonation, definitely not flat tasting which contrasts the general appearance. Almost highly drinkable, but one of these could get you buzzing. The overload of flavor is a shock at first but is definitely interesting as you go along..."
"Definitely a complex brew that will mangle your tastebuds and leave them wanting more, although more than one of these badboys would venture into the land of chore, not treat."
"All in all, I was dissapointed with this offering. As a DIPA freak, I have sought after it for weeks, with great expectations. Ultimately on sampling however, I found very little merit for its' """Triple IPA""" moniker. It really seemed to be a thin, sugary. barleywine with a high ABV. It drilled its' way through my Panang Curry to the bottom of my stomach in a hurry. I'll cellar a couple of bottles for later sampling, (next summer) but for now, not a favorite."
"Pours a light orange color with a white head. Smells hoppy and sweet with many undertones and characters at work. The taste is similar, it was hard after a couple founders to pinpoint flavors, but this one held its own. Very sweet for an IPA but still held some bitter notes. A good mouthfeel, not overpowering but packed a good deal of flavor. This is a very enjoyable beer, but after a couple I would have to call it quits."
"Being from Grand Rapids, I've always loved Founder's. I've always seen devil dancer on the shelves and had a curiosity, but was afraid of the """Triple IPA 13% abv""" on the label. I've recently developed a taste for IPAs, and I love big beers. After trying the carmudgeon, I figured I could handle this. Beer is served well below room temp, before you get angry I want to note its 95 here right now. I'm using a tulip glass. Not too much carbonation with the pour, and only a thin line of lacing around the rim of the glass. Has a deep crimson color, not what I expected when I pored it, then again this is my first 3IPA. Smell is dry, hoppy, and malty all at once. It kind of reminds me of a belgian ale. This is a very strong tasting beer, but I feel it is well balanced. The flavor starts out with a sweet malty kick, moves to that crisp hoppy taste that all of founder's brews are trademarked by (if you've had enough founder's you may know what I'm talking about) and finishes off with a smooth dry taste. This beer is not all that refreshing, but it is very tasty. I think it would be better as a winter release. For how flavorful it is, it is suprisingly smooth and drinkable. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, very similar mouthfeel the Red's Rye (a favorite of mine). Drinkablity is kind of on the low side, I don't think I could drink anything that weighs in at 13 abv for the whole night. I could see myself buying this again though. If you want to be adventurous, I say go ahead. If you want something refreshing, go with the centennial of the PA. Overall I think it is a good brew, I don't know the style so I can't compare it to other 3IPAs, but I can definitely say that it is a quality brew."
"Slàinte!"
"I dowbt this beer would make a good session beer. It is high in alcohol, and the flavor is not too good. I doubt I will drink it again. Thanks MABZ for giving me the opportunity to try this beer. Sorry I didnt like it too much."
"great suggestion for bigfoot junkies, of which i am not one."
"D: Drinkable? Hell yeah, but I would only have one of them. Huge abv would become a factor after more than one. This is a monster of a beer in a short fat bottle, but a damn fine one."
"D: Very well balanced... drinkability is actually exceptional for its strength!"
"Thanks to shbobdb for hooking me up with this monster!"
"."
"Outstanding beer overall. I drink this whenever I can find it, but usually only do 1 or 2. Not a session beer, given the huge ABV (you'd be blitzed) and the big hops and dry finish. But not every beer is a session beer. Some beers are simply spectacular. Like Devil Dancer."
"For 13% alcohol it's hidden very well. This is a very complex brew. Big hops with an enormous amount of citrusy pine forest, with huge amounts of sweet malt. Covers the palate very consistently making this beer extremely balanced. Only problem is a slight drying hoppiness on the finish may make this beer a 1 or 2 and move one. Yet very good and worth a try."
"Da: High. Dangerously Drinkable!"
"The taste is similar, like thick, well-ripened fruit, full with flavor that gave me the chills a few times. Again, the alcohol reared its head and the bitterness of the hops stuck around afterward. It felt very smooth, not quite creamy, but quite thicker than water. With the powerful taste (like I was drinking wine), this beer isn't chuggable - one bottle will be plenty for me."
"It was great to finally get to try this beer I was anticipating it for awhile.Poured a deep burgundy with a thinner slight off white head,big fruity esters in the nose like alcohol dipped dark fruit with an undelying but very noticable piney hop elemant.Aroma wise and flavor wise this is an hopped up American barley wine,flavors are of dark fruit and brown sugar up front finishing very piney.The alcohol to me was pretty well hidden and very decieving,in some ways reminded me of Great Divide Old Ruffian in its hop profile.A great brew Iam hoping that it will be on tap at Founders next month when in GR."
"Drinkability low just because of the 13%, but could drink 2 or 3 in one night and this is also a great beer to start St. Patty's day with."
"This is an excellent sipping beer, but no more than one for me."
"This isnt what I expected it to be. . .but it is DAMN good! Deifnately a sipper. . .this is the kind of beer Id like to start the night with, but I think I would want to move to something a little less demanding thereafter. Very, very good though."
"Damn, this beer is a monster. Loads upon loads of flavors and aromas. Just huge. The perfect session beer in my opinion. Definately something I could drink everyday. Dark red color with a fairly healthy head, which retains well considering its potency. Unbelievable aroma of malt (caramel, honey laden fruits and toffee), along with an incredible diversity of aromatic hops. Enormous, coating malt flavor which provides an underlying maltiness of caramel, fruit and toffee along with one of the most substancial hop contributions Ive ever tasted. Its so malty that the brewery could easily describe this as an American Barley Wine and no one would complain that it wasnt stylistic. Just an amazing beer. Probably the best """Double IPA""" Ive ever had."
"Big and chewy, nearly oily, the only improvement this beer could use is a bit more dryness. Other than that a fine beverage. Close enough to 120 min. for government work with 1/3 the pricetag."
"Poured from a brown bottle into my Delerium Tremens tulip glass. Dark rust body with a light carmel colored head. Almost no lace at all. Lots of piney, resiny PNW hops. An equal amount of alcohol and sweet malt too. The body is fairly balanced between the malts and hops. Lots of caramel malts flavors. Very alcohol warming. The bitterness goes to the end. The mouthfeel is full. Good drinkability for a 13% beer."
"Drinkability- Double IPA..no, Triple IPA...still no. A very hopped up and tasty Barleywine...yes. Any way you look at it, it's a very warming and drinkable beer. Just seems like it's in the wrong category. If it is in the right catagory...Pliny the Younger puts this one to shame."
"The mouthfeel is full of dextrins. Very sweet, sticky, and full. Long lasting finish. Drinkability is off the charts for as high an ABV as it has, but it is not something I would want to drink often."
"Notes: This is part of my IPA Series tonight. Starting with an IPA, then a DIPA, and finishing with a TIPA. Strong, flavorful, and unique. I have 200+ IBUs in my mouth and I like it."
"Have wanted to try this beer since its release. Have been somewhat deterred by price and high a.b.v. It turns out to be a worthy effort by Founders on the whole. Devil Dancer pours an interesting medium brown color with light red tints. There is a small tannish head, and good lacing. Smell is of strong hops, dark fruit and plenty of citrus. Orange and grapefruit dominate the back part of the aroma. Very well balanced on the nose. The taste is of deep malt and powerfully bitter hops. There is some plum and raisin (or other dark fruits) there, but citrus is the dominant fruit taste. Also the strong presence of alcohol must be mentioned. Mouthfeel is full and bitter. There is very little carbonation to this beer. On the whole this is a nice brew. It is extremely potent and not for the faint of heart. Hop-heads will love it, but it offers more than pure bitter bliss. Smooth and comparatively pleasant to drink, albeit in a sipping fashion."
"Brought a bottle back from Madison courtesy of dirtylou, cellared for about two months."
"Drinkability : A+++ This is an outstanding find by some nameless gent at my local beer store. I will add this to my weekly IPA rotation for sure.[the Alchol is a sleeper and will creep up on ya...so be forwarned.]"
"Update bottle released 6/2/11 not as bad as I remember it being way back when but damn it's still an intense experience. Appears a deep ruby red with pale tan cream head forming pretty thick for the alcohol level and beer itself. Aroma is almost syrupy sweet with hops and an abundance of malts, smell is full of grapefruit/citrus hop juice with a mild barleywine esque experience with each smell. Flavor wise super sweet malt base with a burning alcohol sensation on the palate, really pretty much kills with hop bitterness think hop liquor. Is it good, not really it's abrasive but do I enjoy how extreme this experience is, somewhat it's almost a sadistic form of abuse to really sit and drink this 12 ounce bottle. That's my recommended volume to drink and I don't feel this will age like the best barleywines out there however I'm willing to experiment. Very harsh mouthfeel alcohol is upfront with a cloying residual sugar sweetness and the most oily hop experience I've ever had, that's where this beer really loses track of what any or extreme beer drinkers want. A beer tha is crazy big but still easy to drink, this beer is burdensome in it's truest since it's like a beer willing to push the envelope on what beer is. My local store sold out in 3 days I picked up the last four pack because I'm crazy into beer, it was around 22 bucks for a four pack, why? B/C demand drives prices and evidently if you make limited quantities of something like this you can yield very high prices even if it isn't the best product out there."
"Pours a dark copper with a fine white head leaves a crinkly white lace as I consume the beer. The beer smells of thick hops, piney, green & resinous. Also, there sneaks in some caramel malt notes. The beer is smooth across the tongue with lots of malt viscosity. Then the hops kick in, grassy and fresh hay like green meadows, then moving to darker, woodsy pine hops that stick to your gums and teeth. The hops stick around well after the beer is down the gullet leaving a resinous and dry tart feeling in th emouth. This beer is big, and packs a wallop. A bottle full of tasty beer, can't see me putting away more that 1 of these in an evening though."
"This beer poured a nice amber color with minimal head and slow climbing carbonation bubbles. The smell is both hoppy and alcoholic and very strong. Something tells me this is going to kick my ass! The smell only hints at the powerful flavor and kick that this beer has. Very alcoholic flavor with citrusy and piney hops throughout and quite good. The hops are reaking havoc in my mouth. All in all this is a very good beer although drinkability could be better. It's tough to get through the entire bottle. I'm going to need a nap to get through the rest of the day."
"This is certainly not a beer for the faint of heart. Pours a cloudy amber burnt brown with little carbonation and minimal head. Smells of pine trees and loads of alcohol. Taste is literally bitter sweet with loads and loads of bittering hops that linger on the palate for quite a while. Lots of warming alcohol there. Somehow I detect a woody fruity pear like taste hidden in there. Not a bad beer to slowly enjoy in a snifter glass. I am certain that it will improve with age as well. Reminds me a lot of some American style barleywines. Thanks to fitzIPAtrick for this one."
"Drinkability is extremely good for the strength of this beer. Nothing at all here hints at the alcohol level or the hop load and it DOES sneak up on you ...with little cat feet. Hops are strong enough to numb your tongue and senses but you just do not notice it happening. Alcohol level is only detectable in the warmth in the chest. One of the top three double and triple IPAs in the world. I think Three Floyd's Dreadnaught is a little better than this but I would never turn down the offer of one of these."
"There's a lot going on with this one and flavors abound. I feel like Founder's went overboard with the syrupy-sweetness, but they probably had to in order to balance out the aggressive hops. It was worth a try, but there are many double IPAs that I would reach for first."
"best enjoyed on a cold night by a fire."
"Overall, a very nice IPA3. There are better DIPAs that are better balanced though."
"A beer that makes an outrageous claim and backs it up? a Triple IPA? Yeah, I'll buy it in this case. Because as far as over-the-top beers go, this one holds it's own with the best of them. A must try for the extreme beer lover."
"Body is definately big, thick, and sticky, with a creamy smooth texture and chewy mouthfeel. A definate sipper due to it's awesome strength and complex hop brutality."
"Heard a lot about this beer and was excited to try it, but I have to say the expectations outwieghed the actual thing. The alcohol was just to much to overcome. The alcohol was overpowering the hops, and quite simply dominated the beer. It's a beer I would recommend to try, but just get a single bottle if you can because you might find if you buy a 6-pack the other 5 will be sitting in your fridge for some time."
"A true sipper if ever was."
"12 ounce bottle. Pours out a hazy amber color, with no head at first until the slowly rising bubbles eventually decide to float to the top. Hoppy aroma with bursts of alcohol and a little bit of stink. Thick, pungent hoppy flavor. So sweet, and yet so bitter. I see why some BAs have called this a barley wine. A little bit of dark fruit, but the flavor is really dominated by the hops. Thick mouthfeel. Not particularly drinkable. Better than Sam Adams Imperial Pilsner, which this beer sort of reminds me of. Still, I'll take a Red's Rye over this any day."
"Drinkability: Not bad, I don't think I could drink more than two in one sitting. Especially having a 13%abv. It leaves just a little too much of a bitter taste in my mouth. But I'll try it again after a few months of cellaring."
"This sample is fairly fresh (maybe 3-4 months old) and really packs a lip-pursing tongue-smacking hop profile. Bitter and boozy, this beer is possibly the closest brew I've drank to eating fresh hops. It's very, very raw and could probably use some time in the cellar to let the flavors settle and meld together, but it's certainly enjoyable fresh, if you like your hops oily and bitter and can handle the booze. Methinks I can, and therefore am capable of dancing with the devil. Even if I do think it's a barleywine."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is very full bodied. The hops and the alcohol can be difficult at times drink. However the beer taste good enough and provides enough drinking pleasure to go back for more. This beer is a sipping and savoiring beer."
"I really don't know what to say about this. It's drinkable, but I have no idea what I'm supposed to get out of it. It's sweet...thick...alcoholic...and certainly a decent winter warmer. The booziest amber ale you'll ever have."
"Absolutely gigantic. Very few brews can top this one in sheer beery musclepower. Think of it as a muscle car, perhaps a 1970 Chevy Chevelle SS454. Delicious, but it just kicks the hell out of your tastebuds. I don't think I can taste another beer after this. Drink with very pungent indian or thai dishes, perhaps sushi slathered in wasabi. More my idea of a giant, hoppy barleywine, rather than a triple IPA. It's a fine line, I guess, or maybe simply a matter of packaging. So american it almost hurts. I don't know if bigger is better as far as beer goes, but for what it is, it's one of my favorites."
"Enters the mouth long and thick with dinse sweetness and ruby hoppy feel. Creates a bitter thick mouthfeel that is quite an epic rich bitter but even and nice. Something twords the end of the palate is not quite developed. This beer needs a little time to become perfect."
"A fairly big taster and holds its own with most big West Coast goodies. Not a sessioning beer. A hoppy nectar sipper if anything."
"Taste is hoppy, yet balanced. Pine. Some bubblegum. It never overpowers, but the hops are in the forefront. Somewhat sweet and spicy and even malty. Slight alcohol burn makes my tummy warm. What an exceptional brew. Highly complex. Seriously very, very good."
"I've had aged and fresh versions of various vintages, and I've always preferred the fresher versions. A really big beer that I find myself returning to every time I get a chance to. Thank you Founders, for creating this bad ass hop bomb of a beer."
"D- A triple IPA as the label proclaims is right. This has a nice roasted caramel malt flavor that balances the hops and alcohol nicely. It is somewhere between an American barley wine and a big IPA. Nice twist on a new classic."
"I think """Triple IPA""" is a bit much... but very easily a double. And I am not going to get drawn into the Double IPA/Barleywine debate."
"Notes: It's unbelievable that this beer is 13% abv. This beer is tasty and flavorful, but should it be labeled a Triple IPA? While it is hoppier than a regular IPA, I think it's slightly too big for it's britches. A definate try,"
"I'm glad to see this stuff finally available in MA. Found at Julio's Liquors in Westboro during the Fall Classic last month (great event BTW). Keep them coming, boys!"
"All in all, a fine brew, but nothing mindblowing. I actually think it is more of a barley-wine."
"Founders once again surprised me with a awesome beer with a very complex flavor. Keep up the great work Founders!!!"
"Tried this beer both at the Michigan Beer Fest (2005) and at home when i purchased a four pack (12.99). Pours nicely into a snifter, a rich autumnal red with a slight tannish head. Aroma is strong, woody, fruity, and of alcohol. This is a very spicy ale. Lots of great hop aroma and bite. Almost like red hots candy. Quite a thick beer, heavy on the palate. Hop spiciness dominates the flavor, but it is also quite fruity as an ale should be. Great testament to American brewing (and Michigan in particular)."
"[Thanks to TikkiGodxxx for sending so many Midwest brews to the Left Coast]"
"The taste is thick and rich with concentrated notes of hops and malt, and that same muddy note that is found in the aroma. Up front this has nice concentrated notes of pure hop nectar (lots of citrus with notes of pine, herbs and a bit of menthol), it does seem to die off in the finish though. This has quite a thick, syrup-like palate to it; it sticks to your mouth even after you have swallowed it, and for some reason it is not all that pleasant. The malt also plays a heavy hand in this beer, it is not just all hops; there is a concentrated unfermented beer taste to it (very similar to malt extract), with lots of notes of caramel, & toasted malt. I am gonna have to say that this was pushed a bit too far, it is a bit too over the top. The flavors just clash on my palate."
"the body is full with comparatively strong carbonation or maybe thats the alcohol thats tingling (no seriously i think it is, this might actually not be that carbonated). oily and resinous like a beer like this ought to be. i'll be licking sticky hops of my mouth for a while after this beer is done. drinkability suffers some from the sheer assualt that this beer is on the palate as well as the high, not always well hidden alcohol. overall quite an incredible beer, probably more of a barleywine than an DIPA, but where can the line be clearly drawn? a must try."
"Overall this is a decent brew, considering the cost, not sure when I'll try it again."
" To give you an idea how much I like this beer, lemme tell ya a story. I lived with an alcoholic for a while. Now, he's a good kid, just drinks a little too much. Well, when I came home one day to find my sweet, delicious Devil Dancer gone, well, I was pretty damn angry. I yelled, I screamed, I made a fuss. Well, maybe I overreacted. . . but no other beer has caused me to overreact that way. What a beer, what a beer!"
"overall: this is a HUGE ipa! very balancing for an extremely bitter beer. you've got great hop character, balancing malt flavors, big alcohol and a super thick body. all things i like in a beer. however, this is a 1 or 2 and done. excellent try and definitely a good brew if you love big beers. thanks a ton, mark! (mlh1227)."
"Thank you - I'll have another!"
"If I've ever drank anything that made me feel like a vampire, this is it. One hell of a beer and a definite must-try. I'd almost think this is more comparable to Jagermeister than it is to Budweiser. Props to Founders for knocking me on my ass."
"thanks to Travis for hooking me up with this, too bad i only have one."
"Drinkability & Notes  After awhile the bitterness basically overwhelmed my taste buds causing the beer to have less and less flavor as time went on. This seems like the beer version of those Warhead sour candies from my youth, its like a contest to see who can handle the most bitterness without spitting the beer out. This is my least favorite Founders to date but I am glad to see this because it means that their big beers are making it to Massachusetts, hopefully it means that the Imperial and Breakfast stouts are somewhere around the corner. My taste buds are going to grow back, right?"
"Pours a dark dark amber, much darker than I've ever seen in an IPA with a smallish khaki head that the alcohol soon devoured. Smell hits you across the nose like a shovel, intense piney, floral hops, concentrated peach and apricot and sweet, sweet caramel. Taste is equally as potent, pine needle extract, gobs of dripping apricot, buckets of caramel malts, and a hearty """light your ass on fire""" warming alcohol rush. Mouthfeel is slick and sticky at the same time, coating your mouth with concentrated, ungodly amounts of flavor so intense it should be illegal. I took this dance with the devil, and I must say, I'm spent. This is certainly a one and done sipper, but that's all you need. I'm literally exhausted in mouth, mind, and body after conquering this beast. Definitely worth a try, but clear your schedule and make a night of it."
"Great beer for what it is- a huge sipping brew that overwhelms your tastebuds with flavor. Interesting and worth checking out."
"This beer does make me wonder about the diminishing returns of wickedly enormous hop-demons...like DFH's 120 minute IPA there is just so much syrupy sweetness and alcohol here it seems like the hop-flavor is drowned out. But still...wicked and worth a try."
" This mouthfeel reminds me of that time I gargled with motor oil, except this tastes better. This tastes great in fact, and the mouthfeel is to be expected with any great IIPA. It is thick, chewy, and coating. The first time I had this I drank three bottles. That should settle the issue of drinkability."
"Thick, slick, almost oily mouthfeel. LIke carbonated sweet vegetabe oil. Like a spectacular Barleywine I had once, that neasrly required chewing. It took me 1 hour to drink the first one of these. The second one took less time, but was in a different day. I could never drink two of these in a row without falling asleep, but I'd love to try. This is tasty. It makes me wonder how Founders could do with a Barleywine."
"way to go founders, you continue to impress with your over the top creations...long live michigan breweries"
"I most definately recommend this monster of a beer."
"Overall a beer that lives up to its instant classic reputation. Huge in every aspect and characteristic. It's unbelievable how one could blend so much hops and such a concentrated amount of malt and wind-up with an ale so beautifully balanced. Yeah it's very sweet. Yeah, it's very hoppy. And yeah it's from one of the countries most progressive and skilled breweries!"
"Notes: Over the top? Hell yeah. But very balanced and refined. It's gotta be hard to make this beer, but the gang at Founder's bring it off. Just awesome."
"Pours a cloudy bright reddish brown color with a small light brown head that leaves a sticky lacing in my glass. Pine and citrus aroma, sticky pine, grapefruit and pineapple flavors. Full bodied with a thick sticky, syrupy mothfeel. Has a noticeable alcohol burn, finishes with a lingering bitterness."
"Caramel, & dark fruits. A hint of nectarine. And yes, all of the intense hoppy goodness that you would expect after giving it a good whiff. Bitter & somewhat pungent. Alcohol is well masked. Syrupy, gentle carbonation. Hop delivery vehicle."
""""I was expecting something BEASTLY, but it's actually pretty good.""""
"Drinkability: Suffers some due to the high ABV. No alcohol is noted on the palate but b/c of the huge malt and hop bill, this is one to sip. A little too sweet for me and almost cloying. The hops definitely serve to help tone it down. This is definitely a challenge to the palate. Very cool in theory but I think the application is a little shaky. Careful with this one."
"I'll probably purchase another 4-pack to sit on because its a limited offering. For the price and the alcohol content I'll probably only want to bust one out for a special occasion."
"Admittedly, this beer is over the top, but that is why they call it a Triple IPA, right? It poured a dark mahogany color topped by a thin tan colored head. The head receded after a while an left a light lace on the side of the glass. Aroma: This is a citrus hop bomb. Tons and tons of grapefruit rind but balanced by a definitive malty sweetness that takes the form of dates. The taste has a mild sweetness up front, and then waves of hop bitterness. Mostly citrus hop although there is a bit of pine. The sweetness from the malt does sustain throughout the entire profile. Slick, mild mouth feel, but this baby is bitter, so the drinakbility is medium at best. Still a very interesting beer."
"Looks real nice, a dark and hazy red, small tan head forms and settles out to the edge of the glass, leaving copious lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet and chocolaty malt, with a huge citrus/floral pine aroma, as well as a lot of carame and some pineapple in the nose. Taste is sweet and malty up front, caramel, with massive citrus and pine hops carrying it the rest of the way, and a little bit of alcohol in the finish. Very bitter, but not overpowering. Very full bodied, low carbonation, a nice sipping beer."
"Rich orange/red, definitely on the dark side, with a bit of haze. Tan/auburn head, quite dense until it settles into a fine lace. Good retention at this point with some lacing. Hops dominate the aroma, which doesn't surprise me at all. Mostly pine and resin with orange citrus in the background. Caramel malt provides a balance to all the hops and alcohol aromas. Thick and malty to start, bitterness creeps in and grows through the finish, becoming quite strong yet short of aggressive. Orange citrus flavour and intense caramel sweetness hits part way through and transitions into a bit of pine as well as alcohol taste and warmth. A bit vinous, mainly due to alcohol flavour. Strong pine resin lingers in the finish, and this is the only point where the hops in this beer become just a little bit harsh. It has a full body with plenty of residual sweetness, but the attenuation was sufficient to keep it from feeling sticky. Moderate to low carbonation that's well integrated as fine bubbles, and a viscous, creamy texture. This is definitely a sipping beer, but still easily drinkable for the amount of malt, hops, and alcohol present. It also seems to get better as it warms. Seems like more of a barleywine, but who cares about labels with an experiment like this. I'll be saving one of these to see how it ages."
"The mouth borders on oily, but that comes with the territory of the style. How could a 13% hop bomb be considered truely drinkable? This is a sipper for sure. The other three will be laid down for a night in front of the fireplace during a snowstorm. A maelstrom outside, dancing flames in front of me, Devil Dancer in my hand."
"Overall, I'm not a hop head, but I can still completely appreciate what this beer is doing. It swings big, and succeeds in presenting a new taste experience. Very well done...also ages well, the hops seem to hold up without any trouble."
"No head, clear deep orange. Very fuelic alcohol nose. Huge malt and hops, no surprise there. While it doesnt try to be balanced, I dont think it tries to be a total joke. Im sure it takes good skill to make such a beer without it being cloying and abrasive and I know Founders definitely do have great skill, but Id hoped theyd use it to greater purposes than joining a childish weener measurement contest through IBUs and alcohol. Cheap scotch reminiscent alcohol nature, very hot citric hops, earthy, caramelic and apricot like. Hot and abrasive palate, like a Chinook hop shot. Highly astringent, but who cares, its flavourful eh? Woody, minty. Ni drinkability which I expect to have a minimum of in a pale ale. Medium-thick bodied, syrupy. Purposeless heavyweight lost child. No worse than that, a 700 lbs man who cant get up from his bed. Thanks Mike for sharing though, yes Im happy to have tried it, but I sure wouldnt have been able to go through a whole bottle."
"Mouthfeel is dense and creamy...simply coats the palate and does not let up. Nice carbonation as well. Divine enjoyment. Obviously...this is not a brew to drink in mass quantities, however it goes down smooth and is incredibly tasty. My only complaint would be that this should really be labeled as a barleywine instead of a """triple ipa"""...but hey...I guess that is not my call now is it! Thanks to kmpitz2 for the opportunity to try another tasty Founders treat."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4""" tan head over the dark orangey amber brew. Head stands pat, and lacing is very nice, with slow drain down the sides after swirling. This brew has some viscosity! Aroma is citrusy, piney hops, coupled with a vanilla-ish, almost oaky alcohol presence. Flavor literally seems to run around the mouth, hitting all the tastebuds quickly with their potent hops pedigree. Still, the malt character does keep the bitterness somewhat in check, allowing hops flavor to stand somewhat on its own. Alcohol is more felt through warming than tasted. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent for the style, which often can be overpowering. This one walks the line, but I think stays in the enjoyable realm. Scary drinkable for the style. What are you waiting for, check it out, hopheads..."
"The above review is from notes. About a half hour after I finished this beer I got a phone call from my Dad. My grandpa was dying fast and I needed to rush to the hospital. He died ten minutes after I arrived. In the span of an hour I was sipping the one of the best beers I had ever had and mourning over the death of my beloved grandfather. Ill never forget either."
"Dark evil fiery orangey amber with not much of a small head of off-white that just kind of crackles and fizzes out and away without leaving much billowing foam or lacing, if any at all. Aroma is hops. Resins, oils, whole cones hops, pine needles, the malt struggles to be recognized but it is there. Biscuity and caramel laden trying to stop the assault somewhat. Taste is hoppy as all hell as well. Grassy, herbal, raw, leafy, acidic, dry, citrusy, oily, etc. The malts do become apparant though in the somewhere caramel sweet, doughy middle. However that does not last long and the hops come back in a big away for the incredibly hoppy, and tongue scrapingly bitter/dry finish that lasts and leaves you with an incredibly scarred palate and amazingly poten hop burps. Mouthfeel is syrupy thick, and lend another degree of complexity to this already quite complex """chewy, chewin' on a hop brew"""! Drinkability is touch to mark. I've had this 3 times or so in smaller 6oz or so samples. Whilst i'd never pass up a chance to drink a bit of this nectar, I don't think i'd want to do a whole 12oz bottle for myself. I'll score it at a 4 since i'd like to drink this one often, but in small doses. If this came in a magnum it would be deadly!"
"Very nice deep,orange color. Almost a coppery orange. Big, big hop aroma with a nice balance of some sweetness. A trace of alcohol heat comes thru as well. Huge hop flavor-not only is it extremely floral but a huge bitterness behind it all. Big caramel flavor and a somewhat alcohol finish. Not hot but its definately there. Very good body-fairly well balanced considering the high abv. Dangerously drinkable. More like a barleywine then a Double IPA to me. Really pushes the envelope as far as the alcohol goes but does a good job of it for sure. Get some for now and later."
"Devil Dancer is big beer for big beer lovers. Everything about it is over the top, from the malt to the hops to the 13% ABV. Founders should be renamed the Midas Brewing Company since everything they touch lately turns to gold. I'm more than ready to Dance with the Devil until I drop. This is a Hell of a beer."
"This is one full-throttle beer that's almost overwhelming. It's intense, but not particularly complex. And it's definitely a palate buster! But it still remains quite enjoyable. It may, in fact, be a bit too much as it's drinkability is limited. You may think you want another one while you're driniking it, but I doubt you'll crack that second bad-boy open. WILD. UNRESTRAINED. WORTH TRYING!"
"Drinkability improves tremendously as the beer warms (or the palate adjusts) but it is just way too big for more than one or two."
"Dark with no head but a light lace on top of beer. Strong, hoppy smell. Spicy with an effervescent bite. Very powerful alcohol taste complemented with a dry citrus and slight malty aftertaste. Very drinkable but I recommend drinking this in the comfort of your on home."
"A deep rich taste, like a top quality UK conditioned old ale, a very good American barleywine, hoppy beginning and great bitter finish, woith buzz from the high alcohol. Barleywine aroma. Only sold in fours at $18, last case and hard to find, at Chuck's near Cleveland."
"poured with a think skimpy light cream colored head witha slightly hazy red copper body. soft bready aroma full of sugary malt and fruit. bitter at first taste followed by a thick sweet mouthfeel dense body and a lingering dry bitterness. just sweeet and bitter this is...good!!! bit of alcohol comes through as well."
"This brew is a hop lover's dream!"
"Taste: Obviously, this thing's got torque like a redneck's souped-up chevy. Enough alpha-acids to melt right through your gullet. Those who suffer from ulcers, acid reflux disease or any other digestive tract ailment should only use this to strip the varnish off their furniture. All jokes aside, this is pretty one-dimensional, but it isn't supposed to be anything else. Rinse this one off with Cantillon and/or steel wool."
"So if it looks like a duck, if it walks like a duck, wellI just wish theyd call it a barleywine instead of a triple IPA  whatever that is. Also, whats with that label? An ecstatic naked woman held aloft and groped from below while a sword shatters a sword beneath her? Hard to believe the ATF signed off on that."
"Comments  Thanks to the much-respected and highly-regarded BuckeyeNation for tossing this little hop bomb into my trading box. Good triple IPAs are hard to find, but this one certainly lived up to my expectations of this unofficial style."
"After being freed from its incarceration inside this 12oz bottle, it fills my glass a wonderful deep crimson / dark copper color with a light almost khaki head. The dark color of this brew is quite enticing. Great head retention, and some good patchy lacing on the glass. Nice powerful aroma of hops - clean, floral, pungent, and spicy all at the same time. Also some caramel and a fair dose of alcohol in the nose. After a taste, the name Devil Dancer sure seems appropriate. Hops hit you like a .44 magnum. Hop oils are so potent they are spicy and almost salty. A little citrous and some noticeable pine have also showed up to beat up on your taste buds. Very sweet malts and some caramel keep the hops in check, however. In fact, the malts are a little too bold for the IPA style. Warming alcohol permeates the taste, reminding you how potent this devil of a brew really is. Finish is oily hop bitterness with a good amount of malt sweetness, and the 13% abv flexing its muscles. By far the biggest mouthfeel of any IPA I've ever had - no wonder Founders calls it a triple IPA! This outstanding mouthfeel must be experienced to be believed - it seriously beats some imperial stouts that I have had."
"Drinkability: IIIPA or frigginly hoppy Barleywine? This is an Incredible Hulk of a beer, and Banner is angry. If you're not a hophead, you won't like him when he's angry. If you are, you're gonna get roughed up a bit. Wow."
"Can't rate drinkability high on this one, but I could put back a few w/ pleasure. Another solid brew from Founders."
"Well, after all that, I need a rest before going at this again. The hoppified monster nearly obliterated my ability to talk, let alone taste. Humdinger."
"This is an experience you won't need fries with."
"Thanks to MoeSizlak for sharing one of these."
"The mouthfeel is that of a warm syrup. More thickness than bubbles here. Resiny, oily, creamy, smoothe, slickness. Wow. I am really becoming a fan of the texture of these heavy hitting abominations. This is the kind of beer that can make it difficult to enjoy a light bodied beer once you have immersed your senses in its wonder. Hopped caramel cream and some warmth tickle the taster. Nice bitters. Just enough sweetness to maintain some semblance of sanity with this rich, strong character. This one progresses into an even tastier glass as it warms. Beauty and power defined. Damn delicious. The alcohol is well tamed by the other flavors, but remains readily apparent with the telltale warmth and instant uprising of pleasurable sensations of wellbeing. Splendid. Mad props to my man the BogMonster for dropping this one off to me. Dancing with the Devil is most enjoyable."
"My first brew from Founders and I'm not disapointed! Fine, large, tasty, super hoppy,mega malt creation. 12 ouncer sampled. Pours rich dark almond with a creamy dark tan head. Nose is fresh hops. Crunching loads of oily hop notes, balanced by a flood of sweet malt layers. Warming alcohol, stinging the tongue. This is super stuff, plain and simple. Go get yourself some..."
"Thanks for the Devil Dancer cokes. Next time, how 'bout a Lap Dancer??"
"An awesome trade from CRJMellor brought this 12 oz. bottle to Georgia from Michigan. The choice of label art was interesting, to say the least, and so was the style moniker of Triple IPA. The beer poured barley wine like deep red amber, with a thick syrupy, dense body that was topped by an average sized beige head that left a good curtain of lace. The smell was citric hoppy reminding me of grapefruit rinds, and had roasty sweet malts lurking just behind the blanket. The beer was leaning definitely on the hoppy side with a zesty peppery taste of burning hop oils. The caramel and pale malts were not quite subdued with the boisterous hoppyness and provided a nicely sweet backbone. The mouthfeel was slick and was followed by a soft buttery-sweet aftertaste. Dangerously drinkable beer that will be sorely missed for being absent from these parts."
"Founders complex, innovative, most revered ale produced. complexity malt character attempts to balance the insane amount of alphas used to create this monster. 200+ IBUs, dry-hopped for 26 days using combination of 10 hop varieties. Do you dare dance with the Devil."
" I think I'll age some a year and see how it goes."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: Mouthfeel was medium, but punctuated by an oily feeling warmed with alcohol. I would definitely label it as drinkable as a sipping beer. There is a sticky and sweet aspect that survives the hop assault. Drinking it every day or as a session beer could possibly permanently ruin my taste buds. Double IPA? Triple IPA? Barley wine? Who cares? It was enjoyable nonetheless."
"Almost too drinkable. I don't think I could have another right now. but I'd like another tomorrow."
"Addenum: This beer does not cellar well. I put some away and tried them at 9 & 12 months. The hop flavor and aroma all but disappeared and hence reminded me of a big Old Ale."
"Pours out to a muddied brownish-copper in the glass with a slight head. The aroma is that of pine and citrus. The taste? Let's just say the hops hit you like a punch in the face from a heavyweight boxer. They are there in such force, that it takes you a second to get your bearings. However, the swallow is remarkably smooth and easy considering the hop barrage and high ABV. I honestly don't think a beer could be hoppier than this. As much as I enjoyed this one tastewise, it does take a bit to get used to it. One in a session. Any more than that and the 13% ABV and the hop assault will be having you looking at the floor and your tongue on crutches..."
"Pours a nice deep amber in the glass. Smells of hops. Lots of hops. Can't really pick one out, it's not just Centennial or just one hop. You can tell that there is a ton going on in this beer. Taste gets muddled. There's a touch of Malts here, but then there's the confusion of the hops. There's a hint of grapefruit/ citruis from Cascade/Centennial here, but there's also the earthiness from Fuggles, I'm guessing, and some floral hits as well. The problem I have is that it's not well put together. It's just a bunch of hops thrown together. Mouthfeel is thick and lush. I had a problem drinking my one pint of this, I doubt I'd look for it again."
"Pours a hazy ruby color with a small fizzy head. Small amount of lacing present on the chalice. Smells of fruit and citrusy hops. Apricots, lemons and caramel are all present on the nose. Tastes of grapefruit and other various fruits. The malt backbone is huge and sweet on this one. Heavy on the butterscotch and caramel. The alcohol presence makes itself known at the end. The mouthfeel is thick and sticky, very full bodied. The drinkability on this one is limited to sipping. But this is a classic. More of a barley wine than an IPA. But hell, this is great, glad I got the chance to grab a four pack this year. Will pick up again if the opportunity arises."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep burgundy color with three fingers of head on a heavy pour that stick around for quite some time. There's a damn good amount of lacing for a 13% brew. The smell is very sweet and very hoppy. It smells like a grapefruit hard candy (vitamin-C drop anyone?), but a little bit better. It's a fairly pronounced smell. The taste is superb, with lots of maltiness up front that is fairly sweet. Don't look for it to stay long though, as the hops come rushing over the tongue, covering it in alpha acid goodness. The bitterness is not overpowering at all, and there is NO trace of alcohol at all. The mouthfeel is very thick and heavy, yet smooth. The drinkabiliy couldn't get any better for a 13% brew. Take some notes Avery, this is a high alcohol, highly hopped beer that you can actually drink. Hooray!"
"It's a good extreme beer, but an unnatural clash of forces. Quite an ambitious exercise in extraction; maybe just lacking aesthetic coherence (or perhaps my mind is simply unable to comprehend it.)"
"200+ IBUs is an overstatement, but it by all means a wonderful beer. Even at 13%, it's very consumable. I would love to snuggle up with this beer all night long."
"Is it just me or does the number preceding """IPA""" seem to be loosely following the number of blades on Gillette razors? I anxiously wait to find out if we will see a quadruple IPA before a 4-bladed razor. As for the beer, it is a simmering reddish orange color with a thin and compact light beige head. Very little lacing. The aroma is peppery, with hops, citrus and a babys breath of malt. Very rich-bodied. I like to drink even the hoppiest IPA normally but this is definitely a sipper. Citrusy hops and alcohol dominate but do not overpower. Surprising amount of sweet malt to balance, which lends to the Barley Wine characteristic this beer has. The finish is long and hot. Thoroughly enjoyable."
" Drinkability is wonderfull no way this goes down this fast at the level of alcohol that is present man this is dangerous and very good also. Was hoping for insanity but got something much better here, this is near perfection for a very drinkable high octane barley wine, might be labled a triple ipa but I think we all know the truth now. Just rush out and buy one for yourself or if like me trade for one its worth it, just wish I had a few more but would hate myself in the morning but it is so good. Many thanks go to CRJMellor for this unexpected treat can't wait to try the other Founder's brew he sent."
"This beer has a lot of hype to live up to. For the most part it meets expectations. It is a powerful brew in flavor and alcohol. It was just a little too hot to be a supremely drinkable beer. I would love to cellar a few of these to mellow them out just a touch. I recommend this for those of you who like your beers big and bold."
"I love Three Floyd's Dreadaught and Nodding Head's 3C IPA, two well-regarded examples of this nascent style. To put this beer in the category of what Vinnie Cilurzo and other West Coast brewers began would be a grave mistake. Of course there is a range of creation within every """style""" of beer, but this beer falls way far from the pale. No matter how much hop material you put in a boiling wort, there is an upper limit of oils and acids that can be dissolved. Furthermore, with a gravity so high to create 13% alcohol, and then to leave judicious residual sweetness in the final product, the supposed 200 IBU's are lost or better yet out battled by the equal amounts of Caramel malts. So maybe its not a barleywine, just an Caramel Hop Ale."
"Having said the above, I've nothing left to do, but let this thick, rich, slick, toasty,oily, malty brew slosh about my mouth and rinse my tongue over and over...the 13% ABV hasn't punished me yet, but we'll know in the morning, maybe...for the moment, as I finish it, it's a hit, a hell of a brew, the kind of thing I wish I had more of, for special occasions, and the inevitable times when the irristible urge for devil dancing arises."
"Drinkablity and Impression: Very nicely executed ale that I would classify as a hugely hopped barleywine. This has a solid caramel malt backbone to support the multifacited hops bitterness. This is actually very drinkable, except for the high abv. I'm just getting acquainted with the line of Founders brews, but I'm very impressed with their offerings so far. Founders is the """Dogfish Head of the Midwest", the way they want to push the boundaries of what we're accustomed to. Devil Dancer is a tasty and very drinkable brew, no matter how you label it. Cheers to Founders!!!"
"This review is from a 12oz bottle sampled on 12-18-04. Pours out a bright reddish amber with about half an inch of light tan head that slowly forms. This leaves some rings of lace around the glass and has fairly decent retention for a 13% monster brew. Aroma starts out with a bit of sweet malt before the huge hops take over. Citric and earthy hops galore leave notes of grapefruit, pine, grass and other yummy hops smells. As it warms some alcohol sneaks into the aroma reminding me of a heavily hopped barley wine. A good amount of caramel malt sweetness starts off the flavor before giving way to a strong citric hop presence. Notes of alcohol are small but there and add greatly to the taste. This really seems like a super hoppy barley wine to me, like a double IPA crossed with an American Barley wine. It finished up on a hoppy and slightly warming note. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with a warming feel to it. This is remarkably drinkable to me for the strength, but considering this seems to meld 2 of my favorite style its not a big surprise. The 13% is hidden quite well and only shows up to add to the experience. Awesome all around beer if you like big beers, Founders did another great job here. Many thanks to Tikkigodxxx for the chance to try this beauty."
"I'm liking Founder's more and more each time I try their brews. This one poured a bright brown/red color with a small head that doesn't have good retention but leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is ... yeah, hops. Citrus, grapefruit, pine, grassy. All hops. Surprisingly, this one has a great caramelt malt in the flavor. The hops take main stage here. Grapefruit, pine, etc comprise most of the flavor. Strangely drinkable for the high hops and the high alcohol level. Thick mouthfeel. Great brew here."
"I am a bit disappointed with this one. It looks good, a beautiful golden amber. It smells powerfully of hops, which I like, but man, does it fall apart when you drink it. It is good, but so hopped up that it is actually kind of hard to drink, it is literally so bitter it is searing, and you can feel a burning in your throat as it goes down. A very big beer, warming, but with a bit too much alchohol tang. The hops oil it up, it feels almost slimy as you drink it, you feel it in your throat and on your lips. It is good, but certainly not a session beer, even if you can afford the heavy duty price tag. I am a hop head, and was excited to get a chance to try it, but this one needs some time alone in a dark closet, to see if a little time with meld it into an upper echelon double (or triple?) IPA."
"We found this one this week on our treck to Cincinnati. It pours a brillian red color with a small head overtop that falls to coat the beer. The nose is very rich in grapefruity hop and deep sweet caramel, and an apparent alcohol, but at 13%, it is expected. I can't wait to taste it. The flavor is sublime. Lots of brilliant citrus hop, but with a rich caramel malty backbone that supports the hop very well. For such a strong set of flavors, it is really very nice. The fell is very thick, and rather warming after swallowing it. For 13%, this beer is highly drinkabile. Everything is balanced in the flavor, and the alcohol does not get in the way of any part of it. This is a very nice contrast to the breakfast stout. I think Founders has found their niche in the beer market. I'm very happy we can get their stock down this way. Its worth the trip to Cinciy to get it."
"Hard poured to create a whitish 2-finger head when poured from a chilled 12 oz screw-top bottle (December, 2004). No sediment in the bottle, a not-so-clear ruby orange/red color. Smells strongly of woody and then citrusy hops with a faint caramel & malt sweet. Also a winterfresh, which may be the alcohol (13%) mixing with some spicey hop. Thick mouthfeel. ALCOHOL, then hop bitter, and a mild caramel sweet. Some citrus, but not as strong as I was expecting. Some hop woody and some malt/yeast biscuity. The alcohol predominates throughout. This needs some kind of fix. To hot alcohol, not enough malt. Don't believe the hype."
"Consolation prize: It's got some body to it. And the hops really do beat the shit out of the 13% alcohol. Other than in the finish, it was barely there for what is now 50 straight minutes of consumption. But really, served even a little cold, the hops blow it away."
"This beer bills itself as a triple IPA with a heavy duty IBU level and 13% alcohol. It poured a a clear medium reddish amber color and formed a hubge off white foam head that behaved like a float, coating the glass with lace as it slowly subsided. An aroma of hops, caramel and some pine. The flavor was of hops, caramel and some other candy elements. The body is fairly smooth and the finish sweet with a touch of astrigency. The alcohol is hidden well. Style wise it reminds me of types like Moylan's Double IPA and such that tend to be sweeter than say the arid Ruination."
"Drinkability is very high for such a big ABV and IBU brew. Little alcohol is present on the tongue. Pleasant combination of tastes and flavors are sharp yet not enough to overpower in any direction. Have to get this recipe, great beer."
"I have to review this one now while the taste still lingers in my mouth. This beer poured a very dark brownish color with purple highlights and a frothy tan head. The aroma was difficult to detect because of the coldness of the beer and smokiness of the place but I did get some pine and floral hoppiness on the smell. The taste wasn't the overly bitter, out of whack hoppiness I was half expecting considering the name. This beer simply amazed me! First it was very creamy which is odd for a 10% beer. Second it was quite thick and syruppy. Lastly it was extremely smooth and easy to drink (way too easy to drink). The balance was remarkable. Lots of sweet, syruppy maple and caramel at first but then the hoppiness kicks in. More flavor from the hops than bitterness but it was still bitter. This wasn't the most complex beer I have had but that might have been because of the coldness of the beer and the fact I drank it too fast to let it warm. This was liquid candy for any hop head or malt head or anybody who appreciates good beer. The best DIPA I have had to date!"
