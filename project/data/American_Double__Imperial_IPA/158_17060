3.71,-10,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"Pours a medium copper amber with medium white head. Smell is very unusual in that it has a grape aroma mixed in a hop forward nose. Reminds me more of a barleywine nose. Sweeter scent mixed in the nose that I can't put my finger on, almost a licorice candy, with slight sweet bread note. Taste has a distinct malt presence that reminds me of malted milk ball. Unusual for a DIPA to be so malt heavy with little hop bitterness to the palate. It's difficult to sort out the different flavors as a result. This is one I need to come back to when it comes out fresh.","RyBrew54","Monday at 02:29 PM"

Nice nose of blended hops (pine, citrus and a bit of dank) over a caramel background with a hint of alcohol.   Medium bodied with a slick texture. Below average carbonation with no effervescence on the finish.  The taste profile is complex, but a bit out of balance.  The alcohol is quite prevalent.  It begins with a caramel rush that flows into the hop flavor, but never totally recedes. The middle is a mild dank bitterness. The finish lingers with alcohol and a slight phenolic note.","tillmac62","Sep 19, 2014"

It was not as carbonated a I expected but it was balanced very well to give a nice mouthfeel.  Hoppy taste lingers on the tongue for a satisfying aftertaste.

4.02,-2.4,,,,,,"Poured from a 1 pt 9.4 fl oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Pours a hazy orange with brown highlights.  Smells barleywine-esque.  You get citrus/grapefruit, but also malty bread like qualities, and a tinge of alcohol heat.  The taste is rather subtle, focusing on light citrus, bread, and dark fruits.  Mouthfeel is dense.  Carbonation is about average.  Things get a tad sticky later on.  Overall, a good dipa for those who like them to trend towards the barleywine side.","Apellonious","Aug 17, 2014"

I think Great Divide meant to put barleywine on the label instead. As highly rated as this is and at $15.99 a four pack, this is one of the most overrated beers I've had in any given style. Sure, it's a decent barleywine, but as a IIPA, it's baffling. I'll rate this somewhere in the middle. I don't even see this meeting its reputation fresh. I should've grabbed Founders Double Trouble afterall.","Bone53","Jul 10, 2014"

I do smell your usual citrus flavors in there as well but they're very faint. Wow! Sweet, candy like flavors. The citrus flavors are in the background (orange, maybe a burnt orange). Maybe some date flavor, and I want to say even coffee flavor. This is interesting. Really awesome! Slightly syrupy, sticky in the mouth. What I would expect a IPA to be. Unlike the last few beers I've reviewed (save for the one disaster) this is NOT a beer I would drink to quench my thirst. This is a beer drinker's beer. This is an event. Very nicely done.","aaroblero","May 17, 2014"

The first sip was a little strong, but immediately after it mellowed out. The second sip to the end were very smooth and not strong at all. It ended up being a great tasting beer. When it was poured it didn't have a lot of head, but I don't think that is totally a bad thing. Definitely a beer to look for if you are in the mood for a Double IPA","mediumtommy","Apr 29, 2014"

Good one finger foamy head, dissipates somewhat quickly, leaving lots of tiny bubbles and ample lacing all the way down. Cloudiness and floaties yield an unfiltered appearance. Smell is strong piney nose with hints or orange and grapefruit. On the palate, the hops dominate (85 IPUs, for crying out loud), but there is enough malt on the backside to provide some balance, which helps offset the heavy alcohol (10% ABV). Big chewy mouthfeel. Hard to imagine drinking more than 1-3 of these and living to tell about it, but maybe that is how it got its name.","JohnParadee","Dec 28, 2013"

As I mentioned before, it's not awful. It's drinkable, to a certain degree. But overall, it's disappointing if you're expecting a Double IPA (which you should be, because that's how it's labeled). Too sweet and malty, this could pass for a hoppy American Barleywine (Bigfoot, anyone?) and it might received a bump in ratings.","tectactoe","Aug 20, 2013"

3.99,-3.2,4,3.75,4.25,3.5,4,"Pours clear deep golden color with a hint of amber. Large off white head fills the rest of the glass and does not disappear. Smell is very strongly hopped, earth, pine, and slight citrus. There is also a nice background of caramel malt sweetness to it. Taste is malty up front, lots of caramel and nut notes to the flavor that fade to a long lasting bitterness. Finishes with a strong alcohol flavor as well. The mouthfeel is very thick and viscous. This obviously high residual sugar content, and this balances nicely with the hop bitterness. The beer is medium carbonation, very full bodied. Overall this is a very well done double IPA on Great Divide's part. I was turned on to this one because the Titan is one of my all time favorites in terms of IPAs. This one does not disappoint. I definitely recommend giving this one a try if you come across it.","scvance","Aug 18, 2013"

Astringent  aftertaste.  Warm, boozing feeling going down.  Very strong and assertive.  Good beer for sipping but too much to drink more than one.","jngrizzaffi","Aug 17, 2013"

Smells of sweet malts, and I do detect a bit of nuttiness like the bottle suggested; smells almost like a rye beer. Hops present in the smell are some grassy, and some of subdued sweet citrus. Taste is astoundingly different than any other DIPA I've had. Starts off with some sweet and a bit crackery malts, but then it's a hop show entirely. Big sweet citrus fruits meld into that odd rye-like flavor which I can't quite identify, and finishes bitter. Mouthfeel is big and smooth, alcohol is well-hidden. It's rare to see a unique beer in one of the most popular styles these days, and this one is outstanding.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Jun 18, 2013"

4.16,1,4.5,4,4.25,3.75,4.25,"O: Hercules takes the typical American Imperial IPA formula of layering a shit-ton of hops over sugary caramel syrup (i.e., the remnant of caramel malts) and puts it in its place. It’s hard to believe that a grainy, rich DIPA was hiding right in front of me for so long; in fact, I might grab a couple of those older bottles to see how this monster ages. A unique palate thick with roasts sends Hercules to the top of my recently-sampled DIPAs list.","BarryMFBurton","May 15, 2013"

The hops are in your face but the nose is balanced well with a very malty sweetness, perhaps caramel and brown sugar. The caramel is balanced perfectly with the bitter, astringent hops. I'm also sensing some fresh baked bread and yeast. Tastes a bit oaky at first with a strong boozy bite. The hops fade a bit in the transfer from the nose and the sweetness takes over on the palate. Yeast hasa strong presence in the finish. Very, very complex but I like it. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, but also has a thick, malty backbone. Absolutely exceptional. Great Divide, please make at least one bad beer. Y'all are too good of brewers. Hercules is top 2 best DIPA's I've ever had.","Jacurdy60","Apr 06, 2013"

Aroma is mostly pine and citrus hop notes but there’s a big caramel malt tone backing things up. Maybe, touches of bubblegum and sugar cane. Starts sweet and finishes with bitter hops and candy caramel. Good lingering hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit sticky. Booze is hidden quite well. This is pretty close to ASA territory, definitely not a West Coast-style DIPA. Good stuff.","popery","Jan 27, 2013"

For a DIPA it's incredibly balanced with a sweet bready malt backbone, that tastes of caramel and vanilla, and ends with a grapefruit bitterness and a suprisingly light alcohol twang, for a 10% abv beer. This is what i look for in this style, uniqueness, and a glorioud malt backbone. I've only experienced this flavor profile 2 other times with Stones Enjoy by IPA and Drake's Aroma Coma.

Thick caramel and bread crust with a more than balancing sweetness. Almost more Barleywine than DIPA. Still a really nice beer.

Hop profile kicks off in a burst of pine with each sip, introduces other, well-layered notes of citrus, perfume, and floral, but comes back to the pine in the end. Manages to showcase the intense hops while still maintaining its own version of balance. It's 10.0% ABV is incredibly well-masked, so proceed at your own risk, and the advertised 85 IBUs seem accurate, and possibly even a bit modest.","Cold","May 08, 2012"

Pours a deep golden in my wine glass with a one inch beige head. Realitively clear with some sediment. Bold smell; malt and heavy pine presence. Powerful hop presence and some malt but the alcohol does shine through. Mouthfeel is medium hop oil presence gives it a syrupy feel. Overall a great DIPA and will try again. Not sessionable.

Head eventually settles into a thin, consistent skim - delicate webs of lacing are revealed during the course of the review. Nose expresses grapefruit, toasted malts and a slight bitter rind presence. Flavor profile is consistent with the nose - citrus is a bit more masked and rind is a bit more assertive; however, there's also a slight spicy character. Malt is not as assertive as I am accustomed to with the style. Mouthfeel is medium-light (but closer to medium) with an oily consistency and a slightly prickly carbonation. Overall, a pretty solid DIPA with a well-hidden abv. My preference leans more towards the fruity side of the spectrum, but this beer has a nice balance and some interesting qualities.

Fresh hops, molasses, honey, lemongrass and wheat on the initial sip. Lots of bready, malty flavors with a big hit of fresh hops. Boozy oak follows. A moderately carbed brew with a floral, earthy, strong, full overall body. Aftertaste is composed of citrus, honey and a mild fruity sweetness.

In fairness, Great Divide describes this beer as """hoppier and maltier""" than a typical IPA. I think """malting up""" an IPA makes little sense. It's almost as if the malts and hops are competing for the palate and it becomes chaotic, a sensory overload of sorts. It's a serious beer, I would drink it again, and I would rate it as a good beer in general. But I expect something a bit different in a true IPA.

This beer can certainly knock you on your ass and will if you're not careful.

Aromas of big caramel, orange, grapefruit, and some alcohol in the background. Decent aromas here, with decent strength. Taste of huge amounts of grapefruit, orange, caramel, and pine. Big sweetness on the front with a decent amount of bitterness on the finish that lingers with caramel, citrus, and pine flavors for a good amount of time. Much more malt forward as I expected. Medium carbonation and full bodied, with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden, only a decent warming present on the finish. Fairly easy drinkability for the alcohol level, but still quite a sipper.

Well, flavor is what counts. Lots of malt, but not enough hops for an IPA in my view. The Great Divide Hercules Double IPA definitely has a rich mouth feel, and is very smooth to drink.

Intense flavor: hop leaves, citrus, booze, nutty malt, cereal, hop resin, and finishes wet with juicy citrus and resin. Medium-heavy bodied brew with light carbonation and a slick mouthfeel. A strong beer that is definitely juicing. It throws massive hop flavor and couples it with booze and then attempts to balance it with hefty nutty malt but all that might be too much.

Taste is resiny hops that show bitterness in the finish and and predominant malt character. Earthy undertones linger on the pallate. Mouthfeel is well rounded and full bodied. Overall this is an easy drinking Imperial IPA. I have to wonder if this is due to the hops fading already, but there is a large caramel malt taste that I didnt expect.

The beer is round, and fills your mouth right off the bat! Malty sweet flavors slip onto the tongue first, laying down a nice foundation for the aromatic and piney hops that follow. The spices continue to be present, and highlight the aftertaste as well. There are also some sweet grapefruit and grassy tastes towards the end of the tongue. Aftertaste is all hops, with the slight peppery spices mentioned before. Surprisingly, the finish is lingering and sweet, and the slightest bit bitter. My mouth actually watered the longer I tried to focus on the aftertaste and finish, so I guess that ranks high on the drinkability scale!","GarthDanielson","Feb 10, 2011"

In its defense, it probably pairs with savory food better than some other more noteworthy examples of the style. Within its style Hercules treads near to the barleywine border, cultivating dark flavors over bright--it will not be mistaken for a West coast IPA.

The caramel malt was definitely there to help out on the balance and add a touch of sweetness. The brew was medium to full in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a piney,grassy hop, citric, and mild bitter finish.

A friend says this smells like college, and part of that meaning the slight marijuana scent; I don't get as much of that as she does, but it's present. It's a very pretty specimen, a light frothy head lessening into scant foam lingering in the middle of the top of the beer and around the sides. The maltiness is very pronounced, but it balances out the hops well. I don't know what to say that hasn't been said!","fragilemacabre","Sep 29, 2010"

Faint traces of falling lace, not that sticky. Smells include your standard tropic fruits with some grapefruit, mango and papaya. Taste include a layer of hop resin oil with liquid grapefruit a enormous amount of malt, without the over sweetness sometimes accompanied by it. It seems well balanced but the tropics don't hit me as hard as the malt backing, it's a double I so take that for what it is worth. Feel is a big medium and oily, slick with a small sting of alcohol at the end that fits quite nice for this 10% beast. I would not drink this all day but would go for it on tap again.

Viscous body; there is a delicious dry hop flavor that is perfectly balanced by sweet and sticky flavors of oranges and other citrus. Moderately carbonated and very drinkable with a long finish.

Head dies down eventually and leaves incredibly thick lacing and a huge cloud on the beer. Amazing red color as light shines through makes for a very awesome looking beer. Smell and taste are basically the same. The alcohol comes through in the nose but not the flavor for me. Both are very malty for a IIPA (barleywine like malty). The hops are citrus and earthy and lend more bitterness than they do flavor and aroma. There is a tea-like aspect to them also. Some sweets and grassy aspects in the beer also. Great beer, just not exactly like a IIPA to me. Mouthfeel is a bit light for a huge beer and thats the only flaw in it. The carbonation is great and a huge bitter coat is left on the tongue. A bit of creaminess in the feel also. The drinkability is good. The flavor rocks, the price is decent. It is definately a sipper but not overly aggressive.

Pours a dark orange with amber hues, a frothy ring of cream coloured head, and webbed lacing all over the snifter. Smell and taste are citrus, pine, caramel, vanilla wafers, burnt sugar, white grapefruit, alcohol, and a strong, resinous hop bitterness. Malt profile imparts taffy and molasses with an unpleasant astringency. Seems a little off. Full-bodied mouthfeel is syrupy and creamy upfront, bitter and sticky-dry in the finish. The bold malt presence is overdone and somewhat buttery, not what I want from a DIPA. The IBUs are evident here but there's not much complexity from the hops, and this is much boozier than others in the style. I get the feeling that my bottle did not travel well from Colorado to Florida and up to Canada. A drinkable but disappointing beer.","cratez","Mar 09, 2010"

I bought a 4 pack for $16.13 (which seems quite a bit expensive) at a local store and poured on of the 12oz bottles in a pint glass. The dark amber brew left a soft creamy white head that slowly dissipated lacing every bit of the glass that it touched. Sticky hops overwhelm the smell. Behind the powerful hops is a citrus and bready scent. Once again, hops overwhelm the taste, however that is not a complaint. I notice some pine notes as well as a bit of alcohol in taste. Caramel malts are also very noticeable. The mouthfeel is creamy, sticky, and pretty think... I think a bit more so than other double IPAs I've had. I do really enjoy this beer, however when this costs over $16 and Harpoon Leviathan costs $10 so I am definitely going to go with the Leviathan next time.

I always thought that Great Divide has some great beers and this one just proves my theory (which I'm sure not too many people would try to negate). Poured this one into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. It pours a nice golden/amber/orange color to it with a pale caramel colored head to it with much better than average lacing to it. It has a slight haze to it when held up to the light. The smell is pretty classic of a double IPA, lots of hops. This is a very tastey beer, a very strong hoppy taste, but not too strong, it's very good. Has more of a citrus hop to it, grapefruity. Nice mouthfeel to this brew, I mentioned the citrus hop, but there is some pine hop as well which leaves a slight dryness to the mouthfeel but the taste compensates quite nicely and all is well with this beer. I can't believe how drinkable this beer is. I thought the ABV was 8ish and thought it was drinkable for that, then when I saw it was 9, I was even more amazed!

A pink grapefruit sweetness struck me first followed by hints of malt and alcohol. Very inviting. Taste followed the nose beginning with a big citrusy sweet pink grapefruit/orange flavor which then gives way to more bitter citrus notes in the finish. Bitterness was a nice shock to the tongue and did not linger. In addition to the citrus bitter-sweetness of this beer was a nice caramel malt flavor providing a bit of balance, although clearing slanted towards citrus. Alcohol was well masked.

2.98,-27.7,4.5,4,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours light copper with a thick head that gradually provides very attractive lacing down the side of the glass. On the nose, this beer puts its sweet side forward: some butterscotch, honey, and a bit of breadiness with citrus and floral notes playing a supporting role. Mouthfeel is too thick, bordering on full-bodied, with only some mild carbonation preventing this from being a beershake. The taste leads with a one-note caramel sweetness that lingers until the beer falls apart at the finish. The finish is too alcoholic for my tastes which provides an acidity that unpleasantly combines with the intensely bitter hop coda. I love a DIPA bomb as much as the next guy, but this is bad combo that's so strong it stays on the palate until you're halfway through your next beer. I'm going to revisit this beer in case I got a bad bottle, but my first impression is that this beer is a bit unbalanced and the finish is a plain 'ol mess.","chicagobeerriot","Jul 29, 2009"

Like the initial hop kick seems muted, and as a result, a little bit more accessible on the tongue. Like you have more time to realize those sweet caramel malts before your tongue is numb from a bashing of hops.

Interesting nose of rubber, sneaker sweat, salami and pine resin, not offensive, just weird, then more normalizing orange rind, corn syrup, more fig and date fruit than anything darker, light floral musk appears before it's all gone. Full-bodied, very broad and filling without becoming unduly dense. The malts bring a touch of caramel and milk chocolate but really just smooth out any burrs in the hops. On that note, the hops lean more towards sweet grains and oats, pine and lemon oil, like you just cleaned the house, The carbonation is by no stretch weak yet cannot disturb the weight presented here. Apricot, white grape, peach and pear fruit come through as it moves forward. Only fault might be it tries too hard to please.","farrago","Jan 26, 2009"

There is also a touch of alcohol in the aroma. Taste is very reminiscent of the aroma with a good american hop presence. The malt flavor seems a bit more restrained than the aroma. The malt character that is there is caramel but very much in the background. Mouthfeel is pretty good with a medium body and moderate+ carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good as well.

The beer is bitter, but balanced. A nice, slightly creamy malt taste balances this ale perfectly. The mouthfeel completes the balance of the ale. The hops, malt, and carbonation are almost perfect. I drink a fair bit of great divide and I would offer one word of caution; I have had a few bottles of this and the barleywine that were subdued and off balance.

White bread colored head bellows up from the glass leaving a nice pillowy head that drapes the walls of the glass in lace. Smell is strong. I can smell it from the table... Fresh ruby red grapefruits explode followed by sweet buscuity malt and some floral rose aromas. Taste great. Begins up front with some big sweet, syruppy, brown sugar maltiness. A bit deeper you feel your tongue cringe as an assault of grapefruit bitterness destroys your taste buds. This one is strange, where I normally can detect some strong aroma hops, this one seems to be an all business bitterness DIPA. Finishing off, the bitterness grabs the back of the throat while the alcohol evaporating against the tonsils sends a surreal nerve jarring experience to the brain. The mouthfeel is crisp and dry. Even a minute after a sip you can feel and taste fresh grapefruit in your mouth.

Very light caramel malt hints. This is a hoppy beer, no question, not in the sweeter DIPA vein of 120 Min. Taste is likewise powerfully hoppy. First off is a strong bitter, sour hoppiness. Middle there's a smooth cookie flavor, but the malt is very mild on this. Very light caramel. Ends with strong, drying hops as well. Wow. Body is nice and thick, with fairly mild, smooth carbonation. Overall, this is a big hoppy bruiser of an DIPA, just like the Hopslam, although not quite as fruity as that beer, which makes it a little less drinkable in my mind.

Pours a brownish-orange with a two-finger off- white head. Retention is fleeting with not much lacing left behind. Smells of potent, citrusy hops. Tastes like the big hop-bomb you were expecting, with a bit of astringency and chalkiness layered toward the end. A zesty orange squirt mingles in well just before the nice little alcohol kick.

The first sip is very hoppy, but as it warms slightly you can better detect the blend of sweet and bitter, malt and hops, although even as a double IPA the hops don't overpower so the balance is well done. The citrus continues in the taste as well. There is a noticeable amount of carbonation, but nothing out of the ordinary, it leaves a very clean finish.

The aroma was a perfect blend of the malt and hops. The taste of the beer puts this over the top. You get a slow build up of bitterness that lingers well after the beer is gone. It comes off like a strong Belgian, but the bitterness definitley makes this Double IPA one of the great IPAs. The mouthfeel is smooth with the carbonation very mild. You can tell it is carbonated, but you do not get that sharp acidity like in some beers. The alcohol content can knock you on your butt, so you can't drink this beer all afetrnoon.

4.52,9.7,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"A great DIPA. Tastes like Celebration Ale on steroids. Highly recommended for hop-heads. Pours a hazy orange with an average size head. The head fades down to a covering of the glass. Leaves a nice amount of lacing. Excellent aroma. You know you have a great hoppy experience waiting for you on first sniff. Really great taste. Hops bitterness and citrus (grapefruit predominant). As I sipped the beer (drank all marvelous 22 oz myself) I noticed some maltiness in the finish. Wouldn't call this balanced in any shape or form, but I can detect the malt as the beer warms up. Mouthfeel is rich and luxurious. Coats the tongue and palate with resiny goodness. I wouldn't want to rate another beer after this one. Drinkability is good for a 9.1 abv beer. 22 oz is enough, but I enjoyed the last oz as much as the first.

Smells strongly of pine and resins, with that unmistakeable double IPA bitter/sweetness. Taste is so assertive that it goes beyond the bitter over to a subltle sweetness. Intense hop/alcohol heat finish. Very dense, syrupy, chewy mouthfeel is unlike most of this style. Highly drinkable, but be warned - the 9.1 ABV can not be taken lightly.

On the palate, brash metal-and-acidic-citrus attack first off, then some huge, somewhat cloying sweet malt notes come out. It's a familiar problem with DIPAs -- that barleywine-esque, sticky-sweet malt character that really ought to be aged out a bit.

Wow, this is a balanced DIPA - huge citric hops up front that segue into caramel malt richness and ends with a dry grapefruit-like finish - excellent stuff.

Smell: plenty of grapefruit, orange zest, bready yeast aromas and tons of resiny pine hops. Little alcohol in the nose. Taste: Tons of bittering hops met with plenty of sweet malty flavors. Also nice citrus and pine flavors with a little alcohol heat. Somewhat bready. Mouthfeel is full, complex and somewhat carbonated on the tongue.

4.28,3.9,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Reddish orange in appearance. I could smell it before I poured it. Somewhat thin off-white head that didn't want to stick around too long. I had just read about hop flecks in a random review earlier and to my surprise, here they are staring at me with all their ferocity. The smell is a little more toned down once it's been poured and won a staring competition. Hops abound and then more hops with some citrus. It must be an 85 IBU kind of stink. Piney hops and again some citrus come through when I take the first sip. This is followed by a nutty malt flavor but again the hops overcome, as it should be. This isn't just your average DIPA. Excellent carbonation levels and a medium to thick body but this is extremely smooth and silky. A little in your face at times (especially when you get to what I guess were hop flecks) but that's expected with this style. Not overly hopped or overly hyped by any means in my opinion. A well crafted brew from Great Divide. I guess I'll have to try the Titan, seems I took a step up without trying what I'm sure is a fine IPA.","ncvbc","Mar 28, 2007"

Body is a deep golden-orange color with a ton of suspended solids, topped by a creamy bright white head that leaves some decent lacing on the glass. Aroma of lightly sweet malt, strongly assertive hops (bitter yet fruity), a good bit of alcohol, and some fairly strong ale yeast. Palate is mostly hops of the fruity, noble variety, with a bit of a piney edge. There's enough malt here to balance things out to a degree, but the hugely bitter hop profile dominates throughout.

Not surprising for an IPA, I reckon (we do that in Texas). The taste is peppery and floral. Maybe a bit of pine in there somewhere. It is strongly hoppy but not overpowering. A maltiness comes on after the initial hop assault, then more hops but a more delicate, slightly astringent version. It has a warm, ale-like finish. Mouthfeel is dense and satisfying. Drinkability is very good for a double IPA.

The flavor and feel was an intense bitter beginning that ending dry and grapefruit bitter w/ a light syrup medium body, lively carbonated and a hint of alcohol. Overall, IMO this brew is solid.

Eventually flattening to a thick pasting of fine, creamy bubbles. There are no carbonation streams visible. Sweet aromas of orange rind, blossoms, and a touch of alcohol. Alcohol dipped orange rind flavors are first, followed by some resinous, sticky hop oil and warming alcohol in the finish. The firm, dense body adds a does of sweetness, and the alcohol warms the tongue and throat. The orange rind is compliments by some finely shaved pine needles. The hops remain big and flavorful, but have lost a touch of freshness. The malt body is large and almost chewy and the alcohol is a touch prickly in the back of the throat. With warmth, the orange flavors become more prominent, bordering on becoming hop-laden orange juice. There is some fine bubbled carbonation. With age, this one is still nice and big with hops. Certainly a drinkable beer and quite enjoyable.","hopsaplenty","Oct 16, 2006"

Taste is also grapefruit, citrus hops through the roof, caramel and toffee sweet malts, light hints of alcohol finish out the drying bitter hoppy aftertaste. Absolutely delicious, a hop-head's DIPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and viscous, very light on the carbonation, just a slight tingling in the back of the throat.

The taste is no less great, clean and fresh, but a little sticky at the same time. Toffee and some coffee like flavors that manifest in just the right way on the edges of the palate this is followed by an excellent textured bitterness, then some fruit followed by a superb after taste.

The aroma immediately hits you with hops; grassy, piney, citrus scents all come through. Flavor is surprisingly malty, and the mouthfeel is substantial thanks to the strong malt sweetness present in the beer. Hop flavor is sweet and resiney, not as citrusey as the aroma would lead you to expect. Overall, the strong malt and hop flavors are balanced by just the right amount of bitterness and make this one of the most drinkable 9% beers around. Well done.","Beauregard","Sep 24, 2006"

Deep resinous pine complemented by caramel, toffee and biscuit flavors. A lingering note of orange rind stays on the palate. Alcohol sweetness is also present and then you feel the warmth travel down the throat. The mouthfeel is thick and rich yet carbonated by enough fine bubbles to not get cloying. Assertive bitterness keeps this from being imminently drinkable, but I do want to make my own version. Its that good. The """hype""" is well deserved on this one.

Taste matched smell quite well. Loads of bitterness, but kept from being insane by malt that just did the job, but surely did not come close to balance the hop bitterness, taste, and smell.

4.28,3.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,5,"22oz. bomber. Poured a deep amber in color, primarily clear but a slight haze, with a light tan, medium sized head. The aroma, to me, was pretty simple, honey and pine resin. Taste was well balanced for a DIPA, lots of hops (mainly pine with some citrus), and a strong malt presence coming through to balance it. I was a little surprised that it was not more aggressive in the hop department, but I did not see this as a flaw. The brew was medium in body, and seemed low to medium in carbonation. An excellent experience, and one I will drink more of.","","Aug 18, 2006"

Its rich and decadent nature of course makes it a poor choice for a session beer, but in my opinion thats not the purpose of a DIPA so i wont hold it against this treat.

Finish is moderately bitter is a bit of astringence. The mouthfeel is decent, but after it starts out with solid carbonation, it fades toward the finish some. Medium thick, smooth. Not bad for drinkablility, I just think there's a sweet and tangy flavor punch to the gut but no real subtleties to keep me interested...","bennetj17","Jul 17, 2006"

A thick and full mouthfeel leads to a swirling array of flavors that weave in and out - sweet citrus and honey, followed by cotton candy sugar and pine. The hops are big in a combination of citrus and floral, with a strong malt base riding beneath. A delicate alcohol tingle warms the sides of the cheeks and creeps up the back of the nose.

A refreshing juicy fruit hop front matches the spicy pine and tangerine hop bitterness in the middle and finish. Body is full, creamy, and smooth.

It smells tropical at first (orange, grapefruit, mango, strawberry?), but there are also piney hops, a good malty background, and some burning alcohol, the latter of which makes it a 4.5 for aroma rather than 5. It is thick, heavy, and smooth from the start, with coating/lingering hop oils, leafy/citric/tropical hops, a boatload of sweetness and perhaps nutty malts to balance. Quite good.

It was slightly cloudy and I did notice a bit of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. To me, this is a good thing. Smell- not much aroma coming from the glass, just a whiff of hops and pine aromas. The taste was incredible. A plethora of flavors assaulting my taste buds. Citrus fruit, pine resin, perfumy flavors with bitter hops are present in every swallow with a malted milk/caramel taste to back up the bitterness of the hops. As the beer warmed, every aspect of this beer became more pronounced. I couldn't taste the alcohol, which is deceiving since it's 9.1% abv.

It's strong across the board, pretty to look at and wonderful to drink. The ABV never serves more than a brief glimpse, but it is very warming, and it's effects are very apparent after fniishing one. Now, this is sheer pleasure to drink, but the ABV, coupled with the enamel-stripping, palate-slaying hops, might limit the overall drinkablility.

The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and carbonation is just right.

I wanted this to be the best beer I have had in the past year. I may still have to defer to Great Divide's Fresh Hop Ale. Double IPA's are enjoyable but may still be way too much.

Taste is what I expected, bursting with juicy grapefruit, citrus, and floral hops, a caramel malt backbone doing an admirable job in balacing, a nice lingering hoppy bitter finish. Hops are big, but your tongue doesn't get scoured by them, and you're still tasting by the end of the glass. Mouthfeel is medium with a slightly slick and oily feel.

Plenty of underlying malt flavor provides a nice balance and a bit of nutty flavor. Bitterness is ample, but doesn't seem unrelentingly harsh at 85 IBUs. The 9.1% ABV isn't noted at all.

Chewy grapefruit hops escape with the pour and travel an arms length to my nose. A closer sniff revelas and equally potent biscuity malt component along with a sweet candied aspect. The head fades slowly remaining tall in the middle, while the slightly lower edge leaves a nice scattering of lace. Glowing dark copper colored beer shows little carbonation rising from the bottom. Holy crap in your face flavor. Lots of chewy candied grapefruit hops. There has to be a solid chunk of malt in there because the the alcohol is quite evident, but compared to the hops it doesn't stand a chance. Bitterness steps in midway through and by the finish is potently dominant. There is a strange """wet dog""" flavor in the finish early on, but after half a pint it mellowed to a brief oddity in the finish. A big juicy IIPA that didn't quite do it for me Maybe the hops used aren't my favorite, or possibly it just didn't come together right, but I could definitely do without that freakish aftertaste.","HappyHourHero","Sep 15, 2005"

The lacing is super thick and frothy, sticky, too. Aroma is piney-citrusy hops -- extremely pleasant and not overpowering, probably because of the sturdy malt presence. This malt comes through beautifully in the taste as well with strong hops, of course, slapping around the palate both at the front (clementine rind and grapefruit juice) and the back (oily, piney bitterness). The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth and creamy. High alcohol presence (9.1% abv) is skillfully masked but emerges as the beer warms. This one is dangerously drinkable.

Malty overtones tempered by some incredible hops. A mix of cascade and something else perhaps?

Pungent hop aromas are quite noticeable as well as a bit of fresh pine and a hint of alcohol. The taste begins with a sugary sweetness and fresh lemon followed by a touch of bready malt all leading up to a big kick of bitter raw hop resins.

An attractive ring of delicate lace is left after my first sip, but, curiously, not on any subsequent sips. There are few solid, lethargic trails of carbonation. First aromas are of brown sugar maltiness doing a good job of keeping PNW hop astringency in check. After a stronger swirl of the glass, however, the hops display citrus and pollen--so much, in fact, that combined with the dryness of the nosefeel, I feel like I'm snorting goldenrod. Even less pleasant is the fact that the citric elements here are artificial and solvent, like orange cleaning spray. (See my review of GD's Yeti.) The hops work better in the flavor, offering tons of pine sap flavor highlighted by unsweetened mint and genever, pulling towards a powerful cedary bite. The malt flavors (wheat and raw clover honey) are in the sediment--so pour it! Mouthfeel is oily and coating where some carbonation would help. Furthermore, the drinkability is impeded by the aftertaste, which is just too long--it simply doesn't know when to just dry up and gracefully depart. Another competent but seriously overrated beer from this brewery.","NearerMyBeerToMe","Jul 13, 2005"

Aroma is breathtaking, huge dose of citrusy hops with hints of grapefruit and lemon as well as a piney, resiny aroma and a light carmelly malt scent. Taste begins with a massive hop flavor; I detect grapefruit, lemon, pine oil/sap, herbal and floral notes, then the malt which for the most part takes a backseat but is hefty enough to stand up to the hops. The malt profile is lightly sweet with hints of caramel and turbinado sugar and a hint of hazelnut maybe. The finish is dry and pretty bitter and complex (but not at all unpleasant) and the alcohol is noticeable but not really any more so than other highly hopped IPA's, in other words it's well concealed. Another excellent brew from great divide, it's very much like the TItan on steroids (kind of similar to the relationship of the bell's expedition and kalamazoo stouts)...hopefully we'll see this one in NC soon.

Mouthfeel struck me even more than the taste--a nice balance of smoothness and structure. The hop oils are certainly present but don't overwhelm. The same is true for the taste, which is expectedly hoppy but not terribly bitter, thanks to a happy melding with the malts.

The malt flavor just take away from a good display of the hops ever if they are a bit grassy. It holds up in the mouth and is not too cloy and is not hard to drink a dinner bottle at 9%.

Notes of alcohol in the aroma as well. This is damn near a 5 on smell. Violent hops mob the palate like terrace hooligans rooting for a losing team. The flavor of the hops are spicier than I would have expected, bordering on salty. Some sharp piney and very bitter orange peel and grapefuit get through as well. Not to be outdone, the malts lay down a fat backbone like John Paul Jones on bass. Some sweet caramel and a very subtle breadiness lets you know the malts are still alive and kicking. The bitter citrous hops dry out the finish, but some sweetness lingers. The spicy flavor mingles with warming alcohol, leaving you with a zesty aftertaste. Hell yeah, I'm really glad I picked this bomber up. I think my overall score would be 4.75 straight down the list, but its not quite 5s. Pick it up if you see it!","BeerFink","May 10, 2005"

The head was much improved from my initial review, which leads me to believe that the beer suffered a bit from the trip from Ohio. That said, the balance of this ale is amazing and the flavors are beyond reproach. There's really nothing else like it out there in the beer world. It makes the case for a huge DIPA but with grass and flowers instead of the triple C's and gooey malts. It is like no other double that I've ever had and is in a class all by itself. Especially unique is the nose that is very herbal and spicy yet also has a classic DIPA aroma. The aftertaste BTW will entertain you for hours.","RoyalT","May 03, 2005"

Some maltiness and a fair amount of bitterness. The mouthfeel is on the heavy side. It's pleasant but more of a digestif .

Moving forward I notice some sweet caramel malts underneath the bitter rush, some yeasty nuttiness, and a barely perceived alcohol kick. There is a great coating, lingering resinous aftertaste.

I have been told by many friends, however, that I should try more of them and perhaps I'd learn to like them if only I could find one I really enjoy. This one is IT. This is a truly amazing beer. Just delicious!!! The appearance didn't really have any special appeal to me due to the fact that I am a porter/stout drinker, but it did look quite nice with its fluffly pillow-like head of foam. Orange / rust in colour. The smell is sweet and hoppy with a crippling amount of grapefruit present. The taste? I hope you really like grapefruit if you plan on tasting this. Staggering levels of grapefruit present in the taste with a pleasantly bitter hop bite. The mouthfeel is possibly the smoothest, easiest to drink beer I have ever had. This is just incredible.

Aroma was a nice combination of malty caramel and prominent grapefruit hoppiness, with some orange fruitiness thrown in for good measure. The flavour had plenty of hop bitterness and citrus flavour, balanced nicely by a big malt backbone. Lots of caramel in there. Some similarities to a barleywine. A bit of alcohol warming showed up towards the finish and complemented the full, rich body very nicely. Very tasty and balanced, making it an easy-drinking double IPA.

Now I haven't tried very many other IPA's, so I can't pretend to have a full grasp of the style, but I do think I've gotten a good cross section of different interpretations across the spectrum. In the simplest terms, most IPA's to me are simply way too syrupy sweet, or lacking enough malts to balance out the hoppyness. I'm being picky I know, but that's how it goes sometimes. This is the first IPA I've tried that I think came close to achieving a perfect complement of sweet to bitter.","futaboots","Feb 11, 2005"

I don't think there is the complexity of Arrogant Bastard or Rogue's I2PA, but that said this is a pretty enjoyable brew. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in drinkability.

4.52,9.7,4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Even carefullly poured from a long-standing and refrigerated bottle, Great Divide's Hercules Double IPA delivers a somewhat hazy orange-amber body with a bit of a light crimson cast. Its frothy off-white head drops steadily to become quite creamy; and then slowly fades to a standard collar and whispy surface covering. It leaves thin splashes of lace about the glass, however, which are quite nice. Bright, floral, grassy, lightly piney, and citrusy hops appear in the nose alongside some yeasty fruitiness and sweetish, honey-drizzled malt. The mouthfeel is quite nice: full and dextrinous with a very-fine bubbled, median carbonation as ballast - leaving a gently bubbly caress on the tongue before becoming more creamy and smooth. More sweetish, bready (and even dough-like), and honeyish malt appears in the flavor, dripping with floral hoppy flavors; and tempered by a slap of alcohol and a punch of bitterness that allows it to dry almost immediately in the finish! Hops, however, linger on the palate - floral, piney and citrusy; dancing and swirling until what residual malt is left fades and only bitterness remains. It's a solid duoble IPA to say the least! And very well done! The hops are blended just enough that they don't stray too far towards any particular character (fruity, citrusy, leafy, or grassy for example); and they balance perfectly with the malt that follows the same profile (ie. not too grainy, sweet, honey-ish, etc.). NICE!","NeroFiddled","Jan 04, 2005"

I poured this one out into one of my trusty pint glasses. Near-Perfect appearance for the style, the body is a ruddy copper color topped off with a creamy and sticky eggshell colored head, lacing clings in huge sheets down the pint. The nose on this one is a real sinus-cleanser, the hop aromas lean heavily towards the piney side but there are citrus and citrus peel aromas all very floral, green and resinous. This is of course all binded together by a sticky caramel smelling malt, any alcohol aromas are practically non-existant, which is suprising. In the mouth the malt is nice and stickily sweet, it is quickly over-powered by a dense and practically vibrating bitterness, citrus peel and resinous pine complete the voyage. Again, for the high ABV on this beer, the flavor is very well masked. Hercules is not too sweet which I find in some DIPAs and can become a bit annoying, I do however prefer them a tiny bit drier than is the case here. The mouthfeel is medium and a little sticky, carbonation is ultra-soft. A great representation of a style that I love dearly.","FormatKid","Dec 10, 2004"

The flavor was just a bit of a letdown, only due to the anticipation brought on by the aroma. The grapefruit notes really did not carry through to the flavor, which was a bit blunt in the bitterness, rather than grapefruity-sharp. The malt was more than sufficient to carry the weight of the hops. The flavor profile threatened to go syrupy (i.e. Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA), but stopped short. All-in-all, this was more along the lines of a super hoppy English IPA than a cascades-loaded APA. The high abv was well concealed in the flavor profile.","Brent","Sep 23, 2004"

There is still a note of floral hibiscus and hyacinth. An excellent expression of the style. The hops win out as the ale warms, resulting in a bitter sweet-citrus taste.

As my palate adjusts to the harshness in this beast, it gets tastier and more in balance. I can't really taste it, but there is a serious malt backbone here, which helps to carry the over-the-top level of hopping that is in this beer.

Nice nose, hoppy but with melon qualities that hint at a solid malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium carbonation understated -- probably underscored by a large contribution of barleymalt to the brew. Starts extremely well balanced, hops and a caramel and fleshy fruit sense well-matched (similar to DFH 90 Minute). What happens mid mouth to close is a slight turn to a syupy sense, sweetness seems a little much for me. There is an ashy bitterness to the aftertaste, but less than expected. A good beer, could be a little better within a loose style expectation.","ADR","Aug 19, 2004"

4.2,1.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The beer came in a 22 oz. brown bomber with a label that was somewhat plain looking. The beer was poured into my usual goblet, and displayed a reddish orange slightly hazy body with a large, creamy, off white colored head. The aroma was sweet smelling hops with pine, grapefruit, orange, mango, and hay being the prominent smells. The primary taste was highly citric and piney hops that quite strongly dominated the sweet caramel and honey malts. The aftertaste was peppery and warm alcohol. The mouthfeel lacked the heft of a typical Double IPA and could not quite cover the alcohol, but the beer was still right in line with the style in terms of the raw hop power. Outstanding selection provided to me by meathookjones.","rajendra82","Aug 14, 2004"

4.5,9.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Basically, 90 minute! A dark amber brew, with a slightly cloudy appearance and an off-white head that left ace lacing! The aroma is an assault of caramel malts with a nice load of bitter, balancing hops in the mix as well. The taste is very sweet and malty up front, bready in the middle, and very hoppy in the finish. There is some unique yeast (yeasthead?) work going on here as well, as the finish is astonishingly complex, creamy, and spicy! The mouthfeel is creamy, and big, but not too big, and the drinkability is very, very, very, very good! An excellent Double IPA, that is almost identical to *fresh* DFH 90 minute in 750's (think 2 years ago) A good introduction to the beers oif Great Divide...","francisweizen","Aug 04, 2004"

Huge nose: yards of grapefruit rind and sugar. Outstanding. Front shows mad grapefruit hops and alcohol. The middle turns buttery, thick, syrupy. There is massive hop bitterness in the finish, with buttered, toasted grains and lakes of alcohol. The aftertaste is the rind of a grapefruit. This is one big hop-alcohol-butterymalt monster.","kbub6f","Jul 29, 2004"

Though its easy to find I'd hesitate from calling this a top-shelf beer for the style. But oh well, they're available, well-priced, and easy enough to enjoy.

4.58,11.2,4.5,4,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a beautiful copper amber with a thick which head about a half inch thick. The head seems to never want to recede but when it does it leaves a perfect lace on the glass. The nose of this beer has a strong hop character showing off some piney resin, citrus, and zesty fruit, and from the malt a little caramel makes it way through. There is also some alcohol in the very back of the aroma. Now for flavor this beer packs a punch and a half. Initially hops just smack around the pallate. They provide a zesty twang, with some piney flavors, and some citrus notes. Literally the hops just dominate initially and almost coat the mouth. Definetly a little oily resin in there. Malts work their way into the mix of this beer showing off some dough, biscuit, and caramel, but then the hops just come back. This beer finishes with some sweet citrus hops, and just the right amount of bitterness. God this is good. The mouthfeel of this beer is rich and flavorful with a wonderful creamy body. Just to repeat myself, god this is good!","bigbeerdrinka","Jul 19, 2004"

This is a great beer to slowy enjoy; it's also a departure from some better known Double IPAs (Dreadnaught, I Squared PA, Ruination). I think it's quite well balanced and very enjoyable overall. No problem finishing the bomber, although it is a little heavyon the mouth. I'll definitely seek this out again (and put it in a blind tasting with Hog Heaven. They are INCREDIBLY similar except this has a more hoppy nose and aftertaste). Cheers.","99bottles","Jul 18, 2004"
4.2,1.9,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,"This beer poured a copper amber color and formed a huge bubbly white head that left laticed lace as it slowly subsided. A very small amount of carbonation is present. A heavy of aroma of various hops, some malt, citrus and pine. The flavor is of hops, hops and more hops. Also the pine is still present in the a very bittersweet finish. A fine double IPA.","Wildman","Jul 16, 2004"
4.15,0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"22oz Bomber No Date This is one excellent brew. In my opinion it ranks up there with the best California IIPAs. It poured a clear orange tinted amber with a thick full head. The aroma is potent with grapefruit, pinapple and piney hops. Alcohol is also very much present and to an extent detracts overall. I also smell the malt which has a nutty grainy like aroma.Very much like Dreadnaught, and in some ways reminds me of Marin/Moylans and Yulesmith as well. The body is full and smooth. The flavors are hoppy fruity malty alcohol and despite the latter, delicious. This Ale finishes with a cruel bitterness that hopheads will desire. I do. Excellent retention leaves a well laced empty glass. Top 50? If this belongs there so do some other great IIPAs.","BierReise","Jul 11, 2004"
4.84,17.5,4,5,5,4,5,"Copper appearance. Very slight chill haze. Slight off white head. with little retention. Not many signs of carbonation upon viewing. Lacing is sporadic, but nice. The nose has got it all. It's dominated by the hops with their pine sap, lemon rind, grapefruit and citric attributes. But there's also some caramel dripped sweetness and light bready tones as well. This beer has the perfect mix of bitter hops and sweet malts for an IIPA. The hops are bitter, but fairly clean that way. The hops are juicy. This is perhaps the quality of this beer that I like the most. Like juicy pink grapefruit pulp. With the slightest coating of sugar to keep it in check. The malt backing has nuances of toffee and caramel. The body is round and damn near full. Carbonation is in check. And this is one helluva an Imperial IPA.","Bighuge","Jul 07, 2004"

3.7,-10.2,4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Hazed bronze hue. Lofty, dogged, dense ivory white head yields Belgian lace. Pine sap and lemon juice dominate the aroma. Secondary are softer, candyish undertones of bubblegum and warm, minty ethanol. Quite appetizing aromawise. In flavor, the incipient impression is unexpectedly sweet, being of sugary medium caramel and brioche. Hop bitterness augments steadily, eventually reaching an assertive, barbed combination of quinine and citrus pith. Hop flavor is a creeper as well, with key lime and melon (including rind) arising after a deliberation. As the beer warms malt again runs parallel with the hop presence. Sweet, but singed grainy biscuit and maple syrup tones provide ample contrast to bitterness, perhaps even a touch too much. Moderate in body, with a dextrinous, but lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Finishes sweet, with a browned butter and brown sugar combination marginally offset by hop bitters. Almost a great DIPA, but is a notch too sweet and underattenuated, which muddles what would otherwise be a vibrant hop profile. Everything else is spot on. Very tasty, regardless.","marc77","Jun 28, 2004"

Mild alcohol hints appear in a vaporous form that gently complements the grass aspects. In mouth, the bitterness is intense from the beginning, while alcohol is always standing present, never too strong, never too weak. Very orangey hop profile, but also nicely flowery with fruity pineapple. Extremely dry, but yet has a great throat filling characteristic in the mouthfeel. Creamy texture with medium carbonation. Take it from someone who doesnt like the style too much, this one is really well done and will relieve any hop desire without being over the top and serving no purpose.","Rastacouere","Jun 07, 2004"
4.5,9.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"22oz Bomber bottle. Hercules pours out a cloudy dark copper color with a good-sized light tan head. The lace forms a nice ring around the glass and the head stays along for the whole ride. Its very hoppy in aroma with hints of citrus, spiciness and malts lingering about. The taste is amazing as you first get rushed with extreme hoppiness followed by a nice malty finish. The more this one warms the more is revealed in the complex taste with citrus and nice bitterness to it. It has a great full mouthfeel that complements the taste to create a great beer experience. The alcohol is well hidden but traces of it can be detected, an overall very drinkable beer. This is the beer that let double IPAs take over imperial stouts as my favorite style.
