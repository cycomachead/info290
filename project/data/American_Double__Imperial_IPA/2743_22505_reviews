"I think I might have picked up an old bottle; all logic suggests I should have enjoyed this a lot more than I did."
""
""
"I am quite contrary, no?"
"Smell is honey, sane heavy sweetness in the taste fades to a resinous pine bitterness. Sticky mouthfeel. Not my favorite DIPA"
""
"great sight and taste and a long bitter"
""
""
""
""
""
"Average ipa, citra centric, good aroma ma poor taste profile. Good bitternes ar the end but not much tropical notes that i expected in a Dipa like this. I had better feeling with old version, normal ipa but maximal flavour."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste: Grapefruit, pine, very hop forward.  Medium to full body on the mouth feel.  One of the best IPAs I've personally ever tasted."
""
"Very rich in flavor. Thick mouthfeel. Very tasty."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours with a small, white head. Is amber in color. Has floral, pine, and grapefruit aromas. Initial taste is of floral flavors  Pine flavors immediately follow with grapefruit flavors enter in the end as floral and pine persist. A true symphony of flavor. As of most IPA's, it leaves a dry sensation in the mouth. An amazing IPA. Will definitely be trying this again."
"What can you say? The greenflash sunset is always memorable. This beer works at sunrise too!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and is just enough to fill out the corners but has a smooth drinkable feel that it feels like it’s not out to get you. The bitterness digs in but is not harsh for the regular craft beer drinker and feels like a welcome neighbor leaving the light so you know he’s home."
""
""
"Great juicy and powerful DIPA. Hops were delivered at full-strength. Will buy again!"
""
"Fucking outstanding from the second you open it and smell its like wow and you just fall in love"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Good but not as great as everyone said it would be"
""
""
""
"This is a pretty kick ass IPA. Pours a copper golden color with an impressive foamy head. Lace retains throughout. A fruity, citric and hops aroma. A hop bomb of a taste. Piney and resiny. Fruity taste, particularly grapefruit. A bitter finish lingers. Full bodied but quite drinkable. I'm impressed with all the brews from Green Flash so far."
""
""
""
""
""
"Just a great example of the style.  A beautiful beer to look at, nice hop forward nose featuring mostly pine and peppery spice.  Follows suite on the palate with a touch of malt and a big handful of American bittering hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"So many strains of hops, this one is a great one!  Taste comes off similar to 90min from dogfish head but more florally. Very very smooth easy drinking.  hides the high ABV very well. Not my favorite IPA but one I would definitely get again. Great"
"Considering how many hops are mixed into this, it's really freaking good."
""
""
"Normally, I'm a fan of the DIPA style.  This one seems a bit unbalanced, which could because we're trying it literally on it's Best By date of 3/15/15."
"The premier American Double IPA. As good as it gets."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bomb.  Growler fill, Sorrento Mesa. New recipe punishes, super tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- very good beer, and well named, an excellent representative of the style."
""
""
""
"I really like this IPA But for some reason the hops always seem to give me a hangover no matter how many I've had"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Also- I tried the old version a long time ago before I knew what I was doing so I cannot make a comparison between the 2"
""
""
"one of the better more well rounded IPA's ive had in a while. id give it a 95-100"
""
""
""
""
"O-Excellent IPA, definite west coast reflection, highly recommend."
""
"Oh yeah must try good beer"
""
""
""
"It was better in its original form and ABV."
""
""
"Good stuff!   Would def get me a case of this!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  great ipa.  Balanced well.  There is a lot going on with the hop profile, but I like it."
""
"Wonderful double ipa. Poured into tulip glass. 1 finger head, nice orange color. Hops smack you on first smell with pine and citrus notes. Taste is some malt presence first with west coast hops through remainder. Legendary ipa"
""
"I really want to like Green Flash hop-centric beers. They opened their East Coast location close to me, which is exciting for a simple Virginia boy. I like IPAs and they make several IPAs.I love DIPAs and this is one of those! Sadly, this one, like their Cedar Plank, just doesn't do it for me. There is something about the hops profile that doesn't jive with my taste. This beer passes the look test with flying colors with a thick head that makes me wish I was born a woman. Wait, what? Smells the part, too. But then it hits my tongue and I'm underwhelmed. Bummer."
""
"Poured from bottle into nonic pint. Hazy copper-orange in color with a one-finger white head that quickly dissipates, but sticks nicely. The aroma is immediately hoppy with overwhelming piney resins and citrus. Hints of mint, leaves, and toasted grain come out upon warming. Flavors are of strong citrus juice and grapefruit bitterness followed by some floral undertones. This beer is full-bodied, with an oily, creamy texture, soft carbonation, and a long bitter finish."
""

"Had this on tap and it was okay/solid in every way, but outstanding in none, at least to me. I enjoyed it enough but a 3/5 seems appropriate."

""
"I've been heavy on the double IPAs as of late, and although I've enjoyed a green flash west coast IPA previously, the one I had last night was simply astounding."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great IPA.  Enjoyed it from beginning to end.  Would definitely get it agian."
""
""
""
""
"Overly bitter and cloying. Big fan of citra-hopped IPAs but this didn't do it for me."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very smooth with a bitter finish"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Perfect. This is perfect. It is a beautiful amber. The head went away quickly, but the lace was decent enough. The smell delivers the goods:  floral, citrus, pine, honey. The taste is resiny and bitter, and leaves a great bitter aftertaste. It packs about the same characteristics as the smell. I would absolutely get this again."
""
"IPA don't get much better in my opinion."
"What could make this better?  There's nothing to complain about here, but maybe the head could be more rocky, the flavor could have a touch more booziness.  I just hesitate to pass out the 5's when there are so few beers in this style to compare this too.  It's worlds better than DFH 90min, better than Double Jack and I put this ahead of Ruination too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-  Green Flash continues to amaze me!  Just good slap you in the face hop with continued bitterness that satisfies."
""
""
""
""
""
"It took me way too long to log this go to, readily available, great beer.  22 oz bottle best by 03/18/15 poured into a stemmed glass, new 2014 logo, I assume the recipe is the same from over the years.  Classic example of a true west coast ipa."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very very very very good!"

"A pretty good IPA overall.  It has a nice piney smell and a smooth amber look to it but I found the taste to be a little bit off from some others I have had. I assume that I may have been spoiled by the Green Flash Imperial IPA that I had the night before (excellent stuff there).  I'd drink this beer again but not actively pursue it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great IPA. Wonderful taste and feel, clean and refreshing. Citrus notes, slightly bitter with a nice finish."
""
""
""
""
"D: An excellent example of style.  Not complex, but the perfect balance makes up for it.  Nicely refreshing."
""
""
""
"Best before 2/2015. Insanely bitter.  Bready finish. Unbalanced."
""
""
"I am a fan of Double IPAs and have drank many. But I found this beer had an unusual harsh and abrasive bitterness with very little balance. Just not my cup of tea really."
""
""
"Medium amber.  Piney bitter initial taste.  Lingers for a bit.  Nice overall."
""
""
"I suppose some hop heads can really get down to this, but I find it a little over the top. I don't think I'd drink too many of these by choice, but I'd certainly never turn it down."

"Enjoyed a few GF West Coast IPAs this weekend at Dogwood Tavern in Falls Church, VA. On draft, pours a bright clear mid amber ( I would estimate 9SRM).  Slightly off white head which laced nicely down the glass. Aroma was of Piney, Citrus, Floral. Not overly bitter but a big hop finish.  I really found this beer to be quite good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured pint at the brewery.  San Diego west coast style IPA.  Bottom line, if this is the style you like, you can't go wrong with this beer.  All look, smell, taste notes are classic west coast IPA...fresh hop citrus, clean bitterness, overall delicious.  Tough to decide between going to Green Flash and Iron Fist every time I visit San Diego."
""
""
""
""
"Thick, good nose. Great flavor and finish"
""
""
"I get very little on the nose, some faint citrus.  I get a good citrus taste up front.  The finish wrecks it for me, very bitter with a soapy aftertaste."
"O:  One of my new favorites in the IPA category.  An IPA anyone will enjoy, even my wife."
"Great IPA.  Wish I remembered all the characteristics.  I just remembered that this is great."
""
"I love those west coast hop bombs, and this was one of the first."
""
""
"Good! Nice and hoppy! I'll be back."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a beautiful Double IPA, crystal clear golden with an off-white head, you can read through this beer.  Lacing but not heavy.  Smell of pine and faint malt.  Taste of hops, hops, hops - pine like.  Not a palate wrecker but I wouldn't recommend tasting other brews without a cleanse.  Proper IPA carbonation and bitters giving a nice bite"
""
""
"Overall:this that's is not my preference as I like less malt and strong hops. But respect to the brewers for making such a smooth and well rounded beer.  A great high end brew to establish your respect for IPA's until you find your sub niche balance of hop to malt ratio"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid west coast IPA, I wish they offered more then this beer here in MA"
""
""
"Draft; poured a nice, clear amber with ample head and moderate lacing. Smell was pronounced, mostly hops but with a mix of maltiness. This beer is a hop bomb, which I'm not complaining about, but it just didn't give me as much of a balanced feel as I'd like so I have to give a slight knock on taste. Mouthfeel was pleasant; medium-bodied and easily drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"Really nice hoppy double ipa. Really balance and you could really taste the hops"
"When I have had this beer on tap or from a 22, it made the limited availability of Pliny very very easy to shrug off.  I think the only real point to this review is to advise pours from taps or at least a 22."
""
""
""
"At 95 IBU's, this is one of the most mouth-puckering IPA's I've ever had, and is also pretty darn solid.  You can really taste the different varietals of hops used.  Hop heads, if you need your palate destroyed, this is a great West Coast style IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a perfectly clear golden-orange with decent head and spotty lacing throughout. Aroma is a snoutfull of citrus and hops with citrus rind being the predominant smell. Taste is an explosion in your mouth of the multitude of hop varieties in this one. Tastes of bitter hops, grapefruit, grapefruit rind, pine and resin. Really nice feel of carbonation on the palate and relatively smooth for an IPA at over 8% ABV. Great job on balance. Also leaves a pleasantly bitter hop aftertaste, nice !!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This Imperial IPA poured nicely with a dark amber color, nice head and lacing. You can smell the hops and a citrus aroma clearly comes through. The first sip certainly has some hops and citrus to it but it’s smoother than other IPAs in that there’s some interesting flavors that come through. I think “fresh grass” best describes it and it’s quite pleasant. The mouth feel is wonderful with just the right amount of carbonation. Overall, this is one fine IPA that’s a fridge buddy for sure! 8.1%ABV"

"Smells really good. 95 IBUs are very evident, though. Not my favorite."
""
""
""
"Smooth on the palate, with tastes of citrus and pine but with an overwhelming bitter aftertaste.  Bitterness hides the other nuanced flavors. Tastes like an ipa, rather than a double."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is another one of my favorite IPAs, so glad I live in CA where its readily available, fairly priced for $7.99 a four pack, it's heavy on the palate, two and I'm done but it's a world class IPA, a must try for the hophead."
""
"Part of a pricey eight pak that hasn't disappointed one iota, so let's give this selection a whirl.   Popping the top I get a very fresh piney citrus waft with a nice sweet backbone under it.  Pours to a cloudy bright orange with a one finger head that recedes to a quarter inch and hangs out. On the taste this brew has an exceptionally smooth citrus and pine taste up front with a sweet middle followed by a citrusy bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is superb with a smooth as silk viscosity and a sharply sparkling carbonation that breaks it up oh so slightly.  Look up IPA in the dictionary and you see this brew.  Nicely masked 8.1 ABV that creeps up on you and gives you a nice glow.  A winner."
""
""

"My new favorite DIPA.. where to start this beer really rolled out the red carpet for hops! The pour was smooth with a minimal effort head with great retention and sticky lacing the color is almost tinted ruby red the head also slightly tinted ruby red the smell was a citrusy and highly floral thanks to those cascade hops the taste was smooth citrus with layered pine into a comfortable bitter peace the alcohol is so well hidden when cold but dont let the smooth taste fool you! The alcohol will punch you in the mouth when warm but it's refreshing.. Pretty amazed by this beer don't let that simple label fool you this modest beast will take your taste buds for a ride... West Coast IPA"

"great IIPA  thats available all year.. and a lot of states"
""
""
""
""
"I'd buy again."
"O:  BIG hop bite here, and lots of bitter up front, in the middle and on the back; it's not a grapefruit bomb, but the pine and bitter mix up with the orange to create something close; classic big hoppy brew"

"Piney, floral. Medium hop bite with smooth aftertaste. Medium carbonation. Nice drinkablity."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Taste- this is a big IPA but super smooth and balanced. Starts hoppy but mellows in the middle with some sweetness. Finishes long and hoppy but crisp at the same time. A great imperial IPA. 95 IBUs."

"From a 12 oz. bottle into a standard pint glass. Pours a cloudy apricot amber with a 1 finger head; excellent lacing. The aroma is fresh grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, bubblegum, and honey. The hops are complex and potent with pungent citrus zest blending into a piney fresh lemon and alcohol middle. I don't detect much malt presence except for a slight earthiness throughout. This is certainly a top-shelf west coast IPA with enough hop presence to satisfy even the most ardent hop head."
"Had a 4-pack of this last night. Tasted really good, and I should know because I drink a lot of IPA."

"A good, bitter DIPA. Most DIPAs this bitter seem to be so rich it's hard to enjoy more than 2. This goes down easy. I'll buy it again, for sure."

"One of my favs.  Unique DIPA selection.  Consistent with Green Flash flavors"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A well crafted DIPA, not one that makes me want to scream from the mountain tops extolling its virtues, but one that I will gladly have again. All kids of hoppy, without the palate scorch of other IPAs from the left coast."
"O: This is a classic west coast hop bomb. I wish it had a little less grapefruit bitterness, but still a great brew."
"As a lover of both San Diego and the Green Flash Brewery the current quality of this previously excellent double IPA is a huge disappointment.  I cannot put my finger on it.  Perhaps I enjoy their Hop Head Red and Le Freak so much that the West Coast IPA no longer measures up.  The malty taste of alcohol is too strong, yet the red copper color is still inviting.  I avoid it in the store and grab it on tap only when other fine IPAs are not available.  The aroma and taste are no longer as clean as it once was.  Still a good beer, but no longer a stand out."
""
""
"Bitter off taste from the hops. Not bad, but not good enough to buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow, such a great beer had to do my first review.  Head pours strong, thick, and white.  It stays much longer than any IPA I have had.  Taste is true & what you expect from a double West Coast IPA.  A Hop lover's go to brew."

"Truth in advertising. Massively hoppy. Pine resin nose. Broad flavor profile but the bitter citrus sits on top of it all. Definitely a west coast IPA. Recommend for beer geeks but may put off the uninitiated. A great beer."

"This is the *Belgian*-brewed version contracted out to St Feuillien. It's bottle-conditioned to help shelf life for European distribution; otherwise aiming for the same standard, so (and I checked with moderators) goes in the same entry as the native version. Notes are combined from a few tastings, not simultaneous but about a week removed from sampling a bottle of the American version.... Appearance is spot on, the copper of a cloudy Pacific sunset, under a layer of finely bubbled, creamy head, with just a bit of milky residue in the bottle to attest to the refermentation. The nose seems slightly less powerful and less flowery, but still an enticing pine forest with bready notes, a bit of banana (it's not Belgian yeast, though), some subtle spicing, but clean. Flavor to me seems slightly fruitier and less cereal, with juicy apricot, mandarin orange, plus a bit of sweet grapefruit flesh to go with the punch of grapefruit pith of the hops. Aftertaste/feel of pine resin and florals lingers nicely. Similarly substantial and creamy mouthfeel that swallows cleanly. My impression is of a very close fraternal twin."

"Pretty good IPA but hard into the pine, green. Very intense in that sense, could be a bit better balanced in my opinion but it is a great example of the west coast IPA!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a hop lover's dream come true. It is an exceptional Double IPA. I think I remember liking the old West Coast IPA better than this one, but I can't complain here. I just wish this version was more malty to balance out the extremely hoppy flavors that come out in the beer. But if you like extremely hoppy beers or just want to take a walk on the wild side, try this!"
""
"I usually like Double IPAs. For me, this was pretty harsh. Really an assault of bitterness on the tongue with not much else. Not an easy drinker by any measure. Not a fan."

"As I stated -- WOW.  Very strong hops that persist, a very no punches pulled experience.   Takes Sierra Nevada's Torpedo and doubles down.   Maybe the best beer I have tried.  Then again, it's raining in Santa Cruz County today and I could be biased.   But very, very good."

"Pours a nice light, golden amber color.  Nice lacing, sticks to the glass and tells me my dishwasher works great.  Hoppy aroma.  I hate to sound like that chick in the Rebel IPA commercial, but it's definitely an IPA.  Taste confirms it is indeed a Double IPA.  Piney, grapefruit, citrus taste.  Diggity dank.  Can Green Flash do no wrong?  This is good.  Thank god I live on the West Coast."

"What impresses me about this IPA is that it manages to be bold and yet delicate and well balanced. A variety of flavors shine through despite the usual intense resiny flavor and bitterness. The mouthfeel is also nicely put together, as it provides a good counterbalance to the intense flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
"I big bold IPA that lived up to all the hype. Smells like you just woke up in a flower bed , in the middle of a pine forest,  just after it rained. Big blast of hops on the first taste with lots of grapefruit/citrus and a sweet caramel malt. Real nice bitterness on the back of the tongue that lasts a long time. Slightly less sweetness and this would be my perfect beer. Will be one of my go to beers."

"O: I give it a 4/5.  That's an """A"". This ale is unique and full of flavor. But overall, it's not something I'd see myself drinking very often.  With that said, I'll enjoy the two I have left and probably pick up some more next year."

"Overall this was definitely one of the best beers I ever had. Floral aroma and very well hopped, exactly how an IPA should be."
""
""
"Outstanding rainbow of flavors!"
""
"Green Flash does it again! From the double imperial stout all the way to the other end of the spectrum... Green Flash is one of my favorite brewers! However, if you don't like hops, you might want to stay away from this one!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a thick amber gold. Head was two fingers off white. The nose is a peppery lemon grapefruit. Definitely a lot of citrus notes. You can smell the sweetness of the malt, but the alcohol remains hidden to the nose. The taste is aggressively bitter.  There's a hint of caramel,  but that is quickly masked by the tidewater of hops. They coat the tongue. The bitterness stayed for seven counts after swollowing. Pretty intense. Good if you love bitterness."
""
"Overall - The color was a tip-off. Yes, this a California hop bomb but there is just enough toasted malt flavor to keep things interesting. I wouldn't call the beer """balanced""" but I would call it tasty. Yet another brewery to put on my """must visit""" list (I live just 80 miles north of downtown San Diego)."
"Great beer, lots of hops lots of flavor. By far the best beer made by Green Flash."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - The smell is great, and the taste is sweet at first but the bitter aftertaste is very powerful, maybe a bit overpowering."

"This beer is exceptional with the best combination of Hops my """buds""" enjoy (Cascade, Centennial...) There is nothing I can find wrong. It starts off mellow with just enough hoopiness, but it could bite you in the butt. The citrus notes of all the West Coast hops are amazing. Reminds me of lying on the beaches of California with citrus trees nearby. Even though it has a fairly high IBU count it doesn't taste like it. Something that a normal IPA drinking can enjoy but he/she might want to think about standing up too fast. lol"

"Great looking brew that has great clarity and a clear orange hue. Goodly amounts of lace after a slow fade from the sizable head. Nose has a cornucopia of hops. Lots of biting grapefruit at first with a pine bed that sets the stage for a healthy caramel malt that brings balancing sweetness and flavors. Taste is quintessential West Coast. Hops explode from the initial contact. Grapefruit and hop oil at first burst on the scene. Big malt core carpets the somewhat abrasive swallow. No alcohol flex and a refreshing. character makes this one came across as a session beer. Then again it is a delicious and aggressively hopped brew. Feel is lighter than it should be. Easy to quaff and enjoy. Stupendous beer. Drinks below it weight class. Tastes above it."

"I really couldn't get over how much this one smelled like marijuana.  I retired 10 years ago, but you can't mistake that smell.  Terrific flavor.  Drank in a pint glass poured from a growler.  Would definitely drink again."

"This West Coast-Style India Pale Ale is extravagantly hopped, full flavored, medium bodied and copper colored. A menagerie of hops is combined throughout the brewing process to impart specific characteristics. Hops used include Simcoe for a unique fruitiness and grapefruit zest, Columbus for strong hop pungency, Centennial for pine and citrus notes, and Cascade for floral aroma."

"I just keep trying these brews from Green Flash.. first the double stout, now this one - it has a tasty hop explosion on the tongue. The hop flavor notes goes from an intense citrus rind to a heavy leafy herbal to an intense piney/spruce like character and back again somewhat typical of a great hopped beer. The malt adds some supporting sweetness in the beginning with some bready and yeast like notes. There are some peach like fruit notes with maybe even a slight hint of cherry. The finishing hop flavor takes over and coats the plate with heavy citrus and piney bitterness. A beautiful beer."

"Pours a copper color with over a finger of head that retains for a good long time and leaves a touch of lace on the glass. The nose is definitely hoppy but not terribly complex. The flavor is very similar to the nose – definitely hoppy but not very complex as far as other flavors. This remains a strong effort but it is certainly nothing extraordinary."

That's worrying. And it seems Green Flash stopped dating bottles. That's doubly worrying. I hope it doesn't take another two and a half years to find a fresh batch of this beer again, because it's really damn delicious right now."

"The beer pours a lot of creamy white head and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The beer itself is a nice clear copper. The smell has strong sweet notes mixed with grapefruit hops mixed with floral notes. The smell also has weak hints of pine. The beer taste is surprisingly different from the smell. The taste has strong grapefruit and pine notes with weak floral notes and a bit of malt sweetness to it. The beer also has a slightly yeast backbone that works very well with the hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodiedbut is a bit heavy. Biting carbonation with a dry finish. Overall, a fantastic IPA and worth getting. I'll definitely pick this one up again."

"Overall: Very solid IPA, in my opinion maybe a little over ranked but not by much. Good price point for the quality."
""
""
"I was blown away by this beer. There was not a lot of build up for this beer, but when I got to try it I thought it was great. The appearance was a dark yellow with a nice sticky head. The smell was nice with a lot hops. The taste was great with mellow taste in the beginning from the malt and then a lot of floral and grapefruit flavors come out in the middle from all the hops. The finish had a bit of a molasses taste which I thought cut the bitterness well. A wonderful beer that I would highly recommend hop-heads to try."
""
""
"I thought this beer was good but it didn't blow me away. I want to give it another chance. The bottle I drank had a best-by date on it that passed a few months ago, and this was one of the last beers I had during a night of drinking, so I probably wasn't primed to appreciate it as much as I perhaps should. Anyway--the hops were strong and flavorful (with a steady malt backbone); mouthfeel is thick and substantial. This is a good, serious IPA."
""
""
"Pours a clear light amber/orange with hints of ruby. One finger white head with minimal lacing. Slight touch of citrus in the aroma but nothing substantial, mostly piney hops with a touch of caramel and alcohol. Flavor is again piney and resinous with a deeper floral presence, again light on the citrus notes, maybe the slightest hint of orange zest. I usually like more of a balance with my fruit-hop bitters but this one is all bitter hop and it works really well. Light on carbonation with a fairly dry mouthfeel. Bitterness lingers for quite awhile, this is the type of IPA that got me into the style."

"Got back to a local tavern for a second (and third) pint of this classic West Coast IPA. Big pine and fruit hops and a great bitter finish. Crisp and refreshing, a very drinkable beer.

"the green flash was first tried in philadelphia at ortleibs. a great little place to see good music and enjoy several craft beer options. good people make everything more enjoyable and the staff there were friendly and helpful, and deftly navigating a busy hipster crowd. the green flash delivers mucho hops to your face and leaves your palate covered in it. smells like beer and i like beer smells. this is an ipa that is not for those who don't like ipa's, its an ipa drinkers beer... and i recommend this beer called the green flash."

"Was looking forward to this beer from Green Flash. Overall, not that impressed. Purchased in a 4 pack and tasted over two nights to give it a couple chances. Appearance was cloudy and smell was just ok. Was expecting a little more as Green Flash typically delivers. A little too bitter for me."
""
"Pours a slightly hazy medium amber with a slight red cast. Very strong head with exceptional lacing. The nose is a blend of hops - grapefruit and other citrus over a light pine resin overlaying a subtle malt sweetness. The body is almost medium with a nice smooth texture. Normal carbonation level. The outstanding flavor profile is complex and well balanced. Like the nose, grapefruit and other citrus lead with an earthy pine in the background. A biscuit malt sweetness appears in the middle, which rapidly flows into a quite nice tart bitterness. The finish is smooth and a nice tartness lingers. A bit more carbonation effervescence would accentuate the flavor of the finish and the underlying hop resin."

"Overall I thought this was a pretty a nice beer and a pretty standard and nice example of a West Coast IPA, it seemed to be pretty inline with the style, but it lacked that juiciness and brightness that some of the better ones seem to have, but I still thought it was very solid for what it is. This beer had nice drinkability, it was fairly smooth, clean, a little crisp, a little filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think I could drink a couple of these, but that would probably be my limit. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma, they were both pretty good and they were the highlights of this beer. What I liked the least about this beer was that the taste wasn't a little more juicy and bright. I don't think I would buy this again, it's a little pricey for what you get and there's more than a few west coast style IPA's that I like more. I would recommend this to anyone who likes the style. I'm still not sold on Green Flash, but this wasn't a bad beer at all and I thought it was pretty solid for what they were going for. Nice work guys, keep up the solid work. So far this is my favorite Green Flash beer."

"All you want from a DIPA Westcoast style. All the hops aroma and taste. Strong bitterness and to my personal dissapointnent not enough caramel malt for blance. Still very good. BTW this is the local Belgium brewed version."

"Pours a hazy amber with a big foamy head that hangs around. Heavy lacing. Big aroma of hops and citrus. Piney hops, grass and grapefruit predominate the taste. Lots of bitterness. Medium mouth that coats the tongue nicely. If you like hops for days, this is a wonderful beer."

"I keep getting wowed by this brewery. This outstanding ipa pours a cloudy deep amber color with a two finger white head that dissolves to a mere film on the beer decent legs and lacing. The aroma is pure California hops. Pine, citrus, tropical and stone fruits, and a decent aroma of weed. It sips clean and pure and very refreshing. There is just enough body to coat the mouth with gorgeous hoppy resin. The flavor is simple and to the point...hops. a little malt on the aftertaste but mostly just glorious hoppy bitterness. This is an outstanding ipa and should be viewed (along with stone and lagunitas) as the benchmarks of west coast ipas."

"I have been waiting a while for a beer to come along and truly blow me away, create a paradigm shift if you will, or at the very least, leave me awestruck. A guy can get a bit jaded with this sort of mentality, as many very good beers can still leave one wanting just a little more. On this occasion, I felt this awe and really did get a jolt of beer-hunter enhancing excitement. Admittedly, I didn't think this would be the beer. Then again, Green Flash is pretty well-regarded in terms of flavor if not price. This brew is a dark russet amber color with a decent dose of beige head that threatened to billow over the sides of my American pint glass. Aroma included all the features you'd expect in a top-shelf IPA, quite tropical, certainly citric: Grapefruit rind galore, fresh pine resin, sweet caramel malts, a solid dose of flower shop and spice cabinet. Hits all the marks. Wait until you taste it, however. This one has layers that peel back as you go. Starts with grapefruit and tangerine flesh and rinds, cantaloupe melon, a little red berry (good old Simcoe), tart bright lemongrass, and then BOOM, massive pine sap and pot resin launch a Blitzkrieg. Very aggressive and spicy menthol bitterness that builds and builds, begins like a cough drop and evolves into mouth numbing spruce needles and mustard greens ... There's almost a heat present, and the floral and citrus elements never quite disappear. I get fresh lime juice, perfumed black tea, white pepper ... Just when you think its done, some fruity grape and gummy candy pop in and you wonder how you can still taste something so subtle amidst all the oily resins and sour fruit wash. The malt backbone manages to protrude into one's awareness despite the hop attack, some light toffee and toast. Medium body, its a tad chewy but not enough to escape the impression that this is a hop bomb as opposed to something sweet. One of the most pine-laden and bitter IPAs I've tried to date, yet redolent with all kinds of fresh juicy fruit flavors. If this is such a world beater, what must Pliny taste like? Someday I shall find out. For now, Green Flash has a wide distribution network and thank God."

"I had to drink two bottles of this one to try and determine the unique Hop flavor happening, their web site says"""Columbus for strong hop pungency""". So I guess that describes it...Pungency. This one will grow on you for sure definitely a characteristic of the PNW brews I have been enjoying but definitely an excellant IPA."

"World class IPA, perfectly executed. Bold with an insistent bitterness. This one is hard to improve. Still so balanced, that my wife who does not like beers, found it nice, despite of its 95 IBUs and 7.3% abv."

"Poured form a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. Orangeish apperance with a nice white head that takes it time to disapate. Smells…Pine, Hops, lots of hops some citrus notes are prevalent as well. Taste is what I've come to expect from these West Coast styles, the first thing that my tounge noticed was the hoppy, piney taste that I love. Real nice mouthfeel, bitter but also some malts in there to balance it out. Awesome. The ABV is disguised well here so tread carefully but Enjoy!"

"This is about as good as it gets if you are a hophead. Nothing gets in the way of the floral, citrus and pine smell and taste. Hoppy resin lingers long after the swallow. Hop bitterness stays on your tongue as well. Just a perfect example of a west coast IPA. Damn near perfect beer."

"This craft is remarkable. I'm so glad I had it without a bit of food--as a result, even the 7.3 went to my head. None of that booze, though, never mucks up the nose or taste. And I'm excited, now, to pair its beautiful use of lime with Mexican food, especially with proteins from the ocean. The only thing not stunning about this IPA is the splash it makes in the glass, but what a performer the rest of the way!"

"M - A bit thicker than a typical West Coast IPA but also crisper. The hops dry out your mouth. Also, not as filling as I would have thought. It drank smoothly and before I knew it, my glass was empty."

"This beer is hops, hops, and more hops! Definitely a West Coast IPA with a very clean hop bite and a lingering resinous hop aftertaste. This one leans more towards the piney hops rather than a strong citrus flavor with a very in your face hoppiness. While the bartendress warned me that it was really aggressive I really enjoyed it. Another fantastic brew from Green Flash which continues to impress."

"This one's pretty dry the whole way, though the body is semi-dry until the finish, where I would definitely consider it dry. The juiciness makes the mouth water and helps with the dryness. Otherwise it's nicely crisp and has a bit of smoothness running through the medium body as well."

"Deep amber with a good finger of off white head. Nice smelling IPA some sweet malty under notes but this brew is dominated by delicious hops. I’m picking up on heavy pine notes as well as some citrus in the aroma. A nice hoppy flavor and a bit of hop bitterness as is to be expected in a beer like this. The flavor to me is primarily grapefruit with some pine resin more in the aftertaste. These hoppy characteristics are balanced out quite nicely by the solid caramel malt backbone to this brew. This is definitely a hop forward beer though, just the way I like ‘em. A damn solid west coast IPA that goes down surprisingly easy and is quite refreshing considering it is a 7.3% brew."

"Overall - It was a very solid and drinkable representation of the style. For something calling itself a west coast IPA, I was expecting much more citrus notes and less malt. It's a good beer but not a great beer. I felt the smell was very lacking."
""
""
""
"Amber orange in color with a bit of cloudiness. A millimeter thin layer of foam rests on top. I've had this before but it's been awhile. Fantastic intense grapefruit like hop aroma. Best smelling IPA I know of. Pretty smooth mouthfeel with a bit of hop stickiness. Intense hop flavor is well balanced with a light malt backbone. Love this."

"Green Flash makes its big beers, but this is one I'm always hesitant about trying due to its obvious intensity. Make no mistake, this is an impressive West Coast take on the style, but it's so different from the usual offering in so many ways. Due to its extreme bitter profile, it's far from balanced or applicable for everyday drinking in my routine. Nevertheless, it's a perfect example of Green Flash doing what they do best - getting the hop profile, turning it up to 11, and somehow make it drinkable throughout. Recommended for those wanting more intense hoppy beers."

"My first few sips, I was incredibly underwhelmed with this beer. As I went along, I enjoyed it a little bit more each sip. I'm not too sure I'd consider it a """World Class""" sort of IPA, but I will say that the depth of flavors and how much this beer changes as you drink it is a huge feat."
"Overall - this is one of the best IPAs I've ever had and, as far as I'm concerned, it is a benchmark for it's style. IPA is my everyday style and the only one I consider myself knowledgeable in and this is world-class, without question."

"Overall: If the point of this IPA is balanced layers of bitterness then its definitely a winner. I've never used the term """dank""" for a beer before, but I'm assuming it can be used here. Based on the good reviews, this is a quality many people go for, but I seriously doubt I'll ever buy this again - just not my thing."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but should be very fresh. Pours moderately hazy orange amber color with a 1-2 finger dense cream colored head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, apricot, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, floral, grass, pine, caramel, and floral earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity of hop notes with moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, orange zest, orange rind, lemon zest, pine, floral, grass, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness. Large amount of pine resin bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, pineapple, citrus zest/rind, pine, floral, grass, caramel, bread, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; with minimal cloying bitterness present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and very sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic IPA! All around awesome complexity of hop flavors with moderate malt balance; and very crisp and smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."

"O - west coast at its finest! Green Flash takes the lead and carries the flag as holder of the best standard West Coast ipa I've ever had. It takes the ipa style to a completely different level and just struts its liquid self around in utter arrogance. Really a true piece of Californian brewing brilliance with Green Flash's take on this storied style."

"WC IPA is only available in a four pack ($12) now so when I see it on tap for $6 a pint I feel like it will be a great deal for IPA lovers looking for a balanced beer that is easy on the gut but still provides a palatable punch any day of the week. Although the only place I have had it on tap was this summer at Citizen Burger in Charlottesville."
""

"Overall a must try for hopheads. Bold and bitter. Huge hops throw this out of balance but that is to be expected. Not terribly complex but still really good. Would get again but I do prefer my IPAs a little more balanced"

"Final Thoughts: It's nice to review an IPA that's a) fresh and b) good. While probably not cracking my top 5, Green Flash West Coast IPA is a very good beer. I've gradually become harsher on grading beer (especially IPAs, as they make up one of my favorite styles) and it is obviously reflected in the final score. However, let it be known that this beer is heads and shoulders above any other run-of-the-mill American IPA swill that so many pop-up breweries are releasing. But I digress. Would I drink it again? For as long as Green Flash distributes to MN."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the best American IPA's brewed in the west Coast."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, definitely lives up to its name. Piney bitterness abounds; maybe my palate has been wrecked (Green Flash pun intended), but even this beer, which is often cited as incredibly bitter, doesn't seem unbalanced to me. I'd usually prefer a tropical/floral IPA to a piney/bitter one, but it's still an amazing IPA. Extremely well-done."
""
""
""
""

""
"O: a def go to. im glad they,ve expanded their offerings at a reasonable price! love this brew!"

"Overall - really like this beer, it's a touch pricey though."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Extremely bitter, so its reputation is certainly deserved in that regard. Like many, this beer still benefits from extreme freshness, and even though it was still in code, it felt as though it lost an edge. When within three months of bottling, this is one of the best readily available west coast style IPAs in my market."

"Wow, I would buy this more if it was not for the four pack format.... I Prefer Two Hearted as it is a better beer and available for around the same price and I get two more beers. But damn this is the exact thing I think of when I think of West Coast IPA... It lives up to its name. I grab a four pack once a month or so. I just crave that WC IPA taste"

"This is a beer I return to regularly and really like but feel has been surpassed in recent years. It's great looking and darker than most west coast ipas. The smell is piney with hints of orange and passion fruit. Taste is similar but has a good bit of bite. Yet there's an undertone of sweetness that I detect now that I didn't notice in the past. Maybe my palate has changed, but I liked the drier sensation. Still, a classic and a good go-to DIPA."

"If you are looking for a strong representation of the West Coast IPA style, you should enjoy a bottle. Very drinkable. Well done."
"Overall this beer has so much going for it but i found the level of alcohol a little high. I like IPAs to be around the 6% - 6.5 % range. Once you get over the 7% range you start venturing into the Double IPA valley, which is by no means a bad thing. Good brew nonetheless. Looking for more brews from this place. Well done."

"I don't think I'm alone saying this is in my top 3 favorite beers, it's truly magical on tap or in a fresh 4x12 or 22. It's got subtlety to sip and ponder, or one can take it to a party and enjoy the hell out of. There's a select number of IPA's that can take me to """that place""" and this is easily one of the most easily obtained of them."

Plus the wife hates it. Top 3 of my favorite brews. If I was ever stranded on an island, I would want a black angus cow, a lawn chair and a keg of this."

"I did not find this incarnation significantly different from previous, although I would describe the head as off-white.  By now I am much more experienced in DIPA drinking and did not find this meriting the rather extreme statements I had made about the hop bite a year ago.  It's still very good, but I prefer either a citrus-dominated or caramel malty DIPA, the latter well represented by Green Flash's Palate Wrecker."

"dark clear copper color with nice 1/2""" soft foam head, great lacing. very nice floral, light citrus hop aroma. hops dominate the taste too, but a nice malt undertone, biscuity. very nice. medium body, moderate soft carbonation. drinks smooth. overall, a great IPA"

"O - I can't get enough of the west coast IPAs so I must admit I am biased. This isn't my favorite IPA but I enjoy the unapologetic hoppyness of this beer. If this had more body I would be truly enamored. I'm sure to buy this again."

"Pours dark amber with 2 finger off-white head. Good retention and lacing. Aroma of pine resin, citrus zest, malts, pineapple and mango. Very malty with caramel and toffee notes. Huge pine resin on the back end that really sticks around. Full body with moderate carbonation, finishes super dry. That dry bitter finish compromises the drinkability.  Overall it is a very well crafted and balanced IPA, but the bitter dry back end makes it less appealing in my IPA repertoire."

""
"O: The hops from the nose dont come out in the taste. Not a bad beer but pretty disappointing. I dont think Id purchase this one again, not with so many great IPAs sitting on the shelves at any given time."

"Wow, this is hoppy! Very bitter, fruity, and delicious. If you love hops this is the beer for you. If not, it might be too overpowering. Just an excellent all around IPA. Definitely one of my favorites, and up there with the IPA gods, Bell's two hearted, dogfish head 60 and 90 min, schlafly Tasmanian IPA, etc."

"This is a really great IPA and I have tried a lot of ipa’s lately, I really like this one and here’s why. It pours a beautiful glowing, amber color with a copper/orangey hue. Hazy with 3 fingers of bone white head that fell slowly to a thick collar and cap with a nice skin on top. Lots of effervescence. Just beautiful. Nose is sparkling with floral hops, grapefruit, some tropical, lots of citrus. lemon and lime. A really deep malt spine. Caramel, toffee and bread. No alcohol on the nose. A graceful light pine and I do smell a little yeast. Taste is excellent. Fruity hops, orange, delightful bitter, juicy tropical fruits, good bread and caramel. Simple and delicious. Drinks so easy, you definitely want more than one. Finishes with a light coating of resin and oil for a piney aftertaste with a little bread and sweetness. This was a truly great IPA that had enough hop bitter to tempt you into each sip but not enough to sting you for it. I really liked this."

"O - The classic, and aptly named West Coast IPA, is full of...you guessed it, pine. And its extremely bitter. While this may have been one of the better IPA's back when, its overly aggressive flavor, and feel just renders your taste buds useless for a while. Though if you're in the mood for that kind of beer, this is it, and much more so than palate wrecker in my opinion."

"Overall - Although I was disappointed in the first beer I reviewed tonight, the Green Flash has more than redeemed the experience. This means that much more coming from someone who is not a hop head and doesn't drink IPA all that often. This is an exceptional beer no matter which way you look at it. I would strongly recommend this to intermediate level craft beer drinkers and above, as it may be too aggressive for a beginner, but it is outstanding. I can't say enough good things about it."

"Pours a medium orange-amber color. Medium white head with good retention and lacing. Huge aroma of citrus, floral and piney hops and a mild dose of yeast. Flavor has just enough malt backbone to balance the big hops. Lots of grapefruit and floral with a hint of pine. Medium mouthfeel and slightly dry finish. The glass I had was very good and it was past its prime. This stuff must be phenomenal when it's fresh."

This would be a great beer for new beer drinkers that are starting to get into the IPA category. A beer that won't destroy the palate but will showcase that bitter/spicy quality that hop heads grow to know and love."

"Served on tap into a tulip at Big Orange on 4/20/13. Poured a dark blend or pure red and dense orange-copper, creating a nice color similar to a ruby red grapefruit. It was very dense and allowed little to no light penetration. On top there was voluminous head the color and apparent look of crushed limestone. Looked great in the glass. The smell up front was lots of dark resin and very dank. There was a good amount of caramel sweetness to balance. As the beer opened up, there was good grassy smells and some citrus: mainly grapefruit and lemon oils. The taste very much like the nose. There was a good sweet caramel malt, but it was definitely a big, bitter hop bomb. There was lots of big citrus fruit like oranges and limes, but also some big pine and mint flavor as well. It did get a tad astringent, but only ever so slightly. The beer had great body overall with a dry and bitter finish. No ethanol burn to it at all. Overall, this is an excellent and big IPA. They almost went too far, but kept it overall in check. Very tasty brew.."

"O - Really surprised by this one, and another solid offering from Green Flash. Right up there with SN Torpedo as far as """Big IPA with malt""" style. Highly recommended."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Can't wait to get home and drink the real deal."
""
"O - Good meld of hop aroma with underlying malts. Taste is great again from malt striking a stylistic balance. Hops lent a unique flavor profile also drying the beer up well. Bitterness was a little on the sharp side for my preference and a little over carbonation contributing to that sensation. All in all I am happy to have tried this beer and will look to seek out more from this brewery as I have heard great things."

""

""

"O - Overall one of my favorite beers. In an elite class of IPAs and sets a standard for depth in hop flavor. The hops in this beer will stay longer than almost any IPA and the bitterness is addicting."

"Overall a nice IPA, not quite what I expect for a """West Coast""" IPA, but those terms are a bit out of date now. A nice big hoppy beer, quite bitter that plateaus right away, nice hop characters with a little spicy (but not chewy), a bit of citrus but more like rind and pith bitter citrus, and just enough malty sweetness to give it a base so it doesn't get astringent. Nice IPA."
"This is my first legit tasting of a West Coast designated IPA. It poured beautifully with a picture perfect head. Slightly murky amber orange that tells me we are packing natural flavor here. Smells like hoppy bread dough. Wonderful hop flavor follows which takes me to a new place with every mouthful. Grass, dandelion, grapefruit, resin, mineral- a ubiquitous profusion of hop flavors continue to evolve. The label says """Extravagantly Hopped""". Well, that about says it all. This beer is so well crafted it is wasted on a neophyte so save this for your well versed IPA connoisseurs. Overall it is a magnificent beer that is sure to impress any IPA fan."
""

"Overall: If you're a fan of West Coast IPA's, you will enjoy this beer. Plenty of hops, will satisfy most hopheads."

"Green Flash West Coast IPA pours a clear dark golden color, with a long lasting, and lacing head. There is a nice dry floral, hoppy aroma. The taste has a nice subtle hoppy flavor, nice and dry. Easy to drink, flavors are full, but the floral flavors are not overwhelming. Overall a very nice good flavored and enjoyable IPA."

"O: Well, I did not like this IPA at all and it is supposed to be top notch. I enjoyed Palate Wrecker a lot more. I will have to revisit this one, but I will not be getting it again for a while. Not even sure if I will finish it."
"HAd this one on Tap in Denver. I'd only had it in bottles, so it was nice to get it on tap. As you'd expect, the light colored beer had a big citrusy and piney hop aroma. The first sip backed up the aroma with lots of hop and not much malt (but hey, that's the way it is supposed to be). Definitely a great beer. Nice to have it on tap."
""

"one of the best ipas out there especially on tap wich i used to drink at a place called coney island until they kicked me out for something my brother did. not a very friendly place with the bartenders wanting outrageous tips. plus the women bartenders think they know everything. telling me stuffs brand new when i bought cases of it 4 months earlier. get a fresh bottle and you won't be dissapointed. stay away from c. island in slippery rock unless you wanna be talk to like you don't know ne thing"
"O - Delicious hop bomb that loads up the palette with fresh citrus and pineapple hop flavours. This stuff is fantastic and is by no means underrated. I'm hopeful that this brew becomes a regular locally, because its certainly one of my favourites among the style."

"Pours a beautiful light amber with a massive head. On my second pour into the glass, I took as aggressive a pour as possible, and for a brief moment, there was literally ALL head in the glass. Woah. The nose has more going on than I can properly parse apart, but the bottle text hits me in the lane with an assist: pine, florals, grapefruit (rind!). Having been properly educated, I can detect these widely varying smells. The taste is equally complex: strong hop bitterness with the individual flavors rotating on a wonderful beer merry-go-round. The ride doesn't stop with the swallow, and really keeps going for quite a bit. Impressive. Not as sessionable with all the intensity of the bitterness, but certainly an important IPA experience. Keep this one spinning."
""
"A great IPA, and one of the more bitter examples you can find."
"Ultra hop bomb. Looks amazing... The thickest heaviest head i have ever seen. It clings in clumps on the side of the glass. This is one of the hoppiest beers i have had. Sticky, resenous, chewy. Super dry. Not much citrus. True to form ipa; less """drinkable""" than pliny, dryer than 90 minute, but still great."
"12oz, bottled on 2/4/13 and served into a pint glass. It pours clear light amber with a massive head.The nose is dominated by sticky resinous hops and pine. There is a subtle aroma of caramel malt, citrus, and other tropical fruit in there as well. The taste is of bitter pine and light notes of citrus and grapefruit. It is followed by a balanced caramel malt backbone. The mouthfeel is light to medium with perfect carbonation. This is exactly what i'm looking for in a West Coast IPA. Very bittersweet, not overly fruity, nicely balanced, and very smooth."
"Overall, a very good IPA. Glad that the LCBO brought in a fresh batch and hope it continues to do so!"
""
""
""
""
"O- Another big time IPA that hits all the right buttons for me."

"Overall - This is a good IPA, would definitely recommend to fans of bitter, citrus hops."
""
""
"O - This is an awesome beer. It has to big hop profile I want in a west coast IPA but is still very nicely balanced"
""
""
""
"Toasted malt quickly turns to herbal hop bitterness. Dank, resinous, and herbal hop flavors soar. Fruity malt with hints of caramel, cookie, and candy sweetness. Still, this beer is dominated by the hops and they steal the finish. Dry, with lots of lingering dankiness. Yum. Medium-full body with a thick, creamy feel. This is a great one."
"Definitely a worthy beer for the top 250. The finish just lays on the tongue forever with a more grapefruit quality showing in time. No unpleasant notes in this one. Lots of complexity and the flavors grow and change throughout the drink."
""
"O: Overall I thought the beer was nice, but it wasn't spectacular. The flavor was partially there, the scent was partially there, but it just didn't feel complete. It felt fairly mellow and I would have liked a bit more flavor and character to the beer."
"So glad to be getting this stuff here now."
""
"Pours dark amber, almost bronze. Heavy foamer, creamy looking. Lots to lace. Deep resin nose. Firm bitter taste, but oddly light hearted about it. Holds and resides on the tongue. Subtle sweetness contrasts. Smooth all around. A very efficient IPA. Never notice the 7% register."
""
""
""
""
"22 ounce bomber. Orange gold color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is fruity, sweet and citrusy. A medium bodied IPA. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are grapefruity, citrusy and floral. Medium bitter IPA. Nice balanced. Nice sweet malts. Good west coast IPA. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Really good IPA."
"For the sheckles, I think Ballast Point Sculpin IPA delivers a superior IPA if you are into the hoppier citrus nose and aftertaste more than the even balance of hop & malts. Based on the overall quality of the West Coast IPA, and the experienced palate of my hop mentor, I will give Green Flash Palate Wrecker a try and see if that one suits my taste more than their West Coast IPA."
"I think this is one of the better ways to really digest the beer and come up with its strong points as well as its weak points I am happy to say, that I loved this beer today as much as I did the first time I had it.."

"O: A very good IPA. I had this on tap during a happy hour earlier in the week and it was excellent. I thus bought a 4-pack to more critically taste and review, and I'm a little disappointed with the bottle. It's still a very good IPA, but the tap pour was outstanding."

"Nailed it."
"I'll start this review with a caveat that I may have just gotten an old or bad batch and am definitely open to giving this a re-review, but what I had seemed like a hot mess. Poured an unfiltered orange brown into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Lots of sediment floating around and lots of bubbles trickling up. Large off white head with good retention. Aroma was dank and resinous. I could definitely tell there was a lot of complexity in the taste and that it was a well-crafted beer. However, it wasn't terribly balanced and it seemed like the bitter and piney elements were at war with the sweeter malt characteristics instead of bringing the flavors together. I could appreciate the number of different things going on but this particular bottle didn't live up to my expectations."

"O: a very good IPA, floral fragrance is the best part, it is intensely bitter, hop lovers only please"
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: Drink up! it's good!"
"Mostly clear amber-orange pour with an off-white two finger head with great retention and crazy lacing. This is a hop bomb in every way. Huge hoppy, floral nose with tons of grapefruit, pine, and resin up front along with hints of tropical fruit, and perfume. The taste is complex and just as hoppy. Loads of bitter, resiny, mouth puckering goodness with hints of grapefruit, pine, fresh hops, orange peel, along with some subtle mango and apricot. The mouthfeel is thick and oily with a tangy, bitter, dry finish. With that said, there's just enough of a sweet caramel maltiness to add at least a measure of balance to this insanely bitter beer. Overall, this ranks right up there with all the elite hop bombs and truly lives up to its name."

"Mouth feel: More medium bodied and slightly fuller. Moderate carbonation. Mild hop derived astringency. Good alcohol strength and no burning sensation what soever."

"Strikingly dark orange, slightly hazy, sticky whipped cream head. Smells of pine, mellow caramel malt. Taste is phenomenal. Pine resin, grapefruit, floral and lightly minty hop flavors, nice weighty bitterness but all the same it's juicy due to a toffee-caramel malt backbone and so it dances on the palate. Medium heavy body, creamy and smooth. Finish is lightly bitter with interplay of grapefruit and mint notes. Complex presentation of hop flavors. Very, very good."

"Pours a deep golden with abundant amber highlights and a bit of orangish hues. Huge, fluffy bright white head. Exceptional retention and a large amount of lacing. Fantastic nose, citrus blossoms, pineapple, light grapefruit rind accents, and just a touch of pine. Pineapple and mango, herbal notes, balanced perfectly by slightly sweet bready malt, and finishes with gentle and pleasant grapefruit rind bitterness. Heavy light bodied, to very light medium bodied, smooth and sliky and moderately carbonated. This brew is exceptionally balanced in almost every aspect. A nearly flawless west coast-style IPA."

"Bitter but not a lot of complexity. Would be great with steak. Smells smoky. Appearance is dark amber but a little cloudy. Is a beer I could enjoy watching football or on date night with my wife. Enjoyed this beer at a bar but have never seen it at the grocery store. Great entry level beer."

"Poured from a bottle into a restaurant pint glass. Burnt orange appearance with 2 finger foamy head and nice lacing. Aroma is definitely hoppy with hints pepper, floral, and pine balanced against the citrus and grapefruit notes. Taste is excellent--combining the citrusy taste with the hops and malt. The finish is hoppy with a huge bitterness that lingers wonderfully. Not for everyone as some may not enjoy the bitterness, but I think it makes for a terrific finish. Medium body with good carbonation. Just a great balance for this style. Highly enjoyable."

"Bottle from Tipples. Pours hazy golden orange with thin head. Smell is strong. Hops, citrus, wet dog, more tropical and grapefruit hopsf. Taste is hop forward with malt backbone, lots of tropical citrus and floral grapefruit flavors. Lingering pale malt aftertaste to go with the bitter than hangs around in the palate, gives it a bit of sweetness. Mouthfeel is easy going with nice light tingly carbonation. Overall a very solid IPA."

"This is an aggressive IPA and I would say it rides the line between a regular and imperial IPA. Stays true to its roots and really does have that """west coast""" flavor profile to it. Hopheads rejoice!"

"O: So glad to taste this beer. Near perfect example of the style; employing that delicious hop resin hopheads like me can't resist. Definitely find this beer if you are a fan of West Coast IPAs, this one is no joke."

"O: This is one of my go to IPA's, and a classic example of the west coast style. Definitely satisfies a hop-heads craving for big citrus hops. This beer is a consistent presence in my beer fridge."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. Despite the characteristic bitterness of the hops, they maintained a great freshness and cleanliness, with robustness to the end. At no point were any of the bittering elements overwhelming, which is easy with such a strongly flavored beverage. We found the nose to be a bit subdued, but this did improve in depth with some warmth. This beer is excellent for the style, and surprisingly balanced for its geographical origin. This, my friends, is the definition of “West Coast IPA”, and the standard to be compared against."

"(4.0) D: Really enjoyed this IPA and glad I picked up a 4-pack. Very easy-to-drink and something I could easily have more of (i.e. drink all night)."
""
""
"Overall, this is one of the reasons I'm glad I live on the west coast. A fantastic example of west coast Ipa's. I can't wait to have this on tap again. Although on tap, it seems to be even more drinkable!"
"This IPA is kick ass. Superior lacing, pleasant hop aroma and a wonderfully balanced flavor profile. It's a smooth drinker - the sweetness is there but it isn't cloying or sticky; the hops are there but they aren't overly pungent. I really can't complain about this one."

"This beer is very representative of the style and is excellent. It pours a hazy light copper with a two finger head, good retention and lots of lacing. Smell is pine and bread. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying. Taste is pine and citrus, with a good deal of delicious bitterness on the finish. Love this one and it needs to be tried if it comes your way."

"A delicious beer, not a trace of the butteryness found in some other ipa's. An excellent example of the style."
"I purchased this beer on recommendation from the growler store's server. Being a bit of a hop head, I was looking forward to this one, and it is the first I have had from Green Flash. This beer is a great example of what a West Coast, extra hoppy IPA should taste like. I enjoyed it, and will revisit soon. I have been a Lagunitas fan for many years, and now I have become a Green Flash fan as well. I will now look for other Green Flash varieties."

"Overall- Being from the No - Coast Midwest, I have to give props to this West Coast IPA. It comes on strong with the bitterness and fantastic nose. It just needs to back it up with a just as extraordinary experience on the palate. This was a nice introduction to Green Flash!"

"O: The smell really ruined this one. I hope it was just a bad glass and not the beer because I remember liking this one. Maybe I'll complain to the restaurant that either someone with onions on their hands handled my beer, or the dishwasher isn't working as well as it should (it's a new restaurant so who knows). Very very strange..."
"If this is the only Green Flash brew that makes it out this way, I will be severely disappointed, yet happy that I was able to at least give one a try. This was one hoppy brew, and was well worth picking up, despite the higher price point (around $14 for a four pack). Stellar IPA."
"this is a huge ipa, totally saturated with rich oily hops. its got a wonderful nose of essential hop oils, resins, and other sticky goodness. there is some fruity notes to it beyond just the usual citrus. im picking up sweeter fruit, plums or apples even. it also has that pine pitch sappy nose to it that puts me somewhere in a pacific northwest old growth forest. its lovely really. the flavor is equally exciting. lots of bitter up front, lots of sweet at the end, with a surprising malt balance evening out the middle. the citrus fruit really comes out here, orange peel and grapefruit are the most prevalent. the finish is sweeter, very fresh. feel works well, with a bit more body than is standard, and a thick hop peanut butter taffy-like texture. this is a hophead's dream. affordable and strong and fantastic. one of the better green flash brews out."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a mostly clear polished copper color, one finger thick creamy off-white foam, dense spray of lace on the glass. Smell: floral, light grapefruit, spruce and earth beneath, with a toffee back. Taste: grapefruit, orange citrus, pine, caramel, biscuit. Big hop flavors. Creamy feel, medium bodied with palate coating bitterness and a slightly syrupy kick to the finish. Quite enjoyable. Bottled 8/13/2012."
""
""
"This brew poured a cloudy orange color with some sediment floating in it. The head was a full two fingers and pure white. It dissipated relatively quickly, leaving mild lacing on the glass. On the nose, I got lots of fresh hoppy goodness with some citrus as well. This smelled like something that I’m really going to like. On the first sip, I get some definite hops with grapefruit flavors, but more intense than I expected. It was also a bit on the oily side towards the end. Pine came up next. Hops definitely overwhelm the palate and the malt gets lost, which is totally fine by me. The moderate carbonation really went well with the flavors of the beer. The finish lingered for awhile with the sticky, grapefruit flavors. Also, the booze was really well hidden in the brew. I could put away a few of these without any problem. I would definitely have this again. This is a brew that really helped my hop head craving."
"Overall, I must say (as a hop-head) that the Green Flash Brewery continues to impress."

"Update: WOWZER. I'm getting through this thing and it is really, really bitter on the finish. Good for a hophead but if you see a noob or a malthead coming near this, turn them away!"
""
""
""
"Lightly hazed amber-orange colour, one finger of off white head, really good retention and some lace. Smell is a mix of citrusy pine and toasty malt, biscuit like, grapefruit and orange with a faint suggestion of alcohol. Taste is full of dry citrusy hops, mango, orange and grapefruit, big bitterness with a bit of malt toward the finish and a little warming alcohol. Light carbonation, medium body, thick and resinous at times, good mouthfeel. For an IPA that was nearly 4 months old to the day this was really good and probably stellar when fresh, so I will change my review upon a fresher bottle if need be but I would still drink one 4 months old."
"Overall a nice, refreshing beer. Really enjoyed this beer's appearance and aroma. The hops were nice and very noticeable but I enjoy a beer that is a bit more balanced with regards to sweetness. Would definitely try this one again later down the line. Cheers!"

"O: A clear 4.25 if that option existed. West Coast IPA is a style benchmark. A regular addition to my lineup since its merciful introduction into the Louisiana market."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: This really seems like it belongs in the same category as Stone Ruination. That said, this one is not nearly as close to the edge of “too hoppy” as the Ruination. There is a little more balance, making the West Coast IPA a bit more drinkable. A hop head’s dream, it pairs very nicely with Point Reyes Blue Cheese. The tangy and sweeter blue is the perfect complement to this brew."

"Tastes of wonderful tropical fruit, with juicy mango off set by well balanced hops bitter and sticky pine with grapefruit juice. BITTER finish. Malts carry flavors accross the palate and intigrate flavors but not domenant. Very slight alcohol preseant when warmed up."
""
""
"O: I always knew this was a good beer, but suffered through several old bottles due to a lack of bottle dating. When I slowed down for this review to really appreciated it, I realized how tremendous it really is when reasonably fresh."
""
""
"D - Excellent appearance and aroma... The taste and mouthfeel weren't quite what I was hoping for... The overall result is a slightly interesting American IPA... This is not something that I would drink with regularity..."
"OP - Very drinkable IPA but very bitter. Almost drinks like an Imperial. I will definitely be drinking this beer again, although it may not be my first choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with modest carbonation. Very smooth and easy to drink. Is somewhat sticky sweet, with a bit of bitterness at the end. Nicely balanced. This is a very nice beer, which I look forward to having again."

"O- Due to the influx of American IPA's, my personal belief is that some of these brews can become rather complacent in mimicking what has become immensely popular throughout the states. While this is a very nice beer it still left something to be desired on my end that had me searching from something else instead of all of what was purchased."
""
"Overall: this is an excellent beer and IPA. The flavor is just a little more bitter than I want but it mellows out as you drink this one and get used to it. Love to see this brewery in Jacksonville now."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle poured into Gouden Carolus chalice. Bottled on 8/10/12 I believe. Copper body with nice frothy head after vigorous pour. Nice retention. Soapy, sticky lacing. Aroma is piney, grassy and lemony. Fresh, crisp smell. Tongue coating mouthfeel. Taste is well balanced but leans towards bitter grapefruit. Really tasty and very highly drinkable."

"O - The trinity of San Diego IPA's along with Sculpin and Stone IPA. It does not disappoint and for those that love the style it is tru to form. Very enjoyable."
"Hazy amber/orange with a relatively short, bubbly off-white head. An abundance of fresh hops in the nose, along with some light citrus, lemon zest, smooth malt and rich barley. A wonderful aroma. Unexpectedly smooth start; with thick medley of fresh hops, bready malts and citrus. Body evens out and is exceptionally well-balanced with its solid foundation. Hoppy, midly bitter mouthfeel with a medium sized body. Fruity, bouncy, hoppy finish."
""
""
"feel of a pale, smell of a flowerpatch, great lacing atop a copper-gold body, residual bitterness, big pine, big citrus. BOOM. This is west coast IPA, it is drinkable, it is formidable, it is massively flavorful- fruity and strong. But it is balanced."

""
""
""
""
""
"O: this is a hearty IPA - and has a deepness and boldness that makes it more bitter but also fairly heavyweight. Not a beer for the meek - elements of it were reminiscent of Stone's """Bastard""" ales, IPA-style..."

"It pours with a gigantic white head, some lacings on the glass as the head dissipates. The body is a very cloudy amber. In the nose it's citrusy hops with a malt backbone. Very floral. The mouthfeel is the first thing that catches my attention as I drink this, it's medium-light bodied and feels nice. There's a hoppy bite in the aftertaste that lingers for a while. It has a very 'clear' taste, hard to describe, maybe I'll taste more as the beer warms up. A solid offering from Green Flash, this is a brewery to watch!"
"This has been a staple in the fridge for the past 5 years. This is one of my favorite IPAs. It is good in the bottle and great on draft. Solid appearance, awesome piny smell and taste and great light to medium mouthfeel. I am a big fan of this beer and used to get it quite a bit more when it was in the six pack format, but like to grab it once in a while when I want a good example of a big hop forward IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid IPA by the boys out west. Prefer draft over bottle, but this was still good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's interesting I had this offering a while back when it first came out and thought it was just ok, a rather above average ok. Having it now and much more impressed. Love the appearance of this baby. A somewhat light amber or yellow brown in color. Poured a half inch head which dissolved to a ring but the lacing hung around. The nose is a very malty sweet with hints of hops and grapefruit. I like the taste better. Begins with a malty forefront with the grapefruit hops dominating in the middle and ending the same way it began with a malty hoppy balance. The mouthfeel is a medium thick. Overall really diggin this one. Certainly will become a regular in my rotation."
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours hazy copper with a large, white head that dissipates slowly. There are some tiny bubbles that can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. Some lacing is left behind as the head dissipates. The aroma is of citrus hops and sweet malts. There's a bit of that piney hop aroma in there as well. It's such a nice, hop forward IPA despite having two months on it. Those piney and citrus hops really come through in the flavor. There's a nice sweet and bready malt backbone to this beer. It hits all the taste notes of a solid West Coast IPA. The alcohol is well hidden here. The body is medium to full with moderate carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is high. This is an excellent beer. I have yet to be disappointed by Green Flash."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bitter grapefruit and pine resin vie for dominance of your mouth. The initial hop punch lingers to the finish making it hard to detect the sweet mango and bready malt that is shrouded in the background. A big beer with a big hop punch - exciting flavor and mouthfeel. The alcohol is hidden as this is very drinkable."
""
"Pours a bronzey caramel with a huge khaki head. A sweet and fruity aroma filled with some malt, peach, tropical fruit, and just a touch of some pine. Flavor offers much more pine than the nose suggested, very little of the fruits the nose suggested, and a moderate amount of bitterness. A medium bodied, active moutfheel. Overall, alright brew. Not blown away or craving any more than this one bottle."
""
"Poured from bomber into perfect pint glass. Huge fluffy off-white head, at least 4 fingers at first. Lots of cling and retention. Amber/copper/burnt orange coloring. Smell consists of pine, floral and citrus hops, similar to taste, as advertised. Smell and taste is great. Mouthfeel is smooth with a slightly bitter but resinous/piney aftertaste. Very good beer. Have not had this for some time and was clearly missing out. A must try."
""
""
"Very solid IPA, glad this one is in Georgia now."
""
""
""
""
"I wish this was sold in 6 packs near me, then it would be a great go-to beer. $9.99 is reasonable for a 4 pack, I suppose. Anyway, I'd definitely recommend this for all the hop heads out there. For some reason, the first beer was better than the second one that I had. Either way, it's pretty enjoyable and drinkable on a hot summer's day. Not sure about the 100 rating the Bro's give it, but it's definitely in the 90's...a great beer!"

"Dark or burnt orange in color. Seems darker than most IPAs to me but that could just be poor lighting. Nice creamy sticky head. Sticky lace rims the glass. The nose is smacked with citrus and tropical aromas. I already love this beer and I haven't even tasted it yet. The hops wreck havock on the tastebuds in the best of ways. Citrus, grapefruit, lemonpeel, on a soft biscuit flavored malt. Sharp acidic finish with an oily mouthfeel. At an undetectalbe 7.3 % this one will sneak up on you. Great beer!"

"Pours a hazy, copper color. 1/4 inch head of a white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of floral hops, hops, hint of pine, slight sweet malt, and hint of wheat. Fits the style of an American IPA. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of citrus hops, slight sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hops, and a hint of pine. Overall, decent IPA, nothing outstanding."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is about as hopped-up as an IPA can be without crossing the line to Imperial IPA. It's not my favorite IPA since I find the hop notes to be very floral and pine-like without giving me any of the citrus notes I crave in an IPA (for me, the best IPAs have flavor profiles with lemon, grapefruit, peach, and sweet orange). Still, this beer would be appreciated by any hophead."
""

"O) This is good - the appearance and smell are outstanding and the taste is good, but just doesn't quite live up to the initial promise. This is my second try; I would gladly drink it again."

"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle and saw dark gold color with an active foaming. Smell was of grapefruit, grass, pine; eveything a grown man needs. Taste was a hops assault; lovely. Very fruity and piney with just the right amount of bitterness. Great IPA! Mouthfeel was deliciously refreshing as well. Will definitely be back for more."
"overall: I can see this being a favorite for beer geeks and i gotta admit, maybe i'm a philistine but prefer the hops to be a bit more balanced by other notes. Sure I dig hop monsters like Founders Devil Dancer but that guy has monster malt too."

"On the label it says """ taste it once remember it forever, that is the truth. Anytime I can get this I invest wisely and get a minimum of a case.

"This beauty pours a amber-gold color with tight foam. There’s a fantastically fresh and bountiful bouquet of fresh grapefruit with some piney resin rounding it out. Incredibly vivid flavor with all sorts of citrusy and piney tastes dancing across my tastebuds. Great bitter finish makes me want another sip. Fresh, crisp, hoppy—it’s everything I wanted and so much more. Splendid."

"O- An amazing west coast IPA with huge astringent notes and lots of hop flavors. Highly drinkable with lots of bitterness and hop sweetness."

"Green Flash Brewing Co. West Coast IPA, 22 oz. bomber: This is a beautiful beer when poured into a glass. The body is bronze with a tinge of red. The amount of sediment swirling around depends on how careful you are with the pour. A reasonable head forms on top. Time for the aroma! It’s big and all hops. If you like an aromatic IPA, this is your baby. The flavor is insanely hoppy. The malt does not come through the layer after layer of hop notes. The aftertaste is big and bitter. You really have to be IPA conditioned to handle this beer, it’s a real hop monster. An amazing experience, but I prefer a more refined IPA."
""
""
""
""
"Overall Impression: What left me wanting more of this beer is the finish, oh that long bitter finish...oh how I enjoyed it. 15 minutes after the beer is gone that bitter grapefuity finish still lingers. Bottle says 7.3 ABV, hardly noticeable. Solid, solid brew."

"medium body, slightly creamy, moderate carbonation, lots of beautiful lacing. this is a damn solid ipa, and in my opinion tastier than palate wrecker. even though it's slightly hazy, the head that this beer has is wonderful and creates an intense lacing situation."

"O- An awesome IPA, even before I tasted it I was quite taken by both the appearance and the aroma. Taste did not disappoint, very assertively flavored, but with good complexity and a degree of balance. Definitely one to seek out."

"O - Hoppy and no finesse. But, it's a good thing sometimes."

"O: well, ok west coast, this was a very good beer. Even though I'll end up giving this good ratings, next time I want this next to a really good East coast IPA and we'll see what happens. However, I will say I'm more impressed than I thought I would be."
""

"Bought a big bottle of this from Bevmo in Ontario, California. Poured into a Baird pint glass. A romantic white thick head sat on top of this mossy green/brown ale for the length of its life. Very murky beer with signs of alligator bubbles brewing up from the bottom, feeding the slight carbonation of the drink. The scent is amaaaazing... full of hops and flowers, and not much else. No fruity side to this... just straight hoppy beer. The taste is heaven served both cold and when warmed in the room. Overall, this is probably the greatest IPA i've ever had, and I see why Green Flash has earned its reputation. I will come back to this beer whenever I have a chance, and if you haven't checked out this San Diego legend, do yourself a favor."

"O-Best part of this beer is its aroma. That is pretty special. Personally I am not a huge fan of how the hops are deployed in this beer and others will certainly enjoy it more than me. Decent enough. Had it on tap in San Diego and now reviewing off a Bomber I brought back."
""
"O - Definitely a top tier American IPA. I like this offering loads more than the Palate Wrecker. It is easy drinking for the ABV and enjoyable thru the entire bottle. Would love to get this on tap and will seek it out if I can find it. With a better crispness and deeper flavor profile, this could easily challenge the big guns."
"Other than the substantial bitterness this one is surprisingly restrained."
"o- i haven't had an IPA this good in forever. this is great, great stuff."

"This is an excellent quaff. I have read reviews that claim this is not quite a """west coast ipa," but I feel they may have become too blinded by over hopped versions of that style which border on Imperial. This does not. The multi-hop mix polished the tongue and sides of the mouth on the way down with both bitter and grapefruit sense. The nose is pure hop, except a hint of caramel malt in the back ground which is delivered in the taste... could be just a tad more complex. The taste is all the hop necessary for the style, but a medium body w/caramel malt sense that SEEMS heavier due to probably a caramel 60 or more sense. It lingers. It seduces. Delightful."
""
"Overall: Good, and better than your average IPA, but not quite what I was expecting. Felt a bit more like a British IPA than a west-coast."

"Overall this is simply marvelous! Glad I bought a bunch of this..."

"O-Guess what Awesome!!!!"

"O: A great, strong, hop-heavy IPA with a lot going on."
""
""

"can not say enough about this beer , just starting to get this beer here in maine, smells citrus and hoppy, smooth real balanced taste, try the palate wreaker, little more of a bitter taste with the sister beer, will have this beer again,keep this one in your frig."

"West Coast India Pale Ale - The bottle says: “NA”"
"O: This beer is quite tasty and definitely one I would like to try again. This beer has an amazing smell and looks very inviting."

"I've been looking forward to trying this fresh, and definitely had it fresh yesterday. Looks the part of an American IPA: medium rust colored. Smells weedy, and a bit of citrus blend as well. This guy is a true hop monster. I don' recall having another beer that is quite so hop forward. Very little malt to balance, which is just fine with me. There is a lingering bitterness, leaving that grapefruit rind taste behind. If you are not afraid of a true """palate scorcher", seek this out...pronto!"
""
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable, drinkable, flavorful, smooth IPA. I will definitely have this again."
""
""
"O: A quality malty flavor that never crosses the line to boozy. It almost does, but it walks the line better than Johnny Cash. I've just grown so accustomed to these citrus bombs, which I enjoy so much, that this beer-drinking experience doesn't quite match that. Really good beer, though."

"Overall, one of the best IPA's I've had, if not one of the best beers I've ever tried. A hop heavy IPA for sure, but also one of the most well balanced with a great malt backbone, making for a great mouthfeel, body, and texture. Extremely tasty and drinkable, this is a fantastic beer."

"Copper colored, off white head, nose showed a bit of malt through the pine. Good lace down the glass. Bitterness hangs on but it is bettter balanced and maybe a bit maltier than many west coast IPAs. Drinks much easier than the ABV would indicate. Very good beer."

"A real standard for IPA. everything this style embodies with citrus fruit and bitter bite. cold drink all day."

"O/D - A decent IPA. Better on tap from my experience. Bitterness was a little rough. A little out of balance, having dank hops overpowering the malt body. Good, but not great."
""
""
""
"O- Complex and pleasing in equal amounts. Hop heads need to seek this out and make this a staple in their arsenal. Although I know I got this fresh, I am unhappy with the fact that their bottles do not possess a Bottled-On date (or at least a Best-By date)."
""
""
"Overall this is a solid, respectable IPA. I'm not blown away, but not disappointed either. I might change my tune if there were bottle-dating so I knew I had a fresh bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a creamy foamy head on a crisp golden straw/orangey color. Nice pine and sweet hop aroma. Taste is of chewey cottton candy-like, grapefruity/citrus intense pine hop. Really well balanced and full of flavors without blowing your palate. Nice IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"smells like a dry hopped brewery but the flavors are unbalanced in the hop direction, which wouldn’t always be bad, but its just a little too hoppy without having much, if any, malt foundation. gnawing bitterness in the finish makes it slightly less than satisfying. That all being said, the flavors are fresh tasting, the hops sharp and distinct, and the overall craftsmanship, pretty damn good."
"Draft beer in a pint glass. Pours a orange yellow with a 2 inch white head. Aroma is all tropical and citrus. Pine and caramel as well. Taste is very piney. Grapefruit and caramel are really present. Thin to medium Mouthfeel. Very well balanced and super quenching."
"From Hector to Hamlet in 355 ml."
""
"O: Have not been let down by Green Flash as of yet, they make great brews, and this one lives up to the hype."
""
"Another newcomer. Really amazing hop aroma, especially for a beer that travelled across the country. I'm loving the hops here. Malt character is present, enough. A bit too much carbonation for a perfect mouthfeel. Perhaps a bit of in-bottle fermentation creating this? Anyway, really liking this beer and am impressed by how it carried."

""
"Watery start with a drying middle and finish. Light to medium body. Effervescence is restrained but not absent. A very good brew and fortunately for me, not a hop monster as so many West Coast IPAs tend to be."
"O: glad we just got this in Nashville. Perfect timing for summer. Will buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The IBUs on this one are definitely on the high side but, for all the hopheads, it's definitely a treat."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, received in a beer of the month mix six pack from Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, Virginia, into a 14 oz """pint""" glass. Pours a little hazy dark copper color with a large white head with major staying power and nice lacing. Smells of citrus and light grain, very well balanced. Tastes of piney hops and sweeter malt, nice balance again for an IPA, with a hint of alcohol taste. Light to medium bodied that goes down fine with just enough bite, but with a little of a lingering taste of the alcohol. Overall, a very good IPA."
"O - Pretty delicious, will definitely be going to this from time to time during the summer months."
"Overall one of the best IPA's I've had but there are a few I consider to be better."

"Clear orange amber in the pint glass. Decent foam and carbonation. Nose of hops, resins, and more hops. Water chaser is indicated with this one. At Trio restaurant in Palm Springs (tasted 02/25/2012)."
""

""
""
"Oooh my, this is one nice west coast I.P.A. Pours a nice amber hue with foamy lacing. Smell isn't particularly complex, but taste is everything I love in this particular style: very citric and hoppy. It's a bit more expensive than my other favorite I.P.A.'s, but I'm really glad I picked up this four-pack..."
"O - Impressive IPA. Good drinkability, great flavor and balance."
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium red-orange amber. One finger fine white head with good retention and nice lacing. Medium, almost creamy bodied. Aromatic and piney hops up front with sweet malt to balance. Hops, citrus, some pine in the finish. Finish is somewhat astringent. Otherwise, a nice flavor progression and balance. Nicely made."
"O- one of my favs for the style, beautiful hop aroma and flavor, great drinkability, I could drink these all day..."
""
""
"Good in class if only the taste was as food as look 'n' smell. Better by end of bottle as it evens itself out"

"O- So good. The smell absolutely blew me away on this dude. The aroma was executed perfectly. The flavor is dialed in. This is just an amazing West Coast IPA. Can't say enough about this beer."

"O: I love this beer; it really is one of the better American IPAs and surprisingly underrated"
""
""
"overall outstanding."
""
"This is a pretty darn good IPA."
"Purchased the day it became available in the state. I think I actually paced while waiting for it to cool and my patience ran out. Poured at around 55 degrees into a pint glass. Oh my, what a fluffy little pillow of white head, and the smell is amazing. Piny floral citrus-y hoppy goodness. The color in the glass is a honey amber and I swear it almost glows. I couldn't wait to pop the top but I find myself just staring at the beer in the glass, marveling at how clear and radiant it is, like liquid sunlight. Finally, the first sip. Grapefruit tartness, pine dryness, and just a hint of earthy/fruit sweetness to balance the green bitterness - overall very balanced considering it's all hops, all the time. Finishes dry and slightly bitter. As I sip, and it's hard to sip - this is a Very Drinkable beer and I would have no clue as to the 7.3 ABV based on taste alone - the glass is nicely striated with strong lacing and remains pleasantly fragrant all the way to the end. IPAs are one of my favorite styles and this might just be my new favorite IPA. Thank you, San Diego!"
""
""
"Medium to medium-light bodied with a slight bit of wateriness around the edges. Carbonation is moderate, creating a gently flowing beer across the palate."
""
""
"Enjoy!"

""

""
""
"A delicious and satisfying brew."
""
"I really like this beer. It falls in my top 5 (and I lean toward this style). I recommend this beer highly."
""
""
""
"O- This beer was definitely good for an IPA. It definitely had a generous amount of hops and had a nice piney taste. The alcohol was definitely well hidden and the beer was easily drinkable. It definitely had a distinctive west coast piney taste. The only thing I didn't like about this beer was that it wasn't sweet enough. I usually like a sweet grapefruit citrus taste with my IPAs to go along with the piney taste however I know this probably wasn't intended in this style of beer."
""
"Benchmark IPA from the west coast when it comes to bitterness, tonnes of it. Flavoursome, intense and does what it says. Plenty of fun if you are keen on a super-hopped IPA."
""
"O-an excellent IPA with nice flavor and balance"
"The beer pours a rich amber with no head. Modest hop aroma with sweet malt and almost no alcohol. The taste is booming hops with a little sweetness from the malt to follow. Relatively smooth and balanced towards the end, quite enjoyable. This is really an IPA you can drink 20oz of, I would recommend it to west coast IPA lovers."
"Carries the 'west coast' label for a reason. A very solid IPA. Personally, I prefer a little more tropical fruit in my IPA, but I can't knock this for any reason."
""
""
"Overall this is a quintessential West Coast IPA as one would hope. Think I prefer Hopsickle though, more integration and I prefer its slightly higher malt sweetness."
""
"O: Sometimes beers don't live up to their hypes, but this one actually manages to meet and exceed expectations."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is a tad on the thick side, but not too bad."
""
""
"O: A very well-balanced IPA with strong notes of grapefruit. Excellent crisp floral finish that does not leave the palate completely dominated by hops. I would definitely get this one again and I am very happy that it is showing up on draft at more and more locations in North Carolina. Paired very well with the spicy Cajun chicken wings I ordered."
"The smell and taste are just right - very floral. A great brew."
""
""
""
"Like catching up with an old best friend, that's how I feel about GFWCIPA, with so much world class brew here in So Cal. I often overlook this classic. Poured into my Boulevard tulip this brew is amazing to look at, bright orange with darker amber edges. The head is a beautiful thick creamy two inch cap that stays on the sides throughout the drink. The nose is biting grapefruit rind, hops, and fresh pine, very nice. The flavor follows with bitter citrus and explosive hops that refresh and entice another quaff. The mouth is brilliant, great carbonation, bone dry and clean, the finish is quite impressive as well. Glad I grabbed a four pack and re-acquainted myself with a long time fave."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent beer I will seek out again!"
"O - A good IPA, but not the best, nothing really wowed me about this beer, but I will buy it again."
""
""
"Pours clear light orange with a 1 inch foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is a total hop bomb: herbal, floral, citrus zest. Taste is also all about the hops with citrus zest and herbal/floral hop flavors battling for dominance. There is a somewhat assertive hop bitterness that lingers on the palate long after each sip. Unfortunately, this beer was flat as hell and that made it a bit of a chore to drink. Overall, this is a good IPA that blasts your nose and mouth with hops of all kinds."
"Medium bodied with great carbonation, this beer is a treat to drink. The body is just heavy enough to allow the flavors to really impact the palate while never becoming sticky. The carbonation is a little fizzy but definitely helps to keep the body enjoyable and the finish crisp."
""
""
"O - I picked this up after hearing good things. I enjoy very hoppy IPA's and this is just that. The alcohol isn't present at all and the citrus comes across beautifully. It was a bit pricey for a four pack but I plan to get it again when I need a West Coast IPA fix."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really, really nice!"
"Not quite a hop bomb, but close to that mark. Big hoppy aroma with warm herbal notes. Hops kick in right from the start, with a dual pine rosin and bitter citrus character. Solid amber malt with the barest touch of toastyness. The high abv is surprising, as there is no raw or hot alcohol flavor. Very well done."
""
"Taste is sharp, even bitter, with tons of heavy-duty grapefruit hops. Definitely a bold hop bomb for hop-heads. Every IPA fan should give this one a try, as it's a monster (and """only""" 7.3% AV -- not even a double or Imperial IPA)!"
""
""
""
"O - Wow, another damn good west coast IPA. Very happy that Green Flash will be distributing to Georgia very soon. It wil be a regular purchase. If you are a hophead, get this beer if you can..."
"DOA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great IPA. First bottle didn't blow me away but the 2nd time when I poured it carefully, the flavors really came out and didn't get trapped in the head. I never thought a pour would make this much of a difference but it made this beer much better. Maybe I'm just crazy."
"Wow this beer definately gets some good reviews thats for sure maybe i should of bought more anyway it pours a dark orange hue which leaves a creamy two finger head and some nice lacing an impressive looking drop,the smell is an explosion of tropical fruit,pine,citrus and fresh flowers in bloom,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with a touch of stickiness about it and has tastes of tropical punch,grapefruit,orange zest,lychee,finger limes,marmalade with a slight touch of toffee maltiness slipping in between the hop explosion of fruitiness to settle the bitterness just a touch and overall a very nice AIPA that i would drink again cheers."

"Solid beer."

"Overall this rates pretty high. While it's not Vinnies Pliny it is still a very nice IPA from San Diego. Good job Green Flash."
"Whew! I need to be in the mood for a beer like this. IPA's certainly vary a lot from one to the other, and this is probably the most bitter standard IPA I can think of."
""
""
""
"O: West Coast IPA all the way. Fruity and floral hops are the name of the game here."
"This is a hop assault best experienced fresh. I've had DIPAs that were less hoppy than this bomb. It's definitely worth a try, but it's arguably a little too intense for daily consumption."

"This pours a nice copper-red color with a huge, chunky head. The aroma is huge with massive amounts of hops and grapefruit. Delicious. And the taste is just about exactly how I like my IPAs. Huge, dank, resiny hop presence with a citrus backbone. A slight bready malt presence leads to a great, coating hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is solid, nothing stunning but doesn't hamper the brew, and the drinkability is excellent. I'm so glad that I can get Green Flash in Tampa now, this is an absolutely top-tier IPA, and very affordable compared to 8 dollar Sculpin bombers."

"O - One of my favorite IPAs, I'd suggest it to anyone who loves IPAs, an aspiring beer aficionado, or willing to branch out to something new."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a dry and bitter IPA. It doesn't have enough hop flavor in my opinion, either. It's certainly not bad, but I'm honestly not a huge fan."
"O: This is another excellent American IPA. Beers like this serve to remind one of why Green Flash is so critically acclaimed. A must try for any IPA enthusiast."
""
""
"Wasn't quite what I expected out of this beer, the hop profile was pine resin and earthy but still will make a hop head happy, I appreciated the general mouthfeel. Not exactly the most artful brew, it seems like alot of great hops and flavors were thrown against the wall to make this brew. Fortunately most of them stuck."
""
""
""
""
"O - Decent IPA but far from one of my favorites. This one is very much on the bitter grapefruit and pine aspects and much less of the citrus variety. This one starts out a bit harsh but grows on you as you drink it."
""
""
""
""
"Taste-West Coast hops all the way-juicy, piney, citrussy, tropical fruit. Balanced nicely with brown sugar toasted malt. Tasty, snappy and deliscious offering that is an absolute must for all hopheads. Get some!!"

"O: Well, I'm kinda pissed that I dropped $11 on a 4-pack. I've been waiting and waiting to try this beer because it gets good reviews. Well, Green Flash. You burned me. I won't be going back to this IPA until you start putting freshness dates on the bottle."

"Pours orange-amber with a nice frothy head that sticks around and leaves a lot of lacing. Smells really piney for a west coast IPA with some orange notes in there. The taste is very piney and resinous with some orange citrus in the background. The orange comes out a lot more as you sip on it a little. This is an awesome IPA but thats not a surprise considering that its Green Flash."

"Poured the classic reddish-brown body w/ two-finger white head that dies slow and leaves lace patches. Very floral/piney/citric aroma, and I think a touch of grape which I usually detect in only DIPAs, and some oakey and sweet caramel malt. Body is the same as it's medium-to-heavy, has a good smooth, almost creaminess to it, the bread and sweet malts are nice complements as they are underneath a powerful citric and floral hop punch that leaves a lingering crisp finish and it tastes like some grape notes on the finsh as well. Good ABV for an IPA that wasn't a hop bomb and didn't overpower my tastebuds/retained a nice balance. Classic IPA that you can always fall back on."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely for hop lovers though. Quite a blend of immense flavors and drinks quite big for an ipa."
""
""
""
"overall, a very nice IPA. while there is a malt presence, make no mistake this one showcases an array of hops, both first and foremost. quite enjoyable. only caveat here is that these tend to hang around a while, and freshness is paramount."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light-medium bodied with a low amount of carbonation. A bit prickly and not particularly smooth drinking. Not bad all in all, but definitely not what I would call a world class IPA."
"Quite bitter with a huge hop flavor... quite nice. Long lingering bitterness, with a passing attmpt to balance with a touch of malty sweetness. A true west coast IPA. I've had this in bottles, but fresh from a keg seems to accentuate the potent hop flavors. Excellent."

"Well, other than the aroma (I'm pretty sure that I don't have a head cold and it was poured into a glass), this is an excellent IPA for the hop lovers out there. Not as aggressively hopped as I thought."

"Green Flash West Coast IPA is a delicious, bitter, fruity IPA with strong aromatic citrus flavors. I'd compare this beer to the Firestone Union jack in that it has a deeply enjoyable bitterness balanced well with mainly grapefruit and other citrus. At 7.3 percent alcohol, the west coast IPA is a beer you could drink more than one at a time, and at about $8-9 for a 4 pack, it won't break the bank. Overall, a surprisingly enjoyable beer and another standout California IPA."

"I love citrus and tropical fruit hop flavors and this beer is full of them. Excellent."
"Pours a clear orange with hop particles throughout. medium off-white head. Smell is resinous piney hops. Taste is an initial sugar sweetness, followed by some intense herbal, piney, dank hops. A hint of bread in there, but this is a beer about the hops. Mouthfeel is rich, low carbonation. Overall an Excellent IPA, tons of hop flavor here."

"This beer is a beautiful golden orange color, and a bit cloudy. Nice head with good retention. The aroma suggests that this is a top tier IPA with that exceptionally bright floral aroma. The taste follows the aroma with delightfully bitter citrus and grapefruit hop flavors in the forefront with a light breadiness and slight caramel notes as well. very drinkable and balanced for a 7.3 ABV. I would say this is the second or third best American IPA I've ever had!"

""
""
""

"12 oz bottle (thanks Samp01). Pours copper with a thick, white, never ending head. Wonderful aroma is of citrusy hops, caramel malt and ripe fruit. Taste is similar, very bitter grapefruit hops, balanced by caramel malt and fruity notes. Light, tangy body. Enormously hoppy finish. This brew is a dream for hopheads."
""

"Pretty drinkable. The ABV is noticed only at the end. Balance makes this much more drinkable than many other IPAs I have tried. Will definitely come back to this one."

"Pours a hazy dark amber with a large long lasting tan head, with very good lacing and head retention throughout to the end. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, some nice earthy piney hops, some hints of dark fruit, raisins. Taste is a nice rich sweet caramel malt with some good earthy piney hops. A nice full bodied creamy texture on the palate with moderate carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt some dark fruit, raisins followed by some earthy piney resiny hops bitterness. Nice hoppy bite with moderate carbonation makes it easy to drink. Overall a very good tasty and balanced IPA"

"3.5 D: It's good, but it doesn't really impress me that much. This beer seems to have outlived it's reputation."

"under carbonated. great finish on first sip i had thought it was maybe a little too old. i dunno if that's the case as the age isn't on the bottle. enjoyable, but there are other ipas i prefer"

"This beer pours a slightly hazy amber with a thin head and lacing to the end. The aroma is fruity, with hints of pine and sweet malt. The flavor is citrus fruit, mainly grapefruit with pine, grass, and toffee notes. The mouthfeel is meedium and slightly dry. Green Flash West Coast IPA is a good beer, a good match for chicken burritos. Recommended."

"O: This is a very good American IPA. I can't believe it took me this long to try this, but I'm glad I did now. This has quickly become one of my favorite IPA's."
"Overall (4.5): Truly outstanding IPA. West Coast to a “t,” and we’re all better for it. I don’t believe in West Coast supremacy, but this kind of beer makes a strong case. Green Flash, date your bottles and I’d buy you every week if I could."
"Pours a hazy dark copper, much darker then I have become used to in a IPA, has a nice off white sticky head that hangs around. The nose is citrus, pine and grass with a nice malty background. The taste follows suite to the nose with the citrus and pine as well as the balanced maltiness and a bit of spiciness. Medium bodied with a good cling in the mouth, well carbed. It's a good IPA and definitly fits the West Coast description."
"O/D-Love it on-tap or in a bottle. But via cask this beer is truly awesome. Great beer especially casked."
"O: good but I don't see why people think it's SO great."
"The taste reminds me of furious but bitter. Full of hops citrus floral flavors but the taste dramatically turns to a full on bitter. Hrm. This beer is confusing the flavors don't mix well each ok on their own but fruity hops the earth bitterness don't meld for me not to say its bad just not for me"
"Good smooth mouthfeel, I have to say, 1 bottle is enough for me."
"Taste is exactly what you would think you would get from the nose. Very aggressive citrus. Bitterness is immediate. Lots of citrus with subtle pine. Nice IPA. Hoppiness lingers."
"O: a nice brew pretty much what i expect and what i like from ipas, not the best but its still a solid brew"
"O. Solid stand by IPA of mine for the last 10 years. It is sad to see the price keeps climbing on this brew. Also the bottles, although nice, seem a bit excessive. An empty bottle weighs 4x more then an average empty bottle, which to me seems like a waste of natural resources and an unnecessary expense being passed on to the consumer in the end."
"Nothing unusual but maybe near the top of west coast IPAs?"
"Maybe in the long run it will be a bit boring, but it is clean and balanced."
"Overall this is a great beer if IPA is your thing. For the sake of variety I would Drink this beer again, that is if simcoe is still affordable enough over the next few years."
"Highly recommended for all hop-heads; a must-try."
"With 95 IBUs, this beer really blew me away. I have had it once before, but I forgot how potent it was; that said, I enjoy a solid but slow-drinking beer, and this fit the bill nicely for me. The initial punch it packs, as I said, is quite strong - stronger than most IPAs I have - but I still really enjoyed it, all the subtle flavours. I would definitely have it again. Gotta love all the hoppy things that come from the West Coast; it's a good thing I'm such an IPA fan."
"pours a crystal clear light copper/ amber color with a three finger off white head. head was thick and sudsy and after a couple minutes recedes to a small cap with loads of chunky lacing stuck to the glass. smells of pine and juniper with a little sweet citrus in the background. the taste is opposite of smell, i pick up on the citrus first with the pine lingering around. mouthfeel is a medium body with good carbonation and a dry bitter finish. overall this is a good ipa if you like pine. it also has a very wet/juicy body before the dry sets in."
"I picked this up in the tickers BIF, nice orange pour with a beutiful, sticky white head. Nice aroma full of pine and sweet citrus. A very juicy IPA, the grapefruit really shines, hints of pine and tropical fruit. The carbonation is good, sticky mouthfeel, smooth. A damn fine IPA, great example."
"O - Still one of my favorite west coast IPA's but not one I could drink daily. It is just too big of a beer for that but when I am looking for an intense hop bomb this is the first beer I look for."
"Overall: Great IPA and one of my favorites, hard to pass up a fresh keg of bottle."
"Overall it's a pretty darn good beer. Exactly what you'd expect from a west coast IPA."
"o - overall a decent ipa. I wouldn't go nuts for this one and with so many ipa choices this one falls a bot short, but enjoyable none-the-less."
"Overall, everything you could ask for in a single I.P.A."
"The flavor is that of resiny and piney hops up front, tastes a bit like it smells, then you are hit with the citrus notes in the middle, and some bitterness on the finish. Excellent balance to a great tasting and great smelling IPA. Wow. This is my favorite IPA so far."
"Overall, a great ipa that is well rounded and quite balanced. Tasty as well!"
"West Coast IPA pours our a clear tangerine in color with a fluffy white head on top. The aroma really highlights the West coast American IPA style with waves of grassy, piney, and citrus hop notes. The taste of the beer is deeply hoppy, especially on the swallow. During the drink, there's nice malt profile to keep the heavy hopping in check. The swallow leaves your tongue heavily covered in resinous hop oils, so I wouldn't recommend starting with this beer at the beginning of a drinking session. Overall, this is a nicely hopped beer that hop-heads in St Louis are excited to finally have access too. Given the higher ABV (7.3%), this would be a dangerous beer to have a few of unless you have a ride home."
"If you are a hop lover, this is the go-to ale for you! Cheers!"
"O - Delicious and thirst-quenching. Hop lovers will bask in the multiple """shades""" of hops in this brew."
"I'm thinking perhaps I got a bad barrel, but I will likely never know as I won't be giving this another try from the tap."
"Overall, a great IPA and one of my go-to readily available IPAs."
"O - Beautiful AIPA! I love how they clearly went both for hop flavor as well as hop bitterness. Too many AIPA skimp on the early hops and focus on the late hops. The bitterness adds a bite that really helps to elevate this beer to something better than a typical AIPA."
"An excellent IPA, one I would love to try even fresher."
"O: A decent enough beer. I would like to try it a little fresher, but I wouldn't turn it down in the future."
"Pretty straight forward ipa here. Perfectly transparent and orange/amber, tight puffy carb and lots and lots of lacing. The aroma just doesn't pop enough for me but what is there is resinous and piney. My taste buds tingle with a clear pine flavor, resin like hops, backed up by some malty full bodied chew. This is a rather chewy ipa. Bitter on the back end and finish I suspect this is not the freshest speciman, but its pretty good."
"The drinkability is great. The recipe is nice and balanced. It isn't anything new in terms of flavor but everything hits the right note. A great example of the style."
"O) Nice... Paired this with some Thai takeout, and it went really well. I would gladly drink this on a regular basis if it were available in these parts."
"D: man this thing is tasty. a bright floral, tropical hop aroma and flavor that are very well balanced by a tasty bready/oat flavor. glad we get this stuff in VA, even if it is sparingly."
"This beer is the quintessential West Coast IPA; the name says it all. It's perfect."
"Cheers"
"Truthfully, I was expecting more from this beer. It could be a less-than-fresh bottle perhaps, but I can think of at least 10 other IPA's that I enjoy more. Still, I wouldn't turn this away by any means."
"O-A classic West Coast IPA."
"I think it's one of the good examples of what you can expect out of an IPA. It wasn't overly bitter nor underwhelming with the hops. It really masks the alcohol pretty well, and it has everything else going for it."
"Dr: Drinkable for the ABV, but comprised of low quality flavours that turn me away. I won't be having this again."
"Light to medium body with a nice refreshing amount of small active and lightly prickly carbonation help prevent the tongue from being overwhelmed with bitterness. There is a touch of alcohol warmth in the throat, but not enough to make it hard to drink. A solid beer, though not as flavorful as some of the other west coast IPA's."
"Overall I think this is named perfectly. The West Coast is where you are going to find most of the IPA's that ruin the palate this way. Quite enjoyable and a must seek out for any IPA fan!!"
"O: An IPA that is almost reminiscent of some American Strong Ales due to the malt, bitterness, and lack of sweetness."
"I enjoyed this. I have a feeling it's not super, super fresh though. Lack of bottle dating strikes...minimally. I'd drink this again gladly. Regardless of age here, I know this is a stellar IPA."
"O: For the IPA addict in you. Such a great beer, i wish i could get this in FL"
"O- A great example of the style. Straight forward hoppy bitterness backed up by a subdued pale malt backbone. Insanely drinkable. I enjoy this every time I have it. Recommended."
"This beer pours a nice yellow to almost orange color with a big white head and some lacing around the glass. the head is fluffy. the smell is citrussy and floral. the flavor is juicy with the floral citrus notes and ends with a nice bitterness. the mouthfeel is fairly light and mouth watering. overall a very good ipa."
"Had this brew in bottle. New to Kansas and Missouri. A great new brewery to come along. Pours a light amber color. The hops take immediate effect on the nose. Floral and resinous. A nice dry sticky ale when drank and all the hop presence intensifies as the ale warms. A bit of a heavy brew as for the drinkability. An overall gret brew."
" The taste of West Coast IPA is very good with some nice zesty flavors -the hops have a sort of orange tase which is also herbal and mildly acidic grapefruit accent which brings to mind a tangelo as the combination of tangy sweet and bitter reverberate. I like the way the malt sweetness is subtle and it is a generally dry bitter combo with a nice acidity to bring you back for more. The spice accent is slightly peppery and adds dimension to the mildly dry finish. Overall I think this is a great beer, I think it pushes the alcohol and verges on an Imperial IPA with the bitterness level but it isn't too sweet so I would say it fits the style very well."
"Overall: The bitterness seemed a bit much and without much in the way of malt sweetness it just seemed to be a bit much. I've had this on tap a number of times and recall it being less bitter. Next time on tap, I'll have to finally review it. This is stll a nice WC beer"
"Overall: This was definitely made with the hop head in mind. I kept thinking about how good this one would taste if I were really Jonesin' for a bitter brew. While I gave lower marks for appearance, I would drink this one again (No real flaws with the taste.), and would recommend that you give it a shot."
"This beer will be in my fridge often. Mozol tov!"
"Overall, the flat wateriness got to me, though I loved the hop assault smell. Good beer, but I can't give it the high marks that others have. I'll revise if I have a different experience with another try. Unfortunately, I only bought a single, so that will have to wait."
"Overall, Not sure how old this was or if floaties are common in this , I still enjoyed it and would love to try a fresher bottle."
"O- Aggressively bitter but ultimately lacking the focus I expect from a west coast IPA. Something I doubt I'll revisit in this cutthroat IPA market. Much better coming out of California."
"At 7.3 ABV can't really have too many at a time...unfortunately. One of the best IPA's I've had this year. Highly recommended."
"O - Excellent IPA that borders on a DIPA. Will be having this again for sure"
"Overall: A great IPA. I don't think it's been over-hyped. Super bitter, lightly balanced. Satisfying."
"This pours a nice golden amber color with a large off white head with good lacing, there are also lots of large yeast dregs floating around. The smells are of hops and lots of them grapefruit, pine, and underneath I get some caramel malts. Body is medium. For an older IPA, this is still pretty hoppy not the super hoppy experience I had on tap but there are plenty of piney and grapefruit tastes in there, there is also a slightly sweeter / caramel flavor which I didn't notice with the overpowering hops while this was fresh. Overall the older bottle isn't up to the 2 week old on tap I had, but its still pretty tasty, even older this is better than many IPAs out there."
"It brings the hops, as you would expect with anything named West Coast IPAs. The actual hop profile reminds me of many Cali-based brewery IPAs. Good beer, wish it would have a bottled on date."
"O: Overall this is a good/very good IPA. Bottom line, it's too pricey. This is the first time i have seen it in my area and i wanted to revisit it after all the backlash on GF going to 4pks etc. and uping their pricing. If you like good IPA's i would recommend this for sure, i just think its way overpriced."
"Overall: this is a pretty tasty beer, although it emphasizes hop flavors which are lesser among my preferences. I would like to try this on tap to see if it is any different."
"O: I was really down on this beer after an old 4 pack, but boy have I been swayed by having this from a super fresh keg. This beer is really an IPA masterpiece. To me this is an IPA that borders between hoppy and malty, single and imperial , and sweet and sour, all in one."
"O: I found this quite enjoyable, overall, and it is sure to please those seeking the classic West coast IPA flavor. I found this one to be slightly one-dimensional, but it is definitely a quality craft brew. Pretty drinkable for the style, especially considering the strong hop presence and higher ABV. I probably wouldn't seek this one out again myself, but I wouldn't turn one down if offered. Cheers!"
"O: A good IPA. Not the hugest earthy hop fan but this one has a decent bitterness to it."
"West coast IPA's for the win once again. First time enjoying this beauty. Having it on tap at Capone's. Pours a beautiful hazy orange/copper color. A very unique look for an IPA. Finger's width head sticks around for a good while. Nose is citrusy and hop laden. First sip is just...all hops with a nice citrus finish. Minimal pine in this. The mouthfeel is a lingering bitterness. The citrus has staying power too. Awesome IPA. Welcome addition to our east coast lineup."
"Overall really good hopped up ipa, nice bitter."
"O/D: It's an enamel scrapper. Great in a bottle, fantastic on tap. I was lucky to experience it."
"This beer poured out as a orangey yellow color with a strong looking white head that sticks to the glass very nicely. The smell of the beer is a fruity, floral and piney. Very inviting aroma on this one. The taste is very good also, its loaded with the pine like grapefruit flavors that make these west coast IPA's so special. The mouthfeel of the brew is decent in my opinion. It is fairly light bodied, it goes down nice and easy, it leaves a great dry cotton mouth feeling after each sip. Overall it's a damn good brew, worth trying if you haven't already."
"overall I loved this beer..probably could only drink no more than two in a sitting...but a good brew...."
"Overall it's damn tasty and I will be revisiting this IPA again and again."
"I enjoyed this beer, not one I would actively trade for, but would appreciate it as an extra."
"Overall - Classic west-coast IPA. Nicely balanced with hops and malt characters... no disappointment here. Will definitely buy again and glad it's now distributed here in the Lou."
"O: Nice brew - would likely turn me drunk very quickly. I dig it."
"O: Average is generous"
"T: Pretty strong hop bite upfront with some pine and resin. A lot of sweetness behind it with caramel and honey. A slight bready/biscuity malt flavor as well. The finish is full of hop resin and leaves a lasting bitter taste."
"Overall, one of the best examples of a west coast IPA out there, hence the name. A little pricey at $12 a four pack, but that's my only real complaint, Cheers!"
"Let me say upfront that this is hands-down my favorite beer - out of the 800+ I've tried. If ever there was a great example of a west coast hop bomb it's this one. Served on tap at Flying Saucer Ft Worth with the requisite persistent head and lacing. Hop heavy aroma literally puts me in a daze. I wouldn't say it's balanced (damn hop-heavy) although the malt carries the amazing hop blend quite nicely. The resinous mix hangs in the mouth for an eternity while at the same time begs for the next sip. I've had plenty of IPA's including Pliny, etc - this one's the best as far as I'm concerned."
"O - Quite delicious IPA. Very hoppy and very flowery and resiny. OVerall a great beer to have an a great addition to the St. Louis beer scene."
"* OK this is a tie with Ruination, Guiness FES among others"
"I found this to be a little too bitter for my taste. I don't think I'd pick it up again among a decent selection of IPA but it's great stuff anyway, especially if you're a fan of intense, darkly bitter IPAs like Stone."
"Kind of disappointed with this one. Not awful, but the hop balance leans way too much toward pine and I'd have to imagine drinking several of these would be difficult."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Nice hazy deep copper-orange pour. Smallish but tenacious creamy/frothy off-whitehead. A little yeast floating around... a very active beer. Lots of grapefruit on the nose; floral. A little yeasty. Reminds me of Skull Coast Maelstrom. More grapefruit zest than Maelstrom. More malt/resiny backbone. Hope we keep getting more west coast brews over here. Yum."
"Mouthfeel was nice, maybe not enough bubbles for me. But lots of great body there. Overall a great hoppy beer and made for a great day with friends!"
"Overall this is a very solid IPA. Always a pleasure to have it in my tulip."
"O: I enjoyed this beer, it was recommended from a guy at Binny's, I don't know if I would rank this in the top 5 american IPA's I've had, but it's a nice change. Would be very nice on a very hot summer day."
"Cheers"
"O Good but not great. I enjoyed it though. Would definitely pick up another 4 pack."
"Pours hazy amber, cream color 1""" head, plentiful lacing. Aroma is very piney, resinous, powerful. Taste is big piney sweet pink grapefruit hop flavor with hard to find malts. If you enjoy lots of hops this is for you. I would have enjoyed some more malt presence. Unknown date but plenty of flavor indicates fairly fresh."
"O: In all respects except for mouthfeel this IPA seems much closer to a DIPA. I like it, but I find that I'm getting bored with the style and the traditional West Coast/dry/pine IPA."
"O- Not a huge fan of this IPA. Seems to be bitter just to be bitter. Would like a more citrus forward style IPA like a lot of the """West Coast""" IPA's."
"Green Flash West Coast IPA is, without question, a good version of the style. For me it's too one-sided, maybe it's my East Coast flavor preference."
"O - Overall, I really like this beer. Classic west coast IPA, very very bitter and dry but quite enjoyable. Good stuff."
"O - this is a very good ipa, a bit sweet more my taste."
"O: one of my favorite IPAs. Really think I've only had it from a tap or Growler."
"Aptly named, nice orange honey hazy body with a small lively head. Lots of nice leafy hops in the nose. Big grapefruit bitterness, caramel malt balance underneath. With a dry coarse hop finish. Medium bodied, medium to high carbonation. I sense this isn't freshly bottled. Very eager to try this when it's new. Well made. Refreshing, and quaffable. Great beer for sittin' on the porch in the summertime."
"O: A pretty solid DIPA but not my favorite. It's a little unpolished around the edges really. It just doesn't stack up against the greats of the style."
"A great IPA for those looking for a hop tongue-lashing."
"D-Overall this was a solid IPA. maybe a tad bit bitter at the begginning for some but overall very nice. I was hoping for some WOW factor to pop out on this one but there wasn't one. So still a good ipa but wont be getting it again unless it becomes local."
"Overall this is a very ipa, and probably even better closer to the source."
"Overall: This beer was exactly what I wanted it to be. A good IPA with a very nice hop profile. Definitely would have another."
"O: Good but not great. Some have called this a textbook West-Coast IPA, but I beg to differ. It's got as much or more in common with many I've had from Colorado and Michigan as it does with beers like Blind Pig, Sculpin or AleSmith IPA."
"O - No real faults to this one. It's a little bit 'catty', as beers with this much hop presence sometimes get. Great with spicy foods, etc though. Another really good IPA. Not in my 'favorite of all time""" category necassarily but certainly worth a re-purchase and maybe one of the better Summer day IPAs due to the lightness of the body of this beer."
"O: West Coast IPA is a good introduction to Green Flash, and at the very least, an enjoyable look into the local California spirit. It felt more like an amateur homebrew than anything, though, because of the unusual appearance, muted taste, and watery feel. I’m not putting it down a whole lot, though: hell, if I could homebrew anything like this, I’d be a happy man. All in all, it’s good beer that’s sitting on the edge of greatness. And if they ever flip the switch and tighten up some of the things they didn’t execute so well, you can be sure that I’ll be there with pride on my face and an IPA in my glass."
"Overall this is an awesome brew. I would liked to have some more sweet character in the taste and the smell as well as less sediment in the presentation but make no mistake this is a very good IPA."
"A wonderful IPA. Looking forward to trying it again."
"Overall, a very impressive beer that could be a session beer yet is a top shelf example of the style. I will keep my eye open for these guys and hope to try others. They obviously know what they are doing."
"Overall: Another very good beer that does not quite taste like any others that I have had before, and I am at a loss of how to accurately describe it. I wish Utah stocked this beer, I will seek this one out again. Not a good beer to introduce to any except the bravest of unwashed souls (BMC drinkers)."
"Overall - this is the epitome of a hop bomb IPA. if you don't enjoy hops then this isn't for you. i love it."
"O- i think it is exactly what the brewers intended it to be. not a beer that i am going to rush back to, but glad I tried it"
"O- well made IPA. Everything is good in this one."
"Oh the hoppiness. Those pine and citrus hops from the nose transfer directly into the taste of this one. It's incredibly hoppy and certainly bitter as hell, but the 95 IBUs that it claims to have on the bottle isn't overbearing or unpleasant in any way after the initial sip. Again the malt is hard to find in the taste, but this beer doesn't really hurt too much from the lack of balance. It finishes dry after a fairly clean, somewhat crisp mouthfeel. Superb example of an IPA, especially a west coast variety."
"O: a very well done IPA that is a pleasure to drink."
"Nice dry feel. Bites without the burn of resin or alcohol. Carbonation is good. Very nice"
"O: Love the raw hop flavor in this beer. A nice IPA, with minimal malt presence. Truly a west coast IPA."
"Overall - A hop bomb. Reminds me of Blind Pig. So hoppy and bitter that it's unbalanced, but that's what a West Coast IPA is."
"No doubt CA is the place for IPAs, although MN is close too :-)"
"Was lucky enough to find the case this four-pack came in so I could actually know the Bottling date. Turns out this bad boy is just a month old. Off to a good start. Pours a very murky, golden-amber color with a medium white head. Lots of floaties in this one. Scent is packed with tropical fruit and citrus aromas. Some mellow hoppiness as well. Taste is just outstanding. Immediately I get some nice pineapple and melon flavors, then followed by hop resin. Some bitterness comes into play, followed by grapefruit and more melon. Finishes with some piney notes and lovely hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is full bodied with some nice bite to it. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a monumental West-Coast/Cali IPA."
"12oz bottle. Pours a murky brownish dark amber color with an inch of head. Very little lacing. Strong aroma of pine and citrus. Hints of tropical fruits as well. The aroma of hops is fantastic. The flavor is very piney and floral. I didn't pick up on any floral qualities when I smelled it and now I'm not tasting much citrus. Very odd, but I'm not complaining since it's damn good. Nicely dry and oily. Pine bitterness at the end. Overall, this is a great IPA. Wish it was readily available in CT. Worth seeking out for sure."
"As you would expect, West Coast IPA provides the anticipated hop fix for the lupulin junkie; it offers all that is great with infamous 'west coast' brand of the style: a landslide of citric hops, an inundation of bitterness, plenty of enjoyment and... nothing much else. What else is needed? For """hop heads""" this combination of pale malts and Jesus is all that's necessary."
"Overall: Great IPA. Love it a lot and would recommend."
"Overall: Good flavor with a nice lip-smacking bitterness that never comes off as abrasive. Try this IPA!"
"anyone know when this brew will be on tap in the boston area? apparently i have to write at least 250 """characters""" here - i keep looking up area places to see if they have it listed as being on tap . . . but no luck . . .SO FAR . . . . . . . . ."
"Coppery amber with an airy custard colored head that leaves some crusty lace on the glass. The aroma tells me two things..number one this bottle is very fresh, number two this beer smells like I stuck my nose in a bag of fresh hops on brew day. Fresh resinous hop aroma with pine sap, candied grapefruit peel and caramel slathered toast. I love this brew, it tastes exactly like what fresh mega-hoppy wort smells like when you cook up a fresh batch of homebrew. My homebrew has never been this good though. Simcoe and plenty of C-hops with a sticky caramel malt backbone that finishes long and a little bitter. Silky smooth with strong carbonation. Green Flash makes some good IPA."
"Slightly sticky and dry, it goes down smooth. The finish is very bitter and lingers appropriatly. Overall an excellent beer. I can't believe it took me so long to try this."
"Overall, I think this is everything an American IPA should be."
"D - One of my favorite West Coast IPAs. Not as bright citrus as a Port City Mongo but quite delicious."
"This is a great beer. I wish the place where I bought it was closer to where I live."
"Overall- I have had DIPAs with this much hop flavor. This is a great beer. I have had it before and liked it then but haven't had it in awhile. Too bad the price went up. Oh well. A Lagunitas Dogtown Pale or Sierra Nevada Torpedo would be a """poor mans""" West Coast IPA. 4.5/5"
"O: I like this beer and will continue to drink it for my hop fix. Good stuff."
"If you are looking for an IPA with lots of good, bitter flavor, you'd be hard pressed to find one better."
"O-- When I think IPA's I usually think this beer first or second. One of the best made in the US if Not the world. Can be quite a complex IPA and it can also be very one dimensional and aggressive. After Sculpin hard to find a better IPA. The more you drink it the more you learn from it. Not the most sessionable beer but outstanding all the way."
"O: This is a west coast IPA in every sense of the word. Bitter, bitter, and more bitter hops all throughout. Worth trying for the hardcore hophead. Malt lovers will want to avoid at all cost!"
"Definitely one of my favorite IPAs, and very exemplary of the style."
"O - Overall for me a bit too hoppy. Had I been into IPAs I think I would have loved this beer."
"Overall-I’m normally a hop fan, but maybe I’m getting old. This is a crushing blow of hops and while the force is impressive I didn’t enjoy this beer nearly as much as I hoped too. Will give it another try, but disappointed for now."
"Ending notes: This is the pinnacle of west coast IPAs. Very nice indeed. Very bitter, but not excessive (Does too bitter even exist?). I can't wait to get this again. Makes for a great hop blast. Not for the faint-hearted. Quite enjoyable."
"O: Well, this is a West Coast IPA and it gets the job done, but offers few surprises at the same time. Perhaps the caramel backbone is the difference maker, and it rounds this out to be one fine brew."
"Overall, tasty as hell and massively drinkable. In a sense it's almost one-dimensional, but it's a dimension so well mastered."
"I was very pleased with this beer, even a bit surprised. Very good if you can get it fresh. It's too bad they won't date their bottles. For that reason, I'm not sure when I will have this again."
"Solid through and through. For me this comes off as a well done, traditional AIPA. With that said, nothing really blew me away. If this is what a West Coast IPA should taste like, I'm glad I had this for I will use it as a point of comparison in the future. This is not my favorite IPA but it's well worth a try."
"O- this is one of my favorite American IPAs. It epitomizes the style and doesn't go overboard on the hops like so many IPAs do now. It's nice to find this on tap a few places in Tokyo. You can't go wrong with this IPA."
"GREAT BEER, CHECK IT OUT!"
"D: very high. Could drink this all day long. I love IPA. 5.0"
"O: As the name insinuates, this is a good example of a west coast IPA. Dangerously drinkable for 7.3% ABV, the alcohol is well hidden beneath the malt and bouquet of hops."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip. No freshness info. Pours a cloudy orange with two fingers of frothy foam and not a lot of carbonation. Nice lacing. Nose is quite sweet but still with a nice balance between a light malt and crisp, lively hops. Aromas of mango and orange. Full bodied and rich mouthfeel, but not syrupy. Carbo is too low. Super bitter palate! The fairly rich malt tries to cut the hopiness but, happily, to little or no avail. You can count all 95 IBUs in this one! Mostly grapefruit and pine flavors but the malt does tease out some lighter lemon zest and mango notes. It's been a while since I've had this and I don't remember liking this much but I will make a point to not go so long without having it again."
"Overall - This is a very well balanced beer that offers something for all the fans of IPAs. It has a nice fruity/juicy aspect but also a dry/pine flavour. I enjoyed it more on tap, but from the bottle was very tasty too."
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a slightly hazy orange with a one and a half finger bone white head that subsided to one finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine resin, and pine hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, pine, citrus hop, and pine hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. The flavor on this one was very hop forward and it lets you know that even upon first smelling it. The citrus aspect in the flavor is a nice touch as compared to being pine overload. This is definitely worth trying if you can find it on the shelves around you and you haven't before."
"Overall it's a great IPA. Probably a bit overpriced but I'd take another. :)"
"Overall - nice little trade with spinrsx, this was a fantastic beer! i will miss the flash in canada, so good!"
"O- A good IPA. I'm not convinced one of the top few IPA's out there, but it is still tasty enough for me to recommend it."
"O- Wow, this brew is an enigma to me. Heard wonderful things about it, and I love IPAs- but there was something about the fullness of the bitter edge here that just took away from all of the other attributes I expect in this style. Did I get a bad bottle? Who knows, but I did find myself saying """wow""" after each sip- more so in disappointment."
"Overall: The crazy Californians have done it again with this offering. It's a super good IPA and definitely exhibits what the region does, and does well; ultimately, I prefer something with a little bit more of a malt balance and sweeter/juicier hop-like flavors, but this one is solid no matter how you look at it. This would be a great summer beer that would be refreshing with its bitterness."
"I would agree with the hype of this beer, it is really good. Solid marks from me."
"I must say some super fresh West Coast is pretty unparralleled. A quintessential hop forward West Coast style IPA. Pretty much put GreenFlash on the map. One of my top 5 IPA's for sure."
"Overall this IPA was a good one and to me it falls in the category of nice and bitter versus the crisp and refreshing less bitter IPA selections."
"OA: Very, very nice brew."
"D: This one I'll probably enjoy again."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, and could stand to be fuller-bodied, but I quibble. Thanks to Binny's in Skokie: I got the last four pack in the store--there were three cases of the hop head red. So nice to have fresh West Coast for direct comparison."
"O: very nice West coast IPA! Prime example."
"O - A very good IPA and worth a try."
"Overall, a very solid IPA. Easy to drink, the hop flavors are fantastic, and the malt works in nicely. Highly recommended."
"Cheating as I drank this from the bottle. Drinking in its native environment...San Diego has such an awesome craft brew scene. Fresh citrus and floral hoppy aromas complemented by calimex food prefectly. The aggressive bitterness is not overwhelming, just full of socal flavor. Great stuff!"
"o - a great decent priced go-to IPA."
"My biggest personal beef with Green Flash West Coast IPA is its mouthfeel. It's perfectly medium-bodied, which to me (for my preferences) means that it is too thick and heavy. Most people, especially East Coast and Southern drinkers, won't have a problem. Overall, this is a very fine IPA. It reminds me a lot of Schlafly's AIPA, only slightly less good (even though my score for this beer is higher than what I rated Schlafly AIPA)."
"Overall - A fantastic beer and one of my favorite IPAs. IBU's might technically make it better fit into BJCP's definition of a IIPA, but it's session-ability makes it an IPA in my book (plus they make a fantastic """official""" IIPA) . Very crisp, tons of hop aroma and flavor with an kick up in the face bitterness backbone. I was lucky enough to have this in San Diego a few years ago on tap. If I were rating the draft version from San Diego, I would almost score it a perfect 5 on every aspect."
"O: Slamming bitter and piney, grapefruity IPA done right. Very enjoyable and sessionable."
"O - This one is crisp and refreshing and is a great representation of an American IPA. Definitely one I'll pick up next time I want a very hop forward beer."
"Overall. Good hoppy beer with enough ballance to enjoy more than one."
"Very easy to drink. Opened with a very pleasant aroma and finished with an equally appealing taste. I thought all ingredients were balanced very well. A more than solid IPA"
"This was an amazing beer that hid the 7% ABV very nicely."
"Appearance is a hazy orange with good sized off white head. Its` smell has quite a bit of hops, some grapefruit, and a candy sweetness. Taste has more of those hops, with some resin, bitterness and dryness in the end. MF is nearly full bodied, and a little sticky. Overall, this is a very good IPA. It was way too long since I tried it last."
"O:Representing the West Coast one pint at a time."
"O=Lived up to expectations, good IPA."
"Pours a dark orange with a frothy off white head. The smell is fruit and sweet, with a nice citrus hop aroma. Taste starts hoppy with a slighter bitterness going on. It moves to a heavy hop presence, then moves to a strong grapefruit aftertaste. A medium mouthfeel on a smooth and well balanced beer. This IPA had a unique and delicious flavor, definitely worth checking out."
"I've been wanting to try this one for awhile and was lucky to find bottles of it while recently in Chicago. This beer pours an apricot orange with a nice one finger, soapy creme colored head. It smells instantly of sharp pine, orange, and grapefruit. It tastes of sweet orange and bitter and sour grapefruit. It's really, really flavorful and tasty. It drinks very well and the alcohol isn't present at all. I really liked this one and would definitely recommend it."
"O: A west coast classic. A piney and superbly drinkable IPA."
"Overall-Good IPA, but wanted more citrus notes that I thought I would get. Definitely want to try a fresher one. Don't get me wrong, I can drink this beer all day, and will probably have a few more, but was hoping for a little more flavor."
"I was excited after reading the reviews of this beer and then spotting it at a store here in Cincinnati. Overrated. No balance. Very bitter. And I like hops, but there's gotta be something on the back end to compliment them. And the floral bouquet is a reflection of the one-sided flavor of the brew. Not worth the money, especially considering it comes in a 4-pack."
"D- I liked this much better on tap than the bottles I've had. While I could not drink a ton of it due to a a hefty body this hits the marks of an excellent IPA. A pint of this is fine for me."
"The mouthfeel is medium to thin, but not inappropriate. Rock solid brew. Could enjoy many of these."
"Would LOVE to persuade someone to get this on tap but in my area everyone is afraid it won't sell. Myself and a few friends would drink it up though!"
"Regardless of how you get it, Green Flash's West Coast IPA is a cornerstone of the style. Seek this out now - what are you waiting for?"
"I love this beer...and any respectable hophead would feel the same! Well done, Green Flash!"
"D- I think the next time I drink this it will have to be on tap somewhere."
"D - High ABV doens't really effect drinkability in my mind. Wanted another, had another, will have more. 4.5"
"D: Goes down easily and enjoyably for the whole glass; would love to pick this one up again if it wasn't so expensive after the recent price hike. Nonetheless, I'll probably convince myself to buy it again to see if it's even better without the protein floaties missing from the beer."
"This is a top notch west coast IPA and worth seeking out, even if you aren't a hop head."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body is slick and just shy of medium bodied. Nice oily texture to the hops making them linger and drying the beer out. The beer left my glass in a very rapid fashion. I could drink several of these in an evening and not get bored."
"12 oz into a pint glass. This is an extremely hoppy IPA, one of the hoppiest ever I think. This beer has so much hops it actually makes me sleepy. Quite a bite to it. One thing I can't figure out: this beer used to be $7.99 a 6 pack in regular bottles and now it's $8.99 per 4 pack in a very unique but still 12 oz bottle. Great beer, but that's quite a difference in value and will definitely affect my frequency of purchase."
"D- High"
"D-Great example of a West Coast IPA,as the name would indicate.Well balanced and highly drinkable."
"Pours a citrus juice-looking orange, with tons of stick on the head. Smell is glorious, just sweet and floral hops. Tastes excellent, big hop profile, grapefruit and pine resin predominate, which is non-destructive enough to enjoy the beer in its entirety. Easy to drink, and the 7.3% is about perfect."
"D - A fairly easy drink at 7.3%. This one is crisp and pretty refreshing and is recommended to fans of IPAs."
"I love this beer so very much. It is no doubt my favorite IPA. Lately I've grown a little tired of hoppy pale ales, but West Coast always rules. When fresh, and on tap or growler, this beer is just outrageously amazing."
"Drinkability - bitterness makes it thirst quenching and sweetness makes it palatable this is an awesome brew. If your idea of a great time is munching on some hop pellets you need to try this beer."
"best beer in a while!! what a surprise never heard of this one."
"The CPJ"
"Very enjoyable IPA. Great representation of the west coast. I'd drink this anytime, recommended!"
"D- easy to put down the whole 4-pak you really just want to keep drinking this one.. a solid ipa that is a must try"
"Got quite a kick of alcohol, but it drinks easily."
"D: enjoyable would love to have this mid summer. will buy again."
"Overall, this is a great IPA. It's not quite my cup of tea, but I think it's a very good example of the style."
"Holy hops, Batman! This beer is oozing hops. Grapefruit aromas and flavors flood the senses. Malt balance be damned. This is the definition of a west coast IPA. And even though I prefer a tad more balance, I have to say, this is delicious. Powerful astringency and moderate bitterness, yet very drinkable. The 7% is barely noticeable. I enjoyed the first enough to get a second. Even at a wallet draning $7 a clip. Highly recomended."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, I love this beer. One of my favorite IPA's and one I don't drink often enough. I love the hoppy flavors and it's tastes so fresh and juicy. One of the best IPA's around in my opinion."
"Awesome IPA, similar to Green Flash Imperial IPA except for the hop variety (C-hops rather than Amarillo/Nugget I believe)."
"I should check the hop schedule and choices just to be sure there isn't a """litmus test""" effect."
"Fairly medium-bodied with not much of a carbonated feel. Clean and easy to drink. 7.3% becomes evident after a completed bottle. Decent WC IPA."
"I could have another since it's easy drinking. It's not a bad IPA. Taste was a let down so I had to knock some points off. Overall, a good IPA."
"Just finished a bottle of Green Flash West Coast IPA that I purchased earlier today from Total Wine and More in Richmond. Not much of an IPA selection here in Tappahannock Virginia so I have to make an occasional beer run into """civilization""". I consider Bell's Two Hearted ale my favorite IPA, but...Green Flash is running a very close second. Bells better not stumble or Green Flash will take the lead. Upon smelling it the citrus grapefruiit aroma is excellent and the taste lives up to the smell. Very impressive IPA! Very pricey IPA too...but you get what you pay for. Won't let the cost keep me from picking up this excellent ale on my next trip."
"Pours a deep orange almost copper color with a huge foamy off white head and lots of carbonation. Aromas are dominated with floral hops and grapefruits. Sweet and piney at the same time. Quaff isn't as hoppy as some of the west coast IPA's but still very delicious. Plenty of sweet fruits with a subtle yet enjoyable bitter finish. A very smooth, easy-drinking IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and silky. Drinkability is great although the 7+ abv can sneak up on you. Great brew."
"An aptly-named effort from Green Flash, for the flavors of this beer epitomize to me the West Coast IPA. Lovely."
"D: For a beer that's over 7% ABV, this hides it's alcohol very well. However, for me, due to it's pine taste I probably won't have another of these and will instead trade them away. And considering it's about the same price per 12oz bottle as Hopslam, I'd have Hopslam all day and twice on Sundays over this. Oh well, you never know which IPAs you like until you try them, right?"
"If you feel like no IPA's are doing it for you and you want more bitterness or flavor drink this beer it will blow you away. It reminds me of the Stone ruination but with other strains of hops in there to create different dimensions of hop flavor. This beer in a nutshell is the perfect balance of hop strains you could ever have. The most popular descriptions of an IPA (grapefruit, pine, citrus, flowery, resinous, fruity) this beer has all of that in a unique balance with an amazing long bitter finish and not to mention some slight malty sweetness when it warms more."
"I think there's better IPAs out there than this that I would have instead."
"This is probably my favorite IPA (plus Stone IPA and DFH 90) and is a truly superb beer. I can get it on tap fairly frequently, making it a true joy!"
"An IPA with no remorse. A near lupulin overdose. If it were maybe 70-80 IBU, the drinkability and balance of the beer would be slightly improved."
"O - Although sharp on the palate, still a very good IPA!"
"D - Easy to drink. Aftertaste is a little bitter with a refreshing taste. Could easily drink more than one."
"Great beer! Soory it took so long for me to find it!"
"Surprisingly drinkable for a beer with such a strong hop flavor. Normally a beer with such bitter characteristics and this little balance is tougher to drink but this is an exception that is very enjoyable."
"Taste: The range of bitterness and hoppopoluza is stunning. Flavors include all of the typical citrus, grapefruit and pine descriptions; the real magic of the beer is in the harmony of the hops which combine to create a symphony appropriate of the name IPA."
"(Please not that my ranking for this beer was based on the initial bottle that I poured into a pint glass, leaving the sediment behind in the bottle. The second bottle with the sediment included was not nearly as agreeable and I'd probably give it a 2.7 overall.)"
"Very well-balanced IPA. If this was regularly available and affordably priced, this woule replace Laughing Dog IPA as my go-to for the style. As it is, I will definitely come back to this in the future."
"Good mouthfeel with medium body and well balanced carbonation. A really nice example of an American IPA."
"drinks so easily, this is definatly one of my favorite ipa's, i always get it when its around. its one of the more bitter ipas available IMHO."
"thanks to cduckett for the extra"
"A nice hop bomb in the true vein of the west coast IPA. Screw balance, all hail the hops!"
"M: Well done, carbonated well, retains head throughout the drink. Will definately drink again!"
"D- Good American IPA. I really enjoyed the interesting finish."
"I was told that that ThrashZone just brought in the Green Flash IPA fresh on the keg but pity I was unable to properly review this properly as I was hanging out with a group of fine beer folks."
"Drinkability is decent. The hoppiness could be a little better balanced with some more maltiness, but for a hop bomb it's definitely enjoyable. Could drink another, but I won't seek it out again."
"355 ml bottle, into tulip. Pours cloudy (indicating dry-hopping) orangeish body with thick, stable off-white head that sticks to the walls. Aroma is clean malty sweetness with spicy, earthy, floral, citrusy hops and fruitiness that might be ester or hop-derived. The flavor is spicy, earthy and grapefruity hops with some pungency, supported by solid backbone of clean malty sweetness. Dry finish with resinous bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste with a presence of oaken flavor which is inappropriate. Medium-light bodied with moderate yet still soft carbonation. The West Coast IPA, well, the brewer might not be a Master of his profession but he certainly knows the Geography well."
"D- Yes! The famed West Coast IPA will never tire out your palette. Paired with dried spicy salami."
"D - This has good drinkability, at a moderate pace. I like this beer a lot. It has a great hop presence, and it goes down easy. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting. Overall, I like it, and I would recommend trying it."
"Pours a good looking hazy orange with a three finger off-white head. Excellent lacing and retention all the way through. Aroma solid as well. Hints of tropical fruits, grapefruit and pine mix well together. A slight hint of the grapefruit hops to start, but quickly overpowered by a big pine hop rush. May be a freshness issue as the citrus hops were pretty well hidden. A little bit of a bready/caramel malt at the end, before a short lived pine bitterness to end the beer. Definitely a hop lovers IPA."
"Overall, another well displayed West Coast IPA....hence the name. Really solid stuff from a brewery I wasn't that aware of. Need to look at other brews from their house."
"last summer this was all i wanted - was like summer in a bottle... beautiful IPA... full of fragrance... hops hit you in the face but my god they go down so smooth but the taste lingers... sip this and swirl the glass to get keep that beautiful smell in the air... it is awesome. i usually only get one or two at a time - this is like a really good wine - two - or three will do ya. being in TX i can only get this during certain times of the year for some reason - when it came back this year it had new fancy bottles... whatever... i was glad to see it back..."
"My go-to beer during my bachelor party in Vegas. Usually drunk straight out of the bottle. When poured from 12 oz bottle, it is a pint glass. Bottle Pours a cloudy amber with a good off white head. The head is froathy and lasting. Produces some spotty lacing. Has a good hoppy aroma. I get citrus, oranges, some malts, and some pine. Has a decent carbonation. The mouthfeel is good. A good bitter hoppy flavor. The alcohol is hidden well. Has a clean crisp taste. The texture is very middle of the road. Has a medium body. Has a good finish with a good hoppy aftertaste."
"Had this before on tap - it was alright, but I wasn't too impressed. And, I'm still not impressed (and maybe less impressed). Something is just """off""" with the taste, and the excessive sediment is just a bit... unsettling. Other excellent beers have similar flavors, but here it just goes a bit too astringent and misses the other flavors, and falls down."
"Mouthfeel is superb, with just enough carbonation to keep it lively, but a smooth crisp texture that goes very well with the style. I don't really have any complaints with any part of this beer, as the drinkability is fantastic as well."
"Very good carbonation, medium body. Good drinkability but I probably wouldn't be pounding these back in a session."
"Wonderful IPA-- delivers on the big hop flavours and bitterness. Would love to be able to acquire this regularly."
"D - This is exactly what I expect an IPA to taste like in the West Coast style! Very nice hoppy citrus/pine taste without having too much of a malt presence in the taste. Very attractive aroma and appearance round out this beer. Overall, a great easy-go-to IPA."
"Poured gently, 1-finger head, reduces to nothing, lacing is a little runny, color is an amber orange with lots of sediment. Aroma is a wonderful fight between pine and citrusy hops, pine winning by a hair. Taste of hops is wonderful....fairly bitter, sticking to the palate and drying out my mouth. I heard a lot of hype about this beer, I'm just hoping this is as fresh as possible. Definitely a beer I'd love to stock in my fridge."
"D - Very nice West Coast IPA. Local brewery and bought fresh on re-stock day. Hard to tell freshness as I don't notice any dating on the bottles. Think this was $8.99/4-pack. Definitely a nice IPA that will be a go-to as long as it is fresh and available and doesn't get any higher in price. Pairs well with food."
"A mild to light mouthfeel, really crisp with mild carbonation. Despite the strong aftertaste, the beer doesn't stay with you that long. Hides the ABV really well, and I could definitely see myself getting in trouble with this beer at a BBQ."
"Overall: Excellent offering. This is a perfect rendition of a West Coast IPA with """in your face""" hop presence. The drinkability is off the chart and there is a pleasant lingering flavor. This one is near the top of my list for tasted American IPA's."
"D- This was a pretty decent brew but I would like to try one that I know is fresh and adjust my rating if needed."
"D - When I think of West Coast hop bomb, this beer will always come immediately to mind. This is a hop lovers dream. I prefer my IPAs a little bit more citrusy and sweet, but this was pretty damn good. Big thanks to poonamibaxter for giving me the chance to try this."
"Amber to copper in color with a slight haze from some floating particles. Thick cream-colored head, nice and bubbly. Great head retention with good lacing. Fruity, juicy hop aroma; lots of citrus and tropical fruit. Taste is equally hoppy, again great citrus and tropical flavors going on. Not much malt taste but a nice sweetness to it. Quite bitter but the sweetness does help to balance a bit. Nice medium body, slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall a very tasty, easy drinking IPA."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice big bubbly white head sits about an inch thick on top of a hazy dark straw colored body. Really good retention on this guy, the head sticks around for a while and leaves sticky soapy lace. Really a dry piney smell on this. Bitter hops through and through. Slight citrus aromas round it out with citrus peel and grapefruit with grassy aromas to really sum it all up. A little bit more of a subtle flavor than what the aroma leads on. However, this is really balanced with a prominent grassy hop flavor and a grape fruit finish. Really floral and earthy flavors on this one. The mouthfeel is light with sharp carbonation and a great hop flavor. At 7.3, I've been trained to think of this as kind of light. Nice and easy to drink, really a star."
"Drink- A very good IPA. Funny I bought a 4 pack for my buddy and he didnt even have one. OH DAMN! 4 for me."
"Well I must say this ranks up there as 1 of 2 ofmy all time IPA's now I need to have a side by side with Sculpin. To me very underrated on BA should be on the TOP 100 list."
"one of the best IPA i had in the last year. look is quite proper clear and a tad on the orange side. not a deep dark ipa. looks beautiful in the glass with a white resilient head of tight bubble. nice lace and retention. the head was there til the end. although this one was a nice rich blend of hops and citrus... a great pine resin quality in the hopping. nose is zesty sweet with a nice pinecomb and pineapple. crisp but that feel carries nicely from the bright hop to the woody quality of the malt dough."
"Really impressed by this beer, I wish it was available in Georgia."
"Outstanding. This is quintessential West Coast IPA. Splurged for a fresh four pack recently. Pours a nice orange-yellow with good head and lacing. Smells fantastic. Full on hop assault. Taste is delicious with a great balance of flavors. Bitterness and a touch of sweet malt. Really an amazing brew."
"Edit: getting some spicy cherry notes now/. Awesome!!"
"Overall a nice balance of complexity and drinkability."
"Paired VERY well with some spicy chilli."
"One of my favorite IPAs, I just wish they would start dating the bottle so I could buy it, as I don't buy IPAs that don't have bottled on dates."
"I love to take my time with this beer and savor each gulp. Two of these would probably be enough to finish the evening for me with a smile."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a pint glass. The beer is a nice, vibrant copper color that pours with a quarter-inch head that quickly dissipates. The beer has citrus and flowery notes on the nose, with hints of malt similar to an Amber. Very low key hops and spice notes also present, if you smell deeply. The beer has the full bodied flavor of malt to set the foundation, with outcroppings of hops tastes throughout. The beer is very round and robust in mouth, with a sour finish. Crisp hops notes are also present in the aftertaste."
"Drinkability is fairly good. It's pretty bitter and while that doesn't usually translate well with me, there's still some complexity behind all of it that I can appreciate the beer. Perhaps if it were a bit more balanced. Nevertheless, a solid IPA."
"Bitter yes, but also highly drinkable. This beer seems to disappear right before my eyes."
"Overall- This is good, but would not desire more than one in a sitting. This has got to be the most straight """bitter""" beer I have ever had."
"D: Very drinkable. The fresh cut grass taste from the hops lingers a bit, so if your consuming with food, you would probably go the more bbq route... some spices might conflict, but it would be worth experimenting. Some roasted peppers would be awesome right now... just sayin."
"D-a fantastic IPA that i will search out and tell my friends about. the taste stays and the abv is tame. i can't wait to have it again."
"I vary this with Torpedo's as my daily brew, although the Torpedo is my main standby. Great body, nice alcohol masking, nice finish, with a touch of malt sweetness to balance the bitterness and tartness. Maybe a wee bit more malt would make this a beer more apropo to those times a guzzlin' like a super bowl gathering (well, along with the old six'er price), but as is, when sitting down for a delectable beer or two, very, very hard to beat as is."
"The fact that I am getting the beer after it has been shipped from the west coast and it is still so good and tasty makes me wonder what it would be like to try fresh in So Cal. A great beer, one of the best IPA's I have ever had."
"Green Flash does not mess around."
"Always pass this up on tap, but I may need to give it a whirl. With no bottling dates, I may be getting old bottles, or worse, mishandled bottles."
"D/N - Pretty drinkable stuff here. Could easily relax and drink this beer through the night. Although Im not sure the price is right for this one."
"Drinkability: This was a nicely drinkable beer which I enjoyed sipping. I'll certainly be putting this one on my list to have again in the future."
"This is my favorite IPA going. Poured 12 oz bottle into my 13 oz tulip glass. A very hazey, bright orange, with a 2 inch white head, that is sticky as any IPA I have had. Lacing hangs out for the beers duration. The smell is piney, grapefruit, with a hint of a toffee. This is a very powerful, hops forward beer. The 95 IBU's were used to perfection. Even being two months old, the hops have held up very well. The mouthfeel is big for a IPA, with plenty of life. I know people say there are better IPA's around, but I have yet to have one!"
"D: The bitterness and peppery finish don't help this beer in the drinkability part, but as long as it isn't obtrusive, I won't care all that much. This is tasty, simply as that."
"Drinkabilty - I would say this is really high since its just over 7% and so tasty. I could handle 3-4 of these over a period of time and be satisfied (and a little buzzed). This just became a top 10 ipa for me, hopheads check this one out."
"D- For the price the four pack goes for there are better IPAs out there."
"This is easily one of my favorite IPA's but in the off chance that GF is reading this review, please go back to the old format of the six pack. I hate the thought of paying more money for less beer. Its a great beer, but there are others just as good. I will buy it again, but it will not be as regular as it once was."
"Ever so slightly syrupy, almost delicate carbonation, and sharp bitterness make for a very enjoyable sip that. I don't find this very quaffable, there is too much going on with too much intensity, but this is still a joy to drink."
"Notes: This is an all out hop attack on the taste buds but oddly the lack of balance doesn't take away as much as I would normally think. Pretty good for a straight up hop bomb."
"d - A pretty nice IPA. I enjoyed the citrus smell a lot, would certainly drink again."
"Like it's name suggests, there is no mistaking that this is a West Coast IPA. A solid beer with nice flavors and smell."
"D: I personally do not desire much more of this one. I consider myself as much a hophead as your average BA, but this beer just seems one-dimensional to me. This is a good example of a hoppy American IPA, and the alcohol is very well hidden, but is not a favorite for me."
"D - One of my favorite IPAs, this is incredibly drinkable given its hop content. If you're a hop-head, this makes a great session beer."
"Pliny is a great IPA, but I like this one better, so I am surprised how low down it is in the rankings. Maybe the maltiness makes it too dark and heavy for some people? Anyway, I like it. The complexity of aroma is matched by only a few brews, including Pliny, Ballast Point, and ones not generally available such as 50-50 Imperial IPA (Truckee) or Chama IPA (New Mexico)."
"from the new four pack delivery. have had this many times on tap, first time in a bottle. smell of hops from the get go and then some. two finger very white head. smell is citrus and pine. initial taste is very bitter, but pleasing nonetheless. balanced, but the harshness of the hops show up. very enjoyable, but noticeably better on tap. at over 7%, getting into double ipa territory, but the alcohol is not overbearing. always enjoy this beer and grateful it can be found in upstate ny."
"This was my first Green Flash beer (I know, I know) and I really enjoyed it. It just screams West coast, with lots of piney hops on the nose and immediately upon the first taste. But it's balanced and has enough of a malt backbone to survive the hop onslaught. Such a difference between these West Coast versions and East Coasters like DFH 60 min."
"A slight bitter bite but that's what you can expect. It's a good tasty hop fest in here and we're all invited."
"Drinkability suffers a touch from the overwhelming tartness of the hops character, but the flavors are just right for major hop-heads."
"Drinkability is awesome if you're a hop pig like me. If I could, I'd wring out the dry hops into this glass, but I'm sure for some it's two extreme - those that don't live and love IPA on the west coast! I do, and this is one of the quit essential reasons why. As I said, one of my top three IPAs, and PtE is technically a DIPA! Of course, like any IPA, it's best at it's freshest, which is regional, so if you're drinking a bottle on the east coast and disagree, there's an obvious difference in you're experience!"
"Nice copper pour with a big frothy off-white head. Delicious aroma of grapefruit, orange zest, caramel malt and spices. Very much like Bell's Hopslam. Hops give lots of grapefruit up front with pine and some floralness lingering of the side of the tongue afterwards. Very little malt balancing out the hops in the flavor. Body is a bit lighter than what I would have liked."
"For its heft it is drinkable, for me it is perfectly drinkable, though I can see where some would be turned off by its lack of balance. All the more for me."
"drinkability - flavorful and robust, a great ipa"
"O - Great IPA."
"D: great drinkability for anyone looking for a fresh, hopped American/Californian IPA."
"West Coast IPA pours somewhere between a deep orange and the first stages of brown, depending on how much light is hitting the glass. The off white head only ever reaches two fingers in height. It doesn't stick around for too long either, and lacing is present, but not remarkable. The nose is classic California IPA, minimal to no malt (I think I can pick up on just a hint of caramel in this one), and a massive dose of tropical citrusy aromas. Green Flash gets extra credit for producing an IPA that's particularly pungent. Unfortunately it doesn't taste as remarkable as it smells. Caramel is a little bit more present here than in the nose, and a rather pronounced bitterness announces the imminent arrival of grapefruit and pineapple citrus notes. It's good, it just doesn't do much of anytning to distinguish itself from any of the other west coast style IPAs that I've had. The body is impressively solid for a beer that's largely devoid of a malt presence. The carbonation, while solid, I think could stand to be a little bit more energetic . Green Flash West Coast IPA is a fine beer (though I think maybe a little too bitter relative to it's hop flavor punch), but there's just really not much to recommend it over some other IPAs."
"amber and cloudy with white head. smell is of tropical fruit and citrus smells and hops. taste is very bitter upfront, with son, but not as much, of the tropical fruits tastes that were in the nose. some of the citrus comes though, but again not much. It's pretty drinkable but tastes better in small sips. I remember this being better on draft the several times I've had it. It does taste fresh, but more of a hop bomb than I remember. Overall, this is fairly good, but not amongst my favorites."
"Overall, I really like this offering from Green Flash and hope I to try more in the future. If this were available in TN, it would be one of my regular go tos."
"O - A niche beer that's more of a bitter novelty than a session beer."
"D: Polished off the 4-pack no problem. I will say though, at nearly the same price as they used to charge for a 6-pack (spare a buck and some change), it makes it hard to justify the purchase."
"None the less its one of my new favorite IPAs!"
"Body is in-line with the style, no problems there. Exceptionally drinkable for hop-heads and West Coast IPA lovers. This one is blistering, so if you hate bitter beers don't waste your time or this beer. For the rest of us, this is definitely one of the top 10 IPAs brewed in the USA."
"Overall a nice IPA with a multitude of hops--Centennial and Cascade being the predominate variety."
"A nice combination of fruits and dryness, well balanced."
"Poured into a tulip glass. The color is a moderate copper-orange color with a nice white head. The nose is really nice with a strong citrus hop component. Hefty notes of orange and grapefruit. Really hoppy. A bit of pine in there as well. The taste is all hops with some citrus rind and light pine and spruce components. Nice bitter mouthfeel and a nice drinkability. Glad we get this West Coast gem here in Virginia."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch and a half of light tan head. This beer is orangish amber in color with yeast suspended throughout. The smell is citrus, mostly orange and grapefruit, with some pine in there as well. The taste focuses more on the bitter aspect. The citrus is well hidden amongst the barrage of piny hops. I knew going into this beer that it would numb my palate. I prefer my mid-western ipa's. I am finally embracing this style but my palate is not ready for the west coast hop bombs. I like my ipa's nice and citrusy. I love the smell but I prefer to taste more than just bitterness."
"I loved it but it could be too overwhelming for some."
"Medium body, lighter carbonation, some sticky and dry feel. Such a tasty and easy drinking IPA, as long as it's fresh. The alcohol is barely detectable, and the scents are super inviting. If there was any way to tell if the bottles were fresh, I'd probably buy it all the time."
"Brilliant. This is the IPA I've been looking for. Doesn't just tick all the boxes, it scribbles them out witha big black magic marker. Richly intense nose of every aroma I've ever encountered in an IPA. Nice medium carbonation enhances the grippy bitterness and leaves an oh so tasty aftertaste. Balance, style, balls. Love it."
"D: For an IPA lover, I woud highly recommend this beer, bitter with plenty of hop flavor. Personally I like a bit more balance in my IPA's, but still solid."
"A tasty IPA with lots going on. It builds up in intensity throughout the glass. Thoroughly enjoyed."
"D: Certainly a multi-dimensional hop attack, coming strong in the aroma, bitter feel, fruity and floral taste and lingering finish. I like the balance achieved while not stepping in the way of the hop onslaught too much, which West Coast IPA certainly has. The 7.3% ABV and powerful, palate-killing hop profile makes this a great choice for a solo brew hop fix."
"It has a golden brown appearance with a skinny white head to it. The smell of this is very hoppy with cameos of malt and some citius fruits. The taste is paired nicely with the smell. It starts citrusy smooth followed by a drop kick hop finish and aftertaste. This is the official beer or the west coast Ipa style. Very drinkable and very good. Enjoy."
"D - Such a wonderful American IPA. 7.30% is enough to knock you around yet I'd take that if I ever got the chance to drink a lot of this. Ticks every box for what I look for in a great American IPA."
"D - Drinkability is great but you must be a hop head to truly enjoy, has a definite aftertaste that does linger and gives you a true IPA taste. Thumbs up, this is a good IPA that can hang with the best."
"D- Gooood, goood. This is a superb IPA that begs to be drunk. Great hop flavor with just a hint of the malt backbone to add balance. Strong flavor that tastes almost like a double, but not overly bitter or palette wrecking. I would definitely pick this up again when I know it's fresh."
"Drinkability is about as good as can be for a beer this strong in flavor. I could drink several of these, but at the price they go for her in upstate NY, this is just a sixer I get every now and then. One of my favorite IPAs, though, for sure."
"Overall: A top notch example of a San Diego style IPA. The bitterness, dry moutfeel, and overall hop vibrancy are sure to please any hophead. A must try if you have access to fresh bottles."
"Note: At 95 IBUs this beer drinks like and hits you with hops like a Double/Imperial IPA."
"This is certainly drinkable. Not a chugger due to the abv, but this is an awesome west coast style ipa."
"I never want to not be drinking this."
"D-This went down very easily and I would readily reach for another. Taste improves as it warms. In my opinion, Green Flash's Imperial IPA is much more balanced."
"Very flavorful and refreshing (alcohol is well-concealed)...this brew seems to favor bold hoppy punch over finesse and balance, but the results are still extremely satisfying."
"Pours a hazy copper color with a big white head that leaves lots of lacing. Huge hop aroma with pine and grapefruit. The taste has massive bitterness with piney hops; it's a bit one-dimensional with the over-the-top bitterness. The finish is very dry and bitter. There is some astringency here as well. The drinkability isn't bad, but I prefer a little more balance in my IPAs."
"D: A great IPA. If you haven't had it, it's pretty easy to come by and definitely worth trying."
"D: I would (& have) order a sessions-worth of GF WC IPA."
"Thanks Nic for bringing this for me the other night. I've had this one many times, and always enjoyed it, but it has been a while. Pours a dark orange-amber color, with a little ecru head that remains after a few minutes. Nice hoppy nose here, piney and a touch citrusy. On the palate, this one is a little oily and resiny, with good grapefruit flavors. Surprisingly balanced, and extremely drinkable, with a lingering bitter finish. One of the better IPAs, IMO."
"A fantastically disguised 7.3%, I could drink a few of these regularly."
"D: A nice strong IPA. If you like the pine and grapefruit combo with some floral tones, this one is for you."
"This beer has the perfect bite for an IPA. The burst of grapefruit taste in your mouth keeps you wanting more. As with most of the IPA's that I drink, I like to savor this one over an hour to get the full range of flavors. I know it may be hard to do your first time, because it taste so darn good, but maybe slow it down on your second. You won't be disappointed."
"This is a delicious beer with a variety of flavors."
"12oz. bottle served in my Harpoon IPA willibecker. Pours a semi-hazy amber with a frothy, 1.5 inch cream-colored head. Head settles into a solid half inch cap with thick clumps of lacing adhering to the sides of the glass. Nose reveals a combination of sweet grapefruit and medicinal hops. Taste consistent with nose; however, a mild malty backbone reveals itself and a slightly caustic lingering bitterness comes out and lingers between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an assertive, almost prickly carbonation. A decent IPA, but the bitterness is a little too much for my taste."
"It's pretty simple to review a beer like this because it hits the mark on everything I look for in an IPA: pungent yet distinctive hop qualities, little to no alcohol heat, support from the malt and spot on carbonation. My hat is off to you Green Flash, prepare to receive more of my money soon."
"Drinkability: Overall, it has some great elements, but it's not my favorite IPA. I consider myself a hophead. The assortment of hops blended nicely in the nose, but I felt they really clashed in the taste department. Something was missing. I don't think I'd want to drink more than one of these."
"Truly one of my favorites."
"This was really quite nice. Poured a 2""" head which took a long time to dissipate. A clear sienna and orangey color. Quite the strong hop aroma. Taste matches the bouquet although maybe a little less strong. You get good fresh hops which make this a solid IPA-lovers beer. Holds it's own against most any of the hopped up competition."
"It's good. Another great IPA."
"This started out like a good IPA should. Though, as far as I am concerned, the big and unbalanced flavor profile work at odds with the balanced nose. While I am not a hop head, and think this is a decent beer. I also think there are much better IPA's around."
"Hell Yeah! West Coast IPA is what I think of when I want a strong, full hopped, delicious IPA. West Coast IPA is bitter, hoppy, with strong floral notes and a slight sweetness to the malt. Definitely a well rounded out beer, this is one you could have again and again, and it wouldn't get old. Comes out a cloudy golden color, with a half finger of frothy head. Good in a bottle, great on tap."
"drinks ok. a bit harsh from the hop profile and slight alcohol burn. would like a bit more pleasant hop flavor to work alongside the hop bitterness. good, but not great. definitely not a gateway beer. you have to love hops and bitterness to enjoy this one."
"Green Flash West Coast IPA is the prototypical California IPA that skirts the line between single and double IPA. I think for people that seek this kind of beer out, it's all about the taste and aroma. This beer is very bitter with an aggressive pine and grapefruit flavors with an underlying malt sweetness. The rosy and citric hop flavors subside quickly leaving just the bracing bitterness. Alcohol is well hidden and very sneaky. The beer smells like a pine grove in early morning next to a orange grove in which the flowers are in full bloom."
"Overall-- not really impressed. I'm pouring the rest of this out. I won't buy it again unless I KNOW it is fresh."
"Few come close to the sublimely intense hoppiness that's Green Flash West Coast IPA. We love this beer."
"This beer is, in my oh so humble opinion, one of the best examples of a west coast IPA. It is very drinkable (thus why I had a full 15.5-gal keg of it) despite its high alcohol content--which, actually allows me to believe it could fall within the DIPA category!"
"The bitterness on the other hand is really something extraordinary. Aside from a problematic undertone of lint and pennies, this palate wrecker comes on like dry wood. I can almost literally feel my mouth being attacked. My thoughts are if you like seriously bitter hops, this is the place for you. Personally, I'll stick to more user-friendly offerings."
"Deep orange in body topped by immense fluffy head that sticks around for a while. Aroma of citrus, pine, hops, light soap, grass, and slight alcohol. Strong flavors of citrus, grass, soap, pine, alcohol towards the finish mingles with some off flavors. Medium bodied brew with some mild thickness. The pine/alcohol mixture has a bit of a burn to it which makes the beer a challenge on the palate and stomach. Enjoyable but not anything to write home about."
"On this particular occasion, poured into my Telegraph shaker glass. Nice finger and a half of meringue-like very light tan head. Dark golden, bordering on light amber. Amazing lacing and retention. Stays for days. Light on malt, heavy on floral and citrus/lemon rind and pine hops. Fills my mouth like an explosion of bitter tangy citrus hops. Very bitter finish for a straight IPA. 97 IBU on a non-imperial? Are you kidding? Finish lingers on and on and on. The class of the west coast."
"D - Hop heads dream, if you love hops you got to get your hands on one or two of these, true in style like the name says """West Coast IPA""". Excellent hoppy beer."
"This is quite a hoppy IPA. Stings the palate with the carbonation. This would go well with a spicy Thai or Indian food."
"After tasting it i am utterly confused, did i get an old bottle because it smelled like malts, or is it still pretty fresh because it tasted fine? At any rate if you don't value smell this one is a good one."
"D- another tasty west coast ipa not the best but a good one. Very enjoyable and not too much of any one thing."
"The flavor is one of those examples of what a stellar American IPA (be it west coast, east coast, Michigan or what ever other sub genres the style claim) is all about. Bright and bold floral hops packed with a grapefruit bite and a slight pineapple sweetness upfront that tingle and tantalize, a malt backbone taming a bit of the hop sting and nuances of almonds and fresh biscuits. The brew itself is of creamy medium body that's not too fizzy or too thick."
"D - A pretty good AIPA but nothing to get all worked up about, West Coast is a hops-slap in the face reached across the country from Cali that doesn't pack a whole lot of drinkability for the style but still goes down well regardless."
"Not too bad but like I said, I felt like it was a bit one sided. Just seemed like it should have more depth."
"D: this IPA drank pretty good but was really good on the aroma and on the taste as far as IPA goes. I really like my IPA's and this one is no execption."
"Overall fantastic beer! I'm definitely going to have to stock up next time I head south."
"Murky orange color with a cream colored head. Smelled to me sort of like paste, (of course it is allergy season so my sniffer might be off...) and a richness. Good hoppiness jumped right out at me, but has a nice bitter flavor. Thin body that washes down easily leaving a strong aftertaste of hops and almost a latent smokiness, like with scotch. A bit too much for all day, but an enjoyable flavor explosion to relax with."
"Very good mouthfeel, just a bit too much carbonation for my tastes but it doesn't take away from it much. Bitter finish is totally expected from such hoppy goodness. I could drink this all day but I fear I would be on the floor after a couple due to the ABV. Just a plain outstanding IPA."
"Very enjoyable indeed."
"M&D: though it's bold and bitter, the overall malt-hop balance stays intact and not at all overly sweet as some of its counterparts sometimes demonstrate. The mouthfeel is soothing, refreshing, against a firm but never heavy body. All in all, this is such a delicious, quaffable and yet potent AIPA that I wouldn't mind revisit time and again~~"
"Conclusion- A superb beer but definitely not my favorite IPA. I think the 94 IBUs are a little to much for a ~7% ABV beer. If they could use the same amount of hops but push more of them to the aroma side and bring it down to maybe 80 IBUs I think just enough of the malt could push through to balance this beer while still keeping it dry and refreshing."
"What appears to be a classic West Coast style IPA."
"I had this on-tap a few months ago and liked the bottle version MUCH better...I feel similarly about many IPA's. The malt seems to come out much more in the bottle bringing a better balance. Nevertheless, this is one of my new favorite single IPA's. I do wish it was a bit cheaper though."
"overall-excellent IPA and makes me feel privileged to live on the west coast and have this readily available. I'd definitely pick this one up on a fairly regular basis."
"A great beer, and I've heard it won some awards, but you could probably make something similar at home with your eyes closed."
"D- Fairly easy to drink, although the metallic finish and the high levels of carbonation mixed with the huge hops used drag this drinkability down, I actually found the Imperial IPA easier to drink due to it's over the top balance."
"Overall this a fairly big IPA, it nudges it's way towards and Imperial IPA bit still manages to be very drinkable. It has great complexity and a nice balance between bitter and sweet/malt."
"Overall - A superb IPA... highly recommended..."
"The result is a happy walk home and a renewed appreciation of all things summer. Atta boy pineapple man."
"From the 355 ml. bottle with no lot code or expiration date. Sampled on July 31, 2010. The pour is a dark amber with a veil of cloudiness in the view. A thin off-white head. Earthy and floral aromas overtake the senses with a slight caramel sweetness on the backside. The taste has a very potent bitter hoppiness. A nicely done brew."
"Excellent beer overall. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Sux to be them I guess...."
"Very good beer, but as I try to limit my session beer (and this is a great session beer) to under $10/6-pack, this is not a good buy."
"the nose on this is absolutely incredible. Lots of citrus, grapefruit yet a bit of pine. Upon first sip, the hops that I smelled earlier, just came to the forefront and really made the buds go wild. Very well done. Super tasty IPA. Medium body that is a bit sticky. alc content is a bit higher for this one so, even after one I could feel a buzz coming on. 2 of them and i'd be buzzing pretty hard. Drinkability based on taste - I could definitely have more."
" Poundability is an 11 on a 1 to 10 scale,Excellent!"
"Just another delicious IPA from Cali that settles a clear and brilliant dark amber color. Moderate pine and citrus hop fill the nose. Take a bite of the generous bitter hop taste that gives a rough but friendly bite back and leaves a sweet grapefruit bitter aftertaste. Wonderful with a fully loaded cheddar cheeseburger and fries."
"This beer has a very unique taste and smell. I can't quite pin down it's taste and smell, but I like it. I actually crave this beer because of its uniqueness. It looks awesome in a glass also. I highly recommend this one, not sure if everyone would love this one because it is pretty sharp, but this beer is at the top of my list for IPAs."
"Second tasting 2 days later. Resinous astringency, but not overwhelming. You can really taste the different hops used which give the bitterness several layers.. Some people have protested the cloudy color. I guess its an aesthetic thing...I love the cloudiness."
"Poured into a regular ol' pint glass. Nice light caramel color with a good two finger head that becomes a solid eighth inch lacing. Smells like sweet candy with a hint of melon and slight bit of orange. Taste is a decent balance of slightly sweet malt and slight pine flavor. The bitterness and malt sweetness balance pretty nicely. This is a medium bodied brew that tastes great. I know I couldn't find a date code on these bottles, and I've had this fresher on tap and it was amazing. The fact that I can still enjoy it a couple months later is quite a relief, but it's not ideal. Bottom line: delicious brew."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"Highly drinkable and very enjoyable, this is a very good IPA and a definite recommendation which I will seek out again. I've had this many times over the past few years and have always enjoyed it."
"There is a flavor in here I love. Like a """grainy malt""" or something. Must explore more."
"Drinkability- very nice, I could have quite a few of these. It's a really good IPA."
"Deep copper hazy color. Big off-white thick head that dissipates very slowly and leaves a nice cap. Lazy wet lacings that hang around for a while. Big floral aroma with grapefruit and pine. A big wallop of hop flavor up front that smooths into and a brief toasted malty flavor and exits with a long lingering piney aftertaste. It's amazing the malt character is able to poke throught with all of the hops. Very smooth almost buttery feel. Very enjoyable. Very drinkable."
"Pours a beautiful amber/orange with a ginormous fluffy cloud head with great retention. Nose is pine and citrus hops. Taste is unbelievable. Pine and white grapefruit dominate, the second act is the bitterness and the slightest sugar cookie sweetness, then back to the pine sap bitterness, and the breath provides a great biscuity malt finish. Fucking epic. Perfect mouthfeel. My favorite IPA."
"D - I could drink this beer all night long. So good on many levels!"
"Hop fanatics will love this beer. Others will likely take it or leave it. For me personally, it is a reliable and consistently entertaining friend, who always has a few new jokes to tell."
"Notes: A little too west coast for me...I think the flavor was missing the best parts. It just didn't connect with the nose the way that I would have wanted, but still very very delicious."
"Love it or hate it, that mouthfeel lowers the drinkability score. This is solid but doesn't explode."
"D: A nice beer to sip on but not an IPA that I'd make a go-to."
"OVERALL: Another good offering from Green Flash. The nose gave me some worries that it wouldn't quite deliver the punch, but the flavors definitely came through in the end. A good looking beer with lots of flavor. Recommended."
"mouthfeel: medium bodied with some carbonation. Prickaly mouthfeel and a bit oily (hop resin). Doable (if that's a word). I would have no problem putting down a few of these (I must warn that I am a hop head though, if I wasn't, one would be more than enough.)"
"Deep gold body a bit hazy, one finger white head, fairly slow dissipation with significant lacing. Huge frickin hop bud hit in the nose, with some caramel malts for balance. Taste is a bit sweet up front, hops in the middle, grapefruity chunks, leading to a fairly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is a bit on the sweetside, good effervescence. Really drinkable IPA, one of the exemplars of the SD/West Coast style, the tap version is well worth seeking out, the hops really shine in this version."
"Overall, a solid West Coast IPA as promised. Would have hated this a few years but find it intriguing but still too bitter to have more than one for now. Be interested to see how I feel in 6-12 months as I go down the hoppy highway. Avail here in TX. Rotation - at the moment, one was good enough but will try again in 6-12 months. [O;O;BL]"
"Drinkability -- It's certainly a West Coast IPA with its big grapefruit and bittering hops. There's some to be desired in the mouthfeel, but otherwise a solid offering."
"D- kinda on the fence. If you're into bitter IPAs, this one is for you. If you're more into ones that bring the citric hops and that warm grapefruitiness...pass"
"Overall, a top tier IPA. Big hop flavors and aromas really stand out and make this enjoyable. Something that I definitely wish was more commercially available in my area."
"In conclusion, hops. Seriously, this is way more hoppy than any *Double* IPA I've had, including PtE. However, the balancing floral citrus and malt notes are just not here the way they are in what I feel to be better examples of the style. It did hit the spot, though, and I may turn to it again when I have a serious thirst for pure hops."
"This right here is what Cali hop assault is all about. Kicks Stone Ruination all over the place. Can't handle more than a couple, but that's probably my own fault!"
"A bit too astringent for me. There are 95 IBUs in this beer and you can taste them. The alcohol also becomes a lot more noticeable once the beers warms up which hinders the drinkability for me."
"A bottle on 2/5/13 that was bottled only 15 days prior is absolutely brilliant. Pungent, vibrant, big resinous hops, sharp pine, with a fresh juicy orange punch. Long bitter finish despite a reasonable caramel malt backbone."
"Really nicely done, and I can't find much to fault this beer on. Its the kind of brew that would be a welcome addition to my fridge at any time of the year."
"Pours a murky orange with 2 finger head. Nice retention and great lacing. Lots of pine and citrus hops in the smell. It smells like a really hoppy double IPA, though it is apparently just a single. Taste is just a hop bomb. Lots of bitterness, with sticky pine hops and citrus. Some caramel malt in there for a touch of balance. Awesomely drinkable."
"D - Man, am I glad this one comes in a six-pack! Incredible drinkability and thoroughly enjoyable."
"D - Good. The one bottle I had took me no time to drink, but I would probably be cautious about making this my session IPA."
"D: I would definitely try this beer again. It packs in a lot of different hop flavors but isn't overly bitter."
"The ABV will creep up on you about halfway through the six pack. Otherwise, good drinkability if you feel like killing a sixer with a crapload of IBUs."
"Amber with a dense, 1""" head that slowly dissipated. Citrus and pine aromas. It has a heavy, creamy mouthfeel that reveals a combination of citrus and mouth-drying hops. It strikes a nearly perfect balance between the over-the-top hop experience that these beers are supposed to provide with subtle layers of flavor, good body and drinkability that could get you into trouble at 7.3% abv. I experiment with just about any """West Coast""" style IPA that can be found on the shelf (regardless of provenance), and this is consistently one of my favorites of this type."
"This really is a very good IPA. It's very smooth and drinkable and it does indeed have those classic fruity characters that should be expected of a West Coast example."
"Just finishing this one, not gonna do a clinical breakdown of attributes for this one. It's a beer that gets to the point, and so will this review. It's called West Coast IPA and the name fits, all the hop craft of Cal. brewing is in this one, it is the full range of hop goodness, presented in extreme for an IPA, and it has a mouth rocking fine flavor profile, everything you might figure its name implies is in here. Get it, try it, you'll love this one. Best? No. In the same league? Definitely"
"pours a cloudy copper color with large fluffy white head, good lacing and soft carbonation. strong piney citrus smell with hints of just about everything you can think of. This is an amazing beer that packs a plethora of flavors, piney, citrus, grapefruit, floral, and just about any other hop flavor you can imagine. medium body with a thin creamy texture that finishes very bitter. one of the best beers i've ever had."
"A very solid IPA, could be quite sessionable if not for the lingering bitterness and 7.3% strength (which isn't noticeable, but still moves it out of sessioning)."
"Had on draught at Deep Ellum. Lots of sweet malts are balanced out by the classic assault of juicy, piney hops. The color is medium, hazy, looks packed full of HOPPY GOODNESS. A nice thick head didn't want to go anywhere. So I drank it. Circles of lovely lace ringed the glass. This is one of my absolute favorite go to beers. When I lived in CA I got hooked. Glad I can get it here, and fresh on draught at that!"
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, I could have multiple of these in a sitting."
"Wow, I haven't been this impressed by a West Coast IPA since my first Pliny. This was brutal hop warfare; I'm in love."
"The taste doesn't seem very complex, but if you like american IPAs, this is a delicious and satisfying example of such."
"MF/D- Medium to full bodied IPA. The flavors bounce around on your toungue and linger for quite a while. A very tasty and drinkable IPA. I could easily have another. Too bad we don't get it in CT."
"thumbs up"
"overall: a ballsy hopped up brew that could be from stone it takes no prisoners and makes no apologizes."
"D/O- A tasty little hop forward beer from Green Flash. Even though this is a good beer, I really don't see myself reaching for this beer again anytime soon. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but it just isn't my cup of tea. Cheers."
" An aggressive pour delivers two fingers of white fluffy head resting proudly atop an amber colored ale. Lacing galore as the head falls to a thin cap that maintains for the remainder. A tint of gold is revealed when held to the light. Truly a beauty of an IPA and strangely dark for an ale boasting West Coast in the name. Sweet candy hops come through in the nose highlighted with light floral aromas. The hops become stronger as the ale draws closer to room temperature. Orange and grapefruit become more and more prevalent. The tip of the tongue gets a nice treat of sweet grain and hop resins. The pallet becomes coated boldly with hop oils of bitterness. Sticky hops lasting in the after taste proving worthy of the west coast name. The very slight evidence of caramel remain dry but pay homage to the style. West Coast IPA is quite a quaffer, but heed the 7% ABV dong your best not to kill the entire growler to you can still respect beer. Tonight is a week night and I shared this one with a very grateful fellow BA brother."
"Great beer! Really loved this one."
"Overall, a superb effort by Green Flash. Quintessential west coast IPA - very appropriately named. Everything clicks with this brew. Very impressed."
"D - As I continued to drink this beer the pine became more prevalent than the citrus and the malt backbone also became more predominant. A good balanced IPA but not exactly what I expected from a """west coast""" IPA."
"This is very drinkable and tasting fresh on draft."
"up there with smuttynose and nugget nectar. no so much a question of style, but of pure hopheadiness!"
"D - very nice tasting IPA, could have alot of these, maybe not the best choice for someone new to a hoppier ipa, but I am very happy with this one."
"Drink - Say what you will about the bitterness, it's a rather tasty drink. Those who fear hops should stay away, but anyone who appreciates the style will enjoy it. I found the alcohol to be a bit strong though, so it's definitely not a session beer for me."
" It poured out a nice gold with a decent head. The smell was thick and balanced, nice citrus hops. The taste was as balanced as the smell, nice and hoppy with a slight, sweet background. A little heavy for an IPA with only 7%ABV. I could have had another but there was a Saison I hadn't had on tap so..."
"If I lived on west coast, this would be drinkable. Even given the horrible dose of diesel it takes to ship Green Flash all the way out here, I couldn't help preferring this to some way more nearby neighborhood IPAs."
"Stay away if you can! Their are plenty of other IPA's to try!"
"D- a decent price for what you get. if you want hop taste and cottonmouth, this is the beer for you."
"Pours a nice amber color with a big fluffy white head and moderate lacing. Aroma is loaded with citrus and hops - smells fantastic. The taste is a bit of a step down though, in my opinion. The hop bitterness is extremely intense, and a bit too rough around the edges. Citrus is there with a moderate malty sweetness. In the end, though, the overload of bitterness just seems a bit unrefined to me - not enough balance. Load it with hops, sure, but give me something there with it to complement it. As it is, it just seems a bit one-dimensional. Mouthfeel is very good - creamy, good carbonation. Fairly drinkable."
"Drinkability: The abv is above my normal session IPA but its very drinkable. I wouldnt necessarily need food with this, but a nice sharp cheddar or gouda would do wonders for this beer."
"very syrupy beer. sticks around with you for a while but very drinkable. overall this ipa is one of my favorites that i've had the pleasure of drinking so far."
"Drinkability? Hops could get a bit harsh on you, but I could have another one...but it isn't really made to be a drinkable bear. Its made to rip your face off."
"drinkability: very nice ipa and one of my all time favs."
"Drinkability was good but the score took a hit due to the lingering bitterness. I like this beer but there are much better IPA's out there to enjoy. But at least it delivers the hops!"
"Drinkability, for me at least, is not fantastic, as this beer packs a serious bitter punch. Nevertheless, a great example of the style. One of the most """west-coast""" brews I've ever had."
"Overall= wow, this is up there with the best of the IPA's, next to stone Ruination, Lagunitas Maximus and DFH 90 minute. Great beer, love the flavors, resin from the hops and all around drinkablity."
"[edit] I'm still working through a six pack of these. I just do not like this beer. Each time I drink it, it is an utter chore to finish."
"D - This is certainly good and nearly-great stuff. I wish it was on the shelves in Florida."
"Drinkability is pretty high. The bitterness is strong, but clears the palate more and begs for another sip. Being in Califronia, this beer is plentiful at most pubs and bars that I prefer making it easily accessible."
"D - Enjoyable and even with the higher ABV and IBU it ends crisp, light, and refreshing."
"Notes: Initially had this on tap at McCleary's in Marietta, PA. Got case at CHB. Freshness date was a month old so knew it was good but shocked that it was just as good from the bottle as on tap. An absolutely outstanding IPA. God bless Cali IPAs."
"The beer in itself is good but i wouldn't drink more than a couple."
"Taste is just awesome. The hope are just huge in this brew, with big pine and earthy flavors. Citrus is there as well, but is only hinted at. The pine flavors dominate. There is a little bit of grapefruit, although not a ton. This is pushing the boundary of imperial ipa imo, and at 92 ibus that definitely makes sense to me. Awesome beer."
"D: Goes down easily, but very hoppy with strong bitter notes -- not for everyone, but a solid IPA."
"D- This is a very aggressive IPA. Reminds me of Hopsickle-but at the single IPA level. Carbonation and bitterness tend to be cloying, arrogant, abrasive, and slightly obnoxious...but beneath this is a well crafted brew filled with a smooth oily body and a plethora of hop flavors...in other words initially one notices aggressive carbonation followed by aggressive bitterness...but at a second look there is a lot more to this beer than that. Deserving of its name-West Coast IPA-and is, what I feel to be a stereotypical West Coast IPA."
"This is a fine, complex IPA. It has a little bit of everything for everyone in the west coast hop family. A very enjoyable beer"
"D-The drying quality hurts the drinkability a little for me, but other than that a solid IPA."
"An all around good representation of what a west coast IPA is. Thick head with Lots if lacing, the smell has a bit of citrus but the flavor is all pine, Big Cs must dominate the hop bill in this,as is typical for west coast. mouthfeel is slightly tacky but clean finishing and a few pints would be great with food but too much if all alone. Solid beer."
"I'm in love...."
"The body wasn't lacking either. Smooth and mouth coating, the carbonation had excellent crispness but didn't take away from the silky yet sticky dry character. Too much to talk about, well made beer."
"Green Flash... you've done it. Great Job!"
"Overall: This beer, for me, definitely lived up to my expectations. I drank these after first having a Hopslam, and this sure held it's own in my opinion. I was happy to see that even after the Hopslam, this beer clearly presented it's fantastic flavor & aroma. This will be purchased and enjoyed (and copied as a homebrew!)"
"One and done for taste buds. Sorry."
"Overall: Excellent IPA and an immediate favorite for any hop-head. Value is not great plus they bumped down to 4-packs (without really changing the price) but this beer is still worth it."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into my Surly pint glass. A good two fingers of head. Slightly cloudy with fine hop sediment in the shade of apricot. Ah yes, the pine aroma. Like a Christmas tree in my glass. First taste hits with all the hop bitterness and solid malt backbone that made me first fall in love with this beer. Some abstract lacing to admire on the glass now. Hop-covered grapefruit emerges as it warms. My tongue feels medicated. Good stuff."
"It's a decent IPA, the 7.3% alcohol is apparent but not overpowering. Would not purchase again however, if I'm in a bar and it's on tap I might try it if one of my favorites are not available."
"D - On the hoppy side but still nicely balanced. Tasty."
"Pours a murky amber color. The aroma is of citrus hops and grapefruit hops with a little hint of a sweet malt backbone underneath. The taste has a sweet malt backbone underneath a big hop presence. The hop taste is of citrus and grapefruit hops nice bitter hop bite. The mouthfeel is very dry. Overall its an above average beer, nice hop bite and bitterness and good mouthfeel."
"Overall, it's pretty much exacty what I thought it would be. The hops of a DIPA all crammed into an IPA. Intense and a great brew to have, wish I had more access to it!"
"This beer is clean. It is also grassy and sweet. Hints of pine and flowers. Weed and honey. Not too sweet, just enough sweetness to make it smooth. AMAZING!! If you can get your paws on this brew, do so."
"D: Super tasting, fresh IPA. Upon this beer being recommended to me, I picked up a 6 pack and have zero regrets about it. Had this after a Two Hearted and it was hands down better"
"D: great IPA in SD vein, nothing mind-blowing but great kick-back brew"
"Overall I think of this a a standard west coast I.P.A. It is good to compare others to but non-rememberable in its own right. I'm not going to find myself craving another one on my next trip to the west coast."
"Drinkability and Mouthfeel: Good carbonation with a great floral feel to it. It's an IPA so you have to choose wisely because the hops stay on your palate. Very nice beer."
"An excellent IPA, more caramel sweetness than many for the style, but has heaps of hop bitterness to balance it out. This was a treat."
"Pours a dark gold almost amber colorwith a small amount of head. The nose has bright citrus fruits and so light toasted grains showing through, a hint of fruity yeast is also present.The taste is bitter up front and rounded out on the back with nice flavoring hops, almost a """fruity pebble""" cereal taste, sweet malts are also present on the finish. Dry mouthfeel with lingering flavors and a bit grainy on the finish. Overall a good IPA."
"D - Very drinkable for a west coast IPA. Probably wouldn't have a whole 6 pack in one sitting this is one to enjoy and savor."
"D- Easy to drink for sure, wish I had a 6 pack instead."
"D: Again for the abv this goes down scary smooth, the aggressive hops are the only thing that make this a little less quaffable which is very much desired from this style!"
"M/D - Medium bodied with very lively carbonation. Hops provide a slightly sticky feel. I would never guess 7% ABV. This is very crisp and dry, highly drinkable assuming you enjoy hops."
"Nice, dry mouthfeel. I like it a lot. Easy to drink. I'd never turn this beer down, I just feel like the bitterness is too dominant."
"Considering the raised expectations from everything I have read this turned out to be a very tasty IPA, that I will certainly have in regular rotation. Glad it lived up to the hype!"
"Not the most complex beer maybe, but it gives what it advertises, showcasing the """multi-dimensional hop experience""" mentioned on the label (four different hops used for four different reasons) and bottom line: it's freaking delicious. Will most definitely satisfy any hophead's hop jones."
"Straight 4.0s on this for me. It is a good, perhaps almost great west coast IPA, yet didn't stand out as much as I was expecting based on all the raves. Well-balanced overall, but not amongst the best in class in any particular category. Not as citrusy I was expecting, but not to say I wouldn't drink this again."
"-Eric Roth, Roth Brewing Company"
"D- Yes please. Could drink this over and over and wouldn't complain. Love the fact you can buy this in 6 packs. Go get some!"
"A great IPA. I heard talk of an underground style emerging, the American I PA opposed to just an IPA being hops from any region. This beer tastes like an American IPA to me. There are few like this anwhere."
"Notes: Great impression. I was able to do a decent round of notes but the setting was very social so this deserves another visit given this great first impression."
"Overall, a very good beer. Worth effort to obtain. I've heard a lot of hype over this brewery the last couple of years and I'll admit that GF is matching the lofty standards people are setting for them, unlike some other breweries in GF's neighbor hood."
"Overall this brew is good, but in the grand scale of amped up west coast IPAs I'm sorry to say that this one comes up a little short for me. I can't lie though, damn tasty."
"D- I love IPAs and this is one of my favorites. This might be an older bottle compared to the last time I had it, but its still an excellent beer. Could drink this stuff all day long."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and prickly and the hop bitterness lingers for a long time after the sip. My overall score is based on what I experienced with this bottle plus how I know it should taste since I've had alot of experience with this beer. I would love to go into more depth with a review but knowing it's an old bottle, what's the sense of it? It's an excellent beer. (Judging by the bottle only, maybe a """C"".) In its prime, this is a very drinkable beer and remains on the list of my favorite IPA's. Skip my review and just look at the overall BA score, it's pretty accurate."
"D - I couldn't find a single 12 oz of this, so I bought the 22. I'm ok with this. It will take me a while to get through it, but it's a beer I'd love to have on hand back in MN."
"It pours a pale amber/orange with a nice fluffy head that dissipates before long. Not surprisingly the ABV is well masked with the overwhelming bitterness and aroma. Its certainly worth the price wherever you can find it!"
"Picked this up at the local mart looking for a fresh new ipa. Boy this was a delight! Right when I poured the beer the hops were noticeable. It poured with a nice dark golden color with a light head. The taste was exceptional. Lots of hops. I loved the taste and felt the hops really made it tie all together. I thought it had an easy finish without much of a bite making it easy to drink. I was surprised though that a beer with this much hops had this little of a bite."
"It poured a nice bubbly light amber with a decent head. Smelled like pine resin and grapefruit. I thought, """This smells like a DIPA.""" Turns out it tastes like one, too. A real palate attack. Because I've been waiting so long, just got off of work, it was ice-cold, and I had a sixer of 12 oz. bottles, I quaffed the first one down. Buzz."
"D: Darn tasty beer, a bit of a palate killer after two and the abv cause me to knock it down a bit"
"M & D: Medium body with an oily texture and a suitable level of effervescence. We all expect great things from a west coast IPAs and while this brew is good, I consider it more of a baseline/middle-of-the-road offering. Will gladly have another at any time."
"Overall this has always been a favorite of mine and this on-tap version seemed extremely fresh. Highly Recommended."
"Excellent beer, nice mouthfeel & easy to drink. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Drinkability: All day. This one's great at the beach, or anytime."
"First had this beer on tap at Redbones Barbeque in Somerville, MA. At first smell I noticed the ridiculous piney hop. Some citrus notes after that...have to admit getting cocked on this brew (didn't take much considering the ABV & the sappy quality) Very clean aftertaste...one of my favorite west coast american IPA's- would recommend getting educated on some lighter IPAs before giving this monster a shot. Fabuous beer overall"
"The strong bitterness of the hops detracts from the drinkability and the high ABV would limit the quantity. This is a well made, flavorful and refreshing ale that is too highly hopped for my taste. Others may disagree. It is well worth trying, though expensive."
"The intense flavor signature of this beer pretty much relegates it to one serving per session, for me at least"
"Pours a standard copper copper color with concrete solid sediment suspension. The head is about one fingers worth after the pour, but maintains quite well after the fact. The aroma ha plenty of earthy and citric peel notes. Not too much noticeable though. The taste starts citric peels and all with maybe some biscuits that speak for the malts. The middle to the finish is pretty bitter and everlasting. I like bitter, but I don't want to go to sleep with it on my palate. Not sessionable for me and my taste. But still an ok IPA."
"D= Very good, very drinkable West Coast IPA. I liked it better on tap than from the bottle. I am glad this is available in Illinois now..."
"Notes: Did not enjoy even though I often like very hoppy beers. This was just too one-dimensional and astringent."
"Glad to have gotten to try another great West Coast IPA."
"The color was beautiful, a hazy burnt orange. There was little to no appreciable head. Though I profess to love hops this beer proved to be a little too much. At 95 IBU's the balance between malt and hops was just not enough to keep this as an enjoyable to drink beer. 4 different hops, simcoe, columbus, centennial, and cascade combine to create a hop atomic bomb. Good in small amounts but it quickly grows medicinal."
"This is one hell of an IPA. Top 5 in my book."
"Not many beers prettier in appearance than an IPA. Served in a pint glass, the beer was an amber color with a thick off-white head. Plenty of lacing. Mostly citrus aroma, as well as a bit of perfume. Grapefruit taste, very hoppy. It reminded me of Leatherlips, and showed you can make a real hop bomb without jacking up the alcohol."
"Very piney and bitter citrus peels in the nose. You can smell the hops when you open the beer. Dark golden body with an ivory head that is perfumy to say the least. Very hoppy flavor to this IPA, will satisfy your hop fix. Mildly unbalanced-another west Coast hop bomb. Well crafted and veteran mouthfeel. Good session IPA for the hop cravers."
"West Coast indeed. Pretty much the definition of the style. 95 IBUs sounds about right. Liquid gold for hop fiends."
"Pine, citrus, and grapefruit. A classic west coast ipa and delicious if you're in the IPA mood. The bitterness makes it a little less drinkable than desired. However the mouthfeel is great. a perfect lightness for the style."
"Can lose some of its initial luster, doesn't evolve throughout, but is massively drinkable. A classic. Zippy."
"Mouth is very creamy, and the carbonation lends some nice weight on the tongue. Very drinkable, good bitterness quality that is not astringent in the least. Hey it's not Coors light, but it's still pretty good."
"Drinkability - 5.0/5.0 - If I could get this beer in ABQ regularly, I think it would be a regular in the fridge."
"Bottle says """Extravagantly Hopped""" and it delivers. I'll usually go for a DIPA if I'm looking for this degree of bitterness but no denying this is a good one and I would love to try it on tap should the opportunity present itself."
"D - A big flavored beer--a nice exploration of hop complexity."
"M/D - Once your palate adjusts to the bitterness, West Coast becomes a rather sessionable IPA. It's medium body and agreeable carbonation make it a refreshing addition to any activity...especially beer Friday's at the office!"
"M - Full-bodied deliciousness. Hearty hops and a bit of malty sweetness. Slight carbonation to provide a cleansing tingle on the palate. So balanced. So tasty. Not quite the hop smack that I expected but damn is it good."
"D - Excellent IPA and one that I am going to add to the line-up of favorite extreme hopped IPA craft beers. This is a very session-able beer if you can handle the 7 % abv"
"The ale has a deliciously explosive hop aroma. The nose has a nice combination of piney sharpness and citrusy sweetness. The ale has a big bold hoppy body, coming perilously close to making the jump to DIPA-land. The hops grab you with a resiny, thick sweetness that has grapefruit and apricot flavors. The hops are built on a nice biscuity malt base that provides a bit of graininess ot offset the hop sweetness. The hops are big and strong here, really giving a new taste to the American IPA style. Well worth a look."
"A soapy, medium-white head with low retention. Color was a deep amber with NE-quality clarity. Very unusual in a cask beer. Nose! Ha! As one person put it, it was like sniffing a baggie of fresh Sensimillia. Ho ho. As if I would have any point of reference... Anyway, those CA boys can lay hands on strains of hops that many of us may never toke on, I mean, drink. Mouthfeel was thick, sticky, and resinous. I poured a tad into a bowl to see if it would light, but to no avail. Lots of piney hops on the tongue and on the finish. Speaking of the finish - dig, the groovy light show, man. Smokability: 5.0."
"D: It's a good solid IPA."
"D: I usually have 2 before I order anything else"
"D-i do love me some west coast ipa. it was one of the first ipa's that i got into in my move to craft beer while living in San Francisco. big hops just like a west coast ipa should be and a great mouthfeel"
"D: This is a delicious IPA and it definitely is on the upper level of IPAs that I have tried, but the sharp mouthfeel and the bitter finish could definitely become too much some beer drinkers. For me, one pint was perfect, any more would have been too much."
"D - Quite drinkable despite the somewhat harsh character of the hops and malt, but I am just slightly disappointed in this one. The burnt toast and soapy hops get a bit cloying after a while, but the hop aroma is excellent. This beer is like the really smart kid who never does his homework; it gets by but it has the potential to be so much more than it is. Just a bit more sweetness would help the drinkability and balance and could make this a world class IPA."
"D: I probably waited too long to try this beer. Always overlooking it for something else, and I regret it. This is definitely one of the best IPA's I've tasted over the years, and I'm sure it will be a mainstay in my fridge from now on. As far as sessioning goes, I do think it's a little too much after 2 or 3. But those 2 or 3 are still remarkably enjoyable."
"Cheers!"
"Big ups to Hogtownharry for providing me with this Gem! Thanks man! Bottle pours a deep and transparent coper with a duvel style rocky white cap that does not want to go away. Nice sticky lace left behind as well. The nose is assaulted with pine and grapefruit, cookie dough and lemon, grass and floral notes. These all come together and blend well to create a fantastic aroma. The taste is big bitter piney hops with lemon and grapefruit, toffee and caramel malts, alongside a blast of floral goodness. Dry, chewy, lots of resin, and tasty as heck. Dangerously drinkable at 7%. Wow, thanks for this one Harry!"
"D - Great hop flavor and intensity with just enough malt to lend a bit of balance. Enjoyed this one a lot, and will definitely revisit it in the near future."
"D: Excellent. This is what an IPA should aspire to be. Full of chewy hop flavor, balanced by just enough malt to allow all the hops to shine through. An aggressively bitter beer that I can only imagine most people would not care for, but an otherwise damn fine beer."
"D: This is right up there with Ruination as an unbalanced hop bomb. An absolute must-try for IPA enthusiasts."
"Great flavor, enhanced by the creaminess of the cask conditioning. All the usual suspects were there: hoppy pine and resin, bittering citrus zest, and caramel malts; however the hoppiness was slightly subdued, making this beer much more drinkable than out of the bottle. Fantastic body, with a creamy medium thickness and light carbonation. One of my favorite cask experiences to date...right up there with, nay, better than dry-hopped Ruination."
"Drinkability- I'd say its a pretty manageable beer."
"Only second time I had it, but this was much better than the first time I had tried it. On my to buy list."
"Overall: Fits the bill and then some. A great brew for a respectable price and does what it sets out to do..be a kickass IPA. While I can tell it is a cali brew from taste without looking at the label which means it is at some aspect generic it doesn't lose any points because it is still damn good and there is no ranking for 'uniqueness'."
"This is a great dry grapefruit riddled IPA. I'm really happy we get Green Flash in Chicago now because this is my new go-to IPA when I need my California IPA fix."
"D. The drinkability was just so so. Too many of these might give you blisters in your mouth from the burning hops."
"Overall, next to R.R.'s Blind Pig, Stone's IPA, AleSmith's IPA, and Racer 5 IPA, this is a West Coast IPA par excellence. Drink it. A lot of it. You won't be disappointed."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp orange with a slightly frothy head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight citrus and sweet malts. The taste is a nice kick of bitter citrus hops with a nice malt backbone and a lingering bitter finish. The beer is medium bodied with just a hint of alcohol stickiness. This one is very enjoyable on draft."
"WOW. This is a hop bomb, so bitter, it's a bit unbalanced but very hardcore. This detracts from the drinkability. It's got a light sweetness and a good light body. Could be a bit maltier for this. Awesome brew."
"Superior drinkability if you are a hop-head. This is a very pure expression of the style, and works very well on cask."
"This is the best widely available IPA I've ever found. My fridge has been primarily filled with Green Flash for months because it is pure, mysterious and drinkable. I can't help but draw lineage way back from Sierra to the Two Hearted and, now Green Flash as the go-to beer that never dissapoints. This beer has more attitude than Stone Ruination and Lagunitas' Double but remains somehow dry, crisp in its power. People keep talking about nut and malt flavors, but to me it seems more directly related to the essence of the hop. Double Nectar and Racer 5, Dogfish and Bells, all good, but for the ultimate IPA under 12 bucks/6, look no further. It is cursive, all else print."
"If you want a kick in the pants from a bunch of hops (with some malt balancing it out) give it a shot. it's delicious."
"D- While the alcohol was not a problem (i.e. extremely drinkable for a 7%+ IPA), I can't say that it is as drinkable as others that I've had. Since the goal of this beer is obviously not session-ability, I see no problem with this. I could definitely drink a few of these, but it's not the kind of six-pack that I would find myself polishing off as quickly as others."
"I'd certainly drink it again but this beer is nothing special Skip it."
"12oz bottles. Pours a cloudy amber. Wow, a punch of hops right to the mouth. So delicious. Incredible amount of bitterness. Amazingly smooth for 7.3%. So depressed I drank all of it already. Fantastic beer. Definately grabbing more of this beauty next time I cross the border."
"D - This is a beer that could be drunk by the case load."
"D: Highly drinkable, great flavor, the only thing that could hold this back is that intense flavor could be overwhelming over time."
"Pours light amber, with a thick-thick white head. Yes, double thick. I could scoop up the head with an ice cream scoop and eat it from a cone. Smells like ruby red grapefruit juice, hints of floral tea, floral in the form of rose and geranium. Mostly tastes of grapefruit and pine, intense yes, though somehow not as intense as the bottled version seemed to me, which was surprising. Nice medium, sticky body, and prickly carbonation. For me, the tap version is more quaffable than the fresh bottles. Tasty."
"Drinkability: Green Flash's West Coast IPA is amply malty and rather well hopped, so it should please hopheads and lovers of IPA's. I know I found it to be enjoyable."
"Overall this beer once again didn't disappoint. One of my favorite noses on a beer and one that everyone should have the pleasure of sniffing. Worth a shot."
"Candied citrus hop aroma with tropical fruit hints. Flavor is dominated by hops, mostly ripe grapefruit with tropical fruit undertones. Malt is lean and unobtrusive, lending just a touch of sweetness to the otherwise clean, bracing bitterness. Mouthfeel is slightly oily but generally dry. Finishes with a long, citrus pith bitterness. One of my favorite regular IPAs. It has great hop flavors, the malt stays out of the way, and it finishes clean."
"12 oz. Nice dark orange/copper pour. Some whitish head. Aroma has some orange and grapefruit, light pine, little subdued mustyness. A little fruitier than some, hints of apple and pear, still dry though. More grapefruit than lemon or orange, which is nice for me. Lingering piney hops, just a little soapiness, which can be a lot in some. Nice dry finishing grapefruit. Nice lighter bodied, good carbonation. Really nice drinking for a 7% IPA."
"d- crazy drinkable, one of the better ipas i've had, this is so grapefruity and bitter in the best way possible, i could have several of these no problem, actually wish i had another in the fridge right now."
"D - To date, this has been my favorite West Coast IPA. Maybe part of it was its freshness - the hops really jumped out of this beer. I had three pints and could have had another without getting burned out. I wish this was available in Wisconsin."
"Overall, this is a great brew. I tend to stick towards the maltier, more balanced IPAs. This is not one of them. This is what most people think of and expect when having an IPA. No flaws that I could detect. Ive actually been craving a beer like this lately. Yes, very hoppy, but not overdone. There is also a touch of malt in there that makes me happy."
"The tastse is much bitter than it smells and almost comes as shock. The taste lasts several seconds and bitterness makes it hard to drink a ton of it."
"Nice little brew that I enjoyed quite a bit..."
"I've been looking forward to this one based on all the WC hype surrounding its bitterness as a standard IPA. Tiny floating sediment and a lack of head and lacing reduce the appearance score. All kinds of hop complexities rule here. Citrus and juicy, piney and astringent. I'm glad I found a local shop here in rural Texas that carries this regularly. The aftertaste is killer. Very dry and bitter. I love that. Drinkable, too."
"D - Based on its style, I could easily drin several of these. Keep in mind it is 7% with a load of IBUs, but if you are looking for a great hop-forward, smack in the nose IPA then this beer is a perfect match."
"Tonight I sat down with a bomber and some aged gouda and it made for an enjoyable evening. I'm stoked this beer is now distributed in Il and I'll definitely be adding it to the regular rotation."
"Little carbonation with a very smooth drying mouthfeel from start to finish that leaves your tongue tingling, very similar to the feeling i get from biting in to citrus skin (grapefruit), a feeling I don't entirely dislike."
"D: At 95 IBUs and 7+% ABV, I would hard pressed to have more than 2 - we are talking intense hops here. But those 1 or 2 bottles will be heaven if you can appreciate them!"
"Rich golden brown color with lighter hues. Adequate head with off white color head leaving heavy amounts of lace. Tons of aroma--rough citrus rind, spring flowers and much more. Tangy powerful hops. Some malt balance and its a sweet Oktoberfest like malt presence. Citrus hops dominate the taste and its beautiful."
"this is just a great ipa hands down."
"Pours a slightly dark amber/copper color with a fluffy white head. Piny citrus smell, although I did feel the citrus was more in the background. Bold hops starts off tasting of pine, then follows with the grapefruit. For me it was a very clean and dry finish. I really liked this and will be having it again."
"I drank this one straight out of the bottle so I couldn't tell exactly what it looks like but I like the label, simple and definitive which is always a good thing. The smell of this beer is exactly what I would expect out of a west coast style IPA, the floral aroma comes through very solidly along with the bite from the piney scent. Just very fresh in general and entices you to indulge after a long deep smell. The taste does not dissapoint after the strong smell. It has an intense spicy flavor, they used a ton of hops but instead of trying to balance the hop bitterness with some maltiness they used a few different kinds of hops in the beer, citrus flavor hits me pretty well along with the pine I smelled initially. The flower aroma didn't manifest itself as much as in the smell but that is definitely no detriment to the flavor at all. This beer every feels good in my mouth, its not super smooth or anything but that spiciness in the taste has a distinct feel when its in your mouth, almost a tingly feeling before you swallow it which I think is pretty standard with any decent IPA. I found this beer very drinkable, but I also want to reiterate that I love IPA in general and I can drink dIPA all night. This beer was exactly what I expected and wanted it to be, it does not dissapoint as an IPA and I recommend it to anyone who is looking to find a perfect beer for some spicy curry!"
"I'd almost call this a double IPA. Over 7% with almost 100 IBU's. But I guess """West Coast""" IPA implies the 'double'."
"Nice IPA and definitely one to seek out."
"Very tasty high quality beer, rather expensive six pack but worth the money. Big hop flavors matched with a big malt finish. Good beer for those not in love with pine notes or big floral notes. It has rich body that makes it quite smooth and has a good level of bitterness. Not my favorite style of Ipa but a good one to try anyway."
"This beer reminds me why my favorite style of beer is IPA. Whatever the hops they use, I love. The aroma absolutely guarantees a great session by my standards. Pours a medium brown with a thick head that laces from the top to the bottom. The taste matches the aroma, but a little more carbonated than I'd prefer. I could drink this all day a great pace. Highly recommend for the hop head."
"Nice amount of carbonation to lift the bitterness. A nice IPA, but I have been more impressed by some of their other offerings."
"i bet this is legit out of a draught line"
"D: A heavy IPA, close to a DIPA, a sort of tweener beer. If you are a big west coast IPA fan this beer is for you, if you are looking for some depth and breadth I would look elsewhere, but it is really hard to ignore the glorious hoppiness this beer throws in your face."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Hazy orange with a small, off white head. Particles suspended in the beer. (hops?) Lots of lacing left in the glass. Aroma is mild and floral, some pineyness with some maltiness. Big hop punch with a fruity sweetness, finishing long and bitter. Medium bodied and very, very drinkable. A tasty standby SoCal local."
"D: Went down fast, interesting beer. Glad I grabbed a sixer."
"D: Such a great IPA, one of my new favorites."
"From a bomber into a pint glass. Pours a light burnt orange with a nice big white head. The head slowly goes down until it's a llittle smaller than one finger with ok retention and leaves a good amount of lacing down the glass. The smell is pretty strong, mainly pine right up front followed by grapefruit and some citrus. Pretty hoppy. The smell is similar to the taste. Pine and citrus mainly. This one is also pretty bitter compared to other IPAs I've had. Mouthfeel is good no complaints there. This is also very drinkable, not a low or high ABV and good taste. Pretty good stuff, a nice west coast IPA though there would be others I'd take over this one though this one is up there with those."
"Now this is what I'm talking about. I think the west coast produces the best IPAs in the country, which sucks for me since I"""m on the east coast. This beer was served from a bottle into a pint glass in a local bar in the D.C. area. Immediately, I noticed the hop aroma. It was clear and present. The head was there but thin and disappeared as I drank. It was light copper and relatively clear. As I drank the beer, the bitterness grew in my mouth. There wasn't an aftertaste in the classic sense of it, it was just building on me. Even with the increased hoppiness, the beer was still drinkable. A good example of an American IPA."
"Drinkability: Really enjoyed this beer and if it wasn't so expensive on the east coast I would have it quite often. The mouthfeel of it alone makes it great after a day in this hot sun. Great ipa flavor, with a great nose. I prefer a little more balance in ipas, but this is a solid beer."
"Overall, a really nice representation of a west coast ipa. However, it had more caramel that I was expecting. Not to bad. Very drinkable at 7% abv. Well done."
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - Wow, what an outstanding American IPA! The flavors where robust, fruity and earthy, each sip begged for another, I could easily drink a couple pints of the wonderful brew, any more and you would really start to feel that 7.0% ABV. I loved the way the mouthfeel complimented the flavors, and the aroma, forget about it! This was a first for me, as well as the brewery, but let me tell you, it certainly wont be my last. This one is definitely worth seeking out. Cheers!"
"Overall drinkability is good if you like IPAs. Personally, I'm a fan, and I found this go be a very solid brew. Definitely worth a try if you are into hops."
"overall, this one has gotta be right up there for me. it's pricey, especially over here on the east coast but i'd pay it. time and again."
"This is very drinkable."
"Either way, like I said, I still find it to be tasty. Bitterness is a bit high and I wish there was more citrus, those are the two major flaws I find with it. Medium bodied and very oily, I don't get much of a carbonation splash at all. A solid IPA here, but definitely not one of my favorites. I would drink it again in a heartbeat, but probably won't purchase it again unless I knew it was fresh."
"A new favorite! Can I have another one?!?"
"D- This is a very drinkable IPA that makes even people who don't like IPA's which I know and shared this beer with like them for just at least one beer. I would love to get my hands on some more of this when I could."
"Another beer that makes me grateful I live in San Diego. Although I don't believe this is as good as the Hop Head Red that Green Flash puts out, this is an exceptional IPA."
"Serving type: bottle"
"In my opinion Green Flash makes one of the best Double Ipa's out there and they also have a lot of great other extreme and belgian beers. The IPA however is not as great as some of their others or as other ipa's for that matter. Pretty good color aroma and taste and certainly worth a try if you come across it."
"D - This is a great IPA. It really holds up to Pliny the Elder (which I love)."
"D=good, the only thing keeping this from being an all night beer is the ABV."
"A fantastic IPA! Every time I see this in my neck of the woods I grab a few bottles."
"Awesomely hoppy West Coast IPA. For hopheads only. Big bitter, sticky, oily, juicy, pungent, resinous brew. Love it!"
"This beer is much easier to drink than it should be, considering the bitterness. Good stuff."
"Cheers!!!"
"- One I could sit and drink all day... and then later realize that I would be too wasted to do anything but sleep! A great IPA and one of the best to date that I have had!"
"Sampled on draft at Custom Home Pubs in Charlotte. Appearance was a glowing orange. Aroma: Huge citrus, grassy hops. Taste is big and beautifully bitter. Citrus and pine hops really make this a treat for IPA lovers like me. No let-up in the hops in the finish. A delicious IPA."
"everything i look for in an ipa."
"Wow, total hop bomb. This beer pours a deep golden yellow. The smell is fruity. The taste is hops, slapping me in the face with some citrus notes that help to ease the initial blast to the face. The mouth feel is bitter hop, but that's what this beer is all about. I guess they don't mess around when it comes to IPA on the West Coast."
"Drinkability: This is not a muzzled session beer, nor is it a boozy boot to the head: the Flash earnestly deserves that each long draw be appreciated with relish. One could savor a few at leisure over an evening and be glad."
"D: Adds just a little (or takes away some of the bite if you view it that way) to the standard West Coast IPA"
"D - Pretty incredible. This goes down quicker than almost any other IPA I've had, and the 7.3% ABV isn't noticeable in the taste at all. I find myself sometimes really savoring a bottle, while other times I'm hard-pressed to make it last any reasonable amount of time."
"T-Brilliantly spicy, bitter taste that shoots to the back of the throat. Weird has it leaves the tongue so quickly. Very bubbly."
"Mouthfeel is silky smooth but for my tastes it's a bit strong to be sessionable. Overall a good beer though!"
"Overall impression: Excellent IPA."
"A nice clear copper color with a giant clumpy off-white head and big rings of lacing. The aroma is sweet floral and citrus hops and yeasty vanilla. The flavor is full of more bitter hops and most everything but the kitchen sink! As the floral and citrus and herbal hops all collide I get a decided herbal outcome in the final blend with some vanilla malt, and it's superb. Very easy drinking with a mid to light body feel. This is wonderful and an unique managerie of flavors."
"I like balanced beer; I like to taste hops, malt and yeast. This beer is not balanced. I didn't enjoy drinking it and doubt I will order this again. That said, if you're a hophead, this ought to set you right up."
"This is a palate killer. Just too bitter to enjoy more than one in a session. Almost a day of rest is needed after drinking one."
"LOVE IT FOREVER!!!"
"Easy to drink and worth a try. Just not sure I'd try more than one."
"Would for sure recommend to anyone who like a great IPA."
"it's okay. but i've had better. maybe needs to be even fresher?"
"Drinkability: A very tasty brew, and I feel this beer is a classic IPA. Hoppy with a nice bit of malty sweetness at the end to round it off. Very good, I can see myself drinking a few of these in an evening."
"If you know IPAs, you will be treading in familiar territory here."
"notes and comments- this is a great goto ipa...having consumed many draught pints, i can always rely on this beer to be an enjoyable pint"
"Overall: This is a pretty good beer from a pretty good brewery. Not my all time favorite IPA, but definately a solid drink."
"Notes: Great cask IPA. Green Flash has made a monstrously hoppy IPA but it is far from a single note beer. The hop flavors come in layers and add an interesting complexity in its own right. The cask brings down the carbonation just enough to let the flavors blend and show off with still just enough bubbles to be crisp and cleanse the palette. Overall one of the better IPA's I have had in a long time."
"A job well done from the Brew Flash crew. This may become a staple in the man fridge for years to come."
"D: Incredibly drinkable. The hubbub is about AleSmith IPA on the Top 100, but I can't get that one easily, so this is an accessible and nearly-as-good substitute."
"When it comes to the hops, this ale resembles more of an American double IPA than an ordinary American IPA. But the malt doesn't cope with all those hops, making this beer a bit unbalanced."
"Nice beer and lives up to the """west coast""" billing in that it is among the hoppy end of the spectrum of IPAs. Enjoyable and I would have it again."
"Thanks to mikereaser, an excellent trader, for providing me with this beer."
"Drinkability: It's sessionable, but it's alcohol is present. This is a heavier IPA as far as alcohol flavor and availability is concerned. If you're into a very hoppy beer (which San Diego beers are known to be) with interesting taste builds, it can be consumed ad nauseam but much more than two is just filling."
"I only bought one of these and after tasting it I wish I had more. The aroma was wonterful and flowery. There was a nice medium mouthfeel and a nice bold earthy hop first taste. There was a buttery alcohol feel on the lips in the finish and a fairly strong grapefruit component and bitter aftertaste. This is a very good IPA."
"Overall, a top-notch IPA from Green Flash! RichBeer recently sent me a six pack and i am very thankful he did so and will definitely trade for it again!"
"Smell nicely filled the nose with fruity citrus smell and pine. The taste was malty but not too much in your face. The bitterness hit you right away but it was a hop lovers dream. Those 95 ibu's for an American IPA. Overall a damn good west style IPA."
"The ABV is a bit too high, and I don't think I'd want more than one."
"Very, very drinkable. The mouthfeel is light and creamy and finishes dry. Another fantastic CA IPA."
"Hop-tastic! On-tap at the YardHouse in Newport Beach, this beer leaves a lot of lacing on the glass as it's consumed. Right when I got this beer, I could smell the hoppiness, hinting citrus and mango flavors. Equally hoppy in flavor as well. Oily in the mouth, and plenty of resin lingering in the finish. A great experience on draft."
"On draft in a pint glass. Hazy gold with fluffy white head that dissolved fairly quickly to a thin layer. Good lacing. Strong floral nose, with citrus and pine following. Very floral taste (almost too much), definitely getting the citrus (grapefruit especially), and the pine. Not bitter at all, good balance. For a west coast IPA I was expecting more bitter notes and a harsher hop presence. Nice carbonation and body, creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable and refreshing."
"Easy drinking and oh so drinkable. I will be re-visiting this beer in 6-pack form soon."
"Thanks to Nickd717 for the chance to try this one. Appearance is good, nice oily look to it with a minimal head and some lacing. Smell is very good, grapefruity with some hops and slight spice to the backbone of it (peppery). Taste is even better, first couple of swallow are just straight one dimensional hops- which is fine but I appreciate the different levels of them as I sip further. Grapefruit and floral hops really come through and its delicious. There is a bit of alcohol that comes through as well Mouthfeel is oily and medium in body. Drinkability is wow, one of the most drinkable IPA's I have ever had. The hops don't linger, which is good and bad but, overall it means you can session or pound this one."
"This might be my current favorite IPA at the moment."
"The beer is very drinkable and quite delicious. The body isn't syrupy or boozy and I personally like all the hops and bitterness that can be crammed into a beer. The beer could be a little more bitter and dry, but is still great."
"rankings on tasting 1-8 GFlash-2Hrtd-BigEye=Hop3-CorneDuDiable-60min=AlphaKing-Hdevil"
"Overall it's not a bad beer for a bitter but I wouldn't consider it a good IPA."
"Its pours a deeper glowing orange with a finger of dense white head that dissolves into a fine film around the glass. Aroma is fantastic, its filled with a bouquet of hops. From pine to floral to citrus this beer has it. It also has a touch a malt hidden behind those hop scents. Flavor is similar to the aroma, typical west coast IPA (cut the shit and give me the hops.) This beer is sticky in aroma and in the body. I really enjoyed this beer and could make it my regular go to IPA of choice. Delish."
"D - Could and did drink a bunch of these so yea"
"D- Definately not a session beer, but pretty enjoyable to sip on."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with good carbonation."
"A very tasty beer, and it makes me happy to have received it as an extra. I would drink this often, if it was readily available to me."
"Excellent American IPA. It has a taste similar to the Imperial IPA for La Duchesse here in Quebec. Good beer"
"At 7.3% ABV and 95 IBUs, this is one Major League beer. Poured into Samuel Smith Pint Glass, this brew looks tantalizing with a two-to-three inch frothy head that fills the glass. Smell, Taste and Mouthful are all good, but the high ABV drops the drinkability to a still very respectable 3.5. I picked up a six pack of this brew at Friar Tuck in Savoy (Champaign) IL on April 10 so this beer could have been fresher when reviewed, so maybe I will have to pick up another 6 pack and re-do this review at a later date. Still a very good beer and it definitely lives up to its hype."
"D - Very drinkable, one of my favorite IPA's. This one is starting to fade with some age, but it's still a beast."
"A very solid hopped-up West Coast IPA...worth a shot if you're in the hop mood."
"The beer poured cloudy amber with a tinge of red. There was little carbonation, but noticeable particulates present. Dense head that quickly dissipated into a thin layer. There were noticeable grapefruit-like hops plus caramel hints in the aroma. The beer starts with a nice bitterness with grapefruit in the middle and finish and a tad of alcohol. It has a medium mouth feel. I'll be coming back for more."
"Overall, a great! IPA, I get why my buddy orders this... classic west coast IPA. Love the malt aspect in this hop heavy IPA. Go Go Gadget buzz!"
"A great beer! I was a little disappoint when there was no Stone IPA at the store. I got this instead, because it is virtually the same thing, except the Green Flash is just a tad more hoppier. Any who this is a great beer... It's got a lot of bite to it."
"Medium body, dry, extra bitter after taste, smooth with a good level of carbonation and with slightly above average drinkability, the bitterness really got to me. Overall, a solid IPA."
"This is a solid IPA. Good amount of hops and easy to drink."
"Served in an Imperial Pint glass."
"Thanks to washburnkid for this one! Pours a hazy orange color with a small white head that fell to lasting cap and left some very nice lacing. Aroma is a nice mixture of juicy and herbal hops, lightly peppery, a hint of crisp cracker like malt. Smells much like their DIPA, but a little lighter. Flavor is bitter and dry. Plenty of grapefruit rind, a hint of orange and a noticeable spiciness. Finish is dry and lingering. Mouthfeel is medium, crisp carbonation. This is a good West Coast style IPA, but it's really missing what I like the most: fruity, citrusy, and piney hops. This is a bitter beer, and that's pretty much what it has going for it. Other than that, it's a solid IPA."
"D- There's alot going on here, but that won't stop me from getting drunk."
"Goes down nicely especially as the 7.3% abv borders on double ipa territory. Will buy again but wish they'd tell me how fresh it is."
"I don't know what I can add to all the other reviews--it's a wonderful West Coast IPA, grapefruit, lemon and pine on the nose and on the taste, prickly taste, creamy carbonation, with a dry finish. The malt is barely there--it's wonderful if you're in a hoppy mood, but is not particularly complex beyond the hops."
"At 95 IBUs, I knew this would be one bitter, hoppy beer. Knowing this I can't knock it for being unbalanced seeing as they tell you that."
"Had this on tap at Local 44 in Philly. Poured a golden orange with a mild white head that stuck around for a while. Smell of oily and fruity hops. Taste was light malt at first then floral hops and a lingering hop finish. Very complex and layered, great beer for any hophead. Definitely will have again."
"d: I could make this a session beer, not a problem. Others less enthusiastic about the hops may not feel the same way..."
"All in all, this is exactly what I think of when I think west coast IPA. Green Flash does it again! I could easily see myself having a session with this stuff. However, I am more partial to citrus in my pale ales and IPAS. Just one man's preference."
"More proof that some of the best IPAs in the world come from San Diego. If you're looking for balance, I'd look elsewhere, but if it's a phatty hop sandwich you're after, this is a damn fine choice."
"Frankly, it is a little too complex hops-wise to go to this too often."
"Decided to pick up a 6 pack of this one as I saw it at my local shop, $14.00 for a sixer seems a little high but what the heck, I like the stuff I have had from them in the past. This brew pours to a cloudy orange yellow color with a thick off white head that has great retention and leaves a good deal of lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is what you would expect from a west cost IPA, very hoppy nose that gives of a strong pine scent with floral notes, seems that the Centennial hops come out more for me. Slight malt profile there but very much overtaken by the hops. The flavor is nice, the bitterness is there and is aggressive but I thought it would be just all hop but there is a nice malt flavor there as well. This is not to say that this brew is not over the top as far as hops goes, suppose it is, but it plays nice with the other flavors. The hop presence says on the tongue for a long while after. Also mentioned the malt flavor, it comes across semi-sweet with caramel coming to mind. Brew drinks very easy, have limited myself to one per sitting but could easily have a couple. Finishes somewhat dry. Very nice brew, though I do feel that there are others that are as good if not better with a better price point, imagine distributing to the east coast and the newness of the product is driving the cost up ... plus the hop bill."
"D - Goes down pretty smooth. Not much alchohol detected."
"drinkability: pretty good at 7%"
"A nice brew, but you could loose it in the croud"
"With the still-new figurative explosion of craft beer into North Carolina, this is one noobie I have enjoyed each of the numerous times I've bought it. With the emergence of bombers, special singles, and the controversial four-pack, I seldom buy six-packs any more. This is a sixer I see myself almost always considering when I'm making a beer haul. I could enjoy this beer just about anytime and just about anywhere, so I'd say that makes for a high drinkability."
"T: It's an excellent beer that would have a higher score if it wasn't being compared to style to some degree. The difference between a 4, a 4.5 and a 5 for an American IPA is a nebulous space of pure personal opinion. This beer is ever so slightly more bitter than I would like. I love hops and hop bitterness. This beer could just use a tiny bit more malt sweetness to express a pinch more flavor for my tastebuds. I respect Green Flash's choice in the recipe, but it's just ever a wee bit less enjoyable for me than other entries in the style. That said, it's a fantastic beer and I would definitely buy it again/recommend it without hesitation."
"D: Pretty impressed with this brew, much better than the Imperial IPA I had tried earlier. Not quite the best West Coast IPA (I'll defer to Stone and Racer 5) but a darned good example and one worth trying. I'd go out of your way for this one, it's a keeper."
"single from Grape & Gourmet, Virginia Beach, VA"
"This IPA is insane! I would be terrified to try a DIPA from Green Flash, based on this little number. I'm glad I got an opportunity to try this, but it's not really working for me."
"I think I'd come back to this to try it again. Not one of my favorites but I'd like to try it on tap. Not terribly upset I only have one of these."
"this is one very very BIG IPA."
"Green Flash West Coast IPA is a light amber ale with lots of particles in it. It has a soft, foamy off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. It has a fresh, bright, pine-grapefruit aroma with a slightly sweet, resiny malt note. It has a fluffy medium body that's quite flat. It almost seems like it's off cask. The finish is dry and clean. It's quite bitter with a strong flavor of grapefruit peel. There is a very slight touch of sweetness. This is pure Cascade action here. It's an excellent beer that's appropriately named."
"Notes: I am quite impressed with this regular IPA from the good folks at Green Flash. I'm such a friggin' hop-head that sometimes I get caught up in all of the DIPA hype, but is really nice to switch gears with a regular IPA that satisfies my addiction. A nice straight-forward brew that quickly gets down to the nitty-gritty. This one should be in every hop-fiend's regular rotation. Highly recommended"
"Amazing beer. I want more and I'm instantly jealous of all my """former""" San Diegons (where I was born)."
"I live in South Carolina and cant get this beer here, so, I had my Mother-In -Law bring me some from Virginia and Awesome. I have to agree with one of the previous comments . Tastes like chewing on flowers or maybe even fresh cut grass. After reading the different reviews on this beer, I had to get some. It did not let me down.Great taste and never let down through the entire glass. Definitely need to get the folks in SC to get this so I can get it regularly."
"Very tasty and the hops are surely over the top. This is what I was expecting from the west coast IPA. Delicious"
"D: Hop heads this is a really good beer to have!"
"D: Wish they didn't serve em in 1/2 pint glasses; will have to try to find some bottles this summer."
"The beer pours a dark orange-brown color with a fairly thin head. There is a high concentration of floaters in this one. The aroma is hugely hoppy. Mostly grapefruit and lemon citrus with a little bit of pine mixed in. Big and bitter on the palate. A nice robust feel is the conduit to a blast of bitterness. Similar flavors to the aroma with another wave of bitterness toward the end that lasts long after the beer went down. I would prefer a little more balance, but pleasant none the less."
"Verdict: This is a great American IPA, with a hop profile that certainly lives up to the West Coast moniker. Many times when I find myself craving hops I'm not in the mood for an all-out high-ABV hopbomb, and this is exactly the kind of beer I'm after. I'm looking forward to trying the other Green Flash offerings showing up here in Houston (and my fridge)."
"Overall an excellent IPA - very different from others I've had. Highly recommended for the true hop-head."
"pours a beautiful cloudy copper/orange with a lovely head. one finger head with lots of lacing. smells of pine, orange peal..fresh and citrusy. starts off with citrus and a kiss of malt that eases into a smooth hint of pine tar. the finish is pleasantly bitter with those lingering hops. delicious! medium bodied mouthfeel with light carbonation. it is right up there with the best of the west coast ipa's. bravo green flash!"
"very drinkable... but only if you like this 95 ibu type of beer. i can have more than one, but could i have say, a malty lager after this? probably not. ok, i could but i don't think i'd taste much of it. this is another """sandpaper the tongue""" type beer... which is fine with me!"
"on my mission to try everyones varieties of ipa's i put this at the top. with a smash in the mouth taste, all these different hop signature characters do their jobs extemely well!. if you like the """piney""" ipas, then this should please you. it is hoppy, but has a lot to offer. their hop head red is also a great find!!!."
"I had this beer at a local pub in my area (porter's pub), i've had numerous IPA's (i am a true hophead), this one standed out to me as one of the best if not the best i've ever had. Definately more appealing to me then your average IPA. Has a unique crisp feel to it that alot of IPA's don't have. I don't know why maybe a little less malt than other brands? Anyway the hop flavor dominated my palate more than i had expected for a single IPA. This beer may be even more hoppy than numerous double IPA's i have tried but without the thick and syrupy feel. If you ever get the chance to try this beer on tap - do not turn it down. I ended up having 4 of these in a row because of how pleased i was with it. West coast IPA's are clearly dominant in this style."
"This beer is great for the hop lover. A very hoppy IPA with a good amount of complexity to keep it interesting."
"Pours an amber coloredcolored body, clear, with a creamy white color head, huge but diminishing. Has a grapefruity aroma, with some sweet maltiness. Somewhat smooth watery taste, bitter aftertaste. Okay but not much body."
"Drinkability.... Pretty dry finish. Bitterness is a wave that breaks somewhere before the swallow, making each sip a somewhat thrilling experience."
"If you're looking for a hop dominant beer, then here you go. The beer relies upon the hop's song and dance to carry the beer with very little interference from the malts or other nuances. Hop complexity is here, but complexity from other beery aspects are kept at bay."
"A good IPA, but nothing real special in my book, especially being one of the highest priced standard IPA's I have ever had at over $12 a 6pk."
"Most of all a bitter hop bomb. For those who worship balance don't bother, Pours nice, very decent head, minimal nose. Bitter from start to finish, but I like this style. Nice to have one or two, but that's about max. A very one sided brew, and not very complex. If a bitter ale is your thing look no further, kinda like Ruination with less alcohol. This is my second six so I gave it some thought and volume before reviewing."
"Thank you Mike for the oppertunity to try this one out!"
"This beer was served a hazy, hazy copper color with an off white half finger head that receded to a film. There is wispy, spotty lacing left on the glass. Nose is of grassy and floral hops, bit of a bisuity scent mixed in as well. Taste starts with strong floral hops, bit of grassy, earthiness in the taste which then leads in to a big strong citrus finish - some lemon and grapefruit are detectable on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium body, slightly oily on the tongue and a very bitter aftertaste. This is a highly drinkable beer!"
"D - If you like hop bombs then this is a good beer for you excellent IPA that got me my hop fix for the night worth trying sometime"
"D - A nice IPA. Could easily have a couple of these because the alcohol is very subtle for it's ABV content. Another great ale by Green Flash as you must also try their Hop Head Red Ale."
"O: Man candy all the way. Bring it on! Mmmm, good. Only bummer is that it is too strong for a session. This is what I wish more AIPAs would emulate. Maybe a tiny bit less bitterness would be more pleasant."
"D - Very drinkable for an IPA. This beer is definitely all about showcasing the hops, but a good malt balance keeps them from being overwhelming. There also seems to be a good balance of the hop character between pine and citrus, rather than letting one overwhelm the other."
"Hazy murky orange color with a half inch of head, leaves some nice sticky lacing. Smell is of pine and citrus, a little sweetness comes through, but this is a very dry tasting beer. Taste is lots of pine and citrus, slick medium bodied mouthfeel with medium carbonation. The bitterness is very pronounced on the back of tongue and roof of mouth. Long piney earthy resinous bitter finish. A very dry IPA, showcases the hops. Very drinkable if you like the style."
"A very good IPA from the land of great IPAs. I never have a problem ordering this, but sometimes it gets lost in the shuffle when some of its neighbors from surrounding breweries are also available. Great for those who love grapefruit bitterness."
"Medium brew bites your tongue and lingers. Dries out your tongue and beckons you to drink more and more..."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A well made Ipa to say the least. It reminds me of Weyerbacher Double Simcoe and Sierra Nevada's Torpedo a bit."
"Pours an absolutely gorgeous amber with a finger and a half of head that receded gradually. Moderate carbonation can be seen rising through the beer, and light flows pretty freely. No floaters or yeast visible. THe head is remarkable -- big, piney, hops -- exactly what one would expect from a """West Coast I.P.A.""" The flavor is definitely what I would expect, with a great hop bitterness on the end -- certainly a unique bitterness. I don't know if I would say it's as challenging as IPAs from Russian River, Stone, or AleSmith, but it's certainly a pleasure to drink. The mouthfeel is light, with moderate carbonation. At 7% it won't go down too quickly, letting the beer warm and some more character to come out. Definitely enjoyable, but it's not in the top 10 of its class. I'd recommend picking one up if you see it, though."
"Another great session IPA with the perfect bitterness, well balanced, for hopheads - yummy. Leaves a fruity aftertaste of hops."
"I feel that overall this is a great beer. I love hoppy beers and this one did not disappoint me at all."
"With a 7.3 ABV & 95 IBUS this beer satisfies this hop heads idea of a world class brew. Well done Green Flash!"
"D - A little too much of a hop-bomb for me, but I think that the drinkability is pretty high"
"Taste is a little tame comparatively but still solid. Lighter on the grapefruit, heavier on the grass, more flat out bitter than anything else."
"Pours out opaque golden amber with nice white head, very good lacing. Smell is not very strong for an AIPA. However, what is there has hints of floral notes. That goes on to the taste, which hits you with floral bitterness up front and mellows rather quickly. The mouthfeel is just right for a good everyday AIPA."
"I got this in 6 pack form a month or so ago on a recommendation. Poured it into a small pilsner glass. The appearance is slightly hazy and orange. The aroma is very hoppy and has a very strong citrus smell. The taste is very surprising and kind of refreshing. You are hit with hops right away and then you get a grapefruit flavor in the finish. I think they should rename this west coast grapefruit IPA. The drinkability is very good I could drink more than one or two of these. The mouth feel is good but is like most other IPA's. I will drink this beer again."
"Fair carbonation keeps this one from being too much of a bitter pill to swallow. Decent aftertaste. Overall, not bad, But lacking in depth. I did notice the alcohol though, so there was that palate cleansing element, but that's it. Try it and move on."
"This one is dominated by the piney hops that at some points tend to get quite grassy. The hops are traditional to the west coast style of a slick feel that coats the tongue with an oily feeling and leaves quite a bitter aftertaste. I like my IPA's to have more of a fruity taste which is missing in this one. Probably will pass on this one next time."
"Drinkability: To me this is a strong hop bomb. If you love hops, you will love this beer. I find this one very one dimensional and will be passing for more interesting IPAs."
"Very tasty IPA, very drinkable. Thanks to Sparky27 for sending this one on."
"Smell is wonderful floral and citrus hops. Very nice. Taste is the same, but there's a nice bite to it. This is an incredible IPA that would stand up to some DIPA's. Good and refreshing on the mouthfeel. Well done."
"Thin head but practically immobile, once it sets it's there, densely packed small bubbles, moderate lacing. Super cloudy orange to bronze color, for all of its murkiness amplifies light well. The nose plays it straight up, loading up on the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus, pine resin, warm tar and cut green grass, no malt presence, just sprints forward with that narrow band of hoppy scents. Medium-bodied, just about the same story in the mouth but the tactile dimension gives it more range. The grapefruit, orange, lemon citrus remains at the head of the class, pine, orange pekoe tea, violets, bitters follow on. Small sized portion of apricot, peach, nectarine fruit. Carbonation does not interfere with its overall sinewy mouth feel, snakes through the mouth through to an elongated finish. Not particularly complex but does pick the right parts to emphasize."
"D- eal drinkable i could sit down and drink a few of these"
"Would definitely get this again."
"D: For the style it is pretty drinkable."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a nice copper color with a 1 finger pillowy head that goes away quickly. Pine, citrus, grapefruit, floral smell. This beer is assault on your pallate with the hops. I love the bitterness. Carbonation is just right and the beer goes down very smooth. I love the hops so i find this beer to be very enjoyable and drinkable. There is a malt backbone in there but the hops definitely dominate this brew. Well done green flash."
"This bear was ALL about the hops. A proper introduction to an American IPA."
" Taste is initailly sweet and malty, the hops hit fast and hard and dominate with oily floral , herbal and piney goodness until the dry bitter finish. Damn , this is good. Mouthfeel is medium and the carbonation is just right."
"A very good beer."
"D: I know 7% isn't very drinkable for a lot of people, but its around my average so I find this to be very drinkable. I will definitely buy more of this!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the drinkability is pretty good."
"Was very excited to try this after having the Hop Head Red the other night. Pours a orangeish golden color with a decent creamy head. Smells of boldly of hops as would be expected. Taste was disappointing with a very underwhelming flavor with a tinny aftertaste. Under carbonated in my opinion for this medium bodied IPA. I wouldn't have had another of these if I had one. I will try it again to see if my taste buds were off but based on this review very average in the taste department."
"D: A hophead's dream. Extremely hoppy and quite enjoyable."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle..Perfectly clear deep amber/copper coloured body with strong ruby highlights and a thinnish white head. Aroma of very fresh grassy hops along with citrus notes, perfumy notes and even more hops! Medium-bodied; Strong hop bitterness up front fading to a good malt backbone then back to some citrusy type hops. The aftertaste shows a lot of the hops with a bit of the grassyness from above and a good bit of malt. Overall, a good IPA."
"Is very drinkable and trying it a second time I liked it a lot better."
"On tap at the Yardhouse in Long Beach. Aroma is hop forward. There is no mistaking that it is an IPA. Color is an amber color that is clear with a nice creamy beige head. Nice lace all the way down the glass. Flavor is hop assertive with a clean malt profile of biscuits and toast. Clean finish and easy drinking. A very nice IPA."
"D: Not exactly a sessionable IPA, really a thin DIPA, the hops tend to wreck my palate after two, and everything tastes pretty bland after that. A damn good IPA if you're into hops though. Good beer all around, just not one I'd put back all night."
"D: This beer is pretty good. Frankly, I had to let it warm a bit because the flavor is pretty damned bitter. Warm, it is easy drinking and almost poundable. Cold, not so much. Its a bit too much at times. The hops are very well showcased in the aroma and flavor profile. If you don't like hops, this is not your beer. A few years ago, I would have hated this beer. My girlfriend was disgusted after she sampled it. It takes a slightly more developed palate to enjoy this, or someone who just plain likes bitterness. good stuff though!"
"Cheers to Green Flash."
"Very satisfying."
"I will forever compare all IPA's of this quality to SNPA, which was my gateway hop beer. But man, are they getting better everyday or what? This beer in one word, SOLID...straight across the board."
"Whoa! I've had this now on-tap and in the bottle. From the bottle, the beer comes off much creamier, with a lusty off white thick frosty head, lacing and a load of retention. The nose is incredibly pungent and you know you are in for a wallop. The piney notes and oily hop esters are screaming out from the glass. Everything said about this on-tap holds true for the bottle version, just in more acute fashion. The beer is very, very acerbic with an extremely tart, grapefruity, pungent hop bite. It is even more imbalanced in bottle form than on-tap. Good, but definitely one for big time hop heads. L'Chaim."
"Sierra Nevada with a huge pair! Love it. Nice remake GF. These guys know what they are doing!"
"Cheers!"
"Poured a cloudy rusty tan. Bout a finger of head. Smelled strongly of piney citrus. Tastes of citrus and pine, but there is a caramel background to it though. Fair bitterness, not too much, which makes it more drinkable. I'd say between APA and IPA. but still very good."
"D- amn this stuff is good!"
"Pours a cloudy, hazy, bubble-less blond color. Wow the smell is exploding with citrus and pine. Taste is at first tobacco leaf, grapefruit, hops. Mouthfeel is oily, smooth at first then finishes with a great hop bitterness. Excellent cask beer, would love to try this on tap or the bottle."
"Besides Stone, this was the first experience I have had with a west coast IPA. I have to say I want to go visit California now. This beer has a good balance and just enough hops to give you a kick in the teeth when it wants to."
"A picture of my own: http://flickr.com/photos/20883076@N05/3206595559/"
"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Head was decent, gone in a matter of seconds though. Beautiful color, dark orange with brown hues. Lacing is evident from the start. Tastes very sweet at first for an IPA, but then I suppose the 95 IBU's sneak up on you, leaving a very bitter aftertaste. I like hops, but this is a good amount of bitter hops. Mouthfeel is smooth, has good viscosity for an IPA. All in all, it's as good as expected but I think I'll stick to my Stones and Dogfish IPA's."
"The mouth is oily and coating. I like this beer, but drinkabilty suffers a tiny bit from the lack of balance. Still, well worth seeking out and a nice example of a West Coast IPA."
"Drinkability: Again, this one is for those who adore the Racer 5s and Stone IPAs of the world. I'll usually drink this one last in a session, as you can't taste anything afterwards. But in a good way."
"Excellent IPA, I want more, unfortunately I dont see this on the east coast that often."
"This is a very tasty IPA indeed. Definitely up there in the top 15 of IPAs, if that means anything anymore."
"D= really high. Thanks to kadonny for this one. Its a very unique and fantastic beer. Grass flavor comes through very nicely. Its awesome."
"A nice teaser - I'm definitely interested in checking out some of Green Flashes more exotic offerings."
"Overall a decent IPA but compared to others that I have had this is down on the list. A little to hoppy for me without a nice counterbalance."
"D - Don't usually like IPA's but the bitternress is wearing on me and I;m beginning to see the glory of hops. West Coast is a Good IPA. Makes me want to drink more."
"D - I want more! This is super tasty, goes down easily, and is very refreshing. Good sessionability, and also really makes me want to go back for more."
"Drinkability? Perfect. This may not be the best IPA out there (I think Ballast Point's Sculpin is the winner there), but its wide distribution (in CA), and availability as a 6-pack, make this beer a great """standby""" drink for any hop-head that doesn't feel like cracking a 22oz bomber of something."
"Strong hop smack right off the bat. Deep grapefruit-like bitterness. This is the epitome of the west-coast style. I am loving this. Great crisp mouthfeel. Could drink a couple of these. Recommend."
"Damn good IPA. Nice pour, with turbulence down to the bottom of the glass. Nice head, golden color. The smell of hops was pronounced, but the flavor was total fresh hops. Pretty distinctive. The beer was nicely effervescent and drank a treat. Pity I only had the one bottle. If this were available in my area I'd get it pretty regularly. Thanks to johnfromohio for the bottle."
"D - I'm an IPA fan...and this is a great beer...everyone should try this style at some point!"
"A nice example of a highly hopped IPA, but lacks the balance of a truly fantastic version of the style."
"I find I'm drinking this rather quickly, it's so tasty, and alas, I've got only the single bottle. Overall, this is definitely a winner for the hopheads who like at least a modicum of balance in their IPAs, myself included."
"Left out of fridge about 15 minutes before opening. Pours a wonderful burnt orange hue with a large rocky head. Typical yet wonderful west coast hop aroma. Slightly sweet as it warms. Nice viscous mouthfeel. Drinkability has always been top notch. Have 5 more that may not see tomorrow."
"D - Very drinkable. Well balanced. Would be able to drink several of these."
"Drinkability: My goodness I could drink this stuff all day and not try any other beer. Just love this stuff."
"Please go get some and drink joyfully!"
"D: Smooth, slightly unbalanced. Goes down well. Very solid brew."
"8/4/8/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"This beer is soooo goood!1it kicks the butt out of some triple IPA's and Imperials, and its only a IPA-but Cali Style, super hoppy, piney, high alcohol content, this is more of a sipping IPA, dur to the overwhelming hop presence. But over all an Excellent Beer!!!! if have reached a stagnant beer stage, and want something new and ruthless Go with West Coast IPA- or any Green flash Beer!"
"This one was everything I had trusted it would be. Big and hoppy but still so drinkable. A must try."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip. This beer pours a bright orangey amber with a rocky 3 finger off white head that leaves ample lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is hops, mostly apricot and mango but also a bit off fresh cut grass. Not surprisingly, hops dominate the aroma, leaving my tongue in anticipation of what was about to come. The flavor is big hops. Dried Apricots are the major flavor with hints of mango, pine and grass. I have to say that it almost has a fake apricot flavor to it. A bit strange to me. The aftertaste is a nice bitter finish, making you long for another sip. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it leaves a nice coating of hoppy residue all over the mouth. This is a good IPA, something I would love to drink again."
"D: This is a beer meant to finish a session, not begin. My tastebuds were destroyed by this beer and required quite a while to recover. Over all, an awesome AIPA!"
"Not my favorite IPA, but definitely a memorable one."
"This had a satisfying hop bite, but was a little on the piney side for me. Certainly full of hop flavor, but the bitterness sort of blotted out the rest of the beer. I would have liked to have some of the other flavors stand out and back up the hops."
"D: A big hopped beer that will satisfy in limited quantities. Hop dominated, sticky and sweet at times will definitely remind you what a west coast ipa is all about."
"If I were to turn a Mexican beer into an IPA, I imagine this is what up would taste like. Pours clear gold with a, off-white head. Aroma is bitter hops and malt. Taste is very nice. Strong hops all the way through. A very bitter IPA, but a very good one."
"D: Average, many better west coast IPAs to indulge in."
"Overall this is a good IPA that doesn't disappoint or put itself at the front of the pack"
"D: I could drink quite a bit of this beer; It leaves its flavor in your mouth, reminding you of what you're missing if you don't have another."
"D - Pretty good. You could have three of these before you would start to lose appreciation. There are several American IPAs that are more drinkable but this certainly is not the worst of them."
"I hadn't had a bottle of this in a while and I DON"""T KNOW WHY! Just a great representation of the West Coast style IPA and probably thee best example that actually gets decent distribution. I really need to keep more of this around."
"The West Coast IPA is such solid brew. The price to value is even stronger, as it doesn't break the bank to have a sixpack in the fridge. As far as IPAs go (I am a big fan, but admittedly, no expert), this is in the upper echelon."
"D: Wonderful beer. Good thing I can get it as a six-pack!"
"It is more pricey than some as west coast IPAs tend to be, but this one is worth the price!"
"Pours a clear amber with a sticky off-white head than leaves a nice ring of lace. Smells hoppy. Quality and quantity as far as the hops go. The label tells me that Simcoe, Columbus, Centennial and Cascade hops are all present. I love the smell of this beer. Pungent to say the least. Most hop characteristics are present and easily distinguished. I am reminded of hops trouble-making cousin. Has a sticky malty back to hold up against the bitterness of the hops but the hop flavor and aroma are prevalent. A solid West Coast IPA Representative. Fulll-bodied with enough carbonation to fight off the sticky sweet."
"Pours a dark amber color with foamy white head. Very hoppy aroma balanced by caramel malt presence. Flavor very similar to arom. Very quaffable IPA with a nice sweet maltiness balancing out the bitter hops."
"D- Very easy to drink"
"D - At 7%, it's a bit bigger than the standard IPA, but my favorite by far, so goes down soooo good!"
"D - This one is bitter but not a tough one to drink for a hop lover."
"Pours a slightly cloudy orange amber with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly, but leaves lace on the sides of the glass. Aroma sends out lots of grapefruit, pine and resin. Very clean floral pleasant hop aroma with little malt found. Taste is bitter hoppy with very little malt again. Resinous aftertaste makes you crave another sip. Medium to thin body, oily mouthfeel, ample carbonation. Great little hop bomb, very clean citrus/floral hop aroma and taste. Well done! Wish I could get this local."
"So much raw hoppage!, this is very West Coast. The sheer hop magnitude gets in the way of my carelessly enjoying this one. My stomach even kind of hurts; and I sure don't want two in a row. As much of a hop-head as I am, this is borderline too-hardcore to be cool. I don't like to shun a beer for being overly hoppy, so I won't. Instead, I'll say that either my palate is too young or too sensitive to appreciate this hop-bomb. Respect."
"D_A middle of the road IPA. Nothing offensive here but nothing that really stands out and grabs you."
"Well done Green Flash, and thanks."
"This one has plenty of body too. Carbonation adds slightly to the hoppy bitterness and the smooth caramel adds a stickiness to the palate. A wonderful IPA. On the bitter side but all around a very solid IPA."
"D: One of the best beers I've had recently. A terrific IPA that I hope to visit again."
" Overall - almost too hoppy. Any malt presence is masked by the hops. I would find it hard to have more than one without risking long term damage to ones taste buds."
"D: I wouldn't consider this incredibly drinkable. That being said, it is refreshing and will cure a hop craving."
"Drinkability - This is a really tasty beer. I could probably drink several of these, but I don't think I'd really enjoy more than two or three."
"D/M: Heavy carbonation, medium to heavy texture."
"The malt notes are strong up front with caramel and roasted tones and a chewy, thick quality that might be attributed to the """floaties""" I mentioned earlier. The hops then kick in nicely, with plenty of juicy citrus and a satisfying lasting bitterness. The balance is terrific and is held up well by the even texture. You know it's an IPA but it's not a pure hop bomb and for me that's okay. This is a first class AIPA and I can't recommend it highly enough."
"Standard IPAs don't hit the spot much more than this for me. Exactly what I'm looking for. Go get some."
"Since i moved to CA, this has turned into my go-to beer. Its great! Pours a nice light brown with hints of red. Quarter-inch head falls off to a lacy covering. Smells sort of non-descript, actually...like a run-of-the-mill IPA that maybe has a bit too much sweet malt in there. Some citrusey, piney hops break through, but the smell doesn't do the flavor justice. Taste is a big piney, citrusy hop smack, not too big, with a smooth malt backbone. Bitterness is there in a nice balance with the hop flavors. Medium bodied, with not too much carbonation and a little hint of a syrupy feel. Tastes refreshing and delicious. Approaching perfect for the style in flavor and drinkability."
"A must try for not only every hophead, but all beer lovers. Fresh, clean and hoppy. Not an everyday drinker for me, but it is comforting to have a few on hand chillin' in the fridge. Tough call between this and the Two-Hearted ale for me."
"One of the best ipa's i've had to date. If anyone feels like sending me a case of this, bring it on :-) Recommended!"
"D - Kick ass IPA! I'd definitely buy this again. It's one of the most drinkable IPAs I've had in a while."
"Other than that, excellent. If this were a local beer it's one that I'd have in the fridge most of the time, right next to my Furious. Just rec'd a Green Flash Imperial IPA in the mail today - I'm not sure how much better that could be. Hats off to Green Flash."
"This is incredibly drinkable, and having loved this so much, I decided to try their DIPA, but I found this to be much better. The DIPA didnt have quite the hops that my palate has come to require for the style."
"Gorgeously clean and crisp amber pour with tall bubbly foam, nice lacing. Strong wonderful hop oils weigh the nose down with sappy pine and orange bitterness. Unmistakable cannabis aroma when the beer warms. The 95 IBUs hit with a bang. There's no way around it. Medium, oily mouthfeel with tame carbonation. Certainly for hop lovers. No malt nonsense. All hops. My kind of IPA and very close to DIPA territory."
"Would say to all... try it. It has it's own character but nearly the same as the other IPAs out theie."
"Drinkability- This thing is absolutely terrific and I'm taken totally by surprise. It's highly drinkable and somehow remains to be a hop bomb. It's paradox in a bottle! Ridiculously tasty brew that should be sought out. Big thanks to Matt or Adam!"
"Overall: sent one out as a trade extra, wish I had kept it!"
"I've heard alot about this beer, and the experience lived up to the hype. Hops are my second love (malt first, baby), and this brew helps reaffirm it, and maybe even makes the maltsters a little jealous of my affinity for it. Great drink, right at the line of being too high in the abv department to drink more than 2 or so, but I'd certainly like another and am disappointed I only had one bottle. Recommended."
"Overall a shining example of the style. Certainlay aptly named. If someone asked me what does a West Coast IPA taste like, this would certainly be a go to to introduce them to the style, as well as being a good go to for the beer geek's session as well. A good solid IPA, and one i would most defenitely reccomend for all you hopheads out there. Very nice beer."
"d. Drinkability is spot on. I wish I had a few more to drink. One 12oz. just wasn't enough. Crisp and refreshing for a strong IPA. The fruitiness and floral aspects keep the hop bitterness at bay and make it smooth and pleasant for a hop-heavy IPA."
"D: I am a huge fan of IPAs, so I would classify this beer as a """session""" beer, however, the bitterness may overwhelm you after three or four! Very highly recomended."
"Overall I enjoy IPAs that are a little off balance in favor of floral and pine hops over citrus and malt. This one balanced everything quite nicely."
"D - Any amount you can throw at me in one night would be a welcome gesture. Ken, thanks for the chance to try this beer."
"D: Good drinkability, the 7% is barely noticeable. This is probably one of my favorite west coast IPA's that is readily available here in MA."
"Overall, a spectacular IPA from Green Flash. Try this if you are in the the mood for tons of hops!"
"Drinkabliity is good. I could have another, especially on a cooler day."
"pours a nice cloudy amber color with an intense white head that retains nicely, great lacing. smell is seriously hopy. citrus. and more hops. tastes great. nice bite. bitter into a sweet subtle finish. just enough carbonation. this is a very refreshing beer. a great ipa. mouth feel is awesome. i could drink this on a regular basis."
"Poured into a 12-oz mug, this beer is a nice reddish-amber color with a modest head and decent lacing. The nose is quite full of resinous/piney hop aroma... excellent hoppy aroma, worthy of being swirled around and sniffed for a good long time. The taste, likewise, is all hops: close to overwhelming resin flavor, very high bitterness, nothing but hops... even the ultra hoppy DFH provide some malt balance compared to this. It's a close call, but it's a bit too one-dimensional for my taste."
"Overall: I will buy again...I'm just amazed that this exceptional beer is available in Vancouver!"
"D- not hard yet not easy for me. Like i said if you like hoppy beers you would like this. It is too dry and bitter for me. I have grown to like IPA's and this one reminds me of why i used to dislike them. a decent beer overall."
"Poured from a bottle into a SweetWater pint glass. Pours a deep orange. Not much of a head on this one. Decent amount of lacing on the glass. Very hoppy aroma with some pine and citrus in there as well. Taste starts off as sweet, citrusy, and some pine and finishes pretty bitterly. Moderate amount of carbonation. A very drinkable brew."
"pours a very peachy color with a fair white head and good lacing. The aroma is great! grapefruit, floral hops, subtle spicy hops, subtle lemon, hints of sweet malts. the taste is good but different. starts out as a typical IPA (grapefruit, lemon, hops) but finishes very oddly. strange bitterness, like a fusion of bitter hops and dry malts. medium bodied, medium carbo, dry finish"
"Not the greatest West Coast IPA of all time, but certainly a great example of one. A must try and a welcome addition to my fridge."
"D. Pretty good for an IPA. Not quite as good as a Stone IPA IMO, but still a worthy offering and one I will be having again."
"This gal is bitter..."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very slick in the mouth. The hop resin seems to coat my tongue and linger long after the drink is gone. A very drinkable IPA."
"D - Nothing special in the way of IPAs several others I enjoy"
"Overall, Green Flash West Coast IPA is an awesome IPA that packs the hop flavor. Recommended."
"Quite yummy and very drinkable. Will need more please."
"The finish is almost dry but the hops do not linger like some IPAs. Way too drinkable :)"
"Now this is an example of a west coast IPA, as depicted by the name. As soon as you pop the top, you get a very pungent smell of hops, definitely the most distinctive characteristic of this brew. One of the most bitter IPA's I have had, but at the same time not over the top. It's still very drinkable. I love it, and will seek it out anytime it's available to me."
"Drinkability is excellent. I would definitely stock up on this brew if it ran less than $15 a 6 pack. For now though, I'll enjoy the rest of the sixer that I've got and maybe buy some more in a few months. It might be sessionable but definitely don't plan on driving after that session."
"D: A nice, drinkable IPA with a good combination of mouthfeel and taste. A smooth and easy going beer that I could drink for a while. A very nice brew."
"HV"
"When poured in the glass, the color was a hazy amber with an orange hue. The smell of hops was not overpowering. But, hops was all I could smell on this IPA. The flavor was weak for me. I picked up a weak flavor of hops and that was it. The finish was bitter, dry, but again, not much of a flavor, just hops."
"overall: awesome IPA, one of my favorites and ive had as many as I have been able to get my hands on. If it wasnt for the abv id say its an awesome session beer since its so tasty and pleasurable to drink. If you like IPA's, this one is an absoulte must try."
"Extreme, over the top, unique! Great as a finish beer to a session of IPA's!"
"Pours a clear amber, very thick and chunky white head, big bubbled ring forms around the glass along with a solid layer, drops a ton of lace. Smell is awesome, big pine and grapefruit, caramel, orange rings, some floral, very hoppy. Taste is pine and grapefruit, more rind, tangerine, jasmine and green tea, grain, caramel, and a thick bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very smooth and drinkable. Very nice IPA, I'd drink this all day if I could. Thanks Russ!"
"I applaud Green Flash for this slightly different IPA. I will definitely be picking up a quantity of this to continue to enjoy. This is the kind of beer that I could envision sipping on all evening."
"Pours a dark golden, almost amber color with a thick rocky head. Boatloads of hop aroma, with grapefruit and citrus notes. A true San Diego IPA. The flavor is well-balanced even with the massive amounts of hops used. Lots of lace, good CO2. Extremly drinkable."
"It should be noted that I had this several months ago at the Falling Rock and really enjoyed it. Seems likely that this would be better on tap."
"As far as Calli IPAs go...this rocks...I use Stone IPA as my benchmark Calli IPA...This is a definite contender...you can smell the hops from the glass, when it is put infront of you...The dry hoppiness contributes to the crisp character....If you are a hop head...this should be on your list."
"A great beer. Hops heads like myself will love it. It's also pretty drinkable, the bitterness doesn't last long enough to destroy it's drink-ability. Highly recommended."
"D- A decent offering from green flash it offers some tropical notes but mainly focuses on big resinous hops. If you love straight hops this is a beer for you. Green Flash doesn't seem to greatly concentrate on balancing its brew with malts. both the ipas I've had were just hops hops hops."
"Had on tap at the Moan and Dove. Very dark, murky orange-gold color with great lacing. Very, very rich hop and citrus aromas. Taste was awesome except for the lingering bitterness that became annoying after awhile. Still, this drink was an awesome flavored IPA. Mouthfeel had a decent texture to it, making it seem a little thick due to the tons of ingredients in it. However, it was not like some IPA's I have had where I needed a spoon to drink them. Overall, a great IPA."
"Was pretty excited to see this one in my local's fridge; didn't think we got Green Flash stuff out here, and I'd been hearing a fair bit about it on the boards. Looks excellent. Huge, frothy head that takes its time dissolving, over a nice amber beer. Excellent lacing. Looks exactly how an IPA should. Nose is great as well. Extremely spicy hops, both piney and fruity. Light toffee malt, but this is unquestionably a malty brew. Aromas are maybe a touch mild. Flavor's a hop bomb, and it's a total surprise given the fairly smooth nose. Huge drying hops up front, and this one is just hoppy as hell throughout. Drying, piney, hoppy bitterness all over the place. Light breadiness. Maybe a hint of malt in the background. Honestly, it might be a touch unbalanced for me, with the hops overwhelming just a bit too much to make it a masterpiece. Feel is excellent, with great body and good carbonation. The drinkability takes a slight hit because of the huge hopiness, but it's still one I would definitely enjoy again."
"A vigorous pour produced an almost non existent head on this beer. Strange. Cloudy, copper colored. Smells extremely floral, citrusy, and tropical. Flavor is more citrus hops, very balanced, fruity, pineapples, strong grapefruit presence, strong bitter finish that lingers on the pallette. Very tasty IPA. Mouthfeel has a good body but my beer is pretty flat. I think I got a dud bottle. Going to have to grab another one. Extremely tasty IPA though and would be excellent with some carbonation and a head atop the brew. Extremely drinkable IPA."
"On tap at Papago's in Scottsdale, AZ. Color is a deep yellow with a minimal head. Smells strongly of citrus, but the taste is a bit two-dimensional. Strongly bitter, with a narrow range of citrus flavor, but it just doesn't quite achieve the level of multiple citrus flavor that the best San Diego IPS get. Still a very good beer, and quite drinkable."
"T: Body has strong slightly sweet malt background and then tons of citrus and grapefruit hop bite. Very smooth, creamy body with perfect carbonation. However, the sweetness and citrus cover leave the finish lacking in bittnerness which makes this very drinkable, but not quite what expected for the style."
"This is definitely in the upper echelon of IPAs, but may be a bit too bitter and hoppy for some, but for a hophead like me, it's like liquid heaven."
"Overall, this is an outstanding IPA that definitely teeters on being a double IPA. If it came in a fancier bottle and was more difficult to find, I think people would make a much bigger fuss about it."
"On tap at Coronado Brewery. Golden with a an average white head. The aroma is lemon, grapefruit, orange, pine and spicy hops. Almost smells like Fruit Loops. The taste is similiar to the aroma. Dry and bitter throughout with a heavy bitter finish. This is a very flavorful beer."
"What's not to love about this beer? Nothing. Green Flash has brewed what may well be the standard for west coast IPAs. It's a very refreshing and drinkable beer that commands a lot of respect. Highly recommended."
"Side note: Totally agree with the previous poster's comments about West Coast IPA's having their own sub-category. I think I may be turning into a West Coast IPA snob, which could be a problem on the banking account. Had this on tap (Moe's tavern) as well, and I was worried that the bottle serving type would be a let down. Fortunately, I was wrong, which in my opinion makes this even a better beer. As of right now, this one is my favorite."
"Drink me again"
"D - I'd buy it again but admit my palate is simply either not ready for this or it's not my preferred style. Don't get me wrong, I love hops but one should be able to detect something more."
"I've had this many times before but I'm only now getting around to reviewing it. True to its name, this is a great west coast style IPA. It was a staple in my fridge in California last summer, and has become the same now that Green Flash is now available in NC. It's great to see Green Flash getting a wider distribution."
"This drinks well; would drink even better with a little more grapefruit in the hop profile - its absence was a bit of a surprise. All in all, good stuff!"
"D- Excellent brew, very crisp and easy to drink."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. great hop depth. really liked this one."
"It's not a session or pounding beer, definitly a slow drinker as it has a a really strong personality."
"D-the 1st one deadens the taste buds so more can easily be had. Don't move on to something less hoppy or it will taste like malt water due to yout destroyed taste buds."
"I would recommend this beer to anyone who is a true IPA lover. Great auroma and flavors."
"The flavor is well-balanced with the aggressive hops shining through. the finish is pretty long and dry. A nice West coast IPA that I am quite fond of."
"Occasionally, as with this beer, reality supports the hype. Take this six-pack, with a few close friends and watch the sun settle down below the horizon in hopes of spotting that elusive green flash."
"Good body and carbonation. This is pretty much what I expected. Very good."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a copper color with a nice frothy inch and a half off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. The aroma is mainly citrusy (grapefruit) and piney hops, with a bit of caramel malt too. Taste is similar to the aroma, it's mostly grapefruit and pine hops along with some bready and caramel malt. There's also a nice lingering bitter hoppy aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's chewy and oily with low carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink and enjoyable. Overall I think this is a pretty decent IPA, I'd pick it up again."
"Wonderful medium bodied American IPA. It has all the flavors and smells of an imperial but not so much that it hammers you over the head with hops. Easy to drink and hard not to enjoy."
"This is a really nice IPA. The bitterness reaches a high peak but mellows out to reveal a nice oakiness. Tastes great cold and is quite easy to drink. Goes well with some spicy Mexican food. Not my favorite IPA, but a very nice beer that has some unique characteristics."
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a deep cloudy copper color ale with a good size foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of bitter and citrus hops is dominating with a nice malt base also noticeable. Taste is a mix between some citrus and bitter pacific hops with a neutral but still perceptible malt base. Full body with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. While this is a very enjoyable IPA, I would have enjoyed it a bit more if the presence of floral and grapefruit hops would have been more discernable."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a golden orange, low clarity, with 3 cm of off white foamy head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma is mostly citrus with floral notes. Initial flavor is piney and citrusy hops, not much else though. More citrus in the finish, dry aftertaste. Light carbonation, light to medium body, lots of lacing, and a hint of alcohol appreciated. Drinkable but you better love nothing but hops, solid IPA."
"Do yourself a favor and try it soon."
"Poured a very nice copper color with off white head that billows up and out of my glass. Aroma is a wonderful display of earthy, citrus hops with plenty of smack your nostrils punch. Caramel malt is also present in this delightful aroma. Taste is very strong packed with the intense earthy hops from the west coast. Moutfeel is a sticky and not very carbonated. This was a great beer, and I wish I had more."
"While flavorful, this may be a little too much of a good thing. It is not balanced for an IPA, but it is still tasty and worthwhile to seek out."
"Alll in all if you find this and like hops pick this up!"
" Really well made and drinkable beer."
"Growler filled at the Finger Lakes Beverage center in Ithaca. Enjoyed several pints. Pours a slightly hazy light orange with frothy white head and lots of lacing. Heavy citrus hop aroma and taste to match with hints of grapefruit. Sweet in the middle with a nice dry finish. Very typical west coast example of this style. Medium body with great drinkability."
"Purchased a six pack of this beer at the Wine Gallery in Brookline Massachusetts. Poured in to my Sam Adams pint glass a mild hazy orange, with a clingy, large white head, and tiny pieces of sediment floating here and there. Nose gives off a perfume of pungent, oily hops, pine tree, hints of citrus, and fresh cream. Taste is full of complexities, many of which include some of the smells above. The most remarkable aspect of it is the hop flavor, which comes in waves, and leaves your taste buds a bit numb and beaten up. Body is thick, and oily...pretty big and bold for this style. Although the flavors are really strong and come right at you, I could probably put four or five of these back easily. This is a very good IPA IMO. I have to admit that I have not been very impressed with any of the Green Flash big beers that I have tried (Stout and DIPA). This one on the other hand is a sure winner, and one that I will be buying again in the future. Cheers"
"Pours a hazy orange amber color with a full finger off white head that is pretty stiff and fades slowly, leaving sheets of Belgian lacing behind. Numerous suspended chucks worth considering. The smell is aggressive floral and piny with a balanced sweetness to it. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is primarily tangy from the hops and there's a nice lingering resin texture. Full flavored, the taste is overwhelmingly a citrus hop; grapefruits and tangerines. Wow, really well done. Nothing left up to interpretation here!! and there is nothing shy about it either. Really well done...a boat load of quality ingredients in this one. The 7% ABV is hidden beneath the resin. Really easy to drink and well within the seconds or thirds envelop! Highly recommended."
"Drinkability is good, not cloying like too many of this style. I could have another, but body was a bit too heavy to declare it """refreshing"""."
"Good body, nice smooth feel with maybe a little less carbonation than I would prefer. Still a nice effort and really the epitomy of what I expect from the west coast in general. Another reason to love San Diego!"
"This beer poured a clear brown amber color and formed a pure white foamy head that left latticed lace as it subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma heavy of hops with grapefruit, pine and other citrus. The flavor was of hops, grapefruit, pine, a bit of caramel and pepper. The body is fairly light and the finish is fairly astringent with a hint of pepper. A nice IPA but at the price range here in Ohio at least, I will stick to my Bell's and Stone for my regular IPAs."
"Notes: I'd pick this up again, but not as consistently as say, Two Hearted, or Snoqualmie Wildcat. I have one more in the fridge, and I'm sure I'll enjoy it... but I'll remember that this one beats the hell out of your tongue."
"a beautiful light copper color, with an off white head leaving lacing on the side of the glass but not going away. the smell is a wonderful array of hops, I'm sure if they weren't there I would pick up on more of the malts that I'm getting a hint of. the taste once again continues the blast of hops but the malts come through a bit better, and it doesn't lack for carbonation. All in all a really good IPA, I think I'm going to cut my girlfriend off and drink the rest myself."
"This one is a staple in my beer fridge, and with the recent release of their delicious new Hop Head Red, I thought it high time for me to plug some words down that properly express why I like to drink this beer. West Coast is a darker IPA in the glass, bordering on a medium-dark caramel tone that eerily reminds me of the locals' leathered skin when I lived in America's Wang, Florida. The smell is a smack of resin, intermitten with a catty note. Not unpleasant, but it does have an intensity that speaks of its west coast roots. After a couple sips you can really get a handle on the hops. They rampage around the tongue and assault it with hits of pine, citrus, grapefruit zest, cut grass and once again that racy twang of hemp. Mmmm. Malt is not forgotten though, and lends a weight to the body, resulting in a full mouth-feel. The finish goes on all week and makes this a beer to savor, even if you are sessioning it. Thanks again Green Flash for providing me with yet another reason for my roomies to think I am a functioning alcoholic."
"This is a delightful beer to drink. A really good west coast IPA. I could easily have finished several of these if I had more than one of them. We can get this here now so a sixer of this is the next thing on my beer list."
"Not world class, but definitely """worthy""" within its style as an easy drinker to share and pass the time."
"Sniffably delightful..."
"Had this recommended to me from a buddy I worked with who is IPA-crazy and had a growler filled from Consumer's Beverages in Orchard Park, NY. Color wasn't special until I saw it backlit in my refrigerator - it glowed ruby red and poured a red-orangey color into a pint glass with frothy head also tinged with orange. Smell was all pine and citrus, very nice and crispy smelling as was the taste up front. After a couple of seconds, the bitterness kicked in and it left a very hoppy afterpresence in the mouth. Beer was unfiltered and chewy, I would have liked a little more malt presence, but it went down nicely. Except for the hop dragon breath afterwards, this is an exceptional beer. Very tasty, an excellently representative American IPA."
"D - Yummy! Good hops and citrus. Not too harsh of alcohol taste. kinda wish I got it a lil colder before I poured it since it had been sitting out since I brought it home this evening."
"Edit: My review is for the classic West Coast IPA, a roughly 7% beer. If a brewer changes the recipe then they should change the name of the beer. Bad form Green Flash, extremely bad form...07/14"
"Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. The beer clings the palate well and isn't heavy at all which helps make for one of the most drinkable ipas that I've ever had. This is a very nice beer."
"D: Very drinkable for its strength (assuming you love hops)."
"If bold, loud American IPAs are your thing, you should seek out Green Flash."
"D. This is definiteley a sipper.The taste lingers on and on.I can only drink this I.P.A by itself.It overwhelms the palate.But I like it that way."
"12oz bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. $14 for a 6-pack - damn hop shortage. Pours a clear medium gold. Divine strong hoppy aroma. Flavour is exactly what you'd expect - in a good way. Strong, warming, hoppy and bitter. More please, thank you, yum yum."
"Notes: This is a good beer,but even for a hop lover like myself I needed to accept the bitterness that this brew provided. It is what it is and I would buy this again. This is not for session so I would enjoy it from time to time and when I am in the mood for something crazy with hops abound and bitterness that lasts. Perhaps with a Thai cuisine?"
"I would love this with anything spicy."
"D- A very good American IPA. Highly recommended."
"M + D: Nice carbonation, and a decent medium body... drinks pretty easily, though it could get a little strong after a while"
"Notes: To get an idea of the flavor, take a handful of pine needles, some fresh grass, add a lemon -- including the peel -- and a chunk of pine tar. Dilute with 10 oz of water and blend. Voila!"
"Getting a hop fix is an understatement in this case. Pine, grapefruit, orange and malts on the palate."
"Medium body is creamy and slick, offering excellent drinkability. So beautiful tasting it's hard not to quaff. World class."
"Well done, seriously."
"Green Flash's IPA is just a bit over-the-top for me. It's far too bitter and one-sided, and that may just be the San Diego style for all I know (this is my first, to my knowledge). I prefer some fruit notes and malty sweetness in my ideal IPA. Even though this is not in my top tier of IPAs, I will still gladly finish the six-pack."
"Slippery, sticky, chewy mouthfeel. A complex and interesting concoction that oughta come out of your kitchen faucets. Could, would, should drink 'em if you can find 'em!!"
"D: One of the best west coast IPAs this east coast guy has had. More please!"
"Drinkability is moderate. A nice IPA indeed."
"D,notes: This is a good West Coast IPA. Drinkability is somewhat impeded in my opinon by the overly strong hop flavor."
"Pours a nice golden amber with lots of carbonation, leaves sticky lacing all over the glass. Smell is potent hop glory, one of the best smelling IPA's I know of. Fresh citrus explosion to the nose with mostly grapefruit. Green grassy hops and funky cannabis resin. Taste is also great. It carries on with the hop assault. Again, quite green and resinous. Big citrus and some pine as well. A little biscuity malt is all there is to keep this from going way overboard, though it's already pushed the limits enough. Tiny hint of alcohol peaks through. Great bitterness, solid medium body. Had the hop power of a IIPA minus the need for tons of malt to back it up. Oily, resinous, not thick. Definitely tingles the tongue and has a dry finish. Not the most drinkable but the hop fix of all hop fixes quite possibly when it comes to an IPA. Classic stuff, here."
"D: I really liked this beer a lot outside of the metallic taste, which I think is freshness related. I will actively seek another bottle of this to rerate."
"This is a perfect west coast IPA. Green Flash continues to impress me with everything they do."
"Leaves that hefty double IPA film on the tongue. Thick and chewy. It's supremely bitter, maybe be too harsh for immediate repeats. But a top shelf Imperial(ish) IPA."
"An exceptional beer. A tribute to the style"
"This is not necessarily a beer you want to drink every day. This isn't a beer you want to share with your faint hearted friends. But for a hophead, this is a beer to visit often, to savor and to remember."
"First Green Flash brew for me and man, was I impressed. thanks to Jason from the Brewmasters for sharing this with us last night. Had no expectations and then the hops just hit you and do not go away. Quite tasty and quenching, easy to drink as well. Nice orange color with a moderate head and carbonation. Worth every ounce."
"Poors a brilliant orange with 1/2 inch of foam. Smells of PUNGENT pine that sticks in your nose and coats your nostrils. Tastes of thick pine resin and grapefruit. It's catty, thick and sappy. This is no session beer, but it highlights the West Coast hops nicely. Brilliant Beer, but it's a sipper."
"Fantastic IPA. Ballsier than Two-Hearted, if hops are """not your thing," then back away slowly and find something else. I am very excited this is now available in NC and eager to try their other beers."
"Poured into a Sam Imperial Pilsner glass. Pours a hazy orange with thin white head and lots of sediment. Smell is divine! Tons of tangy and flowery hops, almost as floral as Nugget Nectar. Taste is mush of the same- great hop bitterness up front- really crisp with a slight mellowing at finish, but then the hop bitter aftertaste kicks in. Great for an IPA lover! Crisp, refreshing mouthfeel and a pretty drinkable 7% IPA."
"Update 11/15/10. I felt the need to update my review of a fresh bottle I just enjoyed. This beer is so damn good it should be outlawed. If you like hops and you like bitter clean drinkable IPAs, this one is for you. The massive fruit flavors just pop as the hops dance on your tongue. Bitterness is crazy at the finish, but it's so good. WCIPA and Smutty Finest Kind are maybe two of the hoppiest and bitter IPAs I've had. Wonderful."
"Very refreshing, crisp, and not heavy despite the 7% abv. Extremely drinkable for the style and would be great in the upcomming summer months."
"Go Red Sox ( Manny ejected in the 2nd )"
"Final thoughts - An excellent example of a great American IPA."
"It a very good balenced beer and a very drinkable beer will definitely be getting another six pack!"
"Good, well-carbonated, yet thick mouthfeel. The pine hops really take over, and there is a ton of hops and malt background here. Could use a bit more balancing tropical fruit/citrus notes, and there is an acrid, bitter after-taste that I can't pinpoint. It is NOT the standard IPA/DIPA bitterness. Almost like burnt pine needles. Still, a strongly flavored, good IPA."
" WEST COAST ROCKS! Hopefully this will be available in RI real soon."
"Pours a honey/golden color, with a gorgeous cream-colored head that sticks around and clings to the glass. It's absolutely full of floaties. The smell is glorious!! Total citrus/hop insanity! The taste delivers on the promise of the smell....definitely a hop-dominant beer, but still not too overpowering. Nice smooth mouthfeel, too. Bitterness from the hops lingers on and on and on...this is a seriously tasty IPA!"
"D: I think this thing was too hoppy without enough malt to balance it nicely. I think it would be a great drink when you are in a hop mode. Otherwise, I wouldn't find myself drinking more than one of these in a night."
"Very fine carbonation. Crisp and bright with a fuller body for an IPA. The strong lingering bitterness really affects the mouthfeel in a positive way. A lot of folks feel this beer is being unfairly hyped as of late but I really dig it. One of the best of the style I've had in a great while."
"Good drinkablity, I could drink a few of these in a night."
"Either they've changed their recipe, or I've gotten better at identifying color. This is copper/amber, with a dense, off-white head with good retention and nice lacing. The nose has plenty of bitter hops, pine and bitter herb, some crystal malt. Moderate hop aroma as well, with some citrus. The palate opens plenty bitter with a pleasing, resiny pine character, along with citrus pith (grapefruit). A definite crystal malt character is present, with a little toffee and a touch of caramel. Drying, bitter, resiny on the finish, this beer is medium-light with medium-medium high carbonation that's a little too much IMO, hurting the mouthfeel a little bit. There's a definite alcohol presence, especially on the finish. An excellent IPA."
"D - Good drinkability. i've seen it in bevys down state & glad its finally made it up to Albany. this'lll be a good one for the summer months ahead."
"D: The insane amount of hops killed the drinkability for me but hopheads rejoice."
"Notes: Had this on draft recently at the Blind Tiger in NYC. It might have been even better, but I wasn't taking notes that day."
"Pours a golden orange. Thin white head,excellent retention,and lacing. Aroma is of piney hops,and grapefruit. Body is medium,and carbonated. Taste is of piney,fruity hops,and more hops!Oh,did I mention hops? On par with the best of the IPA's in my opinion. Excellent."
"A really great assortment of west coast hops that come through strongly in the nose ... and then lets me down in the mouth. Unfortunately, we don't brew beer to smell. This beer has the potential to be truly great if the recipe schedule were adjusted only slightly and the carbonation profiled was altered somewhat."
"This poured a dark amber with tons of sediment and a light tan head. It smelled of strong citrus hops with a bit of malt. It tasted like copper and grapefruit hops, which was more tangy than bitter. It was fairly thick with a bit of carbonation and a decently bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a good IPA, but it didn't have a clean enough hops bitterness for me."
"Poured from the bottle a nice light gold color and a viscous lacy head that stuck nicely to the glass. The smell is extraordinary bursting with fresh northwest hops. It is as if you took a handful of hops and brought them to your nose. The taste is all about the hops with just enough of a simple malt backbone to hold it all together. At the finish there's a distinct but brief resiny bitterness. The mouthfeel is velvety and smooth. The drinkability is ok, but suffers a little bit from the overpowering hops and the sticky resin that hits you throughout. Overall the best beer I've ever had from a bottle in terms of fresh hop flavor and aroma."
"I was looking for something to cut into the intense sweetness of an over-exuberant porter and found this beer to hit the spot. There's an intense hop bite from the first sip, but it's not something that's overwhelming. Pine, floral, fruits, they all blend nicely together to create and exceedingly easy drinking IPA. I could have kicked back a few of these without noticing the ABV, too. Overall, a very tasty west coast IPA."
"Drinkability: Pretty good drinkability. Another great offering from Green Flash."
"All-around, a very easy to drink and tasty IPA."
"Drinkability- Its a good tasty IPA, a little unbalanced for my tastes but some like that in a beer."
"Finish is oily, hoppy, bitter, and everlasting, and hence, not particularly dry. Medium body with lively carbonation."
"D: Tasty hoppy West Coast IPA with a most delectable aroma and great taste and feel to back it up."
"Great looking off amber colored beer. Sweet and sticky smell and all piney with grapefruit scents. Medium to full bodied beer. Nice lacing on the glass is a terrific looking beer. The taste was WAAY too unbalanced for me. Very hoppy, to the point of """where is the malt""". Made this one tough for me to finish. Good beer, how it can win out over Stone IPA is beyond me. They must be same """judges""" that did not elect Chris Carter to the pro football HOF this last vote. This IPA is worth a try and and I would try it again, but I will not seek it out. The strength of the hops, or the lack of the malt, makes this IPA's alcohol overwhelming."
"D: Green Flash hit the mark with this one... goes down great even with all those hops assaulting your mouth... good showing at 7%."
"Mmm, great stuff! I could see this as a fridge staple in the summer."
"The aroma is outstanding among IPA's. All about the hops, and it's apparent there are plenty of them here. Big grapefruit, pine and orange zest mingle with lighter floral and earthy characteristics. Any perceptible malt is only there as a balancing backbone. This beer is all about featuring what's best about west-coast IPA's. Fitting name!"
"D: Medium to low due to lack of balance. I wonder how the hop shortage will change this beer?"
"Peace"
"D-Totally! This is one of my top 5 west coast IPA's for sure. I could sit and drink this all night. As for the 7%...you'd never guess...which could be bad!"
"D - Drinkability is good. I enjoyed the brew and would easily have another. Something about the flavors and balance of this beer just works for me."
"A hoppy delight here. Carefully balanced to give support to the hops that take center stage."
"In short, this is a great session IPA. Would definitely drink it again."
"Bottom line: big hops yet drinkable. This toes the line of being too hoppy, but doesn't cross. Maybe my pour was just had the CO2 turned down, but there was zero head and lacing on this pint. The aroma was of big juicy, reisinous grapefuit with floral notes. The flavor expands with more citrus rind that is a nice mix of rough and smooth hops. I can't say enough about the balance here. Not of the mix of hops and malt, but enough hops and too much. Reminds me of Masala Mama of Town Hall in Minneapolis."
"I just can't drink it. I had a few other patrons rooting for me. Even a try & chugging the last few ounces almost ended in disaster."
"Pours a dark amber. No head at all. Nose is saturated pine and peaches. Extremely intense. Flavor is areal zingy concoction. Thick resin edges. Earthy citrus tones. Feel is slick on liquid and the carbonation is low. Feels nice though. Drinkable, but there is a lot of edge to this though that I'm not sure I remember experiencing on the bottle."
"Pours a hazy golden orange color with a nice eggshell colored head that left some real nice lacing on the glass. Probably would have given the appearance score a 4.5 but there were tons of particles (yeast?, don't think this is bottled conditioned) floating around the brew. The aroma is of a nice floral and piney hop, some bready malt noticable. The taste is bitter grapefruit rind, can't really pick up any other flavors after that. Must say it is a little harsh. The feel is light and fizzy, and finshes with a harsh bitterness. An IPA for those who love bitter grapefruit hops. I don't mind the grapefruit hop but just wish it was more on the juicy side instead of harsh."
"All in all this is a good beer and I will surely be reaching for it in the near future, since it's in the beer cooler at my corner store."
"M/D: Smooth, light to medium bodied, low carbonation. Decent drinkability. Very refreshing."
"Short, stout, 12 oz bottle copped singly from Buy Rite on Oak Tree in South Plainfield.. heard a lot of good things about this beer and brewery, so decided to give this one a go, and I wasn't dissapointed at all... superb appearance, golden, cloudy, hazy, with an enormous frothy and foamy head that lingered on for a bit before receding... smell was clean and clear, with noticeable fresh hops, vanilla, and caramel... taste paid homage to the aroma, with a strong suggestion of hops, grains, caramel, sugars, grapefruit, pears, and florals... really good stuff from the West Coast... very good representaion of the style... recently copped their Imperial IPA, which I haven't tried yet, but based on my impression from this sample, I'm sure I'm in for a treat... excellent stuff with a good mouthfeel and equally good drinkability without any suggestion of the 7% ABV... Recommended..."
"A fantastic brew and one that needs to be sought out if you are a fan of West Coast IPAs."
"d: The tap selection was too tempting for a second one, but I was tempted."
"12 ounce bottle, no freshness info offered. Pours deep copper amber. Would be fairly clear, if it weren't for the abundance of yeasty/sediment/floaties floating around. Darker tan head, fine retention, leading to a nice lumpy froth. Then all kinds of lace. Nice looking brew, lots of character. Fresh leafy resiny hop nose. Hop blast continues onto the taste buds, plenty of more resin, soft citrus notes, this is the good stuff. I have gotta get back out to San Diego, love the style and love this version. Long smooth finish, more hops, riding on a luxurious blanket of malt. Love to be able to get this stuff in the NYC area"
"I'd probably overlook this beer in the future, but would be very interested in trying other beers from this brewery."
"D - Great IPA, I'd make a night with this one anytime. Now that I know where to find it, this will be a staple in my diet. If you see this one, don't hesitate to grab it."
"Overall a superior AIPA. Resiny, sticky and robust."
"A massive three finger off white head with rocky bubbles quickly builds to the top of the glass. Body is the color of honey. Scattered lace is left all over the body of the glass. The nose is huge with lots of fresh hop aroma and sweet citrus and sappy pine. Hop presence is quick to make itself known with long bold mineral based hops. The palate yeilds a slight creamy sweetness that quickly fades to a lengthy bitter richness that shows a bit of malt character as well. A solid IPA with a lengthy bitter mouthfeel. Drinkability is nice."
"D: Terrific west coast IPA, yum. This is a top notch IPA that is representative of the west coast flavors."
"D: A hoppy, fantastic IPA, similar to Harpoon's Finest Kind, IMO. It's the hopheads' IPA, yet still has just enough sweet malt balance. Very dry finish, this would be awesome w/ any spicy food. Buy a case."
"D: I am certainly glad this beer was recommended to me. I wouldn't mind buying a whole case of this beer."
"This is one of those nice go to IPA's out there. Well done."
"D - goes down easy and it's a good all around IPA, very enjoyable brew."
"This is my current go to IPA. It pours a nice amber with a thick head and nice retention and a great deal of lacing. Big citrus/pine hop smell and a nice balanced malty sweetness. Taste is great. Strong hops flavor with an equal amount of sweet with a bitter finish. This beer is easily drinkable."
"Designed to scratch your hop itch."
" I love hoppy IPA's but you CAN go overboard, and for me at least this one does. Dont mis understand - I liked it and would drink it again, but it sure aint making my top 10 IPA list."
"O - Overall, a very pleasant and drinkable beer. I could probably go through a six-pack in a night. Great example of a West Coast IPA with impressive distribution."
"On tap at yardhouse in Irvine. Beer golden-copper in color with a slightly foamy head. Scent of citrus, grapefruits and some pine. Taste was excellent. Reminded me of eating California grapefruit with some light citrus. Very little bitterness on the tongue. Very drinkable, recommend it out of the tap versus the bottle."
"Really nice creamy mouthfeel that is well balance by the carbonation."
"Overall a fantastic IPA. I was told this won the GABF ('07) for its category. A rightful winner with a lot to be proud of. From the land of assertive and well-crafted IPAs, this one most definitely stands out. I will be on the lookout for this baby for sure"
"I don't think that I could drink more than one of these in a sitting as it really isn't my favorite style, but I am glad that I tried it and would recommend to those looking for a west coast IPA."
"Overall experience: I'm happy to have access to fresh Green Flash beer. I'll buy it anytime...and do."
"12 oz. glass bottle- color of clear honey, with a off white head - nose of resin, spruce, fresh hops , pine , mint , resin , cannabis , and malt  taste of fresh hops , lemon citrus , resin , cannabis , and malts- body is great better than their IIPA, and with medium high carbonation  aftertaste of resin, citrus zest, slight malts, and very nice balance all the way around"
"I bumped up the stats a bit. I liked it even better than the first time around."
"Goes really well with some sharp cheddar."
"Overall: I had recently had Green Flash's DIPA and was not overly impressed. It had a strange taste in the middle that just kind of put me off. This one being its little brother I was a bit concerned. Well fear not this one is quite the opposite. It is an easy drinking great tasting beer that is satisfying and very sessionable."
"D: Very drinkable due to the great taste and balance. Pick up a six pack of this one if you love west coast IPA's."
"d: not a bad ipa, not the best but worth a try"
"this pours a pretty glowing, cloudy orangey amber with some particulates. nice lingering creamy white head as well. pine and citrus in the nose along with sweet honeyed malts. the moderate malt sweetness is quickly bitch-slapped by the hop bitterness in this. the bitterness lingers in this medium-bodied brew. nice frothy carbonation as well. drinkability is good considering the abv."
"A very nice IPA. I'm no hophead but I enjoyed this very much. Its a great example that beers can be hopped without being overly bitter and still leave some room for sweetness. This would be great with anything zesty & sweet (Pacific Rim, Thai, Szechwan) as well as good pub fare that is, again, lively or spicy. While I'm not surrendering my malt-head card yet, IPAs like this are enough to convince me to continue to explore the genre for gems like this. Definitely recommended, a damn nice beer."
"A great tasting brew."
"Nice substantial mediumish mouthfeel. Good stuff all around, maybe a bit too bitter and slightly alcoholy are my only complaints- very nice hop-bomb IPA."
"It pours a hazy dark burnt orange color, with beautiful white lacing. The aroma is fairly light, but I can pull out some pine from it. The taste comes out with pine and grapefruit, but you can taste the alcohol which throws this one off for me a little. The taste isn't bad but the alcohol robs some of the flavor."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and carbonation is enjoyable prickly. Drinkability is dangerously high for this 7.0% abv. This may be the best IPA I've had to date. Very similar to Smuttynose's IPA if you're looking for a comparison. Pairs great with monterey jack cheese."
"Poured into tulip glass, thick caramel color. Good fizz, bright but murky. The smell is HOPS HOPS HOPS. The taste pretty much matches the smell - you get what you expect. Mouthfeel is pretty carbonated and hoppy, but I like this style. Very drinkable. Did I mention I LOVE this beer?"
"This is a raw, hoppy IPA. Unfiltered, the body is extremely hazy but the head retention is great. Lots of citrus in the nose, with a hint of sweetness that isn't nearly as present in the taste. Oily hops with a huge grapefruit flavor nearly overwhelm the malt, giving it a slightly one-dimensional quality, though an enjoyable one. The hops really stick to the palate, leaving a long-lasting bitterness. This is a good, solid IPA, maybe even a great one. I've had better, but I've also had much worse."
"Pours a clear copper color with about a half finger of off-white head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma is of citrusy, piney, and resiny hops. Taste is dominated by piney and resiny hops. Malts make a fleeting appearance but really can't hope to shine through the overwhelming hop flavor. In the finish there is a pleasant and lingering hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is good, medium-light body and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good as well. The 7% ABV is barely noticable. The hops are dominant on the palate but not overwhelming. Overall a pretty darn good IPA."
"D: LOVED the nose but the mouthfeel ruined it for me."
"Another San Diego brewer to look out for in the future"
"Really tasty, solid IPA that I could drink a ton of. This is good stuff."
"D- Because of the 7% abv, sessionability is quite low. The problem is, this IPA is so tasty, you can't help yourself but drink a few in a sitting!"
"More friendly and drinkable than their Double IPA, this is a great pick for a hop fix, and an exemplary SoCal IPA."
"Pours a cloudy burned orange with a thick marshmellow cream head that stays the whole time and has nice lacing. Lively carbonation is visable. Smells awesome. Huge hops with citrus rind that holds it own and a hint of malt. Tastes of HOPS and also tastes of HOPS. Piney, citrusy, grapefruit and HOPS. Feels thin but full in the mouth. Good carbonation and a finish with a bite. If your a hop fan, this brew will put a pucker then a smile on your face. A must try."
"D: A great West Coast IPA, very hoppy and tasty, a stellar production, will definitely buy again. Great job by Green Flash!"
"Drinkablity - Great. Obviously not a session beer, but very enjoyable. Worth seeking out."
"Pours a copper-ish color with a off white head. Aromas of grapefruity hops and a malty sweetness fill the air. The taste is all hops, hops, and more grapefruity hops. Leaving that bitter atertaste as well. Very nice lacing on the glass. A bit sweet, and a nice bitter hop end. A very nice IPA, very tasty!"
"Pours a one finger yellow-tan head over a particulated apricot color liquid. Smells pith and some light esters. Woodsy oranges and tangerine. Tastes oranges and pith. Sharp clean hop bitter, grassy is low. Potent bitter is above all, but hop flavor is nearly comperable. Peach fuzzy. Pith is drying in the end, but allows a fruity sweet to rise a touch in the aftertaste. Md body and md-heavy carbonation."
"Poured a lovely copper with a thick off-white head. Smell...wow! Stinky nuggets topped with a citrus glaze. I knew I would enjoy this beer. Very, very sharp nose that coated the palate with rich hops and pink grapefruit. So hoppy in that I couldn't tell how balanced she was...the hops dominate that much. Nice lacing left in the glass. For me, this is a once-in-a-while type of IPA."

"Got this one from IntriqKen. Thanks!!! A hophead's delight...Up there with Avery Maharajah, Bigfoot and Celebration Ale in the hophead pantheon!!! Pours a hazy copper color. Can get a nice size white head with a hard pour down the middle of the glass. Decent lacing. Smell is great. Lets you know right away that you will be in hops heaven shortly. Tastes very good. Nice and simple. Very strong hops bitterness and citrus (grapefruit). The hops is by far and away the dominant taste. Mouthfeel is smooth and rich. Coats the tastebuds....wouldn't appreciate a Pilsner after this one!!! Very little alcohol taste. As sessionable as 7% can get. I would enjoy 2-3 of these over a long session. Will look for this one at Total Wine or my next foray to Half Time in Poughkeepsie NY. A very nice beer."
"Keeper!"
"Drinkability  I wasn't expecting this from a sub-$2 beer but this heavy hitter is incredibly well done."
"Golden Orange, Small head, great aroma of hops. Mostly taste only the hops used. Pick up an orange or citrus flavor as well. I assume from one of the hops they are using. Bottled in a short bottle. Not a very strong smell. Leaves a nice flavor in your mouth and is very easy to drink more than one of."
"Definitely a good IPA. It's almost like a DIPA in its bitterness and hop character and is certainly much better than this brewery's DIPA. Get this instead of the DIPA. Recommended."
"Poured from a short 12 ounce bottle, it's a nice golden-orange with a sticky off-white head. The smell is assertively hoppy but backed by a fair noseful of biscuity malt smell. The hops assault the tongue but, again, the malt sweetness rounds things out fairly well. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. The hops overtake the tongue quickly and this doesn't strike me as an all-nighter in the drinkability department. Overall, a fairly good effort but outmatched by many other IPAs, including a laundry-list from the same county."
"A wonderful CA hop bomb. Full mouthfeel, full flavor - all the hops you could imagine. Wow - this just showed up back east - who are these guys?"
"a big thanks to Intiqken for sending this my way!"
"This is a great IPA, so damn hoppy...mmm. Another great IPA from San Diego."
"Poured a cloudy amber orange with an intensely fluffy very big head. The smell is lightly grainy and with beefy, citrusy hops. This is a huge hop bomb with intense grapefruit pith and a big meatiness in the flavor. The mouthfeel is a little thick and grainy, which makes it hard to drink much of. Had out of the bottle at City Beer Store in San Francisco. This is one nice IPA, but not as balanced as some."
"Nice beer that I tried at a ale house in Oakland. Medium amber color that had a thin head with wispy lace. Strong aroma of citrusy hop, same on the taste buds though malt balancing was evident. Nice mouth feel and drinkable. Never heard of this brewery until today, if their other beers are like this they should be fine."
"pours a hazy copper orange with a nice white head and leaves a nice lace... had this on bottled as well and was also impressed... nose is grapefruit, citrusy and floral with a little pine... tastes totally grafruity and bitter, but not overboard... a hophead extrvaganza"
"A great IPA, well worth enjoying and seeking out, and I'll be revisiting aplenty... but it won't be replacing Stone or Alesmith for me, yet, although it and Racer 5 are going to have to have a few discussions. Bring on the Alpine 6'ers to LA!"
"West Coast I.P.A. pours a hazy burnt orange with a nice two finger fluffy off-white head that takes a while to die down a nice layer. Stickiness is all over the place, this IPA won't let go. I also notice some sediment floating, maybe yeast? Clean piney aroma with a nice sweet sugary grapefruit kick. Some yeast in the nose as well. Taste is a nice earthy hop flavor with a hint of bitterness. Ends very sweet on the tongue, I really enjoy this aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. I really enjoy this IPA, wish it was more available on the east coast. West siiide."
"D: Kind of a jolt to the palate at first, but after a while becomes a bit more well-rounded as it warms. A fairly well-heeled IPA that would be good for a round or two."
"Maybe this bottle is a little past it's prime. I have a couple more so if things change this review will be updated. Solid IPA but nothing to set it apart."
"Another great beer from Green Flash. If you like hops and IPAs, this is the company to try."
"*had this just after lagunitas ipa"
"5-4-4-4-4"
"Pours a hazy orange with a one finger head; good lacing. Aroma is big hops with subtle malts. I have never sucked on fresh hops before, but this beer approximates how I imagine that would taste. Just big pure green hops. Huge hop flavor that is amazingly not bitter. Unbeleivable balance of hops wihout horrible bitterness. Nice mouthfeel. Highly drinkable. I think the bottle lasted me less than 5 minutes. Very nice."
"Poured into my DFH tulip pint, this beer is a nice copper/amber color. Gives a big, off-white two-finger head which leaves lots of sticky lace. I can see bits of yeast sediment floating around in my glass, which I didn't expect from this beer. Oh, well. The aroma here is all pine, all the time. There may be a trace hint of grapefruit in there somewhere, but it's drowned out by all the trees. Hoppy, hoppy, hoppy. And the taste is the same way. Hoppy, piney, and even a tad bit sweet. Tart and tangy pine up front, a bit of evening out sweetness in the middle, and a crazy hop finish with lots of lingering bitterness. Certainly not for the faint of hops. Mouthfeel is nice and sturdy, although it also has a syrupy feel to it which is ultimately overcome by the strong hop finish. I wouldn't necessarily call this a highly drinkable IPA. It's more of a hop-head's dream come true, but I don't think it's really all that accessible for non hop fans. Still, I like it, and I'll revisit this beer in the future. Best when fresh."
"drinkabilty: very drinkable for a hop-head!!"
"Pours a nice dark orange light carbonation and with a head that leaves quickly. Yeast is suspended from the bottom of the bottle. Has a Citrus hop aroma and has a pine resin chewy mouthfeel. I like this beer and drinkability is high. I would love to do a side by side tasting of GF Imperial India Pale Ale."
"Pours an orange/amber. Aroma is intensely hoppy with hints pine and grapefruit. Taste was hops from start finish with zesty orange, grapefruit, and pine. This is a classic hopped up West Coast IPA. It's on par with Racer 5 and Stone IPA. I'm really impressed with this one, it's becoming my favorite Cali. IPA."
"The taste is fairly strong hop bitterness with medium malt flavors. The taste is both leafy and fruity with a medium bodied mouthfeel. A pretty decent IPA."
"M: a good medium bodied beer that is very enjoyable i good solid ipa worth trying"
"Pours a cloudy orange color, nice carbonation, nice small off-white head which lasted awhile, some nice islands and sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is slightly sweet, hoppy, slightly malty, grapefruit, and some caramel. The taste is hoppy, and plenty of grapefruit/caramel going on. The finish is slightly dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, I heard many good things about this IPA for about a year now, well it is a mighty fine IPA at that, will definitely buy more of this in the future."
"Scott"
"Had on tap at Naja's in Redondo Beach. A near perfect IPA, the aroma especially rocked (pine, grapefruit, all the hops aromas I like). The flavor had enough malt to give a small counter-balance, leaving the hops to define the overall quality. Thicker than it is thin, but still not too strong or overbearing. Nice nice IPA."
"Great hoppy west coast ale, possibly the best one yet."
"D- Not the best of the style, strange aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body and medium/mild in carbonation."
"Drinkability is good a big West Coast IPA. I love hops but hints of malt would make it a touch better. I guess it should be all good just in a different mood today. Thanks to merlin48 for the treat as always."
"D: A nice summer brew in my opinion. Big on the citrus and pine flavors. West Coast IPA all the way! Recommend."
"Great stuff regardless!"
"Nice balance for an over-hopped IPA. Hops it the front of the tongue like nails being driven into each taste bud. But then there is a nice malt base that follows quickly to keep it all in control. Heavy on the grapefruit citrus. Medium body that seems both thicker at the sip and lighter at the finish thanks to the hops. Just a tad dry with the finish too. Really enjoying my way through the glass."
"Quite a tasty treat that makes me want to try other beers from the brewery."
"I really dont know where to begin with this one. This was awesome. Poured a great bright orange, full of haze with a thick white head. This did fade rather quickly and left behind a good lace, looks yummy. Smell was a hop bomb, no other way to put it. Huge strong flavors of grapefruit and pineapple, with a slight touch of alcohol, but not too strong, just a refreshing clean crisp smell that really made me want to dive in. The taste, OHH YEAH!! One word PERFECT. Strong classic west coast hop bomb. Enormous citrus hops, pine resiney goodness, huge flavors, nothing subtle here, Sooo smoothe, crisp, perfect fullness and feel. Big dry bitter finish capped it perfectly. Easily one of my favorite IPA ever. I really cannot say enough good things about this one, its a classic!"
"Update: Tried this again some four years later. Not sure if my bottle is old or what, but I get much more malt and much less hop. The smell is still delicious, but the taste is lacking in balance still with the malts not clashing well with the hops."
"This one was recommended by the bartender at Denver's Falling Rock. Served in a standard pint glass. Copper-orange colored liquid topped by a thin head. Foam lasted a long time and left some nice lacing streams the inside the glass. Lots of hop aroma, grassy and pine, citrus grapefruit. Taste is very solid. The flavor mirrors the smell with a blend of pine and citrus. Oily bitter finish. Enough malt to keep it from being a total hop bomb. Carbonation is limited, keeping it smooth. For being so hoppy, it is still easy to drink. Overall, one of the better IPAs I have had the pleasure of trying. I see why it is a favorite."
"Cheers!"
"Murky looking copper. Thin white head leaves ample amounts of lace. Beautiful aroma of pungent, oily hops. Cannabis, grapefruit rind, lemon.... All the good stuff. Wafting up my nostrils. This is kind of a down and dirty, grundgy tasting IPA, but I like it. (As opposed to a more bright and snappy IPA....) The hop flavors are resinous in nature and a little lemony. Grassy too. The bitterness lingers, though it's not overbearing. Malts are toffeeish in nature and in the background. Body is medium to medium-full. Lightly carbonated. Solid IPA. Different, yet solid."
"D: Hell yeah. An awesome IPA, although maybe not he best for session drinking due to the intensity of the taste."
"If you like American IPA's without sweetness this one is for you. Plenty of bitter hops to go around here, which helps drinkability. No hint of an alcohol presence. Very well done!"
"Drinkability: You know, as I slog through this one, I'm finding myself won over. This would be a great brew to have on a late spring or summer evening - it's snappy, so it's refreshing, but not one of those hot weather thirst quenchers. I wouldn't make this my lawnmower beer, but I would bring a few for friends at a barbecue to show them what the world of craft beer can produce."
"This has to be the best west coast IPA I have ever had hands down. This blows away most DIPA's I've had. The color is a nice clear orange with a beautiful white head. The smell is citrus and pine needles. The taste is so amazing! Loaded with hops, I can definitely taste Simcoe (the only hop I can really distinguish except for Columbus) and there is such a wonderful piney, citrus flavor. One bottle I had tasted exactly like biting into an orange. I wanted to give this one all 5's but it is a little unbalanced so I had to ding the drinkability. Still, at 7% ABv and $7 per sixer, this stuff is amazing. Delicious."
"Overall- A delicious IPA. Huge big bold flavor, typical West Coast IPA. Highly recommended."
"This beer is loaded with citrussy and aromatic hops and they hold up throughout the glass. I was a little disappointed that the malt backbone did not stay abreast of the hops. After a few sips, I found the malt flavor and presence had totally given way to the hops. For this reason, I think this beer's balance is a little lacking. It is a very good American IPA, but I'd have to pass after a couple of bottles."
"Comments: The aroma is the real winner here. Dominated by the trademark citrusy NW hops, it truly radiates hoppiness. The flavor is pleasant, but could cut down on the bittering hop addition."
"D: Could easily drink these all day, this might be a new summer brew for me."
"D - I had one yesterday and decided to wait until the second sample to write my review...once you know what to expect, it makes the beer much better. Very good - a top shelf IPA."
" I've listened to enough of the Red Hot Chili Peppers lately to want to jump in my Mustang and get back to California. After enjoying a brew like this, it's even more of a reason to make the trek. Another reason why the Golden State is great for microbrews - this beer is worth the effort to find and sample!"
"D: Big abv isn't noticeable at all. A nicely hopped IPA with a good finish and bitterness that's also smooth. Nice one from the west coast here."
"Thanks to Cisco for this one. Pours a hazy bronze/copper color. Clumpy head that leaves nice lacing. Nice citrus hoppy smell with a pine note. Taste the same as smell. I also notice some bready malt backbone. Finishes with some grapefruit flavor. Overall a nice beer that impressed me."
"D - Tasty and sessionable. I wouldn't mind having this again. A nice offering from Green Flash."
"Overall, a very good example of a hoppy SoCal IPA."
"On tap 4.75 years later and still very good IPA, very hoppy."
"Clear amber orange with a fluffy, off-white head. Lots of lacing as the foam slowly fell, with rings forming down the glass. Piney aroma with a little hop spice and fairly fruity. Mild caramel malt comes through. Malt sweetness hits up front, followed closely by resinous hops and significant bittering in the finish. Caramel flavours melded nicely with the fruity, slightly powdery, hops. Solid malt provides a good balance here, while still letting the hops do their thing. Finishes dry, medium bodied with lowish carbonation. Resin and bitterness really linger, but the malt presence makes this highly drinkable for an IPA. Recommended."
"Very well done IPA. I'm proud to have this labeled as """West Coast IPA.""" I'd say it's a fitting IPA. This is one San Diego brewer with the potential to go places."
"Notes: Special thanks to KingG for the sample and awesome trade. Cheers!"
"A very decent IPA. Great compliment for a spicy Chinese dinner. A surprise gem from Secret Santa 2006. Thanks again to Zrrbrrt, and a thumbs up to the brewers at Green Flash."
"Very interesting IPA- pours a light amber with decent carbonation, citrusy hop aromas and slight caramel malt sweetness on the nose. Hardcore stinging sweet malt flows alongside an aggressive hop profile. Somewhat thick for the style, but easy on the mouth and not too hoppy if thats your kind of brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, malty, bitterly piney, with a decent amount of CO2 running along the palate."
"I wasn't a big fan of the first Green Flash offering I tried, so I was a tad hesitant to sample this one, although it does seem to be the favourite amongst their brews. I can say that they did redeem themselves with this one as it is solidly tasty all around."
"D: It's good every now and then to have a slamming, flavor-forward IPA like this. This isn't one I'd have all the time, but it's great to be reminded what big hop flavor is all about. Harsh on the tastebuds, but definitely a tasty one and worth seeking out."
"West Coast in a bottle beeotch!"
"I was excited to have this beer to relax with after work tonight. The pour filled my glass with a red/orange color. There was a covering of about 1/2 an inch of white head. The lacing is great-sticky, long lasting with the appearance of a honeycomb that stays as I drink. I love the smell. It is of strong, grapefruit as well as a sweet, floral hop. There is the same refreshing citrus in the taste. There is a bitter hop bite in the end, but my tongue is left with a candy finish. It is a full tasting, well-carbonated beer. This has an excellent drinkability, I could easily have this at any time."
"This is a fantasticly well balanced single IPA. The availability for me has been scarce lately so I had this one bottle in the back of the frig for awhile. Drinking this right after a Stone IPA and this seems a bit smoother and perhaps a slightly creamier feel on the palate. I really love many of the San Diego breweries and Green Flash is yet another exceptional example. I vividly recall my first taste of this beer which was on tap at Najas and me and my brother were blown away and couldn't stop talking about how good it was. Later I found it in bottles and still love it. There Imperial IPA is something worth writing home about as well!"
"Scored this example for free from a beer rep, so I liked it from the beginning. Nice dark amber color with a bright white head. Sediment suspended in beer. Piney and citrusy hop smell. Sweeter blueberry-like taste upfront and then a bitter hop twist. Bitterness fades quick and begs to be tipped up again. Medium bodied and full of sharp, tingly carbonation. Very sessionable for me and an excellent year-round replacement for my favorite HopSlam."
"A good medium feel on the tongue, nicely carbonated and very tasty."
"D - Quite harsh, but a nice hop bomb."
"D: Tasty, not very filling, goes down ok, it’s a good representation of style, but not my favorite."
"Hazy amber in color with unfiltered particles, nice head, minimal lacing. Smells of citrus primarily with some sweetness. Tastes mainly of grapefruit with a nice malt pickup in the middle and then a good pine finish. Hints of alcohol present. Medium in both body and carbonation, not too dry, kinda wet, easy to sip. A very drinkable IPA and quite true to the West Coast style. Takes me back to where I want to be, the San Diego area, though it does leave me right at the city limits instead of """downtown"""."
"This beer must have had a long journey before it got to me. CA to MD, then MD back to CA thanks to MuenchenerKindl."
"Balanced, it's not, but if you like hops, get some of this. Very good."
"Drinkbility is good, the alcohol well hidden and the bitterness flavorful without being destroying."
"I'll be happy to try it again in the future but I probably won't mbe seeking out another bottle any time soon."
"The smell, taste and mouthfeel of this beer are very balanced, making this IPA very drinkable. Be careful of the cottonmouth the next morning. Regardless, I will go back for more."
"Beautiful balance of bitter and sweet keeps you coming back for sip after sip. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Drinking this beer is a great way to flood your palate with alpha acids. It's a bit too gritty to keep around all the time."
"This is absolutely a West Coast IPA. It's loaded with big hops - lots of citrus, lots of pine. It pours an amber color with a frothy cappucino head. Some sediment lurks toward the bottom of the glass. It's aroma is very grapefruit. The bitter tastes hits first but rounds out with the slight sweetness in the malt character. Very drinkable and quite delicious."
"D: Soft as water. Great example of the style."
"Pours burnt orange in color, chunky, with a soft looking cream head that slowly laces the glass. Aroma is sweet oranges and grass with some tropical aromas of pineapple and mangos. Tropical citrus flavors also in the taste but the sweetness is cut quickly by a large peppery bitterness that grows deep into the aftertaste. Just a hint of alcohol is evident in the bitter finish as well. Somewhat creamy medium body up front finishes crisp, light and bitter. Very nice ipa with a great aroma and a pleasing large bitterness."
"Pours a cloudy amber with half an inch of thin off-white head that leaves a light lacing with every sip. Smells of hops! Piney, woodsy, lemon...then comes the sweet scent of malt. This tastes delicious. Just what I was looking for in an IPA. All of the lemon, and orange reminds me of a fruity breakfast cereal in a good way since the malt comes in just when it should. Finishes with a pronounced spiciness that stays even as the bitterness comes through and lingers for a few seconds. Medium bodied with tingly carbonation. A wonderful IPA that I feel is very sessionable on it's own or paired with a nice assorted cheese platter."
"Good drinkability. This is a nice bitter beer with a ton of hops...pretty easy to put down."
"Pours a nice amber color with a good frothy one finger head that lasts a little while. A very thin head remains throughout with some lacing. The smell is wonderfully hoppy with some pineapple, citrus, and a little pine. The taste is excellent, hops, then citrusy sweetness, then hops. Very nice. The mouthfeel is smooth and dry at the end. This is a very drinkable beer. I could drink plenty of these no problem. Great job Green Flash. I will have to try some of their other stuff for sure."
"Hazy, amber color with a few floaters in there. Nice lacing going down though no real head. Huge hop aroma. I liken it to shoving your face right into a bag of hops-bright, grassy, grapefruit aroma. It is very pronounced but well defined-I wish I could pull this off in a homebrew. Hop flavor dominates-almost overwhelming depending on your liking. Wants to strip my tongue of taste buds-AND I LOVE IT! Malty base behind it all. Great mouthfeel-very well balanced overall. The astringency of the hopiness is great against the malty body. Very, very drinkable. The solvent like qualities of the hopiness might drag it down some but a killer, killer example of the style."
"This was an awsome brew. I happened upon it, getting a 12 ounze bottle from a friend. I poured it into a pint glass (from another friend). If you can't tell this was a group effort. There was a beautiful head, 2-3 fingers. The retention was pretty solid too. There wasn't an awful lot of sticky lace, some, but most was just kind of there. The color was a gorgeous light amber. The smell was a sweet hoppy smell. The taste was more hoppy than sweet, but super none the less. The was a highly drinkable brew. Don't drink and review."
"West coast IPA indeed, no mistake in the name of this beer. A very good example of this style done in true west coast fashion - the hops are balls to the wall. Hopheads should seek this one out."
"Thanks again from IntriqKen for this. Pours a orange/amber color, smells a bit sweet but some hops. Taste? Wow, what beers need, true hop flavor, citrusy, piney, awesome flavor, very exceptional. Overall I wish this was a beer that could be found locally, but in the meantime I can get it by trade. Smuttynose take note of what these guys are doing."
"Drinkability: Oh hell yes. This one is easily drinkable. Hands down one of my favorite IPA's I've had to date."
"Pours out an opaque caramel color, with one of the nicest heads I've ever seen; thick, creamy just off white. Tremendous lacing. Forget the nose, the room instantly lit up with hops. I'm two feet away and I get fruity hops and esters. I go in close for pineapple, grapefruit, papaya, it's like a carribean fruit salad in there. I even get a touch of sweetness, strawberry like, and faint. The taste hits me with pineapple and grapefruit again, right int he front, developing some peach and other stone fruit flavors. The whole time the grapefruit and pineapple stay with you though, and it finishes bitter, reminding you each time you swallow that it's a big IPA. I'm not the biggest IPA fan, and this is too hopped up for me, but I can recognize that it's an exceelent interpretation of the style, with lots of fun stuff to enjoy."
"Yeah....good stuff."
"Medium-bodied with little carbonation. Crisp, clean mouthfeel but it leaves a dry bitter aftertaste. Stay away from this thing if you're not a hophead, otherwise I'd completely recommend."
"Fairly drinkable, tasty enough that you want another if you really like big hop profiles but a pretty big beer that can catch up with you quickly. I'll be picking up more of this."
"Drinkability: this is a wonderful IPA that applies a pleasant assault on the tastebuds. Some may consider this approaching a DIPA, but the lighter malt levels makes this a super easy drinking IPA."
"Great IPA, once again I'm jealous I don't have access to this one more."
"If you're in the mood for a big hoppy ipa this one is pretty good."
"Poured a cloudy apricot color with moderate white puffy head, Very attractive lacing. Smell is loaded with piney, grassy citrusy hops. Taste follows through with a strong hop taste, somewhat balanced by the malt. Finishes a bit too long and bitter, and any maltiness seems to have vanished. Nice drinkability, but I would have enjoyed a bit more malt."
"As advertised, a solid example of West Coast IPA."
"Mouthfell is good, slightly dry. Drinkability is quite good considering its bitterness. This is a pretty awesome IPA, I'm glad we're getting Green Flash in Arizona."
"Over all, and exceptional brew. Highly recommended."
"I think West Coast and I think juicy, oily, sappy hops, and this doesn't disappoint, but it doesn't overwhelm despite little pretense to balance. It does have enough malt to maintain a presence, though. The ABV is sneaky, as it declines to overtly show itself, but it is there, do not doubt. And so simply, if hops are your bag, baby, you'll likely find this as drinkable as I do. Southern California is one fun, prolific place for beer."
"Pours a hazy amber copper color with a thick and foamy light tan colored head. Nose is fresh pine and citrusy hops along with a bit of spice. There is some noticeable sugary sweetness in the taste, but this is easily dominated by the bitter and piney hop oils and resins that remain in a lingering aftertaste. Pretty nice IPA here."
"One fine IPA. I had this on tap a couple of times, and it quickly became a favorite. Aside from losing a little of the aromatic qualities, and having some floating sediment, the bottled ale is still quite good. Plenty of hops right out front. A nice combo of pine and citrus that hits you in the back of the jaws, but is not overly bitter. Aftertaste leaves a hint of alcohol, and a bit of piney oil. Overall, this is one of my favorite IPAs."
"Gotta love it!"
"Pours with a white creamy head doesn't last a long time. Light coppery color sightly cloudy apperance. Sweet malty aroma slight hint of pine. Nice malty taste piney slight citrus hop taste. Good balance not as hoppy as I would like it to be.Medium bodied good clean taste.not a great beer but not a bad one either. I could drink another."
"D: That, my friends, is a west coast IPA. Recommended to all hop heads."
"Drinkability is outstanding! A great brew, wish it were available out here."
"This beer had awesome head and lacing, much more so than other great IPAs. It also had very nice malty flavours and contributions, without being overdone in that department. Just a touch more hops would put this over the top as an American IPA in my opinion. Thanks again to Bennetj17 for throwing this one in."
"I will have to get more of these, since I only picked one up on a trip through VA. Next time it will be a sixer at the least. Very enjoyable IPA."
"D- Very well brewed IPA. Not my favorite IPA, but this is a must try for hop heads. Distinctive taste compared to other IPA's."
"This is what I would expect of a West Coast IPA, hoppy but not overhopped leaving you picking resin out of your teeth like some West Coast DIPAs, nothing wrong with that either. This one left a head that hardly receded as I sipped, as the liquid went down the head clung to the side to form more than what I would consider a lace. This would be one of my go to beers if it were a local brewery."
"Overall: Definately a West Coast IPA. Hops, hops, hops, with little detectable malt balance. The hops, grapefruit pulp and medicinal flavors really overpower this brew. A good brew for hop heads, and even though I am in that category I like to see a little more balance."
"Beautiful amber color with very low amount of head. A slight, hoppy and fruity smell with a touch of sweetness. Taste is very hoppy (even for an IPA), but with a very pleasant and surprising citrus undertone. Slightly sweet but not overly so, I found this to be very unique. After drinking the entire glass, it may be a little overly hoppy/spicy, but nevertheless an excellent IPA."
"Overall impression: A nice beer for hopheads - definitely the best of the 3 Green Flash offerings I have tried."
"Overall, an excellent IPA! This is right up there with Titan and Stone for me. It a bit unbalanced to the hops (especially in the aftertaste) which keeps it from being top notch (Two-Hearted). I'll definitely be getting this again."
"Drinks easier than its 7.0 abv, hopheads will love this. A very good IPA"
"This is a winner. If you're a fan of brews like Stone or Lagunitas, pick this one up, too."
"Once my palate is deadened a little to the numbing hop kill I really appreciate the malt candy background. The mouthfeel too is lovely, rich and middling on the thick-to-thin spectrum. It poured with more body then I was expecting. A very pretty beer that exceeds some west coast IPAs I've tried."
"So glad to get to try this one...everything I expected and more."
"Slightly hazy and copper in color, the head is a nice half-inch with solid retention. The foam clings well to the glass and creates a fine lace. Aroma is sweet and citrus-like with a grassy hop flavor. Nice, but it could have been stronger. The taste starts out tangy and a strong bitterness is immediately detectable thereafter. The hop flavor is strong but not particularly well balanced by and malt flavor. I would have enjoyed more citrus flavor like in the aroma. The bitterness lingers strongly after the finish also. The mouthfeel has a light creaminess, and goes feels nice and smooth. Carbonation is subtle, not sharp. Overall this beer is a nice bitter hop selection, but needs more malt balance and sweetness to make it excellent. Very good..."
"Pours a thick amber color with just a touch of haze, and a nice beefy layer of foam that's sticking around. Incredibly bold hop aroma, cascade-y and centennial-y and a couple others I can't quite nail -- strong pine notes over a thick base of citrus. Tastes like all those, with the lemon aspect coming out a bit more strongly in the flavor than in the smell. A little sweet at the outset and full-bodied, but finished with quite a stiff bitterness. A little over the top, in fact, even given the clear prominence of the malty sweetness. That's the only thing keeping this from supreme drinkability; the hop aroma really makes me want to come back for more each time I put it down."
"Pours a copper-orange hue topped by an inch or so of off-white head that subsides after a couple of minutes. Nice carbonation in the form of tiny, tiny bubbles that keep on coming for a while. Aroma of spicy, grassy hops, along with a hint of grapefruit and just a hint of sweet, biscuity malt. The hugely assertive hoppiness on the palate is offset just enough by the sweet malt to keep this beer from being over the top. The hops are grassy and bitter, with just a hint of anise lurking behind the scenes. Body is substantial and just a tad sticky, providing a good vehicle for the lupulin to coat the tongue. Strong, but quite drinkable. I'm glad I discovered the Green Flash."
"12 oz. stubby with no freshness date. It pours a hazed copper with an inch of fluffy khaki head that sticks well, leaving big patches of medium to large bubbles on the glass. It smells like a west coast IPA, with tropical hops (grapefruit, mango) and dank, resiny hop oils. On the palate it is medium and quite smooth with a big tropical hop profile, contributing grapefruit, mango, and hop leaf, and leaving a healthy bitterness along the way. Despite the ABV, this is an easy drinking beer for those looking for a west coast hop fix and my only complaint is that it could have had more of a malt background. However, I will definitely buy this again."
"Hops aren't as over the top in the taste as they were in the nose. Resiny citrus with straightfoward bitter kick. Malt presence is minimal, but it does provide some mellow caramel flavor towards the finish. Not as crisp and clean as I like my IPA's, but still a great beer."
"Overall this beer is a can't miss in the pantheon of west coast ipas and dipas."
"Imminently drinkable... absolutely a fantastic beer, and the first I have had from this brewery. Looking forward to trying more of their in the future."
"Pours a hazy iced tea and orange color with a soapy, clingy light beige head. Very good retention. Very floral, spicy, somewhat piney and candy-like in aroma, attention mostly focused around the hops. Well, there's no false advertising going on, this is certainly a """West Coast I.P.A.""". Predominantly hoppy and bitter, however, some tea-like malt sweetness comes through mid-palate, adding some depth and a further bit of toastiness comes through nearer the finish. But the obvious attention-getter of this ale is the hops and their orientation to the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S. Playful carbonation accentuates the long, bittering finish on this one. I could easily put away a few and take a hop nap."
"Green Flash West Coast IPA is, without question, a good version of the style. The brewers have taken care of the essentials--quality ingredients in a sufficient quantity--and have crafted yet another delicious IPA from a state that leads the nation in delicious IPAs. I haven't yet sampled them all, but I feel fairly confident in stating that this is Green Flash's best beer."
"Drinkability: A hophead's dream? Maybe, yes. A West Coast IPA? Indeed. I'm a huge fan of this and I'll definitely be buying it again. As I said, it's intense, flavorful, and, quite possibly, not for the faint of heart. In that case, you may want to think about it, or you can take the chance. When can I get some more Green Flash? I hope the other styles have as much going on as this does."
"A slight astringency (batteries, pennies, metal) takes away from this and sends it towards the hop-tea pile of West-Coast IPAs. Still, an intense change of pace that I could definitely enjoy from time to time."
"(I could go for a few of these, yessirree...)"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1""" beige head above the somewhat cloudy amber brew. Pillowy head lasts nicely, with plentiful sticky lacing. Aroma is malty sweet with strong fruity and piney hops. Taste is the fruity/piney hops indicated in the nose, with a light undercurrent of grain, and closing with licks of pine all over. A bit over the top for me, but then again, that's the west coast way sometimes. Mouthfeel and drinkability are acceptable for the style. A bit harsh at times, but a nice over-hopped IPA if that's what you need."
"Drinkability: A very nicely balanced IPA that is a great example of the San Diego IPA style"
"D - this is an extremely tasty brew, but almost a little overwhelming. Hop flavor is very intense and really dries out your mouth. Still, I could down a couple of these and be a happy camper. Interesting example of the new wave American 'west coast' IPA."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and light crystal malts along with loads of citrus hops. The taste is good also. It has an intensely bitter hop flavor that goes down slow and warms on the finish. THe malt bill provides a stable balance and an elevated abv. . The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking IPA. It has good malt flavor and a heavy hitting hop character."
"I dunno, this West Coast IPA just didn't hit the spot for me. The two elements were too far apart and that dead zone was a turn-off for me, pure and simple. I'll stick to putting Stone's IPA in my Stone IPA glass from now on and pass on this brew."
"Try it for comparison"
"WTF? I REALLY did not expect this to be a good beer, and I was correct: This is a kick ass beer! I know of a few better IPA beers but not very many and none of those are as affordable as this one. $11 a six pack is practically the deal of the century!"
"12 ounce bottle."
"Beautiful appearance. Great head retention and lacing. Massive assault of pungent, resinous, grassy, and floral hops in the nose. Medium-full bodied with a perfectly crisp carbonation. Firm, toasty/bready malt base. Layer upon layer of resinous hop flavor. Bracing bitterness. Finishes a bit too resinous, and that tends to hold what bitterness is there for just a little bit too long. West Coast IPA? No doubt!!! Be forwarned then, if you're NOT a hophead, this one will slap you senseless! :)"
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and satisfying. There's a tight, mellow carbonation that really acts as a nice catalyst making this beer easy to drink down. Another solid IPA from the great state of California and one I would be drinking more often if it was readily available. Thanks to blitheringidiot for the hookup once again."
"Pours an amber color with a small head that is gone fast and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is comprised of all US hops - citrus and pine - with almost no malt aroma. The flavor follows suit - tons of hop flavors that just mask any malt backing that could be around. I would prefer to have more caramel malt in the flavor. The body is moderate and the drinkability is good."
"Pours a superbly clear deep copper color with a finger of white head that falls quickly to a light coat over top. Good looker. Nose is resinous, with big American citrusy, juicy hops over top a very sweet caramel base. I really like the nose here. Flavor is more malt focused. Good caramel and light toasty base. The hoppy flavors are lighter citrusy and a kiss of earthyness, with a good resinous peppery bitter on the finish that hangs on well after the finish. Feel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. Pretty standard, and not setting itself apart. This is a pretty solid brew. No hint of the 7% ABV anywhere. The bittering hop is a touch too strong for me, and I would like to see more flavor hop coming through. Overall, this one is pretty nice."
"This baby is hoppy alright, but it's a real floral hop, not really feeling it. My mouth feels like I just took a sip of perfume. the beer seems to be constructed well, just not my style of hop i guess."
"Ooured a slightly hazy burnt orange with a thinner but sticky white head that leaves spots of lace as it settled.Fresh raw hop aroma comes at ya hard when first opening the bottle extremely piney with big grapefruit notes as well I even noticed a touch of caramel malt as well.Well oddly enough hop dominated hop oils and resin dominate quite piney but that resiny finish is great just enough of a hint of caramel makes it a gem in my mind.A few years ago I would have thought a good beer but a little over the top for me now I take it all in,gotta love the hops."
"I just had a pint of the Green Flash IPA while in San Diego so I was excited to see it distributed in Southeastern PA. The price was very reasonable at about $35/case. The hops were strong in this IPA but not overwhelming as in some other CA IPA's. The beer had a pine flavor which was tasty. It poured a nice head and was very drinkable. It's ABV is at 7% so it won't (hopefully) get you in trouble with the wifa. A very good IPA & better than most than I have had and I am a hophead. Cheers."
"This is a very good IPA. Obviously Amarillo hops, but not overdone, which some beers with Amarillo hops have. There is a nice malt base, and hop bitterness is there, but not in your face. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: I'm glad this beer has made it to my area. A very, west coast style IPA, hence the name. Plenty of big, hoppy flavors to satisfy any hop head. Well balanced and very easy to drink. Alcohol is well hidden for a 7% abv IPA. Session some these guys and you'll be tasting them for a while after the fact. An IPA that has found a home in my beer fridge. Definitely worth seeking out."
"The beer poured very well into a pint glass, and even as I drink it now with half remaining it still has a very delicate, frothy ring around the glass. It leaves a nice lace as you drink, also. The initial taste is very fruity, then a hop bitterness at the end followed by a smokiness that is more characteristic of a scottish ale. The more I drink this beer, the more I like it!"
"I'm shocked that this beer is only getting a B rating. One of the widely distributed West Coast IPAs that is always consistently awesome. The bad part about this beer is that it went from being served in a 12 ounce six pack to a four pack and costs more now than I ever remember it being. Pours a bright copper color with light khaki cream colored head, forms even speckled lacing evenly coating my chalice. Aroma is great packs in Simcoe, Centennial, and Cascades probably a couple more hops...but it packs the aromatics in with pine, earthy, floral, citrus grapefruit peels, even a touch of pungent marijuana like smell, very green. Rolling aggressive hop bitterness with ample caramel malts to balance out the heavy handed hops. A really nice aggressive West Coast IPA with balancing hop bitterness to dance with. It's a shame that the beer is running around 14 dollars a four pack or I would gravitate this IPA much more often than I can currently afford to. Flavor offers an earthy herbaceous, grapefruit peel ridden hop bitterness/flavor with a lingering hop bitterness that makes you feel like you brushed your teeth with hops. Ample sweetness from the malts makes this more palatable than your average unbalanced hop bomb. Mouthfeel is coated with hop oils and is medium bodied with a flowing carbonation level. Overall very drinkable beer that brings joy to hopheads across the country, although I prefer Port Brewing hoppy offerings to this I can't seem to get any of their beers locally."
"Lasting white film covers the hazy orange hue. Delicious honeyed malts envelop lively bright citric hops, evolving into leafy and floral territories in mouth. Agressively dry and mineral in mouth, it is fully citric, but not overly bitter. Medium bodied, woody dryness, peppery. Pleasant small-bubbled carbonation. A very aromatic example that I can see people appreciating a lot. A most excellent IPA"
"edit: sipping a stone ipa right now which is pure hops. sort of longing for the malt balance that this beer had. world class, imo, and I will certainly get me hands on more of this beer."
"Notes: I've yet to find an IPA as solid as this from top to bottom. Throw in the fact its priced at $7 bucks a sixpack it then becomes even harder to argue against this brew. THE BEST!"
"Pours a clear copper with a little over a finger of fluffy white head. Fresh citrusy and piney hops. Maybe a little caramel in the background. Bright and crisp hop flavor. Strong, yet not overpowering. Mostly orange and lemon in the hop flavor, but some grass and pine are in there too. Enough malt to stand up to the hops without being really noticable. Medium mouthfeel with plenty of carbonation. Very refreshing, it'd be easy to knock a couple of these back. Really happy to have this as an option in Phoenix now, I'll definitely be getting this again!"
"Poured a deep copper color with a nice fluffy head leaving a nice lacing. Nose is malty but I am not catching the blast of hops that is to come. Taste initally was a bit more heavy on the caramel malts than usual for this style. But then look out for the blast of hops that finishes the sip! Mouthfeel is very nice for the style, very full and lively. Overall drinkability is good but watch out for the ABV if you are planning on making this a session beer!"
"Thanks to brewandbbq for bringing this hoppy nectar to the East."
"Flavor is all hop bitterness. Oil. Furniture polish oil. If you like hops, if you love hops, don't stop, pass Go, collect $200, and go here now. We are talking seriously bitter, almost sour hops that drown everything else out. Some like that. For me, I like balance better, and so I have to give this one a pass."
"Drinkability- Almost didn't grab this one. In fact, I didn't. Ed at Ledger's tossed it in my box as a freebie after I had made my purchase. Very good IPA. Going back for a sixer next week."
"Very nice in the mouth, the flavor transoms give you a lot to think about but at the same time are blended well enough to enjoy without effort. It is not incredibly velvety but neither is it alcoholic, which makes the beer quite drinkable, especially for 7abv."
"Pours a clear full copper color and is topped by a frothy light tan colored head. The aroma starts out with a raw herbal hop note but then moves to softer, sweeter citrus notes of grapefruity and orange peel. The taste has a slight sweetness up front which carries through towards the finish. The malt sweetness accentuates the grapefruit-like citrus hop notes, but there is also a noticeable raw hop note that is a mix of herbal notes and pine. The beer has a solid bitterness to it that slowly builds towards the long astringent, lingeringly bitter finish. This is a nice example of an IPA, perhaps the body is a bit thicker than usual and at this point I might like it a bit thinner, but come another day the body would probably hit the spot just perfectly. Perhaps the finish is a bit too raw and astringent with the heavy handed hops, but it definitely is an enjoyable hop blast of a beer."
"Full, round mouthfeel. Nice bitter finish. Good drinkability. I agree with my main man, tryemall(thanks for the beer!), this beer could benefit from a little more malt backbone. Otherwise, very nice, very hoppy W.C. IPA."
"Overall: not a bad session IPA."
"Had it on draft at the Liar's Club, and I just found this to be a perfect example of an extremely balanced, citrusy/piney IPA with a solid malt backbone. This isn't going to bowl anyone over longing for that West-coast hop attack, but I would be proud to serve this as an intro to anybody unfamiliar with the American IPA style..."
"The beer abandons the stubby 12-ounce brown bottle a cloudless deep amber with a behemothic frothy light tan head that slowly fades away leaving a fine coating of lace to encircle the glass. Nose has a nice hop floral spiciness, undergirded by the sweet malt, quite crisp and fresh to the senses, start is sweet with a nice but light grain profile, top a bit light for my liking. Finish is adequately acidic, the hops persistent in their spiciness, dry aftertaste, a nice drinkable IPA, that doesn't murder the tastebuds and fits in nicely on this 112 degree day in sunny Arizona."
"A good interpretation of the west coast IPA and another good Green Flash brew to add to their lineup. The pour and the apperance of this brew were outstanding with a dark copper color and a very nice fluffy white head that stuck to my glass and stayed till the end. The smell was very hoppy with an earthy quality to it as well, and very citrusy. Most of the malt flavors are burried under the very bitter hoppiness, but I for one like the hop flavor that it has. It is very raw and may not be the most balanced IPA, but it is lots of that great hoppy taste. The lightly sweet maltiness sneaks into the flavor at the start and is noticable in the finnish, but the hops are definantly the star here. Green Flash seemed to get off on a slow start, but with this beer and their latest anniversary ale, they seem to be getting on the right track."
