The truth is, it is hoppy I can't drink much of it straight up and I applied my license at mixology to make very interesting hybrid beers using this like hop head jet fuel.  So you don't get the wrong idea, I do enjoy Ruination and West Coast IPA.  In summary, this beer is pretty special.","snilsen13","Feb 11, 2015"

Very floral aroma, pine, citrus, resin. A big whack of hops but pleasantly so. The bitterness dominates the taste but there is also a nice underlying malty sweetness. Medium to full bodied, thick texture, semi dry finish and a gentle alcohol warmth. Plenty of hops but some lovely balance to this one makes it very approachable. 9.","magpieken","Feb 04, 2015"

Read a couple of reviews and saw this being likened to Sierra's Bigfoot. That's a pretty fair comparison. Tweak some of the flavors into a darker, smokier, maltier spectrum and you'll have a very hoppy Bigfoot on your hands. Plenty of different flavors to be found depending on where your focus is. Varying citrus notes pulse on the palate with a substantial malt body. I paid $2.99 for a twelve ounce bottle and I'll happily do it again.","ommegangpbr","Sep 09, 2014"

I like a hoppy beer and I'm a big fan of other SN beers lke Celebration Ale and Torpedo but this has absolutely no balance (I know, its supposed to be a hop bomb) and the varietals of hops they used completely missed for me.  I drank about half the bottle and drain poured the rest.  I know that other "hop heads" love this beer but they also love Sculpin IPA which again I can't stand.  I like other IPAs that are 100 IBU's so its not the degree of bitterness that offends me, I just think that it's either a poorly crafted beer or my taste buds just can't appreciate the flavors that other beer advocates seem to enjoy.  I guess that's why we have these ratings in the first place.","ELS","Sep 06, 2014"

4.5,7.7,,,,,,"First time having this since last year.  Pours bright gold with a full, foamy white head. Nose is citrusy, maybe even green apple. Alcohol is definitely present as well. Taste is bitterness up front with a lot of citrus, grapefruit, and some tropical fruit. Quite a bit of malty sweetness as well, but that could be due to age. I believe this batch came out in May. No doubt about the 10%+ ABV here. Pretty boozy but it's covered up well by the hops. Mouthfeel is pretty much dead on. About what I'd expect from any DIPA (or dare I say TIPA). Overall, this is a great brew. I love when this beer hits the shelves, but I don't go out of my way to get it. Stuff like Enjoy By, which is pretty readily available to me all year, is really the best you can get.","MisSigsFan","Aug 27, 2014"

4.18,0,4,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"No two ways about it, this sucker is a hop bomb. It has a beautiful amber body with a short-lasting off-white head. Big resinous notes waft up from the glass, citrus and woody, with a strong caramel malt sweetness bolstering it. The taste hits you in the mouth, a melange of hops flavors competing for attention, with no one winning it. It has a very thick body, with an oily quality to it. This is a hugely hopped IPA.","delta490","Jul 22, 2014"

I assume that it is 9%ish - but I am not feeling any heat at all. The sweetness makes it very drinkable - I can't take something that is too bitter. I'd like to have this fresh on tap - I bet it would be even better. That being said this is a solid beer. I am enjoying it.","fscottkey","Jun 24, 2014"

The warmer it gets, the more aromas and flavors I pull out. Most of the lower rated reviews I read point out how over the top this is with it being unbalanced and boozy. I get plenty of malt to back up the huge hop bill. I feel the abv as expected, but not enough to destract me from the other aspects. This one separates the men from the boys. I dont know if it stacks up against my favorites in the style (Head Hunter, Dirt Wolf, Chillwave, HopSlam, Hop Stoopid), but I look forward to having it each and every Spring/Summer, so it must be a winner!","Bone53","May 28, 2014"

Well Sierra Nevada must have seen those review and adjusted the recipe because this beer smells great! Drink this beer from a snifter, and you won't want to pull the glass from your nose. This is also a beautiful looking beer! It has a golden, orange color to it that is extremely appealing. This may be the prettiest beer I have seen, what with the orange color and with a nice, off-white head. This beer is moderately carbonated, with a strong citrus taste (limes, grapefruit), and some nice piney notes. The flavor is (obviously) weighted on the hoppy side, but this is still nicely balanced. There is some alcohol feel, but it isn't over-powering (for me anyways). Overall this beer is fantastic, and one of the best Imperial IPAs I've tasted. I strongly recommend picking up a four pack if you see it!","JosephFlores","May 20, 2014"

Get it fresh, and get it while you can. When I see it I get it, because it goes and stays gone. This DIPA is a guilty pleasure that pushes the envelope of sipping high abv. craft brews. It's delicious, piney, resinous, sticky, and if a sessionable ale can ever be a heavy one, this one has me rechecking the barometer, because it won't stop going down without rechecking the limit. I feel this hits a zen-marker with regards to hop intake. Stay local, stay in. If it's out on tap, have one and remember it for later.","TBoneJones","May 02, 2014"

The aroma is of citrus, caramel, pine, marmelade grape fruit, passion fruit, basically everything you except from a DIPA but even more. Pretty much the same is the taste, everything in the right balance. In the end it leaves a nice oily bitter taste. The exceptional thing here is that you can never tell any hint of the 10.4% alcohol! Probably the best DIPA I’ve tasted, along with HighWater’s Retribution!","Tsekouratos","Dec 26, 2013"

Fairly malty though. Moderate bitterness with citrusy hops throughout, bread crust, alcohol, an a faint burnt sugar edge. Medium to full bodied with creamy carbonation, warmth, and a bit of dryness on the palate. Pleasant overall, with less focus on hops and more on the malt and alcohol -- at least for my tastes.","DrJay","Dec 24, 2013"
4.44,6.2,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.25,"Poured from bottle into chilled pint glass. Cloudy caramel/orange/amber color. Thin foamy head dissipates to thin but lingering remnant. Tremendous sticky lacing all the way through. Moderate carbonation and plenty of tiny bubbles. On the nose, orange/mango pine dominates, with some dankness present. Can smell the malt as well. On the palate, the maltiness adds chewy depth to the mouthfeel, which coats completely. The alcohol is not overly assertive, which seems surprising given the heft of the brew. Hints of something sweet appears -- a subtle toffee butterscotch perhaps? This is a complex DIPA indeed. Not as striking as Sucks, but very enjoyable nevertheless. Will definitely come back here again.","JohnParadee","Dec 22, 2013"

The good news is that the extreme amount of alcohol content is barely noticeable underneath the mountains of hops. This beer certainly lives up to it's name, overwhelming you the moment you pop the top off and smell a floral garden. The color is rusty, the head retention is decent, and the lacing is beautiful. The taste, as you might expect, is pure hops and pine cones so I would suggest drinking at least three hours removed from your last meal to avoid heartburn. It's a little bit too sweet for me, but overall a fantastic beer if you are craving hops to the maximum. I love this beer for it's sheer novelty, and great delivery. Again, not for everyone, but a must-experience for hop lovers.","Isrealite","Dec 20, 2013"

DW almost seems muted compared to some of these and its complexity is what sets it apart, like this does. I like it enough to seek it out for a hop fix that's not a hop blast.","Scrapss","Nov 03, 2013"

Smell is amazing. The aging on this bottle has subdued the super strong hop tastes that I have had before with this beer. Still amazing. The taste has a huge malt profile, which as a IPA you would not think it might not have. Overall I wish I could buy this beer all of the time.

The taste was a relentless hop explosion that seeped into every square inch of my mouth. It started with a clean bright citrusy hop that melded with a sweet malt honey flavor and ended with a resinous pine bitterness that lingered on my palate and would not let go. The flavors mellowed a bit as it warmed and created quite the hop thrill ride. The mouthfeel was syrupy and substantial and the high ABV creeped up on me even after one glass. The Hoptimum was an intense hop experience that was worth the ride and my palate will never be the same. This is one of my favorite Double IPAs and I look forward to its release every year.","brurevu","Oct 07, 2013"

Taste was out of this world, lasted well past the initial drink. In the mouth it felt like a premium IPA, bitter, dry, and sweet. And I do mean sweet. The resin of the hops are absolutely amazing. I had a 4 pack and drank 2 from the bottle and 2 from the glass. The sweetness of the final few drinks had my lips sticking together. The flavor last forever it seems. It makes everything taste better. Yes, a daily drinker like myself will still get a good buzz from the 4 pack. The 10.4% ABV goes perfect with the 100 IBU.

I bought a four pack of SN-Hoptimum, chilled a beer in the frig and was sadly disappointed, but it had too much of a chill on so I let it sit to room temperature knowing that some IPAs improve a bit with an increase in temperature, yuck. Well I am not going to let a four pack go to waste and I figured I would drink one last night so I pulled one off the rack and stuck it in the freezer to chill a little quicker, laying it on its side on top of some frozen hamburger. I got really busy and forgot about the beer in the freezer. This morning I hauled a perfectly frozen bottle of Hoptimum out of my freezer. No broken glass, no popped top, no leaky goo. Still not wanting a bottle of beer to be wasted I placed it in my frig hoping it would be thawed when I got home from work. Holy sweet mother of god something happened but that Hoptimum is absolutely freaking fantastic, still has carbonation, still has a great aroma, and best of all tastes amazing. WTF! Did i get lucky, have I messed with some cosmic equation and rewrote the beer laws of physics? I plan on doing the same with the remaining two beers just to make sure I did not have a run of good luck, in which case I blew it on beer instead of at the casino. So the jury is still out on Hoptimum, but if Sierra Nevada wanted my input on their brewing process for their brands of IPA right now I would say this, "Please do not mess with Torpedo and make more of it."","IPA_OR_NOTHING","Aug 16, 2013"

Somehow they've managed to maintain the characteristic IPA bitterness while taking the edge off the sharpness in the mouthfeel, creating an experience so smooth and flavorful that this beer can truly be savored. The high ABV makes one bottle enough for me. Only downsides would have to be availability and price - I don't find Hoptimum very often and when I do, a four pack is more expensive than a six pack of the Torpedo - that's the only thing that keeps me from buying and drinking this more frequently.","StrangerTides","Aug 16, 2013"

Lots of booze on the nose with some floral hoppy notes and slight pine…not getting as much hops as I was expecting. Alcohol is the first thing I taste as well, hot at the beginning and present in the aftertaste too. There’s a small amount of citrus and fruit but it’s mostly resin and pine and more resin. These aren’t my favorite hop profiles, but I respect well-crafted ones. Unfortunately, this is way too unbalanced for me. It’s just a boozy mess. It feels like it’s easier to drink as you go on, but that’s only because there’s so much booze in it! I think anything over 10% ABV is just pushing it for DIPA’s, the sweet spot being between 8 and 9. Otherwise it just comes off as abrasive.","greenmtn1111","Aug 02, 2013"

I'll try to figure out the freshness code [added August 4: according to Sierra Nevada website, it was born on the 141st day of 2013 which is May 21] but the label says 2013, I picked it up from the cooler at a local Krogers. Looks like a typical IPA but very subdued aroma, I was really trying to pick up much else than some breadyness and slight pine. The taste and mouthfeel was like syrup, overly sweet malt and viscous, with a bit of booze. Again, I'm barely noticing the hops, even the bitterness came across as something in 30-40 range, was not balanced at all. Hard to detect any hop flavor, it might be hidden as a tropical fruit note in the malt sweetness? I kept thinking this can't be right, their standard pale ale has more hop character than this. I'm left thinking that imperial IPA type beers are much less stable in this respect, if you can't tell freshness or you know it's past a couple months, I wouldn't bother, the heaviness of the alcohol or malt or something just smothers it.","kpoole25","Jul 30, 2013"

Poured into a glass, the beer was a copper color with a slight white head. Though the beer is well hopped, the aroma does not necessarily demonstrate this quality. I was surprised by an enjoyable flowerly aroma. In the initial taste, one gets sweet and flowery hops. Over the tongue, the ale was warming and resiny. In the aftertaste, Hoptimum evolves into peppery and grassy hop notes that warm as they go down. For a beer that is well stocked on shelves, this a nice and well-rounded imperial.","JohnnyHopps","Jul 26, 2013"

4.31,3.1,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Looks good. It's a nice golden color. Not too light, not too dark for an Imperial IPA. There's a solid, fluffy cap of head that leaves some lacing with each gulp. The smell is fantastic, with grapefruit and pine dominating the nose. The taste is very similar, a wonderful combination of grapefruity citrus and pine. The alcohol is slightly more noticeable than I would like, but it still goes down smooth and has great balance for 10%. Mouthfeel is right on point for the style. Medium body with a slick, oily, resiny character that I really enjoyed. Not my absolute favorite 2XIPA, but a very, very good one nonetheless.","JMUbrewz","Jul 10, 2013"

Finishes with sweet caramel malt and sweet bitter orange peel pine hops on the end is quite bitter. This brew seems to be dominated by hops.

Personally would like a little more of the citrus charachter to shine so it's not just a total hop bomb, but that's how it's meant to be, so it's judged as such. Great beer.

First thing you smell is yeast and it smells like a pils. Dank. I even thought to myself "Ooh this is gonna be good." Light caramel malt, tropical fruit. Oranges and grapefruit. Lots of alcohol on the nose. Earthy and a little grass. Taste is the definition of hop bomb. I have been saving the phrase and I choose to spend for the first time on this beer. Resiny, oily and bitter. The tropical qualities of the fruits are lost in the background. Piney, boozy, lots of alcohol on the palate. Not subtle, not hidden not masked. There is plenty of malt in this. Goes from light caramel to bread and honey as it warms and some sugar to top it off. Mouthfeel is sticky , heavy, chewy, plenty of alcohol and alcohol dryness with just a touch of sweetness from the malt and from the fruits to remind you that they were there. The malt saves this beer but the fact that so much of it is needed to balance all the hops means that it adds to the heaviness. It felt like the hops were thrown in for the mere sake of hops and there was no real complexity or fruity flavor. The bitter was tolerable but combined with the heaviness and the alcohol it was altogether unpleasant. It drank hard. Short on actual flavor.","utopiajane","Jun 12, 2013"

3.98,-4.8,3.5,4.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Hoptimum is an explosively flavorful imperial IPA, with a wonderfully complex hop presence that is most appealing in the finish. It is certainly a competitor in the IIPA sweepstakes, and is closer in taste and feel to Hopslam and Maximus than it is to Ruination and Palate Wrecker. In other words, it is sweet as well as bitter, and is wet and almost grapey in a chardonnay kind of way. To my taste, it is too sweet, and I find the experience on the palate--a sweet opening followed by a bitter finish--to be jolting and dissonant. It is an impressive brew with a fabulous aroma and great complexity, but I'll take a Ruination, Palate Wrecker, Green Flash Imperial, Mongo or several other IIPA's over this any day.","Cobrito","Jun 05, 2013"

That being said when I went into my regular habit to pick up some Double Jack and Pliney the Elder and he was out of both he recommended this Hoptimum and said you will be happily surprised with it so reluctantly I purchased took it home and poured it into a glass and sampled. It smelled great so I asked my wife if she wanted a sip. She drank and said oh Pliney. I laughed and said no Sierra Nevada she was shocked so I drank some and wow this beer was great it had great hoppy, citrus , piney flavor, it had great color and, good head. I highley recommend this beer to any IPA Lover. Even with a 10.4% and 100IBU this beer is very well balnced this will be a staple in my fridge.","baconmapledoughnutman","Jun 05, 2013"

It tastes salty and peppery, and has a celery thing about it...all of which have been dunked in nice alcohol. The taste is actually pretty difficult to nail down regarding the particulars. Perhaps the best thing to say is that the taste is big. This is about as hoppy as you can get. I will get this again.","TeamMathis","Jun 02, 2013"

As I said, I unfortunately can’t smell much out of my nose, but then again that might say something about this brew since I CAN smell something from the top of the glass! The taste when you drink it is pretty cool because it starts off basically tasting like super hoppy OJ (or otherwise just regular grapefruit juice) and there is this caramel sweetness that weaves in and out making it appear balanced at one moment and at the next next seem like a hop head’s wet dream wrapped in pine.

Hoppy aroma, natch, with any adjective you might want to use for DIPAs: citrusy, hint of grapefruit, earthy, soapy, dirty. A strong hop aroma but there are wiffs of caramel malt that sneak out as well. What I like best about this beer and something that is hard to do when you have this much hops and alcohol (ABV over 10% and it is not noticeable, making this one real easy to pound a couple and feel it later) is that not only is not a palate wrecker but is smooth, somewhat chewey and creamy, and even with all the spicy, sharp citric and grape hops in there, one can pick up some sweet caramel and bread malts as well as touches of other fruit which I'll bastardize and say "tropical". Well-balanced, great beer and to summarize both hoppy and pleasantly balanced with some sweetness and a must have for any serious beer drinker.","clayrock81","May 19, 2013"

Sweet piney bready...wow really amazing. Its so smooth for the abv..I mean scary smooth. Its almost a chugger. Its rare to come across a beer that is so smooth at such a high abv.

Sierra Nevada proves to be a solid brewery time and time again. Although best enjoyed fresh, I think the hop blend and high ABV of Hoptimum will lend to a good life span for this style.

The bottle says it uses whole-cone hops and is, “Aggresively hopped, dry-hopped, AND torpedoed,” and I can’t argue with the results. It tastes extremely fresh and clean, which makes it incredibly drinkable, especially in warmer months. It’s easy to see why this isn’t a year-round beer from Sierra, AND why it’s so hard to come by when it is available, especially given the whole-cone hopping.","BeerNotes","Apr 21, 2013"

Pours almost like a lager, golden-clear, no haze at all, which is weird for a DIPA. Head is about 2 fingers of creamy tan bubbles. I would say this beer smells more in the piney-earthy realm more than the tropical fruit realm, along the lines of their Celebration Ale. This beer is all hops! Wow, bitter and boozy, but in a good way, don't look for any malt here, the malt got run out of town.

The appearance and aroma were great, but it fell on its face after the first sip. (atleast for me). Very bitter, not just in flavor but in the mouthfeel as well. My jaw started to cringe and cramp up, like when you eat a very sour lemon or sour candy. In my opinion, to many early hop additions and not enough mid to late hop additions to equal out the flavor to bitterness ratio. Again, I maybe way off compared to what others experienced, but I only got half of this beer down before sending it back. The ABV's were a litte high as well without enough malt character to mask the ethanol flavor. Maybe i'll try this one again and get a different experience.","jhutch31","Feb 27, 2013"

4.06,-2.9,5,4,4,4,4,"I sometimes drink beer warm. I also sometimes cork the bottle and finish the next night. I have discovered that this beer actually taste better the second night. When you let the beer go slightly flat, the bitterness is less, and the flavor improves. I like the beer cold and fresh. However, I'm curious if anyone else has heard of doing this. (I just didn't want to throw the beer out and put a cork in the bottle.) When I tasted it the second night, I liked it better. (The beer is very carbonated, I also had a cork in the bottle) I have tried this more than once with this particular beer. Let it go slightly flat, the bitterness leaves, it taste great! Cold or Warm. Even when it goes slightly flat it is more carbonated than some other beers.","Brew_More","Feb 22, 2013"

The aroma is pure hops, citrusy and floral with strong underlying pine. The aroma alone is intoxicating. Moving into flavor, lots of pine and very bitter. The bitterness fades for a moment but the pine remains. The Bitterness returns in the finish in the form of incredibly bitter grapefruit with notes of pine. Mouthfeel = Excellent. Low carbonation and a full, almost oily mouthfeel. It coats the mouth with the taste of resinous hops. My only real complaint is that it's not available year-round.","silverking","Feb 12, 2013"

This bombards you with hops so complex yet so well weaved that if it has more than one type of hops I'd be surprised. Smooth and flavorful, it's easy to drink yet 10 percent ABV.

The nose is huge and amazing. Tons of fresh resiny goodness with hints of grapefruit, pine, tangerine, white pepper, and caramel. The taste is just as big and just as bold. Over-the-top resiny fresh hops, sticky pine, pink grapefruit, orange peel, mango, caramel, lemon, and a touch of apricot. The mouthfeel is oily and slightly thick and chewy with an amazing tangy, bitter biting finish. There's no doubt that this is a hop bomb with huge and aggressive bitterness. But it's incredibly drinkable, especially considering the ABV. Of course the balance is skewed, but there's enough malty sweetness to keep it honest.

4.22,1,4,4.5,4,5,4,"This is an excellent DIPA as it's built to showcase hops and not malt. Very balanced drinking with long hop bitterness and great aroma. Lacks some complexity versus some others but wouldn't hesitate to buy more. It's very easy drinking for it's ABV and can sense the Sierra sense of style with this one.","Durtdiggler","Nov 21, 2012"

As the glass progresses, it becomes a little more boozy. The bitterness level is appropriate for the level of hop flavor and the ABV. I would buy this again, for sure.","Mic-Lee","Nov 19, 2012"
4.06,-2.9,4,4.25,4,4,4,"Hoptimum is a must have for anybody who loves hoppy, bitter, and floral beers. Its main criticism is that the citrus and tiny malt backbone do not balance out the hops well. Well, it's true to a certain degree. The hops are heavy in this one. VERY heavy. But sometimes, that's what you're looking for. This beer must be sipped and cared for tenderly. It will stretch your taste buds to the extreme, and then throw them from the cliff. If you're looking for a hop bomb, look no further.","tectactoe","Nov 19, 2012"

We drank straight from the bottles so I can't really describe the head or the lace. I fell in love with this beauty at first drink. This beer isn't just hoppy, it's insanely hoppy, and packs one hell of a punch at 10.4%! One of the best tasting beers I've ever had. It's like an IPA lovers equivalent of meeting Jesus. If you haven't tried Hoptimum, you're robbing your palate of an amazing experience! Thank you, Sierra Nevada!!","JayDub667","Nov 02, 2012"

Smell is a really nice mix of peppery alcohol, caramel malt and citrusy, piney hops! Tangerine, apricot, jelly bean aroma. Taste is more hop-forward, with malt in the middle and a nicely balanced finish that is both a little bitter and sweet. More citrus flavors - grapefruit, etc. Hides the alcohol quite well. Mouthfeel is smooth. Pretty dry, mouthwatering finish. This is a pretty awesome beer. I wish I had more.","AaronHomoya","Oct 31, 2012"

It truly is Hoptimum. I am truly pleased with this beer, 100% worth the price. If you are even a mild fan of IPAs, you need to check this brew out. Bravo, Sierra Nevada.","Samuel906","Oct 27, 2012"

There is little to no haze in this beer, and it sits in the glass regally though I see no carbonation bubbles either. There is a slippery lacing that appears on the sides of the glass when you give it a swirl, but that slides away immediately. The smell is wet with hops, but surprisingly weak for a DIPA. I was looking for more smell here, and perhaps my bottle is old but it’s just much mellower than I was hoping. There are good undercurrents of bready malt and caramel and there are good fumes of citrus mango and pine floating here, but overall just underwhelming. The beer tastes fat with piney hops that kiss the tongue sweetly and travel nicely down the throat. There is some nice light bread in the undertaste and aftertaste, and some really great resiny pine just coats the mouth in a wonderfully filthy ichor. The pine is definitely front and center in the taste, but there is some light fruitiness floating nicely below it. There are also different types of pine flavors in the beer, which is neat, some more bitter and some succulently sweet. The mouthfeel is that of a thick cloying bitter thing that sits on the tongue and is quite lovely for the style. The beer is clean, smooth, and faintly bubbly and harsh on the tongue but overall fairly mellow and slightly chewy. Overall this is a nice double IPA. I've had it several times on tap and always liked it but never been blown away by it. It is by no means the best, and is definitely hop heavy, which I like but some might not. This is a tasty drink that hides its 10% well and goes down nicely. It’s not for the young tongue, however, as the hops definitely have a kick, but I like it.","Maxwell","Aug 21, 2012"

I don't know if its the best imperial ipa i've ever had but it ranks up there easily. At 10.4% ABV, it is well worth your money (for the 4-pack) and well worth your time (for the any-occasion).

This one was exactly what was missing. So far, this is the best replacement for Hopslam (which comes and goes fast, and is overpriced - IMO) that I've found. I can't count Pliney the Elder, which is sublime - but I can't get it in Florida. This beer is certainly balanced towards the hoppy side, but not many double IPA's aren't.

There are some tiny bubbles that can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The aroma of citrus, sweet malts, and resinous piney hops come through. The alcohol is not detectable in the aroma. The flavors are very bright and juicy. The citrus and pine flavors are intense and the sweet malt provides a strong, yet subtle backbone for this beer. The alcohol is not detectable in the taste, but it can certainly be felt. There is hop bitterness in the very back end, but it's mostly confined to the aftertaste. The body is medium to full with adequate carbonation. The beer is smooth with a dry, yet sticky finish that provides a pleasant aftertaste. This is highly drinkable for such a big beer.

The grapefruits and grassy aromas are dominant here with an explosion of fruitiness lurking underneath. The taste is incredible for my first impression. Hoptimum shows it's complexity from the gate with a certain hoppy bite that I haven't experienced before. A blast of flavor from the good variety of hops used. It's bitter but not overdone. Solid, I say. It is not too heavy of a double IPA and the fact that it was put together neatly allows you to enjoy a few of these without tasting the ABV too much. You can't hide from the 10.4% though. A killer brew that I will grab more 4 packs of when I see them. The Bigfoot of IPAs.","mindlucent2007","Jun 17, 2012"

Tastes sweet and sugary with an essence of orange candy. Oily hops, pine, bubblegum and a distinct alcohol heat wrap everything up. Medium bodied and primarily smooth, but some rawness creeps in toward the end, possibly due to the alcohol or hops, a fact that does not work to the detriment of this beer.

4.22,1,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Much anticipated. The Godfather of American hops brewing a big-ass Imperial IPA is long overdue. Clear copper with an inch of crisp, white foam on top. The alcohol and body is apparent with a quick swirl in the glass that shows off the legs of the beer. Almost sweet in the aroma with a blend of bright, citric American hops and alcohol esters. The palate reveals the slightly aggressive hopping I was hoping for with a big punch of vibrant pine and juicy citrus. A smooth ethanol note persists through to the finish along with a backing caramel flavor. I guess I was hoping for the malt-minimal, dry, West-Coast Double IPA. Hoptimum is more of "balanced" Imperial IPA, but an awesome beer, nonetheless. Despite the malt heft and alcohol, there is a smooth and vibrant hop flavor that manages to stay in the fore.","bump8628","Jun 05, 2012"

Moderately floral and fruity, with the sweeter flavors melding in with the malt profile. I do get some caramel, but there's also a mild bready, biscuit-like malt presence. This pairs very nicely with the floral and fruity flavors (particularly the peach). Mildly sweet and moderately resiny on the finish, this beer is medium in body and moderately carbonated. The alcohol is a lot more noticeable on the palate (and your sobriety) than on the nose. Despite being sweeter than I typically like, this is very good.

Last year (the first year of distribution) at Novare Res in Portland, ME they had it on tap--I had vaguely heard about the release of the beer through the artist, Nate Duval, who designed the label. Had to try it, was served really cold in a balloon glass, and it was amazing. I wish I could have sat there all night and drank two of them. But at nearly 10% abv, one is definitely enough before your mouth gets a little chewy--like most IPA's. Needless to say, I wanted to find the big bottle of Hoptimum the next day but couldn't find it anywhere. Then came this year with the new release of the 12 oz 4 packs. I picked up a couple packs and took my time getting to each one. The beer in the bottle was good--but it wasn't nearly as good as the year before. It had a bit of a rough aftertaste, while refreshing and citrusy, it had a bit of a rough side to it, an almost bitter aftertaste that was not a welcome experience. Very good beer, very good brewery, but I think I want to stick to this one on tap.","phaley87","May 18, 2012"

However, the strong citrus scent doesn't match up with the taste. From the taste, you can tell that this is a DIPA with huge malt character. There is a strong alcohol-like sweetness. The sturdy malt backbone requires big hop flavor to provide balance, and piney and floral hop flavors are there in abundance, providing a very sharp bite toward the finish, maybe a bit too sharp. Personally, I would prefer a stronger citrus flavor than pine/floral. Mouthfeel is oustanding, with hop oils noticeable on the tongue. This is one powerful DIPA.","DeltaGolfSierra","Apr 27, 2012"

3.88,-7.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of a DIPA, it was one bitter, intense, and palate wrecking beer which is what I want from the style but it was just a little rough around the edges and didn't seem as clean as some of the best in the style. This beer doesn't have that great of drinkability, it didn't go down smooth and the high amount of bitterness made this beer last me a while and I couldn't see wanting another one after this, one is just enough for me, but I did think that the alcohol was hidden well. What I liked most about this beer was that it didn't follow the usual citrus heavy profile most DIPA's tend to have, this one was all about combining different hop flavors together, I also really like the appearance. What I liked least about this beer was the drinkability, this is one of the least drinkable DIPA's I have ever had, it's so intense and bitter that drinking another back to back just isn't and option for me. I would buy this beer again when looking for a really intense DIPA, but I don't think I would buy a four pack, a single is just enough for me. I recommend that any hop head give this beer a try. I thought this was a solid DIPA, but the flavors come of a little harsh and tend to be a little rough around the edges, still a good DIPA, but those imperfections knock this beer out of top tier range. If I had a choice I would chose a Hopslam or Double Trouble over this beer any day. Good job Sierra Nevada. this was another quality brew, which is what I have to come to expect from you guys, you got some skills with the hops that pretty much no one can deny, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Apr 18, 2012"

Pours a translucent burnt orange with a loose, quarter inch, cream-colored head that eventually settles into a thick band around the shoulders and a dollop of cream in the center. Nose reveals sweet grapefruit notes, a trace of tropical fruit and a piney quality. Taste consistent with nose; however an earthy bitterness runs down the center of the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-light (but closer to medium), with an assertive carbonation that is slightly prickly. Consistency is somewhat oily with a light viscosity. There's also some residual heat that lingers at the back of the throat. Overall, another solid brew from SN - these guys rarely fail to satisfy.

The pleasant hop aroma gives an impression of the rich, citrusy bitterness contained within the coppery-deep orange hue of the first bottle poured and tasted. Once it hits the palate, rich, deep caramelized grapefruit hop essence strikes your tongue and delivers instant refreshment. The ABV (10.4%) does not overpower the flavor, and in fact, helps to deliver a drinkable imperial IPA for the West coast style aficionado without pushing it's way down. Each sip is to be savored and appreciated for the true achievement that it is.","2814","Apr 04, 2012"

Has an interesting sweetness upfront, with a great Hoppy bitterness to finish it off. Sort of a citrus maltiness to it. Could use more of a maple syrup, or caramel type sweetner to improve on the citrus, but I'm not always a fan of the hoppy bitter and citrus bitter. Nice feel to it, a bit creamy, very smooth, and nice medium balanced carbonation and body to it. Overall this is pretty damn good.

Attractive nose of dank hops, bitter citrus, pine resin and grass. The flavor is mind blowing, so much better than last years effort. Intense sweet red grapefruit, mangos,super ripe tangerine, perfect malting, amazing. The mouth is full with crisp hoppy bitterness, a sweet component from the malt bill but overall it is pitch perfect, it really is quite refreshing with absolutely no tell tale sighns of the 10+ abv. The finish lasts for at least a half minute. Bravo to SN for producing a world class DIPA/TIPA on a large scale format. World class on every level.","OTB","Mar 28, 2012"

Taste of big mango, grapefruit, pineapple, orange, pine, honey, biscuit, and light herbal spiciness. Surprisingly light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of pineapple, mango, citrus, and herbal on the finish for a while. Great flavor balance without being too cloying. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a creamy, sticky, and slick mouthfeel. Nice and smooth, but is still definitely a sipper.

Deep, pungent citrus pulp, floral perfume, zesty hop oils, and a nice spiciness. A whiff o' the dank weed as well. Bitterness hits full force with the first sip, but oh man is this a nice tasting DIPA. Juicy grapefruit, pine resin dryness, peppery hops, wood, and some floral notes. Not too sweet at all, which is a big plus...there is some malt to balance, but this is a potent hop showcase. No booziness flavor-wise, but it does warm the throat (and head).

Fine even speckled lacing layers nicely down the sides of my glass, I've also recently had this on tap equally as impressive. Green aromatics, a bit of earthy vegetable notes, green onion, citrus, you name it when it comes to hops and it's here. It almost gives you a buzz based solely on the hop aromatics, a dank weed nose forms as well within the earthy citrus notes. This label states 10.4% abv which is noticeable on the palate with each sip, a beer so big with hops malts and alcohol that it tastes that way. Strong full on bitterness earthy, citric, vegetable hops like opening a bag of fresh hops...this beer has it. Whole cone hop concentrated in a double IPA malt base. Mouthfeel has a full bodied oily hop based texture with even carbonation that flows evenly. Overall excellent flowing DIPA, that has mucho mucho hop character, gotta love it.","WVbeergeek","Mar 12, 2012"

Pours a very clear amber bronze sort of color with a 1" eggshell colored head retention isn't bad, especially considering the ABV. As it recedes it leaves a little lacing in my glass. Smell is absurdly aggressive, I get lots of citrus, grapefruit and a bit of orange, a bit of pine. There is a slight sweetness to the smell as well. I was surprised that this does in fact have just a touch of noticed bitterness. It is rare that I detect that anymore. The sip starts out with a slight hick heavy sweetness. In the middle of the taste I get that noticeable bitterness with some of those sweet orange/grapefruit notes. the beer finishes with a residual pine bitterness and a slight vanilla taste. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy smooth, a slight carbonation gives it some life. This thing is really a hop-bomb. The flavors blend together quite well, giving this mildly complex beer a taste that subtly morphs as it progresses across the palate.","gkunkle","Mar 12, 2012"

4.05,-3.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Served from bottle into a Bell's tulip. Poured red-orange with a three finger off-white head that subsided to one and a half finger very slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grapefruit, citrus hop, alcohol, and pine. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, pine resin, pine hop, citrus hop, alcohol, and grapefruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. I was really pleased that this one didn't have the usual Sierra Nevada pine tree aspect going on here. It was pretty nicely balanced with the citrus notes they put in place. The alcohol in this one however makes itself known without a doubt and makes it a little harder to drink. Worth trying if you get the opportunity.","thagr81us","Sep 01, 2011"

They've been around long enough and they know the community well enough to realize that, really, you don't need to try anymore. Just stick some extreme-sounding slogan on a bottle, coat the top in wax, charge 15 bucks a pop and, bingo, watch as the high reviews come rolling in. They keep pushing things forward, even though they really don't have to.","mynie","Jul 20, 2011"

3.97,-5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"2nd tasting, 9.Aug.13, btl dated 7.jun.13: Looking this time for big Simtra flavors, which I've found is a great combo. And there is some good grapefruit peel and skunky resin with orange jellies up front. But there's not enough aroma somehow - too much balancing caramel malts? - and the booze kills the head retention, which doesn't help the aroma, either. Still falls short of admittedly lofty expectations.","StJamesGate","Jul 07, 2011"
4.07,-2.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"O: Very rich, flavorful and not for the malty brew fans out there.

Watch out, but enjoy the ride.","Gambrinus1184","Jul 04, 2011"

3.95,-5.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"On tap at Hoptomic. Pours a rich brassy amber hue and is capped with a big frothy head; looks par for the Sierra Nevada course, AKA good-lookin'. The nose is piney and cannabis-ike, with lesser notes of tangerine and pink grapefruit. The taste delivers a large amount of bitterness and alcohol, too much in each case. I do not object to the level of bitterness, I just don't find it to be dynamic enough. Still, it is an above-average DIPA, with a lot of tell-tale SN flavor. The feel is big and creamy, as most of the SN brews are. Overall, nice, but not any better than the average offering from this brewer.","ktrillionaire","Jun 22, 2011"

The taste was citrus, orange, pineapple, apricot, peach, and lemon with peppery, herbal, and floral notes on a caramel and honey backbone. This was like a Sierra Nevada pale ale on steroids.

3.54,-15.3,4,2.5,4,4,3.5,"Notes: Not quite the effort I expected from Sierra Nevada. With their gratuitous hop usage they succeed in creating a massive hop bomb, which I suppose is the name of the game when it comes to the West Coast DIPA pissing contest. But it could do with a little more subtlety. I believe the style is at its best when it retains a high level of bitterness, yet lets those nice tropical fruit flavors come through. There is also a huge disparity between the taste and smell of this beer. I think they need to tweak the aroma hops.","ryan1788a5","Apr 09, 2011"

Not one of those Barleywine-esk double IPAs, this is true to IPA flavor with surprising ABV of 10.4%. I actually compare it to a Maharajah of Avery brewing Co. Which is quite a compliment.

Flavors are carry-forward from the aroma - toasted malts, piney hops, tangerine citrus. Mint leaf still comes in with a sweetish finish. Hops also turn bitter to balance the malts. The palate is creamy, a little astringent to the touch. Body is medium to full along with adequate carbonation throughout the drinking session.

4.42,5.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"2011 release. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. The beer is a vibrant, crystal clear orange-gold coloring with an immense, foamy, light head that starts about two fingers and slowly recedes as you drink. The head retention is impressive for an IPA. Nose is heavy hops, both dry and fresh aromas, flowery, and with a slight citrus hint underneath it all. The beer has a spicy hop flavor that hits mid-tongue at first, and then you get an all-over the tongue hoppy flavor. Other flavors include a slightly sour citrus/grapefruit note, as well as some peppery highlights. The beer is creamy and robust in mouth, and the body does a great job of carrying all the strong flavors. This beer is heavy, and extremely tasty. The aftertaste (prepare for a shocker) is all hops, with some of the citrus sneaking in there, too. The finish lingers, with the bitterness giving a slight pucker to the tip of the tongue, and the hops continue bouncing around in mouth while you contemplate another drink.","GarthDanielson","Feb 19, 2011"

It is unclear whether Sierra Nevada had some benchmark in mind when they built this immense beast of a DIPA, or if they followed the "kitchen sink" approach. It lacks the smoothness needed to be an attempt to clone and bottle Russian River's Pliny the Younger. It could be a lesson in styles, intended to show those that want to pin the DIPA label on Bigfoot just how off the mark they are. Like something distilled and timeless it is best when slowly savored, reminding of Port Hop 15, Alpine Exponential Hoppiness, or Avery's The Maharaja.

Full bodied for sure but with the right amount of carbonation. The way it hits the palate belies its 10.4% abv. It seems quite a bit lighter. Balanced palate.

Taste is deep pine flavour, like succking the trees needles! Mild caramel malt middle then a return to a bitterness for a dry finish. Aftertaste lingers. Mouthfeel is resiny, juicey and overall mid heavy mouthfeel. This is what I imagine sucking on a whole cone hop is like. Large format bottle is an interesting choice, limits drinkability to one per session but for me that's ample given I'll likely ration my remaining Hoptimums since availability for me is scarce. Seriously bitter experience, props to Sierra Nevada; one of my favourite breweries.","heebes","Feb 09, 2011"

Yet these complaints seem to pale into insignificance in the shadow of the brute force of this brew, and as far as I'm concerned anyone that can offer ringside seats to a back-of-the-woods bear pit is ok in my book.

The flavors very wet, very piny, feature some light honey, malty sweetness, and ALOT of alcohol. I'm really surprised by how much alcohol is present. The 10.4% is everywhere and abundant throughout.

No need to bury your nose in this one but when you do, you're in for a fantastic resin, floral and citrus treat. Theres so many different kinds of hops to give it a complex aroma and flavor. It starts with some sweet grapefruit and floral flavors then gets overtaking by a huge wave of hops bitterness than stays on the tongue for awhile. Can kind of detect the alcohol in the finish.

With rare exceptions (Hopsickle's the only one I can think of right offhand), it seems that DIPAs over 8.5 or 9% can't avoid the scenario where a sweet and boozy combo completely derails what the hops are trying to accomplish. Hoptimum comes closer than most to pulling it off, but falls a little short.","PDXHops","Feb 03, 2011"
3.89,-6.9,5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, Hoptimum packs plenty of flavor and bite, however, the bite seems to rely more on the malt profile than the hops. Don't get me wrong, the hops are there and they are abundant, but in a blind taste test I may be unable to tell the difference between this and something like 90 Minute DIPA by DFH. No matter, this near rivals the delicious complexity of Avery's Maharaja, with a juicy freshness that, again, could be tempered slightly by a dryer quality.","jminsc76","Feb 02, 2011"

Appearance is a filtered golden amber with a frothy whitish head that quickly fades to a thing crown with little lacing. Extremely mild, boring aroma of dirt and biscuity malt, with trace amounts of grapefruit and citrus rind hops. A solventy, medicinal tinge is troubling. Onto the flavor. Oof! It get's worse with no balance or cohesion between strong solvent and alcohol, bitter grapefruit rind, sweet carmel malt and dry breadiness. Body is thick and well carbonated, but extremely hot and boozy. After a few ounces I poured this out, so I give this a White Birch trademarked 1.0 on drinkability. I'm probably being overly harsh on this, but we tried this against some hoppy beers from Three Floyds, Shorts and Lawsons tonight and this was the uncontested failure champion.

The head retention is long and the ability to easily recreate it with a few swirls is remarkable for a bottled beer. The aroma is what you'd expect from a top notch IIPA: resinous pine and sweet caramel, all with a touch of vanilla and melon. Light touch up front with just enough carbonation. Things unravel in the middle, though. There is a noticeable amount of sugar, and while the alcohol is well hidden (some is apparent in the finish), the sweetness overshadows the finishing hops. This is not to say that the hops disappear, just that the balance could have been better. Medium to medium heavy body.","LittleDon","Feb 01, 2011"

Taste, as expected, is a big hop punch up front, same profile as the nose lots of citrus with some pine notes. A seemingly faint malt backbone is present to level things out a bit. Theres a strong alcohol bite to the finish that actually merges well with everything else and really kind of compliments things instead of taking away. Thoroughly medium bodied with a sticky bitterness to the finish. Split this bomber with a buddy and wish I could have finished it by myself.

Flavor is seriously hoppy and just a little bitter, with grassy, woody, grapefruit and malt hints and just a touch of honey. It is very lip-smacking, and the hoppy component is quite complex and enjoyable. Texture is fairly smooth with a strong and lingering tingle. Finish is hoppy, minimally bitter and fizzy.

Caramel and bready malts almost overshadow the hops, which shouldn't happen. The hops are also fairly one dimensional, with a huge lean towards pine. I like pine resin, but I like it to complement citrus, tropicals etc. Mouthfeel is probably the best attribute of the beer. Medium body, nice level of lively carbonation.

Very sweet start moves quickly to hard core citrus hop resin flavors with a pretty hot booze flavor. Lingering bitter and booze notes. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, I'm not really impressed with this.

There is a presence of piney hops and carmel on the nose. The taste is masked by alcohol, but when I can get that out of the way I find a bitter hop taste that goes directly to a carmel flavor. The carbonation is very high that leaves a tingle long the inner cheeks of my mouth. Not too bad, nothing that takes away from the beer.

Light alcohol sweetness, and a very low but detectable malt sweetness in the background. The flavor is dominated by a complex hop character, featuring citrus, tropical fruit and wood. Hop bitterness is high, but surprisingly balanced by a low, complex malty sweetness. The medium-full body dries out very nicely in the finish, thanks to the hop bitterness and alcohol.

Amazing fresh hops, seriously has that smell of a hop leaf in your hand. Some alcohol and malt but mainly just those fresh citrusy hops. Taste I felt was a little heavy on the malt side. A little sweet. I know you need to up the malt and sugar to achieve something of this ABV but it just seems as though there are some DIPA that are a little more balanced.

4.15,-0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"you asked for it, and here it is... orangey amber with an off-white head that holds forever and leaves tons of lace. very attractive, and pretty much exactly how it should look. nose has a HUGE, dank tropical fruit character with notes of pine and a healthy malt backbone that is pale and pretty tame on the sweetness. very nice. taste is hops, hops, hops with a good amount of bitterness and a malt character that isn't too sweet. the use of only whole cone hops adds a really real flavor and seems like some of the sweetness is actually coming from the hop. medium full body that is fairly dry, but not nearly as creamy as a beer this big would have you expect. a really amazing effort from sierra nevada, and a must-try for all hopheads.","timtim","Jan 19, 2011"
4.17,-0.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a clear-ish amber orange color with a medium sized head that slowly diminishes. Aroma is EXTREMELY hoppy! I get a lot of pine and citrus. Not really any alcohol scent, which is surprising. Taste is just as it smells...A real hop bomb! Although it is extremely hoppy, the bittering hops don't pull through until the end, which is nice. But when they hit, man are they bitter! And the malt profile blends well with this huge DIPA. There are delicious malt, caramel, and citrus notes in this beer. A lot of grapefruit and orange. Tasty DIPA! Mouthfeel is very nice, as it is not too sticky or thick at all. Still very crisp and full bodied. Drinkability is fairly above average, as I couldn't see anyone drinking too much of this...the ABV would kick your ass! Delicious beer overall.","DovaliHops","Jan 18, 2011"

The flavor profile seemed a little to similar to a hopped up barleywine and I didn't particularly like that cannabis like flavor. A solid IPA with a great nose, but at $8.99 for a bomber, it's not something I'm likely to buy again.","Satchboogie","Jan 18, 2011"

Plenty of different hops, some framed as "propietary" but reminds me quite a bit to what Oskar Blues achieved just using Summit hops, right ? on their Gubna, which had a similar cat/herbal/ganga/piss side to it.

In true SN style, the beer is unbelievably drinkable despite being over 10% and the palate is dry and super clean in texture. These guys sure do know how to make hoppy beer.

The taste is a nice amount of crisp citrus hops with a very nice sweet caramel malt backbone that balances things out wonderfully. The beer is medium bodied with only a slight amount of sticky alcohol. This is a very enjoyable Imperial IPA, I'd expect nothing less from Sierra Nevada.","atsprings","Jan 16, 2011"

4.18,0,5,4.5,4,4,4,"The flavor takes a unique approach to the Double IPA, as the mix of booze, raw-cone hop bitterness, and citrus flavors combine well on the palate. Hints of what tastes like vanilla and menthol on the finish...an odd combination for the style, but surprisingly not off-putting. Breathy alcohol out-lingers the hoppiness. Mouthfeel is crisp and medium in body for such a big beer, but that helps in terms of drinkability. Carbonation is spot-on. I was a little worried about Sierra Nevada putting out another hoppy beer that tastes the same as their Harvest/Hemisphere/Estate lineup. Consider my fears subsided...Hoptimum is a beast!","wagenvolks","Jan 14, 2011"

3.36,-19.6,4,3,3.5,4,3,"As you might surmise from my constant notes on the bitterness, this is not an especially drinkable ipa (though to be fair, the high abv is well hidden). Not like drainpour undrinkable, but just too much to drink more than a pint of. I've had younger, elder, expo hoppiness, hopslam and plenty of other super hoppy beers, but this one just does not give you the fruit/citrus notes or any kind of sweetness to counter the pure hop bitterness.

For some reason, and probally obvious, most micro's tend to have a dominate trait or taste to them, and for Sierra, this is that dominate hop but amplified. Big crisp hops start you out on the taste, but a pleasant citrusy finish puts this over the top.

4.75,13.6,5,5,5,4.5,4,"Taste is a huge mouthful of hops that display the fruity character of very fresh hops. The fruit character is balanced by the bitterness of the volume of the hops, and a little bit of alcohol character. Mouthfeel is very clean and a touch bitterness, and the alcohol shows through a bit due to the strength. Fairly drinkable, moreso considering the strength, but the alcohol and bitterness diminish this a bit while still being good.","Zodijackyl","Jan 08, 2011"

4.53,8.4,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"Had this this afternoon on-tap at the SN taproom, poured into a 10 oz tulip glass. It arrived a clear amber with a one finger head, slightly off-white. The smell is a big whiff of hops and citrus. The taste was hop-forward, with bitter and slightly sweet citrus being the strongest notes, though a piney hint was also present, as was a faint hint of alcohol, though not a lot for a 10%+ beer, I have to say. The malt backing is almost syrupy, reminding me a bit of this year's Pliny the Younger. Carbonation was spot on. Very drinkable. If I wasn't driving home, I'd have had another. As it was, I bought a growler on the spot.","excal","Mar 12, 2010"
2.28,-45.5,4,3.5,1.5,3,1.5,"Poured into a pint glass. An amber colored with decent off white head. The beer smells like a lot of hops and some m=bready maltness. The taste definitely seemed off. There is lot of this German Bready maltness an intense hoppy bitterness and a lot of boozy alcohol flavor, there is no interplay between flavors, it just tastes like a boozy mess. Carbonation was fine. This beer tastes like a train wreck","somabeer","Mar 03, 2010"
2.76,-34,4,3,3,2,2,"Draft at Toronado, served in a pint glass. Clear, bright and caramel-colored in the glass, dark for the style, topped by a small white cap. The aroma is solventy, lightly citrusy and heavy on the crystal malt. Pine and citrus-like dry hops are evident but overwhelmed by the alcohol. The taste is similarly harsh, very strong solventy alcohol matched by resiny hop bitterness and substantial caramel malt. While it's not especially sweet, the malt backbone is heavy and cumbersome, too syrupy for a DIPA and lacking finesse. It finishes bitter, heavy and sharply alcoholic. This is OK stuff and signature Sierra Nevada; heavy on the crystal malt and bittering hops but not particularly delicate. Can't say I would drink this again.","largadeer","Feb 25, 2010"
