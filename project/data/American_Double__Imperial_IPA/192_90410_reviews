"Not a bad beer. Definitely not a go-to IIPA for me, but probably the best offering from NB I've had yet. It's plenty hoppy enough for most, with a decent amount of flavor. It's lacking body, though. Again, not a bad beer. Just slightly off, in my opinion."
"Big let down. Poured copper color with a big white head. Smelled delish but tasted like old mop water. Pine taste with a strong bitter dry finish. Not for the faint"

"Nothing standout, but was a solid beer for the style."

"Has New Belgium gotten to the point where they are penalized for who they are? It appears that way because this is an excellent IPA that I would put right up there with the Torpedo and Stone IPA. Hits all the right notes that a west coast IPA should. Nothing special to look at, but aroma and taste offer plenty of resinous pine notes with hints of biting citrus. Just a hint of balancing malt sweetness. Body is on the light side of medium, with crisp lively carbonation and a clean dry finish. Add the fact that I can find this easily for $8.99/6 pack and it's clear there will be a lot of this in my fridge this summer."

"smooth bitter with a nice finish, some peaches in there too"
"(Bottle, revisisted). Pale appearance. Estery smell, bananas.  Drier finish than expected; 3/13/15."

"a very affordable Imperial IPA"
""
"Lighter and clearer in color than most IPA's, but it's taste let's you know it's true to the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The look is not too special, a little clearer and more translucent than a typical Imperial and lighter than most IPAs I favor. Not much head but moderate lacing throughout. Aroma of anise, juniper and maybe butterscotch. The taste is simultaneously sweet and bitter, mildly citrusy, moderately carbonated - definitely its best quality. Mouthfeel is a torrent of syrupy, boozy malt checked by a defiant melange of hops varieties with all the familiar dankness of American hops, though more prominently just bitter than floral. It lingers appropriately, as an Imperial and an IPA should. It has some of the best characteristics of an Imperial and many of the great characteristics of a hallmark American IPA. It'd be a really great Imperial IPA with some more aromatics and floral finishing hops."
"Fruity on the nose, a little bitter on the palate."
""
"Rampantly delicious, say no more."
""
""
""
""
"Man, this was disappointing. NB is real hit-or-miss these days."
""
""
"Overall: This is a longstanding go-to IPA for me and many others. Everything about this beer is very well done by the masters at New Belgium. I rate it very highly and everyone  should try it."
""
""
"The very definition of a double Ranger...Sweeter, a bit more bitter, and often only $.50 more than Ranger! Its feel suffers from the a similar thin-ness to Ranger, but this one just feels more syrupy. Maybe its just overally resinous but I'm not sure. Another great budget Double IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Excellent IPA with hidden high ABV. Will seek this out again in the future."
"I realize it is an imperial, but this one fails to balance out the bitterness.  """Burly""" as the description puts it is right.  Perhaps a bit too burly.  I enjoy it, but there's too much IPA competition for me to buy it regularly.  Still rates solidly in my book."
""
""
""
""
"Clear, golden pour with thick, lasting white top. Aroma of pine. Flavor is pine again, and great malty balance. Very tasty brew!"
""
""
""
"Pours a nice copper color with a thick white head good lacing, pleasant aroma. Excellent flavor, nice bitterness, but sweet maltiness balances flavor. Truly a masterpiece."
""
"New Belgium is truly one of my new favorite breweries. Their Portage is one of my fave porters, this is one of my fave Imperials. I find myself eyeballing Portage telling myself I want it badly' and I will do the same with Rampant."
"Solid Imperial IPA. The peach/apricot notes are abundant in the flavor. It's definitely on the sweeter side but that's not a bad thing. There's a slight pine aroma but the peach/apricot fruity notes dominatelike the flavor. The Rampant has a little bit of lacing, there isn't much head to speak of, but overall it's a tasty beer. I'd recommend trying it."
"Great as usual from New Belgium."
"I prefer IPA's so I have a few ranger's first, then I enjoy the sweeter Rampant."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite New Belgium brew...not too hoppy, not to malty, just right."
""
"Just happened to try this one day while out on a beer run and I found a jewel of an IPA!  Very heavy on the ABV but with a really smooth peachy taste.  Not so heavy on the pine like the Ranger.  The look is a lot cleaner as well.  Pours clear with a good head on it also."
""
""
"Edit: After having a few of these (I bought a six-pack), I still don't get any peach flavor but it has definitely grown on me. A good everyday IIPA."
""
""
"Overall- Not a bad brew.  It is pretty good but not a stand out."
""
""
""
""
"For the price, this one is hard to beat for the DIPA fan."
"Not bad at all, goes down smooth with a kick of hops"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good for a not craft beer"
""
""
""
"Completely clear, bright gold color.  The head is white, falls quickly, but leaves copious lace.  Great aroma...Pine, resin, and grapefruit rind.  The taste is forceful...powerful bitterness, some warmth, underlying sweetness, and huge hop flavors.  Spice and pepper.  It's an assertive beer, and very enjoyable.  Very full in body."
""
""
"Great for the price!  I would love to have this one fresh from New Belgium."
"Overall-I would say that this beer never fails to disappoint and is my go-to beer when I can't find any other IPA that I haven't tried yet or don't trust to be hoppy enough. New Belgium has done it again and I think Rampant is worth every penny. Just be sure to drink it from a nice glass in order to get the full experience, because the head and appearance are every bit as savory and pleasurable as the flavor itself. Do not mistreat this baby, for she delivers every time."

"Good strong IPA with bitter hops at the forefront.  There is some sweet aroma and a good look.   In the same taste arena as other Imperial IPAs.  Good strength.  Grows as you sip on it."
""
""
"Very solid Citrus DIPA.  Great value as I got the 6-pack for $7.99 at the local grocery store.  My new go to DIPA."
"V - Good value, available in six packs of bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Insane everyday imperial.  Hop burst, biscuit notes.  Will not let down."
"O- great citrus notes on a very drinkable dipa"
"This beer is very tasty! Much enjoyed!"
""
""
""
"O: I dig this one. Very drinkable for an 8.5% brew."
""
""
""
""
"The hops run more herbal on the tongue with some perfumey rose petal,  pine bitterness, light chive, garlic bulbs, spruce needles, lupilin and honey. This has a ton of flavor but it just isn't my kind of flavor."
"Overall - An imperial IPA with a good citrus profile. The bready caramel malts tend to edge out some of the bitterness and balance out this brew. There is nothing wrong with that and a pleasant experience nonetheless."
""

""
""

"high taste of alcohol with subtle hoppy notes. fairly bitter"

"lots of good qualities but something gets in the way of greatness at every turn, I doubt I'd buy another bomber with so much to try on the same shelf"
"A light quaffable DIPA that is refreshing and easy drinking. Georgous brew. Great clarity with a golden hue, bone white head, and tons of lacing. Nose is light as well with a mild tropical note. Pine and light citrus. Malt brings sweet aromas. Taste does have the peach like character as well as stonefrut and a mild nuttiness. Finish is dry and short with a clean but a large hoppiness that kisses the mouth lightly with a memory of hop oil. Feel is light and supple with velvety carbonation. Super drinkable and this goes down like a session ale instead of a DIPA. A very nicely done hop showcase."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good for a DIPA. The malts are pretty strong in this ale, and add some balance and sweetness to the fruity hops. Not overwhelmingly hoppy. Pretty balanced overall. Would get again."
""
""
""
"This one was kinda old too, but the hops are still rather strong in the aroma and taste. A nice blend of fruity hops, a bit sweet, pretty great IIPA."
""
"Great IPA that is very smooth for 8.5 ABV."

"Enjoyed on 12/12/14. Enjoy by date 2/15/15. 8.5.% ABV."

""
""
"One of my favorite all-time beers.  Great combination of flavors.  I'm partial to the Belgium ales in general but this is top shelf."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: it's a decent beer, but nothing I would seek Out. If you are looking to try a IIPA for a first time, this would be a decent starting point unless you already have a taste for hop forward brews"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty good beer that tastes more like a hopped up IPA than DIPA. I'd still recommend getting this and I'll probably try to fit this in my regular rotation."
"Review from iPhone so brevity is key. I enjoyed this drink. Rated against other imperial IPA beers I would have to say it is very disappointing.  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale has much better flavor. But rated against other, regular IPAs, it can hold its own."

"Clear golden orange color, nice head, retention and lacing. Very nice floral and tropical mango aromas with just a touch of citrus. Taste is very fruity, with big mango flavors, a light touch of watermelon and some slight piney bitterness. Very little malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is semi-light, but crisp, especially for an IIPA, didn't get a lot of alcohol burn from this 8.5% beer. Overall, quite a nice beer, one of my favorites from New Belgium, outside their Lips of Faith Series."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is definitely in my regular rotation."
"O- Pleasantly surprised by this beer. It has a nice variety of hop aromas and flavors. Maybe not as hoppy as many top DIPAs but for the money you will spend on a 6 pack it's a deal that is hard to beat. Just make sure you get it fresh. I'm really starting to warm up to New Belgium's stuff. I love there sours and Rampant, Ranger, and Accumulation are all pretty good hoppy beers. Still not a fan of many of their non sour bomber releases though. I had been wanting to try this one for a while but could never really find a fresh bottle until now, glad I did."
""
""
""
""
""
"...For me Rampant is an almost perfect Imp.IPA...With a 8.5% alc content the balance between Hoppiness and Alcohol flavor is near perfect..can only sightly taste the alcohol...Typical fruity/pine smells...and also some marijuana smell too...great beer and if u can finD it u can get it cheaper than most IMP.IPA"

"Taste: I was a little disappointed that the hop flavor didn't keep up with the alcohol flavor. It tasted too much like liquor for my liking. Not a bad beer. I would drink it again, but probably not buy it if I had other IPA choices."
"Great hops! Second only to the superior Bell's Two-Hearted. I do love this beer, especially for how strong it is, and how smooth it is."

"Good price, great taste, and **outstanding** ABV for the flavor. When I need to save a couple bucks or I want to really get fucked up off a single six pack, this is my first choice. New Belgium produces high quality brews across the board and this one is a star. My only reservation is that we've got em beat here in Texas. And Cali. Definitely recommended."

"Great drinking everyday IPA"
"The taste is citrus oriented with a grapefruit quality and pine-like bitter taste wtih almost salty intensity and intense peppery spiciness with warming alcohol in the back of the throat with slight sweet flavor but not quite caramel in the finish with light nutty malt in the background. The overall impression is a pretty decent yet not quite exceptional Imperial IPA to me. It is a little to alcohol forward in the taste for me but better than most with more hop flavor than less as far as this style goes. It is lacking hop flavor which is what I like to see more of instead of just bitterness"

"Solid IPA"

"My 4.00 is based on taste+price.  Super solid.  Go cop a 6 pack"

"Overall (3.82) : This IPA is tasty - and I generally HATE IPA's. it goes down easy and doesn't leave me heaving over the garbage can (okay maybe an exaggeration). Try it, you will probably like it."

"Yeah, this is really good. Definitely one of my favorite that New Belgium putts out. For a DIPA this one is a little tangier than some, more fruity and orange like in the nose. Nice copper red body, good carbonation, poured into a snifter. Presentation has a lot going for it right now, I've got it at a great temperature and its leaving a beautiful lace on my glass. Nutty and hoppy, somewhat oily, even a little vegetable (celery or onion?) like in the taste. Aftertaste has some nice malted backbone. This is solid. Good beer. That orange kick is a bit interesting, not good or bad. Some brown sugar like sweetness at the end. I like it, and would buy it again."

"Not sure I knew what to expect from this beer but it didn't sit right with me. Perhaps I have gotten away from enjoying the big beers and opting instead for session beers. The hop was in my face and i was unfamiliar with the hops in play. I might not have been in the right mood for this beer or it isn't my style to judge. That being said the Ranger IPA is one of my favorites."
"Overall:  There is a great amount of hop flavor going on, but what is even more impressive is how dry it finishes.  A great offering from New Belgium and a solid DIPA thats available in 6 packs."

""
""
""

"Pours a light copper yellow body with a white head. Has a fresh hop smell. Very hoppy aroma. Very bitter flavor. It really hits your palate. Also has a rich caramel taste. Decent beer."

"I love a good IPA, but for folks who don't dig the hoppy aftertaste of IPA's, this one's right up yer' alley!  Great hop taste without the after fast that you non-hopheads don't dig.  Hophead or not, you'll dig this one."

"This is an excellent and reasonably priced DIPA.  I think I only paid about 8 bucks for a sixer."
""
""
""
""
"O: have yet to brew with it, but Centennial might be my favorite American hop, hands down... does this remind me of Hoptimum? maybe a little - I could be off - I've had so many hop rockets like this... a well-made IPA"

"Carbonation is too high."
""

"Tasted fishy.... Yeck!"

"Taste comprises more resin and malt with a nice bitter after bite.  The mouthfeel is pleasant and full with medium carbonation finishing slightly astringent.  Overall this is a great value for those on a tight budget seeking a good hop fix."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""

"Poured out a medium golden with a meringue-like white head. The head leaves significant lacing throughout the glass with moderate retention. The aroma has some light fruit notes and a robust malt sweetness. The taste is a little lacking, and doesn't pack the hops punch expected from an Imperial IPA. It doesn't taste bad at all, just not the flavor profile expected from the style. The body is a little thinner than I'd like, as well. All in all, it IS a good beer, just not quite the one I was wanting and expecting"

"Not remarkable but definitely memorable and respectable."

"Pours a very nice clean/clear dark golden yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice two-finger thick creamy white head, lots of nice sticky lacing with a huge island. The nose is slightly hoppy, with some sweetness. The taste is hoppy, slightly sweet, with a slight touch of pine/citrus. Medium body with a dry/bitter finish. Overall a pretty tasty DIPA, nice to see something different here for a change."

"13 oz bottle from Tipples. Pours a beautiful golden orange color with a fluffy white one finger head. Nice floral hop aroma , bready malts, citrus peel, grass, pine. Flavor is nice bitter pine, floral notes, lightly sweet bready malts. Body is medium to light, somewhat dry, bitterness on the tongue, with medium plus carbonation. This goes down very easy. A slight dirtiness on the finish is my only complaint, and it is very strange. But an otherwise solid DIPA that’s easy to find, and nice and light for the style. Just a weird flavor here and there that I can’t put my finger on."
""
""
"Pours a clear light amber with good amount of off white head and good retention. Aroma is hoppy with citrus peachy, and herbal notes. Taste follows with some grainy notes in the background. Mouthfeel is puckering. Overall a fine beer. A read on the low end for an imperial I think though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Not quite as good as I remember it. However, still not a bad drinking bigger IPA in a six. The bang-for-your-buck factor is certainly there. I might review again one day and see if I can get one a little fresher."

"This is only my second or third venture into an imperial IPA. Picked up a six pack for about nine bucks. Pouring it into the glass released an immediate hop smell, which is exactly what I was looking for. I don't pout aggressively so I only got about a finger of head. It dissipated to a point, but there's about 1/4 finger worth sticking around. It is a clear golden-amber color. Lacing is great. It smells of a crap ton of hops. I'm still working out my pallet and nose, but I do pick up a hint of citrus. When drinking I taste hops, then a bit of pear (which I wouldn't have guessed unless the label said so), a tiny bit of citrus, then a piney finish. Overall I enjoyed this beer. I was craving a good IPA and this fulfilled my craving"

"One of my favorite DIPA's.  Pours a nice copper into a pint glass. You can really smell the flowery hops.  Taste is bold, flowery and bitter. The bitter hops stay on your tongue.  IMO a great beer. It is also widely available and comes in an affordable 6 pack, not the current trend of a 4 pack or bomber for a double ipa. Keep it up New Belgium. Nice work."

"definitely taste the citrus hop flavors but not overpowering. A very drinkable Imperial ipa especially for the price. Covers 8.5 abv well."

"For the price this is a great Imperial IPA.I have no complaints about this beer.No need for a snobbery rating.4s across the board with a mouthfeel of 4.25.I was not a fan of the Fat Tire but having this I may revisit New Belgium more.Going to have another now.Cheers!"
""
""
"This was a great buy, I still have one left out of the six pack and I'll certainly finish that off tonight. A lot of flavor here that hits the taste buds a little hard, but nothing you wouldn't expect from and Imperial IPA. If I had to complain I would like it a little crisper/cleaner and to go down just a little more smoothly. I'm sure I'll buy this again sometime down the road."

"This beer pours a pale straw color with excellent clarity. Nice fluffy head with excellent lacing. The nose is peppery and citrusy, not amazing for the style but not bad - just in the middle. The taste is sweet and the alcohol is present, the hop bitterness kicks in a second later and lingers for a few seconds after you swallow. I wish it had a more resinous hop flavor and feel. The mouth feel is o.k. Overall, this is an o.k. DIPA, it's enjoyable but really leaves you wanting more. Definitely don't drink this after an Enjoy By or Green Flash Imperial. I don't seek this out regularly but for the price it is an excellent buy. You get a nice quality enjoyable brew from a reputable co-op company, so cheers and go America!"

"O: A good, but not outstanding, IPA. If it's on sale, I'll buy more; but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
""
"O- not one I would buy, but not a drain pour if a buddy leaves it over in my fridge. Just not up to the style like their Ranger. It is what it is, a heavy duty hop bomb, but it's a let down for the style."

"Nice to see this in BC. Big hop nose and mid gold colour . This is a solid DIPA that holds the ground between big hops and a strong malt backbone. Very drinkable but still assertive , I really enjoyed this beer ( much like a bigger version of Ranger). Not world class but still worth the purchase."
""
""
""
""
"Good beer, but not one that stands out. Not overly bitter, with good malt support. The flavoring hops are fairly diverse. Obviously not one of the more recent varieties of hops, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a brass color, with an almost still-looking body and a thin head. Hops are strong in the nose: very earthy and herbal. Smell some caramel malts as well. Flavor is obviously hop-forwarded. Hops, as in the nose, are earthy and herbal, with the NB house taste complimenting the hop character well. Malts taste of caramel and toasted bread. Mouthfeel isn't too thick. Carbonation helps to scrub up the sweetness and bitterness. Overall, this is a solid DIPA that is outside of what I normally look for in one."

""
""
"Pours a clear yellow-orange with two fingers thick of creamy off-white colored head, settles to a thin layer with big fingers of lace on the glass. Smell: ?! there's nothing here... all light... stone fruit, floral, windex... cardboard-ish... oxidation issues? this is best by June something! Taste: nectarine, white grape, herbal, citrus rind, garlicky. Drinking this fairly warm and it's not good. Not good at all! If the aroma wasn't absentee, would be better...? Will revisit."
""
""
""
""
""
"Served on tap at my local watering hole into a pilsner glass. Nice clear golden color with a pillowy white head that lingers. Fruity smell with hints of peach and resin. Taste is sweet with notes of creosote and tar, along with fruity characteristics of peach and grapefruit. Not a lot of bitterness here, but the flavors hide the taste of alcohol well for an Imperial."

"overall - ive been wanting to try this for a while and finally picked it up in a mix-a-six. not sure how fresh it (based on the best by date) but still drinking good, would like to revist when I'm sure it's more fresh"

"A classic American real ale. Pleasing in taste. Excellent mouthfeel. Bracing bitterness. Terrifying alcohol content! Bought the Costco 6x22oz pack with two of these, two Rewind (OK) and two French Aramis (terrible). But the two Rampant are worth the price of admission. Guaranteed """forget your troubles""" beer."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium golden amber with a fine two finger white head with great retention (grew for a while after the pour) and tons of lacing. Aroma of spicy (as in winter holiday spides) piney hops, orange family citrus, bready malt, appealing. Flavor is citrus hops, grapefruit, sweet caramel malt, finishing with orange and lemon citrus, mild tropical fruit and piney hop bitterness. Quite nice creamy mouth feel and medium body. The hop formula leans towards European citrus and fruit flavors, with a complex mix of tropical and citrus fruit flavors and sweetish malt. Nicely balanced, interesting flavors and a very nice body. Good job."

"A sort of underwhelming, if still drinkable enough version of a DIPA - a bit all over the place, and weirdly not malty enough, and this from NBB (I guess I sort of felt that way about the Ranger as well). Anyways, ok, but not really worth the effort I've expended in seeking it out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall impression: A slightly muted American IPA. I struggle with this being """double""" or """imperial""". It falls off in the aroma and possibly the choice of flavor hops for me. If this was their IPA and Ranger was their Imperial IPA I'd be more inclined to believe that. Need brighter hops in the aroma and flavor to convince me. Probably will stick with Ranger."

"$8.99/6pk is a pretty good deal for this. It's a pretty solid DIPA. It's very clean and fun to drink. This is simply an amped up version of Ranger IPA, so if you enjoy Ranger you should enjoy Rampant."

"I tried this on tap at a bar a few weeks ago and loved it. Picked it up in a sixer and my opinion is not quite the same. This ale pours a hazy golden straw color with a slightly off white head. This gives way to just a slight film and decent white lacing. The aroma is nice with lots of citrus and pine notes and an underlying malty sweetness. The mouthfeel is super smooth and drinkable. With an abv like this and this sort of drinkability, this one could get you in trouble. The flavor disappoints though. Its not bad just not as fresh and hoppy as what I had on tap a few weeks back. Before I speak my final piece on this one, I want to find it on draft or at least a very fresh bottle to try because I know this beer is better than what I'm tasting right now."
""
"This is the first time I have had this one. I have had a lot of New Belgium's lineup over the years, which I should revisit and review at some point, alas this is the one I have at present. The color is a nice true gold, different than other DIPA's I have had as of late. It has that New Belgium smell to it, I guess its the yeast they use, but just about every one of their beers have it. Its kind of a funky sweet smell, that unlike those true Belgian Trappist and Abbey yeasts. I like New Belgium and as the person previously mentioned this is a gateway craft beer. But also one I would drink again if in a certain circumstance where it was present. I know it says peach on the bottle and someone else said it had a peachy taste, I didn't get as much as I was expecting to get. It does have a nice balance of hops and fruitiness, almost a blend of a Belgian style with an IPA, but not exactly. It is sweet and less hoppy than I would expect from a DIPA, nonetheless, it is good but not spectacular."

"O: something that i would offer a craft beer virgin to get them started into real beers, won't alter much their fragile palates, but enough to make a difference."

"I love IPA's and this is probably by FAR the best IPA I have ever had.. Its smooth, tastes great, smells amazing.. I really love the strong hoppy smell mixed with peach.. that is a rare but GREAT mix.. This could possibly be my #1 favorite beer. If you like IPA's you have to try this... If you had this and don't like it, then either you don't like IPA's or you like lower quality IPA's because this is the best IPA to hit my lips and I've tried tons. It has quality you can taste."
"Pale golden copper hue in the body large semi off white head forms thick with chunks spread sporadically throughout the sides of my glass. Aroma has grapefruit, citrus, big alcohol notes, with passion fruit tropical notes. Flavor has big alcohol notes sugary grapefruit, pineapple, and other residual tropical fruit notes. Mouthfeel is resinous with big sugars and even keeled carbonation, overall a beer I would dance with most of the time unless fresh drinkable Ranger is on hand!"
""
""
"There is something definitely wrong with this beer. It has a very odd odor and an even worse taste. I would love to describe it for you, but I can't put a name to it. It is a sick, floral disgusting smell and even worse taste. I generally don't throw out beer, but am strongly considering it on the rest of this six pack. Not a fan of New Belgium in general, but this is the worst."

"New Belgium's Rampant Imperial IPA, 8.5% ABV. New Belgium makes great """gateway""" beers, sold in chain grocery stores and help to introduce beer drinkers to craft. Rampant features a boozy sweetness reminiscent of sautéed peaches, cooked sugar; a clean hop bitterness with herbal and grapefruit flavors. A little light on the hop aroma, and more balanced in flavor than some hophead would want. Nothing special if you're used to the very best IIPA's, but certainly not a drainpour, and worth the sale price if you can find it."
""
"Not bad at all. Doesn't look overly pretty. there is a nice frothy white head but that sit atop a dull orange beer. Smells nice, a mix of citrus and vegetative hop material. Smells maybe a little rough around the edges but is pleasantly assertive without having one dominant note. Taste is much of the same if slightly less hoppy on the flavor than one might expect. Ends dry and bitter, but has a candied malt notes in the middle (could be the hops). carbonation seems a little low. this is like a really good homebrew."

"Amazing Imperial! Fell in love the first time it hit my lips. Living in Fort Collins, CO for 5 years, I have come to appreciate the craftiness of my two favorite breweries....Odell and New Belgium. I would highly recommend at least trying any brews these two make!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall I was very happy and impressed with this. I'll admit I haven't tried too many offerings from New Belgium other than Fat Tire and I will have to give them another look, this was very good and enjoyable. Almost 'too rich' (hence, the 'Imperial' IPA) for just having with dinner or while watching a game; more of a destination beer than I was expecting. looking forward to trying the Ranger now."

"I had Ranger IPA and figured that its bigger brother ought to be great. Boy was I in for a let down! It looks and smells alot like Ranger, so when I tasted it, I kind of didnt believe it. The word vegetable is the only thing that came to mind. Sweet flowery vegetable. My dad had one and he gave me the same look that I think I initially gave the beer. He also was at a loss for words but we agreed on """vegetable""". I am a hop head and I love IIPAs. This is at the bottom of the list for me. They shoulda tried to make it more like Ranger. And is it just me, or do all the New Belgium beers have a problem with head retention?"

"Overall 4.0: This is the best beer that I have tried by New Belgium. It is big, bold and well-balanced. Huge at 8.5%, this beer is actually dangerous to the beer drinking public at large. Regardless, this beer shows no hint on the palate of its over the top alcohol content and is a remarkably pleasing session beer. Try it if you find it, just don't try to drive a station wagon full of orphans down the mountain after drinking a few."

"Pours out a dark clear orange in color with a two finger white head that slowly fades down to a finger and seems to stay there. Smell is definitely floral with some nice strong hints of resin and pineapple. Taste is definitely hop forward that's less fruity and more resin. Really not very bitter. Really a great put together flavor as you get a little taste of grains to give it a tiny bit more balance than a lot of IIPAs. Mouthfeel is slightly thick -- not that thick but there is definitely more than your run of the mill PA or IPA. Overall this is a pretty good beer and is better put together than I remembered."
"Pours a clear golden with a thick white head and a ton of lace.. the smell is sweet fruit and faint floral hop.. the taste follows with the sweetness increasing as it warms with little alcohol coming through.. there's peach kiwi with a flower hop that more so balances the sweetness.. the mouthfeel is medium to heavy but a crispness follows through the end.. pretty good ipa but with a heavy malt/ alcohol sweetness."
""
"Overall, this is a really good, hoppy beer, which would be a good pairing with other members of the hop family."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The price definitely factors in for me here, If I find this beer at a grocery store, typically for around $7.99, I'll most likely pick it up (especially if drinking for other reasons than taste, 8.5% abv.). An acceptable, hoppy IIPA that will work if on a budget."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear and bright amber with a white head that dissipates quickly but leaves an impressive amount of lacing. Hop forward aroma has a nicely caramelized resin background. Well balanced taste roams from toffee and malt to a nicely bitter finish. Although I can't pick out the specific hop varietals, it is definitely a beer I'll seek out again."
""
""
""
"Buy Again? Yes."
"This is a fruity, hoppy, strong imperial IPA. Very nice!"

"Pours a brilliantly clear, deep golden color with a thin, fluffy, white head with excellent retention. Good amount of carbonation is visible rising though the glass. Smells like lots of hops, mostly pine and earthy in character. There is a slight malty smell as well. Taste is very hop pronounced, resiny, earthy, and bitter up front. There is a mild malty sweetness throughout the taste, and the bitterness lingers through the finish which is very crisp. No discernable alcoholic taste even for an 8.5% beer. Mouthfeel is very smooth, medium high carbonation, and slightly viscous. Overall this is a very good Double IPA, not nearly as extreme as some, both in terms of maltiness and hoppiness. This could pass as a Single IPA to some breweries. Will definitely have this beer again."
"O: Not a bad IIPA."

""
"O - This is far better than Ranger, lots of lush flavor and aroma. Excellent IPA"
"Overall a good double IPA but nowhere near the top beers of this style."
""
""

"Overall, this is an interesting IPA, but certainly on the sweeter side of hoppy beers. Fruit flavors are interesting and unique, but coupled with the sweetness, not overly attractive as an IPA."
""
"O- A pretty unique hop character yet the syrupy sweetness and mouthfeel keeps it from being REALLY good."
""
""

"O- The aroma on this DIPA was really nice, but the body on this beer was a little off in that there was lots of warming and stickiness but it also had a very light finish. An enjoyable beer with some flaws."
"Aggressive pour. Giant head quickly receding to about 1.5 inches which held quite well. Golden amber in color, excellent clarity. Nice lacing that is sticking to the glass like glue. Amazing. The smell is very nice. Sweet malt, hops, pine, citrus. Medium carbonation, Nice mouthfeel, smooth with a little bite from the carbonation followed by a nice warmth from the ABV. Taste is very good, same as the smell, a little bitterness in the aftertaste which is nice. ABV is well hidden. Overall a very nice beer and I will buy it again."

" Rampant Imperial India Pale Ale was golden orange in color. It had a thick white head with great retention and decent lacing. The smell was good with pine and citrus. The taste was very good with sweet malt, pine and citrus hop flavors. The finish was fairly long with fruity flavors and a little bitterness. The mouthfeel was good, it had a medium-full body with medium carbonation. Overall this is a good beer and worth trying out."

"12 oz part of a sixer from Fred Meyer in N.Salem $7.99 a six. Clear bright orange colour in appearance, with a nice sized thick bubbly white head, Aroma..fruity really almost like pink lady apples, floral hop, cherry, strange no malt for an imperial. Taste is also very balanced but this time the chewy,caramel malts are visible to restrain the floral ,fruity hop. MOuth feel is fine enough actually good for style. An unusual beer not really an Imperial IPA though, not to say I didn’t enjoy"
""
""
"Read the reviews, the opinions are all over the place, then read the Rampart web site, different still. Gotta make up your own mind about this one, stirs something different in each taster. That is the mark of a fine beer.... Confuse and conquer! Buy several and get your craft Brew drinking friends over to nail it down."
"TOTAL = 41/50"

"Nice copper color with a thinning white head. Nose is fruit punchy with citrus and grassy hops and caramel to back it up. The flavor is more subdued than the aroma with some alcohol astringency. Still a nice hop/malt balance with good body. Not the best Imp. IPA out there, but worth a try like most new belgium 6ers for the price."

"This is absolutely delicious and extremely floral. One problem, it's too sweet. Imperial IPA means high alcohol and high hops, not high everything. I know sugar sells, but I come to the Imperial IPA for crispness. Like I said, delicious. And complex, but not what I was looking for."

"Super Dank, Super Piny! Oh Baby! The centennial hops are running rampant in this beer. Very dry on the finish and very crisp. The malt takes a back seat here, it doesn't do much besides keeping this beer from becoming insanely bitter. Lots of hop resin in this. I don't know how to describe the bitterness in this except that it's extremely bitter but somehow mild at the same time. I don't understand, to me this makes about as much sense as dividing by zero."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D- Extremely drinkable for an Imperial. The hops come through nice and it's not overly sweet like most Imperials. It reminds me a lot of 90min, it's slightly more hoppy and little less malty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So its quite obvious that Rampant prefers the more East Coast balance and flavor, but maybe even more so than even the brewers there would even dare. But the amount of malt to push the ale to imperial status takes its toll on the hop dominance that even Imperial IPAs deserve."

"M: Medium bodied. Smooth."
"serve it in a tulip glass to get the full bouquet, this Imperial IPA is, IMHO, the best beer that New Belgium makes. Mosaic, Calypso, Centennial hops balanced with a hint of toasted malt make this one of my favorites, and a benchmark I judge other Imperial IPA's by. With a lovely citrus aroma, dry finish and a delicious fruity aftertaste, I can't find another IPA as good for $7 a six pack..."
""
"Pours a clear copper with a big off-white head. A huge aspirin aroma, with hints of pine and citrus as well. Taste begins with a huge mint flavor, followed by a rich toffee and bread middle, and a piney citrus finish with hints of aspirin. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Overall a good IIPA, but a bit too much aspirin character for my liking."

"I'm not a beer expert and I have no idea what you're all talkin about. But this stuff is awesome! Wonderful flavor and aroma; deep rich tones. I don't know what fruit it tastes like, but it's delicious. And it goes great with a hearty meal. This beer has the depth and subtle layers of a great wine. Sorry, but sometimes you need to hear from a lay person and get beyond all of the standard reviews."
"OVERALL: I enjoyed this beer. It's hop dominant like a traditional IPA should be but has it's own unique flavor profile of pine, pepper and peach. Very drinkable even with the higher ABV. I also like the price $2.99 for a 22 ounce bomber. I would recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys traditional IPA."
""
"O - Overall, not the best Imperial IPA I've had. The hops flavors seem aged and muddled. The malt is tasty, but there is a large amount of residual sugar and full mouthfeel that distract and lower the drinkability. I wouldn't want more than one of these in a sitting."

"Overall this brew is easy to like as it is not a whopper and it is nicely balanced with some nice flavors. Definitely can recommend this one!"
"I enjoyed this quite a bit. The peach hints came predominantly from the smell, but came out more and more in the taste as it warmed. The alcohol was slightly pronounced, mixed with pepper in the aftertaste. This has enough character to hold it's own in the Imp IPA world. I would probably get this again."
""
""
"O: I like it. It goes down smooth and maybe too smooth considering the ABV. I would buy it again and recommend it."

"Much nicer than I was expecting, the expressive hop character with its vibrant fruitiness, biting bitterness and light herbal notes that are done at a low enough level that it doesn’t get in the way of the other notes."

"O - Pretty good considering the price. Definitely not NB best offering but a decent beer. I'd pick Ranger over this any day. IIPA is a crowded market and a few more just out shine this one."

""
""
"Taste definitly brings the hops, lots of flavoring and bittering both. Im sticking with citrus and pine flavors and the malt takes on a biscuity flavor. Its actually fairly 'balanced' for a DIPA and the malts are not overly toasty, which I do not like in a hoppy beer. Mouthfeel is nice and the beer has a pretty smooth flow to it. While this is not going to blow anyone out of the water, I personally appreciate a moderately priced six pack of a DIPA and dont think there is enough of them out there. This is one that I will most likely purchase again, dating on the bottles is a huge plus for hoppy beers."
""
" light for an imperial"

"This one surprised me. I now know what """wet""" feels like. This is the wettest IPA, let alone beer, that I've ever had. Extremely nice mouthfeel, very smooth and refreshing. A great summer Imperial IPA. Way 2 go New Belgium, you finally have something I will come back for many, many times."
""
""
""

"I had high hopes for this beer after having their impressive Super IPA collaboration with Alpine. While Rampant didn’t completely blow my doors off, I thought it was a very impressive and solid Double IPA. I did detect some similarities to the Super IPA, but not quite as bold and well-rounded. The light copper color immediately gave off a wonderful aroma of sweet tropical fruits with only slight hints of citrus. This was really a great smelling IPA. The flavor doesn’t overwhelm you with a face melting hop overload but rather an enjoyable tropical fruit and slight dank bitterness with a peak of resinous pine on it’s dry finish. A good dose of sweet malt held all the flavors together into what I thought was a very tasty and dangerously drinkable brew. Rampant is definitely a slightly different take on your typical Imperial IPA, with more ripe fruit flavors and dank hops than pine or citrus, but another well done beer from New Belgium."
"O: Decent Imperial IPA but not my favorite flavors."
""
""
""
""
""

"For a DIPA, the aroma and taste are rather subdued, yet the beer itself is a great tasting IPA on the whole. Excellent balance if not overly complex. The ABV is well-disguised with delightful malt and hop flavors. Very good..."

"The Verdict: Very good. A hoppy IPA with a solid malt backbone, I find nothing to quibble about here at all. Tastier than a lot of the higher rated brews. without beating you over the head with their bitterness."

"Pours copper with a bright white head that leaves a little lacing. It smells very bitter with hints of citrus. Tastes very similar to the nose, bitter hops and some citrus notes. Not very complex at all but a solid choice at your regular grocery store. The mouthfeel is rather thick. Overall, this is a decent DIPA but doesn't come even close to other versions of the style."

"Overall: definitely not a session beer. the 2 minute aftertaste is so unpleasant after experiencing it 3-4 times, it makes me want to finish the pints/bottles quickly, and while the nice appearance, smells, and tastes facilitate that, it is ill advised to drink these quickly, as this rings in at 8.5% abv and will debilitate you / quickly get you to an unpleasant state. 2 pints/bottles of this and the average person will be too drunk to drive. it gets old after 2 anyways, so that's a good place to stop. there's plenty of better IIPAs out there, though this one is no slouch, and it's pretty widely available and only ~$9/sixer in AZ. Worth a try if you come across it, but not worth hunting down. Cheers."

"Beautifully constructed beer. It is only a little bitter compared to DFH 90m, which for me is the perfect beer. Although it left me with a dissatisfaction in aroma hops, it was an awesome deal at $8/6 pack at 8.5%. This beer continues to be my go to for nights that my wife can't understand that I need to drink more than she """approves of"""."

"It's different, I like the variety of the Mosaic/Calypso hops and the stone fruit character on the palate. I think it lacks the depth and body needed for a great IPA. The stone fruit notes remind me of Deschutes Red Chair (which has delicious apricoty quality imo), but doesn't have the body or complexity of flavor to make it inspiring (maybe unlike Red Chair)"

"This is a rich, flavorful beer but still very drinkable."

"This really surprised me, I didn't expect much but it's actually a very good dipa and at a very reasonable price. I'd say this is my favourite New Belgium beer."
"Overall not a bad beer or an IPA but just don't see myself buying this one again as there are plenty of great I2PA's available ."
""
"O: Not bad, especially considering the price. They should have left this one unfiltered though."
""
""
"Pours a clear golden with an off white head. Aroma offers some sweet fruitiness, some floral, with a little pine and a touch of toasted malt. Flavor is sweet fruitiness of some peach and melon, a little bitterness and toast there too. A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, not a bad beer but not a beer that stands out in the IIPA market. Whatever is the polar opposite of an IIPA on steroids, that is this one. I'd drink this one again, but its hard to see why I would choose this over the many other beers of its style that already saturate the market."

"While I think Ranger is a better beer, this is a good unapologetic version of the style and a good value. While not in the same league as anything from Russian River (for example), I think it would only be slightly outclassed by many mid-tier offerings like Hop Henge, Hoptimum, etc."

"O: Not elite, but definitely solid, and for the very inexpensive price point, it delivers the DIPA (albeit a slightly more malty one) fix in a pinch."
"Overall I thought this was an ok beer and a pretty close to average example of the style, it was unique, but the hop profile wasn't the cleanest and it started to wear on me after a while, the hops didn't keep me coming back for more like some DIPA's. This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it wasn't too smooth and the flavors didn't do the best job at holding my attention, one bottle is enough for me, I don't have the urge to drink another one. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and aroma they were both nice with the head and lacing looking pretty damn good. What I liked the least about this beer was the drinkability, I know DIPA's aren't the most drinkable style, but it's just not the kind of beer that I have the urge to keep drinking. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's just not my type of DIPA and I don't think I would recommend it. All in all i was a little let down with this beer, it just didn't come together as well as I had hoped and it's a pretty forgettable DIPA, I wouldn't search this one out and I wish I would have bought a single bottle before I committed to a six pack. Better luck time new Belgium, this beer just didn't work for me."

"overall...well the hopping of this 2IPA is certainly unlike any other, and stands alone in its uniqueness. my guess is that this won't sit well with the citrus and pine hop bomb crowd. as for me, i found it interesting and without equal. glad i got to try a sixer but i'm pretty sure i won't revisit this again in the future."
""
"Overall – A rather tasty brew overall with good transitions between sweet and hoppy throughout the taste."
"O: If you love melon aromas and flavors, this is the beer for you. Smooth, clean and well made but not my cup of tea with all of the melon character."
"O) A pretty good beer that falls just a bit short of greatness by being too one-dimensional and also a bit too sweet for my tastes. Be careful with this ale, it is dangerously sessionable for a IIPA!"
"This is a pleasant beer that is not as potent as the name would suggest, Hey, don't believe me; check it out for yourself. Nuff said."
""
""
"O: Very unique in that I haven't tasted such strong fresh hops flavors before. Tastes like my Centennial hops on the vine smells."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, well, I was a little curious about this one and now I've satisfied my curiosity. Not one I'll need to drink again."
""
"Crystal clear golden color with a beautiful, lumpy head of thick foam. Floral, lemon, and peach hop aromas...earthy resin and toasted malt sweetness. Sharp, oily citrus, pine, melon, and a hint of lime. Dry with a long, lingering bitterness. I enjoyed this..."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This beer is no good. I am afraid the hops have run rampant. Actually I did enjoy this more so than the Ranger. Has a nice high level of bitterness with lots of firm dank pine and spice notes. Not nearly as tropical as I was looking for from the Mosaics but still a decent brew. Would have again, especially when discounted 30% at Albertsons."

"O: This is a """lite""" version of an Imperial IPA so it is quite easy to drink. The things that really stand out about this beer are its appearance and aroma."

"I don't usually look for New Belgium beers but I put one of these into a mixed six."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rampant pours a light bright yellow color, with a nice large frothy head. There is a mellow earthy floral aroma. The taste has a wet floral taste, with hints of a straw like flavors. Nice feel, full flavor, tastes """fresh.""" Overall a not bad Imperial Ipa, enjoyable but nothing special."
""
""
""
""
""
"Tap: Poured hazy golden color ale with a large white foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of fruity floral hops with some nice peach notes and some light residual sugar notes. Taste is a good mix between some peachy and fruity notes with some bitter notes in the aftertaste and also some residual sugar. Body is quite full with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Love the hops mix on this one with great fruity notes."
""
""
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Large head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is hop leaf-strong with some bready malt and pine resin. Hop leaves and pine resin comprise the flavor lightly balanced with some sweetness. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
"Excellent."
""
"Overall it's pretty good but doesn't really stand out. The slightly metallic notes and intense bitterness without a lot to balance it out. It's not something I can drink more than one of in a sitting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good beer, a little pedestrian for my tattooed tongue but that's not it's fault. Worth a try."
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. The beer pours deep golden with a persistent white head and lots of streaming tiny bubbles. The beer has a hop aroma of pine, garlic, and mango with some bready malt. The taste is of some pine and mango from the hops with bready and toffee like malt character. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The finish is a little dry with some back end hop bitterness coating the mouth. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I like the beer, but it isn't spectacular. Something odd in the hops puts me off of this beer, I've been a fan of a lot of other beers they have put out, but in a time when every brewery has a fairly solid IIPA, this one fell short."
""
""
"Overall: not a bad beer, but I feel like the brewers went more for mass appeal than pushing boundaries -- which is what DIPAs are all about."

"What I expected from New Belgium. A unique hop profile coupled with a relative drinkability for the style. Not a blockbuster, but it's decent."
""
""
"Standard New Belgium bottle with raised neck collar and the simple label. The pour was very clear, a touch more pale amber in shade than a typical DIPA. The head was one to two finger thick. The smell was mostly pine and grapefruit. The taste was quite bitter, with a burst of grapefruit, herbs, and spice right up front. This was a very dry, over the top, """west coast""" style DIPA, and I always seem to like them for their singular purpose as a hop delivery vehicle. This was no exception. There was little no malt influence, alcohol burn, or pretense of complexity here. It was like drinking an enamel stripping, head clearing, tongue scraping, hop juice. If you like hops, you will love this. If you don't like hops, why did you buy a DIPA. A hop bomb picked up at the neighborhood Kroger. My we have come a long way in this country, and I like that."
"Pours a nice pale orange with 2 fingers of frothy off-white head. Lots of carbonation visible rising from the bottom. Aroma is extremely weak. Can just barely get a whiff of hops. Tastes great but doesn't really taste hoppy enough to be a imperial IPA. Hops bring out a great tropical fruit flavor with a very sweet finish. Fruity flavors return after swallowing quickly followed by hop bitterness. Hop bitterness does linger on the palate after swallowing though. Not really the hop bomb I expected. I have had other bottles of rampant as well as a glass on tap that were much much hoppier than this one. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy and perfect in my opinion. Overall, it does not seem like a hoppy enough beer for a double IPA but still a great tasting brew and is greatly priced for the style."
""
""
"Aroma is dominated by pine and grass, as is the aftertaste. Very bitter, high in alcohol although it is not perceivable. This beer is just not good, it is bitter without being blanaced and could use a better malt backbone to help counter the bitter aftertaste that stay around in your mouth longer than it should. It also does not showcase hops well but instead just shows that they can be bitter."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a beer that gently foams on the palate, and comes across as quite smooth. Ethanol is well-hidden, only a light bit of heat on the back of the throat. The intense hoppiness and alcohol combine to create a pleasurable bitter tingle in the tongue, which I find to be quite enjoyable. Closes dry, with little residual stickiness on the palate."
""
""
"I did not give New Belgium much of a chance in this crowded category, but in the end they did a good job. The big news is that this is not a $10 bomber or a $12 four pack, but a $10 six pack! The Rampant is not an Avery Maharaja, nor is it an ODells Myrcenary, but for the price, it is one of the best Imperial IPA's going."
""
""
"Overall: I think this is another great imperial. I have yet to come across one I don't like. Kind of low ABV for an imperial, 8.5, but defiantly a beer for even non-hop heads. My old man tried one and coming from a non-traditional """beer drinker""" he very much enjoyed it. New Belgium has surprised me again with their version of the Imp. IPA!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I am not impressed at all with this effort. I don't care for the hop character and it is too sweet. Ranger is a much better beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is creamy with a healthy dose of hop spice and a moderate malt character. Touch of citrus and a chalky bitterness on the finish. Not overly complex but inviting and with a good feel. Overall quite interesting as the beer doesn't come across as being overly sweet yet the ABV is difficult to discern. Nice balance for its heft as the hops cloak the malt which cloaks the ABV is an unusual way."
""
"Overall - Pretty good, the herbal flavor mixed with all the malts gives it a unique flavor. Kind of not the most smooth and balanced beer, you get all this beer has to offer in stages yet its still very enjoyable for a change up. Great price a bomber, worth a drink for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The most impressive aspect of this beer is the look. Pours golden with fluffy white head and loads of lace! Smell is adequate, but below typical DIPA standards. Good taste and easy to drink at 8.5%. Mouthfeel is solid, I can tell I'm drinking a DIPA! Overall this is worth a pick up considering it's very affordable! For me, this is more an IPA for the Fall and Winter; maybe very early Spring."
"Cheers and enjoy!"
""
""
""
"I would drink this again, although, even at $4 a bomber, I may not buy it again. I like my IPA's to taste as fresh as possible, and this just doesn't taste fresh. I took it a little easy on where it would be lower, trying to factor in my lack of scent and taste right now. Although a fairly big beer like this should still be stronger."
"O-There is something off with this beer. I wish I knew what exactly it was."
""
""
"Not a great, steal your face beer, but that's not necessarily what this brewery does. Instead a nice drinking approachable beer that leaves me interested in having another. I like New Belgium."
""
""
""
""
""
"Looks good, orange/copper with a nice foamy head. No problem there. The problem starts with the aroma. It's very strong, starts nice, piney, but goes into something weird that I am not sure what it is exactly, but it's pungent and unpleasant. Taste is similar to how the smell finishes, really strong, but not hoppy strong. The hops are there but they're overwhelmed by something off, totally unpleasant. I wonder if this bottle was not good, got skunk or something. I couldn't finish it and more than half of it went down the drain. I will give it another try and re-review. If this is what it is, not impressed at all. Actually, quite opposite."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is yellowish with a mild haze. An aggressive pour yields nearly two inches of pure white head. The aroma brings pine, alcohol, hops. Booze presence in both the scent and flavor. Too brash for my liking. Pine and alcohol with perhaps a bit of citrus. A slow sipper. The finish leaves booze, biscuits, crackers, and a hint of caramel malt on the palate. I finished the 12 oz., but this is not a repeat for me."
"D - Hop bitterness without a lot of hop flavor. Stange herbal, floral dandelion flavor."
"Overall: Certainly not bad, above average. Will only have the one 6 pack though."
""
""
"I didn't care for this one at all."
""
"It's an OK DIPA but doesn't compare to many out there. Was hoping for a bigger brother to Ranger (which is decent enough) but this falls short. Decent enough but when compared to the rest in its field it is not close to the top."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was expecting an imperialized Ranger, and I got an imperialized Ranger...for better or worse. Like Ranger, I could see this one being significantly better on tap. The dry, easy drinking nature does an okay job of covering up its flaws, but there are still far superior options out there that you should pick up instead - and not even its price point can sway me otherwise."
""
""
""
""
"O- This beer is a big kick in the tongue with a full hop bitterness but no other hop flavor or aroma. It is not sessionable and is a bit hard to get through the 6-pack. I will admit I was very excited to try this based on all the ads for it and all the varieties of hops described but I just to taste them."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A decent amount of hop bitterness, but I'm not a big fan of the fruit flavours that are going on. They are good, just not my favourite type of fruit flavours found in a DIPA. A beer worth trying though, especially for the price."
"12oz bottle, golden colored ale, slight haze, topped with a frothy, just off-white head, good retention & sticky lacing is left at the top of the glass. Aromas are fresh with lemon & grapefruity citrus, grass, biscuity malt. Lemon rind & pith dominate the palate with grapefruity bitterness present, grassy, not much for malt, but it's biscuity if anything, pungent and astringent on the finish. Definitely off balance with the bitterness here. Oily hop resins coat the palate, medium body, moderate carbonation. Not at all bad; it is decent with a nice, unique lemon kick, but needs more of a malt presence for balance. A bit of a disappointment."
""
""
"the nose on this rampant imperial ipa brings a huge amount of hops with it. and the taste is full and bold. its like the shot a cannon full of hops right at your head. i like this beer a good bit. its a mouthful. there is also a good bit of alcohol in this beer, but it doesnt impair the flavor at all. the hops do all the talking in this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. This is not a slap you in the face bitter IPA. Way more floral than most. No hint of malt. Different, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Great beer! Definitely worth checking out."
"I dig it !!!!"
"Drinkability: It smells great, but the flavor is all about the bitterness — which is solid. Personally, I would rather have a little more flavor."
""
""
"O: This beer was definitely a grower and not a shower. Messy in the beginning, this beer warmed and opened up into a fairly decent IPA. However, the alcohol sweetness and overall lack of hop flavor really held this one back. Could be the bomber, but mine seemed relatively fresh."
"I was pretty impressed with this one, I'm not going to lie. I've deliberately avoided NB beers over time for whatever reason but solid offerings such as Rampant make me want to revist some of their latest trends involving experimentation. This is a perfectly widespread DIPA that just might do enough to get people into the style with its comfort factor and accessibility. It's not the most explosive I've had, but it's undeniably flavorful."
""
"Overall, a nice effort with a few flaws. Looks pretty, with great mouthfeel, but the flavors and aromas are a step below the better DIPA. Still, a tasty DIPA with a good price point. Worth trying,"
""
"Overall a good beer, especially at the price point. Big hop and malt flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"."
"Overall felt similar to Hop Czar, but if I could choose, I'd get Hop Tsar every time if I wanted hoppiness in my beer. I can't get over the fact that New Belgium always has a funny under taste in its beers"
"This is really good, across the board. A perfect example of what a top brewery can do with a popular style, when they set their minds to it. The main thing that separates it from my absolute favorites is the relative weakness of the smell, but that's a minor criticism."
""
""
"O: Overall the alcohol is very well hidden in this beer but it is a little too aggressively bitter for my personal preference - I enjoy a DIPA quite a bit but I like a little more intense hop flavors without quite as much bitterness. Easier to drink than I expected based on the marketing of the beer and one I would enjoy another time."
""
""
""
"I have had two reasonably priced DIPAs in the last two days. Good but no Maharajas or Double Jack s here."
"O: Overall this was a good brew, I thoroughly enjoyed it, very well balanced."
""
"O: At only $7.99 a six pack it looks like I have a new regular beer. For my taste this is a very good D.I.P.A It's loaded with hop resins and a unique, peppery taste. It's dangerously drinkable for an 8.5% beer. I put this up with some of the best D.I.P.As, that I've tried."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Rampant is a big full bodied IPA with smooth carbonation. The beer poured a darker amber with thick froathy head. The nose carried waiths of fresh piney citrus hops with hints of caramel malt. The taste started bitter then was quickly balanced by a sweeter malt. Alcohol was present thoughout the draw and there were hints of pine and citrus. Overall this is a non-sessionable beer but very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Although not as complex and powerful as some DIPA's, this is a very refreshing offering from New Belgium. This would be a great summer beer. Maybe they'll can it so I can drink some by the pool..."
""
"O - Decent DIPA - but not the smack you in the mouth hop presence I want in this class. Worth a shot - unique in its make up."
""
"Overall this is sort of out there for a dipa. I'd be good during a hot day in the summer, but aside from the aroma nothing really stood out for me. Sometimes I really wonder where new belgium would be if they didn't have Lips of Faith"
""
"This was an OK beer, but I was expecting something a bit better. It started that way, but the onion, radish and garlic trifecta may have swayed my opinion a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"22 oz bomber pours a golden amber with good head and lacing. Aroma is lemon, resin, pine, apricot, caramel and alcohol. Taste is peppery bitter, but I'd like to see more citrus character. Very sweet. Seems a bit thin for the style. A bit sticky, drying on the finish with oversweet aftertaste. Overall not bad and certainly well priced, but you would expect more from a major release from a brewery as large New Belgium."
""
"O: Overal this is a solid IIPA. On the low end of the gravity spectrum, but big hoppy nose and body and restrained but firm bitterness."
""
"New Belgium Rampant Imperial IPA ---3.5/5"
""
""
"Overall: I left work early on Friday to head home and enjoy some music, fun, and beer. Two oughta three ain't bad, I guess."
""
""
""
"Overall- solid IIPA. New Belgium delivers again with one for the summer evenings"
"BTW, the 8.5% was a pleasant surprise."
""
"O - I enjoyed this brew. It has its own unique flavor, like a spicy, bitter tea with honey."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great looking brew with a beautiful sticky head that will not quit. Hops are the only focus of this beer, little balance to it. On a positive note it has a unique hop profile and shows off many good qualities. Pine and citrus aroma yet different than typical DIPAs. Taste was bitter all over with a great dryness. Fun take on a style that sometimes is pigeon holed."
"O - a very strong IPA with distinct hop bitterness. Similar to the Ranger in terms of hop prominence but of a different type. Altogether a reasonably difficult drink, but satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Fairly light bodied with low to medium carbonation."
""
""
""
"Medium bodied with averge carbonation. Finishes very dry and harshly bitter. I don't understand how they can fail to hide 8.50 % abv alcohol, when other breweries hide the alcohol on beers with a higher abv. I don't think I got a bad bottle, I just think this beer sucks."
""
"Really just kind of an odd DIPA, the fruit loops thing kills it for me."
""
"A very nice mouthfeel here and despite my misgivings about the melon, it's easy enough to drink though I doubt I'll revisit. Give it a shot and see what you think."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I feel this beer deserves a little more credit that its being given, New Belgium did a fine job. They used a very innovative hop bill, utilizing Mosaic (a new variety) and Calypso (a less known variety) and created a beer that has a very unique flavor profile. It is not the hop bomb that many people want from this style, but it does serve a role in introducing one to the style. I could see a fat tire drinker deciding to pick up a bottle of this, and not being to off put by the change to try it again, ultimately leading to another craft beer fan. Good job New belgium."
"Orange-amber body that's crystal clear. Pours with a two finger head that retains. Good nose on this stuff - the spicy, weedy and slightly oniony notes from calypso work well with mosaic's brighter tropical fruit aromatics. There's a bit of sweetness to the aroma, but little malt character, and that follows through to the palate. While it isn't overtly malty, it does have some sweetness to it, which highlights the fruity aspects of the hop bill. Mosaic brings a great pineapple flavor that's rounded out by the earthier, spicier notes from calypso. There's a slight grassiness mid-palate, and a touch of onion. This is fairly light-bodied and easy drinking for a 8.5%er, with well hidden alcohol. A surprisingly good offering from NB, especially coming in six packs for a very reasonable price."
"Overall it's just not what I want in a DIPA, but it's a good beer but not in the upper echelons of the greats by any close measure."
""
""
""
"Not a great DIPA, but would buy this if options were limited. Not a bad price on this, but the hops don't really flow that well to me. Drinks as bit slow for me"
"Overall, this is a swing and a miss. Very little malt makes it just seem like tea and not beer. This reminds me that to make a good IPA, you do need to pay attention to your malt character, and can't just throw all the hops you want into the brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - overall, easy drinking. ABV is evident in the sweetness, but that's it. very fruity in an interesting way."
"Overall, I don't care for this at all. It's a bunch of watery onioney / garlicky hops (summit?). Like a very poor man's Gubna. From reading other reviews, I wondered if I got a bad one, since all I get is onion and no fruity piney hops. But the 6 pack tasted the same - I dumped one of them. It tasted similar on draft too, just more subdued and watery."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an outstanding beer! Furthermore, it is affordable!"
""
""
""

"Malt is quite evident but not showing off. Somewhat sweet, actually more sweet than some DIPAs. Another interesting variation in the hop wars. From the 22 oz bottle. Medium amber in the tall glass with a persistent white foam."

"Overall: I had high hopes for a low priced DIPA from a respected brewer but this is just weird stuff. I'll get through the 6 pack but I'm disappointed."
"Overall it's a value type DIPA, servicable and while it's no Alpine Super IPA collab or even LoF fresh hop ipa I'm glad to see that NB finally has a regular DIPA in their lineup."
"Tasted like it smelled...hay, or rodent bedding..wet wood shavings with bread yeast...very little hop flavor...like they swept up the store room and hopped with the results, or used a hop schedule meant for a totally different type of beer altogether Terrible beer! I dumped 3/4 of every one i opened...could have gotten a rouge sixer, but don't plan giving it a second chance! I have NO idea how this can be over 80 on here....SERIOUSLY NASTY BEER! Just my opinion..."

"Taste is sharp and bitter up front, but with a hearty malt profile to balance, and with that comes some sweet honey tones, almost. Rampant is a balanced, textured, and heavy IPA -- not among my favorites, but certainly a force to be reckoned with."
"12 ounce bottle, best before 21JUL13 stamped on label. Served in a snifter, the beer pours a mostly clear golden/orange color with about a half inch white head. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells mostly like grassy and spicy hops, along with some light tropical fruit. The taste is balanced between citrusy (orange, tropical fruit), grassy, and spicy hops, and some peaches and sweet malt. Nice bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with a good amount of carbonation. I think it's a good brew, I liked it."
""
""
"Pours a clear light golden with decent foam. The aroma is bright, floral and citrusy, with lots of orange blossoms. The flavor is very hop forward, with a light mix of pine and orange zest followed by a touch of grassy spice on the end. Lightly bodied, easy drinking, and oh so affordable. I can see this being a dependable budget selection, and widely available."

"I had a hard time locating a good brew for this evening and i realized i have never picked up this beer. I am very suspect of this brewery seeing that i feel they are very over rated. I love Imperial beers and especially ipa's. I cracked open the bottle and it had a very nice resiny smell to it and i found myself not so Leary of this beer. It has a very piney,earthy no so tropical fruit smell to it which is fine but i do prefer the fruity IPA's myself. The taste was good but not great, it reminded me of a tame Six Point Resin with its very piney, grassy bitter notes..The mouth feel was pretty good, it seemed to coat my mouth gently and it went down very smooth. Overall this was a pretty decent beer by New Belgium and i would probably drink this again if i were in a bind and could find none of my favorites or beers on my to drink list."

"I was not a big fan of this beer at all. Calls itself and IPA and has 85 IBUs but the hop finish is not very pleasant. You can tell it's a New Belgium beer (tastes like an off-shoot of Fat Tire). It's 8.5% ABV is not hidden/blended well at all. It finishes really rough on the alcohol somehow even at only 8.5%. I just did not enjoy this beer very much."

"O- I love this beer! It's an approachable double IPA. to me, it's a european pilsner all jacked up and i'm really impressed. not what you would expect in a DIPA, and I like that. New Belgium scores with this one by me."
"D - A solid, well-made Double IPA. It's a bit maltier than I tend to prefer, but there are no major problems with it and I do like the hop bouquet. Surprised by the numerous reviews that mention onion, as I didn't notice that flavor at all. Might pick up a 4/6-pack of this actually if it's priced right."

"One of the first beers poured Wednesday night, pre party bottle share for March Madness 2013. Long before David Hurley at the El Dorado turned into a disingenuous, short sighted, cheaper looking version of Joe Buck trying to keep us from doing our already green lighted bottle share. Don't ever trust the El Dorado, they are disingenous. But drink this beer."

"Overall- Not quite sure what they were shooting for with this one, but I ended up giving away the last 2/3 of the six pack. Waited a few days to crack the second bottle (this one) after being underwhelmed by the first. Just because it's bitter and boozy doesn't mean it's a worthwhile DIPA."
"Poured this from a 12 oz bottle. I was surprised that it looked a bit cloudy and light yellow (straw) color. The nose was nice with big hops. The mouthfeel was a little thin, but the carbonation was nice- even though it wasn't obvious upon the poor. The taste was complex. The first sip had cocoa on the front end finished with citrus and pine, but subsequent tastes had a very floral almost rosy taste. Would I have it again? Yep. It wouldn't be the first DIPA I would reach for, but I liked it."

"Very interesting new dipa from New Belgium. I like it quite a bit. It stands out from the pack, is generously hopped and not too high on ABV. I'm sure I'll have it again. Great addition to the New Belgium lineup!"

"Overall: A really good new Imperial IPA from New Belgium. Great mix of hop flavors."
"O- If this is New Belgium's answer to hopslam I think they outdid the veteran in terms of IIPAs. This is the first that can compete with Surly Abrasive, emphasis on compete. I know the purpose of review is not to compare or take favourites between two ales but I would love to do a side by side tasting. This is truly a treat to drink. Cheers."
"Strange, but tasty hop flavor. Normal amount of bubbles and hoppy bitterness for an imperial IPA. Mostly everything I want from an imperial IPA, but the different hops used make for a different taste. Can't taste much alcohol, though it's at 8.5%. Hints of tarragon in the hop profile. Overall a nice beer I probably won't need to get more of after this 6, but I'm very happy to have picked up."
"I like it... It is really drinkable... Hoppy, but not club over the head hoppy... I have to admit I do lean towards the IPA's so I my be biased. Tonight, I picked up six because they were next to the Rangers... Got them home popped one open and they were good... Go get six and try them..."

"Poured a cloudy gold that was seethru at times with very little head which could've been the bartender, not the beer. Some light, airy hops that aren't too strong, mostly citric notes and not what I think of DIPA aromas, along with minimal breadiness and sweet malts. For a DIPA, at least the beer I had, this was a slightly watered down version as the hops are more neutral than aggressive and there isn't much to say of the malts, although the hops do seem to give off something like sweet or tropical fruit notes. Easy to drink and has a vanilla but not disgusting finish; I'd take this over a macro beer anyday."
"I thought this double IPA did a great job of displaying bitterness, as well as a refreshing citrus taste. The 8.5% ABV was well-hidden surprisingly. It is similar to Ranger, but sets itself apart by using a different combination of hops, including Calypso hops. This double IPA is definitely worth trying."

"22 ounce bottle into signature globe glass, best before 7/7/2013. Pours crystal clear golden amber color with a nice 2-3 finger dense and fluffy white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, peach, pine, lemon zest, pineapple, light honey, pine resin, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of hop notes with a fairly moderate malt backbone; very unique aromas as well. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, peach, pine, lemon zest, orange rind, pineapple, floral, light honey, pine resin, and floral earthiness. Nice amount of citrus pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus zest, peach, pine, lemon, pineapple, floral, light honey, and pine resin on the finish for a while. Damn nice balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a light-moderate malt backbone; with some light cloying pine bitterness on the finish, but not really that bad. Medium carbonation and body; with a very sticky, crisp, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent DIPA. Very nice and unique hop complexity with moderate malt balance; and very smooth and crisp to drink. The Mosaic and Calypso hops were definitely different, but it worked out very well. No complaints at all, really enjoyed this one."

"O: good, be prepared for alcohol complexity similar to a barley wine"

"Give it a shot if you feel so compelled, but don't expect anything close to a """typical""" imperial/double IPAs. New Belgium really butchered the style with this beer, in my opinion."
""
"i totally love this beer. i almost hate new belgium. seriously, has one brewery ever had so many beers taste so closely alike? fat tire, ranger, dig and snow day all have that weird extra toasted flavor that i used to love till i realized it showed up in everything they brew. now it just makes me nauseous..well, most of the time, because they finally brewed a balanced beer, one hopped well enough to handle that surplus of toasted malt or whatever that taste is, like they spilled too much in and said """screw it, bottle it and sell it. Rampant is rather sweet and a little of this flavor can go a long way. the appearance is a vibrant golden, slight copper hue that is almost perfectly clear with a decent head and really good lacing, which i wouldn't expect with how clear the beer is. the aroma is intense its... (reloading)... oops, i accidentally opened a fat tire that someone left over...i'll just give that to the dog, ok, rampant, yes, the aroma is a loud balance of citrusy and piney off the charts. Taste is, like i said, sweet. Maybe a bit grassy but not too dry. All in all this is something very different in the realm of IPAs over all. awesome beer. bit of a break from the norm. hell, it may even cause me to become more optimistic about trying future new belgium releases."
"O: Strange brew, indeed. Just before cracking this beer open, I brewed a pale ale hopped with Nelson Sauvin, and this had the taste and aroma of the raw wort – raw hops in the nose, especially. It kind of hit a nerve there, but other than that, it was an interesting (albeit sweet) DIPA."
""
"Medium texture in the mouthfeel and no notice of the alcohol. Solid overall for a DIPA, but I probably prefer Ranger a bit more."
""
"finally, something new and impressive coming from new Belgium! too many lackluster and overpriced releases has me a little down on these guys, but this one is a gem. pours a really pale hazy yellow color, lighter than almost any big ipa ive seen, with a thick foamy bubbly white head with okay retention. the nose is very floral, perfect for the blooming spring time, hoppy but not terribly bitter, and really light on the malt bill. the flavor is also very light in terms of grains, and the hops are intense and interesting, not just a bitter bomb. lots of floral pollen grassy hop character, this somehow reminds me of easter. the yeast is also a contributor, with complimentary light sugar cookie complexion. really clean finish with a burst of freshness. I liked everything about this beer, even the not so subtle alcohol content, it just works in the context of this light and flavorful brew. also, its priced like a beer not a bottle of rare French wine, which is something new Belgium really needs to get back to if they are going to frequent my fridge with any kind of regularity. bravo for this."
""
"Overall a nice dIPA that hides the abv well and is quite drinkable."
"Overall - A very unique, and very welcome take on the DIPA style. Lots of stonefruit sweetness, but the spice bite and there's just enough bitterness on the back end to keep this thing from becoming cloying. Well done, New Belgium."

"Mouthfeel is light and fluffy, very nice. Overall, this is a pretty good beer. When it's cheap, I won't hesitate to buy it again."

"This is a nicely hopped DIPA, but it lacks any significant character. The hops are deep, pleasant, and offer a wide range of flavors. The malt is faint and hardly noticeable at times. The malt definitely doesn't offer the kind of backbone needed to support the intense hop character. Though this is hop forward and pretty unbalanced, it is easily drinkable with a well hidden ABV. For any hop fan this is worth a try."
""
"The more I drank, the more I wanted to stop, but I wanted to give it a fair chance. Overall, a miss by NB. If this is strictly a spring-release, I hope next year's batch will be better. A tad bit fruitier and less funky. Give it a shot, though. I could be wrong..."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear light orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to a thick cap on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, slight fruit, herbal hops, and some onion and garlic aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and vegetal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with some hop aromas and flavors that are fairly heavy on vegetal onion and garlic qualities."
""

"Poured on tap at Life of Riley in PDX. I am hit or miss usually with New Belgium, but this was a good beer. Nice amber color, with 1 finger head. Found the smell to be a grassy pine scent...the taste was the same. Not overly hoppy, but a decent balance with the rest. Good carbonated beer, that seemed very fresh. Enjoyed thisa lot"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber with a finely-bubbled white head. The color is actually really nice. Love the gold printing on the six pack too, really just fine-looking. The nose is spicy, zesty, and herbal; super pine and citrus, with a little tropical fruit nudge of mango and tangerine, certainly some alcohol there. Flavor has a nice citrus bite from the hops and some bitterness on the back end. This is more hop-forward than balanced, and I usually like more balance, but I'm liking the pine-citrus dominance here. Mouthfeel is well structured and tight, and the alcohol (which is not pussyfooting around at 8.5%) is fairly negligible, perhaps taking a back seat to the hops. Carbonation is on the lighter side of medium, and what else can I say? I like it. Try it, it's good."
""
"Based on other reviews I wonder if I had a bad bottle or an old bottle. But the best by date is in July and it just hit here. Not sure what to think. But my review stands."
""
"O - This is a pretty tasty Imperial IPA. And affordable, too."
""
"After 5 minutes or more the strong aromas remain, and the flavors remain but a touch less alcohol, more earthy hops, slight tropical melon rind. Overall tasty and bold, significant bitterness but also creamy malts. Flavorful but not my favorite Colorado double IPA, mostly because of the cream of tartar/chalk bitterness. Still, tasty and I'll look forward to having it on tap."

"D: really impressed with the nose, found the body a little bit bitter dominant where it would be stellar if they backed off a bit with the bitterness."
"Disclaimer: I checked the expiration date just to make sure that wasn't a factor and it is not. I did however purchase the beer cold, store it at room temperature, then refrigerated again before drinking. Although, I have done this multiple times in the past with no adverse effects. I am by no means a beer snob, and I have no problem drinking budweiser, bud light, etc. and was very surprised by how bad this actually tasted. In fact, this is only the second beer after anchor christmas ale that I have said to myself, """Wow, this is a terrible beer.""""
""
"A very poor example of an Imperial IPA; not very bitter, not very hoppy and a weird perfume smell and taste."

"I really like this one. To me a true Imperial. Great balance of alcohol and taste. Excellent mouth feel. First sip hit me with big butterscotch and soon after perfect hop bitterness and flavor to balance. Color is butterscotch too. The alcohol fits perfect and afraid I will drink to much and often. Great that it comes in a six pack and affordable given the style. Hope it is on the shelf a long time. You can tell they worked hard to get this one right but then again New Belgium does that with all their beer. Thank you New Belgium."

"Pours pale golden yellow with a hint of orange like the rind of an almost ripe tangerine. Fluffy head that dissipates quickly and didn't leave a whole lot of lacing overall. Nose was full of citrus and pure hops. Smelled almost purely of lemon or grapefruit oil. The taste was pretty cloying and the mouthfeel was very, very oily. It tasted full of fruit like biting into a ripe pineapple. It was just puckeringly sweet with a bitter finish. I didn't get to pay much attention to the malt in this one, but I think I was just trying to figure this one out. I didn't necessarily dislike the beer, but it was a little...off. I would give it another shot though."

" A nice IPA overall and dangerously drinkable for the abv. This one works for me and I liked the hops blend . For about $2.00 for a single, value is there. Don't know how you get $7.99 for 6 as some reviewers found; maybe out of date ?"
"Poured into an impy nonic a clear light golden with a sticky one finger white head that held for quite awhile.Aromas are more herbal and grassy with a little floral note,not a big sharp citric/resiny bomb,a a lightly toasted biscuit malt bas eunderneath the hops,not much alcohol presence.Flavors are grassy and herbal with a hint of onion,again not a big in your face resiny attack,light caramel biscuit and just a hint of sweet alcohol.Not bad but it's more a toned down DIPA in my opinion,not bad."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Wow! I was not expecting this high of quality of an IPA from New Belgium, especially when it is available year round at $7.99 a six pack. It is insanely refreshing and quaff-able. A bit too easy drinking for it's ABV. I definitely recommend drinking this cold and not allowing the malts to poke through too much, because they get a bit cloying and really just convolute the flavor profile."
"D - I like the departure from the typical citric/fruity hops used in many IPA's, but it suffers from simplicity and I'd guess that this beer wouldn't be any good if it wasn't fresh. I'll have no trouble finishing it, but I don't know that I'd get it again."
""
""
"This beer lacks balance, as their is no backbone to the malt bill to match the hop profile. I'd suggest passing this one up for another DIPA alternative."
"The body was decent, although thinner than I like in the style, and had a finish that was surprisingly dry given the fruity sweetness. Drinkability was pretty good, I could see having a couple of these. Overall, a pleasant enough beer, one I wouldn't go out of my way for, but one I'll have again while it's on tap. Worth a shot."

"O. Very unique, dangerously quaffable and refreshing. Well worth a try."
""

"O- impressive double. Where most go fruity, they go raw. Earth is the key message in this brew, being dank and packed full of flavor. Many would find this offensive, hop heads would find it heavenly. A grade A beer, but a sipper. Enjoy!"
""
""
"Overall this is worth a sampling for IPA fans who want something big in ABV and hop profile. I've had much better and probably won't be interested in purchasing again for home consumption. If on tap, I'd order it again if other options were limited."
"Overall: A unique DIPA with an interesting combination of the bitter and sweet. The biggest detriment for me is the distinctive New Belgium sweet biscuit taste. Ultimately though, this is a great value at less than $10 / six pack."
""
"On the one hand, I appreciate that this beer goes down so easily for an imperial IPA. On the other, why even make it 8.5% if it’s going to be this smooth? Either way, I’d be happy to have a few more of these, and if the price is correct at $7.49/sixer, that’s a bargain."
""
"Overall I would recommend this to fans of New Belgium and only to fans of New Belgium. They serve their role as a counterpoint to the Uber and maintain a unique vision. Very similar to past offerings from this brewery. I was hoping to see them try something different, but why change what obviou$ly work$ $o well."
""
"I really don't take this serious enough to actually consider the appearance, smell, or mouthfeel, so if these are important to you this review probably won't be of meaningful interest. However, if you are a fan of the taste of IPAs and want something that tastes great then read on. I am new at this so please bear with me. I am a big fan of O'Dells IPA, great stuff...am I right or am I right. And I am a huge fan of Pliny the Elder, which I recently had for the first time (because I haven't experienced Pliny the Younger or Heady Topper) it is my personal opinion that Pliny the Elder is the standard to which all IPAs should be judged. Keeping that in mind I was very pleasantly surprised with Rampant. I am from Fort Collins and in this town you are either a NB fan or and O'Dells fan (no disrespect for the newer smaller breweries/ brewpubs). I have always been an O'Dells fan. However, with NB release of Rampant I have gained a new appreciation for NB. This is not like Ranger at all. The subtle citrus and fruit flavor mixed with the malts make this an amazing IIPA. It is very affordable, well at least in FC, and the ABV is 8.5%. The hops are not to overbearing and I feel that anybody that appreciates a good beer will enjoy this. I would recommend this to almost anyone who enjoys craft beer. This is not a beer for Joe the Plumber, but then again Joe the Plumber is probably not reading this and is content with his case of Budweiser. I digress, go out and give this a try...it is a great beer."
"Final Thoughts: If this is a seasonal then I'll be on board for each years release. If not, then I'll probably pick up a sixer with each fresh shipment. Luckily New Belgium puts an expiration date on all their bottles as freshness is probably key for enjoyment of this West Coast IPA. Melon hop flavor is one of the most delicious in my opinion and I find myself both happy and surprised the Rampant Imperial IPA nails it. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
"Bright orange-yellow, good head, lots of sticky lacing. Aroma is grass, alcohol,melon, hops. Flavor is honeydew melons, melon rind, very fruity hops. Very easy to drink with only a slight hint of the alcohol on the finish. Good stuff and I'm glad I have five more of these."
""
""
""
""

"Served on tap at the brewery. Appears a light golden color with thin white head and heavy lacing. The nose features dank hops with notes of pine, weed, lemon, and grass. The taste is has a heavy grapefruit hop bitterness with lemon in the background. Hops pretty much dominate this, very faint caramel in the background. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation. Overall, this is a great value for a dipa, definitely worth a try!"
""
"This medium-bodied beer comes across as a little thin for the style and has a bit of hot alcohol warmth coupled with a very biting hop bitterness that is accentuated by high carbonation. Hop flavor comes across as a bit soapy but the head retention is great and the lace in my glass in beautiful. At $10.99 a six-pack, this beer will get you drunk and is a good deal for an imperial IPA. It doesn’t touch Hopslam, but really, what beer can?"
""
""
"Flavor is exceptionally well-balanced with higher notes of lychee and perfumey aspects of mandarin orange, and rounded out by heartier mangosteen or perhaps another tangy and custardy exotic fruit I have yet to taste. Body is robust, but loaded with lighter fruity and hearty floral flavors rather than anything more dark/malty we might expect from an imperial. Refreshing and distinctive- have two and reflect on everything that's going on."
""
""
""
""
"O: I really like the combination of hops in this beer. It's not much like many other IPAs on the market, although it is a step closer to a fruity, dry west-coast IPA for New Belgium."
""
""
"O: A solid DIPA overall. Nothing spectacular, but reasonably priced and drinkable."
"Pours a slightly hazy golden body with a frumpy white head with good retention. Interesting aromas: lots of floral and pine nut notes, blended with birch and a hint of pineapple. An odd assortment, but very pleasant. These flavors come through on the palate, along with a bit of chalkiness. It finishes with a bit of honey and lingering lemon pith. Very pleasant. I'd happily have another."
"O - I feel like saying New Belgium is a little late to the double IPA party with Rampant is somewhat uncool due to their pioneering nature but, by this point, producing a really captivating and wowing double IPA within a saturated market is hard. I enjoy the bigger malt base which keeps this beer from being too hoppy - at first - but I find it inches towards the cloying side of the spectrum after a few gulps. An attempt is made to blend the tropical fruit """style""" double with some of the earthier pine notes and it works out just fine, but in the end that's how I view this beer; """just fine""". It's a nice, very well brewed, and accessible double IPA from a quality brewery, but I feel the hardcore hop-heads might be dissatisfied with this one."
"Overall an extremely simple DIPA that is lacking across the board. Was really hoping for something more out of this one. I'm hoping the rest of the six pack shows that this was a bad bottle, but I'm really not looking forward to opening another."

"Golden, one to two fingers of light creamy foam, excellent clarity. Smells of grapefruit, peach, resin, pine, honey and a little bit of mint. Tastes sweet, hoppy, peaches still there, resin, some alcohol, a bit of grapefruit pith. The malt is sweet and manages the assertive hop character. medium bodied with tight and pleasant carb and an off-dry finish. Strong work New Belgium, I think this is a little too fresh (*gasp*) and that with a couple more weeks the booze will calm and the hops will meld just a touch more creating an outstanding beer - and at just over a dime an oz will be hard to beat!"

"This one pours a light bodied light dark gold in color with a two finger, bright white soapy head. The nose is bright and fresh. Great fresh hop character, lightly piny with little malt sweetness to get in the way. The flavors are also bright and clean. It is resinous and soapy with great drinkability. It's floral with a touch of pine. It drinks light and incredibly clean (isn't too dry or sticky because of overbearing malt). I love how soapy and sudsy it is. This is a very well balanced DIPA and the 8.5% isn't present at all. It drinks closer to 6%. I really enjoyed this beer and see this one being very successful."
"Pours a slightly hazy copper color. Nice white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of hops and malt. Not especially heavy with citrus or pine notes as with other IPAs. Mouth feel is a little thin. Taste is bitter with some malt. Little or no citrus or pine hop flavor. Bitter aftertaste. This is an imperial IPA but, the alcohol is not particularly noticeable. This IPA tastes a lot like New Belgium Ranger IPA with a very similar hop profile and balance. If you like Ranger IPA, you will like the Rampant IPA too. In my view, it is a good IPA but, nothing really special.."
""
""
"New Belgium Brewing Company has stepped up their game by offer a new, year-round Imperial IPA. Rampant pours a clear, burnished golden color, and it is capped by a solid and sticky white head. Citrus hops dominate the nose. The blast of citrus slowly fades to allow hints of pine resin and rich malt. The beer opens with a bit of a bitter hop bite that is quickly quelled by caramel and toffee malt sweetness. Peachy and lemony flavors pull this remarkably balanced IIPA though the finish. Moderately carbonated, Rampant is extremely well-balanced, complex, and medium in body"
""
"Anyone else see anything overtly ovary-like when they look at hop cones? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear brass topped by over a finger of lightly off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises dank, spicy greens, lightly-funky grapefruit peel, earthy toffee, and a vague, ethereal sense of light leek on occasion in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with a heavy emphasis on the earthy tones of the toffee and the green.s A bit of grass pokes through in patches every now and again as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a pretty solid DIPA, one that's not entirely in your face with hoppy intensity, but more a brooding, seething mentality."
"Poured from 22oz bottle purchased at frugal mcdugals in nashville for $3.99. Pours a golden color with lots of lacing and a bit of lingering head. Crazy aromas of candy, citrus..lots of citrus...wow citrus (pineapple mostly). Taste is different...sweet hop and lots of something i just cant fingerprint...sweet malt maybe but way more complex than that. Lots of back of the mouth flavors here and its super heavy...(its a great brew, but way to intense to end a night)..."

"O – Quite chalky and unique citrus and peach notes. Earthy and organic as well, fresh pine. Very straight-forward and approachable Imperial IPA. Nothing too complex here."
"Overall I'll go back for thirds on this one. Bravo NB!"
