Still, this is very impressive all around.  Very nicely done with flavors, hop balance, and drinkability.  The high alcohol percentage limits the number of this beer one can drink in a sitting, but still this one worth having on hand on a regular basis.","macpapi","Feb 06, 2015"

The taste is great with notes of orange peel and lemon as well as caramel from the malt, and a bit of grapefruit pine from the hops. Complex yet with a style behind it. Absolutely would I recommend.","WhiteHillsStore","Jul 04, 2014"
3.98,-3.4,3.5,3.5,4.25,4.25,4,"O 4.00) Very tasty beer. Usually I prefer more overwhelming grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors but for the lack of those it's still great. I'm not a hop know it all but at a guess I think simcoe or amarilla very piney as stated (I'm going to look this up when I'm done and feel like an idiot if I'm wrong:)). Also as stated the taste and feel linger for a good long while making this something that you can take your time with, and with a full pint can you almost have to.","MrWilliams","Jul 03, 2014"

I think what I like most about this beer is that, unlike so many big, hoppy ales these days, there is both malt and hop character. I could see this one being perfect for someone who really wants an IPA or DIPA, but wants something with some balance and malt heft. Highly recommended for fans of the style.","mrfrancis","Apr 30, 2014"

Nice nose of sweet citrus (mango and orange) with a touch of pine and grapefruit over a rich caramel malt base. Medium bodied with a creamy texture at a normal level of carbonation. The masterful taste profile is complex and well balanced. It begins with the hop flavors of the nose, flows into a mild bitterness and ends with caramel sweetness. The finish is smooth and leaves you with a sweet lingering mild bitterness and a nice alcohol burn at the back of the throat.","tillmac62","Mar 24, 2014"

4.08,-1,4,4,4.25,3.75,4,"Pours a clear, deep copper, bordering on amber. The color doesn't really strike me as a red ale, but the lacing and white, foamy head definitely remind me of an IPA. Aroma is full of dank hops with some citrus and sweet mango. Malt comes through beneath, sweet like a cake baking in the oven. Rye bread, bitter, dank hops, some mild spiciness reminiscent of allspice or cumin, and some sweet citrus all hit at once and mingle, finishing with just the bitter citrus like a grapefruit. Feel is quite dry with a light body. The flavor is more substantial than most IPAs due to the malt bill, but it manages to be light and clean despite this. The extra flavor from the malt is welcome and goes well with the selection of hops used in the brew. Probably my favorite from Oskar Blues.","Philousa","Mar 08, 2014"

The taste is very similar to the aroma at first, however, as it warms up the malt presence takes over. In the taste there is also a big tropical fruit presence that gives the beer a uniquely fresh and light taste for such a big beer. This is definitely a good beer but there are a few drawbacks for me, which are the sticky/syrupy mouthfeel and the sweetness. It isn't too sweet but I feel less malt could balance this beer out a little more to push it to the next level for me. (84/100)","CTbrew32","Mar 03, 2014"

I absolutely thoroughly enjoy it. My critique is to it's status as an Imperial, but perhaps the best part of it is that it would be approachable for a person ready to attempt their first double IPA. It's not too high in alcohol, and for the amount it does have, you would never know. Very enjoyable, definitely worth a try!","ToriBug13","Jan 31, 2014"

Crown shows fairly good retention so while slowly dissipates leaves a wide lacing ring on sides. Caramel & toasted malt aromas rounded by hints of figs, grapefruit & toffees. Gentle toasted caramel malt & ripe fruit flavors at first followed by increasing & overwhelming resinous bitterness. Full body.Soft carbonation. Oily texture. Mild toasted malts & ripe fruit come back in the middle. Citric astringency mixed them & provides a bitter/sweet sensation that lingers into a long finish. Resins on the aftertaste.

Aroma and Taste is of earthy floral hops, caramel malt, yeast and fruity esters, a bit of dark fruit and bread notes. Palate is a medium body, smooth with good carbonation. A nice combination of sweet caramel malt, yeast and fruity balanced with some earthy floral hops on the ending. Not overly bitter and with a good caramel malt background. Overall a very good, tasty and enjoyable brew. Nice","Samp01","Jul 10, 2013"

3.88,-5.8,4.25,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,"Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of a hoppy Red Ale, I got worried when I got to the aroma since it was very IPA like, but when I got to the taste there was enough Red Ale aspects to balance out the hops and it makes this beer truer to style. This beer had decent drinkability, it went down smooth, and the flavors held my attention, but they didn't really keep me coming back for more, so I think one pint can would enough for me, I don't think I would want two in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and how balanced it was when it came to the taste, both of those aspects were pretty good. What I liked the least about this beer was the lower amount of carbonation, I think a little more carbonation would make for a pretty good mouthfeel. I don't know if I would buy this beer again, I for sure wouldn't rule it out if I was in the mood for a hoppy Red Ale, but I don't think I would seek it out. I recommend trying it if your a fan of hoppy Red Ales, it's good for what it is. All in All this was a pretty decent beer, I didn't love it, but I sure didn't hate, but I still think Lagunitas Imperial Red Ale is my favorite of the style. This was a pretty Solid beer from Oskar Blues, but I have yet to find one that I really like, maybe that beer is right around the corner, who knows, but for now I'm still on the fence about this brewery,","StoutHunter","Mar 29, 2013"

Dale’s Pale is a great pale ale with a refreshing hop kick, Mama’s Little Yella is a must-try for anybody that’s a Bud Light only person (since it has a pretty light, but solid flavor), Deviant Dale’s is a huge, burning, whale of an IPA... but G’Knight is just better, despite how good all of those beers are. Super tasty, refreshing, gets the job done... must try.","Alextricity","Mar 26, 2013"

Pours fairly clear reddish copper color with a 2 finger fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, orange zest, floral, pine, orange rind, caramel, bread, light pineapple, and herbal earthiness. Damn nice aromas with nice hop complexity and malt balance. Taste of grapefruit, orange zest, caramel, orange rind, floral, pine, toast, grass, pineapple, and herbal spiciness. Moderate pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus rind, caramel, toast, floral, pineapple, and herbal spiciness on the finish. Fantastic hop complexity and balance; with a great balance of malts that still puts the hops out front; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent imperial red ale! Great hop complexity and malt balance; and very smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 16, 2013"

4.17,1.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Canned on 8/29/12, poured into a perfect pint glass. Thick and foamy off-white head towers about three fingers, decent retention on the head and some cling as it recedes. I'm left with a foamy floating island on the surface. Dark orange and ruby in color, hazy, with hints of amber. Holds light well despite some cloudiness. Bright and sweet citrus (grapefruit and tangerine?) aromas are most noticeable, with malt present as well. Can also pick up that bready smell I sometimes get with these Red's. Flavors are well-balanced without too much bitterness, and the right amount of sweet citrus hops, but could be too sweet for some, perhaps. Moutfeel is smooth, very nice, very light carbonation. Overall I enjoy this beer, and will like to compare it to other Imperial Red's in the future. Would also love to get this fresh. Cheers.","rodlavers","Dec 03, 2012"

The nose comprises toasted toffee, pine needles, and orange rind. Things are kinda muted thanks to the nitro tap, but some elements shine through anyway, stalwarts. The taste brings in more of the same, though now the pine character is more sap-y (not sappy) than needle-y. The body is a light medium, with a steady nitrogenation and a subsequently velvety feel. Overall, a solid hoppy red. Though nothing to get outright excited about, it's definitely something to try if you haven't yet done so.","TMoney2591","Nov 30, 2012"

3.34,-18.9,3.5,4.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a hazy straw orangey yellow with some nice hints of pink and amber. There is a nice finger width head of off-white cream that dissipates rather quickly and leaves a thin ring of lacing to drizzle down the glass. This beer smells big with a resin-pine kick and some nice slight caramel malt backing when poured out of the can. In the can the thing smells like an oozing pinecone, which is awesome! Though the malt subtly is lost with such an overpowering smell, I am really not complaining. The can makes it smell great. The can also makes it taste tart and piney with some medicinal bitters wavering in the back of the mouth that really turn down the flavor for me. The caramel malts are also quite present, giving the pine flavoring a sweet tang with an oh-so-slight touch of bread beneath the weird hops. Taste is pretty much the same in the glass, just with a subdued pine flavoring, much like the smell. I’m not as wild about the taste as I was about the smell. The beer is very smooth and clear as it strikes the tongue, and the smoothness completely kicks the traditional red bite out of the mouth, though a ghost of it remains. The tongue is left tingling and dry with a resinous ichor of saliva coating the tongue. Overall this is an excellent smelling beer that just doesn’t deliver with the taste. Perhaps its five month age gave it the weird medicinal flavor, or maybe it is just too piney but something is not working in the taste. The malt and hop balance reminds me of the Deviant Dale’s India Pale Ale, which is a superb IPA, but this beer just doesn’t stand up to it.","Maxwell","Jul 22, 2012"

I feel like if we could swap a few characteristics back and forth between the two ales, we'd have a great DIPA and a great red ale, but instead we have two somewhat muddled brews.

I tasted some toasted malt, bits of salt water taffy, creamy caramel, and even shades of biscuit dough in there, although no real yeastiness, per se... finish is a long resonance of resin and juicy citrus hand in hand for the entire fade-out.

For a 70 IBU brew, I expected more of an IPA style but the hops are well matched with the malts and the balance and complexity of this is off the chart. ABV is so well hidden that you gotta watch yourself. A slight, very slight warming at the back of the throat is all that hints at 8%+. Full bodied with an almost creamy texture, the effervescence just keeping it from being cloying. This is almost liquid velvet sliding through your mouth.","PorterLambic","Mar 14, 2012"

Smell is very malty with some very nice herbal and peppery hop aromas. There is also a pineapple aroma I am getting as the beer warms up. Taste is of sweet malt balanced with herbal, peppery, and citrus zest hops. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a light carbonation with a medium bodied and slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good DIPA but I am enjoying the aromas more than the flavors.","UCLABrewN84","Mar 12, 2012"

Smell is of alcohol, tropical fruit, and malt sweetness. Taste starts with a bitterness, then I get some thick caramel malt, some bready malt, citrus and tropical bitterness. Mouthfeel is relatively thick, but appropriate for the style. Carbonation isn't assertive but it is present: it helps lift he body of the beer to just the right degree. Overall this is a good beer. It stacks up really well against other imperial/double red/amber ales. Definitely one of the more impressive of this style. The only drawback is the rather high ABV.","gkunkle","Feb 09, 2012"

It is sweeter than it is hoppy, but I think it definitely works. Admittedly, I usually drink this one straight from the can, and I think I actually enjoy it more that way (although that may not be a popular opinion). G'Knight is one I pick up when I see it, although I wish I could find more of it in my area. It is a little bit different than most other DIPA's I have had, and I like that.","NoLeafClover44","Jan 30, 2012"

The nose is pretty sweet, with hops and caramel really out in front of anything else. Some grapefruit and lemon in there, but in the background. Almost too sweet on the nose. This is an interesting Double IPA... It's very sweet, with a lot of caramel and a hint of chocolate in the taste. The hops are there too, but aren't out in front. All in all a unique brew to me. Feel is medium, with a malt/hop battle on the back end. Nothing spectacular in this category. Overall, I feel if the hops were more out in front, and they toned the caramel back just a tad... the scores would go up. Still, this is a good brew. Cheers.","jayhawk73","Dec 02, 2011"

It foamed up about a finger of off white big bubble, air pocket mess than quickly disappeared leaving a small amount of lace on the glass. Smell is biscuity with some cinnamon and ripe fruit. Alcohol present right away in taste. I am getting some rum raisin bread, pretty heavy on the malt. Spicy notes and some more dried fruits. The hops are weak for the style. Piney hops try to cut the dense malts but don't quite make it to the finish. The feel is chewy and sticky with a nice coating of flavor on the tongue. The best part of the beer for me. In the end I am left with an orange, spice, alcohol twang. The lack of head really hurts this beer. The nose could be better and the flavors more pronounced. This one lacks the hops presence that I look for in the style. Overall just OK, probably won't seek it out again.","JohnWaynes44","Nov 17, 2011"

The beer has light initial flavors, but that is remedied very quickly. The blast of flavor starts with hops bittered caramel sweetness, rich and bold throughout the palate. The fruit sweetness from the nose reveals itself as pineapple in the taste spectrum, and there is also some toasty and boozey character, as well. The beer is slick and smooth in mouth, with little to no carbonation allowing the body to stay heavy and consistent throughout. The aftertaste is an overly tangy sweet and sour blend, with the fruit and the slight hops still present and balancing. The finish lingers a bit, and dries your mouth out very slightly. Tasty brew; refrains from overpowering, yet delivers bold flavors and profiles throughout.","GarthDanielson","Aug 06, 2011"
4.12,0,4,4.5,4,4,4,"O: A very enjoyable beer. I think the category of IIPA doesn't exactly fit this beer, though it definitely has some similarities, especially in the smell. It's also plenty hoppy in the flavor, but I'd put it more in the Amber category there. In any case, a tasty beer, sure wish Oskar Blues was available in Iowa, good thing for us that Wisconsin is not that far away. Cheers!","AmericanGothic","Aug 05, 2011"

I've had long standing reservations against can beer, and this one instantly laid them all to rest. This was so smooth, there's no way you could put it on being an 8.7% beer. Beautiful ruby red color with a nice finger and a half thick head at the top of the glass. Great lacing. Bringing the glass to your mouth was a wonderful assault on your sense of smell.

Powerful alcohol and cherry sweetness in the aroma. The cherry comes through first, next, and last in my palate. It really is a very nice flavor. I only gave the taste slightly lower marks because I wanted a few more notes---I like Imperial IPAs with hops, citrus and pine in the same sip, so the dominant cherry in G'Knight is yummy, but I want the (nice tasting) hops or other fruits to step forward a bit more. Excellent lingering sweetness after you swallow, cherry and a little brown sugar, a great beer for sipping slowly as you work on your computer (or procrastinate by writing one of these reviews). A great, big beer to try. I'll seek it out again.","ddean","Jul 05, 2011"

The malts were mostly found in the aftertaste along with the dry hop bitterness. The mouth feel of this beer had a good thickness to it.

4.12,0,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Interesting flavor to this one. Definitely hoppy and bitter, but there's almost an off flavor in there too. It's medicinal or soapy even. But that's only part of the beer. The rest is piney and sticky in it's hoppiness, with almost no hint of the 8.7 percent ABV. The finish is clean and easy, and pretty dry. Booziness comes out a little more in the aftertaste. The off-flavors become less and less noticeble as the beer warms up and your taste buds adjust the beer. In fact the more and more this warms up, the better the flavors meld together into an almost sweet hoppiness that balances out the bitterness nicely. Okay, now I feel better about this one. I wasn't used to any off flavors from Oskar Blues, so its good that I'm enjoying this more now.

Nice and hoppy with a subtler malt balance, some caramel and toffee sweetness. Taste has more citrus, with the balance tilted towards some orange and tangerine. Pine takes a step back here, but still hangs out in the periphery. Finish has all the malt, and isn't too big on the bitterness. Lingering mouthfeel, medium body. Alcohol is invisible.

3.52,-14.6,4,4.5,3,3,3.5,"12oz can purchased at Premier Gourmet in Buffalo, NY. Pours a hazed copper hue with amber edges, a thin ring of bubbly, cream-coloured head, and strands of stringy lacing on the tulip. Smell is pine sap, citrus, floral, grassy, and resinous hops, touch of lemon, raspberries, cedar needles, toast, fruity esters, and liquor. Taste does not live up to the aroma - I get sweet caramel, orange peel, pine, ethanol, spicy and citric hop bitterness, a bit of alcoholic burn on the tongue with a cloyingly malty aftertaste. Way too malt-forward for my liking, seems like the dry-hopping comes through in the nose but doesn't add much to the flavour. Mouthfeel is creamy-medium upfront, juicy middle, bitter spiciness precedes a malted finish with some heat in the throat. Overall, a reasonably well-crafted but unimpressive DIPA that I probably wouldn't buy again. Decent, and nothing more.","cratez","Apr 17, 2011"
4.35,5.6,4.5,4.5,4,5,4.5,"A big off-white, frothy head, almost 2 fingers. Color is chestnut amber with red tones. Nice clarity and the head is persistent. Good creamy lace. Smell is super sprucey with big grapefruit notes. Sweet malts hide in there, but really pulls a knockout in the taste department. Back to the nose, since it has a lot going on here. There's citrus, fruit notes like natural strawberry chews, big hearty herbed bread, caramel malts and moist bread. The malt notes come out as it warms, but the hops still stay strong. Wow, the taste also has tons going on. Sweeter and spicier than the nose yields. Super sweet malts, caramel malts, spicy, zesty hops, slight white pepper, grassy hop finish, some alcohol warming as the alcohol vapor firts with the back of the throat and some lemon bread and tropical fruits. Medium mouthfeel, but super slick and smooth makes this one quaffable Imperial beer. A really good balance of drinkability and big bold flavors.","Schwarzbart","Apr 17, 2011"

The hops are dry and like pine bark. The flavors are of wet pine and caramel sweet malts. I prefer more hop presence. It drinks like it should for the style.

It was the first beer from Oskar Blues I have tried, and it was overall a nice, if not standard, Double IPA.

It's a nice auburn hue, fairly clear, with low carbonation, a half-inch of tan head that deposits decent lacing. Piney, spicy and citric resinous hop oils in the nose; herbal and floral, with some caramel malts and a breath of ethanol. Sweet, fruity, hoppy and bitter on the palate, in that order. Wonderful hops, rich crystal malts, sweet with a smooth bitterness. Lightly warming. It has a nice dry body, with fine-bubbled carbonation and it drinks like a big red ale. The ABV holds the drinkability back a bit, but it is a tasty beer that will age gracefully - my sample is past the best-by date and is doing just fine.","mmmbeer","Oct 17, 2010"

Those flavors could complement each other more harmoniously at times, and this serving tasted like it was at least 8.7% abv.

Caramel and chocolate malts are everywhere, and the viscous sweetness all seems a bit unnecessary.

Aroma is grassy and citrusy (grapefruit and tropical fruit) hops, caramel malt, and a bit of spice. The taste is similar to the aroma, however the bitter hops come out much more in the taste compared to the aroma which I thought was fruitier and sweeter.

Aroma is of sweet citrus-y hops (grapefruit, lemon and maybe a hint of pineapple?) There is active carbonation, but the bubbles seem smaller than usual. 1st sip brings a hoppiness mixed with malt sweetness. The hops tend to win out, but there is a VERY nice balance. There's a strong pine-y finish and the aftertaste coats the tongue & lingers for a long wile. Mouthfeel is smooth & creamy without being heavy, and I could drink these babies all day (or night) long! The wording on the can says this ale is "Big. Red. Sticky.". and that pretty much nails it! Took me a while to find this here in PA, but the search was well worth it!

First thing I noticed was how much more red this beer was then most in the style (Oskar Blues labels this beer as an Imperial Red/Double IPA). Good bit of white sandy colored head that is already leaving trails of lace. The hop smell is thick, pungent, pine forest, good citrus balance. The taste is a cascade of hops, but cut off quickly mid palate by a good caramel malt flavors. However the hops soon take over and coat the entire back of the mouth. It is very sticky, bitter, dry and great. Carbonation is maintained throughout as well as head retention. Even with the stickiness of the hops, it is not syrupy and has a quick overall finish. This is an underrated DIPA, as I think Ten-Fidy gets so much of the spotlight from Oskar Blues. Can't wait for the GUBNA, which should be an amped version of this beer.","wchesak","Mar 03, 2010"

Not the most powerfully penetrating nose yet does not lack for richness in the pink grapefruit, tangerine citrus department, wet pine cones, splash of pepper and salt, then pineapple, nectarine, mango fruit scents which are more clear and direct than juicy, juicy, little to be said about the malt side of the equation. Medium-bodied, comes across as a bit stern and could "give" a little more. More floral, good accompaniment to the grapefruit, orange citrus, the latter drier here. The carbonation has a fine sandpapery grit to it, helps it adhere to your mouth pores. Same can be said for the pine element, the apricot, nectarine, pineapple fruit slightly syrupy as well. If there's any cocoa or chocolate powder, it must be on the bittersweet side and thus can't separate from the rest. Finishes semi-abruptly.","farrago","Jan 03, 2010"

The aroma is very strong. As soon as the can is popped, you can smell it across the room: grassy, floral, spicy, citrusy and fresh. It's velvety smooth and pretty full bodied. The finish is clean and delicate. It's well balanced; not terribly bitter, but very hoppy. There are flavor notes of grass, flowers and citrus peel. The alcohol flavor waxes to provide the finish and a long, hot aftertaste. Wow. It's really bold.","yesyouam","Dec 06, 2009"

Lots more caramel malt in the taste with a finish of ripe pink grapefruit and pineapple rind. The mouthfeel is very smooth, wet and mellow. I didn't like this on tap as much as I did out of the can-maybe a poor pour by the bartender but the experience wasn't the same. Still a good beer but I would like more hops. I realize the malt bill on this example is supposed to be prevalent but that is the case with DFH 90 as well and the malt character is very noticeable but doesn't overpower the hops like this one does. Mild bitterness in the finish, it could use some more hop character. Still think the bartender screwed the pour up, I'll have to give it another shot on tap down the road.","natelocc787","Dec 01, 2009"

One of my favorite hoppy red ales, much prefer this to the "imperial ambers" that have become popular. Medium body with a moderate-high carbonation that works with the bite that the hops deliver.

It didn't look very impressive at all, it's waaaay too sweet, not nearly hoppy enough, and the chocolate malts just seemed really out of place. Now, do you see why freshness dates are so important? If I knew this beer was old, I wouldn't review it. But with no way of telling, I have no clue if that is a factor or not. As is, I have to review the beer sitting in front of me, and the beer sitting in front of me is not very good at all. But, since they make one of the best IRS's (Ten Fidy), I will have to track down a can that I know for a fact is fresh and update the review, just to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Not much in terms of hops (resinous, piny or medicinal) detectable in the nose. Taste consistent with nose, but the lightest kiss of hops bittering is detectable at the finish.

The aroma has a sticky resinous hop bouquet that is accompanied by some brown sugar but still is dominated by the hops. The flavor is sweet candy up front with some sweet hops and brown sugar. The sweet bitterness lingers for sometime after each drink. Gordon is a light to medium bodied beer with light carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic and it leads you to believe that the flavor would have much of the same, which it doesn't. A little let down by that but overall it is still a pretty good drink.","DiabolikDUB","Jun 25, 2009"

Something in the nose and flavor makes me think of brook trout. A little bit of a boozy turn at the finish that appears to come from the big malt body. A somewhat thick beer in the mouth.

First, this may possibly be the most balanced DIPA that I have ever tried and second, is the way in which the ingredients seem to hide the relatively high abv (8.7%). Don't misunderstand me, it will let you know it's there, but you just can't taste it much. It is obviously a high quality, well made beer. The only issue that I have with it is that I personally prefer my DIPA's to be more openly slanted toward the big hops. Some may consider that a flaw, but I will openly admit to being a fan of good ole American hop bomb Imperial IPA's. That being said, there is no denying the high quality here.

It's highly drinkable but for those looking for a lot of bitterness (I had no idea until after drinking it that this is classed as a double IPA), this is not the beer.

I almost didn't give it a 5 due to the price (since I like to factor in price to drinkability) but this works for a treat from time to time.

The one-finger of head recedes quickly, and some streaks of horizontal and vertical desultory lace are left behind. Smell consists of huge hops mixed in with an undercurrent of grapefruit and orange and some very subtle sweet malts toward the end, which makes for a very aromatically satisfying blend of ingredients. The first sip surprisingly has a good grainy base which is strategically attacked by the hops with perfect timing. Sweet beer bread and spicy candy also exist. This is an excellent Double IPA that definitely has it's own unique character that I predict will draw me back time and again.","stephens101","Feb 19, 2009"

Unfortunately a little tin from the can as well. Glass swishing produces a deep yeast smell like walking into a bakery. This has absolutely the perfect balance of malt and hops. There are mild syrupy vanilla cream flavors as well as strong pine and hops. Once again the aftertaste is mildly metallic. The mouthfeel is more than medium bodied and smooth. It has a "Wee heavy" quality to it. Hopheads and Malt heads both can rejoice as this one brings it all together.

But actually the taste is more DIPA, nicely hopped and well-balanced, some phenols provide nice spicy flavors. The after-taste is much less bitter than it could be, this is a good thing in my book.

Dry-hopped nose includes pine and slight citrus peel and alpha-acid tones. Big, full body. Long, intense flavor. Very much like Dale's Pale Ale, w/ lots of intense caramel maltiness, but has more fullness and roasting, w/ slight toffee and tootsite roll flavors. Also less intensely hoppy overall, probably owing to the more intense maltiness and higher gravity. Still has a major, hoppy finish, however. Rather IPA-like tho not sharply bitter as some IPAs are.

The flavor follows the aroma - lots of soft fruit, strong malts, balanced well by a ton of floral and fruity hops. The balance is impeccable. The finish is both very bitter from hops but also very fruity and sweet with malts. The after-taste is very hoppy - but not bitter. The mouthfeel is very full bodied, but nice on the tongue - not syrupy. Overall - amazing!","Rootdog316","Oct 04, 2008"

Not overly hoppish and almost tasting more of a regular IPA compared to an imperial because it is so smooth, almost creamy.

The flavor pretty much followed suit with a large dose of caramel sweetness up front, then a slight shot of hops in the middle followed by a sweet aftertaste that left you wanting more.

The beer is full bodied, no doubt, and you will get a goodly dose of a high ABV, but overall the beer is creamy, thick, mellow, and toned down compared to most others of the style. The beer pours a clear dark amber color with a nice creamy head, retention, and lacing. The aroma is very typically DIPA, lots of estery hop notes, oily hop residuals, lots of sweet malts, caramels, and some very bready smells as well. The aroma is first rate, and not too over the top. The taste is just a creamy delight. It is a thick, syrupy, full bodied beer, but it just stays well inside of the line of being forced to do more than it should.

Not very much citrus in the taste, but I looked at the website and it says it is dry hopped with amarillo, so that probably explains the different hop flavor.

The sweet caramel maltiness comes through, but barely behind the hops. The flavor is a punch of bitterness first leading to resiny fresh hoppy flavor. More lightly piney citrus as well as a bit of metallic, almost grassy hops. The malt is there and although it doesn't shine, it does a great job of balancing the hops.

It's not too often I get to enjoy Oskar Blues beers after having an Old Chubb explode in my checked suitcase on a flight. But I was spending a full week in Boston this time, so I took the opportunity to drink some cans while in town. I had to choose between the Gordon or the Ten Fidy, and was in a hop mood. Pours a clear dark red with a big fluffy head and a hoppy aroma I can smell from over a foot away. A plethora of lacing. The flavour is well balanced with a solid malt base and hops that linger long after the beer is swallowed. Taste is perhaps slightly lighter than expected for the alcohol level, but it's still a nice bold brew. I was planning to say that the beer perhaps didn't warrant its $3/can pricetag, but this last one is making me rethink that.","sstackho","Aug 17, 2008"

Looked how an IPA should (or DIPA), although the head and lacing didn't quite stand up to what I expected of a top-of-the-line DIPA. Flavor and nose are high on strong, piney hops...this one isn't that much stronger than a high ABV IPA (I had a Two Hearted right after and didn't really notice any difference in hoppiness), but it's still quite good, especially if you're looking for piney hops with just a touch of grapefruitiness in there too.

Hops are powerful and oily but not hugely bitter, but finish with lemon rind that sticks. Malt is here in spades, adding honey and a touch of biscuit. Again surprisingly sweet.

There are flavors of caramel, pine, and mild notes of citrus that leaves a nice warm creamy, sticky feeling in the mouth. The big malty, stickiness and awesome flavor make this a sure winner for me.

Basically take an IPA and make it an amber, or take an amber and make it an imperial. The mouthfeel was thicker from both the citrusy/piney oily hops and smooth chewiness of the malts. It was caramelly, sweet and had a decent hop profile. This stuff was actually fairly balanced and smooth although slightly more bitter (in comparison to a standard amber). Medium mouthfeel should be expected. Made me believe a can can hold a decent beer.","joshwlt","Jun 13, 2008"

4.35,5.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I have said before that it seems as if the Imperial IPA style has become a bit overdone. It is a great style, which is a testament to its success and popularity, but somewhere in the process, I feel that some creativity was lost. Lets see how this one fairs. Pours a dark orange, with a large, fluffy, white head. Looks pretty dark for a DIPA, which might be from the addition of chocolate malt. Aroma is big on resinous hops...sticky and pungeant ones that give scents of grapefruit, pine, and tree sap. Taste comes in waves, with a quick blast of hops to begin with, juicy fruit in the middle, tobacco and earth notes to finish things up. Not really a hop bomb in the sense that it doesn't destroy the taste buds completely. I think this is a good thing, in that although the hops shine well enough to beat the malt, everything is perfectly balanced. A nice chewy DIPA, yet still remains very drinkable. The alcohol leaves a great warmth after the first can. This is an exception to the trend of samey Imperial India Pale Ales. Not only reliably fresh, but also one of the best out there IMO. One to seek out, sip and enjoy with friends. Cheers","jamie2dope","Jun 04, 2008"

An inch and a half of creamy fat tan head with nice resillance. Slowly fades to leave a thick cream like painting of lace. Nose is laced with phenolic joy including ginger root, fig, vanilla and raw fresh cut vegies, almost creamy. Enters the mouth and the first thing you get is the crisp sweet bread like maltiness. This does give way to a woodsy hop character that is actually creamy and long. A bit os alchol bite jumps off the hop bitterness on the back of the tongue. As the beer warms you get a raw vegtable feel. All in all the bitter effect is not harsh and very complex. Mouthfeel is reallatively soft with a bit of crisp thickness and the desire to take another sip. Drinkability at 8.7% is extremely high.

A big bold malty base starts it off with great citrisy, piny, and floraly hops build on top for a great IPA flavor. It has a nice crisp mouthfeel with a nice fresh feeling finish.

Just recently sampled Oskar Blues Dales Pale Ale, and was really impressed - this one is certainly a step-up and one of the better American brews I've sampled... the style is very unique and intricate... the best way to describe it is that it falls somewhere between a highly-hopped IPA and a strong Imperial Red / Amber Ale... nice copper / bronze appearance with minimal head that soon receded... smell was literally bursting with citrus, grapefruit, and hops... the bittersweet aroma really came through on this one, and in addition, was greatly manifested in the taste, as well... Flavor combined the finest elements of both an IPA and an Imperial Amber... great citrus, grapefruit, lemon flavor that included strong florals and fresh fruit notes along with a heavy dose of fresh hops... One of the great American beers, for sure... Great thick, and rich mouthfeel led to an equally good level of drinkability that took a slight bump due to the hefty 8.7% ABV... otherwise, the alcohol is hardly noticeable behind a fresh burst of hops, amber, and grapefruit...

Still, the normal Gordon is, like I said, good, no it is really good actually it drinks much smaller then a nearly 9% ABV beer.

Powedery hop aroma with lots of pine resin and sweet grapefruit in the background. Moderate bitterness, a little low for the style, with a fruity caramel sweetness dominating the foreground. Pine and grapefruit provided a nice hoppy counterpoint for a well balanced flavour. Hops lingered into the finish. A bit of the dry side, medium bodied with moderate carbonation composed of fine, creamy bubbles. An easy drinker, especially when compared to other DIPAs, mainly because of the generous malt content providing a solid balance to the hops.","DrJay","Aug 25, 2007"

I like the mix of hops and malt, though I could stand to see some more hops. The Dale's is actually more "hoppy" than this. But this is still good. And very drinkable for the Octane rating. Though I would tend to place this more as a strong ale. The malts give a nice foundation of caramel and toffee. The hops are pungent and oily. Bitterness could stand to use a boost.

Nutty malt and hops in the nose, with a rich, creamy mouthfeel. Taste is very complex, both malty and citrusy hops. I didn't taste the alcohol right off like some have mentioned... and I'm usually one to get it right up front.

Taste seems to be a bit weaker than the smell a bit of a disappointment. Starts off with an bitter pine hop and ends with a slick earthy malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with hardly any carbonation.

In fact, I was lucky to find it in my opinion seeing there were only two four packs and a single left from what I saw. Expensive but well worth it in the end which I'll get to. Pours a nice reddish orange with a good head. It stayed around throughout at about 1/4 inch...from a can. Big. Red. Sticky. All pretty true from what I can see. Sweet caramel and biscuity malts that are already tempting hit the nose along with hops. They aren't quite as up front as you'd expect but I'm still enjoying this. The taste of this is amazing. Very well balanced hops and malts, sweet without that overpowering bitterness from the hops I've come to expect. Instead, the hops simply seemed to peak through at the end, making this quite tasty. Carbonation is close to ideal for the mouthfeel which also happens to be silky smooth. Medium and closer to light bodied brew along with the taste make this the most drinkable of a big bunch that I've tried.

The bitterness is even soft. It's 85 IBU's are barely felt - against the plush malt background it seems more like 35 or 40!!! It's remarkably rich and mellow at the same time... hoppy, but not so hoppy... malty but not sweet. IT'S RIDICULOUSLY GOOD! And stunningly drinkable!!! And I have to say this, but not because of the can thing, although that's great and I'm all for it, and excited that it's catching on, but... this is one hell of a beer for relaxing around the campfire with. It reminds me of my homebrew club camping trips... big, soft, hoppy beers - and you only need one or two because they satisfy. Good times! Oskar Blues keep doing it!!!

Fresh, green hop aroma with lots of pine notes backed by graham crackery sweet malts. On the palate, sharp acidic bite of hops first off, then some malty sweetness. Towards the end it gets considerably hotter with some raw alcohol and hop oils, which skew toward the piney side. There's some great length here -- the finish lasts a long time, and features some fruity citrus notes that aren't present in other parts of the palate. Big, rich mouthfeel with only light carbonation; the overall impression is heavy -- just shy of syrupy.

The smell was a nice blend of citrus hops. Grapefruit and pineapple being the biggest players here with hints of tangerine and pine flavors. Alcohol also made its presence felt, tingling the nose a bit. The taste was nice and sweet, not overally so but well rounded sweetness. Nice citrus flavors again, pineapple and grapefruit. The alcohol again was noticeable, but as it warmed it was masked well by the flavors. Very nice bitter, dry finish, lingered and made you want more of it. The balance between the malt and hop flavors is very nicely done here, and the compliment each other well, and mask the high ABV nicely. Overall this was a very nice DIPA and another quality brew from Oskar Blues.","mikesgroove","Mar 16, 2007"

Wow, what an aroma for a DIPA! Smooth and sweet, but not the piney, citrusy aroma I have grown accustomes to associating with most big IPAs. This one has a very strong caramel presence in the bouquet. A bit musty too. Kinda like the Old Chub in both respects. They couldn't possibly use the same yeast strain for both the Chub and the Gordon could they? It's probably just the malts used. Either way, it creates a fantastic aroma and a pleasant surprise for an IPA of this magnitude. The hops are clearly present in the taste. Mellow and chewy, with a nice smooth hoppy bitterness. Some chocolate and coffee. Definitely some caramel seeping in at the edges. This is a fine IPA, but definitely not my favorite. They do a nice job masking the alcohol here, but it could really come back to haunt you if you're not careful. Overall, a nice beer, but I'd gladly take an Old Chub over this one just about any day.","Atlas1","Mar 06, 2007"

Excellent hoppy aromas. The malt background did not give in to the high IBU's, nor did it create a warming flavor. I would say it is well balanced, but I typically like the hops to be a bit stronger than the malt in this style (e.g. Hercules Double IPA or 90 Minute IPA).

Deep, dark, and thick in appearance; not much air escapes when I crack the can, and I think the thick malts could use a touch more carbonation, which brings down the drinkability. It's sticky, resiny beer, and in a very good way. Mostly cascade hops carry the bitterness, which is full of lively dried fruits. A bit chewy. I'd recommend this one very cold.

The malts a bit sweet which counters nicely with the acidity and almost tea-like herbal qualitites of the hops. Very resiny in the back with a piney finish.

This is one of the most aromatic, floral hoppy beers I have ever smelled. It practically smells like burying your nose in a couple handsful of hops. Amazingly, under all that floral scent there is significant malt to be smelled as well. The taste is not as hoppy as the smell would indicate; must have been a very large and late hop addition. Its a big beer, with rich honey malt flavors and piney, sappy bitterness. The higher alcohol content is detectable in the mouth as a warming feeling during the long bitter finish.

4.25,3.2,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"10-ounce goblet at Pizza Plant on Transit Rd. Hazy dark amber with golden highlights and a densely-packed, small onionskin-colored head. Beneath a powerful sugary spruce sap and citrus rind aroma lies the scent of a vaguely fruity ester and caramel malts. Massively bitter citrus flavor up front (grapefruit, mandarin rind, etc.) quickly gives way to a slightly alcoholic, strawberry-mango-inflected caramel malt sweetness. Pine, grapefruit, and vegetal cannabis flavors all appear in the scorching burps. The mouthfeel is sticky, dry, and juicy all at once. The 9.2% alcohol content is certainly noticeable, but not in any way that inhibits enjoyment of the other flavors. A DIPA that isn't syrupy or cloying is always a keeper in my book. And it really is a damn good DIPA. If one wanted to exemplify a classic of the style, one needn't look much further than Gordon here.","orfeu","Oct 26, 2006"

Where can I get cans of this stuff in the NYC area?","Billolick","Jul 04, 2006"
4.49,9,4,5,4.5,4.5,4,"Bottom line: another very good DIPA to put on my list of go-to beers. And, apparently it's avaialble in cans, so it'll be a great camping beer if I can find a case.","rabsten","Jul 03, 2006"

3.5,-15,4.5,2,4,4.5,3.5,"Notes: I've had it on tap at Oskar Blues and I really liked it. This one isn't quite as good, probably due to the flaws in the brewing/fermentation process. Its sweet, but not cloying, the hop flavor is good, but could be stronger, and would like some more bitterness.","dauss","Jun 23, 2006"

4.23,2.7,4.5,4,4,5,4.5,"This is a seriously rich and delicious DIPA. It has a wonderful body and sweetness without being the least bit syrupy, and is one of the best mouthfeels I have ever experienced in the style. The taste is of strongly citrusy hops, a smililar hop profile to Dale's Pale Ale, but is nicely balanced by the residual sweetness. Very strong effort by Oskar Blues, and I wish we got the cans here in New England.","bignick","Jun 13, 2006"
4.05,-1.7,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"A bit thin for a double IPA. Carbonation is about right though. Alcohol is not present in the least. Very very smooth drinking for such a high alcohol IIPA. Also, incredibly balanced in a category of beer that is dominated by over the top hops.","trep","Jun 10, 2006"
4.5,9.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a solid malt scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a powerful hop aroma that's floral and quite refreshing. The taste is good. It has a nice bitter hop taste that is complimented with a complex malt flavor. It goes down easy and finishes hoppy and slightly warm. This is a big brew with lots of flavor. It's rich and well balanced. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine beer. It's all around good; another wonderful offering from these guys.","WesWes","Jun 08, 2006"

As the malt flavor leaves your pallet it leaves a dry alcohol flavor. There is also a very sweet note to the beer it leaves me wishing it was a little drier. But other then that a very good DIPA.","jorjoria","May 23, 2006"
4.13,0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"After reading some of the reviews of this brew I noticed the bottled versions were all very dark in color...could have been reformulated at some point since canning and kegging. Appears caramel amber hued with a nice sized cream head leaves even bands of lacing with each sip. Aroma contains citrus earthy hops coming off nice and herbally spiced heavy hand sweetness from the caramel malt base wtih a touch of alcohol present in the smell. Flavor seems upfront with the caramelly doughy tone with assertive bitterness tailing to balance quality citrus and earthy hops with a signature yeasty Oskar Blues finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied evenly carbonated quality texture light hop oils not quite resinous. Drinkability is very nice dangerously drinkable beware of the abv effortless and balanced DIPA get some cans off this to pair with your tackle box this summer and you may just fall off the boat.","WVbeergeek","May 18, 2006"

Dry hopped with other notes of green apples and cherries in the nose. This is truly a delightful beer. Its a hop monster and displays all kind of fresh, floral and sprucey hop flavor but its bitterness is subdued. Tons of flavor. Very creamy and full bodied. Canned version just lacked the magic, or maybe I'm just crazy. I just remember the old Gordon being better,","Crosling","Mar 15, 2006"

3.48,-15.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,3,"From the 12 oz. can, I poured this beer into a standard 16 oz. pint glass. The beer came out very highly carbonated with a two to three finger tall head that prevented the emptying of the entire contents in on pour. The underlying body was reddish amber in color, which was a departure from standard issue DIPAs. There was also some yeast in suspended animation in the glass. The aroma was very mild for the style with a sweet toffee-ish nose and some spicy hops. The alcohol was also evident in a mildly fumy manner. Taste was little too sweet for what it was meant to be with the mildly bitter and earthy hops providing only a slight contrast. This beer had a pleasant caramelized and balanced taste, but much closer to a concentrated English Bitter in flavor profile than a bulked up American IPA. Nice toastiness and nutty flavors also reinforced the impression that this was off style by quite a bit. The cloyingly sticky and slick mouthfeel lacked the bright punch I so love in the real Western hop monsters built on pale malt base. Alcohol was also too detectable in the aftertaste. Enjoyable but flawed, and overpriced to boot. A decent beer, but not a good DIPA.","rajendra82","Feb 28, 2006"

3.71,-10,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Drinkability: Not what I was expecting from a DIPA. This is not a big, hoppy DIPA in the Hop Wallop or Clipper City Loose Cannon vein. Has a well pronounced malty sweetness that offsets any hoppiness. Alcohol is well pronounced, leaving a warming face. Glad I was able to get this limited edition offering in a can. If you like a sweeter DIPA than a big hoppy DIPA, then Gordon is for you. Worth a try if you can find it, but not necessarily one I would buy again.","SwillBilly","Feb 10, 2006"

4.15,0.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Yum. I love Dale's so I was thrilled that I could get some of these in Georgia. Aroma was very hoppy, as one would expect, but not as much of a resin aroma as a Ruination or Hercules. Nice frothy, light-brown head, with super lacing. Taste starts off hoppy, then goes malty, before finishing with an average hoppy taste. Carbonation was soft. There was a slight alcohol finish. All in all a good, but not great DIPA. More on the Big Hoopy Monster side of the style.","doubleipa","Jan 24, 2006"

Wow this poured out very dark with a nearly opaque dark brown with red hues and it appeared black at times. The head was a tall beige one that had good retention and left sheets of lace around the glass through the session. The nose was of a bit of fruit with citric and floral hops jumping out at you. The flavor was great with caramel and chocolate standing out more than I would expect from a double ipa and citric hops still holding there own here. A very nice mix of flavors mingling here with an interesting caramel citric bitter finish to end it all. Mouthfeel is medium to full with a nice chewiness to it. This was one of the more interesting beers I have had in a while. The malt profile added greatly to this IPA was still maintaining the hoppiness expected from it. The 9.2% really made not sharp appearances even as this warmed. If not for the huge price of this I would enjoy this one much more frequently.","meathookjones","Sep 24, 2004"

3.36,-18.4,4,3,3.5,4,3,"Sampled from a corked 750ml bottle. When I poured this I had to double check the label to make sure it was an IPA...didn't expect it to be so dark. In the glass, it's a deep amber almost brown with a sticky white head. Rich & very sweet aroma of floral hops and candied passion fruit. Smooth bready malt start with evident warming alcohol and underlying dulled sweetness. Sticky hop resins & notes of pine. Moderately bitter and medium to thick in the mouth. Finishes with sugar coated raisins and spicy hops. A rather odd, but unique blend of flavors make this a brew that's certainly worth trying.","garthwaite","Sep 08, 2004"
4.62,12.1,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Quite tasty actually. There is a medium-bodied fullness, which compliments both the hop and malt contributions.

The beer pours a porter brown to almost black with some ruby high lights, the head mountainous, the texture creamy, and the color a toothsome light brow, the lace is thick and glutinous. Nose is dominated by the hop floral aroma, with an almost cotton candy sweetness, start is ambrosial, rich in malt with the top thick and pleasant to the palate. Finish has a modest acidity, the hops enduring in their spiciness, and with a 9.2 ABV, quite a nice belly warmer, a magnificent beer.","Gusler","Mar 28, 2004"
4.16,1,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Pours very dark for an IPA. This looks more like a scotch ale or even a porter than an IPA. Very dark mahogony, yet still clear. Large cream head on top. Aroma is not incredibly strong, yet is somewhat complex. Apples jump out at first, along with some citrousy hops and a whiff of alcohol. Hard to detect much more. Taste is complex and lengthy.Apples and grapefruit & piney hop resins come out up front and last throughout the sip. A bitterness takes over big time. Behind all this is a decent malt character. Just enough to keep the taste factor up. Some caramel taste show up upon warming, all the while a alcohol bite pokes through. Mouthfeel is excellent and almost chewy, with flavors dancing around the tongue. Drinkablity is decent for a beer this potent. "Better than Dreadnaught"? I think not, yet this is a bit different.","avylover","Feb 22, 2004"

Incredibly balanced, with lots of chewy malt complementing the heavy hops. Smooth, chewy, and delicious. If there was such a thing as an "Oatmeal IPA," this is what it would be. I can't wait to have another.","altctrlsdelete","Feb 08, 2004"

This is a very full bodied brew with plenty of complex hop and malt flavors to ponder. It is balanced nicely, citrus hops and very chewy malt ( caramel,brown sugar, toasty,lightly nutty) the flavors go on and on here. I'm not sure if this is a regular beer of theirs or a special release but worth seeking out while in the mountains. It can easily supply you with enough nutrients for a stay above tree line.","jeffboo","Jun 19, 2003"
