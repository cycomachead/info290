"Poured from tap into 10oz flute. Pleasant and mild aroma consisting mostly of hops and grass (maybe more floral than grassy) but I could pick up whiffs of citrus (orange mostly), and mild, buttery caramel. It pours sparkling golden-orange with nice finger-width, slightly off-white, head consisting of evenly sized small bubbles. This pour had the benefit of a glass which must?ve had etching on the bottom - there was a constant stream of carbonation feeding the head, giving it a presence throughout the drink (the flute has an etching on the bottom), and leaving a nice lacing around the glass by the end. Even in a plastic glass, the head retention is generous, creamy, and fluffy and has a lot of sheet lace. The taste is a balanced medium high, citrus bittersweet. It?s a nice, medium body, a bit sticky with a mild hop flavor lingering. The constant head gives it the benefit of being creamy and frothy throughout, but it doesn?t feel fizzy at all. It’s a medium body, a bit sticky, that’s creamy and thick but also smooth with flavors of bread toast, biscuit, and caramel with some citrus. There?s a reason Dogfish Head gets so much credit for their beers, and this is a shining example of how to make and Imperial IPA without over-doing any aspect of it."
"I had this incredible brew recommended to me by a friend. I can not keep my mouth shut about how much I enjoyed this beer."
"Best IPA I've tasted so far...very easily drinkable not overpowering, not too bitter IMO"

"It's good... I am not impressed. I might be stupid but when I drink it, all I can be reminded of is a Dubel or a Tripel. Literally all I am getting."

"Up there among the top of IPA's. Great beer!"

"Deep orange color.  Not a lot of hop aroma at first.  Very malt forward DIPA.  Well balanced at the end.  Excellent beer."
"(Draft; revisited) at Redcoats in Pleasanton.  Spicy smell and first taste. Maltiness comes through on 2nd taste. Under-hopped for this style. Still a good beer though."
"One of greatest go to craft beers in the world. Always smooth with a great nose, taste and finish."
""
"I've NEVER had any beer this good before!!! For me, everything  about this beer was PERFECT! I had to go with 4.75 on """Smell""" to leave room for discovering an unexpected and yet unknown beer... I've never claimed to have fallen in love with a beer before, but now, I have. Totally infatuated. :-)"
"Bitter taste but has a nice smell"

"Overall- A really good beer but I didn't enjoy it enough to give it world class ratings."
""
""
"Nice copper look to it, the ABV is very evident but not excessive as the very present hops give it a nice balanced flavor. It actually has a smooth feel to it, which is a pleasant surprise. Overall in terms of flavor I am more of a fan of the 60 minute IPA but this is still a masterpiece of a beer from an elite microbrewery. I would love to get my hands on the 120 minute IPA, which is the granddaddy of them all in terms of ABV"
""
""
"A well-known, well respected Imperial IPA who's reputation is well-deserved.  The muscular malt character here does much to offset the strong  hops.  Many die-hard hop-heads may not appreciate this, as  the result lacks the overwhelming blast of hop-bitterness that many other IPAs flaunt.  Those who like a heavier beer and enjoy the malt aspect as well as the hops will find much to love here."

"One of my go to IPA's. Has a relatively pronounced taste of alcohol, but the hops do help in disguising that. On the higher side of ABV at 9%, thus it can pack a pretty nice punch. Not the best IPA I have had, or even among them, but it is a solid choice and readily available."

"My goto DIPA I can get in a sixtel"
"Overrated. Alcohol taste compromises other flavors"
"I won't say the Emperor has no clothes here, but they could use a little tailoring."
""
""
""
"Decent IMO. Sweeter, maltier, and good mouthfeel. But just lacks the dry bitter hoppines that i crave."
""

"Solid 9% ABV IPA.  Tastes good!"

"Didn't like this one at all. Absolutely tastes like An English barley wine. How the fuck is this a 95??"
""
""
""
""
"Had this reasonably fresh and it still reminded me more of a Barleywine or a hoppy Strong Ale like Brown Shugga than a DIPA. Malty and sweet with moderate bitterness. Not nearly as hoppy as I had hoped."
""
""
""
""
"Malty, slightly boozy. Hops well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tastes very catty to me.  As in cat piss.  I suspect use of Simcoe hops mid boil for flavor addition."
"Pours a clear amber color. With carbonated bubbles emerging from the bottom of the glass. Smells of citrus, pine and sweet. It tastes similar to how it smells with mild carbonation. Went down very easy and the notes of citrus combined with sweetness in the taste made it very enjoyable."
""
""
"Great tasting DIPA. This is my favorite brew. It was love at first taste."
""
"Too malty for me, not enough hop balance for an IPA which was very surprising for a beer hopped for 90 minutes."
""
"I'm rating a 90minute that I've aged for two years. Was phenomenal. Difficult to compare to their other bets because this is the first one I aged. The ones straight from the liquor stores cooler was also very good but this beer aged very well."
""
""
"Hadn't had this in a while. Still delicious. The smell does not match the great taste."
""
"Overall, a decent IPA. It didn't prove to be what I've heard. In comparison to a lot of 9% IPA's, this beer is tame and mild. I'd call this a session beer, if anything. Again, not bad, just not what I was hopong for. Maybe too balanced, if that's possible.."
""
""
""
""
""
"Some where between a 60 minute and a 120 really fits the bill. Interesting smokyness I pull from the malts."
""
""
""
""
"Amber pour, thin skein of tan foam. Aroma is light, given the hop load. Smells a little malty in fact. Flavor is similar. Underwhelming hop flavor dominated by malt backbone. Interesting, and tasty, but not a fave in the world of big IPAs."
""
""
""
"This beer was enjoyable, 60 minute was malty, 120 minute tasted like brandy, this was good though."
"Very nice change has a unique taste an very enjoyable"

"My favorite beer - amazing! Thank God for dog fish head"
""
"Bottle of 90 minute ipa drank."
""
""
"Overall Im glad I picked this one up.  On a different spectrum than a lot of the IPAs out there that scream bitterness.  Ive had 60 minute a few times, but this is my first 90.  Will definitely get this one again."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer, in a blind taste test - I was unable to differentiate Lagunitas Brown Shugga' and this beer. Either a testament to how great these beers are, or how unrefined my palate. Regardless, I would put this on my rotation of great American IPA."

"Very drinkable with a nice sweet flavor."
"Wish it had more aromatic characteristics, but taste is quite pleasant, very drinkable."

"One of my new favorite beers."

"90 Minute is my favorite IPA!"

"This beer does everything right.  It's THE benchmark IIPA/IPA in my opinion."

""
""
""
""
"Outstanding, possibly the best IPA I have had to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my absolute favorite IPA's ...super malty, well balanced, and very complex. Can be considered a non-traditional IPA, which I absolutely go back to time and time again!"
""
""
""
"The best way to put this is malty. Very very malty malt that keeps the hop hop hoppy crazy ways under control."

""
"One of the very first IPA's that got me into craft brewing. DFH nailed it."
"Definitely a great goto beer I love it"
"Bottle.  Full disclosure: I am not an IPA fan, generally sticking with stouts, porters and some dark lagers.  But there was a lone bottle in my local grocery store and I thought, why not.  So, with that in mind... I started this around 56F.  It poured an OMG beautiful golden amber, perhaps the prettiest beer I've seen.  Nice whitish head that lasted long enough to appreciate.  Smell was mostly citrus hops.  Maybe some grapefruit, but definitely citrus.  Aroma was the weakest link.  Taste followed, but slightly out performed the aroma.  Feel was medium body and quite creamy.  In fact, there's many a stout that could take a lesson.  I found myself wanting to really like this beer, but ultimately it is not my thing.  My rating is probably unfair because I'm not into IPAs, but if you are, or want to try one, I heartily recommend this beer!"
"not as good as the hype, top 50 in my book no better"
"My favorite IPA, hands down"
""
""
"Tastes too much like caramelized onions to me"
"On tap at DFH Fairfax VA. Coppery with buff head that leaves nice lacing. Pineapple and resin up front with leathery bitterness in the finish. Outstanding!"
"Outstanding. Would be interested to compare with Yeast Wrangler by Holy City, my other favorite Imp. IPA/DIPA."
"O: I can see now why it's rated so highly. It's a simple IPA in that it doesn't have tons of citrus and spice and floral and pine etc, but it has a beautiful look with an awesome mouthfeel and a very traditional IPA taste"
""
""
"I'm not a fan of IPAs and this one is no different.  Smells and tastes like a pine tree to me."
""
""
"balance and constant taste. Not overpowering. Easily drinkable."

"My all time favorite IPA...perfection"

"An excellent beer no doubt, though a little pricey.  Strong, almost overwhelming (to me) lingering hop taste.  I will buy this occasionally.  My daily personal favorite is Duvel."
"My favourite beer. The best. Period."
""
""
"Delicious and happy to enjoy it"
""
""
"Malt and Hop battle in this brew, but the aftermath is no disaster, it is a fruity and robust combination of beautiful ingredients and craftsmanship. This isn't the last time I drink this brew."
""
"If there is a more perfect beer I don't know what it is"
""
""
"This beer used to be available in Alberta but due to popularity supply issues took it away. A benchmark for IPA's. Love it from the smell to the taste, 100% sweet goodness"
""
"Overall: A classic IPA.  Still stands up to the test of time"
"Very nice esp:w/9% kick."
"Overall: i think this brew is very well made and is a delicious imperial IPA, a must try for Dogfish Head fans"
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"My favorite beer, it opitimises craft beer IPA's. Cheers!!!"
""
""
"Overall: In a world plastered with DIPAs and Hopbombs, this carries DFH's flag very well, imo. Very easy to drink, and never disappointing. I could pop several of these and dissapear in a resiny, citrus, euphoric mess. Well done!"
""
"The standard-bearer for what IPAs try to be when they want to progress beyond """pretty good""". It's called malt! Your IPA needs it. This one has it. A very finely crafted brew deserving of its fame."
""
"Well, I used to love it.....and, it's still above average...,, I guess I've moved on. Maybe the malt backbone doesn't impress me anymore, maybe I prefer a more pronounced hoppiness these days. I haven't had the 90 minute in about 10 months, and back then she was the hot babe. Now...,.still good but not as good as I remember. Tastes change, I guess"
""
"Overall, great IPA, nice flavor and after bite is smoothe. Great hops, mix of pine and citrus, nice feel. In my regular rotation."
"Smoothest IPA I have ever had, well done Dogfish!"
""
""
""
"Don't like ipa's, but this is great. Unlike most ipa's, in my opinion, this doesn't taste like carbonated perfume. Very smooth and balanced."
""
"I am an avid drinker of IPAs/DIPAs, and I had great hopes about revisiting this brew.  I was disappointed again.  It does have a unique flavor when compared to other similar beers, but it doesn't work for me.  The hop flavors were offset by a strange white-tasting yeast flavor, and I didn't get the multiphase taste variance I get with brews like the Alchemists, Lawsons, even Sierra Nevada.  Still - pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer. Head is firm with a nice crisp flavor. Nothing bad to say about this beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My favorite IPA, packed with flavor, alcohol and color, appropriately bitter and oh so hoppy!"
""
""
"Lots more going on than most IPA's. But at 9%, can't do more than a couple before I'm done."
""
""
""
"On draft at the local grocery store, first time I've had it on draft. Now I'm spoiled."

"Really juicy double IPA, this stuff is what gods piss would taste like. No but on a serious note the smell is wonderful a bouquet of floral and fruity. A wonderfully balanced beer. At 90 ibus of course it's bitter but it's also a double ipa so you can't really drink this expecting it not to be. The alcohol gives this a warmth as it sits in your belly, really warms me up."
"Flowery hoppy. Liquid silk.   Awesome"
""
""
""
"I can respect it,  but not my cup of tea when it come to IPAs, too pungent. IMO"
"Well, I picked up a couple of bottles to review, and before I knew it the vultures were circling. My wife seized the opportunity while I was finishing my pale ale reviews to help herself to the 90 Minute IPA's chilling in the fridge. I was able to get a 5 oz. sample out of the deal though. LOL. Even in her IPA tulip the beer demonstrated amazing clarity. You can see every detail of your hand holding the glass through the body of the beer. I really like the copper-amber appearance, with its unique cinnamon highlights. The frothy 2 finger head and ample uneven lacing add to the allure. The aroma has a nutty brown ale quality with an abundant rustic hop character. Scents of sweet breads mingle with hints of sour citrus. I'm actually surprised by the super malty flavors of this one. A bold brown sugar sweetness compliments the myriad hop complexities, and threatens to steal the show. Noticeably absent is any real sense of bitterness. Typically with a mega-hopped brew of this stature you can expect a dry, bitter bomb. Not the case at all with this one. Instead you get a lot of nice fruity flavors,  earthy spice, a little mint and very reserved citrus pith. Everything comes together in a rich, hearty body. The perfect carbonation helps create a creamy texture that might just be the best I've ever had in an IPA. This may also be the only DIPA that I've had where the malts truly stack up to the hops, and the resulting balance creates an entirely new understanding of what an IPA can be. Make no mistake, at 90 IBU's this one is not lacking in the hop department in any way. It's just a bit of sleight of hand for the malts to seduce you in to thinking you may have a barleywine in your possession instead. Admittedly, the sweetness can become a little much, but no more so than the bitterness of most other Imperial IPA's. In the world of creative craft beers, this one stands out to me for its originality and pure personality."
""
""
""
"O: with no hop profile, this drank more like a barleywine;"
""
""
""
"Nice IPA, Good when you want more than 2 or 3. Great finish, you can't go wrong with this IPA."
""
""
"O: I must be missing something here. Maybe the beer is missing something. I get a lot of flavors that I don't usually get from IPAs and DIPAs. I am not a big fan of the hop variety used here."
""
""
"My go to IPA.  Beautiful color, great aroma and so damn smooth.  If you've never had it you are doing your taste buds a disservice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really nice and smooth for an imperial IPA, not harsh.  Hoppy but not very bitter (not in a bad way).  Happy I have been choosing good beers to start my review process.  Nice sweet undertone all around. Wish I could find it closer."
""
""
"Enjoyable experience. Not overblown with citrus notes."
""
"Working off old notes.  Will update with more details if/when I have another."

"I used to love this beer, and for long time it was my """go-to""" higher ABV IPA. But, my palate has changed and this beer is now too malty for me. This happened when I started to drink more West Coast IPAs. By no means does this make the beer a bad choice. It's still a great beer and Dogfish remains one of my favorite brewers."
"One of the best beers out therr"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full body and light carbonation Great!"
""
"Surprisingly good IPA and hell of a buzz after just 3 beers."
""
""
"I did not care for the malt make up, nor the apricot smell and taste. I prefer a west coast style hoppy citrusy and bitter imperial. I have not been impressed with dogfish head, which isn't to say they're bad, just not for me."
"Smoother than I expected... Maybe because I had Palate Wrecker last night. Great dark amber color. Nice 1 finger head and great lacing tull glass is empty! Almost sweet initial taste with the hops kicking in midway  and ending with a smooth aftertaste. Creamy mouth feel. One of the better double IPA's I've had"
""
""
""
""
"One of my absolute favorite examples of an IIPA. Simply flawless."
"Wow not always my favorite style but I really liked this one.  The description talks about a solid malt backbone.  For me this really made the beer.  Gave an awesome balance to the strong hop presence and a nice substantial mouthfeel."
""
"Defines the malty IIPA style."
""
""
""
"Sticky, but amazing. You might see things if you have too many"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: True DIPA with pleasant aroma.  Flavor is unique to the style. Hoppy, tad-sweet, very earthy."
""
"Not really impress with this IPA"
""
""
""
""
"Like it alot. My trouble is that i drank it After I had the 120. It is a safe, nice beer."
""
""
"For a typical over-hopped American IPA, this isn't too bad."
""
""
""
"V - Medium."
""
"Overall: Very good IPA! Personally one of my favorites."
"A little different after taste then I'm use to but still a good upa"
""
"O: I haven't had this in years. It was my first taste of IPAs and I could barely drink it. I now find it to be a world-class, dynamic beer. I'm glad I revisited!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Might not have been fresh, will try again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent beer by DFH. Both tastes and smells great one of the better Double IPAs I have had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had this on draft, it was sweet at first and faint alcohol taste at the end."
""
"A great marzen. Except it's not supposed to be."
""
"The best everyday available in Chicago IIPA"
"Near perfection all the way around"
"My """go to""" IPA. I used to drink the 60 Minute IPA but either it or I have changed. This one has a """presence""" the the 60 Minute lacks.  I also enjoy the 120 Minute IPA but the 90 Minute is the sweet spot for me."
"Draft pour at Logan Arcade into snifter. An intense blend of pungent, resiny, oily hops along with an oh-so-sweet malt profile. Big in flavor and big in mouthfeel - there is a stickiness here that clings to your palate."
""
"Bronze in color, light head, light carbonation. tastes great!"
"O - while i found this interesting and enjoyable, i'm sure some people would find it too barley heavy.  it's a good beer, but would not be my first choice if i was looking for a classic DIPA"
"I was not impressed considering the praise this brew has received. Too bitter for my taste and I like IPA's."
""
""
"Nice Balance but not great, seems to leave a bit of a coffee/caramel after taste. Hops are not overbearing.  Overall above average IPA"
""
"Easily my favourite IPA.  Smooth and a 4 pack is all you need to get a good night's sleep.  If you've only ever drank American Lagers, this is like drinking 2-3 in quick succession.  Very malty but oddly enough, not in a bad way."
""
"Decent beer, but don't get all the hype. I've had better IPAs for half the price."
"Tastes like an amber ale, for my money the 60 is better but this is a decent beer, very, very malty"
""
""
""
"overall ive had better imp ipa, but is good"
""
""
"Too foamy upon pour. Pretty sweet imperial ipa with first sip. Took another gulp, my taste buds sang. Taste like there are figs in there. But the finish is just lacking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not real big on IPAs at all, but I do enjoy this beer quite a bit. It's my go-to beer a lot of times when I'm at my local grocery store & they don't have anything else I want."
""
"Not that impressed. A lot of reviews here are high for this one. Guess it just didn't arouse my taste buds. IPA's are my fav, but not this"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Boozy feel and taste upfront accented by hop bitterness on the end. The big malt character is there from the nose, but it isn't met by an aggressive fruity nor piney hop taste that I'm used to with west coast IPAs. Instead the bitterness and alcohol just kind of linger there.... interesting. There is an herbal and tea feel from the hops, though, that lead into the apricot flavors. My thoughts are that this beer is a maybe a percentage and a half too high ABV wise."
""
""
"So, I've given this a perfect score because to this moment I have never had another beer quite as good.  You pay through the nose for this, but its worth every penny."
"Overall not a bad IPA. I have discovered in not an IPA fan"
"Such an amazing beer. Buy a four pack and see for yourself. Tons of hops but very smooth and hard to tell its 9%ABV which can be dangerous."
""
"Top 5 on my list, my #1 !!!"
""
"Too malty to really be a great IPA, but not a bad beer overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Best IPA I have had to date! Much better than the 60 minute in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"This is truly a world class IPA fresh. Take note of the bottling date on the neck of the bottles as this is excessively dry hopped and much better fresh. Like all dry hop IPA's this will begin to lose its hop aroma after 30 days and be quiet noticeably less aromatic after 60 days."
""
""
""
"Have drank a few Dogfish Head 60 minute IPAs and decided to purchase a 4 pack of the 90 minute IPA.  Wow, is all I can say.  What a great tasting beer.  Very difficult to detect any alcohol in this beer.  A very hoppy beer, but very refreshing."
""
""
"Not a fan of malty IPA's and this is a malt bomb with minimal aroma and hop flavor"
"Just a great brew. There is nothing bad to say about this beer. Perfect balance of Grapefruit and citrus taste. Wonderful aromas of sweet pine. If u are not much into IPAs wait till u r ready for this masterpiece. Give your palate time to adjust to the buttery greatness. You will never regret buying it. Salud! Cheers! Enjoy......"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"My advice: I highly recommend this beer if you are already into IPAs. If you are trying IPAs for the first time, go with something more mellow and build up your palate before trying this one so that you can fully enjoy the experience."

"A bit hesitant to try this as I was not impressed with 60 min. But was pleasantly surprised with the 90 min.  Smell was great and the sweeter after taste was nice amd kept making me go back. Will definitely buy agian. One of my tops"
"Hoppy bitter but a really sweet finish which I think come from the malt nperfect east coast IPA but which is why. Like west coast better."
""
""
""
""
"O - Terrific beer! Not your normal IPA but is balanced extremely well and a definite must try"
"Overall: Try this beer! This is about as hoppy a beer as I can stand, since I usually prefer darker beers that are maltier, like Samuel  Smith's Nut Brown Ale. This beer has enough malt to keep it from being too bitter, and it has enough hops to satisfy any hophead cravings you may have. It is extremely drinkable year-round, but be careful: it is 9% alcohol because of the absurd amount of hops and the malt necessary to make it balanced. It is the only beer that I have ever tasted and immediately thought, """That is genius.""" And I still feel that way. A ridiculously good beer that any beer drinker, and, especially, any fan of IPA's, needs to try."
""
"I would seek this one out and purchase again. As with the 60 minute though, this one is not readily available near me either. I will end up finding something a bit easier to get and similar flavor. Delicious nonetheless though."
""
""
""
"Outstanding IPA - haters should give it another shot, IMO."
"A swill so foul I would take the disgusting Natural Light over it any day."
"Really doesn't taste like a double IPA at all. If this was billed as an American Strong Ale it would get a higher rating from me. Tastes alright, but it's cloyingly sweet and not hoppy enough. Has some disgusting molasses and licorice notes. Some bitterness but absolutely NO citrus, cat piss, or agressive hop character. This beer is fresh too (bottled 11/14/14 and today is 12/17/14). Every time I try Dogfish beers, I like them less and less."
""
""
""
""
"Better draft, like so many others - alas not more common."
""
""
""

"A great beer to sip on. it has a smith hoppy flavor you expect from a IPA. be carful with 9%alc it might be more then you wanted. This is one of my go to beers, for a relaxing Friday."

""
""
"Overall, this is an awesomely crafted, well-balanced beer. For anyone new to craft beer, this is an excellent example/ starting point for a great IPA. The beer is bitter, but isn’t the typical hop-bomb that tends to alienate non-IPA drinkers. The only downside to this beer is that it is a little too thick, which may be due to the extra malt. I think a tad bit more carbonation would give it a little more of a lightening lift. I would rate this beer a 97/100!"
""
""
""
""

"great Imperial IPA but this one seems to aim to please the majority other than those seeking higher ibu hoppy beers. I know it takes about a month to brew this beer at Dogfish Head with continuously dry hopping it which shows it at 90 ibu but its hard to pull the bitterness from the enormous malt character, its definitely a hoppy beer for sure but it seems to have almost an over barring malt linger on the taste. All together though great IPA."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Color is a clear rust/copper color with a fine head and lengthy lacing. Smells of sweet hickory BBQ, can't describe anyway else. Taste is very malty up front with almost no hop bite and a mildly sweet smooth finish. Drank on 12-3-14, bottled on 9-23-14 but bottle says it ages well. This IPA,in a blind taste test would pass as an Amber IMO. Doesn't carry any traditional IPA characteristics but DFH isn't traditional either. They just make good beer the way they want and this is a good beer. Way too smooth and easy drinking for a 9% beer. Will be buying more!"

"It's a decent beer but for $10/6pk I demand an imperial rock my socks off hops-wise. This is more malty than anything and I don't understand the love for this or any of the Dogfish offerings I've tried.  That said it's OK... just not close to living up to the hype or price."

"I'm not a sophisticated beer taster.  I never feel comfortable talking about all those flavor nuances others expound on.  I get citrus, pine,  malt & a few other flavors, but that's about it.  I just know what I like, and this IPA is drinkable, but based on the numbers, I expected something really special.  What I actually tasted was something especially sweet, with a fairly prominent alcohol taste.  Not all that amazing.  So sweet, in fact that I don't think I'll be drinking it again.  Way overpriced for my unrefined palate.  In the end, it's the overpowering sweetness that turns me off.  Worth about $7.99/six pack, no more."
""
""
""
""
""
"There's an initially deceptive smoothness that ultimately becomes overpowered by cloying bitterness. The more I drink, the stronger the bitterness becomes. This beer lacks balance. I don't like it at all."

"On tap in a glass, interesting mix of smells and flavors, but really does not have the traditional character of an IPA or DIPA. Mix of sweet malt and bitter hops with a grapefruit """pith""" aftertaste - not a good flavor lingering at the end."

"Served in a tulip glass, this brew pours a gorgeous dark amber with an almost nonexistent head and thin lacing. The nose is primarily malt, honey, pine and peach/apricot, with faint touches of citrus. Atypical for a DIPA, a strong hop presence competes with an almost overwhelming malty sweetness - this is by far the sweetest DIPA I've tasted this far. I get the apricot/honey/malt at the beginning, followed by the bitter tinge and citrus of the hops, finishing with a boozy moonshine presence. A great-tasting beer for sure, if not an excellent example of the DIPA style."

"Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA is one of the few beers I've tried that I'm convinced has a soul. The first sip is almost hypnotic. Its a wonderful balance of hops and loads of deep, dark, earthy undertones that keep you coming back for more. It needs to be ice cold to really enjoy all the depth. Word to the wise - it has one hell of a punch! So be careful, this puppy will sneak up on you. This is one American Double IPA that you must try!"

"I'm updating my review. This DIPA is certainly different than most of the doubles I love, the hops are far more integrated rather than being the star of the show, but it's still freaking delicious and a great example of an east coast IPA."

"Probably one of the better IPA's I have had.  The flavor is perfectly balanced between the bitter hops, citrus, pine, and malt.  My only complaint might be the heavier mouth feel.  I think I would prefer it if this IPA was a tad bit drier.  But overall, very pleasant to drink."

"O-There are a couple of big IPAs I like better but this is still a really nice beer.  Great to look at, feels very satisfying as well, perhaps it's just me but it lacks some of the hop characteristic/complexity of some of the others.  I will, of course, still buy more.  4.25/5"

"Doesn't get much better than this. Good stuff."
"Overall: this is a fantastic take on the American IPA. The dry-hopping and continual hopping really allows the full, fresh flavour of the hops to come through. The price is a bit prohobitive at around AU$170+ for a case of 24 x 330mL, but that's to be expected when so many hops are used in a beer."

"DFH's 90 minute pours a beautiful golden caramel color and forms a descent head. The nose and taste on this beer are awesome and super rich with notes of malt, hops, nuts, and bacon grease. The medium-full body on 90 minute is well balanced by its good carbonation."

"I know there are IPA's I've not tried yet, so I've reserved 0.25 for 120 IPA.  This was absolutely wonderful.  My son and I were amazed at how smooth the IP was.  A thorough pleasure to sip and enjoy.  It cost a lot so it's a rare treat, but I will do this again."

"The first time I had this beer was what really turned me on to IPA's, its what you think of when you drink a DIPA, although I have drank many more since that blow this one away. I recently saw this on sale so I thought I would give it a good overview now that I am more in tune with the style and I will have to say that after trying some other bruisers that this one was a bit disappointing. I say this because I have become somewhat of a hop addict. I felt that there was too much malt in the beer making it a bit too sweet for what I prefer. Nevertheless, I will give it a higher mark because it was the beer that got me into the style and for that reason it does deserve a higher place in the pantheon of DIPA's. If nothing else it is produced year around and is pretty much obtainable everywhere and often you can find grocery stores that mark it down, which as we know is a nice thing considering the rising prices of beer lately."

"BOD 4/16/14. Clear light amber pour with a touch of ruby. Massive head that retains and laces quite well. Complex nose of tropical, citrus and pine hops over a biscuit sweetness with a slight spicy note. Medium body, but on the higher end and quite smooth, with normal carbonation that imparts a bit of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is very complex, but yet well balanced with its 3 main components - hops, bitterness and sweetness. It begins with the hop flavors of the nose, transitions to a mild spicy bitterness and finishes with a smooth sweetness over an alcohol note. As it warms, the body approaches full with a nice oily texture and the alcohol more prevalent in the finish."

"T: Lots of resinous pine cones. Orange citrus. Lighter fruits-apricot and pineapple. But what makes this beer distinctive is its great malt backbone contributing a bready aspect to cope with the heavier flavors of raisin and fig. Slight buttery and brandy alcohol sensation on end, nut sweetened by presence of aforementioned fruits. The heaviness of the malts is definitely reminiscent of Bengal Lancer or an IIPA, but the citrus, piney, dank hops give it an appropriate hop presence found in most DIPAs."

I've had 60 minute and 120 minute but the 90 is quite surprising for the boldness yet complemented by elegance. Very deceiving and seductive. I can't remember the last time a beer made me sweat. thx DFH for enlightening me, I'm humbled"

"The smell of hops whisks off the head of this IPA. There is a hoppy puckiness to the mouthfeel. A great quality of this beer is its finish- highlighting a smooth melding of hops and grass, There is the presence here of a perfectly balanced hops aftertaste- the ultimate IPA experience."

"Overall:  While this is a great beer, its not my personal flavor preference for a double IPA.  There is a significant amount of malt used which throws off the balance with some booziness and warmth.  I still enjoy this from time to time but I personally want an unbalanced  double IPA in the opposite direction."

"O: I used to hold DFH's 90-minute in the highest regards, praising it as one of the best DIPAs on the market. While I still feel it's a remarkable beer, it just doesn't push the same buttons as it used to for me. This beer struggles for balance, with the malts often taking the upper hand. While that's not an issue for everyone, it's certainly not what a bitter-freak like me looks for. With that being said, this is an excellent beer that I'll continue to drink in the future, but it'll be reserved for my maltier moods."

"I'm not a fan of IPAs and I've tried a lot of them,but this one is great. The balance is perfect it's not overly hoppy. Dogfish head hit a home run with this one and I think everyone should try it at least once it's well worth the money. It also doesn't leave that horrible bitter taste in your mouth when your done drinking it that most IPAs do."

"Poured from a bottle into a mason jar at J&R Tacos in downtown Merced. Unfiltered honey-golden color, one-finger head with persistent lacing. Aroma is light roasted malt, and fragrant floral hops. Flavor, as you probably all know so well, is out-of-this-world amazing, malt, a little sweetness, a bit of apricots, a bit of pine, and delightful hops, well-balanced, and not at all mild. Mouthfeel is medium, not quite chewy. Overall this is the most amazing flabbergasting tasty IPA I have ever sampled. But what do I know? Try it, if you haven't!"

"This is a solid IPA but not enough hops to balance out the alcohol. It has a nice color, very small head, and the hint of hops hits your nose as you take your first sip. It begins nicely but finishes with too much alcohol and not enough hoppiness. It is readily available in a four-pack."

"Popped the cap on this one at 11AM on hot summer Arizona morning. I prefer it a bit colder, but that being said I really have a lot to learn about proper beer temps. It was I'm gonna guess around 50 degrees or so. After the first sip I definitely caught a chocolate note which I have not heard anyone else mention. Deep amber color, nice head. Extremely complex flavors. This one is a winner."
""
""
""
""
"I poured this bottle into a pint glass, got a 1""" head that lasted longer than most, and a not-too-strong piney smell. What I think saves this beer for me is the """ridiculous amount of English Two-Row Barley""" that Dogfish Head uses after the 90-minute hopping. The taste is strong with both hops and malt at the front, the finish is pretty dry, but for me, a little too sour. Still, I'd drink this over the mass-produced pisswassers any day - but there are other beers I'd still rather spend the money on."

"Perhaps my palate is accustomed to NW IPAs, but too much malt vs hops is what strikes me here. My bottle was dated 3/21/14 which puts it right at 3months. Appearance is a lovely clear amber with a nice 2-3 inch head. Smell and taste is more sweet malty than piney hops. A good beer, but I'll stick with the hoppier choices out there."

"A decent beer, though I prefer more 'hops' than 'malt' in my IPA (the balance seems more towards the malt side). Decent, burnt-amber color that betrays the maltiness of this IPA. I can see why its rated so high but, for my taste, seemed a bit too flat (i.e. nothing popped)."

"O- Standard by which I compare all DIPAs. Great beer anytime of year."
"I would have rated this beer much higher had I gotten around to writing a review years ago when I first tasted it. The problem with DFH90 is that other breweries caught up over the past few years and are not available in specialty/beer stored (Lagunitas comes to mind...I'm on the East coast). This beer simply doesn't carry the hop nose I personally feel is required to be in the top tier of imperial IPAs now available. Don't get me wrong...I like this beer very much. I just bought it today because I was on a business trip and this was available at the local Safeway supermarket. I simply caveat this review by saying I don't think this beer is still in the elite of top IIPAs in the country."
""
""
""
"I do love ipa's and maybe I am biased towards the west coast style. This isn't a bad beer, it is just not that good of an IPA these days. If you like a strong east coast style with a lot of malt and a little aroma this is for you"

"Pours a deep copper color with ample head and persistent lacing. Complex aroma. This is a very, very good IPA. The flavor is complex with notes of citrus, coffee, and chocolate. Very nicely balanced - not too bitter and not too sweet. Many people who swear that they don't like IPAs like this one. Delicious!"
""
"Strong tasting beer it has an aftertaste that is awful...hoppy and the positive is it takes you less beer to get a buzz going...negative is I find the taste strong...and bitter it says I have to have 250 characters so I mean it is also a pricey beer to find at liquor stores but you do get a nice buzz off of it which is good maybe men enjoy this beer more than women, I just don't have the taste for it but yeaaa"

"Golden amber pour with fine head and lacing. Aromas of honey, pine, flowers and citrus. 90 minute is a malt first DIPA in the vein of hopslam but there are lovely subtle flavors that make this beer an exception to my """I prefer dry IPAs""" mentality. Sweet malts and honey lead the flavor profile. The hopping provides floral, piney and orange citrus aromas and is not overly bitter. There is apparent alcohol in the finish but it is not unpleasant. I would prefer a more prominent hop flavor overall but the flavors are very well integrated. The carbonation is active and beer is a bit viscous, providing a creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this beer is outstanding and is deserving of its reputation. Even though my preference in IPAs leads towards the drier and hoppier, I will gladly drink a 90 minute when I'm in the mood for a big IPA."

"This beer really surprised me. I was expecting a super hoppy, bitter IPA. The first sip was extremely smooth and went down easy. It has a medium copper color and a nice, frothy, 1/2 inch head. I could taste a hoppy, citrus, vanilla, flavor. Very smooth first sip with a small amount of hoppy bitterness aftertaste. Very impressed with this beer and will be drinking many more!"

"High(ish) alcohol %. A great beer to go with dinner."
"BTW, what's up with Dogfish Head? They can brew some of the most sublime ales on the planet. There's 90-Minute, Burton Baton is a work of art, if your palate isn't adjusted to the happiness of a DIPA, then 60-Minute is an excellent IPA - but then they dump fruit and spices in their brews, run them through their goofy """enamel animal""" so that you can screw up their brewmaster's creation with whatever abomination you wish - it's as if Ferrari took a set of keys to the paint job of every other car that rolled off its line. But 90 Minutes is the real deal. And if you're a devotee of Imperial / Double IPAs, it's one of the great values among broadly available craft ales."
"Probably my favorite beer/ale of all-time. That's a bold statement, and I rarely like to make statements that strong, BUT this is just a superior IPA. It has everything: color, smell, mouthfeel, taste, and a high ABV to boot. It's so smooth and delicious that you won't even notice the 9% abv. But, be careful...it is there!"

"Smooth bitterness, sweet caramel, warming alcohol. Nice and sticky mouthfeel from the hops, with a bit of spiciness. Medium-full bodied from the malt with a nice sweetness and malt character in the middle, and the alcohol coming in at the end to dry up and balance everything out."
""
""
"Pours a nice yellow beer. Little carbonation formed. Smell doesn't have strong hops, only a faint amount. Taste is more like a regular ale. There is no bitterness to this beer. There is no cloudiness to this beer either. I guess since this beer is bottle conditioned, they decided to call it an IPA. Other than that, this is just another ale."

""
""
""

"I'm a dark beer lover. IPAs are traditionally amber to light in color. As most IPAs are of various levels of bitterness from the hops used, when I discovered Imperial IPAs, a new fondness for the style was born. This is smooth and not overpowering, but still has the right amount of bitterness that lets you know it's an IPA. Great beer all around that may be better on hot days. I alternate this with Old Rasputin from North Coast Brewery for longer drinking sessions."

"I can't imagine what I say hasn't been said before, but really a terrific IPA that is usually (depending on the state) easy to get. The color is a hazy yellow with a lot of citrus hops in the nose. The taste is fantastic with great hop flavors in the beginning with sweeter flavors coming through after that. This beer is thick and has a little bit of a molasses aftertaste that lingers and enhances the flavor of the hops. Would definitely recommend."

"Appearance is a clear dark color with a two finger white head. Aroma consists of sweet malts and a slight booziness. Taste is big on the caramel malt with grape and citrus adding to the sweetness but not too much. Decent amount of bitterness and no booze despite the aroma. Overall, I like this, but i just doesn't live up to the level it use to for me. Its a sweeter dipa than im use to and grape/citrus combo is alright. Very good beer, but not something Ill be rushing to get again."

The unique thing about this beer is that it is 9% ABV and drinks very smooth. I am enjoying this one slowly and with nachos, of all things! The saltiness, spices and cheese make the bitter contrast of the hops in 90 Minute Imperial IPA a real treat."

"East Coast IPAs are for pussies. Try a Stone """Enjoy By""" for a true double IPA or a Great Divide Hercules Double IPA. This is a sweet malty beer, not real hoppy or bitter. Hides the alcohol. More like a hoppy Amber ale than an IPA. Earthy, piney, resin, balanced but not like a West Coast IPA at all. I need more hops, citrus, and grapefruit. Sorry Dogfish, you are just not for us West Coast Double IPA beer geeks."

"O-90 Minute was the first craft beer I had that made me think and say, """this is the best beer I have ever had""". A great springboard to discover even better craft out in the world. You will return to 90 Minute always even if you master your palate. It's bold, flavorful and versatile in all departments of palate. It can benefit from tweaking, mainly in feel. But the smell and taste are perfect. If 90 Minute had the robust, thick, sizzling feel of say Dogfish Head-Palo Santo Marron, it would be unbeatable. 90 Minute looks and tastes dark. It could be a new beer style, a Brown American Double/Imperial IPA."

"I drank my first Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA back in March of 2010 in Miami, Florida and it was awesome. It hits the taste buds with that strong imperial IPA taste and the 9.0% alcohol (ABV) gives it that hard edge and wakes you up (or puts you to sleep if you drink too many). It pours darkish, with a reddish amber tint, finger sized tan head, and some carbonation. The main taste is bitter, with hoppy, caramel, fruity, and sweet. It finishes dry and leaves fruit like aftertaste. It is very filling. This is an awesome beer."

"O- My 1st time trying this classic. It wont be the last."

"O: This is a great tasting IPA that is very easy to find here on the east coast. I would say that at $9.99 for a four pack, it is very well priced. I was drinking these back and forth with Hopslam, and to be honest, I think 90 minute IPA bests it. It is a phenomenal IPA made by a very phenomenal brewery. Can’t say enough about their line of products. This is a beer that lives up to its name."

"Bottle from Proof. Pours a coppery-gold-orange. Head was off white but faded under a minute. Good legs and lacing is decent. Collar has large bubbles and very small bubbles that hold together for a medium thickness. Wisps hold throughout. Aroma is resiny and toasty malt, a touch of citrus as well. Taste is that big malt backbone with the hops playing a much smaller role than I remember. I definitely haven't had this beer in a few years, and my palate has changed considerably. I get some of the resin and citrus in the palate, but it's mostly a caramel malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is sticky sugar-like, medium body, medium-high carbonation. Slightly boozey."
""
"Not my favorite dipa but very different"
""
""
""
"Clear orange/copper colored brew with light carbonation and white head that left slight lacing along the entire glass. Smells of sweet fresh hops, citrus, pine, and possibly caramel. Tastes of sweet malts, slight caramel, a hint of bitter hops; but yet completely smooth and indulgent. Light, creamy, and full bodied mouthfeel. Extremely well-balanced, complex, DIPA that cannot be ignored. Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA is my recommended all-time favorite Imperial IPA. Enjoy; quite possibly the finest of beers!"

"A balanced IPA with somewhat excessive malt and spice on the rear end. Not a typical """fresh""" hoppy west coast IPA. Tasty and very drinkable. A quality product but not likely to purchase again due to subject preferences for more clean, fresh hop tastes."

"Pours a gold, burnt orange color with a generous frothy, white head; retention and lacing are both impressive. The aroma is of spiced hops and herbs, pine, wet earth/dirt, and distant citrus (orange and lemon zest mostly). It tastes of spicy, earthen hops, rich wood, wet earth, pine, and citrus. The mouthfeel is rich and full, but not heavy. Finish is crisp and refreshing with only a slight resinous sensation. Overall, this a unique, more earthen and “hearty” take on the IPA style; refreshing in this day’s market."

"Overall, this is one great brew! I always enjoy drinking this."
""
""
""
""
"O: Awesome, a hop bomb but super palatable from the lack of lasting bitterness. Well structured, unique, and accessible."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: A drinkable DIPA that is balanced to near perfection. I could drink a six pack thinking I downed a 6% beer which could get you in trouble. I've had better DIPA's, but not by much."

"Poured into special spiegelau """IPA glass""". Fair amt of citrus peel, pineapple and mango on the nose with a matching flavor and a spice and caramelized sugar sweetness. Very smooth balanced and drinkable, goes down easy. One of my favorite dogfish brewes"
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One of the best IPAs I have encountered. I cut my beer teeth on Dogfish's 60 Minute, but their 90 Minute is better in every way except price. Once you pour this beer you get a huge rush of hops - citrusy and a bit of pine. While the IBUs are up there, it drinks very smooth."

"Very interesting DIPA. I'm not sure if this is what it's supposed to taste like, but I'm looking forward to trying it again. Maybe from a bottle next time."

"This is the beer that got me away from lawnmower beers and into crafts. The appearance is a rich reddish amber with a substantial off white head and nice lacing. The aroma is deep and bitter but also sweet and malty. The taste is beyond compare. As well balanced as a beer can be. Just the right hoppy bitterness but with a wonderful malt backbone to hold up to the hops. There are even some roasty notes reminiscent of coffee on the tail of this beer. To top it all off, it is extremely drinkable for a 9% er. This is everything a well crafted beer should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"What else can you say other than it's extremely good beer. Definitely one of the top 10 IPA's around. It's not over annoying with the hops. I love hoppy beers but some take it too far. I like to taste other notes besides hoppy. It's a very good balance of flavors and has remained consistent over the years."

That isn't to say that it's the best in my opinion, I definitely prefer more tropical IPAs, but the malt backbone here, uncharacteristic of the American DIPA, should be characteristic of the American DIPA."

"Beer is medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a smooth (5/6) and lowly foamy (1/6) beer. Ethanol readily apparent as burning on the tongue and back of throat, mild heat in nostrils. Closes dry, as expected, with heavy stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Now this is one fine beer! I highly recommend it. Dogfish Head found a perfect balance with this IPA. A nice kick at 9 percent without the overbearing alcohol kick despite the taste. Its been a while since I've had a 90 Minute, but I'm not going to let it be too long before I get another."

"O - This beer surprised me. I've had the 60 minute, and I kind of expected a hoppier version. While technically true, the amazing balance with the huge malt load absolutely shocked me."
"Woah, what a full mouth experience! The first smell might send you away thinking it might be too bitter, but give it a chance! This beer is very fresh tasting, kind of piney, but it actually goes down very smoothly. It absolutely has my respect even if it is not my favorite beer. This is one IPA I actually think I may enjoy better out of a bottle than on tap to cool it's upfront bitter taste, though give it a chance because it is definitely a quality drink (if you can't tell already based on the fact that its from DFH Brewery)"

"Would easily buy again."
"Pours out a dark amber in color with a nice white, one-finger head with good retention and nice lacing. Smell is of some nice sweet caramel malt, with a nice floral bouquet from the hops. I get pineapple, guava, orange, and basically more tropical fruits from the hops. The nose seems to be very well balanced for the style. Taste is really almost exactly like the nose except the malts and hops are more forward but still just as balanced. There is a slight bit of bitterness in the taste that stays in the mouth and doesn't hit the throat much. The mouthfeel is sort of thinner than I expected but it seems to fit the style. Overall this is a REALLY well balanced beer for the style. I thought it would be a hop-bomb but it is nothing like that. Just a really well put together beer."
""
"Overall - A really tasty beer. Unique flavor profile for sure. Has great balance being a strong dipa. Malts are just as present as the hops yet are not overpowering. This is not a bitter beer at all and still easy to drink at 9%. Worth a drink for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer is just wonderful. It is a handful of taste as far as hops concerns. I thought that the bitterness would be a tad higher."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A really solid take on a Imperial IPA. Much different than the typical West Coast style. The hops are backed by a big malt presence. Balanced but still bold."
""

"Overall, one of my favorite DFH. A bit overpriced, but I'll buy again on rare occasion."

""
""
""
""
""

"This beer is really good, even outstanding, however it is very overpriced and extremely overrated. You can look at the other reviews for specific characteristics. I would simply advise that you try it at least once, and then try New Belgium Rampant. If you like this style I think you will choose the latter based on the price."

""
""
""
""

"O - This is a very nice IIPA that DFH has brewed. I really like how it is big and sweet like an amber and moves into a big hoppy profile. I may have to drink this next to Nugget Nectar as they seem to have similar characteristics."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"I poured this from a bottle into a standard pint class and overlooked the lackluster head due to the appealing copper color of the beer. I found the beer to have a delicate floral citrus nose. Drinking the beer I enjoyed the floral, fruity, and citrus flavor on the front followed by piney and hop forward back. Overall, worth the investment and a worth trying in the saturated I.P.A. market."

"Poured out of a bottle into my New Holland pint glass. Nice thick head that leaves lacing all the way through the taste test. Color is a clear rusty amber. Looks delicious. Typical IPA floral, piney nose. Very tasty but towards the end the hops are bitterly unleashed and slightly detract from overall balance. Mouth feel lingers on the tongue, slightly chewy. Very tasty IIPA, just short of world class. Maybe my IPA observations are skewed since I live in Two Heart land."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The front of the tongue is prickled by pine & citrus rind, with a smooth, somewhat bitter, finish on the back of the tongue. The complex hop profile presents citrus and fruit, giving way to a smoother, diacetyl sulfur and booze. The sweet malt graininess hits rewind, as if to rewrite the front-end bitterness that came before it. The two struggle and, in the end, leave a dry, surprisingly clean finish."

For an Ipa it is smooth and has a dark ritch color to it. have not tried the 120 minute. if you enjoy IPA's and can not handle this IPA then you are a pussy. Much rather drink this ipa over any sierra nevada. Im not a sierra nevada fan. I could drink this IPA all day long like an all day ipa. May be 9% but does not phase me because I am american. This beer is america in a can. I also enjoy floral beers. Try troegs perpetual IPA it wont dissapoint."

"O: Amazing! Easily one of my new favorites. Expertly crafted. The balance on this is incredible and so drinkable for 9%. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. It is worth it."
"Appearance on this beer is awesome. Clear orange/copper color with a good head and tons of lacing down the entire glass. Delicious super resiny hop aroma that tickles the nose but not without some sweet malty characteristics coming across as well especially as it warms. The taste is incredibly balanced. I was expecting this to be a serious hop bomb and don't be mistaken this is quite a hoppy beer but compared to some west coast imperial or double IPA's the flavor of this brew is not dominated by it's hop qualities and one can really pick up on it's roasted malt characteristics. This is a great beer but I think that is pretty much common knowledge by this point. I honestly don't even really know why I bothered reviewing this. Go get some, it's damn good."
""
"I would just like to apologize for my former score of 1.75. My palate was not ready for DIPA's and I judged too subjectively. This really is a very good, well-balanced DIPA, and I will be having this again in the future. Highly recommended, though I still prefer regular IPA's at this point."

"O: I had to fight not to rate this beer a 5 because its perfection to me. Bottle over growler and tap hands down. I always have this in stock and handy somewhere. Makes it even better that 2 bottles put down quick can get you buzzin. The best offering from DFH and the best DIPA I've had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Never had a DIPA before? Then give this a try - it's ridiculously easy to find (in most states), not bitter, and less than impossible to drink. For my personal tastes, it's still too malty. Even a measly year ago, this was a nice fall back option in my craft-derived portion of MD, but now that the selection is improving here, it's hard to muster any desire to purchase this again over other (superior) beers."

"About half-way through the glass I began eating a spicy chili prepared by friend and that's when I really started to appreciate this arugula flavor that kept popping into my senses. Inexplicably, I poured the last ounce of beer into the remainder of my chili, stirred it about and then...CRUSHED IT! Intrigued by my actions, the rest of those in attendance poured a little of the beer into their bowls and followed suit. We all silently stood up from our chairs. Made our way into the kitchen. Fixed another bowl of chili and cracked the last 90 Minute IPA and divided it up amongst us....directly into our chili."

"Overall: A crisp, well-balanced, tasty IPA. Perfect balance between hop bitterness and flavor. The C hops, while prominent, are not over-the-top. The bitterness is high, but not harsh. An excellent choice for both hop heads, and people just getting into IPAs. For me, this was much preferable to the 60 minute IPA. Much more flavorful."

"O-This classic was one of my first big IPAs (now known as IIPAs) many moons ago when I first got into beer. I remember thinking it was so bitter and chewy that I could barely finish the bottle. My how my palate has changed as I gulp down the last drop this evening. Today's bottle was a reminder of what a good, old-school IIPA tastes like: bitter, herbal, full of pine, big hop oil, but with a healthy balance of caramel malt and well-integrated alcohol. Mouthfeel is also big and chewy. I like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The hops come out to greet you as soon as you finish pouring, with a distinct grapefruit citrus punch and a beautiful amber color. The taste was exceptional. It follows the 60 minute’s malty backbone with a strong malt flavor that help balance the enormous hops. This IIPA was very thick and chewy with plenty of hops on the front end that gave way to a smooth vanilla malt finish. This was an outstanding beer and right up there with one of the best of the style. This is a must try beer for any hophead and one that is easy to enjoy."

"While I must admit I have yet to try the DIPA's from Russian River Brewery in CA, the Double IPA's from Dogfish have  been the  best balanced and most complex I have had to date. So many DIPA's hide various inadequacies with the excessive use of hops. It would be like going to get a pizza and saying, """I like the use of oregano.""" Next time you go, the whole pizza is covered with oregano."

"Taste starts with earthy and nutty, then quickly moves on to caramel malt, dark bread, and dry raisin, then a sweet floral, slightly citric, bitter finish. Slighty heavier than average body with about average carbonation, pretty creamy and chewy, I think this mouthfeel compliments the malt presence well."

"An outstanding beer from start to finish. It looked & smelled great but tasted pretty much perfect with a great mix of sweet caramel malts and bitter hops with the usual citrus and grapefruit flavours coming through as well. The only negative about this beer is that it isn't available in the UK and I'll have to wait far too long before I get to try it again."
""
"Beer is creamy and full-bodied, finishes off with a very refreshing, crisp feel to it. If you are new to dogfish head IPAs, I would definitely start off with 60 minute and graduate to this as I can definitely see it being a polarizing beer, but if you have the appreciation for good brewings, this beer is definitely a treat."
"Overall: This is far from your average IPA. It's amazing how 30 more minutes of boiling and hopping can make the 90 Minute so different from the 60 Minute. This is a true imperial IPA that tastes mature and commands respect. Dogfish, as always, has achieved something unique and complex with this brew. Many IPAs seem to measure themselves by the amount of hops they can cram in. The 90 Minute is hopped generously and the bitter punch is certainly there, but there is a rich flavor that makes this a really wonderful beer that stands out from the rest."

"This beer has a very amber golden color, with a nice foam head that lasts for a little while. The first smell I got of was noticeable pine, hops, and citrus. Taste was mild hops, somewhat bitter and a slight taste of the alcohol, but not too much. Very little aftertaste, went down smooth and refreshing considering the ABV. My overall impression for this beer is its a very solid and enjoyable beer, definitely looking forward to this one again."
""
""
"O: I'm quite impressed. Huge diverse flavor profile without any one flavor jumping out and taking over; each flavor profile seems to have its moment to shine. Well rounded and balanced. Only criticism is that it's just a bit on the big side. It's got a high abv and finishes very very dry, which means one is more than enough for me. Forgivable since developing this much flavor in a smaller beer is pretty near impossible."

"A: Sticky and patchy head that laces the length of the glass, light copper in color, all around a nice looking brew - 4.00, S: Robust bread and grains balanced nicely with tons of citrusy and earthy hops, there is also some tropical fruits such as pineapple, near perfect nose for a double IPA - 4.50, T: As it warms a more dominant pine comes through, alcohol is evident and provides a slight drying, tons of hops balanced with some sweet bready malt and caramel, I also taste some pine and spiciness – 4.50, M: Mouthfeel is sticky with a medium to heavy body – 3.50, D: When I first sampled this beer back in 2007 this was classified as an IPA but somewhere along the wall it was upgraded to a double IPA, a wonderful beer that is routinely in my rotation - 4.00"

"O - One of the best, just outside my top 10. Very complex flavor. Lot's of characteristics to both the hops and the malts. I believe the best IPA's/DIPA's have an outstanding malt backbone, as this one does. Very unique with the peppery tastes. I highly recommend this brew to any DIPA fan."
""
"Poured coppery orange into a goblet. Produced about a half inch of head that sank down into a film across the top and a ring of bubbles around the rim. The nose on this is out of control. Juicy, creamy pineapple - smells like an umbrella drink. The flavor is so solid and well structured, I'd say perfectly balanced malt and citrusy hops. Undetectable booze on 9% abv, and a clean, clean finish. This is just a perfectly balanced, delicious IIPA. Beautifully done."

"Dogfish Head 90 Minute Imperial IPA ---4.5/5."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - 4.50 - What makes this beer great is it's original character. With strong floral hops it's slightly different from the citrusy imperial ipa's such as Ruination/Ruinten/Hopslam. It's light comparing roses to grapefruit. Both are good but they're still completely different. I would keep this beer around just to compare to other IPAs, since it is so unique."

"Overall-been waiting awhile to try this one, I must say I didn't expect what I got. It seems to me more of a jacked up American barley wine. Its still very good, but I don't think it would stand up to the other big boys on the market. 3.75"
""
"Served on tap with solid lacing clinging to the glass. If you like your hops, you won't be disappointed with this. Both smell and taste feature pine, citrus, grapefruit, and floral notes/flavors. It's a bit spicy, the ABV is well concealed. The citrus seems to be a bit unbalanced, but the beer is still far more complex than I can appreciate. The mouthfeel is spot on, with medium thickness, just the right amount of dryness, and a dry but pleasant finish. While IPAs aren't my first choice, there's a lot to love about this one."

"My overall impression of this beer is that it's quite good, but a bit overhyped; I'm sensing a pattern here with Dogfish Head beers. They're good and I'd be glad to drink them, I appreciate what the guys at Dogfish Head are doing, but I feel they're slightly overhyped and overpriced. My main complaint with this brew is that it's just too damn sweet; I realize it may be a matter of personal taste, but I prefer lighter, more bitter flavors with my IPAs. All that said, you'd be missing out if you didn't at least try this beer. Cheers to good health and good beer."

"As soon as I poured I could tell this is a beast of a beer. You can see the intensity of the carbonation and cloudiness, culminating in an alcoholic monster that looks you in the eye and dares you to drink it. The aroma is rich with hoppiness. My tongue could see past the hop attack and pick up the pine and citrus that leaned more towards mango. The malt component helps to balance out what would otherwise become a near-fatal, but welcome, overdose of hops. Should the PTB at DFH ever decide to distribue in Iowa again it would be a welcome site."

"I'm a little confused with this beer. I guess i was expecting more bitterness from the hops. It almost taste like 2-row took the front seat and hops took the back seat. It has a sweet flavor through out. It seems to sweet to be my favorite IPA. It's not a bad beer by any means, but it isn't what i expected from some of the higher ratings."

"O: First off. I am not your A-typical Hop head. I am very particular about them.  Of the DIPA's I've tried this is the go to for me.  Malty upfront with hops kick. Make no mistake, this is a Hop A-Bomb. If there is a better DIPA, I have not tried it. A pleasure and one of the finest examples of the style on the East coast or the US for that matter."
"O: Easily the best IPA I've had to date and I do not favor IPAs in general. I call most IPAs and APAs """hop waters""" due to their pathetic lack of malt for the sake of cost and they just taste like chalk or bitter soap. This one has restored my faith that the Victorian IPA is not dead (despite being classified American IPA). This is not a casual everyday beer (it's a bit expensive) but something to go with a rich meal, Texas BBQ would pair well."

It is a great balanced beer and I would definitely have it again. It is very unique. I definitely want to try this on a blind taste."

"On the taste side it's just a smooth clean brew. Lots of good sweet hops on the start and finish with a really enjoyable flow. It's hard to believe this is 9%."

""

"O: 4.5 There was a lot of hype behind this one, I was worried it wouldn't live up. It definitely was not what I expected, but in a good way. Wish I had easier access, hope they distribute in Indiana soon..."
""
"Didnt realize what I was drinking when I was drinking it... Didnt strike me as the best but drinkable nonetheless... After I finished I realized that I chugged the beer dt it was so drinkable. Very overated beer for the hype it gets but I love beer so I loved this beer as well. Drank from the bottle so didnt see the color... Which is normal at a bbq. Yeah... it was a good day that one... Now... If i could only try the 120."

"O - This is an awesome DIPA. For the price this is unbeatable. A classic."
""
""
"Bottled 5/30/13, so pretty damn fresh!"
""
""
"O - Great IPA, the very best you can expect to ever find sharing space with the masses in a grocery store."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Fantasic beer. Makes me reconsider drinking IPA more often."
"Edit: originally made reference to 60 minute, meant to write 90. Fixed now."

"Pours clear and orange amber with a scant finger of loose foam that didn’t last at all. Plenty of active carbonation. Left a thin ring and a small cap. Nose is sweet orange on top of tall bread and caramel. A touch of floral and pine, a little honey and grass. Smells like sugar. The nose on this beer is perfectly sweet and juicy. Taste is piney hops with a bit of oil on a full malt base. Nutty, sweet and floral, somewhat tame. A little sticky and buttery. It’s syrupy in the almost dry finish and it’s pretty sweet. So sweet that you might not realize just how bitter the hops really are until they tickle the back palate with a little oil and bitter. Achieves a smooth balance between all it has to offer from both hops and malt. Polite yet engaging.Very approachable even with the higher abv and was quite charming."

"O - This beer grew on me a bit as it warmed, but was a bit of a letdown from what I expected. The hop profile just didn't do it for me. I prefer the 60 minute!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Interesting, complex hops-centered. IIPA."
""
"O- My new favorite IPA! At 9% ABV, I can learn to deal with a 4-pack. :)"
"Overall - A really excellent brew, great for its style. Even a non hop head like me can enjoy. Now on to the 120.... If I can find it"

"The cost attracted me to give this a try at $10.99 for a 4-pk. Overall it's a great IPA and it the aftertaste is better than normal. The smell and after taste reminds me of lawn grass. The taste is also a bit bitter at first but evens-out at the end - typical IPA. I think they did well okay with this one but not something I would buy again based on my personal taste. Overall, it is better than most IPA's but you're also paying for it."
""
"Overall/Comments: An excellent double IPA that doesn't stray from the path. Extremely well put together with an awesome nose and exceptional flavor profile. Classified as an American Double/Imperial IPA at 9% ABV. Consumed 3/1/13."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I never cease to be impressed by this beer. A staple IPA, for sure -- plentifully available, delicious, and inexpensive. This has been a long-standing favorite of mine, and critically revisiting it on the occasion of purchasing this new snifter has reminded me just why I try to keep this on-hand."

"how have I never reviewed the 90? this was an old standby for a number of years when I was back east, but I guess the Colorado market has got me distracted. picked up my first 4 pack in ages, and I just love it. almost forgot how good it is. pours a perfectly clear radiant copper color, lighter than that really, but not red enough to be amber, like medium maple syrup. the head is a few inches at first, but relaxes to just a quarter inch of white lace, although its easily fired back up with a shake of the glass. nose is sweeter resinous hops, bits of pine, and sticky dankness like fine bud. American light toasted malt as well, with a touch of alcohol for good measure. flavor is hop heavy, but again the sweeter rather than the bitter. I get some malt sweetness too, but most of it comes from the hops, oily as hell. just enough grain to balance it out. long finish, alcohol is barely present. I could stand a little more carbonation on this, but its not flat, its just personal preference for me. feels a touch heavy in that way, but its more so when its warmer. ice cold its epic, just doesn't drink too fast. fuller bodied, I think a 4 pack is the exactly correct dose on this. one of the pioneering big india pales, still up to snuff."

"O: Good IPA but given it's reviews I guess I am left wondering if I'm missing something as I didn't think it was that special. Maybe it's just not suited to my particular tastes. Still a very enjoyable IPA and would pick it over most IPA's."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I was stoked to find both this and the 120 minute IPA at a local bottle shop based on the reviews I have read, and the 90 minute IPA did not disappoint. The attractive dark color and massive head draw you in and the earthy, malty scent is fitting. Very malty taste that offers sweet and earthy flavors with average hoppyness. The nice full body and creamy texture is a great finish. This one lived up to its reputation and I would recommend it to any IPA fan. Excellent brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Smells like caramel, tropical fruit. Beautiful clear amber color, thick white head and nice lacing. Awesome sweet malt, citrus, tropical fruit flavors. Clean finish. This beer is all about balance and is outstanding in that regard. First tried this in May 2013, now available in southern Illinois. Maybe I got a fresh bottle but way, way better this time around"
""
""
"Overall: I am glad I tried this beer a year ago. Awesome IPA with great taste , balance, smell and no harsh pine sol after taste."

"O: For sure a great beer, and I can see why its considered one of the best. Is this the best beer I’ve had? I think not, but for sure its up there."
""
"Atmosphere is really nice. Dark hue, slight bubbly white head, and a touch of lacing. Nose is a woody, and roasty with plenty of pine and a little spice. Flavor is a well-balanced combination of pine, bitter pecan, a little citrus on a woody roasted malt base. Full and hearty. Overall, this is a great quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden/amber color with a two finger white head. Leaves a ton of lacing. A lot of malt coming through on the nose with a bit of sweetness. Taste is really malty with a lot of citrus and sweetness. For a 90 IBU beer, this comes off not very bitter at all. The bitterness is there but the sweetness covers it up nicely. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied. Pretty thick for an IPA. Carbonation is just above average. Overall, I love this IIPA. Dogfish Head have done it again. They're known for their strange beers and this is no exception. Wow. I need to find 120 minute IPA now."
""
"O- Very glad that I finally tried this brew. I am a big fan of the 60 and 75 minutes and this just out shined both of them. Awesome Double IPA although it could use a little more grapefruit bite, its still a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dogfish 90 min IPA is a great beer has been for a long time. I was amazed at how well balanced it is. The smell is very hoppy and awesome, however the taste is balanced with big malt flavor. Even at 9% abv it is very drinkable and has a nice finish that wants you to go back for more. If you are afraid of IPAs and hops try this beer it will change your mind and taste."

"Overall, a great example of the style. Not for the faint of heart though; it takes a real hophead to fight through the bitterness to enjoy the complex hop flavors but well worth it."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is by far the best IPA I have ever had. The malt balance on the hops is absolutely outstanding. The smell is what you'd expect - piny and citrusy. It just does not come across as a """hop-bomb""" but instead is a seriously enjoyable beer that I keep in the beer fridge at all times"

""
"Overall this stuff is well made but I wouldn't care for it often, just too sweet"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Definitely not just a bigger version of 60 min. More caramel malt and hop dynamic is not present but is compensated by the bump in ABV while keeping an appropriate balance. Perhaps a bit hyped, but a solid IPA. Definitely preferred over 60 min if I had the choice. Malt is showcased more here compared to the 60 min where the hops are the centerpiece."
"I am not huge into over the top hoppy beers, but really enjoyed it. It really mellowed pleasantly after a few minutes, not sure if it was from oxygen or cooling a bit. True to the style. Overall it is a great beer."

"To me Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA is a standard of great beers, not just IPA's or DIPA's.  DFH gets a ton of criticism for their more more esoteric, and sometimes unsuccessful experimental brews, but this one they have nailed.  A perfect balance of astringent hops and luscious malt, it still a classic.  It pours a rich orange with a modest head, but great lacing throughout the drinking period.  The smell does not overwhelm, but is rich with pine, herbal and a light citrus scent.  The taste is what makes this a great one.  Even after having dozens of these over the years, I marvel at the complexities presented."
"O: Very nice beer. Surprisingly sweet and not as hoppy or bitter as you might expect for a double-IPA, but it works very nice overall, along with a unique mouthfeel. I'm not sure that I found it quite as amazing as listed here, but there isn't' much to knock about it either."
""
"O: definitive of the style. very well balanced. hops are the cornerstone. one of my favorite double ipas. one of my favorite beers."

"Pretty disappointed with this one. Not sure why its rated so high on this website. Not only is it """not special"""at all but its kinda a lame beer. Very rarely do I completely dislike a beer but this beer was simply dislikable. Perhaps my expectations were too high but this did not taste like a premium beer."
"Honestly do not get why this is rated so well. I think in 2013 there are plenty of better choices out there!!! Boozy tasting, not complex at all. The best thing about this beer is the look and mouth feel ! The smell is just not anything to be excited about."
""
""
""
"I've had several ipa's and this one takes the cake. Not extremely bitter, but just enough to give it that classic ipa taste. After watching Brewmasters on tv, I was anxious to try this beer and wanted to see if it could live up to the hype. Without a doubt this beer is worth all attention it has recieved!"

"This is one of the best beers I've ever had. I first tried in 2004, and have enjoyed it ever since. You just can't go wrong with a Dogfish Head brew. The 90 Minute IPA is the perfect blend of hops and malt. It gives you a great bite and a smooth finish. Recommended for everyone who wants to drink a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability – Definitely one of the top IPAs I’ve had. Not overly hoppy, not overpowered by citrus, and includes some malt that I really like. Very well done!"
"Overall- Much better than I remember and I may have to return to some of Dogfish Head's other brews. It was starting off as a B+ but I think now it is an A-."
""
"This beer is an outstanding choice for those that feel the Dogfish 75 min IPA was lacking potency."

""
""
""
""
""

"Beautiful clear copper. In the nose, strong caramel flavors, with hop flavors barely noticeable. There is some orange marmalade. Quite full-bodied and sweet. I think the hop flavors have receded after these two months and I feel it's unfair to review it based on such an old bottle. However, this is what was available to me at the store, so others may find it in the same condition. It's still pleasant and balanced, just lacks the fresh hop flavor I was expecting. Probably closer to a Scotch Ale at this point, with its caramel dominance. Drinkability is high, alcohol doesn't stand out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Idk if I got a bad bottle or if DFH just missed the mark, bit I'm disappointed. Not a bad tasting beer b any means which is why I gave it a 3.5, but definitely off style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-this beer is fucking fantastic, for real. I'm not a huge fan of most pale ales, but this taste is almost a mixture between a pale ale and a darker beer. The flavor is robust, but not heavy. I was amazed as to how light it was, yet still having all of that flavor! Great choice.... even on a Monday like this one!"
""
""
""
""
"O-Holy hell. The best IPA I've ever had. Very unique. There aren't typical overpowering notes of citrus and pine in the nose or taste. This is a very unique beer. World-class."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"p.s. My mouth might have been picking up the smells and tastes of the roasted brussel sprouts I had just cooked and eaten. However, I did have bread before I drank it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm just starting to get into the variety of IPAs out there, and I really enjoyed this one. It was a bummer that it was only a four pack, but this one will be my measuring stick until I find something better. This was a fun experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o- Ultimately, no floral/ piny/ citrus notes. Which is the only reason why I hunt for IPAs. Not bad if you want a heavy alcohol beer with limited aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this one, but prefer the west coast citrus hop bombers over these more malty brews. This one reminded me of the Apex I tried recently only better. I get why people love it and it was enjoyed, but maybe just not my go to style."

""
""

""
""
""
""

"Overall a beautiful hop bomb that does not shred the taste buds."
""
""
"Pours amber colored. Some foam rings around. Lighter on top. Can see through. Very faint smell, tough to pick up much. Hops if anything. All hop bitter taste - hard and long lasting. Some balance, but struggles to hold it. Juicy at first. Not sure this is better than the 60."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"One hell of an imperial IPA. Great savory taste, has an extreme hop profile that would satisfy any hop fanatic. Raisins, stone fruit, lemons on the nose. Tastes exquisite, like a dry spring filled with bitter wildflowers. Yeah, I just said that. Drink this now."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The label speaks of ridiculous amounts of English barley and its reflected in the taste and body. More English Pale Ale character but true American DIPA feel this is a really fine beer."

"Bottled 4 pack. Light amber, clear beer has lacy thinnish head. Hoppy and malty nose: wine gums, floral notes, watermelon, strawberry, some citrus. Caramel-topped maltiness with some biscuity toastedness. Intensly malty and thick, still not too sweeet. Light dryfruit notes. Strong but really round bitterness. Amazingly smooth palate, full body. Delicious DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Like I said, better than most, but IMHO, not good enough to be great."

"Once again, super high ratings have the ability to raise expectations.There are clearly many that feel this DIPA is worthy of ultra high marks, and I'm certainly not telling other people what to enjoy or not to enjoy: it only goes to show there are different likes and dislikes for every beer. If your tastes lean toward an aggresively malty DIPA this will be a winner for you, and for those seeking complex citrus hop flavors....meh! Easily the most overrated beer for my taste so far,and a ton of choices in the $10-$11 4 pack selections."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is more of the same as their 60 minute ipa. Very average, odd toasty biscuit malt, bland hop bitterness. I was very excited to try dogfish head beers so I picked some up on a trip to Maryland. Their are much better ipa's from the area to be had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one hell of a DIPA. It's very hoppy but not overpowering and is surprisingly balanced. The sweet caramel and honey flavors in this really sets it apart. Great compliment to the bitter hop flavors and serves to accentuate them rather than fight them. Very balanced and super drinkable DIPA. One of the best balanced all-around versions you can find."
""
"Poured great, decent head. Honey colored beer. Rich look, even richer full body taste. Poured with a nice head. While an awesome full body beer, it did not leave you feeling like you drank something heavy and did not leave you bloated allowing you to enjoy more. At 9% you get a nice little kick. This is a great beer to have with dinner or just to sit down and enjoy a few. I would be hard pressed to think of a better beer. A must for all real beer aficionados. Enjoy! I probably would drink it all the time if it was just a little lower in price but still very reasonably priced for a beer in this category of this magnitude. My first 5!!! Dogfish head Burton Barton is slightly better, but because of the affordability factor when comparing this one puts it right there too."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A lot of people call this a balanced DIPA. I disagree- I think it is unbalanced towards the malt. Not enough hop presence for the strong malts."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: An excellent DIPA. There is always room for improvement, but this beer is one of the best examples of the style. It's no surprise that its one of the most popular DIPAs."
"Overall I was never much of a hops fan but this is really good, easy to drink but still fairly complex flavors"
""
"this beer is definitely overrated and overpriced. it does not worth 8-10 $ per bottle.. Actually 60 minute IPA is better. OK, so I don't know what else to say.. it's not that good. don't waste your money on it really please don't. usually dogfish beers are pretty good, with the exception of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"sampled again 2/1/2014: still Christmas tree-like, but very very smooth. very sweet and malt-y. I think I like it better now, after I have grown a couple of specific taste buds for hoppier brews. I like the taste, I like the abv, I like the 12oz bottle (bombers are really becoming a drag when I want to try something different, ya know?), but it has an almost amateurish taste to it. not a 'refined' sweetness, but a 'forced' sweetness. either way, i'll leave the marks I gave it originally."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O- good beer, not really a dipa but more of a light American Barleywine."
""
""
""
""
""
"Either way, here's what I got. Full malt flavor, check. Hops that satisfy, check. Keeping the car keys tucked away for a bit, check. That being the case, another is certainly not out of the question."

"O- With all the crazy hype for this beer, I have to admit that on my first try I found it to be a bit overwhelming (only slightly though). That being said, this is still a fantastic beer. MUCH MUCH more malty than I had expected it to be. An incredibly drinkable and hard to put down malt forward DIPA. I can't think of anyone besides possibly fanatical IBU crazed hop heads, who wouldn't enjoy this."

"Overall - I really love this beer. Easily my favorite DFH beer to date. I'd love to try one that's less than a month old, because 3 months in, I feel like this one has maybe lost a bit of it's hop sheen. Even if that's the case, this is still a monster of a beer, one that I will be buying again in the near future."
""
""
"Overall, I really like it, but at 9%, it isn't sessionable. I'd stick to the 60 Minute for social situations and this brew as an at-home treat."
""
""
""
"overall an excellent brew"
""
""
""
""
""

"Absolutely one of my favorite beers!! honestly can go good with anything, but you are better off enjoying this beer by itself. it has so much too offer, such great combination between the yeast and malt's making this an outstanding brew. you can put this on my list of top beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I hate to criticize, but I'm disappointed by 90 Minute IPA. It's not a bad beer, and I would recommend it to my BMC-exclusive friends; yet, as a craft beer geek, I'm not exactly impressed by the beer's characteristics. I would try it again, but I would not pay the $11 for a four pack again."

"The texture is crisp with a thickness to it. Moderate carbonation."
""
""
""
""

"o/a- Not all its cracked up to be IMHO but pretty good. Definitely packs a punch at 9% abv and you can hardly detect the alcohol. Surprisingly malt-forward but this bottle is nearly 2 months old, and was stored at room temp for who knows how long. Would love to get some fresh as I suspect it would be better, but it's hard to come by in my area."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - This is a diamond in the rough, this beer is above and beyond most beers I have had the pleasure of tasting. Hardcore hop-heads expecting IBU abuse factor may find this beer overrated, but I find the complexity more than welcome on my palate."

"Finally tasted this beer. BIG letdown considering it was selling for $10 for a four pack. I could barely taste the hops. Way too malty. I dont get what the big deal is considering it was said to be the best beer in the US. At least it was strong though. I will stick with my Skulpin or Pliney."

"O: After DFH stopped distributing to WI a couple years back it sucked, but with so many awesome breweries out there i didn't think it was a big deal. I picked up a pack of 90 minuite in IL when passing through and it was like reuniting with an old friend. Match it with some spicy wings.. good lawd!"

"O: I have fond memories of this beer because it’s the one that got me into IPAs. That said, it’s the bridge between the former light lager types and the heavier styles, for which it might be unfairly maligned, but to a mature palate, it starts to lack when compared with the menagerie of options out there. It’s a stalwart and good in a pinch, though."

"Snifter pour, golden reddish color with a thin head. Some lacing. Perhaps I'm sick, but the smell is subtle and hoppy. Smooth and drinkable with a citrusy/biting aftertaste. Pleasantly surprised. Worthy of enjoying a few, but wouldn't be a first choice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, this beer is a little more syrupy/sweeter than I like my IPA's to be, but the well-balanced flavor and aromas make a great beer in a class of it's own (in my head)."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is the first time I've had the 90 minute. I would say that the hops are more present in the 60 minute but that isn't to say that the 90 minute doesn't have it's fair share. The malt is way more pronounced in this beer. Very drinkable at 9.0% and I can see why this is so highly rated. Would definitely buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Seems slightly confused from the style, or perhaps I've been drinking too much Lagunitas. I tend to like a slightly lighter, tropical body on my favorite IPA's. Still a classic though. Nothing to complain about; all good."

"However, the hop exuberance was very suited to other aspects of the beer. The taste was not dry, and the vigorous hoppy character captures your taste buds really fast. With the kind of food I had (Mexican-style and, later, a Gorgonzola cheese), it was perfect. Excellent tasting."

"Poured this Imperial IPA from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This IIPA poured a hazy golden color, produced a nice thick white head, retention was great, and it left good amount of lace on the glass. The Aroma of the ale consisted of fresh pine needles, apples and herbal notes. Full bodied, this IIPA has a great malted grain base, ample amount of oily, piney hop flavor, there are some notes of fresh pressed apple juice. The mouthfeel of this IIPA is very smooth and silky... The bitter hop flavor sticks from start to finish. One of my favorite IPA's- Can't wait to sample some of Dogfish's other IPA's."
""
""
"If it didn't have a 9% abv this would be my session brew. (also if Dogfish Head would distribute to Indiana) Absolutely a perfect IPA in all facets. It doesn't have the bite that some desire. (usually me as well) However, it's incredibly smooth and full of flavor. An impeccable combination from Dogfish Head! Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dog Fish Head makes a """Top 3""" IPA along with Stone and Racer 5 in my book. This beer will never disappoint and will make a hop head out of you if you're not careful. I wish it was more accesible; that would be my only complaint. It delivers the perfect combination of hops to rich flavor that one could ask for."

"What can I add that 6,213 people haven't already said? First there is the underground hype, then the commercial success. Then there is the backlash to the hype, and then the backlash to the backlash. This beer has gone from one of the most under-rated in the world, to one of the most over-rated, and has now settled in nicely to where it should have always been: a phenomenally drinkable, flavorful, and distinctly aromatic beer that is palatable for even the most novice IPA lovers. Way back in the day I fell in love with Imperials once the flashy, sexy 90-minute hit my virgin lips. Sure, I've had other love affairs with plenty of other DIPAs since then, and I have 90 less and less frequently, but don't let anybody tell you differently: the thrill is still there everytime I crack a new one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"loved this brew, like i said its an upgraded version of the 60 min. i could have this on any long summer day, but definitely not as easy drinking as the 60 min"
""
"Overall: This is a very solid IPA. Seeing that it's classified as a double IPA, I can't help but think that this is definitely a more malty and less bitter, but really delicious brew. Dogfish Head did a great job with this one and I can definitely see myself picking up more of this in the future. Great job guys!"

"Not a bad beer at all, but I prefer my Imperial IPAs to be more aggressive and less malty. If you like IPAs though give this a shot."

"Pours a hazy semi clear, reddish gold in color with one finger white head that leaves lace and bubbles. Aromas of resin, grapefruit and fresh cut wood. Surprisingly balanced, malt sweetness, fruity citrus flavors. Raisin. Alcohol notes, winey; Hops show through more in the aftertaste. Great body, well carbonated. Well crafted flavorful brew for sure. Very enjoyable."

"Appearance has a light amber color supporting a steady fluffy head leaving nice lace. Aroma of sweet malt, citrus and a little piney. Taste has that nice sweet grapefruit flavor thats rich malty backbone, but nicely balanced with the amount of hops they throw in. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. A very nice Imperial with more complexity than most."

I have experimented with many DIPA since the last time I had a 90 minute, this is a really great hoppy, yet balanced DIPA, the category has those that wreck the palette and those that are drinkable yet clearly hopped up, this is in the not palette wrecking category. The craftsmanship in the Dogfish Head beers is so apparent and really welcomed with this gem"

"-Overall 4.5: Just a solid all-around brew that is something more than an IPA. The extra boil and hopping has created something that Dr. Frankenstein strove for: an almost perfect creation. While ol' Frankie was rewarded with grunts and angry gesturing, the geniuses at Dogfish Head were rewarded with this amazing brew. Everything is so smooth and balanced...totally sessionable and the 9% ABV is completely unnoticeable. Amazing and worth buying and enjoying again and again."

"O - I find this quite drinkable considering the 9% ABV. I admit to preferring the standard IPA's to the Imperials - I prefer a more citrusy flavor than the malt that is present in this one. For DFH - I prefer the 60 Minute IPA"

"O: A very solid offering from Dogfish Head. Extremely well balanced and very easy to drink for a beer with 9% ABV. It's no Burton Baton, but I'll gladly drink one anytime I get the opportunity."

"This beer pours a hazy apricot color with a one finger off white head, some retention, and very elaborate lacing. The smell is citrus, biscuit, grass, and strangely enough a sort of rubbery smell I can't quite pin down. The taste is very sweet upfront with powerful malt. The hops hit on the finish, but the malts seem to be a little more powerful. There is a small alcohol warmth to the finish as well. Mouthfeel is decent with some carbonation and without too much bitterness in the aftertaste. This one is good enough with an awesome taste, but I think given this one or the 60 minute IPA, I might actually like the 60 minute better."

"O: I am really disappointed and it is not a beer that I would have again. I bought a 4- pack because it had a very good BA rating. Oh well. It is too sweet and there is not enough hoppiness to it. The alcohol taste is too prevalent. It was brewed 5 1/2 months ago. This beer is overrated."

""

"A masterpiece. Surprisingly smooth for it's kick, an impeccable blend of bitter with a tinge of sweetness and full flavor, worthy of sipping slowly. If you're looking to down a few, this may not be for you, as it is a beer to be savored slowly, appreciating the richness. it's pretty damn obvious if i could genuflect and ask for a beer's hand in marriage, this would be THE ONE."

"Bottled 08/03/2012, poured into a snifter. About two fingers of very light tan creamy head, with fluffy clouds clinging to the inside of the glass as head fades. Beautiful hazy orange color. Aromas of malt and spice are not immediately noticeable, however, but come through as 90 minute sits for a bit. Light caramel and a bready smell are also present. All aromas become more prominent and enjoyable as I drink the beer. Taste is very balanced, with spices, sweetness, hops and malt all noticeable, no single characteristic dominates. Dry on the end, with spice aftertaste perfect for this early November weather. Perhaps a bit of citrus, orange/grapefruit, on the end as well. Mouthfeel is balanced, very nicely, with medium carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall this is a wonderful beer. Have not had it since last March or so, but recall fond memories of finishing off a case of 90 minute over the holidays last year with my brother and father. Cheers."

"O: Not sure I'd consider this a DIPA although its quite bitter. Maybe an Imperial Amber or Barleywine? The hop aroma is there, and the bitterness is there, but the hop flavor is lacking, could use more late boil hops. Despite its """flaws""" its still quite tastey and well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o- This beer is not as good as I remember. I think it could be due to the lack of freshness. Hoppy beers just usually can't stand up to the aging. Or maybe my palate has just changed. I also prefer a good bit of alcohol taste on big beers, which this did not really have until near its finish for me. Regardless, still one of my favorite beers, and favorite IPAs of course. Has a good bit of sweetness and a strong malt backbone to balance, but the hops are still able to stand out (although not as much as I remember)."
"O – I make no bones about the 90 min IPA—it is one of my favorite beers. I love everything about this beer from head to toe and I think that it is just so well orchestrated and such a treat to imbibe. Thank you DFH for knocking this one out of the park."
""
""
"Overall: One of the best balanced IPA's I've had. So much fruit action along with the sweet malt backbone makes this a fantastic introduction to the style."

""

"Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA is a delicious Double IPA that offers a unique, memorable flavor profile. Unfortunately, it also suffers to some extent from a lack of balance."
"Overall, a very delicious beer that I can drink at any point of the year. One of my most favorite from Dogfish Head"
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite DIPAs! It has a strong Hoppy flavor, yet it is not too bitter as it has 90 IBUs. The flavors are also very warm and full with a strong kick of barley. It has a very nice bronze color to it, and is not that dark. However, it feels thicker than it looks. The malt flavors are also apparent. A good Autumn beer, although I can drink it any day of the year."
"overall - Highly reccomended."

"O: Sort of like their 60 minute IPA, I feel like their focus is too much on malts and not on hops. Neither the 60 or 90 minute are balanced properly. I would never believe this was 90 IBUs because it is so sweet. It makes them unique IPAs, but they seem a bit sickening to drink more than one or two in a sitting. The booziness was a bit offputting as well when there are plenty of other IIPAs that aren't that way."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is probably my favorite beer being produced right now. It falls right in my wheelhouse, since I am a fan of highly dark and malty beers that are medium hoppy and have a """bracing""" level of ABV. It's easy to drink but not a guzzling beer by any means. It just happens to fall in that hard-to-reach spot that I personally like... where the beer has body and boldness without turning into a super bitter hop-fest. Only caveat is that it's on the edge of being too strong to be """refreshing", so like I say... don't guzzle. Sip."
"O- a great IPA! certainly one of the best I've had. I can't get this in Indiana any longer, so it's a real treat when I pick them up while out of town. One or two of these a night and I am set..."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy pale golden color with a thin white head that disappears rather quickly. Aroma is of fruit, cherries and plums, yeast and citrus. Taste follows the aroma well, dark cherries and plums with a strong alcoholic characteristic. Well balanced with a nice malty, caramel, sweetness that fades to an earthy and citrus hop bitterness in the finish. Medium carbonation and a full body. The mouthfeel is pleasant, rich and thick. Overall a very nice beer for a special occasion, I don't think I could down these for just any reason. Very good beer to the style."
""
""
"Taste/feel: Has to be the most interesting IPA I've had up to this point. It's certainly loaded with hops, but it also has -- as the bottle puts it -- a ridiculous amount of barley. I absolutely love it. It's hop heavy up front and in the smell, but the malts come through on the finish. I love it. There's also a bit of warmth as well, making this a perfect Autumn beer. The feel of this one bothers me a tad, though. The whole beer itself is legendary, but I almost feel this beer to be a bit too syrupy to have more than one in a sitting. Regardless of all of that, 90 Minute IPA is an absolute must try. It may be $3 a bottle, but trust me -- there is a reason."
""
""
""

"Overall: The absolute easiest DIPA I've had to date. This thing just goes down dangerously smooth and fast that its mind blowing. I have not been blown away, knock your socks off by a beer lately but this one has definitely done so!"
"A truly wonderful beer. One that makes me happy I came over 'from the dark side' of mass-produced shareholder company beers. Dogfish Head is one of the most celebrated micro brewers in America, and this beer is an example why."

"Overall - If you're a hophead or a fan of IPAs in general, this beer was made specifically for you. It's full of rich flavor and incredibly easy to drink. Let's hope Dogfish Head can expand their reach to all 50 states, because beer this good should be available to all."

"Poured a lovely burnt orange color into glass. Smells of grapefruit, piney, lemony, and a little sweetness. Taste is a bit sweet with hop to start, progressively getting a bit more bitter through the end. Mouthfeel has slight warming with the alcohol content, nicely carbonated but has a syrup feel a bit also. I wasn't a huge IPA fan at the time of tasting but have grown to love them. Definitely a beer I'd pick up again."

"Cheers!"

"The mouth feel is thick, but goes down too easily. You need to watch yourself with this beer, just amazing all around."

"The citrus side of the beer seems to shine a bit more on the tongue. Sweet malts keep the bitterness in check. All the dense hop notes pop without getting blurred into bitterness. Nice. Super smooth as far as DIPA's go. I wish this would see MN distro."
""
"One of the best """easy-to-find-year-round""" DIPAs. Not only is it amazingly balanced and great tasting, it is easy to drink for a big 9%-er. Truly a great beer for the availability and price. An excellent """beginner""" DIPA."
"O: Malt-heavy IPAs aren’t my favorite, but this has one of the best examples of how the hop and malt profiles can work together to create a unique experience. An easily recognizable beer that I occasionally crave."

"decide to wait a bit between the two ipa's from the mix six. poured out from the bottle into a pint glass. not a bad aroma bit strong in alcohol and a bit of malt. for some reason i thought this beer would only be slightly different from the 60 minute and boy i am glad i was wrong ."
"On tap at the Dogfish Head Restaurant BB on randle. The randle gives this an unfair advantage on this tasting. None-the-less this is a quality beer. Color is a deep brown with nice head and good lacing. Cascade hops in the randle - exteremely floral. Sweet taste - caramel, molasses, floral hops. This a great beer."

"This is one of my absolute favorite beers of all time! I'd have to say I even love it more than my original favorite the sixty minute. It is strong, yet retains a very unique balance of flavors within. I just wish they would sell it in more than four packs here in Pennsylvania."

"Why would I bother to review this beer? It's a classic, and everybody has had it. I feel obligated to weigh in on the amazing coffee flavor that the continuos hopping achieves. Look for it the next time you have a 60 or 90 min. Dogfish. The 90 is more complex, but the booziness makes it a little harder to enjoy than the 60. This is a complex and impressive beer, and that's why it is a classic."

"O - I love this beer so much because it simply stands out from your stereotypical Imperial IPA. DFH does a magnificent job when it comes to collaborating various ingredients and flavors, making very complex, yet different beers, while still maintaining the particular style of each beer (if that makes sense). If only their beers were less expensive, I would happily drink them everyday."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 6/25/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear golden orange color with a nice 2 finger dense cream colored head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Some nice foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, orange rind, herbal, floral, pine, caramel, biscuit, mango, peach, toast, and earthiness. Very nice and well balanced aromas with good strength and complexity. Taste of big grapefruit, orange zest, pine, herbal, floral, caramel, toast, biscuit, peach, mango, and earthy spiciness. Good amount of smooth and spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, caramel, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, pine, peach, mango, and light herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic balance of pronounced caramel and toasty malt sweetness, with smoothly bitter hop flavors; very good flavor complexity and balance as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a pretty creamy, slick, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA. The English two row adds a nice unique dimension to the flavor profile; and it has a very smooth balance of hoppiness with the malt profile. Highly enjoyable, and I am glad I was able to get this really fresh for this re-review after not having had this one for a couple years."
""
""
""
"O - This is a far better balanced IPA experience than the vast majority of DIPAs out there. Manages to deliver a ton of hop flavor, without being the cloyingly bitter hop bomb that most DIPAs seem to be. This is right at the top of the list, as it manages to be a complex, full-bodied ale while still having a ton of hop flavor. It's nice to have a DIPA that realizes there should be more to a beer than just bitterness. Very well done, this is a DIPA to drink over, and over, and over again."

"Review from 9/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours an medium orange amber. Aroma of fresh hops and malt, pleasant. Miniscule head, but leaves light lacing. Nice medium bodied with malt. caramel and hops start and middle. Fresh hoppy finish. Well balanced, tasty and integrated. A very well made IPA with attention to the malt, which I appreciate."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"Big head and a decent amount of lace. Clear golden amber in color. Smell is citrusy with an overlay of orange and light pine. Taste is well balanced with a healthy malt core. quickly followed by an powerful wave of hops. Caramel sweetness and hunks of lightly toasted barley bread. A spread of butter. Finish is smooth and dry with a oily hops lingering . Feel is somewhat thick and chewy with a velvety smooth carbonation. A great beer for savoring and loving life ."
""
"Not much that needs to be said about this one. I found this one to be remarkably smooth for an IIPA. The deep golden body and frothy white head look nice and the fruity, hoppy blast deliver as an IIPA should, but it's that silky smooth sip that makes this one extra nice. You're never going to pucker despite the high IBU. Great beer!"

"O: The head and lacing on this beer was phenomenal. The aroma was pretty good, and I really liked the flavor, but the mouthfeel was what really blew me away - so silky smooth and slightly warm (perfect). Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA beat Great Lakes Lake Erie Monster by just a bit."
""
""
""
"O: A great beer! I had high expectations on this one and it really delivered. I was expecting a bit more from the smell but everything else was far better than I expected. I would love to lay my hands on this one again."

"This is not the best IPA I've ever had, but it's damn good nontheless. Hits you like ton of bricks and never lets go. If you do not like bitter, hoppy beers, DO NOT EVER TRY THIS!"
"O – This is a terrific DIPA and hands-down my favorite beer from DFH. It’s great across the board, but the thing that impresses me the most is how balanced the beer is between the sweet malt and bitter hops while still being bitter enough to please the biggest hop heads. Extremely drinkable. The fact that it’s widely available and relatively cheap is just icing on the cake. Great beer from DFH."

"This is the beer that introduced me to a world i never knew (craft beer as a whole) ever since I, for no reason other than curiosity (well maybe it was the Esquire review on the colorful 4-pack), purchased some one day around 4 years ago. Every time I've poured this (it's been many an occasion now) it's been a brief head that settles quickly, with a thin lacing. The first time i tried this I didn't like it I thought. Yet I was still somehow intrigued by it...Long story short, it turned out it was because I had no prior beer experience other than low abv. mass-made swill from my college years. The smell (due to its subtlety) was never what did it for me with this now go-to DIPA. A burnt malty grapefruit sensation upon tasting this. Boozy then smoothed out by a terrific malt backbone. Although a heavy hitter, I could easily have 2 in a row and they both go down ever so smoothly due to the mouthfeel alone. While my taste buds easily prefer several others of this style, this one will always be in regular rotation because it's just unique. There is a caramel aspect to it, syrupy, not as outright hoppy as what I prefer. But in the end it's got it's own complex character I seem to revisit with regularity."
""
""
"The appearance is a amber-red body with plentiful carbonation below a sizable white head. Good retention. The smell is strongly fruity with hops. It's a strong beer, lots of hops but it goes down fairly easy. You can tell it's a hard hitter in the alcohol department but it hides the booziness well. Mouthfeel is smooth if a little overwhelming. Certainly lives up to its reputation."
"Rich amber with light creamy 1 finger head that disappeared fairly quickly, leaving only minimal lacing. The aroma is sharp and piney - but in the best possible way, implying good things ahead. Alcohol is also evident in the smell. Mouthfeel is oh so smooth, slightly carbonated, with citrus, malt, and hop balance that puts it into the category of excellent imperial ipa's. One if my favorite ipa's with a lingering bitterness that reminds you how good it is."

"A superb beer! I could as easilly drink this in the middle of winter as now in the heat of summer."
"Taste is where this beer shines, I could possibly list off 20 tastes and still be missing quite a few. But again hints of floral, honey, and whip cream, slight touch of banana, and fresh strawberries. Good bit of barely grains. The Mouthfeel is so incredibly Rich and creamy."

"Pours dark orange with a nice foamy head that slowly dissipates and leaves nice lacing on the sides of the glass. Smells like sweet caramel and citrus. The taste follows my expectation from the smell. A nice mix of malty sweetness and bitter hops. Definitely more malty than most DIPAs. Somewhat thick feel and just the right amount of carbonation. Love it. One of my favorite beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall--A classic. Not the hop bomb I was expecting but plenty of hops and exceedingly well done."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Quite an astonishingly unique brew. I know it's labeled as a DIPA, but try to be open minded when enjoying this beer. Dogfish Head uses """labels""" like titles for a book. A few little words to describe an entire story, so sit back and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Orangish-copper in appearance with little head but some nice lacing anyway. There is a distinct fresh hop nose. This offering has a slightly sweet malt flavor upfront followed by a blast of hop bitterness that lingers long into the finish. This is a spectacular beer - the perfect combination of malt and strong hop flavors. My personal #1 DIPA - the only question is: do I like the bottled or on-tap version best."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, Dogfish 90 is definitely in my top 10 even though i'm a dedicated West Coast hophead. The hops are really bright and playful but it really is the malt bill that I think makes this beer stand out."
""
""
""
"M: The syrupiness leaves me with a tacky feel that is a little unpleasant, and I can also really feel the booze on my tongue and down my throat (which is somewhat to be expected at 9%, and I really don't mind it all that much). Granted, I'd rather have a malty caramel syrup taste to balance it out than just have bitter hops all the way through. That said, I like stouts, nutty brown ales, and other less hop-forward beers more than I like IPAs."

"Served from bottle to pint glass. Appearance is a nice burnt orange with light lacing. Smell is not as big as I expected. Fruity with piney aroma. Taste is a bit of a disappointment but still a solid DIPA. Mouthfeel is average as well. Not going to seek this out again but course I woudn't turn it down either."

"A dark copper with a small white head and fair lacing. Surprisingly sweet aroma, I'd almost think this was a red or even amber based on it; largely toffee and bread. Not much of any hop presence it seems. Taste almost has some butterscotch flavor to it, some breadiness, some molassess, with some mild bitterness in the finish.Medium body to this, slight activity. Overall. not quite what i was expecting. I felt this was in between an imperial amber and an imperial pale ale to be honest. Thought it was alright at best."

"Overall - This is my first beer from Dogfish Head, and color me impressed. The flavor profile incorporates such a large array of competing flavors but they're balanced and nothing predominates to the detriment of other flavors. This combines the complexity of some of my favorite Belgian Trappist ales with the bigness and boldness of one of my favorite American styles, and does it stunningly. Well done, Dogfish Head."
""
""
""
"O: Tons of malts, tons of hops and the best part is they act as complimentary domains. They never try to fight for attention, instead blend together for one of the nation's best IPAs. Huge fan. I have not had this or a 60 minute in about a year, I wanted to test my pallet and the beer still holds up:)"

"I'm very thankful I bought one bottle of this for a little over $2. I was only able to stomach half before pouring the devil necter down the drain. As I watched it fall into the depths of hell, I noticed the dark color and thick consistency not unsimilar to that of a cough syrup. Truly symbolic for the evil that this over rated beer brings."
""
"Have to say, after hearing so much about this beer I was not at all disappointed. Would have got a full 5 on the overall score had it not been for the price. There are still several IPA's that are nearly as good but WAY cheaper. Still, a great beer for a celebration!"

"O: For a 9.0% ABV and 90 IBU beer, I couldn't tell it was a 9.0% ABV and 90 IBU beer, because of the balanced nature of this beer. The great overall flavor of light citrus & floral notes, balanced with a strong, but not overpowering hops profile, leads to a great IPA to share with friends."

"Thanks are due to EgadBananas for providing this bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Pours light clear amber with a tall, eggshell colored head. Plenty of tiny bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The head retains very well, dissipating slowly and leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. There are aromas of piney hops, citrusy hops, and sweet malts. It smells a little earthy as well. Hops dominate the flavor. All the hop flavors blend together very well with the sweet malts. It starts bitter and there's caramel sweetness from the malts. The sweet bitter aftertaste lingers, but it is mild. I do not notice the alcohol in the flavor. The body is medium with some carbonation. The drinkability is very high for such a big beer. Overall, this is an excellent beer. People wanting to try a DIPA should try this beer."

"90 Minute is the DIPA that really got me hooked on the style. Great stuff, sadly becoming harder and harder to find in my area. I can think of quite a few DIPAs that I like better than 90, but this is definitely a must try."

"Overall, I really like this DFH offering. If I were to keep one IPA/DIPA in the fridge for constant consumption, this might be it. I'd be curious to have one a little fresher. In the end, this gets me excited for the 120's I have in the cellar."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Mouthfeel is nice- medium bodied with soft, light carbonation, a little resin and a little booze warming on the way down. A nice brew, but doesn't taste like what I want from a DIPA; a shitload of hops."

"Over all - What a wonderful beer incredible bitterness but almost as sweet as it is bitter . Almost a perfect blend . At a abv of 9 % . One wonders were the fuck is the 9% . I love this beer its insanely hoppy and sweet the only beer to best it in a double or triple ipa category is its bigger brother 120 Minute ipa. One most say the 90 minute is Almost perfect and 120 Minute is perfection."
""
""
"O: Good beer -- not dominated by citrus or pine. A bit boozy, but quality nonetheless. Nice job of emphasizing the floral aspects of the beer. Good finish. Better than the 60 minute, but I would like to have seen more risks taken with the brew."
"O: This is in the top tier of IPA's. A very American style IPA with the strong malt backbone and a big hops taste. The touch of alcohal heat just adds to the audacity of this beer, and together the hops and heat privide a pleasing and bold bite the really works well for this beer."
""
""
""
"O: The higher ABV in this beer is pretty well hidden. This beer is enjoyable but is not as good as some others in the style (at least in my humble opinion - though I perhaps like a different combination of hop flavors). This is a sipping beer rather than a session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep amber color with a fluffy white head that persists for a while. Smells of hops, lots of pine and citrus with a solid bready and caramel base to round things out. Taste is pleasingly bitter with lots of bitter citrus and pine atop a solid caramel malt base. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick resinous mouthfeel. Nice IPA, a bit on the malty side, but very nice going down the gullet."

"90 Minute Imperial IPA - The bottle says: “What you have here is an Imperial India Pale Ale featuring a single, constant 90-minute hop addition. It’s balanced by a ridiculous amount of English Two-row Barley. Then we dry-hop it in every tank.”"
"this thing pours a golden amber with a slightly off white head. the lacing solind but not a perfect ring. the smell is interesting . it has a more malty note than anything. the taste follows the smell. it has a bready taste to with a considerable alcohol taste at the end of it. the hops a very subdued by the malt. i could use a little more disguising of the alcohol. overall this is pretty good. i'm glad to have had it. bottle date 4/16/12."

"I not sure if its me or do all dogfish almost taste alike except for the ABV, still it is a well rounded IPA, more malt taste and bitter, I have had other one time cask IPA's from dogfish that where outstanding and wish that i can have one of those brews again, still will have the 90 in my frig for the future."

"Tons of flavors on the first sip. Loads of hops, malt, and alcohol. Alcohol is heavier than I remember, and a little off-putting early on. Of course, it starts to blend in better with later sips. Hops dominate the entry and finish, with citrus flavors at entry and a lot of vegetal bitterness left in the aftertaste on the back of the tongue. Mid-palate is pretty sweet, with a heavy load of malt. It's interesting how the flavors start off similar to many other citrusy IPAs, but then kick into another gear and make this a very distinctive beer."

"O: every bit as good as the 120 minute IPA - maybe a touch better b/c its not as extreme? - and not as pricey - would love to do a side-by-side tasting of the 60, 90, and 120 minute IPA by these guys - just to really explore the differences. Great beer."

""

"O: One of my favorite DIPA's, but I think this bottle is a bit past its prime. I remember my others being hoppier, but overall you can't go wrong with this brew."
""
""
""

"O - Very good beer, the alcohol and sweetness of the malt is the only thing that I would alter slightly, but that is me being a harsh critic. Go buy one and enjoy :D."

""

""
""
""

"Pours a dark golden amber with a fluffy two and half finger clean white head. Fantastic retention and beautiful lacing. The smell is dominated by earthy, grassy, and floral hops and a bit of fruit with citrus accents. Floral hops first greet the tastebuds, transitioning to sweet malt backbone and finishing with a slight grassy bitterness. The mouthfeel is exceptional an abudant malt backbone, smooth and very creamy. 90 Minute IPA is a modern American beer classic and an exceptional brew."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a nice caramel color with a 1.5 finger head that leaves great lacing. Has a real nice floral and slight malty aroma which is very pleasant. Tastes of very sweet malt with heavy hops with sight citrus taste. It is very hoppy yet has balance. This light to medium bodied beer has great carbonation and a great finish. Overall, an extremely good beer and another great beer from Dogfish Head."

"Overall just a really great brew. For an IPA it had the perfect amount of bitterness combined with other flavors."
""
"O: I was actually surprised by how good this was. I love how the herbs and funky hops actually don't diminish the fresh/clean sensation of the beer. Totally satisfying IPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer has the perfect interplay between hops and malt in the nose. It looks, and feels great, but the taste is a little bit of a letdown for me though."
"O: This is a very good beer that stops just short of being truly excellent. Still, for a DIPA that's relatively routinely available it's solid. Nice hoppiness with the flavors well-integrated, and complex enough to keep the palate entertained for the whole pint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""

"O This bottle is almost 4 months old, need to try a fresh one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is truly one of the top three, if not the best IPA I've ever had. This is not even my favourite type of beer by any means, but Dogfish Head have managed to produce a truly exceptional brew. I'm reviewing my fifth bottle of the beer, and I've thoroughly enjoyed each one of them. Can't wait to try out the 120min if I can get my hands on it!"

"O- This was one of the first beer I bought after I turned 21, years ago, and it was a good beer then and is a decent beer now. Nice strong IIPA that is deserving of its reputation, though probably not the """best""" as they advertise on the case."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice looking DIPA. Low carb and small head. More pine than others, and def balanced. Powdery sweet malt, and a slight dryness from somewhere. Way more balance than I was expecting. Reminds me Great Divide Hercules, but more hops. The hops lean toward pine, but flashes toward citrus. Pine needles take over the grapefruit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a amber/orangish color with a 2 inch size white color head that lasts a while. Provides nice lacing on the glass. Piny hops are the most prominent smell with a good malty aroma as well. Taste is nicely balanced with malt sweetness and fruits followed by hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Wow, what a beer. Huge flavor, beautiful smell, well rounded for such a powerhouse. Aging seems to have taken the front-forward bitter hop characteristics and pushed them towards the back, while accentuating the sweet and floral qualities. An outstanding DIPA."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think I had some bad bottles in my 4 pack. (This is a review of the last of the bunch.) I'm not positive, but whatever. Either way, this is a good DIPA. Maybe it's just grown on me. I may buy it again at some point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A straight and to the point double. Although I've never had it on tap, it's said to be most promising to consume this way. Cheers!"

"O - This DIPA is the real deal and packs a pretty intense aroma and flavor. While the hop presence is pretty strong, there's a good bit of caramel and toffee malts, as well as an equally strong wave of bitterness to bring excellent balance. Certainly a top tier DIPA for me, 90 Minute is a brew that's really unlike any other and one that I look forward to having time and time again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good beer -- not dominated by citrus or pine. A bit boozy, but quality nonetheless. Nice job of emphasizing the floral aspects of the beer. Good finish. Better than average, but I would like to have seen more risks taken with the brew."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This again is what separates the good IPAs from the great IPAs. It has a thickness to the beer that lets the flavor stick around and lets you remember the beer that you are drinking."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I buy every four-pack I can get my hands on. This is Dogfish's finest product. I would take one of these over a case of the 120 min, which is a decent brew but cant touch the taste and dedication to the IPA style i find in the 90. Wish I could take some to sea with me next time I go."
"Has a strong aroma of hops that has citrus and grapefruit scents lingering in the background. It is amber/oragne colored with a glaze of a white head. Very smooth, distributing a hearty taste of hops with a mild grapefruit taste creeping in. The palate is enticed with a nice flirtation between sweetness and bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I've only begun to get wet my appetite with Dogfish Head and taking the journey from 60 minute to 90 minute is a nice elevation. I can't wait to try the 120 (it is sitting in my fridge, but I'm waiting for the right moment). DFH isn't readily available in Kent County so I have to drive a few towns over to get this brew. It is well worth it. This is by far one of the best crafted beers in this category. Try this beer and you wont be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
"I used to treat myself to a 60 minute IPA every once in a while. Today I decided to go with the 90 minute. Well, I made a great choice. It was not as hoppy as I would have expected, but the flavors of citrus, floral and bitter are perfectly melded in this fine beer. This is the imperial I will judge all others by."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I tend to take this beer for granted because of its availability, but it is truly a great one. This is an extremely balanced DIPA with great drinkability. It may not be rare or expensive, but that doesn't mean it isn't an exceptional beer. This tasting reaffirmed my love for 90 minute and I will not look past this one on the shelves as I had been doing lately."
""
""
""
""
"O - Fantastic and I would agree that it is one of the best IPA in the US as advertised. I prefer them a little hoppier but this is my favorite among those not uber hopped."
"Was i the only one who thought that the alcohol was a tad to prominent in the beer? I agree with most reviewers regarding the body, color, and smell, but the taste was a little too alcohol laden. I'm obsessed with IPA's and this beer was delicious, but if your in the mood for a relaxed session beer i might recommend the Sierra Nevada Torpedo. So tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorites from Dogfish Head. It's a very well balanced beer and I love the fact that it's so easy to find and is always available unlike some of my other favorites."

"Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA: Outstanding achievement in the IPA world. I had resisted trying this brew due to the price, but finally caved in when I had to bring some beer over to a friend who is fond of IPA’s. Great hoppy aroma comes off of this brew, which I find separates the great IPA’s from the good. Rather than your first sip starting out malty with a hop finish, the 90 minute blasts you with hops from the word go. There are lots of hop tones, such as grapefruit and peach, and a decent amount of bitter coming through, but it works well. The highlight of this beer comes at about half glass when your tongue has become accustomed to the assault of hops, complex malt flavors start to come through. This Dogfish Head product is not your every day IPA, but a fantastic special occasion statement brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a beer with a WOW factor! I had tried it on tap and today I had my first bottle; here’s my first impression: Poured into an oversize wine cup it has a rich red color and developed a half inch head, the lacing is outstanding; sniffed and the aroma of hops hits my nose and tickle my palate. First sip; I can taste the hops but the aftertaste of a well-balanced malt and hops duo. I can drink this all day long; but I wouldn’t it packs 9% ABV….I am doing my part, how about you? DRINK BEER and support your local brewery. HOG"

"O: Despite its slightly off-putting texture this is a delicious and complex ipa and should definitely be experienced by any hop advocate"
""
""
""
""
"A very manly beer, but one of the best of the type I’ve had. I think Dogfish Head is slightly overrated, but this is one that lived up to the hype."
"Warming, rich and smooth. Full-bodied with light effervescence. This is amazing. One of the best IPAs I've ever been lucky enough to drink. BTW: I'm not a hop fan and tend to shy away from IPAs in general."
""

""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is one of my favorite beers to date now!"
"Overall: I absolutely love this beer. By far one of my favorites. The hops and malt balances perfectly, which was interesting to me for a DIPA with 90 IBU's. Will stay in my rotation for a while."

"O - No need to rush to the finish on this one. Probably a good idea to savor at 9%. Any fans of IPAs looking for a solid two beer buzz need look no further. Recommended."
"O: well-made, rich, and flavourful. The 9% alcohol makes for a pretty potent finish but it fits within the style. I'd buy it again but definitely share with a friend .... or two."
""
""
"O- A good strong heavy drinking IPA. Not perfect but very good. I like 60 minute a bit better."

"Dark gold color and formed a nice foamy off white head that held and left some nice circular lace as it slowly subsided. A good deal of carbonation is present. An aroma of hops and a touch of citrus. A flavor of hops with some sweetness present. Also some of the alcohol is present. The sweetness of this one is offset by the presence of the alcohol."
""
""
"Crisp, sharp, mellow floral bitterness, and a aromatic finish."
""
"O - it was definitely a little unexpected. A pretty unique IPA in my opinion. I can't seem to get around the slight spice. It was unexpected but definitely not unwelcome. Definitely a good IPA."
""
"see you on the next one."

""
""
""

"O- Solid, Solid, Solid....this is one of my go too everyday IPA's for a reason."

""
""
""
""

"What you have here is an excellent beer. I really enjoy the malt hops balance. If something is called """imperial""" I want it to have a bolder and richer taste than a standard IPA. This one fits the description."
""
""
""
"O- I remember buying this for the first time five years ago. I loved it! It was the first imperial IPA I ever had and surely in the top five BEST I have ever had. I love it because it's available year round and can be found just about anywhere. This beer looks great, it's fragrant, tasty, well balanced and has a great mouthfeel. DFH nails each category here with this one. I'm glad I finally reviewed this as sometimes when I drink this it tastes really really good and tonight is one of those times. If you haven't tried this yet, then you shouldn't even be on this site. Get out there and pick up a four pack right this minute!"

"Overall a really good ipa one of my favourites."
""
""
"O: I've had this beer about 10 times now, and every time I hate it. I want to like this beer because everyone seems to love it, but it always tastes like a malty mess. I would like to try this like 5 days fresh to see if the hops are evident there, but so far, no good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Double IPAs are probably my favorite style of beer, so I tend to be more picky than most when it comes to beers of this style. With that in mind I’d say overall, this is a pretty good brew but not much better than average for the style. I hadn’t had this beer in a few years and its very different than I remember (I remembered it as an absolute hop bomb with almost nothing to balance it out), and it is better than I remembered. That being said, there are certainly a number of significantly better DIPAs out there. This beer lacks the depth and complexity that is present in the best ones. I would have again if it was offered to me, but running out and grabbing a 4 pack isn’t on my to do list."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep reddish amber color with a creamy white head. Smells of booze, citrus, grapefruit, a bit of toffee. Flavor follows with big toffee notes, lots of bitter grapefruit, and a smooth malty finish. This is on the malty side for the style but is nicely balanced with the bitter pine and grapefruit. Slick mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Overall, this is a solid DIPA from Dogfish, but I just don't get all the love for it. Borders on a strong ale, and doesn't give the refreshing juicy hop bitterness I expect from the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I had this beer for the first time in the fall of 2007. It blew my mind. I thought it was the most ridiculous thing I'd ever had, ever. I struggled to finish it, it was that beefy. Now, it's good. It's not a tongue-wrecker, but it's got a nice balance of flavor. It's definitely one of the most consistently good things coming out of Dogfish Head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is one amazing IPA. Words fail me."
""
""
"O: All in all, I truly believe that this is one of the most well rounded, in-your-face, hurry up, hurry up, ain’t you had enough of this stuff, ashtray floors dirty clothes and filthy joOH, SORRY. Jammin’ out to the Replacements. Good stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this beer... the presence of the caramel malt with the hop flavors throughout is interesting, though I'd say the malt manages to garner more attention than what I'd prefer. Definitely a sipper, with the syrupy mouthfeel and lingering sweetness throughout."
""
""
""
"This is mighty tasty, though I'm a little afraid of how thick and boozy 120 Minute is going to be..."

""
""

""
"O: A pretty good DIPA. I don't think it would be my first choice but it's definitely worth buying."
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark orange IPA color. I get citrus, piney, and floral scents, as well as some malty smells. The taste is where I notice a real difference from past times that I have tried this beer (may just be because this is my first beer in a few days, and this is the first multiple day break from beer I have had in a while). The taste is very hoppy, but very balanced with a strong malt flavor as well. There is also a very sweet and fruity flavor. There is a alcoholic hint, but not too strong. Overall, this is definitely one of the best DIPAs I have had, if not the best. Also, it is probably one of the most widely available ones. I highly recommend trying it."
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Look goes beyond golden toward an amber honey. Head is white with a beautiful lace. Nose is wonderful; hops are apparent but go hand in hand with a warming rosy citrus. Taste is satisfying but doesn't quite live up to the smell's promise. Great, wonderful beer, but not perfect."
"O: very very good beer, very drinkable despite the 9 percent abv. Very good IPA. Dogfish head has never let me down."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very enjoyable ale and provides a nice year round DIPA fix as we await the seasonal benchmarks like PtE, Hopslam, etc. DFH 90 is one I want to have on hand at all times and roll out when craving that off season DIPA along with the need to get a whiff of those memorable smells of Hawaiian. Niceth!"
""
""
""
"Overall a nice strong hoppy brew that had such a good balance of a bitter citrus and caramel sweetness that the high ABV was hardly noticeable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: One of my favorites. Can drink over and over again. For me, being a hop head, this is one of the best"
""
""
""
""
"Regardless of the price though, it'll be nice to pick this up as a treat every once in a while, and I'll probably buy it again, but it's much too expensive to buy on a regular basis. For the price, I'd probably be more likely to buy HopDevil (the other IPA I really liked), at least when it comes to frequent buying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is highly respectable IPA."

"Overall- Another great beer from Sam and the DFH crew. I love that this beer is not seasonal, because I try to get a 4-pack at least every other month or so."
""
""
""
""
"I remember first having this beer in the spring of 2008, courtesy of Goblinmunkey7. I thought it was the most extreme, ridiculous thing ever. I wasn't a big fan. Unfortunately, while my definition of """extreme beer""" has changed... extremely... I still have some issues with this beer. Something about the combination of sweet, toasty malts and the hop profile just feels a little off. But this is still a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The 90 Minute IPA from Dogfish Head is simply fantastic. Having a pint of it, it was a very nice amber color with a thick head. The aroma is very complex, some definite citrus hops up front with a strong sweet caramel malt hint. Very smooth though. Easily one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Maltier than others I've had, but I found this to be a good thing. Warmed me up, highly recommend trying it on-tap."

"Reviewed on: 01-28-2011 13:54:11"

"Pours a nice amber color with a thick white head. The aroma is very complex, some definite citrus hops up front with a strong sweet caramel malt backbone and a touch of smokiness. This glass/keg also had a bit of diacetyl which the server warned me about. I can detect it only because he alerted me to it's presence, I probably would have written the butterscotch off as hops+caramel. The taste is very smooth and complex. The hop forwardedness of the nose is balanced on the palate with the strong malt character and a touch of warming alcohol. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and exactly what I am looking for in a DIPA. Overall this is a really nice beer, a bit maltier than other DIPAs I have had (Pliny, Mycenery) but very nice."
""
""
""
""

"My hats off to Dogfish for one hell of a beer. Cheers !!"
"This beer is my favorite of all to date. The heavy lace along the glass paired with the bitterness of the hops that are perfectly balanced with malt makes this a must have!"

"This is a flavorful complex beer without overwhelming you with the taste of """overhopping""" or alcohol, despite its 9 percent ABV. Dark Amber in color. One of my favorites! $9.95 for 4 12 ounce bottles may put off some. Don't let this turn off you. Try it, and you will likely have a new favorite."
""
"Overall: An amazing beer that sets a great example of what an IPA should strive to be. Absolutely delicious. Also just noticed that it is 9%. Wouldn't have even guessed since the alcohol is hidden so well."
""
"Copper beer with a sudsy head and lots of carbonation. Has aromas of sweet citrus, light spices and caramel; some breadiness too. Flavors of tangy, spicy citrus and sweet bread. Body is thick and creamy but doesn't feel too syrupy. This is a great beer to sip on a cold January afternoon."

"O- I'm a big fan of Dogfish IPAs. I highly recommend the 90 minute, and it is definitely one of my favorite DIPAs."

"O: A classic. I wish I could have this as an option every time I had an IPA. No hints of alcohol, which for 9% ABV is impressive. Big hops, nice malt base, with a touch of sweetness. Will always buy this when available and never turn it down."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very drinkable, love the citrus notes throughout, well balanced between hop bitterness and sweetness. ABV is well hidden for 9% which can be dangerous. Will definitely pick up more of these, well done."

"O- i really enjoy this brew. top notch imo. the first time i drank this was at the beginning of my 'craft beer journey' and it was nice to have again, now that i am able to appreciate the flavors etc more. this brew is near perfect imo. the flavor keeps you wanting more and the complexity makes it interesting to drink again and again."

"Nice amber orange style hue. Lots of lacing on the glass. Smell of pine, resin, oil, and floral type hops. Perfect blend of sweetness and bitterness. Could see this pairing really, really well with Thai and Indian food, or anything that like the beer, combines bitter with sweet. See this pairing very well with food overall. Love the taste and mouthfeel of this beer. Well worth the hype."

"O- in my opinion this beer can be summed up with one phrase """ oh-ver-rated clap clap, clap clap clap.""" I can't see how the bros gave this such a high score as well as so many BA users. I just don't see the hype here guys. Its decent and will get you buzzin but there are soooo many better DIPAs than this one!! I wouldn't recommend it unfortunately. Can't distinguish any particluar hop character from either smell or taste. The only part of this beer I'm enjoying is the malt character, but that's not why I buy DIPAs, its for the hop character. Anyways, prost"

"Poured into Duvel imperial tulip glass. Plenty of creamy, off-white head & nice lacing. Despite being 15 days old, not much of a hop """punch in the nose""". The taste follows suit. A bit syrupy on the mouthfeel, but most DIPAs feel that way to me. Honestly, I get more bready malts up front, and finishes with a bit of citrusy bitterness. It is nice...smooth, and really hides 9% very well. Well balanced...no aspect blows me away."

"From a bottle to a pilsner glass is a crystal clear, coppper/amber beautiful beer with a bright white head & moderate carbonation. Great lookig beer. Aroma of citrus & some malt. Taste that stands out is the citrus, in particular grapefruit, with a nice balance of bitterness followed by some maltiness. Medium bodied, decently carbonated this beer finishes clean, smooth & strong. Not my favorite style of beer but I really enjoyed this one. Very easy & enjoyable."
""
"About time to try this famous american ipa. Smooth pour, clear dark orange with a creamy, one finger head that dissipates into bubbly islands. Smell is bitter pungency of hops up front, backed by sweet malt and citrus. Not too powerful of an aroma but well rounded. First taste: gentle explosion of hoppy bitterness with some lingering grapefruity sourness. Generously carbonated feel. Perfect balance of smooth and crispy. Goes down like nothing. Overall: extremely drinkable and undeniably a quality brew"
""

"Sunny and 64 on boxing day so why not pop open one of my Christmas gifts! Pours a brilliant crystal clear orange into my chalice and emits an almost orgasmic hoppy malt citrusy piney gush of olfactory assault. Tastes slightly syrupy nectary blend of malts and hops with accents of brown sugar and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is oh so smooth like nectar of the gods coating your throat on the way down. One of my favorite of the DFH lineup and overall my favorite of the East Coast IPA variety. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it's a very enjoyable IPA. There is plenty of hops for the folks who like their IPAs very hoppy. The most interesting and great aspect of this beer is how they've woven the other flavors into the traditional IPA style."

"While Dogfish Head no longer delivers to Indiana, it is worth the drive to Illinois or Michigan to get my fix of DFH. Though some prefer 60 minute IPA, I would suggest that there a few better IPA's available in wide distribution that are better."

"Poured into Dogfish Head snifter style glass. Has a nice honey color with white head. Some lacing on my glass. Smells great. It is richly hoppy with lots of grapefruit and other citrus. Sweet and malty flavor with lots of hops. Good bitter finish. Nice carbonation. Overall I think this is a good example of the style. Thanks BB!"

"I have tasted the 90 minute IPA on a couple different ocassions and it is always solid. A nice dark yellow pour with a head that does disappear but laces nicely down the glass. The reason I am finally doing a review in writing is because I had the 90 Minute IPA with sushi today for lunch. What a combo! The beer with its hoppiness, its clean palate, and citrus/pine finish following a spicy california roll and some raw tuna and salmon was phenomenal. I got nervous at first because I am a little crazy with the wasabi at times but noticed that the seafood and rice teamed up with the pickled ginger and wasabi was complimented completely with the beer. I love good beer and I love good food, the only thing better than both is to find something that goes incredibly together. This was one of those moments."
""
""
""
"Overall.- Great beer!"
"DFH 90 minute IPA is a solid east coast style imperial IPA. This beer uses English Barley which gives it a relatively creamier and maltier flavor as compared to a citrusy west coast IPA. Upon first sip, one can easily appreciate the subtle balance and flavors and alcohol which enters the palate. This IPA has a substantial foamy head and smells of molasses and hops. It's hard to describe the 90 minute IPA besides just saying that it has a sophisticated and high quality taste."
"Very well balanced and easy drinking for 9%."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a very good beer, but I won't buy it again. It's too well-behaved. If I'm going to pay this much for an IIPA, I'm not looking for balance. I want a bit of chaos. I want disorder. In short, I WANT HOPS! I want a good old fashion tongue lashing. I want a beer I'm going to still be tasting in the morning. I want a beer that newbies take a sip of, make a face like they've just bit into a raw lemon, and say ``good gosh! How can you stand that stuff?'' I can't justify buying this beer instead of, say, Stone Ruination, 3F Dreadnaught, RR Pliny the Elder, or Founders Double Trouble."

"Medium bodied, sticky, not slick."

"O- Really solid double IPA , the only thing I have against it really is it's a little too sweet."
"O: As an example of well-aged imperial IPAs, this is top-notch. Drinkability is not as bad as one would think, given the 9% abv, but I still wouldn't see myself having more than one in a session. It tastes great on cold nights, and is a good beer to share with a friend and discuss, but for the price I can procure beers that get me more excited."
""
"A very good DIPA. It is very good looking with a one finger head, copper color, extremely clear and the lace sticks. The smell is not very strong, but what I smell is crackers and pine. The taste is the same, with a lot of nutty, bread flavor. It is not thick the way a lot of DIPA's of this strength are. I could drink more than one easily, but the alcohol would quickly catch up."

"This pours a deep amber color with an off white 2 finger head that leaves plenty of lacing. Nice looking pour. Smells of malts, citrus, sugar, and some hops. Not overpowering but pleasant smelling. Taste is delicious. Very well balanced with malts and sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and overall this is an excellent beer. Abv may be a little too high to make it sessionable, but still very smooth and delicious."

"Probably my favorite of this series. Well balanced with both good hop presence and a good malt presence. I wish DFH still distributed here, but OH isn't far away."

"O/D - This beer is still good nearly a year after bottling. The hop character has definitely changed, losing some aroma and picking up more grassy notes. It's definitely shifted the balance toward the malty side, but it's still hop-heavy."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a very good DIPA, although nothing spectacular imho. Nearly the same as ST's 2XIPA in flavor, but I can get a 6xer of 2XIPA for $2 less than a 4pak of 90 minute."

"Overall, I've had this beer many times, it's one of my favorites, this one just happened to be a little too old. The hops had faded away and left a very tasty malty beer, just not great for an imperial IPA. There is still some bitterness just not what I know this beer normally has. I'll have this again in the future and re-write this because this example doesn't do the beer justice."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a bright reddish orange, with a one inch white sticky head, with a gentle pour. Nice ring of lacing that falls slowly after sipping, but hangs around the entire beer. Smell is apricot, pine, hints of carmel, some grass, and some pineapple. Taste is similar, the apricot leads, with a great balance of pine, carmel, grass, and pineapple in the finish. Really well balanced beer malts and hops hold hands, neither tries to still the show. On the larger side for the body, but very drinkable for it's ABV. Nice amount of life and the alcohol is well hidden. I think it is going to get a higher grade than I would have expected. Great price under $10 a four back and thank you DFH for the bottle date 10/11/11. My first DIPA ever years ago and it still impresses."

"O: There is a reason this beer has an overwhelming number of positive reviews - It simply is an excellent rendition of the east coast Double IPA which highlights a flawlessly executed, intense hop profile. Infinitely drinkable, I would hardly ever turn one down."
"Certainly good, glad I tried it, but Pliny is still the King in this arena as far as I'm concerned."
"man head to head with pliny this might, just mighttt, have a slight edge over it. my first doghead but definitely not my last"
"O: This is a decent IPA. There is a big punch of booze in this beer, and it's defiantly not a hop head's dream. It's way more malty that I really want in an IPA. But that's just a personal opinion."
"O: Remarkably balanced, quite complex."
"Overall, a really good Imperial IPA but it's no Maha"
"This beer is definitely one and done, took me quite a while to get through the bottle."
"With a deep yet clear golden brown color and a thin head sticking fast to its glass the beer is inviting right off the bat. The beer has a strong roasted aroma with the excellent 'grapefruit' variety hops coming out of the gate. The flavor has the very strong bitter pine anchored by a heavy malt backbone. There is a warming sensation due to the high ABV. Pleasantly bitter overall - not as drinkable in large quantities as the 60 min of course."
"Overall Impression- Hearing so much about these 4 brews (60, 75, 90, 120), I have now enjoyed 2 of the 4. This one wasn't as impressive as many other 2X IPA's I've been enjoying... Still very good but will have to get my hands on some 120. Would suggest this one for anyone! More like just an American IPA."
"Of all the three bottled DFH ipa's, this stands out as the clear winner. One of my all time favorite beers, and a must-try for every hop head out there. If you haven't had a chance to try this one, you absolutely, positively should."
"O: I am a big fan of IPA's and this is one of the best I have had. It's a little on the expensive side so that's the only reason it doesn't get slightly higher marks. Great beer though."
"Overall: I love everything about this IPA. It's the brew that brought me into the craft world. What else more can I say about this beer than that. Makes all my five senses float on a hoppy cloud. Cheers!"
"Pours a clear gold body with two fingers of white head with excellent retention and lacing properties. Aromas are predominantly of honey and oranges, with a fain whiff of that high abv and funky ethers coming off the top. The taste and texture blow my socks off. The sweet and bitter elements are both intensely concentrated and yet perfectly balanced and finessed at the seams where they meet. Caramel and honey sweetness blend harmoniously with orange and grapefruity tastes while gentle floral notes float delicately through the senses. The gentle, ultra-fine carbonation could not possibly be better. This is a very fine beer, one that I think should be enjoyed entirely on its own."
"O. Average DIPA, sorry DFH 90min fans, this is not what it was 10 years ago at the brewpub....but I sure wish it was:("
"Go buy this beer now if you have never had it. It may seem pricey that a 4 pack is around 12 bucks. But once you try it you'll be hooked and realize all you need is a 4 pack."
"I have to get more of this. Dogfish Head knows what they are doing, and they do it so well. I highly reccomend this IPA to all of my friends."
"O: One of my favorite beers. I'm an DIPA man, and the 90 Minute is one of the bests. If you haven't had the chance to try one, you're missing out!"
"Serving type: bottle"
"O: Wouldn't kick her out of the fridge- but I am not partial to the sweetness. For the style it leaves a definite impression"
"Although there are some things I don't absolutely love about this beer, it seems to come together for the most part. It's been a while since I've had this beer. And, I remember liking it a lot more before."
"Overall: Incredibly finished beer start to finish, head settles quite quickly which is of no matter. This is one of the few beers on the market which you get everything from looks to taste...Dogfish Head has outdone themselves with this beer and you should be outdoing yourself; grab at least 2 bottles take the plunge into the best of the best."
"Overall: This is a staple in my beer fridge, and plan to keep it that way. I enjoy drinking this ale, but it is a great brew for mixing for things like black and tans and a marinade for beef or pork when cooking."
"Overall this si a beer I will have again."
"Overall: This is one of my “old reliable”, “go to” beers along with Barton Baton. At 9% ABV you can drink a couple in a session. I definitely keep a stock of this at all times."
"o: dogfish continues to impress me with all of their offerings. this one was well balanced, with all the hops i was worried it would be overly bitter but it wasn't."
"O/D - Oddly not that impressive. Maybe it's just not my style of DIPA or it's the hop variety they used that doesn't jive with the alcohol. The sweetness seems to be intended from the research I've done on their website so the balance is interesting. While it's a solid beer, it's not one I would've pegged as a DIPA. The flavour seems a little off for me while it's still quite tasty. I enjoyed it despite what I interpreted as flaws in it."
"Overall this is a great beer. My favorite offering from DFH"
"O: I almost felt bad finishing my glass when i first tasted this puppy. Well, okay, i didn't. But the 90 Minute IPA was simply amazing. The fruitiness from the hops is so pleasent that you don't even mind that you are getting battered in the head with this high 9% av hop-happy beer. Teriffic!"
"Definitely one of my favorite beers."
"Pours dark yellow with a big frothy white head that calms down after a bit. Smell has a big hop aroma, citrus and sweet. Taste has big alcohol flavor up front, followed with the sweet and hops. The bitterness comes through with fruit notes towards the end with the alcohol sticking through the aftertaste. A nice smooth medium body with the maltyness is probably my favorite part of this beer. Good carbonation and mouthfeel. Overall lots of flavor, high ABV, but a good beer overall."
"This is still not my favorite DIPA and may not even make my top 10 - the caramel malt is just a little too prominent, hops are present but don't really bring a counterbalance to the malt or even really draw a line under it. This is clearly a well-crafted beer, but the malt/hop profile just isn't doing it for me. I guess one thing I can say is the booze is pretty well hidden."
"Overall, I look forward to enjoying one or two of these for the next couple of weeks. Anymore than 2 and getting up on time for work would be in jeopardy"
"O- I've had this beer countless times before and every time I'm reminded of why Dogfish is as popular as they are. If you claim to love craft beer, but you don't like this, you should have your head examined."
"Notes: HOPHEADS this is your beer!!"
"D - Incredible balance between malt, hops and sweet finish. Very drinkable. This is amazingly easy to drink for a beer of this strength and IBU level. For me this balance makes it greater than the sum of its parts (which are all excellent)."
"O: A big imperial IPA that is a pleasant departure from the West coast style I'm used to. Relatively easy drink for such a big beer, and definitely something I would recommend and buy again."
"Amber color beer, lightly veiled. Soapy head on top of it. Hangs in there for a long time. Looks indicate this will be a very good craft beer. The aroma has some notes of citrus, grapefruits with some piny notes. Caramel malts is noticeable too. Well balanced and complex at the same time. Nice. Taste is wow... So awesome. Full bodied beer in the mouth. Sweet and aggressive at the same time. So well balanced. Citrus and caramel malts. Bitter. It hangs in the mouth for a good time. Awesome. A very excellent imperial IPA. Dangerous since the alcohol is hiding well."
"The Dogfish Head 90min IPA is not for the weak Hop Hearted. This is a big beer with massive flavor and high ABV. The color is a rich copper with nice think head that laced. The smell included alcohol, hops, malt and hints of pine/citrus. The taste was an explosion of bitterness mixed with Alcohol. There is a definite attempt to mask the ABV with malt and hop...who wins is hard to same cuz your mouth turns slightly numb due to ABV. Mouthfeel....one is more than enough. Overall its not too bad...just not a session beer."
"O - Excellent DIPA that definitely deserves to be tried."
"O: This is a very great beer. Dogfish Head knows how to make something great with a twist. By far one of the better Imperial IPAs out there."
"I love this beer. Funny thing is that I would never grab this if I were looking for an IPA."
"I think this was the first DIPA I had, and it remains a favourite. Really a nice beer."
"Overall this is a well done beer. It is an imperial IPA that is quite strong (9.0% abv). So one and your already packing a buzz. I wonder if mixing this with a Stone Ruination would give a good result."
"O - Unbelievably good. Wow."
"D-entirely satisfying. this beer's hype supersedes and overstates it; this has no chance of becoming my """go to IPA""" but it is still a very enjoyable brew and one i would have no problem revisiting in the future."
"O: A very good beer. Not my favorite DIPA but a very good representation of the style."
"to me, this is my standard when it comes to this style. a great beer from an outstanding brewery."
"O-When I first tried this I was blown away, I finally came around to give it another go, it isn't worth the """hype""" (Everyone getting on the DFH bandwagon post brewmasters) There are better DIPAs out there and more readily available."
"O: A good malt-forward IPA, but disappointing in the lack of hops. Nevertheless, very drinkable given the high ABV."
"Overall this is tasty. Ive had it fresher before and it was delicious. This is my favorite DFH IPA out of the the trio of regulars. A must try indeed."
"The colour was a golden orange hue with a nice inch of head. intense hopp smell. Crisp taste with a hint of citrus, quite refreshing for a higher alcohol beer. Very hoppy flavour of coarse, but balanced nicely with barley sweetness. Nice carbonation, a malty bitterness kind of lingered in my mouth afterwards but in a good way. Very Niice"
"Absolutely delicious! One of my favorites."
"Dr: Very drinkable for the ABV, and decently priced as an import to the opposite coast. I like it and would try it on draught, but it doesn't live up to the hype. That said, IPAs are me least favourite style but this one is nice."
"D - I really like this beer, very complex yet nicely balanced to bring out the best of the hops and the malts."
"I remembered this brew being better, but, sadly, I was wrong. I’m sure I’m a minority on this one but this was not any more than an average DIPA, in my opinion."
"Overall: Really enjoyed this beer, I can see why they cut back on distribution. The demand should be great for this one. I would like to try it really fresh or on tap at some point. Naturally, they do not come to Utah."
"O: Likely a pleasure for hop heads who enjoy their imperial hop bombs powerful, bitter, and piney. For the rest of us, it may be a little too over the top."
"Overall I was super impressed with this beer and would love to try it again. It's anything but a typical IPA but coming from Dogfish Head that shouldn't be a surprise. It's a very special beer and now I look forward to trying their 60 minute and 120 minute IPAs as well."
"D - Excellent offering from Dogfish Head. Very drinkable for 9% ABV, as the alcohol is barely noticeable. Pairs nicely with salmon."
"In my opinion this is possibly the best beer offered by Dogfish Head. It has a beautiful golden red color and a nice white head. The nose has hints of maple and citrus, without any of the alcoholic overtones found in the 120 minute. The flavor is a subtle blend of fruity citrus, maple, and hops, really excellent. The mouth-feel is also impressive, a little thick yet still refreshing. This is one of my favorite beers, I've always been enthusiastic about IPAs and this is one of the best"
"This was a very nice beer, but the balance in hops and malts reminds me more of a hop-forward American Barelywine than an Imperial IPA. I look for much more hops with less malts in an IIPA, which is what keeps me from giving higher scores in the aroma and taste categories."
"Ohhh man. My first experience with DFH. (You can't get it in my home state. Literally. Not a single flavor.) This beer is damn good. Pours a beautiful orangish-yellow with excellent head retention and lacing. Smell? I can't even describe really.. Same for the flavor. There is so, so much going on in this beer yet it's so wonderfully balanced. Such a smooth, well hopped and well spiced bew. So many flavors I don't know where to start yet again, so well balanced. High abv is masked masterfully, save for the slightest bite of an aftertaste that really contrasts and enhances the delicious, sweet maltiness. Gotta get my hands on some more DFH. Best rendition of an IPA (imperial or not) to ever grace my taste buds."
"O: I LOVE this beer. I could drink it everyday...and would if I could afford it. It is just very well balanced, beautiful in color, rich in taste, and worth every penny."
"O: Oh, I wish we had DFH in Iowa! A delicious IIPA, a bit on the dry side but with some mellow sweetness in the mix. Enjoyed this very much and would gladly buy it again."
"Pours a rich amber/orange color, has a fingers worth of head. Head has nice retention and slick lacing down the glass. This smells very sweet and malty, not much hop presence up front. I expected my first sip to be a hop bomb, but much to my surprise it was pretty well balanced. Taste is also very sweet and malty, with a hoppy bitterness on the backend. No sign of the alcohol content. It was thicker than what I would expect, and a lower amount of carbonation than I had thought. OK beer, nonetheless."
"As far as I am concerned a fresh 90 minute is about as close as a staple of a DIPA as you can possibly get. It is a very well made beer. Sticky, oily, juicy hops! Great body! Great aroma! This beer has it all without going overboard to get there in my opinion. It is a staple in my fridge when I can get it relatively fresh, but it doesn't last long sadly"
"Very good go to beer"
"A fun, damn hoppy, easy to drink for an accustomed enjoyer, even easy to get drunk on IPA."
"O - Overall a solid offering and I very much enjoyed the way this IPA is balanced. The hops are still the critical element, but the strength of the malt enhances the hops and brings this beer to another level."
"Beyond the taste of this beer, which lends you a variation from your day-to-day IPA, this beer feels and drinks more or less like an ordinary IPA. The beer is crisp, well carbonated and light in mouth. If you’re into IPAs give this one a shot. It might not take the spot of your favorite IPA but you certainly won’t forget it any time soon!"
"It's DFH - it's 90 Min IIPA - what else do you want? Lost a little bit of the citric bite in the 8 months since bottling, but still really impressive."
"Medium to full bodied with decent carbonation, this beer is not the most drinkable DIPA out there, but is certainly one of the most delicious. The body is a little thick and is certainly both coating and sticky. The carbonation is not easily apparent as it is mostly found in the creaminess of this beer."
"I sampled this beer with a tangelo infusion via the Randall at the Savannah Craft Brew Fest and WOW! The hops still dominate but the infusion brought out the citrus complementing the bitterness beautifully. Very nice touch by very creative brewers."
"O- it's good, I won't get it again because I can't now, but it was good."
"Overall: This is a complex beer. It is extremely well crafted and all of the different flavors bend together perfectly. This is definitely one of my favorite beers and its fame is only reduced by the fact that it is almost always readily available."
"O - One of my all time favorite beers. let alone one of my favorite IPA's."
"cheers."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the sweet and sticky aroma. It had a perfectly balanced malt character, with caramel and darker grain, but also delivered robustly on the hop front. These were citric and contributed nicely to what the malts were offering. This is a standup DIPA, and the exact older brother one might expect from something so outstanding as the 60 Minute IPA."
"Final Thoughts: It's a pretty clear cut brew, but its done flawlessly. If you like IPAs, I can not see why you wouldn't like this one. Very good, but I expect a good IPA from Dogfish Head."
"This is a really good beer. Sorry I took it for granted."
"Overall: I am not surre if the taste could get any better honestly. This has to be the best tasting beer I have had."
"O- Great IPA. Classic taste with a unique take. My first offering from Dogfish Head, looking forward to many more"
"O. Great beer in it's own right. I just don't know how they did it, but who cares."
"This is the overall balance I wanted in a beer. Very enjoyable."
"Enjoying a freshly poured bottle during an enormous summer thunderstorm. Appearance is wonderfully close to new penny copper. Smell is good but a litte lacking for an Imperial. Floral Hops is appropriate. Taste smooth and not boozy with hops on top followed by malt to bring it to a smooth finish. Nice carbonation on the mouth. A nice attempt overall but not there with the Big Boys."
"Pours a very nice amber with good head that sticks around with good lacing. Smells piney floral that is hop forward. Really well balanced with lots of malt and well balanced hops, with a good hint of alcohol at the end. A really good beer, would like tom try all of the other minute varieties."
"Overall: A very good IPA that I would have again any day. The smell and taste are much more balanced and """rounder""" than the 60 minute IPA. The transition from sweetness to hoppy bitterness is wonderful."
"D- I honestly ordered this expecting a novelty beer, but I was treated to one of the finest brews I’ve enjoyed in a very long time. I’m typically not a huge fan of Dogfish Head, but this is a prime example of what they do best: IPAs. Had I not known better, I’d have guessed a high ABV, but not 9%. That said, very drinkable given how strong it is. On tap always beats bottle, but that’s especially true with this beer."
"Overall this is just an excellent, solid, and clear east coast DIPA. Ive always really liked this beer and love to throw this in the mix now and then."
"O - Great beer, really enjoyed the complex flavors and aromas from the deep rich malt backbone to the hops. Refreshing change from the West Coast hop bombs that have nothing to them but, well, hops. Very balanced IPA, intensely complex. This is my 4th dance with DFH 90 over 2 years. The first one I found quite sweet, the second too bitter, the 3rd not hoppy at all... I am glad I gave this another shot after letting my palate recouperate from all the West Coast hop bombs I was having a year ago. Looking forward to having one again when it is fresher."
"O: Overall I'm disappointed, this thing is a malt mess. After a month being stored cold that is a not good. Guess I will try to get a bottle that is more fresh and review it again. But a month old I wouldn't buy this"
"A pretty decent showing from DFH. Not sure how much difference a fresh bottle would taste as this is only a month old, but I would've like the hops to be a little more up front. Still enjoyable and will very much enjoy finishing off this 4 pack."
"Rusty brown pour with about a one finger light brown head. Sweet aroma ripe with caramel malts, and some toffee and biscuit notes. Citrus and pine hops are also very evident. Taste is definitely on the sweet side, thanks to the high alcohol content which really isnt noticeable. A lot of caramel/toffee flavors, backed up by a big hop presence. Finishes bitter, but not uncomfortably so. A completely different beast than the 60 Minute, but still surprisingly drinkable for a 9.0% beer."
"I picked up a four pack and after reading the label (ABV 9%) I was expecting something overly hopped and a bit harsh. I couldn't have been more wrong! Poured into a pint glass revealed a creamy head, beautiful brown orange color and a muted sweet/hop nose. The first taste was terrific. This is a complex IPA that is extremely well balanced. The best description (that I borrowed from another reviewer) is that it has a """cake like""" quality. The only downside is that the high alcohol content is hidden behind this extremely smooth brew. And it can sneak up on you."
"Overall, it's a good beer and a solid DIPA. It's got far more caramel malt/dark fruit character than any other DIPA I've had, almost making it barley wine like, but the hops are definitely there. It's sweetish, but never quite goes into 'sweet' with the persistent hoppy character. Glad to have tried it but in the end I must admit it's just not my thing. If you're into the darker, maltier DIPAs then this should roll right through your alley. Otherwise, if you find yourself concentrating on well-accentuated hop characters, this might be a bit of a turn off."
"O: Glad I finally got around to trying this one, it definitely lived up to its hype. That said, this is a very potent brew and probably not one I could handle on a regular basis. The blend of flavors is quite simple really, but also quite solid. I shudder to think of how powerful the 120 minute IPA must be. Cheers!"
"I picked up a growler at the DFH in Rehoboth Beach while my wife and I were driving from FL to NH. Enjoyed the brew one night later, and poured it in a pint glass. The beer was a light, pale copper-golden color with a thick, two and a half inch layer of big-bubbled, biege head. Aromas of grapefruit and pear, with a heavy dose of tangy hops, with a lemon-peppered like spice to it. Flavors are very well balanced, with citrus-pear sweet tones once again, balanced with a peppery, roasted hops character that takes over the palate. The sweetness and the round body keep the hops from being too dry, and the carbonation level keeps it light and crisp. Great lace cling on the glass. The aftertaste is slight caramel malt and hops, with a clean and smooth finish. Very tasty!"
"o-great beer that does not let down. Dogfish head continues to nail this style down."
"Pours a pretty ruby copper with highlights of red and orange, with a thin but solid bubbly lace around it. Strong sugary malt, followed by a delicate citrus hops presence. Big mango, apricot, grapefruit followed up by a warm but light lingering alcohol feel. Big sugary fruits touch on the tongue, followed with some spice and alcohol, very sweet and delicious. Full on the body, this beer has a big sugary feel to it that makes it a total sipping beer, but its is creamy and smooth and sweet. Overall this is a great beer, one of my favorites, lot of flavor lot of complexity and a lot of character."
"O - Overall, one of the best DIPAs currently available and definitely worth checking out. Dogfish Head does an excellent job with this style of beer and I have highly enjoyed each one they put out. If you like the 60 Minute IPA this is definitely one to check out."
"Overall-Is this my favorite beer? No. My favorite IPA? No. But this beer is consistent and is very reliable. Fresh or Aged it's a great beer."
"This is my kind of IPA. Huge hop notes, big bitter finish, but it's got some malt to go along with it. It's not like you're drinking hop juice. The 9% ABV warms on the way down, but doesn't have much presence other than that."
"O - I have had this so many times and this is my standard, go to beer. It is always a great choice for me and I really appreciate having constant access to it."
"this is a good beer. not a lot of malt flavor here. its just about the hops, and is a lot of hops in this glass."
"O-This one caught me by surprise, well balanced and malty different from others of the same style...i would say from the barley or the addition of the hops process...definitely can feel the 9% here...decent brew would drink again..."
"90 Minute looks the part with a burnt golden hue almost like rusted medal. Pretty clear beer, not much if any sediment at all. A nice cream colored cap leaving semi stick, good retention. Smell is the standard 90 minute with a heaping of malt giving off a candi like vibe. Cherry comes through minimally, cant really smell the hops under all of that. Taste is a rush of malt and candi sugar up front. Not sure how the candi sugar gets there since it is not used but that's what I get. After that rum soaked cherry with minimal rum and mo cherry. The aftertaste is where the cascade comes through giving off bitterness and floral all at once. Sweet with faded candi taste, if the cascade was not run through the randall this would be a hot mess cause 90 minute is kinda ewww. Feel is at a strong medium with adaquate carb that is not bitey with a bitter aftertaste after all is said and done. I enjoyed this good enough and would get again."
"O-A good IIPA but maybe just not what I expected.I was thoroughly derided by an extremely beer savvy friend of mine for voicing this opinion but that's exactly what this is,my opinion."
"O - Hops? I have had this before and I don't remember it tasting like this. Bad bottle?"
"Overall a great beer, I don't usually like Imperial IPAs but this is good, I will definitely have to try some more US IPAs in the future."
"Founders Centennial IPA you know he got some competition. The 90 min. IPA pours like a nice and easy drinkable IPA with perfect head and a gorgeous copper color. Not too much citrus nor pine but very floral. Not a great punch in the mouth buds but very sour not enough hop bite. She's a good IPA but can not compete with a classic Michigan IPA!"
"Along with Squall and Aprihop, the 90 Minute is just one more marvelous IPA out of the DFH stable. This is so smooth, it's ridiculous. The hops are a bit subdued, but you kknow they're there, and their role in both the smell and taste of the beer are still front and center. This is the kind of beer I can drink all day, and yearn for more. I highly recommend this to DFH lovers and hopheads alike."
"O - Overall, this is a superbly crafted beer. It's no hop-bomb but it knows that and it is excellent for what it is. One of my favorites."
"O: A tough beer to judge, I like it but it wouldn't be one I'd seek out again. It's hard for me to believe this is what it's supposed to taste like as a DIPA."
"I poured this beer into a glass, it has a copper/amber color body with a 1""" white head that lays down to a thin while lace. The smell is very nice of hops. The taste right of of the gates is hops, bitter taste(almost like pepper), then the malts come in at the finish(back of the tongue). Very nice mouth feel. Overall a very nice DIPA."
"not spectacular but a very good beer."
"Overall impressions were good, although I still stick with the 60 minute is much hoppier. I understand there is more barley so it is bound to be maltier, however the hop balance was good. I just prefer the straight IPA of a 60."
"O: This is how a DIPA should be; a great balance of strong flavors."
"No doubt that this is a good brew. Different from other examples of the style but it's a refreshing kind of different. Well done."
"O: A very solid IPA that I wouldn't think twice about ordering again."
"D- I could definitely drink this more often, for the style this is close to spot on."
"Overall: Heavy on the hops, strong flavors, lots of taste variety...Delicious brew. Highly recommended."
"D: overall just a real easy drinking DIPA that doesnt taste like a 9%'er."
"Overall: What's there more to say, really? This is an imperial IPA that topples so many others of its kind in terms of flavor uniqueness, easy drinkability, and wonderful aromas. I've never really had a beer quite like this before. I hope to get a much fresher batch the next time I purchase this and find out how age is a factor on this beer's quality - because if it tastes great after one month, I'm curious what the results are from one week!"
"Overall a very sweet, very tasty dipa, will have to try another bottle soon to see if I can identify some flavor components."
"Overall I really enjoy Dogfish Head's IPAs, they have great flavor depth and character separating them from the crowd. Will definitely keep some on hand."
"Overall, not for me anymore, was one of the beers that revolutionized my beer drinking."
"O- Great to sip on while enjoying a meal. Not one to just gulp down. Got this in a mixer but now I will have to go back and get a pack of these. Definitely a must buy."
"Having said that... this. is. scrumptious!"
"D: Definitely a sipper but very enjoyable. Recommended to those looking for something a bit more complex than the more run of the mill IPAs. Solid beer offering from DFH."
"O: Awesome beer, great double IPA, fulfills my hop cravings and is an incredibly smooth drinking beer."
"EDIT: On reflection, the one characteristic that I appreciate is that the taste develops in your mouth, opening from a floral hoppiness that ends with a light refreshing citrus. In retrospect, my extreme expectations for this brew were definitely a bit untenable and probably altered my initial review."
"O: really nice, go-to beer if its available, not the hop domination of many DIPA. Wish I could get this more often."
"O: a good DIPA. I can rarely find it fresh on shelves, but on tap it's quite good. Better than many more hyped DIPAs."
"O: a great beer"
"This is a prime example of what a balanced DIPA should be. Hops are present throughout, but never become dominantly bitter. In my opinion, the best smelling IPA."
"Cheers"
"There have been very few beers that I have tried and new instantly that I was into something good. I had not read anything about this beer before trying it and I sipmly went for some thing new. This beer is good enough to travel 80 miles, to get a case!"
"O - My first DFH review and this is right there with Pliny and the other elite DIPA's."
"This one did not let me down at all, I´m just gonna sit back on my hotel bed and keep reading Sam´s; """Brewing up a Business""" while I´m enjoying his beer to the fullest."
"O - A great salty, savory full bodied IPA. Well done."
"Overall - I love this double IPA by Dogfish Head, this is my go to beer!"
"This is the beer that got me into IPA's and Imperial's. This beer just looks delicious. It tastes even better than it looks. Very well balanced beer. For a 9% ABV beer it masks it very well. Be careful though. Will catch up with you quick if you're not careful. Overall a great beer and one of my fav's."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours amber in color with a good amount of white head. Aroma is very strong of citrus and hops. Taste of lemon, pine hops, and malt. Medium bodied, very complex. Alchohol is more subdued that I would expect at 9%. One of the better IPA's I've had in a while."
"O- What we have here is a perfectly executed IPA. Alot different than most I believe in which the Hops do not dominate...Perfect for a hot sunny day or a Netflix night at home with the family. Makes me wonder why it took me so long to try this one..."
"O: A smooth drinking DIPA, balances strong hops with caramel malt tones. Very drinkable, but a bit lacking on carbonation. Smells great, tastes great, overall an excellent beer."
"Overall: It is amazing how different this is from the bottled version (and even draft!). The bottle is sometimes harsh and too hop-forward (although I always love it very much). On the growler, the hops are mellow and there is more sweetness and an overall smooth feel that makes it outrageously drinkable. Outrageously, I say! I polished a growler in no time and wanted more."
"Kyle"
"Overall not my favorite Double IPA (I prefer Ruination or Maharaja), but a fine DIPA (better than many) and I love it. Recommended!"
"I'm not an IPA guy at all and this is great. What more can I say?"
"O - Being on the east coast this is one of my go to double IPA's. Just a very good and clean DIPA that is dangerously drinkable."
"O: A very good 2IPA. I'm not a huge hop fan but the malts subdue the hops enough where I can really enjoy all the flavors. Definitely something hop haters should give a try."
"One of my Favorite dogfish Head beers... so far. and a great imperial ipa."
"This beer was so easy to drink, clean and crisp, I could have easily sat at the bar and enjoyed several of these. If you are a fan of 90 min its worth it to stop by one of the DF restaurants and enjoy this beer hopped up with Randall!"
"O - Very solid DIPA, not overly bitter, but the hops poke you and it is rounded off by the caramel sweetness."
"Overall, a serious IPA for serious beer drinkers."
"PP (Price Point) - $7 for a pint, not bad at all, and even though I dont like defending east coast beer, I know this came out of the lines and not out of the keg!"
"Impression: This is a buttery, sweet beer which trades the genera's usual hop-pounding for a more balanced, desertlike approach. It is also unusually strong, which makes it a dangerous beer, considering it has a combination easy drinkability, delicious flavor, and high alcohol percentage. You see where I'm going here. This beer is best enjoyed with plenty of time to savor and respect it. Its flavor will immediately inform you that is not to be guzzled, but considered thoughtfully. I can't imagine enjoying this at a party - only alone or with a couple friends with lots of time to sit. This is an excellent brew, though DIPA usually denotes a hop explosion, and that's what I tend to prefer in these kinds of beers. This is an extremely successful malty version, and for those inclined to belgian beers who want something slightly hoppier in the summer, I recommend this."
"O - I have always enjoyed this beer. It is very well rounded and has all the qualities I look for in a hoppy beer. I just wish more stores would stop selling these older bottles as it never does this beer justice."
"As I mentioned up top, I don't usually go for IPAs or beers with a more pronounced hop profile, but this beer was unequivocally tasty. I applause Dogfish Head for their craftwork and understand why my sister (and just about everyone else for that matter) heap praise upon the brewery. WELL worth checking out, even if you're not usually a fan of the style"
"O: Quality shit here well worth the money spent."
"Overall, this may be the best I.P.A. readily available to the general public. Absolute must, if you are an I.P.A. fan, or even if you are not, it is a great transition into the I.P.A. world."
"this is my first DIPA and i expected it to be extremely bitter and not extremely enjoyable. To my suprise it is extremely well balanced and doesnt have a huge bite at the end. Very well done. Dont mind spending the extra $$$ for this well balanced drinkable beer"
"This is a complex 2XIPA with a strong buttery/toffee presence and a citrus finish. I tend to judge every Double/Imperial IPA against this one."
"THe 90 minute ipa poured from a bottle. Appearance was absolutely breathtaking,with beautius amber color and bubbly carbonation.A wonderful example of Dogfish Head beer.The Smell had fine aroma of smooth hop freshness. TASTE was full flavored hops and caramel malt,not overly citrus or pine flavored.THis well rounded perferct ipa,I'd buy for a evening session of drinking,but it wouldn't be to long of a session cause this comes in a four pack.Give it a try!"
"I finally found the DFH beer that makes me go wow. 90 minute is a balanced DIPA that delivers in all the right spots and feels great over the palate while you sip. Well worth seeking out and lives up to its following."
"Tastes are light malt extract, roses, hops, more hopes, fruity hops, garden veggies, barley, dried rice, peels and yeast. Smells are a lot of hops and sweet malt with some very basic light fruits such as apricot and melon. Pretty cool, pretty cool yessindeedy."
"Pours a translucent amber orange color and leaves webby lacing throughout the glass. The nose is crisp but smells more like a malt forward DIPA. Some pinr and floral hop offering are noticed as well. The taste is not the same. A nice balance is achieved between hop and malt and includes caramel malts, light citrus, and pine hop offerings and a bit of hazelnut. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty sticky. Overall, a bit better on tap but not too noticeably."
"I think I was most impressed with the rich mouthfeel of this brew. the taste is sweet and hoppy at the same time. It makes me want to keep going back for another swig!"
"EDIT: After some thought, I liked this beer and Founders Double Trouble so much that I changed my Favorite Style from Russian Imperial Stout to American Double/Imperial IPA. THIS is what I want from beer."
"it poured a white foamy head, dissipated slowly.It had a good orange color. I got mango and grapefruit aromas in the nose. slight hoppy flavor with a good tropic fruit taste with a little bitterness at the finish. I can't wait till I don't have drive from Louisiana to Houston to pick this beer up. I definitely want to taste the other dogfish head brewery beers."
"Overall, this beer is very nice. Certainly not a hop bomb though. I'm a bit pissed at myself for not going back to it sooner. A very good, but not great DIPA."
"It's not overly bitter and does have a hint of sweetness which most IPAs lack. The smell is fairly sweet before the first sip as well. I'm not a huge fan of the higher IBU beers such as IPAs but this is a real treat."
"Very enjoyable beer. A crowd pleaser- great for those who are usually not into DIPAs and big beers, because of the exceptional balance."
"Overall:"
"Overall - A dramatic beer that has 9% ABV hidden very well in a complex array of tastes"
"O- I love this beer. Have been calling it my """every day beer""" for over a year. YUM!"
"D-Overall this was very nice. Loved the hops and citrus. 60 min is smooth all th way through . 90 min has that point in the middle where its alittle dry but i like it . What a Great DIPA . will get this again"
"This is a nice brew. Plenty of flavor makes this a really nice session beer. It is smooth and easily drank. The alcohol is masked well."
"Love the beer, typical Dogfish head character with an abundance of flavor"
"O-This is one hell of a brew. One of the best that Dogfish has to offer and one of the best DIPA's I've ever tasted. Well done Dogfish Head!"
"Poured into glass a nice coppery-orange color.. nice head retention too. Not that good of an aroma honestly but didn't smell bad. Delicious malty, fruity brandy cake with a nice hop bite. This beer is not as hoppy as i was expecting it to be.. also for a 9% abv beer, the alcohol content was well hidden. Looking forward to try the 60 minute IPA, I just can't seem to find it anywhere. I will definatley be keeping this beer stocked in my fridge."
"First impression on taste was far less harsh in bitter than I’ve come to expect from American made IPA’s. I had a similar impression when I first had the Samuel Smith IPA in that it was far less harsh bitter than I expected. At 90 IBU’s in 90 minute versus 45 IBU’s in the Samuel Smith you can see the Dogfish methods in hopping are really great. A nice mellow citrus and malt taste that goes down really smooth. You definitely don’t get the impression that it has big alcohol in it. Easily one of the most enjoyable IPA experiences I’ve had."
"One of my favorite """regular""" double IPA's."
"O: I feel like this beer is much more complex than it comes across. Its hard to describe how it wars with itself. The end result is juicy but not fruity. Good stuff."
"Recently had this on tap and even more delicious! I highly recommend this DFH"
"O - A fine example of an east coast IIPA. Well bodied and flavorful, but without overdoing the """C"" hop profile. Well balanced between hops, sweet malts and alcohol. I feel this one lives up to the hype."
"V: I'm adding a """Value""" evaluation to my reviews to reflect my belief that ultimately beer should be a working-class pleasure, and as such, should not be prohibitively expensive. Dogfish 90 is a lovely beer, but its high price merits only a good value, rather than an excellent value. I would buy this only as a """special occasion""" drink."
"Overall - very good tasting but prolly a little too much. there is some real good balance and design, but not sure the focus was enough on the IPA. this is a true DIPA."
"M- Not sure how to describe, Just not much too it aside from bitterness. A little bit silky. Very easy to drink if you're a hophead!"
"O: Very nice DIPA and the taste doesn't fall very far off from the smell. I enjoyed it very much."
"O: A great imperial IPA. Enjoyed this one from first sip to last."
"Decent. I was expecting much more bitterness as the label boasts about the 90 min hop additions and dry hopping etc. Head stability was lacking a bit and it was a little too sweet for a DIPA in my opinion"
"Def one of my favorite beers. Typically i dont review them due to lack of time but apparently after almost 3 years on this sight and many of trades i need more beer karma to trade beer(crazy in my opinion). Anyway beer poured into a Dogfish head glass with a small head great smell and drinks wonderfully. By far one of if not there best beer!!!!"
"O - this is one of those beers that I really enjoy from time to time, and can even go multiples in a session, but it isn't on the daily menu. Even after seeing this fresh of a 4 pack at my local shop, I only bought one bottle. Perhaps a bit overpriced, especially for a year-round, but well worth it every time and again."
"O - Still good, but doesn't quite live up to the memories. I prefer the more hop forward/hop bomb DIPA's in the west coast style. This is still pretty damn good, but can't quite live up to my hopes and dreams for what it could be."
"O- Good solid beer. Not quite in the top tier of IPA's, but a good brew nonetheless. I actually like this one WAY better on draft than out of the bottle."
"Summary - I wouldn’t say this was my favorite of the Dogfish Head brand. Personally, I prefer the 60 Minute variant over this (less hoppy, more even taste). Having said that, I had this beer recommended to me while trying the fish and chips at the Holy Grail Pub in Plano, and I must say that it was a terrific combo. Having anything (like the tartar sauce) to even out the overload of hops significantly helps."
"This is very drinkable and I will get this again. Great beer which will bring me back to IPAs and I will use this to judge others by."
"O: One of the most balanced IPA’s I’ve ever had. The caramel malts make the potent hops flavor very drinkable."
"This is such a great beer and im glad its very widely available. One of the few IPAs i get excited about drinking."
"Overall this is a tasty brew, I like it, I would recommend it to friends and I would gladly stock my fridge with it as a regular beer."
"Enjoyed two with my BA bro, y2korey. One was fresh and the other from 2009. Both were delicious; however, the 2009 was phenomenal. The aged 90 min. was a lot smoother and reminiscent of barleywines. Their look was similar in color, but the nose and mouthfeel were almost completely different. Overall, both were worthy Dogfish Head's stamp of approval...(and ours)"
"Regardless, I will be enjoying this again in the future, definitely."
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation, dry and lingering on the tongue, slight creaminess at points. I've always enjoyed this beer but I wish the alcohol was masked a little better."
"Most people hold on to 120 Minute, but haven't heard much about people aging 90 Minute so I figured why not. Not bad. Got another one of these in the cellar, so it will be interesting to see how this ages for another year."
"This is a very good beer. I like it. But I find it rather innocuous. I want it to be either bigger, or better, or both. It doesn't bowl me over with hoppiness, and it doesn't impress me with balanced flavors. So I put it above-average. Wonder how much of that has to do with this being a 3-month old bottle. Hoping to try it fresher sometime soon."
"I LOVE THIS BEER!"
"Thick and smooth. The hop flavor is big from beginning to end. It's oily, earthy and mildly herbal. There is also plenty of biscuit like flavors from the malt in the background, but it's the hops that take the show. This is an exceptional beer with unique hop character from start to finish. This beer does not dissapoint!"
"Another good selection from DFH, beefing up the 60 Min. a bit. Pours a clear orange-brown with a nice foamy off-white head, much like it's brother beer, but a bit lighter. Floral aroma, with pine and citrus. Smooth, mild and pleasant on the palate, with the notes of the aroma following right through in the taste. Citrus hops complimented just right with sweet malts, with a little bit of sugar or light caramel taste coming through. Not too strong in the hop department for an imperial IPA. Pleasantly smooth and balanced mouthfeel, and highly drinkable."
"D: Doesn't hit the mark for the me in the style category. More so because I have heard so much about this brewery through pop-craft beer culture that I expected so much more jazz."
"Notes- For a while this was my favorite beer. looking forward to seeing how it ages over time, but right now, fresh, its hoppy and powerful, great for sipping on a dull afternoon or as a palate-destroyer at the end of a long night."
"O: This is wonderful. It is tough to add a superlative that hasn't already been said about this."
"D: A really great, balanced DIPA--malt undertones work so well with the hop-forward bitterness"
"OVERALL: Good beer, but not great. I see why it is the most reviewed beer on BA, though. Interesting and flavorful enough to keep the hopheads happy, but the sweetness makes it more accessible to wider variety of beer drinkers."
"This is a very interesting, yet deceiving beer. For my taste it is not a traditional Imperial IPA which would provide a citrus smell and more hops but that isn't a bad thing. It's a full bodied beer which relies more heavily on its malts than hops. The end result is more of a dark brown sugar flavor which provides a very enjoyable sweetness. At 9% it’s not for everyone but I enjoy one or two every now and then to fulfill my sweet tooth with this creamy treat."
"Overall, this is a staple to any beer collection. Delicious, easy drinking, not overly expensive. I often forget how awesome this beer is."
"Overall - Dogfish does a great job pushing limits and this one doesn't disappoint. Not your everyday session beer, but a fun look at a huge IPA."
"O; an hell of a i.p.a. the bitterness and citrus come togheter nicely."
"O: A well balance IIPA. I'd like to try this fresher than this bottle, this one was about 2 months old. Curious how the hop notes are on about 2-4 weeks old."
"This is a truly fantastic DIPA. I regret not picking this up until now. I always expected, apparently undeservingly so, a very malt-forward DIPA, and being the West Coast DIPA lover that I am, I always thought this beer wasn't for me, but this beer ranks as one of my favorites! Don't make the same mistake I did, try this beer now if you haven't already!"
"Smells sweet and of wood and hops. The taste is very sweet and very bitter. However, the bitterness lacks the leafy quality that many bitter hops impart, nor is it peppery. It is a bit resinous, but otherwise, the bitterness seems quite pure, which I find much more pleasing than the piney bitterness I have to endure in most IPAs. The taste is very very sweet with caramel notes in addition to the bitterness. There is also a very noticeable alcohol flavour. A pleasurable brew for its style, which I'm generally not a fan of."
"D: Nice, smooth drinking IPA. Not an everyday find where I shop for beer, and I'm glad I tried it."
"Overall- Delivered on all aspects when searching for a good American double IPA. The hops smack you right in the face, but balanced with that nice floral and citrusy taste that finishes sweet. A very quality brew delivered from a very quality brewery, would definitely drink it again."
"The aroma has a refreshing hops feel... the overall taste has a nice hoppy flavor without being over powering.. The body was just a tad heavy for an IPA."
"This is balanced through the finish with a nice bitter yet sweet and refreshing aftertaste. I only got 1 bottle and I wanted to get a 4 pack after drinking that 1. Delicious"
"A very good beer. Period."
"I would definitely recommend this to friends looking for a high octane brew without the typical alcohol burn or palette destroyer you might get in the 10% range."
"Overall this is a great beer. DFH 90 min fully lived up to my expectations. if you love IPAs with strong flavor character you definitely have to try this, it's a bit pricey for a 4 pack but it's worth it."
"This beer really picks up where the 60 left off yet still falls a bit short in some areas. Mainly the lack of an aggressive hop presence one would expect from a beer that had a """constant 90-minute hop addition.""" As a whole, like the 60 Minute, it is a very solid and respectable beer that is easily enjoyable. No small feat considering the high ABV. While the 60 left me wanting more in the way of a more full body, the 90 left me wanting a more assertive hop presence. I really enjoyed this beer and maybe I'm being a bit too hard on it. I guess what it boils down to is would I recommend this beer to friend? I would, without a doubt."
"just recently tried the 60 min and was really impressed so im looking forward to the 90 min. it pours a nice golden amber colour with a puffy 2 finger head that dies down to a nice film until the end. the smell is really piney and grapefruity very aggressive bitter smell. the taste is just intense straight up bitterness, pine and grapefruit and some alcohol is present. it has a nice carbonation and a little resiny mouthfeel. overall this beer caught me off guard i was expecting something more like the 60 min but it was still drinkable something i dont want to drink everyday but wouldnt mind trying it more fresh than what i had."
"D: A well balanced double IPA that doesn't over do it in any specific area and is nearly perfect."
"i am on the fence about going over a 4 overall -- in then end -- it is super bitter, and i would only ever want one every once in a while. excellent beer regardless."
"Although I enjoyed this beer, I feel that my expectations for an IPA represent something much different being that I am from the west coast. 90 minute pours an amber color with a one finger off white head, decent head and retention for a beer at 9% ABV. Alcohol comes through strongly in the most alongside the hops and caramel malt. I found myself craving a heavy hand of hops in the taste, this IIPA is certainly much more balanced than others, with a more notable addition of caramel malt. Mouthfeel was decent. Overall, a good beer, but I'll stick with my west coast IPAs."
"It's been a while since I've had this so I decided to give it a re-review. I've heard a lot of people lately bash this a little because it's 'too sweet' in their opinion, but it's the bigger maltiness that actually makes me like this more. After re-tasting this, I can really appreciate this as what it seems to be: not a purely American DIPA, but as an imperial American take on an English IPA. And I still think it's one of the best brews out there."
"It's almost a cliche at this point, but Dogfish Head knocks it out of the park again."
"Overall a different take on the double ipa. Very sweet malts backed by sweet hops. Made so well that the sweetness is not overbearing. Dark for an ipa but a looker. Always a treat to drink this beer."
"Poured into a snifter glass a transparent amber color with a good amount of slightly off-white head on it. Very good lacing to it as well. Smell is definitely hoppy with some caramel notes. Taste is very well balanced with some lightly roasted malts up front and a slight bitter hop finish. Not nearly as bitter as I thought it would be. Also does not have any alcohol taste despite being 9% ABV. Very good mouthfeel, light and goes down dangerously easy. I really enjoyed this beer and am very glad I got a chance to try it before it leaves Wisconsin. Not sure when I'll have a chance to try it again, but hopefully sooner rather than later."
"Overall, I immensely enjoyed this beer. It reminded me that beer can be savored and admired like fine wine. I will be buying more."
"This is one of those beers thats got me lost for words. I don't really know what to say about its flavor. Im a huge Ranger fan and really love that style, but to say thats better is ridiculous. I haven't had the privilege of trying PtY or PtE like some of you, but i'd like to think i've had a few IPAs, however none of them have been as much as an eye open as this one has. Notice I didn't say much about the flavor, that's cause I wasn't sure what to put, I almost don't want to insult the brewmaster. Just stop reading and go pick some up. The 60 is okay, not as good as this. In my opinion the 60 is borderline IPA. I will continue to respect DFH for what they really are and not the word on the street. Beautiful brew!!! Stay thirsty my friends!!!"
"Overall: This beer just does it for me. I really like the taste and the mouthfeel. As I alluded to above, I probably drink this beer too fast as I just find it very well done. I hope I can continue to get this beer!"
"Worthy!"
"This beer made me fall in love with IPAs in general and there is no reason for me not to review it on here. Well done, Sam and company."
"Overall - Very rich brew here gets even richer as it warms up I'd like it to be less rich as it warms but still nice all around. A must try for anyone that likes a good IPA, go grab yourself one and give it a go."
"Overall - So smooth. One of the best IPAs I've ever had. No off flavors whatsoever."
"Drinkability: Very good. It may be hard to put back more than one of these in sitting because of the heavy ABV and the medium body but I sure want to. The flavors are so clear. It taste of alcohol which in this case is good. It's a strong beautiful drink that can definitely hold its own in all the saloons across the world. One Bourbon, one Scotch, one 90 Minute!"
"This is it, really. I should just give it straight 5s and be a total Dogfish Ho', then go back to the brewery - only 2.5 hours off - and fill my trunk."
"O: This is probably my favorite imperial IPA right now, maybe next to Avery's Maharaja. It's quite exceptional, and dogfish head is an amazing brewery."
"So freaking good! This IPA doesn't mess around. The brew is a deep copper color with an intense hop aroma that is unrelenting from start to finish. The flavors are so refreshing, Citrus, Pine, amongst many other types of bitter flavors just flooding this beer. The hop flavors are fresh and juicy, which make this such a treat to drink. The head doesn't stick around for a long while but it does have a nice lacing down the glass with every sip you take. There is no mistake that this beer is truly a gem. I must try for any hophead!"
"That being said I was very impressed with this beer. The taste of this beer is out standing. You get a ton of flavor and hops without a sacrificing the smoothness of the beer. There is a slight bitterness to the after taste that reminds me of other IPAs but this beer has a significantly better taste. It also leaves you mouth feeling quenched without any dryness to it. This is a great beer to have over dinner. Cheers."
"Great beer!!!"
"Hoppy hoppy hoppy. This is an unreal IPA from Dogfish. Not always a huge fan of the overdone IPA's, but this one is something special. It has bitterness and flavor at the same time. Very complex flavors with caramel and some fruits (apricots and orange). Very nice ale with a very drinkable quality. The high ABV makes it a special treat and especially good with some bread, cheese, etc. Nothing to drink with a meal, just enjoy!"
"ENJOY!"
"O: A solid quality crafted American double IPA. Not overly bitter, a good introductory beer to strong IPA's."
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good DIPA. All the flavors I would expect from a DIPA were there and executed very well. This beer also looked damn good, the head and lacing was everything I want from a DIPA. The price per ounce is about the same as Hop Stupid, next time I want a good DIPA I might be inclined to get 2 singles of this rather then my go to bomber of Hop Stupid. This beer made a good first impression for Dogfish Head on me and I would love to see what else they have. Now I see why so many people love this beer."
"The smell has hints of fruit but also maybe a little wheat which was odd to me. A bitter taste but not overpowering."
"The sweet taste really comes through for me, and that sweetness stays in the aftertaste as well. I don't get the big citrus taste that I would expect from a big IPA. Has a nice creamy feel in my mouth."
"If you don't get dogfish head where you live, trade to get this beer, it is the best!"
"I have had this many times in the past but I don't think I have had one this fresh, dated 02/03/11, so it's 6 weeks old. Not bad for across the country and up into the mountains of Arizona. It isn't a West Coast hop punch of an Imperial but that doesn't mean it's not a great DIPA. Highly recommended!!"
"Dogfish Head beers, specifically their IPA types, all have a distinct aroma, feel and flavor the I am beginning to feel I could detect without seeing the bottle."
"Quite possibly the best IPA I have tasted. Has the ABV that I desire (and demand) in an IPA. Smells great and the hops are not overwhelming like Hop Ottin' IPA. A minute or two after a taste I still have the great taste ruminating in my mouth. Tastes nearly as good in bottle as it does on tap. Price is worth it."
"D- i would pick up a 4 pack down the road but it's not the 1st nor 30th on my list."
"O- A very well balanced ipa with a little more hop character than usual"
"D: It's a big beer, and it doesn't hide that fact, but it's still fairly drinkable anyway."
"Overall, this is a very coarse and very one-dimensional beer with almost no subtlety at all. It takes one aspect of an ale and cranks it up to ridiculous levels at the expense of everything else. If this is a typical example of Dogfish Head's product I honestly cannot understand all the praise they get. It's like a comic book--big loud bright colors and lots of superficial flash, but no subtlety or balance."
"The fact that I like this beer and I'm nobody's hop head makes me think the true hop heads might want a more upfront hop presence. The balance works for me though."
"Overall. Good drinker for the abv. Would buy again if the price was right."
"Overall: The drinkability is... DOH. Overall this is a good beer. A very malty, sweet DIPA. I've had this many, many times over the last 8 or 10 years, and it seems to become more mediocre the more I try other beers. Still solid, and readily available."
"Seems to strive for, and achieve, a balanced approach to a double. Mood dependent, this can be admirable or deplorable. Tonight it's somewhere in the murky middle ground. A good beer, an accessible beer, but not a beer that I ever consistently reach for."
"D- Not high for me for how strong it can be, but gets extra points for being fantastic beer that i will come back and sip on."
"This beer is way too bready sweet and malty for my DIPA taste. Give me a citrusy DIPA anyday over this."
"Pours a deep hazy amber with off-white head. Aroma is amazing - layered hops that start piney then go to grapefruit then give a brief floral kiss at the end of the inhalation. Also a bit of candied-fruit in there somewhere. Clean bitterness that sits right above a well-positioned caramel malty backbone. Deep fruits. Bitterness hangs on and reminds you what you're missing when the glass is empty. Well-carbonated with flavors that bounce off the palate. A masterpiece!"
"I don't think the current 90 minute beer is fully developed."
"This beer pours a dark reddish brown color with a decent sized head. The smell is sweet with a bit of piney hops at the end. The Taste is smooth with the Malt really coming through and only mild bitterness. Not a lot of hop flavor or aroma. This tastes more like a barleywine than an dipa. The mouthfeel is good and has good carbonation. And at 9% this beer is very drinkable. Not that this is a bad beer I really enjoy it but I do think it should be classified differently"
"Very drinkable at 9%, this is a rather good beer, but I have to minus some points on this, because of the lack of hop bite. If they had labeled it as a barley-wine,or maybe strong ale/black IPA, I would rate it higher. Very good, it's just not a real American IPA,much less a Double/Imperial."
"D: The just above average flavor knocks this one's drinkability down a bit, as I really like most of the beer's other elements.. Although the alcohol is well hidden and the mouthfeel is pleasant, I'm probably content with one of these at a time."
"D: I think there is a good balance here between all components. If you're a fan of the dry west coast style, this may be a touch sweet for you. Hides the 9%-ABV well, so I don't think it would be difficult to drink more than one of these."
"Was a little let down with Aprihop, but this one was a winner!"
"Fans of the hop forward California Imperial IPAs may not get their hop fix here, but this is a really nice beer and deserves its reputation."
"D - So, so smooth. Though the ABV is high, it is tempting to have more. Would catch up to you fast if you did."
"D - If not for the high ABV, the beer is incredibly drinkable. Great flavors and a pleasure to sip."
"D: Great tasting complex brew. I loved drinking every bit of mine. High ABV keeps this from being much more than a couple in a night."
"D - a favorite for years past and years to come. west coast may claim it's not hoppy enough, i just say it's a darn good beer."
"I have learned that a lot of people enjoy Dogfish head beers. The 90 minute is the first that I have had. I gotta say I'm not terribly impressed. It has a rich bite which is fairly good. it is dark in taste and isn't that horrible to taste considering i don't usually prefer dark beers. It's strong and relatively drinkable. I suggest it if you enjoy dark beers."
"Two finger rocking off white head.  Great retention and sticky white lacing.  Smell is gorgeous hops with a nice malt balance.  Also picking up nice herb and nutty quality. What a smooth brew.  Initial attack is all hops but the malt pulls it's weight and balances this brew.  Alcohol is definitely there but not in an unpleasant way.  Actual the contrary, has a nice warming affect.  Solid mouthfeel and drinkability at 9%.  Love this brew."
"D - One of the strongest IPA options that the states have to offer. Well balanced and delicious."
"DRNK: Obviously, to me since this is in a four pack, I do not plan on finishing it in a night. Although, this is one of the easier IPA's to drink IMO, I wouldn't like to finish a four pack in an evening especially because it is upwards of $11 a 4 pack."
"Used to be my favorite, now too rich & sweet for me. Still an amazing beer. Nectar of the gods."
"Drink up!"
"D: I'd definitely buy this again. It is a great example of an American IPA."
"considering the ABV, pretty damn drinkable. probably sessionable alternating with some ice water and a hearty appetizer!"
"D - Cant stop going back to this double IPA. Its just such a solid beer it really goes to prove that this is a delicious DIPA."
"brew sets the standard incredibly high. This was one of the first top quality craft beer that set me down the road on my BA journey, and I'll always love it. I waited this long to review it so I could let my palate develop, and it's just as good as the first time if not better, even after all the great brews I've had since. Can't recommend it highly enough."
"For me, this is a great end of a long day sipper. A wonderful beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Body is just under medium, and damn close to chewy due to low carbonation. Fabulous. Super creamy and smooth going down. Overall, a very good DIPA. Pretty drinkable, even though I can tell that it's 9% ABV after a couple of them."
"Overall, I would definitely say that this is one of the best IIPA's I've ever had so far. It's absolutely incredible and well worth every penny. After trying this first bottle, I'm actually heading out to the liquor store right now as i finish this review to pick up a 4-pack!"
"Very nice DIPA by the dogfish head brewing co. Picked up one to try because I've heard nothing but good things and was not dissapointed."
"D: Good drinker. Excellent beer, even though this style is not my favorite."
"D- Very drinkable especially for the high abv 9%. Everything comes together in this brew. The aromas, the taste, the drinkability, excellent DIPA and a must have for all IPA fans."
"Overall it is not my favorite IPA because it isn't quite 'refreshing' enough, but it is a good segue if you aren't accustomed to the strong contrast in taste that an IPA brings to your lips."
"Although stronger, I would recommend to anyone looking to branch out from the norm."
"D- Solid beer, the balance and marriage of strong flavors make it easy to drink. Been drinking this one for awhile and it never gets old, hides the booze well which is my preference for the style"
"I wanted to enjoy this brew as long as I could, but also couldn't stop drinking it. Given that I followed it up with a solid fantasy football draft, I'd say Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA deserves every praise it receives."
"You'd never guess that it's a 9 percenter. Even its predecessor, the 60 minute took on a much harsher, bitter personality. This 90 minute is a smooth operator and the flavors come alive as it warms. That paired with the low to no carbonation in the body at warmer temps contribute to its smoothness and can really get away from you, it's a creeper!"
"This is a wonderful beer. Drink this a mouthful at a time, this is something to savor. When poured into a glass it is clear as wine, with perfect head. The hops are right where they need to be with the high alcohol content. This is strong beer, but does not taste boozy or wine like. I really like this, and will leave technical appraisals to others."
"Pours a dark amber with maybe a 1/2 inch head or less. An outstanding aroma, lots of hops (as expected form the brewing process advertised on the label). There is a lot of great varying hoppy taste in this one - and the aftertaste sticks around for a while, acts as a nice relaxing beer. A nice full mouth-feel, thick almost like a creamy, syurp-y feel. This beer is potent, at 9% ABV, I may be on a smaller weight-class, but I can feel a decent buzz about 4/5 through one. Definitely a beer to enjoy, sip on one or two in a sitting - couldn't recommend this beauty enough, truly delicious."
"One of if not my favorite IPA. During the summer my friends and I will go to the DFH brewpub and get a variety of their excellent beers on tap. However, this one is always my goto. It is one of the staples of the DFH line up of exceptional beer. A sweeter IPA, hops don't seem to overpower the beer. Great combination of malt and hops."
"Poured a lovely golden color with a massive 3""" head which took awhile to dissipate. Fresh clean hops smell. Taste is mildly sweet with more fresh clean hops, caramel, prune and fig. It's so fresh in fact that even the day after if I smell the empty bottle it smells like I just then opened it. Clearly a high quality IPA but I take exception to the box claim this might be the best IPA in America - it's a quite good IPA though."
"D: I could drink this beer all day."
"Amber appearance with a wonderful hoppy aroma, Has a great hop bite for hop heads like myself. The hop taste lingers in the mouth, really lets you know its there. Drinkabilty: This not a beer to quaff a 12 pack down this is a beer to enjoy when you may have only one or two"
"Light bodied, but has a very long finish. The mouthfeel is not as dense as I was expecting and seemed very thin. Great bouquet and high hop consistency seems balanced on the nose, but it's thin body seems to pull more of the alcohol out instead of the flavors. Overall though still very good."
"Drinkability is high. Very smooth and tasty. Good thing I bought a few!"
"A very drinkable golden IPA with frothy white head. Retention is ok. Great pine and citrus notes on the nose and the taste follows with a sweet grapefruit with touches of pine and citrus hops. Nice malty middle of biscuit and toasted breads. Touch of sweet. Slightly oily. Mild and mellow. Very drinkable."
"The great IPA from Dogfish Head is one you need to be careful with. Exceptional drinkability this 9 percent beer with sneak up on you. Great dark amber apperiance and sweet almost grapfruit notes in this beer. The smell you pick up on the sweet notes and the bitter hops."
"D: If it wasn't for the ease of finding dreadnaught and hopslam (this time of year) I would definitely have this more often. Overall, a solid IPA."
"This is one of the best IPA style beers I have ever had. Absolutely awesome."
"A very strong offering by Dogfish Head, and something that I can appreciate. My palate though finds it almost too strong and oily. This doesn't seem like a beer that I would pick up very often just for leisure (especially at 3$ retail per 12oz bottle..) but I'd be very curious to see how it paired with some foods."
"D- Enjoyable. Not going to drink it every time I get the chance; probably one out of three, due to availability of other DIPAs."
"as expected, the taste is more hop forward, with more of a crisp floral hop flavor and smell. I wouldn't say any better or worse, just a little different. cool twist on an already great beer. try it if you have the chance."
"D: Quite well balanced. Goes down way to easy for a beer this strong. Extremely drinkable especially as an Imperial IPA."
"i have had most of the offerings from Dogfish but i have to say this one is my favorite. this is a very intense beer and not for the domestic lager drinker. i found the flavor and hop profile to be exceptionally balanced and actually improved as i made it further down the glass. so i actually liked the beer better the more i drank of it. this is definitely one i will go back to."
"D: could drinkt this all night without issue."
"Taste is very malty with a good hop kick. Very dry like the 60 minute, and just as drinkable. This one has more character though, a less refined feeling."
"CHEERS."
"the drink ability is great...the only reason i give it a 4 is that its 9% abv not your average session"
"Pours highly carbonated, with a big, foamy head. Smells kind of sweet, slightly citrusy. Tastes a little hoppy, a little malty. The 90 Minute gets better as you work your way through it. It's so creamy and delicious. This is my favorite double IPA that I can get year round. Nice!"
"D love me some dogfish head"
"D. Quite a nice IPA offering from the Milton boys."
"This is a bit heavy for me for other than a sipper and the alcohal is quite prominent. Where I have had other big IPA's that were thirst quenchers, this beer showcases the alcohal front and centre and comes off more like a barly wine to me. Very tasty though and the retention on the glass is art work."
"D- Very solid. I would drink these every day if they were easier to get a hold of in the UK (and cheaper)."
"The mouth feel is medium plus and it's quite drinkable, but beware of the 9% abv. Two's my limit."
"D: The finish is perhaps a bit on the drying/metallic side, but still, the unique flavors keep me coming back for another sip."
"D- very very very drinkable, i could have sip on a few of these in an evening and thoroughly enjoy myself, the alcohol is in there but it just adds to the experience. not a session beer, but a perfect sipper nonetheless."
"M&D- It bites the tongue. I get a hard hit in the back of my throat that runs deep with hops and resin oil. I think is an amazingly drinkable brew for the 9% ABV. I wish this was available to Kansan's all the time not just by mail."
"The hops in this beer just jumped out when pouring it. One of the stronger smelling IPAs I had. Drinking it was the same, different hops through and through. It was warming but drank like a much lower than 9% beer. Great IPA. I look forward to trying the other Dogfish head IPAs."
"Well done on a fantastic brew Dogfish Head!"
"Amber and clear with decent white head with very faint tan color. Very hoppy smell with a malt undertone, pleasant start. Flavor is a battle between fresh piney hops and slightly sweet sticky malt and sugar. Super good drinkability with little sign of the heavy gravity. Not a beer you can drink easily all night due to power and flavor potency. Overall this is my favorite American IIPA, an example that through dedication you can strike a fantastic balance between strong alcohol, high hoppiness, and sweet maltiness. There must have been many batches thrown away to get this gem."
"Update: After getting called out on my review of this beer....I have reconsidered it and tried again. Not sure if I had a bad bottle or my palate was off. But....the second time around was different. I did enjoy this one and will finish my four-pack instead of giving it away now. It pays to reconsider a beer once in awhile, for sure."
"Mouthfeel is good, the beer has almost a medium body and although the carbonation in this bottle is a little stronger than I would like it keeps from being to much. The 90 minute ipa is quite drinkable and an awesome choice, even more so now that my local grocery stores carry it."
"D: Bamadog left the growler - that's a good thing. It won't go to waste!"
"Cheers"
"My first 90min only chilled in the fridge for about an hour after plucking the 4-pack from the non-cooler section of the beer isle. Popping the cap I smelled that deliciously hoppy smell you expect when bringing home a craft IPA. Nice copper hue and the taste was exceptional--not too bitter like some other IPA can be. You can tell you're drinking a great beer when it still tastes great a little warm. Continuos hopping is a beautiful thing."
"Overall, DFH is my staple home state go to beer. And I have to say, I live on the 60 and 90 min IPAs from their catalog. Love the other stuff, but these are their top two for me. Highly recommend!"
"This is pretty much a classic...almost to the point of being a standard to the style. Great tasting, well hidden ABV and easy to drink!"
"Drinkability: Overall, the flavors are outstanding, the smell is great and it packs a wonderful punch... Unfortunately, the punch that it provides may be a bit much and I feel it realistically lowers it a bit, but I would still easily get through a couple of pints in a night."
"Dogfish Head has already shown me that they can make a delicious IPA - the 90 minute is not the one. I'm not impressed and will continue on with other IPAs."
"O: It's a damn good beer, but it's not my favorite for the style. A little too much of a malt backbone for me."
"D - Very drinkable, even at 9.00% abv. The flavors are very excellently balanced from start to end with a nice hop profile while still having the right malt presence. Very balanced mouthfeel and taste."
"D- Pretty drinkable for the amount of alcohol, malts, and bitterness"
"Good but not great in my mind. I'll have no problem finishing up the 4 pack, but it will likely be some time before it makes the rotation again."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I can tell why this was voted best beer in some poles they mention on the packaging, its really good. So if you haven't had this beer yet try it. I'm sure you will like it as its very approachable for many different beer drinkers. My local stores are selling this for $9.00 for a quad pack."
"Overall: A great beer. Drinking this beer slightly chilled masks a lot of the alcohol. As it warms up I start to taste and smell more of the booze, however."
"This pours a reddish copper color with a nice white head that fades down to a ring and an island with good lacing. A nice beer to look at. On the nose there is a strange note that I've had in other beers, sometimes to a fault, that I can't put my finger on. Wild mushrooms, brussel sprouts? That really dominates the nose for me, not necessarily detrimental but not my favorite nose, either. In the mouth that wild mushroom note transforms into a biggish hop presence, not super citrusy or piney but sweet with a tingle, with some other sweet tones like grapefruit coming through later. In the mouth those flavors linger on in a medium body with the hops and carbonation keep prickling on for a while. It's quite drinkable for a DIPA, and the alcohol is hidden pretty well. Overall, pretty good. Not my favorite due to the nose, but a worthy beer for sure."
"Verdict: One of the World's finest ales and a must have for every beer lover. Near to perfect."
"Final thought - Pretty good beer all together"
"D - Yup, pretty solid, love the coffee nose. A little too heavy in the abv. to drink more than a few. Wish it had been fresher though, kind of drank it as a last resort since it had been sitting in my girlfriend's fridge for well over a month."
"D - I could drink this beer all night given the chance."
"Wishing I could find this on tap!"
"This is a great beer and as a hop head love Dipa's. The appearance of this beer is a cloudy amber orange hue with light carbonation and a 3 finger head that lasts quite awhile. the smell is of pine and citrus fruit with underlying sweetness in the background. The taste was misleading not bad at all but not as hoppy as I expected you still got that citrus flavour but more sweetness than I expected. The mouthfeel was great at 9% this was remarkably smooth. I could def drink this all day this growler was very enjoyable."
"The head is very white and bubbly, but dissipates rather quickly...does not take away from the beer though. Very Little lacing as well."
"D_Very easy drinking especially for a IMPY."
"D: This isn't the easiest DIPA to drink, ABV is fairly high, it's astringent, and very malty and filling."
"This beer pours a nice golden orange color with a finger or so of white foam on the surface. The smell of hops is there, but not as strong as I would have anticipated. It is my belief that this particular bottle isn't as fresh as it could be. The taste has a citrusy hop flavor to it but there light sugary sweet malt notes do come through to accent the beer. This goes down pretty smooth for a DIPA. Usually there is a strong bitterness to contend with but it is not the case for this particular beer and it is rather enjoyable to drink if I do say so."
"Solid."
"A very very very good IPA. I'm excited to have the other three. I really enjoyed the adventures of flavors and senses that I encountered with this beer."
"O- Every time I drink 90 min I like it more. I started off really loving 60 min and only liking 90 min but over time I really love 90 min and believe it's such a classic and outstanding example of a DIPA."
"This beer to me is one of the most solid dipas out there. It's really nothing special but damn it's tasty.... Pours orange with some reddish tints. A bit of head. Smells hoppy and malty in a very nice balance. Solid mouthfeel and highly drinkable. a truly solid beer"
"D- my taste was done in no time. Very drinkable"
"D: Even though you can taste some of the alcohol, the 9% will sneak up quickly. Probably a good thing this comes in a 4-pack, because if it was in a sixer, I'd probably end up regretting drinking the whole thing the next day"
"D - Drinks GREAT for the hop head, nice different IIPA with great taste and a different smell, looks like they have there own recipe that has hints of a west coast IIPA style and there own... VERY good stuff, Nice BUZZ! LIKE it! THUMBS WAY UP!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable but the 9% ABV will sneak up on you."
"drinkability: Very good, the alcohol taste is a little strong though and builds up on me a little."
"I think this beer is the best there is."
"D - if your palate is in to the hops that's twice the amount or more than regular beer, then this is for you. Very drinkable and will drink again, very soon."
"Damn! More drinkable than i remember. I could actually knock back 2-3 of these. Oh no..."
"D- I seem to get tired of this after a single bottle, probably because I'm just not crazy about this level of maltiness in an IPA. I've enjoyed a few on several occasions but usually I'm ready to move along after one."
"D - Very good drinkability in and of itself, though with the 9% ABV you probably wouldn't drink *too* many in one session!"
"Nose is a knockout of spicy, bitter, powerful resiny hops. Rich, thick and sweet on the attack, a real mouthful of an IPA. This is so rich and sweet with a boozy toffeeish finish. Alcohol is masked by all the sweetness but it's almost like a 9% Belgian in terms of it's weight. For me, this is tasty but it steps outside the realm of everything I like about American IPA's, bold assertive bitterness and hoppiness that balance a huge malt bill and keep you coming back for more. Here the palate is just too sticky and sweet to make this at all sessionable. Actually difficult to finish a 10oz pour. If you like your IPA's big thick and sweet, this could be for you but I'll take a more balanced Pliny or Sculpin any day."
"D- The most perfectly balanced IPA I have yet to drink. I have got to get some more of this before it dissapears from my local beer distributor!"
"After all the hype of this beer I decided to buy a 4-pack I saw at a local store. This beer delivered on that hype and then some. Knowing beforehand that this beer was packing 90 IBU's, I was expecting very intense hop bitterness, but soon found out that wasn't the case. The hop flavor is not overpowering and plays very well with the maltyness. This beer is actually very sweet too, which masks some of the bitterness you would expect from a 90 IBU IPA. Already one of my favorite beers of all time! Well done Dogfish!"
"I love this beer. Fantastic smell, taste, feel. Something I could drink every night."
"d: pretty drinkable for a 9% beer. hence the fly-by review."
"Everything but the ABV and the price makes it very drinkable. If you're a hophead you could probably drink several, but the ABV will limit you if you have to drive home, and the price per 4 pack will limit you if you're on a budget."
"An incredible beer poured into a perfect pint. A very heavy, hazy beer, the head almost seemed weighed down, but was well retained. The smell is just a beautiful bouquet of hops and the taste is that with the malty well-balanced sweetness. You can notice the higher alcohol content, but in a nice, warming way like you would in a wine. The beer is thick and velvety, super pleasant, and well enjoyed."
"D - Although the brilliance of this brew is in its balance, which is a more sophisticated illusionist than Dan Brown - or dare I say it, Houdini himself - the one thing it can't do is fool you for long. After mustering the discipline to leave more than a millisecond between each sip, you finally come down to earth and realize its true weight is more than most people can handle beyond the first bottle. Of course, for those of us with less self-restraint, there's always the issue of 9% and real gravity to act as a secondary natural check, and lliterally bring you down to earth by less gracious means."
"Could this be the perfect IPA?"
"An absolutely exquisite beer. Big in smell, taste and mouthfeel but combined it just all binds together to form one of the nicest IPAs I have ever tasted. Please Sir, may I have some more?"
"D-High drink-ability. Could drink this all day if it was not for that 9.0 ABV. 2 or 3 of these and you will have yourself feeling alright!"
"Had this beer last nights, poured out exceptional with beautiful color. Poured into a large opening wine glass which allowed enough room for breating and the scent to be taken in, which was fairly light but nice aromas. Taste on my tongue was smooth just enough action. Flavors were mild, and not overwhelming. Very easy to drink, I could enjoy this beer often."
"D - Easily drinkable. High ABV isn't really noticeable past the smell. Not a great session beer due to the ABV and the price though."
"The abv. is all that keeps this from being an all night drinker, CUZ it delivers on a sooo many levels. These folk can brew!"
"D - This is a good beer, but its far from """the best""" as they claim on the packaging. I enjoy it but think there are many better examples in the style."
"D - If facing the chair this might be my last meal."
"D - Very good drinkability"
"Overall, it's not a glamorous beer, but if someone was asking me to introduce them to IPA/DIPAs/etc, DFH 90 Minute would certainly be one of the ones I would recommend. Just a very good beer."
"And the taste, well, citrus, hops, malts, fruity, and all in a perfect balance. My favorite at the moment! I hope one of my American BA friends will bring me 12 bottles, he can have 12 westy 12 for it without any hesitation! (only cause I have enough ;-)"
"D-Fairly drinkable DIPA is flavorful and balenced. Not as bitter as I would have liked but not a local brew so who knows how it travels? Better choices available to me.(Dreadnaught,Hop Juice,Ruination,Arctic Panzer Wolf,etc.)"
"IPA's are not at the top of my list. This is a pretty good beer though."
"D: An amazing beer, the continual hop method is shown in all its glory in this brew."
"Pours a dark orangy/amber with slightly off white head. Head is about a finger high, recedes quickly and leaves some decent lacing as it goes. Scent is oily, dank, hops and murky (in a good way) malts. Taste is also very earthy. Not what I expected from a DIPA, focuses more on flavor than extreme bitterness. Not the hop bomb I expected but still has enough bitterness and minty/earthy hop to justify the classification. Nice malt backbone throughout. Medium bodied with a clean finish. I don't agree with Kerry Byrne's opinion that this is """perhaps the best IPA in America", but definitely a nice offering. If you're looking for a hop bomb you will be disappointed; however, if you want a strong, flavorful, IPA this is your beer."
"Feel on palate is decent, a very free feeling beer. Drinkability is very high, you could take big swigs of this without any ill-effects (other than the 9%)."
"The carbonation is just right, and cleanses the palate from sweetness of this medium bodied brew. Very drinkable considering the body and alchohol content. And an excellent beer with food."
"Drinkability- This is a very drinkable beer."
"DFH has always been held dear to my heart due to it's proximity and the DFH Alehouse near me. :) 90 minute is one of my favorites from DFH. I always enjoy it on tap or by bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a medium amber color with 1-finger off-white head that lingers for a bit and masks the aroma initially. Good lacing on the glass. Aroma is fruity hops, a bit of citrus fruit similar to a witbier, perhaps raisins, very faint hint of pine. Mouthfeel is very thick like a stout, a bit creamy. Flavor begins with fruity hops, smoke, pine, caramel malted barley. Trails off with building bitterness of hops, alcohol, pine, and a faint hint of citrus hops. Definitely a complex shifting of flavors in the aftertaste. One of my favorite DIPAs from DFH."
"Excellent beer."
"If I had to pick something to quibble about, it would be the smell. I'm not head-over-heels for it. But the finished product is very impressive; I wouldn't change a thing."
"Pours a 1 finger off-white head that fades pretty quick to a small ring of lacing. I would have like to see a bit more lacing. Very clear amber body. Smells quite complex, bubble gum, citrus, carmel sweet malty. Tastes sweet, citrus, some vanilla, carmel, lemon, toffee. Taste goes from sweet to bitter lemon, to a neutral wet carmel finish. I think I could have a few of these in a night. Medium low carbing, medium thin body. $4.00 a singe (Ouch) at table and vine in MA."
"D: For an imperial IPA this will grab you by the balls. The balance DFH crafted in this beer astounds me every time."
"Drinkability: The high ABV inhibits the drinkability a little bit but the hoppy flavor leaves you wanting more and more."
"D: I can see why this is popular, but just not my thing. Goes down well for a 9% though. Would not buy again, but may drink if available."
"Mouthfeel is rich without being overly thick. Quite drinkable for a IIPA."
"Chad"
"The CPJ"
"Notes: dont try to convert a stout drinker over to this hoppy beer... Start with something a little tame... This is the only reason I can think this doesn't have a near perfect score... People who say this goes good with food... I would recomend a thirsty friend to share this with before a meal.. Goes really bitter with any food I've tried."
"Medium body beer, with a decent amount of carbonation contributing to a clean tongue after each sip. Not much of an aftertaste, maybe some feint citrus sweetness."
"This bottle was acquired from the Asia Beer Fest 2010 in Singapore"
"D: This a dangerous brew. I could find myself easily enjoying two or three, as the ABV is very well hidden. Certainly not a session beer though. This is a must for anyone who enjoys DIPA's like I do. Dollar for dollar, I will stick with the 60 minute version though. Well struck Dogfish Head Brewery, well struck. Also, thier Brew Masters TV show on the Discovery Channel is a must see for those craft beer lovers. Between my monthly BA magazine and their TV show, I am a happy craft beer lover!!"
"DFH 90 into DFH Globe @ 47*. Pours dark golden with a off white head. Smell is floral with a touch of sweetness to back it up, not too common in a IIPA. Taste is almost cloying sweet with slight hop notes. I'm not sure whats going on with this beer but it's just not on par with other examples of the style. I got a deal on a 4pk @ $7.99 so I figured I'd see what all the hype was about. I cant understand why the package is labeled as being """One of the best IPA's in America", when this beer is more closely related to Red Brick's Brown Ale. Overall I guess it was a """ok""" buy.. Not really impressed, seeing as there are way better examples of the style out there. I'd pass this one up when looking for a nice IIPA. Southern Tier's XIPA blows this beer away by all means. I just think that DFH is a big fad now and on the verge of being a house trend. I'm still glad I've got eight Bitch's Brew's, I'll be selling those in 2yrs for $100+ LOL!"
"It's the taste. Not that its bad; it's different. I suspect the huge malt infusion along with a hop blend that is likely different than the 3 C's and Simcoe that predominate West Coast varieties, creates this taste. In a nutshell, the taste is sweet raisiny (almost prunish) hop/malt flavor, so predominate that it muzzles the hop bitterness. The taste is so distinct, that in a blind test of IPA's, I can't imagine not distinguishing this beer."
"Bright honey coloring in the body but the head was a bit disappointing. The pour was fairly aggressive but still with no results. Smell is very sticky sweet honeysuckle with a twist of pineapple. Not the least bit bitter in the nose. This is a very rich, malty smelling IPA. Last 2 times I had this I was quite let down. And I mean one from this current four pack I am drinking now. Bottled on 12/17/10 so it is pretty damn fresh. First beer of the night so I am able to take time with it. This is much more bitter than I recall. Not as sickening sweet either. Could be because it is fairly cold. But there is quite a hop bite with huge pineapple and some sour green apple. I can sense the caramel like malts but they are subdued a bit to the cold. The aftertaste is something I don't care for. The sweetness linger far after the bitterness but I do like it more than the first time I had it. If it weren't for the sweetness I could see drinking a fair bit of these. All in all a solid IPA but I still get why it is so great to most people."
"D - Alcohol is not nearly as evident in this as it could be. Very high db."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I'm not a hophead by any stretch of the imagination, but this is a pretty darn drinkable IPA. Yeah, it's bitter, but it's still got a good balance of hops and malts. You'll feel that hefty alcohol though, so make sure you pace yourself."
"MF: For an imp. IPA, has a relatively mild body, allowing for increased sessionability."
"Overall this is one of the best beers that's become easy to find in most of my area - I always try to have a few in reserve..."
"A superb beer - top notch. A taste that isn't to be forgotten quickly. Not something for everyday, but one to be savoured on special occasions. Deserves to be recorded among the world's finest."
"Drinkability: Very high for the style and abv, the taste helps greatly. But it is not too harsh on the palate."
"An extreme beer for hop-heads only."
"Pours a super clear, light golden amber. Just a few slow carb trailers. A thick off-white head patches to everything. Smell is a hop cone, bright and floral, perfumy even.. Taste is very sweet with an underlying burn of bitterness. The malt is heavy in this one.. Aftertaste is long and enduring, with a bit of alcohol burn. Feels smooth overall, though. Easy to drink. Very good - a good balance of a ton of hops and a ton of malt."
"Blissful. This is just a really great beer. I could sit here and pontificate on the color, aroma, taste, etc. but couldn't do it justice. This is the beer that introduced me to Dogfish head and I am a convert. This isn't a beer to sit back an throw down a few cold ones with your buds (which is what I generally like to do) I actually buy this to savor it. Pairs great with a good steak or a nice thick chop."
"D - I would love to drink it all night, though it would end me in bed without remembering how I got there... Its got a sneaky kick"
"Overall very drinkable, but a bit disappointing for a """huge""" IPA as far as hop flavor is concerned."
"This beer has a bitter after-taste to me. I took several mouthfuls of it, to give a fair try, but I could not get over the bitterness. The color is welcoming, the smell hit me with the hops, which equaled the bitter taste that I got. After trying this and the 60 minute, I soon realized that IPAs were not for me."
"D - A well crafted brew, although the flavours are quite one-dimensional."
"Wunderful beer and recommendation to everyone! Just remember that this is not your everyday IPA. Prost!"
"It's been a while since I've indulged in one o' these bad boys. It pours a clear copper-amber topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises mandarin oranges, grapefruit (both ruby red and ... yellow?), light pine, sweet caramel, and a pinch of powdered sugar. The taste holds notes of strong orange peel and grapefruit; this sits atop a mountain of rich, sweet caramel, providing a lovely dichotomy for my 'buds. The body is a wavering medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly sticky feel. Overall, a very nice DIPA, one of the standards of the industry."
"D: For an IIPA, this is extremely drinkable. The hops really don't overpower you."
"Really delicious beer that I'll certainly have again in the near future."
"I usually buy a case of this beer when I visit the brewery. Its just that good. Also great when run through Randall. It decreases the carbonation and increases the head, but it packs a nice punch of fresh hops!"
"Great color with low(ish) carbonation. Sweeter than most double IPAs, but also very balanced and perhaps too easy to drink (I've had a notable bad experience or two...). Floral above all with hints of pine and citrus. VERY malty with an almost raisin-ish finish. Really solid beer that comes through time and again."
"Pours a nice clear amber color with two fingers of off white head. Smells very hoppy with hints of grapefruit and citrus. Taste is smoother than expected with a good mixture of hops and malt, although you can definitely taste the alcohol. Mouthfeel is very nice and clean. Good allaround IPA."
"Overall I enjoyed this beverage quite a bit and would recommend it to any IPA enthusiast."
"Overall, I've had this beer many times on draft and from a bottle and I just feel it's overrated. Every time I bust out $10 for a 4-pack thinking it'll be different and my tastebuds have gained refinement, I'm always disappointed. There are so many other better variations of a DIPA. I'm an east coast guy and I hate saying it, but stick with west coast IPAs such as Stone or Lagunitas."
"All in all, I would drink it over most, but I would like to see a larger variety of noble hops, and a little back off with the malts, and it would be a competitor."
"i IPA's are great because they tend to be very complex. the thing that shocked me about the 90min IPA is the fact that compared to most it is extremly drinkable for an IPA. it is very piney with a good bit of citrus. i found it very smooth. the aroma is great. this is a very good IPA."
"12oz bottle. Pours a somewhat murky amber color with a medium sized frothy head. Good amount of lacing. Excellent aroma. Big whiff of hops. Citrusy with a hint of pineapple. Smells a bit boozey. Taste is hops, citrus, bitter and delicious. Very little taste of alcohol considering the ABV. Drinkable and one of the better Imperial IPAs out there."
"Overall this is a bit sweeter than most IPAs and has less hop aromatics but it is well balanced and easy drinking (for it's strength)."
"This is an amazing beer but I can't afford to drink it all the time!"
"D: Moderate. High abv is the only thing working against it."
"This is so drinkable! I will definitely have repeated imbibings of this beer over time. I have never been disappointed by this beer and its groovy yumminess. The hop and malt combination is phenomenal and I daresay that I could have several in a sitting. Oh, snap!"
"D- Dangerously drinkable for a 9%. This is a great DIPA!"
"You can taste the love in here-LOL!"
"D- As I stated before I have had this IPA a number of times, this is a staple in my beer diet."
"Conclusion: nice beer but overrated, does not end well and there are better examples of this style out there"
"D-Incredible, even at 9% it's so easy to throw these back, making for a dangerous but o so worth it combination"
"Fantastically drinkable, These will most assuredly find their way back into my fridge"
"The 9% ABV makes this beer dangerous. Very dangerous. Mostly because it's so good on top of being so potent. Consider yourself lucky if you find it on tap. I was lucky enough to find it on tap. On 2 for 1 pitcher night. It kicked my ass and I was thankful."
"I tried this one after seeing Dogfish Head on Beer Wars. It has a nice fruity aroma. Has a deep amber color that is slightly cloudy. The carbonation has a nice zing to your tongue. Perhaps it's me but the taste just doesn't do much for me. The taste seems a bit fruity but sour. This is my third bottle because I wanted to be sure I wasn't missing something after all the rave reviews I've seen about this one. To be honest I'm disappointed in this one. It isn't bad but I doubt I'd go out of my way to have this one again."
"On tap at The Office. Pours golden to amber in color with a lasting, off-white head. Great aroma is of citrusy hops and some juicy malts. Very crisp, medium body. Pleasant hops flavors are well balanced by sweetness of malt. Complex, well balanced, perfect beer."
"Fantastically drinkable, I'm happy that I have some more of these left in the fridge!"
"Scary drinkable at 9%ABV. Carbonation  stings the tip of the tongue each sip. Very refreshing. Alcohol is well hidden. Wouldn't hesitate to have a couple in one sitting."
"Always a pleasure to drink this one. Thank you DFH. You changed my perspective on beer with this one."
"Overall, I do like this beer and I would love to try it on tap. I don't agree with it being, perhaps the best IPA in America, as it mentions on the box; it's good, but ain't damn good."
"Drinkability is low, it feels like I'm drinking a 12% beer. I don't want to have more than one of these (Actually I'd prefer not to have any)."
"Dogfish Head's motto is """Off centered ales for off centered people""". The 90 minute IPA is a good beer, make no mistakes about it. I feel that it leaves the drinker wanting and expecting more. It pours a very nice copper, but with little head and lacing. It has a nice nose but is unfulfilled. Its taste is very good but not quite hoppy enough for an IPA with 9% abv. Mouthfeel and finish are both very good but could be better."
"D: Very drinkable for the style... Its a bit of a """spicy""" double IPA (due to both the hops and alcohol), but very well balanced and oh so smooth on the finish. Probably one of my favorite double IPA's... and perhaps favorite Dogfish Head brew so far!"
"Overall - Best IPA ive ever had so far. Full of flavor, strong, complex, but yet i understand everything DFH is trying to do with this beer...and i appreciate that."
"Very good IPA that differs in from the West Coast versions mostly in the flavors of the hops and in presence of the malt. The hops in this beer are less citrusy and more peachy and there is a nice malt balance that the West Coast IPAs lack. I think i just found my favorite IPA."
"4's across the board for this brew. It was really nice and I really appreciated the malt backbone on this brew. This can stand up to many other Double IPA's but just isn't quite at the top of the pile. It is still very good and I will definitely buy this again, especially when it is fresh."
"The taste is relatively clean and hop forward. The pine comes through again... though I personally would like to see some more citrus here. The beer finishes surprisingly sweet, almost bordering on cloying at times. The hops and malt balance each other well, but I'm not overly impressed with either. The beer's depth is what gives it the higher score in taste relative to mouthfeel and drinkability, but I'm just not overly impressed. I'll drink the rest of the 4 pack, but I won't be overjoyed to do it."
"Overall this was impressive for the style of beer. Its best qualities are appearance and wonderful aroma. Taste and drinkability are a little challenging but tolerable."
"Conclusion- This is by far the best IPA I've had- still not a huge fan of IPAs, but at least I know now that not all IPAs are like drinking a glassful of urine lol- I can honestly say I will enjoy the rest of my glass, but that will be it. Drinkability not very high. I would give this beer a 3 1/2 because it made me enjoy an IPA, but at the same time its still an IPA, and I know there are other beers that I would choose over this one."
"D - Very good drinkability for its high abv. Still a good beer for it being about 4 months old, although imo the hops were barely recognizable. Almost didnt even seem like an IIPA. Want to try get a fresh one less than a month old."
"D- I really enjoy this example of an IPA. Easy to recommend."
"Notes: This is a very solid beer. Nothing about it blew me away. It is a solid DIPA, but I believe that it is way over hyped. Maybe I just had too high of expectations for this beer. It was very solid and I would drink it again, but as for my expectations for it, this one was a bit of a let down."
"D-I prefer the 60 minute. Couldn't drink a lot of these, but it is a solid beer."
"The more I drink the 90 min IPA, the more I enjoy it."
"Overall, a great IPA, not extremely drinkable in mass quantity, but definitely enjoyable"
"Another quality dfh product. May not be the best, but u know you won't be disappointed."
"It starts smooth not harsh and quickly the hops enter flowers citrus and grassy tastes overwhelm a sublet sweet malt without an intense bitter finish"
"Drinkability is low because it just wasn't all that good. The hops were very muted, and the beer was just plain boring. I wanted this beer to be good, but I flat out did not enjoy it. Maybe I'll revisit someday, but it will be hard with so many other IPA's available."
"Drinkability: Although this is a well-made IPA, I can only enjoy this one a night. I'm a smaller guy and even with a good burger, I still get very sleepy after due to the ABV. Overall, I'll be buying this one again."
"One finger of foam from my pour. Lacing is spider web like with lots of cling. Color is a 15 on the SRM beer color chart with a slight cloudiness. Aroma of citrus, banana, and roasted wheat. Flavors I detect include pine hops, lime and lemon peel, grapefruit, some malt and roasted wheat. Full body presence in my mouth, goodly amount of zing. Good refreshing beer with lots of flavor and crispness. More of this on the horizon."
"D-Again, not my favorite beer to just sit down and enjoy on its own. When I paired with food such as a nice pork tenderloin it really went well. Didn't really notice the 9% abv."
"D: Drinks easier than would be expected from a 9%. Being a hop lover who drinks predominantly stronger beers, I could drink a few of these pretty easy."
"D: A complex, stimulating brew, high alcohol content and medium body limit session drinking"
"D: Perfect stape go to IPA. The hops don't take over your mouth allowing you to enjoy a few of these at a time."
"Deep copper, tight head and good lacing. Some serious piney hop resin but I'm surprised by how forward the malt is. A fair bit of caramel brittle like notes. On the palate this is a ripper. Decadent, sweet bitter and full-on. The flavours hit every corner of your mouth and all sides of your tongue finishing long. Would definitely pick this up again if it was available easily, locally."
"All day at work today I was had a hankering for some hops. So I stopped and grabbed this guy on my way home. Poured into a tulip. The beer pours light amber with a thin layer of white head with good sticky lacing. The aroma is a big pine/cut grass pine aroma with notes of tropical fruit and a slight malt backbone peaking through. It's downright difficult to get my nose out this beer. My fist sip completely assaults my taste buds with bitter and dry piney hops. After a short recovery a nice balanced malt presence is noticeable. The mouthfeel is a little rugged, nice body but I think big hop bombs like this tend to be aggressive on the pallet (I know how obvious that is). Overall the drinkability is nice, the ABV slows me down a bit but this one is a solid go-to IPA for myself."
"Poured into a stein. Has a red-amber color hue. Smaller head than I expected but still nice. It also leaves a nice lace on the glass. The smell of hops starts bold but not as strong as other beers in this class and slightly herbal. The taste is mildly sweeter than I expected but malty and finishes slightly spicy. Slightly syrupy and smooth, the mouthfeel is pleasing."
"Overall: Excellent. I might be wrong, but I could do for a bit more hops..."
"12 oz into a snifter. Good lacy head that billows and puffs before beginning to subside. Aroma is extremely hoppy but softer than the really big boys of this style, Ruination and Hop Stoopid come to mind with their 100 level IBUs. Alcohol is very well hidden. What strikes me about this beer is the balance-, it is exceptionally aligned. Best IPA/DIPA in America? No, but I'd put it in the top ten, which is significant. If you don't have a great local IPA or don't have access to a store with a diverse selection, this might be the default great IPA that is available, as I've even been seeing Dogfish Head in chain groceries lately. Highly recommended."
"For a beer with as many hops as this one has, you would expect it to be super bitter and dry but It's just the opposite. I have never drank this stuff below room temp. This stuff starts off very fruity with barley wine like qualities and finishes spicy. This beer is very full bodied and would be a nice addition to your Christmas Parties or Summer Cookouts. This stuff is perfect."
"Since the label mentions something about it being the best beer in the world, I've made a habit of snagging a 4-pack from the local retailer from time to time. Because of the syrupy maltiness (and I mean this in a good way), I usually can handle just one 12 ouncer... and then chase it with a Racer 5. Overall, a good representation of an IPA with equal parts malt and hops."
"drinkability: a prime example of the style, it has all of the necessary elements: fresh & clean, higher abv, and sensational development of the hops; naturally being stronger will bar one from drinking in quantity, but if you are looking for quality, it will be very pleasing."
"Drinkability: Very nice beer, easy to drink and could do so with pleasure. However for my tastes and pocketbook I would likely choose something else to have around on a regular basis."
"Drinkability is alright for a 9% ABV beer but it doesn't seem like a DIPA."
"All in all a 4.5 out of 5 for me."
"Yum, haven't had it in a while. Glowing copper color with one finger white head. Aroma is some what muted, but its there, familiar sticky hops, pinapple, tropical fruits, citrus. Good balance here. Some crystal malt, clean yeast flavor, piney citrusy hops, great juicyness. Fantastic body, real chewy for such a light colored beer. Alcohol is hidden very well and this beer goes down with ease."
"D - Very high. I could have several of these. I will have to add this one to my regular rotation."
"D - Another quality beer by Dogfish head; full impact of flavors and aromas from start to finish; I would recommend to other looking for well-balanced beer filled with character"
"D: For the most part, the alcohol is well masked, which makes this beer not that difficult to drink."
"Pours a burnt orangey copper with a nice white creamy head. Aroma of floral citrusy hops, sweet spices. Taste is floral citrusy hops with some sweet malt. Palate is full body, good carbonation, and nice smooth mouth feel. Finish is bitter floral citrus hops, but not overpowering, balanced by some sweet caramel maltiness. Overall a very nicely balanced, complex, drinkable and flavorfull brew"
"The color of this beer reminds me of a copper color. WIth a white head. The aroma is a very strong pungent smell of citrus hops, delicious! The taste is of a malty sweetness, balanced well with a citrus hop flavor bitterness and aroma. The mouthfeel is medium, and the carbonation is slightly fizzy. Overall I would consider this drinkable!"
"Pours a amber orange color with nice white foam head. Has an aroma of citrus, caramel, and pine. Has a sweet nutty taste with a creamy mouth feel. Nice malt backbone."
"D. Easy drinking DIPA. A bit sweet and not quite as bitter or hoppy as I like in a DIPA. That being said this is a nice alternative to some of the big tongue bruising bitter hop bombs. A good beer."
"It does not have the complexity of the Rogue XS I2PA, but then again, that is on another plane altogether."
"This beer lives up to its reputation, its a big, bold, DIPA that really stands out from the crowd."
"D-Exceptionally balanced beer and hands down my favorite DIPA, its pretty rare not to find it in my fridge. I personally dont think its as hoppy as most people have described it, but to each his/her own."
"Drink- Not bad, not bad at all. Better than the 60 which I was hoping for and a pretty good beer all on its own. I am starting to see why people like DFH, this was only my 4th one."
"D - i enjoyed this one a bit more than the 60, but this one might be a bit tougher to pound one after the other since it is so strong, but delicious."
"D: An Ipa that puts itself away from the rest, definitely one of the best Dogfish beers out."
"--Had another bottle. It was better for some reason - I may have drank it too warm before. Alcohol finish was more manageble for me which helped the taste and drinkability - so I'm upping the score."
"I had a 2nd bottle that was far better than the first. Excellent piney-woody hops and very well balanced with the malts. Didn't have that lingering bitterness present in the first bottle, and didn't need to be consumed at room temp. I'll give a bump to the taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Session Beer Festival stein. A nice golden pale colour with 1 inch of head that held on to the glass and stuck to the side the entire time. Smells quite piney with citrus and traces of alcohol. The taste is so well balanced in terms of bitterness and malt and it finishes with a thin alcohol finish that is not overpowering and actually very nice, outstanding. Very nice mouthfeel, though I thought it would be a little thicker but I wouldn't say it was thin though. This drinks like a dream, I wish this was available in Canada. Really glad I got to try this, another gem from DFH."
"Slight creaminess but not too thick. Crisp. Very Drinkable, though with the ABV, you should be careful. Overall, this is a great beer. I enjoyed it. This my first in this style, Imperial IPA which is known for a its bitter hop taste, that I've had and thought the hop bite was refreshing."
"D: Unlike any other DIPA I have ever had. Phenomenal aroma and flavor, but not for long term imbibing."
"Reviewed this on tap now reviewing it out of the bottle. It smells like that piney hop smell that I'd expect out of a nicely hopped IPA plus with some fruit smells probably from the mixture of hops they use and the fruity yeast strain. The taste is that piney and citrus fruit flavor combined with a thicker more robust roasted malt flavor than the 60 minute. It still has that same malt flavor just a lot more of it so it comes off as richer tasting. The hops leave a nice resinous bite that mixes in with the citrus hops they use and that fruity alcohol yeast thing they have going on. This beer is amazing and one of the best tasting and ridiculously balanced Imperial IPA's ever. On tap it had a bit more bite but I'm sure if you get this super fresh in the bottle it will have that same effect. All in all one of my favorite beers of all time."
"D - Not the easiest beer to drink, but it's fairly smooth and really enjoyable."
"D: I reach for this anytime I'm in the mood for a fruity yet bitter IPA. Never disappoints."
"D. This DIPA is a wonderful beer, but not for the casual beer drinker. This is a beer made for real IPA fans pushing the limits of hop fullness with their continual hopping technique. At 90 IBU's, it is bitter, yet balanced. This is my favorite beer I have had this year."
"D= A good/great beer for sure but the hot alcohol booziness that fades in and out takes away from the drinkability for me. Still, its packed with delicious hop flavor that has me revisiting this one fairly often."
"Drinkability: I had no problem finishing the bottle. There just wasn't enough interest in opening another in one sitting. I'll take the more sessionable 60 minute IPA over this. A respectable beer none the less."
"It tastes smooth and medium-bodied. 90 Minute is pretty sweet compared to most doulbe IPAs but very drinkable. The alcohol is well-hidden. A great IPA for Fathers Day!"
"This Beer tastes like the 9% ABV it boasts, No mistake. it's also definitely not a west coast IPA. I kinda with there was more hop presence. Great for Winter and other cold weather."
"Edit: I should note, in light of all the recent controversy about grey market US imports, that the bottle reviewed was one. I'm keeping the review up because I have had both the bottled 60 and 90-minute IPAs on their native soil and the impressions I had of the bottles I purchased in Australia conform to those I had previously. The 60-min was great both times, the 90 muddled and disappointing."
"Overall: This is a great East Coast DIPA. You can tell that their intention was to balance out the hops and hide the alcohol and in that regard it was an absolute success. Hopheads won't go gaga for this one, but that's not its purpose; its an easy drinking, malty, high ABV DIPA and a damn good one at that."
"D- A nice IPA, but a little too neutral for me. Nothing bold or exciting just a good all around beer. Not my favorite nor would I ever pass on a bottle if offered."
"Drink-ability - I want some more!"
"The only part of this beer that could lose any points would be in the drinkability of he brew. It's an amazing brew, with a high ABV. For those who can do a second of these, I am sure it wouldn't take much for them to do so. This is another great brew by Dogfish Head, I will continue to seek more there brews."
"D: This is good stuff. Could def. drink a few of these in one sitting!"
"Very, very impressed. When I saw this and DFH's 60 min. IPA side by side at Santori's Liquors in Lansing, IL, I opted for the 90 min and I was not disappointed."
"D: Extremely strong drinking brew, really makes you want to take another sip but its almost like a heavy weight fight because it beats your taste buds and brain up so much with every sip"
"Pours a nice copper color, with 2 fingers of off white head which leaves some nice sticky lacing throughout consumption. Surprisingly, the malt profile is the most prominent feature in the aromas, caramel and toffee scents, with just a hint of citrus hops. Malt forward in the taste too, with the hops finally showing themselves with a bitter, crisp finish. I prefer a much more hop forward profile in my IPAs & DIPAs, so this didn't do a whole lot for me, or blow me away like i thought it would (actually prefer the 60 Minute)."
"Everytime I have a 90 Minute, it's a completely different experience. I don't mean that in a negative way.. great offering from Dogfish Head."
"Had on draft at Pazzo's Pizz Pub in lex ky, Appearance is a nice light coppery hue with a tight small white that retained for the length of the beer and left nice lacings after each sip. Smell is dominated by the hops herbal citrusy piney all the wonderful hop smells that you would expect out od DIPA. Taste is bitter citrus and pine hops with a sweet malt backbone but the hop stays through from start to finish. Mouthfeel is clean and sharp, balanced carbaonation lends itself to the hops. For as strong as this beer is, it is easiably drinkable, and one of my go to's on hot summer afternoons when on tap."
"A seriously tasty DIPA, but deserves a lighter body to let the hops shine."
"taste was a bit strong at first, but quickly got used to it and the beer only became tastier as i went on. overall, well balanced and fairly easy to drink after a few sips. very tasty."
"Pours a very beautiful dark amber color with a small head that dissipates and leaves a tiny ring at the top around the edge of this beautiful beverage. The head also leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass as well. It smells good, but I thought the hops were gonna stand out more. I also smell Caramel or Toffee. Really I think it smells pretty much like the 60 minute just a little stronger. Go figure. Taste is a amazing citrus hops that nice and present. good malty caramel taste, and a little bite of alcohol come in before the finish. Nice carbonation with a medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable beer. This is definitely one of my go to beers, it's just a great overall beer. I strongly recomend this beer to anyone. The only thing I would say that could improve it a little bit is that I wish there was just a little more kick from the hops. Great beer though. Way to go again DFH."
"Serving type: Bottle"
"pours a clear, dark amber color with a sizable white head and excellent lacing. plenty of tiny carbonation bubbles flow from bottom to the top. piney hops direct in the smell with a slight malt backdrop. direct bitterness in the taste with sweetness from the malt coming through as well. although the bitterness is upfront, it quickly subsides and leaves little aftertaste from this light bodied brew. overall very drinkable, I always enjoy a 90 minute not so much for mind blowing hoppiness, but more for being solid as fairly consistent."
"Recently had this on tap and it was so so much better. Tried it Randalled and not Randalled and it was amazing both ways. I guess I just don't love it in the bottle. I've bumped my scores up a bit to reflect my new thought. Try this beer on draft, Randalled if you can (It really intensifies the hops, making the beer a great display of hops)"
"Time to step things up a notch and try out the Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA. I've been holding onto this one for a couple of weeks but I figured I'd better drink it before it loses the majority of its hop characteristics. Pours kind of a tangelo orange brown, with very little head. Granted, I'm using a snifter for this one so I wasn't really looking for a big ass head. I might use a tumbler if I come across one of these again. Nose is an incredible detonation of hop aroma. Floral and citrus hops are there and there's this raisin sent underneath, almost like what you'd get out of a dark Belgian strong ale. Kind of surprising, actually. My first impressions while taking my sample is dang, this beer is smooth. It's very full, almost thick, with a slight alcohol burn in the finish. It's more well rounded and less sharp than the 60 minute IPA, especially in the finish. There's hops here, to be sure, and we'll catalog those in a moment, but I think it's important to note I actually think this may be less bitter than the 60 minute IPA. Either that, or the assload of malt that's in this lends a huge sweetness that helps you push through the bitterness. I mentioned the Belgian Strong earlier when talking aroma, and that comparison is valid when talking about the mouthfeel. It's thick, bordering on syrupy. Huge sticky lacing just coats the glass. Raisins are there in the taste too. It's extremely malt centric, with a roasted caramel syrup note that really sticks out for me. The hops are most certainly there in this one, with pine and orange rind coming out the more that you drink it. They're not as pronounced as I would like. Not sure if that's what the brewer intended, or because this one sat on the shelf for a while before I picked it up. Regardless, this is one phenomenal beer. As I said I'm not completely sold on it being a double IPA, but it's very good nonetheless."
"This is outstanding with food especially steaks (like ribeyes or NY strip) or burgers. Also great with Buffalo chicken sandwiches or wings."
"d - A great DIPA that is around year round and I've had many times. Fresh it is a great beer and the smell is wonderful. Will definitely have again."
"Smells of citrus, grapefruit hops. Some pine and floral notes. Malty base. The taste is a rich experience of the nose, smooth cirtus hop on the sip followed by a real pleasing warm sweet grapefruit finish. Taste is malty in the middle, english style, somewhat boozy. Medium mouthfeel, its great on the palatte. Overall, the 90 min IIPA from Dogfish Head is really drinkable, I regret not grabbing another 4 pack."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. I've heard many people say they prefer the 60 Minute IPA to this one, but I'm not in that camp. Both are great beers but this is near the head of the class. I would highly recommend this one."
"D: Good, but since I like mine to pop with hop & grapefruit, probably won't be my go-to IPA. But enjoyable!"
"Overall a fairly strong brew with good hop bite, malt sweetness, and citrus notes all tied together very nicely! Good blend, 9% abv not so apparent. I'd have it again! Sweet notes and alcohol are more present as it warms up."
"Cheers!"
"D - Very drinkable, despite the high ABV."
"Not being a huge IPA fan, I enjoyed this, and I will go back to it."
"This is a very good IPA, but not my favourite. It's actually a very approachable IPA and would be a good choice for people who find IPAs a bit too bitter."
"D- deceptively drinkable for its ABV, just downright good!"
"D - after a while it seems to be more sweet than bitter and hinders drinkability."
"12oz. bottle poured into an oversized tulip. Pours a rich golden amber with a bit of haze. A thin creamy head dissipates but leaves some lacing. A ring of foam clings to the sides of the glass the whole way down. The aroma is citrus hops and honey. Tastes of sweet malt, ruby red grapefruit and alcohol. The mouthfeel is a little thick and sticky but with a nice level of carbonation. In terms of drinkability, I find this a little too sweet and boozy. I'd prefer a dfh 60 but maybe if I could get this a little fresher, I'd change my mind."
"This beer pours an amber color with a small head but stayed through out. Has a hoppy smell, but not to strong. The flavor has also hoppy but dosnt have a sharp bit, very full flavor but also very smooth finishs wth a great hoppy taste. Its actually very easy to drink. Overall a great beer, must try."
"one of the greatest ipas i have every had and will continue to great it regurlarly"
"If you are afraid of hoppy beers, you probably aren't going to like this one. If not and you haven't tried DH 90 minute yet, what on earth are you waiting for??!!?!"
"D - This is an unusual example of the style; I think of it as a Strong Ale more than a DIPA, honestly, but it is delectable nonetheless."
"Had this from a bottle, poured into a pint glass. There is a surprising amount of carbonation for a double IPA, nice foamy head that subsided relatively quickly but it was present nonetheless. Right away the hops hit you, it opens up to some interesting citrus rind flavors and it's surprisingly wet for a beer of this alcohol content. Yet the bitterness just overwhelms everything. I'm still a n00b beer drinker but I can't help but feel like the bitterness of the hops just overwhelms the malt and any pine flavors, it just sort of ends up feeling really heavy. One thing I have to say though is that the alcohol is hidden quite well. I guess the hops just sort of cover up the high alcohol content and honestly, I was surprised that i put away nearly the whole bottle so fast, which just shows it's relatively easy to drink. There are better IIPAs out there but this one grows on you the more you drink."
"Bottled on 05/04/2010. Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured hazy red-orange with a three finger off-white head that subsided to two finger slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pine hops, and grapefruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus hops, and grapefruit. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew has an excellent flavor and aroma to it. There is just something about it that I love. Glad that Dogfish Head is readily available in my area again as this is my new drinking beer when there is nothing else I want to have in the fridge. It is totally worth trying for those of you who have not."
"Notes: I love hoppy beers, but lets be honest, theres no better way to enjoy them than fresh at the brewery, or somewhere on tap. The longer you let them sit the mellower they become. This has only been bottled slightly over a month ago, yet I feel this may have mellowed some. I doubt I'm building a tolerance to hops. Still a great choice for a DIPA, don't know if I'd buy a case though just because I'd feel rushed to enjoy the best of it."
"My current favorite IIPA. Pours a beautifully clear dark orange/amber color with a very nice head which does dissipate quickly due to the relatively high gravity. Some slight lacing. The aroma is incredibly enticing - very sweet with a slight hint of hops and citrusy notes. The taste is a perfect blend of nice hop bitterness with a tasty malt backbone, achieving a near perfect blend of bitterness and sweet maltiness. The alcohol is a little present, but masked very well by the tasty blended components. A true winner in my book."
"The first Dogfish Head beer I ever had...It didn't disappoint..Earthy aroma, clean sensation with mild fruitiness Appearance: Deep copper color, some haze, off white head, with medium lacing and mild carbonation Flavor: Complex hop profile, well balanced between the hoppiness and malt back bone, low fruitiness Mouth feel: Crisp feel on the tongue, medium-full body, medium dry finish, mile residual mouth feel (body) in the after taste Overall Impression: Classic balance between the high hoppiness and malt back bone. It is a very drinkable a beer and a joy to drink."
"Used a snifter for this one, pours a nice golden orange brew with a medium white crown. Enticing hops, pine, barley aromas with no alcohol percieved. This brew its crazy balanced. On the palate the medley of hops, and barley its great. The hops greet you intensly at the beggining and the barley brings the brew to its great aftertaste. Very refreshing with great drinkability for a 9%abv brew."
"This is the 4th time I've had this beer and the malt always surprises me. I always thought from looking at reviews that this would be all hop and little malt. This beer is quite balance with the malt presence almost having a slight edge over the hops presence. Although this time the beer seemed to be significantly less hoppy that the previous three. The first 2 ties the lacing was incredible. The last 2 weren't that great. The bottle says 8/20/10 so it makes it less less than 2 months old. I don't know. Seems a little different every time."
"D: For being an Imperial IPA, it is really smooth and easy to drink. I think most good quality IPAs taste the same but this one separates itself and does not taste like all the rest. This is definitely my favorite IPA. If it were only a little cheaper I would have it all the time!"
"this is damn drinkable and damn delicious"
"The 90 Minute IPA has an amber colour and a one-finger head that lasts forever due to the excellent carbonation. The smell is is quite strong and mostly of hops and citrus. The initial taste is surprisingly sweet and malty but it quickly morphs into the hops one expects from an IPA along with a hint of citrus. The aftertaste that is only slightly bitter. This beer isn't expecially thick, but the carbonation does give it an interesting mouthfeel. One of my favourite IPAs."
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable. Not very strong in flavor, so easily consumed. While drinking with my friends who don't care for IPAs, they enjoy it. I could go for a little more bite, but overall a nice drink to enjoy with house guests."
"Overall: ive had a few IPAs in my time this is by far the best. so glad i have a 6 pack to enjoy if you want a great IPA this is the one"
"For me, the drinkability is obviously low. I'd rather have a Miller Lite than this. I'd rather smell this any day of the week, but drink....thanks but no thanks. Though, it is something I will return to when I believe myself to be a true Beer Advocate."
"Update 12/2012: Since first trying this beer in 2010 I have had it many times. I have to say that if I see it on a a menu I order one even though I usually like to explore new things on the beer menu. It is never disappointing. One of my favorites although I go to this when at a restaurant having dinner and not necessarily at a bar or at home."
"Taste has a strong caramel ground layer which the various hop notes are built upon. The citrus type hops stand out most when fresh with a lighter amount of syrupy pine varietals taking a 2nd seat. there is just enough tropical-esque fruits mixed in to note. The alcohol is there but not ruining the mix."
"Drinkability: I would drink it every day if I could. One of my true favorites, and this beer was one of the ones that made me fall in love with IPA's."
"one of my favorite double ipas, one of my favorite beer styles. every hop heads need to try this beer and often."
"If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life...this would be it. Thanks DogFish!"
"Overall: A very well balanced and tasty Double IPA that I probably should have bought more of in place of some other beers(Magic Hat Hex). If you like IPAs this is one to have on your bucket list."
"Drinkability: Dangerously oh so drinkable."
"Overall very good. I feel like it could use a hair more hops to cut the sweetness though."
"Overall- this beer is incredibly well balanced, loads of hops but not terribly bitter because of the strong malt backbone. No alcohol is detected at 9% making this dangerously drinkable. Very well done!"
"Fairly good drinkability. It's a bit harsh as a whole, so while one is super tasty, any more than that is pushing it."
"Delicious IPA dangerously drinkable with the high abv."
"D: A wonderful beer."
"Excellent DIPA - and I'm not even an IPA lover."
"D - I could probably have one of these an evening, kinda like the same way I treat an RIS. Doubt that you'd want to down 3 or 4 of these in one sitting though. I can see myself drinking several of these over several weeks..."
"D- Definitely one of the best ipa's out there. Hops and fruitiness and balanced very well to make for a beer that is very enjoyable to drink."
"Pours a clear copper amber like buckwheat honey, medium sized eggshell white head that leaves some good lacing. Complex aroma of sweet caramel malts and brown sugar with floral hops. Some pine in there. A hint of peach or apricot. Taste is similar to the aroma. Sweet malts cut with piney, floral hops. Lots of flavor here, but balanced flavor. Finish is resinous bitterness that lingers. The mouthfeel on this one is really enjoyable, slightly creamy with just enough carbonation. This beer to me kind of has barleywine qualities. If i was going to age a IIPA it would be this one."
"D: This is a very good strong ABV beer that hides it very well in the layers of flavors. A IPA that really sets the standards high for many developed flavors. Taking the best parts of the style and making all of them extremely great. The body while thick, is easy to drink from the amount of smooth hops used. A very good example of the style, perhaps a benchmark.  "
"D - this has a great hop profile that you don't taste often, and the malt is strong enough to hold its own, the high alcohol is very well hidden, only small knock is the feel is not what I like in an IPA but not a bad feel, overall a unique and very drinkable double IPA"
"I used to love 90 minute, and have had it a few times over the last few years and have been really let down and stopped purchasing dogfish beers. Since noticing that dogfish head was dating their bottles, I have been purchasing A LOT of their beers and as long as they are fresh, I have been very happy. This is no exception, it is the 90 minute I remember."
"So what can I say? I think this one is done very, very well. I'm actually impressed. The balance is done very well, though it does seem to be one of the sweeter DIPA's that I've had."
"I could drink this IPA everyday, it is one of the best IPAs to ever come out of the East Coast."
"Serving type: bottle"
"A great beer and a most try."
"It's an easy drinker, but at the same time I like savoring it. The 9% is pretty far away, but still is there. Masked pretty well though. I would recommend this drink to anybody."
"Overall - Definitely one of the best DIPA's out there. This one stands out from the crowd with it's mix of traditional DIPA flavors, and darker beer flavors. I will say though, if you're looking for nothing but hop bitterness, look elsewhere. This is a complex, balanced ale!"
"I have compared this to a few other Imperial IPAs and have found Dogfish 90 to have consistant smell and mouthfeel. Again, good recipe."
"Cheers!"
"Pours copper with a solid head that leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. Nose is pine/citrus hops mixed with a caramel maltiness. Like the nose suggests, this is a very complex IIPA, containing both an assault of hop bitterness and a strong balancing malt backbone. The flavor is heavily tilted toward the hop side (no doubt a result of DFH's dry hopping). Absolutely incredible beer; my favorite DFH offering."
"Drinkable? Amazingly so for an Imperial IPA"
"D - after I made my above notes I grabbed some Taco Bell and chowed down, the two matched well. I ended up not paying attention at all and suddenly realized I only had two sips left...the first time I've ever truly been bummed and upset that there wasn't any left. I bought this as a single on the way home from a long day, should have bought a 6er....sigh..."
"Mouthfeel is not as syrupy as the aroma indicated. Carbonation seemed appropriate. Overall very nice."
"Given the fact that this is a 4 year old IPA, it is what I expected. Barleywine-esque and nothing bitter. I look forward to trying a fresh bottle."
"D- A good tasting beer. This is one I defenitely could enjoy more frequently than I do. Sweeter than the 60 but still has all the hop zing. Very tasty."
"M/D: Medium bodied with nice carbonation. It is sweeter than its 60 minute counterpart, but I really enjoy the 90. Have had it from bottle, tap, and through Randall the Enamal Animal which I suggest to do if you like this beer."
"D: I'd say very. Alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering."
"D: This brew definitely emphasizes the """imperial""" in imperial IPA. I was expecting more bitterness from a beer touting its 90-minute hopping."
"2/24/13- upped the taste category for my recent batch of this. I believe it's a fresher batch and the balance of the hops to the malt is quite spot on. Fantastic stuff."
"Drinkability- About 98% of the general population would at the very least make a face after trying this beer, however there are those of us who cannot get enough of stuff like this. A bit pricy though. Cheers!"
"Will need to give this a few more tries."
"This was simply a phenomenal beer. Lacing was excellent through the session. The beauty in this beer is the balance. Incredible malt backbone to handle the high alcohol, which was perfectly balanced with hops. I this one of THE BEST IIPA/DIPAs in existence. Seek it out and enjoy it."
"Drinkability-see above"
"D-drinkable beyond imagine, the only session drinker i know of with such a high ABV, even after a few, the taste is constantly reminding you that you're drinking something beautiful."
"I wanted this to be in the regular rotation for me but, I am not a big fan of this one. There is just not enough bitterness and way too much caramel for me. Also, the strongest taste in the flavor profile is harsh and solvent like alcohol. There was definitely not enough pine and basically no citrus. At $14 plus tax for a 4 pack, I would not buy this again."
"Just had a great sampler of IPAs at a shore tavern. DFH 90 was among the four I sampled. Have to say, nice brew and quite drinkable for the 9% abv. Head was one finger and left some nice lacing down the glass. Color was typical of any other American IPA. Nose was nice, but not overpowering. Taste was similar to 60 Min, but a bit more of everything. For some reason, I find an earthiness to DFH IPAs--- this follows suit. Waitress gave me a second half-pint on the house, after the first four---probably didn't need it, but... ;)"
"For a different perception, my wife on the other hand really likes this beer. She says that she likes the balance of the malt backbone. I normally love a good balanced IIPA like Terrapin Rye squared, but for some reason this one just tastes...off... Perhaps it is the type of Hops/malts used?"
"Call it a Strong Ale, and I'll give it a B+."
"A big mahalo goes out to geryeb624 for sending this beer my way!!! Pours a crisp clean reddish/amber color with a nice size off white head and just the right amount of visible carbonation. Aromas of hops, grapefruit and pine. Flavor is of light citrus and hops with a slight undertone of alcohol. Very smooth and lightly sweet with a quick bitter finish. The aftertaste is long and wonderful. I could happily drink this all day, at least until I passed out:)"
"OVERALL: This one is basically a boozier version of 60min, but the booze isn't accompanied by more malt or hop flavor. A little too boozy for the style in my book, but it is still tasty enough to bother finishing, even if it is a one and done. While I'd grab their 6% IPA again, there are better 9% DIPAs out there. Skip it."
"D: I actually think this is more drinkable than the 60 Minute... very good for a DIPA :)"
"Drinkability - This is a beer that I come back to again and again. Truly a remarkable Double. For a brew with an ABV of 9% I could drink this all day. But that would probably be a mistake."
"Sure this is a strong beer, but it is quite drinkable. I keep wanting another sip. This beer could be dangerous; I could easily drink a lot of it."
"D - After hearing rave reviews from friends about this, I was excited to try it. It has been a couple months since I've had an imperial IPA, so I had to get used to the strength again. It's very drinkable, though the strong alcoholic aftertaste makes me want to try the 60 minute, in hopes of a smoother finish."
"It will also age well over time with the added strength and sweetness, and pairs magnificently well with beef, potatoes, cheesy breads, olive oil based pastas, rich cheeses, and rich cheesecake."
"Served from 12oz bottle about 40+ degrees. Again another IPA, my fourth since joining our beer club. Starts off with strong smell of a """booze like""" scent if you will but doesnt have the strong bite of a liquor. Very surprising and pleasant finish. Thin lacing and about a 1""" head when poured into sampling glass. Again another IPA with a punched up ABV that is pleasant."
"Overall, a really good example of an east coast imperial IPA. Really balanced and flavorful. Definitely something I pick up a four pack of all the time."
"For a beer of such strength and complexity, it's incredibly easy to drink. A big, bold Imperial IPA that's as drinkable as any beer on the planet. If you like great beer, get your hands on this often overlooked gem."
"Hop overload is an understatement. One of the most hop solid beer I have ever had, and I know that I am drinking truly one of the best DIPA's in the country. I will leave telling you that if you have the chance have a glass or two and you will realize that DIPA's are one of the only good things in this world."
"Bottle. Bottled on 6/18/10. Poured a gold orange clear color with a 1 finger head of tiny bubbles. Fairly strong piney aroma with some citrus characteristics, but mostly the pine. The first sip is a barage of bitterness with a nice balance of sweet malts. Finishes crisply with a lingering bitterness. Not too bitter in that it really kills your pallet but for sure more probably bitter than most people would like. Actually prefer this one over the 60 minute version. Medium mouthfeel."
"DB- Strange how much a beer changes in my view in about a year. The thing I remember, and best part, is the malt profile here. It is just a bit roasty, toasty biscuit and caramel. Stronger and boozier than I remember, very aggressive. A Double IPA of a different brand, huge malt, alcohol and bitterness, the malt really makes this one what it is. This one draws a fine line between IIPA and Barleywine, try it if your one of the very few BAs that hasn't."
"Thick-bodied and viscous, drinkability is excellent."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. I love the fact that it's different from 60 minute IPA in that it's much maltier and a bit thicker. Different strokes for different folks, but I like 'em both. Another very drinkable beer from DFH, even at 9% alcohol. Now all that's left is to try the 120 minute."
"I certainly enjoyed this beer and wouldn't hesitate in purchasing it again."
"Pours an amber-orange colour with huge white head. Good head retention as the head settles down a bit and lacing surrounding the glass. Not sure how the appearance could be improved. Smells of piney hops and lots of caramel sweetness. Tastes like a very well balanced double IPA. Sometimes I'm in the mood for a hop bomb, in which case this wouldn't be the right beer, but for a balanced double IPA with lots of malt, not sure this can be beat."
"D- Very good beer! Good hop flavors to it. The alcohol is masked very well. Does start to come out a bit as it warms, but still nice. Felt like I could drink a few, but did creep up on me."
"DFH always seems to draw either a lot of praise or a lot of disdain. I happen to enjoy most of what they put out and this is no exception."
"If this wasn't 9%, it would be pretty darn drinkable."
"I had the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA at the Brewpub as well as the Brewery and it was a well made beer. It had the taste of what most IPAs wish they had. This beer is one of the best beers that Dogfish Head makes and it is very unfortunate that many local distributors don't care this great beer."
"Notes: Overall this is a pretty good beer. Lots of fruity hop flavors and it comes off a little on the sweet side for the style(somewhat barleywine like), but it isn't cloying. Nice, easy to drink beer that is a good quality and easy to find beer."
"D- at 9% theres only so much you can drink of this although its extremely tasty"
"Bottled 3/4/10. Poured into a pint glass, a brilliant orange color with a small head. Lacing however is great with notches left each time I take a drink. Smells are big on sweet grapefruit. Its still hoppy even though it isnt incredibly fresh. Caramel sweetness and fresh pine flavors keep me coming back for more. Finishes a touch boozy, as expected for a true DIPA. I really dont what else to say, this is an amazing brew! Thank you DFH, thank you!"
"Drinkability - Look what this is classed with: Pliny, Hopslam, Dreadnaught, Boy King, Racer X. How do you compete with these? You bring more than just a """tougue-ripping""" to the game. DFH 90 minute does that, very well. A nice sipper to go along with the other sippers in the DFH stable."
"EDIT: Received another bottle from 67couple via another trade. Bottled on date is even older, May 4, 2010. Old notes remain the same, but I'm getting heavy mocha/coffee notes from the finish this time round. Hmmm."
"Dogfish Head 90min IPA is commonly referred to as a beer that is overrated, but that doesn't mean it isn't a very well made, tasty beer. The beer is a deep orange amber with wispy, irregular, rocky foam that leaves fantastic sticky lacy cling. The beer smells citrusy with a very distinct apricot and peach sweetness and slight bit caramel malt. The taste is bitter with a lot of complex hop flavor, mostly floral and fruity. The malt provides a thick full body and sweet bread flavor. Very well balanced with a bitter finish."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate. Pretty good mouthfeel for the style. Drinkability is very good, it's very flavorful, hoppy, and a very solid beer overall. Another one of my personal favorites that I drink pretty frequently, considering I have a Dogfish restaurant right down the road from me."
"That being said, the appearance and mouthfeel were nice, the smell was similar to the taste which made me want to wretch."
"(NOTE: I have had this on tap out on a randall at the DFH brewpub and this WAS one of the best IIPAs had, so bottles don't do it justice. Well, that plus the randall is amazing!)"
"It's been a long time since I've had this, always enjoyed it in the past but didn't realize how sweet and malty this is for a DIPA. Tone that back and let the hops shine DFH!"
"While my memories of this beer differ from my current reality this is good beer and I do recomend it. I feel I need to try it perhaps much closer to it's bottling date while it's as fresh as possible. If I can get it to match my first memories of this beer I am sure I will be upgrading my score."
"Overall I enjoyed it even though I would prefer something a bit lighter and hoppier. Will get it again but try and get one a bit fresher."
"D- surprisingly drinkable. If you aren't much for hops, this might not be a good choice for you. But if you can stand or revel in hops, you can easily have one or two. This may be a sneaky beer though, so watch out!"
"drinkability: an easy brew to sip on, just watch out for the abv. highly drinkable but wouldn't session this."
"D- Slightly above average, but not something I would buy again. The alcohol is hidden very nicely and it does go down smooth. An average piney IPA that does not overpower the malt side of things. I didn't even notice this was a Double IPA until after I posted my review which makes me a bit more disappointed with this beer (enough to come back and add the comment)."
"Drinkability- I would be happy finishing the six pack."
"one of my """gateway""" crafts, a finey built DIPA and a dangerously drinkable one at that."
"So the color was a amber color. the head showed up early then quickly dissipated. The smells were that of hops and grains and pine. The initial taste was strong hops flavor with other grains, the bitterness of the hops do leave quickly leaving a good after taste in your mouth. For an IPA this one has the drinkability because it wont destroy your pallet like some of the harsher IPA's."
"D: Forget water, I'm just going to drink this from now on. Perfect for a summer evenings and chilling on the porch."
"as IIPA's go, this is very good but not up to its reputation in my opinion. My emotions about this beer ran the gamut from exceptional to very good and after having a few over time, have settled on very good. There are too many great IPA's out there and the competition is too stiff to give this an exceptional score."
"I personally like the DFH 60-minute better."
"Well-carbonated and a full, smooth mouthfeel. Sweet caramel, tangerine, and hints of vanilla up front followed by a warming alcohol presence that leads to a long, tart finish of grapefruit and pine. Very tasty; strikes a nice bittersweet balance."
"I've had this before, at least once, but this was my first time drinking it out of a glass (as opposed to straight out of the bottle). As I was finishing the beer off, before I knew it was DFH, I had figured this was a California IPA (thanks crazeguy!) that I'd have trouble finding here. Definitely be picking this one up more often now... score one for the Blind Beers!"
"D- Good for a 9% abv DIPA."
"Definitely better fresh!"
"One of my favorite beers that I always come back to. Simply outstanding."
"D- Amazing. This is definitely one of my favorite beers. I am impressed by this beer in so many ways. Complex, but still unmistakably IPA."
"D- I'd have one and then end it. I'm not jonesin' for more, that's for sure."
"D: Not my favorite Imp. IPA. Many people love this beer but I just never got on board with it. It is good and I can have a few but I rather not. The sweetness is too much for me."
"Drinkability is fairly good. It's not as hoppy as I expect, but pretty good for it's style."
"Cheers!"
"D - This beer was a great taste considering the 9% it was very smooth."
"Quite drinkable considering the 9% ABV."
"Lomo con pulque"
"D A good beer. There is no mistaking this for a moderate alcohol beer....it let's you know. Very nice."
"D : Deliciously quaffable because the bitter bite is so diminished, dangerously so for a 9%."
"Served to me with a small head. Color is bronze with excellent clarity. Smell is sharp and fresh. Pine hops and a little bready malt. Taste is a homerun. Great balance of hops and malts. Piney hop flavour is abundant and the 9% is barely noticeable. Very drinkable for a double. Almost dangerous. One of the better DIPAs I've had. Lives up to the reputation for sure."
"D - an excellent brew. these guys obviously knew what they were doing with this. on the list of my favorite brews."
"Notes: I've had this beer several times before and I will have it again. IMO, it is significantly more balance and well-rounded than DFH 60min ipa."
"Not bad, just not my style of IPA."
"Overall, i was excited to try this one, and i must say all the praise is justified. A very well-crafted brew, definitely would recommend to a friend."
"M/D: It had a bitter dryness on the palate. Overall it was very drinkable and zesty. I would purchase this again. This one is worth a try."
"incredibly drinkable and delicious, but not quite what i look for in an ipa."
"D - Who doesn't love to drink 90 min. IPA?"
"It's not the best IPA I've ever had by any means, and I was a little let down, but fortunately I have a few more to formulate a better opinion and update my thoughts."
"D. Very drinkable, I honestly didn't even realize it was 9% ABV. Extremely hoppy but not overdone."
"Pours a copper color with a fingers width head. Nose is well balanced of Earthy hops and malt with a slight bready/toastiness. Taste is of slight grapefruit smoothed out nicely by the malts incredibly smooth and does not linger with bitterness as some dipa's do.mouthfeel is nice, thick without being resinous. Drinkability on this one is high but the 9% abv stands to be reckoned with, proceed with caution =) overall this is one of my favorite Imperial IPA'S Rated A."
"Drinkability: A sipping beer, but a damn good one nonetheless. This one should definitely be tasted; hopefully it is as good out of the bottle as my growler was!"
"Highly drinkable, you just have to be careful that you don't knock yourself on your keister with this 9% brew. I can't recommend this one enough!"
"One of my favorite IPA's of all time. Also had this beer at a special tasting put on by the brewery at a pub. The color is very rich, almost an amber color, with very sharp hop and spice notes that pop into you olfactory receptors as you raise the glass to your mouth. Taste is very bitter, yet it is smooth and finished with subtly sweet, almost caramel flavor. This beer is thicker than most IPA's, and packs a very strong alcohol content, and is therefore understandably not exceptionally drinkable, yet hard to stop drinking!! If you drink an entire 4 pack, you should definitely tie yourself to the couch!"
"Drinkability: Even at 9% ABV, this is a very drinkable beer. I really want another one and sadly I only bought one bottle. The beer went very well with a hot summer meal (BLT sandwich and salad) and I know it would be good with many other meals. I will definitely pick this up again."
"This beer is remarkable fresh. Flavors that stand out are fresh pineapple, pine, and grapefruit notes. I taste some apple tartness. The sticky pine notes are remarkable. The mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat heavy. The alcohol is warming. This beer is very easy to drink. This whole growler has been a pleasure to enjoy, along with some homemade hot wings and cheese fries."
"D: A memorable DIPA, a real standout."
"Job Well Done!"
"D: Very drinkable. Dangerous for a high ABV and crisp camoflauging finish."
"Drinkability: This seems like a stronger beer with a bit of a punch in terms of affecting the senses. Would like to try with food at some point but I get the feeling I better be prepared for a long nap afterwords because I am feeling this one. Not quite as refreshing as I would like."
"Deep copper orange with with a nice head retention through the first couple of sips. Big sticky lacings reaching all the way to rim of the glass. THe lightest haze on a beer that I've ever seen - nearly clear. Deep tropical citrus araomas - grapefruit, pineapple, with a bit of a funky smell in there too. Huge hop flavor that overwhelms the malt and masks the higher alcohol. The huge bitter hop character tends to wear you out a bit. As much as I enjoyed it, I prefer the 60IPA. My tastebuds enjoy some maltiness."
"D - Even at 9% I could toss back six of these no problem, which is a sign of a dangerously good beer. Any hop head must try this offering, and it ranks up there with some of my favorites with respect to IPA's."
"Initially I was enjoying this beer - the aroma was pleasant and the relatively strong hoppy bitterness helped to mellow the sweetness. As the glass progressed, however, the alcohol content of this beer overpowered the aftertaste and it lost its depth. Ultimately, I was left to """enjoy""" a rubbing alcohol flavor at the end of each sip. Not good."
"D - Definitely not your typical IPA, way more sweetness than I am used too, just not really of fan of this, I want more bitterness and less sweetness I guess. Glad I tried it but I would much rather drink Squall IPA than this."
"All in all, my favorite beer!"
"D: It's not for me for the said reasons, but I can see why others find it great."
"The notes above are based on my home tasting of a variety bottled six months earlier. If you find that this beer is too jagged in its flavors, try aging it. Just a year or two is enough to mellow it out and allow the vibrant flavors to meld into each other. Highly recommended."
"The 90 Minute IPA is an imbalanced, bitter IPA. It's incredibly hoppy, but fails to extract and retain some of the best qualities of the hops it's brewed with. Although its complex flavor profile leaves the drinker with a lot to explore, the bitterness inhibits its drinkability and makes this beer hard to enjoy."
"Drinkability: this is a pretty drinkable beer overall, but I find the hops a little too jarring to be really refreshing. That, plus the slightly-overly-biscuity malt bill detract a bit from this beer's drinkability. It's still quite good, though."
"This is the quintessential IPA for me. I know it is an Imperial/Double, but who cares I want the flavors in my IPA. Delivers enough hops to make you notice, then has the barley malts to even things out. Extremely drinkable, extremely delicious. This brew is one of my all time favorites, I forgot how damn good it was. Another world class brew, from a world class brewery."
"Overall-love the balance now, very pleasant and still has a great hop presence but a beautiful malt balance make this a great bear to enjoy and I can actually keep drinking it unlike many of my favorite hop bombs that make me suffer towards the end of a growler."
"D - I don't buy the ABV, as I am just getting started. I could quaff down a few more and be happy."
"Pours a wonderful deep orange color into a snifter. Smells of Grapefruit and Brown Sugar up front Pine and Lemon rind at the end. Taste is quite sweet brownsugar and hops up front with a boozy middle and a mildly bitter end. Mouthfeel has noticeable but not at all unpleasant alcohol warming, with a definitive syrupy character but both are well balanced making this quite nice to drink. It is easy to drink given its alcohol content but I would tend to shy away from any more than 3 at once, and 3 is a bit of a stretch."
"Overall, I enjoyed it, but pretty disappointed and underwhelmed. A pretty unremarkable beer, I'd drink it again but I would go out of my way."
"Do you love hops? Then this is you ale. It looks, smells, and taste hoppy. It pours a cloudy yellow/orange with a nice cream-yellow head full of alpha acids. The aroma pure fresh green hop. If you have ever picked hops you know that fresh slightly oily, slightly earthy green aroma. The hop taste is balanced with an assertive yet low key maltiness that seems to support the hops rather than battle with them. 90 IBU's and 9% ABV and you will be warm and hoppy all night long. Dogfish Head is known for pushing the envelope and this ale does just that. This is an ale that is meant to be and is BITTER. What a wonderful thing."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied. Drinkability is good for a high abv beer. Another hit from DFH."
"D- very little sign of the abv and for what it is I can totally dig it. For sure its an east coast ipa."
"Poured an orangish-red color...wouldn't really call it amber. Has a very nice frothy white head to it. Aroma is extremely sweet candy sugars, sweet malts, and light hops. Living on the west coast, this does not smell like your typical DIPA. Also get a bit of melon in the nose. Taste is amazing. This is the beer that kinda got me started and hooked on Dogfish Head. Taste is just so well balanced. If you were to compare this to a west coast DIPA, it would almost be like comparing apples to oranges IMO. There's so much more malt and candy sweetness to this brew. The 60 minute is a nice toned down version of this, but they have so many similarities. The high abv (9%) is barely noticeable...until it starts to warm up. I suggest drinking this beer at around 40 degrees. You don't miss out on any of the smells or flavor, but you do miss out on the alcohol making itself a leading member of your taste buds. This beer has an amazing mouthfeel with INCREDIBLE drinkability. I love this beer."
"Drinkability - For the abv, drinkable. For me personally, too sweet. I preferred the 60 minute to this to be perfectly honest. This beer is just the epitome of an """East Coast DIPA""" and to be frank, I don't particularly care for it. Glad I got to try it again and review it, but I'm thankful I only had to purchase a single (which is why I haven't reviewed this sooner - couldn't justify buying a four pack again)."
"Citrus aroma. Sweet up front, a bit toasty and some malt flavor present. Also a hint of caramel and some dark fruit flavor. Finishes with a good amount of citrus/piney hops. Alcohol is present as the beer warms. A bit of a brandy flavor. A lot going on in this beer."
"D- very easy to take down but at the price you want to savor this one, this has become one of my staple IPA's"
"The drinkability is a bit of a conundrum. Nine per cent alcohol makes for a big, warming presence in this beer, and in terms of its flavour and feel it's built to savour rather than quaff. Just drinkable enough to have one bottle and be satisfied for a while."
"D- very drinkable, its a smooth beer with a great taste. What's not to like?"
"Personally, quality beer, too heavy on malts and, frankly and simply, too much sheer flat flavor and, more pointedly, it's not an American IPA as I think of it because the pure strength of the malt simply suffocates the hops. This is a good brew, just too sweet for me but also lacks complexity and subtlety to be a great beer, which is what this is trying to be given its profile."
"D - Not a thirst quencher but an enjoyable, single beer treat. A nice Imperial IPA although I prefer a deeper roasted malt flavor and less sweetness in my DIPAs."
"D-I could drink a couple of these ( if I don't have to drive). The alcohol is a bit warming, so maybe not the best BBQ beer ( though I think it would match quite well with BBQ ribs). I know this may sound weird, but I would consider this beer a mellower American barley wine, and not an IIPA."
"I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these at a time due to how heavy it is."
"In summary, Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA is certainly a good beer, but I wouldn't rate it """the best.""""
"This brewing company was recommended to me by a friend. The 90 minute was the only available type so I gave it a try. I am not sure on the difference's between the various brands they have, but this one was fruity. I am usually not a fruity type of beer drinker, but it wasn't overpowering like a lot of them are. It actually blended well. I was suprised by the taste and did enjoy it. It did get me hoping to discover more types, since the quality from the brewer was there."
"D- extremely drinkable. Problem is the pricing which is tough to deal with in a """college town""" I think DogfishHead would greatly improve their marks in the Greater Northwest if their pricing was better. just tough to fork out that much green to taste an American Beer. But if you do, you will be happy with the purchase"
"The body is moderate initially, but the oily hop resins seem to lend some thickness as they taper the long finish in a pleasant way. 90 Minute is absolutely one of Sam's best beers. It is well-crafted and original in every way. The only thing that would keep me from drinking a 4-pack in one sitting is the noticeable alcohol bite."
"Overall- I love this beer, so I'm prejudiced in its favor, but I find that it has aged well. Despite the fact that I love hops, I don't mind the taste as the beer ages. It's bitter, but not so bitter to deter non-traditional IPA drinkers from giving it a try. It's definitely not a beer I can have more than 2 or so of at a setting, due both to its ABV and the fact that it's only sold by the 4-pack or case."
"D: very drinkable, high ABV gives the body a good feel post consumption."
"M/D: Medium to fuller body. Lower carbonation. Feels pretty smooth and thicker then it really is. Great drinkability for a DIPA, especially since its 9%. First Dogfish Head I've had, wish I could get this on a regular basis. Bottled 4/22/10."
"The one that makes me scream...90 minute on cask at ashley's in ann arbor. My mouth is still watering thinking of that glorious day I had this. 90 minute is one of the most drinkable and delicious widely distributed beers in the country and having it on cask is just a heavenly experience."
"This is a great beer that a wide range of beer and even wine lovers could enjoy. Despite its 9% abv its incredibly drinkable and definitely has characteristics of other styles of beer. This is by no means a west coast style DIPA. I am very glad to have this offering from DFH."
"The beer pours a cloudy orange color with a white head. The aroma is orange with a nice malt backbone. The flavor is caramel malt with citrus hops. The beer has some nice sweetness from the malt but it is balanced nicely with the bitterness from the hops. A very balanced Double IPA. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Pours relatively clear for such a well hopped bear. I prefer the haziness of other IIPAs. Noise is nice but maybe my bottle isn't the freshest. Hops hit you first and then there's just a ton of malt sweetness that washes it away. Love the malt backbone this beer has. Very drinkable at 9% ABV - they hide the alcohol exceptionally well."
"D - This beer is OK but I was expecting more from it. I might have gotten a bad bottle (I purchased a single). I don't think that I would try this one again."
"Poured into a standard glass. Looks very good for the style. Didn't expect it, but it's very clear, obviously filtered. Has a nice dark amber color to it. Not quite what I expected for a Double/Imperial IPA, but still pretty good for a beer in general. Most Double IPA's I've had are generally unfiltered. This beer has some better than average lacing to it. The smell is pretty good, not as hoppy as I expected, but the maltiness is kicked up a notch. Pretty good, but I'd expect a little more from a DIPA. I find many DIPA's to be very strong, but this one seems to be struggling to find it's identity in the smell department. The smell pretty sweet, almost a light toffee and some pine hops follow. The taste is a step up. Again it's pretty heavy on the malts, caramelized malts a d some citrus/pine hops to follow it up. It almost has a bit of a buttery taste to it as well. The mouthfeel is the best part in my opinion. It touches on all the major points that beer drinkers like. It's well balanced, more full bodied. Has a smooth texture (mentioned the buttery taste ealier), and not too much or too little carbonated, yet it finishes clean and a little bitter. It's a good drinkable beer as well. I found it difficult to review this beer a little based on the style. It really tasted more like a regular IPA than a Double IPA. I've had more IPA's with more DIPA characteristics than this. Still a reliable beer, but I guess I just expected more. Worth the try."
"I am going back for a second bottle, and could not be more pleased. This is an excellent representative of the IPA style, and am very pleased with having discovered it."
"D: Dogfish makes great beers, so it's definitely drinkable. I like the hop flavors/aromas even though they are not too bittering. For the price and taste however, I prefer the 60 minute."
"D - I'm only gonna have one of the fourpack tonight. Not that it's ard to drink really, but I find DFH beers, with very few exceptions, are overly sweet. This one doesn't doesn't finish as dry as you'd expect an IPA to. I really wish they'd cut down on the sweetness in most of their beers. I'd enjoy them much more."
"Highly recommended!"
"D - I could drink this again as a nightcap, but I will certainly not buy this again when I'm in the mood for a DIPA."
"D - dangerously drinkable, although this is def a sipper."
"Pale, clear copper in color. Strong aroma of piney hops and malt sweetness. Taste matches the aroma with a smack of pine & citrus hops, followed by a balancing punch of caramel, toffee & spicy malt sweetness. Finishes dry and deliciously. Wonderful, highly drinkable big IPA."
"I thought the alcohol well hidden at first, but it did show towards the end of the tasting. It didn't become overpowering, but you could tell it was hanging around waiting to attack if you'd let it."
"First of all thanks to my mates Adam and Joel and i definately appreciate this is as this is the first time ive had the chance to sample some beer from this fine brewery that ive heard so much about and have been hanging to try some ever since and yeah love the brewery's name so original and catchy,anyway the brew itself pours a suprisingly light clear amber hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves a creamy milkshake looking two finger head and heaps of foamy lacing,the smell is a perfectly balanced mix of aromas of piney hops and sweet caramel perfectly balanced,by the smell of this beer you can tell your not gonna be let down and im right it has a beautiful creamy sessionable mouthfeel which is neither thick nor thin and exudes that perfect balance of sweet caramel/toffee malts and piney/citrus infused hops all across the palette and no taste is dominating at all with its 9.0%ABV nowhere to be seen,this is definately a beer that ive heard alot about and have always wanted to try especially hearing alot about from mates and quite frankly it was worth the wait as its a perfectly balanced ADII that i could drink alot of and it would have a permanent place in my rotating beer collection and now my only bad thing to say about it is this brew is not currently regularly available in my home state but hopefully that will change as i would like to sample more of this brewery's brew's after tasting this one."
"D - For a robust, high alcohol beer this is pretty drinkable."
"The appearance was quite impressive. There was a nice thick puffy head of foam about three inches thick;the kind that sticks to the glass as it is consumed. The foam by itself even had a hint of hops. Foam eventually dropped down, but not until the end of the glass. The smell of hops was quite potent. The taste was very impressive. This beer is better to be consumed one or two per sitting."
"This beer looks the way a strong IPA should. It's a darker amber color and features little, off white foam. It smells very strongly of hops with slight sweetness. It boasts good, strong hoppy flavor with sugars and tartness present on the backend. Good mouthfeel and well carbonated. Drinks very crisp. Is pretty drinkable considering the alcohol content. A four pack is definitely worth picking up, especially if you've tried a good amount of IPAs."
"D- Incredibly drinkable... dangerously quaffable... the alcohol is so well hidden. And I love the fact that the hop bitterness is always kept in check- never becoming overbearing."
"D: No matter if on tap or in the bottle, this is one of my favorite DIPA's. It is a very well balanced brew, albeit a little on the sweet side. One of the best offerings from DFH. Cheers!"
"Downing a few of these will get your buzz on. I doubt I could do more than two of these at a time unless I was washing down spicy food or sharp cheeses. This would go well with strong curry."
"Drinkability - love it and wish I could get it in minnesota."
"I'm definitely more impressed by this than I was by the 60-minute IPA I had yesterday. This is something worth having around. Now if only I could find the 120-minute version...."
"All in all, now I can totally see why this beer is so acclaimed. Great job, Sam Calagione and his team!"
"Nice dipa. Nice florals in the bouquet and the taste. Esters of apricot followed by sweet grasses. Finished with a peppery spice note. The mouthfeel finishes a little slick. But the start is a nice bubbly pucker. You may be able to drink a few because of the nice balance but beware of the big 9 percent abv."
"All in all a great IPA. I will certainly have this one again."
"Drinkability -- While this is still a solid beer, I found it to be too sweet and cloying, and even for its abv I found it to be a little too boozy. Couldn't do more than one glass in an evening."
"Crisp bright bite with mellow smoth aftertones. Rich flavor without taking your face off with every sip. An IPA that is strangley difficult to drink just one. Great color, great clarity. This is what IPAs should be in my book."
"D- I used to put these suckers back like they're going out of style, now I find it a little heavy to be a multi-drinker, but then I usually don't drink more than a few anyway."
"As far as DIPAs go this is pretty nice. I wouldnt say it has that balance that other world class DIPAs have. Overall a great beer and I would drink it again."
"D: These are a pleasure to drink, but watch out for the ABV."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable, not bad at all."
"Drinkability - Had this before, but not in a while. I'm absolutely in love with this beer. It has everything I ever look for in an IPA/DIPA. Citrus hop dominated flavor profile (love that grapefruit bitterness), a little pine, and a nice malt backbone to give the beer a little depth. Big bodied without sacrificing palatability and the alcohol is stealthy. Plus, it looks gorgeous. Fantastic drinkability and a fantastic DIPA. Where's the 9%? The big body and the 9% ABV are the only things keeping me from giving drinkability full marks."
"D- A very nice and refreshing beer. Its pretty unlike a lot of other IIPAs."
"The 2002 sipped pretty decently, but I can't really call it a DIPA at that point. Good for a barleywine/old ale type. But just good."
"overall - Aged to the point its a completely different beer. Its more along the lines of a barleywine at this point...mmmm"
"Beer poured with a deep copper color and a nice tan white head. Ample carbonation, but not too much. It smelled slightly piney and fruity but was not very assertive. Tasted great. Lots of fruit mingled with a pine-llike hoppiness. Weighted a little toward the bitterness, which is great, but it also had a nice firm maltiness. Mouthfeel was medium to full. Very drinkable beer. Mucho gusto! Good job, Dogfish Head!"
"Has a creamy, smooth mouthfeel with a medium/full body and a matching carbonation."
"I thought this was going to be a hop bomb. It isn't. It's a malt and flavor bomb. Lot's of stuff going on. Alcohol gets to you. Had it on an empty stomach early in the day and I can say I'm kind of dizzy. Very interesting and a must try if you love beer. So different from the 60 and making me anxious to try the 120."
"Nice amber color, lingering off-white head. Not surprisingly, hops dominate the aroma, though there is a noticeable malt background. Tastes similar, with a little alcohol heat on the finish. This is a """definitely drink again""" beer, makes me want to do a flight of their """__ Minute IPA"""s."
"This is a great IPA, even better than the 60 minute. I would highly recommend this to any IPA enthusiast. The bitterness and alcohol are really well placed in this beer, and they complement the hoppy flavors perfectly. I never thought I would like an IPA more than the 60 minute, but this has officially won my recognition. Another success; well done, Dogfish Head."
"D: Phenomenal DIPA. Great beer to sip on, gets even tastier as it warms. Though the alcohol taste is present, it works so well with everything else going on that it doesn't quite feel like 9% ABV. Easy drinking for a DIPA, but there's really no need for more than 2 of these at a time!"
"Just not for me."
"It's by far my favorite IIPA to date! And this batch isn't super fresh either. Can't wait to try it fresh."
"D - This is kind of mixed. I mean I would use this experience to try the 120 and then the WWS but going back seems like as waist as I once considered this beer undrinkable and now its so/so by meaning enjoyable to a level. Meh."
"Overall: Quite satisfied with this IPA. Tastes great, packs an alcoholic punch and goes down easy. Highly enjoyable. Simple, yet effective. I'd recommend it."
"I have really enjoyed Dogfish before but this one I will not get again. Good hops, but for an Imperial Ipa, it almost acts and tasted like a stout. I am wondering if maybe since I am in Michigan, that this bottle might be a little on the old side. Maybe my taste is not that refined, but I was disappointed with this one."
"surprisingly drinkable for a high abv beer. you won't be tipping back very many of these, but it's delicious and certainly worthy of it's reputation."
"D- Alcohol is a little bit abrasive which hurts its drinkability. The alcohol seems to take over the hop qualities. I prefer the 60 minute with its better hop/malt balance."
"Poured into a tulip glass. This bottle has a bottled on date of 1/19/10. Been a while since I had this one so I thought it was high time to give it another go. Great amber color, head formation and retention. Bright, fresh hops on the nose rounded by an underlying malty sweetness. The hops might not be as fresh as you would like but a few months hasn't hurt this beer too much. It has a supple texture without being overly malty like some high ABV imperials can err towards. The hops are at the fore throughout. Start to finish the malt stays in the background, allowing the hops to be prominently displayed without being overpowering. This might not pack the IBUs but its well-rounded character makes it very drinkable. I wish they would put this in a bomber."
"A tasty IIPA. It would probably be better if it was just a touch fresher but I really enjoyed this."
"Overall a very well balanced and complex brew. Sixer worthy and would seek it out on tap. I am relatively new to imperial IPA and have been impressed with my first two selections. Had the Stoudts prior to this one, both great. Stoudts a little sweeter, with the Dogfish somewhat more hoppy and complex. recommend both."
"D: The strong alcohol and massive flavor to this beer make it a sampler but not a guzzler, I would only drink one of these before moving on in a night. A good once in a while beer."
"D: Has a great hop complexity and punch: I would definitely have another."
"Happily encountered at the Colgate Inn's Tap Room in Hamilton, NY this favorite shows a clear yellow copper color with a goodly white cover that sticks, leaving a thick fuzzy lace. The aroma says lemon hops, somewhat light and polite and simple, nice. It's nearly full bodied, this luscious feeling brew brings on a beautiful floral/citrus hop blend. Very tasty and pretty easy drinking with spritely carbonation. There's a bit of sweet syrupy biscuit going on. Overall, a delight. A standby as always."
"The mouthfeel is slightly sticky, but also has a decent amount of carbonation. This is incredibly drinkable. Something that goes down smooth and isn't too bitter to kill your palate quickly. Will definitely buy this again, very impressed"
"Give it a try!"
"D: At 9%, this is a hefty brew, but it doesn't always feel like it. Although I may want to drink this IPA all night, discretion is the better part of valour. A bit pricey, but highly recommended for anyone who likes beer. One of my all-time favourites."
"I like Dogfish Head. I like IPAs. This is good."
"The A: is an amber look. Similar to most ipa's. Tastes great. Hoppy, similar piney taste. Very Nice. I could drink this as long as my tolerence would let me. If you aren't a big IPA fan, give this a shot then see what you think"
"D- This is a great DIPA, but there is some room for improvement. It is very tasty, smooth, and smells great. I have no problem drinking 3 or 4 in a night, but you need to keep it mind that it is 9% ABV because it can really sneak up on you."
"D) A well crafted brew. Pour me another!"
"I still don't think this is much of a DIPA but it is still a very drinkable beer with great balance. I would add it has a bit of pepper and citrus as well. It has a bit of a musty aroma and I would bet this beer can change with a bit of time but without a date, who knows? I need to try it fresh."
"Drinkability: To me, the 90 minute has the best balance of depth and complexity of the Dogfish Head offerings. Carefully constructed, with a great taste and full aroma that make it a pleasure to drink. The biggest risk is consuming it too quickly."
"A sticky, creamy head that laces heavily with each sip. A burnt orange, amber color. Sweetness on the nose. Strong malts & hops as well. Pleasantly strong alcohol flavor. I like it! Strong hops. Sweet fruits. Grassy. Hops again. I loved my 4-pack. Can't wait to grab another!"
"Nose is as balanced as the taste. Malts are there and so are the hops. Sweet, citrus. Mouthfeel is medium. Taste is complex - citrus (lemon, grapefruit) with strong malt backbone. Some alcohol warming but subtle. Balance is the word that typifies this beer - malt and hops, sweet and bitter, etc. A good Double IPA for people to try who aren't looking for extremely bitter which is so common in this style. By the number of reviews, EVERYONE knows this beer. It's no wonder - great beer, reasonably priced and widely distributed. I like the 60, the 120 not at all, and yep, this is the perfect compromise. If you are one of the few who has not had this, you need to."
"Overall: The perfect sipper. The perfect beer. Do not miss out on this. I'm sure there are better beers, even of this style, but Dogfish Head 90 Minute takes home the gold."
"Pours a medium amber, with a straw colored head. On the nose I get citrus, grapefruit and malt. Flavors are somewhat muted, and not as big and bold as I would have liked. This one is something like a double pale ale, as the big, bold, hoppy flavors I expected are not there. Good, but nothing special."
"D: Incredibly easy drinking and sessionable beer. Wish we could get this here. A little alcohol warmth, but overall a great DIPA when you don't want your palate ruined."
"D - Drank 3 of these in 30 minutes one day and was almost on the floor. That might just mean I'm a pussy, but this beer has something to do with it. Delicious, delicious, delicious, but definitely a beer to be sipped. If it's sipped, I would argue that it's drinkability is pretty damned decent. Maybe the beer that I hope to drink most frequently in my life. But let's hope I get a good job - $11 bucks or so for a 4 pack."
"One of the best beers I've tried yet, I'll certainly be picking more up so that I never run out."
"O: Excellent drinkability. Perfection"
"Amazingly balanced, dangerously drinkable."
"Overall, this is a good offering from DFH, a little sweeter than I like my IPAs, but I like this better than the 120 minute IPA."
"D: ...and if I'm that anxious to continue on with the beer, it's done something right. Fun and surprising without being complicated or convoluted."
"Overall, like many fine D.I.P.A.'s this one goes down quite well and it is easy to drink a few of these before one notices the alcohol."
"Overall it's a great take on the ipa style which has so many variants now it's awesome and I love having one that defines its own category which this definitely does. Kudos again to Dogfish Head who has never ever let me down, always drop a lot of dough on these and it's ALWAYS worth it. They take their brewing seriously and obviously don't lie when they say they like to enjoy their beers as well as brew them because nobody else would take that kind of pride."
"D-this is a great beer; good price and availability. at 9% its hardly noticeable; it has a nice blend of hop bitterness and a semi-sweet fruitiness that can appeal to hop heads and people that enjoy a slight bite of hops."
"D-- Where's the alcohol? Easy to drink, fun to drink. It feels respectable and I can really enjoy this brew, not wondering what my next stop is going to be."
"Drinkability is pretty good, especially considering its ABV. Overall the alcohol is pretty well-concealed. Even better than the 60 minute."
"Russian River may make better versions of the style but this is still a classic"
"D: A great brew to have with dinner."
"Notes: This beer ages rather well, and becomes something completely different. I cellared a case of 90 minute IPA for two years. The beer developed a molasses, caramel sweetness, the hop profile drastically faded, and the beer basically turned into an American Strong Ale. Interesting, if nothing else."
"In any case, a very good brew."
"D- Very drinkable! If you're not a fan of bitter beers, this probably won't work for you, but if you don't mind them, its pretty great. The hit of bitter pine near the end...god, its so refreshing! I've got 60 and 90 out of the way and liked them both...time to see if I can brave 120 and survive!"
"Definitely a solid brew and at 9.0 worth the price of admission."
"I love my IPAs and this is definately one which some might consider a """standard.""" The composition and balance are outstanding and every portion of the tasting reflects this. It's a very strong brew, but it's not """over the top," so it remains accessable. Dogfish Head is known for some of their unconventional brews, but this should appeal to virtually every beer affectionado - try one if you haven't done so already. Hopefully, you'll add it to your list of favorites as I have."
"D - A very drinkable DIPA. An excellent beer that I would definitely buy again."
"All in all awesome for me. Pick up a 4 pack and try it for yourself."
"lots of head on the pour, not sure if that was my fault of just the beer. orange-amber color with a hoppy smell. first taste very hoppy, sweet, and extremely delicious. Of the beers i've tried this is probably one of my favorites. very easy to drink, almost goes down too smooth."
"D-Excellent beer. Can't wait to crack the next one."
"M/D- one word- awesome"
"The flavor hits me first with a balance of robust English barley and a smaller hop presence that grows after just a moment. The taste is bitter herbs and has stickiness on the tongue that causes the flavor to last a long time. Over all this is a great tasting IIPA, and offers more balance and duality than some pure hop bombs... and this is still a really hoppy beer. The mouth feel is rich, full, and sticky."
"Absolutely one of my favorite beers, I only wish I lived closer to the brewery!! Haven't found it on tap yet in Vermont. I'm in love with the smell and the color once poured, and tasting it reminds me of the feeling the guys in """Beerfest""" felt when trying their beer recipe. Absolute bliss."
"D- DFH 90min equals the leader in DIPA. This brew is so tasty. Combining hops and malt with exceptional flavor makes this a brew to talk about. In all honesty, I cannot think of a craft that better exemplifies the """gateway brew.""" 90 min introduces a treat that is not easily compared. This will be something I showcase to everyone as a perfect example of an piece of craft beer art"
"For me....it's now primarily the question of a good beer with foods that happen to compliment...rather than the other way around. I think that's part of 'respecting beer.'"
"Overall, another masterful IPA from Dogfish."
"overall a great dipa fresh - age at your own risk"
"D- quite well for such a potent beer, that proves even east coast DIPA's can hold their own against the great western juggernauts"
"M/D: Slight resiny stickiness, but overall smooth and enjoyable. Appropriate carbonation, mild EtOH presence but much much less than most beers with this ABV and body."
"I love it in a bottle, but it is also amazing on tap."
"I drank a four pack of these the other night, but you certainly dont enjoy it as much by the 3rd or 4th. Excellent beer but its best enjoyed singularly as the taste could get overwhelming after a while."
"Overall, it is a nice Double IPA that I wish I could get at home."
"My go to high end bottle when I truly want to treat myself. Probably the most well made beer I have ever had. The head is perfect in my humble opinion, the color is amazing also. Then the flavor, mouth-feel, and aroma hit you. Amazing balance on all levels. Today is my birthday, I know what I am drinking."
"This beer was the first Double IPA that I ever tried (6 years ago)- and was my initiation from fizzy yellow lager into craft brew. What was initially a stunning negative impression has grown to become a style of Ale that always presents a myriad of flavors and options. This is craft brew at it's hoppy best."
"This pours a very nice orange copper color with a small head. You can smell the piny sitrus of the hops and it has that hop citrus flavor in a big, bold way but not overpowering with bitterness which makes it quite drinkable. Surpisingly high in alcohol even though I could drink a lot of these."
"Very easy drinking DIPA at 9% and even though you can taste the alcohol its hidden well enough."
"Overall, a solid DIPA but not one of my favorites. If you are into a detectable balancing sweetness and pine over fruit flavors in your IPA/DIPA, then this would probably be right up your alley. In the end for me though, despite being a solid beer, the sweetness crept up on me a bit too much."
"Overall impression: Disappointing take on the style."
"I was a little taken back by the price but then tasted every cent later on that night making it completely worth it!"
"D: Excellent IPA, love the hops, but beware of the 9% as it will catch up quickly."
"All in all, this is a good brew. If you like IPA's you will definitely enjoy. It offers the same as a standard IPA but also brings some interesting flavors to the table. If you like the sweeter side of beer, then this is not for you."
"Very solid, BALANCED DIPA."
"This is an excellent IPA but I do not like the slight hint of alcohol in the aftertaste. I think the 60 minute IPA is much better for my taste because it is not as intense. Still overall I rate this beer 9/10."
"Pours a clear dark copper with a good head and decent lacing. Aroma of grapefruit, some pine, caramel malt and a bit of toastyness. Taste is well balanced. Plenty of grapefruit, pine and some pepperyness. Malt is caramel and biscuit and is well balanced with the bitterness. I am also detecting some toastyness in the finish. The 9% alcohol is completely hidden and does not show up till the beer is in my belly. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice long finish that ends up surprisingly dry. Drinkablilty is good for a double IPA. One of my go-to IPAs."
"D- Really good! Only downside is that if I were to drink 8 of them I'd be on the floor!"
"Bottle from jprime. Nice copper pour with thin white head. Aroma is mainly cookie dough, lots of peppery hop some nuts and toffee too. Taste is relatively sweet, brandy like with a bitter hoppy backdrop. Very palatable beer, carbonation just managing to break through all that syrupy sweetness. The bottle was a little old and thus a little less hoppy, which I liked. One of the best Imperial IPA I've had, thanks again Jeff."
"Ridiculously drinkable. A real pleasure."
"If you have the chance to drink this beer DON'T MISS IT!"
"Drinkability is decent, probably won't be seeking out this beer again."
"I've had this beer several times... A couple times at Toronado and a couple times at Stone. Every time I happen to come across this beer, it tastes different. The most recent time was a couple nights ago at Stone Brewery. For some odd reason, I don't know if it was that particular batch... But it wasn't anything like I remembered. It looked nice the small 8 oz. tulip glass they served it in. A little bit of head, smelled awesome. The taste just didn't do it for me this time. What I remember it to be all those previous times I've had it was awesome. I rated it as one of my faves. Unfortunately, it didn't do me any good this last time. We'll see what happens the next time it rolls around..."
"Mouthfeel is powerful, but not astringent. Clean finish."
"D - Highly drinkable for 9%, I threw back two before I realized how high the ABV was."
"Overall, a four pack is worth every bit of 14 dollars. This may very well be the best IIPA i've had the pleasure of trying. I loved the tropical fruit and cherry character throughout this one."
"As for drinkability, like I said, this one is on tap in the basement. I have it at least three days a week. It's what I measure all other IPA's up against. I've had better, but this one is definitely top notch."
"D: uh, this one is really strong. I'm content with just one, and it's drinkable at that. Just a really dynamic and flavorful beer, bold yet balanced."
"355ml bottle purchased by my girlfriend at Beer World in Largo, FL. As a hop head, I've been waiting to try this beer for quite some time. Rated as one of the best brews in the U.S., so I'm expecting a lot here. Pours a cloudy orange/amber with a ring of eggshell white head and stringy lace on the pint glass. Smell and taste are cedar needles, citrus zest, orange peel, sweet and toasty caramel malt, tangerine, and bitter hops. Grapefruit on the nose but not in the flavour. A bit woody as well. The alcohol is more prominent than I anticipated. Creamy and smooth mouthfeel, somewhat syrupy, great bite from the hops, sticky and dry finish is surprisingly balanced. An east coast DIPA in the truest sense of the term, as the IBUs are kept in check by a strong malt presence. Great beer."
"D-a very good brew with a complex taste and is still pretty refreshing for being 9% but still is a beer that must be drunk with caution"
"$10 for 4 12oz bottles"
"This is one of my favorite beers from Dogfish Head Brewery and currently my favorite IPA."
"This is a superb beer, delicious, easy to drink, and wonderfully enjoyable. A big thumbs up to Sam and crew at DFH."
"Most flavor of any IPA ive had, less drinkability"
"I bought this in a 4 pack from my local liquor store and poured it into a tulip to allow the powerful aroma to come out.This beer has an amazing color to it , it almost glows a beautiful amber color and has a intoxicating scent. The head is ample and long lasting with amazing peaks and the lacing is crazy.This is a very strong beer it is very easy to get a little to tipsy from it but if consumed responably they are very enjoyable I definitly recomend it."
"SkÅL!"
"D: This is very drinkable. I can really appreciate the balance of the malts with the hops. Too often do DIPAs forget completely about robust malt flavors..."
"D- This is so drinkable it's dangerous. Never would've been able to guess 9% had I not already had it so many times. Could finish a four pack with a smile...any more and they would finish me."
"Drinkability - A dangerously drinkable beer, but is much better when enjoyed slowly."
"Overal, this is one of the best beers I have ever had. Great brew. I'd recommend to anyone who loves, or is looking to get into, IPAs."
"Over all A+ I really dug it."
"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle dated 12/02/09. Dark honey color with one finger of foam. I could smell the hops as soon as I poured this beer. The taste up front is floral hops and malt with a noticeable carmel flavor. The sweetness of the malt is offset by the tangy citrus hop flavor. This is a well balanced easy to drink beer. The tanginess made me want to drink quicker than I knew I should. Each sip begging for another. The 9% ABV does not clobber your taste buds, but it will creep up on you. This is a tough one to put down. I'll be buying this beer again."
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle (dated 10 -26-09) into a pilsner glass. Gorgeous, golden honey color with a huge head of thick creamy foam and lots of bubbles. Thick, heavy lacing all down the glass. Big, hopped up aroma with hints of citrus-pine. Nose candy for me! Very hoppy, somewhat caramel taste with a piney-spicey flavor at the finish. Not as bitter as the Stone's dipa,s. Mouthfeel is medium to creamy and goes down smooth. Nicely drinkable and not too strong and over the top (for me anyway). A great beer all in all."
"M/D - Medium bodied, full hop flavor but smooth even through it had a little hop bit at the end. Glad I picked up a 4 pack of this and plan to review after the rest age a while. I highly recommend this if you're into the IPA's and would like to try and review the 60 and 120 minute IPA's. I will for sure have this again and will purchase again."
"D: I wish I wasn't a poor student and could afford more! An excellent beer that I will drink time and time again!"
"I have this beer on tap at my house and wow people get silly really fast and unexpectedly, i never tell them it is 9%. Enjoy this beer it is my favorite!!!"
"Note: I was having a sloppy joe at the time and it went very well with this IPA :)"
"M/D- Medium bodied. fits this beer well. Drinks exceptionally well considering the 9% ABV on it."
"D: easy to drink a ton of. The high ABV makes it a little harder but if I'm not going anywhere a 4 pack of these is nothing."
"D: I could definitely drink a few of these, but the ABV of 9% might sneak in and cause some havoc. Such a well proportioned brew that also hides the alcohol very well. I absolutely recommend this brew to anyone who likes good beer. You don't really need to be a hophead to enjoy this one. Though, having at least some experience with ADIPA's will help."
"D - exceptional. Here's a 9% beer that's intensely flavored toward a style I don't really like, but with each sip I can't wait for the next. Sign of true craftsmanship."
"It is a sad thing when you must review a beer of this caliber when you've head one too many. I've had this before, but that was before becoming a beeradvocate. Let me just say this...perfectly balanced double ipa with a nice solid malt backbone that stays there through the finish. So drinkable that you just can't get sick of it. Sooo beautiful. If you like ipas at all you must have some dogfish head."
"Sam is right in saying that it's a nice stage for the complexity of the hop flavor without being overly bitter."
"D: As I noted above, this seems more like a barleywine than DIPA in taste. The malt is just as, if not more, prominent than the hops in this quaff. It's an interesting and complex brew for sure, but I'm not totally into it. IMHO there's just a little too much booze and malt sweetness in the flavor for a DIPA. I've had this on tap before and recall enjoying more than this bottle. I'll have to write a review next time I get it at the local pub."
"Taste: Sweet malty body and an acidic smack of fruity hops. Somewhat oily from the abundance of hops."
"I have had this on tap several times, and it never disappoints as one of my overall favorite beers. It is truly exceptional. Yet, having polished off several 4-packs, I can say it just doesn't impress quite as much bottled. No big surprise there, but it is still very good and deserving of it's overall high praise. Unfortunately, the flavors just don't pop as much bottled, and the mouthfeel seems a bit thinner as well."
"Excellent beer, great as an exemplary DIPA, showcasing the malts almost equally to the hops."
"My favorite IPA of all brewers and one of my top ten beers of all time."
"a good DIPA. IMO, the malts are too heavy and take away from the hops. this was one of the first DIPA's i had although i am not sure why i never reviewed it. given the high ABV, maybe one at a time but i do enjoy them from time to time."
"Original review: One of the first beers I ever had that really """blew me away""". I've had a ton of these but this is my first in 4 or 5 months. Pours dark orange, nice fluffy white head. Turns into a thick ring around the edge of the glass. Ah, that great grapefruit/citrus smell I remember so well. Still tastes as great as I remember. Caramel, grapefruit, heavy perfumey sweetness, slight tropical fruit (pineapple), resin. Unfortunately a little alcohol bite turns into alot over time and kind of drags down the great taste, shame. Mouthfeel however otherwise is perfect, very smooth and oily, works great here. Drinkability suffers a bit because of the alcohol bite and heaviness. Not many double IPA's grab my attention (I've always preferred regular IPA's) but this one does. A classic."
"I've used this beer on a number of occasions to teach people how to love hoppy beers who typically avoid the bitter flavors of IPAs (my wife included!)"
"Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA and I have to say that Sam C. at Dogfish Head got this one spot on. A lot of DIPA's are so highly hopped that they must be overly-compensated with malts, but this one clearly makes the hops the central focus of the beer. This is one hell of a bold and complex brew and one of the better IPA/DIPA's I've had. If you haven't had this brew, you should really get one the next time you go to the store. Great beer."
"Drinkability: Its so easy to drink you can put back the 4pk in a sitting. Once you stand up, you begin to get hit. Its nice."
"Best American IPA? Darn close if not damn right. It's got a huge floral hop profile, and it's got the right malt balance to keep it from being one-dimentional. I really can't think of anything negative to say about this one. It's cheap for the quality and hefty 9% ABV. If you don't like all the hops, try the 60 minute, or if you're a glutton for hops try the 120. Awesome, totally awesome."
"I expected to be blasted with hops, but this beer was so surprisingly balanced. The hops are insane, but they balanced quite nicely by a fruity, almost apricot taste. And at 1 pint, 9 oz, and 9% abv, one bottle is enough to put you in your happy place. 2 of these will put you away! Great Beer as exspected"
"Pours a hazy amber color with a thick two finger, white head. The brew has good head retention and the frothy head continues to give of the sweet malty aroma sip after sip. Although the nose is mainly malty, there is a very subtle background of floral hops and vinous characteristics. The flavor is also very malty and sweet, even a little grainy with only hints of hops and an increasingly vinous taste as the drink finishes. The end comes slowly with a mix of port and sweet malt fading to the end."
"The feel had lots of body, very creamy and smooth. Carbonation kept the feel lively as it went down. This beer isn't a brutal hop curbstomp if that's what your looking for.... but I think it hits in all the right places, and it's damn good."
" Apart from the sweet malt overpowering everything else, this was pretty tasty."
"D-For a DIPA, this is very drinkable. I can easily drink several of these is a sitting."
"bottled 2/10/09"
"Taste is syrupy, smooth. Reminiscent of nugget nectar, but not as in your face. Malt balances well with the floral hops. Neither try to dominate the other. Bitter hop finish makes it a bit chewy."
"EDIT-TO-ADD: I have been encountering bad bottles of the 90 Minute, all bottled 9/09. Skunked smell is the only aroma, with sour flavor like a bad cup of watery coffee. Yuck. What a shame. Defective from brewery? Bad handling/storage? Age? A sublime ale when in perfect condition, but like anything, caveat emptor."
"D: Drinkable, and I give it credit here hoping better fresh."
"One finger white head tiny bubbles, fairly quick dissipation nice lacing,Clear copper body, a bit of visible carbonation. Nose features citrus notes, a bit of pine, and a firm bready malt backbone. Taste is citrus hop sweet grapefruit followed by pears and noble hops in the middle, sweet malts, and a mild bitter finish. Taste is nicely balanced, quite complex, not a huge hop bomb. Nicely carbonated mouthfeel, a bit sticky at the end. Not sessionable, but certainly drinkable even at this ABV. I've had this a number of times, and it's always a welcome treat. Reminds me of Bend Brewing Hop Head, high praise indeed. Very highly recommended."
"D- Good beer! This is something to drink as you're relaxing (or doing homework, in my case). I could easily put away a 6 pack!"
"D: this is a good beer but is lacking in complexity the hops seem to hide good things that the malts and booze seem to offer. this one could be better with age."
"Another fantastic beverage from my favorite Brewery. Looks great, tastes great, not much else to say except to try it for yourself. Nice thick head and it leaves a ton of lace on the glass. Fruity and hoppy. The only IPA better then this is 120 minute but for 1/8th the price its a good substitute."
"By nature, IPAs are not very sessional beers in my opinion, but this one is sweeter than those I've had in the past and about as sessional as an IPA gets."
"Everything in this beer is a terrific balance of acidity, viscosity, sweetness and hop bunch - a delicate, bold balancing act. Very enjoyable, very drinkable and well deserving of the repeated acclaim."
"I can drink a max of 2 or 3 of these in a sitting excellent beer and masks the alcohol very very well A+"
"Like Stone's Arrogant Bastard, DFH 90min IPA is as good as you'd expect the flagship beer of a premier American craft brewery to be (ie excellent). It's a bit... brash, at least in comparison to Squall IPA, which is my only real criticism (a somewhat half-hearted criticism to be honest). The flavors and aroma are bold and exquisite. A classic beer that should be tried by everyone who even remotely likes beer."
"Overall this really is a quintessential gateway DIPA. The hops are there, but not over the top and the sweetness from the caramel malts does a nice job of balancing things out. Worth a shot."
"D: Alcohol is hardly noticeable. Body isn't overwhelming."
"D- Beware of its drink-ability, or its a.p.v. will get you. There is an alcohol presence which I dont mind. Not for the timid."
"Listed as a top IPA - not as sweet as Hopslam or as overwhelming hoppy as Double Simcoe; but it is extremely complicated and well balanced, yet very easy to drink."
"Drinkablity: Surprisingly high, perhaps because it isn't all that heavy. No sign of palate fatigue. The 9% might catch up with you, though."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a wonderfully clear golden color with a crispy white 2 finger head that settles into a uneven cap leaving super sticky lacing down the glass. The transparency of this brew is amazing considering the amount of hops used to brew it. The aroma is full of all sorts of hop goodness; taking you from floral notes, to citrus, pine needles, and some grapefruit. The taste starts with a lot of floral flavors, with the lemon and orange following, finishing with a very light bitterness. This brew has a medium to light body, but the carbonation carries the flavors. Such a good IPA, if I had not had the 120 minute I would think this would be tuff to beat!"
"This review was made after going through DFH 60, 90, and 120 in a row at The City Tavern in Saratoga, NY. Hopefully I wasn't swayed by the fact that I was used to DFH's IPA flavor..."
"A clear pale copper color pour with a rocky offwhite head , long lasting leaving plenty of lacing behind. Aroma is quite piny with some nice citrusy notes mixed in with it , lightly sweet , a touch earthy. Flavor is ever so malty up front , nice and toasty and then fades to a nice hop profile of resin and citrus and spicy hops , nice level of bitterness , dry finish , full body with out being too sweet or sticky , crisp clean mouthfeel with a dry hoppy finish , very drinkable and one damm fine glass of beer"
"D: This is a strong ABV, and a glass of this will testify to that, but in terms of all night enjoyment... go for it, this beer is so tasty and so excellently crafted, that drinking this all night and exploring all of its characteristics seems very worth the while."
"Smooth mouthfeel. Not high in carbonation- slightly syrupy and mouthcoating. Goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more."
"Poured into a tumbler it produces a quarter-inch head that leaves solid lacing. The appearance is amber and clear. The aroma is of mouth watering citrus hops and strong roasted malts. The taste is moderately bitter with hops and there is much maltiness. The feel is medium bodied and the finish alcoholic. There is nice alcoholic warmth. This is a very nice and enjoyable strong ale."
"d- too hoppy for more than one at a time, imo"
"D: All around delicious and drinkable, not as bitter as other DIPA's, perfectly balanced and dangerous at 9%."
"Taste, much sweeter than I even expected in my skewed idea of what DFH brings to the table. I liked it, don't get me wrong, but geez, $10 a 4 pack for this? Tastes more like old English barleywine poured into an IPA. Don't see the hoppy pine descriptions I hear about. Very malt heavy, which might hide some of it. Mouthfeel and drinkability suffer, as you just expect more from a beer advertised as such."
"Extremely drinkable given the style and ABV. This really is a nice beer and catches a lot of unwarranted flack out here in CA."
"Impression: Looking for an unbalanced, hop atomic bomb? Not for you. Looking for a wimpy no flavor IIPA? Not for you. Looking for a full flavored and balanced very brightly hopped IIPA? Get a growler of this fersure."
"A clear golden-orange pour with a tiny white head that laces my glass nicely. Smells of hops quite strongly at first. Citrusy smells pervade my nostrils, oranges and grapefruits enter, but wait. what's that bringing up the rear. It's a beautiful bouquet of caramel, here to balance out the instant hop-death I'm preparing myself for. I taste it, and while those same hops are certainly present, the caramel does a wonderful job of balancing out that hop attack for a very smooth and balanced taste that I wasn't expecting out of a DIPA. Carbonation is a bit high, and the alcohol is definitely quite noticeable, but what do you expect with a 9% abv beer? This a delicious little brew that gets my wholehearted seal of approval"
"Overall this has been one of my favorite DIPAs over the years and perhaps my first ever. Unfortunately, this beer seems to be quite inconsistent regarding its flavor profile. Highly recommended on-tap and just recommended out of the bottle."
"Feels great at first sip, very smooth and easy to drink. Almost too easy to drink, due to the high alcohol content. This is one of my """go to""" beers, being an excellent value and very good in the taste and smell department."
"90min was a very good beer. I thought it was lacking in the hops department for an imperial ipa. It pours well with great lacing. I liked how smooth a finish it has. Overall this beer was very good but as a hop head I crave a much hoppier beer. I would recommend to someone who likes mild hops but for hop head i recommend hopslam."
"D - Slightly bitter to this reviewer with the first few sips, but the beer grows on you the more you drink it. Love the beer. Could not put it down."
"D: Would have another, but not more than two. High abv and the """fullness""" of the drink is almost a meal in and of itself."
"M - Medium/thin bodied, low carbonation."
"Over all a very good smooth Imperial IPA which has some nice kick at 9%ABV."
"D-Pretty easy to drink, but as with some of DFH's other beers, the price is a little hard to justify."
"Drinkability - would someone have more than one of these at a time? I never have. Good to start a night off, like I am tonight, but one will be all."
"D - Being that this is an Imperial IPA, I found this to be amazingly drinkable compared to others in this style. The malt balance might have helped this for me. This beer held my interest throughout, and I enjoyed it very much. I am glad I finally got my hands on some fresh ones - I have passed this beer up many times due to it sitting on shelves for a while. I can see why this is one the most-rated beers on this website."
"I really lucked out finding two singles of this at World Market in their singles section- so it was like a buck sixty per bottle. Totally worth that- if not the regular price."
"Feels great in the mouth. I can't wait to try this fresh."
"Drinkability - Pretty heavy even for a Imperial IPA, but surprisingly still very drinkable. I could see myself going through a 4 pack quickly."
"Pours a dark copper color with a nice frothy two finger head which gives way to some decent lacing. The aroma is a sweet malt backbone with some nutiness aroma and some bread there is also a nice floral hop aroma. The taste has a very nice sweet malt backbone with hints of nuts and breads. There is a floral hop taste midway through which is a nice balance. It isn't a hop bomb like the 60 minute more smooth. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with very little carbonation. Overall this is a very solid beer, the alcohol is well hidden and you can have these back to back to back and still want more."
"Each sip is packed with flavor and is delightful. However given its potency and palate fatiguing flavor I wouldn't consider having multiples in any one session."
"Taste: There is a very strong fruity bitterness that is followed by a slight berry sweetness and finishes off nicely with a bittneress not as stron as the initial one."
"Pours a nice amber gold color with a thin off white head. Aroma is sweet maltiness with a good floral hop smell. Flavor is a perfect balance of malts to hops, finishes clean and refreshing. Alcohol is well hidden. This is the perfect example of what an IPA should be."
"A great joy to indulge in."
"D- Not your typical DIPA, but nicely balanced like it's little sister the 60 minute IPA. I could drink these all night long, 9% abv be damned!"
"D: Overall a good beer that I probably unfairly had expectations for before the tasting. Would recommend. A different take on the DIPA."
"d- very drinkable, this is obviously a top notch dipa, and dogfish head really nailed this one, i shared a bottle with some non beer nerds and they really enjoyed it as well."
"D- I could drink a couple of these. Very easy drinking for a high abv beer. It doesn't tire the pallet like some big IPA's can do. Really an enjoyable beer."
"A very good DIPA with a very smooth mouthfeel. Overall I felt this wasn't hoppy enough and maybe a bit too sweet, still excellent nonetheless and worth trying at least once!"
"Note to Self: Ranked way down at #39 Top American Double / Imperial IPA when I tried it."
"D - This is a really classic DIPA and I realize as I drink this bottle that it has been far too long since I had one. The hop intensity is really substantial; bold enough to stand with such classics as Two Hearted, and quite reminiscent of that beer in particular. Despite the big hops, the malt manages to dominate the beer with huge, but never cloying, quantities of toast and brown sugar. The highlight of the beer is, appropriately enough, in the long, lingering aftertaste and takes the form of a sweet, orange-caramel hop note that coats the mouth but never become old or offensive. This is a really wonderful beer, and one that proves that east coast brewers can make 'em just as well as anyone in California."
"Very good beer but pretty sweet. I think the sweetness takes away from the flavor on this some and it could be better."
"Notes: Really, this is the kind of beer that will get wine drinkers (other than lambics and RIS's). It's complex, robust and smashes preconceptions about what beer is. We need more of these in Ontario and we need them soon."
"Notes: Remains a personal classic and a great draft serving but this one today... In general I´m finding they have the brews too cold for my liking at the ale house this time. In fact I´m not even sure I enjoy the snifter for this brew, I´d probably prefer it on a nice tulip glass, or an oversized snifter if anything. Hmmm, makes me think the bottle was far superior in any case."
"What was I talking about? Oh, yeah. This is one of my top couple of beers in the world."
"I would have been happier with less floral hops and more bitter. When its supposed to be 90 minutes of hops, I want to walk away looking like I sucked a grapefruit. The flavors balanced though, and I only fell once on the walk home."
"This beer is even better on draft than it is in a bottle. As easy as it is to get on the east coast it's one that I'll never shy away from. Great golden/brown color, good carbonation, excellent hop flavor and aroma...an all around perfect double ipa. I'm not a huge fan of the 120 but I love the 60 and 90 minute ipas."
"d. My last beer every time"
"Verdict: I was certainly surprised by this one. As I said, I was expecting a hop monster, and found a beer that strikes an incredible balance-not only between hops and malt, but also accommodating the 9% with remarkable drinkability. Although this is a great beer, I'm reluctant to give full marks due to arguably a philosophical difference: I think Imperial IPAs should have a greater hop presence than this one does. I remember an editorial in BA Magazine not too long ago lamenting the fact that most extreme brewing was just hops hops hops and nothing else. This does, indeed, break the mold insofar as it has remarkable hop-malt balance and drinkability for an IIPA. Still, even with the balance it has, I want at least a shade or two more hops here. Nonetheless, bravo."
"If you like Dogfish Head's 60 min IPA and are looking for a little more bite and flavor, you must check this beer out. Slightly stronger than the 60 min at 9% ABV, this beer has nice, colorful flavor, with a slightly less than smooth feel. If you like a good strong IPA, with fruitfulness and bite, this beer is for you."
"D: For a 9% beer, this is surprisingly lacking in the booziness department (and a welcome change from certain other DFH beers). That said, I still find it hard to stray from our West Coast IPAs which are just so much more hop-centric."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mainly of hops, some grapefruit. Taste is very hoppy, some grapefruit and very bitter. A tad to bitter for my liking. Feels bitter in the mouth and is definatly not a beer I could spend the evening drinking. Overall I believe this beer style is probably not for me, as I did not much care for this beer."
"I have had this beer many times and it is definitely one of my favorite DIPAs. Citrusy and malty sweet, the balance becomes more bitter (and therefore better balanced) as it warms and you drink. Not necessarily for the crazy hopheads out there, but this one is wonderfully balanced and delicious. Outstanding!"
"Cons : Came in a 4 pack. Really no cons here."
"D - The only thing really preventing me from drinking large quantities of this brew is the ABV, as well as the difficulty in finding fresh bottles. I've inadvertently purchased older bottles in the past (before I knew of the date-codes), or had this from old kegs, and it gets boozy and underwhelming pretty fast. I'm not sure who's at fault, but until I can reliably find bottles less than 6 weeks old this ain't getting more than a 4."
"D. It is very drinkable. You must be careful with beers this high in abv though so I would say that it is far from a session beer."
"an amber color with a off yellow head. consistent and not particularly sticky. nose of candy sweet and citrus fruit. a nice blend of bready nougat, pineapple, orange peel, and a earthy walnut finish that few accomplish. a tad sweet but a great one for those that are trying to introduce the double IPA into a traditional beer diet. sweet front, nice fruit in the middle, bitter finish with a nicely back malt quality."
"D - Dangerously drinkable."
"house beer"
"Mouthfeel is great, with a nice amount of carbonation throughout. The aftertaste makes me want more. This is extremely drinkable considering the alcohol content."
"this beer finishes with a med body and a nice citrus note that hangs in the nasal cavity as the tongue curls a bit from the bitterness. this is really jsut a great imperial and it gets the attention it does for good reason. wonderful!"
"Is it the best DIPA around? It just might be."
"What makes this beer not just good but great is its drinkability. Unlike 60-minute or Harpoon or a dozen others, drinking one of these doesn't leave the palate burned out -- and yet, this is a BIG, 9% beer, not some 3.5% English IPA tomfoolery. I feel like the only thing holding back this beer from unlimited drinkability is the alcohol content. And, unlike a 120, after 1, I feel just a little tempted to have more."
"D- A decent beer but it is almost too sweet for me and the mouthfeel seems a little on the syrupy side. A big beer though that has the ABV hidden quite well but I couldn't have more than one or two of these in a sitting."
"overall delicious."
"D: A flagship beer for the Imperial IPA category for sure. Not only does it make for a great IIPA, but a great overall beer. Simple, and complex - every sip is slightly different as it warms up in your hand. While it is at 9% abv I'd certainly drink this all night until I felt """comfortable""" and be extremely satisfied. A beer everyone must try -> highly recommended."
"This is a great IPA with high drinkability despite a high ABV. I could put back a few more if it didn't kick me in the face so hard."
"I'm not going to fault this beer based on the fact that it's a pretty malty and sweet DIPA, like a lot of reviewers do. Regardless of style pigeon-holes, this is a super tasty beer and suits me fine."
"This beer is almost obscenely drinkable. Almost."
"An above-standard IPA the tastes superb from pour to finish."
"Overall, this might be my second favorite DFH brew, just behind their Indian Brown Ale (due entirely to stylistic preference). It really lives up to the hype they try to build around the DFH brand... its very complex, has lots of different things going on, and is a very interesting experience to drink. I am very glad I picked this up and I'm glad I have three more sitting in the fridge, though I don't know if I will get this one again. However, I would recommend that every person who wants to drink good beer to pick this brew up! It is fantastic!"
"Dogfish's 90 minute pours slightly off-amber in a pint glass or tulip (if you prefer). Good head in the glass and WHAM! pine and grapefruit aroma fill the nose. First sip is delicious and hoppy, but a slam in the head. Not a session beer, but a damn good one!"
"15 minutes later...the lacing is still all over my empty glass!"
"For a beer with this high of an ABV and this assertive of a flavor profile, I'd say 90 Minute IPA is extremely drinkable. This is possibly my favorite Dogfish offering, and one that I wish I could afford to have around more often."
"Medium-heavy body nice carbination. Somewhat syurp like and surprise very smooth and balanced. Could drink this one anytime anywhere."
"D - I frequently purchase bottles of this one and consume them at room temperature."
"D - alcohol very notable, but this at 9%ABV can really catch up on you. drinks more like an over-hopped barleywine."
"With all the balanced flavors, this beer goes down quite easily. You can go through a few in a sitting, easily."
"This is a well weighted beer, goes down smoothly without a hitch. Great all around."
"burnt orange, hints of ruby.. thick foamy head that dies down to a thin layer. coats the sides of the glass well. the nose is a punch of hops. citrusy and oh so beautiful. love the multiple citrus fruits going on in there, maybe a hint of maltiness and caramel. the taste is definately bitter, citrusy... up front there is more of that caramel, then the hops come and thrash the tongue a bit. mouthfeel coats the tongue nicely, a bit syrupy. drinkability is insanely good. i can't believe this beer is 9%."
"a little less than a one finger head, some lacing. Very nice golden amber color. The smell is very hoppy with an abundance of citrus fruits. The taste is very fruity and sweet with more than enough hops to go around, some nice malt and alcohol as it goes down. Medium bodied and drinkable as well, a very good beer and an exeptional IPA."
"Probably the smoothest and most accessible of all the DIPAs, which is surprising given the reputation of DFH. Extremely drinkable; bitter, smooth & sweet are not qualities which usually meld together but they pull it off in spades here."
"D - I love a good hoppy beer and this one has been talked up quite a bit so I thought there was alot going to be some disappointment but I was pleasantly surprised. I love the hoppy and malty balance with the thick mouthfeel. I will definitely be drinking it again."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable for a 9% abv IPA! I like this style of IPA where it has more of a hop aroma and flavor profile rather than a hop bitterness profile. I can see why this is one of the best."
"Great beer. Sampled this beer initialy at THE PUB in Lakewood Ohio from a 12 oz bottle. I love Double IPAs but Dogfsih has created something special here. Above and beyond any IPA out there. Poured into my X-mas in July Winking Lizard glass. About a finger width of head and nice slightly reddish color. First sip instantly got my attention. I realized that I had found a top five beer. Great rich taste with lingering finish. Enjoyed every drop and couldn't wait for the next one. Keep up the good work there at DFH brewery. Cant wait to try the 120 IPA."
" ~ This is the best IPA I've ever had. I am so grateful to Mr. Mike Williams of Stevens Point, Wisconsin for his generosity. He traveled to Milwaukee and brought this beer back to me as a birthday gift, and what a gift it has been. My thanks also go out to his wife, Ranee, I don't doubt she too had a say in this wonderful beer choice. Thanks you two."
"Overall, there were a lot of things that I really like about this beer; however, I get the impression that my palate is not quite developed enough to fully enjoy this beer. I'll be curious to come back to this in the future after having more IPA's under my belt."
"I was hesitant to try this, as I am with most double IPAs, but this really was such a rewarding, tasty surprise. I'm going to try and pick some up for home."
"As the drink warmed I could sense the alcohol swirling around my mouth and the aroma being drawn through my nose. The 9% was quite evident as the beer warmed. Overall, I felt the beer was tremendously balanced between the hops and sweet barley taste. It is a fine beer and although I feel it fell short of a true imperial IPA, missing the pronounced bitterness notes, I found it hit its highs elsewhere and was quite satisfying."
"I enjoyed this brew though, nonetheless, but there are other DIPAs I prefer over this one."
"This is actually more drinkable and desirable than the 60 minute, especially for the broader audience. The extra hopping actually gives this a fruity hop taste that is more enjoyable. The look is fairly the same as the 60 minute but the aroma and flavor are miles apart. This is one of the best American IPA's in a bottle."
"it's a sweet, syrupy alcoholic mess of a beer and i love it. i used to hate it for these same reasons."
"I ventured into the craft beer world while living in Oregon, so this isn't quite what I was expecting from a double IPA. Nevertheless, I found it to be superbly balanced and very enjoyable."
"12oz bottle.Had this back in July in Detroit. Pours a dark amber red colour. Not a bad beer, I noticed a slight alc.% burn in the after taste though. Only thing knocking it from a higher rating for me. Maybe i'm just not ready for it yet, but solid over all."
"glassware: pint"
"Pours lively yellow-orange with a 1+ finger head that clings to the glass. Smell is of a single 90-minute hop addition, citrus fruit and pine resin- not as strong as expected, though. Bracing bitterness with a strong, sweet backbone, lingering grapefruity tang. Just the barest hint of the 9% ABV. Incredibly creamy, sticks to your tongue and makes itself comfortable. So sweet that you'd barely think anything of cracking open one after another- until you tried to stand."
"Drinkability: This is an almost perfectly balanced DIPA, that is what sets it apart from the others in this grossly overpopulated style. This is one of the only beers that I have been prepared to give a 5 to for drinkability, and considering this is a 9% beer, that is something special. Is it the best DIPA? It may very well be."
"The mouthfeel is medium, smooth and with medium carbonation. The 9% ABV is barely noticeable. All of this combines for a lethally drinkable brew. Instantly my favorite DIPA."
"I liked this beer. It tasted very good. But I tried to rate it according to style, and I think it missed the mark in the aroma and taste. More like a barleywine, or in between barleywine and DIPA."
"D. Drinkable and approachable due to the balance. A good beer and the flagship DFH IPA."
"Sweet pour, nice deep golden caramel color with a big honey colored head. Nose is hops, vanilla oak chips, brandy barrels and pine resin. I must say the nose is heavenly, with a welcome boozy profile.Tastes like it was aged in oak brandy barrels. Lots of pine, caramel and apricot in the flavor with a thick honey-like finish and feel to it. Many say this beer tastes too malty and I understand that-but this is a hop monster first and foremost. The only pro the malt character offers is a thicker feel, a sweeter profile and a more balanced finish. (Quite a plus I would say!) Outstanding example of the style. A sipper with a medium feel and a bitter oaky finish."
"D- one of the better ipa's I've had in a while. it only gets better as it warms. very smooth for 9% abv. very nice."
"Taste is sweet, warming, strong. Lots of back end bitterness, a nice thick feeling to this beer. Beer is shy on the front end of the palate, bitterness builds. There is a slight aftertaste, very interesting. This is a good beer. It has the characteristic malty sweetness other imperial IPAs have. Overall a good example."
"drinkability: I like this one, 9%alc. by volume makes it a little dangerous."
"I was glad to see the nearby liquor store, not known for a stellar beer selection, just got 90 minute in, and at a great price. I poured into my beer tasting wine glass and marveled at the deep amber reddish hue of this slightly cloudy brew. The white fluffy head was quickly eaten by the alcohol. The smell is fruity, piney, a little bit of alcohol. The taste is a little bit of pine, spice, grapefruit, and a plum sweetness. The alcohol warms nicely, has that nice east coast hop taste. Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky, but not offensively. Very drinkable, at 9% dangerously so. Just a great strong IPA, and a unique one."
"Overall- I didn't think this beer was quite at the level people have rated it, but good nonetheless. Appearance is fairly standard but would have liked it to be a bit more oily. Nice head and lacing. Smell and taste could have use a bit more floral hops in my opinion, but nice spicing and balance. Mouthfeel is on par, but again wish there was more oil. Drinkability was very good for the style."
"Mouthfeel is nice and refreshing with medium body true to style and you dont taste the booze - GOOD"
"I am making a bee-line for Kroger tomorrow to get a 6-pack of this stuff, because it's ridiculous. One of the best DIPA's I've ever had."
"d: this one, much as I love hops, I would call a bit TOO hoppy. this shortcoming will be overlooked in favor of the 9% alcohol. For most livers this cant be a real session beer but this is truly good stuff if a bit over the top."
"The benchmark for which all double IPA's east of California should be measured. Juicy citrus hops are bursting through the malt backbone in a way that tantalizes the tongue and spirit. Stupendous beer fresh, 6 months old, 12 months old or cellared. Amazing warm or cold, in sickness or in health."
"D: A consistently spot on, hop forward IPA. Good on tap and in the bottle."
"Overall, an excellent ADIPA that I highly recommend. It's an imperial but it won't shred your tongue so also a good one to share with friends new to the hoppier beers. Rotation: available here. will be in regular hops rotation."
"D: This beer is a classic. It is one of the top 5 East Coast DIPAS. Just be sure to check your bottled date."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle to glass. Copper color, generous foamy head. Strong aromatics, getting cereal, pine. Taste is very well balanced between aggressive amounts of bitter hops, sweet malt, and warm alcohol, which I think may also contribute to some apparent sweetness. Very creamy mouthfeel. Has a lot of coffee and bitter chocolate flavors on the finish. This is a very big beer, has a great flavor but drinkability is limited to just one bottle at a time for me. This had me feeling like I wanted a crisp summer ale afterwards, but no denying this is a very well made brew. Compared to the 60 min IPA, I think this comes across as more malty/sweet, as the 60 had a more obvious hop/bitter finish."
"Drinkability: Love to drink it but it's a palette buster."
"CHEERS!"
"this puzzle was put together very well,could drink this again and again. a truely great IPA ,it lives up to all the hype, one of the best IPA in America maybe the world."
"D: This is a delicious beer no matter how you define the Imperial IPA. For this genre, I don't think it's necessary for every DIPA to be a 100+ IBU facemelter. Sweet, but still aggressively hoppy, allowing an unusual balance for such a big beer."
"what can i say other then this is a great example of this style, well worth the money and seeking out for that matter."
"D: The high alcohol content didn't sneak up on me, it was very present the whole time. I only drank one, it was all I wanted to drink. Rich flavor makes for strong flavor, but I think it was too much."
"D- I would guess that a lot of hop heads would argue that this is too sweet to be a beer that is highly drinkable, but I think the sweetness molded with the bitterness makes this pretty enjoyable. Not hard to finish a beer let alone open up another one."
"Overall, a really good DIPA that lives up to the hype. I will be filling my growler with Huma Lupa Licious next time."
"Not a West Coast brew, no citrus to speak of. Heavy malts hide the 90 IBUs. Too hot and full bodied to be very drinkable. Still a heavyweight, though."
"This really is a great beer though, I mean a definite must try for someone who likes IPA's, and is sweeter than most IPA's due to the amount of caramel in the beer, but will finish like a normal IPA does, which is a hoppy bitterness."
"D I would have another one, my friend Mike may have a point here and I will definitely explore Dogfish Head more."
"D - A very solid DIPA that goes down pretty easily despite its fairly high ABV. I probably wouldn't want to drink more than one or two of the 12 oz bottles in a sitting, but I will definitely revisit this brew again."
"I'm a big fan of 60 min, so I've been waiting all week to try this beer. Pours a amber color with a thin layer of head that hung around for a while. Smells mostly of floral hops with some pine notes and a bit of maltyness mixed in. The taste, as expected, is a more intense 60 min. Wave upon wave of hop flavor, mixing between bitterness and citrus. Full bodied with some medicinal undertones, the balance is pretty darn good for the amount of hops they say they put in it. The finish is slightly lingering but not unpleasant. Overall, mighty tasty treat."
"This brew exchanges over the top hoppyness for balanced character and overall depth. This is a hop fix, no doubt, but its not quite the scorcher than some others are. You can drink more than one and not burn your tongue out."
"For my own personal records since everyone and there brother has had this beer. Pours a translucent orange amber. Two inches of thick white head. After it recededs I believe this is the thickest stickiest lacing I've ever seen. It coats the glass like gobs of pudding. The aroma is super piney, floral hops abound through the nostrils. Grapefruit and lemon are present as well. The flavor much smother then I expected. The hop kick is there but, the malt comes in and mellows everything out. It's piney and bitter fruit yet smooth like bourbon. Medium to full body little carbonation. Slight warming effect. I find this to be a perfect balance of hops and malt. I know why everyone holds this beer in such high regard."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. A perfect straight-from-the-cooler ice cold IPA option on a warm summer day. I will definitely seek this one out again when I'm in the mood for a great American IPA. The ABV is deceptively high, so watch out for that...because these beers go down VERY easily. This is easily my favorite IPA out there...and there are A LOT of them!"
"Tremendous hop aroma when poured into a standard 16 oz. pub glass. Beautiful copper color. Nice foamy head which slowly dissipates with each sip. Extremely smooth but with an almost single malt scotch flavor intertwining. Noticeable lacing which maintains a gentle spiral descent. An excellent IPA."
"D: This beer is something wonderful and is really making a strong pull for me to join the lighter side. An amazing example of the double/Imperial IPA style that I wouldn't mind enjoying again and again."
"this beer pours a nice golden color with a noticable copper hue toward the wider part of the glass. the thumb width head recedes to a nice ring and patches across the top. it effervesces a nice piney aroma with a surprisingly balanced malt and ester background. the taste follows with the expected hop bitterness, balanced by a nice sweet fruitiness toward the end. it certainly warms you a bit, but with the full body and nice hop arrangement, i'd say that this is a fine example of an imperial ipa, and not a hard drink for it's nine percent. I'm once again thankful for the growler fill at sam the beer man."
"Overall, this is a very good beer and one of the DIPA's I've bought consistently. The freshness date is there, so you know what your getting in to. A couple months of age doesn't really hurt this beer unlike some DIPA's, which I really give it credit for. I will try to age one of these for a year and see how it does, I'd imagine it can improve. Another note is that the squall IPA is very similar to this but with a more interesting, tropical fruit aroma and a much better mouthfeel."
"D: This beer is something wonderful and is really making a strong pull for me to join the lighter side. An amazing example of the double/Imperial IPA style that I wouldn't mind enjoying again and again."
"I love IMP IPA's and can't even begin to understand the buzz about this beer. In fact it makes me mad when its held up as the example of an east coast imp IPA, there are numerous better east coast ipa's. The alcohol stays on the palate for multiple minutes after drinking. I've had 90 min. now at least 6 times to try to be fair on the review and give it a chance and end up always drain pouring. There is no other imp ipa or ipa on the planet i'd choose DF 90 over."
"The beer pours a nice amber with a good 1 1/2 finger head which dissipates over time. Lacing is nice and sticky. This beer has some chewiness and some candy like esters. It's really a classic and unbelievably drinkable considering the ABV. A true American IPA of the highest standard!"
"In one word: decadent. Not a fan of IPAs, but this is very hard not to like. Rich, flavorful, hoppy but not bitter. Packs a punch for an IPA. A great beer."
"D - Easy going down."
"I would drink this again even if the bottles Ive had were off but i really want to try a fresh batch to see what all the fuss is about."
"Drinkability - I am impressed with how a beer with this high of an ABV and 90 IBU can be not a completely wet finish. It's not dry but crisp, making this a very enjoyable IPA."
"Taste is very sweet, with quite a bit of hoppiness but it's not quite as good as Pliny. There are still some toasty malty notes to it as well. It's a solid IPA, but not quote the hop flavor profile I was hoping for."
"D- quite drinkable for the ABV, not to mention it's damn fine brew, a def. must try for anyone into beer"
"Overall, I was very impressed with this DIPA. Not like the 1-D hop bombs that are so trendy within this style. Complex beyond my expectations. The malt is big and balances the hops perfectly - very enjoyable. Damn, too bad it's so expensive."
"This is one of my favorite offerings from Dogfish Head. To me it's the perfect balance between the hop explosion of 60 Minute IPA and the overly malty 120 Minute IPA"
" Sweet grassy, carrot juice like aroma. Hoppiness well balance by sweetness in malt. This is an exceptionally well balanced beer, very easy to drink."
"Overall: I was expecting a lot stronger and more bitterness from this Imperial IPA, however I was not at all disappointed. Very nice taste and great finish, however it didn't have all the robust characteristics of an IIPA. Great beer nonetheless"
"D- very clean beer. well done. disappointing though for an IIPA."
"D: Pretty drinkable for 9%, not too hoppy bitter, not too malty sweet, this one hits the mark especially for a DIPA. Overall this is a fantastic beer and one of the best out there in this category."
"In fact, the hopping seems very English and it gives this more of an American Strong Ale character than a DIPA. But it might just be that I'm used to the west coast Amarillo/Cascade hopped IPAs. The biggest character I get from here is the booziness. Very pleasant, this, but not a quaffer. Best enjoyed in moderation."
"overall its a pretty drinkable beer. Idk if it quite lived up to the hype for me, but it still is a good beer. I would have this again, and would like to try other DFH brews."
"D: This is one of the best DIPAs on the market. I hasten to say that this could very well be one of the best beers on the market, let alone DIPAs. I heartily recommend this selection."
"Drinkability: The hoppy bitterness is less than expected but still very enjoyable. I would say that the hops balance the malt in this IPA instead of the other way around. However it does it in such a way that I have never experienced before and that I can not completely describe. This is a great beer and I highly recommend it to anyone, I am on my way to buy more!!"
"Edit: Derek pulled out an aged version the other night that had 4 years on it. I'm shocked at how well this beer has held up. Bravo!"
"Pours a deep golden-honey orange with slightly off white thick creamy head. Smell is citrus hops and sweet malts along with taste. A pineapple-esque feel. The mouthfeel is creamy with a dlicious amount of carbonation. Very drinkable for a nine percent beer though the alcohol comes out more as the brew warms."
"I remember the first time I had an IPA from dogfish head and ever since that day, they keep growing on me."
"I haven't had any other Dogfish Head Craft Brews to compare but I can't imagine finding a better one."
"D - I would like to taste this fresh and on tap before I make my final judgment. But this DIPA isn't too impressive. But it seems like it's just not fresh enough."
"Clear amber with a decent head that quickly faded. A citrus aroma with malty sweetness backing it up. As to the taste, the citrus was there in the form of orange. So was the sweet malt, but with a pine needle bitter cast at the end. Feel was medium bodied with a slightly oily feel. Drinkability was good, but it's a 9.0 ABV, so be careful."
"crispy mouthfeel for an ipa. smooth on the palate. good carbonation level."
"Nice and smooth, not too viscous or thick. Despite the ABV, this is rather drinkable and forgiving on the palate. I had this years ago, but I think I like it much more now."
"Poured a brown/amber color. Smell of hops and a toasty malt. Taste is hoppy at first and then a nice toasty almost caramel malt finish. Good head retention and decent lacing. Mouthful is not that harsh but a decent thick body. This beer is off the charts on drinkability and I would have never guessed it to be at 9%. Its wise to sip this beer but could easily be drank by the pint. Another awesome DFH brew!"
"Overall, another great beer in a collection of great beers from Dogfish."
"Bought this at the Beer Yard in Wayne, PA and must regard it as one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Poured a translucent burnt honey. Smells of strong hops. Tastes of powerful hops. Mouthfeel delightfully syrupy. Drinkability still relatively high. This has usurped my favorite IPA: Prussia's Pride IPA from Rock Bottom."
"the high abv is making this one a sipper."
"Good balance of the bitterness of the hops and the fruit and sweetness of the malt."
"Pours an orange gold color with a white foamy head which leaves a beautiful sticky lace. The smell is grapefruit peelings and floral hops. Some malt sweetness is also present in the aroma. The flavor is the same as the aroma, but it is much sweeter than I would have expected.Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, and the alcohol is well disguised. The drinkability is quite good. I will pick this up again when I go to Hudson. I wish Dogfish Head sold their beers in Minnesota."
"I will not have this again."
"This is a well-regarded beer, so I can only assume I got a bad bottle."
"If there is such a thing, I would suggest this as the gateway DIPA. It has a lot of the beautiful characteristics classic to the style without the intimidation (that Stone Brew Co. brags about)."
"I was very excited to get to try this beer. Pours a nice orange color with an off white foamy head. Laced all the way down the glass. When I compare it to the 60 min IPA this one wins in every category. The smell of hops is better, color is richer. Im normally a fan of the Stone IPA but this one gets right in the top few favorite IPAs. I'll be coming back for more of this one."
"Very delicious! Easy to drink for a heavier IPA."
"my non-technical review of this is simply: i love this beer. i could drink this daily although not in the quantities I would like to or else I would likely not have a job. This was my first intro into Dogfish Head and has kept me coming back to try every variety I can get my hands on."
"Very sizable creamy white head tops off a clear orange body. Nice amount of lacing. Sweet malt on the nose backed by a very prominent floral hop arrangement. The taste starts with sweet caramel malt, but dominated by well-blended bitter and floral hop combinations. Spicy alcohol is present, but not overbearing. Medium bodied, wet mouth. Pretty solid IPA for sure."
"Drinkability: I could have several. The high percentage is masked by its smoothness."
"This tasted bitter, but not too bitter, and also nice and malty. I would have liked more hops flavor but that's just a preference. Cant' taste the alcohol at all even though it's 9% ABV. Overall good, I would recommend it."
"This IPA is wonderful through and through. The beer is poured with about an inch of head, good head retention, and slightly cloudy yellow. The nose feel is not overpowering, with a nice hop citrus smell. The hop taste is not overwhelming, and the bitterness does not linger on the tongue. The beer starts and finishes smooth, and has excellent drinkability."
"D: Very drinkable for a 9.0% ABV beer. Without food more than one would be a bit heavy."
"Mouthfeel is a smooth medium body with little carbonation that rolls off the tongue. Although it goes down smooth, the complex flavors and 9% ABV limit me to one, two at the most."
"D- I could put these down all night, but not at 9% abv. Very affordable for a Dogfish Head brew, will purchase again."
"D- Considering the ABV, this beer is extraordinarily drinkable, especially if you have a designated driver. A snifter of DFH 90 minute is one of my all-time greatest beer experiences. Truly a masterpiece.... If you ever see this on tap, order three!"
"What more can I say?"
"Can't say enough about how great this massive ipa is. Another hit from DFH. Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Golden color with amber tones. Great retention and lacing. Aroma is overwhelming, hop smack to the face. Tastes incredible hops, bready malts, warming alcohol. At 9.0 ABV this one is no joke. Highly recommended for you fellow hop fans out there."
"Overall this was a solid, solid beer, 120 is next up for me it appears."
"D: Here is the only fault, 9% ABV. Wonderful to drink, but i think one at a time is enough."
"D - Very good if you can handle a high ABV beer. I Recommend drinking these at home with friends."
"D-I would drink this all day if I could. So many beers, only one mouth."
"D: This is as drinkable as a 9% beer can be. Incredibly smooth and balanced, and packed with great flavor. I can sip these all night. Another excellent offering from DFH."
"I've waited to be able to taste this beer for a long time. I found some here at the Florida gulf Coast. Poured into a chilled pint glass. A large amount of white foam with lacing. Smelled hops before my nose was near the glass. I've had hopped up IPA before, but this is different. It is not as sharp, much more pleasant. First sip is so different from the smell as to be disconcerting. Hints of roasting and a depth of flavor that it is obvious why this beer has received so much praise. Dense on the tongue and full in the mouth. I will definately drink this again."
"Thank you, Dogfish Head."
"This one poured a bright amber/orange with some chill haze and a dense white head that sticks around for quite a while. Sticky, spotty lacing coats the glass. The aroma is all hops. Pungent, bitter, and minty. More strong pine than citrus. Not much malt showing through until it warms. Alcohol is apparent. Tastes very sharp. Lots of intense hop bitterness. Alcohol warmth in the finish. Not much balance in this one but that's not what I think they were going for. Crisp, fizzy mouthfeel compliments the hoppy edge nicely. The hoppiness works wonders in covering the alcohol, and enhances the overall drinkability. Far from my favorite DIPA, but good nonetheless."
"A very drinkabel brew, but the ABV will catch up with you."
"Average amount of body for the style. Nicely drinkable for a hop heavy beer. Worth trying."
"Enjoyed on the porch on a cool summer evening while reading The Satanic Verses for bookclub; a heavy brew for a heavy book :)"
"This taste is hoppy with a fruit, with a lite of bitterness at the end. This is a very good beer."
"Intense aroma and flavor. smells of citrous and malt with a kick in the face of hops. the flavor is hoptastic with pine, citrus, and some other herbs (perhaps grapefruit?). great feel, great taste, good level of carbonation. sweet but HOPPY, good mix, good beer."
"D- amazingly complex hop/malt notes and well hidden ABV"
"Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend that every beer lover try this beer. It's amazing stuff!!"
"Notes: I'm not a big hop head but this is a hop bomb that I can get into. It is big, bold and very tasty."
"The beer is very drinkable for those in love with big IPAs."
"Drinkability- excellent IPA, I loved it, will be drinking it again, It was super good. It was everything I thought it would be and highly recommended."
"i dunno... i guess i expected more out of dogfish."
"Medium carbonation with a delicious taste of hops and floral hops which had a sweet spicy finish; well balanced and smooth. The 9% ABV is not a factor as the hoppy floral flavor is so dominant that you can't taste or feel the alcohol because you are too busy enjoying the mix of flavors on the palate. Gets better as it warms up and is an excellent beer!"
"Drinkability: I tend to be pretty solid at picking out what the ABV of a beer is, but this would've struck me as maybe a 7. Definitely drinks like an IPA for a DIPA, and easily could've had another. Very solid, not out of this world, but still very good."
"D: In heaven, this is what they drink."
"DFH 90 Minute IPA is a wonderful after dinner sipper with the look and feel of an ale's ale. During, and for a long time after drinking this, you know you've had a beer."
"(D)- Despite its rather high abv, this is a pretty easy drinker. Its got all the classic DIPA characteristics plus a much sweeter/malty core. Even still, after 3 of these, you will be feeling it both in feeling full and from the alcohol!"
"This is my favorite DIPA because it is so drinkable."
"Drinkability- I could drink this all night. Superb for its alcohol."
"Anyways, a great brew. At the time of my review, it's not in the Top 100, but I've seen it there every couple of weeks. There is no denying why this is such a great brew and one that will be popular for a long time."
"I really wanted to like 90 Minute IPA from Dogfish Head Craft Brewery. With all of the great reviews here I thought I would be in beer heaven. Unfortunately, this beer disappoints on all levels. This beer is light in color with a small yet firm head. The taste is of hops with a good portion of alcohol. All in all, I must say that I find this beer unbalanced. Here is the best way I can describe it: Take a Harpoon IPA and add more alcohol to it and you have a DFH90. Think of it as an Imperial Harpoon IPA. Not my thing. Too much floral hops without any malt balance."
"I've had Dogfishhead's 60, 90, and 120 minute, and this is my favorite."
"OVerall, my bottle went quick. I could have easily drank more at 9%. I think it is a pretty solid DIPA, but nothing was very special here... and there really isn't anything wrong with that either."
"D- This beer is dangerously drinkable, I would drink another one if I had it. A definite recommendation for any fan of DIPA's."
"Lightly carbonated with a medium body. Drinkability is somewhat dangerous with the high abv, you really don't notice it too much at first but it definitely makes itself known little by little. Overall still very drinkable for 9% just don't let it sneak up on you too much."
"There seems to be a lot of hype about this beer. Best IPA in America? Not sure about that, but it is indeed very good. I'd like to try mixing one of these with a 60 minute. I think the result would be very interesting. Note: This is one beer that does not hide its ABV, especially as it warms...it gets very boozy."
"I poured this Imperial brew into a pint glass of the same name. It's a thick golden brown color not unlike clover honey. Moderate carbonation and a rich cream head that laces very nicely. This doesn't smell like any other IPA. It has toffee, brown sugar, mint, weeds type aroma. Kinda wild; hard to place. Mouthfeel is full with a interesting complexity of flavors like toast, peanuts, dates, lime, honey, coffee. Lingering bitterness. Finish is sweet flavor followed by a dry mouthfeel. Alcohol is evident not in taste but in effects on the mouth and brain. A very interesting beer with loads of complexity and brilliant mature flavors. Baffling. Enticing. Fulfilling."
"Drinkability: Besides for a slight alcohol taste, this is ridiculously easy to drink - dangerously so."
"This is a great beer, very malt forward for a DIPA. I think my bottle might have been a tad old as the hops aroma was almost non-existent. Still, a great example of an east coast IPA. Not my favorite, but good nonetheless."
"I've found this beer to be a bit better on tap than from the bottle.. Its sort of hard to really judge it.. its quite hoppy but so sweet that its almost bordering on the lines of hoppier barleywines.. pour is as beautiful as on tap.. Aroma is hoppy with a base of candy-like sugary sweetnes.. taste is similar, the hop is there but the sweetness is so powerful that it may be hard for some people to get past, which could affect its drinkability.. Mouth is also a bit strong on the sweetness, this could either be one of its highlights for some or, again, a downside for others. And we aren't talking about sweet hop beers like Ruination or so, the sweetness here is quite prominent. All in all, if you get a chance to try it on tap, do so. If you have a sweet tooth and enjoy a powerful display of hops and sugar, enjoy."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours with a deep red amber color with clear visibility and very nice large foamy slightly tan head. Aroma is strong with a the essence of a lot of hops. The taste is unlike any other IPA I've ever had. Robust hoppy flavor balanced by a ton of roasty barley. You almost feel like not putting the beer down once you take a sip. Bitter up front with a hybrid bitter/malty finish that takes you for a ride. Rings are full and last throughout the entire beer. Mouthfeel is exceptional and the drinkability is good, but at 9.0 ABV, you obviously can't drink 5 of them. This is definitely my favorite double IPA. Props to Dogfish Head"
"Not what I've come to expect from an IPA. Not bad, but a little missleading. Great cover on the 9% ABV. barley noticable. Drink improves after forgetting the absense of hop bite and the 9% kicks in!"
"Poured with an average-sized, white head and a clear body, with nice lacing. Nice, golden-copper color. The aroma hits you like a ton of bricks - light malt and yeast, heavy hops, and quite heavy on the alcohol... but in a good way. Light melon aroma as well. Great on the palate: medium body, average carbonation, with a bitter finish. As for the flavor, this beer is more alive than most I've tried. Lightly sweet, quite bitter, but not at all overpowering, and while you can taste the alcohol, you wouldn't necessarily guess that it's a 9% ABV. There's so much going on in this beer it's hard to put it in words. I've never been a huge IPA fan but this was quite the experience."
"Slightly dry after taste, which should be expected with the amount of hops in this thing. A great beer, glad I had and I will definately have again."
"DRINKABILITY... THIS IS MY DESERTED ISLAND BEER!!!"
"This is the smoothest DIPA I've had to date. Very mellow and creamy. Nice touch. This seems to have a bit of an 'age' on it for a hoppy beer (5 months), but from what I've read from other reviewers, age is good on the 90. The hops have definitely faded quite. There's a touch of hoppy piney bite on the tongue but it is very subtle. Rather, the malty sweetness plays a big part in this beer. Very caramelly and warm. I had to keep myself from chugging this beauty. Seriously. This was drinkable to the max. Smooth, creamy, sweet, and satisfying."
"Overall - An exceptional DIPA and one of the finest brews i've had full stop... outstanding and highly recommended. If only i could get my hands on a few more of these !!"
"well done, nicely balanced, but definitely a one off beer given the ABV...going to let one sit in the dark recesses of my cellar for a while and try one this winter."
"Yummy. Amber colored golden pour with a very nice frothy head. Deeper golden color than the 60 Minute. Smells a good balance of malt and hops, but for some reason, I get more malty nose than the hop. Having said that, you can still smell those hops, lots of hops. Taste great, complex, lots of different things going on in there. You can taste that high gravity fa sho... Mouthfeel is also complex, lots of hops flavors, citrus... tastie... drinkability gets an great, because you can sit and drink alone or share with a friend."
"Fantastic beer. Pours a bold, dark golden yellow with a light cream head. Dry, citrusy aroma. Taste is slightly bitter, dry, with strong citrus accents, especially grapefruits and Meyer lemons. Finish is powerful but clean. As double IPA's go, Dogfish Head 90 Minute is near the top. Although I personally prefer Stoudt's double IPA, 90 Minute is an excellent double."
"I have this a lot of times on tap but this is the first time I've bothered taking notes. Pours a bright orange/gold color. Not too much head, but a thin lace that staid there pretty much the entire time I drank it. Smells of piney american hops. A bit of citrus. Tasting it I first notice the sharp carbonation/hop bitterness combo. The finish is """sticky""" I guess. Sweet pale malt and piney hop oil taste. It's a little bready as well and there's some warming alcohol in there. It's disasterously drinkable on tap for some reason. I don't recommend sessioning it."
"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. The dark amber color bodes well for this ultra-hopped brew. The off white two finger head dissipated after a minute or two into a thin ring. Hops on the nose, spicy and enticing. Sweet port-wine like malty taste gives way to spicy, earthy hop bitterness. Its piney and citrusy at the same time. Hops give way to definite medicinal alcohol taste. After all, this brew is 9% ABV. I'd almost forgotten. It's well hidden by the massive amount of hops and malt."
"A friend of mine from NY brought me a four pack of this recently. Incredible brew. Poured coppery and clear straight out of the 12 oz bottle. Nice bubble head sat atop a delicious smelling beer. Aroma was hop-tastic, piney, with notes of citrus. Nice lacing of the glass as well. First sip was simply divine. A veritable hop explosion in my mouth. Robust, clean, hoppy beer. cannot believe that it is 9% ABV, because the hops and malt are balanced out so well. It had a crisp, clean, lip-smacking dryness to it. Delicious beer. Goes down smooth for something this robust. Can't wait to get home and have another."
"I LOVE this beer. This is a great go-to beer for me, and has been in my top 10 for a long time."
"The malts are pretty non-existent as far as I can tell, although there's a little malt and yeast in the finish, and therefore the taste and drinkability are directly correlated to your love of the raw hop. My love of the raw hop is strong, and it's because of beers like this one."
"This is probably the best IPA I've ever had the pleasure of consuming. Great aromas, unparalleled balance of tastes, and a good hop wallop make for some good drinking. I can't get enough of this beer."
"I've had this beer enough times with the same result to safely say that even considering the style, it's a more of heavy-handed approach to this type of beer. A pretty good beer, but doesn't stand up well next to the best in this style."
"A couple of these will do just fine! I like my beers with a flavor that will give me a little kick in the ass and this brew was happy to oblige."
"Drinks smooth as anything there is. Nothing overwhelming."
"D - As I said this is a great IIPA...but I prefer more hops...but on the other hand it is perfectly balanced...a solid brew from DFH"
"D - Pretty drinkable for and IPA in my book. The dryness isn't too intense at the end and is well balanced."
"J"
"I like hops and I like bitter. I guess that I like a better balance, though. Maybe the """60 minute""" will do it for me."
"D - A drinkable Imperial IPA, especially on cask, but it seems stronger and more intense, not the same beer as in the bottle at all. I hope to have it on cask again to compare, but a great experience that seems to expose how malty the beer really is. Just a bit over the top for everday drinking or to be social. I would probably have ordered only a half pint next time - strength and acidity are too much for my taste this way."
"I think this is a well-executed DIPA - one which nudges me back into the direction of giving other IPAs another chance to impress.  This is the yardstick by which I will measure."
"The beer itself is slightly thick and the carbonation gives it a prickly feeling in the mouth. Drinkability is average for the style."
"12 oz bottle date 3/27/09. Poured into a 22 oz. DFH snifter. A beer i've had before but has probably been a year since my last one. Good beer but not the taste i like in this style, too much caramely-malty dominance that mask the hops. That said its a good offering from the DFH brewery."
"Notes: I can appreciate this beer for what it is, and can definitely see why some people love it so dearly. Having said that, this just isn't my cup of tea when it comes to DIPA's. Is it because I live on the West Coast and am biased towards huge hop bombs? Probably. But that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate the fact that this is, obviously, a well-crafted beer. It's just too malty sweet to break into my upper eschalon of hoppy beers. If you like well-balanced, sweet DIPA's then this is your holy grail!"
"Pours to a nice copper color with a very fine head. The smell was that of a caramel covered raisin. The taste is a wonderful blend of citrus , hop, and that faint caramel flavor that gives this a mild sweetness I find I want more of. It is a soft blend that just balances each other perfectly. As far as drinkability one thing is for sure it won't take 90 minutes to drink and hopefully it won't take that long to find more."
"D - This is not a brew to be taken lightly, or pounded down with wreckless abandon. One or two at a time is plenty and should be enjoyed slowly!"
"d- sort of expensive, not an everyday beer, but i would buy it again"
"It's a big hop-bomb this one, almost to the point of insanity. It teeters oh so close to the edge of being irredeemable, but stays gloriously on our side of the realm."
"Between this and la fin du monde you can't go wrong, either way you'll end up with your taste buds spinning, and so will your head."
"All around fantastic beer."
"Very drinkable and enjoy it tremendously. I will buy more."
"D- Very drinkable, not an extremely high abv but the alcohol is hardly noticeable so it may sneak up on you. Overall a good Imp IPA but I wasn't too impressed, the brew smelled nice but the tasted just didn't back it up."
"Sure, this is 9.00% ABV but it'll go down so easily that it can hardly be felt. Just give this a shot and enjoy it - Dogfish Head is arguably the best East Coast Brewery at putting these kind of beers together and this proves why beyond the shadow of a doubt. Instead of overloading the senses, this puts the """craft""" into craft beer. While it's not the best I've ever had, it's up there and can more than hold it's own. All that's left for me to sample now are their other IPA's - this beer has made me thirst for those, it's that good!"
"D- decent drinkability, but again, too malty and sweet to be sessionable for long periods of time. i could have a few more of these tonight, but not a whole nights worth of drinking."
"The Dogfish Head 90 Minute DIPA is the work of brew artists; an absolutely delicious brew."
"At 9% I'm good for one of these at a time. Two, tops. But that doesn't mean I don't want more or that it isn't a pleasure to drink."
"First of all, compared to the 60 min, I think I enjoy the 60 min more. This was a orange color with lots of sticky lacing. Very sweet smell with citrus hops. Upon first sip I could tell this was a very sweet beer. Not too much hop backbone that I can taste but it does have a pretty bitter aftertaste. I really enjoyed this one but overall it was just a bit too sweet for me."
"This is a classic example of a DIPA, especially those coming out of the east. This beer is worth every ounce of respect it gets in the beer community."
"The taste is more like a strong maibach with little carbonation. Not the tastiest of beers but that is probably to be expected. After 4 years, this has become more or less, a malt-alcohol beverage. The absence of carbonation takes away whatever flavor is enjoyable. This is obviously at least a year beyond a very enjoyable experience."
"May I have another?"
"It is consistently enjoyable. That's huge. I think this beer is one of those to basically have around all the time. I give it extra credit for tasting virtually identical when tap versus bottle. I can have two and feel good. I can mix it with Guiness and have an awesome Black-n-Tan. The beer is both good and versatile. It's another winner from Dogfish Head."
"EDIT: Some of the most amazing lacing I have ever seen from a brew..."
"A serious IPA big in all respects. Full of character, style, richness and flavors and a wonderful whiskey finish."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Cheers..."
"Tried this on-tap - this is a delicious, delicious beer. Decanted into a pint glass. It's a rich copper color with a frothy white head. Fantastic lacing. Aromas and tastes are very well balanced. Rich maltiness, great citrusy hops. Rich mouthfeel - not too heavy, good complement to the flavors. A very drinkable beer. It's listed as a double IPA, but it comes off as a very, very drinkable IPA. I will gladly return to this one again and again."
"I am happy to see an increasing number of American beers at the better Alberta stores."
"All in all, not a bad brew. There are some problems with it, in my opinion. I feel like I'm trying to compare it to an IPA and not an IIPA--like it doesn't know which style to be in (big bold harsh flavors or more subdued ones). This one grows on me as I drink it. Similar sweetness makes me interested to see if I could tackle the 120 the second time around."
"The 9.0%ABV is so cleverly hidden that this one could be extremely dangerous, if you aren't careful. Very drinkable."
"remember in Jurassic park, when they show you the fossil insect in the tree amber... thats the color of this beer. Smells like raspberry, and black tea, with a deep rich hop scent. If they made this in a car freshener I would wear it around my neck. Taste is very complex. At first its just hops, playing solo. Then a balance of deep malt pushes through, and adds a harmony. Then, as if threatened, the hops re-emerge, and play a floral symphony on your tounge, highlighted by grapefruit, apricot and raspberry. You're left with a very nice dry ether finish after its all said and done. It has a very splendid mouthfeel, and its dangerously drinkable."
"Overall: Mouthfeel was very good, small bubbles of carbonation were strong and consistent. Fairly drinkable, I just wouldn't want much."
"D: 9%? I cry B.S... so well hidden. I drink one of these and don't want to get off of them for the rest of the evening."
"Salud!"
"Side note: Had this beer on tap in Ann Arbor, handpumped at almost room temp. Brought a whole complexity to the beer and made it basically liquid gold."
"D: Even with the strong flavor and slightly higher carbonation I still found this one easy to drink and very enjoyable. Granted I can start to feel the 9.0% ABV as I'm getting to the end of the glass (I sip and enjoy beer). I would and am going to highly recommend this one to my friends/customers."
"I had this beer a few weeks ago on tap at Stone, but didn't really know what to expect after having the Bear Republic Apex. This beer has much more malt texture than CA style IPA/Imperial IPA's. To put my taste preference aside, this beer pours great, a darker beer, more like an amber ale color. The smell is somewhat sweet, hoppy, almost floral. The smell reminds me of the Hairy Eye Ball from Lagunitas. Taste is hoppy, but balanced with caramel maltiness, definately has a big malt finish. The carbonation is light, but fits the style. Overall, this is a good Imperial IPA, but if you are looking for West Coast style IPA be warned, the malts are pretty heavy."
"The smell is redolent of hops, but not intensely concentrated. It is a sophisticated and unusual blend of fruit (citrus, persimmon, white grapes) and fresh cut flowers. It is sweet on the palate (all that barley?), a little wood, pine, grapefruit, and spirit show up as you move the beer around your mouth. Finish seems dry on the sides of your tongue, with a mild astringency, yet the sweetness persists as well (caramel, malt). Delicious. Medium bodied with modest but sufficient carbonation. Alcohol level is just right. Clean yet flavorful, maybe a little sweet for the style; not as hop-forward as I was expecting...still, a superior brew."
"Have been looking this beer over for awhile and finally broke down and bought a loosy to try. This is a very good DIPA and I am glad that I tried it. As far as other DIPA's go this is on par with the top tier ones. I would definately have this again but I would probably not choose this Imperial IPA first."
"Pours a deep amber with a quickly dissipating head that leaves lacing all down the glass. Smells of sticky, piny, citrusy, did I say sticky? Tastes very bitter, but there is a hint of booze. Mouthfeel is great with just enough body and drinkability is high."
"Pours a lovely amber color clear with swirls of orange swiming threw. The head forms easily and does not have to be forced. Head coloring is an off white and looks thick and full. Aroma is very refreshing as the hops citrus powers threw with a fruity and malty background. I feel that every sip is a powered by a different factor. Sometimes the malt is in the foreground and sometimes the Hops are powering threw. Which ever is first to the finish the flavor in secound balances lovely. This beers carbonation is perfect and is not heavy at all as you drink. Which can be a bit dangerous as it can sneak up on you. This beer has become a staple in my beer fridge."
"D: One of the most drinkable 9% beers I've ever had. Alcohol is not overly warm nor overly present, making this DIPA a """yeah I'll have another""" kind of treat."
"Very, very tasty."
"4.5 D: Super drinkable, probably more drinkable due to it not having an incredibly big hoppiness."
"Pours a beautiful translucent and dark amber/rustic color with a thin amount of head. Very bubbly, almost like a soda. Incredible bouquet of hops right off the pour. Scents of flowers, passion fruit and pine - amazing aroma throughout. Tastes like what an IPA should; very clean and dry. Good balance of malts and hops, though the hops are very prevalent. Coats the mouth pretty well and leaves a proper bitterness in the mouth. Easily drinkable - definitely a kick-back type of beer."
"There's a lot going on in this beer. It pours a pale-ish amber colour with a thick, sturdy head that lingers. The aroma is powerful and hits you like a train - hops, caramel, pine, grapefruit, and the same happens once it gets onto the tongue. Hoo boy, that's big ju-ju. Man, they've really thrown the kitchen sink at this one. Maybe it's just a little too busy. Somewhat oily mouthfeel - not unpleasant but not ideal for drinkability either."
"Alcohol on the nose when swirled."
"As far as drinkability goes, there is better tasting IPA's and are cheaper."
"D: Interesting--as usual from DFH. It's weird going backwards from 120 to this. Like Coke to Diet Coke. Very drinkable for a 9% beer. I'd go back to back if I had another one."
"I poured into a pint glass to a nice creamy head. It was orange/amber in color. I really enjoyed the caramel malt smell with a hint of pine. This beer has more balance than most in the category. I am very impressed. I am comparing this to the Torpedo I just had and this is a better offering, and I thought that the Torpedo was good. Nice, very nice."
"D- exceptional but the rich chewiness forces a half point deduction in that one slow effort would serve better than 2 or 3 pounded"
"Please know, it is not a bad brew. But when there are many other more impressive brews in the DIPA arena, and which come in a true 6-er, I'd look elsewhere."
"I'll get this down, but Dogfish Head still hasn't impressed me."
"D: This beer gets a little too candied & sweet for me. A few of these is way more than enough. I think that this would make a better IPA, except for the fact that the alcohol content wouldn't fit. All in all, I used to like this beer, but that was before I started getting my hands on much better Imperial/ Double IPA's. I've had it on tap, which is definitely better than the bottle, but even still; after the first third of the beer the caramel flavor becomes too predominant."
"D - This is a very nice Double IPA."
"D: I could drink 90 minutes all day. It's a fantastically tasty beer, incredibly well balanced and delicious."
"Glad I had the chance to try this, and will be going back for more, it would make an excellent session ale if it weren't for that amplified abv%."
"D: It's not bad, but not great. There's a plethora of better choices for the price."
"It's not that it's a bad beer, but we're just not right for eachother."
"D: For this style, this is definitely quite drinkable. Pretty good beer all around."
"D-Very drinkable like usual. I could easly put back a 4 pack of this with no problem. Nice go to beer. Way to go Dogfish!!!!"
"Drinkability: A Double IPA for Everyone - I know girls who drink 3 of these beers out at bars on friday night and think nothing of it. It's a beautiful beer with a wonderful, refreshing flavor. For guys / girls looking for the punch in the face Double IPA - this isn't that big punch - you're going to get a whole lot of flavor with this one - I paired it with a Granny Smith apple cobbler - simply delicious!"
"D- Extremely refreshing and easy-to-drink for a beer with such a high abv."
"I've had in this style. Super mouthfeel with a """just right""" amount of carbonation. Like I said, I prefer more of a hops punch to the face and a little less sweetness, but I can't downgrade this beer too much."
"This beer like many other DIPA's needs to be fresh and I know my review would be better if it were. Overall as always a solid beer."
"Drinkability: If this beaut weren't 9% ABV, I'd drink the entire case (if I'd had the forethought to buy an entire case). As it is, I may just have the last two from the four-pack and then dream on the next time I shall see the DFH logo on my next sojourn. Until that time comes, I will savor the new fruits and pine needles that I'm experiencing, and when I'm done, I will bid this beer """Adieu""" until the next time I see it! :)"
"Tasted like malty piney maple brown sugar with just the right hop bitterness that doesn't linger too long. Medium carbonation with a rich/oily feel. Easy to see why it's rated as good as it is. Deserves its high marks. I may have to pair this with a good medium-bodied cigar one of these days."
"D: A really fantastic DIPA. Not too big to turn you off after one and not too small to make it seem like you are drinking a standard IPA. The maltiness really made this one a winner for me. Don't get me wrong, the hops were great, but I like a balanced DIPA. This definitely hit that mark. I want to try it again, really fresh to get the full hop experience. I'll probably pick up another 4-pack to age a year to see the difference. This beer is a must have for any beer geek."
"Drinkability - Each drink anticipates the next, but definitly not a session beer. You enjoy this treasure one at a time, maybe two on a special occaision."
"D: For me, one is enough. It's good, but not something I would session with."
"D - Very drinkable for a beer of 9% ABV. It's not as hoppy as a lot of double IPAs, but it makes up for that with a lot of caramel and toasty malt flavors."
"dr. Despite the high ABV, this is a very smooth and easy drink. Way easy."
"I was surprised how easy it was to drink in lieu of the potent flavor! It's strangely quick, like it's rushing out of your mouth."
"D- I could easily polish off a 4-pack of bottles, but with 9%ABV that might lead to a headache later on. This beer is beautiful, it is really a treat to have found it. Very enjoyable and highly recommended."
"I was ready to be amazed by this beer and I'm so bummed I didn't like it. I found it light on hops (for a DIPA) and too heavy on alcohol."
"now i hear Pliny's are good.... ;)"
"Wow. I love this beer. This is the gold standard for IPA's in my opinion. Poured in a pint glass. Color is a nice copper tinged amber. Quickly disappearing head with great lacing. Smell hits hard with big, fruity hops and a rich, oily aroma. The taste starts like a good IPA - lots of tangy, bitter hops - but then it just escalates to a fruity, floral explosion of complex flavors. The finish leaves you with a sweetbread flavor gingerly sparring with slightly bitter fruity hops. Mouthfeel is a very pleasant medium body with subtle carbonation and little oiliness. Very, very smooth for a 9% ABV. Dangerously drinkable."
"D: As drinkable as any imperial IPA I've ever tasted. The balance makes it easy to forget what you're drinking and just enjoy sipping on the beer. Though the beer has heft, it's not heavy. The mouthfeel is, to me, the most outstanding quality in a fantastic beer. (5.0)"
"D: Not too bad. It will catch up with you eventually but until it does I'll keep drinking it."
"This beer is up on my tops for this style and I wil revisit it many times I am sure. It is definaltly in my top 3 for the style"
"D-A long time staple and solid go to DIPA. I can drink gallons of this stuff and never tire of it. I am always glad to come back and visit 90 minute when I know it is fresh!"
"D- Slow. This is a pretty heavy IPA so take your time."
"drinkability was enjoyable and could be a 2-3 session beer from the high alcohol content. really liked this one and was well worth the price for only a 4 pack"
""""serving type""" I note on-tap, though I've had this from bottle. You can take my review and notch it down 1 level for the bottle. This beer was head and shoulders better out of Keg. Rich aroma, rich mouthfeel, rich finish. Big hops but rounded and bold, slight bitter but balanced. Thats what made this beer great."
"M/D - Very sticky and sweet. Good mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. However, this one was too much like a barleywine to me. I was expecting something with more hop aroma/flavor and less sweetness. I wasn't crazy about it, but overall, this one is a solid beer that I will certainly buy again at some point."
"D - Somewhat drinkable, not my favorite IIPA. Borders on barleywine almost."
"D- this one just doenst do it for me. although it is one of the most balanced beers of this style. the alcohol is a little too in my face to consider drinking another one."
"D - Moderate for the style, probably not the ipa you would be looking to session but that's not what it was intended for. Certainly a great brew that is easily enjoyed."
"EDIT (11-11-2009): I've had this several more times since (at Petra in San Luis Obispo), and it's been damn good. I bumped the previous ratings up a bit."
"This beer is fantastic, much like the 120 min. i'm kicking my paradigms aside as we speak."
"The mouth feel is the best I have had in an Imperial IPA. Just the right balance lets this beer let you enjoy this beer without biting to hard back. Not heavy on the pallet and is nice and smooth. Some the thickest lacing I have seem on an IPA, Nice!"
"overall - I'm stunned. I was expecting this beer to jump up and smack me across the mouth with a hop grenade, but instead it wafted up to me and vigorously caressed my taste buds like a good shiatsu massage. Oh god, I think I'm turning into a hop head."
"D- Boozy, bitter and hoppy. Not for everyone. I think the boozyness could be less."
"Pours amber. Nose is an earthy, sappy, hop resin, with hint of watermelon and bubble gum; I did not detect floral or citrusy notes. Flavor introduces a sweet maltiness. More malty than a typical DIPA with perhaps not enough emphasis on the hops. Perhaps the hops used don't hit the floral and citrusy notes I like. A nice beer but I like a bigger taste for the price and ABV."
"Weighing in at 9% this is not a beer with which to trifle. However, I would like to drink myself silly on these."
"D - No where near the 120 level, but this guy's main problem in my eyes is that the 9% doesn't even try to hide. Its so up front and demanding it kind of takes away from all the other fantastic flavors going on. Low drinkability in my book."
"Smell of citrus and hops taste is excellent. Taste is very strong of a IPA. Mouthfeel will burn but has really good an Drinkability is scary as a lot can be had before ABV is realized."
"Overall: Pretty good drinkability. Some alcohol present, but that can be expected for 9% ABV. Much sweeter than most imperial IPAs in the flavor. Has an unfavorable after taste of extreme bitter and alcohol."
"This is definitely one of the best readily available DIPA's in the world"
"D: I still would pull for other DIPA's. However this thing still rocks and has to be tried. I feel some of the hop flavors are masked or not even present, I vouch for a handful or two more of hops"
"D: While each of the above elements was good, somehow at the end of the day, I never find myself wanting more than one of these, and often I'd prefer to split it with a friend. It's very enjoyable, but just not something to consume in quantity."
"The taste was where this really showed its merit. Highly hopped by unbelievably drinkable. A real treat! Not quite as complex as some others, but a very good, very smooth brew that permeates the taste buds with great bitterness and a strong aftertaste."
" I could have many without a doubt."
"It lived up to the hype and I am sold on the DFH line of beers."
"I always liked DFH 90, but never held it in the same class as some of the other bigger DIPAs out there. However, after having this beer served through Randall, it was really reminiscent of having one of those big time DIPAs on tap. Great stuff!"
"The pour is copper with a decent amount of head and good retention. The aroma is mainly hoppy and sweet like caramel or toffee. The taste was very sweet and mild with a great balance of hops and caramel. It had a sort of hoppy string ale taste. This is the kind of IPA I can really drink since IPAs are not a favorite style of mine."
"at first sight it looks great nice copper color .. good head.. smell is not overwheling hops.. malts.. taste is great.. nice hops flavoring..hints of malts and a smooth after taste.. i had 2 and i felt great going on 3 and i feel good for bed.. great brew.. cheers"
"Thick chewy mouthfeel with an oily lingering. This is a beer to remember and much better than the 60."
"Serving type: bottle"
"D) Wouldn't drink the entire 4 pack at once! Nice beer to share."
"Overall, a very good IPA, but I have had better. It reminds me a lot of Stone-IPA, but somewhat lighter in color and taste. Surprisingly even my wife enjoyed this beer and she is normally turned off by very hoppy IPAs"
"D - This is a very interesting beer. I'm sure it is a different experience fresh, but this is what I have access to on the West Coast. I found the 90 Minute to be a nice refreshing ale, but not as upfront in your face with hops like I expect from an IPA. The flavors are more subdued and the alcohol is ever present."
"One year old 90 minute stored in refrigerator. Poured a golden/amber, a tad cloudy, with a cream colored head that had some staying power. Aroma attacks the nose with a big fruitiness of orange, tangerine, and grapefruit. Also a touch of honey there. Overall, very inviting. Taste is a nice balance of honey, bready malt, and pink grapefruit, with a smooth finish. Hop presence is a bit less than expected possibly due to age. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and very smooth. Overall, this is a delicious beer, very refreshing, but a bit high in ABV to have several."
"This is very drinkable, though is has sort of a thicker feel, it doesn't seem to be as filling."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my shaker """pint""" glass. Appears a clear apricot color with about an inch of bone white foam. Smells of caramel malt, pine and grapefruit. Taste is of sweet caramel malts, grapefruit pith, pine, grassy and floral hops. Nice balance between malt and hops. Sweet, sticky, and bitter. Medium bodied / medium carbonation. Alcohol is well hidden. Super drinkable considering the high ABV."
"D=Drinkable but more than 4 might be a little much. Not super heavy or filling."
"Reminds me of a better version of SN Torpedo Extra IPA, but this is much more complex and balanced."
"The taste is incredibly smooth and balanced. The balance shines brilliantly from hops and malt with an offsetting sweetness that finishes with a good citrus kick. I don't get much alcohol on the finish, making this beer tremendously drinkable. The mouthfeel is medium to full and the offsetting sweetness is the only aspect that makes this the powerhouse that it is at 9%. For an IPA it is balanced beautifully with hops shining on a great solid oily/malty body. Love it"
"Really, really enjoyable."
"Way more balanced than I expected. Also, the hops are more bittering than many others who go with a grapefruity variety. Lots of sweetness, variety of hop flavors... this is a solid go-to IPA for many an occassion. Great with food, heck ya I'll have another!"
"I just had the 60 minute IPA and it was pretty good. So I found this 90 minute IPA and decided to buy the 4-pack for just over ten bucks. It has a golden orange hue with a thick dense white head. My nose picks up a huge presence of floral hops and maybe a sweet bready aroma as well. There's a thick, heavy, and syrupy sort of consistency but a great taste. It tastes like oily hops with much less pine and citrus than I usually associate imperial IPAs with. Quite bitter... As it should be and malty. There's a flavorful contrast of bitter and sweet going on. As I drink the beer down rings of foam are left behind. I think I feel some alcohol warmth in my throat now, also. Good beer... But I'm still trying to find one that will top Bell's Hopslam. I'll keep searching."
"Although I'll probably never be a serious hophound, I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. I'll buy it again -- a first for me, with a hops-forward brew. Good stuff!"
"D- Nice brew that is a fairly malty version of the style."
"Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a Sierra Nevada Pint glass. Beer pours a 2 finger foamy white head that disappears quickly. Nice carbonation and bubbles in this amber colored beer. Both smell and taste are dominated by the hops, very floral. However, unlike many other strong IPAs, this one does not have a bitter bite and is very smooth. Hard to believe the alcohol is this high. I'm not a huge IPA fan but I was very impressed by this one."
"Drinkability: For me this beer has some solid drinkability. The alcohol in it and the fact that the alcohol isn't as well hidden as in some higher alcohol beers make it hard to have multiple in a sitting. It does taste awesome though, making it one of my favorite beers."
"Very good double IPA."
"Drinkability: Yes please. Although this beer has a strong hop presense, it is not bitter, and does not bite. Very easy to drink."
"This is my first time having the infamous DFH 90 minute IPA. It pours a hazy amber with a finger width head. It smells very much of pine and citrus. On first sip the taste is identical to the smell, and very hoppy! It is a very good tasting beer! Mouthfeel is very smooth and goes down easily, I think I'm getting the hang of these higher ABVs. My only problem with the beer is the price. I feel like there are other cheaper IPAs that can do the same thing for me. But price out of the way, this is a solid tasty refreshing beer!"
"My favorite from DFH. Medium amber with a red tint. Lots of hops and citrus...smells refreshing. Hint with hops right off the bat but calms down afterwards with a very refreshing finish. A great double that I drink often...a must-have for IPA fans and a great beer from DFH."
"drinkability: really strong double and I would have it again, and again. DFH makes IPAs really well."
"D - Very intense flavors. Malty flavors really stick to your palate. Probably wouldn't have more than 2-3 in one sitting."
"D: considering the ABV, this beer is extremely drinkable...something that I could have every day"
"This beer is horribly inconsistent for me. I have had it in bottles several times and on tap at the brewery (the best experience with it), and the mouthfeel and taste are all over the place in my experience. At it's best it is a very well balanced and smooth east coast IPA, at worst it is forgettable and overly malty and juicy. I don't buy it anymore."
"D: I tell ya, if 60 Min and 90 Minute were the only IPA's I had ever tried, I would profess my love for this brewing style. These two beers have turned me around on a style that I typically do not enjoy. Very well balanced, and very much worth getting again."
"Verdict: Compared to most Double IPAs, 90 Minute has a lot more malt than usual, making it much more of a balanced proposition than most. While not my favorite Double IPA, 90 Minute is still very much a standout beer."
"D= Excellent, a great beer. complex and world class"
"Individual elements are reminiscent of the big picture, which is that this is a truly wonderful brew."
"This beer is so smooth and delightful. It soon became one of my favorite beers once I had it on tap. I had had it in bottles a few times, but on tap the chocolate/coffee tones were more subtle and the flower notes were accentuated. I fell in love all over again. The high alcohol content makes it unnecessary to have too many, but to slowly savor each sip."
"I highly recommend picking up one, or several if possible."
"Tons of character, so much to explore, I think I'll explore another. This stuff is great, if not for the high abv, it's a go to all night."
"Overall the best way to describe this beer is perfectly balanced because that is exactly what it is. Not too hoppy and not too malty, just perfect but not in a mild way either. A perfect blend of extremes that gives this beer a deep, enjoyable, complex flavor. I highly recommend it."
"D - Goes down like water. Could have a bunch and be happy."
"This is a big and creamy IPA with moderate carbonation that keeps it lively. A nice building but somewhat one-sided hops flavor and good maltyness that quickly fades back into hops bitters. Great beer, it's very boozy all the way through, as the hops not as present as I expected. This is as good one to have on hand but not sure it would be my go-to ."
"All of these traits combine to form a hugely drinkable imperial IPA. I almost forgot what great beers Caligione is making out there. Excellent beer, and one that I will be visiting more frequently."
"Pours a clear, dark golden color. 1/2 inch head of a off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of hops, sweet brown sugar, earthy malt, and even some hints of chocolate. Fits the style of an American Double/Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly chewy with an average carbonation level. Tastes of smooth hops up front, then earthy malt, some slight alcohol throughout, hints of raisin, and the finish is again hops. A slight dryness associated , but not too noticeable. Overall, wow a smooth, strong, complex, amazing flavored beer."
"The drinkability is pretty good for 9 percent. It is smooth, and easy to throw back."
"This was my first of the 60/90/120 series, and I found it to be a very tasty drinkable IIPA. Crystal clear light amber in color with a consistent 1 inch white head. Prominent fruity hop aromas with subtle malt thrown in. Fruity citrus hop bitterness that was very smooth and consistent. Hard to notice that this was 9% ABV, very drinkable with a slightly thick consistency. Low carbonation and a bitterness that catches you in the back of the throat. Very good indeed."
"It's a good series. Drink up!"
"Sorry, but this is just not an A beer."
"All across the board this beer delivers.Nice hazy honey color with excellent retention and lots of lacing. Nice citrusy smell, spices, huge hops as you would expect from a DIPA. Surprisingly malty flavor, the hops are potent but not overwhelming and the complexity of the citrus and spices makes for a great taste that you can keep drinking all night, as long as the ABV doesn't get to you. Medium body, full and round, dry hoppy finish, a pleasure to drink."
"D = Not incredibly drinkable with the pervasive alcohol."
"Pours deep amber color with great big off-white head. Very nice looking beer. Smell - a bit yeasty, hoppy, interesting, not a regular DIPA aroma. Taste - WOW - this is ubelievable. It is definately not a hop bomb, it is closer to american barley wine. Still hoppy though, yeasty, a bit of warming alcohol is coming through. bitter finish. Balanced, very creamy, sticky and almost chewy. Full bodied. Dangerously drinkable. amasing stuff. Very different."
"T: If I make it sound like all the elements of this beer are fighting each other for supremacy, it's because they are. But it's really amazing how it manages to maintain equilibrium. For a beer so loaded with malt, hops, and alcohol to not have one element completely dominate while remaining so dangerously quaffable is nothing short of astounding."
"A superb beer, one of many fantastic IPA's I had when I visited NYC, many of which were in the fantastic Rattle N Hum"
"Drinkability is wonderful. After a few trips in sub 15 degree weather to the kegerator (yes I know to cold) barely able to wait for the pitcher to warm..."
"An example for how the rest should be done. Poured into a pint glass, reddish/amber color with a light head. Strong smell of hops. Taste bitter hops with fruity undertones, Apricot? The high alcohol had a warming effect but was never harsh, like drinking a fine wine. Finish was perfectly bitter yet balanced, never wanted it to go away. Great beer, lives up to the hype. I'll be keeping a few of these ready to go at all times."
"Overall: Not as impressed as I'd hoped, but I'd definitely drink a shit ton of these again. The hoppy bitterness is really pleasing and the flavor it leaves behind is quite enjoyable. At 9% ABV, I think this is a good session beer if enjoyed 12 ounces at a time."
"I had this beer once before and it was definitely not what I was expecting for DIPA. The color is a ruby brown with a slight white head and minimal lacing. Smell isn't very DIPA either. Complex carmel malt a slight hop note and alcohol. Taste blurs the line between barleywine and DIPA. A little too much alcohol burn. Too malty for a DIPA and not enough """umph""" for a barleywine. Mouthfeel is creamy and enjoyable. Drinkability would be higher if there wasn't a persistent alcohol burn."
"As the beer warms the alcohol becomes more present, both in the nose and on the palate. A nice medium mouthfeel. Overall, my review might be slightly biased, as no Dog Fish beer has ever totally wowed me and the alcohol is a bit too up front for my tastes. With that said, the beer isn't bad at all."
"D: Great choice for an IPA. Big hops, enough malt to give it some body and bittering hops to balance."
"This isn't my favorite Double IPA out there, but it's a really good version. It's my favorite of DogFish Heads 60-120 minute series. The 60 is a little boring, the 120 is like drinking port, this one hits the spot."
"This beer has it all - great apperance, smell taste, finish and drinkability plus the high abv that true quaffers crave. The first taste is quite hoppy, buy after that the smoothness sets in. Although it says it is a 9% abv, it tastes more like the 6% - 7% range. The only gripe I have about this beer is the high cost, but if you drink for quality over quantity, this brew is for you."
"D: Very drinkable, alcohol picked up is minimal, great flavor, goes down pretty easy"
"Two thumbs up for this one!!!"
"Would definitely get again, might be a good beer for this summer BBQing in the Ocean State. Don't have the 60 or 120 Min IPAs handy for comparison, but it is exponentially more palatable for me than the 120, but I think the 60 may stand as my favorite."
"HV"
"Nice long hop finish. If you are looking for hops you won't be let down. Balanced for the style. Not a session beer by any means."
"Drinkability- Exceptionally smooth and drinkable especially for a high ABV beer."
"I have to say that I am a little disappointed with this. After waiting two years to have this again, I had higher expectations. Don't get me wrong this is still an outstanding beer!"
"Overall a great IPA that i could see my drinking often, only if i could get it here."
"drinkablity 4.5"
"This one should please most IPA fans. Someday I'd like to try this on tap, or maybe another bottle just to compare with the one I had. I'm not sure how long it may have been on the shelves and I know IPAs are best consumed as fresh as possible."
"pours a hazy light orange color with 1/2 """ head and decent lacing thru-out... smell is hoppy first then grapefruit and malt thereafter its smells very good,..not great... The taste is the same it is hops first then the citrus and pines and malt i do detect more alcohol taste in this DIPA.. mouthfeel is pretty smooth and very drinkable it is another great DIPA..not my favorite but still very good and will buy again. this DIPA is a very strong oily hop flavor brew primary ....secondary is citrus and malt sweetness.. its a b plus for sure.. another good DFH offering.. try it"
"D- This is a very heavy brew. A well balanced meal in a glass."
"D: A great beer overall. My first from Dogfish Head, which I've heard a lot about. I'm not sure how to rate it relatively qua an imperial IPA. I usually expect them to be bitter, a la RR's Pliny the Elder and Younger. This one, though, is predominated by a slightly cloying sweetness. Probably would want only one in a sitting, but I will definitely enjoy the other three of these I have."
"D - I would definitely drink this again. It is hands down, the best IIPA I have ever had....and yes, I've had Hopslam."
"Clear amber body with bright white head. I didn't get much lace on the glass, and the carbonation seemed a little low. But the overall flavor was strong with lots of hops in the nose and a full citrus/piney flavor that I enjoyed. The mouthfeel was just about average but the rest of the beer stood up nicely. Malts seemed to take a back seat to the hops."
"D - 4.5 - This is an excellent Imperial IPA! Very drinkable, tops on my list if I am craving this style, a very sessionable Imperial IPA, but you have to look out for the 9.0% ABV! I marked this down a half of point in """drinkability""" considering the price is steep at $7 for a pint!"
"D: I'm pretty tired after drinking this beer. I don't know if it was the ABV and lack of a healthy food intake today, or if I'm just plain old tired after a long day! Either way, this is a great beer. More complex than I could even begin to discuss. I hope to continue opening up my palate to IPAs!"
"Somewhat light head, doesn't quite get past one finger but holds on credibly and surrounded by attractive lacing. Vividly dark orange color with a soft brown tinge, pumpkin-like in an autumnal way, very good clarity. Hits you with a double-barrel blast of sweet pink grapefruit in the nose, followed by honey dappled scone, white pepper, granola, green tea notes, the florality a bit overmatched here, excellent staying power, amplified as it warms some. Full-bodied without getting fat or overly dense, pushes the palate to find the sweet spot where it can impress and still flow forward. There's a certain fluffiness to the carbonation, not crisp nor foamy. Sweet and juicy pink grapefruit, tangelo citrus dominates here too, the malts polish the palate while adding some cocoa powder and carob flavors. Pine resin, honey and near barley accents come next. The hops beyond the citrus not adding much flavor, just a textural drying effect through and past the mid-palate. Still, more floral here, particularly as residue. Seems relentless in its desire to please."
"The first thing I pick up is the bread-like malt, but this quickly gives way to a rush of hops. The hops definitely pack both a citrus and piney flavor and balances well together. There are also some nice spices and a touch of warming alcohol. The finish is dry and slightly bitter but much more restrained than west coast hop bombs."
"Drinkability - This goes down way to easy for having an ABV of 9%...which would explain how a 4 pack can disappear in one sitting."
"Excellent IIPA, superbly balanced."
"Notes: While it came in last place it was still a fantastic beer, seems to me though it would go better as an everyday DIPA, if there could be one."
"D- An excellent IPA, but I still prefer Stone's IPA over any especially because a 6-pack of Stone IPA is $10.99 where as you only get a 4-pack of 90 minute for $9.99."
"This is by far one of the best beers I have ever had. It definitely goes on my list of """If I could only have one beer for the rest of my life.""" The smell is amazing and you can really pick out some of the ingredients. The taste is even better than the smell. It is definitely a hoppy beer and it is awesome. I thought the 60 minute was good, but this is way better. I """import""" this beer from out of state by the case, if that tells you anything."
"Drinkability is high because it it a pretty good beer and it won't destroy your senses."
"Cheers!!"
"I'll drink the rest of the four pack, but I reckon from this point on, I'll just stick with the 60 minute."
"The tastes is great, but not excellent. I had this IPA about a year ago in Texas, and thought the world of it. After having a small sampling of truly exceptional IPAs and re-sampling this one, I have re-assessed my opinion of this beer. There is a certain sweetness to this beer which I find unappealing. I also lacks the proper bitterness that makes for a wonderful IPA. Still darn good though."
"D - A great IPA, not a hop bomb, but something that I would rotate into my selection, if DFH was distributed down here"
"D: Now I'm not really a IPA guy, and this is my first Imperial IPA... Boy this will not your socks off.... If you like your hops hoppy and complex this is great. Personally, It's not my cup of tea.... I'm hoping I'll grow into the IPA.."
"Drinkability: I could drink more than one of these even though it no longer has that hoppy DIPA bitterness that was there when was freshly bottled. The changes over time have created a different beer that I like about as much in its own way as I like it fresh. In some ways it is now a bit more like a Barleywine but clearly different from that style.  One of the strengths of this beer is that after the bitterness of the hops has faded with age it is still a wonderful beer.  If you like sweet Sherry or English style Barleywines you might consider aging some of this for 6-9 mos. before drinking.  While its not exactly like either, it bears some resemblances to both."
"This probably has the best of any mouthfeel I know of for an IPA just great."
"After having two bottles of both over two nights, I feel that the 60 Minute is a vastly superior beer to the 90. At first, I thought I got a couple of bad bottles, but both were pretty much the same and are pretty fresh."
"Served in a pint glass. Clear amber/copper clear with a creamy off white head. I expected a nice floral hoppy nose and it delivers. Pretty simple taste when it first enters your mouth, but it has a very nice long finish. It fills your mouth with the aroma of hops. Great taste of hops and not as bitter as I thought it would be.This beer has great body and feels the way an IPA should imo."
"Poured a dark orange transparent brew, with a minimal head and light carbination. For smell I got an good delightful smell of hops. For taste I got an nice malty flavor that helped equal out the nice hit of bitter. The alcohol is covered up really well. The aftertaste has a bit of lingering bitterness but. Mouthfeel is great not too water but not too thick. Overall a great beer that I will look forward to trying again and help me explore more into IPAs."
"overall-- I dont care if you like IPAs. I dont care if you hate them (as i once did), you MUST try this beer at least once. It's a masterpiece of brewing. beautifully balanced."
"Awesome IPA! One of my favorites."
"Drinkability: I will have this again, but may be one of the few that prefer the 60 minute IPA. This is a smooth beer for an IPA..High ABV would prevent me from having more than a couple."
"D- Very drinkable. This is a beer that I could sit down and have several of. It was good but it wasn't great and certainly does not warrant the price tag attached to the six packs I've seen in the stores."
"I feel like a waffle - I used to love 60", then I hit upon 90""" and now I prefer 75""". Small wonder that I am not married."
"There's a lot of Dogfish-hatred on the forums, and although I respect them for their innovation, I can understand the general dissent about their brews. Nothing spectacular."
"This brew poured to a light amber/orange color with a smallish light tan head that had very limited retention. The aroma is hops but sweet malt is there as well. A very inviting mix of hop aroma with both floral and citrus coming through, though the floral seems to be more prevalent. The flavor is nice, malt is there though it does fade to a more hop / slight alcohol flavor. Could this be an old bottle, as I was expecting a larger hop hit? I did not see a date on the bottle so I am not sure. As the brew warms the alcohol seems to come out more but feels a little too hot for me. This is a good brew but for me it does not live up to the hype, the aroma was the best aspect IMO. I will try this one again just to make sure I did not get a slightly off brew."
"Pours a little darker than gold without a huge head presence. Gives off a strong citrusy and piney aroma that wakes up the taste buds. The taste is deep and complex with a woody or burnt flavor that mixes with the hops and lingers for a long time. The hop flavor is altered as it seems to bring a good dose of bitterness, but not like I've ever head before. The label boasts of a long boil that had me ready for a big hop flavor. Instead I was more impressed by a more unique flavor."
"Overall: This DIPA is one of my favorites and I love to drink it every chance I get. I actually judge others using this as a benchmark of excellence. Thanks DFH for a job well done!"
"D- This beer surprised me. It really isn't a IIPA to me. Given the 9% and lack of huge hop presence, this isn't overly drinkable."
"Drinkability: Your eminence, you have my undivided attention!"
"Overall Impression: Classic balance between the high hoppiness and malt back bone. It is a very drinkable a beer and a joy to drink."
"D - very drinkable, not much more i can say. theres no other way you could possibly know this was a 9% abv without seeing the label."
"Having lived in California before moving to Texas I thought I knew my IPAs (especially fond of Lagunitas and Stone Brewing) but this one left a very favourable impression. A lot of flavour and complexity, though a bit more bitter than most IPA's, but highly recommended. Not to be made a session beer of though."
"Pours a medium amber with a golden tinge. Leaves a large bubble head that takes a few minutes to dissipate, but leaves good lacing. Smells mostly of hops, as I would expect. What I didn't expect was on tasting, The first thing I notice is not hops, but I heavy malt flavor. Not bad, just unexpected. The hops do kick in though. The balance is actually pretty good. As I drank it, it just got better annd better. The malt, while overwhelming at first, is balanced by the hops perfectly. This is truly a great beer, and when I can get it, it will become my staple IIPA."
" This is a very good beer, but the malt overpowers the hops. I will definitely have it again, but it is not my favorite IPA."
"D - It's a bit pricey to be an every day brew, $3 a single. If you like your hops hoppy and complex this is great. Personally, I'm gonna back off of it for a little while until I'm a little more knowledgable about what all is going on in this beer, there is a LOT."
"One of the better IIPA's out there, look forward to comparing it to some others out there."
"D - I have tried this beer at least 10 times over the years always wondering where the hops are that everyone taks about and I still find a malt dominate, sweet ipa. Guess I will have to find it extremely fresh and give it another try."
"If it wasn't for the abv, the drinkablity would be enormous. And honestly, at $2.59 for a 12 ozer (or $9.99 for a four-pack) the price isn't really all that much of an issue. The problem is, with a beer of this stature, you can't go around drinking it every day. One of these suckers every couple of weeks is good enough to remind just how fantastic beer should and can be."
"Very drinkable. Well-balanced. The sweetness or bitterness never wears old, even after a couple. Definitely a must try for any IPA lover. I can see the comparisons between this and the Ruination IPA, however I feel they're both similar and different in their own ways."
"W-O-W. I love this stuff. Dark amber body under an off white head with nice lacing. Smell suggests a good deal of caramelized malts, candy sweetness, raisin. Wow. Beautiful balance of sweet malts and bitter hops, a touch of stout style charcoal at the end with bitter chocolate. As a man who enjoys stouts, this came as a surprise, Wow this is good. Palate is soft and medium. If I bring more of this home, my wife will be jealous. :)"
"D: For the style it was pretty good. More carbonation would have eased it on down a little easier."
"Consumed at Mr. Goodbar on 1/11/09"
"One of my all time favorite beers because of the incredible balance and easy drinkability."
"Overall a very nice malt driven DIPA."
"This beer pours a dark amber/copperish color with a thick and frothy white head that clings to the glass leaving spider webs of lace behind as it slowly dissipates. Nose is strong fresh pine and with lots of floral hops. It leaves no doubt that you're in for a great brew. Taste is hops all the way, however is blended very well with slight malts to balance out the beer. I thought the alcohol was decently hidden by the burst of hops - but that's just me. Medium to full-bodied with a slick mouthfeel. This is a great beer and can't believe it took me this long to try!"
"D - A pretty solid drinker. I could have a few in a sitting."
"this and stone IPA are the best IPA's i've had to date."
" A must for any hophead--Get some!!!"
"This is a nice step up from the 60 minute, which I gave a B+. More complexity, more hops, and a nice malt character for an IPA. It's not the first beer I will go back for when I am on a hop hunt, that will remain Stone, SN, etc, but a very nice variation on the Double IPA."
"d - Usually I review high ABV beers a little lower than other because they can not be drank all night, this is an exception. Of course the style calls for high ABV so I can't fault it for that but really I'm giving this a 5 because its so tasty."
"poured into snifter. thin off white head that was less than half inch in thickness that fades quickly. Smell of grapefruits, a little molasses, and a little malt character emerges as it is swirled. When swirled in snifter a thin head reappears but diminishes quickly like when it is first poured. Cloudy body that was a beautiful copper in color. Taste of mild hops and underlying malty character. Grapefruit, orange notes are present along with malts as it finishes over your palate. The longer it sits out and gets room temperature, the more present the malt character becomes. Overall an amazingly balanced IPA that can be enjoyed by everyone, hop heads and non hop heads alike. I would recommend this top notch IPA to anyone."
"D: about as good as it gets for a DIPA at 9%, I'm not sure if I can tell a major difference with the continuous hop method though...."
"Pours a clear amber color with white heading and yellow highlights. Smell is immediate citrus off the bat with other light fruit's. Most likely an orange.Very dry hopped with I believe call me a crazy a touch of sea salt. Hops are almost too overpowering on the brink of being a little much. For a 9% ABV it is not too much at all so high drinkability, but not too much to get out of hand."
"Notes: one of my favorite IPAs. i love DFHs style, with the 120 being my alltime favorite beer"
"D: 9% ABV here we be, great hops, great maits, nice."
"Overall, this is a very good beer. I was drinking this well before I knew the rankings and kept going back for me. I could enjoy this anytime of the year and feel it is worthy. However, if you're looking for unadulterated hops, this is not the best IPA for you."
"Bottled 9/22/2008."
"D - The only thing keeping me from giving this a 5.0 is the ABV. I'm not much of a hophead, and I always assumed this was just a more intense version of the DFH 60 Minute. But instead of another jacked-up hop bomb, I found an amazingly balanced beer that suits my tastes perfectly. I could kick myself for waiting so long to try it. This will be a mainstay in my beer fridge from now on."
"D: Not bad, but not one of the better DIPAs. A good beer, but a little lacking, almost too sweet and malty for me, not that all DIPA's should be flaming hop bombs, but a little more hop characteristic would be nice. Not a bad beer, but I am a little let down."
"Drinkability: Good, but doesn't hold a candle to Yulesmith"
"D-It has a dry feeling leaving you wanting more which makes it very drinkable but I think 1 or 2 is enough for one night."
"Future outlook: No reason to believe that I won't be getting this again at some point in the future."
"I'd love to try their 120 hour. Maybe I don't deserve it after that review."
"Taste at first seemed to be too strong with the alcohol, but after taking a few drinks I am getting a little biscuit and fruit and of course the hop. Has a nice chewy mouthfeel, not too carbonated like some of the other Dogfish Head I have had lately. Drinkability is not bad although I am not getting as much flavor as I thought I would past the alcohol. Gets better the more I drink though."
"Poured tis brew into my snifter. Poured a golden orange body with a off white head. Leaves decent lacing at first but not for the whole glass. Has a nice hop aroma to it, with hints of citrus and malt hiding behind the hops. As for the taste, has a slightly bitter one that has a dominate taste of hops with a little malt and citrus. Seems to be under carbonated. Has a great mouthfeel and drinkability to it. Im definitely going to have to pick up some more to test the carbonation level."
"Drinkability: What can I say? For my first DFH beer I was very pleased. I've walked by DFH brews so much at the local package store and I'm glad I didn't this time. At 9.00 ABV, this is a perfectly balanced beer thats not overbearing, yet packs a huge flavor of hoppiness and fruit elements. An excellent job from DFH and I look forward to trying more brews from these guys."
"Pours a pale straw yellow color with a bit of copper in it. A fluffy white head appears early, then kind of fades, leaving just a bit of bubbles on top. You also get a bit of lacing. The smell is a bit earthy and sweet. You can get the hop smell from the start, it leans towards piney, herbal, with a bit of citrus. But there is a distinct malty smell that is different from most DIPAs, interesting. The taste is enjoyable. I had it once and thought it was too sweet, but I had already been drinking other sweet things, maybe a problem, this one is distinctly hoppy, there's a bit of bitterness with some floral tastes. Then you get a bit of the nutty or biscuity maltiness, something a bit different, which is pleasant in the style, and there is sweetness of course, but it doesn't kill the hops. The alcohol is also well-masked. The mouthfeel is good, there's quite a bit of complexity, this isn't one-dimensional. But it's ultimately a little too syrupy for a DIPA in my opinion. I am a fan of a bit more dryness in this style. I figure that it could be appreciated by almost any age of beer drinker. I enjoyed having it, and would probably buy it again in the future, though I wouldn't want to drink a bunch of them at one time. Of course it will catch you at 9%, but I'm not turned off by it."
"Smells like hops, hops, and more hops with a touch of sweet caramel maltiness. Taste like the nectar of the beer gods. Extremely balanced. Nice sweet maltiness followed by the hoppy goodness. Carbonation is perfect nice bubbles on the back of tongue. I could drink this all night long if my liver could handle it. With such a high abv you sure can't tell it."
"I love this beer, i don't know if it stands with the CA unbalanced DIPAs that i am used too but it is really drinkable and enjoyable, their is no other DIPA like this, its great.."
"I had this one out of the bottle, bought in a four pack at a grocery store. I had no complaints. Bitter and very strong, a four pack is perfect, especially during the winter months."
"drinkability cannot be very high because of the high alcohol content and the presence of it after a while (drank one bottle in about 30 minutes on an empty stomach and was nicely buzzed), but an excellentexcellent brew."
"D: because of its hoppiness and high alcohol content this is not the kind of beer you can drink fast. Its a more a """savor the flavor""" kind of beer."
"This beer is outstaing as far as taste. Pours a deep copper producing a pillowy white head that laces the glass and sticks to the mouth. Smells like a hop explosion in my nose. Citrus is very evident. Blew up in my mouth with citrus hops and malt. yummy. Alochol sweeps in the backround with malts, but very well balanced. Drinkability is quite low due to the high alcohol content. I love this beer though."
"Overall: Good sipping beer. Can't say that I'll buy more of this stuff after I finish this four-pack, though."
"The hops took the background - even though there was some really tasty bitterness - very east coast styled IPA, a nice balance of hops and malt. It reminded me of an English IPA with way more character and kick. Finishes almost with a coffee bitterness. Super solid beer, but totally unique amount imperial IPAs. A wonderful beer, but I prefer west coast styled beers like Pliny as far as double IPAs go."
"Beer for the Imperial Court of the Krimson King! Poured with and nice head and clear pale amber color. Good lace. Aroma is hoppy and malty; not too fruity. Earthy. Flavor is outta this world tasty. GFD! Lots of clean, chewy, earthy, zesty, robust HOPS mofo! And the malt to make it all work. Excellent body. Carbonation is spot on. Finish is satisfying and in spite of the power, enticing enough to want another. My god, this is beer!"
"This great beer is dangerously drinkable. At 9% it will sneak up on you and kick you in the head from behind."
"6/4/5/3/12 (3.0/5)"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability are outstanding as rated by this individual. Coats the tongue with an oily texture. Goes down very smooth...as an excellent IPA shoud. I can compare this brew to Southern Tier's Matt and Phin's but a bit better. This being said, I was a tad disappointed with this brew compared to the 120. If you can get a single bottle of the 90 minute for under 4.50...go ahead and give it a shot...otherwise, save your money and try a 120"
"I've heard rumors that this beer is hard to find in the great beer city of San Francisco and I feel sorry for those people. I live about 6 hours north of SF and never have any trouble finding this delightful brew. Maybe he's not looking in the right places... I recently introduced a beer neophyte friend to this beer and he immediately fell in love as well, a testament to how surprisingly easy drinking it is for a 9% brew. Heavily hopped and tasty as all hell."
"Would drink it again."
"The flavor is outstanding with its fruity, earthy, citrusy notes. The combination of hops used in the beer is perfect for every hop lover. Also it's very sweet with the malts. You get a mouth full of hops and malted barley that is perfect for the palate. At 9% abv you can have just 1 or 2 and you'll be fellin' good."
"Cheers"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. A hard pour produced a good head which dissipated rather quickly. I let this beer sit at room temp for a while. Aroma was nice with hops taking the fore but sweet malt showing its presence. Tasting brought to mind grapefruit, maple syrup, and caramel. Hop backbone was strong enough to balance out the malt and aroma was reminiscent of pine needles. This IIPA is rare in that I can drink a couple without feeling like my tastebuds went 12 rounds with Ali."
"D - Excellent beer all around. Almost too smooth given the 9% abv content...A fine beer!"
"EDIT 12/25/2008: I had another one today, and it was an entirely different taste than the 90 minute I based my review on. It was a much more balanced IPA, with a LOT more malt sweetness coming through. That being said, it doesn't really change my scores, because I liked this taste just as much."
"Poured an amber orange color. THe first thing I noticed was the unmistakable piney hops smell. I am not a big IPA guy but this was very smooth with a definite hop profile. The mouthfeel to me was oily with a lingering taste that changed peppery. I wouldn't want more than one of these at a time which is probably a good thing with the 9% abv."
"Drinkability - This hides it's relatively high alcohol content pretty well so I recommend you be careful here."
"Drinkability: AGAIN I will us the word SMOOTH! It is a hard beer to judge and until you know how you will react do not drink more than two. If your driving, never drink more than two! hehe"
"Highly Recommended"
"Overall impression: I would say this is one of the more well-balanced Imperial IPAs out there. At 9% abv, you want to sip it, but the alcohol only really makes itself very apparent in the finish."
"The 9%abv is extremely well hidden. Very tasty. Would be easy to overdo this one. A true gem. Worthy of the hype (unlike big brother 120, in my opinion)"
"Nice carbonation and lingering head makes for a very impressive drinking beer. The 9% ABV is not overwhelming and could easily pass off for a beer in the 7% range. I would easily recommend this beer for anyone wishing to experience a great example of an IPA."
"I still like my West Coast IPA's a bit more but this is a very nice beer. I would encourage anyone to try it . :)"
"i remember having this beer when i first started drinking craft beers about 2 years ago. at the time, i wasn't into very hoppy beers so i didnt care for it. Now two years latter i am trying it again no being a full blown """hophead.""" It is a very tasty beer with a high alcohol content; i wouldn't drink too many in one sitting. I have to say though for the price for a bottle, i think there are comparable alternatives. However, this is a very enjoyable beer and certainly worth drinking. I guess i'm ready to try the 120."
"D: A big hoppy treat balanced nicely against a huge sweet malty grain bill makes this a great drinking ipa with the abv% covered up rather nicely."
"Drinkability: This beer tastes, looks and smells delicious. The danger is that its so high in ABV and its hidden so well that have a few of these can really catch up. I had 2 at the office tonight and it was enough to give me a serious buzz. This is a beer everyone needs to try so they can have a benchmark for what american double IPAs should taste like."
"D: I'm not a hophead and I don't really seek out IPAs. I wouldn't buy this again (bottled) due to the price, but if I saw it on tap I'd make it a point to order it."
"D: If not for the strength, I could drink this one all day long!"
"Overall: So far this is one of the best IPA that I have tried. It has a complex character, but is seems so simple. It has a powdery astringent mouth feel. There is a nice lasting finish that is pleasant. It is a very easy beer to sip."
"I would say this is the best imperial IPA I've had. Heavy orange pour with an off white head. Nice aromas and flavors. Piney hops, citrus, sweet malt, slight red fruit. Leaves you with a little bitter bear face, in a good way of coarse. Not just a beer they tried to make as bitter and with as high an alcohol content as they could. Excellent."
"Great beer to kick back and relax with."
"Thanks to my new friend Glenn for a sample especially since this is not yet available in SC. Maybe next year. I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. Pours a crystal clear copper color with a nice foamy head. The smell is like a fresh piney Christmas tree with some spice. At 9% ABV this beer is suprisingly drinkable and left me longing for another one. If you love hops, you will love this beer."
"Drinkability: Pretty much the standard by which all other IPAs are measured in my book. Excellent, flavorful hops without being too bitter, mixed in with a good amount of sweetness and fullness balance the beer very well. A very good beer to enjoy slowly and in moderation, however, as the fullness, hoppiness, and ABV make it hard to drink too many in one sitting."
"Drinkability: This is one of the few beers that I think tastes better when its colder. I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as it warmed as it started to seem like a little too much. However, how can I not want to drink such a delicious beer? One or two of these and I'm set."
"There are """standards""" in beer in my mind for certain styles of beer. This IPA has to be the standard for IPA's. When you start drinking it... you will immediately realize it's not """socializing""" beer (aka party beer). It's """sit and relax""" kind of beer. One to take your time and enjoy. The taste jumps off the page, hitting with early with a rich of hops and finishing smooth with a malty finish. It hides it's high alcohol content well. The mouth feel is silky smooth and, yet, robust. As far as I'm concern, this may be the best beer on the market."
"(rated Feb 5, 2008)"
"One finger off white head on an amber copper body. Lacing left from the head is seawater sponge. Smell of a dark malt with woody hops. Taste is sweet, super well balanced for an IIPA, not overly hoppy on my palette at all. Though I can remember a time when this one tasted hoppy to me. Other note would be this has been in my fridge for months, at least 6. Only slightly bitter on the back end, and sweet up front. This one is well crafted and balanced, tasty."
"Just way too much going on for me to find this refreshing and want another. This is an odd brew indeed. I love the 60 minute, but this is on a totally different planet from that."
"Have had on tap as well, was a little more fruity and mellow - enjoyed it highly."
"Overall a great Imperial IPA, the great balance between the malts and the hops make it enjoyable for all, even if your not a """hop-head"""."
"Beautiful golden honey color with a thin head that laces all they way down the glass. Nicely effervescent with a clean citrusy taste at first. Then hoppiness kicks in. Nice flavor from the hops, you can almost taste the actual oils there are so many hops in this thing. Coated the whole mouth with its flavor and aroma. finished strong finally letting its alcohol content show. A fantastic beer."
"Best aroma I've ever smelled in a beer, period. Strong grapefruit, pineapple aroma. Average IPA palate and appearance. Flavor is hoppy, obviously. If you love hops, you'll love this beer, but there's more there. The beauty to this beer is the super complex taste under the hops. Lots and lots of different fruits, lots of good aftertastes. This beer is just a pleasure to drink. Update (06.28.08) - This beer is overpowering, in a good way. Having this after a token American light beer is a kick in the junk, to relate it to the average American male. It gets in your head, your stomach, and your taste buds. Few beers recreate the satisfying feeling you get while sipping on this IIPA. Hop-heads, rejoice. And if you don't like hops, well... Go drink wine."
"Excellent and solid Double IPA; too bad this is so hard to find here in Southern California! Well worth picking up by anyone, """hop-head""" or not -- it is definitely strong in the hop department, but probably more balanced than other similar IPAs."
"Yum. Orange-gold pour with a nice little head. More citrusy in the aroma with some pine. Medium mouthfeel, not sticky. Bitter and sweet hop flavors ranging from grapefruit to resin. A little woody towards the back. One of the better IIPA's, but not the best."
"Appearance is a thick amber with (as I poured it) about an inch of head. Used a Harpoon IPA pint glass. Clearly smells of hops and a sweet bit of malt. Has a rich warming taste, a bit sweet, with hops and you can't miss the alcohol, though it doesn't stand out. The deliciousness stays in the mouth a bit after each sip. Truly a great experience, but definitely a slow beer to enjoy at a relaxed pace."
"D - Delicious, but intoxicating. I can't ever drink more than one these days. Still, it's always a pleasure from start to finish."
"I visit this DFH pretty frequently and would have it again when available."
"D: This is one of the better IPAs produced in this country. It's very well balanced and easy to drink, more so than the 120 Minute."
"D: This is a pretty well balanced brew. The hops are big but the solid malt backbone just really keeps it in check. Not designed to be a session beer but it is very easy to drink. I think it is a fairly distinctive but solid example of it's style."
" Hop scent mixed with carmel notes hits my noise right away, the taste is smooth & very sweet. The hops hit you almost instantly & finish this beer perfectly. A must have in my cellar."
"D - Very drinkable if you are having a bottle or two. Is relatively smooth and the taste is very good if you are a fan of hops. Beyond one or two it loses points in drinkability only because of the slightly high drinkability. It's not a beer you want to down a bunch of. The hops may also start to get to you after having a couple, which docks it a little in drinkability. A great beer to have if you plan on drinking one with dinner, etc."
"Tastes just as it smells. Very smooth with a hoppy and sweet flavor. very smooth and very drinkable!"
"A nice gold color with a white head. Plenty of lacing. A very nice hoppy nose. The flavor is sweet with a touch of maltyness. It's a very nice flavor with citrus notes coming from the hops. The thickness is good with some nice activity."
"O: A very stron IPA without deep malt flavors."
"Edit: Changed scores from new tasting."
"I know that many on BA will """turn on their stools""" when they hear this but I believe that DFH 90 is the best IPA on the market. It has a great aroma that you can taste at the back of your tongue from the first sniff. The taste will make you a fan and make you open up a second, third, and forth at the first sitting."
"Warm alcohol and mix of great flavors make this a terrific one to have one or more. Outstanding beer."
"Would probably have better drinkability at a slightly lower ABV, but the dry finish the high ABV gives is enjoyable."
"Notes - I was expecting more hops and less malt due to the fact that it's a DIPA, however, this is a surprisingly well-balanced brew. I really liked the 60 minute, but I had that a while ago, so it would be nice to do a side-by-side tasting of 60, 90 and 120. That might leave me on the floor, but the 120 is ready in basement for when the time comes. Overall though, a nicely crafted complex brew that I'd recommend trying."
"I bought 2 cases of this crap only to be thoroughly disappointed. I'm a hop head so i was expecting a hop bomb. What I got was a beer that tasted worse than my first girlfriend."
"Served in a ball-shape glass (Delirium Tremens), once poored, it presented itself with an orange colour an a medium white head that disapeared in about 2 minutes, leaveing a small lace around the glass. The nose as a citrus note, less then its little sister the 60 minute. I would say that a tangerine smell is predominant, but you can find raisins notes. A lot less pine smell the 60 minute, but still present. Carbonation is more delicate so that it's feels creamier in mouth. Bitterness is very well """blended", really not aggressive for a 90 IBUs beer. One of the best if not the best imperial IPA I've tasted so far. can't wait to taste the 120..."
"First time trying this beer and it lived up to the hype. I am a ipa and hop junkie and had heard that this beer was different from its relatives, and it is. Highly recommend this beer, one the better ones I have had."
"d 3 still have to run out of a lot of other stuff before i consider opening a bottle of 90 minute."
"Overall what an experience with the Randall. I'm so glad I got to try it, it is something I will never forget. If you get a chance where the Randall is running, get there and try it. DFH and Capones is a great match."
"Pretty darn nice overall. Guess that's why this is review #1718."
"D: I like this beer as a night-cap. I can't drink this as much as other doubles out there. I guess what I'm trying to say is it's heavy."
"D - It depends on your definition of drinkabilty. Based on style, this ia a great drinking DIPA. Maybe not my favorite, as I am partial to Great Divide's offering of Hercules, but a really good DIPA that drinks well."
"Pours a brownish-reddish color body with a foamy white head, that is big and lasting. Very hoppy, green, Very enticing. Malty sweet taste. Hoppy & bitter. Warming up...a little more smooth, but still malty."
"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into my SA pint glass. It pours a hazy copper with a fomy head. The head does not stick around long, but leaves nice rings around the glass. The smell is like a fresh Christmas tree, yet not too overpowering. The beer is heavy on pine notes through the entire palate. The finish is leaves an oily sweetness on the tongue. The beer has medium body, and average carbonation for the style. 90 minute is suprisingly drinkable for the amount of hops in every sip. This is one of my all time favorites, and it never disappoints!"
"I'm still trying to figure out where all the hops are in this. Not very drinkable and the heavy malt sweetness is very unbalanced. I personally don't think this should be called an IPA."
"check it out"
"Best offering from DFH by far. NO fruit or crazy extras. Just a huge IPA well done."
"The beer appears pretty medium bodied but it has thickness to it that sticks with ya, although the relatively high carbonation makes this quite a refreshing beer, especially considering the ABV which is very well hidden. This could be dangerous, as I really enjoy the beer, but it wouldn't take much to be """one too many"""."
"Bottle at the Clark Sreet Ale House in Chicago. Pours a clear amber body with a medium white head. An awesome nose of citrus and grapfruit hops, also some sweet cake. The taste was full of tons of hops, not too bitter except in the finish, generally quite sweet actually. Some wood and sugary flavors too. Very good IPA. Enjoyable and not too hot."
"There are those who contend this is THE best IPA being made in the United States these days. Such a bold claim had to be vindicated. Off a tap in Bar Harbor Maine this beer was a deep orange color with perfect clarity. The head was off-white with a slightly yellow tint. Very good retention and nice lacing. The aroma was very aggressively hoppy, big notes of pine and citrus with some resin behind that. The flavors followed suit but were better balanced. Deep and complex hops with a pale malt backbone in the middle. The hops make the beer distinctly bitter but not much so though the finish was a little oily. The carbonation was spot-on, the body medium to full and the mouthfeel excellent. To claim any beer is the best of its kind is rather pretentious but I had to admit this was definitely one of THE best IPA's I've ever had."
"Pours dark golden in color with a nice head that settles quickly. Leaves a slight amount of lacing as it maintains a spotty head down the glass. Piney hops on the nose with a funky sweet bread/nut note that I have not detected in other DIPA's. The taste is very smooth - the hops commingle perfectly with the malt to keep this beer well balanced, especially given its high ABV. Finishes long, with great lingering bitterness from the hops. A bit of alcohol pokes through at this point to add depth and warmth. Good carbonation and a medium body add to the great drinkability of this brew. Glad to have finally tried my first Dogfish. Very good beer that I will buy from time-to-time but nothing that needs to be in my fridge 24/7."
"D- This is a pretty strong beer for an everyday drink"
"-NC beer monger loves this beer!"
"The taste is interesting, sweet, spiceym and bitter, with flavours developing dry bread crust, prunes, hints of grpaefruit, leaves, caramel, candied fruit, spicey raisins, candy, alcoholic spice and warmth. The thick sweetness soon gives way, just barely, to rich hop flavours and tingly bitterness that sit on the sides of the tounge. It's wodnerfyl, rich, engaging, with everything coordinated and it's highly drinkable."
"This is definitely worth checking out. I wish it came in more than a 4 pack though. Even though the alcohol is up there I would love to session a beer like this. Because of availability and price I've never had more than 2 on hand."
"If you find yourself at the store trying to decide between the 6'er of DFH 60 Minute and the 4 pack of 90 Minute, go for the 90. It won't disappoint."
"Hops and alcohol, alcohol and hops...what a beautiful thing it is! This is my first beer review so please excuse my lack of verbosity. Others before me have covered it nicely. I like this beer a lot! If you don't like hops and alcohol, stay away from this stuff. it will snap you head back...Nuff said"
"Overall, a really nice beer, even though I was expecting more bitterness out of it."
"Now I remember why I haven't picked this one up recently. Decently-crafted but maybe it's the water that provides that ultra-earthiness. Not for me."
"D: A very drinkable Imperial IPA. Hops and alcohol are not overbearing and well balanced by the sweet malts. I can definitely see myself hanging out, whenever, and really enjoying this brew. Very good beer."
"D - This beer is AMAZING. The initial complex taste of nuttiness and a floral hop taste makes this a fabulous choice for hop heads! The thickness of this beer makes it a difficult beer if you're planning to drink more than one or two, but it's most definitely the best beer I've ever had when it comes to relaxing and truly enjoying a beer."
"D - Personally I think this beer lacks drinkability. Its a great beer to have here and there but overall I could not see having more than one or two at the most in a sitting."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. One finger of head fades quickly leaving lots of lacing. Very fruity and floral aroma. Initially sweet and malty, becoming aggressively hoppy and bitter. Full bodied and syrupy mouthfeel. Too heavy to be super drinkable, but very smooth."
"D - Not very drinkable to me. This one bottle has wiped out my need for sugar and malt for the night. Time for something bitter."
"Head retention was good left lace on the way down. Taste was malty with hops and lots of them a little grapefruit. After taste was plesent and lingered for a min or two. Mouthfeel was thick but carbonation seemed a little lite. Drinkability was good I would buy it again but you have to be carefull this beer is stronger than it tastes. This beer left perfect lacing and was a perfect beer for a cool fall day like this."
"D: This is my first ever Dogfish Head beer and I think it's the best IPA I've had so far. The flavour and mouthfeel is so rich and creamy, yet, it is so well balanced that it is very easy to throw back. This is truly a beer to savour - truly the nectar of the gods. IPA fans, find this beer."
"I love this beer - I usually pour this into a rounded tumbler or stemless wine glass - color, clarity and head make for a nice looking beer to sit down with and savor on it's own - I find it amusing that another recent reviewer quaffed the smell of cat piss here - a friend of mine made the same comment when we were swigging a couple of these down after a bike ride - I'd never thought that to be, but since he mentioned it, I think of cat piss every time I open one of these (damn you, brendan!) and quickly get past it and move on to the excellent tastes that follow - a nice hop bite with a sweet finish - very drinkable - and not in the bud lite way- gotta watch that 9% - I usually enjoy two of these in a sitting - good stuff."
"D: Extremely impressed by this brew, the sweet and hoppy balance was pretty unique and I was hooked! Definetly distinct from a West Coast IPA, but still provided that always hard to find balance between the hops and malt. DFH has another big winner here and this is further proof that I've gotta try me some more of their brews."
"Served in my DT snifter. Poured a translucent copper with copious tiny bubbles adhering to the bowl of the glass and effervescing up to the underside of the cap. One inch frothy, off-white head lost half its volume in under a minute before settling into a soapy skim that coalesced around the shoulders. Some strands of watering lacing adhered during the session. Nose is pine, grapefruit/citrus and sweet. Taste follows nose with more piney hops, dry and bitter, but taste does not linger. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, slightly viscous with a consistent, mild effervescence through the background. I'm really just starting to explore the style, but very enjoyable without being cloying."
" I LIKE!!"
"For an imperial IPA, Dogfish Head 90 Minute has a subtle malt taste to it. Because of that, it lends itself to be much more drinkable than the average hop-driven beer."
"The flavor is noticeably more open on tap than bottled."
"orangy and golden. there is about two fingers of head that leaves quickly. this one smells hoppier and fruitier than the 60 minute. the alcohol hits pretty hard in the taste for this one. it is not as hoppy as i expected but there is a sweetness in there too, similar to carmel."
"Palate- First sip, a mouthful of wonderful citric hops. Very well balance, no hop bomb here, plenty of caramel malt. Ruby Red grapefruit, caramel nuttiness, very smooth, very nicely carbonated. Long bitter dry finish, very nice."
"D: I gave this a 5 because it is the most drinkable double ipa available. I didnt like ipas before i tried this beer. It is so wonderfully balanced, with such little typical ipa aftertaste, that it singlehandedly got me addicted to an excellent style. simply put, it doesnt taste like you would expect an imperial ipa to taste."
"Incredibly smooth for a hoppy imperial IPA. No bitter aftertaste and deep and complex flavors that go down smooth."
"You will keep reaching for this one, although drinking more than 2 in one night would seem like a challenge. A challenge that I am up to."
"Just a damn great beer. One of my personal favorites. It's like that music CD you pick up and listen to for like four straight months. Addictive and perfect."
"This is a really good beer. Compared to some other double IPA's I've had, this one isn't nearly as in-your-face, but I think that is a good thing and makes it much more drinkable. Possibly dangerously so, considering the 9% ABV."
"Drinkability is great, is a just a definative example of a DIPA and the American craft brew renaissance of the 20+ years. dangerously easy drinking, it could stand a bit more hop flavor to match the aroma and chewy malt backbone, but is nevertheless a great beer."
"D - At 9% the pack of 4 I bought was perfect. However, I feel like I could drink a lot more if it was less ABV'ed. Must admit, could hardly taste the alcohol"
"I see this beer got a lot of hype so I bought a single of it. I thought it was a good beer overall, but nothing too spectacular. I've had a handful of better tasting/more balanced DIPA's in my opinion but maybe its just me. Tastes very complex and isn't as hoppy as some other DIPA's out there which makes it a bit tougher in the drinkability department. Overall though it's much better than average, but I don't know about being an excellent beer."
"This is one of my favorite IPAs. Amber and transparent. Smells and tastes of piney hops and sweet maltiness. Very well balanced flavors. It's funny, because this is more balanced than many hoppier pale ales I've had. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky. A very rich beer. Can't drink too much as a result, but with the taste so nicely balanced, I'm tempted to go overboard anyway. Fantastic brew, and glad we now get it in California."
"Quality IPA, possibly one of the better ones I have had. Would like to try out the others but only picked up a couple while passing through Madison. Has kind of low session ability due to high ABV, one or two max."
"Had on tap at Mentor Winking Lizard 10/2/08. Smells as good as it looks. First sip is sweet and then quite hoppy. Delicious. At 9% it's surprising how easy it is to drink this beer. Not just sip, but drink. Ok, 3 pints is the limit, but I would like to drink this all day. I just can't."
"Overall: Nothing short of EXCELLENT. GRAB A PACK!"
"D: Extremely drinkable double IPA with incredible hop aroma and flavor. One of my new favorites!"
"Bottle - Standard DFH bottle with simple explanation of what one is about to experience..."
"Great brew."
"Dogfish Head is such a fine brewery, I never met a Dogfish I didn't like!!! I was not an IPA fan, but this 2007 bottleof 90 IPA is supurb!!! The hops aren't overwhelming and most tolerable. I would drink this beauty anywhere and anytime!! Just not your typical IPA."
"D: Despite high ABV, remarkably drinkable. Well done DFH!"
"I've heard knocks against Dogfish for not being hoppy enough and being too coffee; and also inconsistent in taste. I can't disagree completely, because it's not a beast of a beer, and certainly is not your typical DIPA. That said, every time I open a bottle I am completely satisfied with the taste and complexity - and never feel that it is inconsistent. Dogfish brands itself as """off-centered""" and lives up to it."
"Notes: I had bought a """4-pack""" of these about a month ago and (of course) tasted it but had not recorded my thoughts at that time. Saw it tonight on tap and decided to rate it properly. I suppose hopheads would love this but I do not. If you like hops, no need to look further than this beer for satisfaction."
"As good as a DIPA gets. Amazing brew."
"Classic beer."
"4.5/3.5/4/4.5/4.5"
"Is it the best DIPA around? Probably not. It is one of the more sessionable ones, such as it is? I think it is."
"Very clean mouthfeel with a slight sourness as time wears on. This is a drinkable beer to me that is slightly too hoppy to have many of. Not to mention the high abv. I'll be looking forward to getting a 4 or 6 pack and really detecting all the scents and flavors."
"D: This beer is a sipper nonetheless. At 9% ABV, just relax and savor this beer for what it is. Lawnmowers and 90 Minute IPA need not co-mingle."
"D: I will definitely buy more of this!"
"This beer pours a deep amber color with a nice off white head that sticks around for a while and leaves nice lacing on the glass. The taste is really hoppy and smells sweet. This beer has medium body and nice carbonation. I would not have more than two of these because of the high abv. One of my favorite IPAs and exellent when fresh."
"Very nice DIPA."
"This is my first review so it will be far from perfect. I poured this into a snifter and it had a beautiful copper color with a slight head. It smelled of grapfruit, but it didn't have as strong of a hop smell as I expected. The taste blew me away. It was no where near as hoppy as I expected, as it was amazingly balanced. I could slightly feal the warmth of the alcohol as it went down. Overall I thought this beer was amazing. It was perfectly balanced and rather easy to drink making this a very deceptive and dangerous beer since it is 9% abv. I only purchased a single from Total Wine so I can't wait to drink this again."
"The color is almost hazelnut I would say, though somewhat amber, with a dissipating thin creamy white head. Little carbonation it seems and quite clear, not at all cloudy. A lot of citrus in this one, delicious grapefruit tones come in wave after wave. Orange and clove perhaps? A tad bit spicy even. A moderately high level of hop scent comes through. Extremely smooth and very little alcohol noticed at all. A kind of malty sweetness to this ipa, which is unusual though quite pleasant. A great body, firm and chewy in the mouth and not at all quick to leave. The finish is long and quite light. Really a solid imperial ipa that I will definitely look out for whenever I'm out of state."
"Poured into Duvel glass. Normally I get some nice looking beer out of this glass but not with this one. Clear, and golden-orange in color the head was pretty small and minimal retention and lacing...a little suprised by that. The smell is nice, pretty much 100% hops, very fresh ones too. Although, maybe its being a West Coaster, its a new hop smell to me. Not familiar but very nice smelling. Taste is good as well. Of course you taste the hops but it was a little more balanced that I expected. Hoppy with some sweet malt, and a bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was pleasant and on the light side. The higher ABV was very, very well hidden. Overall a good beer, easily drinkable and I could see this getting some people into real trouble."
"D - Very high for a 9% brew!"
"poured a nice amber color with a minimal head and nice lacing. The smell is nice citrusy hops to it. the taste is a bit bitter with malts too. Overall i like this beer very much the only thing that i dont like is it only comes in 4 packs but that certainly wont stop me from getting it again."
"I really like this beer a lot. It has the strong taste of hops bt not the extreme bitterness that can turn me off of some IPAs. Highly recommend this one."
"On Tap at Stone Brewing World Bistro and Gardens. Pours amber/orange with small white head. Aroma of sweet hops and citrus. Cloudy. Flavor begins spicy and hoppy then finishes with flavors of nice citrus and roasted nuts. Very impressive Imperial IPA! Damn this is good!"
"Very drinkable Imperial IPA."
"Drinkability: Drinkability suffers a bit from the sweetness and huge flavors of this beer. Also a bit hot. Definitely a sipper in my opinion."
"D - Overall this is a great imperial IPA. I wish that someone would distribute these closer to where I live."
"The dogfish head 90 minute IPA is a mild amber color with an good aroma typical of a strong IPA. The taste is good, i prefer the sam adams imperial pilsner as a comparable brew, but even so, i would not turn down the chance to enjoy one of these. It has an above average mouthfeel, but not perfect. I did give it a perfect score for drinkability. Given the fact that it contains 9% abv, it was very easily masked."
"I went to pick up a six pack of DFH 60 but the little beer store was all out. They had the 90 Minute so I bought that. I poured a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a light amber color with moderate head. Lots of lacing. Smells more sweet and citrusy than hoppy, though the hoppiness is certainly noticable. Medium bodied and slightly carbonated. Leaves a little stickiness in the mouth. The taste is very nice...similar to the aroma and well balanced for a DIPA. Not as much of a hoppy bite as I've noticed with other DIPA's. Almost no bitter aftertaste. Goes down real easy for a stronger beer. I look forward to bottle #2."
"D. The drinkability is surprisingly good with the abv. at 9%. But easy to drink. Quite refreshing. I would like to drink a couple of these at the next session. Highly recommended."
"Color is a deep orange with a bit of white head, but not much. Smells strongly of citrus. Tastes of citrus: grapefruit, some orange, and some spices, maybe ginger. The spicy taste tended to distract from the hop flavor. Something is just off with this, but it's hard to put my finger on it. At any rate, it's not as intense as most DIPA's and it didn't impress me all that much."
"A delicious complex imperial IPA. It hides the 9% abv extremely well with the loads of flavors, making it easy to drink. One of my favorites of this particular style. If you haven't tried this one you owe it to yourself, especially if you are a hops head."
"Pours a nice clear copper with few bubbles and a medium, off-white head. Nice retention and lacing. Smells strongly of bitter hops and sweet earthy grain. Slightly metallic. Taste is bitter, citric, hops with a lot of strong, sweet, biscuity malt and some spice. I appreciate that DFH tries to counter the hops with malt, but rather than coexisting to create a nice balance, 90 minute is simultaneously a hop-bomb and a malt-bomb. It's certainly very flavorful, but very disjointed and seriously unrefined. The malt at least gives it a thick feel. Too big to be very drinkable."
"Smooth and powerful Double IPA. Very bitter and strong (as are all in this style), but this IMO has more flavor than most. I could have several of these in a night without a problem. One of my favorites."
"D: Pretty unique take on this style especially considering some of the huge hop bomb beers out there."
"Looking forward to having more of this beer!!!"
"Drinkability: Very nice for the style. Perhaps a bit too """thick""" to enjoy more than one at a time."
"D.I could keep drinking these, but the alcohol will sneak up on you."
"Definitely try this wether you like IPA's or not."
"D- Goes great with my favorite spicy foods"
"Overall: giver a shot for sure"
"Honestly, I don't think I have ever enjoyed a beer as perfectly balanced on the palate as this one. As far as flavor goes, this ranks up there as one of the best beers I've ever had. Despite the relatively high 9% ABV, I want more, and more, and could easily drink more, and more. It is just too good."
"Nice copper color with a off-white head and some really nice lacing. The aroma is fruity with hops but not over powering. Sweet caramel malts, a bit candy-like, with grapefruit hops. Some bitterness but the hops are relatively tame for the style. Balanced nicely. This is a nice beer but could use stronger hops with more bitterness to make this a true top Imperial IPA. But despite that this still very tasty."
"D - Excellent, but I think I could get hop fatigue if I tried to drink more than two. This was a real eye-opener. Very good and rated accordingly, but if pressed, I think I would prefer a bottle with about 3-4 months age on it, as I gave a similar bottle straight 5s in an earlier review. I love the fresh barley malt bill in this beer too much to have it almost completely overshadowed by hops."
"D: Not bad for an Imperial."
"I can't find enough great things to say about this one. Hopefully I can find it on draft somewhere locally. Enjoy! Seek this out if possible! Wow!"
"Flavors are delicately-perfect balance of citric sweetness, hoppy bitterness, all finished by alcohol warmness. Flavor is biting on the finish, crisp, clean, no sticky sickening sweetness left gumming up your throat or mouth. Completely, utterly drinkable to sum it up. If you aren't a fan of IPAs or hops(I wasn't) then let this beer convert you and become a proud HOPHEAD!"
"This is one of the best DIPAs I've had."
"Infinite thanks to swizzlenuts for this one!!!"
"Drinkability: Very good for a beer this big. Wonderfully blended flavor and supremely smooth feel make this a easy, painless 9 percenter. Glad this is FINALLY available in the Bay Area. I'll be back."
"A greatly drinkable beer, espcially considering its 9% ABV."
"overall not bitter as i would like it too be, too be honest i don't see the reason for such a high rating."
"Well worth trying if you are not familiar with it, but not your typical IPA by any means."
"M,D: The mouthfeel is rather heavy on this one, but the active carbonation makes up for that. The high ABV is hidden extremely well by the hops, so don't expect to have just one!"
"Man oh man, hops never tasted so good. Light golden brown color with a full head that sticks to the top for the duration of the drink. Hoppy aroma of citrus, pine, mint, caramel/nuttiness from the malt. A crisp and refreshing brew that is medium bodied with light carbonation. Some initial citrus notes dance on the tongue with pine followed by a dry hopness monster along with nutty malt and cloying booze and mint. 9% ABV camouflaged in the garden of hops. It's crouching like a tiger ready to strike and knock you out. Wait...I think i hear something behind me."
"One pint fills you up, but a second beer is very tempting if you aren't too far under because it packs a good punch. Possibly the best American beer, no kidding. I hope this beer never changes, and becomes cheaper than Bud."
"Edit: Upon another tasting, I admired the appearance much more. Huge, thick lacing. Tons of slow-moving carbonation bubbles added to the appeal."
"D - I could drink this every day of summer. The 9% ABV could be a reason not to drink many at a sitting. It's not for those who aren't into hoppy beers but it is no hop rocket either."
"D- Would I sit and drink these all night? No. But for how high the ABV is, this beer is extremely drinkable."
"Drinkability: Nice beer. Would buy again if I could afford it"
"Overall a very unique and drinkable DIPA."
"D: Supremely drinkable IPA, but not quite as hoppy as I would like, or as I was expecting to be honest. I had this on tap at The Library in Santa Monica a few months ago and it did NOT taste like this. This could mean one of two things-the bottle is pretty old (can't tell, no bottle dating), or the wasabi peas I ate a few hours ago completely killed my taste buds. Regardless, this is a very nice beer, but I'm just used to the taste bud assault of my west coast DIPA's, and just don't get it with this."
"it might be more malty than i remember"
"Here's a malt lover, giving 90-Minute a high score, so you know it must be well-made and totally balanced. I'll have it again for sure!"
"D: I really enjoy this beer. It has a big hop flavor, but I feel this beer would be very approachable to people who otherwise wouldn't appreciate a hoppy beer."
"This is a big beer. Apon pouring into my favorite pint glass, the hop aroma isnt as strong as I would have liked. The color was a rich copper. The flavor was malty sweet, and IMO the hop flavor was hidden by the alcohol and the malty sweetness. This beer is a cut above the rest, only due to its high quality ingredients. The mouthfeel is syurpy, and its drinkability is no more than a 2-3. If you want a nice hoppy beer, go with the 60 minute"
"This beer pours a slightly hazy copper colour, with an inch of sticky, bubbly head, that takes a few minutes to disappear. Looks like a consummate IPA. The smell is very malty, with a background essence of citrus-aroma hops. A bit of heat in there too. The taste is very heavy on the sweet, molasses side, until the follow through on the finish, where the sides of my mouth perked up to the latent hop character in the balancing act that is this beer. I think the hops may have quieted down a fair bit in this bottle, which is over a year old, the majority of that time being in my fridge. Nonetheless, this is a big beer, which comes together fairly nicely overall, for its elevated alcohol. It definitely becomes nice and smooth once the constituent flavours have had a chance to mingle."
"D: Unsurprisingly, this is very drinkable beer despite it's high ABV. Great taste, unbelievable mouthfeel. Awesome IIPA!"
"This is actually one of the first IPAs that I ever had, after Stone Ruination (starting out strong!). Since that time it has gradually faded from my favorites as I have tried other DIPAs. This one just ends up seeming a touch too low on the bitterness and high on the maltiness scale. Don't get me wrong, it's a great beer, just a touch too sweet for my taste."
"I conned the people that I was with, into throwing me into a car and head up the road from Bethany, through Dewey and into Rehobeth...Use the GPS...and then stated that there was some sort of Ice Cream joint on the way...(I managed to escape)... and found my way to.... the 90 Minute IPA @ the DFH Brew Pub in Rehobeth....Through the Randall/Randell/ (whatever the spelling is) device....Let's just say that I was somewhere between Barstow and Baker...Holy Crap...I smelled hops aprox one foot away from the pint glass...Can you argue with that...But I could only drink one...Then I moved On to the Midas Touch...What can I say more than anyone else...Cheers to the DFH"
"This beer is always readily available in fridge, superb drinkability."
"Quintessential attainable IIPA experience. The baby brother of my favorite beer, DFH 120 minute IIPA. I would love to expand on the complexity, but I do not believe there is much to expand upon. This beverage represents what is desirable in a IIPA: Heavy on the hops, bit of alcohol bite, and smooth drinkability."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Huge hear required me to wait before finishing the pour. Looking thru the glass this beer is dark gold, clear, with hardly any bubbles...looks solid. Taste was a little more on the alcohol side than I had expected...especially after reading the reviews. The hops was great and balanced well...overall a good beer and I enjoyed it, not sure if I could drink more that one at a time due to the alcohol taste."
"Dogfish Head is a brewery that consistently produces a quality beer. Their 90 minute IPA is no exception. It's look is deep in color, as IPA's go, and as you swirl it the beer takes on a look not unlike many scottish ales. 90 minute IPA will hold a thick head at first pour which will recede to a thin lace as it warms. This beer is idealy drank in a stemmed glass will a large bulb and a tight rim. This is so the amazing fruity nose can build; this happens to be this beer's most striking characteric. The aroma does not end with the first whiff. As you drink this beer you will go from liking it to loving it. Usually breweries tend to try to hard when producing an IPA and get it wrong with either too much hop bite or too little alcohol. Dogfish head's 90 minute IPA is probably the best balance between hop, malt, and alcohol of any beer I have had the pleasure of enjoying. I recommend cooling this beer to around 55 degrees and drinking it slowly so that you will give it time to warm. As it warms you will find a """sweet spot""" where all the flavors blend. I estimate this around 61 degrees. Enjoy!"
"WOW, this is one amazing brew! Sampled a 12 ounce bottle which I poured into a merlot glass. The aroma was an intense mixture of hops, sweet malts, and more hops. The bitterness of the aroma lead me to believe that this beer may be too much for me. In the glass this beer is a wonderful amber color with ample head and very nice lacing. Once I took my first taste I was immediately blown away by the flavor of this beer. The hops were not overpowering like I had expected, in fact they hit you at first but mellow out to give way to some nice malt flavors. This beer is extremely high in alcohol content but you wouldn't know by the flavor which hides it well. I could definitely see myself enjoying a few of these and then sliding back into my comfy chair with a very nice mellow buzz."
" P.S.- If your a fan of this double IPA, try butte creek's organic one."
"Highly recommended, especially on tap. One of Dogfish's finest."
"Damn good two-I. Worth it's rep as one of the best (and being so widely available doesn't hurt)."
"drinkability: at 9% this beer pack a wallop, i'll have maybe two."
"Poured a light amber in color with a white head. There is a very nice aroma, a lot of hops. The aroma was very intoxicating. I was suprised by the taste. A lot of hops, but not very bitter. The only taste I could home in was hops, but it was excellent in flavor. Mouthfeel was good, almost thick enough to chew. After one or two, I might get tired of the flavor. Quite a bit of hops, and it sits a bit on the heavy side."
"Overall it's an intensely hoppy IIPA with lots of citrusy/spicy/piney character. A bit sweet and lacking in malt character which could be corrected by finishing the beer out drier. Fix the head retention, too and we've got and even better beer. Still, I'd definitely finish the 1st pint and maybe even a second."
"On tap at Mister Goodbar. Amber colored. Floral and sticky sweet aroma, almost too sweet. The hops are present but the malt sweetness just takes over. It gets syrupy and I can start to taste the alcohol as well. I had a hard time finishing a pint of this."
"Drinkability: I really like this beer. The hops really hit your palate, but there is enough malt there to balance it out. I wouldn't call this a session beer, but I do think it hides the 9% abv very well. I am pretty sure I could drink one of these every day and be happy."
"This bottle has been in my fridge for a while, so I actually think the hops have started to become a little muted and the malt flavors have started to assert themselves. Still a wonderful beer, just a little different. Fresh, this beer will rival any double IPA in pure enjoyability. My highest recommendation, if you have not had it before I suggest seeking it out. Really the archetype of the Double IPA style."
"This beer treats us right."
"Highly drinkable but I would keep myself to two a sitting because of the alcohol will sneak up on you. Like I said my go to DIPA for a long time"
"D- Incredibly drinkable, the alcohol in this one really sneaks up on you. Perhaps I was so impressed with everything else about this brew that I just forgot about the 9%. A great drink to go with a meal. Everything about this beer impressed me, the look, the aroma, the taste, the mouthfeel."
"Drinkability is rather high. It's just great flavor making you want to guzzle. The alcohol is really well hidden as well."
"D: obviously a great beer, and if you haven't had it, either you are 21 or have been hiding under a rock for a while. Beautiful."
"Enjoyed this DIPA to the utmost extreme! I would like to thank sincereNc for the chance to sample this wonderful beer."
"D - The ABV keeps this one limited but otherwise it's incredibly, if not dangerously, drinkable."
"This is a classic, and I realize I'm not nearly the first on this site to write in these glowing terms. Go have one if you haven't. It may be time for another if you have."
"There is no question in my mind that I have a new favorite beer. The incredibly balanced, yet complex nature of this brew makes it an instant hit with me. Congrats and thanks to brewers at Dogfish Head."
"The label says that this brew's 90-minute hop addition is balanced by a """ridiculous amount of English Two-Row Barley.""" I almost feel like in trying to compensate for the hops, they overdid it with the malts-- but that's not a bad thing! Just not what I expected. Dangerously drinkable at 9% as well. Savor this one. Nothing is quite like it."
"I would definitely recommend this beer to someone who is a fan of Double IPA's and can handle the ABV of this monster beer."
"D - A little intense in the abv and in flavor to go with more than one without a break."
"Serving type: draught"
"D- Overall a pretty nice IPA. Its definitely a big one with lots of hops and a high ABV. The balance could be slightly better but hardly hurts the end product. I would drink this beer again but only one at a time."
"D: I just love the balance of this beer. The flavor coats your mouth and fades off perfectly. Because of the sweetness (and alchohol content). I couldn't drink more than one a night but what a treat."
"Mouthfeel is perfect and drinkibility superb. It has earned a starting spot in my lineup based on these qualities."
"I want more ... I am going to stock up on this one ..."
"Poured a dark hazy burnt orange color with a glorious amount of foam which left big chunks of lacing down the glass. Thousands of little carbonation bubbles rise to the top keep a nice thick cap until the bitter end (pun intended). Perfect in appearance. Aroma is caramel malts and hops, hops, hops. Yum, and double yum when it comes to the taste. Perfectly balanced IPA with a """ridiculous""" amount of two-row pale malts (as the box so boldly states) to keep up with incredible hop edition. I'd only like to discover. """Mystery Hop X"""!! Excellent flavors of pineapple, candied citrus, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, coating the tongue perfectly with oily hop citrus zest that I love."
"I want more."
"D: Drinks pretty well, but the alcohol will keep me from imbibing huge amounts."
"Drinkability: highly drinkable considering the ABV and the amount of hops. Not a session beer, but putting one down is a lot easier than I expected."
"As drinkable as the come for the style. Awesome brew."
"D. Very drinkable, even at 9%. Its just a good imperial. Nuff said."
"Flavor of hops, a fair amount of malt sweetness. A firm and pleaseat hop bitterness. Never overly bitter, neither cloying sweet. A great beer."
"This has some of the great complexities of the 120min and is a good drinkable beer. The first beer I think of when I think of a DIPA. If you are looking to tie one on and really enjoy what you are drinking, this is a good way to do both."
"Awesome bottled. Flat out kickass on tap."
"poured it into a mug, have i nice smell, a good amber color, good beer with a nice little kick, probly the best ipa beer ive had, the only bad thing was that i could only find them in four packs for 10.00 or a single for 4.00, it is a good beer but i dont know if its that good."
"Poured into a tulip glass, the beer produced a very nice, deep clear red/amber color, with a thick white head. The aroma was nice, thick and full of hops with a hint of sweetness. The taste is very good. Full bodied, hoppy, as you would expect, with hints of the malt and a very light hint of pine. Overall, very well done IPA. Very drinkable, smooth with some aftertaste, but very enjoyable. I will definately be buying more of this in the hear future."
"Very delicious. I have no complaints or anything I would change. Perfect American double."
"There is a reason it is a 4 pack. The ABV will sneek up on you by the 3rd one. So save the forth for another day."
"D: I like this beer, but high ABV keeps me from doing more than 2-3 in a sitting."
"I can say my ratings improved since my original review, but I am still not that impressed. Guess it goes back to me being used to the west coast IPA flavors. I know many east coasters prefer this over anything and I respect their opinion."
"D - on a hot summer day I can go through a few of these, but for that matter on a cold winter nightI find myself reaching for a 90 min. as well.."
"I've had this beer a few times before, and could never really decide if I liked it or not. I tried it this time with the intent of writing a review, and I am glad I did."
"I enjoyed this more than the last time, but it still doesn't quite jump on me like it does for other people, it kind of like a little of everything but nothing dominates. So yes its very ballanced and complex and I recognice it as a very good quality brew, but for some reason for me it just doesn't give that WOW factor that others seem to get."
"Refreshing and eminently quaffable, but heed warning, for this one will enthusiastically drown any who over indulge."
"Absolutely the best balance on an IPA I have ever had, Way to go DFH I have heard good things and was not let down."
"D: Much easier than I remembered and a great examples of how these boys are forging their own kettle in Deleware."
"Poured a dark red/orange color with plenty of sudsy dark colored head that stuck to the side of the glass for the entire session. Smell is plenty floral and a little slight citrus, obviously the hops shone through. Taste is very floral with a malt backbone that stuck out. Mouth feel is prickly with plenty of carbonation to stand out and make this one a sipper."
"D - Great IPA brew; exciting to see a brewery doing this with the style; I normally dont session IPAs too much b/c of the lingering bitterness, but I could definitely intersperse this one. Worth checking out, for sure..."
"Edit note: As this goes down the color clears to a peach, ice tea color. Lace sticks around real well."
"T-The degree of complexity to this beer spun my head around and the balance of it just did it again smooth smooth smooth, hints of hops, and grapefruit and a wonderful finish that just leaves you wanting another drink i found myself sipping it very lightly and savored the beer for quite a long time. i'd say a meduim to light bodied brew with a good degree of carbonation. I would drink this beer on a regular basis and as soon as it makes its way to springfiled i will do so, it did not let me down and in many ways exceeded my expectations i cant stress enough you can read all these reviews a million times over the only way to truly grasp this one is to have it."
"drinkability: Ok so it tastes good, it looks nice and it smells good as well. When really brings it together is the mouthfeel though, so smooth, so perfectly cleansing, the carbonation makes the flavors pop perfectly. Awesome beer."
"D: Phew, I'm not a big fan of this style but I could certainly keep going..."
"D: 90 Minute IPA is a tasty DIPA that exemplifies the style nicely. Though not an uber-hop-bomb like some others in the style, it's still got a complex flavor, wonderful aroma, and great appearance."
"Overall, this is a scarily poundable DIPA. At 9% you can definately feel the alcohol presence but it's masked well. Not the best DIPA but very worthy of a try for any hop head. Cheers!!"
"This is my favorite IIPA. Perfectly balanced & delicious. Worth the cost & worth seeking out."
"This beer to me is the most drinkable, sessionable Double IPA on the market. It poured a beautiful amber orange color with a nice pillowy white head. The smell was thick with oily hops, grapefruit and a touch of potent soil. The flavor was a winner with a nice blast of dark, rich hop flavor in the beginning followed by a great balancing malt backbone, and finished by an aftertaste that was dry yet not bone dry and just sweet enough to make you want to come back for more. At 9% abv this beer is dangerous, enjoy!"
"I tried this beer on June 6, 2008 at """The Beer Bistro""" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a translucent golden brown with a thin white head and a lot of effervescence. The aroma was citrus, perfume, floral hops, some pine, and a little malt. The mouthfeel was medium bodied, medium carboated, and a dry hoppy finish. The flavour was a wallop of grapefruity hops, a little spice, and a little malt. An excellent beer!"
"Overall, this is a very solid effort from Dogfish Head. The hop flavors are there, but not overpoweringly bitter. 9% ABV is not extremely high, but right in there for an Imperial. I really enjoy the bitter beginning and the smooth finish of this beer. The smooth finish makes it one of the most drinkable IPA's I have tasted. The absence of bitterness in the finish gives me a craving for more hop flavor, bringing the glass back to my lips, fantastic."
"Had 2 bottles of this 2 years ago when my friend in Florida sent them to me. I thought they were good then, though since I have formed the opinion that I have access to much better here like Pliny, Pure Hoppiness, Hop 15, and Ruination. But now that DFH is again distributing in CA I decided to try it on tap. It pours a straight amber color with a fluffy off white head. It really is superbly balanced between hops and malt for a double IPA. It's got a good resiny hop feel in the mouth, but a good malt backbone that isn't too syrupy. It's not my favorite type of DIPA (I like a more hoppy one) but it's tasty anyway."
"D - Goes down well, something to sip and savor. Strong but mild enough to be enjoyed frequently. Better than 60 min, not as intense as 120. High on my list."
"Anyway between 60, 90 and 120 minute ipas, the 90 stands out as my favorite as it is more intense and flavorful then the 60 minute ipa, but the 120 minute ipa is almost too intense for everyday."
"D- Easy to drink, defiantly a worthy brew to drink and enjoy. I love the 120 min IPA and I'm soon going to try the 60 min IPA for a good comparison of the DFH IPA series. Good beer."
"A solid brew of this style with a flavor all it's own...glad to see it back here in SoCal!"
"Poured reddish gold with smallish head. Huge aroma of hops and sweet malts. Initial sweet malts (citrus and caramel) is quickly dominated by hops. Seriously bitter aftertaste which lasts for a long time. Big taste. Fretty full mouthfeel. Fairly well balanced for such a hoppy beer. I'm not a hophead but I can appreciate this beer."
"Had a 90 last night at The Chicken Bone on Boylston Street near Fenway Park last night. Came served in a DFH branded snifter, which was a nice surprise. Appears golden orange in color, with a wispy head and lots of lacing on the glass. The smell was a bit tingly on the nose, and the hops are definitely present. Now, as someone who does not consider myself a hop head, I was interested to see what I thought of this beer. I have not had one of these in years, and I thought it was time to revisit it. I guess my palate has changed, because it was really good. Yes, it was hoppy, but it wasn't overpowering like other hop bombs I've tried. This one was very smooth and mellow, allowing me to enjoy every sip as I slowly savored it. I think it got even more drinkable as it warmed to room temp. I still can't believe that this is a double/imperial IPA with 9% abv. DFH has really made an enjoyable hoppy beer for us all. I just wish it hadn't been so long since my last one now."
"Mouthfeel is very nice- sort of rounded and Belgiany but finishes crisp and dry. Drinkable because it's not extreme in any particular area, but I do think the recipe makes an error in leaving out a strong flavoring hop contribution. I don't really feel like I'm getting much of a hop character in any particular aspect of the beer, but maybe I was just expecting something a little more extreme from a brewery known for extreme beers and for a beer with such a strong name."
"Pours a vibrant, rich amber with a light head, which dissipates quickly but leaves good lacing. . The aroma is strong and malty. The flavor is overwhelmingly sweet and sticky, with strong caramel and some hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick and viscous. This is an interesting beer but not one I'd sit and drink more than one of. It's drinkability is hurt severely by it's vast size and sticky, viscous character."
"Mouthfeel is slick and chewy, and overall, this is highly drinkable, especially for 9%. Still, I'd prefer to sit down with the 60 minute. But not at all shabby."
" I think I really,really,really, like this beer-really. I will buy a six pack next time. Never mind the ABV,full steam ahead."
"D: With a whopping 9%, this one is just too much to quaff more than one or two at a session. Overall, this is one of the more outstanding beers I've ever come across period."
"After having tried the 60 minute and 120 minute IPA's I figure it's time to try the 90 minute. If it's anything like the other two, it's gonna be good. Pours dark copper with orange hues. A thick, 1/2 inch white head sits atop for a good while before patiently settling down with little lacing left behind. Smells of sweet and smooth citrus' with the hops blended in the background among some sweet malts and an earthy and grassy essence floating around as well. The palate is filled with zesty oranges, lemons, spices, grapefruit, dry hops, some underlying breadiness, phenols and a good hit of alcohol which ends the event perfectly. Really good carbonation keeps things interesting and the mouthfeel is pretty smooth, albeit a bit of chalkiness exists. I would describe it as light to medium bodied. Excellent brew, and I hope we get the Dogfish in these parts soon. The word on the street says it could be so. This is quality."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, thicker o.g., easy to drink for abv, one of my favorites ever :D"
"Overall, very good but I still prefer standard IPAs to double/imperial most of the time."
"Alright, time to plunk down my two cents about one of the most reveared DIPAs on the market. Let me begin by admitting a personal biased FOR DFH 90 as it was my 'gateway' drug into craft beers. And I thank it every day for its enlightening effects. This bad little brew was my first imperial IPA and I haven't looked back since. Well, now that all the meaningless back-story is out of the way, how does it stack up after all these years of pleasurable quaffing? Pours a brillant light amber with a stout, dense little collar. It has such a distinctive smell; not overwhelmingly hop-driven, it seems to revolve around toasted, spicy aromas with an under-lying richness. Smells like DFH. In the mouth the smells are given new life with luxurious notes of deep malt, honey accents, resins in perfect harmony and a deliciously restrained bitterness. Very full bodied and full flavored. Once again exhibiting a tell-tale DFH 'house' aspect. Certainly not a bad thing, but it has a signature profile. Yup. Just as tasty as I remember it; not that I had any doubt."
"I enjoyed this at the Brewhaus with some friends.This was my second time sampling this delicious brew and it was even better than I had remembered.It pours a brilliant gold,the color of Gold Passion Alize with amberish red highlights,it looks like a Tequilla sunrise in my pint glass with a tall tan head that has great hang time,this lacing is as nice as I've ever seen.The nose is full of hops,very fruity,with notes of pine.This tastes like a fruit smoothie packed full of peach,orange,and watermelon,not as hoppy as the nose leads on,but plenty of hops in here for all the hop fiends out there(myself included)!The mouthfeel is intense with hops,but not abrassive or taste bud damaging like a lot of other American Doubles can be,very citrusy finish,with a slight hint of alcohol warmth on the back of the tounge.The drinkability is off the charts,along with the price tag,oh well!Great beer!!"
"One of my Favorite IPAs. A huge nosefull of grapefruit, herbs, and flowers. A great selection of hops are used in this beer including a mystery hop. Finishes bitter but balances well with the generous malts. Great with heavily flavored food. I've enjoyed the 60 and 120 but this ranks as an all-time favorite IPA."
"Nice amber color with a frothy tan head. The nose is a tantilizing mixture or hops and fruits. A big malt profile here. The flavor does not dissapoint. Very malty with some well balanced hops. The body is fairy full. This is a very good brew closer to a traditional English Double IPA."
"Straight out of the tap this beer poured a nice copper color with a two finger white head. It smelled delicious. It reminded me of the smell of geueze at first. Hops, wheat, honey, and sweet sugar was detected in the smell. The taste was hoppy. You could get the hops right away, but I caught the wheat/grain, and a little bit of citrus in there as well. The mouthfeel was crisp and I found this beer to be a slow beer to drink because of the mighty hops."
"Taste starts out smooth, followed by the crisp bite of very pronounced hops, which last a long time and produce lots of mouth pucker! I mean, you can taste this beer 5 minutes after your last sip. Be wary of the hops in this beer! Still, the taste is very good, but you have to love hops to fully enjoy it. I'll admit it is not my favorite beer and will never be, but the second one I had was even better than the first, so maybe I am being converted to an extreme beer-lover."
"D: Amazingly drinkable. I was expecting the hops to be overpowering but yet again suprised. I could drink the whole four pack tonight if the price was a bit more affordable. Very refreshing IPA."
"D: This one is very drinkable. Even though it starts out slightly bitter from the hops is finishes extremely clean. There is no warming effect from the alcohol at all. It is so refreshing you go back for more quickly."
"D: excellent. the 9% is no where to be found!"
"An excellent double IPA, though a departure from the extremely hoppy West Coast offerings. Highly recommended."
"D- I was a bit let down that I didn't get any fuzzy feeling on my teeth but this beer is very floral and hopolicius. I don't think I could handle to many glasses but this glass was wonderfull."
"Mouth-feel is good to very good. Goes down smooth and the alcohol is almost non-existent."
"If you love the hops, you must try this brew. My only knock is that this is a BIG brew, as you'd expect from a double IPA. Not necessarily what I'd want to drink everyday."
"On tap at the Moan and Dove. Slightly gold in light, but mainly a very dark amber color appearance with a thin/medium head and eventual lacing. The aromas were incredibly vocal smells of florals, sharp citrus, malt and hops. Initially bitter taste leads to a somewhat sweet aftertaste that really takes advantage of earthy flavors. This beer was a bit heavy for me (especially after a Kolsch) due to its heavy carbonation and tons of hops in it. However, it was typical for an imperial IPA. This drink can easily be appreciated once you get by its harshness. Definitely a solid drink for any evening."
"I've never much liked super hoppy beers; the bitterness makes them unenjoyable. I don't know what Dogfish Head did with this one, but it's amazing and the bitterness is relatively low. A beer that everyone should have at least twice."
"The 90 minute pours a light amber color with a nice foam head that leaves a little lacing on the side of the glass. It also has a freshness date which is nice. The smell is a balanced hopiness to the nose with citrsy aroma. The flavor is a dominant hop one which is to be expected. You don't even taste the alcohol. I would love to drink a six pack of this one but it would be an expensive night. I would say it is well worth your money to buy this beer. It has a spicyness on the finish."
"D - Definitely refreshing and I welcome the East Coast IPA version. Could almost settle for a session beer. Um, a short session."
"Very smooth and creamy feel. Almost chewy, perfect match for the flavor, and a surprisingly crisp finish upping the drinkability."
"This beer poured a clear deep amber and had a slight gold tint in the head which remained. Smells of piny hops and citrus in the background. The taste is the same with a malt backbone to even things out just a bit. The mouth feel is exceptionally smooth and the hop oils leave a silky feel. This is a great sipping beer."
"I Had this beer years ago and loved it then, havent had it in over 7 years, every bit as good as I remember. Buy it."
"I will definitely order it again at the bar."
"Poured with a thick, big head. Orange-amber colored with rich well-balanced taste combining strong hop flavors, alcohol burn, and thick maltiness. Leaves a pleasant oily bitter aftertaste with slight syrupy malt sweetness. I really like this one despite the relatively high alcohol content because the alcohol tastes are integrated with the hop and malt flavors, especially as the beer warms."
"For me, the epitome of a near-perfect DIPA. One of my favorites."
"It's quite drinkable. Though at 9% ABV it might not be such a good idea to go chugging these babies. Stick with one and enjoy the ride."
"All in all a very fine brew, but the chewy malty finish makes too much of a meal out of this one, limiting drinkability, particularly in conjunction with the 9% factor."
"Very nice golden-amber appearance with a thin cream colored lacing. Smells malty and like fresh flowers with the aroma of strong alcohol in the background. I personally can't smell any hops on this pour. Quite bubbly feeling in the mouth, almost harsh - I'd except something smoother from an expensive brew. Tastes very sweet and malty and finishes with the strong flavor of hops. I'm not digging the aftertaste, it is very medicinal. I seem to get this aftertaste with all the Dogfish beers. Personally, I'm not a fan."
"If you like IPA, then this beer will never disappoint. It is everything most IPA's only dream of."
"Medium-bodied and strong on most levels, this is not a beer for the meek. It is heavily hopped but fairly balanced, and quite complex, though, and I rather enjoyed this nightcap. Should sleep well tonight now..."
"D: Dangerously drinkable. Delightful. Danke schön Dogfish Head!"
"As good as you can get tastewise for a DIPA, never lets me down."
"Overall, this is different in flavor than I expected, perhaps due to the difference in hops used vs. what I am used to with West Coast style IPAs. Too much alcohol burn in this one, needs to age a bit more to smooth and mellow."
"A prime example of a great imperial india pale ale. Dogfish Head did it again. Pours a beautiful sunset orange. I had it chilled in a pint glass. Smells of fresh floral hops, a little grapefruit and tangerine tartness. Tastes nicely hoppy and leaves the tongue slick. The 9% ABV hits you after the second one."
"Said it was named best IPA in the world by Esquire on label, one of the better ones that is bottled for sure, would drink this all the time if it was not for the price, will have again soon though, definitely recommended"
"Very nice indeed."
"Thanks to gford217 for this one! Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Golden color with a medium-sized head that dissipates to a thin layer of foam. Aroma is piny as well as fruity (think tropical fruits). Taste starts with piny hops and then mellows into tropical fruits and a bit of a floral note. There is a also a little sweet, caramel-like malt, in the aftertaste. This beer is well-carbonated and has a medium body. I usually have trouble drinking a lot of DIPAs, but this is incredibly easy to down. Overall this beer is complex, tasty, and highly drinkable. Can't ask for much more than that."
"Poured a deep reddish amber color with a decent 3 finger head. Head dissipated quickly but left a film all the way down the glass. Smells of hops with a slight scent of malt. Being a fan of the 60 min., I expected a lot from this beer. Where the 60 min. is in your face w/ hops, this beer seems more tamed and drinkable due to the added malt. A complex beer with hints of citric acid (grapefruit?). Leaves a hoppy aftertaste w/ lingering hints of malt. A great beer, extremely drinkable and smooth so watch out w/ that 9% ABV."
"I like this beer a lot in the bottle but I love it on tap."
"For an IPA it poured very thick and had a stout like head. A dense, red tinted brown was in my glass, covered by three-finger head that slowly dissipated and left a complete ring of laces as I drank down the cup. A very hoppy smell does pertrude, of course, but there seemes to be a little hint of sweetness, like caramel or honey or some fruitiness (I can't think of a distinct one though). Also some malt in the smell, and there is bread/coffee malt, or something of that kin, in this beer. There is of course a spiciness to this beer because there is an incredible amount of hops. Unlike some heavy duty IPA's, though, this retains a fullish body that is smooth and flavorful (a little citric) with a dry but not overdone backbite. I am not a big hophead, but if I were I could probably identify the numerous hops they must've put in this brew. Very balanced, and the 9% ABV is hidden well. A great beer whose sessionability is only limited by price and high ABV. A must have for any beer drinker to try, not just IPA fans."
"A very well balanced & highly drinkable DIPA. One of the best examples of the style I've had. I'll definitely seek this one out again."
"Overall a very good beer. In my opinion one of the best drinkable beers in this category. Get some."
"What a beer. If I can't decide what to drink this is always my pick."
"D - highly drinkable for a DIPA. a good brew."
"Pours a cloudy mango color, with a big fluffy white head and nice lacing. Big piney hoppy aroma. Very floral tasting. Flavors are packed with big hops, citrus, mango, grapefruit, and a healthy malt back-bone. Thus far, its without a doubt the best I have ever had from the Dogfish Brewery. I'll definitely buy this again."
"Great beer. Extremely drinkable. I want the rest of the four pack. Next time I visit Wisconsin it might be a Dogfish run. I need to try more of their beers. Two for two at this point!"
"If you think otherwise bring on all challengers; I AM UP TO THE TASK, beermail me I am willing to trade for anything bigger and better."
"Poured in a pub glass. Creamy auburn color with excelent head retention, and spidery lacing. Smelled of earthy and grassy hops. Taste was excellent, but had a strong alcohol finish. Light carbonation, medium to full bodied beer, stung on the way down. Very good DIPA, but made the mistake of drinking this one just after a Hopslam. No comparison there, but absolutley a worthy selection from one of my favorite breweries."
"Emptied the bottle into an oversized wine glass producing a fingers worth of head. Some lacing present as the glass emptied. Nice golden orange/red color with carbonation present. Smelled of pineapple, citrus grapefruit, and pine resin, but where this one departs from average is the taste. Interesting mix between the bitter hops and slightly sweet notes and I could feel the warming effects of the alcohol after each sip. I always have a few bottles of this on hand, tastes great and not too hard to find makes this a big part of my liquid diet."
"Well, this one lived up the expectations fantastically. Really a terrific beer to experience, I'm glad to have finally found a few bottles to try."
"M&D: Mouthfeel is heavier than I might have suspected but it isn't too much. In fact, after tasting it, I would say they nailed it. The carbonation is light and tight, helping to create a creamy texture that sort of dissipates a slightly slippery sensation from the hops. All in all this is damn good and I have no earthly idea why I waited so long to try it."
"MF/D: Thick mouthfeel, a little rough, with decent carbonation. For a double IPA it's drinkability is decent, but one of these is enough for me to scurry back to the hop saftiness of a Sierra Nevada. It's a to each their own brew, and I think that your relationship with hops will be your relationship with this brew - if you LOVE 'em, you'll LOVE this. If you like 'em, you'll like this."
"Highly drinkable. I'm glad it comes in a 4-pack."
"D: one of my favorite IPAs, hefty, but not too strong"
"D - This is an oustanding beer, worthy of it's own hype! It is perfect for savoring - I can sip this and think about how tasty it is, before diving back for more!"
"IMO, this is probably the best East Coast DIPA out there. Big with heavy hitting character that is well balanced, this is one to sit down with, sip, and savor. Just an overall great beer from Dogfish!"
"Definitely a very good one, up there as one of my top 3-4 Imperial IPAs at this point of my travels."
"90 minute IPA pours a clear orange with good fizzy head that lingers for a few minutes. decent lace. Nose is spicey chewy hops. Taste is predominantly hoppy, but not terribly bitter. Hop flavors are rich and abundant with a good malt backbone, but I would like more bitterness. Maybe I'm biased, being a west coaster, but I love the citrus hops more so than these sort of spice flavored hops. There is certainly some citrus flavor in here, but not the blow out ruination type of feel. The malt presence is very impressive, a nice unique sweetness is quite satisfying. Mouthfeel is quite good, and drinkability is fantastic for a 9%er. Defenitely a great choice for some DIPA sessions, but don't drink too many too fast, or you'll end up like that guy in the avatar below me! (your last one was much better shabb, too bad somebody had to gank it.) great beer. Props to Sam and the crew."
"D - I could enjoy one or two but that would be about it. I look forward to having another, highly recommended."
"Very well executed and surprisingly drinkable, however, despite the big profile of the flavors. One is my limit, though."
"Drinkability- Good drinkability, but the beer is 9% and will creep up on you if you're not careful. Two in a night is cutting it a little big unless you really are good with your alcoholism. Fresh is much more deceptive."
"overall this is a fantastic brew but not very sessionable at all"
"Both were approximately the same gold/amber color, which was interesting considering the great difference in malt quantities. The 90 smelled strongly of floral hops. Upon taking a sip I was pleased to find that the taste was similar. It tastes like a big mouthful of delicious hops. This is certainly an extremely hoppy beer but it's incredibly well balanced too. The 9% is well hidden, and tasting the 60 alongside the 90 you wouldn't guess there's such a difference in alcohol content. The 90 tastes just like the 60, just moreso in every good way. A fantastic beer on all counts."
"MF&D- The beer was creamy, medium to full bodied. It coated the mouth well leaving a sweet alcohol warmth behind. Very good beer but definitely one to drink sparingly as one or two would suffice. Good winter brew as two of these would leave you warm enough to walk through the snow in a t-shirt and shorts."
"Relatively luxurious for the size of the hop smack here, outstanding velvety mouthfeel. I dropped the drinkability as the alcohol peppers tend to speak up as it warms a bit. Still an outstanding IPA and a wonderful big ale."
"One of the best IPA's around in my opinion. It's worth the expensive 4 pack to enjoy it, and if you can finish all of them... Well let's just hope you've got a DD. Pours a clear ruby hue, with hops and caramel in the nose. Taste is outstanding- the balance between the hops and malts are dead on. Way to go, Dogfish! Again, what a great IPA, a must-have for any hophead."
"MF&D - Smooth and medium bodied double IPA. Strong alcohol content makes this one a sipper. Very unique, I still don't know what to make of this one, but I definitely want another. I think this brew would work well with a cigar."
"D: Personally, I do not think IPAs are the most drinkable beers, but this one is the exception."
"If drinkability means having fun and savoring each sip, then this rates very highly. But I don't really know what to pair this with, food wise. Maybe some pepper-crusted fish (but I don't love fish) or maybe some pungent cheese (which I generally dislike). That's okay, this beer is best on its own, as its own little course."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"This is certainly at the top of my list of IIPAs. It is an extremely satisfying, well balanced beer that gets better as it warms up. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: As this was the one I forgot about for a year and a half I don't have another, but I wouldn't mind. It's a fascinating maturation, but for true hop fans would probably be a bit of a letdown."
"This poured a hazy orange with a creamy head. It smelled of sweet citrus hops. The flavor was surprisingly mild, with light hops and citrus, and moderate bitterness in the aftertaste. The texture was great - super smooth. Overall this was a very delicious and drinkable beer!"
"My virgin venture into the DIPA world. The color is an amber to golden color with a sticky cap of foam which left considerable lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is raw oily herbal hops. The palate is again very hoppy, flowery and bitter. The big malt character manages to break through the wall of hops to provide some balance. These two giant flavors combine to produce a nice enjoyable beer. The finish is bitter and lingers for a few seconds. It is slick on the palate and the alcohol is detectable but not very much so. I am not a """hop-head""" but was impressed with this brew. Thank you sir, may I have another."
"D- Alcohol is hidden nicely. Very drinkable and dangerous. Bring on the 120!!"
"It poured a thick, cloudy orange and smelled supepr hoppy with a mix of pine and citrus. It was full of body and flavorful. Although it was thick, hoppy, and high in alcohol, it was fairly drinkable. So watch out with these--they'll sneak up on you!"
"Not a bad brew all-around. A revitalizing breath of hop flavor that is great for those who appreciate it and a lesson for those who are learning. A well-balanced brew. I could drink several of these. Well done."
"What a beer! much better out of a tap than a bottle! Its a heavy beer which will weigh on your stomach. strong caramel and hop in the beginning, finishing with some spice, and citrus. Lots of flavor going on here, no one thing stands alone. It is very balanced and has a sweet finish. not overly hoppy, but out of the tap the hops make their presence known."
"An enjoyable drink, but honestly, as a really good IPA fan, just a bit too sweet for me."
"Get a bottle, get a glass, get this beer!"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a goblet. Deep orange almost amber color. A little haze. Maybe a finger of thick rocky head. definitely smell some nice fruity hops and also, a surprise to me, very nice sweet malt aroma. Also the alcohol is more evident as it warms. This smells like a balanced beer. I have to begin with the wonderful malty flavor and alcohol. They combine nicely with the hops. It has a wonderful mouthfeel. Not to thick, very drinkable for an IPA. I'd say the only mark against it, in my opinion is the alcohol level in the smell and taste. One of the best beers I have ever had. Wish it was available here in Kansas or Missouri."
"D: I wish I could have my fridge stocked full of this. Great treat ."
"M/D- Feels quite smooth and refreshing and it lived up to its expectations. This is a very relaxing beer and you dont have to stuggle to put it down. This is now my new fav IPA. As you may i have read in my other reviews i am not an IPA fan by any means. This make me think i could be. A great brew."
"A classic brew and understandably so. A must try for anyone that's into IPA/DIPA's."
"For me, this did live up to the hype."
"It is one to come back too."
"M/D - Great carbonation and very smooth. It does take over your mouth but what else would you expect from a DIPA."
"D: For an imperial IPA, this was very smooth and drinkable. The packaging says this has been voted the #1 IPA, but I have a couple other IPA's I would rank above this one. I do, however, recommend this beer highly to IPA lovers."
"I was so excited to get this and it certainly lives up to the hype - it's a damn good beer. I would buy this frequently if it were available. It's just such a well done DIPA. No complaints here."
"This a vert enjoyable beer and I am mad at myself for waiting so long to give it a shot. My first DFH and I like it."
"D: This DIPA could be consumed pretty quickly because of its smoothness without the big hops bite. I bet this beer would explode if served on cask. A much better offering from DFH than 60 Minute which creates a lot of intrigue for 120."
"Delicious, again balanced - malt and hops, sweet and bitter, caramel and citrus, decent complexity to the hop bill with the various citrusy tastes mixing with pine and a more herbal flavor. Whereas I got mostly caramel on the nose I'm getting more lighter toasted grain flavors here. Lingering bitterness and just a bit of an annoying sweet aftertaste. Body is smooth, pretty full, carbonation quite high. Good stuff, not spectacular, but a great representation of the style. quite drinkable."
"Pours a nice clear copper color with very nice (bubbly) head and good lacing. It has a very large floral (bit of lavender) scent, very aromatic and hoppy. Strong flavor, very hoppy, extremely dry, with just a bit of sulfur and jerky flavor. Goes down very smooth for a DIPA. Excellent beer."
"D - If I had a case of this, I would drink it all night."
"The bottle & draft used to be my favorites for this HUGE beer, but this is a great DIPA."
"D - For 9% it really goes down easy. I could drink a few of these and of course will buy it again. Very good beer. All the little characteristics play off and compliment one another."
"this is not my most revered style of beer, but this is one of the few i have tried that i would choose to drink again on occasion."
"With DIPA's being my favorite style, I must say I haven't enjoyed one as much as this in quite awhile. Balanced and luscious in every way. The floral / citrus hops just fill the air. Gotta enjoy this one on the warmer side (55-60 degrees) to really appreciate the aroma. Lots of sweet crystal malts balance out the orange-grapefruit hop flavor and snappy bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky with a long bitter-sweet finish. Easy drinking for a 9%'er, goes down so smooth and silky. This baby's tough to beat!"
"Dogfish, in my opinion one of the top 3 breweries in the US. 90 minutes it in my top 10 beers to drink. perfectly balanced between hops and malts. Of course the abv does not hurt either. 3 or 4 of these and you are off to a great start. But nothing like their world wide stout at 18%. NOW"
"D-Highly drinkable for me, I love the hoppiness of this beer and the alcohol is not as prevelant as I thought it would be considering the 9% ABV. A great beer."
"This beer pours a nice orange amber color with a tall thick head that laces the glass all the way down. It has a rich piney hoppy aroma with some citris hoppy aroma as well, but mostly hoppy. The taste is excellent for a double IPA. It has a nice roasted malty base with a huge amount of hops layered on top. Nice citrisy and piney hoppy bitterness flavors layered together over the malt makes for a very well made IPA. It has a very crisp yet smooth mouthfeel. It is a very drinkable double IPA and definately worth a try."
"D: I am not a big Imperial IPA fan but this one like those from Stone make me think about reevaluating my wants and likes. It is abit over the top hoppy for me but this is an excellent representive of this style. It reamains a one and out beer for me."
"another strong offering in the great series of ipas from dogfish, this 90 min and the 120 min are not for the faint of heart, very strong, high alc. bitter and crazy on the tongue and kickers in the back, limit yourself to about 2 at a time or the morning may come too quick. very good."
"Overall great IPA"
"Brought to you by Brian and Graham"
"Prost!"
"Overall: A decent albeit very malty East Coast-style DIPA."
"Poured from a growler amber brownish with a slight haze. Very nice floral aroma and taste. Some citrus and caramel flavor. This beer is very drinkable for a DIPA. I finished off 4 pints last night and the last full pint tonight. This beer lives up to its' reputation and is my 2nd favorite DIPA to Hopslam."
"D - Fantastic IPA with a complex hop profile and sturdy malt backbone. Incredibly smooth, sweet and easy to drink, despite the high ABV%. Another great DFH creation!"
"Music enjoyed whilst sampling: STP by Sublime"
"Had this one in the bottle a long time ago, and thought it was good, but not great. Tried it again on tap at the DFH Alehouse in VA and it blew me away. Color is an incredibly deep amber color, almost a straight red, with a nice looking head and a touch of lacing. Dissolved fairly quickly to a more cognac looking syrupiness, but still nice. Nose is fantastic, crazy hops and tons of sweet caramel. Taste is excellent; it's basically a perfect DIPA, with strong hops and malt, and absolutely delicious balance. Sweeter than the Hopslam (which is another of my favorite DIPAs), but it still works. Lots of grapefruit and citrus. Body is thick and full and nearly syrupy. Really a delicious beer, one of my favorites from DFH."
"D - A great IIPA indeed, some might say a classic. Something that I would have on hand but any more than a couple would be overkill."
"D= very potent so watch out as can be dangerously drinkable"
"What a powerful beer. It had a deep amber color and a sticky white head. It tasted of dextrous, sweet malts, strong citrus and pine hops with hints of rich fruit and alcohol. It is definitely more balanced than I had anticipated. It's more powerful than it seems, I could only drink one!"
"Morey's Bottome Line: I've been waiting to try this beer for quite a while, and I must say....I'm definitely not disappointed. If you're into Double IPA's....this one should not be overlooked."
"Golden orange with very good clarity. Slight off white-head with traces of lacing. Aroma is mainly resiny hops (citrus, pine) with some toast malt notes. Flavor of resiny hops blends very nicely into a strong alcohol flavor. Hop flavor is mainly pine and citrus. Some toast malt, sweetness, and fruity notes apparent as well. Firm bitterness kicks in after a couple of seconds, but does not overwhelm. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Fairly long finish of hop biterness and alcohol warmth. Excellent beer. Big and hoppy, yet well balanced and complex."
"Served in a snifter, it had a moderate head, good lacing, pale amber colour, just a slight haze. Aromatic pine nose, relatively sweet on the palate with a characteristic slightly Belgian style finish; not as in-your-face hoppiness as some of the DIPAs."
"This is exactly what an Imperial IPA should be. It has a sweet malty nose, which you'll taste throughout your session. This sweetness contrasts wonderfully with the fine citrus smell of the (Cascade? Chinook? hard to tell) finishing hops. When you take your first sip of this beer, you feel the contrast on your palate, and it feels GOOD! Don't let the OG or ABV fool you; you'll get very little alcohol burn from this. All in all, a wonderful session beer; just make sure that session maxes out at three!"
"This is probably one of the finest IPA's you'll ever put in your mouth. Robust, smooth, citrusy with the fully anticpated explosion of hops. A rich maltiness as well. Clean. Rich. Greatness. Dogfish is known for it's exceptional devotion to quality and taste and this brew fits their commitment to a T. The only disapointment I had with this beer is that it comes in a four-pack. As good as it is....they should market this fine product in an eight pack."
" 90 minute IPA is one of Dogfish's year round beers, and what a beer it is. A deep golden amber pour, with a bright white head and loads and loads of citrusy and floral hops. In fact that's how the beer earned its timely moniker. Most beer is brewed with two or three hop additions; one at the beginning of the boil for bitterness, and a few more additions later on in the cooking process for flavor and aroma. 90 minute uses a Dogfish pioneered technique of adding small amouts of hops continuously through the entire 90 minute boil time. This unorthodox invention reduces the face-puckering bite some IPA's have, but adds an enormous hop presence. Dogfish uses this technique on all of their """minute""" beers 60, 90, and 120, and with all the beers as the time increases so do the hops, alcohol and price tags. Just like people, some beers can't help but be personalities, and 90 minute is a rock star."
"This iipa belongs in the upper echelon. A hop lovers delight. If you can't handle hops, move along, nothing to see here."
"Drinkability: I won't lie, this ain't for the uninitiated. This is a strong, bitter beer that is going for extremity with hops. But it's delicious! I've not yet laid my hands on the 120 Minute IPA, but Lord help me when I do."
"With over 1300 reviews already, what more can one add. The beer is a nice deep orangish amber with a nice full body and rather syrupy pour. There is a bit of a head and it surprisingly hangs around. I was expecting more of your typical barleywine experience and have the head dissipate entirely. Not so here. The smell is excellent, beautiful hoppy esters, pine, grassyness, and some sweet malts in the background. The taste is also very nice. There is a very nice balanced hoppy bite balanced by some peach type sweet malts, some florals, and just a candied sugar base. I knocked this down a little bit on the mouthfeel because there is a bit of a throaty aftertaste and some lingering bitterness that may be a bit much. Overall, this is an excellent double IPA well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Drinkability: My expectation was to not like this. My memory was that it was a lot more syrupy and thick throughout, and there weren't any hops anywhere to be found. That was less than a year ago, so it's probably more me than the beer that's changed. While I still found an unpleasant fullness in the middle, my overall impression is H-O-P-S. The yucky middle fades, too, as the glass drains. It still isn't my favorite IIPA, but I can dig it now."
"Beautiful beer. Extremely harsh hop aromas. It made my eyes water; I have never had anything this hoppy before. There are also some toasted malts, cherry and apple in the background somewhere. The appearence consists of ungodly lacing from the head; absolutely amazing. Color is a clear fizzy copper. The head is a creamy off-white with good retention. The flavor is quite complex with a nice fruity bitter finish. There is an echo of a stronger type of alcohol in their, but I cannot place it. I REALLY want to try the 120 quite badly after this one. Great brew."
"I classify myself as a Hop snob, it is the American IPA I am most familiar with. I am not that big of a fan of most Dog Fish Head beers, however, their IPA's are some of the best. I enjoy the 60 minute, yet I find myself wanting more. I enjoy the 120 minute, but only in small doses. The 90 minute strikes a perfect balance between these two extremes and is certainly one of the best and most drinkable American IPA's available."
"This beer will put you on your ass. I love it, it really makes me savor each and every sip. I love this beer."
"A very good big IPA."
"D - Surprisingly drinkable for a beast of a hop bomb. Doesn't even feel like a """sipper""" - gotta be careful with this one. Overall a very good beer, but certainly not a lot of subtlety here. A little rough around the edges for my taste, although I'm sure that's part of the appeal as well. Good malt/hops balance."
"D: Very good - i can see myself nursing a couple over the course of the evening."
"I cant even imagine what the 120 minute IPA is like."
"D - For being a high ABV beverage it's drinkability is still pretty high to me this goes down very smooth and it's not boozy at all..good"
"I would like to try one of these with the Randall the enamel animal. The infusion of fresh hops might be what this beer needs to push it into the great category."
"Well worth trying. It's quite a good DIPA, but be prepared for lots of hop bitterness. There's no avoiding it."
"DFH 90min IPA left me wanting more!! Deliscious in all aspects."
"Whoo-mama...like I said before, this was my first foray into DFH, and man am I looking forward to a long relationship together. This is the sheet!"
"And being from northing Delaware, I should really take the trip down to Milton, DE as I've heard it's a great place with a warm shoreside atmosphere...and full of crazy in-house experiments to indulge upon."
"Pours a brilliant amber with medium lasting beige head in a snifter. Smell is strong sweet and fruity hops. Flavor is sweet, yet highly hopped and well bittered. Fruity and piney hops in the taste with some hints of alcohol showing but not detracting much. Much sweeter and less hopped than I remember my 1st time having this beer, but then again, that was one of my first experiences with a double IPA and it was quite a shock to my senses. A touch warming in the chest. Now I find this quite drinkable and nice, whereas before it was tasty but too hoppy. A bit syrupy body. Nice double IPA for sure."
"D: Not something you drink in sessions, can be a little much -- even if you are used to the assault of a strong IPA; or one as thickly hopped."
"for a 9% ABV imperial pale ale, it's an incredibly tasty, balanced, and drinkable double IPA. leaning heavily to the english style, it's the best of both worlds in terms of high ABV, and balance of malt and hops."
"mouthfeel is great, perfectly carbonated and just a nice feel as it goes down, I have changed my opinion that DFH is overrated, this may be the best DIPA I have ever had."
" I could drink a lot of these but i'd pay for it."
"aftertaste of hops. Very drinkable however since I'm a long way away from the source it was overpriced."
"D - When I'm actually able to get my hands on these I could imagine myself drinking three at the most, they're easy to drink but will have you lit in no time."
"One of the best IPA's out there. When your at the DogFish Head brew pub, get this through the famous randall machine. This is very good. Vert good hoppy flaver and a nice aroma. By the case this beer is pretty expensive, but when your at home, all you need to drink is one. Very good for after a big dinner."
"This is truly a king amongst the American Double/Imperial IPA market, which Dogfish Head has really spearheaded and put their fingerprints on. A great DIPA indeed, and as they say down in Milton Head: """Feel the burn ... that's the sickness AND the cure!""""
"Drinakability: I could drink this all night. Satisfies the hop-lover in me, but is very well balanced by the bready malt goodness. If you like 60-min, give this one a shot. I'm betting you'll like it even more."
"D: A bit of a toss-up. In terms of the full experience of sniff to swallow, it seemed to lack just a little on the aroma front, but taste and mouthfeel do it justice and save it for a good drink overall."
"A beer this easy to find should not be this good. When tasting with 6 othe IPAs this was the favorite. It has a balance that none of the others possessed. The bottle pours amber with a small head. The hops are apparent in the aroma. The taste has the bitterness I like in an IPA without trying to hit you over the head as many of the strong IPA do. The aftertaste is long and wonderful. I could happily dringk this all day. At least until I was under the table."
"Wow! This is exactly what an IIPA should be. It begins with a sweetness from the malt, this lingers throughout, which I believe helps it deliver the hop flavor brilliantly. I have had some Doubles that were simply overly hopped IPAs, not adding anything else to carry the added hops. This has enough malt to hold up to the hops which I do love so. The hop bitterness is comparable to a spicy meal that doesn't burn you up right away, but rather builds as you partake. The aroma is wonderful, another gripe that I have some Doubles, tons of bitterness, but a lack of aroma. 90 minute is a wonderful balance of hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. WELL DONE!!! This is the bet all-around beer that I have ever had!!!"
"I have to say i will try another dogfish but not the 90 minute ipa again."
"Drinkability is what I've come to expect from Dogfish Head - just a great all-around beer, gorgeous, and perfectly balanced. Huzzah."
"Pours a dark copper color with a decent lace of head with moderate carbonation. Smell is pure hop and bitterness aromas. As what you would expect for a Double IPA. Taste is well...bitter of course and very robust. Mouthfeel is very dry, but still pleasant. Overall this is one the better Double IPA's I've had and very drinkable too."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability - Dogfish Head 60 and 90 Minute are some of my favorite brews. They're not a good all-around, any-time beer, but when I'm in the mood for the hoppiness, I love them."
""""What you have here...""" is a trip and destination in one excellent tulip glass...perhaps a hops airbag unsettles the crash test dummy, but bottle maintenance may exceed the liability of supply...this IPA generates terrible demand."
"Bright and cheery orange/amber color with a thin bone white head. Leaves rings that reminds me where I let the glass sit for a while. Smell is an opened handed smack in the face of hops. Very energizing. Lots of citrus and piny hop aromas made me eager to take a sip. Taste matches the smell. A hop lover's dream. There is a solid malt backbone, but the spotlight is definitely pointed towards the hops. Great mouthfeel - a thicker medium body helps the great flavor to stick around for a while. Definitely one of the best IPAs money can buy."
"Smooth for an IPA with lingering fruitiness and a little hoppy bitterness. I could drink the crap out of this stuff. Very delicious and unique IPA. Not the total overpowering hop bomb I thought it would be. I tried this once before on New Years, but had a few too many to review beer, and I remember it being more of a hop-bomb. One great IPA."
"First time having this particular Dogfish Head. Very impressive all around. Great color, amber-gold with a little bit of burnt orange, and thin but uniform head that stayed through first sip. Smell was a rich heady burst that reminded me of caramel. Flavor was more of that but also tasted raisin and a little bit of sweet apple. Mouthfeel was not overwhelming but very present. Enough to let you know you are drinking a good beer. Alc. Content is almost immediately noticeable. Not sure if 9% is good for me but will find out when I finish my fourth. All in all ... the best beer I have had in a while."
"The beer poured a deep, clear amber into a pint glass with a thin, white head. The aroma was of pungent, piney hops and caramel malt. The taste was an instant hit of hop flavor, with caramel, toffee malt flavors in the background, finishing with a fairly intense hop bitterness and alcoholic warmness - WOW! A high octane beer with high octane flavors - outstanding."
"This was my first experience with a very hoppy beer. What an introduction! Although the finish is understandably bitter, the flavor is very complex. I would describe the undertones as somewhat fruity. Really it's just a delicious beer that any IPA fan should try. Although the beer is medium bodied it still retains a refreshing flavor. This is now one of my favorite beers. Although the higher alcohol content (combined with the easy drinkability) has caught up with me on a few occasions."
"Overall, this is the most balanced of the 3 (60, 90 and 120 min IPAs), and really not what I desire when I think of a DIPA, but definitely a solid beer and a good introductory beer for the style."
"I absolutely loved Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, so I had high hopes for the 90 Minute one... didn't know a half-an-hour can make such a difference! This beer was amazing... so unique for an IPA that it completely took me by surprise... not as bitter as I had anticipated... this beer is more sweet than anything else... pours a beautiful copper / amber color with a nice frothy head... smell is full of esters, hops, caramel, and honey... flavor strongly complements the aroma, with a strong, sweet, caramel flavor dominated by hops... great stuff.... a full-flavored, full-bodied, rich and satisfying beer... hard to detect the hefty 9% ABV behind a great combination of flavors... Dogfish Head brews are great, and this is one of the better ones... Definitely recommended..."
"A real treat is to have this beer on-tap and run through their hop vessel which they affectionately refer to as """Randall the enamel animal""". The ultimate for the diehard hophead and much preferable to the too strong, sticky sweet, syrupy 120 Minute."
"This is a great beer... very strong... at 9%abv it's understandable why they sell it in 4 packs. However, if I were to select this or the 60 min based on FLAVOR, I'd have to choose the 60 min."
"It's a good beer. It's a freaking great beer. It's not the best beer you'll ever have. It's not the best American beer. My theory about why this beer is so hyped: It can play two roles. It can be the nerdy craft beer whose flavor you carefully deconstruct. But it can also serve as an alternative to macrobrews. Instead of having four or five buds, why not have two 90 Minute IPAs? They'll be delicious and you'll still feel that warm, heady pleasantness. Eh?"
"Good."
"drinkability - too much hops for me, A few IPAs I have had are not that hoped out. Great if you like hops."
"Drinkability: I'm drinking it now ain't I? I chose this beer out of all the others I had on hand. Maybe I'll pause in between with a whiskey sour or something, but I'm definitely reaching for another. What the hell? Four packs suck. :P"
"D- Balanced and complex profile, the alcohol is well-masked, this is my favorite non-West coast DIPA and I can drink this all night long, kudos to DFH for great distribution, I look forward to when this comes back to California in the near future!"
"This is a hell of an IPA from those fellows in Deleware."
"For the big hop head out there: this is the one. For those who prefer a lot of character and a dynamic flavor profile: This is not what everyone tells it to be. There is way to much hop, and way to little malt to make this beer truly drinkable. I could only do one every few days."
"Pours a brown/gold that is clear with a sizeable light tan head that doesn't stay around long. Nose is pungent with a perfume like quality that masks any heavy hops that are present. Flavor is sweet with a slight hop edge. Tangy mix to it. Feel is thick and almost syrupy. Slightly drinkable, but overall a bit too sweet and lacking in any unique character."
"D - Great beer. If you get a chance to try it do. Also the 120 is great."
"-GAPit"
"Great beer, my favorite beer from DFH better balance than the 120(too sweet) and more consistent than the 60."
"You'd never know that it's 9.0% because it's so drinkable, even for casual drinkers."
"D - get a case, have two every night. That's my suggestion, but just two."
"D: This one is dangerous. The excellent flavors and aromas, and lack of obvious alcohol presence, sneak up on you pretty fast."
"This is by far my favorite offering by Dogfish and one of the best DIPAs I have ever had the chance to tryand try.and try again. The hops do not overwhelm the mouth with bitterness due to the perfect balancing of the caramel malts. This beer has the perfect taste and feel and after every sip leaves you longing for more."
"All in all, one of my favorite IPAs."
""""Downgraded""" to this beer after trying to have one of the 120 Minute IPA's. It was a lot better in my opinion, and quite drinkable. The color was a little bit darker than a typical IPA, and much hoppier on the nose. The taste was very fresh.. lots of hops and malted barley, with a well-balanced amount of alcohol. This is one that I would definitely recommend."
"Gotta love DFH. I think they're really a great company with a lot of awesome brews out there. Anyway, this 90 min IPA has a lovely honey colour and a great big creamy head. Quite lovely to look at. The smell is interesting; you definitely get the citrus scent but then there's also a whiff of something floral. The taste is nice- it's somehow bitter and tart-fruity, but sweet at the same time. A little bit of that citrus smell comes in as a final bite at the end, which was actually very nice. Fairly carbonated without being too fizzy. The mouthfeel was just alright, nothing to complain about but not particulary wonderful either, smooth but strangely oily (as someone else said earlier). Overall I thought it was great and I would absolutely have it again."
"Another great one from DFH."
"This beer poured a copper color with a big fluffy three-finger head. The smell is sweet with a large presence of floral and citrusy hops. The taste is very sweet with a large amount of citrus up front with some alcohol in the middle and a very lemon-rindy bit of a bite towards the end. The sweetness is really balanced out by the bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little thick with a mid-level of carbonation. I didn't have any difficulty drinking this beer, but I doubt I'd reach for another one right away. Overall, an extremely pleasant beer that I'll have to pick up again in the future."
"Head, you'd best buy a case or two and stash it in your basement- it'll keep."
"D - Pretty good, I could certainly drink one a day, though I'm not sure how many would be safe in one sitting. Wonderful example of the style, recommended."
"As of now it's the best American double IPA's I've ever had."
"Drinkability: A very good beer. Well balanced with a heavy dose of hops and cut a bit by the malt presesnce. Best $3.00 I spent in some time. Wish I had bought more then one. I need to keep a few stocked in the fridge."
"One of my absolute favorites. I drink it all the time. Lots of hops but very smooth and clean for a 9 %. I love what dogfish does with these beers. Can't wait to see what is coming. It is a deep red color but still very clean. Refreshing and can keep drinking them without being fool. In my top 5 IPAs."
"Drinkability: Very bold, well crafted, one of a kind brew. This went down very easy. I am glad I finally found this one."
"Bottling date = 15Jan07. Consumed in a Tripel Karmeliet tulip. Pours a deep cloudy orange/copper with a head that is quick to diminish. Smells rich and malty with nice deep floral hops, I can see an English influence here. Rich nutty malts balanced well with nice hops that transition from floral to citrus. Big bodied, thick, almost oily (not in a bad way), coats the tongue. MMmm. Lingering aftertaste. Warms you up as you drink it due to the 9% ABV. Not a punch in the face that I was hoping, yet very well balanced. Highly Recommended."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark golden amber. Two finger head with nice lacing. Nose is roasted malt with citrus bitterness and alcohol. Taste is citrus bitterness balanced by a hearty, earthy malt presence. The warmth of the alcohol compliments the smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. This is a delicious beer and one of my overall favorites."
"D: This is very well put together beer that displays the abundance of hops but adds enough malt backbone to hold it up but not take away from the aim of the brewer's objective. I would never turn this beer down no matter how many I had before."
"This beer looks perfect. Nice, clear reddish amber with a long-lived, thick, off-white, frothy head that leaves nice lace rings throughout the tasting. Loads of tiny bubbles moving up through the body also add to the appearance. The smell is good with big hops up front - I get citrus and slight floral and herbal. The taste is strongly bitter in the initial flavor with a good strong, slightly sweet malt base to keep the balance. The IF transitions quickly to a bitter, slightly medicinal alcoholic aftertaste that isn't terribly, but I don't think this deserves the exceptionally high marks that this beer typically gets. Again, the mouthfeel is somewhere between average and good for an 2ipa. It is medium to full bodied with a syruppy texture and lively carbonation and a heavy alcoholic finish that sort of coats your tongue. Not unpleasant, but I have definitely had better. Overall, this is tasty and interesting but a little heavy on the alcohol flavor and finish."
"D: A very good and interesting DIPA. Quite a bit different than the style I'm used to which is the west coast version."
"This beer seems stronger than the 9% ABV on the bottle but it is hidden so well, I didn't realize it until it was gone. Not sure how many of these I could drink due to the alcohol, but this was one damn fine beer. I will definitely be having and enjoying this again. I want to try the 120 now!!"
"I think this is a nice and different IPA. It has alot of the qualities of a good IPA, but DFH always pushes the envelope a little with their own spin. Maybe not my favorite IPA, but its a damn good one."
"Arguably the best IPA!"
".... WIlly"
"D = I rate this as a very drinkable beer. I recently read a thread discussing what this category should mean, but I think this beer satisfies any of the definitions. With the high ABV obviously care should be taken on quantity, but honestly if this were exactly what it is but only 3.2, I'd happily drink it all night. Not only does it have a great taste profile such that I would be happy to drink it again on many occasions."
"An excellent Pale Ale."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Poured a orange amber with small head, nice lacing. Smell is of sweet grapefruit, piney hops. In the taste the grapefruit isnt nearly as pronounced as in the smell but still there. Nice piney hop flavor, alcohol finish. Nice thick mouthfeel."
"It pours a nice deep amber hue with a slight touch of orange. Decent head to start with, but it quickly dissipated and left good lacing on my glass. The nose is packed full of hop aroma settling into citrus and pine scent with the malt scent trying to make it through all of that hop scent. Bitter at first, but the malt quickly comes into play balancing out that bitterness. The sweet caramel finish on this is my favorite aspect of the beer. It is just very well balanced and not a tongue/taste bud grenade that will make everything taste like pine cones for the next few hours. Each drink the flavors of those hops keep coming though. Citrus, pine, and grapefruit meld so well with the sweet sticky caramel finish. The mouthfeel as I stated is very sticky and the beer coats your entire mouth very well, and is still so crisp and actually extremely refreshing. I would drink this beer pretty much any chance that I get in pretty much any time of the year."
"d: it's a good thing this beer is rather accessible in my area.. it's a solid offering"
"I also appreciate the drinkability of this IPA, perhaps it is so drinkable because it is so darn tasty. Either way, a trip to Kunda is always worth this beer."
"A damn fine Imperial ipa in my book. Extremely well balanced, with a great, complex overall profile, and mighty drinkable for 9.0 % abv. Well worth seeking out."
"This is probably my favorite IPA. I have a case of it at home and never get sick of drinking it. Its about time I finally rate it. Pours a dark golden color with a foamy head, aroma is hoppy, the flavor is slightly citrusy and a bit hoppy, very balanced overall and a nice dry aftertaste. Excellent stuff."
"Classic DIPA."
"The drinkability of this one is very acceptable. I find that every time I swallow, I feel prompted to take another drink. This double IPA is solid all the way through."
"D - For the amount of hops in here its pretty easy to drink a very good brew"
"d: Not sessionable for me, but there is almost always some in my fridge."
"Hop Heads of the world, your nectar has arrived."
"The 90 minute pours a light amber color with a nice foam head that leaves a little lacing on the side of the glass. It also has a freshness date which is nice. The smell is a balanced hopiness to the nose with citrsy aroma. The flavor is a dominant hop one which is to be expected. You don't even taste the alcohol. I would love to drink a six pack of this one but it would be an expensive night. I would say it is well worth your money to buy this beer. It has a spicyness on the finish, Nice."
"D: I have only tackled one at a time, but I could see myself drinking more than one, a very nice brew."
"Eric"
"Wow, now this is an outstanding beer. I love the balance it has between all of those hops and those sweet malts. Masterfully crafted, big beer that is supremely fit to the style. The style profile says to give thanks to the American west coast brewers for creating this style, so, thanks west coast brewers, but for my money, the best may be coming from Delaware, Thank You Dogfish Head."
"Still not too bad for an Imperial IPA. could use more malt balance."
"Pours a rich deep amber gold color with radient highlights when held to the light. A dense white head rises up and leaves a streaking of fine lace in the inner rim of the glassware. The nose is nearly all of hops, as one might guess, but accentuated by sweet malt as well. The label states that this Imperial IPA features """a single, constant 90-minute hop addition," Hence the name, and """a ridiculous amount of English Two-row Barley.""" This impressive enough, but add to this the fact that this beer is dry hopped in the tanks as well and you clearly have a special beer on your hands. The fresh alpha acids and resins from the hops are evident here, and the nose is blossoming with fresh hoppy goodness. The palate is fresh, herbal, and slightly floral. The hop presence is formidable, of course. Resinous and biting - this beer stops short of being harsh due to the strong malt backbone. The hps remain asservive throughout. I find this beer to be surprisingly balanced - not the absolute hop-bomb you might expect from a beer with, what, 90 IBUs? Mouth feel is thick, juicy and coating. The pronounced hop resins, along with the smooth, nearly cloying malts, make this beer seem almost slippery. Both the sweetness and the hop bitterness linger a long tme on the tongue. Slightly biting from the 9% ABV, but not overly alcoholic in the mouth. In terms of drinkability, this is where the DFH 90-Minute really shines in my view. The incredibly well-crafted Imperial IPA is a joy to consume and not a struggle like some overly-hopped, under-balanced examples can be. This is truly an IPA to be reckoned with. Without a doubt, this is one of the finest, most brilliantly crafted IPAs i've ever had the pleasure to drink. It's strong, yes, but never clumbsy or over-wrought. A true masterpiece in the """Imperial""" beer category. I love Dogfish Head beers and the 90-Minute is precisely why. Truly excellent."
"A good beer from the DFH guys. Too bad I can't get this in Iowa."
"D: Wouldn't drink more than one on a weeknight due to the ABV, but that's fine by me."
"Drinkability- A great sipping beer, almost too big a beer for multiple in one sitting, best enjoyed as a sipper so as to fully get its flavor."
"Pours a nice attractive orange/amber color with a decent head on it. Aroma is a sweet, hoppy, fruity blend that is very inviting. Flavor is very much of the same. Nicely balanced IPA that hides its alcohol content very well. Mouthfeel is great. Drinkability is high for a beer of 9% abv. Session this( 294 calories) and you will be a fat hunk of shit in no time"
"D: Wonderfully drinkable. Well crafted indeed. Highly recommended to hop heads or even a first time craft beer drinker. I could see this being a gate way beer."
"MF/D: The body is medium for the style, even thin at times. Bitter, palate shattering feel to it- alcohol and carbonation make it a little rough at times."
"The drinkability of this is terrific, it goes down great, very nice touch. I could and would drink this all night"
"D - I'm really appreciating this beer. It's meeting my expectations and I'll definitely buy this again. Shhh! Don't tell my husband I reviewed this bottle without him!"
"A brisk pour into a tulip glass with 2 fingers of head. Deep clear copper color. A very strong citrusy floral hop smell - very powerful, but pleasant. A strong hoppy flavor - the hops come through more than the malt. Very complex with just the perfect amount of sweetness and a dry slightly warming alcoholic aftertaste. This is one of my favorites for the style."
"D - This one goes down pretty easy given how strong it is."
"Sumation: delicious..."
"Full/thick mouthfeel that's cloying and sticky. Goes down pretty easy,not a beer i could even imagine drinking all night."
"D. This is a strong alcohol with little payoff from the beer itself and the brewers skill. I plan to spread this 4 pack over the next few years to see if aging does work."
"Overall, this is a great beer. I recommend it for strong-flavored cuisine like mediterranean food or kebabs."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable for a dipa, and not as rough on the palate as some, making it easy to consume."
"very drinkable for such an intense beer, the most balanced dipa i have had to date, i've drank this beer many times, and it never gets old."
"D: Awesomely balanced beer. Being a higher ABV it is not hot and the hops do not over power the beer."
"Paid 10.99 for a 4 pack."
"D: This beer is Yummy drink it.. I can't wait to try the 120 minute. Bravo to Dogfish Head!"
"drinkability- this one will slow you down, but it has incredible balance and nuance. i could drink this stuff daily."
"This beer tastes very balanced. It starts off with a nice hop bite but mellows quickly to slight pine and malt tastes. Leaves with a little alcohol kick. It is medium body with good carbonation, strike that, great carbonation. A lot of brewers could learn a lot about that from this brew. I could drink many of these and end up in a stupor if I wasn't careful and showed moderation."
"D: Astonishing. This beer as a drinkability that is out of this world when poured through the Randall. Already an outstanding beer in its own right, this method of serving only increases the freshness and hop flavors already present."
"Pours a golden orange with a big white head. Smells of citrus hops. Taste is very malty to begin with, a biscuity flavor. Then the hops. Very well balanced, floral. You can definitely taste the dry hopping here. The carbonation levels are just right. One of the best double IPAs."
"Other thoughts: Beats the hell out of their 60 minute IPA, when it comes to flavor, IMO."
"Cheers"
"This beer is proof that Dogfish Head is one of the greatest breweries in the United States."
"2nd bottle: 10/07 bottling date, same review applies. 12/07"
"Poured a deep amber with almost a hint of rose. Unremarkable head. Citrus and pine aromas mingle with a rich sweetness. First sip is rewarded with thick chunk of malt in the mouth as the strong pine and citrus flavors emerge and complement. Alcohol elements are present as well and blend nicely with the sweetness of the malt. A testament to balance in a DIPA. Incredibly drinkable."
"Very easy to sip, very refreshing - medium bodied, moderate carbonation and overall wonderful."
"Spicy on the tip of the tongue huge hop bitterness, well balanced. Relatively thin body, juicy clean bitter finish."
"Tastes sweet and hoppy. Pine, citrus and a warming alcohol that is well hidden but starts coming through as the beer warms. Another winner from Dog Fish Head."
"D- This is a sipper to be sure. I am digging the taste because of how different it is from cookie cutter DIPAs but it is thick and definitely coats your mouth. Not the most drinkable DIPA in the world but very solid."
"D- This is decent, but by no means spectacular. This is my sixth bottle of this stuff and I seem to enjoy it a little less every time. A quality beverage, but is not my favorite for the style."
"This is most definitely an exceptional sipping/smelling beer... needs to be looked at, swirled a bit, and savored. I wouldn't want to chug this. A snifter, red wine glass or a nice looking goblet works well to serve this."
"D: The alcohol body is huge but the hop profile is revolutionary. This is, to me, one of the early entrants in the American IPA market (double, single or triple even). It is a gold standard and worth a sip, especially if it is fresh."
"Drinkability- This brew is big and tasty and goes down really really easy for having 9% abv. Ive yet to have the 120 minute IPA but I know that I like the 90 minute much more than the 60 minute. Great beer, highly recommend."
"I finished every last one and was feeling good after. These hit you hard but they are very drinkable. A great IPA"
"A very exceptional beer. This is one more reason why Dogfish Head is starting to become one of my favorite breweries."
"D: I'd say this has at least as much drinkability as the 60minute. Easy to drink and welcoming another one. 3 would probably be a great stopping point."
"This stuff warms you up good. I'll definitely keep this one in mind in the middle of January while I'm freezing my ass off."
"Drinkability- Great beer that left a wonderful hoppy aftertaste and not too overpowering in the hops or alcohol."
"D: Perfectly balanced double IPA. Very smooth and noticeably boozy."
"Yo mug tap me another."
"Medium burnt orange, light amber color , tight white head which dwindled down through the sitting but did leave behind blotchy yet exceptional lacing. Heravy pine and citrus typical of the style with a hint of smoked peet and alchohol. Medium to thick body on the tongue. Fooled me! Was expecting an overly hopped one sided taste but was pleased with the hop/ malt balance- sweet- yet ballsy. This baby packs a punch from start to finish with a scotch like """belly warming """ effect and actually left a resin on the lips. Drink in moderation ,preferably on an Oct. evening- sweatshirt optional."
"At first touch, I taste a sweet candy almost buttery in fact. A rush of hops follows and lingers as I still try and pick out other tastes. This beer produces quite a clean, crisp taste yet melts in your mouth. This beer sends out quite a message, """Not for the average beer guy.""" But subtlies lay here that make this one of the better IPA's I've had."
"I loved almost everything about this beer except the tast. There are just too much hops. I guess that is the style, but I prefer the malty side of beer to the hoppy side. So as DIPA's go this is a very good one, just not my glass of beer."
"D: Medium. Watch out for this one, it's big. But I'll definately come back for more."
"I tasted the beer and was immediately shocked at how much hops are packed into this awesome IPA! Huge hop flavor, smooth finish and excellent mouthfeel. I definitely get an oak taste and raisin hints along with the evident hops and barley. A really good beer with a lot of flavor."
"12 oz. in what always seems an overpriced 4-pack (key word--seems) to kick off the Penn State Brew Fest with brother Jer and friend Ryan...deep orange body that supports a strong,firm inch-plus head--perfectly intimidating...yeasty aromas from Pavlovian hops work intermittently with peach hints to put runners at first and second..now, the meat of the order: the 9% is the slightest bit noticeable, as the tongue is attacked by a full-bodied, dry carbonation...was the beer even there? Sip one is crisp and pleasant, not quite measurable, an aggressive taste with a short aftertaste....fruity as much as it is hoppy--by the third sip, settles into a truly soft(!?!) IPA...hints of a barleywine, but beautifully balanced--all these DFH's were right after all... #1 on a short but growing list...this beer only leaves one with the question, is 90 IBUs possible? Unreal experience...bring on the Brew Fest!"
"I still prefer its more drinkable little brother if I am going to have more than one, but there is no denying this is a masterful brew."
"D: The malts are strong. I would've liked to see less malt and more hops. I wouldn't classify this as a session beer. Overall, not bad."
"Poured a delicious-looking orange-gold color with a thick layer of sticky tan head that had very nice lacing all the way down the glass. The smell was very hoppy with some fruity scents. I'm not sure what types of hops they use, and I'm sure it's a mix, but whatever it is, it's perfectly balanced; a good amount of kick but not overpoweringly so. The taste is much like the smell, with some extra bite in the mouth from the hops. The bitter hop flavor persists throughout the taste but goes through varying levels of intensity; an interesting ride. The aftertaste is smooth yet complex, nippy yet comforting. Every time I put the glass down, I want to pick it up again. All in all, a great beer."
"Drinkability: As stated above, one of my favorites. While not an IPA fan, this beer is near perfect. The 9% might limit how many you can have in a sitting, but this beer has no downside to it whatsoever. Near perfection here."
"Pours a deep amber color with burnt sienna hues in the light. A good inch of cream colored head fades nicely leaving nice lacing. Smells are of sweet malt and barley, citrus, pine, and grass with some alcohol burn. Taste is very similar, sweet barley and malt up front before a plethora of citrus and grassy tones finishes off with a good sticky adherence to the palate. Very nicely balanced and medium in body with good carbonation. A highly drinkable IPA loaded with flavor and balance, though with the abv so high, it's not sessionable."
"I have enjoyed this one for a few years and pick up a 4-pack ($9.99) 4-5 times a year. If you are looking to enjoy a complex beer and need to relax, look no further. The beer should be nursed and savored, a great choice to start off the night."
"Notes: I had this on tap a week-and-a-half ago at Tria and it was not nearly as hoppy, it more smooth, the alcohol less pronounced, the head greater, more lasting; the bottle seems to bring out the hops and the alcohol. Either way, a great Imperial IPA, and as many have said, one of the Kings of the style."
"Drinkability: Definitely not your """session""" beer, though it drinks smooth and isn't to much of a fight like some IPA's that display only the bitterness. About one will set you well for a while."
"D- too sweet of an ipa for my taste. i prefer to go without that sugar sweetness that this ale possesses. the aroma of this beer is truly remarkable and i expected it to carry over into the taste. i realize however that there are many different versions of american ipa and this one was undoubtedly made with integrity."
"Served to me a clean dark orange/amber with a creamy head that goes away slowly. Smells of exquisite floral hops, grapefruit, some malt and a hint of fig. Tastes like freshly cut piney hops, citrusy rind with no sign of the alcohol. Right before the punch of hops seems over the top the malt quickly balances it out in perfect fashion. Finishes deliciously, hoppy dry and bitter with excellent carbonation. Drinks as smooth as a babys bottom. An excellent choice and a must try."
"A light golden to amber color with a half inch off white colored head forming on top. Surprisingly a strong malt fragrance at first scent, followed by a combination citrus, pine and grassy fragrances at the end. The taste starts out with the malt coming right out, and then blending itself to a strong citrus flavor, hints of a grassy flavor as well. A very well balanced flavor. A medium bodied feel, that never loses that texture all the way across the palate. This is one of the best IPA's I have ever had, and incredibly well balanced flavor and strong aroma, I longing for another glass."
"I love this beer. It's fairly bitter, but again, it's very well balanced. It's nice to sip and enjoy in the summertime. Not as drinkable as the 60 Minute, just because of the bitterness and high alcohol content. But still, drinkability is high and it's a phenomenal beer."
"The beer pours a deep amber, forming a very thin head, with light lacing. The aroma is fantastic! A mix of hops, caramel, and alcohol. The taste is just like the aroma, consisting of hops, followed by some dark fruit flavors, caramel, and finishing with a light noticeable alcohol presence. Very rich and complex. The mouthfeel is very thick and smooth. If it were'nt for the high abv., this would be a great sessionable ale due to its extremely delicious flavor. Overall, I was very impressed with this brew. I expected an overpowering hopped up brew, but instead got a very rich flavorfull well-balanced brew. I would highly recommend trying this one!"
"Pours a dark copper tone with an incredibly thick head with great retention. Lacing stays with the entire way down. Smell of coffee and citrus blend is present. Taste is definately of coffee with a touch of caramel and a slight citrus hop backing that doesn't last like I expected. Taste resorts back to malt and doesn't leave a bitter after thought I was hoping. Mouthfeel is where this one doesn't quite do it for me. Thick syrup-like mouthfeel that doesn't make this one the easiest drinker. As it warms, the alcohol taste really starts to break through. Drink this one nice and cold, don't let it sit around too much, and you'll really enjoy this DIPA."
"Deep amber color that has a reddish hue. Head that sticks around and incredible lacing, it trails down the glass and remains when the glass is empty. The smell is more malt than hops and hints at Sam Adams Triple Bock.(My 4 cases just recently ended) The taste is more of hops, but the syrupy sweetness of malt is still there. You can taste the alcohol, too. The mouthfeel is rich and substantial, fresh baked bread. Drinkability is good, but not for chores. Especially with power tools. Buy often!"
"D - Given many of the taste and aroma profiles, I think this beer takes a hit on drinkability. It's so sweet and alcoholic that it almost comes across as a barley wine. Nonetheless, this is a good beer that I recommend. I certainly preferred the 60 Minute IPA."
"D: A little bit of alcohol is noticeable but nothing that hinders the drinking. I could drink this all day, but at 9% abv I better not."
"Presented a clear, light brown brew with slight orange coloring. Aroma is a unique combination of floral hops, dense sweetness and perhaps some coffee. Excellent hop/malt balance. One of the best of any DIPA I have tried. Fresh floral, grassy hop flavors jump out. Big earthy hop flavor fully backed with caramel sweet malt. Some nutty, roasted malts in the finish. Slightly fruity. Excellent feel, oily, smooth, velvety, but ends slightly dry. Somewhat heavy, flavorful, sipping style. A must try."
"Personal Rating: 65%"
"Creamy, sweet and chewy mouthfeel. Overall well balanced and a good job hiding the high alcohol makes it very drinkable for the style."
"D - As you can tell by the gushing review, this is one of my go-to IPAs; a beer that's spicy enough to satisfy the hophead yet creamy enough to placate the malt man in us all. The drinkability only suffers in that its masked ABV prevents any sessionability."
"The flavor is a lot like the smell - at first it's just hops hammering your taste buds, then it backs off really nicely and you can taste the malt and the citrus undertones. At the end, it finishes by letting you know this is a 9% abv brew, and then it's clean. Because of the high alcohol content and the heavy hops, this isn't my idea of a session beer, but it's a great companion to a good meal or to enjoy by itself. If you want better drinkability, go with the 60 minute. This one is for the true IPA lovers - and it's a really great American craft beer."
"Drinkability: The bitterness of this one makes this less drinkable in my opinion, but some people like that. I'm more of a malt fan, but for those that like really up front, punch-you-in-the-mouth beers, this is for you. I actually think this is more balanced than the more widely known 60 Minute IPA, since there is some malt evident. I had to drink this one slowly, but it's the best of the IPA style, in my opinion..."
"Pours a clean copper color with a nice off white head. Aromas that are floral, and sweet hints of grapefruit. In the taste, a smooth bitter sweetness, with a touch of alcohol in the end. It is a bit sticky/ sweet, with a big bitter after taste. Very easy to drink. A great double/ imperial IPA, although I do miss the 750 ml bottles."
"At this point, this is the best double IPA I have come across. Crisp, refreshing and very drinkable for double IPA at 9%. The smell is nice and hoppy and the taste is crisp and clean especially for a double IPA. The mouth feel is intense and it hits all of your tastebuds. Another enjoyable experience from Dogfish Head."
"Nice big head with great retention. A beautiful copper color. Nice fragrance, but lighter than I expected. Fist taste is nice and hoppy, with a remarkably smooth finish. Almost a sweet finish or undertone to it. Nice alcohol taste to it, but the beer packs enough of a kick to it to restrict the drinkability just a bit."
"Overall: as somebody who is not a hophead and rarely reaches for an IPA, this was a very pleasant surprise. Much in the same way that I think the best barleywines have a nice bitter finish to lend some balance, this XIPA has enough malty sweetness to stand up to the IBU's. I would definitely grab another one of these (which is a good thing since I bought a four-pack)."
"Drinkability - nice beer but due to having 9.0 a.b.v. might not be a session beer."
"Being a west-coastie, I've been looking forward to this for a long time. The only other DFH I've been lucky enough to get my hands on was Raison D'etre at Stone's outfit in Escondido. It is now poured, and sitting before me, foamy, relentless head perched maginficently upon it's orange/copper shoulders. Smell is alive, sweet creme brulee and brilliant piney hops. An enviable balance is acheived in the flavor, and though there are no surprises that deviate from what's suggested by the nose, it's wonderful. The mouthfeel isn't luxurious, it's luxury itself, with a deeply satisfng warm finish. All this, and it manages to be incredibly refreshing. I think you could safely say that I enjoyed the hell out of this beer, and will jealously seek it out whenever I find myself back east."
"This is a great summer BBQ or porch-sitting beer, in my opinion."
"Drinkability is fantastic. I'd love another. Especially having had this beer fresh on tap at the DFH brewpub, I know how good this beer can taste fresh, and this bottled incarnation is damn near perfect. The hops are a little stale by the end, and the maltiness never diminishes, but it's a solid drink that never lets up in delicious intensity or fullness. The high alcohol content could be a turnoff, but the taste is so rich and balanced that there should be no problems slowly sipping and enjoying a few of these."
"d_ with the alcohol this is dangerous, very delicious, especially for a hophead like myself"
"One of my two favorite everyday IPAs (the other being Flying Dog Double Dog). Pours a great orange-straw color, with a nice, sturdy head. Great, luscious pineapple aroma. The flavor is full of bittersweet pineapple hops and just enough malt to hold it together. Like all DFH beers, it has a wonderfully smooth, creamy mouthfeel, despite some generous carbonation. It does produce a little harshness at the back o the throat, but the finish is clean and hoppy."
"P.S. Can't wait to try this one on Monday."
"Sampled on tap at The Spot in Bethel. Nice copper color fairly clear no head but I'll blame that on a bad pour, but hey I did get a really full pint. This is a beer you can smell even when it is just sitting on the table in front of you, a lot of citrus hops come through in the nose. The taste mimics the smell mouth puckering bitterness from the citrus hops but the beer is sweet enough that the bitterness doesn't overwhelm. Also the alcohol is very well hidden by the sharp bitterness I had to remind myself that this was a 9% beer to keep from drinking it too fast. Mouthfeel is alright nothing spectacular and the drinkability is actually not bad because the alcohol is so well hidden and this beer is so well balanced."
"12oz bottle with bottled on date of 4/11/07. Gorgeous dark orange color with a perfect sticky head and lace. Smell is intense with pine and alcohol. Malt nose is also intense with a scotch ale-like(wee heavy), fresh wort aroma. Flavor is powerful and complex. Give the glass a swirl and allow it to warm and the various flavors include: fresh malty wort, golden raisins, dried apricot, canned peach, caramel, sweet roll, sweet sticky citrus candy, fresh hop oil, pine, mint, alcohol phenols and various fruity esters and overtones. Wow, this is an IPA? Has more of an old ale or barlywine-like complexity. Or more like a belgian ale made with domestic yeast. I have sampled different stages of age and on-tap and this beer always tastes great. The 9%abv is most likely the reason it travels and ages so well. Would pair perfectly with an apricot glazed meat or fish dish. The hops and alcohol would cut through the sweetness while also matching the flavors."
"D: This beer is strange, I thought it tasted a lot more like a barleywine than a 2IPA. Try it for yourself, it is definitely an intriguing brew."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a clear amber with a 1.5 cm off white head (mostly diminishing). Moderately malty and slightly hoppy aroma with a tinge of citrus. The initial flavor is mostly sweet with the citrus and hoppiness kicking in on the back end. Creamy texture with light carbonation. I just saw that this beer is 294 calories per bottle, wow, otherwise I wish I could drink this every day."
"Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA pours a slightly hazy orange gold with a one inch head that only sticks around for a minute. The aroma is fresh hops, and not much else. Bitter citrus, herbal and fruity hop aroma. The taste is a biter punch of hops, more citrus, grapefruity and slightly piney. The sweetness of the malt balances it well, however. Although hops are certainly the feature, sweet pale malt flavor really does a good job of making this one very drinkable. The alcohol is noticeable and slightly medicinal in the aftertaste, but not over the top for 9%."
"While I still favor a hoppier IPA, I can't help but be impressed and admire this expertly crafted brew. So strong it can be too much of a good thing quickly, but I'm a sucker for its rich complexity."
"It's good, but like many expensive IPAs its kinda strong. If it were more hoppy than alcoholic then I might be more satisfied. Looks like its time for the 120 min IPA."
"Drinkability: I'd recommend a 7-day 90 Minute Imperial IPA Diet. Go ahead, blow your mind once a day for the next week. That is, If you want all the squishy parts of your brain to leak out my ears."
""
"Overall: An interesting approach to the IIPA with pronounced malt elements and alcohol bite...not terribly bitter but high quality piney hops make it an interesting choice for hop-heads."
"This in my book is the best tasting IPA ever. Not just doubles or imperials but any IPA. 'Nough said."
"Amazing beer. A very full hops presence, verging on overwhelming, but not quite. Looks great, tastes great, the only problem I have with the beer is that for 9% the alcohol is a lot more pronounced than I would expect. Other than that it is a great beer."
"Overall, I think it's a great discovery and a complex brew. I like it a lot, and I'll definately be getting some more."
"D - Wow! This really is good. It is the first DIPA I've had that wasn't very bitter at all. My wife, who is not a fan of bitter, actually liked it, too."
"Overall, a very drinkable beer....except at 9% I couldn't drink too many. I'm happy I've got more of these to sample."
"This can be a tough one if you're not ready for it, but it grows on you, and it has become a special favorite. The color is a lovely red-gold, without a lot of head unless you pour it hard. The aroma is very potent, with an almost tart-apple/tangerine cross that is new to me. BIG hops, and big kick, but these are not as up-front if it is cold. I've had a few four-packs and will definitely drink it again, but if I'm having a few, the 60-minute is a smoother, mellower IPA."
"D: This is a drinkable DIPA that has more malt that the west coast DIPA but none the less it is good in its own right"
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This is one damn good beer. That is not an opinion, this is not open for discussion. Very nice full mouthfeel, creamy and smooth...they don't get much better than this. I'll definitely be buying this one again, would like to see how the bottles compare, would also like to try this brew's sister IPAs-60, 75, and 120. I think that I'll prolly have this growler finished before the night is done."
"D - This would be a much better brew if there was a little less malt"
"Poured from the bottle, great lace, small head, not much retention. Hazy, golden brown colour, thick and viscous. Massize amounts of hops in the aroma...thick, piney and fruity. This is one potent beer. First sip has tonnes of hops as expected, but backed by a very sweet malt profile. Warming alcohol. Finishes a bit bitter. Smooth, malty and bitter...just does a dance on your palate. Nice beer."
"I had high hopes for this beer and was a bit dissapointed by it as I loved the 60 minute ipa, perhaps a little too much hop charter. A beer that needs to be tried at least once, but not so much after that, though I hope to try another double ipa so as to be able to compare the two. There's always a next time I suppose..."
"Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable. I'm not a huge hop-head, but I could drink a few of these and not get overwhelmed."
"The hops bite up front, followed by a caramel malt that goes wonderfully together. Followed up wtih a slight alcohol taste that is not bad at all. Leaves the tongue and the back of the mouth a little tingly, but goes away quickly. Sessionable, but it will come back to bite you at 9%. Overall a winner from DFH"
"beautiful dark orange/copper color with about an inch of creamy, white head. nose is so nice... piney, with a little grapefruit. alcohol is present and sweetness abounds... much maltier than a west coast iipa... like sweet, juicy nectar... this is a comfort beer for me... thanks dogfish"
"Enjoy!"
"D-This is a great 2XIPA. Very well balanced unlike alot of attempts at the style. This might be my second best one I have tried besides the wonderful Yulesmith. I will be buying this again."
"Medium bodied with nice carbonation and a bit cloying. Not a fan of Dogfish Head IPAs. Too sweet and not enough hops IMO."
"D - i enjoyed it, but realizing i'm not really a hop head"
"D- an easy drinking DIPA with a 9% ABV? Thats right as so so well done."
"How lucky I am to have such access to Dogfish Head, and even more lucky that 90 Minute IPA is as easy to find as it is. A definite winner."
"I love my hops, and this monster does not disappoint in that department. Good balance, but definitely a sipping beer."
"Thanks for the bottle demcorhip!"
"By the time you finish this beer you will feel like you have consumed a very rich decadent dessert. I wouldn't say you should drink lots of these at one time cause the ABV is 9% but I'm gona have another right now."
"D - Meh. Execution seems fine, I just don't like the results. Overly bitter, I can't really find a taste beyond that."
"Didn't realize it was possible for a beer with this much body and hop to finish as smoothly and cleanly as this. One of the best beers I've ever had. Strong notes of honey and grapefruit, with plenty of hoppy pine notes. Mouthfeel especially is exceptional."
"IMO, much better on tap than in the bottle. I really enjoyed this, and I can't say I am a huge fan of the bottled version. A very pleasant surprise."
"Poured a gorgeous orange/gold color with a nice fluffy white head that laced beautifully throughout the long slender glass. The head lasted to the bottom and had sparkly bubbles of carbonation that lasted until the end as well. Smelled of sharp pine/grass with some citrus tones. Tasted awesome. Fresh hop, bitter, some citrus and a punch of nutty and grassness to it. Goes down smooth... this is one easy drinking 9% brew. I can't get enough of this stuff. I could drink these all day, or atleast until I fall on my face. Awesome brew."
"What are you waiting for? Go get some now!"
"Overall a great beer that some prefer fresh. IMO it's ages just fine, taking on an almost barley wine character."
"This may be the best American made beer of all time. IPA but with a touch of sweetness. High alcohol but very good taste. Everything about this beer is exceptional. If you see this on tap this should be your number one priority. Just remember that you can't drink very many of these and still drive home."
"Drinkability is also good.... I had two back to back... and the 9%ABV didn't bother me. Maybe this isn't a beginner's beer, but if you like hops....then go for it.... I would highly recommend Dogfish Head 90 min. IPA."
"Overall a great example of a Imperial/Double IPA. Compares favorably to others I have had, like Dreadnaught."
"Very easy to drink, just beware the 9% abv."
"Scary how drinkable this ale is."
"Pours a light copper color with an average off-white head. The smell is of oranges and grapefruit, sweet and twangy. A nice mellow grapefruit flavor, some resin and pine hints. No fresh grassy hop flavors. The hops are followed by a creamy caramel type flavor, which mellows out the hops and makes this very drinkable, though a bit on the sweet side. The feel is moderate and creamy, not overly carbonated. I am a bit torn on the drinkability. The first beer drinks way easy but the sweetness will catch up and limited me to maybe 2 in a session."
"Pours a beautiful head that retains very well. The color is a light gold copper. Lacing is sticky and presents a beautiful looking beer. The smell presents a hop presence that is strong. The taste just bursts with grapefruity hoppiness that's balanced very well. The mouthfeel is a little overcarbonated, just not enough to make the experience any the worse. Overall this seems to be a very good dry hopped Imperial IPA and would be my session beer of choice if I could get it fresh. It's so powerful with great hoppy taste it's just very very good."
"This beer is so drinkable even with the higher alcohol content. Start me on a Friday night and I'd try to drink straight through to Sunday night."
"A coppered amber in color the beer poured a 1/4""" head that dissipated rather quickly. The nose was filled with citrus hops (grapefruit, orange, pineapple) and balancing caramel malt. In the mouth the beer had great density and a wonderfully rich texture. The huge amount of hops was very well-balanced in the palate with sweet hops though kept enough of a dry bitterness to get you know it was all Double IPA. Even at 9% this is very drinkable. Yum."
"Cheers"
"This beer pours a very clear amber-orange with moderate head that doesn't stick around too long. The aroma is amazing. It is very complex like no other beer I have had before. The taste is equally complex. They managed to balance the hops and the malt for this style of brew that often is overbearing with hops that don't complement the malt. Excellent brew that I highly recommend!"
"Give me a Stone Ruination or a Victory Hop Wallop anyday over this over-priced beer."
"Poors a nice amber coloe with just a finger of head that barely clings to the glass. Smells quite malty, with less hops then i would expect, but still a realy apealing scent. Taste starts off sweet with some hop flavor, and goes into a lot more hops with some bite, mostly citrusy and bitter twords the end. This is very drinkable for 9%, and quite enjoyable. Im very happy i opted for the 4 pack."
"A good beer, no doubt, but I found it a little underwhelming for a double IPA. There was a big malt profile that reminded me of Southern Tier's Big Red (imperial red) in that is was a rich fruit-like taste, but without much in the way of discernible flavors. Citrus edge to nose. The hops are most of a nice compliment to the malt with a juicy citrus flavor. Worth a try, unless you love double IPAs like Ruination and nothing else."
"Overall, a very good beer. It would be a regular in my fridge if it didn't cost so much money."
"Drinkability - what are the odds that I would bring a growler of this to Dark Lord Day '07 with plans to crack it open Saturday night and then never get the chance? I didn't think the FFF party would end so soon, but it did. I figured there'd be some major after-party set up, but there wasn't. I found my way to a room at the Hampton on the second floor for a spontaneous beer tasting with absolutely no available table space for a friggin 12 ounce bottle, much less a growler. The exhausted owner of said room who put up with us until midnight was a friggin' saint, BTW - who was that guy? *Anyway*, I probably brought too much to share. Two other growlers and and 3 or 4 bombers hit the tables and this was to be my big finale, but circumstances fizzled it. So here I am, typing up the world's longest drinkability segment of the review, drinking this wonderfully delicious brew, planning my revenge for next year - I should bring 3 or 4 growlers of this alone and just push it out all day, that'll teach ya's. Rock on, 90."
"Edit: in subsequent tastings I have picked up more alcohol than I prefer and have edited the taste down .5 as a result."
"D: felt the alcohol about 2/3 through. This is an incredibly enjoyable drink, I would only last through a few of them. One of my favorites of all styles."
"Overall: The 90 Minute IPA is a very tasty beer . It meets all the standards to be a great IPA altough having tasted the 60 Minute & the 120 Minute I would say the 60 is the best ballanced and all around drinkable beer, the 120 being very tasty/sweet/ & very floral where as the 90 just being avarage. Worth the buy if you never had it"
"The downside to this brew is for the cost I typically choose other brews. Otherwise this is a tasty brew"
"Overall... a great beer to enjoy one... maybe two a night... but anymore than that would be a problem on a number of levels."
"Overall, I poured this in a chalice/tulip glass which is worthy for this brew. Temp was out of fridge ~ 40degrees; as it warmed more carmel flavors became prominent on the sweet end. Almost has a barleywine taste. Nice brew worth drinking over again."
"D- This is a great DIPA and one of my favorite offerings from DFH. Its sweeter than I expected but I'm not complaining."
"Hop aroma is nice, but on par with a regular IPA. I want more hoppy goodness in the nose. Despite that it does smell great. The first taste is big piney hops, much more present than in the nose. Followed by a malt sweetness that wont quit. Man this is a fine DIPA, I could stand for a bit more hops and a little less sweetness. But this is only a minor criticism as this beer does taste excellent. A slightly syrupy mouthfeel but extremely (but not overly) carbonated. Very good drinkability."
"Bottled on 11-25-05. Poured into a tulip; cloudy reddish orange color with a slight head that goes away fast leaving some lacing and sticking all over the sides of the glass. Smell is sweet and floral with a little bit of pine in there as well. A raisin like sweetness hits the tongue first followed by a very subdued hop bitterness - I'm guessing the 18 months or so of aging has mellowed this brew. Mouthfeel is nice - substantive & the carbonation is well done. This is very tasty - I could easily drink a few of these in a night."
"Also I should note here that this beer is expensive. This did not affect the ratings above."
"D: Great - put back all 4 over the course of an evening dinner party. Dogfish just became available here in GA, and I look forward to many more taste tests - especially on tap at the WONDERFUL brick store pub."
"great IPA overall"
"Cheers."
"D- Good beer, but not my taste on a regular basis. I have enjoyed this beer @ the brewpub, but that was thru Randall and unfortunely I do not own one. I guess this beer is in the upper tier of DIPAs and now I know why."
"Believe the hype. This brew is fantastic."
"D- Good, but at 9% ABV, I wouldn't have many of these."
"To be completly honest it is one of the best beers ive ever drank."
"Overall: This beer is a mainstay in my fridge, certainly the DIPA i drink the most and everytime it is fantastic. If you haven't tried this one yet and you even think you might like IPA's, TRY THIS."
"2 Thumbs up on this ale!! A """Must Try""" if you haven't already!"
"This is a great brew for hop junkies. Full-flavored but balanced enough to be drinkable. This is actually my first Dogfish Head and I'm starting to understand the hype."
"randallized version march 2008-wow, i love the 90 but this is better in every way. randallizing this beer skews it from a malt/sweet leaning dipa towards perfect balance. head and lacing improved. huge, fresh hoppy nose, more fresh hop presence in taste. more lemony and resiny. just phenomenal via the randall."
"Received in a trade from geexploitation. An excellent beer in my opinion. When pouring, I thought it looked a little lite and pale. But after settling in the glass, had the familiar orange look that most IPAs carry. The smell is great. Lots of hops, but not overbearing on the nose. Taste was incredibly smooth for the amount of hops and alcohol. I have heard people say this beer was too sweet, and I thought it was a little overrated the first time i had it on tap at the Stone 10th fest. But after a long day of work and class, a clean palate, and a hunger for a hoppy delight, this hit the spot perfectly. I will venture to say that this is the most balanced, and best tasting IPA I have ever tried. Fantastic. I can't wait to pop the 120 that i received in the same trade."
"This was really an exceptional beer from start to finish. I can't say enough about it. Absolutely remarkable drinkability and balance for a double IPA, although the hop-heads out there like myself will surely get their fix as well. This is simply the best I've had in this style to date. Cheers!"
"I had to try this beer to see what the hype was about, and in my opinion it is definitely worthy of it. This is a home run in my book."
"I never knew a beer could be 9%ABV and be this drinkable. This brew is dangerously drinkable and delicious! Perfectly balanced, which I highly respect, as Dogfish head seems to realize a lot of flavor is a good thing, but blance is key in a good beer."
"D- probably too over-the-top for my tastes as a regular or multi-bottle choice, but definitely worth the try."
"D: at 9% you couldnt or maybe shouldnt drink a bunch in a row, that said you might be able to just on taste alone. Many people say they pick up the alcohol alot, my other drink is scotch neat, so i may be slightly under appreciative of this aspect. Very enjoyable"
"It's a beautiful deep orange with reddish hues. Nice amounts of carbonation and a good, sturdy head that didn't seem to go away. I'm sure the smell was improved slightly as well as the floral aromas and hops were presented appropriately. Again, I could taste the alcohol nearly as well as everything else offered in this brew. Good use of some sweet citrus and floral flavors make this one chewy. Huge hops as well. The mouthfeel is nice and balanced and the bite goes away from the alcohol that I could taste initially. I could probably drink a couple of these max but even still this beer was better after another tasting. I'd love to find this on-tap, hopefully soon. I'm sure that would bring the taste up a mark. A darn good DIPA. This and the Seeing Double from Foothills have both been recent favorites in this style."
"Pours a nice copper color with one finger of dense white foam that dissipates and leaves no lacing. Aroma is very strong with pine and citrus hops and sweet bread and alcohol. Taste is sugary sweet malts with pine and citrus hops. Not as hoppy as you would expect. Very full body beer without getting too syrupy. Alcohol is well masked. Beer is slightly too sweet to drink in any quantity, but it's a nice occasional treat beer."
"Pours a light gold amber color with a fluffy, off-white head with nice sticky lacing. Smell is of floral, grapefruit, citrus, and piney hops. Taste is of nice citrus (grapefruit to be exact) and pine hops. This is followed by a nice bit of maltiness that is quickly replaced by a pleasant hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is a bit oily and is medium to full bodied. Drinkability is good as this beer hides its alcohol quite well with an excellent hop profile that, while bold, isn't as overpowering as expected. Overall a great brew."
"Drinkability: This is one of my favorite DIPAs, I could sit down with a few of these on any night. Usually have a four-pack sitting in my fridge most of the year."
"Unlike other high abv beers I've tried, the alcohol taste does not hit you hard, it is ameliorated by complexity of all the other flavors. Although, at 9% ABV, not one that you want to drink too many of in one sitting."
"This beer pours a nice orangish color with a nice big fluffy white head. Looks good with its clear color and constant carbonation bubbles. The aromas are of sweet grapefruit and strong floral aromas. Maybe some diacytl. There also seems to be a bit of a paper flavor and lots of alcohol as it warms. The flavor balances it out rather nicely. The malt flavor comes through with a caramel hint and and a sort of pineapple alcohol blend. The mouth feel starts with some sharp carbonation but warms up in your mouth. Turns silky smooth. but then dries out in the end. Leaves a cloying residue in your mouth though. rather odd. All together it is one heck of a beer."
"Not something you'd want alot of, as 9% abv will make for an interesting time quite promptly. That said, short of the local statutes and/or your personal feelings on drunkenness, theres nothing to keep you from downing quite a few of these. Sits well on the stomach, tastes fantastic on the palate. What more can one ask for?"
"the beer is definitely drinkable, but the sweetness is a real turn off, its almost like a maibock feel."
"I would have to say I was disappointed with this. Not sure if I had a bunk bottle, but this really wasn't what I expected. AV Hop Ottin or Bell's Two Hearted seem much hoppier than this."
"Drinkability: This is a whopper of a brew disguised as a session beer. It's very well balanced, so you're not feeling overwhelmed on the palate, nor does it seem to fill out the corners of your stomach like some other Double IPAs (I'm thinking of Weyerbacher's Double Simcoe and FFF Dreadnaught here). Drink. Savor. Rinse. Repeat. Do so with caution."
"If Three Floyd's Dreadnaught was the IPA that popped my IPA-cherry, then Dogfish Head 90 minute was the one that got away...and one I'll never forget. Except it didn't get away. Ok - forget that analogy. It's a fabulous IPA and I won't besmirch it anymore with my rambling about it. I'm not typically an IPA fan, but I love this beer. It pours out with a reddish-brownish-golden color, a nice foamy bubbling head. It smells just so complex - fruits and flowers and bitter hops and sweet hops, all rolled into one. The taste is just as complex as the smell - it starts out with the taste of hops but then complexes and you get the other tones as you swallow slowly and let it savor. The aftertaste isn't bitter or pungent or anything that you can find with IPAs. Fabulous. I'd be hard pressed to choose between this and 3F Dreadnaught - they are both exceptional IPAs."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and non-cloying. The label states that this beer is 9% but it's nowhere to be found. This is a highly sessionable beer that I would not get tired of drinking. I could see myself buying this regularly."
"D: It would be hard to drink more than one of these, which is as it should be."
"The clear amber color and thick head invite at least a sample of this high-gravity brew. Aroma is strongly hoppy and inviting. Taste is good and hoppy, with a strong bite and a little bitterness. Zingy and smooth, it goes down the pipe nicely. Recommended to anyone who likes hoppy high-gravity beers."
"12 oz bottle scored for 8$ a four-pack. I've had this before but never reviewed. The color is dark orange-brown with a white head. The taste is slightly resinous but really balanced very nicely with the malts. The aftertaste is definitely """hot""" as you can """feel the burn""". A very good DIPA and even better through the randall."
"D: good but not fantastic in my opinion. I like my DIPA more hopped, this is on the sweeter side of most DIPA."
"D- I couldn't taste the high alcohol content at all- if I didn't know any better this could easily be a session beer"
"Bottom line: A nectar of the gods! I couldn't recommend it more!"
"Great job Sam! Go Mules! Cheers!"
"Drinkability - Let this one warm before you taste. It really allows the beer to become better balanced. I can drink this one a lot more than it's big brother the 120."
"That being said, this is a very nice beer, with a considerable hop presence. I get a good amount of citrus on the palate, mostly orange flavor I think. I don't know quite what it is, and I'll gladly concede this is probably just a matter of taste, but there's always something in the malt finish that I just don't quite like about this beer. For me it makes it difficult to drink very much (probably a good thing), and is something that I find becomes increasingly noticeable as I go along. Nevertheless, this is a very good beer, even if these days it's just not quite my cup of tea."
"flimsy appearance -- pale orange with a meager head. looks thin. the smell surprised me. pine hops and wet burnt wood. interesting enough, but i wouldn't say that it's a pleasing smell. the taste just doesn't do it for me. i don't like the combination of the spicy malts with the pine hops and the sweetness of the beer. it's got a saison quality to it, in that it combines sweet fruitiness with spicy elements. there is the distinct flavor of pennies. the wet burnt wood aromas manifest in the taste, and just throw things out of whack. but then again, that's just my opinion, and looking at the reviews this beer gets, i'll just take my place in the minority and leave it at that."
"notes: definitely got what i expected out of a double IPA and then some. aggressive and bold. a real treat for hoplovers."
"A medium-slightly dark amber with a little haze and a thin head. The smell is so wonderfully hopped, I think I could get as much enjoyment out of just smelling this one as drinking it. The heavy hops are not just in nose, but carry nicely into the flavor. You can occasionally taste the alcohol, which I guess is to be expected at 9% ABV. The aftertaste still embaces the hops and lets the experience continue. A medium body and medium-light carbonation. I love Dogfish Head's IPA's and the 90 minute fits right in where it belongs."
"D: This is a very drinkable beer for the amount of alcohol that it presents. A very clean DIPA that is well balanced. Sit back and enjoy over time."
"120 next?"
"The famed dogfish head IPA, my first time trying it. Pours an amber golden brown color with a frothy cloudy head. smells great, hops, sugar, malt all engaged the nose. Tastes like no other IPA, VERY well balanced, the hops are present of course but so it a nice maltiness, not overly powerful like some IPA's. Tounge has a slight burn from the high ABV, but again not overly powerful. Overall an amazing beer, shame it is 11 bucks for a 4 pack."
"I must say, this is the first thing from DFH that I have had that I didn't enjoy. Thanks to Ding for allowing me the chance to taste the 90min. Even though I didn't care for it, I always like the opportunity to try a new beer!"
"Pours clear golden yellow with one finger of white foam and nice lace. Smells of pine hop, brown sugar & cinnamon, toasty biscuit malt. The flavor becomes quite sweet as the beer warms, developing chewy rounded citrus notes and plenty of earthy pine. Thick and syrupy body is well carbonated and appropriate for sipping."
"12oz bottle. Poured into a 22oz glass lead to a 2 inch+ head. Great orange color and fluffy fluffy white head. Floral hops came out to blow up all over this beer. The smell filled the room with a sweet hoppy smell. Taste is really sweet with a gentle bitterness that cleans the mouth after the awesome sweet bombardment. Freaking fantastic beer. Im really pleased with it and Im not a hop head, more of a malt monger and I think this brew finds a happy place that will please both sides of the equation."
"Pours a brownish, tangerine color with a minimal head that quickly becomes a nice lacing of tightly packed belgian style bubbles. Smells of hops and oranges. Not quite as bold on the nose as I anticipated. Taste is where this one gets its marks. Piney hops and a biting citrus flavor. Sour grapefruit and some orange. Good mouthfeel and very drinkable. As good a DIPA as the 60 min. is a good IPA. Dogfish head as good as always."
"This is one great double IPA. I have never had a beer that simply explodes in your mouth. The mouth feel is outstanding. Sweet, and then you get slamed with the hops around the mouth. This beer simply gets better once you get further into the glass. Makes me truly appreciate the 120 minute, of which I gave a very pool rating because of my lack of understanding on how good the beer is."
"Tastes much mellower than the 120 Min, very smooth and easy to drink. I think a bit of apricot taste is present, not alot of hop bitterness. A very well balanced beer. Yet again, another WELL DONE beer from DFH."
""
"I had been looking forward to trying this for quite some time and finally found it in my area and I'm so glad I did. I would gladly have more of this, though the price of a four pack was just a bit high."
"Bold and delicious; I really like this."
"M/D  A little sticky because of the intense flavor, finish is not that smooth and crisp but I am nitpicking. This is a great beer. $10 for a four pack is a bit much but its a nice treat."
"D: Too boozy, high alcohol flavor. Too high for only a 9 percent beer. Not that bad though."
"Overall, this is nice upfront yet it leaves a lot to be desired in body and mouthfeel beyond the initial tase."
"After drinking this beer I think its's safe to say that IPA's have taken over as my favorite style of beer. The appearance is a nice, clear amber/orange color with about an inch of foam at the top. The smell is nice, very aromatic hops and citrusy blend, just what you'd expect from an IPA. The taste is brilliant; perfect hop bombardment with just the right amount of balancing crisp citrus flavor to finish with. Mouthfeel is very good and drinkability is even better. It's definitely a great beer."
"D - this beer gets a lot better as it warms, become less sweet and more complex. but, just like its big brother, the 120 minute, i find this to be far too sugary. is it bitter? sure, but i can't taste that sort of bitterness anymore. overall, a good beer that looses points to its extreme flavors. i guess if i want more ballanced, less """experimental""" IPAs, i shouldn't drink DFH."
"RERATE: OK, so it would appear my last bottle was a bit lightstruck. This one (a member of the same 4-pack) has a rich floral and citrus hop aroma with a slight background of malt. The flavor is absolutely gorgeously balanced, with hops up front, malt in the back, and hops hanging off the bumper."
"The ale pours an auburn yellow with a scant head and very little lacing. Sweet aroma of figs & fruit, taste is a blast of sweet rich malt, alcohol and a sting of hops on the swallow. Heavy bodied and sustaining, a good example of liquid bread and seems appropriate for lent. A good strong ale to relax with."
"Pours a nice yellow with an orange hue. Thin head, with decent retention and lacing. Smell is of sweet fruit,with a hint of spice,pine,and carmel. Body is on the thick side, and carbionated. Taste is an almost perfect balance of malt, and hops. Sweet up front, with a piney finish. This is the real deal!"
"If the 90 min. is this good I can't wait for others to start trickling in, so, hopefully, this will be the first in a long line of Dogfish Head coming the Georgia way."
"Quite possibly the most complete beer on the planet...especially if you're a hophead like myself. It also may be the most consistent beer I've ever tasted- Dogfish does it again and again every time I taste this nectar of the beer gods. No need or desire to sample the 120 minute, this is the real deal right here."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an oversized wine glass. Color is a vibrant yellow orange with some carbonation. A small head quickly retreated leaving a patchy head leaving almost no lace. Smell is a fruity hop blast with alcohol ethers intensifying the over all smell. Taste is fuit blend, really seems to be tropical like in nature. PIney hops are there too, along with the alcohol. Full yet dry mouthfeel. You have to stay with these once you start, the palate is crushed. The 90 minute is a strong beer best suited for a bottle or two at a time."
"App - 4.5, Smell - 4.0, Taste - 4.5, Mouth - 4.0, Drink - 4.5"
"Body is medium/full to full, overall very good after all this time, but I think it is one IPA I prefer fresh."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Something about this beer seems to have a bite to it. It's a very good beer and I could drink a few. But, I think there's two or three DIPAs out there that I'd rather have. Yulesmith, Dreadnaught, and Ruination to point them out. Overall, very good, but I've had better in this class."
"D - The drinkability is ridiculous. I will have to buy a 4-pack of this because I am wishing I didn't buy only a single bottle. I love DIPA's. I love Dogfish. This is one of the best beers I've had to date."
"the color of this beer is an autumn yellow w/a hint of brown... the smell isn't over powering- in fact the smell is a suprising calm hoppy smell.... with a 90 min. i expected more of a hit you in the face type of aroma... the taste has a bit of an after taste to it and a touch of alcohol feel to the mouth... all in all a good drinking beer in small quanities"
"Oh man this isn't only drinkable...it's dangerous."
"You get a sense of the alcohol, but the beverage is quite drinkable. Nicely done."
"T & M - Very flavorful with nice lacing on the glass . This brew is much more enjoyable than the 120 . It was very good . This will be in my fridge again ."
"Poured from the bottle into a Dogfish Head bulbed pint glass. Decent sized head that was lasting and left good lacing. Smell was hops, hops, and more hops! Taste was more of the same with a good malt balance and a unique spiciness. Hopse were present in every sensory aspect. The mouthfeel was the only setback. The beer left a slight abrasive feel on the palate, but nothing overshadowing the other wonderful aspects of this beer. Not something I will drink every day, but I'll enjoy it when I do."
"Drinkability: Definitely one of the best IPAs in my opinion, complex, different phases, nice and hoppy but it has a lot of other things going, leaves me feeling clean."
"Bottle acquired via trade with Hogtown Harry. Pours a perfect amber hue. Smell is more of malts than hops which surprised me. For an imperial IPA, the taste is way more balanced than expected. Hops/bitterness were quite subdued relatively speaking. Very creamy mouthfeel. Malt flavours I'm picking up include tobacco, which dries out the finish. Drinkability is quite high for the style. A very well done brew."
"D: Excellent brew. Very smooth and yet so powerful. Lots of flavor and very enjoyable. A good session beer despite its 9%abv."
" At 9% ABV, this brew expresses almost flawless balance between malt and hops. It is an incredible Imperial IPA, and is one of the best that I have tried to this day."
"cheers!"
"The taste is difficult to nail down...all I can say for sure is that this beer is fucking tasty. Some citrus, plenty o' hops, and barley. Mouthfeel is juicy and crisp, with a great hoppy bite on the end. Definately refreshing, could use a minor adjustment of the carbonation level though...keyword is minor. What can I really say about the drinkability? It's very palatable, has lots of complexity, and I'll definately be having this imperial IPA again very soon."
"Overall: This is quite the experience. I'm a CDN so these beers don't make it up to the Great White North unless we bring em back ourselves. I can't say I've ever had anything like this. The sweet malty backbone with the insane hop profile makes this one of the more memorable beers I've ever had."
"Took the bottle out of the fridge, opened it and poured it in my favorite glass, so this one was cold. Golden amber in color with a white head. Nothing impressive in the head retention department. Seemed to smell the malt first before the hops, which surprised me. Also detected a bit of a citrus smell. Very well balanced for a double. At first I thought it was a little malty, but with additional sips I alternated between hoppy and malty and back to hoppy, so for me that's a good sign of a balanced beer. A little piney on the back of the tongue, but that's what I expect in an IPA. Medium/full body."
"Cheers2Beers"
"on tap at sunset grill in boston. pors light auburn and you can definitly smell the hop presence. looks tasty and smells juicy. definitly hop loaded, not as alcohol tasting as other double ipa's i've had. overall real smooth. almost creamy. definitly a great beer. left me wanting a few more but alas. there are 100 beers on tap so others ust be tried."
"I found it to be very drinkable."
"Drink-Ability: A very great beer with tons of hop taste and a very drinkable beer. Ad this one to your list!"
"Nicely bitter and intesely complex hops in the taste, long dry finish. However, the excess alcohol is not well integrated and comes across as sweet and hot in the mouth. I definitely prefer the 60 minute's crisp dry aromatic hop attack, not sure why one would choose the 90 unless you want to get wasted fast..."
"Notes: I ended up liking this. The sweetness and candied presence is a turn off but the beer is balanced and the quality is evident. More or less its just not for me."
"The first time I had this it was my first attempt at an IPA. Now that I have had a few, this needed a new evaluation."
"Every sip feels very thick on the tongue and goes down very creamy. You would never guess 9% until you finish. I am not a hophead but this is one of the most exceptional IPA's I have ever had. I look forward to trying the other DFH IPA's soon."
"This beer is so great on so many levels. The beer is a bright orange ale with a foamy, white head. The nose if very hoppy, but also sweet smelling. The first taste can be overwhelming if you don't know what to expect. This beer has a great balance between a great amount of hops and a great amount of malt. There is a special mouthfeel that is neither dry nor wet. It is just a heavily drinkable beer that should be feared."
"I am not sure what to think of this, the bottle traveled half the world, so this might have altered it's properties, I don't know, but I am not convinced of the superiority of this beer."
"This beer is outrageous! It pours a solid gold in color with a moderate head. I am NOT a hop head and was a bit wary of this brew for that reason. However, the hop aroma is round and full, very floral and a bit citrus. The brew is sweet and finely balanced, the sweetness to this beer is almost fruity. The fact that it is nine percent is the only drawback because I could pound this beer over and over. It is a knockout!"
"Pours a dark copper with an off white lace ring and some sticky lace pools. Huge fruit aromas... bright tropical fruits, dried pineapple, apples, taffy, and raisons. Nice complexities in the taste with notes of caramel, dried fruits, apple cider, pear, and plum. Big hop flavors that are mostly bitter and black pepper characters. Much of the hops carry over into the finish and is accompanied by some acidic notes. Full body and a viscous mouthfeel that coats nicely and cloys slightly. This is really good stuff my friends, you must try!"
"Beautiful amber color and bright white head that gives way to spots of head on top of beer. Slow-rising bubbles, but carbonation is there. Fresh citrusy hop smell and what seems to me to be a crystal malt smell. Wasn't expecting as sweet of a taste out of this as what I got. Kind of wanted more of a hoppy bitterness but was very impressed with the overall taste. Mouthfeel was also different as it wasn't drying at all but seemed to wet my mouth like water without being watery. Very surprising and impressive. Drinkability for me is excellent as well and consider myself lucky to be living in the land of DFH distribution."
"Pours a perfectly clear dark honey color with a fine bubbled short head that is white to offwhite. The smell is a very nice hop/malt combo. There is a piney/grapefruity hop smell that is slightly subsumed by the malt. The taste is malty and grainy up front with a honeyish aftertaste and malt underlying it all. Some roastiness in the background, and a warm and brandyish finish. Complex- bounces back and forth between malt, alcohol and hops. Utterly delicious, a masterpiece of flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly viscous. Low carbonation on draft is very nice for developing flavors. Really amazing drinkability, very smooth and easy to drink with a great palate that holds your interest. Top notch."
"D - It's very thick and full of alcohol. I couldn't drink a bunch in one sitting just because how filling and how much alcohol. It's almost too much taste to drink a lot of."
"Pour with an ample off white head which leaves some lace on the glass.Scents include a mix of malt sugar and grapefruit. The flavor is a perfect balance of hoppy bitterness and malty sweetness. 9%alcohol is not evident in the flavor but it will hit you pretty hard which is why drinkability is a bit lower. This is my favorite beer, one which never disappoints me. It is the best DIPA I've tasted.(Upon further reflection, Pliny and Hopslam, I find my score for this beer to be a bit too high, but it's still pretty damn good). Drink this beer fresh to get a good shot of hops, don't let it age for any length of time."
"Drinking one of these is a good idea. I'll be letting the rest of this four pack sit for a while to see what some age does for it."
"If you can find this, drink up!"
"All around this is an exceptional IPA, definately my personal favorite for Craft Brews."
"This is a great DIPA, I can definately see myself picking up a case if I can find it around here. High ABV, so don't session this like you do an IPA, but enjoy it while you're grilling or something and you'll be one happy Beer Advocate."
"NOTES: An excellent beer! It's the smoothness that won me over. You know going in about the strength, and you come out on the other end surprised with it's smoothness. It's like you have just been seduced. And that is wonderful. Highly recommended."
"All in all a great great brew, but in my opinion not any better than or worth the price hike of the DFH 60 minute IPA."
"Drinkability is good, personaly I think it is a great beer but would only like one or two. Just enough to get my hop fix."
"Very enjoyable to drink but because of the amount of taste, hops, and alcohol in this beer 1 is usually the limit."
"The mouthfeel is full and chewy, and this beer is a bit heavy, so drinkability is somewhat limited. Still a first class DIPA all the way."
"pours a medium amber color with a two finger head with very good lacing. very sweet fruity coffee smell. taste is sweet toffee, coffee malt with some citrus and big hop finish. medium mouthfeel with a cloying syrupy feel on the palate. its not the type of beer i like but i would buy it for a good change of pace beer."
"A great beer, and definitely should try this if you never had. It's not overly complex and quite a nice sipping beer and a nice winter warmer with its high and well hidden abv."
"Thanks for sending this one my way MuenchenerKindl."
"Pours a fairly clear copper color with a very nice two finger head with good lacing. Aroma is of citrus and floral hops. Taste is great. A nice level of malty sweetness to go along with a ton of hops with some grapefruit definitely noted. Mouthfeel is very good and despite the 9% this is a very drinkable brew. A great beer, wish it was available closer to home for me."
"Drinkibility: This is a great beer and I'm not a fan of double IPA's in general. I have and would again drink multiples of these. It is 9% ABV though, so don't go overboard."
"Drinkability: A wonderful, wonderful DIPA. I can see, from this, why so many tout the """minute""" IPA line from DH. Just a wollop of hoppiness and well-balanced malt sweetness. This is my first DH beer, but with the potential CA distribution plans on the horizon, it hopefully won't be my last."
"Poured into a pint glass, i quickly noticed the thick foam atop the pour. The carbonation moved slowly through the fermented english two row. Quite reminisent of a snow fall. One waft of this beer quickly assured me of what i was getting into. Hops, hops and more hops. Every sip wowed me. I will warn you though, it does have a heavy mouthfeel. One or two of these and i would call it quits however, this is an excellent pick on a good IPA."
"Poured beer from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear copper color with a two finger bubbly head that leaves bits of lacing. The smell is of hops, slightly fruity and a strong alcohol burn... like turpentine. The taste is initially sweet, with a hoppy finish and alcohol aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lots of creamy carbonation. Overall, this beer is drinkable but at 9% I wouldn't get too carried away."
"Pours a beautiful clear, amber with a 1 finger head that stayed around for a while, and laced up the whole glass. Smell is very nice, hoppy, but subtle, a nice malty backround can be smelled, with a bit of a sugary tone. Taste was very nice. Could not tell this was a 9abv at all. Hops up front and in back, but much more then that. There is a spiceness and smoothness about this that makes this very nicely balanced. I could see this catching up with me quick if I wasn't careful. This is an excellent drink, by far a great brew and will be picking up more every chance I get."
"This beer poured a clear copper color with a decent head  nice lacing. The smell is definitely hoppy with a slight note of sweetness. The taste is bitter from hops but is well balanced with a noticeable malt flavor. There is a sweetness that helps make this quite delicious. The mouthfeel is very full and well suited for this beer. I think this is a wonderful IPA, that just might change the way I think about the style  highly drinkable!"
"This is a pretty smooth beer that leaves a slight oily coating in your mouth. Pretty dang drinkable for a DIPA, but I was a little disappointed. I expect a lot more from this $4 bottle. In my opinion it doesn't even measure up to my current DIPA favorite."
"The pour into my La Moneuse tulip raises a solid, creamy two finger off-white head over a translucent, tawny orange-copper body. The head falls slowly to a thick glass ring that leaves sticky lacing. Still impressive, considering the ABV. The nose is nutty, sweet, citrusy, and just a little piney. Also some candied fruits. Not nearly as intense as most DIPAs I've had, but it shows promise. The taste is immediately hoppy in a nutty, rich, grassy sort of combination, which then combines almost immediately with the strong, caramel-candied malt backbone. Alcohol is absent, unless the sips are too large or too close together. Very well balanced. The body is very thick, but with moderate carbonation. The best DIPA I know of, in a style I don't often venture into."
"Smells of some fruitiness: peaches, pear. Also some tangy citrus notes with moderate hop bitterness. Tastes bitter up front with a nice tropical fruitiness. Some mango, lemon, and pear, followed by herbal/floral notes from the hops. Finishes earthy and with a grapefruit pith flavor. Medium-bodied, very smooth with light but refreshing carbonation."
"Now if I can only score some Raison D'Extra :)"
"Amber/copper body with almost no head. Smells hoppy and caramel-malty. Hops and alcohol stand out in the flavor, though there is a strong caramel malt presence. Medium in body. Very tasty and surprisingly drinkable considering the abv and ibus. If there's a better IPA than the 60 minute, this is it (I know this one's imperial, but still.)"
"Dexcellent, I would have this again and again, the alcohol does sneak up on you toward the end so watch out."
"Overall: I got this at O'Brien's. It is the only place on the west coast to get DogFish head stuff right now. It is great. I would buy it all the time, if I could."
"An orange/copper colored beer with a slight haze. Has a nice creamy off white head with a little bit of lace. The aroma is very hoppy to meet you. Sorry I just couldn't resist. Big piney hop notes up front in the aroma. With a light sweet toffee candy malt note in the background. The alcohol prescence hits twice. First at the begining of the taste. Which is quickly followed by a light sweet malt note down the middle of your tongue. Then the hops roar thru the back of your tongue and throat. Followed by the second alcohol note on the finish."
"I put the first 11oz of this brew, bottled almost 9 months ago, into an oversized wine glass. It poured a clear copper color with a nice, frothy head and good retention. The aroma consisted of a floral, hoppy smell with a hint of banana, maybe, but nothing real significant that stood out to me. The first taste was great - a rich, caramel taste that morphed into a pleasantly bitter finish, with enough punch but no where close to being overpowering. I really didn't notice the 9% alcohol while drinking it (although I did a little later). It was very well-balanced, had a good aftertaste, and overall was very delicious. In addition, is was smooth and creamy and perfectly carbonated, and went down surprisingly easy. This was simply a great drinking experience - a fine, fine brew."
"D: I love this beer...but one usually puts me to sleep. I think it's the hops."
"Hmmmm...yummy."
"One of the first Double IPAs, I've ever had, it stills seems to be the dictionary definition of what one is. There are better, there's tons worse - but this since this was my starting point and characterizes the style well - I often use this for the jump off. The hops in this are huge. West Coast huge. The flavor, though, is less pine and citrus than those out here. It far more raisin and candied fruit. I like this more than the 60 because I like the bigness and how well it's balanced. Please come back to California."
"D - I would happily drink a 4 pack with no hesitation."
"This is, to be cliche, the king of DIPAs. If you want to make a friend, buy me a 4-pack."
"Notes: I'm not sure how old this bottle was. The """packaged in""" notch said October or November (it was between the 10 & 11) but there's no year indicated at all. I can't remember when I bought this 4-pack; it's not entirely impossible that this bottle was from a 2004 batch. Regardless, it's definitely been aged at least a year, possibly two, and I think that aging helped to mellow the hops and make for a more balanced DIPA. . . . I've had this on tap in the past, and my recollection is that it was hoppier off the keg, doubly so off of Randall the Enamel Animal when I got it at the Blind Tiger a few years back. I'd like to buy a current vintage and drink it right away to see if the hops would be more pronounced in both the nose and the taste."
"Overall I really like it. I can really taste the alcohol hiding behind the hops, this seems to tickle the nose. A very nice IPA."
"Purchased at local liquor store and poured into tulip glass. The head is creamy off white not fluffy, but creamy. It dissipates at a decent pace and leaves thin lacing. The body is a toasty, orange, amber, red. Smells of subtle malt sweetness balanced with hop aromatics. The piney aromatics of the hops are the showcase in this beer, but they in no way are sharp or aggressive. If any thing they sit much further back than the hoppy aggressiveness of most double IPAs. The hops smell of mild pine, grass, some grapefruit and, citrus. There are also some sweet fruity ester qualities manifested from the malt, which to me seems not so common in Double IPA, not that its not pleasing. There also seems to be some coffee and raison in there, possibly from the use of toasted malt. The flavor is much the same, there is some bitterness from hops, but nothing that is really going to knock your socks off like some IPA. The bitterness is well balanced with esters of sweet malt. There are variations in this beer that most IPA or imperial IPAs dont have. This is a very tolerable IPA easy to drink. If you want an IPA that will kick the shit out of you with bitterness (in that good way) this is not the IPA for you, but this is totally a drinkable double IPA to have around, especially in contrast to something as wonderfully hoppy as Dreadnought. This is damn tasty, easy going double IPA if you like your hops wild, its not quite that, but its damn tasty all the same."
"One of the best IPA's I've tried."
"Slainte!"
"Very different IPA compared to the dozen I've tried lately. I'm very surprised this scored a """best IPA""" award from Esquire, although its uniqueness can't be denied."
"All told, a very enjoyable beer, and I think one more suited to being enjoyed by itself rather than paired with any particular food."
"Overall - First beer I've ever had served on the Hop Infuser. Don't let the relatively light appearance fool you, this is a great tasting serious beer."
"A good IPA. Has some good and pronounced flavors. A very good and surprisingly smooth mouthfeel is also a nice asset of this brew. Recommended."
"Very nice IPA"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability suffer a bit only because of the intenseness of the hops and the alcohol. Don't get me wrong, the alcohol is well hidden, but there is no question that you are drinking a powerful beer. 2 of these in a sitting would suffice."
"A fantastic """meal""" beer. I can't stress enough how much better an already good beer is when blasted through a tube of hops. A IPA lovers dream."
"With all the hype surrounding this beer, I couldn't wait to try it. Pours a perfectly clear amber color with a minimal head. The smell hits you with a strong scent of hops as well as some alcohol and citrus sweetness. The taste is intense. Malt up front and then a huge wave of alcohol and hops. A bitter finish but not overly so due to some nice balancing from the malts. Smooth. Mouthfeel is slick with a medium body. A little carbonation lightens it up a bit. The drinkability is better than I expected. The first time I had one, I thought it was a bit overpowering. When I had one a week later, it went down much easier. My taste buds must have adjusted and I'm glad. Overall, this beer is a good choice if you are in the mood for a big, hoppy beer."
"This stuff is intense! First time I had it was in Summer 2005 on a farm in Paxton, Ma. It was a surreal experience to say the least. Immediately upon opening the bottle, I knew I was in for a hop bombardment. On top of being hoppy and delicious, its got an amazingly full and smooth taste for a 9% ABV brew, perfect to just chill back and sip on. Highly recommended."
"Sicne I only had a small sample of the Randalized 90 minute, it's hard to say that there is much of a difference. However, I do feel that the Randal process provided a very flowery aroma to the hops, more than enhancing the flavor. Overall, it's a well crafted DIPA. Strong and spicey/floral aroma and a lip smacking hop flavor. Go for it."
"This was bottled on 5/8/06. Served in a snifter, the 90 Minute IPA pours a nice copper color, with an off-white head. It mainly smells like floral, grassy and citric (grapefruit) hops. The taste is excellent, it starts out as floral and citric hops, the in the middle there's a caramel/brown sugar like sweetness, then ends with a hoppy bitterness. It's a well balanced brew. The mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, slick and creamy. You can notice the alcohol in this beer, but it's not overpowering. Drinkability is very good, it's smooth even with the high ABV. This is definitely a sipping beer. I think this is a very good beer, it's one of the best I've had in a while."
"Despite a high ABV, this is insanely drinkable...I long for more on tap, but I hope it doesn't make the bottled version unappealing at some point. I doubt it, but man, this tapped version was hot."
"Kinda rainy outside today and I was lookin for somethin that wasnt dark but still packs a bit of a punch, decided to try this one. Poured a beautiful clear golden hue with a 1 inch head that went to fine lacing after a couple minutes. A strong whiff of citrus and resiny hops. I love this smell, I could smell it all day long. Taste is nice resiny hops, followed by a strong burst of caramel malts that drown out the bitterness a bit which is great. Wow thats good. Mouthfeel starts thick and ends dry, which I am enjoying, makes me want more. Drinkability is high, this is a great beer and could be enjoyed as a treat or as a session. This is a must try if you like IPA's, great beer."
"Bottled on February 10, 2006, this beer aged very well. Poured into a pint glass, the beer is clear and exhibits a golden-amber hue. I was surprised to find that head development was minimal, but found visible carbonation to be low. The 90 Minute IPA has a prominent hoppy nose with a slight acetone and alcohol aroma. Taste is bitter yet sweet, but not overdone as with other IPAs that I've tried. Flavors are well balanced between malt and hops. Mouthfeel is at first thick and syrupy, but leaving a dry, crisp finish on the palate. Although visual carbonation appears low, the beer is actually well cabronated. Overall, this is a very drinkable brew, and one of my favorites, but given it's 9% abv, is best consumed in moderation."
"($6.50 / 17 oz. Snifter)"
"D--a grat beer but cant drink more than two. An unbelievable double IPA, a must try"
"Overall, I like this brew alot. Great beer to sip and enough the changes as it gets warmer. It's what to expect from Dogfish Head, well balance, full of complex flavors and aromas, clean and darn good."
"A very well-balanced and enjoyable beer. Too easy to forget that it is 9% alcohol. It would be easy to drink a few of these."
"I'm partial to single IPA's, but I've tried the 60, 90, and 120 minute varieties of Dogfish Head, and in every case, I appreciated and enjoyed what they had to offer. The 60 is still my favorite, but you really can't go wrong with any of there; it all depends on how much alcohol and how much hoppiness suits your tastes."
"pours a clear golden amber color with a white head and nice lacing. Nose is of fruit and sweet malt, and as it warms, some alcohol. I was surprised, I expected a lot more hops in the aroma. Flavor starts out sweet and fruity and finished up with some spice. Tastes is amazingly smooth, the malts and hops are balanced perfectly. The mothfeel is thick, slick and full bodied. I think the ABV and heavy body lower the drinkability a little, but overall this is an excellent beer."
"The glass is disappearing more quickly than I had anticipated, which I suppose tells me that this is drinkable despite being a bomby 9% ABV. This is really a beer that has to be tried by any beer lover. It is big, strong, juicy, intense, and delicate all at the same time. The complexity will bring you back to more and more sips. Just be careful, or you'll be stumbling around before you know it."
"This beer is very strong. It is delicious, but two or three a month is probably all I could handle."
"Honestly, I enjoy Breckridge 471 as much, close to home in KC at a better value price."
"This is an amazingly drinkable full bodied, richly malted, and heavily hopped DIPA. The wonderful balance between rich malts and resinous hops actually allow this big beer to be a great, decadent session brew. Ill be enjoying this one again."
"Overall, an Imperial IPA that is beatifully balanced for taste and drinkability, but the sweet malt backbone hides the hop showcase a bit."
"This is a NICE beer. IPA's are one of my favorite styles and this one does not disappoint. The taste is there with nice toasted malt flavor and definite hop undertone, a good balance. It feels nice on the palate and goes down smooth. This could be really dangerous due to high alcohol content."
"Poured a deep, deep golden color with a nice off white head that left ample lacing. Aromas are floral, and spicy, almost peppery, with a bready grain hint, and not as much citrus as I was expecting. Taste was unlike anything I've had. I was fully bracing myself for an over the top hop blast straight to the face but what I got was something unexpected. There was a nice hop bitter punch right in the beginning, but then it just mellows out with a malty smoothness that is unreal. Tha balance is incredible for a 9% IPA. Sweetness is definitely present, almost too much at some points, and a touch of alcohol lingers in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is one of a kind, smooth, chewy, sticky....very nice. This could be a very dangerous beer as it goes down ultra smooth...would you like another? Hell ya..."
"I'm not a hophead but I love this beer. It has an awesome hop aroma and flavor but no bitterness at all. Very drinkable, to the point where it's a good thing it's expensive or it would be very easy to over-indulge. I usually like mildly hopped malty beers - browns, scotch ale, etc & only tried this because you have to at least taste anything new you come across & I was shocked at how good it tasted especially after getting a huge wiff of hops when it was opened. Not something to be swilled but enjoyed slowly. I think it tastes better a little on the warmer side, makes the maltyness of it moer pronounced."
"D- a hop heavy brew, a great sipping brew, a must have for hop heads"
"GET MY BUZZ ON-y"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- A few words to describe the mouthfeel: oily, creamy, slick, viscous, silky... it's awesome. The 9% is nowhere but in the eventual body warmth... and the burps are a review on their own. At $9 a four-pack, this isn't cheap beer... but I don't hesitate to keep this a constant presence in my fridge. Outstanding beer, and damn consistent."
"I could certainly drink several in a sitting. Hurrah to DFH."
"Mouthfell - good"
"This beer is dark brown in color with light brown hues. It has a foamy off-white head. Excellent retention. Has some pretty badass lacing as well. The whole glass is coated except for the part im drinking from. very nice. Smells piney and sweet. Lots of grapefruit, sweet caramel, maybe some raisins. You get candy sweetness from the malts upfront. It continues through the middle and ends bitter with a semi sweet citrus hop aftertaste. Not very complex but very well balanced and flavorful. Borderline full bodied. This one seems a little syrupy. Carbonation is good though. Could stand to be a bit lighter in body. This is some very drinkable stuff if you like very hoppy beers and very malty ones too. This seems to have em both x2."
"While Dreadnaught is a *SLIGHTLY* better beer, I think this is more drinkable, because of the better balance. Highly recommended."
"I really had a great time with Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA. I particularly enjoyed the opposing forces of the smell and taste. Since those two sense are so closly linked, it added to whatever ambience there was. The smell was very hoppy, yet the taste had only a clue of hops. Not to mention how very easy it went down."
"This beer is top of the line, just as I expected. Poured to the expected hazy orange-red color, with thick off-white head that lingered throughout entire glass, and left excellent lacing. Strong aroma of citrusy hops early on, but as beer warmed, the 9% alcohol became mopre evident, and was nicely blended with the bitte hops. A hint of malty sweetness also contributed to leave a great finish. A most excellent beer."
"Pours a nice, effervescent light ruby amber with a generous lacing that clings to the glass, a very enticing appearance that provides a great intro of what is to come. A very strong aroma of sweetness with fruity apples and pairs mixes nicely with the grainy aroma of the hops. The taste is very enjoyable and well-balanced between the hops and barley, tasting very similar to a good barley wine. Bittersweet perfection. The mouthfeel is pleasant, smooth, and incredibly balanced with a slight hint of thickness. All of these elements combine to make it devilishly drinkable."
"This is a very smooth IPA, in the sense of a fine Scotch. Very enjoyable indeed. Wish these were available in KC"
"It pours a dark orange with a creamy head; smells grassy and of citrus. I have to give the coveted 5.0 for taste - tastes of hops and sweetness (lemon-honey?), but despite the 9.0 ABV, there's only a slight alcohol kick. Goes down VERY smooth for a higher-alcohol IPA. This is the most well-balanced IPA I've ever had, and is my favorite so far. Dogfish Head keeps bringing me back for more!"
"d - this is a pleasant sipping brew which keeps the high alcohol content well-hidden until the finish when it slightly comes out but in a good way."
"Everytime I have this I am amazed at how such a big beer can be so amazingly well balanced. It puts a lot of other really good Imperial IPAs to shame. It's a bit painful to spend $50-60 for a case of beer, but damn... it's worth it."
"Adam"
"drinkability is suprisingly high. i feel like you could easily sit and go through a few of these, and you wouldn't notice the problem until you went to get up."
"D- Again i am stunned that i drank a DIPA with balance. Amazing flavors in this brew, after drinking this and DFH indian brown ale, i see why they have a strong following. Amazing brew."
"12 oz bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. Bottled 05/08/06, which I think means May 8 in US logic. (Explain to me again why it goes month/day/year?? That's not in order! But I digress...) Pours a light copper with little head and little carbonation. Aroma of sweet sugars and hops. Taste is quite sweet, and the alcohol is noticeable. This reminds me of a barleywine - a style that I generally have not taken well to as they tend to be too sweet for my tastes. The DFH 90 does not have the fullness of flavour and aroma and hops that I enjoyed in the DFH 60. I had such very high hopes for this beer considering its wonderful reviews, but alas, different strokes for different folks (and so and and so on and scooby-dooby-doo...)"
"Drinkability/Overall - This was my first trip down the road that is American DIPA's, and I'd have to say that it was a smooth ride. Good work Dogfish Head. Grab a four pack if you see one in your neck of the woods. You won't be disappointed."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Drinkability is also quite high, but with the significant alcohol content and flavor it may not be as highly drinkable as others."
"Not something you'd want to drink all night...not because its bad, but because its something you'd choose to savor. When you're done, you look forward to your next one...days or weeks down the road. A good special occasion beer."
"Mouthfeel and drinkability: nice mouthfeel, and one of the easiest beers I've ever had. Wish i could give a 5+. Easy to drink for a 9 percent abv and 90 ibus."
"Amazingly drikable. This in no way feels like a 9% beer. There's no alcohol burning, the body is biggish but not more so than most 6-7% IPAs. It has high enough bitterness to satisfy when I want a hop monster but not so much as to obliterate any sense of ballance. Very will done."
"This beer comes in a four-pack and is a worthy purchase."
"On tap at Bukowski's in Boston. Simply outstanding. One of the best American brewed ales. Substantial head. Citrus, molasses, bourbon aroma. Multiple taste undertones, but all subtle, none being over-the-top nor overwhelming. What Sam Adams should aspire to be."
" To me this is just another overpriced bad beer reliant on image and the tendency of people to want to like things that set them apart from the masses. Sometimes, the masses are right -- people are wasting money becayse they put status over good taste."
"An excellent beer. This beer would be a fantastic choice to compliment to a nice piece of salmon with a smoked sauce. This is a should try for all beer drinkers, and a must stock for any true hop lovers."
"The beer pours a golden amber color with a nice lace. The smell is very hops. Sweet and caramel with a slight hint of malt. Very spicy hops bite right off the bat. The tastes are all over your mouth caramel, pine, fruit, and spicy herbal tastes. The beer hits your mouth with a spicy tingle down the center of your tongue. The finish is clean with a nicely blended after taste that hits the roof of your mouth. In all it is a very interesting beer. Ive never been a huge fan of imperial IPAs but this one is blended well and has a nice balance. Its a great example of the style."
"I have to dink it in """quality""" and """aroma""" since I don't have the option for breaking these out for style, and for overall taste. If I were handed this in a blind tasting and told it was an exprimental category, fruit beer orinated strong ale, I'd probably give it 4.5 or 5 in both categories. I gave it a 4.5 for drinkability, and was tempted to give it a 5, but it *could* potentially be improved on, and I don't give 5s lightly. But as a DIPA (my favorite style)? It's weird and not what I want."
"Mouthfeel is syrupy, even, but it seems right. 90-minute packs a wallop, but its so well crafted that theres reason to keep plenty of this stuff around."
"Pours out a gem-like orangey amber with an off-white, frothy and creamy looking head. Smells primarily of citrus hops along with a sugary sweetness. Bready malts peak out from behind the hops. This manages to give off hardly any alcohol smell. The sweetness from the residual sugars of the malt hit the tongue first followed by a heap of citrus and pine from the hops. There is a slight breadiness from the malts and the hop bitterness is soft. Gets a somewhat medicinal character from the alcohol. Hops don't seem to be enough to balance the sweet. Mouthfeel is smooth with a soft carbonation. The alcohol makes this a little slick. The beer is just fine, but overall, the alcohol notes and big sweetness hold me back."
"D-Like I have said before something seems a bit off so this one couldn't have more than one. Others I have tried I really like it and it is a really good DIPA."
"Overall, one of the best ipas I have tasted."
"M&D: smoothly-textured, the fizziness is much much softer than most American beers I've had, due to the cask-conditioning I'm sure. In a way the taste and aroma are not so much bold and thick as the bottled version, but for any cask-conditioned ale lover, this gem on cask really is unbeatable. Lovely nectar, to say the least... can't have enough of it!!"
"THis is my first go-round with this beer, which is strange probably since ive had lots of other dogfish head beers and because this is so readily available. Amber colored and bubbly with a fantastic off-white head. Smeels hoppy and oily...maybe TOO oily...still smells good. Mmmm..this IS good. It might be the best tasting of the big-hop beers i've had. Lives up to its name and more...not too hoppy or bitter and quite smooth actually with a touch of lemon and sweet caramel malt in the flavor. Delicious. Glad i finally tried this."
"The first time I drank this beer, it was at Zeno's Pub in State College, PA. The beer tasted and smelled very good. I have had other Dogfish beers and this one is probably one of the best, in my opinion. The beer is dark in color, it is a heavy beer. The smell is unbelievably great. I would definately recommend this beer to anone that like to drink a reasonably prices good beer."
"What a great brew!!!! Pours a light amber/dark copper color, very clear with a small white head. Leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. Great overall aroma, IPA spiciness and fruity aroma. Taste is outstanding, rank it up there with Bigfoot (less harsh) and Celebration Ale. Hops bitterness, incredible smoothness and strong fruit flavor. Great balance between the fruit and the bitterness. Mouthfeel is rich with great flavor throughout, no heavy alcohol aftertaste to ruin the experience. I know this is 9% abv, but drinkability is still good. If I didn't have to drive, I would do up to three of these over a long session and still enjoy every drop. This one lives up to it's hype."
"D = Very drinkable. I could see myself drinking a few in a session."
"Drinkability? Hmm. It's nice and light, but commands you to taste every sip. Lots of malts and sweet flavors at first which gradually let the hops through while maintaining center stage until after the swallow. The finish is quite sticky and hoppy, resin-like if you will. The head sticks around quite a long time as well. I could drink 2 of these at a sitting, I believe (the price is too high to try right now). It's a great summer beverage that can use it's sweet, resin-like textures to be perfect in winter too. Decently complex, this is a great brew-- (and at 9% ABV) packs a bit of a wallop too."
"Got this beer from a good friend in NYC: Pours a dark golden color with a head that grows and grows. The smell is good, with a hint of hops but mostly malt. A hint of spices too, which create a nice balance with the other two. The initial taste is malty, with the last 75% consisting mostly of well-balanced hops. The consistency is thick, almost chewy, but just amazingly smooth all the way around. Mouthfeel is great, with a lingering hop taste, and the drinkability is also high. A tremendous beer, too bad they only sell it in 4 packs."
"Dogfish Head is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. This IPA pours an amberish gold with a nice medium head and minimal lacing. Smells strong with hops and malts. Some floral notes as well. Tastes is overpowered by the heavy use of hops. The bitter kick is what beer drinking is all about. Mouthfeel is somewhat acidic but overall this is a beer I could drink regularly."
"It would be work to finish a 4 pack in one sitting...but if someone has to do it, I volunteer!"
"It was very enjoyable. I've been pretending it's whiskey, that made me love it more. Appreciate this for what it is and don't compare it to Frank or Pliny and it will love you back. Cheers!!!"
"This is a big flavor beer. I like how balanced the beer is considering it is an Imperial IPA. There is enough malt to counter the high hop. I think this how an IIPA should taste. Excellent body, proper carbonation."
"English malt meet American hops with nice results. Dogfish Head does such a fantastic job of masking the high alcohol content of thier big beers. 90 Minute is big, balanced and beautiful."
"Smooth, with medium body. A surprisingly refreshing beer for summer that would be welcome in any season."
"2 thumbs up and a cheers, grand dipa, i just like more malts."
"D: A strong beer at 9% but certainly delicious enough to have more than one. Excellent flavors, enough malt to balance the bitterness - not punishing on the taste buds. One to savor."
"Overall an excellent brew"
"Hop bitterness was pronounced from start to finish, but wasn't overpowering. Body was a bit thin for a double. Alcohol level didn't spoil the smell or taste."
"Poured into a stone barley wine snifter, pours a nice amber colored tone with a amazing 2 inch head that leaves some serious fat sticky lace. Smell is of fruity apricots with citrus hops and sweet raisons. Taste hits you like a ton of bricks very fruitful and flavorful, I can taste apricots with raisons and other tropical fruits, very well complexed and not bitter at all leaving some warm sensation on your palate. This is so well made that I could sip it all day, very well balanced and one of the best around DogFish knows how to brew some serious DIPA."
"That taste had a much more powerful hops quality with an equally strong malty backbone. The slight bittersweet taste was much more pronounced in this style of serving the beer then the bottle. I like them both a lot and the rating should be equal because no matter how you have this beer it is wonderful."
"I couldn't see myself drinking more than one in one sitting, but this is awesome...definitely a favorite!"
"Edit: now that I am a little older and wiser, and more experienced with DIPAs, it is still true that this beer is a hop bomb, but compared to others of the style I have tried, this one is a malty beast, and I dropped the scores to where they should be."
"One of the better Double IPAs I've had."
"Overall, an incredibly flavorful and easy drinking example of this style."
"Pours lighter amber color with white head (which sticks around a bit). Aroma is hops (mainly citrus smell). The taste is hops (citrusy grapefruit like) framed with malty sweetness. It seems to hide the alcohol pretty well. The body is smooth, not too much carbonation, and enough body to act as a foundation for the strong hoppy and malt flavors. This is a great beer."
"Edit - Over the years, I have started to really dislike this beer."
"Sweet sherry, resonating with a complex woody oak masking a subtle, yet insistent alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is full and viscous leading to a sublime smoothness. Sadly this is the last of it's kind. DFH doesn't make 90 Minute IPA in the 750 mL anymore, and it will be sorely missed. I've been saving this one for a while, and decided tonight was the night to crack it. Glad I did."
"The taste is something very special, even if it is less complex than the nose had led me to hope for. Mostly what you're getting here is a deeply bitter, very resinous IPA with perfumey berry and notes of vinous fruit that are quickly consumed by alcohol. At first alcohol seemed to play the perfect role here, present, forceful, but not overwhelming. As the beer warmed however, it gradually made its way in more and more and got to be a bit much in the end. What overall impressed me here was the way this beer was able to deliver big beer qualities, killer bitter, and still stay very """bright""" while doing so."
"This is perhaps the best beer I've ever had. I was hesitant at the price ($15.20 for a 4-pack), but it was well worth it for the experience. It was much maltier than I expected. The hops are very strong, but that malt really balances it out well. DFH has created a monster of a brew here."
"Poured a slightly cloudy amber color into a globe glass, with a small white head. The aroma is sweet and of citrus and hops. The taste is very malty with hints of apricot, and surprisingly sweet for an I.P.A. It could be just a bit more balanced, though hops dominate in the finish. This is a big beer, with a heavy, syrupy mouth feel and low carbonation."
"Appearance was an orange-amber, seemed maybe a bit cloudy, and served without much head, but did keep a small remnant. The aroma was of citrus, grapefruit, and a sweet/syrupy smell. This aroma, however, was fairly weak. The taste was a nice, blended caramel, malt, syrup sweetness mixed with a fruity, citrus hop flavor. Very seamless mingling of flavors with a slightly dry, hop finish. Certainly not a bitter, hops-in-your-face IPA. The mouthfeel was medium-thick and slightly syrupy. Smooth. Overall very drinkable for 9% ABV and a nice hop-flavored but not harshly bitter beer."
"Ok... so I want to make a slight change to my previous statements. It may not be that the hops are at fault here, but I just wanted the sweet malts to back off a bit. That's it for now..."
"This beer is very tasty. It has very good malty taste and also just the right amount of hops without going overboard. It also has a beautiful color and nice head with just the right amount of aromoa to make your mouth water. Not a good session beer but I would drink two and move on to a less alcohol and less hop beer."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel was smooth but this one was not an easy drinker."
"I bought a 1/2 barrel of this, so I (and my friends) have been drinking this for quite a while... The first sip and/or glass is always great. You can taste the alcohol, but I tend to like higher alcohol beers... The problem is that I just get tired of drinking it... One is great, but more than one, and the flavor just seems to get dull... If I were buying another Keg from Dogfish Head (and I am generally a fan of that brewery), I'd probably go with the 60 minute... But if you are just buying a 4 or 6 pack, then the 90 minute is a good choice..."
"Overall this is a wonderful brew that demands your immediate respect."
"It's a good beer, but I'll take a Hop Devil over a 90-minute."
"Poured a dark orange color with not much head. Aroma was very sweet, almost like bubblegum. Had this on tap this weekend and in the nose I also noticed a rose petal and very skunky herb aroma. Its taste was initial hops followed by a very sweet finish. Also tastes like eating marijuana nuggets while drinking this."
"I would put this into the same category (though not as purely drinkable) as Bell's Two Hearted or a really good Harpoon."
"Overall a great beer and for this style above average. The color was nice and reddish-amber almost honey. The head was smallish and left after the first few swigs. The smell was nice, hoppy and fresh, but not too hoppy. Some light tantilizing evergreen scent in there...just inviting me in for a drink. The flavor was pleasantly on the sweet side with a tad bit of alcohol and hops in the end. It was a bit on the thicker side with not too much carbonation. I liked this beer and will quickly look to buy more next time I can."
"Drinkability is very good with or without food. You may not want too many but if you pace your self well it won't beer because of the beer taste that you stop. This is defiantly a standard in the bier keller. Zum Wohl! Und Prost! MK"
"Apricot color with a quickly dissipating white head, leaving a decent lacing. Grassy, and some floral hops, seems like to much maltiness for a DIPA. Starts out with a lemon zest, followed by a caramel taste, quite malty for the style, with a grassy finish. Medium carbonation, syrupy and full bodied. Able to finish the bottle, but glad I only got the one. Probably won't try this one again."
"Pours a rich, rusty orange with a medium head. The head drops off quickly, as expected for 9 ABV. Citrus and pine needle aroma, matching the resinous, bitterness of the taste. Each sip lingers with the hops and malt battling away. The long finish ends with an orange and tangy dryness. It's well attenuated, but the depth of the flavor profile gives an impression of a medium body. Very drinkable. There's enough in each drink that makes you want to keep going."
"This could be the closest thing to perfection I have tasted. The extra 30 minutes means a lot. LOL. But seriously, I really can not find anything critical to say about this beer. I also can not put into words how satisfying it is. Just remember it is 9% alcohol, so don't drink the whole four pack at once."
"The beer is very sweet and malty. There was so much hype about the beer I had to try. It is not a very balanced product. Lot's of yeast up front. Good Hoppy taste but mouthfeel was all over the board. Nice to see more hoppy style beers coming from the East Coast. There is a distinct palate difference between the East and West coast. Dogfish has a great PR motivation. Everyone wants to sample their beers."
"Perhaps a touch undercarbonated in the mouthfeel department, otherwise what you'd expect. Overall, this was a very good beer but it didn't quite meet my expectations (granted they were too high). Too sweet to be a sessioner for me, personally."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, but be carefull. The high ABV is deceiving. You will get drunk quick after a couple of these. My opinion on this brew? Very good, one of the best I've had, wish I could try it on tap. Expensive, so I tend to savor it when I get the chance."
"This is one of my all-time favorites. Cross the border into Wisconsin and usually these are available. Just a great beer!"
" This one sets a standard for the Imperial IPA and I seem to judge most others on this version, a classic for sure in all ways."
"D: I enjoy this beer quite a lot for not liking the DIPA style that much. The brewers at DFH have managed to create a big hoppy beer that doesn't taste like a celery stick or pine sap. I usually don't like throwing down $9.99 for a 4-pack, but this is one exception I don't mind. This gets a high score here for being one of the only DIPA's that I would order over a typical IPA."
"Overall, supurb beer!"
"Good color--decent head, but the head reduces soon to a generous, bubbly lace. Smells like an IPA with a sweet, bubble-gum wrapper around it. But this is NOT what I have come to expect from an IPA or especially an imperial IPA. Usually I feel like they are just trying to show their hop muscle, and nothing else. This has a different hop character that is still serious, but smoother and much, much more drinkable than ANY IPA I have ever experienced. The finish is long and beautiful and really shows off the extra barley character of this brew. As a person who avoids IPA's but does drink them and appreciate them, I am very much enjoing this brew and still respecting it for not compromising the hop-forward character that I feel is essential to the IPA style. Maybe it's the """ridiculous amounts of barley""" that make it this classic, quality beer with a fantastic, long finish. I'm drinking an IPA that's far from insipid and in no way hop-shy, but still a quality, balanced brew that normal people like me can drink and enjoy."
"Two notes: My bottle is labelled as """90 Minute Imperial IPA," and thus is probably the new labelling. Also, mine has the bottled on date...a very faint 02/01/06...so February 1 2006 or January 2 2006."
"The North Eastern DIPA to set the bar. 90 Minute is just that good. It has a lot more maltyness to it, than the 60 minute version. Yet, they are almost near each other on raw hoppiness. 90 Minute is still slighly more hoppy, but it's the malt that creates that metaphoric sense of being dulled down. Highly recommended."
"Were it not for the price, I would probably drink too much of this beer and gain weight. Sit back and sip this beer with a friend."
"It pours a nice amber color with a perfect head that maintains its presence. It's smooth taste is characterized by a perfect blend of hops and a great mouthfeel. This is Dogfish Head's gem; pick it up tonight!"
"Drinkability: it's an imperial ipa, its not going to be the most drinkable beer"
"Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had. I will definitely reccommend this to others and I WILL have more. Even my girlfriend loved this beer and she generally dislikes Pale Ales and IPAs."
"Rich, full body lightened by understated carbonation. Really impressively drinkable, albeit at a slow pace, for a 9% beer. This beer is so far from what I was expecting, it's crazy. I was expecting bracing hop bitterness. To me, this beer is quite sweet! That works too."
"Every time I drink this beer, I like it a little bit more. It tastes exactly like it tastes, delicious, refreshing and exciting."
"Damn good beer...damn good beer...I had this one the first time at the Landmark 1850 in Milwaukee. I was in love after that, amazing balance of grainy malts, sugray fruit undertones, piney hops and a nice warm alchohol tingle. I love everything about this beer. A light golden honey color gives way to a almost perfectly white head. The retention is decent but he lacing is phenomenal. The taste out-of-this-world. Mouthfeel is full, creamy, a bit of oily presence and oh so drinkable. I want more....but cannot get it where I live. I still want more."
"Pours a clear orange color with a three finger width head that soon goes to a film. Smell is dominated by a bouquet of hops. Taste gives a nice hint of malty backbone that soon gives way to the main attraction of this beer, the hops. About half way into the glass the warming effects of the alcohol become noticable. The mouthfeel is good, the bitterness of the hops seem to sit on the tongue. A very enjoyable IIPA from dogfish, my favorite between the 60 and 120min IIPAs."
" Brutal initial hopping but mellows in the sip to finish reasonably clean. Satisfying, tasty finish with fruit tones without. Alcohol is clearly present but not overwhelming. A little heavier than I usually like in an IPA and not as drinkable because of it."
"Pours a crystal clear light amber color with a fluffy white head. Aromas are dominated by resiny, piney hops and a tiny bit of malty sweetness in the end. Flavor is very complex with dark, dried fruits, some spice, a bit of alcohol. The bitterness isn't overly pronounced, mostly just the flavors of the hops come out. Mouthfeel is slick and creamy feeling backed by a moderate amount of carbonation. I'm a bit surprised by this brew as it doesn't match any others of this style. It's not overly citrusy, bitter, or sweet. It's closer to a Belgian style for me than a DIPA. Overall, however, I'm happy with the one bottle I got. It's unique for its style and quite enjoyble."
"Over all this is a great beer if you are looking for a double IPA, wish it was more readily available on the west coast. If you get a chance, try it you won't be disappointed."
"D - all this adds to a rather high drinkability for such a bitter brew, well done DFH, another fine brew"
"This beer was different than I expected, I was expecting a more assertive hop bite but it was actually much more smooth bordering on sweet. Much more well balanced than other """big""" IPA's, not sure if I like that about this IPA or not yet, maybe I need another, oh well. Looking forward to trying the 120 Min IPA in the near future. On preview I agree with other reviews that state how the alcohol becomes more prevalent as the beer warms up."
"Had this a few times before, finally decided to review it. Good thing I did, because I now have a new favorite IIPA."
"I find this beer almost perfect. I love it. This is the first beer in my craft brewing advetures where I let out a proverbial Eureka and realized what the craft beer thing was all about. I don't know if this is really true to the double IPA style, because it has a balance that most of the double IPAs don't have. Instead of having hops to """rip your tongue out""" it has hops that finish well and balance off the thick malty opening on this beer. Get a sweet citris overall taste which is really balanced and almost always hits the spot. Fairly prominent alcohol taste which works well in the confines of this. I'm never not in the mood for this beer."
"Decent drinkability but watch out; the alcohol will get you!"
"D: Tasty, not filling, and even though you clearly taste the alcohol, you won’t mind it at all, this may get you into trouble in a hurry. Although this isn’t my favorite Double IPA, it’s very, very good."
"Be careful with this one. This is a strong brew with a slightly sweet taste that can mislead you. Suggest, citrus, peach and strong hops. Share with friends with adventurous tastes because of the cost. Expensive and worth the cost for true beer snobs. Great when alternating with other less sweet IPAs. Backyard drink. You do not want to drive after having a few of these."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle dated 12/16/05. pours a hazy copper/ orange color with very little head, that disappears quickly. Lacing is incredible. The aroma is mostly piney hop notes . For a Double IPA the hops are not overpowering at all. It is well balanced by the malt sweetness. I do not care for highly bitter beers. I've recently gone from drinking Brown ales to IPA's. The mouth feel is oily (but in a good way) from all the hops and is very thick. The alcohol content is not pronounced for a 9% beer, but is more pronounced than the 60 minute IPA (which I'm a huge fan off) This is an excellent beer."
"This is a good IPA. Great hoppiness and surprisingly good maltiness as well. Great for the hot summer days."
"\thanks to Lackenhauser for this one (not to mention many others)."
"Floral and citrus aroma with a mahogony pour. This double IPA is one of the best. Not as hoppy as the 60 min IPA but much smoother. Much more malt used in this brew. Easy drinkability and you feel great after 2 of them!! Very smooth with an excellent finish. would love to find it on tap somewhere with the DFH fresh hopper!!"
"Mouthfeel- The perfect flavor example of the word """bittersweet""". Enough said."
"Overall a good Double IPA - Not my favorite. I enjoy the 60 Minute IPA much better - but I favor single IPAs anyway. Not my first choice for a 2IPA, but good."
"By far the best IPA or double IPA I've had."
"Bought a case.. ended up having a few every night since then. It is now a week later (have one in my hand now) and there is one left in the fridge. This is an amazing beer. I especially like the high alcohol content (9%), one beer and I have a buzz, so I only want to have a couple at a time.. unless my intent is something different. I'm definitely going to get another case tomorrow.. along with some others to try out."
"D: Overall very drinkable. Hops could be a little more agressive. Goes down a little too easily for the ABV so be careful! This one drinks like a good session beer, but at 9% it'll sneak up on you. I for one might be willing to take that chance, but not on a """school night"""!! :)"
"I didn't find this as drinkable as other quality IPA's. After one I was ready to move on to something else."
"Floral smell, sweet taste, extremely smooth almost creamy going down. You really dont want the aftertaste to end. I am a huge hop fan, Ive brewed a bunch of batches, please forward the recipe. All in all glad I live in MI so I can grab it when I want."
"Pop the cap and a burst of floral. Once in the glass a nice grassy aroma. Amber colored, slightly dark, light creamy head dwindles, with some lacing. Great balanced hoppyness. This is an imperial IPA [the 120 is a Barely wine] Very nice, wish we could get on the west coast, but then we do have Stone brewery...."
"Dogfish Head 90 Minute Imperial IPA pours a slightly hazy amber with a thick, fluffy, off-white head. I really like the smell. Citrusy hops. I could sit with this stuffed in my face all day. Citrusy hops dominate the taste, but I'm surprised at how balanced this is. I don't feel like the bitterness is out of control which I feared could be the case with this style, especially in the finish. Better than I expected, and I was expecting a lot. All of the Dogfish beers I've tried have been worth trying even if they weren't my thing. Highly recommended."
"Still, well brewed madly/geniusly filtered."
"What's better than 90 minute IPA through the Randall? Why, that would be CASK-CONDITIONED 90 minute IPA through the Randall. I was swimming through layers of herbal, piney, floral hop aromas and flavors with an amazingly balanced sweet malt backbone that had me silenced, but for the sound of purring deep within my bowels. Layer upon layer of hop flavor washing over every millimeter of my mouth. Nothing sharp or harsh about so much hop flavor."
"First off, I can't believe how balanced this beer is, I couldn't have been happier. Its a deep golden color, slightly hazy with little head and a nice lace. There is definitely a strong grain bill backing the monster hop addition, which it does nicely. The alcohol flavor also provides balance without it being too """boozy""". The hop flavor is strong but isn't too bitter nor is it grassy or piney. This is definitely a standard for the style."
"It's surprisingly light on flavor, too, until one takes a good swallow. It's drinkable more than anything of this caliber (and hop content!) I've ever tried. When the flavor comes through, though, it makes itself known with smooth raspberry, pine, grapefruit, and lemon in such a way that doesn't surprise or knock me back. Not what I was expecting, but certainly wonderful and excellent. The """Imperial IPA""" made me expect a powerhouse, with rough edges, sharp tastes, and a sumo wrestler's body. Instead, it's a smooth, Belgian-like dilettante. What a sexy beer."
"Best IPA ever for me."
"I am glad I purchased the 4 pack(which was kinda spendy), but after drinking one of them I am not sure I will buy it again."
"Poured with little head but the tiny bubbles would sparsely assemble to form a thin shield of foam. Looking into the glass was reminiscent of looking down on Earth from space, through the clouds. Leaves lacing in the shape of veins, or lightning bolts down alongside the glass. An otherwise (average, but attractive) golden appearence. Aroma seems a little restrained, or compared to expectations anyhow. A unique blend of hops in this beer. I struggle to confidently detect one single kind. Mouthfeel is medium-low carbonated which suits the beer quite well. Not one swig is empty, flavour consistent in each and at the varying temperatures. While there is no alcohol 'burn', no alcohol taste in any form really, mouthfeel still acompanied with a warming sensation. You can feel the warming sensation (I must stress, no alcohol taste) in the sides of the mouth. Hops are rather restrained in the flavour, a big malty back bone sees to it. Some crisp bitterness right before swallowing. Flavour is above anything else cistruisy. Some grapefuity notes, but overall I seem to taste tangerine. As it warms flavour improves. Hops come alive a little more as the malt settles into the background. Quite deliscious. An overall excellent quality ale and really, rather outstanding."
"Pricey beer, for just a little more than what I paid for this, Id rather have a bomber of Ruination. Still, cost aside, it was a damn good beer."
"D: YUM!!! Very well balanced imperial IPA. One of the tastiest beers I have had in quite some time. Thanks to geexploitation for this beer recieved in a trade."
"I was very pleased with this beer. I tried this before the 60 min, so I'm anxious to get to that one. I'll definitely enjoy this one again."
"Cheers to DFH"
"This was an interesting beer. A little pricey at $9 a four pack this beer was well worth it. As I poured it into a glass this beer pour a nice dark orange color with a nice white head. The smell, fantastic. Smells like fruit with pine and a trace of alcohol very pleasing to the nose. Taste- wow a blast of fruitness and alcohol, it doesn't hide it in this beer. I would sip this one too. All in all im was very happy with this beer."
"Pretty good drinkability for a 9% beer, I could see myself having a few of these. Although the 90 Minutes that I've had in the past seem a little bit different than this one. They were more malty with a bland bitterness to them. This must be a freasher bottle as the hops were more flavorful. Still, I think I would choose Goose Island Imperial IPA over this either way."
"I have also had this on tap (in Bellevue, Washington). I had alrady been thoroughly blown away by a mess of Rock Bottom stuff. Of course a 90 put me over the top. Fortunately, my hotel (the Westin) was only a couple hundred feet away. Gee, I think it was really good, but who would remember?"
"No way I'd drink more than one of these at a time, too much booze, too sweet. I think this is more or less junk, and the 60min is leagues ahead and cheaper."
"CRUX: INTERESTING TAKE ON DIPA. I think I have to resample this perfumy cordial when I become more Beer-sophisticated...I've had friends tell me that it's fantastic on-tap..."
"Pours well with a lace that lingers through to the end. Crisp citrusy notes in a noticeably hoppy aroma. As evolved and formidable as any double IPA I've ever had, the 90 Minute is a beautiful and delicious beer from start to finish. It's that perfect blend of hops and alcohol that the 60 Minute just doesn't capture and the 120 Minute goes a bit overboard with. At present, this is my favorite beer in the world. Of course, this is subject to frequent, substantiated changes. But for the moment, Dogfish Head tops the list."
"Pours a golden amber with ok whitish head, good lacing clinging to every sip. A lovely floral hop nose, sweet fruits with a herbal character and just a twinge piney. Really just outstanding. Taste is just to die for. A smooth yet lively ride witha somewhat oily feel, the 90 minute delivers the kind of hop attack you'd expect from a DIPA, a great bittersweet ride that ebbs and flows from chewy and bitter to sweet and warm and back to a bitter all over again. Hints of citris and pine find its way into it here and there, and, if I were a witch doctor, I'd say this is an excellent cure for a headache, as mine mysteriously disappeared. Yes, it is all due to the beer. It is that good."
"Overall this was a fantastic beer. One of the best IPA's I've had, double or otherwise. Highly recommended."
"Orange and copper with a pillowy head. Smells sweet, citrusy, and piney. Tastes of candied oranges, sweet sugars from the malt with lemon and grapefruit that give way to a pleasant bitterness, very nice balance between the two. Medium to heavy body, the alcohol is hardly noticeable. High quality dipa."
"Notes: This style has been growing on me enormously of late. I find myself returning the beers because of their promise of enormouse hops and flavor. This is one solid double IPA that I would definitely return to again, although it does not instill in me the instant satisfaction that I have perhaps tried the best example of the style, I hope to find it on tap and give it another go."
"First time reviewing this classic. This bottle pours with a smaller head than I remember DFH 90 having, and a nice, clear, bright amber body. The nose is quite piney due to all the hops, but the nose indicates balance, too, with some solid malts in the background. The taste is quite bitter with fruity, piney hops, moving from the front of the palate to the back. Throughout this beer is big and full on the palate -- very high gravity -- and incredibly smooth given all the hops present. For an extremely hoppy, highly alcoholic brew, DFH 90 is surprisingly drinkable. This is a truly excellent IPA."
"UPDATE: The last few I've had (10/06) have not tasted as good."
"Hop flavor that leaves you very satisfied."
"Reminds me a lot of dreadnaught. Its got that pineapple/strawberry hop character. Is this an east coast IPA thing? Ive never had a west coast IPA taste like this before. Slightly less complex than Dready. Piney hop punch up front, rolling in to that aforementioned fruity hoppiness. Alcohol is very well masked, and only noticeable as a slight burn in my tummy. This beer is insatiably smooth, with a wonderful mouthfeel. Carbonation is perfect. Drinkability is off the charts. If there ever was an all-night DIPA, this is it."
"I look forward to trying 90 minute again or maybe something different on our Randall in the future. Great job Sam!"
"Overall- Wow, I slammed this beer 2 years ago, but I take back what I said. I've been drinking this beer for the past few months and is my go-to IPA. I, obviously grew in the tastebud department and have come around to enjoy and respect a big flavor IPA such as this."
"Cheers!"
"D: Its strong, its heavy, but I still gave it a 3.5 because of"
"If you like hops this is the way to go. The boys at Dogfish head have made a great beer here. If you love hops this beer is for you. Personally the best IPA I have had. This beer has a great hop taste. I am really looking forward to trying the 120 min IPA from Dogfish Head."
""
"Hops come across as juicy/oily more than bitter. An interesting DIPA that I enjoy smelling a bit more than drinking (though I enjoy that too!)"
"Nose is enormous with a robust pine cone and citrus combo that plays delicately while also being very bold. Taste is balanced. Pure hoppy goodness with a nice malt structure as a backbone. This beer almost defines the style for me with its easy drinking but very complex blend of hops, malt and underlying citrus notes."
"This is the only double IPA i can really drink (so far). I made the mistake of making this the first IPA I tried. It got me excited about beer, hops, and IPA's, but I've not yet found another nearly as amazing. Little praise can be said about this beer that is not infact true. Of note, as high as this beers rating is for me, I never stock it and drink it only on extremely rare occasions, by itself, and stich to the likewise delicious 60 on occasion with food, which may account for how impressed I am by this brew on those rare occasions I crack one. Cheers to possibly my favorite craft brewery!"
"I see this as being a seriously dangerous summer beer. The funny thing is that I've never considered myself a hop head but apparently my taste is still developing."
"Oh yeah, been getting in the hoppy stuff and wipes my mind clean from that SA cherry wheat shit earlier. Pours amber color, little head, smells sweet. Taste? Ohhhh yeah, nice citrusy hop flavor with sweet malt, a perfect balance. Damn I could pound these things all night but I must control myself and savor them instead. Only if they were available in six packs and not just 4-packs."
"Is this the big brother of 60' IPA? If so, I need to have the 120'. It looks like the 60', clear orange with a medium white head. It has a sweet odor, and a similar taste, but deeper and bolder. It's very hoppy, but I think a bit smoother and not as sharp as the 60'.. A wonderful beer, one I would like to have again."
"Pairs well with sharp cheddar, like a Grafton's 5 year."
"Overall: An outstanding IPA, wholeheartedly recommended."
"9% You wouldn't guess it. Watch your back on this one, or you'll be laying on it."
"Conclusion, if you know of a place that's not over a 2 hour drive from your homestead (unless you get a hotel) stop and try this unique concept in beer history. Well worth it."
"Drinkability only suffers from the size of this one. Although i would drink quite a few in a row, i wouldn't call it a session beer."
"D - Unreal. Perhaps the most dangerous drinkability of any high alcohol content beer I've ever had (with Bigfoot being a possible exception). If I did not know this was a 9% beer, I might have downed these all afternoon, until I fell off my stool in a coma."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, this gives a 2 inch head that leaves some nice lacing. Hazy orange. Aroma - Piney hops, and some sweet malt, and some alcohol. Taste - just as promised by aroma - pine and alchohol and, most unfortuantely diacetyl. The various elements just did not integrate. Diacetyl makes it way too sweet, and the alcohol goes down like cheap vodka. Mouthfeel - full, moderate carbonation, alcohol burn, decent coating from hop oil. Drinkabilty - I did not like this and will avoid it."
"Medium mouthfeel, moderately drinkable with an oily nature and a slight bitter sting on the tongue along with the aftertaste. A very unique taste that would place it more as a light barleywine than a strong IPA."
"Really looked forward to this one, now time to try it and review it. Pours out to a rich golden amber color with a lively head of whitish orange foam. Solid lacing and a medium to medium low level of carbonation. Aromas of hops, hops and more hops. Very nice. Notes of citrus, pine, hops, a touch of sweet spices and herbs. Taste was pure hops. Flavors were laced with thick citrus and pine notes, drenched with hops and a mild burn of alcohol. Nice. This is a hop heads dream come true. Mouthfeel was nice and oily, just the way a good DIPA should be. Very slick, and slightly thick. Drinkability is good. I wouldn't have more than one at a time, but this is a solid beer. Highly Recommended. I'm scared to think of what the 120 could do..."
"Overall, I love this beer. It's hoppy without being overpowering sweet without being cloying and thick without being syrupy. It feels very decadent, but is still a solidly crafted and tasteful beer. I dream about this beer. In my opinion, its the best Imperial IPA on the East Coast."
"I did i really spend 12 bucks on a 4 pack? Jesus christ I am poor but I just had to. Hype gets to me. This poured a gorgeous deep orange golden color wit an awesome creamy beige head, very soft and cratery. Abundance of lacing. The aroma is piney and floral. The malt is there but the hops dominate. Lots of hop oily goodness. The mouthfeel is nice, really slick and smooth. It coats your mouth similar to brooklyn east ipa. This is so drinkable! The alcohol is not tasteable. Now this was expensive and I would take a bear racer 5 over this anyday but this is still a great beer. Just not sure why it is so raved about, i was expecting jesus juice."
"90 Minute is a dark copper color with lost of carbonation. Large head is creamy and thick. Aroma is of a strong, pungent citrissy hop with an enticing underlying sweetness. For flavor the strong, fresh citrissy hop flavors are first noticed and pack quite a wallop, but the delicious underlying malt flavors are what makes this an exemplorary beer. Bitterness is high, but not as bracing as expected. Anyway, 90 Minute is one of the best beers that I've sampled in a while, there's just so much juicy hop flavor to enjoy here and an excellent malt base. Complexity is high and the flavors have many interesting nuances. Very highly recommended."
"Overall: A fantastic brew that will impress beer lovers everywhere. A great DIPA and one that deserves a permanent place in my fridge."
"Beer pours a cloudy orange-bronze color with a creamy 1""" head that becomes a 1/4""" white cap, and laces with the best of 'em. Aroma is mostly hoppy, floral, and piney. Taste blows me away. Hops are noticed first, then a sweet malt flavor follows, alcohol bites just a bit at the finish. Light carbonation with a medium-thick mouthfeel. Much more balanced then what I was expecting. Between the Dogfish IPA's, this one gets my vote as the best, mainly because of it's balance."
"One year old bottle: Open the bottle for a big malty smell. Malty, malty, malty! I poured it into a narrpw pilsener glass for some odd reason, but that let me see its copper body with golden highlights, under a bubbly head. The taste is sticky; any sweeter and itd be beer candy. Then I noticed the nice American IPA hop bill sliding in nice and gently, until it demonstrates its every bit the match of the oversized malt profile. Total impression is of a hoppy young barleywine. I hadnt realized this was an Imperial IPA. Ill have to see if I can celler my remaining bottles. Still, glad to have had a relatively fresh one, so I could catch the hops before they fade out."
"Poured from bottle into DFH's cool glass. Excellent head and a deep orange color. The aroma is in your face Kind Bud HOPS. 90IBU. Piney and citrusy. The taste has strong hop presence that works with the sweet malt to hide the 9%ABV well. The beer seems full-bodied with great carbonation. One of my favorites."
"Highly recommended."
"The balance makes this taste deceptively drinkable--way too easy to take down for its ABV. Overall, this is a mild, and nicely flavored double IPA. Definitely worth a look."
"Man, what a beer. Pours clear with a quickly dissipating head. A steady stream of bubbles rise from the center of my Duvel glass. Smells of citrus, flowers and pine. MMM tastes of bubblegum, massive hops with some balancing malt towards the end. Slick mouthfeel with the oils coating my entire mouth reminging me of the blast just given me. Drinkability, well my buds are already numbing at mid-glass don't know if I could have another right after, but worth the wait till the next time..."
"I bow to you, DFH....truly I'm not worthy of such a fine, fine product."
"Great beer. This is one of the best versions of the double IPA I have had. Nice clarity, bightness and carbonation. Does not appear to be bottle conditioned. Nice citrus/floral aroma. Smells like Cascade or maybe Amarillo hops. Lots of malty caramel notes, which I think are well balanced with the hop bitterness. The mouthfeel might be lacking just a bit but I really do like this beer."
"Overall, I probably wouldn't purchase any more of this beer. I'm not normally a big Double IPA fan anyway, but this one came highly recommended."
"This is an excellent beer. It's rather complex for an IPA, although it's very hoppy (as expected) there is a nice interplay between various flavors to make you want to keep coming back for more. Because of the high ABV, I couldn't imagine having too many of these in a sitting, but it would sure be fun trying!"
"This beer is very drinkable for 9%abv, almost too easy to drink. In my opinion this is one of the best beers that dogfish head brews."
"Smelled sweet and hoppy. First taste was wow. Thick malty body with little hop flavor at first taste that exploded with big hoppy middle and finish. Finished clean and crisp. Will keep it in the beer fridge as the bench mark of all IPA's"
"overall, this is certainly a good beer, however, i was a bit disappointed by the hop profile, i prefer a bit less grapefruity hops, i think other double IPA's are much better. but, a very good beer nonetheless."
"The body is mid to full. As the beer warms, more flavor is noticeable. As is the malt taste with the adjustment of the mouth to the hoppy taste. The 9% isn't really noticeable at all (or at least until later) as everything is so balanced out. Overall this is one of my favorite beers."
"Pours a peachy color with orange hues. Nice translucent clarity and a small off-white cap that dissapeared fast. Left very faint lacings on surface and sides. Aroma was wonderful with citrus hops, malts, yeast, and """earthy""" spice notes. The alcohol was apparent in nose, but not too strong. Tasted very sweet, almost syrupy. However, clinches down with a very nice grapefuit and citrus hop bite. The carbonation was just right and finished dry, but left a refreshing fruity aftertaste. I will definitely enjoy this again very soon! In fact I had planned to give one of the bottles out the four pack I bought to a friend of mine....nevermind. I'll wait till I have more to spare."
"Bottom line: top notch. Highly recommended."
"I don't know how I've never got around to reviewing this one, I've probably had more than 100 90 minute IPAs in my time. My sample is from a 12oz bottle with no born on or best by date. My two favorite characteristics of this beer are the smell and the taste. Piney sweetness is the best way I can desribe the taste. I've introduced this one to a few of my BMC drinking friends who loved this as well. My favorite offering from DFH."
"The abv may not make this a wise choice for if you're looking to down a 12 pack, but, if you're looking for a hoppy brew to enjoy, this is it. One of my top 3 DIPAs."
"D - Very easy to drink and deceptively strong. Definitely worth a look if you haven't yet. A few of these could make for a very bad night."
"I do like it"
"It's a good medium bodied beer. At 9.0% this thing'll probably kick my ass if I try to take it on."
"I kind of like the 60 minute better, with all the flavor intensity of these but a little easier drinking. But it's a close call. The ultimate in hoppiness (and that doesn't just mean """bitter""")"
"Provides a heavier mouthfeel than most other IPA/Double IPA's out there. A very good all around brew that I would recommend to all fellow hophead BA's."
"One of my favorite DIPA's. Sometimes this style can be a little too much, but this is a definite winner."
"Pours cloudy amber with a thick, off-white head. Great retention. Super hop aromas but no ttoo overpowering. Very intense sweetness of grapefruit aroma with grassy undertones. DELICIOUS!!! Fantastic balance of hops and malt. Goes down easy for such a big beer. I tried not to compare this with the 60 minute which I also tasted this night and evaluate it on it's own. The extra half-hour does wonders for this beer."
"Notes: Wow! Unfortunately this beer costs $10.99 for a 4 pack where I shop. If not, I would drink this non-stop. I love it. It makes me want to become famous so that I can get an endorsement deal. In the past year I have sampled 300+ different beers and this is in my top 5. Dogfish Head 4 Life!"
"Drinkability -- Good drinkability. I'd be fine with just one or two during a session. They have the tendency to sneak up on you if you aren't careful. This beer ages well, but I cannot wait to pick up some of it fresh. Recommended."
"Not something I would search out after a long run in the summer, but when I have time to sit and enjoy a beer, this is one that makes me smile and I enjoy to the end."
"Drinkability: Very very good. Will have another. Can actually have a couple a night if you want."
"This beer pours a beautiful amber gold with a huge while head that laces and holds fantastically all the way down the beer. The smell is all hops. Mostly a grapefruit aroma but some floral aromas as well. The taste is fantastic. A wonderful mix of mainly citrusy grapefruit flavor from the hops mixed in with some subtle floral tastes and balanced beautifully with some pale malts. This beer is extreamly thick with a good carbonation. Overall I would love to drink this everyday. This is exactly what I want out of a beer."
"Nice copper in color. Smooth creamy white head with lots of tiny bubbles. Minimal lacing. Strong citrusy hop smell, a slight floral scent and a hint alcohol. Also got a strange scent of maybe tree bark. Can't exactly pin that one down. Taste starts off with a bang of hops. Then mellows as it goes down. I get a tiny warming sensation as it goes down from the alcohol. Although it does not have an alcohol taste."
"Real good one here. Very balanced for 9%, great flavor, mouthfeel etc. not much more to say, just gonna enjoy this one...."
"The alcohol is present but not in an obtrusive way. No killer aftertaste of too sweet or bitter, I would say just right. Being the Double IPA that I think I've liked the best this gets good marks on drinkability. While I've appreciated some other double's for what they are, the sweetness normally drives me away from really seaking them out again but i could see going back to this one."
"Lurid orange body with a creamy milkshake head. Aroma is astringent and oxidizing, consisting of pine, orange peals, and lemon oil. Devilishly hopped but with a sweet malt front. Finishes dry and light, leaving a slightly burning citrusy aftertaste. Medium bodied, creamy yet biting. Excellent mouthfeel. Strong IPA."
"Overall, very good IPA. Note to the the DFH people: Please start distributing in California! I'd like to get this stuff regularly."
"D - very, very tasty brew. Alcohol content makes this prohibitive to consume in large quantities, but an extremely flavorful, rich beer."
"One of the best offerings I have had from Dogfish. I will certainly buy again and again."
"Drinkability: A very good Double IPA, a different one, also. Maybe one of the maltiest DIPAs I have ever tried."
"Drinkability: An absolutely delicious beer that forces you to respect it. There's no trace of the 9% abv at any point, so it would be pretty dangerous as a session beer. This is by far the best Imperial IPA I have tasted so far. Congrats, Dogfish Head, on this superb, hoppy delight."
"just for the record this was a 12oz bottle."
"Drinkability: The only downfall of the 90 minute - the huge hop flavor, syrupy body and high alcohol definitely make this a 1-serving beer. But I savor every sip!"
"Dark golden color. Thick head with slight retention. Loads of lacing all the way down the glass. Smell is all HOP OIL! Also some leafy hops follow with a smooth malt balance. Taste is mostly hops as well. Good spicy hop flavor. Really thick yet smooth feel. Easy to drink. I wish I could get enough of this to drink all night. Thanks to Mike Brawley for carrying this gem!"
"Cheers!"
"~R"
"Medium body mouthfeel. Coats well and slick on the tongue"
"M & D: Mouthfeel is pretty damn good on this offering from dogfish. It's a perfect mesh of the 120 and the 60. Still very hoppy like the 60 but not the high alcohol that the 120 has. Drinkability is also pretty high as it goes down very smooth. Full bodied DIPA. Exactly what a double should be like."
"I would like to try another of these in a few months, maybe I got a bad one..."
"Smooth and creamy with just enough carbonation to get it down faster. I could drink many of these..."
"This is my new favorite IPA, and in my mind the ultimate session beer. I can't wait til summer (I'll be dripping with sweat 3 months straight) when this beer will be the ultimate refresher beverage."
"taste is incredible. very spicey, hoppy, raisiney, hoppy, salty, hoppy, very leafy, hoppy, citrusy, hoppy, and hoppy again. the hop oils are very impressive. the malts stand straight up in this guy. mouthfeel is very creamy, but when you breath, the alcohol in it seems to cleanse the palate. the drinkability on this is great, but the alcohol is definitely present here. i can't wait to get our idiotic state rules in alabama changed, because when we do, i will always have this guy stocked. plus dfh is a supporter of free the hops, so that makes the beer even more tastier."
"Super drinkable. I think the malt heft compliments the IBUs just right. Belies it's ABV. Nice reward after trying a few horrid ones (other breweries)last night... too good to deny myself"
"Tasted very good. Almost remindes me the taste you get when I bury my head in a pile of hops. Or hop sampling. Nice smooth and big bubbly. The head kept releasing the nice pure hop smell. Not much but some intense hop oily traces. Very pure, this keg wasn't spoiled one bit. Nice solid feel. Very drinkable if you can stand up to the alcohol content."
"P.S. I am now addicted to hops."
"Poured a clear , deep bronze-orange with a bubbly off white head of about a half inch. Nice bands of lacing were left as i drank this hoppy treat. Taken to the nose , hops hit ya like booya beatch! Exellent herbal-green, floral, and fruity fresh smells , as well as a tinge of alcohol. Taste is equally as complex and fresh! Much hop bite , floral-citrus , pine, and a bit of alcohol, tad bit of raisin with a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is kinda creamy with a long lingering aftertaste. This American Double IPA is the best iv'e had so far. It is so drinkable for its ABV. Drinking one of these just makes me say outloud """ Damn i love hops!""" Exellent offering from Dogfish Head."
"This is a drinkable beer, with an excellent taste and aroma. With the higher ABV I cant see myself drinking more than a couple of these in a sitting, but thoroughly enjoying them when I do."
"Most definitely a very distinguished beer. A pleasure to quaff."
"HOLY HOPS!! Classic IPA! Decent lacing down the glass, very malty, and hoppy. Well balanced. Grapefruit and more grapefruit, washing down with the big hop flavor. Very amazing how drinkable it is considering the ABV. Very much recommended, just wish it came in 6 packs. I hate 4 packs!!"
"When I poured in into my Snifter , it came out this nice dark amber/orange color with just a little skim of foam at the top. The foam dissipated fast and left no signs of rings or lace around it. It dissipated so fast that I couldn't tell which color it was. It was more than likely white in color. It had a nice aroma of juicy fruits up front and with some citrus fruits, little malt, and a huge helping of hops at the end. The taste was pretty good. The taste had plenty of different kinds of fruits (too hard to tell which ones were in it), very little malt, and at the end, a very nice strong piny hops flavor. Just the right amount of hops at the end. The mouthfeel was kind of hoppy and I also noticed this slight alcohol aftertaste as well. Just what I would expect from a 9%ABV IPA. Drinkability? I wouldn't mind another one. A 4-pack could go a long ways for me."
"Seek this experience out at all costs!"
"A true winner here I believe. Loads of hops, lots of malt, and a sizeable dose of alcohol that hides itself well."
"I've tasted some great DIPAs ...for me , this one is IT."
"I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't like this beer. Drink if possible."
"For a double IPA, this is not as brutal and aggressive as most; But a DIPA it most definitely is. Wow, what a beer. I see how it's earned the accolates it's ammassed so far."
"A very tasty and drinkable beer in the super IPA Class. I can't give this a 5 rating though because I have had Three Floyds Dreadnaught that defines what a """5"" IPA really tastes like."
"It's a double IPA, so you aren't going to session with this. But this is one of my favorite beers. I don't think you could disagree if you're a fan of this style of beer. Dogfish Head is my favorite brewery because of this, the WWS and the 120 minute. Big, nearly perfect beers, and this is no exception."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass. Pours a clear red-orange with a one inch head that slowly diminishes. Lacing is ok. The smell is citrusy, oily hops that don't dominate like I would have expected them to. There are hints of grain bread in the background. Taste is mild hops that hit first with a weird white bread flavor malt afterwards that finishes with a hint of piney hops. This is not nearly as hoppy as most IPAs I've had recently. The carbonation is perfect and the beer goes down smooth. I would like to try this again. It is a good beer, though it is not what I would turn to if I was dying for some hops. For 9% alcohol, you sure could drink alot of this..."
"Drinkability: If you haven't already, you need to try this. It's been a year since I had it on tap, but clearly I need to have it on tap again. From the bottled version comes this review. Maybe DFH's best beer, also. Near perfection in a bottle, especially with such a style that's not the easiest to squeak beauty out of much of the time."
"Poured it out of the bottle, with minimal head. The appearance had a copperish color to it. In terms of smell, not quite strong. A bit hoppy but subtle. Taste was very surprising. A bit fruity but combined well with the hops. As soon as I drank it, the beer bounced around. Going down, it left a strong but sweet flavor. It fills up the belly fast, so I could only have 2 at most. The best time of the year to have it is in the summertime. It has that summertime feel and taste to it."
"Notes: Certainly another prime example of why DFH is a great innovative brewery. Building off their 60 minute IPA this one is a great brew for hop heads. At 9% the alcohol is so well hidden, almost unnoticable, this could certainly sneak up on you, but absolutly in a good way."
"Drinkability: Very tasty, sensually pleasing, and thoroughly satisfying. The taste encourages having one after another. A bit filling, but negligible. Great beer."
"Have you ever noticed that if you drink some beers (that you previously reviewed positively) after another superior beer, they taste like crap? 90 minute can be consumed first middle or last and it's taste holds up very, very well."
"This is maybe the sixth or seventh time I've had the 90 minute IPA. In the past I didn't really feel like I had anything new to say about this beer. This time though, something was amiss. Poured a perfect amber with a thick head that took a few minutes to settle. Smell was citrusy and very hoppy as well with lots of floral aromas and somewhat spicy towards the end. Tatse was definetly good but nothing in comparison to the other times I've tried this beer. For one, the malty sweetness that initially made me adore this beer was nearly gone. The hop presence was heightened a bit, but even so, it seemed a bit flat. It started off very earthy and tasty and then just seemed to fall flat on its face with no lingering flavors to speak of. Mouthfeel was medium/light (very uncharacteristic for this beer) making it easy to drink. I don't know if this is a new or just plain old crappy batch, but frankly im missing the old 90 minute. To be honest, it tasted more like the 60 minute then the 90. I'll grab it again, but im praying that it wont be like the batch im drinking now and will be like my good ol' friend 90. Cheers"
"An outstanding IPA (Double IPA? IIPA?), and a great way for degenerate hopheads to get their fix."
"Drinkable? Hell yeah!"
"I finally got my hands on some of this stuff after searching everywhere in Western NC. This beer pours a beautiful orange color, with a slight cloudiness. The aroma is of hops, hops and more hops. The taste is unbelievable, with so many flavors coming through. Hops, grapefruit, lemon zest, spices and malt. This is hands down one of the best double IPA's out there. I just hope that it becomes more available in my neck of the woods. Thanks to Brawleys for holding a 4-pack for me."
"Rusty red in color with a thick cream colored 2""" head. Smells like a fresh bouquet of hops. The taste is very smooth, extremely hoppy, a touch of citrus. Very easy drinking, alcohol doesn't come through at all. This is a very smooth beer loaded with hops. Definitely the best IPA I've ever tasted. You can enjoy this brew anytime of year."
"Holy cow, what a beer!!! Thanks to Kinfolks in Manitou Springs for offering this up in bottles. Apparently, I had just missed them having it available on tap. It poured a nice copper color with a one finger head. Picked up some floral aromas. Good citrusy and floral hops with a well balanced maltiness. The ease of drinkability belies the 9% ABV. By far one of the top double IPA's I have ever had. This one tastes so good it could be dangerous if you don't watch out."
"This is a thick IPA that left me with a beer-stache by the time I was done. How does that question go..."""If you were stuck on a deserted island....""" Well, just give me this brew and nothing else on the island and I'm a happy (or should I say hoppy) man!"
"drinkability: very very drinkable"
"Bottle Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a good off white fizzy head, excellent lacing on the glass and mostly lasting. Aroma is hoppy with a touch grain cereal. Some dough, perfumes, plum, and alcohol. At first taste this was acidic, then it warmed a bit, it became sweet with a touch of bitterness. Light to medium body with a creamy texture and somewhat lively. This is a great beer with a higher abv, it will knock you for a loop but its a great trip."
"On tap or bottled, this is equally delicious, and I wish I kept it on hand more often."
"This was my first experience with a 90 minute and I'm starting to worry that I got an old bottle as there wasn't much of a hoppiness to it and it is supposed to be a DIPA, right? There was no discernable date on the bottle though, so I'll just have to assume it's fresh. It begins by pouring a golden ruby color with a very small white head that leaves an oily film behind. It has a very strange aroma, one I haven't come across yet in a beer. It's all malt with an accompanying sweetness, but there's a tang that hits at the conclusion. The taste is a large sticky sweetness due to an overwhelming malt base. There is a fruitiness that contributes to the sweetness. It finishes with a burst of alcohol and a cough syrup element that isn't very appealing. As I mentioned earlier, I can't picuk up any hops, no flavor, no bitterness, nothing. It has a very English barleywine-ish taste with the sticky sweet fruitiness and high alcohol. It's light on carbonation and a bit cloying. The drinkability isn't very good, I had trouble finishing the bottle. I love it's cousin the 60 minute, but I'm not a fan of the 90 minute."
"A beautiful citrus character with orange peel, peaches, and lemon blended with huge hop additions and a biscuity malt presence that is second to none. Extremely hoppy but remarkably well-balanced. On-tap was phenomenal, but the bottles carry the flavor pretty well and aren't too sweet or too bitter. Such an easy-to-drink beer for the ABV and potent character. A true classic."
"Many thanks to my Secret Santa froggyfrog for making this possible!"
"Pours a clear and beautiful reddish amber with a full finger head that faded after a few minutes that fell to faint lacing that is white to off white in color. Immediately gives off heavy aromatic notes of citrusy and piny hops, smells sweetly of caramel yet fresh and clean. This is one hoppy beer, probably the hoppiest I've ever consumed to date. Although the hops are certainly the highlight of this brew, the English two-row barley has certainly erased the majority of the bitterness and hides the alcohol content superbly. Finishes exceptionally clean with hint of a bitter aftertaste. Overall, an outstanding brew."
"This is a very tasty brew. Complex and well-balanced, but easy to drink. Could make a good intro to micros for someone with a taste for slightly bitter beers. It actually seems a little easier to drink than DH's 60 Minute IPA."
"I poured this into a snifter and was pleased by the dark copper color and the slightly off white head. Lacing was good. I let it mellow and warm since it was too cold when I poured it. After a couple minutes, I decided to dive in. The aroma is pleasantly hoppy with a citrus/apricot that makes me think of hefty use of Amarillo and Simcoe. Background notes of pine(?) and spice. Knowing this was a 9% ABV, I was worried that it would be unbalanced but the taste was pleasant with a subtle sweetness with strong hop notes. Malt notes held up to the bitterness. The finish was quick and overall wonderful. This was a wonderfully balanced beer. I just wish I had bought the 4 pack."
"Pours a nice copper color with a 1/2 inch of white head with decent retention. Nice lace on the side of the glass. Smell is of hops and more hops. Some citrus notes but mostly piney hops. The first taste is hops, the pine hops come through very nicely. It balances out with the malt very well though and finishes dangerously smooth. good mouthfeel...medium bodied beer with its drinkabilty being VERY high for such a high ABV beer. Will buy every chance I get"
"12 ounce bottle. Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA pours out a clear copper color with a large head of dense, white foam. Leaves a thick layer of lacing on my glass. Pungent oily hop aroma with sharp whiffs of alcohol. Juicy hop flavor with oily, piney hops. Malt provides a nice balance, but this is clearly a beer for hopheads. A little bit of butterscotch flavor too. Full mouthfeel. Drinkability is insanely high for a 9% beer. One of my favorite ipas, and it's even better on tap than in the botte. Best when fresh."
"Bottled on 12/5/05. Poured a rich, thick, lasting head w/excellent lacing. Clear orange/yellow hue. Heavy rich hop aroma with a slight hint of burnt malts. Almost a belgian type yeast taste at the beginning followed by a white wine taste on the palate with the sweetness lingering for an extended period of time. Hops really came out more in the aftertaste. Overall, I was surprised by the sweetness of this IPA which made it different from others that I have tasted in the past."
"shoulda stuck to these all nite. prolly coulda avoided the vomiting that came later that nite. man i wasted some perfectly good beer..."
"Pours a perfect copper and makes a very nice white head, has superb retention and makes a very good ammount of Belgian lacing on my glass. Very sweet, floral hop fragrance strong notes of citrus and pine. Explosion of hops across the tongue, sweet green raisins, candied citrus fruit, congnac, huge complexity yet very balanced between the hops and sweet caramel malts. Medium to full bodied, a bit syrupy as it goes down, finishes with a sticky, warming alcoholic bite. Aside from the thick palate, this is really a great beer. I am quite fond of the Dogfish yeast strain, it makes for a number of interesting flavors. I'm glad I brought back a whole lot of this stuff from my trip."
"beer is very drinkable, but i most enjoy it on cold nights."
"Pours a glowing sunshine golf with a tight, fizzy head which leaves lots of lacing. Nose is of course hoppy with lots of piney scents, although there is more malt than expected in the background. Taste was hoppy but less so than expected, not quite the oily-juicy texture I get from a Ruination...this is still delicious but i feel it is just slighty lesser than Ruination for the style."
"Musings: I am not a huge Dogfish fan. I think some of their brews are overrated. I drank this new bottling because I couldn't resist. I'll keep a few in the dark for another year or so and see what happens. I can't imagine the tastes can get any better. A highly enjoyable APA that bests Ruination IMHO."
"Got this on tap at my local bar. The initial pint that i got was too cold because they gave it to me in a frozen mug so my initial taste was a little off. But after a couple of them i got a good feel for it. It poured out a deep orange color, unfortuantley not much of a head because of the way the barkeep poured it. A very piney, hoppy smell. First sip is bitter to the tounge but not overpowering. Very crisp. Can definatley put a couple of these down and enjoy every one."
"The beer had a somewhat cloudy appearance to it. The color was a orangish burgundy shade. The smell was very fruity. The head lasted as long as the beer did. The taste was of hops but not as much as you would think. There was another taste thrown in. Odd as it may sound, this beer had hints of a bannanna milkshake in there too. The alcohol is very well hidden in this brew. The mouthfeel is good considering the high ABV. Drinkability is good for one or two glasses but nothing beyond that. This is not a session beer. I will have this again on occasion."
"12 oz bottle. Crystal clear golden orange hue with dense off-white head. Nose is massive citrus blossom and sweet caramelly malts. The taste reveals a certain even-handedness of gigantic malts and orange/grapefruit hoppiness, but there's something missing. I think it's that there's no """middle""" flavor, specifically the rounded peach fruitiness that can really pull everything together in such a big IPA. This isn't a bitter hop monster a la Ruination, but the citric flavor is still there. Even so, there's a thick crystal malt sweetness that just becomes more cloying as the bottle progresses. Medium thick body, slick alcoholic and syrupy mouthfeel. I used to think this was amazing, and I'm not sure whether it's the beer or my palate that has changed. In any case, I can think of a few other DIPAs that I'd rather be drinking. Not bad, but certainly far from astounding."
"Minimally cloudy with an orange-amber hue, this brew pours with only a bit of foam yet moderate carbonation bubbling to the surface. I can smell a sugary sweetness with plenty of hops. The flavor is a nice balance- a decent amount of sweet brown sugary malt, with a nice grassy bitterness to follow it up. After a few drinks the bitter comes on even stronger and lingers for quite awhile. It's got a smooth, medium body with adequate carbonation. This beer goes down nicely and hides the 9% alcohol content well."
"Pours a cloudy orange, medium off white head forms with some thick lace and nice legs. Smell is pine, caramel, chocolate, citrus, floral, and some alcohol, super hops. Taste is caramel, wicked pine, floral, and a bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, low carbonation, alcohol warmth and super smooth. This one has smoothed out because its been sitting around since last february. It has lost some hops but I still have my memories of it before, wicked DIPA."
"I decided to treat myself and splurge on a four pack. Very expensive- 13.99 for this four pack. Might I say the most expensive American beer I have bought. Regardless, I intended to enjoy this. I did. What a wonderful brew. The hop bitterness bites first, but a nice citrus quality emerges aftger a few sips, especially as is mellows in the glass and the temperature rises. For such a strong beer, it was surprisingly mellow, and well balanced. It goes down easily and is warming. The alcohol content can catch up on you. I really love this beer. If it were not for the price, I would always have some on hand."
"This is a good beer and I'm glad I bought it (the woman in front of me at Whole Foods remarked that it must be good presumably because of the price), but I actually prefer the 60 minute IPA, a less filling beer with a much better flavour."
"THE east coast double IPA. This is a fantastic beer."
"Excellent drinkability. Deserving of its rating, this is one of the best DIPAs in the U.S.. Delicious indeed. Nectar is the only way to describe it."
"Overall such a great beer. I wish i could get this locally. seems like a perfect beer for any cold weather, can take place of any winter warmer or even barleywine, if you can handle the hops."
"Pours a very clear copper. The off-white two finger head is dense and creamy, holds up extremely well and leaves patches of sticky lace. The aromas of american hops are strong; citrus and grass with sweet malt and some fusels becoming more apparent as the head settles to a thin cap. Apple and orange esters visciously smacks your tastebuds first, then mellows out to a soft dark wheat flavor. Grassy hops then dominate the semi-dry aftertaste but never balance out the taste which is more overwhelmingly sweet than pleasently bitter. The body is medium and the tiny rushing carbonation tries to smooth the mouthfeel but the finish is almost more residual sweet than dry and bitter. Still a decent brew, but I can't say the D.I.P.A. style was well represented."
"The taste was about the same, extremely intense hop floralness, malt and some sweet undertones. This is not for the faint of heart. This is an IPA lovers beer, but I do excourage anyone curious to at least give it a try. Dogfish head most certainly knows what they're doing."
"For someone who loves a DIPA, I was a little disappointed, but this is not a bad beer. Probably a bit too malty and heavy for me. Pours a clear amber color, looks deceptively light. Hop aroma is great; like sweet berries and pine. Flavor is smooth, maple syrupy, and caramely witha touch of brandy. Mouthfeel is a little thick, syrupy."
"Notes: While the smell makes my mouth water, the citrus/piney taste wash it away. A very solid beer, but the 60 Minute is more for me."
"All in all a colossally drinkable beer. Absolutely friggin delicious, if you haven't tried it, please add it to your agenda. I am certainly not a hophead at this point in my career, but I found it marvelous."
"Well this is everyhting that a DIPA should be. The color is slightly dark amber color and gives up a white head that is hanging out. Smell is full of raw hops and has a hint of alcohol to mingle with the big malt sweetness sticking out. Wonderfully balacned with the emphasis on the hops but still enough from the caramel maltyness and alcohol to make this one a good drinker and a constant farvorite from the days of the 750ml bottles."
"This beer poured a dark honey color with one inch of heavy white foam. My nose was filled with strong scents of hops, grapefruit and alcohol, with a slight hint of candy sugar. Very complex taste dominated by pleasantly bitter hops and alcohol. The finish is dry and clean with an aftertaste reminiscent of apple cider. Fantastic DIPA."
"Not only is this my favorite IPA, I would rank it in my top 5 favorite brews (at least at the moment) Unfortunately, however, I find it tastes much better on draught, but it is a rare find. I usually stick to buying the 4 packs."
"This is a very drinkable DIPA to a fault. It will get you smashed if you don't pace yourself with this one. That in itself is hard because it is so good and leaves you wanting more."
"And satiated."
"Good beer."
"Really an exceptional IPA here. Reminds me a lot of Stone's Ruination IPA, which is to be taken as a compliment. Pours a very pretty dark golden body with a tight, foamy head. Smell is just wonderful: caramel, currents, hops, and plenty of alcohol. Taste is solid, with nice rich malt undertones. Very smooth in the mouth, but watch out, cause this baby's packin' a 9% ABV..."
"Drinkability: This beer is easy to drink inspite of 9% abv. Dam this is good and I wish I had much more. When I drank this beer about six months ago I absolutely hated this beer. By all the beer Gods I want more."
"Drinkabality: This is one of my favorite IIPAs'. Goes down way too easy. Nicely balanced IMO. I could drink a bunch of these if the 9% alcohol wouldn't kick my ass. A definite must buy for those who haven't had the opportunity to try this fine IIPA."
"Poured a golden brown color out of a 12 ounce bottle. Wonderful aromatic head with lots of lacing. Heavy floral aroma (wet grass?) with a subtle fruity character (grapes?). Very hoppy nose but not overly bitter like some IPA's can be. A smooth malt character to the smell as well. Not much of an aftertaste, which can be difficult with a beer at 9% ABV. So, this is once again a very delectable offering from Dogfish Head. I will definitely try to find this one again."
"It has a nice mouthfeel and it the easiest to drink double IPA I have had."
"A terrific IPA. The alcohol will sneak up on you without even knowing it."
"A dark, burnt golden color with off-white head that clings to the glass leaving behind some lacing. Aromas of malt, hops, citrus, and alcohol seem to be present. The taste is flavorful with a hop profile that dominates despite the malt presence. Very similar in taste to the 60-minute IPA except the higher ABV and a slightly more bitter aftertaste. Crisp feeling in the back of my throat along with a warming alcohol sensation. A very enjoyable brew that goes down easy."
"Alcohol, hops, and grapefruit open up the flavor. Following perfectly is a malt/molasses blend that feels like velvet. I love this brew."
"Truly delectable for the hop lover. Randall makes 90 minute a special treat for those lucky enough to find it."
"The mouthfeel is almost perfect. Good carbonation. It's amazingly drinkable for the level of hops and alcohol, but one is quite enough. Great beer."
"Drinkable? Yes, but high on the abv side."
"Pours a ruddy orange with a foamy head that leaves lace and a firm table. Smell is hops...and then more hops...pine, citrus rind, kind of scary. But the alarm bells were unwarranted. For a hop monster like this, it is shockingly smooth. While I never tasted """malt""" per se, I did feel that something was holding the hops back from blistering my uvula. Mouthfeel was oily and full. Only suffers from such a high ABV and the serious damage that the hops do to the palate after a full bottle. Tasty. Have one."
"Overall: Fairly tasty, however it doens't reflect what one expects from a """huge""" IPA. it is more """imperial""" than IPA. I would lable this an imperial pale not an IPA. This doesn't live up to the BIG IPA hype."
"Poured for me into a brandy snifter at Tria in Philadelphia. What an excellent beer. A beautiful color. Amber turning into ruby with hints of brown. Head there, but not too too much. Hops on full display but not bitter. The other hop qualities are on display here and this makes it quite drinkable , esp. relative to the alcohol percentage. Malt is noticeable. You want to get more so you can examine the hops in more detail."
"Drinkability: While I will truly enjoy this one, I won't run back to the fridge for another. That being said, this one is going down quitewell."
"This one is to be savored and enjoyed. It's an old standby for me, but definitely not a session double. Comparatively, it's not the most well-rounded version of teh style, but it's unique in its own right."
"Drinkability: 9% alcohol.. Hmmm. Where is this alcohol, again? Oh. There it is. I feel good. This beer is so drinkable, it scares me. Good thing for 4 packs, huh?"
"I am a LOVER of IPA's and this is by far one of the most amazing if not best IPA's that I have every had. I would NEVER have guessed that this is a 9% ABV beer. I would recommend this beer to anyone who is a true lover of beers. I am just at a sheer loss of words for how good this beer really is."
"So very drinkable, but at 9% slightly dangerous."
"Thanks Len!"
"Mouthfeel is substantial and fulfilling. As I swallow another sip, I again marvel how well balanced the beer is. I would classify the beer more as an English double IPA as the hops are more restrained and used in proportion with the malt. This isn't the hop bomb that I anticipated but is, nevertheless, a very well crafted and enjoyable ale."
"My verdict: buy some. Disappointment in unlikely. Drinking more is inevitable."
"If you are a true hop-head, than this is the Mecca of beers for you. This poured a golden amber range color with a slight head that relaxed into good lacing. The nose is an absolute punch in the face of hops, hops, nutty malts, hops and hops. THe taste is a bitter roll of hops searing the tongue. It's absolute heaven in a bottle. I've ben a hopper for a while, this is my flagship."
"All around wonderful beer from Dogfish Head."
"Scary drinkable for a 9% brew... I much prefer this over the 60min, not that that's a bad brew either... this is just exceptional."
"A pedestrian clear amber, but blessed with a wonderful fluffy, soapy white head and great lacing, the 90 Minute IPA is really attractive. It smells and tastes a lot like Anchor Liberty ale, I think--quite hoppy, yet with a strong sweet and creamy malt character for balance. Alcohol is a non-factor, hidden perfectly. A full, creamy mouthfeel rounds off what I recognize now to be an extremely tasty IPA, and a remarkably drinkable one given its ABV."
"But this is definitely a nice beer and would recommend to anyone."
"Pours a dark amber with a tall khaki head and the best lacing I've seen yet in a beer. Smell is insanely intense floral/herbal hops, some tropical fruit, and as it warms, malted barley. Taste starts with a strong hop kick, but not nearly as intense as I would have expected from the nose, considerably sweet caramel malts, and subtle pineapple/passionfruit notes. I can't believe how balanced they managed to make this beer with the ridiculous amount of hops they claim to throw in this stuff. This stuff really caught me by surprise. The hops and alcohol are immaculately balanced by an equally ridiculous amount of barley. This is really a treat. Dogfish Head, you had me at hello."
"I liked this ok but not the world class DIPA i thought it would be."
"12 ounce bottle. Purchase a 4 pack at Brawley's in NC...heck yeah!"
"Thanks (sort of) to rapopoda for going to the trouble of hand carrying this out to the Golden State."
"Big alcohol, slickly sweet, good if you want to get loaded...quick."
"This beer just pulls itself down your throat. If it weren't for the sour kick at the tail end, I'd say this could replace the water in my tap."
"what a great brew. the buzz will catch you after only a couple, but it is so damn smooth you can't help but give in. i could drink a bunch of these despite being quite wasted afterwards. i'm so impressed with this brew, it is a completely different world from the 60 minute which i also thought was great. now the 60 is great for what it is, but this double IPA thing is its own realm entirely."
"Drinkability. My wife a certified hop head passed it over and ordered a Harpoon, and I drank it (cause I was paying the tab)..."
"A phenomenal IPA. Pours a crisp, clear, red color into my imperial pint glass, growing a 1-finger beige-colored head that dissipates quickly but leaves lacing. Aroma of good hops is prevalent, with juicy red apple and spicy clove on top of the nutty barley malt. This ale is a masterpiece - a ludicrous amount of hops is perfectly balanced by tons of barley malt, making for a exquisitely tasty IPA. Not too bitter, but bitter enough to be just perfect. Mouthfeel is smooth and buttery, a little low on the carbonation side, but that makes it more authentic. An excellent ale if you're in the mood for something hoppy, but it's 9% ABV doesn't lend to drinking a whole 4-pack of these."
"+"
"A good example of a good style from a good brewer. Nothing to kill for, but certainly worth a try."
"Palate- Rich and mouthfilling, but the hops keep it from being the least bit cloying. Notes of grapefruit marmalade. Smooth dark brown sugar flavors (this reminds me a bit of a barleywine, but in an IPA package. Perfect balance, and a long finish. There is no overt evidence of alcohol, but it's rich enough to make you slow down a bit."
"Mmmm. Pours a bright light orange hue capped by a half-inch creamy head that's going nowhere fast. Light carbonation persists throughout the experience. Dry aroma of spicy fresh hops, orange peel, ale yeast, and a touch of mustiness. The palate is...I don't know how to say. """One of the most pleasing things that has ever caressed my tongue""" doesn't really convey it. A smooth, creamy, slightly buttery body holds a huge hop presence up front, redolent with lupulin. A touch of sweet caramel malt comes through mid-palate, finishing with a lasting bitterness. Notes of orange, grass, and tart ale yeast are present. Good lord, I love this beer."
"This will be gone in waaay less than 90 minutes. Real awesome."
"Another great beer from dogfish head.This beer starts out coppery clear with a two finger head that is very strong, great looking.A very strong fragrant smell with citrus aromas dominating this beer.The taste is very strong and crisp with hops totally the leading flavor here. The flavor is creamy making this awesome and very drinkable for a high alcohol beer. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing perfectly. It would be a challenge to find a beer better than this. Excellant."
"Bought 12 ounce bottle bought at Whole Foods for $2.50, celebrating North Carlolina popping the cap. Poured a clear amber color. Decent light brown head, not as massive head as expected. Nice piney hop smell. Wow a smooth clean hop and sweet malt taste, can tell this one is higher alcohol. First sip was great, but the power and sweetness caught up with me. This is definitely a sipping beer. I can't imagine the 120 minute!"
"cheers..."
"I can see myself getting this beer once again, Dogfish Head crafted another fine brew."
"Deep amber color and a massive rich head. Sticky lacing is all over the glass. The aroma is very hoppy but yet balanced out with sweet grapefruit and citrus. Plenty of fruit flavor, biscuity malts, and pine like hoppy flavor. Sweet alcoholic back ground and finishes dry. Fruitiness lingers for a bit on the tongue. Great drinkablity and very potent. This is by far one the best IPA's I have ever had."
"Drinkablitiy is awesome. I can't think of anything to dislike about this beer."
"Certainly """off-centered""" as the Dogfish Head motto suggests, and in a good way. This is the best east coast IPA I've had! It'll be a regular in my refrigerator. You have to try this one in a snifter or maybe an oversized wine glass, a regular pint glass just doesn't do it justice. A must-try."
"I haven't had very many DFH beers, but this is my favorite one thus far."
"I was not let down in this area either. I good belch to me is one that tastes as you would think putting a hop flower into your mouth would taste. This beer has a very flavorfull belch on multiple leavels."
"Overall, I find this excellent and very drinkable. I could probably put down a few very easily, but won't, as I would rather savor them."
"I was really expecting something different. I had tried the 60 Minute and just expected more of the same with a bigger hop bite. But the 90 Minute really shattered my vague expectations. There really isn't anything like it out there. DFH has produced a unique masterpiece with this beer, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something out of the ordinary."
"And this from a hop head and IPA lover."
"Nice. Well this one pours a copper color with a nice light head which will lace the glass thorough. It smells like citrus and apricots. The taste is strong but not overpowering it is of fruits and hops has a tartness with a warm full body feel. The mouthfeel is smooth. A drinkable beer indeed. Impressive"
"The mouthfeel is syrupy and coating, though not too thick considering how much it tastes like honey and molasses. Has a contact dryness from the astringency of the alcohol as well as the hops. Evidently the hops are there, but they are hiding behind the attempt at balancing the bitter out with some sweet. It is too overwhelming to be drinkable. I love my IPA's, and I love it when brewers get a bit experimental with their recipes, but nothing can come close to the refreshing taste of a more """traditional""" American IPA."
"-UF"
"WOW this beer is awesome. Pours a clear golden yellow, not much of a head, but leaves some nice lacing. This beer has an different scent than other IPAs I've had, barley, hops, nutty, fruity, and spicy. The scent hits you the second you open the bottle. I really like the taste, kinda sweet with a little bite at the end. The body is light. For a 9% ABV beer you would never know it, Dogfish Head hid the alcohol very well. This is a very highly recommended brew."
"Pours a crystal copper color with a frothy tan head that retains well and lively carbonation rising to the top. Aroma is big, juicy hops; citrus (mainly grapefruit with hints of lemon and orange rind) and a slight piney smell as well as a lightly sweet caramel background. The flavor begins with a nice juicy hops profile with big citrusy grapefruit, slightly floral and mineraly, piney, and herbal flavors, followed by sweet caramel and lightly bready malt character to balance. The finish is drying and fairly bitter, but less so than your typical DIPA which makes it all the more drinkable. The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a big body and the drinkability is pretty good ( i can only think of one other DIPA more drinkable...thank you Stoudt's), alcohol is noticeable but not intrusive and this is one of the few DIPA's I could drink more than one of in a session...very nice beer by DFH"
"Poured a slightly hazy orange - copper color with small white head. I smell some sweet grapefruit and that is about it. Slightly bitter, actually just right, then some citrus and then the sweet malts take over. Low carbonation, there is an oily feel to this from the hops. It is quite drinkable even with the somewhat high alcohol content. Nothing dominates here but it all goes together very well."
"Poured a hazy bronze color with a small white head. Lace clings to the side of the glass while drinking. Strong smell of hops followed by citrus. Smells amazing. The hops hit you first then the taste of malt kicks in to bring balance. The taste is right up there with the smell, its fantastic. Incredibly smooth. Maybe the smoothest IPA I've tasted. A subtle warming feel in the back of the throat from the alcohol. Quite drinkable for its strength. An amazing IPA that I would recommend to anyone."
"I like the lack of American style hops, which offers a different version for this style. Heavier than others I've had, which I have a mixed reaction to."
"Even ay the high ABV, I could drink this all the time."
"Pours a semi-cloudy bronze color with a small, creamy white head. The aroma is huge. Fruity, herbal, slightly grassy. Very relaxing. The flavor is as big as the aroma. Hops are everywhere. The mouthfeel is slightly less than full bodied.. Overall, this brew is truely wonderful. I only wish it were available in Minnesota."
"Okay, two years ago I would have had nothing to do with the 90 minute. How two years and 200 plus reviews can change a man's taste. This is one of the best beers I've tried hands down. Geat balance of extra hops and malts. The alcohol doesn't overpower the taste or smell. Nice orange-copper hue with good carbonation and head. Without eating anything for 8 hours before, this one actually gave me a nice rush. I'm not sure if I could handle the 120 minute yet. Can't wait to see this around North Carolina soon."
"MF/D: For a IIPA this is very drinkable. As long as you sip it."
"overall- not what i was expecting from this beer. extremely well balanced and smooth taste. the hop presence is definitely there but doesnt stand out so much that it hurts the drinkability. to bad this stuff costs $10 a 4 pack."
"Pours a beautiful amber with nice frothy white head, about 1 inch, which slowly recedes leaving some nice lacing. Nice pungeant smell of sweet malt and spicy hops. There are also some fruit complexities going on here too. Smells very nice and very enticing. Taste is definitely mostly delicious spicy hops but there is also a lot of sweet malt here which tries to balance it out, but fails. The effort of the malt does not go unappreciated however- it results in a nice sweetness underneath all those wonderful hops. A little bit of alcohol can be detected in the finish but it hides the 9% quite well. Very nice mouthfeel - heavy but not syrupy and just the right amount of carbonation. Also this is very easy to drink despite its high ABV. Dangerous, and spectacular, stuff."
"I would say this is a highly drinkable beer even with a 9% ABV. I highly recommend it."
"This is not my favorite double IPA, but it's close, and it's very, very pleasant. Worth seeking out."
"this doesn't blow your doors off, it knocks with assurance and walks right into the parlor, and sits down to make a deal. The deal is this: After a couple of buttery scones with lemon curd and fresh cream we're gonna dance around a bowl of mixed greens with orange vinegarette, and mandarin orange garnish. Then we will agree that this is a defining double IPA. There are bigger and badder IIPAs, but if this was the standard babies would cry less."
"As another reviewer remarked, prepare to get your ass kicked if you're not prepared for this beer. This isn't your run of the mill IPA or double IPA, this beer packs some serious hop punch. The 120 minute is even hoppier, which boggles the mind. Pours a deep copper, nice dense head. Intense floral hop aromas, there's no mistaking what this beer is. Taste is frighteningly hoppy yet smooth, with a huge kick in the end. Mouthfeel is creamy yet almost harsh at the same time. Quite drinkable if you're a hop head, not so much if your not, but still a wonderful beer."
"This beer hurts. But its a good hurt. Anytime I really want to get my ass kicked by a beer I buy this. Pours a pale gold with a nice finger of head but doesn't lace too well or retain its head that great. You can smell this beer from across the room- smells like spice and smoke with intense herbal hoppiness. Tastes the same with an addition of some malty thickness in the far background- I actually described this to someone as tasting somewhat like smoked ham. Has a really nice medium body to it- not so watery like some IPAs. I think this and the Great Divide have claim to the quintessential double IPA"
"Opinion: This is a very well crafted beer! It is easily a contender with the best of them...in it's own category the way it reacts with your senses is unique, much like a Berliner Weisse. This beer over-utilizes the hop presence like a Berliner Weisse over-utilizes the tart character from it's fermentation. They are both deserving of respect."
"Hell yeah, I've moved out of Iowa and now have access to oodles of incredible beers, including DFH products. Bottle obtained from a local liquor store and consumed a couple evenings later. Pours thick and silent. Not a sound. Almost no head forms, just a ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a nearly clear rust-orange. Smells mild compared to what I expected. Malty sweet with some citrusy hops and fruity esters (pumpkin, apricot, peach). Some pine aroma upon later sniffs. Tastes really malty smooth with noticable hop orange and some grapefruit pith flavor. An alcohol sting hides behind hop clouds, partly successful because fruity esters tease my tastebuds as a distraction. Nectarine and apricot ride both a volatile aromatic and a clingy oil. Hop bitter comes across as low, as does co-ho hop roughness, but the beer is thick and sugary sweet...I think these hop characteristics have simply been kept in check by equally bold malt. Thick and smooth moutfeel and mildly carbonated. This beer is wonderful."
"It's hard to believe I haven't reviewed this beer before. I'm drinking one of a 4-pack of 12 oz bottles - do they make the 750ml corked version anymore? 90 Minute IPA pours a deep golden color with a hint of red and a white head that quickly fades to a lacing on the glass. Aroma is full of citrusy hop goodness, with a healthy dose of pine thrown in for good measure. Taste is all hops, all the time, with just enough malt to give a slight toasted flavor and a medium to full body. Carbonation is light. This is a delicious double IPA, and I'm glad that I know a place to get it in NH now (even if it is an hour away)."
"Well balanced, well liked, recommended."
"Mouthfeel is quite good. Very smooth, almost creamy in it's body. Hop bitterness is obviously evident but is coupled well with the malts to obtain an almost sweet finish. This is a very quenching brew. Hops resonate in all their oily glory. Insanely drinkable for a 9% IPA, this could easily become a regular in my session lineup. Packaging boasts that this is America's best IPA. Whether or not that is true is to be determined, but this is an excellent example of the style."
"Had a 12 oz bottle which was poured into a pint glass. Poured a nice, very clear orange, copper color. Head faded quickly but had excellent lacing. The hops aroma was extremely intense, but in a good way. Had a woody aroma with slight citrus notes. I thought the taste came off a bit harsh initially but smoothed out over time. It tasted very crisp, clean, and refreshing but the overwhelming hop flavor may not be for everyone."
"Taste is variations on the first sip. Goes something like this: hoppy burn, alcohol burn, sticky rich malt. Rinse. Repeat. OK the alcohol burn is understated and slow to build which actually make it quite warming in the gullet. The hops are an explosion and actually burn the tongue a bit like a good habenero sauce would. There is some citrus in there but mostly bitingly bitter herbal hop flavors. The malt is rich and sweet, molasses, burnt caramel and such. Mouth is sticky, the hops for all their glory do tend to get washed on the tongue by the considerable malt but do linger on the roof of the mouth forever. And your teeth. Great stuff, did this one right they did."
"This is one of the better DIPA's I've ever had. Not as hoppy as Three Floyd's Dreadnaught, but very well balanced, and awesome in its own way."
"overall: this beer was my love at first sight with IIPA's. first one i ever had and has never let me down since. almost perfect."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and is lightly carbonated."
"This is worth the price. Treat yourself to this delight and get ready as 4 of these will put you on your butt. A very short session beer, I usually drink just one at the end of the evening."
"I give the 90 minute Imperial IPA my best score ever. Pick up a 4 pack of these and you will not regret it. Also support Dogfish Head whenever possible so they can continue to brew these malty wonders!"
"I had the 120 minute IPA before this and absolute loved it. However due to its strength one is more then enough. This younger brother is absolute fantastic though. Upon opening the bottle it get stone fruit from the noise mostly apricot, but an entire sweet aroma is there. The head is thin and fades pretty fast but being an IPA I dont expect much of one. The biggest thing to me though is I can feel the care that went into this brew. You can tell that however master minded this brew cares and knows about what is going on in the bottle and wants to make sure the fullest amount of enjoyment is achieved by ever person that buys this brew."
"Self Note: Avery Maharaja matches this one and is 1/3 price."
"Pours a dark orange with a nice 2 inch head that retains very well. Nose is fruity with floral hops and a slight hint of alcohol. Taste is very malty, fruity, finishing with a nice smooth floral hop. Mouthfeel is full and extremely creamy, especially the on-tap version. Overall drinkability is great. The high ABV is well masked."
"This IPA pours a beautiful golden color, it leaves a nice sticky white lace that sticks to the side of the glass. The smell is of hops, lemon, sweet fruit. I let this beer sit for a minute to bring out more flavor and aroma, and as I put it back to my nose more floural and spicey aromas became present. As I tasted this beer I let the beer sit on my palate and so many delicious flavors came to mind, a smoothe, malty, hoppy finish. The taste is carmalized fruits, grape, peaches, caramel, and kick of hops. You can't even taste the 9% abv. This is the best IPA, actually one of the best beers I've had the priviledge of tasting."
"D- Very good, goes down nice and smooth. I might have to watch myself and make sure I don't drink the other three by myself"
"The smell is strong and full of hops. Pine is dominant. The taste is very good, bringing bitterness on top of a big and solid malt base. The mouthfeel is solid and appealing, while the drinkability is good."
"Poured an amber-orange color with a large white foamy head. Smell is of HOPS (wow), with pine and citrus notes. The taste of extreme hops follows through. And leaves a magnificent dry after-taste. Great mouth feeel. If you like (or love) hops you will love this beer."
"Thanks Gabe!"
"As it hits my mouth it's syrupy smooth with minor hop flavors attached through every moment of taste impression. The same grassy, slightly spicey, slightly floral hops that make up part of the aroma permeate the entire duration of the flavor profile. Toasty malt syrup melded with floral hops? Perhaps a bit of tannic harshness in the very back, barely perceptible - I guess that's what you get from such a long hop boil. Interesting... Overall, very low hop bitterness for a DIPA, and actually low hop flavor and aroma too, but the flavor and aroma are so expertly intertwined with the malt flavors that I can't deny that this is an excellent beer. It's just one that is so different from the standard DIPA that I've grown used to."
"All in all, this is a very enjoyable beer, and is a great after-dinner dessert beverage. It is thick, and something that one can sit and savor."
"Pours a lovely golden orange color with a minimal head. Laces easily down the glass during its quick demise. Mellow, appealing nose with subtle hoppiness. Beautifully balanced taste with the hops being prevalent but not overwhelming. Smooth, luscious mouthfeel, just right. The alcohol is really hidden well in this beer. I would never have guessed it to be 9% from the taste. But after drinking a few, you will definitely know that this is a high alcohol brew. Outstanding!"
"The Dogfish 90 minute pours an orange honey hue with a very small white head, lacing is very scarce. The aroma is very complex, the tart fruit from the hops will arrive followed by a very soft berry, the alcohol is present, hints of earthy grain. The taste is emaculate, hints of fresh picked berries with the sweet caramel malt, backing up this will be the pine/citrus taste from the hopped, alcohol looming. Medium bodied and complex. Very drinkable, but as far as a session, might want to watch out, alcohol will sneak up on you. I found this to go great with a greek sandwich."
"Impression: A well balanced, well aged IIPA. Very complex and satisfying. There is a flavor in there for all beer lovers. One worth stocking the frige with."
"Mmmm"
"The high abv hurts the drinkability a bit, but the flavor makes you want more."
"wow. This is a great beer. Pours a beautiful gold to reddish amber with a nice head, and wonderful lace. The aroma is big, a nice floral bouquet, very inviting. Flavor, top niotch, balanced hop attack on your mouth, but not at all bitter, and wheres the alcohol, deceptively hidden at a wopping 9%. i really enjoy this beer, two days after i finally tried it, it is on my bars beer list. This beer is a great treat once a week for a nice sippin hop experience!"
"Poiurs a clear dark orange with two fingers of white head, good retention, and lacing all the way down. Aroma is heavy resiny hops with some notes of citrus. Taste is full of hops as expected, citrus and grapefruit hops hitting upfront and a drier pinier bitterness that ligers afterwords. Throughout, the intense hoppinesss is balanced with a strong biscuity malt flavor. This beer is very full bodied, with a smooth creamy mouthfeel. This is one of the best IPAs out there."
"Dark orange-amber, off-white 1/2 inch head that laced all the way down. The hops on the nose are near exceptional (as in 5 = exceptional) with a bit of citrus. Tastes about the same and is really smooth for the ABV. No discernable aftertaste. This will certainly make a regular re-buy on my list, excellent IPA in a market flooded with substandards."
"Bottle: Poured a medium brown color ale with a larger then average head with good retention. Aroma is very floral with some bitterness coming from the abundance of hops. Taste is a well balance between floral and sweet hops and bitter aftertaste. Body if bit thinner then expected but alcohol is well hidden. Great beer but not as well balances the Dreadnaught I had last week."
"The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, and chewy. Overall, a good brew I'm glad I was able to try and hope to be able to try again."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle kindly sent by kafkaEsb. No freshness date. Gorgeous clear dark golden amber, with white frothy one-finger head. Nose is sweet citrus, grapefruit juice all-through. A bit of grassiness hiding there behind the citrus. Taste surprised me- much more of a malt backbone than I was expecting, quickly met by a grapefruit citrus hops that persisted and hung on the tongue and palate. Mouthfeel was full, chewy, a bit oily, not a dry finish. I liked it. Definitely some alcohol in there, but I like the hops and I find this one very drinkable. Wish I had another."
"Sparkling freshness is also litle missed in taste and with that litle sweet. Further again wonderfull with some ambermalt before a huge but fine bitterness comes that's not hanging. In aftertaste there stays this nice dryhopping taste with nice flowery note. More then just a good brew IMO and thanks Jason, think you made me a wonderfull box!"
"Drinkability: For a high ABV and complexity, this goes down easy. Only thing that keeps it from a 5 is I don't think I could get up to get more after 2 or so!"
"Among the Dogfish Head IPAs, the 90 minute is perfect for this hop head. Sturdier in the hop than the 60 minute, but not to the point of being sticky and cloying like the 120 minute, this ale holds together well through the sip and trip down the gullet, with a strong grapefruit hop start and finish. There is balance as well, and before the hop finish, the two-row malt asserts itself, making for a balanced brew. You can taste the 9% alcohol, especially in the finish, but it's not unpleasant, giving a nice kick to go along with the hop heaven. The copper tones and solid body complete a pleasant IPA experience."
"Drinkability: Wonderful brew, but I sure wouldn't want more than one; there is a lot going on and this beer demands that you pay attention to it"
"After the 60 Minute (which I was disappointed in) I can't say I had high expectations, but this was pretty dammed good. I didn't like the strong alcohol finish, but like a bum knee, I could learn to live with it."
"This is one of the most drinkable beers in its class, and an example of how unlike beers can be and still be exceptional (I'm thinking of Dreadnaught, a wonderful but very different double IPA). In the running for """best in class"""."
"Overall = one of the best IPA's I've ever tried. Amazing. If you're a fan of this style, you just have to get your hands on some."
"12 oz. with no freshness or bottling date - served slightly chilled in a snifter. Pours an amber/orange that is perfectly clear with very active carbonation and is topped with an off-white 1 finger head that leaves nice patches of lace. Strong tropical aroma - oranges, grapefruit, and pineapple, along with biscuits and piney/leafy/herbal hops (I can almost smell the bitterness). By the end of the beer there are notes of caramel and bananas. The first sip shows a sweetness up front followed by a barrage of hops. Well balanced - doesn't seem like 90 IBUs. The flavors are the same as the aroma - even the caramel and banana finish. It is full bodied and the flavors linger on the palate forever (I'm having pine and grapefruit burps). The mouthfeel is smooth at the beginning and keeps improving from there. It warms your chest and will numb your mouth if you swish it around long enough. One of my favorites - I could drink this every day and not get tired of it."
"This is one complex bottle, beautiful toasty scent. Lots o Hops. NOT a chugger, mind you, a sipper and better as it warms. I feel guilty whenever I pop one open. Todd says drink what you like, but this, needs a special occasion. High alcohol, make it the last of a session. I don't get too crazy for many of Dogfish Head beers (Got some Burton Baton Waiting 10 years! YES!), but between this and the sixty, no contest. Go for the 90, cheap bastard!"
"Simply exceptional. Im not particularly crazy about IPAs, especially Double IPAs, but this one is just amazing. Most American Double IPAs are intensely hoppy and bitter, but lack a malty balance. Not with this beer; the rich malty sweetness and the intense hop flavor of this brew make it a real treat, not to mention the smooth mouthfeel. Delicious and flavorful. Highly recommended!"
"Drinkability: Hop heads will get there fix here! Marvelously bitey. Anymore kick to it and I think it would detract from the overall experience by wearing out your taste buds. Excellent beer that I recommend to all beer lovers that like the hoppy stuff."
"Overall: I enjoyed this DFH beer as they put quality and interesting brews, but by no means is it my favorite IPA. I prefer the 60 minute, and for now will stay away from the 120."
"This beer is a nice treat if you're a fan of hoppy IPAs/"""double IPAs""" and don't mind shelling out $9 for four of them once in a while. Definitely a step up from the """60-minute""" version."
"Pours a lovely amber/red color with a 1 finger head. Good lacing on this one. Aroma is citruisy and hoppy. Taste is in your face hops. Wow. It is slightly balanced with some malt presence, but it's more leaning toward the hops for sure. Mouthfeel is slightly thick for style. This is a good one, prehaps the best american example of a DIPA."
"My quote of the lunchtime tasting session: """It's like getting flogged with a cat o' nine tails tipped with hops.""""
"Great session beer IMO. Refreshing and tasty, not at all heavy."
"Woooo, this poured like liquid autumn sunshine. Minimal head, but it was still a beauty to behold. I think I could smell this for ages, but I'd need to consult a chiropractor from bending my head so much. Unfortunately, the taste for me left a little to be desired. It's very bitter and hoppy, which is good, but there's a strange aftertaste that reminds me of corn chips. A shame because I love looking at it and smelling it. The smell really makes me feel like I'm in for a treat. One is enough for me, with that weird aftertaste I couldn't stomach another. I will, however, revisit this sometime in the future just to make sure."
"The taste is yet another thing of beauty. Perfect amounts of dryness and acidic fruit qualities interplay to produce a flavor that is so balanced and heavenly. Just the right amount of sweetness. There is no presence here that even comes close to being offensive. This flavor is simply unapproachable by the attempts of less fortunate brews and far surpasses the abilities of even the most worthy of opponents. Even the belches are edible and delightful. I could drink myself into a coma and be lain at the doorstep of death on this stuff; only to wake up and pour out another. This one belongs right next to another favorite of mine and shall henceforth be revered as a truly great piece of work. This makes me wonder if the 120 minute will be far more than just a journey into alcoholic debauchery. Gotta try it. Nice job Dogfish Head. This is one bad ass mofo. Delight..."
"An instant classic. bottled: a hazed orange gold ale with a miraculous frothy cap that stays...great lacing... the nose fills with grapefruit and pine over a sweet cooky dough aroma. Marvelous mouth feel...oily with the malts so dense they are syrupy/viscous...all the time balanced by the marvelous citrus-pine hops which turn only slightly bitter in the long finish...a masterful effort...an ale full of malt body and taste in balance with luscious citrus hopping."
"All around a great IPA. Just fantastic."
"Overall, a good brew...looks like I will need the 120 to be truly impressed."
"Have only ever had this on tap locally here. Great aroma! The hoppiness is an acquired taste but well worth learning to savor the flavor here. Doesnt particuarly taste like a high alcohol beer. Personally the aftertaste could be a little less sour so I enjoy this beer with some strong flavored foods."
"This is a DIPA with great complexity, which is something hard to achieve in a beer with such a strong hop character."
"If you are a hophead I would stay with the Ruination, but for the aspiring hophead this is an outstanding way to get your taste buds wet. Either way, you cant go wrong with this liquid investment."
"Toasty malts hold on much better throughout. Incredible. Bump the taste to 5."
"This is a very good beer and well worth seeking out."
"Perfect."
"Pours a clear golden color with about a finger of head composed of tightly night bubbles. The aroma is a wonderful floral hops bouqet, with some spice to it. There are hints of pine in the nose as well. The taste is damn bold. Starts off smooth (the malt only makes its presence known for a short while) then quickly is overtaken by hop boldness. The hops come in with some citrous then turn sharp and piney. No malts are detected after the initial smoothness. Some fruity flavors crop up to add to the complexity. The mouthfeel is big and sharp. The hops really throw your taste buds for a loop. The hop oil stays with you in a bitter citrous aftertaste. The alcohol presence is somewhat pronounced in the finish, warming your mouth and other parts of your digestive system. Although the alcohol is definitely there in the taste, it is not overwhelming and does not detract from the drinkability at all. Brews like this are turning me into a hop-head."
"Overall, I found this to be underwhelming. It's a pretty average IPA and didn't live up to the high expectations (or price)."
"I definitely recommend this beer if you like the style. Those who aren't as big into hop flavoring won't like it as much."
"Again, the alcohol took away from the drinkability as well as the fact it was poorly balanced. I'll stick to victory double IPA before revisiting this."
"ProfessorMalt summed it up best with the statement that this is not a """one-dimensional""" brew as is the case with a lot of double IPA's. Plenty of malt and a hint of sweetness balances this out, making it more than just a merely over-hopped beer (which unfortunetly seems to crop up a lot in this style), with quite a bit of complexity as well. Is it as great as the fuss makes it out to be? I myself am not one to listen to hype, as it tends to set people up for disapointment. Plus, it's not your typical beer of the style, so hop lovers may be a bit put-off by the experience here. I myself always have and will continue to love this beer to this very day, and i back it up with my fullest recommendation. Excellent."
"This beer pours a nice bright golden amber color, not a lot of head. Laces the glass. Scent is obviously very hoppy, but that's not all. There's a nice floral scent and a warm sweet almost salty sea water scent. Weird. Taste is much the same, with a great hop buquet full of piney, citrusy, floral hops and a nice fruity sweet malty alcohol finish. Great smooth mouthfeel makes this beer a real pleasure to drink. A great unique take on the IPA style from Dogfish Head."
"Great beer here, I would recommend it to any IPA lover. I only wish it was easier to find."
"this beer is a staple for the fridge, more for my girlfriend.. but every now and then i steal the sixth one to stir the pot."
"This is a very enjoyable beer, which I have had before and will definitely have again even though its a little pricey."
"I'm told that """seasoned""" beer drinkers like their beer with plenty of hops. I disagree, maybe different people like different things, eh?"
"Orange amber pour out of the 12 oz. bottle The aroma is incredibly hoppy with a lot of citrus in it, but some bread and malt smells underneath. The taste is obviously hoppy, but with the same faint malt notes in it to even things out. To me, the alcohol was a little more apparent in the taste in this one than it is in some other double IPAs I enjoy. Lots of hop bitterness in the finish; I was still puckering a minute after my last drink! The mouthfeel is a little on the syrupy side of medium, but it feels nice on the way down before giving way to the piney hops. For a 9% beer, the drinkability is pretty good, but I think the amount of alcohol I'm tasting would make me want to stop after enjoying a couple."
"On tap at Winking Lizard, served in a snifter. This is a dangerous beer. 3 of these were gone before I even realized it. Pours a bright amber color with a thin light beige head. Very light lacing. The aroma is heady hops, with a bit of citrus. Full-bodied and perfectly bitter with floral hops, citrus and a nice malt backbone. I can't think of a beer easier to drink at this ABV level. The finish is soothing and nicely bitter and floral. I could drink this all night and never get bored with it."
"Drinkability is very good on this great IPA, way to go Dogfish head. Will certainly break into my regular rotation without a problem."
"I seem to rating every thing lately fairly high. Thanks to Beer Advocate for turning me on to better brews or maybe I just like beer! A little darker color than 60 min with orange added to the rich gold of the 60 minute. It doesn't hold it head as high or up as long (maybe due to the higer 9% ABV ?) Hops strong and vedry pleasant - bitter and prickly on your tongue. I loved the heavier mouth feel of this Double IPA. The Malts were very well blended but more prominate that in the 60 min. IPA. I will drink one of these again, and again . . ."
"This beer pours out a perfectly translucent body that is a ruddy copper in color. The head is slightly off-white, sticky and oily. Visible carbonation is sparse and fine. The nose is great, rich and sweet with pale malt, I believe the continual hopping process adds a """completeness""" to the hops in the aroma. General bitter aromas, sweet apricot, citrus and rind, pine aromas....they're all here. When I drink the malts are sticky and sweet up front, dense bitterness quickly greets my palate as well. The apricot/tangerine flavors of the hops combined with the sweetness of the malt creates an almost candy-like experience. Again, I think the continual hopping process creates a nice complexity and completeness to the hop flavors as well as the aromas I noted earlier. I'm suprised more people have not experimented with the continual hopping process. Mouthfeel is perfect; gliding smoothly down, with enough gumption to make a solid impression. The finish is mildly dry with a teeny-tiny spicy peep of alcohol. A great balanced DIPA that hits you with a nice solid representation of all it's composing elements. I never had the opportunity to try the bottle conditioned 750's that everybody is always yapping about but if they were much better than this they must've been mind-blowing."
"Pours to a hazy copper-orange color with a tan head. The aroma is malty, bready and toasty with a citrus floral hop smell. The flavor is malty and pine resiny, with a juicy fruity hop taste. Medium in body and very drinkable for its strength. Nice, very nice."
"Assuming that the DFH quality control is ok now and this is what the beer will continue to taste like, I will have this now and again because it is exciting. I think it needs polish and some special magic to it, but it is nonetheless neat."
"poured a cloudy amber with a small head that didnt hang around long. aroma hops, citrus and a little yeast. flavor hops and hints of oranges with some bitterness.mouth feel was smooth and and just the right amount of bitterness. this one I will drink again."
"Pours a deeper shade of amber with a fairly minimal head, but since i didnt watch the bartender pour the beer who knows if it was the beers fault or the bartenders. Nose is of Pine needles and sap, with a touch of floral notes. Taste is a pretty big hop blast. The Malt provides just enough backbone to keep the beer balanced. Tastes starts and finishs with lovely hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is good with just enough carbonation to keep the beer from feeling heavy on the tongue. Drinkability is very high. Despite the ABV I would love to drink this all night."
"This 90 pours a cloudy orange marmelade color with a pillowy white head. The hops and citrus rise immediately to the nose, but there seems to be a bit of chocolate under it all--unusual for an IPA, I must say. The taste was sharp and piney, and as expected for a double, the alcohol very much in evidence (this accounts for the sweetness). The mouthfeel is medium. The more I drink of this, the better I like it. Clean and fresh. It warms the soul on a cold winter night."
"Thanks to GClarkage for the sample. Cheers, buddy."
"12 oz. brown bottle with the bottling date clearly printed on the label."
"Drinkability- After it's all said and done you can feel the alcohol presence, but over all is a very drinkable beer. Thanks so much for the 4-pack Pete! Damn good beer."
"Pours a lovely amber, with a thick off white head that laces well. Smell was at least 90 minutes worth of hops, with some fruity esters. Taste - Wow this is highly hopped! somehow crisp and smooth at once, very enjoyable and the high ABV isn't noticeable at all. Very smooth silky mouthfeel, I could drink this all night... and I probably will."
"All in all, this is a great beer. Probably not a staple beer in my place, but I'd welcome this beer as a great deviation from the norm."
"Yum,,the mothers milk. Pours out a hazy amber with a one finger head.Head dissipates but not before leaving a nice lace.Smell :HOPS! and plenty of em also a slightly sweet smell. Taste wonderfully balanced,very hoppy but has enough malt to keep em in check.One of my first introductions to IPA's and one of my faves. Mouthfeel is good alcohol barely noticable but at 9.0% they will sneak up on you."
"Balanced so well, this could pass for a mild ale if it wasn't for the warming that appears near the finish."
"I only wish this beer was more available in the town where I go to school."
"I'd not hesitate to have another one of these."
"Maybe this is an old bottle (although I don't believe that it is) and the hops have softened too much. Running it through Randall the Enamel Animal should fix it right up, but I don't have one handy at the moment. Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA is still good-very good beer, but it doesn't quite crack my upper tier."
"Drinkability: i feel like im not even getting the 9% abv here. The easy drinking combo of fruitiness and hop galore simply pleases my palate to no end. I feel like I could have 12 of these over a day. Simply a great IPA. Loved it."
"Final Thought: On prior forums, one might say this is a novelty; but hey, it works for me, and after one I'm nicely buzzed."
"Comments - I consider myself a hophead, and I really like this beer. Possible downside: if you are a relative lightweight like me, you cannot finish too many of these in one evening. Watch out! The 9% alcohol sneaks up on you quickly."
"out of a bottle I was impressed with this beer. after having the 120min on tap I was a bit remiss to try this one... my mistake. it smells hoppy and full of alcohol.. and it is. very clean sharp image on eye balling, after being underwhelmed by the 60 min ipa this one is a winner. It carries the weight of the style better than most especially in a wide glass (and the hops are the winner here). Great hops nose and actually clings to the glass way lighter than it actually is. Smells like some belgians but has the great american hops kick. The carbonation is just right for me but a may be a bit much for the style if you want to be picky. Bottom line? solid beer with a big nose, big alcohol and sneaky flavor for drinkability. An excellent IPA for sure."
"Deep copper color with a thick, rich cream colored head, and a thin lace draped on the pint glass. Deep floral hop character in the aroma with bits of pine resin, and a light citrus bite. The floral/pine character bursts in your mouth as soon as the beer hits your tongue. The citrus hits half way through, and just a hint of malt, and a slight burst of alcohol come on the finish. Wow, more hops as I sit and think about the flavor profile. Nice medium to light mouth feel, and a great drinkability, even with this high alcohol content. This was my first BIG IPA, and is still one of my favorites."
"Cheers"
"Not that I'm complaining, the hops are definately there too, and the sweetness adds an unexpected complexity. This brew's almost refreshing, in its way. Nothing like the heavy hop slap I've come to expect from IPA's. Much more drinkable than I thought it would be. Good beer. Give it a taste."
"It pours a brassy orange color with a moderate bristly head that leaves a great web of lace. The aroma is a compendium of hops. Theres citrusy, earthy, woody, piney and floral hop notes in the nose. A competent malt backbone is also very evident. The taste begins with a smack of hoppy bitterness which quickly turns resiny and herbal and then citrusy in the middle. Malt flavors also become prominent in the middle. In the finish the whole mass of hops becomes incredibly citrusy - like grapefruit rinds and mix with the bready malt flavors very well. The aftertaste is very bitter and complex, with all the different hop flavors lingering. The mouthfeel is resiny from hops and very thick. The alcohol content is completely hidden behind the hop assault. This is one hell of a good beer."
"Overall, I am let down by the 90 Minute IPA. Guess I don't care for the hops that are used. Wonder what kind they are???"
"Notes: It's these kinds of beers that could turn me into a """hop-head""". Once you have this kind of beer, all other attempts at IPA's, double IPA's, whatever you want to call them, just seem silly. This is the kind of beer that makes other beers hard to review because this is just so over the top yet very well done. Less geekin' and more drinkin'..."
"On-Tap at McGradys. Dark golden yellow with a small off-white head. The aromas are of herbal hops, bready malts, hemp, a bit of the ole' skunk (weed not the animal;-) and more. The taste is fruity and hoppy up front with a lovely """herbal""" taste that leads into a bone-dry finish of alcohol, hops, and a bit of french bread. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but almost too light, and the drinkability is good as well. Another winner from DFH. I really want to try this from the Randall though! C'mon McGradys!"
"What can I say? Better on tap than in the bottle. The closest thing to a perfect beer that I have had yet. It was beyond true description. I have GOT to find a bar that has this on tap, and make it my home. This would go well with cheese and crackers, nachos, and practically anything else you could think of."
" i not only strongly recommend you try this beer, i encourage you to seek it out."
"Extremely drinkable. It has me wondering how much it is to buy it directly in kegs."
"Pours a rustic orange copper that is slightly hazy. The head is sticky, creamy-soft, and very light tan. Very good lacing. Smells mostly of very citric hops, some piney resin, and alcohol. I can also pick up a solid base of sugary sweet malt. Taste starts off with an acidic hop greeting, followed by sugary mini-donuts, which don't last long. A bitingly acidic and juicy hop wave crashes in and takes over. Notes of fruit try to crack through and do, a little bit. The bitterness is big and citrusy overall. Finish stays resiny, and bitter and dry for quite a while, with some lingering sugary/fruity malt. Mouthfeel is big and coat-your-mouth sticky. This ale has a yeasty-musty-alcohol vibe throughout I wasn't crazy about. Still, a very good IIPA."
"Drinkability is great, except for the abv, which would put many on their ass in no time. But if I had a second bottle of this, I'd be sorely tempted to have another if I had nothing to do for the rest of the day."
"-Oelergud"
"The 90 minute is an ideal American ale. Another fantastic beer from Dogfishhead."
"Pours a light clear golden amber with a big off white head that leaves lots of lacing. Aroma is mostly floral hops with light pine hints in background, with a light malt presence detected. Not as intense as one would expect from a Double IPA. Taste is lots of hops not overly bitter but lots of hop flavor followed by sweet malt body leaves a little bitter lingering aftertaste but again little weak for a Double IPA. Mouthfeel is not bad maybe a little light for a 9% brew but not bad. Drinakability is good these go down smooth and easy and at 9% could lead to trouble, but taste wise is more like a good IPA. I don't know if I am being over critical of this beer because I was expecting so much more? I have been wanting to try this one for a while and now I am disappointed it is not a bad beer but it is not the kick ass beer like I was expecting. I could not find a year on this beer but it was marked Sept maybe its year old and hops have died down a little ? I would think the Vintage Cellar would have a good turnover?"
"90 minute ipa is best on-tap. the appearece is an orange -amber with a tight bubbled head that laces the glass heavily. smell is among the best ive had the pleasure of putting under my nose. all hops babay! taste is also heavy on the hops. just perfect for an ipa'r like myself. mouthfeel is highly carbonated and oily. alcohol is hidden very welland, at 9.00 abv this one will send you to the sandman early if you let youself become it's slave. a masterpiece!"
"Drinkability is exceptional for this 9% beer. The beer is easy to drink. The alcohol is slightly noticeable, but not what I would expect. I could definately finish the four pack at once. It is kind of expensive though."
"Pour it, smell it, sip it, let it linger and enjoy it."
"A head just lighter than the color of khaki sits on top of a deep bronze liquid--the color of a dirty penny--with topaz highlights. Gloopy, substantial head leaves webby lacework that sticks somewhat nicely. A few streamers idle through this liquid of above-average viscosity. Big hop aroma is dusty and pollen-like, but can't completely hide a firm, sweet, almost porridge-like malt body. The hop smell here is a double-edged sword for me--I like the suggestions of straw bales and cedar chips; I don't care to be reminded of the smell of """green dragon""" (a vile stoner concoction involving marijuana soaked in hot vodka). Flavor begins with a bran muffin and marmalade-like sweetness at the tip of the tongue. Calling the hop flavor """bitter""" is not quite accurate. It's more like a brute spiciness that's nearly peppery in character. Big oregano and possibly mint flavors are also involved in a gripping aftertaste. Varnish-like, yet smooth, mouthfeel is downright numbing without being astringent. Like a bulldozer with a leopard interior. This is a big beer whose characteristics didn't quite resolve for me until I was nearly done with the sample (12 oz.), at which point my tastebuds were exhausted anyway. The first time I had this beer, I liked it a lot better than I liked this sample, and I have reason to believe that this bottle may have been mishandled. Still, I think there are Double IPA's that handle the balance of massive flavor, alcohol, and overall refreshment better than this one."
"Price could be a little lower, but I am glad it is available at all to me."
"A new edition to Chumley's bottled arsenal. As soon as I pull up my bar seat, my favorite bartender asks what I'll have and with out hesitation I reply: """90 minute please""". """Good choice""" he responds. A bottle with a more modern looking label and a pint glass arrive. I soon pour this golden/orange exilir into the pint and note the massive citrusy/hoppy aromas that are present. Reminds me a lot of Dreadnaught. First sips conjure more sweetness than I would have liked, but the hop bite is immense. Not as much balance as Dreadnaught and aftertaste is stuck with the syrupy sweetness of an ultra-hopped beer. The 9 percent alcohol never steps up to take center-stage, but you can certaintly feel it's effects. Overall, this is a very good double IPA, but I'll still stick to my FFF when it counts."
"Overall Impression: Dangerously drinkable. While I could make a session of these, I would be worthless very quickly. This is a special occasion type beer, and more of a winter beer in my book. With the hop level, these should age nicely until they are needed in the grip of winter. Strongly recommended."
"ng"
"Finally found myself a 4 pack of this much anticipated brew. Pours from the bottle a nice opaque orange with a 1 inch head that proceeds to leave some beautiful lacing before I even take the first sip. The smell is a floral bouqet of hops. The mix of hops invades my nose...and some citrus hints come throuh too. I could smell this one for quite some time...definetly more fragrant than the 60 minute. The first sip is great...a wall of hops hits my tounge and it doesn't hold back. The biterness is just right and the brew is very well balanced. The alcohol is virtually nonexistant in the taste. This beer will make any hophead smile. The barley and hops are near perfect...this is definetly one of my new favorite IPA's. Mouthfeel on this brew is perfect...a full body without being to overwhelming....I couldn't ask for anything more. As far as drinkability..I'm going to have to rate this quite highly as well. It tastes great, goes down easily and truly satisfies my craving for a wonderfully hoppy brew. I think the only major downfall to this beer may be its price tag...a little hard on the wallet...but it's still damn well worth it. For any of the hopheads out there that haven't tried the 90 minute IPA yet...I recommend you seek it out and indulge in this craft brewing masterpiece. Dogfish Head rocks and hopefully some day I can track down the elusive 120 minute IPA :-)"
"Excellent."
"I liked the 90 minute alot. In fact after tasting it, I ordered a pint to share with crabby. The 60 minute seemed to have more a easy drinakbility, but the 90 minute is definitely a masterpiece."
"Poured a dark, golden color with a slight haze and a big fluffy head, which left an amazing lacing as I drank. The aroma was big with citrus, spice, and bread. The flavor of this IPA was huge. Very sweet and spicy up front, lots of grapefruit and pepper in there as well, sour fruits and dough in the middle, and a nice bitterness covers your tongue at the finish. The mouthfeel was just great; slightly oily, which gave it a very smooth and creamy feel. This stuff is dangerously drinkable as well. The high ABV was hardly detected while cold, but as it warmed, a comfortable tongue warming developed and alcohol became more evident in the nose. Easily the best IPA I've had to date."
"Drinkability/Overall: Nice complex brew, a real treat for hopheads! Pass me another one!"
"Well, according to BA time, it is my birthday. I don't like cake, but I sure love beer. So, happy birthday to me with this one. The beer pours a deep orange to coppery color with a finger of head that leaves lace all over the place as it falls. The nose makes my mouth water. Hops hops and more hops are in my face. They are piney, woodsy and somewhat citrusy. I have had this beer before, but it was 3 years ago this week, so I have come a long way since then. Here we go with the first taste. Beautiful. In my face earthy hops to start that melt into a sweet malt finish. The balance is fantastic...best IIPA I've had to date...best offering from Dogfish I've had to date. The beer is thick, somewhat oily with just enough carbonation. Drinkability is good. With the big hop character and thickness, it is a nice big-sips sipping beer. One a night will do me, but I will be picking this one up again."
"Maybe some lack in drinkability, due to the high alcohol level, well noticeable."
"The mouth feel was good, i would have enjoyed a little more carbonation or something to balance out the syrupy slide down the throat. I might have had another if there was one in the fridge, but even then..."
"Overall, it is an excellent beer. It's almost the same color as the 60 minute IPA... which is remarkable, in the true sense of the word. The smell is awesome... definitely a nice bouquet of hop cones. I will definitely seek this beer out. Anyone know where I can get it on tap in NYC?"
"Beer is good. Happy 9% beering."
"Pours out a lovely rusty red into my glass. Small off white head that clinggs to the edges of the glass quite nicely. Taste is divine; nice hop character without the intense bitter flavor that other IPAs have. The malt balance is very calming and enhances the overall pleasure of this remarkable brew. Instantly a favorite of mine, though with the 9% ABV, it gets dinged for drinkability, at least in volume... Yummy to the extreme..."
"You will be hard pressed to find a better Imperial IPA than this example. A huge hop nose that really sets an impressive stage. The beer blows the roof off in the IBU's but there is a distinct balance to this big beer. I had no problem drinking this beer and the high ABV is not very noticeable( check yourself before you wreck yourself). There has been debate on the longterm legitimacy of Imperial IPA's but this beer is future classic."
"This has always been such a great IPA, what a treat to have it casked! Medium golden and somwhat unclear. Such an amazingly thick and creamy white bubble bath of a head on top. Scented lightly of grapefruit. Man, it is sooo silky as allhell! So rich and smooth, but yet not heavy at all. Hoppy and grapefruit rindy, lite citrus. Intense taste, but blended so nicely. Just so freakin' amazing... Perfect temperature. I can sit and just drink tons and tons and tons.... wait, there is not going to be tons of this available in this little freakin cask... crap! Thank god the DR is close to me! Gonna suck this thing dry!"
"I am not normally a huge hop fan. It is not that I don't like the taste, it is just not my favorite. This beer changed my mind. After my first swallow I felt like I had missed out on something my whole life. The smell is wonderful, like I am walking through a field of hops on a breezy summer day. It has notes of fruit and floral smells. The taste, wow, an explosion of flavor immediately. It is definitely bitter, but a slight sweetness follows to even the whole experience out. It feels heavy and oily in my mouth. There is a spicy note to it that makes want to keep drinking it. All in all an excellent beer. I want more!"
"I believe this is the first Double IPA I have ever tried, and as a fan of IPA's I have to say I enjoyed this beer, but it was defintiely on the extreme side. Went well with some barbequed burgers and baked beans. Can't wait to try the other three that are sitting in my fridge."
"2014 edit: Forget the above, this beer has become a much more balanced beer with another 10 years of brewing experience. The 90 still showcases a big hop presence, but with a better beer behind it, and a lot more finesse."
"Good stuff!"
"Taps out as a copper color with a tint of orange. The aroma of hops is amazing and calls out for you to take a drink. It has a nice hops bite with great flavor and is well balanced. Kind of spicy and a touch salty. There is a lot of hop punch but it is very well balanced by the malt. Seemed to have a little more carbonation than most IPA's. I went to a bar that had 50 beers on tap, once I tried 90 minute, I never went to another beer. This is the best beer I have ever tasted to date."
"Poured a clear orange with lively carbonation. The aroma had a very strong hop presence which reminded me of pine trees a little bit which i enjoyed a lot, you could smell the beer as soon as you opened the bottle. The flavor had a strong bitterness in the beginning with a sweet malt background which segued into a warming finish and a lingering hop flavor. This double IPA is better when it is warmer as the hops become more rounded and the beer balances a lot more. I got a bottle for $6 thanks to my local homebrew store."
"Taste starts malty, soon transitions into a lot of hops. Perfectly balanced malt/hop taste. Somewhat dry finish (good!). If I was to drink one beer in a night, this would be it. A perfect America Double IPA. The only one that comes close to this (that I have had) is Rouges I2PA. Somewhat expensive, but worth every penny and not nearly the price of the I2PA. Be very careful with this beer as it goes down very easy and the alcohol will catch up with you quickly. Dont get me wrong, the alcohol is detectable, but I wouldnt guess 9% from the taste."
"Pretty good. I could see myself drinking 3 or 4 of these and falling on my face when I get up."
"All in all, I thought this to be a good double IPA but a bit overrated in my personal opinion."
"Very drinkable. I could have continued drinking the other one but I think I'll save it for tomorrow."
"Check this beer out if you are a fan of strong IPA's. It's another winner from this craft brewery out of Delaware."
"A very well done Double IPA. For being such a highly hopped beer it was very drinkable. The huge hop aroma and flavor is grassy and piny. Malt is strong enough to keep the massed hops in line. Mouthfeel is oily and thick, but not offensive at all. I'm surprised at how balanced such a one dimesional beer can be. Did that make any sense? If not blame the 9%, it sure had me fooled."
"It's called an imperial pale ale, but this beer has all the attributes to be one of the finest barleywines I have had the pleasure to taste. I'm surprised no one has pegged it as such."
"Oily, hair gel look to it. Nice lacing. Vibrant looking with a lively aroma. Hoppy to say the least -- some citric fruit, but this is primarily grass and sappy pine cones rolled in pine needles and dipped in Pine-sol. The hop flavor is displayed like a stuffed moose head for all the world to see. Coats the mouth with bitter, hoppy, potent oiliness but doesn't let you forget where this is coming from: Dried out malty flavor and carbonation combines to make this a fairly effervescent, refreshing beer despite it's high abv and insane hop content. Alcohol is obscured by the dryness and the bitterness. Whew."
"This was on-tap via a """Randall.""" I learned about this great fresh hop delivering contraption this past spring at the BA Festival in Boston. I am jealous of the bloke that won it in the raffle. This beer was quite good after being Randallized. It poured a dark, dirty amber in color, with little head. The hops were fresh and crisp and did a great job of covering up the alcohol taste. Without the Randall I think the alcohol might be slightly to noticeable to really enjoy this beer. It was a great sipping beer when you have time to sit back and really enjoy a beer. Not to be rushed, but savored."
"Overall: This is a prefect example of an imperial/double IPA - one of the best I've had."
"Poured a nice dark gold with a very nice head that laced very nicely. Smell was distinctly floralwuth a hint of yeast bouquet..very nice. Taste was sharp with hops of a citrus nite, but malt was there too to relieve some of the harshness. Very nice lightly bitter aftertaste. This is a 9.0 abv brew, so allcohol obviously is there, but not to the point of distraction. Malt presence smoothed out the mouthfeel and made this a nice drinkable brew."
"In all, this is a very big (9% ABV), very malty and (above all) very hoppy IPA. As you might expect, this beer fills you up fast. Enjoy it when you are only going to have one or two or you'll end up bloated (and likely, hammered -- not that that's a bad thing every once in awhile)."
"Wow, I had heard so much about this beer and now am glad to realize that it really did live up to its reputation. Pours a cloudy golden pearlike color with a good sized foaming white head. Lots of bubbles racing to the top. Smell is very citrusy and I definitely feel an alcohol burn on my nose hairs. This beer has a depth of which I have not encountered too many times before. Very, very hoppy yet not too bitter. The malt base is superb. Lots of caramel malts and a somewhat wheaty base. Hops are mainly citrusy but there a variance in the citrus flavors. Alcohol fussels work with the beer and provide more depth and complexity. This is simply a world class brewed beer. Michigan needs to get Dogfish Head!"
"Very drinkable, more than 3 will make you slap-happy. Go for it."
"After drinking this for a while, I was suprised to see my glass still half full. Make no mistake, this is a big beer, completly different from it's little brother, the equally impressive in it's own way 60 minute IPA."
"Pours a cloudy golden color - small white head diminishes instantly. Aroma is intense hops - fruity and citric. The flavor is surprisingly well balanced between very strong hop spicyness and a strong pale malt. This makes for a very drinkable imperial, as no taste or feel overpowers another. Little lacing - mouthfeel is full, chewy and intensely flavorful. Did I mention this brew is intense?"
"Orange colour full of golden highlights. The small head is a shade away from white and doesn't last long. Subtle hops on the nose, seems to be alot going on in this beer. Taste is full of citrus that impart a very bitter feel. Much stronger malt presence than I've noticed in other imperial IPAs. Silky mouthfeel then I'm left with a lingering bitterness in the back of my mouth. Pretty sure I'll be trying this again!"
"This will now be a regular in my household. Could drink these all day, but at 9%, I think it would knock me on my ass after a few."
"Resampled in March 2005 same ranking, more pine aroma."
"I'd been looking forward to trying this one, but was surprised how average I thought it was. I thought the 60 Minute was a far superior beer."
"Potent 9 ABV makes this one dangerous because it's so easy to drink ... quickly."
"This isn't the single best IPA or double IPA I've ever had, but it's among a very elite handful. Great stuff."
"overall it's a very drinkable beer, I liked it but I'm not sure how often I would spend the $9 on a 4 pack..."
"Bender Factor: Oh yeah. I would do this if 1) I had a ride, 2) I had a bar tab, 3) I was wearing depends, and 4) I was taped to my bar stool."
"Thanks to cokes for the reunion with this deliciousness!"
"Nice looking beer - glowing amber with a flowery, citrus nose. Initial taste is dry & bitter, hop taste & aroma are everywhere. They're earthy and quite enjoyable & somehow not ridiculously bitter. This onslaught is followed by a bit of sour acid & very sticky syrup. Finishes with caramel sweetness. A touch too heavy on the candied sweetness to be at the top of this style, but overall a very good imperial."
"Nothing, and I mean nothing, gave me any hints that this beer was the same one that I tried from the bottle just a few weeks before. The only thing that kept it from getting a perfect taste score was the lack of bitterness to balance out the heavy malt sweetness."
"Pours from the bottle a hazy, orangish yellow, with a thin off-white head, which diminishes rather quickly leaving only a very thin layer of gray/white bubbles--although this thin layer of a head manages to produce some sticky lacing on the glass. Nice strong aroma of hops--flowers, spice, and some citrus scents--issue forth from the glass. Tastes as expected from the strong hoppy smell: nice hop flavors (flowers and citrus fruits) with a good bitter finish. Some malty sweetness is present as well, although fairly hidden behind the wall of hops. A very drinkable and tasty Imperial IPA."
"A descent looking amber, some what intermediate in depth of color. A nice off-white head which lasts the duration. A slightly hoppy smell, nothing overwhelming. A nice taste of hops. Given a 9.0 % ABV, there was a suprising pleasant absence of alcohol taste. Average mouthfeel. A nice tasty beer, not soemthing I would want to drink more than one of in a sitting however."
"Drinkability: Oh boy, this is a great IPA! It's hard NOT to drink one everyday. This is a top-tier IPA."
"A crisp beer. A refreshing beer. One of my favorite."
" Pours a deep gold with good, longlasting foamy white head. Smells of hops, hops and hops! The smell is intoxicating. And man, is this good stuff! A thick and heavy blend of hoppy, bitter flavors overwhelms the tastebuds, compensated by an almost creamy sweet malt profile. No detectable flaws to be found. A beer worthy of much respect, and an excellent all around show. I wish I had the money to drink this more often!"
"Get your hop fix here!"
"Very impressive brew. Huge hop nose, unlike anything I have ever experienced. Hops Galore! Nice lasting head and light coper color. Malty, yet very hoppy flavor. Not too bitter and backed up with malt. Lingering hop flavor that is rather pleasant. Not unpleasantly citrussy like some breweries would make. And very drinkable. Did I metion the hops?"
"750ml bottle: Mine was bottled 12/02 and opened 4/11/04. This one poured a cloudy, dark golden color. There was a big frothy head on it, which settled down rather quickly. Some lacing down the glass. Don't know if the aroma mellowed as it aged, but it is a bit weaker than expected. Still, it has a strong hop aroma, with some lemony notes. Suprisingly sweeter taste with only a little bitterness. maybe even a little bready and lemony taste. This was really nice!"
"I read the previous review stating that the hops are subdued and began laughing. The hops are completely over the top and balance is thrown to the wind. Reminds me of Stone Ruination. I don't know why anybody would want to drink more than one of these at a time. Bigger is not automatically better. Still, its a decent novelty brew iff'n you like Imperial IPA's."
"this one turns outo be the best of dfh's 'minute' ipa series, i think. a nice creamy tan head sits on top of a healthy looking, crisp amber coloured brew. the head is long lasting and provides for a decent stickiness as well. the smell here is quite inviting, with hop, bread and spice all over the place and a little sweetness in the back. toasted barley is also present. this one is filled with flavour as well. it's (of course) quite hoppy but with tropical fruit flavouring thrown into the mix in the middle and at the finish. i did not detect any alcohol notes in the taste, so be careful with this one at 9% abv. there is a spicy bite at the finish that has some tangy favour to it as well. a very tasty imperial ipa."
"Poured a dark gold color. Nice head retention and lacing. Wow!! Hops aroma bowled me over. What a great smell this brew has. Hops over the malts, although the malts are present. Hoppier than the 60 minute IPA, as expected. Very bitter. I shared a couple with my dad and he enjoyed it even though he doesn't like bitter beers. If you are going to give a friend an IPA, I would highly recommmend this."
"Rediculously smooth, carbonation is perfect, this is so incredibly easy to drink. A marvelous IPA, this will come into rotation."
"Nebulous light orange-brown with a large, active head. Wonderful bouquet -- hoppy, not overpowering. Lots of malt, blast of hops, smooth and full body with high carbonation, spicey and sharp. Sharply assertive bitter aftertaste. Healthy dose of alcohol, just enough to warm, well-masked by the generous amount of grains. This is what IPAs are supposed to be. Enjoyed it with Indian food, complements it perfectly."
"This is a must not only for the I.P.A. lover, but also any beer lover. It's not only refreshing, but it packs alot of character with it's refreshing qualties. This beer is great as a stand alone or with food."
"I really love this beer. Good job Dogfish Head! My biggest complaint is the $10 hit I took for the four-pack..."
"on tap at the Blind Tiger NYC, filtered through the """Randal""" hop contraption. Stunning nose of HOPS glorious HOPS. Poured dark almond with a regal puffy head. Taste is fresh HOPS in all there manisfestations. Bitter, floral, grainy, piney, citrus, grapefruit, resin, etc. This beer is like having a private dry hop in each glass. Hop lovers rejoice. If you love hops go to the Blind tiger or to the DFH brewery to sample some of this stuff"
"Did I mention the hops?"
"I got my hops fix from this one. Being a lover of hops bitterness, DFH is to be commended for this beer. It is, of course, more intense than the 60 minute, which is the other DFH hop beers that I've tried. This one poured a deep gold with a substantial head and tremendous, long lasting lasting lacing all the way down the pint. The aroma is overwhelmingly one of hops to the point that it is all that I can smell. The taste is mahvelous, as Billy Crystal would say. A real hops treat, bitter as it should be but with a hint of sweetness at the end. This is a substantial beer with an hop oil feeling to it in the mouth. It goes down really smooth. The last taste is as good as the first. I found my mouth getting a little puckered so I'm not sure I would want to polish off the four pack in one evening of drinking. The second goes down just fine."
"Really a very fine beer that if I had the self control I would like to age for a while and then sample. I enjoyed this beer more and more with each taste, which of course made it all the more painful to finish."
" 90 minute is a deep red brown, much darker than other IPAs. It has a fluffy but tight white head and small, but persistent carbonation. Wonderful smell. Rich hop and sweet bready malt come across. Fruity alcohol is apparent in the nose. The taste is incredible. The beer is so smooth, complex with slick hop oils and sweet sticky fruit. Not as grapefruit-like as some other Imperial IPAs. One burp will let you know that the hops are in charge, but they don't offend when the beer is being drank. They're hidden in there, nice and happy, not raw but mixed up in the malt. Mmmm. Slick and slippery, this one goes down without asking. I keep thinking about brandy, without the aftertaste. Rich and delicious all over. The alcohol is there, and really contributes to the flavor, but in a very good way. A pitcher of 9% hit me pretty hard. Still, the beer is a triumph. Do what you can to get some, on tap if possible."
"12 oz bottle - Many months after first tasting this beer in the 750 format, I have tried it in the 12 oz bottle. I pretty much have the same impression of it. At least the numbers seem to match. It pours a cloudy orange with a thin white head. I remember the large bottles head was much nicer. The aroma is still predominantly hops (citrus, mint, herbal) with some sweet maltiness. The taste has some orange notes, it is slight yeasty and then finishes with herbal, minty, earthy hops. The body is coating, almost syruppy. It is real bitter, yet well balanced. It has a dry finish with some alcohol creeping in."
"I poured the bottle at room temperature into a snifter, and noticed that it was copper in color or even orange. After pouring, the edge layer of head stuck around and klung to the glass nicely. Upon smelling, I got some very floral odors, w/ scents of pine and a tingle of alcohol on the nose. After tasting the first sip, my face lit up with a smile due to tasting the very hoppy tones, which dissipated nicely throughout the sip, but then came the sugar I tasted at the rear-end of the sip. This sugar really came through and got me interested in how they got it to taste like cotton candy or rock candy, with hints of green grapes in there! This sealed the deal for me with this one! It was medium bodied, with good flavor, mouthfeel, etc. I honestly wish I had a 2nd bottle to crack right now! I definitely recommend. If intersted in doing some trading, I would be happy to get my hands on this ale for anyone for some interesting stuff from other parts of our glorious country!"
"Different enough to stand out. The appearance is clearer and more amber than a lot of other IPA's. Real fruity and hoppy, for sure, but of a different type (apricot?). Gets better as it goes, and ultimately is quite satisfying. Not overly bitter, but quite an """in your face""" beer. Dogfish head is 2 for 2 with me, and I can get in Florida (hey ho!)."
"Pours a thick cloudy imposing dark orange color. Sticky sappy head that leaves lacing all over the place. Smell is intense pine sap and biting hops. Very aromatic and inviting. Sweet hoppy flavors dominate, but there is enough malt in here to provide balance and sweetness. The mouthfeel is smooth as capilene. This is a pretty damn good beer."
"Delicious IIPA, one of my favorites, a delight for anyone who loves the piney, citrus hops."
"Yum."
"7/25/04 -I sampled Randalized 90 minute at the HopHead ThrowDown. While the extra hopping certainly gave the beer an unusually intense mouthfeel - it went straight for my teeth, I wasn't impressed with its overall impact on the flavor. The malt notes seemed to lose definition and complexity."
"Drinkability is great ! Bet you can't have just one."
"The beer pours a light copper color with a decent head and plenty of draping lace. The smell is on the sweet side, but still has the characteristics expected from an IPA. Huge amount of piny bitter hops is present, with some heavy grapefruits, masking out all malt and yeast smells. The taste is sweet citrus, grapefruit mostly again, with the hops bitterness pushing in immediately afterwards. It has a bit of an earthy mossy taste too. This beer is pushing on being too sweet. The mouthfeel is a tiny bit thick with tons of sharp carbonation which along with the sharp bite of the hops, necessitates the slow drinking of this beer. The 9 cents of alcohol in here are quite evident, so watch out... drink too many of these too quickly, and you might find yourself in a bit of a pickle. This is certainly a testament to the beer making process though, with the 90 minutes of continual hopping advertised plentifully. You can definately see a mix of DFH's 60 and 120 here."
"The beer pours a cloudy orange/gold color with a 1/4""" off-white head. The aroma is great! It has a really intense bitter/citrousy scent that is pleasant to the nose. The taste is great also. It boasts of mostly pale malts, but the hops are where it's at. There are plenty of them here which fill the beer with a wonderful bitter hop taste. The mouthfeel is perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is the best IPA I've ever had. It has good malt and hop flavor that balances nicely. A great imperial IPA!!"
"Taste: Quite hoppy. A little syrupy in the mouth. Bitter at first, but then it calms down and laces your mouth. This brew was a little hott on the tounge at the end."
"At last got my hands on a 4 pack yesterday. Expensive stuff but well worth it. Poured out a dark yellow-orange with quite a bit of carbonation in this brew. Hops hit the nose first with some pine and malts in there as well. Taste was so nicely balanced. Lots of hops at first then mixes with some malts and some fruits mixed in but not that much. Also some oily texture to it with some of that pine taste in there as well. Quite a beer. Lots of lacing was left behind on the glass. The texture and carbonation is so smooth and tasty. I love this stuff."
"Many juicy hop tones. The malt is very subdued, providing some body and a backbone but not much flavor. The hops bring tons of grapefruit accompanied by orange and lemon. The alcohol is warming but doesn't produce any flavor at all. Very bitter and quite dry but still very smooth. Delicious DIPA."
"Overall, this was well worth the wait to try."
"I yearn for the big bottle version agian. This one reviewed from the 12 oz, packaged 12/03. Pours a hazily clouded golden color with lots of orange highlights. Beige head that dies leaving good lacing around the pint glass. Piney, grapefruity, sprucy and floral hop aromas with a touch of honey-like malt sweetness. In a strange sense, this is a really balanced Imperial IPA. When I say that, I mean that it is obviously aggressively hopped, but only retaining small amounts of the """sweetened iced tea""" malt profile that shows up in a lot of domestic microbrewed pale and IPAs. That is a residual effect of the lupulin and humulin compounds in hops. This beer has minimal qualilties like that because I feel premium hops were used, as well as a well-thought-out grain bill. That's just my take on it. Anyhow, enjoy. it's a really good Imperial IPA, just wish I'd stashed some of the big bottles I'd had of it..."
"Hazy peach-fuzz orange, bright, off-white head, still as night, stringy sheets of lacing noticeable. Hops on the nose, the smell equivalent of a nightly plastering of Vicks vapor-rub, a definitive sinus cleanser! Up front, juicy and oily, and oh so tasty. Fresh hop oil, combined with pine, citrus broken down into grapefruit and orange peel. On to the hops; a blast of hops on the tongue, the palate and even felt in the throat, the hop burn is happening here! Malty sweetness, some earthy tones, even some hazelnut tastes buried in the body of this monster. Alcohol presence noted and felt by the third/fourth sip. Take note of the sip portion; another kicked-up-hop monster from the DH crew, another incredible brew, another winner - get some!"
"Wow! First off is the cap after that its the pour of the copper colored liquid gold. The head holds nicely and clings to the glass sides all the way to the bottom, which comes much to quickly. The hop nose is incredible only matched by the hop flavor. The bitterness is VERY well balance against the malt. This is a superb brew. I anticipate purchasing the 120min since this is such a great beer and the 60-minute is a solid beer without the hoppieness (nose & flavor) of the 90."
"Copper orange in color with a moderate, tight bubbled, retentive head. leaves light lace on the glass. Smell, wow. Citrus hops are overpowering. Spicy barley notes are also prominent. Has somewhat of a woodsy feel to it. If you like the nose, let this guy warm up a bit. It only gets stronger from there. Taste: man is that an imperial IPA. Sweet alcohol breaks ground for the flavor, and thos citrus, almost mandarin hops take over, exchanging blows with the maltiness throughout the flavor. A kindof rind-like aftertaste wins out, (it is nearly an unpleasant bitterness.) This is one, nice, bold, strong I.IPA. A winner in my book."
"Poured this beer only to find a minimal head. But the lace NEVER goes away. Those nose is not quite what I like. There is one odor I cannot quantify that I do not like. Other than that there is not one thing I can say bad about this beer. Piney and floral nose(plus the unidentified smell I do not like). Taste is primo. Hoppy and somewhat sweet but not overpowering. Some malt and and lots of grapefruit. A very nice drink that is well balanced. Almost a little menthol?? in the finish. Very nice mouthfeel. The alchohol. Where is it? I bet I will find out."
"Notes: An exceptional example of an American Double IPA, no worries about getting my hop fix here."
"Wow. I like this beer a great deal. Very nice nose. I get a touch of alcohol and a great mellow hop scent, not spicy or citrusy, just nice. A little warm malt on the nose too. This might be my favorite """imperial IPA""" I've ever tried. Very nicely balanced beer, that is just close enough to extreme in both malt/sweetness and hoppyness that it makes for an interesting and unique beer. Also the typical DFH taste is there. Don't know how to explain it, but I noticed it first in the 60 minute and its here too. Kind of like a """crunchy""" flavor...nutty kind of. I really like it. Maybe its because of the continual hopping...you get some vegetal flavors...I don't know. It is quite drinkable, but I couldn't do more than 2 or 3 in a sitting. I'm still not sure how to score the drinkability field. But I think this is a bit much. The sweetly smooth hoppyness bothers me after a while."
"In the realm of Imperial / Double IPA's, 90 Minute IPA is King ... or at least one of the mighty Kings within its growing empire."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle, and exhibiting a nice orange/light copper color. Nearly no head and scant lacing, although that could be a product of my girlfriend washing my beer glass's and not getting all the soap residue off. Oops. The smell of this beer is strangely like canned pineapple. I also thought the same thing about the 120 min IPA. Hmmm. Also a big dose of alcohol fumes as well as some earthy hoppy odors, almost skunk like. The taste is quite earthy and hoppy. Almost too bitter, it leaves your tongue a bit dry. The heavy hop flavor is followed by a weird sweet fruitiness, again canned pineapple is the best way I can describe it. The finish is alcohol and bitterness. The mouthfeel is good, not very carbonated really. Although strangely, it is a bit filling, which brings me to drinkability. Too filling for my taste, I doubt I would drink more than 2, although the unique flavor would bring me back again for seconds. All an all, a nice offering from Dogfish. This is what I expected the 120 to taste like. In fact, to me it actually tasted hoppier than it's big brother."
"This is a tasty IPA, smooth and drinkable throughout the sampling. Not overly hoppy and tasty. Definitely a nice example."
"With a thin white film of bubbles for a head, the color is a hazy, lightly carbonated golden apricot. The aroma is of sweet barley and alcohol. The alcohol appears again in the aftertaste, but the initial flavor is surprisingly mild and slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is fizzy, sticky and full. It would be a lot more drinkable if the alcohol didn't haunt after the swallow."
"Pours a nice orange with a fluffy head that dissapates into a soapy like finsih,aroma is strong almost to strong hop/resin dominate it.Taste was harsh on first sip,ultra hop taste very resiny with a malty sweeter finish,this beer is not for the faint of heart a real hophead beer here."
"I enjoyed this beer and believe it to be very drinkable, despite its high ABV. I welcome the chance to try other beers from Dogfish HEad."
"Pours a copper color with a nice white head. Smells of sweet, flowery, citrusy hops. Noticable alcohol taste. Sweet malt presence, with a strong wonderful hop bite in the end. Medium body I suppose. In all, a solid IIPA. Not a session beer, but perhaps a good one to sip on while watching CSI as I just did."
"much less drinkable then the 60 minute. the alchohol content does not hide in this beer. it's in your face like it or not. i'm still undecided on this part. i had this after a boddinton's and i wasn't feeling straight for the rest of the night (had an arrogant bastard 24oz to take home with me). if you need something of good taste and wish to get drunk pretty swiftly this would be your drink."
"This courtesy of hopsrus (thanks!) poured a clear orange body covered by an initially large off-white head that diminishes quickly in a fin du monde glass. Nevertheless, an honest film for a beer of this caliber maintains the position. The smell is floral hops up front with definite orange character. Innocent malt is not absent from that sniff in the form of baked cookies. As it enters the mouth, it's rather """coating", thick and velvety as seems usual with dogfish head. First sip is excellent with a sausage+sauerkraut dinner, great combination. I appreciate the difference from all-cascade IPA, but still, the last sips seemed far more boring, one-dimensional, rather tart in mouth and all about agressive (unbalanced) bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is top notch clean though and 9% is nowhere to be found."
"Pours a unique, bold golden yellow color. Active carbonation builds a respectable off-white head that subsides into a very fine, clingy lace. Complex hops are prominent in the nose (no surprise!), but there's an earthy, caramely malt scent that lends a pleasant balance. My only complaint about the nose is its relative weakness, even as the beer warms. Hops blanket the tongue nearly from the start with the sweet malt base forming an occasionally-detectable foundation underneath the bitterness and tartness. Finishes with strong alcohol warmth in the very back of the throat and a flavor that reminds me most closely of darkish maple syrup. Despite the intense cling of the hops, the mouthfeel is not overly sticky or syrupy. I love hops bitterness, and I also appreciate balance. I will have this one again, but there are more drinkable IPAs out there."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle, the 90 minute is not for the faint hearted. Not quite as overwhelming as the 120, but quite bold in it's own right and infinitely more drinkable, dangerously so. Pours out a faded orange color capped with a tight white head. Aroma is enough to make our mouth water, laden with sweet caramel malt, flowery hops as well as sime piney spice. Taste is not what you expect for an IPA this big, sweet and a bit malty at first, then in march the hops, just a bit sharp and spicy at first then bursting into mixed citrus glory. Very sweet and thick, quite full bodied all the way through. Lots of complexity in the background as well, with hints of oak and vanilla and just the right bitterness. Surprisingly smooth, the 90 minute is quite impressive."
"Poured out a hazy, burnt orange with a small white head and heavy, heavy lacing down the glass. I believe this is bottle conditioned as well. The smell was of pine and citrus fruit with a definitive astringent alcohol aroma, but it somehow worked for me. The taste was sweet and thick with citrius, tangerine, pine ---- a little bit of everything. This brew was very full bodied and much more balanced as an Imperial IPA than I had imagined. The aftertaste did mellow out a little but overall it was pretty sharp on the tongue. I would give the drinkability factor a little less than perfect just for the sheer ABV factor, but man this was really nice. I love their 60 minute (and think the price difference is only justified between the 60 & 90 if you really need that extra kick. Don't be scared of this brew, I found it more balanced than a lot of the reviews stated."
"Dark golden yellow with shades of orange, topped off by a nice creamy head that lingered quite well. Laces covered the sides of my glass. Strong aroma of hops that include a spicey, as well as floral note. Slight hint of fruitiness. Taste has a very strong character that packs a punch and really hits those tastebuds. A nice dry taste that leaves you thirsting for another sip. The alcohol seemed well masked by the hoppiness. This is a IPA on steriods, I can't imagine what the 120 is like. WOW!"
"This IPA pours a bit orange/gold color. There is a fair head that leaves and leaves minimal lacing. The nose is of hops, mild pine and citrus. I noticed a fruity (non citrus) aroma mixed in there. It was ever so light and barely noticeable. The flavor is a very small malt start to a hop mid and finish. The hop flavor is layered and comes to your tongue in waves. At first, I was thinking more pine but then it seemed more citrus. It slowly builds up to a delicious bitter and dry finish. Smooth and clean feel in the mouth and very, very drinkable. This IPA is better than its younger sibling. Cant wait to find the 120"
"This beer looked gorgeuos and smelt even better. There was tons of bottom-carbonation in the glass and the foamy white head was very light and airy. As soon as this beer hits your mouth, it explodes with great hops. At first, it seems as though it may be a little too much, but it balances out perfectly. I can't help it, I am hooked! I cannot wait to try the 60 and 120 minute. This is by far, one of the best IPAs I have ever tried!"
"Golden colored ale with a fluffy,white head. Citrus is the main focus of the aroma, slightly spicy with a little malt in the backround. Medium to full body- spicy hop flavors that are somewhat oily on the tongue. Dry and slightly astringent in the finish, malt creates the body but doesn't show in the flavor until much later in the pint. Alcohol shows in the bitter finish, but this brew did grow on me as it warmed from cellar temps."
"Nice copper colored beer with a very slight head (and I poured it straight into a frozen glass). There is a prominent hop aroma, but the bitterness is not as prevalent as some other IPAs, this is probably due to the sweetness from the malts. The high alcohol content is definitely noticeable in the taste. In fact the taste seems, to me, like a very hoppy Belgian Trippel. Even one of these can put you on your ass if you haven't had much to eat."
"It started off w/ a nice pour that immediatly gave off a heavy hop aroma. The color was nearly as dark as the bottle which automatically interested me. The flavor starts off a little sweet and is followed up w/ an awesome hop after taste. This was definetly better than the 60 Minute which seemed less refined. The label stood out in the crowd and gives you a pretty good explanation of what you can expect from theis beer. Dogfish has done it again!"
"On tap at the Rose and Raindrop in Portland! Its a privelage having such a luminous East Coast guest tap here in the rose City. My glass of 90 Minute was a clear, light but vibrant red-orange color and had a fine blanketing white head. The smell was loaded with lovely floral hops, numerous citrus notes, and sweet malt undertones...well done. The taste however, was phenomenal. I experienced light sweet honey and peach/nectarine-like maltiness which melded harmoniously with assertive and crisp bitterness. The bitterness isn't near the 100 IBU mark at all, but it is big. The citrusy nose, lightly sweet malts, and the level of bitterness are tuned to each other perfectly. On top of this, the mouthfeel was perfect: full and very silky...wow. I was blown away. I have tried the bottled version, both 750ml (nail man) and small bottles, in the past, but I don't remember it being quite this good. All of the above made for a highly drinkable brew, as the sweetness was well in check, and there was no sign of alcohol. Big flavors but not out of control big. Simply amazing. I think it should be dubbed """The Nectar of the Gods"""."
"Here we have a transluscent orange/gold beer with a small head. The aroma is citrusy with a prominent scent of orange peels. The taste is sweet, malty, with orange peels, alcohol and hints of grapefruit. It is not as overpoweringly bitter as I had originally expected, instead it is maltier than I had thought it would be, even a bit chewey. It had a good bitter finish and pleasant aftertaste. I am not an IPA fan, but I found this one to be very drinkable."
"as far as imperial ipa's go, this one doesn't do it for me. hop flavor is one-dimensional and leans towards raw bitterness rather than a softer, more complex flavor. too alcoholic and punishingly bitter."
"Excellent IPA all around. Dead on mouthfeel with medium orange amber cloudy body, lively carbonation, and strong hoppy aroma. The hops do not overpower the malty goodness. Very juicy citric hop bitterness (grapefruit and orange rinds). The yeast acts as a softening influence to round out the taste. The 9 percent alcohol so well hidden, this would be a dangerous brew for me if it was available locally. This is now my second favorite beer behind Sweetwater IPA from my hometown, Atlanta. Thanks sulldaddy for the trade."
"The alcohol was noticable, and this is not a session beer. Try one and your tongue will be happy for a while."
"One word...Wow! Like two Titans, the hops go head to head with the malt, but unlike a more literal battle, in this one the two deign to live in a wonderful harmony and blissful balance. This is one very big full beer, not overly complex, with with such strong characteristics and hop/malt combo that you wonder if it was engineered instead of brewed. I like it a lot, and despite its powerful aura, I want to drink a lot, but that high ABV lurks, and once it makes itself known, as much as one beer begs another, common sense dictates that you give this one some respect and ease down."
"Drinkability: A great IPA style-wise, only the ABV makes it tough to enjoy more than one or two in a session."
"Like its draft version this is a decent IPA, but not a great one. This brew lacked appearance and again surprised me by the relative lack of hops aroma as I really expected to be impressed on this measure, which may be more due to acohol content than the hopping quotient. The look on my glass was mid-amber, slightly hazy, with a lazy white head and insignificant lacing. A good taste is had from the citrus hopping and is of a grapefruit and rind nature, followed by some caramel kicking in at the finish. Pleasant mouthfeel and drinkability make this worthwhile as an IPA selection."
"This may be the best beer I've had in the hop-till-you-drop category. The color and head are great. The smell is also very good. The balance is exceptional. The hops, malt and alcohol are all cranked up to 10. It is incredibly drinkable but the strength is dangerously masked. Definitely a great beer."
"Try this beer if you can get it. You will thank yourself for it. Easily one of the best IPAs out there and one of the best overall beers."
"I'm not sure of the age of this bottle. DFH was kind enough to notch the month, but skipped the year. I'll have to check with Yen. But at any age, 90 Minute IPA is worth your time."
"... I am somewhat shocked and at a loss for words. This is the finest in IPA's, suffice to say. This has what the rest does not (typically) which is a balance that is perfect of hop bitterness and malt sweetness. Both are very prominent, and the alcohol is very well hidden. All I can say is, if you're a fan of the style, you would be hard pressed to find another better than this. On draft, it's even better!"
"Slick alcohol makes this babe as slippery as a dolphine. For all this bitterness and hopiness there is no harshness. This is a beauty."
"If you drink only one beer this month, this should be the one."
"Wow, that was a damn good beer! Nicely balanced and so smooth, it took a certain degree of willpower to keep from going through that sample at a dangerously fast pace. In fact, this was the only beer I had twice while at the festival. Ill definitely keep on the look-out for this offering from DFH at my local stores."
"I really wish I could get this here. Awesome brew."
"Quite a fine IPA, I can't wait to try it's big and little brothers."
" Nice pour, hazy orange hued with a nice thick head. Head dies down some but retains well and completely laces glass. Nice big hop aroma with notes of citrus, especially grapefruit. Has a smooth body and overall pleasant mouthfeel. Flavor is classic IPA, good hop flavor, citrusy and bitter. Alcohol is well hidden and maybe better than most others in the style. This is a fantastic Imperial IPA, not as bold as Dreadnaught and some others, but a really nice one overall."
"Pours a hazy amber with an offwhite head. Fragrant and intense on the nose, fruits and pine mostly. Dry, hoppy, and carbonated in the mouth. Nice lacing down the glass as the head trys to stay alive. Raisins and figs are among the complex tastes during the experience, but the hops are always there. Dry, somewhat bitter aftertaste. The Dogfish Head ales continue to confound and mystify me with their complexity. I like the way they push the envelope with their use of hops and malts, and I really like this offering, though it's an unusual taste for an IPA."
"This beer was superb. It poured smooth with a beautiful head, lots of tight bubbles locking up the well balanced carbonation. A shiny burnt amber color beer glistened in the pint glass and contrasted against the 1""" head. The aroma provided an intense display of fruity esters and deep english style hops. The first mouthful revealed loads of complex malty goodness. The malts weighed on the tounge and then as the beer washed over the back of my tounge and throat, some serious hops kicked in and balanced out the mouthfeel like an IPA should. The finish left loads of deep hop bitterness, making me look forward to the next gulp. I could drink this beer all the time if I could afford it (not that it isn't worth the price though). Wow, what a great beer."
"Notes: A tad overbearing, imo, to be a top notch IPA; nevertheless, quite tasty."
"It is thick without being heavy. Perfectly quilted bright budlets melting into exotic, red-clay earthiness. Super dense and perfumed with the sweat of green stalks."
"Very drinkable, a nice treat anytime of year"
"My local beer store has just added a bunch of Dogfish, and after hearing alot about these brews, I have to say I am impressed. The 90 Minute is another brew that it outside the box. It is an IPA, with a high ABV, the expected Hops, and much more. Orange - Gold in color with a small head and little lacing. The smell is hoppy with some spice; like the 60 minute, there are some citrus undertones. The taste is hoppy, spicy (I think), with some pine tones (again I think). The taste is complex when you try to peg the flavor, but doesn't confuse when you drink it - it just tastes good. Nice smooth finish. Drinkable, even with the ABV."
"Bottom line: I've had this beer in the 750mL bottle and on cask before and really loved it. This 12 oz bottle doesn't seem quite as good an example of a powerful yet balanced beer. The nose was excellent, but the taste wasn't quite as impressive as I remember. Don't let that scare you away. This beer is still highly recommended."
"Taste: Definitely not one of the most balanced beers I've ever had, but damn it's delicious. Bursts of citric hops . . . grapefruit, pineapple, orange, orange, orange, and even a touch of sweet raspberry? Creaminess fills my mouth and blows my tastebuds, while the 9% abv stings my tongue and reminds me to drink slowly. A hell of a beer."
"I'm not a huge hop head but I must say this was good! Nice balance and never overworked. The color is superb, a very deep golden yellow in which I can practicialy see the viscosity!? Good creamy beige head with plenty of stick and solid patchwork. Nose is decidedly hoppy, the fruit flies won't leave this one alone. I've got a Ramones CD covering the damn glass. Good mouthfeel, medium bodied with a fine balance of hop and malt to keep things in focus. Long hoppy bud-like finish. This is a very solid example of the style and I will buy it again soon!"
"Drinkability: A good beer without doubt, with an interesting boil procedure. One IPA that is always around my house."
"A Huge Hoppy Thanks to Xlperro for putting this on at his recent Beer (Cheese, Stone-Porter-soaked-Wurst and Hot Mustard) Tasting. Awesome."
"This could be the greatest beer I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. The deep golden color led to a foamy head that stayed with me to the very end. I enjoyed the aroma of pine and hops, but it was the taste. Oh my god. The taste was a little bit of heaven. hoppy, but not overpowering. They added just enough enough malt to balance the emense amounts of hops in each glass. It had a sweet aftertase that I actually found very pleasant, I usually don't enjoy the sweet all too much, but this time it was just right. Did I say how smooth this beer was? I'm giving Dogfish a 5 in mouthfeel because it was so smooth. It was smooth like the finest silk. As smooth Barry White, as smooth as... you get the idea."
"Just seems like there wasn't that much thought put into this...just a hell of a lot of hops thrown together with some malt into a brew kettle."
" As a fan of heavy hopping, I think this is quite delicious, not too strong, nor too alcoholic, nor too sweet, nor too bitter. For a beer this strong, quite drinkable. Realistically, one wouldn't want to start a tasting session with it, but if hops are your cup of tea (mmmm.. hop tea!) this is a great IPA. Not exactly true to the English style, but true to DFH style, quality all the way.. an excellent brew."
"Update  I first reviewed this a month after joining the site. It has become one of my regular buys but thought it would be fun to re-review it with an 04 vintage. I juggled a few of the scores around a bit but basically Id write the review the same way. This is one damn good ADIPA."
"Very interesting, but not one I could drink more than one at a sitting. Might be a little too extreme for its own good. It would probably benefit from a little aging... will put a bottle aside for a later date."
"It looks like an IPA, it smells of nice sharp hops, but the taste is less than rewarding (considering the high cost for big bottles and 4-packs). A little watery/oily. High ABV does make for a nice warming feeling though. I am not too sure what makes this one so different than the 60 minute, the taste is not a big step up in quality or craftsmanship."
"Other: Dogfish Head doesn't get much love in the top 50, but they make some distinctive and adventuresome beers. I believe their distribution within the USA is pretty good, so most of the American BA-ers should be able to get this, or any of their products. This one is definitely worth trying to get."
"Poured an interesting orange gold under s small off-white head that faded to film quite quickly. That film stuck around a long time, though, generating some marvelous lacework. I detected a nice strong hoppy nose with hints of flower and spice. The mouth was prickly and fairly heavy. Lots of hoppy bitter and flower dominate from the start, balance somewhat by a touch of citrus and a dash of malt. There's a good crisp bite in the finish, leaving a bitter, refreshing aftertaste. If only I could get the Russians to adopt this style!"
"Pours brilliantly clear. This beer is an amber color with a pale tan head. The aroma is of American hops; floral and grapefruity. It smells a bit sweet as well. It tastes citrusy with a sweet maltiness to it. Finished by a solid bitterness. This beer tastes strong with a bit of alcohol in the finish. There seems to be something missing to make this a great beer, nothing wrong with it, just seems to be missing something that could push it over the edge."
"I am one huge fan of Dreadnaught, so here I am a biased individual tasting this IPA. Of course, I am one who has never had a chance to try any Stone brews, so who knows what the future holds for me. But in the now happens to be a Dogfish Head 90 minute Imperial IPA, well four of them at 12 ounces each. Rather clear it seems to be in the glass, only a slight haziness, no cloudiness at all. A straight up fundamental hops aroma kicks some nice ass. Kind of syrupy but not really....very drinkable for 9% ABV. The hops is kinda fruity at first, but it doesn't last long before a total onslaught of blunt hops force beckons the devil upon the buds of taste. This process is an addicting one which makes this one heluva IPA. Dogfish Head is the best thing to ever come out of Delaware, except maybe Dover Downs."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a hazy amber in color with a white head that retreats pretty quickly to a mere ring around the side of the glass. Aroma of piney hops, malt and alcohol. Medium-bodied with a very sharp carbonation that stabs at the tongue. Malt and biscuit can be detected early on. There's a subtle fruitiness that lingers and then gets stomped on by the citrusy hops. Nothing about the taste really stands out in particular, other than the hop bitterness. Supporting cast of flavors are lacking in complexity. The Imperial I.P.A concept seems stretched a bit thin here and sacrifices flavor in the process. I'm glad I tried it, for it's not a terrible beer, but nothing outstanding either."
"I couldn't wait to try this one so I didn't mind spending the $9 per 4pack. Poured a glowing, light amber color with a frothy white, pancake head that had real food retention - the perfect looking brew. The smell is great while not being to obtrusive, mainly a floral aroma with piney notes and a slightly sweet, candy-alcohol aroma. The taste was very well balanced, not overly hoppy like some of the """hop-crazy""" brews I have seen around this summer. This almost had a barley-wine type of taste to it, with the sweet barley flavors in the aftertaste rather than an extreme hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was also nice - very full and smooth. A great beer, one of the best I have had in a while. By the way, the head is still there."
"This is incredibly balanced for a 9% ABV & 90 IBU's of hoppy goodness. I actually think its too balanced. I wish there was something else going on, some sort of """character flaw""" that would make this distinctive & memorable. It is pretty intense while still being pretty straight laced."
"The so-called Imperial IPA and second in a three series for Dogfish Head. I really liked the 60 minute and was excited to taste the 90 minute. It poured a hazy copper color with very little in the way of a head. There was a white head for a short time, but that receded very quickly into some errant pockets of cubble clinging to the edge of the glass. Smell had nots of serious bitter hops plenty of alcoholic esters, maple syrup, brandy and pears. Taste was pretty darn good as well. Huge amount of hops thrown int with a ton of alcohol, which was not extremly well hidden, malts were almost non existent as was carbonations. I am not sure where it went to. All in all I liked the 60 Minute a lot better, and also like other """Imperial""" IPAs such as Rogue's and the Dreadnaught better, but this was worth the money spent. Check this one out."
"Pretty thick mouthfeel for the style, a bit slick, almost luxuriant. Definite pine presence when I burped. A beer to slowly behold or youll miss its many layers. More complex than its sixty minute little brother, but that does not make it tremendously better just different."
"This is a very flavorful tasty beer that a hop head should love. It's not as drinkable as other IPA's and may scare away a """novice""" beer drinker."
"Deep orange color, medium head. Aroma is floral and herbal, touch of grapefruit. A big bold malty and hoppy IPA. Very smooth taste. The over malting is balanced by the extreme over hopping. At 9% alcohol and 90 IBU, you would expect this beer to be much harsher and stronger tasting. It is surprising in it mellowness and subtly. Malts have a touch of fruitiness and sweetness to them. Hops are dominant and are floral and slightly spicy. Complex flavors. Thick taste, thick I will be picking hops otta my teeth for a couple of days. Grapefruit flavor intensifies as it warms. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. It took forever, several tools and a corkscrew to get the cork out, but it was worth it. Figured the 90 minutes was how long it took me to open this one."
"Appearance is par for the course for a pale ale, but the similarities end there. This is a great beer. Super juicy hops that just wrap themselves around your tastebuds and fill you with pleasure. As you can see I love this stuff. A strong, but oh so smooth beer."
"One key side note, I've found this tastes very different depending on the bottle size or on tap."
"It's a good beer, but definitely something for special occassions. I don't think it has a great drinkability, because it starts off pretty hoppy and ends with an almost single malt sweetness. Overwhelming each way. Could be a wonderful after dinner beer after a great meal."
"The smallish head settled quickly to a wisp of bubbles around the edge. The aroma, as expected from an aged version, was a subdued piney hops, honeyish malt and fusel alcohol. The front of the beer is slightly sweet but that doesn't last long. The middle and end blur together as a hop and alcohol assault on the tongue. A saving grace was a drier finish than you would expect. Overall I found it a bit harsh. Even after 2 years in the bottle, I found the fusel alcohol/burning bitterness characteristics a bit overwhelming. I don't expect IIPAs to be the most balanced beers out there, but I expect them to be drinkable. I've had many that were better than this. The first couple of glasses were OK, but it became a bit of a chore after that. I think a cleaner, more balanced 12 oz version would be more appropriate."
"A slightly hazy copper colored body is accented by amber highlights. A casual pour results in a half-inch vanilla cream head that slowly fades to a thin layer of foam. Wisps of a sweet floral aroma are evident from a distance. Up close, the strong hoppy aroma has both citrus notes and very strong florals that combine with the malt to bring images of bubble gum to mind. The taste catches me off guard, as the powerful malt sweetness sends my head spinning. I'm becoming a bit of a hop lover, but malt is my first love. The sweet fruity malt gives way to a great floral hop taste the ends with just a touch of a honey note. Biscuity malt notes, orange flavored honey, a touch of pine, ooooh this is gooood! The mouthfeel is very full, but not thick in any way. Drinkability is too good, as I just noticed this was a 9% ABV brew! I was thniking I needed a case of this stuff, but realizing what I paid for one that may not be in the cards. Plus, I'd probably be snookered all the time becuase this stuff is excellent. Sam and the crew at Dogfish Head can really make a mean IPA. Actually, they make at least three. And this one is the best of the lot. If you see it, buy it. This is a true treasure."
"If anything, the taste and drinkability go up a notch. IMHO, better than the larger size. Smoother, a tad sweeter, and *very* easy to drink. I also feel that it is easier on the palate than the 60-minute IPA. An excellent beer."
"Glowing burnt orange color, golden tinge almost. An inspiring view and almost magical looking. Big, sticky off-white head. Super charged whole leaf hop aromas. Wow, smacks you right in the nose Hello ! Citrus, and grass dominate the nose, almost like a wood chipper. First taste is super charged hop bitterness as expected. Mouth puckering bitterness matched with a nice citrus charge. High abv seemed to make a presence causing more of a heat and slickness than I wanted from an IPA. I think this detracts from the enjoyment a bit, and drinkability for me. I had it with dinner and maybe it's better suited as a sipping beer, as I know see the website suggests. Certainly an extreme beer, but so far in my experience I would choose the Stone IPA over this one. I think this goes a little too far to be an experience in itself, and crashes your tastebuds into submission."
"Boy howdy is this one full of hops. Aroma of centeniall and cascade jumped right out of the glass and made sure you knew what you were getting into. Copper amber in color with lots of off-white head. Aroma and flavor of grassy hops were most dominant but the brew had plenty of malt to make sure the beer did not get out of whack. Suprisingly, the beer did not come across as overly bitter. Very well made."
" I find it a tad pricey for a mere 4 pack-the 60 MINUTE is my latest favorite this could easily overtake that.A great beer overall-will not be my last sample thats for sure."
"I edited this from 2003, when I apparently thought this had too great an alcohol taste going on. Not so much these days - one of best, most flavorful beers out there."
"This on had a decent head. Taste is basically totally derived from the hops and alcohol. This was the first IPA in a long while to make me slightly wince as I took it down. The wincing stop as I got more of this brew into me but I can't help but think that this one is not balanced completely correctly. Not bad, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Color is a solid cloud of orangy amber with a big fluffy ivory colored head that grew to be just over two fingers high of impressive strength, but was fast to crumble and pop down to a hazy mist over the top. Leaves incredible stringy lace in drippy rings. Smell is all peachy, a bit citrusy and a piney/woodish backing, somewhat earthy, soft but nice and rich of hops galore. Taste is wildly smooth and soothing of peachy/citrus hops, one hell of a nice bittering effect thats very calm and easy. Some light earthy tones dotted in the mix with a blend of well balanced malts, gotta keep those hops in check, I suppose. Feel is full and quite bittering in a mild sense, in which it doesn't linger to much to be over the top in any way. This is quite excellent stuff, I don't care that its 9%, which is masked beautifully by the way, its way to damn easy to drink, which makes for a short evening."
"NB: Limited experience leads me to believe that the corked bottles are superior to the 12oz. bottles, although age may be a factor."
"Originally sampled on 12 November 2002. This beer poured with no head. It has an amber color w/ Lots of citrus/pine hops up front on the palate. It finishes cleanly. A hop monster to be sure, but in my opinion, there are better Über-IPA's out there."
"In my opinion, quite over-rated. The label describes the beer quite well though. It pours with a dark copper color with little head. It's big on hops and big on alcohol. The high alcohol is very distracting in this beer. I am a hop-head, but this just wasn't as drinkable as some other IPA's."
"a very good IPA thats is very balanced and flavorful. whenever i pick up a four pack i's always better than i remember."
"Love the Champagne-style bottle for the 25.9 oz. Me and the missus split it and she thought it was excellent. Nice blend of English barley and American-hops, especially the prominence of the Cascades for that grapefruity zing balanced by the sweet malt. I consider this more of an APA rather than an IPA, the body being slender compared to Victory HopDevil, but I am putting this on my """Just Good Beer to Drink Regardless of Style""" list, which includes HopDevil and Great Lakes Dortmunder. Also, thanks to the reviewer of World of Beverages in Norwalk, as I took a ride over and found this winner, along with Allagash Summer White. I'll be driving over tomorrow to get some more. FYI - I did not find the 9% ABV an issue - didn't even know it was that high until I read the bottle later. A good save for DH because I tried the Shelter Pale which was a major disappointment.Wish I had read the review on that first instead of basing it on the good reviews of the IPAs. Prost!"
"25 oz bottle, date 10/02. I don't know if this beer has mellowed in the past 7 months, but I found it pretty mild considering the hype. I have also tried 60 Min and 120 Min (both very fresh) and thought they were much more intense. This sample actually seems like your run of the mill IPA. Not too hoppy, not too alcoholic. Maybe that is the trick; maybe after a few more sips I will be schnockered, with my tongue stripped to ribbons by the hops, and the only recourse left is to hammer nails into my skull. Dark gold, bordering on amber with huge white head that lasts and laces. Aroma was the most surprising part; it was remarkably subtle and much less hoppy than other reviewers have indicated. Perhaps that is a result of the small amount of aging it has received. Trademark DH sweet malts that actually seem very un-beer-like; closer to Dr Pepper or gingerbread or something. Hops are there, for sure: tangy, bitter, not particularly dry and not especially huge. A tasty brew, for sure, but maybe the DH hype has gotten a little too carried away with this one. They make several beers far superior to this."
"I had this one in a 12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. This beer pours a dark copper color, darker and less hazey than the 60 minute IPA. There is about 1 finger of head that dies down to a small line quickly, but leaves a little lace on the glass. The smell is a mixture of hops and citrus. The taste has just a little bit more of a hoppy tang than the 60 min. A hint of orange is in there somewhere underneath all the hops. The mouthfeel is very strong, yet smooth. The drinkability might be a little low, but this is still my favorite IPA to date."
"What an excellent IPA. There is also a good malt presence that is well balanced with the hops. I'm going to stop analyzing and enjoy this one now."
"The appearance, quite striking, is cloudy orange, with a full, creamy head. The powerful nose on this one is almost overwhelming at first, but shows its many sides as the beer warms. Initially it is like I'm snorting a handful of hops, but eventually a distinctivey orange-juice aroma begins to dominate -- very nice. It is followed toward the end of the beer by a piney, almost 'pine-sol'-like smell. The flavor is marked primarily by leafy hops, with notes of bitter grapefruit and green tea. Sugary malts are presented mid-palate, in the effort to balance out the sharp hop flavor, and they fade back into the bitterness of the finish. Mouthfeel is sticky, and traces of the 9% abv are somewhat noticeable."
"This is a good beer. It's not a $6/750ml, old man hammering a nail into his nose beer, but it's a good one nonetheless."
"This beer pours a cloudy and pale orange color. It has a moderate head and the aroma is very earthy and hoppy. Lots of hops in that aroma. But in a good way. The taste was not nearly as hoppy as the aroma would suggest. Strong caramel malt presence to blend very well with the hops. Drinkability is great for the high level of alcohol and high level of hopping. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick. I'll take this IPA any day."
"I've had this the the 750ml corked bottle and the 12oz bottle. Both very good, just sorry they didn't carry over the nice artwork from the 750ml to the 12oz. This is and will be a staple in my diet."
"Very good beer, definitely one I'd have again."
"A definite treat and a beautifully made beer."
"This 90 Minute IPA was from the 750mL bottle. This beer pours a dark amber. The smell is all hops, with a bit of floweriness to it. The taste.....well, all I can say is hops, hops, hops! The 9% alcohol is noticable but not overwhelming. With a nice smooth mouthfeel, this beer is certainly worth a try! I'd certainly have another one of these in the future.......one of the best IPAs I've had!"
"Light copper colored with a big white and lingering lacey head. Distinct hop aroma. Flavor is big hops with lingering bitterness in the back of the mouth. Hops flavor covers the tongue and fills the entire mouth. Well rounded flavor with hints of malt. Very smooth mouthfeel. This is a really enjoyable beer."
"There are enough hops in the nose. Fresh, stewed hops. Slightly metallic, a little pepper, a little strong tea. A tiny bit of dark fruity sweetness pokes through the juicy tobacco hops in the front. Some spice and a touch of far-off smoke (the alcohol, maybe?). I taste a bit of apple in the middle, but mostly a ton of creamy malt giving the hops a run for their money. In the end, though, the hops take The Cup, leaving a hugely bitter finish. The alcohol is well hidden, I think, appearing mostly as heat and a little metal in the finish. Overall: wow. This beer is huge."
"I am not sure in which style this beer belongs; yes, it's an IPA, OK, I guess -- but the creamy, fruity, complexity of it seems at least to put its foot out of the IPA tent. No matter. I enjoyed this beer tremendously."
"It did take me five minutes to get the damn cork off!"
"Overall, a very good beer, but it just didn't wow me. I felt it was a little better than a 4.15, but I just couldn't bump the taste from 4.0 to 4.5."
"The aroma is wonderful. Its a very full hop smell. The smell is strong, but not off putting, most likely due to the choice in hops. The taste is citrusy and clean. The malt profile is hard to describe, but its somewhat sweet, which compliments the aroma and bitterness well. This beer is a real treat."
"Whoa, After my first sip of the 90 Minute IPA, I knew I was in for a treat. The extradinary taste took time to get used too. Ive had some beers that the hop taste tends to weaken once you get mid glass, but no so with the 90 Minute IPA. The last sip tasted as flavorful as the first."
"Pours a dark amber color with a thick and frothy white head that loves to cling to the glass leaving spider webs of lace behind as it slowly dissipates. Nose is strong fresh pine and cedar blended with lots of floral hops and leaves no doubt that youre in for an extreme brew. Medium to full-bodied with a slick mouthfeel due to all the hop oils. Taste is sweet fruity alcohol at first quickly replaced by tons of bitterness. Grapefruit rind flavors combined with raw hop resins and tannins make your mouth pucker but still crave another sip. Strong bitterness remains in a lasting aftertaste. A thoroughly enjoyable IPA and an absolute must-try for any and all hop-heads. Thanks to paceyourself for sending me this brew!"
"In ever lightly lacey head i sappealing, but I am thinking flavor and aroma all the way. A great beer to try, but beware. Hopheads only need apply. A very good brew. Prost!"
"This IPA is the antithesis of a session beer. I enjoyed it, but was not as impressed as some reviewers have been."
" Is what it is. A feel good beer, after the second glass, you will see what I mean."
"I had this on tap at Redbones tonight. I have had this beer before on tap at rebones but in a asmall glass. Tonight they served it in a full pint glass. Sweet, hops, a touch of malt and some alcohol. This beer is amazing, I realy like it. I have not been a big fan of Dogfish in the past but this one is nice."
"I originally tried this on draught and was extremely disappointed. Old keg? didn't work with beer or food I'd had previously in the evening? I don't know, but the further into that glass I got, the less I liked it. Anyhoo, this bottle is one helluva lot better than my original experience, and I have to thank zerk for convincing me to give it another try."
"I know, I know.... I said it about Hopdevil recently, but this is even better! This may be the best damn IPA this side of anywhere! Taste, check! Hops, check! This is a nice IPA! Mellow, but superduper strong! Gotta love the dogfish! Also, gotta love the cork type thing, haha!"
"Cheers"
"The taste was initially not all that pleasant. It was clear that DFH used a ton of malts to soften the ton of hops they used, which leads to an extremely powerful beer, with a thick, syrupy mouthfeel. While this is a very hoppy beer, the hops were hard to distinguish. As this warmed, and I began to sip it more like a cognac and less like an IPA, I began to enjoy it much more. Not for the faint of heart, or anyone without a cast iron stomach."
"Drinkability: The alcohol in this beer hit me very quickly – more quickly than other beers I’ve had with the same or greater ABV (perhaps it’s the ingredients that cause the alcohol to be absorbed more quickly). If it wasn’t so strong, I would drink this all night – a tempting thought but I would probably have to be carried out of the bar."
"The first sip is very sweet and hoppy, a smooth bitterness that seems almost impossible. The alcohol is also apparent, but not overpowering. It's a belly warmer for sure! Nice creamy mouthfeel with light carbonation. 90 IBUs and 9% ABV yet remarkably well balanced and drinkable. So drinkable that, on one hand, I wish I had another, but on the other, it's probably a good thing I don't. Either way, I'm going to need a Brillo pad to get the lace off of my glass!"
"If you like big, bold, well rounded, but exceptionally hoppy beers -- complete with character and balance, then be sure to give the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA a closer look. But if you're just mildly attracted to the bitter beer hit, proceed with caution."
"Overall, this is a drinkable, interesting beer. Its on the expensive side, and not a show-stoppingly great beer.but its certainly worth having again."
"Drinkability: I really liked this very nice IPA on-tap. I wonder if it is this good from a bottle?"
"Dogfish Head has created a monster here! One of my favorite IPA's...too bad they stopped using 750ml bottles, 'cause the 12oz ones aren't near as good."
"Good carbonation and head, leaves a good lace. Pours a clear yellow/orange. Fruity hop aroma. Starts as slightly sweet then the hops kick in but it is a really good balance of malt and hops. Clearly an above average IPA nearly as good as a McEwan's IPA. $2.25 for a 12oz bottle from Northend Superette Manchester, NH."
"A massive IPA. Pours hazy orange, with a decent head that quickly fades. Aroma is malty, cirtus, and pine. Initial taste is slightly sweet, then the hops kick in - lots of citrus and pine flavor in there. The joyous flavor lingers on for a while, too. Fantastic."
"Ive heard mixed reviews from other BAs regarding this particular beer, but for me, it was as close to perfect as Ive ever had from an IPA of any gravity. A stunning example of thinking inside the HUGE box that is traditional brewing. No fruit, no maple syrup, no champagne yeast, no spicesjust an AMAZING end result that captures the essence of the ingredients perfectly."
"Slightly hazy orange color, carbonation rises like a swarm of killer bees from all over the bottom and replenishes a monster head. Laces in sheets. Screamin orange extract aroma, carries a foot from the pint glass. Surprisingly, a boat load of caramel malts fire a salvo onto the tongue and thicken the mouthfeel. A heavy dose of hops only drags the rope back to its side (with a vengeance) closer to the finish, with a blast of juicy bitter bitter. Aroma balances malt earlier, quite an interesting take on balance. A beer at war with itself. I loved the novelty here, would definitely buy again (unless I had a cold sore in my mouth ;>) ) Alcohol is a little obvious. Not a bad beer for my 500th review at BeerAdvocate..."
"Great orange color, a bit hazy with good carbonation. The hops start biting, and continue to bite throughout the beer. I still am pondering why the man on the bottle is pounding a nail up his nose? To drink faster?"
"Appears a copper amber hue with a creamy off white head and nice residual lacing even dispersed around my pint. Zum wohl now there are some hops like a walk in the forest this beer fills up my senses. Hops of pine cone origin and a nutty trail mix-esque tone very full and malty just a heavenly combination for some not ready for the amount of hops this beer contains then it may be easier to just smell instead of consume. I orginally compared this flavor to a crashing wave allow me to just say this is a kick in the teeth full of flavor, it's is truly amazing how so many hops were put into this brew to retain a balanced flavor. Burping up hops this is great with syrupy sweetness mixed with a hazelnut caramelly edge to it and the hop resins in full cohesion to form a heavenly experience a must try for all beer lovers this is a staple in the realm of Imperial IPAs. Mouthfeel is full and syrupy but wow how drinkable is this stuff at 9% watch out because this beer is too drinkable at any occasion or function what a beer. A truly satisfying beer right down to my soul thanks Sam I will have to thank you one day for having the balls to make a beer this unique and wonderful at the same time."
"This was only my second experience with Dogfish Head. My first, with the Shelter Pale Ale, was unexceptional. The 90 Minute pours a nice golden to orange color with a supple head that hangs in there and leaves a thick pretty lace on the glass. The aoma is that wonderfully familair, citrusy hop pungency.The taste is hoppy and robust but nicely balanced with an appropriate amount of malt.Mouthfeel is very good with a velvety almost buttery texture.Nice hoppy bite in the finish. A very accomplished IPA and one that will encourage me to try their other offerings, Shelter experience notwithstanding."
"My first US Double IPA/Imperial IPA/American Strong Ale, or whatever you want to call it. Very nice, very bitter and hoppy, really gently sticky, but not unpleasantly so at all. Citric grapfruity bitterness. I quite liked it, quite rich, and intensly hoppy, but relativley well balanced."
"750 ml bottle, no problem removing the cork, pours cloudy light copper color, aroma of pine and citrus hops and hops and more hops, very malty to balance the loads of hops, not bad, you have to be a real hophead for this one, left my mouth and lips numb."
"It poured into the glass a reddish light copper color. Clear. There was very little head and it did not stay around. The smell had hints of hops, but that was really it. The taste reflected the smell. Hops were present but that is pretty much it as far as flavors. The alcohol taste was present as well. The beer finished as it started not that great and a small aftertaste. Surprised me, that with the other brews that I tried that day from this brewery, that this one was so different and not good."
"Do you love hops? Then this is you ale. It looks, smells, and taste hoppy. It pours a cloudy yellow/orange with a nice cream-yellow head full of alpha acids. The aroma pure fresh green hop. If you have ever picked hops you know that fresh slightly oily, slightly earthy green aroma. The hop taste is balanced with an assertive yet low key maltiness that seems to support the hops rather than battle with them. 90 IBU's and 9% ABV and you will be warm and hoppy all night long. Dogfish Head is known for pushing the envelope and this ale does just that. This is an ale that is meant to be and is BITTER. What a wonderful thing."
"Year 2002.  Comes in a corked 750 ml bottle. Pours a hazy golden orange with a nice fluffy head that sticks around for a while and left nice lace down the glass.  Hops dominate the nose with floral, citrus, and grassy, earth aromas.  This beer has a strong hop flavor with a substantial body and slick, smooth mouthfeel.  Hop flavors are all over the place though the earthy flavors stand out the most to me.  Floral and citrus flavors echo the aroma.  Malt taste is faint and yells in the background, """Here I am!""" but the hops keep it restrained as they demand full attention.  The alcohol chimes in with a whisper shortly after.  The long, bitter finish grips the tongue and doesn't seem to want to let go.  This is really a hopheads delight.  Treat like a Belgian quantity wise as the alcohol content can easy send your head swimming.  I recommend this beer to people with a taste for hops."
"I paired this with a Greek salad with a cardamom vinnaigrette and it was great. The hops were tamed by the brine of the kalamatas, the vinegar, the spiciness of the ground cardamom and black pepper, and the feta.The malt of the brew was really accentuated."
"The beer pours an obscure yellow-orange color with the head magnificent in size and creamy in texture, the color a light tan and as it dissipates, the lace forms a thick and sticky sheet to cling mightily to the glass. Nose is hop floral, spicy, and citrus like with just a hint of yeast, start is malt sweet and the top has a full feel to the palate. Finish moderately carbonated and devastatingly hopped with the aftertaste dry, with a bazillion tiny bottles, creeping up the glass with the second pour, interesting beer, I feel quite complex, a quite quaffable beer its a must try for the """Hopheads""" in the audience."
"A must try for those who love that the sweet nectar of flowery hops."
"This beer poured a dark gold color and formed a nice foamy off white head that held and left some nice circular lace as it slowly subsided.  A good deal of carbonation is present.  An aroma of hops and a touch of citrus.  A flavor of hops with some sweetness present.  Also some of the alcohol is present.  A touch astrigent in the finish with some bitterness.  The sweetness of this one is offset by the presence of the alcohol.  While not one of the hoppier IPAs, it is good and doesn't get offset to much with the sweetness.  A good IPA."
"Frothy white head.  Hazy orange color.  Murky orange smooth look.  Sweet, lemon/orange peel, hop nose.  Smooth hop taste with a touch of bitter orange.  Stainless cask which is dry hopped with a big bag of hops for one month.  Lots of yeast sediment left in the glass.  Great mouth.  Good but not as solid and rounded as the 60 min."
"Updated 6/22/03, 12 oz bottle. Same as above, alcohol and kickass hop flavor not as powerful as from the 22oz bottle. Floral oily hops and fresh fruit still dominate the nose. Smooth, more refined than before, and did not seem to have as much of an alcohol presence. Better than my previous sample. Not my favorite IPA by any means, but definitely one to be reckoned with."
"i will admit this was bought because of the dude hammering a nail into his nose on the bottle, but when i get it again it will certainly not be for that reason. this is a kick ass ipa. definitely my favorite. a slight malt keeps the hops in balance. a little yeasty and spicy, this ipa is extremely crisp yet smooth. if you like ipa's or hate them get this beer"
"True amber color, catches the light and seems to glow. Nice foamy off-white head builds easily and has good renention. Actually never got below a centimeter in thickness.. Surprising lack of hop aroma for such a high IBU. Seems to be lacking in hop flavor as well. Have I really gotten this used to hop bitterness or has this bottle been aged long enough that the hops aren't as much a part of the mix anymore? I'll find out tomorrow when I revisit the Arrogant Bastard. Has a flavor (from the yeast perhaps?) that I picked up in World Wide Stout and Raison D'etre. It's similar (vaguely) to some of the flavors I associate with Belgian yeast. As it warmed, I picked up more hops, mostly pine-like but some citric qualities, but never as much as I would expect from a beer that advertised its IBU."
"Well, what can I say about this beer. The label has a guy hammering a nail up his nose, I read that the hop process was used with one of those old-school electric football games (which would be the second best use for them since I saw one smashed over the head of an individual in a pro-wrestling match), and there is a damn cork in the bottle. Something ain't right here and I'm bound to find out what it was. Turns out, there is not much wrong with it at all. After having a minor grappling match with the cork, my efforts were soon rewarded with an exceptionally thick head on the pour. A almost ruby color in my glass and a burst of hopiness in the taste making this a great beer. I first had this at the IBF in Portland and now I remember why I kept going back for second and third helpings. A must have for any beer geek. This one is definately on the list to repurchase over and over."
"Cheers to frank4sail for the gift! You all right bro!"
"A bottle-conditioned IPA utilizing a single, constant 90 minute hop addition of Cascade, Columbus and Chinook. They originally did this by hooking and old """electric football""" game above the kettle and adding hops to the top of it. As it vibrated, the hops were slowly shaken off the edge. Unfortunately, (since it makes such a great story and everyone has fond memories of electric football) it got sprayed with water and never ran again! Now they've got a slow moving auger. The 90 minute is available in bottle (and draft at the brewpub), but the 60 minute is draft only (update - 12 oz. bottles were added in March 2003!). It has an impressive hop aroma but I kind of expected more. The malt is very basic in flavor (not very caramelish), but rich with a good body. Thankfully, it's enough to handle the intense hop flavors. There's alot of yeast character including an apricot fruitiness. The alcohol is a bit on the high side but it may smooth out if aged. The bitterness is there. Really there. As one local beer writer said, """Feel the burn""". Definitely on the edge!"
"Almost a bit of a sweet perfumy aroma....also sweet fruit like apples and pears on the nose...very crisp looking royal gold with a one-inch creamy head...very sweet in the mouth...Not very IPAish although there is some late bitterness emerging on the long finish...sticky sweet mouthfeel.,..From the label it sounds like the worked their asses off trying to balance the malt load but it comes up a little short...a bit too sweet...still well above average and well worth trying...the long finish definitely has some bitterness to it..."
"I am appreciating the effort, but not neccesarily enjoying it.  More of an effort of love than of ease.  Definately try it out if you a down with the hopness, but two may be too many.  Cheers"
"Drinks better than the fresh stuff -- smoother, more balanced and less of an alcoholic impact. A fun experiment with successful results. I'll soon see how the 2002 bottling has come along."
"This beer is predominantly copper, but also seems to glow a beautiful orange hue.  Big frothy white head.  Bigtime pungency on the aroma.  Plus nice little subtle citrus and pine nuances.  Nice tasting IPA.  Citrus and grapefruit rine present.  Nice little bitterness.  Some malt load here too.  Very good IPA.  Not and elite one in my book however."
"Well the stories you hear about the cork are true. We had twoguys trying to get the damn thing out. After about 10 minutes, we succeeded. Be very careful pouring this, it foamed up like crazy and I puored it pretty slow. The taste was not as hoppy as I expected. The alcohol taste was definitely there. I would recommend it just slightly chilled. As it became more warm, it was just too much. It think I will but a bottle and age it. Seems a bit too early to drink it now."

"Be forewarned-If you are not a fan of big/hoppy beers, stay away from this monster of a beer! Pours an insanely rocky and long-lasting foam collar over well carbonated orange-hued liquid ambrosia. Pungent citrus/piney hops assault the nasal passages. Taste is at first bitter as all hell, some estery fruitiness peeks thru midway, followed by hops and alcohol to lead the way to a tremendous hop finish. This is an IPA on steroids, highly drinkable even with it's in-your-face qualities. Slam a 750ml. bottle of this quick enough & you'll want to try re-enacting the picture on the label! A great accompaniment to some King Crimson music on headphones."
"This dark red/gold brew presents with a thick lasting head and exudes the strong scent of hops and alcohol.  Taste is reminiscent of a strong ale but with a bucket load of bittering hops.  This is a harshly sweet and very bitter ale.  Not very drinkable and not to be consumed in large quantities.  I have had one other """imperial IPA""" and 90 minute does not compare to it."
"Sampled in 2001, this may have been my beer of the year.  After having had some excellent experiences with Victory's Hop Devil and its ability to balance massive amounts of malt and hops, I was blown away by the 90 Minute IPA.  A huge, masterful mix of alcohol, malt and hops, this beer almost completely satisfies me as a drinker.  Great hop bitterness and flavor throughout, and of course, incredibly well-balanced.  The sign of a true master brewer."
"Wonderfully brutal.  90 IBU's - a hops extravaganza.  Solid malt to carry the weight of all those hops.  The  9% abv shows up in a spicy finish.  My sample was the 1 pint 9.6 oz. bottle.  Lets just say I'm glad I had this at home.  For the hops wallop this beer packs, it is surprisingly drinkable.  The bottle's designation of this as an """Imperial India Pale Ale""" is deserved."
"First beer that I've tasted from them.Bright amber,nice head,pretty carbonated.Big and floral on the nose.Balanced for the amount of hops in it.Hope to see more in IN. from these guys."
"I think they named it 90 Minute IPA because that's how long it takes to get the cork out of the bottle!"
"Not quite the monster hop bitterness I anticipated. Although the brewers at Dogfish Head succeeded in making this beer hoppy and spicy, they did not make that bitter. I've homebrewed beers with more bitterness than this, but I have to credit to the brewers for producing such a highly hopped product. I think this beer could be a little stronger, closer to the strength of a barleywine, which would make it a good choice for laying down in a cellar. Still a pretty outrageous brew!"
"It ends up being a good, strong IPA, but nothing to shout about. (rating 3.9)"
"I have to agree with the other reviewers.  This was not insanely hopped like I thought it would be.  It was very hoppy but had some nice malt balance to it.  Gets a bit of an alcohol taste as the beer starts to warm.  Overall a good beer.  Beautiful appearance.  Perfect copper, slightly hazy with a nice sticky head.  I am going to lay some of these down.  I can't wait to see what they are like in a year or two."
"Had this one on tap. And balanced it is. Very smooth and drinkable for a brew of 9.0% abv. though I would have enjoyed a more assertive hop profile. Maybe the keg version is a bit more mellow than the bottled. Nevertheless, a very good brew. A few 20oz. pints of this WILL rock you!"
"I expected to be blasted with hops, but this beer was surprisingly balanced. Don't get me wrong, the hops are insane, but they were balanced quite nicely by a fruity, almost apricot taste. And at 1 pint, 9 oz, and 9% abv, one bottle is enough to put you in your happy place."
"Had to try it.  The first sip is nothing but hops.  After the palette adjusts and the beer warms, tasty malt, fruity esters and a touch of diacetyl become part of the flavor profile.  They must've used a British yeast.  The hop character is definitely American, but those esters make for a bastard of an IPA.  Lots of alcoholic warmth in the finish.  A tad hazy with a thick creamy head.  This is a complex beer that must be sipped or your ass will be kicked.  I'm drinking this by myself since everyone else here loves wine.  I guess my ass will be kicked.  I'll place this a notch below Stone's 5th Anniversary IPA."
