"on draft in Alpine restaurant. Super west coast IPA, could drink it all the time but incredibly it was my 4th Favorite beer of the day! Just a great beer, just not as good as Nelson or Duet..."
"Another good beer from Alpine. Pours radiant copper, semi-transparent, a finger of foam and decent retention. I'm getting a lot of fresh-cut grass and pine needles in the nose. A bit of grapefruit that feels like it was sprinkled with my grandpa's sugar. The taste is pretty much the same with piney notes taking center stage. I get a big wave of grapefruit on the finish, intermingled with a touch of lemon. Ample doses of bitterness, which is always good. Finishes a bit dry, and leaves that tongue smacking effect I enjoy so much. Glad to have tried this one. Don't pass if you get the hopportunity. Larrrrrrrge."

"Damn. The real life international man of mystery (true story, bro) played this one down a bit, but I'm truly blown away.  Unique and so delicious. Thanks, buddy!!"

"Pours a light golden color with great clarity and a white sticky head.  The aroma is herbal, floral, piney and massively hop focused.  The flavor has citrus, green tea, resin and melon.  Nice and light for a double IPA this is damn smooth and drinkable.  Quite a drinker for those fond of hops."

"Poured from a 22oz bottle. Pours a clear golden color with a nice white head that leaves some lacing. Smell is floral, citrusy, piney, and a bit sweet. Taste is full of grapefruit and pine. Floral and tropical flavors in the back. Nice malt backbone. Some spiciness as well some dankness and sweet onion. Mouthfeel is vey crisp and light. Drinks very easily. Overall, a fantastic DIPA. Better than Pliny, not that it's hard to beat Pliny though."
"Growler fill, Alpine.  Excellent. Balanced, hopliciuos."
""
""
""
""
"Exceptional beer.. Filled up my growler with pure hoppiness on my way back to the imperial valley.."
""
"Citrusy and piney DIPA with a superb balance. It seems assertive but it has further hop complexity between the lines. A reference."

"Drinks outstandingly smooth, while it begins with piney, zingy lemon, accompanied by bready, balancing malts. The malts though, while they blend very well into the dankness, play nothing but a supportive role, handling the fruity, bitter hop madness. Also invites a honeyed fruit note to the palate, containing kiwi, unripe orange and water melon, which perform outstandingly well together with the grassy pine. Finishes slighty dry, outstandingly bitter, with lots of dank citrus and water melon, punchlined by a floral honey note. Awesome beer, incredibly full of subtle hop flavors, while drinking extremely smooth and easy, with a unique, full taste. Blown away."

""
""
"Another great beer from Alpine!"
""
"Very dank and resiny. Huge citrus in aroma, as well. A bit too bitter, for my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste poured from a bomber into a tulip thanks to Vito at Beachwood BBQ. Golden color with foamy white head that clings all the way down. Huge hop aroma - citrus and earthy, esters, some graininess in the background. Taste is flowery and citrusy hops, warming esters, hints of malts, very bitter. Crisp, medium-full bodied, oily/creamy texture, lively carbonation, long bitter finish."
""
""
"Enjoyable but didn't live up to the hype, plenty of other good doubles out there. Better as it warmed up."
""
""
"Clear, aromatic, amazing taste, overall the best IPA I can claim to have tasted besides possibly Heady Topper or Pallet Jack."

"Bottle was old I believe.  Too malty for the style"
""
""
""
""
"Great beer! First offering from Alpine, looking to try more of their stuff! Different than most IPA's I've ever had. Super smooth and delicious, not any harsh bitterness."
"Preferred Nelson over this one. A little watered down"

"beautiful bright yellow with plenty of carbonation.  smell was just out of this world with hops.  tons of citrus, beautiful pineyness as well.  taste, wowza this one was complex with varying levels of hops.  first very potent and bitter and then sweet and mellow.  this one drinks quite easily as well.  damn fine example of a WCIPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A lot better on tap than in bottle"
""
"Curious to see what the union with Green Flash will mean to production and availability of this gem. Look forward to getting some without having to head up the hill or downtown."
""
"Crystal clear gold, no real foam. Reminiscent of Pliny, bright ripe mangoes, citrusy. Syrupy hops in the flavor. Well done, not my fav"
""
""
""
"Manfully, I have failed. And so I opened up this little fucker and let me tell you even though I was tired enough of beer to swear temporarily off it, and even though my tolerance had recently reached a point where it alarmed hobos, one snort of this sonofabitch confirmed all my long-held prejudices, made it clear now and forever always the drunkenness is the one and only path towards light."

"Fresh grassy hops and lightly toasted bread malt. Elegant taste with little bitterness, ironic given its marketing on the bottle that it was hopped extravagantly at every conceivable opportunity. This is world class, at the very pinnacle of all hoppy beers."

"O: The herbal nature of this beauty place it on the opposite flavor spectrum from the tropical nature of Nelson and Duet but is still an amazing example of what an IPA can be.  The moderate bitterness and long dry finish pair perfectly with the dank herbal flavor profile.  What more can you expect from a hoppy beer from Alpine?"

"Absolutely a world class beer. Great hop profile with a nice balance of pine and citrus. Medium body with excellent mouthfeel. Despite the name, it isnt an over the top hop bomb, it comes off more balanced and brilliantly executed... It is missing a certain element that the very best IIPAs have (Heady and Hop Zombie come to mind) that prevents this from being a 5. Nonetheless, a fantastic beer well worth seeking out."

"Overall, a very tasty DIPA, with a heavy emphasis on grapefruit and a fair amount of bitterness. The IPA market is so saturated these days, and it seems that so many brewers are getting their IPA legs under them that it's hard to truly stand out. I think this one suffers just a bit from that phenomenon, but it is still a very good IPA all the same."

"22oz bottle pours a translucent orange with a half inch of head. Good amount of lacing. The aroma is juicy tropical fruits. Mango, guava, tangerine and pine. The taste is more of the same. Lots of juicy tropical fruit flavors. Mango and guava upfront with some pine as well. Resinous towards the finish with more piney hop bitterness. Oily mouthfeel. Somewhat noticeable alcohol presence but it drinks very easily. This one is a great mix of pine and tropical fruit flavors along with a solid amount of bitterness. More dank hop flavor comes out as it warms. Overall, outstanding Imperial that I would love to get a chance to drink again."

"Overall- solid IPA. Nelson is definitely the best one of the Alpine trio. This may very well be the worst of the three which isn't saying much since this is more than solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is worth the hunt. So far from the IPA tastings from Alpine I have noticed that their beers tend to run on the 'classy' side rather than being too in your face and aggressive. The assertive hop character is just perfect for the style, and not overwhelming or distracting from actual flavor. Highly recommended."

"O-Overall great DIPA, great taste of hops, great brew from Alpine. I look forward to their other brews. They do need to date their bottles."
"Poured a clear, amber color with thick white foam. The smell was a strong and persistent fruity-chewy hop aroma with some malt backing it up. The taste was naturally dominated by the chewy, resinous hops, but the hops were not really over the top and were nicely balanced with the malt. The mouthfeel was smooth and slightly sweet with a medium-full body and moderate carbonation. The dry, hoppy flavor lingered on the tongue pleasantly."

"An incredible brew, although not my personal preference with the bigger malt body and big resinous pine notes."
""
""
""
""
"as expected, a great DIPA from Alpine. Fantastic layered hop profile with floral, fruity, and spicy notes, with a nice malt backbone."
"Pours a clear golden, with an amber hue. Smells like pine, grass, some citrus and some malt. Taste is a bit sweet. Caramel right up front with a nice balance of pine and citrus on the end. Not too thin on the mouthfeel, yet very easy to drink, medium body. I tend to not like the caramel taste in any ipas but this one is balanced nicely."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel/overall: Light to medium bodied beer with a good level of carbonation. Nice. Overall, a very good IPA with great hop flavors. Another winner from Alpine."

"Overall, I would drink it again but wouldn't seek it out, overhyped IMO. Just didn't come together as well as it could have. Very malty and very bitter, but the tasting hops didn't shine through as nicely. Perhaps fresher, this beer would drink differently. Hope to try it again fresh one day and reassess."

"Served in a pint glass from a 22oz bomber picked up at the source. Pours a hazy golden amber is a one finger head. Not a lot of lacing left behind. The first thing that hit my nose was pine, quickly followed by various citrus notes. The variety of hops used in this beer is quite evident. The mouthfeel is that of a medium bodied beer, there is some malt flavors in the background but they are light. The beer is a very well done DIPA that drinks very easily. A definite must have again beer."

"O: Another fantastic brew from Alpine. I just had Duet and Nelson, I would rate Duet #1, Nelson #2 and this one #3. They are all fantastic but I feel there are clear winners amongst them. This one probably has the most hop complexity but the pine and resin dominates the most I think. Aroma isn't as bright and strong as the other two either, despite being an overall stronger beer. For all I know this could have been an older bottle, but who knows because they don't date. Regardless, wonderful brew from a fantastic brewery."

"Overall: Pure Hoppiness is a fantastic IIPA that I hope to have again soon. The mouthfeel and a lack of noticeable alcohol makes this one dangerous beer! I could quite see myself drinking a few too many if they were available!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a glorious beer. My only complaint, which isn't even legitimate, is that it's not as remarkably fantastic/memorable as the two other Alpine beers I have reviewed (Duet and Nelson). This is a great DIPA, but the bar for this style has been set absurdly high. That being said, this is definitely in my top 10 DIPAs ever."

"A solid DIPA. Bitter, but not so aggressive it's distracting (I'm looking at you Arctic Panzer Wolf). Malts are light and offer just enough sweetness to curb the bitterness. Oh Alpine, you so good."

"O: An interesting blend of hops. Represents a true double in lots of ways, but the hops selection makes it unique. It makes an exciting alternative if you're burned out on piney hops."
""
""
""
"Pours deep golden with thick two-finger head that dissipates rapidly. Good lacing.  Aromas of tropical fruit, citrus, grass and a slight whiff of soap. Sweet malt hits the palate first, followed by earthy, citrusy hops. Soapy and astringent finish (and aftertaste). Medium body with light carbonation. Overall, a decent imperial IPA, balanced and well crafted but the astringent finish and soapy aftertaste diminish its drinkability."

"O: You really gotta let this beer warm up. Becomes exponentially better, as expected. After reading about this beer on Alpine's website, it sounds like an insane amount of hops were used. The IBU's are definitely really high and it's very """West Coast.""" Very unique and delicious beer. This should definitely be the last beer of the night."

The taste of beer has a bitter resin-like flavor with a pine finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth, lightly carbonated and sharp dry finish.

"Clearish copper pour, with a small white head; moderate retention and lacing. Nice aroma of fresh hops, citrus, pine, tropical fruit, and not much else, as the name promised. The taste follows the aroma, not quite as juicy and fresh as some of its contemporaries, but still loaded with hoppy goodness, citrus zest, pine, quite bitter, there's a pale malt base in there, but it's mostly dominated by the hops, which stick around into the aftertaste. Body was medium, crisp and moderately carbonation, appropriate for the style. Very nice overall."
""
""
"This beautiful orange double coats your mouth like a cup of bitter honey. Plenty of big grapefruit notes on the nose and on the front of the tongue upon first quaff; but as the Pure Hoppiness spreads over the tongue, it's the much more bitter pine and nut flavors that leave a lasting impression."
""
""
" Enjoyed thoroughly none the less."
""
"Pours clear copper. One finger white head fades to a thin cap leaving little to no lacing. Aroma is slightly piney, citrusy with some tropical fruit notes. Flavor has notes of grass and grapefruit. Thin to medium body. Not heavy on malt. Moderate carbonation. Crisp, clean finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This doesnt quiiite match up to Nelson or Duet but let's be honest, hardly any IPAs do. This is delicious and Alpine certainly knows how to brew a damn IPA"
""
""
""
"O - This is another example of an amazing (D)IPA by Alpine. The classic resinous and crisp finish makes this beer extremely drinkable. Although I prefer Nelson and Duet to this (just barely), this is still a top DIPA that ranks up there with Heady and Pliny."
""
""
""

""
"O-A damn good DIPA. Had after PtE and Heady so it didn't match up there, but still a great beer."

"Overall very refreshing, and drinkable. Pairs well with almost any food. Great disguise for the amount of alcohol"
""
""
""
"O: Well, this does have some good points, primary among these the aroma. But not my preference to say the least. Caramel malts do not play well with American hops! I'm glad to have tried it, but there will likely not be a repeat performance for me."
"O: This is one of the best examples of a DIPA out there. I'm always excited to try beers from Alpine and I haven't been disappointed yet. Just wish they would start distributing to Northern CA."
""

"O: This is my favorite of the Alpine standard on-tap beers. Highly Recommended."

"Overall this was a solid DIPA. I think I have spoiled myself recently with ultra fresh Heady Topper, HF Ipas, and Kiwi Rising, so I was not blown away. Regardless...solid beer. Stoked to try Duet which I hear is superior to this."

"O: Overall, this was good, but certainly didnt live up to the hype, and was a pretty big disappointment (especially after recently having Nelson and Duet.) I am curious as to how fresh this bottle is, because from start to finish it comes off as stale. Yet another reason for breweries to bottle date their IPAs/DIPAs! I'm glad I got to try it, but next time I seek out Alpine it will be for one of their many other strong offerings. Of the three Alpine brews Ive had in the last week Id rank them as follows: Duet -> Nelson-> Pure Hoppiness."
"O: Pure Hoppiness stands out because it's probably one of the best examples of the style. It has great balance in every category and it makes you salivate for another sip (one of my favorite qualities in a good beer). The only gripes I have is that it's not complex and I really feel Alpine can really do a better job in their presentation. Still great balance and presence. I highly recommend this and while the bottle isn't the greatest looker, it's worthy keeping. Savor Great Beer!"
"Overall: A fantastic version of a DIPA, this is a hoppy beer that has plenty of complex flavors within. Even though it's a hop-dominated beer it is complex and balanced. Well worth a try for IPA/DIPA lovers."

"Get it playaz."
"Overall, I think Duet is superior to Pure and Expo Hoppiness consistently. Even after having on tap at Alpine."
""
""
"I absolutely loved this IPA and think that it's citrus profile is one of the best I've tasted."
""
""
"Pours a clear deep golden color with a quickly evaporating dingy white head. Light grapefruit and pine on the nose. Heavy mouthfeel for the style. Just adds to the richness of the experience. Starts out with grapefruit and finishes with lingering pine. Lives up to its hype. Super, drinkable DIPA."
""
"I really wanted to guess Alpine on a hunch but never had, and both were wants in my book. Hell of a good start thanks to quirkzoo for a great start to this bif for me."
"This is a standout DIPA. Very heavy on the hops with all sorts of concentrated West Coast hop flavors. This brewery knows IPAs like no other. Seek this out and if you ever have the chance, visit the place in Alpine."

"Pours golden with a quilt of white foam. Smells tropical with mango, peach, pineapple and plenty of resiny goodness. Some tangerine as well as sweet lemon. Flavor matches with full malt sweetness and fruity yummyness. Medium bodied with sharp carb and a crispy finish. Nice beer."
""
""
""
"High B-"
""
"Damn good."
"Pure hoppiness poured an amber hued color with almost no head. Awesome west coast hop smell. Big citrusy, mouthwatering smell. It's got a a very balanced sweetness to bitterness mouthfeel, with some nice alcohol warmth on the back end. Alpine seems to be doing everything right with beers I've tasted so far. I wish I lived in Cali so I could have them on tap!!"

"O: very good beer, but something about the hops just don't put it on par with Heady. Some of the best bitterness I have had on a double IPA, with a great mix of hop flavors."
""

"O- Fantastic. Nothing else needs to be said. I really like how you can dig into this beer in every way. Not the ordinary dipa!"

"deep amber body with a finger and a half of thick white creamy head. glass looks like lace curtains when the beer is gone. floral hops and a nice citrus presence are detected by my super sleuth nose. pure hoppy goodness is detected by my taste buds! man is this good, wish i would of done a side by side with pliny! nice crisp juicy fresh fruits in the flavor of this. my only knock about this is that there appears to be too much sugar residule hidden in the back somewhere. not enough to take away from the awesomeness of this beer, just enough to detect, but then again after having a super fresh pliny everything lacks a little. full resiny body with spot on carbonation and a not too bitter or dry finish add to the drinkability."
"Pure Hoppiness has nothing on Hill Famstead."
"Overall, a fantastic beer. It was slightly less hoppy than Heady, especially in the nose, however, its visuals and drinkability outweigh that of Heady. A high quality beer I'm thankful to have tried!"

"O: Another amazing IPA from Alpine. Hard to pick a favorite from the big 4, but I am glad that I don't really have to since I can't get them easily enough!"
""
""
"O: Good DIPA. Very West coast in hops without being astringent. I'd buy again and order another. However, it is not in my upper eschelon of DIPAs cause it is a tad imbalanced towards - dare I say it - hops!"

"Beer pours a clear orange/yellow with a thin white head. The aroma is fantastic - a great blast of citrusy hops hits me in the face right off the bat. Flavor follows the nose - the balance is really excellent. It's a little sweet and a little citrusy with bread malt and a great bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a great DIPA, one of the best year-round beers of the style. If this was sold around me, I'd drink it all the time."
"Appearance is very clear for a DIPA. Kind of a copper amber color. The nose on this beer is one of my favorites to date. A bit delicate. You get the pine, some citrus, floral and sweet notes, I almost get like a hint of cotton candy. The taste is very well balanced and extremely drinkable, clean and crisp for the style. Very little malt detected, alcohol well hidden and nice hop profile and bitterness throughout. A nice crisp hoppy finish as well. Mouthfeel is solid although possibly the most carbonated DIPA I have tried. I like carbonation but perhaps a bit high for the style. Overall a very solid DIPA. I haven't had the good fortune to try Alpine's others to get a comparison but a wonderful beer from an amazing West Coast brewery."

"A hop forward DIPA with a shallow malt backing yet stays very balanced. Hop character is like a flower patch in a forest, deep and resinous with uplifting notes. Alcohol burn is part of the profile as well. Ultimately this profile makes for a very enjoyable brew."
"Pours a very clear amber, orange, really nice clarity. Smells of piney, resinous, delicious hops, it really smacks you right in the face. Taste is pretty hop forward, but honestly a lot smoother than I expected. Very balanced. I dont know the age on this bottle but if I had to guess then I would say thats its not as fresh as one would like. The hops die off in the flavor rather quickly and the malts come through. Still very tasty but I wish that I could have it freesh. Mouthfeel is pretty nice as well, very smooth, you can tell it has carbonation, but its almost like the thick resinous hops just eat it up. Very good, but Id really like to try it fresh."

"Medium orange color with a 1-finger head that dissipates very quickly. Hops, hops, hops...I love hops. I could literally smell this one from across the room. Tons of piney, herby, resiny hops on the nose. Intense. Some citrus as first but soon changes to a caramel and bread aroma. Complex stuff. Smack-you-in-your-face hop bite right up front, but a really well-balanced DIPA by the maltiness on the taste. 8% alcohol, completely hidden. Another home-run by Alpine. These guys know how to make hoppy beers."
"Bright, bright orange, really reminds me of Pliny, just a brilliant clear orange. A strong pour gives 1 finger of white head that recedes quickly. The aroma is stongly hoppy as is to be expected. Pine resin, grapefruit peel, oranges with a decent caramel undertone. The taste was less than I was expecting given the nose. I think the """double""" IPA-ness, increasing the malt and alcohol has served to mute the hops ever so slightly on the palate. It is very balanced and very drinkable, but not quite as hop-forward as I was expecting from the aroma. The mouthfeel is very good, I had absolutely no problem finishing all 22oz myself. Overall another great (D)IPA from Alpine, I wouldn't rank it at the top of their offerings but even their lesser offerings are far better than many of the best that other breweries have to offer."

"Sunset Orange color, really great looking beer. The nose is amazing, loads of fresh hops, hops, and more hops. Sweet citrus fruit,pine and a touch of fresh baked bread round out the nose. The flavors overwhelm your taste buds, tropical fruits, sweet and oh so bitter, but beautifully structured, I want another sip !The mouth is crisp, dry and completely refreshing, the hoppy finish lingers for a half minute. This is world class all the way, as good as anything in its catogory and another huge winner from the folks at Alpine, and oh yea, their food is off the hook and the people are very friendly."

"golden amber with a slight haze. off-white head that holds and leaves tons of very pretty lace. nose is sweet, fruity hops with a touch of pine, caramel and fresh wood(?). taste is grapefruity, fruity and piney with some estery notes (a bit of Alpine experience, and I am getting to know their yeast) and very well integrated backbone of sweet bread (not sweetbread, sweet bread) and caramel for balance. this is for sure pure hoppiness flavor, not pure bitterness smack. medium-full body seems creamy, and bitterness just helps amplify, it doesn't kick you in the face. nice, long finish. no unpleasant aftertastes. i am very impressed with the simple beers of Alpine. they just seem like they don't try too hard to """blow your mind", and just give it to you like it is and should be. another pure winner."

"Poured from a 22 into a small glass at a tasting. The pour resulted in a good sized off white head with a nice light yellow liquid. The smell is big on the citrus and grapefruit with almost no hint of malt. Just the way I like it. The flavor follows suit with a load of citrus flavor followed by a nice hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Overall an excellent ipa"

"O - Overall an excellent beer, and one I will definitely go back to when given the opportunity."
"Medium body, oily and slick on the tongue with a little bit of small bubble carbonation that pricks briefly on the tongue. Decently smooth delivery of hop flavor on the tongue. A very good DIPA, though the aroma was a little lacking for this bottle."
"O: This beer is a hop head's dream. The hoppy bitters are never overpowering, but it's full on pine and citrus. Another winner from Alpine"
"Overall: Fantastic IIPA. Believe the hype...Slpine makes fantastically hoppy west coast style IIPA's. Great stuff, thanks Randy!"
"Alpine Pure Hoppiness pours somewhere between tangerine and orange, with just a little bit of haze to it. There's about a finger of white foam serving as a head. Head retention is not bad, but lacing is fairly spotty. The nose is a complete hop bomb. It's a citrus-tropical overload, with pineapple and grapefruit shining through in particular. Orange and mango show up as well. There's just a barely there flash of sweetness at the start, before a loud, yet pleasant bitter bite briefly take over. The last flavor to come is a spot on recreation of that incredible hop bouquet from the nose. The body is nice and light, but with a certain creaminess to it that you don't always find in IPAs. The carbonation is fairly bubbly, adding a liveliness to the beer and the hops in particular. This is right up there with Nelson for inclusion in my top 5 IPA/IIPas, and cements Alpine as one of, if not the best breweries when it comes to hoppy beers."
"OVERALL: This is a solid Double IPA. It is very well balanced and I can appreciate a big, hoppy DIPA with a focus on the hops and not so much the malt. At 8%, this is quite an easy-drinker and it is very refreshing."
"O: A really good DIPA that is close to greatness. I could see how this could be amazing on tap with more carbonation and livelier hop presence/punch. That said, it definitely is a DIPA that needs to warm up. Close to room temp it's much more """ripe""". Perhaps I need to next trade for fresh growlers to see if this can be an A+ DIPA."
"Overall: Another very good IPA. I just started trading, and have had an abundance of wonderful IPA's. This one is up there with the best of them."
"Overall: An interesting and iconic example of the west coast imperial IPA. Always worthy of consideration."
"Verdict: Amazing hop bouquet, great balance with the complex variety of flavors and great dry bitter finish. One of the best examples of a west coast IPA, a treat to have each and every time."
"This one pours a light bodied bright copper in color with a one finger bright white head. It smells of crisp and clean pine, light grapefruit, other citrus fruits, and also features some slight floral notes. The flavors are an array of grapefruit, clean pine, slight malty sweetness and a hoppy, bitter finish. It isn't overly sticky and is a pretty nice drinker. Overall this is another nice IPA from Alpine, but I preferred Nelson to Exponential Hoppiness."
"O: Delicious, well crafted, pine-forward DIPA with a big aroma. The heavy body limits the drinkability slightly."
"This brew is a keeper and a must for hopheads."
"O: A very solid DIPA, very hoppy ,the bitterness is well concealed by the sweet citrus notes and the malt backing..Would definitely have this again."
"I like how the biting bitterness is rounded out by the subtle sweetness. Body is medium. Round and full. Alcohol is more noticeable than PtE despite being similar."
"O: Nice interpretation of the style. Nothing mind blowing, but definitely a solid brew."
"Thanks to a friend for sharing this. Pours a clear golden orange into a snifter. Smelled quite piney. Love the smell of California ipa/iipas. The taste follows suit with the pine and some citrusy orange fruit kind of finish. Good bitterness and hop bite. Very easy to drink for the high percentage. Tasty beer."
"Overall this is my least favorite Alpine beer to date, but that is like saying you are the shortest midget in the Lollipop Guild. Nelson and Exponential Hoppiness are just in a different class than this beer. In a category that is hard to wow now-a-days, this one falls a tad short for me. Still a great beer and definitely recommended but not a """necessary""" find in my opinion. Alpine makes some serious epic beers so anything you can find from them (that is a hop-forward) will definitely be worth your while."
"O: This is very drinkable and refreshing. This would have been great to get all summer long. These Alpine guys know their way around a hop flower."
"This pours a brilliant pale gold that's largely transparent with a bit of cloud to it. The head was thin, but may have been a product of pouring down the side of the glass at a slow pace. The nose is pretty mild and subdued. Not one of the most pungent hop profiles by any means. Some subtle citrus...no pine. Once this slips between the lips, it's party time. This is one fantastic fuckin' beer. The citrus and pine finally make an appearance, as do the hops. Everything is so incredibly balanced. There isn't any one aspect that dominates this beer, which is refreshing. An expertly orchestrated brew, no doubt. The mouthfeel is marvelous. It doesn't have that tongue scorching effect that makes you wonder if you'd ever be able to taste anything else again...but at the same time delivers a wonderful, citrusy presence with a lingering grapefruit taste. I had a wonderful day of beer drinking, and I just didn't imagine that the first beer I cracked when I got home would be able to top it. Right up there with Abner for today's best."
"O- Love the nose of this beer, but was a little disappointed that it did not continue into the taste of this beer. Still a very good ipa/dipa but not a top tier one IMO."
"Overall: One of my favorites from Alpine. Very good beer all around."
"I liked this beer a lot. It was probably my favorite of the five I had that night. Would like to try some more Alpine."
"Overall I could type about this beer all night long. I will spare you the pain. Great DIPA from the West Coast. Enjoy the palate lashing like the rest of us! No crazy yeast strains or malt bill. West Coast my tongue. Very hoppy with this one. Thanks to Jeff for the pick-up."
"O - An outstanding beer, hands down."
"Overall, I'd say this is a solid dipa that showcases the hops well, but isn't too overwhelming. I do wish there were a bottling date present, though..."
"This is an exceptional DIPA. Very well balanced and very nice character. Another DIPA that's far better than PtE. High drinkability as well."
"Edit of my previous review thanks to a nice fresh bottle from the awesome Azdback! This stuff might be too drinkable. Had to up my mouthfeel from 3.5 to 4.0 and the taste from a 4.0 to a 4.5. The taste is based with caramel malt sweetness and bready flavor, while the hops come out big with wonderful bitterness, pine, citrus, hop spiceyness, and a bit of flowery esters."
"Many thanks to AugustGarage for the chance to taste this one. Poured from bomber into my Brooklyn tulip. Pours a rich orange/yellow color, slightly hazy. citrus orange, some caramel sweet aroma, definitely a breadiness to it. Taste- sweet pear, caramel butterscotch, the hops are all west coast and citrus- very little to no bitterness. So buttery. On the end, there is a resurgence of orange citrus hops, and then a buttery caramel ending after it. This is a really nice IIPA- so tropical, so well balanced, nice mouthfeel- not too syrupy, but it lets you know that it has some thickness to it. Up there with the best of them for sure. I am officially ISO Exponential Hoppiness, haven't tried a single Alpine beer that I've been less than thrilled with yet. Bravo!"
"Although I think the carbonation suffered a little from the growler format, I really enjoy this beer, and it definitely ranks highly for me in terms of worlds' greatest Imperial IPA. It has a wonderfully rich nose and the flavors follow suit. It is smooth with a light body that allows this to be a perfectly refreshing IPA regardless of how hot it is outside. Now, if only I could get a keg of it in San Jose...."
"O- This is an awesome brew and is highly recommended."
"Overall, a delicious DIPA that I would love to have again. Alpine did a good job bringing more flavors than just the hops to the table with this one."
"Overall: This is an excellent beer. It's not as good as some of the other great DIPA's, but it's not far off either. Nice and complex. My first Alpine beer, and I'm excited to try some others."
"Overall a really good beer. I have to say that I prefer Nelson, although I know they are two different beers, they're my only Alpine examples to date. I could drink this on the regular, especially during the summer."
"O:This is a great beer. I wish I had more, this feels like one I can drink over and over again. This one moves into move top 5 or 10 of my favorite beers."
"OVERALL: This stuff is mental good, just like every other Alpine IPA on the market. It’s a toss up between this one and Exponential for top spot, but make no mistake, these guys make a bunch of world class hoppy beers. Wonderful aromas, bold flavors, and not bitter for the sake of being bitter. Lots of complexity here. Always on the lookout for Alpine IPAs, and you should be too. Thanks again Irishgurl4 for hooking me up with this gem."
"Overall this beer is one of the better that I brought back from my SD trip. I've loved everything I've had from Alpine."
"-Cheers"
"Wow. The taste is just an explosion of hops. Bittering hops come first and then those aromatic hops with the tropical and citrus flavors. The bitterness is balanced well by a solid light caramel malt presence and that undercurrent of tropical fruit. This beer has a lot of robust flavors going on but still finds the right balance."
"This is a killer DIPA! I love ’em around 8%, less malt, less booze, more hops and this delivers! Hop juice! Mmmm Mmmm Mmmmm...."
"Overall: Another great IPA from Alpine. Great hoppiness great malt to hop balance clean crisp and smooth. This is exactly how a IPA should be."
"Overall: A nice Double IPA. This bottle/batch seems a bit maltier than I remember the beer being, but it's still really nice when allowed to warm up to a proper temperature. It seemed maltier than it was when too cold. I often take this beer for granted, passing it up for the likes of Duet, Nelson, Hoppy Birthday, and others, but this remains a San Diego classic."
"O- Very much enjoyed this beer, but doesn't get to level of other DIPAs, like Abrasive. The astringent hops and fusel alcohol taste took this beer down a notch. Still, makes me want more from Alpine; maybe Nelson is next after everything I've recently heard about it..."
"O: I am not sure if this was a good example of this beer at this point. I would love to try it again, for freshness sake."
"I love this beer. It's not in your face, but it doesn't shy away from big flavors and an amazing aroma. Great beer overall, shame it's so hard to get."
"O- Pure Hoppiness is an excellent example of a west coast DIPA. What sets it apart from it's esteemed brethren is the subtlety with which the different aspects of the beer interact. The flavors flow from one to the next seamlessly making the beer a pleasure to drink. Recommended."
"D - Very drinkable. Very hop heavy, but the hop profile is so excellent it does not matter. From start to end, the hops just do not seem to give up at all."
"(22oz bottle from el cerrito market and liquor). So I finally get to try my first alpine beer. I’m not sure why I didn’t try it sooner, but I’m happy to finally have it. Pours mostly clear amber, but there are some odd floaties in suspension. Nice, chunky white head that is lacing quite nicely. Aroma has loads of fruit: mango, papaya, orange and maybe some grapefruit along with some pine. Taste is sweet with some sharp bitterness. Medium bodied with an oily/slick texture. Bitter finish, but very well balanced. This is a nice, bright DIPA that really hits the flavor profile that I like best."
"Thanks crlova2!"
"Overall a great beer and an enjoyable experience."
"o - overall, pure hoppiness indeed. i'm really glad i got to try this and really sad it isn't a local offering."
"Narrative: The year was 2145, but that seems like just yesterday, well since they harnessed the photon retractor, everything seems like the yesterday of tomorrow. Let me explain. Corporal William Herboreal had been working as the ships botanist on an experimental mission to Titan, one of the outer moons of, well that’s not important. Upon discovering a new strain of humulus lupus, an advanced strain of hops, the oil was potent enough to power the ship, too powerful even. We cascade through time and sheered the space barrier in a way that even Immanuel Kant couldn’t’ have predicted. THE HOPS WERE TOO INTEGRATED. He kept feeding hops to the engine, its juniper rancor filling the cabin. But now we have crossed the line, fallen through time, living in the land of the hops. Yes we are living in the land of the hops."
"D - Awesome on tap! Enjoyed this a bit more than the Duet this time around. Chalk up yet another amazing West Coast DIPA!"
"O- great beer. Not as in your face as some other west coast IPAs, but it's got a lot going on"
"O - Overall, this is my first one from Alpine and I really hope it's not the last. This is an excellent beer, I put it just slightly below Pliny in the world of DIPAs."
"O: Another very solid offering from Alpine. They really have yet to disappoint, but I think their single IPA's are more enjoyable. Nelson and Duet are both so good, I couldn't help but have some soaring expectations coming into Pure Hoppiness. It's not fair to the brewers, but one can dream. I'd still take this over a great many in style, but if I reach for an alpine brew I think I'd grab one of their equally sessionable single IPA's."
"O: Pure hoppiness is no doubt a fantastic beer. If a demon appeared before me and told me I was forced to accept pure hoppiness as the only IPA in my life, I could not curse him (to put it in the strangest and most roundabout terms possible). However, I must admit my let down when I got double duet in the nose and less complex, hop-juiced taste. Still better than the vast majority of even top IPAs out there, but I'm not sure why it seems to often be prized above the more widely available Duet and Nelson."
"O: A great double IPA that can stand up to the best."
"Appears bright reddish orange with an off-white short foamy head. Recedes quickly and leaves a little bit of lacing near the top of the liquid. Good clarity. Smells like sweet citrus fruit, tangerine and grapefruit, along with strong pine and subtle caramel malt. Incredibly hoppy flavor. This isn't a hop bomb by any means, just a fairly well balanced west coast DIPA . Pine and citrusy flavors come together up front to provide a blast of hoppiness, a little bit of caramel malty sweetness rounds out the middle and provides temporary relief until the finish which brings about a huge oily and bitter hop finish. Very sticky lingering mouthfeel that keeps the bitterness around for ages after the drink is empty. Medium-full bodied for the style with slick/smooth low carbonation. Easy to drink and very enjoyable, hoppy as hell but not over-the-top."
"Drink Alpine or go to bed!"
"Scores: Appearance 4/5; Aroma 4/5; Taste 4/5; Mouthfeel 2.5/5; Overall 4/5"
"THanks Scot. This was a treat."
"o - the major difference between this and more accessible IPAs like green flash and great divide is that there is a lotta love in this beer. you cant really taste the hand crafted affection in my opinion. nuff said about this beer. its a hit with me."
"O: Another great one from perhaps my favorite hop brewery to date, along with FFF and some of the Vermont guys."
"O: Delicious IIPA, so clean and delicious, very little detectable alcohol, really awesome beer. Dangerously drinkable."
"Nice pure clear copper color, bright looking, half inch white head. Just light clinging of lace, nothing special. The aroma is totally juicy fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, very tropical. Packs a punch too. Very fruity flavor, tropical in nature like the nose full of west coast hops. Combo of big fruit and subtle flower, really nicely done. A clean bitter flavor on the back of the palate. Initially thought this was going to be a cloying mess, but as I drink I find it to be clean and crisp. Pleasant. This is my style double ipa."
"Like this beer a lot. While not complex, it wears its flavors well."
" Overall: Really enjoyed this beer would love to have a regular basis . Coming straight from a hophead I really recommend anyone who is looking to try this beer"
"O-This beer is excellent. One of the best DIPA"""s I've had. Big thanks to badboyrsl84 hooking me up with this."
"O - Very good. Pretty bitter but i enjoy that. One of the better IIPA's ive tried."
"Pour looks like a burnt honey color with a bit of off white head. My eyes light up with the smell. Sticky hop wrapped in pine and covered with some good old sweet citrus. Lovely. Carbonation is about what you want in a ipa. Not overly and certainly not under. Get the nice hop bite but it quickly goes away. Initially thought it may be aggressive but I was wrong. Very solid beer. Easy to drink even at 8%."
"O- This is an amazing representation of a West Coast IPA. . This beer is all about the variety of hops and by no means a balanced DIPA. Can’t wait to try Duet. Thanks again Brian!"
"Cheers!"
"Not the biggest DIPA in the world but it packs nice flavors and drinks very well. Not overly bitter and the hop profile displays brewing skill instead of just dumping in a bag full of hops."
"Alpine has created my benchmark for IIPA. This was my first experience with Alpine and now I am itching for more."
"An enjoyable and in some ways surprising beer. Drinkable and delicious."
"O: great beer! Another imoressive Alpine brew!"
"O- I would drink this anytime, anyplace."
"Finish: Long and spectacular! layered and layered to perfection. Balanced, yet overwhelmingly hoped. Just blows you away. An IPA lover's dream beer."
"Medium bodied, fine carbonation, sticky, dry, and unrelenting on the tongue. This is a fantastic DIPA, and one which provides a true hop attack without too much residual sweetness, booze, or malt."
"O: Another great beer from Alpine Beer Company. Huge hops and nice malt balance. Seek this one out for sure."
"Great DIPA overall. Would drink this more if it was easily available to me."
"For the hop head, as perfect a beer as you could get. The color is golden with a touch of red. The head starts out plentiful and fades to a wispy film. Retention is fair, but lace is sticky and copious. A moderate amount of tiny carbonation bubbles. Aroma is a wonderful balance of grapefruit and caramel with the citrus taking a slight edge. Soft to medium soft mouthfeel and medium body. Flavor is a lot like the aroma, but more emphasis on the hops. Not overly sweet like many DIPAs, but on the dry side. Mild and long bitter finish. Spectacular."
"Overall - An unbelievable IPA. This is what makes west coast IPAs so much better than east coast. I do miss a hint of sweetness, but it certainly doesn't take away from the magnificence of the hops."
"o: great double...I can't say I was expecting the maltiness though I'm so happy it isn't a strong one like a hercules double IPA. this is very well balanced and the malts are very complimentary of the delicious citrus and pine notes. there is some real tropical flavor in here as well and another tremendous West Coast flavor I wish I could get more of. Will definitely try to make this happen again at some point down the road."
"D-Overall i was very pleased by this beer. Thought this was just going to be One BIG HOP bomb(which isn' bad, just kinda boring sometimes), but i was pleasently surprised that your still got the Hops flavor i love but mixed in was a grassy pine explosion that balanced quite well. Love this beer and will trade for again."
"D- Overall, just an incredible treat. This beer can hold its own with the best of them. Dangerously drinkable and thirst quenching. A staple beer for me, and a must have for anyone who loves hops."
"A pretty gold with an orange hue long with a superb three fingers of fluffy white head and leaves a pretty layer of spider webs along the glass. Nose has hints of tropical fruit, tangerine and a lot of sweet citrus with some bright pine. Taste is very impressive full blown grapefruit bitter hop attack, very plinyesque. My preference is for Nelson or fresh Sculpin as i love all the tropical fruit, this is an extremely well done d/ipa and i was very happy to get some on my trip to SD. Very easy to drink with a nice refreshing hop attack to remind you what it is."
"O-nice berr. Loving alpine the more and more I have it!"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A very solid representation of the Double/Imperial IPA style but deceptively fruity in the nose and herbal in flavor. Well balanced across the board, this brew is a pleasure to drink. It wasn't until I was half way through my glass that I realize this was 8% abv and it produces a nice warmth across the back of the throat. Well done Alpine."
"A good DIPA for sure, but truthfully not great, nothing I would go out of my way to trade for again. Freshness may be a factor to that, but with no bottle date I can't say for sure."
"O- Excellent DIPA, everything you could ask for in a Imperial IPA. Grapefruit, citrus, pine, slight hints of malt, just amazing."
"Pours a clear / golden orange with big creamy head with that retains nicely and laces all the way down the glass. Smells of huge, fresh cut hops, grassy, piney, and actually a little spice from the hops. Taste is a delight. Fresh, multiple variety hops blast the buds followed by a hit of citrus rind and a nice malty finish that balances things out. Medium in the mouth, no lingering bitterness. Drinkability is off the charts. I have been holding on to this one for a while, Now I have the """Duet""" to try."
"Overall: I could drink this all day especially on a hot summer day which will be hear soon. Goes down real easy for a double ipa. Alpine once again lives up to its name with another stellar ipa. Just a wonderful medley of tropical flavors with a little bitterness to let you know your drinking a higher IBU ipa but still very smooth. I have had most the Alpine IPA's and will have to get my hands on the last one I want to try--Nelson."
"O- Overalll a great beer. many good beers come from this brewery and look forward to enjoying more of this in the future."
"O: This is a good one. I'd make it a regular if it was available in our area."
"Pours a very clear light orange color with a nice 2 inch white head that fades to a small cap. Very thick and craggy head on this beer. Leaves a very nice lacing pattern on the drink down. Head stays as a small island in the middle of the glass. Smells of citrus zest, sweet malt, pineapple juice. Tastes of pine/citrus zest hops up front with a caramel malt finish. Slight pineapple too. Mild bitterness in the mouth after each sip. Good carbonation leaves a very crisp and smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a very good DIPA that is hard to find around these parts. I am glad I got to try this one."
"O - Really awesome DIPA. Fresh flavors and a very drinkable and enjoyable beer that I hope to have the chance of trying again sometime."
"Perhaps not quite as aggressive, explosive and, um...abrasive...as some of the other popular DIPAs, including the Elder, but the smooth, refined juiciness, sets Pure Hoppiness apart."
"Enjoy."
"Definitely looking forward to trying more Alpine brews."
"Drinkability is good, extremely inviting but could see it getting old. The pine after taste is excellent."
"Drinkability is high. This goes in my top 5 IPA/DIPA reminds me a lot of Surly Abrasive and I love that beer. Hell of a job Alpine."
"D- One of the best among west coast IPAs. I'd love to do a side by side blind with this and Elder. Anyone wanna help?"
"D: High end DIPA, definitely in the class with the big boys...highly recommended if you are a hop head."
"Good medium body and carbonation and it goes down very easily for an 8% beer. One of my favorites and I wouldn't ever turn it down."
"This beer simply does everything very, very well without feeling forced or gimmicky. A DIPA of the highest quality."
"Overall - Another great brew from Alpine, and I must say that I've never been disappointed with any of their offerings. It has been exactly 53 weeks and 2 days since I've had one of their beers on draft, and it feels like a lifetime."
"This was not as good to me as exponential hoppiness, duet or hoppy birthday, all enjoyed within the last week or so. Maybe this one is old. If so, I'm not apologizing because I don't see a date stamp anywhere. I'll obviously review another bottle - I otherwise love Alpine beers."
"A superb beer. Don't pass up a chance to enjoy this one!"
"T: Hard hit of pine hops followed by bready malts. A bit of creaminess to this beer along with a flavor that I can only describe as buttered popcorn. A slight caramel sweetness pairs well with the massive amounts of hops. Another stellar IPA from Alpine."
"D-this is a very nice ipa, the bitterenss is not overly assertive and does not linger but makes a nice presence. the hops are bright and juicy but don't force themselves in your face. solid beer here!"
"Drink- Alpine makes some damn good beers. The two big DIPA's I have had have been very good. Its spicy and flavorful and aggressive but palatable."
"The beer was enticingly hazy with a bright orange glow and a nice little tuft of rocky eggshell foam. The beer smells very green like freshly peeled grapefruit, crush spruce needles and orange zest. There is a little bit of fruity hop aroma but this is a deep forceful hop presence, not for the meek or faint of heart. The beer tastes a little sweet at first with a little biscuity malt, but that quickly fades as the deeply resinous hops rolls over the tongue. The beer is perfectly carbonated with thick full mouthfeel and just enough playful bubbles to keep it light. The alcohol is well hidden and the beer was very tasty, living up to expectations"
"D - Very well balanced and I'd love to drink more!"
"The beer had a medium mouthfeel, and was well carbonated and creamy. I found it quite tasty and refreshing."
"Alex, thanks for the great box of West Coast IPAs. They were all very good and all very different. Nice to see the variety."
"Pure hoppiness is beer candy. It poors a nice light golden color with a decent head and slight lacing. Smells are of sweetness and hops with some orange and lemon. Decent smell with a good deal of hops and sweetness. It is sweet and citrusy up front with a hoppy finish. Very pleasant blend of flavors. This is a great ipa that is different from most I've tried."
"The CPJ"
"d - A very smooth, easy drinking DIPA; I was surprised there wasn't as much bitterness. Lots of pine in this one and I thought it smelled great and fresh. Would like to have again."
"Big thanks goes out to Sixofsigmas for sending me this as an extra in a past trade! Served from bottle into a Duvel tulip. Poured yellow yellow-orange with a four finger bone white head that subsided to a two finger very very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grapefruit, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, strong citrus, lemongrass, grapefruit, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was quite the exceptional brew. The flavor and aroma on this one were nothing short of excellent. The citrus aspect of this one definitely brought this brew up to another level. This one is really worth the trouble of seeking out if you have not had it before. It makes sense why this one is currently in the Top 100."
"So happy to have this, the growler might not last very long at all."
"Yet ANOTHER amazing Alpine IPA!"
"Notes: Easily one of my favorite beers, and probably the only rival to Pliny the Elder. It's too simplistic to call it a hop-bomb - yeah, they crammed a crapload of hops in here, but there's plenty of everything else. I'll be drinking this as long as they brew it."
"D - Goes down very easy for it's style. Could be potentially dangerous it is so drinkable. This brew is right up there with the best of the style."
"Well, it's certainly bitter, hoppy and enamel ripping. That harsh bite stays on your tongue for quite a while. There's a good piney taste to it although it's not quite as fruity as some other beers. Mouthfeel is very light and crisp, sublime carbonation. Nice easy drinking beer that hides its abv very well."
"I don't think Pure Hoppiness is a beer that you will sip. You will drink as much as you can quickly and happily, and then finish drunk."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever had of any style. I enjoy it much more than all of the other Alpine IPAs I've had so far including Exponential Hoppiness. Highly recommended!"
"I very much appreciate johndoe8 for including this first as an extra and then getting this for me a second time."
"D: Not as hoppy as I thought it would be, but a very nice IPA!"
"D - easy to drink, quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability- A bit bitter to be very drinkable but overall not too shabby ;)"
"Too bad I had to split a bomber."
"Well I will revisit this beer sometime when I know how old the bottle is. This was just overly sweet and no hop presence. Had there been hops to balance out the sweetness this would probably have scored much higher for me. It was still drinkable, but not what I was looking for considering I was hoping for an Imperial IPA."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bomber into a pint glass. The beer is a bright copper coloring with a fomay, quick to disipate head. Aromas of pine and foresty hops, with sweet highlights. Initial tastes are sweet and flowery, with a full fisted punch of hops explosion to the back of your mouth. Citrus undertones help to balance the entire taste attack. Very green on the aftertaste, with pine notes lacing the hops flavors. Bittersweet aftertastes, blended of hops and citrus. Smooth yet crisp finish. Easy on the palate despite the heavy flavors, making the beer extremely easy to drink. Fantastic beer!"
"D: Wow. So easy to drink. The best balanced DIPA to date for me."
"22 oz Bottle - got a few in trade. Feeling like something hoppy and this one did the trick. Pours out a light copper with a decent white head. Beautiful citrus and hop aroma. Terrific flavors and a little bit of grapefruit sweetness. Offers up some tangy, bitter hops and some wonderful pine resins throughout. A nice balance and very easy drinking. Enjoyable."
"D: This was my first Alpine brew and it definitely didn't disappoint. Awesome drinkability!"
"Slightly hazy gold pour with a loose white head. Very floral and dank with lots of citrus, heavy pine on the finish, a long evergreen aftertaste, hints of tropical fruit in the middle and a grassy, alcoholic finish. Sticky, resiny medium body with lots of carbonation."
"Wow! Pours a hazy golden with a good head and plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is orange with lots of fruit and citrus rind and a strong piney character as well. The flavor is again tons of orange and various citrus (both rind and fruit), The beer is very dry and piney with some fruity malt and yeast character. Really one of the best West Coast IPAs I've ever had."
"Drinkability - Hard to get beer here in Texas. Great IPA to try, highly recommend, very well balanced IPA easy to drink, very smooth, nice and refreshing, bring the spring season out from the cold."
"Drinkability: Just amazing, there is not more that needs to be said about it."
"(45)"
"Drinkability is high. This one goes down very easy for an 8% DIPA!"
"D: Very good for any hop lover. Nice light malt base allows for the hops to come through while allowing this beer to go down real easy."
"Pours a hazy orange-ish color with yellow hints and a light tan head. In the aroma, grapefruity and orange citrus hops. In the taste, grapefruity and orange citrus hops, but more orange, also both being a bit dry. A small bite, but mainly smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry citrus hop aftertaste. Big hops and quite good."
"I could drink this everyday...another great hop-bomb from the west-side! This beer will remain on my wants list."
"D-- Big and aggressive. Very in your face. A big time sipper for a DIPA. Bigger than the listed 8% ABV but well hidden.Massive is all I can say. Enjoyed every bit of this. lower score for the 22oz format. Would be a near 5 for a 12oz. Amazing beer."
"-very good straight up IPA. this is a very pitcher friendly beer!"
"This beer appears a slightly hazy yellowish orange hue. Random bits of sediment can be found floating about. There is about an inch of head that leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. I didn't enjoy this beer as much as Duet, but still thought it was decent. The beer has nice hop and grapefruit flavors. The feel is sticky and coats the palate. It's slightly sweet and finishes with a hint of alcohol. Overall, a solid beer and worth a try."
"D: Too easy to drink - at 8% ABV, they'll get on top of you quick though."
"I'm not giving up on this beer. I was simply astounded by the other two previously mentioned, so I'm going to seek out another trade of this to review."
"pours a pale hazed peach color with a great fresh billow head and sticky clingy lacing..smell is pine ,citrus.sweet floral hop resins some malt and bread in the background..taste is a hop heads dream..its pine hops.citrus hops ,floral hops,tropical hops..its balanced with the hop assault with sweet caramel malts and bread tones in the back of the mouth..mouth feel is is medium full of hops delicious and void of ABV..this bomber disappeared like water went down fast and oh so good...so drinkable so fresh so hoppy"
"D: Sessionable DIPA? This is it, has all the aroma and nose of the huge hop bombs but not over the top with bitterness, also a little lower in alcohol which helps. If this was on tap I'd have no problem having a few pints. Nicely done."
"Very tasty and drinkable IPA. I should have gotten more, cause I want another bomber right now."
"Pale hazed apricot hue with a large thicket of finely bubbled billowing off white head. Chunky textured rises up above the rim of my glass, aromatics play the part cutting through your senses with grapefruit pith, sweet baby aspirin tones and herbal grassiness. Sweet sugar coated hops come through with a strong long lived bitterness this is West Coast IPA. I actually enjoy the diacetyl put forth in these beers, I don't see it as an off flavor just a nice complimentary flavor compared to most other big hoppy beers out there. I'm thoroughly impressed with the three IPAs I've had thus far. Big brash bitter but balanced with a nice biscuit breadiness/buttered bread really comforting malt profile with herbaceous, spicy hops and citrus grapefruit pith. Pretty incredible tasting IPA, I'm glad to have the opportunity to try these brews. This is rounded out from front to back hop flavor hits the palate oily slick with resin, medium to fuller bodied soft fluffy carbonation gotta love this stuff. Inredible drinkability compared to most big hoppy ales, this one is full of finesse. My friend and brother may have to make a pilgrimage out to this brewery someday in the near future, we all love these beers. Outstanding effort, I plan to imbibe more of these and possibly an Exponential Hoppiness to one up this one."
"Medium bodied, nice carbonated, smooth, and creamy. A very nice DIPA which I could drink again and again."
"The feel of this beet is medium bodied with some strong hop flavor that is strong but easy to handle. It goes down well and is just the right mix for a West Coast IPA."
"D: One of the better DIPA's I've had, but not quite the best. Close though. Extremely drinkable with an exceptional hop profile. Thanks again Jeff for the great brew!"
"Pours a crystal clear golden amber with a puffy one-finger head which dissipates slowly with solid retention and excellent lacing. As soon as I popped the cap, the hops jumped out of the bottle. Huge citrus aromas with grapefruit, orange and lemon zest. I did pick up some pine in the nose along with some faint bready malt sweetness. Very nice aroma. Not surprisingly, the taste is big on citrus hops as well. I got even more pine in the taste especially with the finish, which was nice and pleasantly bitter yet smooth. Creamy mouthfeel heavy on the hop oils and prickly on the tongue with the strong carbonation. This is one of the better DIPA's I've tasted recently and I would drink this all night long if I could get it."
"D- Very easy to drink, just wish the taste was equal to the smell..."
"D - Well this is definitely a hop bomb so if thats your thing you'll love this one so for all you hop heads out there give this a try"
"Another great beer from Alpine. While it's probably not my favorite of their offerings, it is a darn good beer. Wish this stuff was available on this coast, as it would be a staple of my beer drinking selection."
"D - Drinkability is great as the alcohol is not too apparent and the balance makes it easy to finish a bottle or Growler. I've had many of these and being purchased(month ago) from the brewery it is also the best."
"Definitely for those who like a bit more bitterness in their IPA than usual. I think I like this one a bit better on tap, but still a really nice IPA!"
"D - Great for a DIPA. Clean, dry and crisp. Refreshing and full flavored, this is a great DIPA, world class for sure."
"Drinks: impressively. Having tried both Pure Hoppiness and its big brother Exponential Hoppiness, it's clear that the brewers at Alpine know their way around hops. I'd rank this among the top IPAs in the country."
"Notes: First beer from Alpine and it was awesome. Really need to get my hands on Nelson and Duet next."
"Flavor has similar characteristics, with only a tiny bit of a bready malt base noticeable. Very enjoyable brew. The hop profile is outstanding. VERY drinkable for how strong it is."
"Had this in same session with expo hop, nelson, and duet... and while they are all great, i'd probably pick this if I had to pick one...but I get the feeling that opinion would probably vary week to week for me."
"The beer is certainly palatable-- I've had a bottle that I found to be much better than this..."
"Drinkability:I was expecting more hop bite from this beer, but I ordered it online, so there's no telling how long it's been on the shelf. It did still have delicious and unique hop flavors."
"Pours a nice honey orange color with a big creamy off white head with stained glass lacing and great retention. The aroma is big mango gelato followed by clementines and some honey on the finish. The flavor has some big time Clementine acidity with some bright lemon bitter oil characteristics. The malt profile is lacking a little bit but the hops are fresh and definitely present. The mouthfeel is a touch thin, yet highly smooth and easy to pair with light seafood dishes and chicken. Drinkability lacks because it so hop forward it loses balance and really needs food or else it gets lost the hops. Aroma is unreal, but drinkability suggests that it needs food."
"D: It's a pretty good DIPA. It's not the best I've ever had, but I wish there was a brewed-on date so I could know if this bottle had a little age on it."
"MF/D: a buzz of carbonation that fades rather quickly leading to a rather smooth swallow."
"Drinkability -- Quite good, but it didn't knock my socks off. Certainly not as good as, say, Nelson, but a worthy addition to a stellar IPA/DIPA lineup."
"Taste has a cool, uniquely minty and pithy hop profile, flowery even. Plenty of bitterness here and a decent amount of flavoring hops. Has a malt balance similar to Pliny, light caramel and grainy. Bitterness gets rougher as it warms and shows some rough edges. Flashes of bready yeast actually come through, nice. ABV feels and tastes right at about the 8% that it is, and I like the fact the alcohol is not over the top. Good beer, quite drinkable. I would probably put this third, after Sculpin and Pliny for best IPA/DIPAs that I have had."
"D - Refreshing and delicious. ABV is not too crazy."
"D: Wasn't too fond of this beer but maybe because I'm just not used to the sweeter hops. Too fruity and sweet for my tastebuds."
"d-like it more than duet, less than nelson. but hell, that's pretty damn good. fruity pebbles ipa. i dig it."
"A very good DIPA that doesn't go overboard on the bitterness factor but highlights the other aspects of a hoppy beer."
"D: Very solid IPA that I would seek out again -- easily drinkable and would pair well with a pasta or fish entree."
"Bottle. Pours a deep orange/amber color with a nice 1 finger fluffy white head. Strong aroma of citrus and sweet malt. The taste is quite nice without being too hop overpowering. Very well balanced with what they call the """hop bite""" and the end. More citrus rind hop flavors than pine. Lack of alcohol taste for being 8%. Mouthfeel is slightly off in my opinion as it seems like it should be slightly heavier. This isn't a bad beer by any means but I think I was expecting a little more out of it."
"Edit: I just had this beer again (2/18/11) and it is friggin' amazing."
"Overall a very solid brew... I have a bottle of Nelson and Duet from these guys and can't wait to see how they measure up..."
"Out of Duet, Nelson, and Pure hoppiness. This one was the worst of the three. I recommend Duet if you are going to choose."
"Much love for yet another Alpine product. I can see why they are in such huge demand. I would buy this again and again if available locally."
"Consumed: 7/31/2010"
"D - the lingering bitterness makes this one go down fast since I'm constantly trying to have another sip. I like the aroma more than the flavor but this is a nice DIPA. It would be nice to have this easily available but I am not going to go nuts trying to obtain another bottle. Good beer but not mind blowing."
"4.5 D: I'm glad I ended with this one as it is the best. The other two were tasty, but this one is the best tasting and it also has the best mouthfeel by far. Based on the 4 Alpine IPAs I've had now, I can say Alpine makes some good hoppy brews."
"Overall a very nice DIPA. Not outstanding but glad I had the chance to try it."
"D: By far my favorite of the Alpine IPAs at this tasting. I'm not really a fan of hop bombs, so with a name like Pure Hoppiness I would have been a little skeptical, had this not been a blind tasting. Turns out I really enjoyed this beer, don't think it was overly hoppy, but while the hops were definitely there, they were quite balanced and pleasant. I would love to drink this on a regular basis."
"D - Decent drinkability, much better than Nelson, it goes down well and smooth with a nice finish. A drinkable double IPA that doesn't feel at all like a double IPA."
"All in all, PH is by far the Alpine king when compared to Duet and Nelson - I NEED to get my hands on some Exponential Hoppiness when it is released again. Can't wait!!"
"Quite drinkable. A very solid offering"
"I got an initial two fingers' worth of off-tan head with good retention from my pour. Color was a slightly hazy orangish-amber. Nose was very citrus-grapefruity. Mouthfeel was medium with a solid hops taste on the tongue. It was the sort of thing that causes a couple of east coast lager brewers that I know to muse on whether the brewer may have forgotten to add malt. There was malt, though, as evidenced by the outstanding lacing throughout. For me, it was an indulgence in my hop habit. The ABV makes it a bit difficult, but otherwise, I found it to be an eminently drinkable beer. Finish had the whacking """hop bite""" for which the label indicated they were striving."
"If you're content with grabbing a six-pack of mega-brew from your local convenience store, quit reading this now. If, however, you've somehow become addicted to the flowers of the Humulus lupulus, you may have finally met your match. Alpine Beer Company has raised the bar for hop aroma, nose, mouthfeel and aftertaste. Opening a bottle of Pure Hoppiness is like spraying an aromatherapy can around you -- except instead of lavender and jasmine, the air becomes filled with a citrusy-floral aroma which invites you to investigate and discover the pot of gold at the end of the brown glass bottle. And the smell is such a tease when compared to the smooth ultra-hopped flavor of the beer itself. Mildly malty, well-carbonated with a pale yellow color, this beer is pure homage to the hop."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable DIPA and I would easily buy this again if I had access, but Duet worked better for me."
"D: great DIPA from alpine brewery, these guys really know how to brew some bad ass west coast hop bombs. I'm lucky I can go down the street anytime and pick some up."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Slight bitterness up front but it fades away quickly leaving a nice sweet malt flavor. A very drinkable and refreshing beer with a nice balance to it. This was my first taste of Alpine's beer and I'm looking forward to trying more from them."
"Pours a deep golden bronze, topped with a beautiful inch of meringue-like white foam. I get more malt than I expected on the nose, but also a good amount of the expected citrusy and piney hops. On the palate, somewhat dry, with grapefruit, tangerine and pine, backed by a solid malt foundation. The alcohol is very present and noticeable, especially in the second glass."
"Poured into my Zatec fluted glass. Not an incredible amount of head, about 1 and a half fingers, but laced decently. Very dark amber color. Nose is classic fresh citrusy hops. I could sniff this beer all day. A bit piney. Great fresh citrus, not much heat prevalent. Refreshing, medium carbonation. Alcohol is hidden well. The perfect beer to me."
"Definitely impressed with Alpine's beers."
"If this was available locally, I'd have it more often!"
"Having had this and the Exponential Hoppiness, I can only say that Alpine Brewery has produced two really fine examples of the west coast art of the hop."
"A very enjoyable DIPA. If you're a fan of the style you won't be disappointed in this one."
"Didn't detect any of the advertised 8% ABV. But, that's likely because the glass was empty before I had a chance to. Pure Hoppiness is as drinkable of a DIPA as I've ever tasted. I'm convinced that Alpine can do no wrong. Next stop: Exponential Hoppiness."
"Taste is similar but with a sweet backbone that stops just short of balance which is great for the style. And the mouthfeel is better on this then the other Alpine ipa i had lastnight, it has more carbination and provides exactly what i was missing in the other, a crisper hop delivery. doesn't have the most dry finish i could hope for but still good and expected for the balace, and makes for an enjoyable bomber top to bottom."
"Pretty good DIPA, I prefer Nelson and Duet from Alpine over this one, but I would definitely drink it again..."
"Pours a cloudy copper with a one-finger head which settled into a coating, leaving light lacing. Nose was a wonderful floral, pine and citrus, especially orange and mango. Carbonation was evident and mouthfeel was on the light side for a DIPA. Taste was hop forward, cut well with orange, grapefuit and sticky, bready malts. The bitterness is there at the finish, but this is not one of those screw-with-your-mouth hop bombs that leaves your mouth numb. Instead, this is a pleasant and well-balanced brew, albeit hop-focused. This characteristic is what seperates the great DIPA's from the others for me and this IS a great DIPA. The hype is justified. Now if we could only get this fresh on the right coast..."
"A classic."
"This is the last beer from my Secret Santa haul and I must say this is the best of the bunch. This beer pours a a nice hazy yellow/orange color with a nice carbonation activity present after the pour. There is a decent white one to two finger head that sticks around for a little while. The smell isn't anything special but a nice solid smelling IPA. The taste is where this beer set itself apart. The taste is a nice smooth balance of hops and malt. There is little bitter taste, rather I am picking up a nice mellow even taste the beer. To me, this tastes more like an IPA than a DIPA. A very nice tasting beer that is easy going down and very well balanced. Thanks to to stevemcqueenjr for this beer. I have had other Alpine beers and this is hands down the best offering I have had."
"D - hops dont completely take over the show, but are in the forefront where they should be for the style, beer does not try to do too much, hard to put down as each drink leaves you wanting another, going to be going after more of their hop forward brews"
"Drinks fairly easy, but the hop mix isn't quite pulling together for me. Hops aren't popping enough or in the right way. Dye in the wool hopheads may think I'm dead wrong. My guess is this shines on draft or on cask. This is better than the overall score, aesthetics made this one one fall short for me"
"D: the whole beer went down quite easily but when it got warm it had a little soapy taste to it. other than that its a well made beer for an everyday DIPA but nothing to crazy"
"Overall, of the 4 top 100 alpines, this is the easiest to drink, but a little on the boring side."
"D - Starts out very easy to drink. Becomes quite bitter as you go and as it warms up. Better cold, and a pretty solid thirst quencher."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied, tight and piercing, very nice."
"Pours a deep copper color, not too dark, but not super pale. Very clear. The head is huge, nice and sticky looking, which leaves a cascade of lace with each sip. Very nice looking. The smell is pungent, leafy, and floral. Suprisingly, it lacks a real frutiness, but there are notes of citrus rind, like the white stuff, the bitter, not too fruity stuff. Though it really does smell like just like hops (dried flower buds, full of pollen and resinous aromatics). Nice, but I wish there was a little more fruit. The taste comes back with some fruit, not flesh, juicy, sweet fruit, but like grapefruit and bitter orange. Maybe a tiny bit of mango, but the bitter outer edges of the flesh. And it's also pumped up with a ton of grassy, piney tastes, which of course, begin to distract you from the fruitiness. The bitterness is nice, like a little kick, but it doesn't overwhelm the hop flavor and the slight sticky maltiness. You do get a quite sticky maltiness, mixed in with a little alcohol, but the alcohol is certainly subdued (which is a characteristic I really like in a DIPA. Tastes in a lot of respects like liquid flowers, resinous, the felling of pollen, leafy bitterness, a little peachy, super dry. Very nice. And as it warms, you start to notice the sweetness, and you start to get more sweet orange. The body is around medium, and very dry, with good moderate carbonation, just enough of a bit to keep it lively. And the hop resins really make it stick, giving you a little flavor to stay around and think of. But really, this is very nice. It has the kind of balance you expect in a DIPA, enough to distract from overwhelming bitterness, and really provide a nice body and the tiny amount of sweetness needed to make the fruitiness of the hops pop. Really, though, the hops shine, and the resinous, pungent varieties of hops. Very raw hoppiness. Maybe a little more fruit, and a bit stronger of a smell could put help this surpass all others, but as it is, there may only be 2 or 3 ahead of it. Really a brilliant DIPA."
"This is a phenomenal west coast ipa. Big, fresh nose of hops: citrus, slight pine/resin notes, tropical notes, such as pineapple, and just enough spice. The look is pretty incredible. Tons of sticky lacing surrounding a orange/golden transparency with just enough head for the style. PH tastes just as it smells--tons of hops with a sweet bite on the finish. Finishes surprisingly clean with just enough stickiness to complement the huge hop kick. In terms of drinkability, I wish I had another."
"If anyone is looking for a substitute for PtY, I say look no further than Alpine's Pure Hoppiness!"
"I could drink this often. Very driinkable and has an attractive demeanor. I can't wait to try exponential hoppiness."
"Taste is bitter, citrusy hops. There is a little pine in there too. Lots of bitterness. A hint of biscuity malt in the background. As the name implies, its Pure Hopiness. If you dont like unbalanced hoppy IPAs this isnt for you, I enjoy it however."
"Some IPAs work better than others on cask but I was pleased to find that this was one of the best that I've had the honor of trying this way. Mellow and silky feeling from the cask conditioning, yet this still was able to fully unleash those West Coast hops without dampening any of their fury. Just a great incarnation here of an already fantastic American IPA."
"Reflecting after having Exponential Hoppiness after this, PH was easily my favorite of the two. EH obviously offered more hops, but in the bottle we tried they tasted as being added for the sake of being big and hoppy and lacked the overall balance and awesomeness of this beer. Additionally I found the aroma for this beer to be nearly perfect, a blend of citrus and pine, and much more agreeable to me than EH. Flavor and body are certainly hoppy and brutal on the palate, but if you've had many of the other big IPA/DIPAs the balance and smoothness of this hop bomb are remarkable. The hops and their bitterness is supported by a strong grain and caramel malt body. Overall, incredible balance for a hop bomb DIPA, I need to find more of this beer."
"D: Very nice. Refreshing and smooth."
"D: This beer is a very good representative of its style, without demonstrating any single pronounced attribute. What is so special about Pure Hoppiness? I don't know, it's just good. That said, drinkability suffers a little due to the high alcohol content and the fact that it is represented in the flavor."
"Of course, that is extremely knitpicky which in the long run is pretty inconsequential. This is a good beer, good rep of the american ipa style. If you love ipa and can't get enough of the gnarly ones then this is probably not the beer for you but if you're a beer lover and like Ipa as a style then try this bad boy out!"
"D - I can't stop drinking this beer, so glad I bought more than one bottle."
"The flavor is wonderfully dry. There's a bit more malt presence than Pliny the Elder, but it's a rather similar beer otherwise. There's a dry yeast note that makes the feel a bit rough, but I'm just nitpicking. This is a fantastic beer. I only wish that Alpine would distribute it more regularly to Northern California."
"The Pure Hoppiness pours a bright orange color with the usual Alpine frothy head and very good retention. Very good clarity and a great start to this IPA with the pour. Usually the aromas of IPAs blend together but this one is very unique to me. The nose isn't really overpowering with hops but there are still plenty present. A very nice citrus sweetness is also present but not quite like the other IPA's. I think there is a lot of caramel and malts present as well. After allowing the brew to warm up a bit, the taste is dominated with hops, but without a very bitter aftertaste. Some pines and the citrus fruits linger on the palate. Mouthfeel is crisp and medium bodied. Drinkability is high considering it being a west coast IPA but for me a little less than the other IPA's from Alpine. A great beer nonetheless."
"Drinkability is good, a nice easy drinking DIPA."
"Drinkability - Starting from a clean palate, meaning no beers before this one, not a bad DIPA. I like the fresh hop profile, the resiny introduction, but this is lacking something for me. The taste leaves you too fast. I'm looking for more of a punch and deeper taste profile. I would still recommend."
"M/D - Medium body with a frothy carbonation. Overall, I would highly recommend this beer."
"Bottle pours amber/orange color with tan head. Aroma is big pine, citrus, and bold hops. Has a medium mouthfeel and has hop blast upfront with mostly citrus coming through. Grapefruit rind, pine, and just really tasty resinous hops. Some malt on the back end and is overall a really nice IPA."
"D: Very quaffable, something I'd seek out again. I was much more a fan of it's bigger brother Exponential Hoppiness, though."
"Great brew. Memorable!"
"This one is a tad fuller than medium bodied and it has a high level of carbonation that splashes the flavor in every crevice of your mouth. Not as sticky as I would like, but the (relatively) lighter nature of this compared to some other DIPA's helps with the drinkability. This is a beer that would pair very well with food. Another winner from Alpine."
"Mouthfeel, again, the sweetness which I'm guessing may be a less frequent yeast strain than I'm used to in dipas, nice touch."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and seemes to coat the entire palate. Drinkability is great because it is so smooth and crisp. I am going to have to pick up some more of these because it was addicting."
"Highly sip-able and coupled with the fresh hop flavor and creamy mouthfeel makes this DIPA's drinkability impressive to say the least."
"the one problem i do find is i wish there was a more prominent malt finishing to the beer to go with the abv. otherwise i LOVE THIS BEER!"
"D - An nice DIPA that I could several times in one session. Easier to drink then Expo for me, and more """down the middle of the road""" compared to the uber-hoppy Expo."
"I had a bottle of this, and thought it was better out of the bottle. A more vigorous pour lead to much more aromas and taste, in my opinion, then what was served on tap."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is pretty solid. Overall, really, really good IPA. One of the better west coast offerings IMO. Wish I had more. Skal."
"Easy to drink."
"Overall this a very nice American DIPA from Alpine, but I must say that I may have a preference for Duet (IPA) over this, but that is not to say that this is not a really nice beer. Thanks again Dan for supplying me with this. Recommended."
"Overall one of the better West Coast Hop Bombs I've tried in quite some time. I don't always drink hoppy beers, but if this were more easily available it would definitely be a regular in my fridge. ISO more Alpine Brews!"
"It doesn't always follow that """hoppiness is happiness," but in this case it definitely does. Thanks again, Brian!"
"Gold in colour with a bit of haze. The beer was capped by a half inch of fine white foam that left a smidge of lace on the glass. Good head retention. Intense hop aroma with lots of grapefruit, orange, tangerine, and citrus peel/oil. Solid bitterness with lots of citrus (oranges and grapefruit) and slightly spicy hop flavour. There was just enough malt to keep it from completely drying out. Medium bodied with well hidden alcohol and a light hop dryness. Smooth carbonation that was average in quantity, nice texture. There's a ton of hops in there, but still comes across as balanced. Great aroma and flavour."
"Overall another outstanding hoppy beer from Alpine. I liked Nelson better then Duet and now Pure Hoppyness better then Nelson. I can't wait to try the Expo hoppyness I have coming."
"Just a delicious fantastic brew. Maybe not quite on the level of the unique AleSmith IPA or archetypal Pliny the Elder that I also got from Joey, but really delicious nonetheless."
"edit: I had another bottle last night and it was amazing. The room filled with pine scents as soon as I popped the top. The flavor was much """pinier""" than the last time, and it was more sticky. I don't know if it was just bottle variation, but the bottle I had last night was great."
"Pours a light orange color with a white head. The first thing that hits you in the aroma is hops, with tons of pine and citrus in the nose. The flavor has a good amount of bitterness, but the hop flavor is outstanding. Tons of orange citrus with a little pine and grapefruit. This is one complex hop bomb. Medium carbonation and medium body. Very drinkable and I wish this available in Texas."
"Christmas present from sister-in-law, sent from southern California. Close to perfect west coast IPA and I'm consider myself a discerning IPA fan, partial to west coast hops and malts. I'm not sure what else needs to be said, yet have to meet the minimum character limit. I'm not sure how to define drinkability or mouthfeel, and really who cares what the beer looks like, but it looked fine. Citrusy hops, well balanced. I'd love to drink it every day."
"Perfectly executed as is everything I've tried thus far from Alpine."
"Notes: I would search this out high and low. Its not a blow you away brew. If your into complexity and skilled brewing this is one you must try."
"D - I think I'm in love... many mistresses have I. Very drinkable."
"D- Insane. Keep 'em coming.. I could drink a growler of this, a case of this, a keg of this and ask for more. Unreal... damn you, Cali DIPAs... damn you! You're so tasty!"
"Overall an outstanding beer from Alpine Beer Company."
"This is a terrific IIPA from Alpine. So drinkable and so tasty."
"Fantastic DIPA. I drank Alpine AND I went to bed."
"O: Solid. Like Pliny's little southern california protege. Did like their Nelson Rye a bit better. Haven't had their Exponential Hoppiness yet for comparison."
"My first beer from the Alpine Beer Company but certainly not my last."
"D - In a perfect world I'd drink this beer at least once a week!!"
"Pours a light orange with average head and lacing. Full, deep hop bitterness spread across palate. Spicy vanilla with fruity and herbal notes. Pleasantly warming, lasting, bitter finish. Bold flavor, but far from harsh - alcohol is restrained. One 22 oz. is perfect amount."
"Smooth full bodied beer. Good sweetness up front, no hint of alcohol in the flavor, no aftertaste at all. The hop flavor is midpalate and provides great connectivity between the front and the back of the mouth. Second taste, got more sweetness and more bitterness this time, its a good beer. Drinkability high and mouthfeel is really good. Very clean, not dry. A great DIPA."
"Pours a clear golden orange color with a smallish white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is filled with hops. Floral, pine and resin dominate. Tart fruit, apricots caramel and honey round the nose out nicely. Tastes like sucking on a hop cone, but in a good way. Pine and resin again dominate the flavor. Very little, if any malt makes its way to the surface. Grapefruit and apricots find their way into the middle followed by a long lingering bitter dry finish. Sticky resinous mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation. That is one fine DIPA! I'm not sure I can find anything to fault it on. Very well done."
"Pure Hoppiness was one of the first harder core IPA's that I loved. It truly is Pure Hoppiness."
"D: What can we say but, wow. We were utterly humbled in the presence of this beer. This beer deserves all the hype."
"D: This is exactly what I look for in a beer, and this makes me consider moving to San Diego county..."
"Drinkability - In my top 5 of DIPA, this could be a weekly consumption. Not disappointing to any degree, worth the trip if you can pay the fare and handle the smoothness. This beer sucked me into Alpine as a new love."
"D-It's well made I just am not a big fan of the Nelson Sauvin/Summit hop flavors personally. Granted there are other hops at work here but that one or two stick out to me a little more than the others in this beer for some reason...decent enough but not great in my mind."
"Drinkability - Very much so. I meant to drink this a couple weeks ago when I first got it but have not had a chance so I'm sure if it was even more fresh it would have been that much better. Not the """best""" DIPA I've had but pretty good."
"D: Wow I downed this one quickly. Tasty for sure and something I would surely have again, but I left feeling somewhat let down probably becasuse I had insanely high expectations."
"definitely drinkable. very little carbonation and a medium body are a combination that makes this one go quickly."
"Notes: I am so excited to finally see some Alpine brews (other than Ichabod) being bottled and distributed to some local stores. It's about damn time! I was even more excited when this was the first thing I was greeted with as I walked into my favorite spot. Pure Hoppiness is a rock solid DIPA that I enjoyed, but it doesn't approach the upper eschalon of West Coast DIPA's, in my humble opinion. Still, it's a very good beer that satisfied my hop fix for the night."
"This is just a great IPA. Bitter, hoppy, got a hint of sugar. Nice."
"FInal thoughts: Another great IPA as I expected. Lots of great hops, piney, citrus, slightly grassy, very bitter, juicy and chewy. It didn't seem to have the piney taste I thought it would, but that is probably because it's not super fresh. It also has a slight malt character that helps support the hops so you don't rip your tongue apart. This is really reminds me of Pliny but the hop character is slightly different, and the two are great but probably even better right off the tap."
"D: Pretty drinkable, but not nearly as good as Alpine's lineup of American IPA's."
"Not quite up to Pliny or Alpine's own Exponential Hoppiness, but very, very good. Glad I had a chance to try this one...definitely would love to have this one again."
"And the light, clean, haze disappeared now and giving way to a bright spring day, a dry finish, an easily tossed back beer, excellently drinkable. These trips back in the mind... such a simple life, how lovely to remember and reflect, this is where I began..."
"Rotation: not available here but will be seeking it out thru my buddies San Diego connections when I can."
"D: Yet another solid IPA from the folks down in San Diego."
"Pure Hoppiness is a soft, easy, mellow 8% DIPA that hits all the right notes for simply Having Another. Wish we could get this out my way in SC...."
"D - High. Hops are strong but not overpowering, and it's not overly syrupy."
"Beer poured a clear golden orange with a generous 2 finger white head that is leaving a perfect lacing behind. Nose is fragrant floral hops. Taste is a blast of piney hops that finishes with a light balancing malt. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and relatively smooth. Drinkability is quite good. This is a very clean well brewed double ipa that is right up there with the best in this class."
"Big thanks to unclejedi who included this, among other fresh IPAs from Cali in the 2009 Great BIF Race. Pours a vibrant amber color with a hearty one finger white head. At 8%, and having brewed some of these myself, when I see a DIPA that has this clarity, and bright amber color, I am impressed. The aroma is an absolute delicious citrus hop explosion. There are some floral and pine hints, but this one definitely has some of my favorite American hop varieties in it to produce such a lip smacking citrus aroma. Taste follows much what the aroma would indicate. A nice punch of citrus hop bitterness is not overwhelmed by the sweet malt backbone. I like my hops right front and forward, and thats what this beer has. A nice slick mouthfeel, due to high hop usage I assume. Amazingly, with this high hop profile, the beer remains incredibly drinkable, not to mention I am still stunned by the 8% ABV. Just an incredible drinking DIPA, I was surprised by exactly how much I enjoyed it. Glad I enjoyed this fresh, just wish I could do so on a consistent basis."
"This is a good, but not great, beer. Probably suffered in comparison because I had an O'Brien's also by Alpine immediately afterward and that one was far superior. I'd have this again if it were more available, but it's not something I'd bother seeking out."
"Drinkability: Its a big beer but the mouthfeel and balance helps the drinkability department."
"22oz. bottle courtesy of ThirstyBird. Poured a translucent orange-gold with a half inch bright white head that dissipated into a skim with a thick band of bubbles around the perimeter of the glass. Big grapefruit nose - sweet and tangy. Taste was not too sweet; balanced and malty with some bitterness towards the back. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a consistent level of background carbonation - a little oily with some dryness at the finish. This is an incredibly flavorful DIPA, without having to be huge. Really tasty without being overly resinous."
"Drinkability: Really great. Drinks like an IPA, with great flavor start to finish. Can't decide which I liked better, the tap or the bottle, which is weird since fresh taps of IPAs tend to blow the bottle version away in my mind, but this beer was really fantastic, and worth the praise it receives. Not Pliny the Elder, and more expensive as well, but definitely a very solid IPA that is well worth seeking out."
"D - A good beer and it grew on me more and more but it's just not up to the CA standard set by RR, Ballast Point and Stone."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. I am glad I got to try it fresh. Decent price on a bomber, so if you see one of these give it a try."
"A bizarre concoction to be sure. Seemed ok upon pour, but this must have zero malt in it. This had a high acidic note that was horrid, no bitterness. Perhaps I had a bottle that was past it's prime. I can tell this might have that high A fresh taste at bottling. Not impressed, rather horrid. Have more and will re-review."
"Good dose of malt, somewhat biscuity, but quickly the focus is back on the orange-grapefruity hops. Again there is a candied quality to the hops. Mouthfeel and body is quite creamy, and among the best for IPAs. Finish is rather long, delightfully tart, and the alcohol is masked well."
"Toasted malts up front. Orange marmalade and resinous hop flavors follow. Bitterness starts to crescendo. Light fruit sweetness mixes with some singed caramel/toffee. Hop bitterness peaks in the finish, with strong pine and resin notes. Medium-full body with a creamy feel. Very nice!"
"D: At $6 to $7 a pop, I am finding this a consistently excellent deal. I don't love it as much as Pliny the Elder, but it's still a world-class DIPA."
"The pour is bright yellow orange with some snowy white head. The nose is really fruity with lots of leafy hop cones. The flavor is just kind of a muddled mess of hops and sugar. Medium sugary body. Tangy tart finish. I don't know. I'm not impressed."
"A major hop bomb, but nothing that makes me love this one. I'd love to try this on tap though to see if my opinion improved..."
"It has been a year since I last had this beer and it was every bit as good as I remember. Truly one of the best DIPAs on the market. Only wish it was available in Northern California."
"Overall this beer is one hoppy beer, right up there with some of the best of them. A real solid brew. I must try this one again."
"Highly drinkable and a very enjoyable DIPA."
"On tap at Stone. Poured into an 8 oz glass. Dark golden color with orange highlights. Nice creamy cap of tan foam with good retention and lacing. Aroma is very resinous and tropical, with citrus zest, oranges/tangerines, and herbal notes. Flavor is pure hops, hardly any malt getting in the way. Underripe grapefruit and orange with a bitter herbal finish. Pretty solid west coast DIPA but clearly a tier below a beer like PTE."
"Poured a burnt orange color with a small white head. Nose was hop forward and even maltier than I expected with citrus and pine. Taste is grapefruit, pine and slight floral notes upfront. It was pretty chewy and sordove muted taste. Mouthfeel was chewy and sticky, heavy and I noticed less hops and more malts."
"I picked up this bottle a few months back and it was my second time trying this tastey brew from Alpine. I poured the beer from a brown 22oz bottle into my HopCat snifter. It pours with a generous two fingers of head that has a good amount of retention and lacing evern after the first 5 or so drink. The beer pours a bright orange color, almost reminds me of a less cloudy american wheat in color. The carbonation is pretty pronounced on this ale which I really like because it really gets the sweet citrus and hop smell right up into you nose during every drink and I love to smell my beer while I drink it. Overall, the beer smells more malty than hoppy, but this may be as complex a smell as I have every smelt with a DIPA. Smells citrusy, hoppy, malty sweetness with an earthy undertone....in one word delicious. The taste is much the same. It doesn't blow you out of the water with hop bitterness, instead it seems to have a boat load of flavor and aroma hops that make the beer tast absoloutely devine. The mouthfeel is light and appropriate for the beer. This is one hell of a DIPA, one of the best I've had, and unlike most I feel like I could drink bottle after bottle and not get tired of this brew. Its scarry that its 8% ABV and I think they should change the name to A Hoppy Night in Jail, cause thats what could happen. One final note, I enjoyed this beer the first time I had it more due to the fact that it was fresh. This bottle is about 4 months old and its starting to loose its charm, but still a tremendous offering from Alpine!"
"EDIT: Almost 5 years to the day from first review of this. This addition/edit based on bottles. Mouthfeel is great and beer holds up in all respect. Every bit as good, if not better, than PtE. Good beer."
"This is a little different than the usual DIPA. Sure, the faded orange color with glow and good laing is common for the style, and so are the juicy hops you get in the nose and mouth...but it smells like freshly sqeezed hops without any added weight. Hop pedals and flowers dominante with some notes of mango and pine. The malt level seems a little lighter too, which allows the hops to shine more. Hoppy, but not bitter. Not bitter at all, and decently balanced for the style. I'll take it."
"This is a great DIPA, refreshing, hoppy and bitter, yet smooth. Another West Coast IPA on the list."
"D: the flavor isn't super intense and the mouthfeel is slightly on the thin side which actually helps in the easy to drink department, but hurts it because i love intense sweet hoppy beers and syrupy ones which means i'm not longing for this as much as I could be"
"22oz bottle. Clear amber-orange colored body with a sticky head that sustains decently and leaves some streaky lace. The aroma is pretty forceful, with lots of grapefruit, orange, pine, and sweet mango. the flavor is much more hop flavor than bitterness, which caught me off guard at first. Then I remembered back to when I had exponential hoppiness, which was likewise flavorful and not too bitter; seems to be their style, and I like it. This is pretty ridiculously drinkable, but at the same time, the flavor seems a little light and muted. I'm getting a good deal of oily and resiny hops in the mouth, and just a kiss of honey sweet malt carrying it. Not really light bodied, but the oily feel that the ridiculous amount of hopping brings makes it slide quite slickly through the mouth. Alcohol is barely detectable; hardly feels like 8%. The finish is like hop flowers lingering lightly over your tongue. For a beer that is pretty much simply liquid hop flavor, I can't see it getting much better than this, but is it so much to ask for a little malt?"
"D - Great overall, enjoyed it. Will seek out again."
"The first two times I had this beer I was not impressed. This time I am blown away!"
"Pure hoppiness is highly recommended to those who, like a really good DIPA. Cheers."
"Overall impression: A very tasty DIPA. Would definitely seek this one out again."
"Very good beer. Doesn't reach my top-tier, but I'd never turn one down!"
"Overall this beer is all that it's advertised to be. Certainly worth a shot."
"D-One of my very favorite west coast DIPA's out there. I could drink this one all day. Exactly what I crave in a hop bomb."
"D: A wonderful brew. Pleasant to drink at 8%."
"Highly drinkable. This is a real Double with lots of potential for spreading the word. Don't pass it up!"
"M/D - Medium bodied and a surprisingly creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is at an excellent level. Ridiculously drinkable."
"A great brew. Would work well with a sandwich on a croissant. Surprising flavor after the hints from the aroma. Well worth trying for yourself."
"Drink Alpine Ale or go to bed!"
"Golden to light amber hue with a frothy large off-white head. Aroma is big juicy grapefruits and tangerines, a touch 'hot' from the alcohol. Flavor is a bit nutty, citrus medley of orange peel grapefruit and lemon. Good hop bitter but not overpowering - very nice balance. Finish is dry - almost crisp, but not quite. Lemony would be a better term."
"A refreshing and enjoyable beer, this is one that would be great on summer's day to go along with some grilling and baseball. While one bomber is all I need at a time, I definitely will keep this beer on my wants list for quite some time."
"Drinkability: Good, but not the best, I prefer yulesmith, ruination, pliny the younger, etc. Enjoyed trying it but will stick to those three kings. It is a little bit more drinkable than those three, the ABV is not noticeable."
"It's not as good as Pliny the Elder, which is a more fair comparison than PtY, but it's still a terrific DIPA in the west coast style."
"I love me some DIPAs. This is a nice looking one - orangey yellow, with a thick white head and great lacing. This one smells piney, tart with grapefruit rind, and fresh. Yum. Flavor is very nice, but not what I pictured from something named pure hoppiness. It has more balance that I expected, but it's still a nice hop bomb. The hops are big and juicy but don't have as long of a finish I would have liked. The mouthfeel is delicious with nice carbonation, and the drinkability is pretty good to boot. Overall, quite nice!"
"Mouthfeel and drinkability go hand in hand on this one. This is an extremely drinkable beer because the mouthfeel is so inviting. There is nothing over the top or oily about this IPA so I really could drink another if I wasn't saving it for my tasting in a few weeks."
"Overall a very wonderful beer but if given the choice I would take Pliny the elder. But often you don't have that choice so I would drink this over many beers on tap."
"Overall: Decent mouthfeel that's moderately carbonated and has a nice oily feel. Very drinkable for the alcohol and boldness. Great DIPA try it if you can get it!"
"Overall: for a DIPA fairly drinkable... very good flavors and nice balance. Unique in the malt balance and dryness with citrus hops."
"From tasting notes 1/7/09"
"Poured a 22oz bomber into my New Belgium globe. This beer pours a crystal clear honey orange, with a decent 2 inch orange-cream head that left just a hint of lacing. I will say, this is the first beer that right after I poured it, I said to myself, """Wow this looks like a beer poured in a beer commercial""". Pure Hoppiness would have definitely received a 5 if the lacing were a bit stickier. The aroma is a subtle yet distinct infusion of orangey citrus and pine needles. This is a wonderful example of a beer where both styles of hops are very prevalent in the nose. Unfortunately, there is really no hint of malty sweetness, which is supposed to be there in a DIPA. The flavor is a bit subdued for me. There are definitely prevalent hops, bunches of citrus and a bit of pine, but the bitterness just isn't there. Also, like I said earlier, there really is not a malt presence in this beer. The mouthfeel is light bodied and just a bit effervescent. No real resiny mouthfeel noted. This is a great beer, but a DIPA, I don't think so. This is just a stronger IPA and is definitely lacking some of the qualities that I look for in my double IPA's. If this was reclassified to an American IPA, I would positively reconsider my scores and put this up with Bell's Two Hearted, Firestone's Union Jack, and Ballast Point's Sculpin."
"Taste/Feel and Finish are similar to the bottled version with a pleasant light citric malt flavor and finish. Offers just a light bitterness and a great drinkability."
"D: A great DIPA. Could easily be my go-to beer if it was readily available."
"D - Drinkability is very good for the Pure Hoppiness. The body is somewhat light for the style and alcohol is almost completely hidden. That makes for a beer that disappears very quick. This one punishes the taste buds but doesn't destroy the palate like other selections from this particular style. Comes across as more of a delicate example of the Double IPA. Easily recommended."
"Nice light amber color with a big pillowy white head; great retention and lacing. Citrus and lemon zest notes in the aroma; very hop forward. Also a bit of a smell I can only describe as dank and slightly vegetal. The first taste I get is a bit of the vegetal one noted in the aroma, thankfully it goes to a combination of lemon, orange, and pine shortly thereafter. Slightly higher than medium carbonation and a little less than medium bodied. Good beer, I'd like to try this again. Thanks, Kyle!"
"One of the best DIPAs out there, and a new personal favorite."
"Nice orange/golden sort of color. Very clean looking beer. Big hop aroma-very citrusy and piney. Almost a lemon like quality to it. Big hop flavor up front. Suprisingly smooth maltiness to it. Very nice lingering bitter taste but not the """bite""" you would expect. Well balanced with the amount of hops in there. Solid mouthfeel. A terriffic beer for sure."
"This is a very nice IPA that I enjoyed more and more through the evening. Good stuff."
"Highly recommend."
"Alpine's IPA's are some of the best, and this is no different. Orange-gold pour with very little head. Thick aroma of citrus and piney hops and a bit of malt. The taste is epic. The grapefruit hops with the Cascade hops are perfectly balanced to give that sweet and bitter bite. The malt back evens everything out, making this a very smooth beer. I've seen this listed as both and IPA and an IIPA. As an IPA, this is one of the strongest, leading me to believe the IIPA is the proper category."
"Good stuff but a little weak in the hop department. I want a DIPA to crack me in the face with hop flavor and aroma. This one fell just a little short. Very good, nonetheless."
"Notes from 12/11/04"
"This is a very nice IPA from Alpine. Pours a rich amber with a big silky head. The nose has citrus and piney hops over sweet malts. The taste is powered by big malts up front but is quickly taken over by bitter fruity hops through the finish. Creamy body is well carbonated but just a tad thin in the finish. Very well balanced."
"Drinkability: An excellent beer, and an excellent DIPA. Alcohol is surprisingly reasonable - 8.0% isn't anywhere near the upper realm of DIPAs I've had - the aroma is fantastic, lacing and head retention great ... I think we have a winner. Many thanks to Phocion for hooking me up with this one. Highly recommended."
"But, hey, I'm not reviewing them or pliny or whatever. I'm talking about pure hoppiness. And it's a fine beer. Give it some more color, give it better head and I'll give it a better scrore."
"The body is a bit sweet with a under attenuated feel. Definitely astringent from the hops. Overall I think this beer is a little overhyped. Balance problems with hops and yeast problems really deter this beer from rating better."
"Overall: Sculpin"
"Hazy orange pour with a nice 2 fingers of near-white head. Huge aromas of lemon zest, pink grapefruit, kiwi...somewhat unique for DIPAs that I have tasted. Deceptively hoppy. Just when I think the hop flavor is done, it continues. Real delicate, fragrant hop taste. Light in the body. Extremely drinkable."
"Pours a clear amber with a white head. Nose is straight up pine tones. Flavor is bright. An interesting mix of citrus and pine. Slight salty edge, but it's more so a big fruity floral thing. Feel is very smooth on liquid and the carbonation is good. This is really easy to drink. Way too much so. I could sip on this all night. Too bad I can tell it's going to totally jack with my recently discovered hop allergy. (yeah...it's true)"
"First off, I didn't take notes when I tasted this beer. But it is quite memorable so hopefully that'll be sufficient. From what I remember it was a fine clear light amber color. What was most outstanding was the amazing aroma that simply exploded with hoppy goodness. The body was nicely balanced with sweet maltiness and it finished as spectacularly as it started. This is a beautiful beer."
"I love a crisp IPA. Sometimes I want a hop fix without a whole lot of boozy astringency from too much malting. This one is incredible. It is a must try."
"Golden orange coloration, nice clarity, plenty of lacing. Fresh, earthy hop aroma. Deep and resiny, some juicy citrus, bitter hop oils. Malty middle with a dry finish, an almost leafy aftertaste. Medium bodied, yet light enough to have several. A superb west-coast style DIPA, among the best in my opinion."
"Overall: A very good DIPA that represents the style perfectly. I prefer the Nelson, Duet, and O'Brien over this though. A must try. Cheers!"
"Overall this is a good beer but shy of great because of the lack of balance. But, hey, it's called """Pure Hoppiness""" not """some hops & some malt!""" I'd ditch some of the flavor hops--such a light pale ale needs bitterness and aroma but with a lesser flavor addition, I think."
"Dry finish, obviously, and a medium-level of carbonation. Very gentle and medium-bodied mouthfeel. Definitely an easy drinker, though not quite the """pure hoppiness""" I was expecting."
"this brew pours up a pale orange color with an off white head.... the nose is a very pure floral hop aroma.... the taste is pale matls, floral hops with a hole in it (? I was drunk when I wrote this)...I would like to try this again though if anyone wants to donate to the cause..."
"I prefer a bit more balance like Dreadnaught, but it is a very good brew."
"D- Oh man, this is the cream of the crop. If you like anything about hops, you will fall in love with this. It is not over the top hops.... just right. This is on my top tier with Sculpin"
"D: smooth, and appears to be mellow flavor-wise. this is really close to perfection for the style. well worthy of a try if you can get some."
"A nice, 1""" head with minimal lacing. It poured an orange color with a beautiful hoppy, floral aroma. Of course, citrus is king, both in the nose and on the tongue. The taste is amazing... a nice hop bite that finishes very dry. A little piney and pineappley to boot. This is the most quaffable DIPA I've ever had. Amazing beer from start to finish."
"Thanks again for the chance to consider this Jeff."
"Pure Hoppiness is a kick ass beer. No doubt about it. Definitely worthy of its lofty status. I do think it could be slightly improved by toning down the malt slightly. It's a small gripe. This beer is no doubt an extremely tasty west coast DIPA. Certainly one to seek out."
"22oz poured into a snifter. little head from the pour and slight lacing. pours a bright amber. lots of floral scent. big hop taste up front that mellows out. slightly carbonated tingle left in the mouth. little hop aftertaste, quite sweet. for a DIPA, i find this quite sessionable. i could drink these all day."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle to a shaker pint. Thanks to Oodeftone for this baby!! Nice hazy orange color with a fluffy white head. Tons of floral and citrusy hop aromas. This smells like a perfect west coast ipa. Taste is wonderful. Great hop biterness, but lots of sweetness to mellow it out. Has to be the sweetest IPA i have ever had. Tremendously drinkable for a dipa."
"Drinks like a Two Hearted with an extra kick to the taste buds."
"And since every beer tastes better when you know its story, know this: Pat the brewer retires from his full-time fire captain job in 2009 and will devote his days to brewing. Look out beer world."
"Growler from the brewery. Bright amber with a creamy head. I get some citrus, wood, grass and biscuity malts. Pretty bitter with the citrus fading away as it warms and the malts making more a show. Not as dry or bitter as its big brother Exponential."
"Pours a clear amber/golden, thin white head forms, big bubbles, drops to a solid ring, nice lace spots. Smell is wicked, insane hoppy, pine, caramel, grapefruit, bready brown sugar middle, floral, tangerine, jasmine, very complex. Taste is awesome as well, jasmine, bready and biscuity, caramel, orange peel, pine, grapefruit, insanely hoppy, perfect bitter finish, great. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, very drinkable, almost perfect as an IPA. Thanks Russ!!"
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. great malt and hop depth. an excellent example of the style, and one i'd be happy to drink all day."
"Drinkability is high. Very nice taste and alcohol is moderate making this beer very easy to consume."
"Tasy brew. I'm a hop lover, so I like the somewhat one deminsional taste. That's not a knock."
"D: Goes down very easy, I wish i had more!"
"Attention brewers: Alpine's Pure Hoppiness - this is your benchmark."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Hops and nothing but - the malt profile is dry and slightly biscuit-like, lending no sweetness and serving as little more than a foundation for the amazing hop character. There's plenty of complexity to be found in the hop flavor, from wildflowers to spruce, though it leans toward grapefruit and lemon. So damn light and crisp, it's hard to believe this is 8%; I've had IPAs of 6% ABV that felt heavier and maltier. The finish is punchy and bitter yet not overwhelming - this brew is really more about the hop flavor and aroma, as any good IPA should be in my opinion."
"D: This is one of the better DIPA's I've tasted recently and I would drink this all night long if I could get it. Thanks again to MiScusi for passing this one along."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and medium bodied. Great carbonation makes it go down easy and refreshing. If I could find this regularly it would be a go to brew and I could easily take down a couple bombers. Overall, another solid west coast IPA. I wouldn't say it's amazing and my favorite, but it's a damn good brew that I'm happy to have tried."
"D: Really good beer, my first from Alpine and I look forward to trying more whenever I'm in San Diego. One of the best DIPA's I've ever had for sure."
"D- This is a huge hop bomb and I think it would be quite the stretch to say it is overly drinkable. I love hops and DIPAs but this one didn't quite do it for me."
"Drinkability: Very light and drinkable for a DIPA. Very balanced for a pronounced flavor profile that it has. A great beer. Easy to quaff. Highly recommended."
"Bottles courtesy of Padrefan98 and this one in particular shared by MiguelMandingo on BA. Pour is rich amber colored in a snifter with a smallish white head. Smell is piney, hoppy and fairly aromatic fresh hops chock full of resiny goodness. Taste is much of the same with hop flavors leaning towards piney and resiny with a moderate bitterness and ample malt backing to keep it pretty balanced. For an IPA, it is quite strong, but for a DIPA, I'd say it's extremely drinkable. Very nice beer all around and thanks again for Mike for sharing this great beer!"
"A bubbley light tan head crests the glass at about two fingers tall. Body is a honey yellow gold. Head has nice retention and leaves web like lace as it slowly fades. Nose is a very floral sweet hop mixture with fresh citrus and soft piney tones. With first drink I am really taken by how smooth and refreshing the hop profile of this beer is. The hops are very fresh with sweet citrus feel. They do have a bit of grassy bitter but this is very well balanced by a lovely malt balance all along the backbone of this beer. Bitterness is very long and well received on the mouthfeel. Alchol is scary well hidden on this beer, maybe only peeks out with the boldness of the hops. This is a very drinkable tasty hoppiness of a beer."
"poured into a tulip, this was a glowing orange/deep gold in color with just a slight haze and no sediment. a diminishing white head left thick, sticky patches of lace all the way down. quite a looker, this one, and the other aspects were there as well. inviting, but not overpowering bouqet is honeyed and floral, fresh bread and resiny citric notes also present. lightly sweet malts upfront gracefully defer to an extremely smooth, lingering hop bitterness on the back end. long, pleasantly bitter, spicy/peppery, drying finish. medium to full-bodied with a nice prickly carbonation. at 8% this is a killer dipa."
"Ah yes, fill up your senses with this brew. I often get this in the bottle but found it on top at the San Diego Brewing Company and it really shines on draft. A creamier brew than you expect from an IPA. Nice foamy head that never dies down, producing a long, smooth mouthfeel. Aggressive hoppiness but not to the point where it is just a way to show how macho you are. Bravo, bravo, bravo."
"I tend to be a bit hesitant around beers with the word 'hop' in their title as sometimes they can be a bit one-sided and too much for my taste, but I think that this one is nicely balanced and could sneak up on you at 8%. I'll definitely try another if I get the opportunity."
"Great on drinkability! Moderate ABV makes this a good one to drink with some nice sharp cheese."
"The taste is pine, lots of pine. There is a balanced malt presence, and added together this is a fantastic and balanced IPA. The carbonation really sets off this flavor, as well. The finish is clean and the drinkability is off the charts. Awesome. More please."
"Highly recommended. This really is a good, clean, not too malty San Diego DIPA."
"Bottle shared by RoyMunson. This is your typical west-coast hoppy beer. Pours a nice dark gold in color. Smell is hops with some underlying malt. The thing that stands out in this beer is the development of the hop taste throughout each drink. Initially you're hit with the grassy/piney hops. Then midway through the tongue you get a bit of juiciness that shows up. Really quite pleasant and very easy to enjoy. Would be killer on tap."
"Tasty treat, better get one for a try."
"Bottle courtesy of Bu11zeye : Poured a light hazy blonde ale with a huge pure white foamy head with perfect retention and perfect lacing as well. Aroma of citrus and fresh grapefruit is just out of this world with some low bitter notes. Taste is also dominated by some fresh red ruby grapefruit with some bittering notes at the end. Probably one of the best aromas I've had in months of tasting new beers. Full body, creamy texture, perfect carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Wow!"
"Pours clear with a full finger off white head that fades to surface fairly quickly leaving a reasonable amount of lacing behind. The amber color is lighter than I anticipated. The smell is good mostly because it has a nice balance. The hop pine and grassy character mixes well with a mellow malt sweetness. The mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium. Hoppy but altogether creamy with an oily piny after taste that lingers appropriately. The lighter creamy body contributes significantly to its easy drinkability. Full flavored, the creamy texture is coming from the sweeter malt component. It doesn't come across as being a BIG beer. Another thing that I find tres cool is that it doesn't have a runaway price just because of it's reputation. Hats off to the folks at Alpine!"
"Not sure I could drink a ton of this stuff, but I am more about savoring it than chugging through. Overall I am not a huge fan of IPA/DIPA/hops in general - but I enjoyed this beer a lot."
"d. very drinkable, would buy more if i could find it over here"
"Thanks to d0ggnate for this one. I'd been wanting to try this for some time. Pours a slightly cloudy orangeish golden with a fairly minimal head. What is there stays around as a thin ring. Lots of citrusy hop aromas, particularly grapefruit and orange. Smells very fresh like just squeezed grapefruit juice and orange juice with some zest tossed in. Nice. The taste is more of the same of those delicious, citrusy, juicy, hops but this time with a pronounced pine finish as well. This beer drinks clean and pure, and while the malt is there, it clearly plays secondd fiddle to the hops. The hops are intense enough to feeel sticky and even spicy on the finish. Really lovely San Diefo style double IPA, and the 8% seems more like 6%."
"D: I'm not entirely sure this is a DIPA to me, it really has more IPA characters. I love a hop dominant IPA, but you need something to balance it out and this doesn't really have it. The hop flavor is good, but it doesn't pack quite the punch of others either. This rates right up there with some of the really good IPA's out there, but doesn't really do it for me if I'm rating it as a DIPA."
"Very good beer, I'll keep an eye out for it from now on."
"Thanks much to Ryan for this one."
"Drinkability: A fine beer that's not overly bitter, has a very tasty hop profile, and drinks very easily considering the ABV."
"Thanks to magget for sharing this brew. Served chilled, into a pint glass, from a twenty two ounce brown bottle. Poured out a beautiful golden copper color that was a bit hazy. A good inch and a half of pillowy, thick, bright white head formed, and faded rather slowly. Left generous amounts of thick lace behind on the glass. The nose on this beer was incredible. Strong floral hop aromas, tons of thick sweet malt, loads of semi sour grapefruit, lemon zest, and some brewers yeast. Awesome. The taste of this beer was quite exceptional as well. Hops, sweet balancing malt flavors, grapefruit, pineapple, orange peel, and more hops. A little bit of pine and yeast make themselves present in the smooth finish. No noticeable alcohol in this one, and plenty of prickly carbonation. Awsome medium to full bodied mouthfeel here. Just thick enough to coat the palate nicely. Great drinkability. Hands down my favorite IPA."
"Cheers to seaoflament, one hell of a trader, for this bottle."
"A fantastic beer that may have solidified a spot on my top 5 DIPA's. Once I received this growler I was considering taking this off my wants list, but I would love to have this again in bottle form or any form really. A pleasant DIPA. My only problem was that I so willingly shared this with two other beer lovers. They owe me and I owe Deuane"
"I'm bumping the smell and taste up from a 4.5 each to a 5 each. I love this beer."
"D: Limited bitterness helps the drinkability a bunch. Great brew. Wish I had more."
"This beer is perfect. What more can i say? Way to go Alpine!"
"Wow, this is a really delicious beer. Amazingly, I think it could actually be hoppier. There's no dating on the bottle, so I can't say how old it is, but I really hope I had this as fresh as I could. Even still, if you're in southern California, make sure you get some Pure Hoppiness. You'll be glad you did."
"Drinkability - This beer is awesome. A shining example of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. This is easily one of the best DIPAs I have ever had. Tasty, smells delicious, and easy drinking...what else do you need?"
"The taste has huge notes of grapefruit up front..maybe the most I've tasted, initially, in any DIPA. I can *just* taste some malt in the background but it doesn't come to anywhere near the forefront during the entire session. This sample of the style is all about the hops. And what a nice hop character it has. Lots of grapefruit, some floral, some grass, some spice...still, it's mostly the grapefruit. A darn good sample of a hoppy DIPA and yes..I *do* love examples of the style where the malt shares the thrown with the hops. Sometimes, you look for that malt-hop balance in a DIPA and sometimes you don't. When they are done right, I can appreciate both and this one fits the bill. The 8%abv is very well hidden. My first sample from the Alpine Brewery and I'd dare say, not my last. Well done!"
"Drinkability- This is one of those beers that you start drinking and before you know it, you got a buzz and the beers disappeared. This is probably the first DIPA that Ive had that Im glad its not balanced. Im not a huge hop head (although I do enjoy a great DIPA every-so-often) but this one is different. The balance and types of whatever hops they used are just magnificent. This is a great beer and huge thanks to BeerTruth."
"Now I have waited forever to try this one, well it seemed like forever anyway. It had been sitting in the fridge awaiting me to call on it, and call I did. This poured a very bright and very hazy amber with a large sticky head of lace on top. Great retention never really let it fade, but rather just slowly sick down into a nice layer across the top. Deep smell of very sweet orange floral bouquet. Had a bit of a musty kind of odor in the back could not really place it, but it was still very hoppy, just a lot more balanced then I thought it would be. The flavor was sort of light with a very nice creamy consistency to it. Again somewhat musty bread like flavor was underlying the deep floral hoppy smells. A very nice flavor mix actually and kept it from being one of the excruciatingly bitter hop profiles you have actually come to expect from them. The full flavor itself was quite unique and unlike anything I had tried before, but that in of itself was a very good thing. Very drinkable as the 8% abv was not even noticeable for me. Overall I was very impressed with the depth on this one. I had expected it to be rather similar to the other big west coast IPAs but was very surprised when it showed up to the table packing a different kind of punch, one with more depth and flow to it and something that was more in tune with itself, rather then just loaded down with as much cascade as possible. This is something you should definitely try, and honestly in a class of its own, a very nice beer."
"|Personal score- 93/100"
"Poured from Tap at the Local before the 94.9 fm Ann concert. Poured into pint glass a copper orange color with a small head. Smell of pine and citrus with a hint of malt aroma. Taste was very well balanced with pine hoppiness and grapefruit citrus being very mild the malt body help round out the beer, however for the style this beer is not as extreme as other DIPA i have tried just more balanced. The alcohol was well hidden making the beer very drinkable. Would like to try this beer again but this time from a bottle."
"The drinkability is extremely easy. This bomber went down real quick. A real treat. Highly recommended."
"One last shout out to BeerTruth...Thanks Bro! You are what this website is all about."
"As I said above, this is a great beer and MUST be tried if you get the chance. I am now treasuring the bottle sitting on my shelf at home."
"Overall a phenomenally hoptastic IPA."
"All the guys in the Alesmith line were right about this brew, great local brew out of SD"
"This one is in my personal top 5 easy!"
"Pours a clear and golden orange with big creamy head with that retains nicely and laces some nice sheets. Smells of huge, fresh cut hops, grassy, piney, and actually a little spice from those hops. Taste is a delight. Fresh, multiple variety hops blast the buds followed by a hit of citrus rind and a nice malty finish that balances things out as if it were a perfect ying and yang. Medium in the mouth, no lingering bitterness. Drinkability is off the charts. I would call this an IPA of perfection, huge hops but the finish and drinkability is not a DIPA. A must try."
"Pours a slightly reddish, golden color with a finger, or less, of fluffy white foam. I was a little disappointed at the lack of head on this one, after drinking YuleSmith yesterday this one was a bit mute on the look. Aroma is a nice range of citrus fruits, apple, sweet cherry and sticky, sweet malt. Some pine notes are also hidden in the back of the dominant citrus hops. The taste is surprisingly balanced. It is a well crafted DIPA but it didnt wow me. The name Pure Hoppiness I was imagining a bitter bliss, but I didnt get that with this beer because it has a very adequate amount of malt to tame this beer from being bitterer than it is. The mouthfeel is fairly silky and smooth without feeling like a big/heavy beer, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Still, this is a great DIPA that deserves the good reputation it has."
"Pours a nice slightly cloudy golden orange/yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger plus creamy off-white head, tons of sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is hoppy, nice touch of malt, citrus, some pines, and a good dose of caramel. The taste is nice and hoppy, a touch of malts, good dose of citrus/pines/caramel. The finish is slightly bitter and dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, an excellent DIPA, and my first from this brewery."
"Pours a pretty clear copper hue with a wonderful two finger head that takes a good while to die down. Stickiness holds on to the glass all over, I may be scrubbing the sides to clean this one. Smell is a sweet, hypnotizing citrus (mostly grapefruit) with a tiny hint of caramel in the nose. Taste is one of a kind. Creamy, buttery, pine hop flavor...this is a flavor I find difficult to describe. Aftertaste is a spicey, dry hop flavor with a sweet orange tingle. Mouthfeel is perfect, fairly light bodied with the right amount of carbonation. For a DIPA, this baby goes down so smooth. Probably one of the most drinkable DIPA's I've had to date, pick up this treat for sure."
"Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"22 oz. Bottle. The pour is a clear orange with a white head and lacing. Nice pine cone nose with some malt. Very piny and citrus in the flavor with a nice light malt background. Not overly bitter but still has a nice lingering bitterness in the finish. I can thank my friend Doug for this one!"
"Overall, this was a smooth and tasty double IPA, albeit somewhat less extreme than many others in its category."
"D: 5's are pretty rare for me, but it's also rare I find a DIPA with so much flavor that is also so drinkable. Often flavors and hops get so overwhelming, I want to quit a bomber about halfway through. Not this one...terrific flavors, aroma and mouthfeel make this a new favorite. Deserving the reputation and highly recommended!"
"Pours clear golden amber with finger thick foamy head that leaves lace all the way up the glass. The head thins slowly, remaining foamy and 1/4""" thick. Strong floral to piney hop smell with a hint of grapefruit. Crisp, bitter and very hoppy initial flavor with a hint of grapefruit. The malt base is good but doesn't quite balance with the strong hops. Nice moderately bitter aftertaste that is medium to long lived and very pleasant. Medium to full bodied mouthfeel that remains crisp and alcholic. Try pairing it with rosemary encrusted lamb chops. I would definitely purchase this again, and I have been very lucky to have a couple of friends travling to San Diego, bringing me back some of this fine ale. I can only dream that they will increase their distribution."
"It poured a nice golden yellow, but lacked decent head and lacing. Both are things I expect from a double ipa. The aroma was very complex and completely loaded with hops. I've just started home brewing, so I can sometimes pick out what type of hops are being used by the smell, but with this, they intermingled and fed off eachother to create an almost supernatural aroma. The taste was like the smell, but was complemented nicely by the sublte malt back-bone. They really let the hops take over making my face pucker and distort in joy. It was also extremely easy to go through a bomber in a sitting. I like this beer."
"Damn, this is an amazing beer. DIPA's are my favorite style, and I've tried most of em out there. I have to say Pure Hoppiness is one of the best Double IPA's I've had. Of course Pliny the Elder is my #1, but I'm always searching for something similar...or possibly better. So far this is my #2. If you like Pliny, you'll love this beer!"
"Great body, appropriate carbonation. So easy to drink, no way this is 8%. A very solid brew. Seemed to be a bit more in line with a standard IPA, but who cares."
"Mouth is medium, hoppy and nice. Not perfect but nice. An IPA I would like to drink daily."
"Incredibly drinkable for the kick in the head I know it is. Not sure if I prefer this or the Exponential. I believe Expo is a bit sweeter and I know it is a good bit hotter. Whatever! Just glad I have 2 more bombers of this to work through."
"Cheers."
"Drinkability is good. It's an excellent DIPA. A notch below the best, but still well done and quite tasty."
"Thanks to Metallitone1 for this one! This has a very nice and clear golden color but the bubbles were a little large and the head and lacing could have been better. The piny, resiny hoppy aroma is very inviting. It reminds me a lot of Centennial hops and I love Centenntial. The flavor was very hoppy with a piny, resinous flavor and none of the fruity grapefruit flavors. There is little alcohol or other fermentation characteristics. There is a slight sweetness but the beer is rather dry and allows the hops to shine. The dryness made the mouthfeel a little less than great. Overall, though, this is a very tasty San Diego Pale that I would try again."
"Cheers!"
"I paired this one with a super spicy vegan sausage with peppers and onions. Mmm mmm good."
"Fresh growler straight from the brewery. An old favorite of mine from my San Diego days, Pure Hoppiness pours the color of a copper penny with a foamy white head that dissipates and thins quickly. The first whiff is classic San Diego IPA style - big piney hops with danky floral notes. Taste is smooth and clean with lots of grapefruit and pine punching your tongue around. Theres a nice caramel malt in the background to help balance things out a little and make it very drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth, clean and lightly resinous finish. Overall, one of the more sessionable IIPAs Ive had the pleasure of drinking. I used to drink a lot of this and only wish i had easier access to this gem nowadays. Theres a reason its one of the IIPAs that made SD famous."
"Thanks to metallitone1 for sending this tasty DIPA my way. Poured from a 22oz. bomber bottle into my Russian River shaker """pint""" glass. Appears a slightly hazy golden copper color with about two fingers of off-white head. The foam leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. Smells of sweet citrus (orange), caramel malt, tropical fruit such as pineapple and mango, and piney hops. Tastes of sweet tangerine, bitter grapefruit, piney hops and a nice caramel malt back. Slightly thin in the mouth with medium carbonation. I would certainly drink this fine beer again, but if given a choice, I'd pick the Elder which is more accessible here in PA."
"flavor doesn't quite have the same complexity, with a slight hoppiness in the start complemented with a stronger hoppiness in the finish. prickly carbonation and a medium feel; somewhat one-noted, with just a medium-high bitterness and some floral and pine notes. very pretty beer, with a great aroma, but it's slightly downhill from there."
"D- I think it is a very good brew. I think I will be drinking my other bottles of this instead of trading it. Shame these aren't easier to get."
"Great DIPA and deserving of the praise it gets. Not on the level of Dreadnaught for me, but very good nonetheless. DIPA lovers need to seek out a bottle of this - and metallitone is a good source."
"a nice dipa but not one of the revolutionary ones of the universe."
"Clear copper. Bubbly ivory white head. Lace is pretty intricate and moderate in amount. Great hop aroma. Like burying your nose in a big pile of PacNW hops. Pungent. Grapefruit. Pineapple. And Bong Resin. This DIPA brings a lot of great hop flavor without an abrasive bitterness. AND without a lot of EtOH heat. I like that. I'd rather my DIPAs be in the range of 8% instead of 10ish. Lemony hop oils meld with tropical pineapple and grapefruit. Resinous and a little greasy. Good stuff. Malts are in the background, but give sufficient backbone to this DIPA without contributing a lot of sweetness. Body is medium to medium-full and the beer is lightly carbonated. Very good DIPA."
"D: The 8% is well-hidden. The hops are big (not big enough as I noted above), but they go down easy."
"Notes: Special thanks to KingG for the sample"
"D: Super tasty, goes down very easily, nice kick to it, only slightly filling, excellent representation of style, Im happy I started drinking this late in the night because its the type of beer that is extremely difficult to follow. I think this is an excellent beer."
"To have a draught pint would be heavenly."
"Pours a medium gold in color and clear with a small white head. Nice citrusy hop aroma, grapefruit and pineapple, a sweet tropical fruitiness. Nice grapefruit citrus hoppiness up front in the taste followed by a some pine and grassy bitterness and a nice peppery bite. Fairly dry with a hint of alcohol in the finish. A nice creamy medium body in the background works well to balance but not overpower. A very nice example of the style, nothing was to over the top but everything was very nicely balanced, good hop aroma and nice peppery bite, solid."
"Orange/gold color, slight lacy head. Best enjoyed on draft. I had 5! It's that drinkable."
"A very good IPA, I say IPA instead of Double IPA because even though it is labled as a double IPA I think it is actually closer to the stregnth and flavor of an excellent American IPA. Nice use of hops, somewhat grassy with citrus notes. Color is a rich gold color. Very drinkable. I just wish it was available where I live."
"Pours a very brilliant, glowing orannge color. Very clear with a one and a half inch thick, bright, white, frothy head. Excellent head retention, and tons of sticky lacing, clinging to the glass. Very inviting looking. Strong smelling double IPA. Huge grapefruit aromas, followed by some citrusy, piney smells, maybe a hint of lemon and grass. Nice big dry hopped flavors up front, with a very prevalent caramel malt backbone. Very easy too drink for a double IPA. Finishes bitter, but not over the top. Incredibly well balanced. Lots of carbonation make this a very smooth brew, medium bodied. I wouldn't have a clue that this is 8% abv, alcohol is hidden magnificently. Overall, a excellent beer, a must try for any hophead!"
"Originally reviewed on September 14, 2006. 22 oz Bottle. Lucious sweet liquor of hops, licking my nose with Centennial piney resins. Full of swaying fresh grasses and grapefruit trees. Pour of an amber tinged pure gold, crowned with a rocky froth of off-white. Flavor is a delicious lightly creamy malt body, heavy with droopy eyelids of fresh white pine needles and a bough of aspen leaves. Dryly smacking of grass resin and freshly squeezed Valencia oranges. A drop of lemon juice and vodka sneak in. Mmmm hops. An well built IPA with great balance and body. I love the long draw of hoppy apple peels."
"D: Damn drinkable. Slightly carbonated for my tastes and I'd like to try it on draft--not a knock. Bigger hop notes in the aroma but with a good balance in the flavors. Highly drinkable and one that I'd have any day."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, medium bodied, smooth, sugary, with vanilla running along the near perfect palate. Very nice!"
"With so many amazing DIPAs coming out of San Diego, it's no wonder this city (area) continues to define the style that was essentially pioneered there. Many are starting to call double IPAs """San Diego Pale Ale.""" They've earned it."
"Mouthfeel is medium. Fair amount of carbonation makes for a nice crispness. Decent drinkability, the slightly unbalanced nature brings this down. If you want straight up hops this is a good choice. Good brew overall...similar to Victory's Hop Wallop to me..."
"Really fun to drink; extremely enjoyable."
"D- smell is just as strong as the taste, great for a hop fix. Fun to try, but i wouldnt go out of my way for another. I would take one if i was in my way though. Best to enjoy over a extended amount of time."
"Light copper appearance with high clarity. Frothy light foam begins at 1/2 inch, settles some leaving a nice crust and minor lace. Intense piney hop aroma, nectary and floral, with a hint of spiciness and also mild citrus notes. The taste has a strong dry-hopped flavor and a light nutty maltiness with the slightest hint of roast. The bitterness creeps in slowly after a few sips and really builds toward a sharp cheddar-like bite. I am really impressed with the freshness of the hops. Alcohol is not real noticible here. Mouthfeel is solid, medium body, moderate carbonation, very-clean like finish, not sticky. I loved this beer, even more than anticipated. The hops were fantastic, and I think they managed to make a big double without overdoing it too much. Excellent..."
"Creamy texture, but not too heavy, very drinkable, this is a beer in a class by itself."
"Taste wise there is some good maltiness upfront before the hops just take over completely. It has a very pure clean taste to it. The mouthfeel is a little on the sticky side and the carbonation could be a little more pronounced. Overall, a very smooth and drinkable IPA--the extra alcohol is quite well hidden."
":banned:"
"D - One of the most drinkable double IPAs I have ever sampled. Many thanks to westsidethreat. I love you man. :sniff: This shit is awesome. Reminds me of all the DIPAs that I enjoy more than sex. Dreadnaught, Goose Island, Pliney. Easily up there with all of them. Great stuff."
"I can not believe how easilly this 22oz went down."
"Thanks Lou91 for this gem. Powerful, bold and complex hop aroma,reminds me of the first time I inhaled Dreadnaught, you could keep your nose in that glass all day, wonderful fullbodied malt hop combination like you bit into a sweetened grapefruit/orange with a beautiful tongue coating bitterness that urged you to contemplate the artist skills of the brewmaster. Amongst my top 5 IIPA's"
"Decent body with the alcohol burried under the hoppiness, this stuff goes down easier than water (especially SD tap-water). Highly recommend, especially to mega-hopheads...heres to you!"
"Drinkability: A very nice, well-structured IPA"
"Notes: Very, very nice! I don't consider myself a hophead, but I could go back to this beer again and again. Thanks xlperro for this offering. I owe you!"
"The epitome of what a Double IPA should be. This is my go to DIPA whenever I am in San Diego. The scent is pure hops, very piney, a little citrusy. Taste is also piney, hops hops hops, but man what a balanced beer this is! I can drink this all day long, easily one of the smoothest brews I have ever had. This is what I compare every DIPA I taste to, and I wish I could get it more often up here in LA. Fortunately, I head down to SD on a weekly basis, and enjoy this frequently at O'Brien's and the Liar's Club. I preach the gospel of this brew to every hophead I meet, and dub this a """must try""" if it ever crosses your path."
"Drinkability: I could drink this all day. Lovely nectar it is. One of the better IPAs I've had in a while. Outstanding indeed."
"The beer arrived and was a crystal clear toasted golden elixir. Topped with a nice bone colored head of fine bubbles that left an awesome amount of lacing. The smell is rather modest, light in the hop area with only hints of pine, there is something also slightly sweet as well. Perhaps the aroma of Sweet-tarts candy. The taste is a hops explosion and yet that sweetness is still there, hanging around. Pronounced piney hop bite in the finish. This is also slightly drying at the same time. Medium bodied, and medium carbonation with a nice full mouthfeel. Worth tracking down."
"Last swigs: Thanks to fellow BA NeroFiddled for the generous bottle. In case you can't get your hands on this hoppy dish, it reminds me a bit of Hop Wallop."
"I'm so excited to taste this beer. I smelled the cap after opening this and it was bursting with succulent hop, brilliant and drawing me in. I am pumped. It pours a solid golden color with a finger of head that falls to a sparse coating over top. Right where I want the color. Nose is so sweet and citrusy. The combination between the sweet hop and the caramel malt sweetness really comes across as spun sugary goodness. Flavor hits me with a tease of bitterness before swallowing. This is followed immediately by incredible sweet grapefruity American hop and caramel malt. It finishes nice and sweet with a moderate bitterness that hangs on just enough to balance. Feel is right between moderate and thick with a light-moderate carbonation. Very nice. Absolutely no hint of the 8% in this beer. Flavor really has balance. This beer is in harmony with itself. Its not something to gulp, but also not something that keeps you from enjoying it at a nice clip. I am a fan. Good call Lou."
"I need to find a vendor where I can load up on some of these bottles or make a trip to the brewery myself."
"A solid first for me from Alpine and worth seeking out."
"The nose was so good that my mouth watered sniffing the cap. A hoplovers air freshener. Big beautiful grapefruit and caramel nose. Bright white head. I was craving a big rich IPA and this delivered. All the qualities you look for  complex and dominant hops, long hop bitterness in the aftertaste, and a thoroughly satisfying crisp clean drinkability. The body was a couple of notches above a normal IPA but not quite a douple IPA. This is more like a 1.5x IPA vs. a double.Although you can drink this all day, I took my time over an hour drinking the 22oz and it was great to sip a little at a time. Ah, hops are good. A rare find at Ledger's."
"Drinkability- Very nice DIPA. Glad I snagged a few while I could."
"Cheers!"
"This beer pours a nice golden yellow color with an off white head. The head is fluffy. It fades quickle leaving a lot of laces. This beer smells very hoppy. It smells piney. It has a slight citrus aroma also. I cant detect much malt aroma. The alcohol is hard to detect also, but it is there if you look. This beer tastes hoppy. Very hoppy. It has a piney, earthy taste to it. It has a slightly citrusy taste also. I can not detect much in the way of malt flavor. This beer is mainly just bitter. It is very refreshing. It is a full bodied, aggressive beer, but I think that it is very enjoyable. It leaves a piney aftertaste. This beer has just the right amount of carbonation. This beer might not be the best session beer if you are not fond of the style. The aggressive flavor might wear a little thin on some drinkers. This beer is a very good Double IPA. It is well worth any effort you might have to take to get it."
"Pine dominates the inhale and entry is smooth with an initial hop-bite quickly brushed back by a sturdy backbone of quality malt. Mouthfeel is near perfect and the finish is clean with a BAHB (Big ass hop bite) followed by a beautiful fade from one of my new found hop bombs."
"Drinkability and Notes  A lighter malt presence than most means that this is a very drinkable beer. Its a solid DIPA, but it doesnt have the malt profile to make it standout from the pack. Great hops, and if thats all you look for in an IPA, this one is for you."
"Poured a dark golden color with a medium sized, white head that left nice sticky lacing on the glass. Resiny, piney, green and citrus hop aroma. Taste is very bright, limes, lemons, citrus grapefruit. Light malts to balance it all out. Decent, but I would reach for the Expo Hoppiness first, if I had the chance."
"This one is what it says it is, though well made in the genre and fairly well balanced in the hopheads domain. It first appears orange-amber and very clear. Its head is sticky and white. Interesting oily C-hops aroma well mellowed by a tea bag reminiscent herbal maltiness. Generous earthiness and more of this tea goodness keep up on the tongue and come close to offering a match to the slick oily hops, tongue-slicingly bitter, flowery and grapefruity. Thin and refreshing mouthfeel, surprisingly light carbonation feels somehow too much with the oiliness of the hops used. Thanks Eyechartbrew, very clean brew."
"On tap at Liar's Club in Mission Beach. First pint out of the keg. Poured with a thick white head that stayed throughout the glass. Left thick lacing. Bright golden color. Smells of citrus hops (grapefruit). Taset is incredibly balanced, but dominated by hops. Very very drinkable. All in all a great double IPA - find it if you can!"
"Overall, it was definitely a drinkable brew. Probably not a beer I would seek out, but something that I could enjoy on any given night."
"Drinkability is very solid. Alpine obviously makes great beer and looking forward to a few more from this newly found brewery."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 3/4""" of off-white head over the golden brew. Frothy head exhibits some staying power, and lacing is foamy and plentiful. Aroma is all about the piney hops, with perhaps a dash of citrus, all shimmed up with ample malt character. Taste is as well all about piney hops, with smooth malts sliding in somewhat under that radar. Mouthfeel is great for the style, not too overboard, and drinkability is good as well. Another delectible Alpine offering, I'll have to keep an eye out for others..."
"Light gold with a nice frothy head of white foam. Lacing ensues and is quite nice as well. Aromas are of fresh hops, grass, citrus fruits, light bready malts, and more. Taste is lightly carbonated hoppy, fresh, herbal, grassy, and citric. Grapefruit flavors also make an appearance, as does various pine hints, sappy tree-like flavors and more. Awesome medium-bodied mouthfeel and a stellar drinkability. A very hoppy offering that is quite balanced as well. Another CA state gem of a brew. Cheers."
"This is damn good. Fellow BA Xlperro gave us a bottle this past friday, and really, it wasn't like I wanted this one to sit around. I shared the bomber with David of course, and we each got plenty of good beer. Color when poured was tangerine, very slight haze. Since I controlled the pour, we each got a lovely 1/2 inch of thick chewy foam. I am about 2/3's done, and still am rewarded with faint lace throughout the glass. There's a lot going on with the aroma...initial whiffs reveal some grassy hops, also some woody ones. A deeper whiff reveals frankly what one gets when they stick their nose in a bag of fresh hops...very nice. Tastewise, one is rewarded with solid medium mouthfeel, low carbonation, and hops upon hops. The hops have a bit of bitterness in the finish, but I find the beer pretty balanced (there's malt in there somewhere). I have to give this beer high marks for drinkability, because not only would I like another, I can't tell this beer is 8% at all...thanks!"
"*I know know it's Cascade, Columbus, and H-something--whoops, I lost..."
"Thanks to XLPerro for bringing it up North. A hophead experience, over-the-top of IPA with the seven different hops. Definite hop bite not for everyone. Grapefruit aroma and taste there, very dry after. Very aromatic hops. Grassy, leafy, piney thick mouthfeel. A bit of fruit and carmel mid-sip. Moderate carbonation. The salad to my meat dish."
"What else can I possibly say? Pure Hoppiness is pure deliciousness. I'm heartened by the fact that I have one more bottle, but depressed that I don't have easy access to this mother's milk of a beer. Alpine's PH is yet another reason to curse the two most vile words in a BA's vocabulary: limited distribution."
"Overall: This hop juice is amazing. This has bitterness, but if you can take the bitterness of any APA, you can dig this beer."
"This is one beer I have wanted to try for a long time. Now that I got a hold of 3 bottles I couldnt wait to crack it open. This poured out a hazy golden orange body with a tall off white head. As this was consumed sheets of lacing were left decorating the sides of the glass. The aroma was filled with citric hops as well as floral ones, this is one of the most hoppy aromas I have had the pleasure of smelling. Also noted in the scent was piney smells but not much malt was detectable at all. With the first sip you know you are in for an all out hop assault citric hops jump on your tongue, grab hold and dont let go. Notes of pine and slightly sweet malt are present but take a back seat here. The after taste is bitter and dry leaving your mouth caked in a hoppy bitterness. Everything done with the hops is done big, but not to the point of excess. Mouthfeel is creamy and about medium. This goes down pretty easily considering the huge hoppiness of it. I was not disappointed at all with this, except that it is not readily available near me."
"Don't let the hops fool you either, this beer has a solid malt backbone, which allows the hops to take center stage in a full mouth-pleasing manner. The malt peeks out up front and also appears in the finish with a biscuit like note. Quite enjoyable! I like that this IPA is much more focused on the hop aroma and flavor than the bitterness."
"The beer after disemboguing from the 22 ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a luminous golden amber color, the head a majestic white crown upon the body, the texture creamy, and the lace a satin sheet to lie upon the glass. The aroma of hops is what this beer is about, sweet and inviting, fresh, crisp, a treat for all the senses. Start is ambrosial, the malt profile perfect, the top middling in its feel to the palate, finish has a delightful acidity, the hops perfection, the aftertaste desert bone dry and long lasting, what a magnificent beer, my ever lasting gratitude to the fine people at Alpine for this elixir of life."
"Pours a clear, rather darkish gold, lightly carbonated and with a moderate white head. Hop aroma is lovely -- sharp and piney with a big citric acidity. A mild alcohol aroma comes through as the beer warms. The flavor is dripping with sappy, spurcey hop bitterness. Sweetness is held to a minimum, despite the relatively low carbonation. The malt contributes a nice toasty background to the hop headliner, but yields in the end to a delicate, flowery hop finale. Alcohol warmth is present but mild. A delightful beer from the bottle, and pure heaven on tap."
"Even better off the tap. The pour and the color were the same as the bottle version. The smell was a bit more pronounced with a little smoother hop scent than the bottle but just as good. The flavor and the mouthfeel were much better on tap. The malty middle came out much more and balanced the beer just enough to make it near-perfect, and the mouthfeel was much more creamy and easy going. A great beer indeed."
"A big Ol' west coast love touch goes to xlperro for this mad bitch of a hop brew! Fuckin' Yum my man!"
"This offering from Alpine does credit to the West Coast IPA/imperial IPA style. The hops certainly pack a punch but the alcohol content is cleverly concealed. I can't wait to finally get to try it's sibling, Exponential Hoppiness."
"This double IPA poured a clear, amber color with white foam. The smell was a strong and persistent fruity-chewy hop aroma with some malt backing it up. The taste was naturally dominated by the chewy, resinous hops, but the hops were not really over the top and were nicely balanced with the malt. The mouthfeel was smooth and slightly sweet with a medium-full body and moderate carbonation. The dry, hoppy flavor lingered on the tongue pleasantly. This was a very nice beer, and I wish I could have another."
"The king recommends drinking this beer with a hot pastrami sandwich (with extra pickles)"
"Tried it at OBriens in San Diego where it was the hit of the evening for most people. Some people suggested it smelled like """bud""" and I do not mean the beer."
"It tastes of smooth but bold northwest hops, but there is no unbridled bitterness because the malt taste comes through to uphold an unparalleled consistency. Each sip is liquid gold, to match the color of this perfected brew."
"The light amber body has an off-white head that laces with great gusto. The nose is very complex providing a parade of nice hop notes, whilst the malt base is shy andd retiring in this blend. The flavor is light citrus with some spicy fruitiness. Lovely feel with nice finish. Very drinkable ale."
"Man, this is one hopped-up beer! Gotta love its overall rawness that smacks the shite out of you, but you enjoy it and come back for more. Hell yeah!"
"Medium brown color. Small head. Aromas are very nice floral hops. Medium bodied IPA. A hop fest in a glass. The malts are really overpowered by the hops in this beer. The hops are floral, grapefruity, spicy, piney and bitter; take your choice cause they are all here in this beer. As the name implies it a hop bomb and very bitter, yet it still manages to have some smoothness to it. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and smooth. Aftertaste is bitter."
"Drinkability  If it wasnt for my demanding, share-all-the-good-hoppy-beer-with-me wife, I could chug this all night. This is a masterpiece."
"Notes: What can I say, this is all I expected from a west coast IPA and a little bit more. Its nice to get a kick in the mouth with a big hoppy brew."
"Wow that is a damn good IPA that BA xlperro turned me on to. The golden orange color belies the strength lurking within. Off-white frothy head sits high atop, throwing off strong, but sweet aromas of hops, flowers, pine, and citrus. The hop flavor wallops the tongue, and leaves a tingly pine flavor, with bits of orange peel, then rolls butterscotch over the sides. Grassy hop bitter lingers in the back of the mouth. Thin white lace dots the inside of the glass. This is a great beer. Now how do I get some more?"
"Rerated when sampled from a bottle. A far better hop experience in a bottle. It's amber clored with a whitish head. This has a nice flavor and is a must try for hop heads. Too bad that this is hard to come by, even in southern californa."
"22 oz. bottle, pours a hazy golden-copper color, minimal carbonation, has a small off-white head that does cling to the glass. Good strong hoppy candy grapefruit aroma, nice hoppy resiny grapefruit flavor, has a good malt balance, medium bodied, finishes bitter and sticky, a great one for pure hopheads like me, delicious, thanks go out to fellow beergeek herbjones for this west coast hop juice."
"This ale pours a crystal clear gold-that-borders-on-amber body. The rocky white head holds quite well and leaves some very nice lace about the glass. The nose is outrageous with rich, resiny, piney, fruity and citrusy hops! It's most impressive and very welcoming! The body is medium, and it's smooth across the palate due to a very fine and moderate-level carbonation. Although the nose is astounding, more hops come out in the flavor, over a biscuity and caramel-laced malt. It's got a solid bitterness to it, but it's really well-balanced and finishes dry with just enough bitterness to cleanse the palate. An all-around great beer... the hop aroma is brilliant; the hop flavors come through clearly; the malt base is not overdone (and works as the perfect platform to show off the hops); and the bitterness level is perfectly balanced to accentuate the beer and keep you coming back for more. Well worth seeking out!"
"Medium body with dead on carbonation make for a solid IPA. I'll be tasting this one after it is long gone. Thanks xlperro for this taste of the west coast. Cheers!"
"I bet he just hates living in San Diego"
"Nice looking beer. Great head that's almost too happy to be alive. You have to pour this one carefully. It's a slightly sandy head but very sticky. The first glass laced, the second glass left thick patches of foam stuck to the sides of the glass. I may need a scouring pad to clean the glass. The body is solid amber. It looks a little thin though. I don't mean pale, I've seen paler IPAs (Sweetwater IPA is more yellow and less red), just thin. The aroma is heavenly. Big fruity hops, a bit of sweetness, a very aromatic beer. The flavor is where things drop off. The rich hop profile thins out to mostly just a bitterness. It would have been nice if the juiciness had carried through from the aroma, but it didn't. The malt is seriously lacking. I got a glimpse at a nice caramel and biscuits malt at the first sip but then it was lost under the hops. It's not that the hops are really overpowering, it's just the malt backbone isn't there to hold it up. It makes the beer a bit thin. This is also a really dry beer. It's one thing in a lager like a pils to be dry, but I actually prefer my pale ales to be less dry. A little sweetness really helps to balance the hops and give a little character. If the flavor was as good as the appearance and aroma this would be an incredible beer. Still not bad though."
