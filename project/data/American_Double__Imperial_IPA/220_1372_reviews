"Very hopped up beer.  You get the hop aromas right off the pour.  The smell is amazing.  The taste is nice and strong you can pick up that 8.2% ABV.  The hops in this beer are nice and citrusy and give a lot of pine notes.  I liked the beer a lot and would suggest trying it."
"This is a really solid IPA, very drinkable.  The flavor has a little twist that makes it different from others.  Just a solid brew."

""
""
""
""
"When it's fresh, right from the brewery, nothing is better."

"Good beer. Great amber color. Easy drinker."
""
"This is my go to daily drinker. If I was stuck on a desert island I'd want Maximus for the summers and Old Rasputin for the winter. Super yummy!"
""
""
"Great taste and feel for an ipa."

"Pours a beautiful amber hue with frothy two finger head that holds nicely. Hop explosion that you expect from a 2X IPA. Grapefruit, pine and somewhat nutty taste. Nice earthy malt balance and very smooth mouthfeel. Lagunitas never disappoints."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very hoppy and smooth. A palate wrecker of hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Typical Lagunitas hop explosion.    Could use more maltiness to balance this out.  Good for the price and availability though."
""
""
""
""
"An amber colored tint to it.  Less than a finger head.  Smell gives off a little pine, lemon, and grapefruit.  Taste wise you get some grapefruit and a hint of lemon.  Feels great.  Overall a great beer.  Lagunitas is hard to not like."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Deep golden color. Big pine and resin. Rich caramel maltiness. Nice brew."
""
""
""
""
"Definitely one of my favorites"
"This was pretty delicious. Not the best of the best, but a very drinkable DIPA and would happily drink again."
""
""
""
""
"Amber like with a creamy foamy head.oh man.goes down smooth..Prost"
""
"Its pretty good beer try it"
""
""
"Pours a dark amber almost brown with an off white head that trails the glass. The smell was full of grapefruit from the hops, but also a lot of earthy nutty notes from the malt. The taste was surprising with a nice malt backbone up front with a lot of bread flavors slowly coming into the grapefruit and pine from the hops. Was very happy with the amount of balance this beer has given some very intense flavors."
""
"Stronger malt character with a nice hop balance.  Nice!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The body is medium, plenty of heft to it, and there's a good balance on the palate of both crispness and smoothness.  It may lost just a touch, and a little something develops slightly underneath to scrape a bit, but it works well."

"Very good for the price. Another great brew from lagunitas."
"Copper pour with two fingers of fluffy white head. Great looking. Aromas of pine and grapefruit, with some malty hints of biscuit and bread. Flavors translate from aromas, with a very smooth semi-sweet mouthfeel. Good stuff as always from Lagunitas!"
"O: Overall this wasn't outstanding, but it was a solid double IPA. Not as huge as I would expect for a beer of this style, but it was good. It has good balance and is very crisp and refreshing. Personally I liked this a lot more then Hop Stoopid from Lagunitas. I would drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A very tasty ipa without the strong lingering happiness. Defiantly up there in my list!"
""
""
""

""
"While not nearly as awesome as Lagunitas Sucks, this is still a solid IIPA."
""

"I like it, so it must be good!!"

"Mellow for a dbl. I was def expecting more."

"This IPA is sublimely wonderful. Not overly bright and flowery, nor bitter, it is smooth and rich and buttery- somewhat akin to Dogfish 90 min IPA. No lingering bitterness on the tounge it finishes cleanly."
""
"Overall: If I were rating this as a beer judge, I would have to dock points for the lack of bitterness and the thickness of the mouthfeel, since both are qualities not typically desirable in an Imperial IPA. But as a simple consumer and beer lover, I am quite enamored by the impeccable balance this beer achieves while still exhibiting great complexity. It is perhaps a little too similar to the rest of the Lagunitas canon, especially for a limited release, but it is one of those beers I would look forward to regardless of my mood, my craving, the season, etc."
""
""
""
""
""
"Way, way underrated on this site.  I usually trust The Bros, but they're off on this one.  Malty, hoppy, balanced, aromatic, none of the dreaded and unpalatable Simcoe hop - this is the real deal of an IIPA.  And it comes in 6-packs at a reasonable price.  On my rating scale, Stone RuinTen is a perfect 100; DFH 90-Minute a 97.  I'll give Maximus a 94.  One of the best values in the IIPA genre!"
""
""
""
""
"Would purchase and drink again if available. Probably won't seek out though, many other great ones I would want to grab first."
""
"citrus scent and taste, easy bitter end"
""
"My absolute favorite. Everything about this beer is right on."
""

"Overall, it's decent. I like to grab some when I feel like changing things up."

"Very good, nice head IPA"
""
"Color nothing extraordinary...Smell is phenomenal piney-hop blast, overall feel is not special but the taste is one of the better in terms of what i like in an IPA (initial tongue better than aftertaste in terms of strength of flavor)"
""
""
"really great hoppy notes, very flavorful"
"Love this beer and the name."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a orangish amber into a IPA glass from SA with a beautiful frothy off white head that left a nice lacy trail. Aroma was excellent with citrus piney scent with a bit of grassy smell and a touch of carmel. Taste was same as the nose, with a wonderful bitterness that lingered a full minute after the taste. Would love to try this straight up fresh!"
""
""
""
"Nice ibu is a powerful hoppy beer. After a few you will definitely be feeling good. Has a lot of bitterness to it but I enjoyed this brew"
"Good beer. Not as good as Sucks but still good."
""
""
""
"Really nice, but coming after Hop Stoopid it seems to lack some stuff (might be a bit old, too). Sweeter, fruitier, lacking that nice stinky dankness."
""
""
""
""
"Good beer. Little sweet but descent double"
""
"AweSome.  Very drinkable. Need more than one"
"This beer is just banging."

"Amazing to me. Lagunitas' widespread availability absolutely causes beer lovers to over look them. I M guilty of it myself. Just had a super fresh Maximus and it's one damn fine brew, and it so happens u can get it anywhere. If this were seasonal or in low supply it would be rated 95."
""
""
""
"Me likey."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer has some individual characteristics that really work well, but overall it was a bit of a disappointment. This seems like Lagunita's answer to the demand for big ipas, which they deliver on at an affordable price tag. Unfortunately, this beer is a little too over the top on the booze and if toned down a bit with the same hop profile, I would have given a higher rating."

"The flavor has a nice malt balance with tangy yeast and hop dominance which brings tangerine and mild honeyed lemon with a slight spiced grapefruit taste. There is a slight grassy hop with astringent aspect and mild sweet malt following. The hop bitterness is not overly aggressive yet there is a slight acidity in the background which adds to the complexity with some grapefruit juiciness and herbal character that counters the malt sweetness as it finishes with a mild alcohol flavor which only detracts slightly . This is a very good Imperial IPA with nice amount of hop flavor although a bit sweet -in general worth trying and highly drinkable for the style-Solid."

"Used an oversized wine glass thanks to the site's suggestion... definitely made a difference from the first time I tried it. Great beer!"
"OVERALL: Quality Full Bodied IPA that some could describe as """Slightly Harsh""" because of the Obvious ABV%. Great Ale if you are planning on having just One or Two."

"Body is a bit over medium while the effervescence is well restrained. A heavy coating of the upper palate occurs. Warming as expected and a touch of dry to the finish."
""
""
"I've read other positive reviews about this and I completely agree. I'm a big fan of Lagunitas and this has to be one of their best. Deliciously hoppy with a wave of citrus and heavy pine notes. The carbonation is perfect. What a wonderful example of a double IPA. I think I'll have another!"

"Bottle poured into straight pint glass.  Pours a clear light gold with a small creamy white head.  Orange and pine aromas billow out.  Behind these are melon and a sharp lemon dishwasher powder essence.  The orange and pine are dominant with a good malt backbone.  Becomes more phenolic with warming.  Hides the alcohol.  Well made double IPA, best cold.  Thanks for the recommendation John."
""
"Note to self:  yes, you really do like this well-priced brew ($9.99/6-pk) more than most of the expensive 4-pk-only double IPA's out there, like Hoptimum, Heelcho Hops, and ."
"Overall: This reminds me of any number of other hoppy Lagunitas brews. It's good, but nothing sets it apart from anything else in their lineup."
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid DIPA from an otherwise solid contributor. The name is a bit overstated as there are DIPA/IIPAs out there with more hop punch to them, but his ranks nicely as a solid DIPA.  Darker apricot color, with an aroma that promises more pine than citrus. Nice piney hop flavor up front with some smooth, but properly understated malt in the middle, with a nice spicy finish. Good stuff."

"delicious!!!!!! VERY VERY VERY excellent example of a double IPA. very hoppy and straight forward. This (thankfully) isn't a malt bomb like Southern Tier Un Earthly or 2xIPA. you can actually taste the hops (unlike southern tier malt bombs) not to hate on southern tier however,  it's just that their beers I mentioned are extremely sweet and malty. This one however is very hoppy and bitter. Just how I like :)  . Extremely smooth. (Just had a whole 6 pack because I couldn't help myself and I rarely do this). It really is that easy and smooth to drink. Thanks Lagunatis,  for making every beer I have drank from you just as delicious as the last one I've tasted. This one some what reminds me of Undercover Investigation Shutdown DIPA, but is a bit more bitter. (In a good way)"
""
"This is what a decent DIPA should taste like.  A very dark amber with a hint of orange.  The smell is dominated by the citrus and pine hops.  The taste again is very """hop forward""" with the malt taste coming in later with the very good finish.  The mouth feel is very rich and the carbonation level is perfect.  My only warning is that this beer gives absolutely no warning of the rather high alcohol percentage and after a couple could sneak up on someone unsuspecting.  Overall this is a great DIPA worth every penny."

"O- Pretty well balanced and drinkable."

"Super spicy. Super Piney. I've come to love and expect a strong piney, hoppy presence in all their beers. This one hits hard. It's big time. A beer some breweries would put into a 4 pack and charge the same price, $9.99. Not Lags, they give ya 6 for 10 and they all pack a punch like you just dove on a hop grenade to save your comrades. Drink it."

"Exactly what you think it will be. Balanced yet bold. Couldn't have more than one."

"Overall:  This was one of the last of Lagunitas' offerings for me to try.  There is a good amount of hop flavor and is well balanced by the malt.  This might one of the best balanced DIPAs for the amount of hop flavor."

"Picked up a 22, poured into a mug. Third Lagunitas review. The color is incredibly inviting, a copperish-amber. Decent amount of head, maybe quarter inch on the poor. Aroma was big on hops, taste not so much. Flavor was more citrus and boozy than hops. Good stuff, but for how much I like Lagunitas, was hoping for better."

"Brilliant amber in color with excellent clarity. A quarter inch of white head is visible. Brussels lacing. A powerful aroma of citrus hops greets my nose. Mango and pineapple notes are distinct. The citrus hops are fairly bitter on the front of the palate. There's plenty of light malt to back it up,but in the fade the hops make their presence known. The mouth is a bit sticky and chalky."

"O: Admittedly I rated this kind of harsh. I've had this beer so many times because for $10 it beats Stone IPA in these parts and let's talk about alcohol content. It's a working man's IPA not the best but at the same time for someone that still appreciates a good double/imperial IPA and doesn't want to throw down $6 a bomber it serves a mighty fine purpose in my monthly rotation. Don't let this review knock you it's just something you shouldn't have to seek out but if it's on the shelf and you haven't tried it yet, it beats most domestic IPAs by a stretch."

"Aroma of stale peaches, something sour, can't quite place it. Sugars as well. Pours a thin gold, little head, no lacing. Taste is medium sweet and bready, a bit of a hot alcohol aftertaste; not unpleasant, not great. Lagunitas makes a lot of great beers and this just isn't one of them -- thin, sweet, oddly sour."

"O- This is the best beer readily available. If you like IPA's go for it. If you don't, go for it. Its great. Its my go to, its my wifes go to. There is really nothing about this beer that isn't outstanding. To be honest, it ruins me- I now can't have anyother IPA without thinking it's lacking something... it's just not Maximus. Stone, Founders, even Lagunitas IPA, none of them can compare. I know its all personal preference but damn this is a damn good beer. Its Imperial, its got a citrus, its hoppy, its strong (beware it'll sneak up on you), and its incredibly delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a well-done take on a double IPA that calls to mind the famed PtE, given it's balance and an ABV level that doesn't smack you across the face. Certainly don't go into this one expecting a substitute, but it's a nice, unassuming DIPA that would be easy to sit back and have a few (or a bomber) on a pleasant weather day. I could also see it pairing with food rather easily. Perhaps it could be called a """starter""" Double IPA, if such a thing exists."

"The Verdict: Very good. Well balanced despite the massive hops, it’s hard to go wrong with this one. Like they say, “If some is good, more is better.”"

"The great thing about IPAs is that despite them seemingly overdone you can always find one with a new twist and this was quite different for me."
""
""
""
"An amber clear pour with a thin head but good lacing. Faint grain, floral hops of note on the nose for me. Medium carbonation. A touch of sweet malt, mango and lemon within a well balanced but complex flavor pallet. A bit of pepperiness and spices. A proper amount of bitterness as we'll. A solid offering"
""
""
"Not bad at all, if you're in the mood for one and your local sixpack place has it you should get it, why not. But nothing you really need to seek out. I much prefer Lagunitas's Little Sumpin', which fools around a bit with this general concept and is all the better for it."
""
""
"D - A great IPA with all the hop love that Sucks has. I've had this once or twice before and rated it much lower. They don't seem to have dates on the bottle. I think this is one that's fantastic when fresh but dull and rough after too long on the shelf."

"Overall: This will take care of your hop craving, but I feel there was a clash in the type of hops used. The fruit and pine didn't mix right. It made what would have been awesome into a slightly better than average beer."

"pours dark orange into a snifter glass, finger or so of bright white head. aromas of perfumey and citrusy hops. taste has good amount of orange/citrus peel, and grapefruit. hint of spice in the finish, little alcohol coming through, biscuity malt backbone. really flavorful IPA"

"It’s possible this undated IPA is old because the hoppiness is pretty weak. Otherwise, this is a tasty IPA."
"Overall: Not a bad beer, it was on sale for a really good deal, maybe that was why it had that smell going on, run a sell and get rid of the aging inventory, anyway, I still like Lagunitas and would drink this one again. It was much better when it was around 40 degrees rather than, say room temperature."

""
""
""
""

"Taste is sweet citrus and bitter resinous hops. There is some interplay of the flavors, but overall this one is largely harmonious. A solid beer that drinks big without being obnoxious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Cool beer by Lagunitas, bringing some malt flavor to the forefront over typical hop focus. Flavor is a big part of this one, which is what makes it incredibly enjoyable with each and every sip."
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty good beer, full of west coast IPA flavors. Pretty bang on for style, very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great hop flavoring, albeit somewhat muddled. Not overly bitter or overly sweet."
""
""
"The taste brings out a decent malts-hops balance with the hops leaning toward the floral side. Lingering bitterness at the end. A beer that one can like."
""
""
""
""
""
"I was craving a big beer for celebrating the end of Tax Day, and this fit the bill. I appreciate the big body and balance of flavors- this is a very tasty and satisfying brew. It was also cheap for a bomber of strong ale- I only paid something like $4.19 for it at Albertson's."

"Again another great showing of an IPA by Lagunitas. They have really grown on me, and this being my first Maximus I definitely would drink it again. It's not the smack-your-face hop attack that I like when really wanting a DIPA, but it's one where you can easily have 2 or 3 and really feel great about life!"

"Pours a clear copper with over two fingers of head that dissipated surprisingly fast but left really nice lacing behind. The nose has both hoppy and citrus notes. The flavor profile has touch of sweetness along with a mild maltiness. The hoppiness is pleasant, but not up to the quality of a top-tier version of the style. There is a touch of alcohol sourness on the finish."
""
""
"BOD 345/13. Pours a clear amber with a massive head and lacing that retains well. The nose is a blend of sweet citrus (orange and mango) coupled with notes of grapefruit and pine over a sweet caramel background. Almost full bodied with a rich creamy texture. The carbonation level is normal with a touch of effervescence on the finish. The complex, yet balanced, flavor profile is outstanding. It begins with a tart burst of citrus hop flavor like the nose, flows to a mild sweet citric bitterness which recedes into a caramel sweetness. The finish is smooth with a burst of sweetness and lingering light tart bitterness. A complex brewer's masterpiece of balance, flavor and bitterness."

"Nice clean straight forward double IPA. Doesn't seem to be slanted towards an east coast or west coast bias of the style more like a good representation of what you'd expect. Very floral on the nose with a nice head for an IPA. A little more on the orangy-brown color than most with a solid body. It finishes rather smooth and sweet then ends with a slight not overly bitter after taste."

"Try pronouncing it with a Sean Connery accent. Sounds like a beer you don't want to mess with. Glad I did! Nice copper color with an off-white head. Lace that stuck like glue to the glass. Incredible citrus and floral hop aromas. It's a DIPA but is really well balanced. Also higher on the ABV but no bite from the alcohol content. Medium+ carbonation and less than average viscosity. This is a very sessionable DIPA in my opinion. Next time I'm going for the growler fill. PS - I paired it with some roast antelope which is a bit gamey, they both worked well together."
""
"Great beer to stock in the fridge! Has good malt balance with hop balance. My every day IPA! Golden amber color with nice weight. If you want a bit more body to the regular IPA you must try.Just got a 1/6 keg to go in the Kegerator and cant wait to tap into."
""
""
""
"I know Maximus does not get the acclaim some of Lagunitas' other brews do, but for my money, only Sucks surpasses it in their IPA lineup. I suppose personal preference of hop profile plays a big role, and for me this is right n the money. Bitter enough to satisfy my hop itch, but balanced enough to be extremely drinkable."
""
""
""
"Medium body with a blast of dank, earthy hop bitterness that lingers over hints of sweet tropical/citrus fruit and a caramel malt backbone into a bone dry finish. Better balanced and more complex than the aroma suggests. Dry and sticky with grassy pine, spruce tip and resinous hop oils followed by hints of juicy grapefruit, orange pith, pineapple and mango. The intense hop profile is countered by a malt backbone with strong caramel sweetness, toffee and toasted bread. The malt presence is stronger than I usually prefer but in this beer it provides excellent balance without hindering the complex hop flavors. The high ABV is excellently masked with a touch off boozy sweetness in the finish but there's no heat to speak of. Complex, flavorful and dangerously drinkable. Another very solid beer from Lagunitas."
""
"O: Probably my second favorite beer of theirs after Little Sumpin Sumpin, though Sucks is pretty good as well. Definitely worth try if you like DIPAS."

"Pours amberish in color with a nice white head. Smells fruity and hoppy, very pleasent aroma. Mouthfeel is light and bitter. Taste is very hop prevalent along with citrusy fruit. Bitter, hoppy and bitter. This is one of my go to beers, lots of hops but not real heavy. High ABV on this one so tread cautiously."

"Overall: I have been getting more into the Lagunitas offerings and the Maximus does not disappoint. It's a great double IPA with lots of bitter hops, wonderful fruitiness, and a complex flavor profile. For a big beer, it drinks smoothly and doesn't have a big kick of alcohol. It's not the best West Coast IPA, but it certainly seems to epitomize everything that's good about them."

"O: The fresher the better, this one seems a bit old. Going to college in the north bay area I'm a huge Lagunitas fan. They definitely make a unique IPA and IIPA. Lots of flavor very sweet but lots of hops. Great people!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rich Golden amber with a little sediment and a bountiful off white head which lasts throughout the beer. The aroma is all hops. Citrusy, piney, and very fresh. The mouth feel is very smooth with just the slightest amount of coating. Flavor is very typical of a good double ipa. Grapefruit, pine, a little tropical fruit but nothing unexpected. Balance of sweet and bitter is pleasant and satisfying. Overall, this is a very solid ipa from one of my favorite breweries but it is not a stand out. Great tasting and a great beer but nothing to set itself apart from the rest."

"O- This brew is a triumph of cost vs. quality. It's downright cheap for a DIPA, and the quality you get it top notch. I may be in the minority, but I find this more enjoyable than sucks."

"O: Definitive dank DIPA and a classic Lagunitas brew. Very well-priced and widely available. Get this one fresh."

"O - A good beer. Not the best DIPA out there. Very boozy and Malty at times. I wish the hops shined through more. But all in all, it is very floral, and easy to drink. I will have it again."

""

""

"O - I'm glad I tried this, since it's definitely a beer I would get again. Although not sessionable, it's still got a great nose and a comparable taste to make for a good drinking experience. A cheap, year-round alternative to Sucks."
""
""
"O: again, despite the Lagunitas hype- really not impressed. While the alcohol content is well masked, this beer is unbalanced and overpowering in a way that lingers."
"There's so much really good beer out there in this style that I'm sad to report, this brew makes me appreciate the others more. No need for me to go back, especially after having been tempted by the sight and smell and then let down."
"Really good. Just the right amount of alcohol to bounce of the citrucy hops of this beer. This beer makes up for what Lagunitas IPA lacks. Ill get this again."

I f you are not and are aspiring then please disregard this and other reviews and go directly to the Little sumpin reviews. You'll be glad you chose it as your first IPA."

"Not bad but not exactly what I look for in an IPA. It good for something different though."
"From my tasting notes: It poured a golden amber with a strong fruity hop aroma. The Maximus had a good grapefruit hopiness with a sweet malt backbone that helped round out the flavor. This is a really nice IIPA that is more on the citrusy hops side. I am having trouble finding a bad Lagunitas beer, and the Maximus may be my favorite so far."
"Poured into a standard pint glass with very little head and not much lacing. Very hop forward nose consisting of grapefruit and some tropical notes. The flavor was more of the same with tropical fruits, grapefruit, and some booze standing out. The mouthfeel was syrupy with a hint of carbonation. Overall, this is a good double IPA that was fill in for Sucks."

"O: This is a great example of a Double IPA. The alcohol is well hidden and I like the price point. Also I keep on wanting to take another sip even though on the bottle it says """Life is Uncertain. Don't sip. This is a great beer at a nice price point. I need to keep a few around. A very nice and unusually unique example of a DIPA."

"Overall, Lagunitas is really turning stereotypes upside down by producing a west coast IIPA that is adequately malty and balanced, but still deliciously hoppy. At a slightly lower ABV and price point than other highly touted IIPA's (Dogfish Head 90min, Myrcenary to name two of my favs) this makes a valid argument for being the one I stock regularly in my fridge for its benefits to my wallet and its drinkability."

"This will be a go-to for me from now on."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/3/2013. Pours moderately cloudy golden orange color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, lemon zest, pineapple, tangerine, orange zest, floral, pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fantastic aromas with great complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and great strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, floral, grass, light pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, floral, light pine, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity of citrus/floral hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA! All around great complexity and balance of hop and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to sip on the for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering."

"Would definitely have again. Thumbs up."
""
""
""
""
"O: Well, I was definitely caught off guard by this one - in a good way. A superbly well balanced double IPA (although a smaller one at 8.2%). Great mouthfeel and excellent drinkability for the style. Will definitely have this again... wondering how a super fresh bottle would compare?"
""
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer. I know it's not world-class, and I even have trouble categorizing it as a double IPA. Sure, it's stronger than an IPA, but it seems rather unique to me. Not that hoppy, though the hop presence is unmistakable, and rather malty. I'm a big DIPA drinker and this was my first a while ago, but I hadn't had it in a while. So different from others that are really bitter and aromatic. This almost seems to me to approach a strong ale in style. Not a great DIPA but still a great beer, if that makes sense."

"Pours a nice burnished copper with about three fingers of off-white foam. Aroma is a pleasant sweet toffee, grapefruit, raspberry, almost a bit of an old wine fermented sweetness. Taste is herbal weedy hops, orange/grapefruit/kumquat citrus bitters, perhaps some green tea, vegetal flavors to go along with the citrus pith, all underlain by a sweet graham cracker backbone. Nice complexity here although the sweet grain orange peel finish is a tad boozy and maybe a bit coarse. There is some pine too but to my palate bitter citrus runs the show. Nice intermediate level IPA, beginners to this style should start smaller but there are bigger hop bombs out there that are also sweeter from a malt standpoint."

"O- Really like this DIPA, and I recommend and will look for again. This is my second time with it. Much better than the first which was probably too old and got hot in my car."

"O - Very well balanced, high ABV IPA. Hoppy, but not over the top. I'm able to pick out new notes with each sip, as the beer warms. I'm even starting to get a little mango and it's reminiscent of a softer, less hopped Sucks."

"12oz. bottle served in my DT tulip. Pours a dull, burnt orange hue with a slightly hazy clarity and a dense, two-inch, cream-colored head topped with tiny clusters of bubbles concentrated across the center. Head eventually settles into a creamy half inch cap with thick swaths of lacing coating the sides of the glass after each tilt. Nose expresses citrus notes, rind, a hint of toffee, a slight earthiness and perhaps a touch of grapefruit seed. Taste consistent with nose; however, a bit of an herbal character comes out and dulls the toffee sweetness. Finishes with an earthy bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a faint oiliness to the texture, an even carbonation and a light astringency. Overall, a decent balance to the malt profile; however, the flavors come off a bit muddled without really deciding if it wants to be more sweet or more hop forward. It could be an old bottle, but a bit difficult to determine without freshness dating."

"o: head sticks around, as does the lacing. this is an interesting beer. it tastes slightly big, but its not too complex. i'm not sure how old this bottle is, but it is mostly the sweet citrus and malts i'm picking up on - not too bitter, and only at the end of the sip. its above 8% abv is completely hidden, so be careful. even though its sweet, still refreshing."

"Poured from a bottle into a Pint glass, nice golden orange color with a 2 finger head that reduced to a half finger but left wonderful lace with every sip. Aroma is straight up IIPA with hops leading the way, citrus and sugar show up as well. Taste starts sweet and goes from bitter to tang as it moves over the tongue, good citrus going on and you keep wanting another sip. A nice crisp mouthfeel with a slightly oily finish that holds the bitter tang on the back of the throat. Overall a good IIPA from Lagunitas that is easy to drink and full of flavor, easy to find as well...at least in Lincoln, Neb."

"Overall - Lagunitas does it again. I'm starting to like this brewery, and will start purchasing more and more from them. Love their Brown Shugga and Undercover Shutdown. I am not a bitter IPA fan. I guess Lagunitas is doing it right in my opinion. Don't just make it bitter, make it taste good."
"Like every other Lagunitas beer I've tried, Maximus didn't disappoint me. It's definitely a delicious and distinctive DIPA."

"Notes: Solid beer. Was somewhere in between a regular IPA and a DIPA. I couldn't really find any flaws, but it didn't really stand out. Balanced and solid, especially for the price, but don't expect anything amazing or in your face as far as DIPAs go."
"overall: too sweet, could use more alcohol and more dominant hop notes, instead this beer is very sweet, sugary, and malt heavy for a DIPA. May be a stylistic choice, as I prefer grapefruit and citrus dominant IPAs where the malt takes the backseat in the flavor profile, the finish is just too sweet for me. Most Lagunitas beer's I think are on the sweet side, but I usually like most of them, this one was just average at best. I would much prefer Hop Stoopid, Lucky 13, Undercover, or Lil Sumpin Sumpin."

"Overall: I wouldn't consider this a DIPA. I would characterize this as a flavorful Amber ale. The hops are not cutting through on this. It is very sweet and malty. The sweetness overpowers the hops."

""

"Overall - Another excellent Lagunitas offering, damn they are good!"
""
""
""
""

"Enjoyed all aspects of this brew. Nothing particularly stands out with this one, just an overall good beer. The beer stacks up great against others but compared to Lagunitas' flagship IPA it falls a bit short. Seldom do all beers from the same brewery score high, but Lagunitas doesn't brew any bad beer; all are above average."

"I have to say this is another rockstar Lagunitas IPA. I am in love with Sucks and now Maximus. I actually like Lagunitas Imperial and Double IPAs much better than the their regular. Maximus is perfectly balanced. Tons of great hop/pine/spice flavors that are in perfect proportion. This brew also has very little bitterness so perhaps it would be a good IPA for people looking to expand their tastes. A definite go-to IPA for me now. I would buy this over pretty much any other IPA out there."

"O - Overall, this is a great beer, and definitely stands out among the DIPAs I've had. The balance is great and a highlight for me and I would guess for others as well."
"Pours a rather clear, gold-copper color with a nice head and retention. Lacing is tough and resilient. Aroma is hoppy and boozy. Taste is rich with a good citrusy and bitter bite. Notes of lemon and pine. This is an IPA that not only has the hoppy blast but the malty blast right up there with it. Strong mouthfeel but no booziness detected and aftertaste is mild. A well balanced work from Lagunitas."

""
""
"Overall, not bad but I expected better."

"overall: i rated this 4.25 because of how much the taste surprised me after the """uniform IPA""" appearance and smell. The taste was just fantastic. Must get."
""
""

"The sweet+hoppy combo is very well done here. This is what I've come to know as a """classic 6-pack""". Tough to beat this for $10. Yet another Lagunitas beer makes it to my regular rotation..."

"Overall, this is an excellent DIPA to try. I could easily see this as being a favorite for some. For me, it's drinkable and balanced. But there's some slight astringent characters that pull me away from thinking it's the perfect DIPA for me."

"High B-"

"Almost any beer I had while in Germany (kolsch, lager, bock, weizen) kicks this beers ass."

"Pours golden amber with orangish accents capped by a huge bright white; great retention with gobs of splotchy lacing. Huge citrus notes; pineapple, mandarin orange blossoms, some pine sap. Pineapple, orange pulp, resin, dank, grapefruit rind, hints of lemon zest, some hints of sweet malt and flora. Moderate carbonation, full-bodied with a substantial malt presence. A very solid, well-balanced DIPA."

"D - Quite approachable... Doesn't pack a huge punch for a American Double / Imperial IPA... This won't """wow""" anybody, but it won't turn anybody off either... Won't be my first choice when I'm in the market for a sixer, but I certainly wouldn't turn it down... A notch down from other Lagunitas offering... HIdes the 8.2% ABV exceptionally well..."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a really solid DIPA, though they have made better in Petaluma for sure. I'd love more of a tropical fruitiness throughout, less biscuit, and less grassy notes."

"A solid tasting beer, not as bold as Lagunitas Sucks but a decent drink still the same."

"O: This brew packs a punch!! For hop lovers only!!!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours with almost no head and is a light read color. The nose here is all grapefruit and sweet hops. This matches well with the flavor which is fairly sweet, again almost fruit-juice like. This is everything I love in an IPA, lots of floral hops and strong, sweet grapefruit flavors. This is a must buy for me again!"

"Really nice IPA. Reminiscent of Sucks but a little more potent, more dry hop, and a bit less floral hop complexity. For a readily available brew, it's pretty fantastic."
""
""
""
"This beer is generally advertised as a step up from Lagunitas' renown IPA - hoppier and a little stronger. While it's certainly more aromatic, it tends to fall short of the standard IPA's balance. Overall, it's a good beer, but when given the choice, there are many other over-the-top doubles that do a better job than this one."

"Overall- Solid IPA. It's no Sucks, but it's pretty good."

"Medium bodied with average carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. I wish this was just a little less bitter, and that the alcohol was better hidden. Not bad though."
""
"Big letdown from Lagunitas."
""
""
""
"Overall- Solid, good beer with some hints at being a really good beer. Not a DIPA for hopheads though there is enough hop presence to keep them somewhat interested. Worth a try and a beer I will be buying again in the future."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very interesting IPA, really well balanced but there is an aftertaste in it that I can't quite pinpoint. perhaps peanut-y resin. High ABV on this beer, but its masked very well. Also getting some smooth caramel hops on the finish which pair really well with the grainy-nuttiness in this also intensely hopped IPA"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - conservative for the style. Malty sweet and weak on the hops. Decent flavor, but a little too sweet for me."
""

"Another solid hoppy Lagunitas brew. Hop Stoopid's better, tho."

"I am sad this is our last Lagunitas bottle, as they have such a good line of beers… but all three we did were good, and I love their expected hop profile. They are like Stone in that regard, providing you a consistent and enjoyable experience regardless of the beer you pick. If there is a bar in the Valley that has this on tap, I need to try this on draft. It would be good nitro, too."
"Light not DIPA type; enough hops to carry alcohol; good value"
""
"Like a lot of lagunitas beers, it sits bitter too long in the after taste. Would rather have a stronger boozy or malt taste. Continue to be surprised they are such a revered brewery...best thing about this beer is the appearance, pours beautifully in a glass."

"Edit: After having this beer fresh I am convinced this is a great brew , the flavor is malty sweet with just the right amount of hops , loving it"
""
""
"O - Overall, this is a good beer. It's like a few of their beers, which drinks like candy with hops. Would pick up another six pack if I were in the mood for some."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, for me this beer is average for the style. Probably won't buy it again but I'm not upset that I did."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A fairly tasty double IPA. It drinks pretty easy and has a decent drier flavor profile (especially at the end of the taste). Overall it is pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I have had this before and yes I will be buying it again and again. Malty and rich of a light caramel texture becomes addicting. After reviewing a sub-par DIPA this is what it at minimum should all be tasting like. Grab a snifter and a piece of cheddar and treat yourself to quality. Salud!"
"Overall-for the price this is a wonderful value double. It's not a ball buster like a lot of doubles out there, this one goes in the opposite direction being very drinkable. Lagunitas is slowing becoming one of my new favorite breweries simply because they make good beer for a value price. I'm looking forward to trying their other offerings. 4"
""
""
"As I have said many times I do prefer this to Sucks slightly, to me the hops are just as good but it has a bigger malt backbone that gives it a sweet complexity just not found in Sucks... Probably my second favorite DIPA."
""
""
""
"O: This is a damn good beer when fresh. Well balanced west coast style"
""
""
""
"O: Ended up being pretty darn fresh and tasty. I knew I would like this but the BA score turned me off, so...another exmaple of why not to always trust the BA score. I should have known better. This is a must-try for any craft beer lover and especially the hop heads out there. Lagunitas does it again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a solid DIPA for a very good price. It showcases pine and tropical fruit hop flavors and aromas with a solid caramel malt backbone. There is nothing wrong with this beer, but there are too many other great DIPAs for me to revisit this one too often."
""
""
""
""
"Try this and don't be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Lagunitas is a great brewery, and Maximus is a great, solid go-to IPA thats available year round. While some might be upset at the strong malt backbone in this, I find it to be a great change of pace for most double IPA's. Bought a case and have enjoyed every bottle."
""
""
"Overall: Picked up a sixer based on other good Lagunitas beers, but this is a good IPA! I appreciate the malty balance on a style that can get carried away with hops."
""
""
""
"Solid DIPA with great value. A beer that remains close to standard without much creative flair."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: All around nice, easy to drink IPA. Hipster points for this one. Quality one, this one is."
""
""
"O - A balanced, enjoyable double IPA. The hops are a bit too subtle in the taste, but that could be due to the age of the bottle (which I don't know). Good drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Lagunitas knows how to dump some hops into a bottle of beer and make it taste good; this is no exception. A fine DIPA that is as drinkable as an IPA. lighter and less complex than some"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good Imperial IPA. Looks great in a snifter. Smells and tastes pretty good. Not the best Imperial IPA I've had, but not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"In my book, if you want a steam beer/IPA go for it. If you want a sweeter IPA, try 'sucks' or 'sumpin sumpin'."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Lagunitas is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. They know their hops and implement them to perfection. Highly recommend this one to all hop heads. Would I drink it again? Yes."
"Overall it's worthy of the name Lagunitas, which should say enough right there.  The brand name made me non-leary of trying a whole sixer rather than just a single, even tho I could have picked up a single at the large liquor store I found this at (Gabriel's, San Antonio)."
"Overall, just a strange and very unbalanced beer. I almost feel like pouring this out."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Fluffy, off-white head, high retention on a clear copper body. Soapy, sticky lacing. Aroma is dominated by grassy, fresh hoppiness, with some grapefruit and tangerine. Taste is bitter with some malt balance. Not totally over the top bitterness, but quite satisfying and well put together. No alcohol tasted and certainly delicious."
"This beer was a bit of a disappointment to me. It pours up a fairly clear gold with a small head, poor retention, and plenty of lacing. The nose is mostly citrus and alcohol. Taste is malt forward but the hops get overtaken by a distinct alcohol taste on the finish. Mouthfeel is very average."
""
""
""
""
"O - Simple and does what it sets out to accomplish. Found this at an astounding $8/six-pack. Money well spent."
"Overall - Solid hop forward IPA."

""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-a nice DIPA but would prefer a little more hops and a little less malt"
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, a fucking delicious IPA. Seriously great. Holy shit is this wonderul. I will definitely have this one again. Best , most perfectly balanced beer I've ever had. Hands down a Heavyweight champ right here. I've been advocating beer for the past 8 months to find something this great and I finaly have. Thank you Lagunitas!."

"Poured clear light copper with a single finger head. Smell is hoppy needless to say, fairly malty, some pineapple, some pine. Taste is well balanced, not bitter at all,I get very decent amount of lemon and earthy pine, some bubblegum. Texture is great. Overall it's a great IPA but I like them to have a little more citrus and pine. On the verge if being imperial but I think it falls just short, almost tastes like an imperial American pale ale. Another great offering by the great people at lagunitas"
""
""
"As for most IPAs, Maximus has the strong hint of floral/citrus/pine smell and flavor. it pours a bronze color. the ABV is at the right level for me, a two to three beer drinker per sitting. If you like IPAs, you will find it here. This is a very tasty beer from beginning to end, you will not be disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A BIG beer that's surely not for wimps (Surely that's why this is a DIPA), and I think it's absolutely fantastic all around. If there's really any downside, it's simply that I doubt I'd drink more than one in a session just because it really is so """big.""" Not just that, but it costs about 30 cents more per bottle... not sure I'd pay that extra too often when I could get Two Hearted for a bit less."
""
""
""
""

"Overall looked and smelled great tastes good but not great, would make my best I2PA's but pretty close. Defiantly worth having."

"if I can find this fresh, it's a fantastic buy. After tasting many many IPAs and DIPAs I still come to this one as a reliable favorite. A must-buy."

""
"Overall, this is a very solid, year-round, easily accessible dipa that has great profiles accross the board."
""
""
""
"O - Phenomenal appearance and smell, but just average taste lends you to the proverbial set of blue balls with this brew."
""
"O: This beer is very enjoyable with a nice combination of hop flavors and aromas and a decent amount of balance to it. Fairly easy to drink with a pretty decent ABV that is well hidden from the taste and smell."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this is one of my favorite IPA’s. It’s in the top five for sure. Massive hop flavor and aroma and a big malt backbone to balance it out makes this beer one of my favorites."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is a clear copper color with a thin head. Aroma is hoppy with notes of fir and citrus. A bit of caramel or bread, too. Taste is a bit of malt up front, followed with a serious hop blast. The finish is bitter hops with lots of dry grapefruit. Mouthfeel is good. It's nicely carbonated and there is just a hint of alcohol warming. Overall, an excellent double IPA. Hoppy and assertive."

"Lagunitas Maximus IPA ---3.5/5."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very nice, easy drinking DIPA, found myself slugging this one back fairly quickly for a big beer. Heavy on the sweet tropical fruits, and nicely balanced with the toasty sweet malt, yet another solid beer from Petaluma."
""
""
""
"O - Great lighter look to this beer for a double IPA. Smell is fresh and bright. Malt holds up well, bitterness doesn't overwhelm nor is sharp. Perfectly dry. Great feel. Excellent example of a double IPA. No wonder why I guzzled the first 5 in the pack down before I took the time to review the final one."
"another big brutal hoppy offering from lagunitas. pour is surprisingly orange, glowing, but the head is a let down, white but small. the nose is big sweet and bitter fresh hops, some english malts but they are way back. sweet up front, bitter on the back end, just what i like. the taste is the same, maybe a little too sweet for my palate as a big ipa, but it doesnt last long, and its not sugary, just like fresh hop sweetness. could stand a touch more carbonation, but the body is a nice medium, and its pretty drinkable for its abv. for once the yeast in a lagunitas beer seems to be different, my main knock against them has been all the same yeast for everything, but this doesnt appear to be that, which i am thankful for. overall a good beer, a 6er to share, a little sweet, but a nice wintery ipa. cant taste the booze at all, just the hops."
""
""
"O: This beer is nice and hoppy but doesn't seem as malty and strong compared to other beers in the style. Any traces of alcohol are well masked from the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a pretty good beer but not as good as hop stoopid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a pretty good beer. Sweet and nicely balanced. Easy to drink."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is an ok beer but middle of the road as far as IIPA's go. The body is a little too dry and this isn't too much different from their standard IPA. Hop Stoopid is better and I probably won't seek this one out again."
""
""
""
""
"The 6 pack holder boasts 72 IBUs but the bottle claims 59. Tastes more like the latter. A balanced DIPA if there is such a thing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Very nice beer. Lagunitas does it again with a hopped up specialty. Like many people say, they do hops right. I think by now I could tell if I'm drinking a beer by them just because all the beers I've ever had had that same taste with such unique hop flavors. Very easy to drink beer, that I will come back to."
""
""
"O: What a great beer. This bottle is almost 2 months old and it is fantastic. I can only imagine how much I would love it super fresh. Recommended and I will seek this out again for sure. I can see myself coming back to this to give even higher marks."
""
""
""
""
""
"Gave me a wicked headache in the morning, though. Hmm."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is thick, smooth, and refreshing. Not too much carbonation. I like this beer, and when offered I will drink it, but honestly I like this beer for the nose and feel more than the actual taste. Lagunitas standard IPA is a little better from my standpoint"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty solid DIPA from these guys. Still think I like Hop Stoopid a bit more, but this one is available in 6 packs. Enjoyed many times before and many more in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Looks fantastic and a really nice mouthfeel. Smell was much too faint, the dominant aroma was caramel malts, and a detectable very citrusy aroma. Tastes quite good but I would have much more of a hop bite. I should also note that this beer was put in an ice cooler as soon as it was purchased, and although it remained cold at all times I'm sure the temperature fluctuated more than I would have liked so I intend to update this after drinking a fresher bottle without the added variables."
"O: I'm not really interested in having another one. It's like drinking an alcoholic glass of grapefruit juice. It's very sweet and tart making all of the other flavors are very subdued. Lagunitas single IPA has much more character than this here."
""
""
""
"Pours a light yellowish orange, with prominent and sustaining head, inviting, and less orange than typical. Smells clean, and newly manufactured, and bright, and citrus, and balsam and sweet malt. Tastes sweet at first, then bitterness builds, the carbonation scrubbing and sustained; mouth-feel is slightly thicker but not out of typical for a DIPA. Some flavors of citrus, and mango maybe and pineapple, and new electronics, and the alcohol is moderately prominent, and lightly warming. A solid entry as a DIPA, and fun to have although I'd reach for others in their line-up usually otherwise."
""
"overall - good to great choice for an ipa. very drinkable on its own. very good balance."
""
"O - For the ABV this is a great beer and pretty reasonable priced for the style."

"A great double from lagunitas. I think Hop Stoopid is better, but Maximus is heavier on the bittering hops. I love Lagunitas."
""
"O: A great take on the West Coast DIPA. Good hop flavor and bitterness. Not quite excellent, but a great example of the style and definetly worth a try."
""
"O - This is a nice IPA that I can regularly get from the west coast here in Michigan. Its to bad they do not date this one. It is my favorite from Lagunitas to date. Really nice for any hop head that likes there beers a little sweeter. Enjoy and cheers!"

"O- A pretty interesting Double IPA, a lot of tropical fruits then sort of shifts into a different kind of beer- more piny and hoppy"
""
""
""
""
""

""
""

""
"Mouthfeel is light but slightly sticky. Overall, this is an excellent beer."

"Atmosphere is great. Golden brown hue, with a frothy head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is a full combination of pine, with sweet notes. Flavor is a well balanced hoppy concoction of bitter and sweet components. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A pretty classic DIPA in the sense that it's about what you'd expect from the category. It fills the bill when you're craving a DIPA without going off in any odd directions. That also means it's not exactly notable. But it is well done. Hop Stoopid is a good bit better and more unique."
""
"A well made DIPA, pleasant hop profile."
""
"A very fruity DIPA, not bad, but no real groove."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A nicely balanced DIIPA by Lagunitas. This is not one of the most hoppiest beers that I have sampled but it is still quite enjoyable. Glad I tried this and I will revisit this in the future."
"O: This is OK, less hop-forward than I would prefer. The hop profile could be more fruity & more assertive. However, this beer is at least four months old, so if a fresher example yield a better result, I will update."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very nice.... As I pour a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, it develops a nice 2-inch head which trails very nicely as I drink it.... It has a hoppy (not too hoppy) taste with citrusy, fruity, and caramel like notes to match the nose of the beer.... I smell caramel, peach, and citrus.... It has a wonderful aftertaste that lingers.... I enjoy a few brews out of the Lagunitas Brewery, but this is amongst my favorites from them."
""
""
"Overall - A nice dipa. Moreso a west coast style, good balance, a nice example of a hoppy beer with a malt backbone. Good price for a 6'er, good avaibilty and good taste makes this a winner and worth a try for sure."
""
""
"O: A solid DIPA, well-priced (9.99/6 pack) DIPA from Lagunitas, though I prefer Hop Stoopid. Also, the alcohol presence in the nose and taste is a bit of a letdown, but should still be given a chance if you love IPAs/DIPAs like myself. Cheers!"
""
"I got this bottle straight from the Swedish importer two days ago. And although I normally don’t notice tiredness in American hop bombs as my friends tend to do, I must say this one was too tired and old."

"Give it a try. If you are a """hop-head""" like myself you certainly will enjoy yourself."
""

"Better than average but not quite exceptional. I wish the tropical fruit was just as strong in the flavor as it was in the aroma."

""
""

"This was my first introduction to Lagunitas and to the Double IPA style, and I was not disappointed in the slightest."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not sure how old this bottle is, but I certainly didn't get much hop flavor from it. I prefer this brewer's standard IPA to this sweet, boozy concoction. This beer is very reminiscent of DFH 90min IPA. It's pretty well-crafted, but it's not the kind of IPA (or IIPA) I seek out. I prefer those with big bitter tropical fruit notes. I won't be buying this stuff again."
""

"This is medium to full bodied. This beer is okay, I probably wouldn't get it again unless I knew for certain it was very fresh."
""

"O - Really solid IPA that would probably be considered much better if it were a limited release... I for one am grateful to have such a fantastic IPA on the shelves year round at a reasonable price."
""
""
""
""
""
"Everything a DIPA should be: complex and tasty, hoppy and smooth enough to hide the ABV. High drinkability, I highly recommend this beer."
""
""
""
"O: A very-well balanced DIPA that has very low bitterness for the style yet keeps all the hoppy goodness in the nose and flavor. Too easy to drink at 8.2%, so watch out"
"I'm surprised the alcohol is as apparent as it is. Not too shabby overall, but a few tweaks in the appreciable alcohol department could make it considerably better."

"Pours clear copper with a dense white head that settles to a thin cap, leaving lots of soapy lacing. Pungent aromas of grapefruit, pine resin, pineapple, and mango with a moderately sweet caramel malt profile. More grapefruit and pine resin flavors, with a substantial malt profile. Flavor isn't as big as the nose suggests, but the bitterness is pleasant, and long-lasting. Slightly sticky mouthfeel with a medium-full body and good carbonation. Not my favorite Lagunitas offering, a touch to big and sticky. Still not bad."

"O: A dangerously drinkable beer at 8.2% abv. Very refreshing, and it would even be quaffable if it weren't for its strength (not that it ever stopped me). A vibrant tropical hop character makes it an enticing drink. However, being that the size and bitterness are somewhat tame for what we now expect from an Imperial IPA, it doesn't really stand out above the crowd anymore. That doesn't change the fact that it's a tasty beer at an appealing price ($10.99 six-pack) with wide availability. That's a winning combination."

"This is a big brew, not the biggest but it certainly stand taller and the balance here is not seen much from strong hoppy beers. Drinkability is a big factor for me especially when size is above normal. Glad I revisit this ale when I can."
"V-very refreshing drinkable DIPA"
"I hadn't had this one in a while, but I recall it being my favorite Lagunitas years ago. I have had many more Lagunitas since, so I don't think it would hold that throne any longer. But its' a good beer, for sure. I'd say, as DIPAs go, it leans more toward the malty sweet Maharaja type, but without as much body, richness, or caramel malt. It's not a typical Sand Diego style hop bomb at all, but the simpler grain bill gives it a cleaner canvas for the hops to perform upon. But the hops, to me, are more flavor focused than bittering. I'll have it again."
"My search for the perfect IPA is over! I have spent a lot of time and money looking for the perfect IPA, and finally I have found it. I seem to always get suckered in by reviews from this site and others about how good an IPA is or isn't, but my search is officially over. This is my go to beer! Unfortunately it is difficult to find."

"o - quite enjoyable, though i think i'd prefer a little less malt presence in this one. the fuller body is nice but it does make it a bit of a chore to drink, especially in this summer heat. still a fine beer and one i'd gladly return to."
"Overall - This is a good DIPA, not great, but certainly good! I would recommend this to anyone who likes hops, IPA's etc. Good hot weather brew, good offering from an excellent brewery in general."

"O- This is a pretty good DIPA, I got a feeling my 6 pack is a bit dated but it doesnt take away from the beer too much. A solid choice."
"Rich and hazy orange copper color. Very short pale white head with great lacing. Strong floral hops, earthy citrus and creamy malts on the aroma. First sip is smooth and malty, hop bitterness, wheat. Bready mouthfeel. Body is balanced, clean and crisp. Medium sized body with medium carbonation."

"Maximus is a nice bright copper colour with an off-white head that doesn't last very long, but the lacing is nice. The smell is quite nice, lots of floral and citrus notes overtop a healthy bready malt. Same goes for the taste, although it's a little light for the style. However, it's quite well balanced even though the hops dominate. The taste is more piney than anything else. Nice dry finish. Quite a good double IPA I'd say. Worth trying at least once."

"As others have mentioned this does not have a freshness date (shame shame) so it may have seen a bit of time sitting on the shelf, but either way that leaves room for improvement- either more hops/less sweetness to begin with or put on a freshness date so we know if it's past prime."
""

"O- Better than a 4.0 but not quite a 4.5. Really great sweet to citrus/pine balance. I love the spicy basil/licorice/citrus wrapped up in a sweet Flan pudding. I gotta remember to grab this one more often."

"O: Excellant balance between heavenly sweet malt and bitter hops. Incredibly smooth for level of bitterness."

"Pours clean clear honey colored. Head dissipates quickly but sticky lacing follows the beer down. Grapefruit and solid hops with a balanced malt backbone. Great beer. This is my go to beer when I'm feeling like a big malty hoppy offering. One of my top 10 favorites for sure."

"Pours a clear copper color with a good sized white head and decent lacing. Aroma of orange peel, citrus, grapefruit and fruity notes. Taste is of citrus hops blended well with a nice malty sweet back bone. A bit of pine bitterness comes through late. Finishes on the dry side and body is moderately full."
""
"Maximus comes in the glass looking a bright golden color with some faint yellow mixed in. Very pale looking with a small little cap of white foam that does not stick. Not much life to the bubbles. Smell is all citrus, with some bubblegum and some underlining biscuit malt scent spewing outward. A lot of grapefruit with mango. Taste is pretty subdued. The malt takes forth and takes over what looks to be a nice citrus bomb. I get it, but not the citrus burst i crave. Some mango, orange and grapefruit mixed in with malt and a hit of alcohol toward the end of the glass. Feel is medium and not as syrupy as some other DIPA's that I have had. A small amount of alcohol is in the aftertaste with biscuit flavor, A nice attempt at this beer, but not on the top tier list. I will find a fresh ass bottle and review that when I get a chance to compare."

"O: Overall, a very nice example of one of my favorite styles.  Both nose and taste not as impressive as some of the best of the style, but the reasonable price and easy availability make it a worthy regular in my rotation, and certainly worth a try if you have never had it.  "

"Poured coppery with a finger of white foam. Solidly lacy. Smell is slightly citric and pine with solid caramelly malt presence. Taste is immediately citric - oranges and lemon, then a very ample malt infusion subdues the bitterness, and loads in some feathery sugar notes, finally a bit of pine resin surfaces and slight lingering bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is great, it holds together well and has just about perfect carbonation. An interesting beer, not as hoppy-bitter as I'd expect from a DIPA labeled Maximus, but its got some nice hop flavors and is a good drinking beer nonetheless."

"O: It’s a well-crafted beer; everything seems to have been well thought out. From its color, to its balance of smells and flavors, to how almost perfectly it was carbonated, it is one solid beer. I will be adding this to my rotation, to be sure. This would have been perfect with pasta; too bad my stomach’s fighting me, or I’d have made that happen."

"O- I like it but not as much as other Lagunitas IPA's. I especially like their regular IPA and """Lagunitas Sucks""" and this just doesn't stack up to them in my book. Just don't love the hop profile and malt forwardness."

"12oz bottle, pours bright orange/copper with a thin white head that leaves a little lacing on the glass. Aromas are fruity, floral hops, grapefruit, rubbing alcohol. Tastes are similar to aromas - fruity hops with juicy grapefruit, overly boozy with some caramel notes. Mouth-feel is medium bodied with modest carbonation. Overall, it's good but not a favorite of mine. I do like the juicy fruitiness of the hops, hence the 4's for aroma and taste."

"D - A solid all around DIPA that's easy to drink and tasty to do so. While this brew doesn't exactly reinvent the wheel, it stands as a good reference for exactly what this style represents. Very drinkable and nicely balanced; well done Lagunitas!"

"Pours a pale, clear, orange copper with a one finger bright white head. Nice lacing. Aroma of grapefruit and orange, hints of tropical fruits and slight floral notes. Sweeter citrus notes start this flavor profile off. Grapefruit and orange. Sweet bready and sticky sweet caramel malt. Bit life at the finish with some floral hops and hints of fresh pine. Balanced for sure, hops are a bit muted for a freshly dated beer. Solid sweetness, but just an average example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not a bad showing for a DIPA but nothing I'd go out of my way to get again. Could use a little more hops to give that overkill hoppyness that I expect form a DIPA."
"Overall: Decent, but lacks some of the depth and punch I would expect from the style. Hops are heavy on the orange and it gets distracting from time to time. Nice level of malts. Solid, and a good notch in the Lagunitas belt."
""
"O: I seem to remember liking this beer more than I do now. I still like it, but I used to hold it in high esteems. Still very drinkable for a hophead but it does have some major balancing issues. Luckily I still have a lot of that hophead in me and I enjoy it."
""
""
""
""
"This pours a hazy light gold with a medium sized white head. Aroma of hay and stale hops, not much sweetness. Flavor follows with dry, stale hops, a good bit of hay, nearly no sweetness, and an unpleasant finish. I'm not sure what happened with this one, and will have to revisit in the future."

"O: Very enjoyable beer. It's really a pleasure to drink and remarkably refreshing given the amount of hops."

"Medium bodied mouthfeel with a nice smooth and well-rounded character. Overall, Maximus is quite a tasty beverage but it doesn't quite stand out as a Double IPA. Either way, it's not bad for a nice refreshing drink after a long day."
""
""
""
"Color is dark amber with a slight red-orange tint. The pale white head is moderately sized, lasting for a good while but leaving little lacing. Very nice fruit cocktail scents of peach, pear, and grapefruit. The taste is not the hop bomb of other IPAs I've had lately - it's fairly balanced. Citrus hops are dominant, but malts make their presence known. There's a nice bite to the finish and a tingly mouthfeel. I prefer my IPAs with a stronger hop presence, but this was good and drinkable."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was how very hoppy and full of flavor it was. Everything is smooth, especially with warmth, and it doesn’t blow your head off at any point. This is true of both the taste and the aroma, which showed nice blending throughout. For such a full beer we would have liked to see a bigger head on it, which may have helped develop more cream and slurp on the feel."
""
"Despite the aroma, I can't seem to convince my brain that this doesn't taste like a well-glazed ham. This actually makes me hungry. Regardless, this would be a great DIPA, but it loses some points because it's too sweet."
""
""
"I like this example. It's not the in-your-face! hop punch that I'm used to but I'll be damned if I can't recognize balance! Check it!"
""
""
""
""
""
"While I haven't tried a lot of beers from Lagunitas, I have enjoyed both Hop Stoopid and Maximus a great deal, and it was high time I reviewed this one. I really like the fact that this beer makes all the right moves where other double IPAs tend to misstep: It's not overly syrupy, it doesn't overwhelm with too much bitterness at the close, and it doesn't allow the higher alcohol content to translate into a boozy taste. A nice example of this style."

"Unlimited Release! Why not!"

"On the palate the Lagunitas Maximus is very similar to the aromas. Very bright and flavorful hops are dominated by a very soft, smooth, and citrusy style of hops. There's a slight hint of spice in the mid-palate, with a touch of malty sweetness on the back-end. Much the same way that DFH 90 Min is a hoppy yet sweeter style IPA than the 60 Min, this Maximus brew is a little bit on the sweet side. Despite being rated at over 70 IBUs, the Lagunitas Maximus DIPA is quite easy to drink, and verges on refreshing."
"12 oz into tulip glass. Filtered orange/amber body, lots of bubbles and a good foamy head with lacing. Very strong hop scent, pine & citrus, sharp and pungent, musky and herbal characters as well. Taste is bitter and sour but not painfully so. Lots of grapefruit and bitterness dominating a little sweetness peeking through. Overall a great example of the style."

"I like how the beer comes together being about four months old. I appreciate that the hops are still complimentary, but are subdued revealing a truly appreciable malt profile."

"The mouthfeel was medium to full. Slick texture but adequate carbonation. Classic California DIPA."

"Overall, this is a decent brew, but it's in the maltier realm of DIPAs without being really interesting enough to stand apart. We'll probably buy this again because it's competent and inexpensive and available everywhere, but this isn't in the upper echelon of the style."

"Pours a transparent golden amber with a nice frothy white head that kept around for the entire glass with good lacing. It smells delicious, with strong citrus notes, grapefruit, delicious hoppy joy. The taste was great as well. It's bitterness is extremely apparent and it slams you in the face with citrus goodness. The bitterness stays with you for some time, making the enjoyment of this beer a prolonged experience and a lot of enjoyment. Low carbonation and a decent body on this one."

""

"Big juicy mouthfeel with lots of tropical fruit and a slightly mint finish. Bitterness is slightly high. Some grassy notes on the finish as well. Flavors are concentrated and well blended but pungent. Nothing new really except a very harsh bite that builds. Worth a try, might be for you. I oddly found more balance on their regular ipa though. Malt backbone isn't as big as the nose leads it on to be. Slightly bigger than their regular ipa but not as big as it should be."
"Pours an orange-ish color w/ a slight off white head. Average lacing on my snifter glass. The nose is mainly citrus, orange, grapefruit, and some hops. Fairly sweet, and very balanced. Taste is a little bit of a step up. Same profile as the nose, but better. Very little of the 8.2% ABV in the taste. A little on the sweet side, and I could use more hops bite... Still- it's solid. Feel is medium with a nice hops/malt thing happening. Average carbonation. Overall, a very nice DIPA- not world class, but a great accessible beer."
""
"Overall- This hop profile is outrageously appetizing. It is not like my own experience with IPA's have run the gamut, but as of now, this is the most original, straight citrus-fruity profile I have encountered. It totally makes the beer. If you are a hop head, give it a go."
"O- A little extreme for my tastes but I guess that's why it's called Maximus. Just have to be in the mood for a hop bomb."

"I am not an IPA fan...at least until now. I am now a convert. The beer poured straw colored and had a healthy head (about two fingers)...thick and creamy. The tast was refreshing...had a nice hoppy bite but not pucker-up bitter. It tasted like a pine forest smells. Unlike other IPAs I've had this one was even a bit sweet - probably due to the 8.2% Alc. The action swirled around the back of my tongue and throat and descended all the way to my toes with warmth rebounding to the top of my head. I've drank a 22oz bottle during this review...time to go get another!"

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a very attractive bright orange, as clean as any beer I have ever seen. A one inch slight off white head, that settles after a minute, to a nice foamy film. Pretty lacing, not in excess. Smell is tons of citrus, pineapple, mango, tangerine, pine, and grass. Taste is all of that, with a wallup of grapefruit in the finish, oh boy. Body is on the thinner side for the style and that makes it so drinkable. This is a great beer and a great price. Plus a freshness on bottle dated 298. Lagunitas rarely fails. DIPA six packs, less than $10, less than a mile way, Merry Christmas to me."

Dangerously drinkable (I finished this off fairly quickly and want another), works as a smooth sipper on its own and as a great beer with a meal for washing things down (cinnamon beef stew in this case - would go great with a Burger too I think). Quite good and definitely worth picking up again. This may be my new favorite DIPA."

"O: Alright, maybe it was just my expectations after trying Hop Stoopid, but I haven’t been feeling great about my recent adventures with Lagunitas. Maybe it needs to be extra-fresh to be truly impressive, so I’ll keep an open mind about the brewery. In all, this was an agreeable drink, but nothing more."
"Great brew. Loved this one. Rich and bitter, this one could sneak up on you."
"O: above average but I feel like its not as intense as a double should be, I like the company a lot, it seems pretty solid all around, look forward to trying some more in the future."
"This beer hits the marks for a solid American Pale Ale, but I'm not sure it clears the bar for a double IPA. 7.5% abv is well integrated and no boozy notes emerge. Citric hops, centering on grapefruit, predominate. Moderate hops body with some caramel malt showing through. Finish is clean with the barest touch of tin."
"This is a really good beer, but the flavor and bitterness are more like a regular IPA than a double."
"(O) I really enjoy Lagunitas, but there was something off about this beer. Possibly a bad bottle/batch, so I will revisit it at some point. The initial reaction is not a great one though. The aroma was alright, but the flavor was too sweet. Almost like an IPA and an American Triple combined."
"Overall: I liked it and It was a solid DIPA, especially for the price of the 6-pack. I would definitely buy it again, but if I want my pallet to be assaulted by hops, I'll look somewhere else."
"That being said this is a tasty beer that I’ll drink again."
"Had this one in a clear pint glass. As a IPA enthusiast I enjoyed it. But for those that might be intimidated by the """double""" end of things, it was very decent in a different range of hop flavor. Not as potent as I would of expected."
"Light carbonation, alcohol is faint and well-hidden. I thought this would be hoppier, but this is still quite nice."
"O: A solid DIPA from Lagunitas. It's good, but it doesn't have any qualities that stand out amongst other DIPAs. I believe their brew """Hop Stoopid""" is more satisfying. Despite what was said, Maximus is still worth checking out."
"if i were you, i would drink this straight from the bottle."
"Frankly, I'm shocked at the relatively low ratings for this brew. Absolutely no way is this a B-rated beer. Lagunitas may not have hit a home run with this one, but it's at least a double or a triple, which brings it clearly up into the A- or A rating. This is now my go-to DIPA, for sure. Just an easy-drinker, yet contains enough punch to satisfy the high-gravity drinker in me."
"Pours clear copper with a big, fluffy, sticky head. The aroma jumps out with a big blast of ripe fruit - pear, apricot, some mango, with a piney hop edge that comes off almost like a musky rosemary. The flavor is sharp and piny with a pungent nutty grain and a citrus bitterness. The mouthfeel is prickly and the finish betrays a hint of alcoholic hear."
"Another good beer from these guys."
"Solid beer. In my opinion, better than their regular IPA, but not as good as some other DIPAs on the market."
"O: I liked this one; serves as a good weekly hop fix for a non-hophead."
"Thought it would be better, but overall it was decent beer."
"overall i think this is an above-average DIPA, reasonably tasty and enjoyable, though not a world-beater."
"Good IIPA, but not great."
"Nice copper color with a good heading. Not crazy lacing but still some good retention. Decent aroma of pine and citrus hops, a nice toffee and caramel sweetness in the background. The taste however is a bit muted. More of a sappy malt backbone with a decent sting of bitter hops on the tongue but not what the name suggests. Medium bodied kind of chewy,decent carbonation. The ABV stated at 8.2% which is much bigger than the 7.5% which is stated here. An ok IIPA but with the amount of hoppy IPA's in the world this one doesn't stand a chance."
"O - Nice showing from lagunitas. interesting flavors for an IPA."
"Overall-Good beer to sip on, not the type of IPA I'm going after on a hot summer day. Still a nice sipping IPA especially at 8.2% would only drink 3 max. Yet another good Lagunitas offering."
"it oh so smooth."
"O: This is a very nice DIPA. I love the pine/grapefruit flavours. This is quite a dry IPA. 4"
"Overall, another decent brew from Lagunitas, but while i enjoy hoppy beers and DIPA's, this doesn't seem to have the """it""" factor."
"Pours a dark honey color and a 1/2 finger head forms, but is gone with the blink of an eye. A nice sporadic lacing is left around the sides of the glass. I smell apricots, bitter hops, grassy notes, and alcohol. I taste notes of malt, malt, and more malt. I catch a bitter backbone from the hops, but this one isn't very balanced. This beer isn't very crisp and the carbonation is just ok. Overall this beer just doesn't do it for me. I would say DIPA is my favorite style and this is trailing way behind the rest of the class."
"Overall: This is a decent double IPA that has some good flavors but overall it is not bold enough. As a DIPA it is a far cry from Lagunitas' own Hop Stoopid."
"I've enjoyed this solid beer many times. It has a good deal of hops as well as a nice citrus smell and taste. A: nice dark brown with a fair amount of lacing that doesn't last long. S: citrus/fruity smell very appealing. M: thick full feel, flows well very smooth. T: taste has slight hops and a lot of citrus very good combination and the high abv doesn't come through too strong. O: a very drinkable beer will definitely have it again Lagunitas is a solid brewery I've yet to have a bad beer from them."
"Tasty and unique, overall. I kinda view Lagunitas as the Dogfish Head of the West Coast, and this fits right in with their """off-center""" style. I'd definitely hit this again."
"O- Gotta admit that this is my go to brew when I hit this store in the mood for a hop bomb (which is often). At $9 a half-rack, I can't go wrong and I usually can't justify buying any of the $10-$11 selections. Three of these on a week night patio grill session is perfect. Then off to bed for sweet dreams..."
"I picked this one up at a grocery store, although it was refrigerated, there is no telling how long it has been there. I've had Lagunitas before and this one just tastes faded. That being said, what flavor was there was very very nice and what I look for in a DIPA. I wish Lagunitas would put a date on the bottle."
"Overall: A great offering. Complex, bitter, big."
"O - This is one if my favorite IPAs and would buy again"
"A very nice, tasty DIPA from Lagunitas. Definitely worth a try, highly recommended."
"Pours a reddish orange with a fluffy white head that dissipates after a minute or two but leaves behind a white foam on the top. Sweetish malt on the nose with some grapefruit and a bit of an herbal edge. Some alcohol on the nose as well. Slightly sweet on the palate, hops to back it up, but actually not as hop forward as I was anticipating. Medium to light bodied with a nice finely wound carbonation."
"Coming in at 8.2 is even higher than youd expect, the alcohol is WELL blended. Very nicely done, It says its a limited release, i hope i see it again."
"Nice copper look to the pour, but head dissipates rather quickly. Nice aroma of hops to it, but not overwhelming. Taste is malty with melon undertones and a hint of Coriander (??) Coats your mouth on the way down, leaves with a malty taste. Some may think its too malty, I prefer a tad bit less malts. Decent strong beer, but alcohol is masked by flavor of malts. Overall pretty decent beer!"
"Overall - not too big on this malty aftertaste, etc. but it was worth a try! the carbonation is more than i prefer"
"The CPJ"
"Pours a nice dark copper color with an okay head which quickly dissipates, but leaves a nice lacing. The smell is mostly of hops and some malts. Feel is medium, I actually more sweetness on the tongue than bitter hops. The taste is far sweeter than expected and I'm not sure if the beer is older but the hops aren't very predominate, I get a load of malty sweetness, the after taste is a little grapefruit hops which is nice and it lingers for a while. This is pretty standard for the IIPA, a good beer but I think I'm starting to prefer regular IPAs which don't have the extra malts."
"O - After getting home on a hot, humid and awful day at work. This beer was the answer to my prayers. It was incredibly refreshing and the alcohol was well masked by the great taste."
"An above average DIPA. I've certainly had far, far worse. This one is just far too sweet and one dimensional--a surprising miss from the brewers that make Hop Stoopid."
"Overall - Loved it! This is exactly how I like my IPA/DIPA's to taste. It's packed full of flavour and the alcohol is very well hidden. It's got lots of fruit juiciness that leaves me wanting to take my next sip as soon as I've finished the last. I'll buy more of this for sure."
"Overall I am really enjoying this. Not the greatest representation of the style but an easy to acquire one. I have had this in the past and remembered it to be brighter and have more of a bitter wallop. I have no idea how old this bottle is so maybe that explains the taste difference. Very enjoyable though!!"
"Overall- this wasn't the freshest bottle of Maximus I have ever had but I still enjoyed it. Lagunitas beers are always a safe bet and a great value but I think the name Maximus sets people up to expect a hoppy bomb and it doesn't fit the profile of this beer."
"O: A great beer, I honestly can not find any flaws. Love it."
"M: nice carbonation and matching my taste forma DIPA. Somewhat a bit thin. No domination of the hops. Malt is well present and certaintly tampering down the hops caracter of this brew. Not too malty though witch I like and give this DIPA a look of an IPA. Pleasant!"
"Is this hoppier when fresh?"
"I not a huge ipa person although now that summer is here they taste much better. For me lagunitas is one of the best at using hops but balancing it out nicely with some sweetest at the start. This beer is the same way it has the sweetest at the start then the bitterness kicks in in full flavor. But since the next sip you get sweetest at the start it doesnt make you cottonmouth halfway threw. Like some dipa or ipa might have. Drank it in a glass by bonfire so didnt notice the color to much but its the taste that matters anyways. If u like sippin ale or undercover or brown sugar u will like this one."
"O - Very solid DIPA. So easy to drink and very refreshing. A favorite"
"Overall: This has climbed to the top as one of my favorite IPAs. Delicious. Will definitely being purchasing many times over in the future."
"O: I really enjoyed this. More than an IPA but not as much alcohol or in-your-faceness as some bigger DIPA's. I'll have this one in the fridge all the time!"
"Crisp, nicely carbonated, and smooth. Overall an interesting and enjoyable beer."
"O- A pretty good DIPA and another solid beer from Lagunitas."
"O - I'm generally a fan of Lagunitas beers and this is no exception. This probably won't knock your socks off, but doesn't disappoint either. A very solid, if not memorable DIPA. One to buy a sixer and throw it in the fridge for casual daily drinking. Not likely to become a staple in my fridge, but one worth revisiting every now and then."
"Enjoy!"
"Lagunitas hits a triple with this one, nearly knocking it out of the park."
"More citrussy hops abound here as well, with a refreshing aftertaste sticking in the throat."
"I really like this beer. My only regret is that now my next shopping list just got one beer longer."
"O: Excellent DIPA. Considerably less expensive than PTE so I purchase this one a bit more often. Regardless of price however; I would still pick this one up."
"Had this right out of the bottle. 12 oz. So as expected the look rating is a bit skewed. I went right in the middle at average. The smell was pretty good right out front. Lots of citrus and hops. Slightly carbonated. Feels bubbly on the tongue. Nice overall. Has a bit of a strange after taste. Would get a bit old after awhile. Ive got to say through is that the ABV is hidden well, I wouldn't have guessed as to 8%. Overall nice."
"puored into a tulip glass. The color is beautiful, a copper orage with a small off-white head and lacing that sticks to the sides. Aroma is very sweet, just a touch of piney-ness to it (not sure how old this bottle is). I've had aquite a few of these but this one I'm reviewing seems to have lost some of it's zine. It's really sweet, not much bitterness to it."
"Have had this beer many times but finally have some time to review it. To get a decent head you have to get aggressive with the pour but when done right the look of the beer is excellent. Smell is soapy then sweet and finally piney, smells like it is gonna be spectacular. The taste is exactly like the nose with a hint of citrus that is not noticeable in the scent only not as forward as you would expect. It's a bit less powerful than the smell suggests but I really like this beer as I have returned to it many times. I would rate the beer higher if it was classified as a a regular IPA but it need a bit more to be concidered a DIPA. Regardleas most of lagunitas stuff is A or higher IMO."
"Overall, enjoyable but not notable. I expected more from the taste after the scent, but it is a good beer regardless."
"O: I really like double IPAs and this is no exception. Not the best of them though. Still, would like to have again."
"Overall, this isn't the most exciting DIPA I've ever had, but it is smooth and well-balanced and very good all around. This, plus its availability, make it a good go-to beer when you really just want a nice and easy DIPA."
"Overall: This is a regular in my fridge and it will probably always be. I'm a huge fan of ruby red grapefruit juice and if I ever want to get drunk off of it, I'll just reach for this. Again, Lagunitas doesn't disappoint."
"very similar to lagunitas' regular IPA, but i do enjoy this one quite a bit more. this is a crazy-drinkable IIPA, and great taste-for-the-buck as usual with lagunitas."
"This beer struck me as kind of sweet. It is very drinkable; the hops did not overpower me. It does not have too much carbonation.It has a good clean finish. The alcohol is masked by the sweetness and hops. It is less intense than one might anticipate a double ipa to be. One gripe I have with Lagunitas is that all of their beers taste the same; this is like a slightly less intense Brown Shugga. I probably wouldn't buy this again; however, I wouldn't avoid it either"
"O - This one confounds me a bit. Looks lighter than my idea of a DIPA, nose is fainter, taste really surprised me too. I'm all over the place with this but all in all, solid. Not great, solid."
"A straightforward clean/filtered IPA with a nice balance."
"Overall. Great dipa. Easy drinker. Maybe too easy for the abv."
"Overall, a good but not great ADIPA for me. Do recommend though as it's a worthy player in the field and I really like Lagunitas. Avail here in TX. Rotation - bought a 6 pack this time but probably wouldn't do that again. However, I would put in the ADIPA mix 6 rotation. [O;O]"
"O: Balanced IPA that is pleasant on tap, though might seem a tad too syrupy."
"Pours a copperish amber. Aroma strong of malt sweetness and citrus hops. In the flavor, barleywine style malt body with alot of syrupy sweetness. Grapefruity hops with a hint of pine, solidly bitter but finishes alittle sweet. Syrupy feel with alittle booze in the finish. Overall, a solid double IPA good go to beer in a pinch."
"If you are into more malty less hoppy IPA styles, you might enjoy giving it a whirl."
"O: This is another solid brew from Lagunitas. Seems like almost everything I try from them is delicious. Good work boys!"
"O: Yeah, for a high ABV IPA / DIPA? Not so much. Enjoyable for what I had, though I was expecting much, much more."
"O: I enjoy it, and I'll pick it up again as a fairly priced DIPA sixer. But I won't rank it as a great of the style."
"Overall I do enjoy this beer, its nothing over the top but def something that can be a regular go to in the fridge."
"O- Once again, a very nice beer from Lagunitas. Solid flavors, but the aroma was a big miss for them (even though better than some beers I've had). The flavors, although good, were a little meek, and not as bold as I would've expected. Not sure if this really is a DIPA though."
"Nice copper pour with a half-finger head that leaves an ok lace throughout. The hop aroma is apparent as well as well as some candyish sweetness. The taste is a pretty nice citrus hoppiness with a sticky malt sweetness. The hop flavor is pretty basic not a whole lot of depth and/or variation. The mouthfeel is sticky and a little slick. I really can't stand a slick on my pallet. The slickness detracts from any potential for crispness and """refreshing or quenching""" attributes. Overall this is a good flavored and bodied brew with a slick mouthfeel."
"O-Overall a decent DIPA. Not great, but very good. Would definitely reach for this again."
"overall, not a bad brew. I have had so many DIPAs that you really have to stand out for me to rate you high and this one doesnt really jump out at me. Good price for a sixer (about $9-10) so its not bad. Some of Lagunitas specialty DIPAs have seemed better than this one, but its a very drinkable malty DIPA"
"O: I expected a bit more from Lagunitas.. maybe a bit too balanced for an DIPA."
"Pours out a dark orange with a thin white head that does not have much retention or lacing. Has moderate carbonation. The smell consists of floral hops, some pungent earthy hops, and a hint of citrus. The taste starts out with a grassy pine taste that follows with a grapefruit taste and finishes off with floral hops. This beer has a nice smooth creamy mouth feel that makes it easy to drink. Overall, a decent DIPA that is worth a try since it is a nice flavorful well balanced brew."
"A good double IPA. A bit more malt forward than I’d prefer but still a solid and enjoyable double IPA."
"O: Nothing bad, just average in most every way which is not what I expect from Lagunitas beers. Typically they hit the spot. This one, I'm not sure I'll go back for it. Plenty of other DIPAs that I prefer to retry before this one."
"Drunkability: Sitting at 8.2 I believe this brew would get me drunk pretty quick. It tastes decent, nothing special, but decent."
"Overall - This beer is pretty drinkable which is a little scary considering it's alcohol content. It holds up to many other IPAs that I've had and I would come back to this in a heartbeat."
"Slightly more bitter than I had expected but one needs to remember it's a double IPA .. very easy drinking considering it's 8.2% .. high quality, like all other Lagunitas beers I have drunk over the years. Highly recommended (I enjoyed it with ribs)"
"if anything this beer is a tad over the top, VERY bitter sweet and boosey all at the same time. NOT A TIMID BEER. LAGUNITAS! #1 workhorse CALI brewery."
"I wouldn't normally review a near year old beer, but it still held true. I'm really curious as to how this would taste fresh now."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall it was a very nice beer. The sweetness really went well with the juicy hops. Very easy drinking and flavorful beer overall."
"Ending notes: Overall, this is one of my personal favorites. Definitely not for the faint-hearted. Very representative of the DIPA style. Every time I see this on the shelves I have to grab a six-pack. I would definitely recommend this beer."
"The taste is of their I.P.A. with a little extra. Little more sweetness, little more bitter, little more alcohol and a little more hops. Pretty good overall. I would say it's in the middle of the I.P.A. and the hop stoopid."
"O- A very good sweet and malty DIPA with an assertive hop bite on the finish."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Nice creamy head with amazing retention and excellent lacing. Clear and lighter cooper in color. Smell is a nice blend of citrusy hops along with a bit of sweet malt. The hops are definitely dominant though with that west coast grapefruit and pineapple smell. Taste was good but a little bland i thought. I know this sounds weird to be a complaint but I thought it was a little too balanced. Was hoping for more hops but maybe thats what Hop Stoopid is for. Mouthfeel was nice, very smooth and velvety. Overall a good beer. Probably not my favorite of theirs but nothing that i wouldn't drink again."
"O- This would be a good starter IPA for someone. It has all of the flavors, but they are mild and non-bitter."
"Aroma fills the room with a balance of both pine and citrus hops. The taste is the same, but more intense. Speaking for both taste and aroma, there are few other flavors other than an excellent hop profile and slightly pale malt backbone. Sweet yet pale malts invade the palate and stick around for a long time. I can't stay much more. You CANNOT resist sipping....this IPA is super tasty and finishes quickly."
"I saw this beer was 72 IBU's and didn't honestly figure on it being all that hoppy, but this is definitely a player. It isn't ridiculously hoppy and unbalanced, but it also isn't a DIPA that has a very strong malt base either. I'd say it straddles the line a bit between the two."
"Drinkability: What's not to love? I mean, other than the fact that this is harder to find in stores in my area than the standard Lagunitas IPA. This one is a winner!"
"Overall: It's good, but I'd like to try one that I'm sure is fresher to see if a re-review is in order. The mouthfeel is easily the best aspect of this one, just spot on. The ABV and sweetness (in its present condition) would limit it a bit."
"Overall: Not sure how this fits into the DIPA category. Maximus is much tamer than many standard IPAs I have tasted. Not bad, per se, just tame."
"Pours a syrupy honey color with penicil thin head, some lacing and visible bubbles rising to the top of the snifter from the carbonation. The smell is piney, yet citrusy, with notes of grapefruit and some cinnamon following the malt backbone. The taste is hoppy, but I definitly cant tell this beer is clocking in at 72.41 IBUS as the malt sweetness balances the hops out nicely making for a smotth taste with some bite. The alcohol is not apparent in the taste either, and makes this beer dangerously drinkable. For such a large beer, the mouthfeel is pleasently smooth and balanced with a slight lingering hop bitterness upon termination. Overall, I am very pleased with this offering. Great example of a double IPA. I always seem to be pleased with the offerings from lagunitas."
"Lagunitas lavishly hop all their beers as if they have an axe to grind with every brewer who doesn't. With a lineup that includes not only Maximus but New Dogtown Pale, Censored, IPA, Little Sumpin' Sumpin' and Hop Stoopid (as just the year-round brands!!!) it's no surprise we've been experiencing hop shortages. Now that they're America's 17th largest brewery (by volume, as of 2011), I'll bet we can expect to see lots more."
"Recommend, but make sure fresh."
"Overall- A fairly average DIPA for me. The hop flavor is there, it is just a bit to over the top bitter per my tastes. Not bad, I would drink it again if offered, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again. I do prefer Hop Stoopid to this one."
"Poured a dark amber/copper color with a two finger head on it and great lacing. Nice light hop aroma although I thought it would be stronger. Taste is very good, again I thought the hops would be more intense. It's a very very good tasting beer though. Light-medium body and went down smooth and easy. I enjoyed this beer and would definitely purchase again."
"Prost!!!"
"O: Love this one. Definate winner!"
"Pours a dark honey color with a small 1/2 inch bone colored head that fades to a tiny cap. Nicely formed distinct rings of lacing on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt, honey, and citrus/floral hops. Taste is up front with the citrus zest hops, followed by the sweet malt and a honey aftertaste. Very mild citrus juice bitterness on the palate after each sip. Good carbonation makes for a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Hop oils can be felt in the mouth. Overall, a very good DIPA from Lagunitas."
"O: Enjoyable, but I wish it were marginally less sweet."
"Overall, this is some righteous stuff."
"Edit: Don't know if this helps but my version was 7.5% and it says 8.2% here. I guess if 8.2 is the newer batch try to avoid low ABV bottles..."
"This is a decent DIPA but not something I would pick over Hopstoopid or Little Summin Summin"
"Drinkability - Probably wouldn't want another one of these if I had the chance, its super strong, super bitter and not too exciting. Theres nothing overly bad about it however and I don't mind the bitter levels other than that they overwhelm the others."
"The taste has less alcohol and more of a sweet malt start with a good hop presence that's just a touch unbalanced. It leaves a bit of an unpleasant aftertaste. Not bad though, I should have no problem going through a six-pack in a few days."
"Thanks Bierkraft. Poured into my weeping radish 4 oz sampler. Nice rich gold color with small head and mild lacing. Ver carbonated. Thrbubbles keep coming. Smell is citrus pines and a tad hoppy. Taste is not overly cOmplex It does have the attributes o desire on a dipa. The alcohol is masked. The mouthfeel is medium nodded and effervescent. Overall a good ne'er and I will drink at least 5 mote times"
"This isn't to bad overall, I'd score it slightly better than average and you could do worse. However, I think I'd grab something else."
"Final thought - If you are a fan of the original but want more ABV, this beer is for you. Or if you just love IPA try this beer"
"D- It drinks more like an IPA, but the hops are bigger than that. One of my go to beers when I need a quick hop fix."
"OVERALL: Just like it's little brother, Lagunitas IPA, the Maximus isn't terribly complex. Instead it is just a strong, spot-on example of what an American IPA should be."
" ~ I recommend drinking this one early on. It is still good after the cellaring but I think it was better early in its life."
"O- The alcohol is decently hidden and I think that makes the drinkability good."
"For $10 a 6-pack, I don't think there is a better IPA value in California. Green Flash IPA is good but costs $9 a 4-pack. Stone IPA is somewhat wimpier, and Ranger IPA is a good deal wimpier, although both are totally respectable in their own way."
"O: Overall, this beer has a funky flavor to it that is fun and interesting, not masterful, but I still enjoy it. I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these in a row probably because it is so sweet and intense. A bit malt forward for my taste in a DIPA, but still, a worthwhile beer."
"Overall- Very good drinking IIPA. I will have to buy more of this next time I am at the store. Good thing it is easily obtainable. Does not at all taste like an 8+% beer."
"Medium to full bodied with the proper carbonation. Easy to drink with no alcohol burn present. Overall, it's a very solid IPA, not a 'huge' IPA, which makes it good for drinking anytime."
"D: Not a big fan of IPA's but this one is really tasty. Drink up!"
"D - Interesting, is is quite hoppy and while there is more than enough malt character to balance the bitterness it comes across as a bit disjointed. The pine and orange hop flavors kind of clash with each other and they just don't seem to work well with the caramel malt. It seems like the caramel is too dark to work well with the malt and it covers the hops while also bringing out their harsher qualities. I have had more than a few excellent hoppy beers from Lagunitas and was expecting more of the same from this one, which makes it all the more of a disappointment that Maximus was as unremarkable as it was. I got a six pack of it, and while the rest of the bottles won't go to waste I certainly wouldn't buy it again."
"The mouthfeel seems right for this beer, light and a tad oily. Drinkability A+, it feels close to an IPA but its noticeably bigger as well."
"Lagunitas Maximus is now my standard IPA 6-pack selection (3/10/11). Please comment if you feel there is a better selection based on this criteria. -Dave O."
"D - okay drinkability. this would go down a lot smoother if I didn't have to fight through the nose."
"D- I'm good on one, but enjoyed sipping on it.."
"overall this beer was pretty good. light and enjoyable given the level of alcohol."
"Drinks quite well; it's a pleasant beer. Would love to try this fresh from the brewery but even with a bit of age it's a very enjoyable drop."
"Not sure if I got a bad 6 pack from Mo Bev but the smell for some reason reminded me of a wet cat food I opened for my grandmother years ago. The color though is beautiful, a dark amber with a full head. The 8.2 alchol is usually higher than what I shoot for in a 6 pack. Not what I expected from a double/imperial level beer."
"D: I plan on re-reviewing this when I find a super fresh bottle."
"I find this quite drinkable. Maximus was one of the first DIPA's I ever had, and I frequently find myself drawn back to it when I want a flavorful, yet bitter, DIPA. Definitely recommend you try this one!"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer was a bright, clear amber-gold coloring with about a one inch foamy, airy, bubbly head. Green hops and peppery notes on the nose, with some citrusy (orange and grapefruit) highlights. Creamy smooth body, the beer has a sweet malt backbone with heavy pepper and hopped overtones that hit the back of the tongue. Citrus tones again help to balance all of the flavors. Slightly sour and bitter aftertaste, with hops puckering the tip of the tongue. Lingering finish, yet still smooth. Very easy to drink, and pretty tasty on top of that."
"D. Probally the tier i would most hand to lagunitas. They always seem to make a very quaffable affordable tastey beer that encourages me to keep thinking, lagunitas will always be a great six pack purchase. Ala Gladiator!!!! Lions Tigers and... Bears? Oh My!! Thats what this beer will be making u say"
"D - For a big IPA this is pretty easy to drink its not an overpowering hop bomb but enough hops to keep everyone happy worth getting sometime to try"
"Drinkability- 4.5 out of 5. Drinkability may be this beer's saving grace. If you want to have a few DIPAs over the course of an evening instead of struggling through one more acerbic exemplar, this is the DIPA for you. Not bad by any means, but it's definitely not what I was expecting with the name and a description that claimed it would """strip the enamel""" from my teeth. This would be a good introduction to the style for someone having doubts about whether or not they can handle it. It's like a Double IPA with training wheels."
"Nice piney aroma that sets up the taste. Up front the beer is very smooth going in, malt flavors and a subtle fruit like plum. while I can smell the hops, there is not bitter bite at the end. I have been drinking some very good beers lately- this is one of the best."
"Overall this is a great beer and even though it is a big one I will have no problem finishing this bomber"
"Pours an almost-clear, light amber color with a medium white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is hoppy with a lot of citrus and some caramel malt. Almost a bit of cat piss as well. As the beer warms a bit, I get a lot of sweet malt in the nose. Taste is not what I was expecting... Considering this is a west coast IPA, I was expecting more hops and more pine notes...but I get a lot of citrus and malt. I get grapefruit and pineapple along with sweet malts. A lot of sweet malty flavors. The bitterness is not """in you face""" at all and the hops are there, but not the main attraction. I know this bottle isn't very old either... Mouthfeel is a bit syrupy and full-bodied. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is a very tasty beer. I was just expecting something a little more hoppy and bitter. Alcohol is very well hidden."
"The mouthfeel is solid, it's smooth and medium-bodied. The drinkability is exceptional, this goes down super smoothly and doesn't feel anywhere near 8.2%. Another great beer from Lagunitas, they sure know their hops."
"Delicious and extremely drinkable. Definitely stronger, but not just a fortified version of their IPA, Lagunitas Maximus shows different malt and hop character in both the flavor and aroma."
"D- Overall this was a decent brew but I really want to know how fresh my bottle is! I do see a bottle code but I'm unsure on how to interpret it: 29375014."
"D: Yes, could use another."
"D: A pretty good DIPA. This isn't anything super-complex, but is solid on the fundamentals."
"Sticky finish that lingers on the tongue. Drinkability is decent, nothing incredible for the style, but still solid. Lagunitas cranks out affordable, good beers and I laud them for that."
"Drinkability: The balanced carbonation and bright up-front hoppiness make this a very pleasant brew. The sweetness was a little unconventional, but the other flavors started to shine more as the beer warmed up a little. I'd definitely drink it again."
"Drinkability: Based on the candy-like sweetness, I was going to post lower scores, but after warming a little, the sweetness dies off a little, probably because the sweetness strangely resides more with the hops than the malts. After some warming, it is a nicely balanced, enjoyable beer, but still not quite what I want in a DIPA."
"It's a nicely balanced beer, and the 7.5% is well hidden, although 7.5% isn't necessarily that strong for an IPA, let alone for a double IPA. It's a decent brew all up, though."
"I can tell this is pretty fresh too so definitely buy this fresh and warm it up for about 5 or 10 minutes out of the fridge to get that hop bitterness this is capable of. When its too cold you can taste the alcohol a bit and the bitterness is kind of subdued from the coldness. This beer warmed just a tad is amazing. Sweet thick malts mix in with the tropical, grapefruit, flowery and fruity loop type hops. I'm glad the store next to me just started offering this so I know it'll be fresh for a couple months now. Definitely get this beer if you like Double IPA's its fantastic."
"Overall- All together Lagunitas Maximus is a very hoppy beer with a light body and tons of flavor. Its not super complex or lighting the world on fire by any means but it is reasonably priced great tasting beer that can for sure scratch away your 'itchin for hops. Also at 7.5% abv this is for sure one of the more drinkable DIPAS. An excellent choice from Lagunitas."
"This one has some opening balance before being blasted by pine flavors. the alcohol isn't pronouced but the texture fits the whole package. This isn't particularly distinctive but it tastes good and is spot on for the style if not a hop monster. Almost sessionable for a DIPA, for what its worth."
"Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow with a minimal head. A nice aroma of hops (pine and citrus) is complemented very well a great balance on the taste. The """double""" is definitely there but isn't overpowering. Hits your tongue and dances around a bit, but quickly leaves and you need to replenish. A 6-pack is expensive in BC, but this may now be my go-to IPA."
"D: Good balance between malts and hops. The name would imply an overly hoppy beer for an IPA, but hop bitterness is by no means overwhelming. Very enjoyable!"
"D - Goes down easy and is very tasty. Easy to drink and no boozyness, not that I'd expect any at this ABV. Could have a few in a night and it wouldn't get old."
"D- This beer is a well crafted IPA. It might be my favorite out of most of the things that Lagunitas does. ABV is well hidden which makes this a little dangerous but I could enjoy this beer all night long while watching T.V. or hanging out with friends."
"D - I can't drink a whole lot of these but it is still very good."
"D-honestly, the IPA seems to get better as the drink goes on. I feel that the taste gets sweeter and sweeter. there's just a nice sweet after-taste that develops that'll keep you asking for more. i wouldn't mind having a case of this. it goes down easily as well."
"It's more like an IPA than DIPA, this beer kinda reminds me of Dogfish Head 60 Minutes. I was expecting aggressive hop character. Otherwise, it's a good tasting beer."
"All around, a really nice glass of beer, but truthfully if I'm only having a couple, and I want something special, I like 'em with a bit more punch."
"It has a voice as I taste, mild granny smith, bread-like malts, and a none too subtle blast of bitter sweet pine. Finishes after a time with lemony pine resin and points of sugar. Viscous and smoothe, very little distraction from the flavors."
"Big head when poured into a pint glass. Beer had a wonderful grapefruit hoppy smell. The taste wasn't quite as enjoyable, unfortunately. The sharp bitterness was nice, but the metallic flavors weren't quite as enjoyable. Bit of maltiness on the finish. Very hoppy and bitter."
"D: Bitter and piney, yes, but a little bland. Nice if you want a sour rush."
"Very drinkable will definitely have again."
"This is not the first time I've had this, but either my tastes have changed, or this bottle has started to turn. Wish there was a bottling date. I will try this again down the road to see how I feel about it then"
"Cheers!"
"I would recommend this to the IPA lover."
"I really enjoy hoppy beers so I often reach for big America IPA's and DIPA's.This was a most pleasant revisit to A DIPA I did not fully appreciate the first time around.If you like IPA's and DIPA's check this one out I find it very enjoyable.Hoppy Holidays."
"D - The drinkability of this beer is very good. This is a really good beer, and I could drink it all the time. Another fine beer by Lagunitas. Cheers."
"This is very nice on cask. Mellow, soft, and smooth. Three things I don't usually say about a Lagunitas beer. Though this is very good. I don't know what this is like on tap or bottle, but on cask this is very enjoyable."
"I noticed another reviewer used the word aspirin to describe some of the flavour in this beer and that's what it was that was bothering me with this beer. Aspirin like bitterness. Aromas are OK, more nutty and pine tha any fruit. Dry minerally, aspirin finish. Perhaps not the most balanced IIPA around. Aspirin. that's all I can think about."
"definitely an upper-echelon IPA. paired well with some chicken curry and garlic naan bread. well worth trying. i look forward to getting this again."
"D: Pretty filling, and 72IBUs tend to hit you over the head, without drying out your throat"
"Very easy to drink, especially for a DIPA."
"Beer is sweet and thick in the front and quite bitter in the back, its a little heavy, even for a DIPA. The midpalate is weak and spotty, the finish is good. Appropriately bitter and flavorful but not as good as others I've had. It is just a decent DIPA, I would have it again but without excitement."
"P.S. Despite the ABV listed here, the beer I had was 7.50. Not quite a DIPA, but definitely big for an IPA."
"Pours orange with pink hues throughout. The slight tan head leaves quickly, but find enough time to drop off some capricious lines of lace. Notes of grapefruit, orange sour apples and sweet bread at the nose. Tastes biscuity and malty up front with some light fruits and citrus in the middle and an indirect hop bitterness at the very end. Medium bodied with little carbonation as expected. Goes down a bit chalky and dry, but has a slightly creamy core. Lagunitas can do better than this, so I'm not sure why they feel the need to do another DIPA when they've already got that style down pat."
"12oz bottle purchased from Ryan's Party Store in Port Huron, Michigan. Pours a dark amber bronze with copper hues, a sliver of eggshell white head, and strands of lacing on the tulip. Smell is piny and floral hops, barley, a touch of toast, citrus fruit (lime?), liquor, butter, and toffee. Pretty standard DIPA aroma, albeit a little malt-forward. Taste follows the nose with some taffy and caramel sweetness upfront, burnt sugar, pineapple, and bubblegum mid-palate, and a grassy, citric hop bitterness to end. A small trace of acidic tartness accompanies the aftertaste. Simple flavour for the style but still very appealing. Mouthfeel is creamy-smooth, fuller than medium bodied, silky middle with a boldly bitter spiciness on the tongue and semi-dry finish. A respectable Imperial India Pale Ale, and fairly enjoyable overall, even if it's not a world beater. Worth a try if you ask me."
"Overall/notes - Not really disappointed with this one. Gosh, if I had a word for this beer, it'd be """photogenic.""" It begs to be viewed. It tastes fine, smells fine, yeah, but you should really pour a glass for yourself and gaze for a second. A good brew, and worthy of its DIPA title. Nicely done again, Lagunitas!"
"This brew pours a golden orange hue pretty much exactly like lucozade with nice carbonation that leaves a two finger head that quickly recedes to leave lots of lacing here and there,the smell is bittersweet with aromas mainly of pine needles,some orange zest and caramel fudge,it has a medium bodied mouthfeel which is perfectly carbonated and leaves tastes of citrus,stonefruit,sticky toffee,caramel and finishes with a nice bitter kick which really rounds out the sweetness and you know your drinking an ADIIPA,overall its very nice and very easy to drink but right now im so spoilt id have to say i prefer Pliny the Elder in this category but you have to try it if given the chance."
"Also, at 9.99 a six, this is a fantastic bargain compared to other DIPA on the market."
"D - At 8.2 it's not exactly sessionable but I'd put a few back. Compared to an average Australian """Double IPA""" this is the bomb. Australian brewers take note."
"D_Could drink a few of these."
"I really enjoyed this IPA, it has much of a malt backbone and does not want you to get bored at all, its grapefruit/citrus flavor is balanced well by its sweet flavor masking a bleak oaky like bittnerness i sensed. Not too hoppy for a HOPloco cervesa."
"I like the label, it says: """...of Hops, Malt, Hops, Hops, Yeast, Hops, Water, and Hops.""""
"Notes - This beer is awesome. They only thing that would hold me back from drinking this all night is the ABV%. I will buy some more of this for sure."
"D- dangerously so, prickly carbonation, alcohol is pretty well hidden, could easily have a couple of these."
"Poured a Hazy copper Orange, Foamy white head and excellent lacing along the side of the glass. Aroma is hoppy with notes of honey, grapefruit and and something else sweet. Flavor is sweet and malty up front and bitter and hoppy on the back end. Nice balance, the sweetness has a taste of fruit....Banana or Pineapple? Whatever it is I like it. I would like to try this fresh next summer, maybe it will have a more """Hop""" presence. Solid 2IPA"
"taste-Nice bold, piney hop flavor. Orange marmalade sweetness fights off the hop bitterness but overstays its welcome leaving a bit of a sweetish finish. Not bad overall, but I was expecting more of a hop-forward flavor in a DIPA. Certainly worth the bargain price,however."
"The beer feels crisp and decent-bodied. Maximus is rather smooth and easy to drink for a beer with a fun ABV."
"Served in a tulip glass. Pours a nice orange color that is just ever-so-slightly darkened by a bit of bronze. Nose is strong citrus hops with loads of orange and grapefruit. A bit of rind. The taste is quite hoppy, but doesn't hit quite the level of the nose. Nice bitter and resinous feel. Drinks quite well and is a solid DIPA."
"D: Very enjoyable. Aroma is the strength here and less so for flavor and mouthfeel, but still a very good beer. I had 3 bottles back to back."
"D: I will buy a sixer of this and would definitely order another. One of the best DIPAs I've had. Far better than I remember it being."
"Poured into a pint glass. Showed a clear amber/yellow with a thick white head. Good retention and lacing. Smell of bready malts, sweet honey and some citrus hops in the finish. Taste of citrus hops up front, balanced with some more floral hops. Not much body here, decent IPA, pretty good session brew but high alcohol for that."
"Overall, I won't buy it again. Despite Lagunitas other all-star hop bombs, this one fails to deliver in the hop-flavor department. I generally find Imp IPAs and DIPAs overly sweet, and their ABV limits drinkability. So if I'm going to enjoy and rate one highly, it's gotta have some knock-your-socks-off flavor. For me, this brew did nothing to distinguish it from the crowd."
"A quirky DIPA for sure, the malt sweetness overwhelms the hops. I'd buy a single first before getting a six pack."
"M/D: Medium bodied. Overall it was fine, but nothing special for me."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Perfectly balanced citrus hops and bready malts compete for attention on the tongue. The winner is me. Goes down very smooth for an 8.2% ABV DIPA. Not a session beer by any means, but I'll have another one of these very soon."
"A decent beer but it lacks the full-on character I expect in a DIPA."
"MD-Because the hoppiness is not overpowering, I believe that makes this beer very drinkable. For me one DIPA every so often is just fine but this is one I could heve more regularly. Lagunitas is a class act, so far I am 3 for 3 on winners from them."
"Pours a dark orange, nice white head. Aroma is ok, hoppy, pine with some citrus. Flavor is good as well, bitter pine with some sour grapefruit notes. Seems a little more bitter than some other DIPAs, but not terrible. I actually find the bitterness keeps you coming back for another sip. Another solid brew from this brewer."
"Overall this was a decent beer. What threw me off with the flavor was the barley, which I don't like tasting in a DIPA. Also, for a DIPA, this had a rather non present bitterness. I was hoping for something to atleast give my mouth some bite, but this brew lacked. In general, I'd recommend any DIPA lovers out there to try, but that's about it, don't be picking this up again."
"I really loved this brew, the scent was the only thing lacking but the rest absolutely blew me away. On a side note, this brews bottle had one of the most unique labels ive ever seen. Superb all around."
"Bright copper orange with near perfect clarity. Poured with a strong, rocky white head that left behind a rich cap and ample sticky lacings. Mellow floral and citrus hop aromas with a hint of pine and malt beneath. Smooth and pleasant feel with ample carbonation. Floral and citrus grapefruit hop flavors in the beginning with a brief taste of sweet malt. Finishes cleanly with a pine flavor that fades with a bit of alcoholic heat. Lots of complex flavors and a nice clean finish without too much bitter aftertaste. Very easy to drink."
"Overall a good brew, Hops are not as overdone as I expected, drinks clean and refreshing with nice notes of fruit and citrus sweetness and a fair malt balance. I'd buy it again, and again!"
"D - Not where this shines. Though I don't expect too much in the drinkability department when it comes to DIPAs, I definitely couldn't see downing more than 2 in a session."
"Overall: Exceptional IPA. As I have mentioned, I am stuck on this delivery of such a high hop brew. I dont care for beers that force hops such as Schlafly APA. This beer is just an exceptional beer to drink with almost any high protein meal and as a night cap."
"An extremely well hidden 7.5% ABV. So drinkable. Not one of those over-the-top IPAs but rather a well-balanced one with just the right combination of hops and sweet malt to make drinking a couple of these a pleasant chore."
"D - Drinkable & not that overbearing of an IPA, great taste that is definitely an ipa over the top. Not watered down but just right. I like most Lagunitas brews seeing the well balance and hoppiness. Would not consider this a DIPA but over the top different style of IPA. Only $7.75 at Albertsons!Thumbs up!"
"Easy to drink but the sweetness and hotness can get to be too much. Accurate to the style and a unique flavor slightly different to others of the style. I would drink this again but is not my favorite of the style."
"Poured from a 22oz bottle straight from Lagunitas into my Zatec fluted glass. Amber color with a fluffy, quickly receding two fingers of head. Not bad on the lacing, not great. Smells of pineapple, malt sweetness, Lagunitas house yeast and some light citrus and spice. Flavor is big bitterness up front and on the finish. Pretty dry for a DIPA, but a decent malt sweetness. Citrus peel, and more hops slappin my tongue. Finishes a little hot for 8.2, but not too rough."
"Overall: Good beer overall. While I guess it's technically an Imperial IPA, I consider this more of a strong IPA. It's not the best in the world but you can do much worse."
"D - This is dangerously drinkable considering the higher ABV, low bitterness and citrus taste."
"this is definetely one of the better double/imperials i have tasted. alot of them leave me with a bad after taste. this one is very smooth. the color and smell were immediately appealling to me being a huge IPA lover. alot of my previous samples of imperials have not been to my liking. i would definetely enjoy this one again. another outstanding beer by the people of Lagunitas."
"The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is not near as strong as I remembered it being. I get some pine and citrus notes, as well as a little bit of toffee. Still, it is not the big strong aroma that I remember from this beer. The flavor is similar, but more pronounced. I get some tropical fruit and pine hop notes, as well as some alcohol. There is also some toffee. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"12oz bottle. Pours a medium amber color with a small head. Lots of lacing. Nice hoppy aroma. Slight smell of pine, citrus and sweetness. Flavors of hops, bitterness and maybe apricot. Smooth bitter aftertaste. Overall a good Imperial IPA, but nothing earth-shattering."
"ahh cracked the bottle and smells...stale. You know, I am in fix, do I ding the beer cause I got a stale sample? Do I not review it at all and wait and buy another in the future? Hmm, well, I spent my well earned dough on the this premium product, buyer beware I guess, but how do I know what I am getting? No date code,...color of bottle looks good, golden yellow. Beer smells, well faintly hoppy, but has that stale hop smells dominating. What could this be like fresher, some pine, some rich malt. The taste is well, again kinda stale hops, but still some lingering hop bitters, mouthfeel is rich, and this beer is pretty strong. So what a big disappointment. I guess it isn't totally the beers fault, but then again it is...."
"Overall a tasty brew just sometimes the slight metallic flavor was distracting"
"drinkable, but definitely not amongst the best DIPAs I've had. If I want more hops than malt I could drink this, but I'd probably go for better options."
"D: Very tasty, and if you love your hops you'll be impressed with this beer."
"Maximus is a pretty dependably tasty beer and I'm completely not shocked that it belongs to Lagunitas."
"D- This is a great smelling and tasting DIPA pretty much my ultimate beer for that special session."
"I want another for sure"
"D: Pretty high considering, some would consider this a strong IPA not a double IPA. The hops finish a bit harsh, but I like it. Very enjoyable."
"D- I would rather drink this than the regular IPA. This beer has more flavor, but is still not overpowering on the hops. It is a jacked up IPA in nice balance. Like the IPA, Hop Heads will not be satisfied with this. Reach for Hop Stoopid."
"A brew for hop-heads, although not exceptionally hoppy for an American DIPA."
"Drinkability- very drinkable and enjoyable the strong point of this beer to me is its great balance as the malts and hops actually very much intermingle beautifully on your tongue, a rather enjoyable ipa (though not a dipa in my books), to me just another one in the line of very good beers i have tried in the past few months from lagunitas this brewery needs to start getting more attention for really good quality beers"
"Overall: This was a great beer that I would certainly have again. I purchased a single and though there are few beers I buy as a sixer this is one I might like to keep on hand. I will certainly keeps this on my list of DIPA to revisit."
"Amber orange in color, with a tan-to-white head with decent retention, especially for an IPA. Pleasant aromas of orange, other citrus, and some sweet malt. Malt flavors create a smooth, sweet flavor to balance slightly bitter, but not overpowering hops and citrus. I think the citrus flavors tend more toward oranges (combining with the sweet malt for an orange-creme effect), then transition in more bitter grapefruit flavors. Medium bodied, with mild carbonation. Good drinkability for the style, although that means maxing out at two bottles."
"M/D: Hops leave the tongue a bit dry. Medium body. A bit too strong and one sided for me to be very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is the last of a six pack that was in the fridge for a couple of weeks and it may have lost some hop flavor over time but I can't recall it being stronger in the 1st bottle. I would like to try this very fresh in a bottle or on tap because I bet it does have more hops but still I doubt that it's nearly as hoppy as some of my favorite IPAs &IIPAs. It's good and more than worth a try."
"Not completely floating my boat when it comes to DIPAs, but not bad."
"Overall a good beer. The balance is not really there, but certainly not a bitter bomb. The abundance of citrus hops are a treat in moderation. Glad to have tried this beer. In the future will be more of a one and done beer for me."
"Overall, this is a very nice, well rounded DIPA. It seems like it would be a good intro to the style with the bitterness being present but not overbearing and the high level of drinkability it possesses. Thumbs up!"
"It is certainly not my favorite IPA, but I can't go a summer without a few of them. They are available both in 650ml and 341ml bottles. I do love the big bottles."
"D: A very nice and tasty Double. A higher ABV makes me limit the number in a sitting, but a wonderful beer."
"Taste is low on the citrus or pine or other IPA attributes. Quite a bit of malt with a creamy finish. Good carbonation and quite drinkable. A nice twice on the IPA group."
"Gotta conference call to sit in on in 13 minutes so HURRY....pours a slighty ruddy amber with no real head at all. Almost no carbonation either, means this probably is pretty syrupy, uh oh....Something almost caustic in the nose, like paint thinner. Lots of hops also. And some skunky Mary Jane notes also. Flavor is bright and crisp, and fairly sweet without being cloying. Not sure about this one...Finish is dry and bitter in a good way, but doesn't make up for the overall problems here. Usually pretty well-priced, so if you see it maybe try it."
"Overall, quite drinkable. However, I wouldn't get another one of these, whereas I've already bought my second Hop Stoopid."
"Drink: it hides the abv very well, great high gravity summer beer really."
"D - very robust aromas and flavours, the hops flavours are very enjoyable, the higher ABV is only slightly noticable and not a problem, another great beer from Lagunitas"
"recommend to all hop lovers. Very good IPA"
" A VERY solid, VERY tasty, and VERY drinkable well crafted and balanced brew. Nothig really sticking out to mention but somestimes simple is best, never seems to dissapoint or let ya down, very nice stuff!"
"D - The alcohol is nicely hidden on this one, almost undetectable, making it extremely dangerous! Delicious flavours, nicely balanced, and goes down smooth. I really enjoyed this one and would recommend it to any hop lover."
"Overall this is a well balanced DIPA that is also not particularly interesting."
"Have had this one before and I like it better this time. Better than I remembered. Not spectacular but no slouch by any means."
"Great for the West Coast IPA fan. Intense hoppiness. Not the most drinkable as in having a few but worth a try."
"Drinkability- It was really good. Lagunitas always does really well. This is no exception."
"Easy drinker and very tasty. Going out to get a six pack now!"
"Pours a clear copper color with a moderate beige head that retains pretty well. The aroma has big piney and resiny hops upfront, along with caramel, citrus fruit, toasted bread, esters, and some alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma with citrus and piney hops upfront, along with some biscuit, fruity esters, caramel and alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium, and drinkability is good for a strong IPA. Solid IPA from Lagunitas, and at a very reasonable price. Alot of the hoppy Lagunitas beers do little to distinguish themselves but they're always tasty and inexpensive."
"This beer looks beautiful in a clear glass and smells full, hoppy, and strong. The taste is truly moreish. I deeply appreciate the full flavor, abv, and pure drinkability. The price is also good for the quality. In Virginia I can get it for about $10 for a 6pack."
"DB- The aroma got me thinking this could be one of my new favorites but the taste did not stand up to it, although it was still good. A high level of sweetness and bitterness mask what could be a great flavor and fatigue the palate. Certainly worth the money they are charging as Lagunitas always has great prices."
"Goes down easy. Alcohol is noticeable up front but really lingers in the finish."
"D-Excellent for a moderately high ABV beer."
"D - A decent west coast IPA. Does not quite pass as an imperial west coast in my opinion. Probably wouldn't get it again."
"Pours a slightly hazy orange amber with a thick, fine-bubbled, pale orange-tan head. Aroma is strongly hoppy and somewhat fruity. Strongly hoppy flavor is a little bitter and has tones of banana and apple as well as a whisper of sweetness that complements the bitterness rather than fighting it. Texture is smooth, edgy and tingly."
"D - I would drink this beer again, if I can find it that is, got the last 6 pack at my local central market."
"At The Blind Tiger in NYC. Poured copper-amber with expectedly no carbonation, but no head. Smelled very piney with grapefruit and some menthol. The taste revealed a big macintosh apple flavor, with menthol, grapefruit, biscuit, and a dry finish mixed with alcohol burn. The aftertaste was abundant in alcohol burn and dry bitter orange peel. Medium and smooth (no carbonation due to the cask). Nice-tasting ipa, but a little too much alcohol burn for my taste."
"This is drinkable for its ABV but a touch malt heavy. Perhaps this was an old bottle."
"Pours a clear light amber with good off white head retention. Smells of strong spicy & pineapple like hops. Malt aroma only slightly present in a caramel like sweetness. This one is dry hopped quite nicely, but I feel like the hop to malt balance is off. Wish there was a better malt profile. For a DIPA, I thought this one would be bigger & bolder; actually I'm surprised this isn't just a regular IPA. Good nonetheless. I'll come back to this one some more."
"Somewhat syrupy medium-bodied mouthfeel. Overall this could be a great beer, but as is it is surprisingly unremarkable. Maybe my San Diego upbringing has spoiled me when it comes to DIPAs, but this one could definitely use more hops."
"D: Not bad, not bad. I was somewhat disappointed on the last few beers I've had, but this one is quite good. A nice balance between malts and hops. One of the more pleasant IPA's, wouldn't quite match up with other big DIPA's though."
"I still prefer their regular IPA. So tasty and sessionable, while Lag. IPA is great,this Imperial IPA is nice once in a while to break up the monotony. If you have the craving for this style you are safe with this brew, though I prefer something alittle more adventurous like Green Flash or Pliny."
"Aroma is prdominantly hoppy, fresh. Taste is the same. There are slight notes of caramel, bread for malts but the hops in this beer are epic, not overpowering but dominant and, more importantly, fresh, flowery, and bitter--candidly, this is the first I've had of this and I will be having many, many more."
"The body is a bit fuller than average and drinkability is OK, but not special. Overall, a decent but unspectacular example of the style."
"A very enjoyable ipa with a respectable abv. This is definitely one of the top few beers in Lagunitas's lineup."
"D-This is a good drinking beer, and I would buy it again. Lagunitas never fails to please."
"D: This is a nice IIPA that doesn't fit the grapefruit bomb that I've come to expect from this style. It was a welcome change. A nice beer I'm glad I picked up."
"Taste - Nice bite of an IPA, fairly strong at the entire back of the palate."
"Feel spot on with the carbonation. Great stuff. Good drinkability despite the high alcohol content."
"Poured from 12oz. bottle (no bottle date) into Sam Adams perfect pint. Golden, orange/reddish color with good carbonation and good head retention. Very nice citrus hop aroma. Very good citrusy hop flavor with a hint of carmel in the backround. Medium bodied with a little creaminess to it. Not a bad IPA w/ a high ABV."
"This is a beer that makes me take a deep breath in and out after a sip. It does a lot of really interesting things to my taste buds. It is a bit heavy, both in overall feel and alcohol content, so (for me at least) this is less of a session beer and more of something to slowly enjoy as a single glass (with or without a meal)."
"There is nothing to complain about with this beer. Nicely priced ($7.99/6-pack). And a good value."
"D - As this beer warms the alcohol becomes more pronounced, making it less drinkable, which seems typical for the style. That being said I would probable only enjoy 1, maybe 2 bottles of it before I got tired of the alcoholic presence, and the sugary flavor profile. Nice flavor & smell, I would prefer less sugary/candied combo though, I'd pass for a more bitter/sappy DIPA."
"This is an interesting IPA to say the least. Coming in at 7.5% ABV, it's surprisingly drinkable. With all the amazing varieties of IPAs out there, i couldn't say this would be one to re-buy but definitely holds it's own against the competition."
"I prefer the New Dog Town to this but I'm sure if it were more fresh, this would be an amazing brew."
"Drinkability: The hop flavor is round and robust, making it a very drinkable brew."
"D- maximus is another good example of a hopped up brew. The craftsmanship that goes behind a Cali DIPA is probably under appreciated. This brew excels in that example. Again, I want to reiterate that the sweetness does pull away from the desired bitterness. However, this is a great brew and I still highly recommend it"
"Notes: Lagunitas typically does some of the most fantastic and underrated hoppy concoctions, cheap and rich... This is one of them although it feels a bit less accomplished. Maybe I´m spoiled by their big bottles. Nice brew in any case."
"Drinkability: This to me is a middle of the road imperial IPA. A drinkable beer, but I have had better in the style. Not one to turn down, but not one to seek as well."
"Just tried one of these at a party. Orange, copper in color with light to moderate lacing. Hoppy smell and taste with some citrus notes thrown in there as well. Excellent mouthfeel for an IPA--just the right amount of carbonation. Very drinkable, especially in warmer weather. Would definitely seek out again."
"pours a transparent orange-copper color with very light carbonation. aleats a half inch of off white head with some good lacing. pretty light hoppy smell and light hoppy and bitter taste. not nearly what i was expecting. good beer but did not live up to my expectations, none the less very good and very drinkable."
"D - This is a good DIPA but not one I would seek out down the road."
"Gentle pour into a Unibroue tulip glass. A small head that leaves a thin layer of suds behind. A little bit of lacing but not much. Color is a clear lighter shade of orange. The smell isn't as hoppy as I'd expect. A little more on the malty side for sure. Still, the hops are there. I smell sweet malt, pine, and a bit of citrus. The taste is much the same. Starts off malty, with grass coming in once the malt settles down. A pretty good bitter aftertaste. Not a lot of stick in the mouth and drinks pretty easy. All in all it's a decent beer."
"EDIT: Picked up a six-pack in PDX. A bit maltier, but more drinkable than I remembered..and the ABV is now listed at 8.2%."
"Overall, This should be under the American IPA category, not Double IPA. Maximus is an IPA that holds to the sweet side and less of the hop forward. Don't be decieved like I was by the name in expecting this one to be """maximusly""" hoppy. It is, however, one of the more drinkable AIPA I have run across."
"Even though this beer is hop-forward, it has a nice level of balance to it. This helps it maintain a nice level of drinkability."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a goblet, interrupted by the amazing aroma of citrus and floral notes billowing from the glass. The color is a light tan, almost copper, beautiful to be honest. There's a small layer of foam, but it fades quickly, the lacing however is heavy, almost artful. There's not denying that the aroma on this brew is wonderful. Citrus, berry and floral notes are dominant througout. Taste is wonderful as well. A slight bitter bite surrounded by an otherwise smooth and elegant hop profile. Love this one, another winner from Petaluma's finest."
"It poured a orange copper with no head. It smelled of grapefruit, grass and sweet juicy hops. It tasted like bitter grapefruit peel, hint of sweet malt, hops and very wet. It was not too bitter at all."
"Lots of variation in these, but probably not because of anything Lagunitas did wrong."
"Drinkablility is good but if your looking for a hop-bomb DIPA look elsewhere. Price point is also nice as with all Lagunitas products."
"Overall, a Hophead delight."
"D: Drinkability was surprisingly smooth for such a full flavored bite."
"The body was good and full. The feel was good thick and chewy and had a nice crisp dryness to it. It isn't the greatest out there, but it's worth a try for a hophead."
"Interesting film noir-esque anecdote on the bottle. I hope the narrator wasn't expecting a particularly hoppy beer."
"As I am a bit of a sugar junkie, I'm a sucker for a sweet beer. However, I do miss that quintessential hop bitterness that should come with a DIPA."
"Libation: Drinkable? Yes. Overall, Maximus satisfies my hop tooth, but I'm not sure if this is a full bore DIPA. I've had IPAs that compare to the hoppiness here (Great Lakes' Commodore Perry comes to mind), but that's not what my main concern is. I must admit I'm not all that concerned about a """weaker""" DIPA as long as the flavor delivers, and unfortunately, the flavor is a bit too one dimensional to be truly great. This is a decent DIPA, but if you are looking for an IPA/DIPA from Lagunitas, go for their Hop Stoopid or the IPA. I guess 2 out of three ain't bad."
"D: Living in the desert southwest, temps hover around 114* in the summer, this brew will quench your thirst. But the bitterness will catch-up in the end."
"-Bye"
"Drinkability: quite drinkable. The flavor and bitterness are not in-your-face, though it's clear you're drinking a DIPA. I find it quite refreshing."
"D – I prefer this to Lagunitas' Hop Stoopid. Pretty nice DIPA"
"This beer is a full bodied kick of malt and hops in perfect balance. Caramel and grapefruit flesh working together like liquid candy, so full and slick and oily, with the same tropical fruit tastes found in the aroma totally rocking things here, with a grapefruit and pine bitterness, all with a little kick of spice in the finish and some children's aspirin (or whatever those little pink pills my mom gave me when I was a kid were) along for the ride that, while not terrible, I could do without. Still, despite that odd aspirin like chalkiness it's not overly bitter and has a strong caramel backbone which really works for me."
"Pours a clear golden-amber color with a slight white head. Aroma is very present, grapefruit/citrus and hops. Flavor is a very fruity, with tart hops and some grapefruit notes. Maximus finishes with a fruity flavor and a hoppy aftertaste. One of the fruitiest IPA's I've had, and I mean that in a good way. This is a very complex brew, something I'd recommend without hesitation."
"Very good! I have a son named Maximus, so I had to try this. It was my first purchase from Lagunitas and I'm impressed! Very hoppy, but still a bit sweet. Not overpowering, but just strong enough. Not too expensive either. Gotta love the creative label as well. I highly recommend this."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0912-DanM"
"Drinkable as far as a double goes! An excellent brew."
"drinkability: it was an alright beer. solid ipa. the pale ale was actually stonger on the hips flaavor, maybe they'll do this one too"
"I will not pursue Maximus again. I prefer a Hop Stoopid or Hairy Eyeball from Lagunitas any day!"
"Overall this came off as one of the more balanced IPA/DIPA/Imperial Reds from Lagunitas. I have to say I like the unbalanced ones a bit more but this is still worth a shot."
"This beer got better with every sip until the when it got a little too sweet. Overall, this was a nice change in IPA's I've had. I would glasy have it again!"
"Overall it seems more like an East Coast IPA, slightly maltier, and in turn, slightly better balanced. Good not great."
"I'm a big fan of this one. Very hoppy, balanced IPA. This is more an IPA rather than a DIPA to me. Nice head and lace! Citrus notes and very hoppy. Grapefruit, orange, pine, resin. Caramel is noticeable; slight amount of malt. Goes down smooth w/ nice drinkability. Lagunitas really comes through w/ this one. Recommended to anyone who likes a nice IPA."
"D - It's too sweet and soapy to have more than one of these in a single sitting."
"As they say on Sportscenter- a """restaurant quality""" IPA at a very good price. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this beer to American IPA afficionados across the globe."
"Good bang-for-your buck with this brew. Not the first time I've bought it and certainly won't be the last."
"D: I'll sit out the next round. The total lack of hops even for a regular IPA and the soapy taste really disappointed me. (I love the regular Lagunitas IPA, go figure)"
"I had out a 12 ounce bottle. IPA's are probably my favorite and this is an outstanding go at it. It's very crisp, and it's a very balanced beer. This has a nice fruitiness to it. Kind of apple-pearish. About as well balanced an IPA as I've had in a long time. Tastes don't get lost, it doesn't go overboard."
"D- Though not one of the best beers i've had, I could see myself buying this again. ABV is at a pretty good level to be able to have just a few and be happy."
"D: The soapiness di get to me a little bit but otherwise an enjoyable beer"
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a nice orange glowy color with a 2 finger white head that settles to nearly nothing. The color is deep and nontransparent. The nose is very fruity and citrus with a little floral hops. The taste is fresh and clean with a lot of citrus (orange, lime) in the front and a mild balanced bitter finish. This is a more relaxed IPA. Very clean and crisp. I would recommend to someone just starting the style, as not to over the top bitter, but a nice flavor."
"It is a very good DIPA, however, the lingering hop astringency/imbalance keeps it from being excellent."
"D - Higher ABv but not too crazy, might be overpowering on the dryness and citrus hops. Still very delicious."
"Drinkability: A pretty wild beer for an IPA at 7.5% that's been sitting for at least three years. I was pretty nervous, and I imagine this is great fresh (like almost all the Lagunitas stuff I've ever had), and it's a cool experiment to see what kind of bizarre things happen with the yeast, dissipating hops, and malt presence becoming stronger. If you can save a bottle, try it, but I'm going to try another fresh when I can."
"D-very solid imperial ipa, the nose was somewhat misleading with lots of malt, the taste had some balance but really brought hops in a nice and big way. I love lagunitas and they have one of the coolest brew pubs out there!"
"Poured into pint glass. Light amber tint with about a 1/4 inch head. Intricate lacing throughout glass. Sweet piney grapefruit aroma but not as hop-prevalent as I expected. Wonderful flavors of an IPA with sweet aftertaste, which is indicative of a Lagunitas brew. Hops come out in the initial touch to tongue but move towards sweetness- very little if any bitter aftertastes. I love Lagunitas, but this does not have the domination of hop bitterness over sweetness to be considered a DIPA. Low to average carbonation and slickly drinkable."
"Thin on the tongue, medium carbonated for the style, and mouth coating. As far as wanting another bottle, I could last a while and not have any cravings for this one."
"Has a grassy aroma, a little earthy with a mild citrus. It pours beutifully, with a thick head that settles down, clear, copper/orange color. Nothing outstanding with the flavor, aboot a normal IPA, a little grassy. Bitter on the palate and finishes with th grassy flavor. Overall, it is not one of my favorite IPA's, but not bad."
"Good balance of carbonation and sweetness. The most bit hoppy that sticks to your mouth for some time. End of the glass turned real sweet, citrus? Forefront signs of piney bitterness. Would prefer the lil' sumpins over this ale, but this is a """try it""" class beer."
"Offers a decent feel given that the light carbonation fits the oily feel of the beer. In the end a bit too malty in a bland sense for my tastes as I would prefer the 'unbalanced' Hop Stoopid any time, yet decent nonetheless."
"Got this one in trade from farrago. Poured into my Xmas in July Winking Lizard Collectors Snifter. Poured a amber color with two fingers of head. Smells sweet with heavy malt sweetness and little citrus and pine. Taste was about average for an DIPA with little alcohol burn/taste. Pretty sweet overall could use more hop kick. Mouthfeel was a disappointment. The nice lacing and sticky head disolved quickly and there was little to no carbonation in my serving. Drinkability is good overall but for the money I would go with New Holland Imperial Hatter, Stone Ruination, or ST Unearthly."
"This is my default Lagunitas beer, simply due to availability. Then again, there is the taste. It's good. Deep amber/orange color. Yummy citrusy hops with some pine thrown in the mix. There's also a hint of sweetness. A few earlier reviews seemed to indicate that this may be too sweet and hoppy. I'd like to recommend Lagunitas IPA to those folks."
"A little syrupy medium body, and the carb levels make it a smooth beer. Would buy it again"
"Still a nice beer. Doesn't strike me as quite a DIPA, maybe a 1.5 IPA."
"Cheers!"
"D: Drinks pretty easy for a double IPA. The strong hop bitterness and ABV may put off some people, but such is the nature of the style."
"This beer was recommended to me as one to tide me over until more HopSlam comes available. The beer buyer said they were similar in flavor, so I decided to give it a try. I was not impressesed, and I think it's miscategorized. It tasted much more like an Amber than an IPA (much less a Double or Imperial IPA), and I was so turned off by the amount of malt flavor present. There was almost zero hop flavor. It poured well and has a good appearance and mouthfeel, but for me, that was about it. If I was expecting (or looking forward to) an Amber, then maybe I'd review differently. But I don't like that style, so I won't be having it again."
"All in all this one isn't so bad. On the one hand I have definitely had much better DIPA's. However on the other in a beer world where DIPA's frequently come in $10 bombers there is something to be said for one the comes in a reasonably priced six pack. For the money a good value for a hop fix."
"Mouthfeel is very chewy and nicely carbonated."
"Drinkability: very drinkable DIPA. it doesn't have the alcohol bite like some DIPA's, so this beer could sneak up on you quickly."
"D- Overall not a bad offering but I was expecting a bit more form this one. Still not bad and pretty drinkable for the abv."
"Drinkability is average, not great not terrible. Definitely a worthy DIPA."
"D - Decent session beer but this beer hides the 7.5% ABV pretty well so be aware."
"A: Loads of sea foam froth that clings to the side of the glass, a deep golden brown color - 4.50, S: A solid blast of citrusy and piney hops with the slightest hint of bubblegum, light and inviting aroma, I catch smells that remind me of Centennial hops - 4.00, T: Hops step to the plate though to a lesser degree than I'd expect from a double IPA, grapefruit rind and slight pine, pitted fruit sweetness - such as apricot, malts are evident but basically lost in the hops - 4.00, M: Somewhat sticky and resiny - 3.75, D: A very drinkable beer that I will drink again - 4.25"
"Its a coin flip between this at 20$ for 6 or the 90minute from dogfish head at 17$ for a 4 pack. tonight Maximus is worth every penny for killing my hop craving"
"For all its complexity, I am happy to stick to this beer all evening. It is flavorful, not too heavy, cleanses your palate well, but steps back when you take another bite of food, so it goes with pretty much any dish I've had with it, especially Thai or other spicy fare. Highly recommended."
"Middle of the pack for me; I personally prefer the oracle from Bell's."
"Pours a clear, light copper with a tiny white head and a terrific nose: a rush of tangy candy aromas, favoring the sweet, caramel-covered apple end of the spectrum. The taste is only slightly less exciting. Flavors a sugary malts and an apple-skin bitterness that lingers long and leafy, like bitter salad greens. A decent choice to have on its own; a choice that's even better with marinated meat or veggies. Yum."
"D - Once I got past the sweetness and realized there was a hop bitterness this beer became more enjoyable...the ABV is well hidden and the flavors are rounded out nicely...another solid beer from Lagunitas"
"Hits with a slight bitterness that soon give way to grapefruit rind and more citrus. The floral bitterness is here but takes a back seat to the sweet hops it seems. The flavor of resin is more prevalent on the back of my tongue toward the end of the flavor. The mouth feel is fine; delivering flavor all over and the flavor is delicious, complex, and quaffable."
"pours an almost clear copper color with a 1/4 inch white head that quickly fades. aroma is citrus/grapefruity. taste is crisp and refreshing, hoppy (not heavy) slight pine. aftertaste is clean and crisp. i think the regular ipa is better. tastes bitter as it sits for a while. more maltier than hop. still a good beer that is easily drinkable."
"Pours a very transparent light orange color with a small white head that leaves little stickage. Keepin it bitter with this guy, a dose of C hops for some left side aromatics but some intense bittering hops lay fat below. A creeper, this one is very inviting, soft with some bright fruit notes followed by nothing but tongue punching bitterness late on the finish and long into the aftertaste. No boozy heat, although i would argue this here brew as nothing more than a strong-er IPA, rather than a DIPA, but so is life. I miss the bombers but i embrace the six packs, cant believe i never reviewed Maximus, try this one."
"D: I couldn't drink more than a couple of these in a night."
"D - Pretty high for the style."
"Drinkability-I enjoyed it. Was a nice balance between the fruit and pine characteristics. Seemed like a very smooth drink, and would definitely be pleased to have another."
"D - This is not a style I normally session but this one seems sessionable. The alcohol content is sneaking up on me already though."
"Good beer, but I could only session 2 of these Bad Larrys, tops."
"Not a bad IPA but not the best that I've had. Nothing really stood out as amazing."
"Overall its a pretty average selection in the DIPA category. It just seems very pedestrian considering the IBU's and the somewhat of hype it gets."
" Oh, I hope they work on perfecting their hopping of this one. I look forward to trying this again a few months/years up the road! Better than their Hop Stoopid Ale I thought was so good! Lagunitas is moving up my list of best breweries! Cheers!"
"While I would consider Torpedo IPA was the tops of this category, this would make the top5 in that over hopped IPA beer hitting the market."
"I won't absolutely murder it in this review, since it has pretty good overall reviews and there is a chance that I had an off bottle. Otherwise, I was not impressed."
"Lagunitas Maximus is a hazy deep golden ale with a lot of particles floating in it. It has a huge, dense, creamy, lumpy off-white head that shows outstanding retention and lacing. It has a resinous, citrus aroma that's fruity and spicy. It's medium bodied, creamy and smooth with a clean finish. There's something lightly syrupy about it all the way through. It's pretty well balanced and quite sweet. There's a resiny and citrusy bitterness that keeps it in balance, but it's still just a touch too sweet. I'm pretty certain I got an old bottle."
"D: Alcohol is warming, and the beer goes down nicely. Don't drink it on an empty stomach or you'll be on your ass!"
"Very drinkable. Awesome juicy hoppy IPA. great hop profile. somewhat balanced with an emphasis on the hops for sure. Definately a step up from their IPA."
"Poured into my pint glass the beer is orange with an inch of creamy off white head. After it recedes it leaves a nice sticky lace around the glass. The aroma is hops with a slight earthy dirt hint. The flavor is mild hops. Not to bitter. Fruity sweetness is there as well. Sort of a sweet grapefruit if you will. A hint of caramel malt is noted in the finish. Typical medium body moderate carb. This is a fine IPA. Not a blow your doors off one but, easily drinkable."
"Slightly orange, golden hue, nice carbonation. Good sticky lacing. No overwhelming hops, you definitely get some of the citrus/bitter hop scent but for the """Maximus""" name and description, not a punchy IPA like I was expecting. Sweet malty backing, which adds a good balance without being too cloying. Really nice bitter following that increases as it warms and the decent carbonation keeps it lively. Not as sweet as DFH 90 minute and not a hop bomb like Ruination, very refreshing and not aggressive on the taste buds at all. At $9 a six pack, a great value from Lagunitas that drinks more like a IPA rather than a DIPA/IIPA."
"Poured a pretty golden hue. Smell was like butterscotch with a hint of hops. Taste was sweet and buttery. Very litle hops at all. Very smooth. Too me this tasted like an aged barleywine. Couldnt taste the alcohol at all. This beer is definatly on my try again list."
"This is a tasty DIPA that I could put back on a regular basis. Nothing mind-blowing, but a nice beer that's worth trying if for no other reason than the unique aromatic/flavor profile of the hops in here."
"D - It's a pretty drinkable taste. If I was a huge fan of the taste I could definitely drink it a bunch. I can totally see how some people would LOVE this beer though."
"This brewery has about four or more double ipas, a few ipas, a number of strong or old ales so it's hard to keep them all apart. I think Maximus is the best of the bunch. Very balanced flavor, not too strong, good price. One of the better beers from this brewery."
"Another nice beer from the Petaluma crew."
"O - While this beer classifies itself as a DIPA it's debatable in my mind because of the malt dominance and the 7.5% abv. Calling yourself a DIPA means you're playing with the Maharaja's and Pliny's of the world. Would I put this in that category? Absolutely not, but still this is a nicely designed beer that I would drink again. It's sweetness prevents it from being sessionable but if you like your IPA's on the malty side then you'll be pleased with this one."
"D: It's very tasty and drinkable. Not bad - it's no Hop Stoopid, but it's another fine Lagunitas brew."
"Pretty drinkable, I didn't really think of it as a DIPA when drinking it. Alcohol is not that noticeable and doesn't have many of the heavier characteristics I associate with other DIPAs."
"Sample at Barley's Smokehouse. This beer is a hazy light amber color with a thin light beige head that diminishes quickly. Spotty lacing. The aroma is hoppy with some caramel malt. Medium-bodied and moderately bitter with hops and spice flavors, along with some sweet malt and grapefruit underneath. The finish is fruity and hoppy with a lightly bitter aftertaste. Does not pack as much punch as I would expect in a IIPA. Slightly above average overall."
"Pours a rich hopper with an orange hue. Opaque and hazy with bits of sediment floating throughout. Not much nose to speak of, but a deep inhalation is rewarded with the faint scent of citrusy hops. As far as taste, the hop characteristic is very, very mild for an IPA and is more on the fruity side (apricot) than the bitter. Drinks smoothly with mild carbonation."
"Notes: If you really want an Imperial IPA from Lagunitas, do yourself a favor and pass this one up for some Hop Stoopid. Maximus fell way short of what I was expecting from this great brewery. They don't fail often, as most of their beers are 'hits'. You can mark this one down as a 'miss', though, as far as I'm concerned. Oh well, I guess you can't win 'em all..."
"Drinkability: Moderate, but not the highest for the style. The feel kinda bring it down, as well as the alcohol presence. It's decent overall, but I'd probably grab another IPA next time."
"	d- I always include price in drinkability and this bomber was fairly cheap. Will I but it again?> yes, tomorrow. goes down very easy, very enjoyable and very tasty. I have to admit I was very surprised. I did not expect this from this very plain, very boring labeled bottle. love it, buy it. if you like ipas at all this one is top notch. a great DIPA! cant wait to buy more."
"Final thoughts: It has a strange malt bill that adds some interesting flavors, not their best beer but interesting nonetheless."
"Medium body with a low and soft carbonation."
"Age has certainly been kind on this IIPA. Mouthfeel is very light with a punch of flavor prior to a smooth, clean finish. Apricot fruit from the aroma comes through well on flavor."
"Drinkability - Very good, I will finish this bomber in no time. Since I only have one bomber I am limited, but a very nice beer I wouldn't mind trying to drink 2 of."
"D: I would pick another over this one if given the choice. There are other IPA's that would come recommended before this one, this beer just don't pack the punch that I'm looking for. That is mostly hop bombs, in which for the most part come out of the WC."
"I did enjoy this beer, but I felt that it could be improved substantially. It is one to seek out if you are looking for a more balanced DIPA though."
"D: Very drinkable DIPA, don't let the name fool you, this is a good one that has all of the flavors and isn't just a hop bomb."
"D-I'm sure there are some that can and do use this as a session beer, but not for me. Can't see myself drinking more than one. It was too much of an effort to get through."
"Cheers!!!"
"This was a nice strong IPA, just the way I like them. Poured a light amber with a flowing head and fair carbonation. There was a biting, spicy floral smell to it right off the bat. Strong hop taste, slightly bitter, and a spicy finish. Definite citrus tast and smell as well. Honestly the bitterness is the only detractor here."
"Drinkability: The drinkability here is just fine for one or two and the beer is a good illustration of how a highly hopped beer (if the label is to be believed) can still display some malt sweetness to provide relief from the hops On the other hand I prefer a DIPA where the hops and the malt take turns in being dominant. Nonetheless, this good solid well made DIPA and definitely worth trying."
"Overall impression: This is not the beer I had 4 years ago. That was from a bomber and I don't think it was fresh. This beer is a little light for an Imperial IPA but it's a nice beer from Lagunitas."
"Drinkability: VERY drinkable - very enjoyable - Double IPA? Not as hoppy as the usual - much more of a vanilla pale ale - but none the less a great beer from Lagunitas."
"Light amber color with a fluffy off-white head. lots of bubbles. smell is extremely sweet and malty. not a big hop punch in the nose like you expect from a DIPA. Tastes a lot like gnarlywine, only hoppier and not as good. The flavors are all backwards for a DIPA: malt overwhelms the hops, sweetness overwhelms the bitterness. it is light for a DIPA, and a little over-carbonated in my opinion (especially since the emphasis is on the malts and not the hops). Drinkability is great due to its being on the light side, but the beer as a whole does nothing to give it a boost. disappointed with this one, especially since lagunitas has been blowing my mind lately. oh well, if you're not Stone, you can't do everything perfectly can you?"
"D: I really enjoyed this brew. It really doesn't feel like an Imperial to me based on it's competitors these days. It's a good IPA though. It's not the hoppiest and it is not removing enamel from teeth (as it claims) but I liked the balance and liked the marmalade type taste and smell - made a change from my usual passion for grapefruit. At it's price ($11 for a 6 at my local market), it's not going to become my Torpedo killer but I'd drink it any day of the week given the opportunity. Lagunitas makes a good brew. It reminded me that I haven't tried enough of their offerings."
"Another great beer from Lagunitas. Keep up the good work."
"This beer poured an orangey-copper with a single-finger head and some nice lacing. The smell is fruity and hoppy with some citrus and piney notes. The taste pretty well reflects the smell, starting off with some sweet malt that is quickly cut by grapefruit rind hops with some sticky sweet pine that goes into a pretty clean finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and has some moderate carbonation. You can tell you're drinking and IPA with this one, but it isn't nearly as bitter or cloying as some of its brethren."
"D: another solid Lagunitas. I think I will reach for other DIPA's if needed but I am partial, and always will be, to the people in Petaluma, California"
"Drinkability: More of a stand alone but it would go well with a light nasch or appatizer to quell some of the bitterness."
"My friend gave me a bottle of this and I enjoyed it last night. Poured a slightly hazy, orangeish gold color with thin white head, almost no lacing at all. Smelled of fresh mild earthy hops, with slight citrus and caramel malt notes. Tasted of piney hops, slightly fruity and a little bit of malt to finish it off. Mouthfeel was just a tiny bit oily, and carbed just a hint too much. This beer had some flaws, but went down very easily. Could easily session this if I had more."
"Bottle. Poured a beautiful deep amber with a tiny head. Aroma of oranges. Disappointingly dry and bitter flavor (more so than normal for an IPA) compared to favored IPAs such as Stoudts and Dogfish Head, with accents of oranges and grapefruit. Tangy but dry mouthfeel which finished very bitter. Better than many, not as good as many others."
"A nice clear light copper color pour with a big foamy off white head, some soft carbonation,loads of sticky lace left on the glass. Aroma of sweet tangerine with soft piny notes. Flavor is nice , full body, malty sweet ,with some nice orange,and citrus flavors , slightly floral and spicy pretty strait forward. A slightly oily texture but not in a bad way, a long slightly bitter hop aftertaste, very drinkable."
"Drinkability is great as this one comes in a perfect 12 oz. container."
"I tasted this one after a pale ale. It was interesting to see the stronger taste of hops in this double IPA."
"Drinkability: I got a sixpack, but will be drinking one at a time. I love to session a nice hoppy beer, but this is too thick and sweet for that. Delicious though."
"Poured a 12oz twist off bottle into my Brother Thelonious goblet. This beer pours bright peachy amber with a decent 2 inch white head that leaves ringed lacing as the beer recedes from my glass. Big hops come through in the nose but not the necessarily expected ones from a DIPA. Big notes of Apricot and peach with just a slight bit of citrusy orange peel. Sweet honey and sweets malts also vaguely come through at the finish of the nose. The flavor is much the same with peach and apricot dominating the flavor profile. Sweet malts follow through with just a slight alcohol burn on the finish. I'm surprised that so much boozy flavor comes through in a beer that's only 7.5%. The mouthfeel is surprisingly sweet. Its not dry at all. It leaves a very heavy residual sugar coating on the palate. Despite a decent score, I actually find this beer rather disappointing."
"Recommended"
"D - Not an offensive beer, but really not one I could drink more than one of. I felt like it was out of balance towards the malt side of the spectrum for a DIPA with a little bit too much sweetness."
"D- This was an extremely drinkable ipa and for the price it's hard to beat. Not a huge DIPA and very balanced."
"D: Pretty good. Affordable & lower in alcohol than most DIPA's."
"D) A nice brew, very drinkable - pour me another!"
"Poured from bomber to Duvel tulip a dark copper orange color with a frothy cream colored 1 inch head that held on for quite a while leaving sticky lacing. Smells great. Big Piney Hop aroma dominates with a malty caramel sweetness behind. The piney hop flavor dominates and leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. The Caramel malts help balance this stuff quite well. 7.5 APV is more evident as it warms but still not a prominent alcohol burn, only a slight warming. I finished this Bomber off solo and look forward to having this again soon."
"medium body, good amount of carbonation. a good oily resiny mouthfeel from the hops. very sessionable ipa, i could definately see myself drinking this again, very clean well balanced ipa, but definately not as good as the hop stoopid."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is creamy and smooth. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium also. This DIPA lacks the hoppiness that come with a great DIPA. I like this beer but it is a little sweet for me. I am a little disappointed."
"D: This is not the best representation of the style, in my opinion. I've had much better."
"Verdict: Despite it's name, Maximus is certainly on the lower end of the Double IPA intensity scale. If you like pungent hops in your beer, this is certainly worth trying - just don't expect a total hop-bomb."
"pour is a clear amber with a small head. smell is citrus hop and sweetness but muted by the presents of a wood pulp aroma. gives it a subdued noses. palate is milder citrus than expected with a bitter finish. very soft fruit. grapefruit, some mango. malt tasted better than it smells. had better beers from this brewery though."
"This is a good APA, but a Bad IIPA."
"Pours a clear, golden/copper color. 1 and 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of strong hops and sweet malt in the background. Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial IPA. Mouth feel is smooth and chewy with an average carbonation level. The bitterness was present, but not overpowering. Tastes of strong hops up front and sweet malt in the background with some noticeable dryness. Overall, a really tasty brew - I recommend this beer."
"I could have certainly drank my share of this one. Very tastey and smooth, definitely worth a try."
"MF and drink is good but if I'm gonna hit a DIPA I would pass on this when Hop Stoopid and others are available. Heck, HS is way better and cheaper..."
"This is a good brew, but I'd still take something more citrusy and bitter over this one."
"Not bad, but not among my favorites either. I would like to try a fresher sample."
"Pours a fairly weak copper color, but with some very nice head and lacing. Huge citrus hop flavor, covers about everything else, but it's very nice and balanced hop-wise. Huge hop flavor, too, mostly citrus to begin with, a slight pine in the middle, and a nice mix at the end; has a slightly butterscotch/caramal flavor. Goes down really well for a higher ABV and hopped up beer."
"Transparent light caramel color with white frothy head. An enticing but too mild aroma: sugar, maple syrup, caramel malt. Taste has synthetic qualities: syrupy light fruit, sugar, hops in center through finish, sweet/boozy finish that sweats the tongue. A bit too artificially sweetened for my liking. It almost comes across like a dessert liquor; next time I'll bring the flan."
"Drinkability - Reasonably easy drinking for a double IPA, I think I like. The sweet caramel malt grates a little bit, but its definitely tolerable and ends up adding a bit to the mix."
"- Quite drinkable.. but not one I will bask in again anytime soon."
"Poured a rich amber color with a two finger head. Pretty good lacing. Nice hop aroma. Upon first taste I was very impressed with the balance. Not overpowering like many doubles. This beer hides the ABV well for 7.5% and I could definitely have a few of these. One of the better IPAs and a great offering from Lagunitas."
"This orange/red Double IPA was something I simply picked out of the shelf line up tonight for tasting while watching the Villanova-UNC game. The aroma of red malts and subtle woods put my mind into the frame that the beer was more than an IPA and a lot more than an ordinary pale ale. The first taste was similar to that of a current hot item from Troegs that brought up the fruit of the hops in a special manner. Very drinkable and relatively inexpensive by comparison to others in its size."
"This is a really good beer, especially for under $10 a sixer. I would not hesitate to buy this again."
"D- Damn good beer. Pretty light for a big IPA"
"This really lacks in the hops, citrus, pine flavors that I love in this style of beer. This really tastes like more of a winter warmer/barleywine than it does a DIPA. Makes me wonder how old this bottle is, but if those are your styles, I suggest giving it a try."
"drinkability is pretty spot on for a brew of this gravity and intensity of flavors. I could easily plow through a few of these... the lack of a residual bitterness makes it that much more pleasant to quaff. Definitely a solid brew in my book... maybe not quite as double/imperial as it could be, but that kicks it up a notch as far as I'm concerned."
"This is a pretty drinkable ale. Some alcohol heat from the 7.5% ABV is present. It doesnt detract from the experience, but does remind the drinker to try to take things a little slow. This is a tasty brew, and well worth trying for fans of the hoppy styles. And if anyone wants to try to shovel the aftermath of a heavy wet spring snow storm that dumps a foot or so of the white stuff come on over. I'll be glad to share something nice with you, but i am wishing i had the foresight to buy more than one bottle of Maximus...."
"Overall, just what I was looking for. A solid IPA that hits the spot."
"As I pour this beer from my outstretched arm I can smell the hops a good 3 feet away.. awesome. Pours a light orange color.. a little different than most IPA's I've had, or even DIPA's. Nice head and lacing to it though. Taste was very unexpected... grapefruit bomb for sure. This is the most """fruity""" DIPA I've had, a little off but not too bad. I enjoyed but not as much as a lot of other Lagunitas offerings. It's cool they tried to make it different but I would prefer a lot of other breweries DIPA offerings."
"Was surprised to see this at the Hannaford market but figured I might as well give it a try. This brew poured to a clear orange color with nice copper highlights. Produced a thick off white head that had fine retention and left some clumps of froth and a lot of lacing. The aroma was extremely hoppy, very citrusy in the aromas that it gives off. For me it is reminiscent of grapefruit but with other hop aromas also there. Malt is there but I am having a hard time identify its aroma properties but think it is caramel and slightly roasted. The flavor is pretty much all about the hops but they are not overbearing as the flavoring they give is excellent. Those hop flavors seem to be all orange and grapefruit, not picking up to much in the way of pine. Also there is the malts, the malt here comes out more and is more distinguishable than in the nose as you can taste a nice underlying caramel. Overall this was a nice brew, I would say that as I got close to the end I did get tired of this one and was ready to move on. Though I say this I did like this brew and would get it again. Would be nice on a comfortable summer day drinking it on the deck letting the day pass by."
"Delightful!"
"Its a big beer and comes in a big bottle. Wish there was two people to share it, although I drank it relatively (too much so) quickly. Defionately better up front than the lingering taste but I really liked it upfront and aftertaste was decent."
"Quite drinkable with minimal bitter for an IPA, almost watery. I really like this one, drinkable and very hoppy...nice summertime IPA."
"I am not sure that I ever had the Maximus prior to today, and it may not be my most favorite of all time, but it's my favorite of right now, and I vow to never refuse one! I also promise to drink another one tonight (but first, there is some Sierra Nevada Torpedo awaiting)."
"D: More challenging than I'd expect for a relatively low ABV DIPA. I guess it's the carbonation? Or the bitterness? Still drinkable overall, though."
"Lagunitas Maximus India Pale Ale pours a thin head that rapidly collapses into a ring of foam. The brew is a clear deep orange color, and carbonation is slow but steady. The nose is sweet malt and floral and pine hop. The flavor is those sweet malts giving over to a fresh herbal hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is fairly light, finishing dry- but unlike a few West Coast IPAs I've tried, this isn't a total hop bomb. Though bitter, there is still some balance here. Grassy hop aftertaste. Though not to my personal ideal of how an IPA should be put together, this is one of the better West Coast IPAs I've tried- and you ought to, too."
"D: This has a lot of very nice flavors. Not overwhelmingly bitter, but I can appreciate that. It's certainly got a measured dose of bitterness, but it's no hop bomb. Another strong brew from Lagunitas."
"D - Smooth and demanding. Cannot wait to get back to the store to pick up more of these."
"D- this has got to be one of the best bargain brews out there. lots of hops, nice malt presence, and extremely drinkable with a lowish ABV for the style. and for 4$ a bomber, ill check this one out fairly often. i just with the bottle came with a best by date, a brewed on date, or some way to tell if its still fresh."
"Scott"
"I buy this at the happiest place on earth. Liqour World. They have the best selection for hopheads, such as myself. To the point, Lagunitas brews are all outstanding in my book. This one is my favorite of all IPAs. I treat myself on occasion, but I enjoy their IPA 6er quite often."
"The dryness of the aftertaste encourages me to drink more which, while imprudent for such a high ABV brew, is very nice. Very good DIPA and for the price, unbeatable."
"Drinkability: A nice offering from a brewery that is starting to become a favorite of mine, this is a very sessionable DIPA thats perfectly balanced and executed."
"pours amber orange with very little head although it did retain. no lacing left on the glass. smell was VERY sweet. sweet floral hops and sweet candied malts. taste is very sweet with light honey, floral hop. light bitterness that lingers through the finish. malts are present about half way through. solid backbone though. carbonation is kind of light but good. this is a solid beer. it is not has hoppy as i was expecting but a great DIPA. a little different character than most. i am pretty certain that by the time i got this bottle, much of the hops have faded away."
"Mouthfeel is medium and crisp. A little lighter than I thought with the ABV, but not all bad. Very refreshing and could sneak up and smack you in the melon if your not careful."
"**On a side note, I think there website is crap. I want you to tell me about your beer. Tell me how you love making it and what kind of hops and malt go into it, so that when I'm drinking it I can try and taste what you're describing. We want to know!"
"IPA, Double IPA, hell, they could call it a stout for all I care, this is a good beer. Not so oppressively hoppy as most DIPAs, Maximus compliments the hop character with a surprising sweetness. Hints of honey and various tangy fruits accompany the piney bitterness. I'm one of those people who's constantly trying to find the next unholy IPA that's packed with an ungodly amount of hops, but when I'm just looking for a good IPA, I can't think of anything much better than this."
"Overall a very good beer from Langunitas."
"Overall: This beer is full of a bitter strain of hops but with minimum amounts of other strains including mild & aromatic floral styles. This brew is nicely balanced with sweet malts. I enjoyed this nice creation from Lagunitas in the lovely Sonoma Co. CA. It currently only costs $3.99 in Va. and is more than worth the price."
"Overall, not please with this one. Very low carbonation and a thin body makes this one a bit tough to get down and there is some sweetness that is cloying in the finish as well. Not Lagunitas's best effort, for sure."
"This beer looks so nice, almost amber color, a ton of foamy head with waterfalls of lacing all the way down the glass. Smell is piney hops with a bit of chewy malt coming through as well. Taste is strong on the malt as well. I'd like a bit more hops on this one. Bitterness is pretty solid but it's lacking that nice citrusy hop presence that I love so much. That said it's still a solid beer, just not a standout in the genre. I'd gladly drink it again but It's not gonna be at the top of my list."
"This is a pretty good DIPA. I remember it being better. Perhaps the age weakened the hoppiness. I'll edit the review next time I have a fresh one."
"Nice amber color, strong orange around the rims, small beads and thin foam along the surface which swiftly evaporates. Sweet nose of orange peel, lemon peel, pinch of baking spices, malty but not roasted, tightens up well as the scents dissolve. Medium-bodied, heaviest during the attack, here adds in some bitter hoppiness to counterbalance the malt, chocolate sweetness alongside the orange/tangerine citrus, ginger, brioche breadiness. Never gets too dry, clings to your cheeks even as the weight relieves. Acts as if consciously wants to avoid being too complex. A very good beer."
"Drinkability: Eh. Wish I woulda opened one of the better brews in my fridge. Nothing special stands out about this IIPA. I've had quite a bit of Lagunitas lately, and I'm getting a little tired of all the sugar. As said above, this reminds me of a more bitter (not necessarily hoppier) Imperial Red. Kind of a boring drink. Not bad, just... bleh."
"Pours a golden amber brownish colored body, with big bubbles. A big white head, somewhat lasting. Has a strong hop aroma - some citrus, bitter, and sweetness. Semi-bitter, semi-sweet taste, small sour hops aftertaste, pretty smooth."
"A nice DIPA from Cali. Not my favorite, i think the hops combo they use just doesn't work for me. Regardless, a well crafted brew."
"taste is creamy, hoppy, caramel, touch of citrus, a bit sweet, some roasted nuts in the back, end is a little bitter with a thick mouth-feel."
"This is a good, reliable IIPA to go to. It's not an extreme example, but never the less a very good example of IIPA."
"12-13-2013 Edit: Fresher version about 3 months old is much better can't wait to find a really fresh version. Adjusted numbers to reflect newer experience. Hops are more prominent and color is better."
"Although this isn't a great DIPA in my opinion, it's very tasty, finishes pretty clean, and goes down smooth. This wouldn't be a bad beer to use as an intro to the style for a non-hophead."
"A very very good IPA and a nice hop showcasing. I can't put my finger on the variety, but I know it's a hop profile that doesn't get a whole lot of play in our citrus/grassy hop happy culture."
"Pours out orangey with a nice citrus smell that hits your sinuses like a freight train. The hops hit you from the first sip and don't stop til the very last drop. A nice malt profile on this one as well though, the balance is very solid. Another winner from Lagunitas."
"D - Probably slightly lower ABV than your average DIPA, so drinkability is elevated for the DIPA style. Overall an okay brew, I'd like to try it on-tap."
"Bottle. Pours a dark orange brown. Smelled pretty piney, with floral and malty tints. Tasted mainly hoppy, piney, with definite malt notes, slightly boozy, definitely can taste the high alcohol content. All in all though a really solid double IPA, a personal favorite go to beer when money is tight. A favorite for the price for sure."
"Pours copper color with little off-white head. Smell - pine, citrus and lots of hops. Alcohol is not really noticable. Taste is pretty much the same, hoppy with bitter citrusy finish. Very well balnced, medium bodied. Alcohol is very well hidden. Very drinkable. Nice brew."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Deep golden orange color, with quite a bit of yeast floating around. Big tan head, very sticky. Aroma is sweet and caramel malty, with juicy citrus that tends towards sweet rather than sharp/bitter. As a fan of dry and bitter IPAs, this isn't looking good so far. Flavor confirms my suspicions, as this beer is kind of a gooey mess of crystal malt and candied fruit. Totally disregards the tenets of attenuation and drinkability."
"Drinkability: a very pleasant beer, very drinkable, great flavor."
"7/4/6/3/14 (3.4/5)"
"Overall: not hoppy enough to be novel for its IBU's and not interesting enough on the malt side to be noteworthy for its balance. If it were on tap at most bars, I would love it. Given my other choices at home, though, it's just a'ight."
"The drinkability is quite high, and this is a damn decent brew. Not as bitter as I would have expected, but the caramel character of this beer really shines for me and I would get it again. Thanks to Shawn for leaving this in the fridge, and allowing me to re-try this beer!"
"Drinkability= It is a good example of the style but nothing special. Could have more of everything."
"Thanks to my GF for picking this up as a happy exams over present."
"And is very drinkable. Could have another bomber I think."
"This beer pours a clear golden orange color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes into nice lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit with hints of pine and caramel. The taste is remarkably sweet for a DIPA. There are definitely a lot of hops there, but it seems the sweetness is what strikes me first. It is followed by grapefruit and pine hops. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a lower level of carbonation. Overall, this is a mediocre example of a DIPA. With so many better DIPAs out there I can't see myself drinking this again."
"Overall: Wonderful. This is one I've bought on multiple occasions since it became available in my area, don't know why I didn't review it until now but great beer. Highly recommended along with pretty much every offering from Lagunitas."
"D: A medium hop IPA with impressive texture and various flavors, perhaps that's what the name means. Starts off sweet and moves towards tart at the end. Interesting take on the style."
"Exactly the kind of Imperial I would expect from Lagunitas. Looks and smells like any good IPA. The taste is what separates this brew. Hops are definietly there, but there is a lot of fruits and citrus, with a little malt and possibly mint. This could be in its own category. Highly recommend."
"M/D: Lightly carbonated and astonishingly smooth. The medium-high ABV is masked beautifully and the texture lends itself to leading me to want another one or two. I don't know if I could drink more than 3 of these bombers, but hey, I would definitely try it!"
"Pours an enticing dark gold, smells of a bit of hops but not as much as I expected, relatively weak on the nose which surprises me as most IIPAs I've tried have a great nose. Looking down the ratings already here, it seems like I'm the only one who will score this weak on aroma- maybe my nose is too stuffed? Really just a bland bit of hoppy aroma, nothing special. The label lists 72.41 IBUs, pretty low for a 2IPA. First sip... wow, lots of hop punch, but balanced with a citric sweetness and some malt towards the end. Finishes long, honey/malty, and bitter. Perfect mouthfeel- sticky malt with adequate carbonation. Really, really enjoyable IPA, the best new IPA I've tried in months. I want to give this a higher rating but the nose just wasn't there for me. Either way, excellent IIPA, a far better effort than Lagunitas' regular IPA. Recommended for sure."
"This is a middle of the road IPA. It's only 3.49 for a bomber though, so I'm glad I tried it."
"D- I could drink this beer all day or at least until the alcohol hit me. Very drinkable for a double IPA. If I did not know I wouldn't guess this is a DIPA. Two thumbs up and I would hope I can get this beer again."
"This is a pretty good example of the style. A little rough around the edges and not quite as complex as I would prefer, but hard to argue with for $3.99/22 oz. I recommend giving this one a shot."
"Drinkablity Again sorry for the repeat but just a little to sweet for me. I can drink a 22 oz bottle no problem."
"D: For the price this is a great deal. My lady friend grabbed this to try to find some cheaper DIPA options. I think this is a great solution for hopheads who need a fox but find the medicine has become too expensive."
"D- this bomber went down fast just trying to figure out what the hell it tastes like. its different and its good, but the certain sweet and bitter flavors contrast one another."
" to buy this one again. This is one to drink and compare for me, but now one to have as a standby brew."
"D - For the most part an easy drinking beer, but the huge sweetness drops it a point or so. I think it is easier to view this beer as a malty IPA or even a well-hopped amber rather than an imperial IPA. Though I'm thoroughly enjoying the brew, it's not a great represenation of a DIPA."
"D-Great drinkability! This one is very enjoyable to drink down slowly and enjoy how the flavors progress. It's got some very refreshing hoppiness that keeps me wanting more. Will be on my guard to get this one again."
"D: Drank this really fast. Didn't feel at all like a 7.5% beer. May drink it again, but not my favorite beer."
" Not gonna blow your mind but quite drinkable."
"Crisp and medium-bodied, Maximus isn't anything earth-shattering, but like almost all the Lagunitas offerings I've enjoyed so far, it is a fine, well-made brew and very drinkable."
"All in all it is a nice beer for someone who has never had an IPA before and want to wet their feet (or palate), but it doesn't stand out for me."
"Overal good beer, but that metalic flavor droped the rateing some."
"A beer purportedly all about the hops, for sure, but the real star here is the level sweetness from a properly balancing maltiness - a necessity in an IPA and more so in an IIPA. An all around easy-drinker, for the hop-inclined, the elevated ABV a non-issue (for the time being) to boot. Still, though, if you're just looking for a palate cleanser (or wrecker), with a whole lot of peppy hop goodness, you could do a lot worse than this."
""""sessionable DIPA, is that an oxymoron?""""
"Comments- I'll get this one again, but it is far from my favorite of the style. Still, I'm sad that this is the last bottle in my 6-pack. And while at 7.5% abv it is not exactly a session beer, it's nice that this beer (unlike some 9-10%+ DIPA/IIPAs) doesn't knock you on your ass."
"The beer pours a nice color, bright, dark amber with good highlights. It's a good looking beer with a good head. It smells of some good hops, but it's a little underwhelming as a DIPA. Lagunitas makes some good beers, but a DIPA should be bigger than this, especially with some nearby brewers making incredible pale ales, like Russian River and Bear Republic. The hops are a bit tart, which is enjoyable, with citrus and pine flavors. There's some balancing malt, but it's just not strong enough. Otherwise, the beer is good. Don't get me wrong; I enjoyed this beer. I always appreciate a new DIPA. It's just with a name like Maximus and coming from Lagunitas, I was prepared to be blown away and that didn't happen."
"A very good brew, as are most that come out of Lagunita's!"
"TMD-Very smooth taste that had hardly any bitterness to it.Very good drinkable IPA I myself don't usually seek these out but this one was good. I would definetly try another."
"The aftertaste is long and chewy like a Stone brew. It's a really nice taste and flavor, and great full body. If anything, it's just a bit to thick and chewy."
"Drinkability: As a double IPA, not something you want to session, but quite drinkable and enjoyable for the style - and at 7.5% abv, more drinkable than most."
"Excellent beer, one of the best I've had recently. Will definitely return to it."
"D- While it is interesting, and for the price it is fantastic(!), it may only serve as a novel way to start a session, leading to another beer for the evening."
"D- It's on the stronger side for a traditional IPA, yet not so strong that it really fits the Double billing in terms of ABV. I could see drinking more than 1 in a sittig. However, the alcohol seems present enough that I wouldn't let myself go overboard."
"D- Hoppy, as expected, but the malt also holds its own. Well balanced IMO."
"D. The drinkability is fair. It's easy to drink and the alcohol is well hidden for a beer of a abv. of 7.50%. But I would not drink another. The price is right but I'd rather spend my money on a more balanced more flavorful beer."
"Overall, this is one of the smoothest IIPAs I've ever had. Not at all what I expected. This could be a dangerous session IIPA. And at 8.4% ABV, lookout!"
"D-This is a nice DIPA that has a surprisingly mild character (especially with a name like MAXIMUS). This would be a nice intro DIPA...if there is such a thing. I like this one and will have it again."
"D: Man this would be great too drink a whole bunch of these, but it would catch up to you very quickly with the 8.4%/abv. I drank two of these in a row one night and I slept great. Highly recommend this IPA."
"Overall, a good choice for a West Coast DIPA. Very well made and balanced, don't hesitate to try one out."
"I have noticed, for the most part, Lagunitas offers some real nice big beers for less than some of their competitors. No different here. Pours a clear orange color with a nice initial sticky head and pretty good retention. Aroma is mostly floral grapefruit hops but there's also some candy malts. The flavor consists of a lot of citrus grapefruit hops, especially up front, then mellows a bit with a lesser sweet malt profile. Finishes a bit bitter and dry. They are able to provide a lot of flavor with a relatively low abv too. And again, there's real good value here. I'll be getting this again."
"drinkability is good. pretty nice balance, but i'd have liked more hops in the flavour/aroma. still, a solid offering overall that i'm enjoying."
"Drinkability- I thought it wasn't bad but I am not sure in what category of me liking it that I would put it in."
"4"
"D: It is on the lighter, more mild side of the DIPA spectrum, but Maximus would be easier to drink if it actually *was* hoppier. That bitterness would encourage me to keep sipping on it and taking big gulps. Still, it's a solid beer that """drink pretty good""" and should be sampled by anyone looking for a decent DIPA."
"D- I actually picked this up tonight because its my go-to IPA. Cheap price and outstanding hop usage means that Maximus is recommended to my customers and is greatly welcomed wherever it is brought, be it a friends house, social occasion, or just to fall asleep on."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - High drinkability and wonderful mouthfeel due to tremendous balance."
"Beer poured an amber orange with a long lasting head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is of citrus hops and bread. Taste is nicely balanced as this starts off bready and finishes with a slam of citrus hops. Mouthfeel is very full for the style and quite smooth. Drinkability is quite nice, abv is manageable, and each sip is very satisfying. Would recommend to those who enjoy the style."
"D: I really enjoyed this DIPA, although, because of its dedication to filling out the malt component, comes off as an APA styling of a DIPA. Very complex and complete in flavor and aroma."
"D- I wish I had bought more. Unfortunately I don't have good access to this brew. Thx Lagunitas for a very drinkable IPA."
"For an absurd amount of hops and malts used to make this beer, it's pretty well balanced and tasty. With no head and carbonation, I have to wonder if this is old or not."
"D - Absolutely drinkable. Lagunitas has better offerings but this is a nice ale I plan to purchase again."
"The taste was bitter all the way through and has a soft malt presence in the middle. In the mouth it was aggressive on the tongue and semi chewy. Overall a middle of road effort in the double ipa world."
"Really good DIPA, and one that I will certainly return to."
"Poured a nice gold color. Nose was hops and plenty of it. First taste was HOPS backed up my plenty of malts. A little piney and citrusy. The hops stuck around for a minute or two after leaving a good mouthfeel that wa slightly bitter but not to bitter that it turned me off."
"Drinkability, sure. Its a great sit down sipper. The hops aren't just presant but offer flavor. My bottle offered 8.4% abv. Nice for is beer."
"very affordable - a great value!"
"Drinkability is high. Great flavor and although alcohol is a moderate level, it is well hidden. A great brew for sure."
"M/D: The carbonation level was good and the beer was thick, creamy and smooth, but I think drinkability was where the beer fell down. It left a very bitter and very dry aftertaste that seemed to last for a long time, certainly more than other beers that I have reviewed. Overall, it is an OK beer, but I will reach for others first."
"A good over all imperial IPA but not one of my favorite examples. Not my favorite from Lagunitas either... that one still goes to Lucky 13."
"Drinkability: Not the most bitter; not the most extreme; but a very nice example of the DIPA style"
"M/D - Medium bodied and a little on the creamy side. The bitterness lingers in a very good way. Mouth feels like it is almost coated in hop juice."
"D: Darn good IPA. Nice citrus aroma and flavor. ABV caught up to me a bit by the time I finished the bomber."
"D: Excellent drinkability! This, as far as I'm concerned, is very sessionable. Excellent balance between sweet, bitter, and dry. I really liked this IIPA."
"While not exceptional, Lagunitas Maximus is a worthy entry from the Left Coast and one worth quaffing where available."
"The taste is just a creamy delight. The beer is a bit bitter, probably from the Amarillo hops. There are plenty of oily and estery hops, a nice astringency, balanced by the creamy malts. There is a bit of a biting and sharp aftertaste, but overall the relatively high ABV is well hidden underneath. The hops are a bit leafy and sharp, but I believe that the creaminess of the beer blends so well with the hoppiness, that it just works well and makes for an enjoyable experience. L'Chaim."
"This is a very well made example of the style and I can recommend it with no qualms."
""
"D: Another great and reasonable priced Lagunitas brew."
"D - Pretty solid DIPA from Lagunitas. Quite surprised by the maltiness of this brew, but there was still a decent hop presence, though nothing compared to the Coronado Idiot IPA that preceded it."
"Update - On cask (02-13-13) Enjoyed at the Grill Next Door this cask ale shows a pretty golden amber, clear with a generous white head and chunky lacing to spare. The aroma brings a nice blend of citrus and tropical fruit with a nutty malt aspect and a bit of alcohol. The flavor brings on much the same with a pleasant blend including mango, pineapple and banana with subtle grass and lemon hop edges. There's a little woodsy pine and tea bread ideas. All of this presented in a medium bodied brew with modest but decent carbonation for a cask ale and a slick, somewhat heavy feel."
"Drinkability is great. I can't isolate a single bad quality in this beer. It's not metallic, or too astringent. Not too sweet. Just an all around good beer. Don't expect this one to really knock your socks off though."
"The sticky sweet finish would prevent me from wanting more than 2, but very nice and I'll be buying more."
"By the way these things have twist-off caps, nearly caused a serious mess when I tried too hard to pry the cap off with an opener"
"Not a bad beer, but a little one-dimensional. Something needs to be done about the mouthfeel - DIPAs should be smoother and more even-bodied than this. And maybe pull back a little on the tart hop notes, and let the other ones shine through."
"Poured this into a flute IPA glass, pours a reddish brown with a serious fluffy head that leaves some insane lace on the glass. Smell is pretty piney with also a bit of sweet nectar like smells. Taste was a bit of a dissapointment for me I was expecitng a cali hop bomb but it was pretty mild and tamed, not sure if it was a fresh bottle or not, overall malty more than hoppy. I was expecting a bit more of a hop character to this one, overall not bad."
"Great balance, perfect carbonation, and the ABV isn't too high, making this a highly drinkable, enjoyable brew."
"A standout amoung IPA's."
"Found a bottle in the grocery store singles section. Always is a shame the big grocery have one of a beer left over...and it still need a home. Nice amber with orange hues. Good hop nose. Nice sweetness quickly tempered and beat down with a hop awesomeness. I'm so glad I picked this up."
"D: The alcohol level and hoppiness of this one make it far from sessionable. The finish is not as clean as others in this style that keep it from being as easily consumed. Thats ok with me though, since I am more than happy to sip on this one."
"Surprisingly good. Mouthfeel could stand a bit more heft/carbonation, though."
"A great and slightly heavy IPA experience. The more I drink Imperial IPA's the more in love I fall with them. This one comes highly recommended. I scored on the slightly conservative side, even though my taste told me otherwise, simply because I havent tried too many I-IPA's. I definitely recommend."
"Very good IPA. A hop bomb, but it is more balanced than I thought it would be."
"D - This is a pretty good IPA. Nice citrus aroma and flavor."
"D- Easy drinking DIPA. Maybe like a DIPA junior. Nonetheless, a nice beer from Lagunitas. Good representation of a DIPA."
"This is a pretty """doggone good""" beer and follows the Imperial IPA style well. I will definitely have again and probably as a good starter or on it's own, but I don't think I will be having more then one at a time. I think this would be a good starter for a couple APA chasers."
"Pours an amber/orange color with an incredible foamy tan head, and an outrageous amount of lacing on the glass. Really impressive looking. Great balance in the nose...hoppy, piney, but not overpowering, and the malt comes through. Great taste, plenty of citrus flavors, and an almost sugary sweetness to the malt...not cloying, and it really keeps the hops from thrashing the taste buds. This is damn tasty. I've oddly ignored Lagunitas up until now, but I"""ll be sure to check out as much of their beer as I can."
"D : Another fine offering from Lagunitas. One I wouldn't mind having again."
"Again, impressed with Lagunitas. The grown up version of their ipa."
"I have to admit that this seems more bitter than the bottle advertised 70 IBUs - but then this is a DIPA."
"Served on tap, poured a murky gold with a thick white head. I think the keg got shaken up quite a bit. None the less, it made for an ugly DIPA. It smelled bright and hoppy, a bunch of pineapple citrus aroma spilling out. It drinks very smooth and balanced for a DIPA. It's one of the more subtle examples of the style, and probably borders on IPA territory. I could have 3 or so glasses in an evening without getting tired of this beer."
"Be sure not to miss this one."
"Solid offering from Lagunitas. There are so many double & IIPAs out there. This one ranks somewhere in the middle. I'd gladly have it again, in fact, I will."
"Note: This bottle was leftover from a beer club party I hosted on June 31, 2008."
"I could only have two of these, as they pack a punch that one can feel. This is one to sip and savor. Enjoy!!"
"D: There's nothing wrong with this beer, but it's a pretty weak version of a DIPA. I'd rather consider this a strong IPA and judge it on those criteria."
"i was thinking, when would i want this? and instead of the typical 'oh, i had a hard day at the office, beer me' type situation, i was thinking if i was in some sunny yet breezy climate like northern california, and i was driving home say mid-afternoon (an early day at the office) and accidentally ran over a homeless man who was traversing the shoulder in a blind curve, and i panic and decide to drive the body to a secluded yet rocky grove and spend all afternoon into early evening burying him... when i left and i was exhausted, sweaty and dirty and had skin scraped from my knuckles... then i would love one, two, three, four or five of these"
"Pours a clear amber/red glow with good fluffy off white head with good lace. Nose is defenitely west coast hops, but the malt presence is pretty big. Taste is dissapointingly weak (relatively speaking) malts a nice and sugary. Mouthfeel is good, maybe a bit on the thick side. Drinkability is good enough, pretty good for the abv. Overall an average west coast IPA, probably wont buy it again, but would choose it over many others. Not a bad choice."
"d - incredibly well-balanced and for 8.5% ABV the alcohol is not evident at all. this goes down so smooth and it's delicious."
"Leaves a nice hoppy aftertaste. You know what you're going to get with lagunitas, and it's usually good."
"D- For hopheads and IPA fans this is a good option, with so many West Coast hoppy beers though, this doesn't stand out from the bunch."
"Basically, this is a surprisingly easy to drink DIPA. 70-odd IBU's, 7-odd alcohol... meh. No prob. I'm not calling this a lawn-mowing beer by any means, but indeed a great beer for drinking any time. But particularly, for this slice of summer heaven."
"My bottle stated 8.4 ABV and I felt it. Good bang for the buck. I guess I will have this from time to time and when I am in a hop crazy mood."
"D - Absolutely awesome, especially factoring in the $4 price tag. I'd recommend this to all IPA lovers, and I can certainly see this becoming a staple in my collection."
"People mumble. Beer speaks. Maximus roars."
"D: A pretty good DIPA, but unfortunately not near the top of this absolutely loaded field."
"Drinkability: Somewhat overpowering, and one was good for me. I don't know if I'll be coming back to this one..."
"D: Good drinkability, well hopped, dry and moderately enjoyable."
"D-Could drink this out of bottles or on tap all day long...as long as I had a ride home."
"Improves quite a bit as it warms up, as I was sort of bored by the initial hit. Not really crafted to how I enjoy DIPA's, but is clearly well assembled and looks and tastes good if a bit underwhelming from the aroma. Modest complexity but that's not really the hallmark of the style anyway. A very respectable DIPA which the haters will appreciate more than the hop forward DIPA's out there."
"A very solid brew that is worth the try, but their regular IPA is better in my opinion."
"D: All in all, this a good beer. Nothing exceptional but it is full of suprises. Very good considering a bomber cost me less than $3. Can and will drink again."
"D- I wouldn't have more than one, but the single serving goes down with no problem. The alcohol isn't too bad either, compared to others of the style."
"a very enjoyable beer"
"Pours a mahogany cherry with a pillowy, tightly wound creamy head that grabs the side of the glass and leaves a nice and pretty lace across the glass. Smell is piney hops, french bread, orange zest and some white peppery alcohol spiciness. Taste is sweet, short bread, carmel malted sweetness, balanced by a solid hoprageous attack on the end of the palate. Solid citrus hops, some floral mango/tangerine and orange zest drizzled with sugar. A nicely balanced, bittersweet double IPA. The drinkablity is off the chart. I drank this one after mowing the lawn and had absolutely no trouble putting 2 down. Very nice!"
"From a bomber pours a clear orange with fine white head and clingy lacing. Smell: citrusy and earthy hops, pale/crystal malt in the background and a touch of diacetyl. Taste: hops upfront, citric and medicinal, touch of alcohol, thin but quite sweet maltiness. Mouthfeel: medium bodied with a puckering finish. There are several other DIPAs I would pick over this one."
"Entry level IPA in my opinion. I hope this was from a bad tap because I like most lagunitas beers."
"Overall: Great beer. I love Langunita's beer - it's quality through and through. Never had a bad one, to date."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I am a hop head but this beer is definitely not a session brew. Very drinkable with a late lunch paired with the Atomica Pizza from Pizzeria Paradiso."
"Poured an orange body that left a slow dieing 1-finger head. Earthy, fruity and spicy is how I would describe the different smells from the hops; hops are about the only thing you'll really pick up. For a DIPA this is a very smooth beer. Contains sharp, floral, citric hops with some spices in it and some type of malt (coffee, cocoa?) that led to a dryness and flavor punch in the middle. Still finished with a semi-dry backbite that some sweetness to it. I will recommend this brew to IPA fans and have it again, but I couldn't session this."
"This was served in a pint glass pourn from a 12-oz bottle. Appearance was burnt orange with moderate head. the smell was of grapes, grapefruit and a little wood. Taste was nice and citrusy with a bitter front and a smooth mouth feel with a little oil and very little alcohol. I thought this beer had the perfect carbonation and left nice lacing down the glass. This is a great brew that I would seek out next season, it taste a lot different to me than the 07 version. I noticed the six pack said 7.5 abv and the bottle said 8.4 so I guess they are not wasting those old 6 pack containers, thats green and good. I also noticed a little wood flavoring in this, is it in there or is that just me? Cheers!"
"Pours a bronze-amber color with a nice off-white/tan head. Spicy citrus/hoppy aroma and taste, but still with a good balance. Slightly more pungent taste than I would have expected, and the alcohol hits a bit more strong than I'd expect for 7.5%. Nevertheless it's still nicely done. Generally smooth mouthfeel; quite solid. Certainly a worthwhile and enjoyable beer, but there's some other Double IPA's that I'd go for first. I think I prefer their regular IPA."
"Poured into a pint glass with a nice foamy head. The color is a deep golden and a carbonation is strong for such a big beer. The floral hops come through. There is a rose and big box of triscuits. The flavor is grapefruit, citrus, and a little grassy. The body is big and the abv. is 8.4% so it seems to hit you after one. After two you are feelin pretty good! A great brew!"
"I'm a sucker for a good double IPA and this was one of them. Enjoyed it well chilled in my Duvel chalice. Poured a sexy bright gold color (bet you don't hear that description too often.) Nice head retention and some lacing. The nose was nice and pleasent with pines and citrus and a tad floral. The taste was smooth yet forward with a nice variety of hops that coats the tongue and warms the palate. Nice brew."
"Lagunitas makes great beer consistently at very competitive prices."
"Poured a brilliant, medium golden color with a nice 2 finger head. Aroma: juicy, peachy, citrusy hops. I'm getting aroused just from the smell. Taste was equally arousing. Lots of bitter, citrusy flavors mesh well with the sweet honey-like malts. Mouthfeel was slick, oily and smooth. Very easy to put down several of these at one sitting. This is one of the more balanced DIPA's in my opinion. It satisfies my hop craving, but isn't over the top with the bitterness. Served from a short, stubby 12oz bottle. Listed ABV: 8.4%"
"Very nice offering without any flaws, but my taste buds prefer a bit more fresh citrus."
"D- A wonderful IPA that doesn't seem to be too much of a hop bomb. However at 7.5% ABV you might want to be careful not to have too many."
"Very full bodied, and with the residual dryness and bitterness, it's not the most drinkable, ale, but not one to shy away from either."
"Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and well carbonated. A very, very good IPA from Lagunitas."
"All in all nothing special."
"D- This is a nice DIPA, that is not over the top hops to me. The etoh doesn't punch me in the face either. I am on my second, going strong."
"D - Surprisingly easy to drink a great follow un to their IPA."
"As a hop fan, this is a pretty decent DIPA, but not the best. The ABV isn't even that impressive, given the slightly troublesome drinkability. Great story on the side of the bottle though."
"If you can work through the bitters, there's a decent beverage underneath."
"D: Very drinkable at 7.5% ABV, I would say this has more of a single IPA feel, rather than a double. But none the less a very nice selection."
"D> Easy drinker, big points here. yes very different than what I had on tap, but holds up well. starting to resemble a light body barleywine. NOTE: On tap, Maximus barely held a candle to Hop Stoopid. That stood up with the best I've had. Maximus is a step behind."
"This beer is drinkable, at least my sample is. It's a good beer, but a double? The price is good so I'll try another sometime, maybe mine was not so fresh."
"Drinkability - I didn't like this beer all that much, but those who really like a bitter profile should enjoy this."
"Drinkability is pretty good, being less over the top then some of their other DIPAs helps the sessionability, as does the clean finish. The alcohol's a bit high (8.4% on my bottle), which becomes more noticable as it warms, as does the pungency of the hops."
"Pours clear amber with a nice offwhite and lasting head in a tulip. Smell is caramel mostly and a slighty hoppy twinge to it, but it is very understated for a double IPA. Perhaps the hops have just faded. Flavors of caramel and tea like hops. Mild bitterness, thin, yet syrupy sweet at times. Decent, I guess, but needs more hops, unless this is an old bottle..."
"Pours a copper color with an off with moderate off-white head that leaves some lacing. Aroma is mainly pine, but not as strong as others in the style. Taste starts sweet with pine flavors that grow mid palate and finish. The overall hop flavor is stronger than a regular IPA, but not as strong as some of the bigger IIPAs. The mouthfeel is creamy with the right amount of carbonation. I found the beer to be very drinkable and I had no problem consuming the bomber very quickly. Overall its a very solid beer and definately an IIPA I'll be picking up again in the future."
"pours a very pretty light golden copper color with a big white frothy head. smell is wonderful, floral and bitter hops dominate the nose. taste is equally as good, has a nice pungent hop flavor, a very mild malt presence. but just enough malty sweetness to balance the hops. mouthfeel is good as is drinkability. pretty darn good beer all around"
"Very easy to drink. Alcohol is evident, but this beer goes down real easy. If I had another one I'd be drinking it right now."
"22oz bottle from the haus, poured a nice copper head with a very nice citrus mango aroma. Great balance hops with a medium body and a lip smacking finish. One of the better IPA's I've had recently but still not my favorite Lagunitas which shows you how good these guys are."
"This poured a clear copper with a little bit of white head. It smelled like roasted malt and pine hops with a bit of alcohol. It tasted like both citrus and pine hops blended nicely together, with a good malt balance as well. The texture was oily, slightly thicker than water, with a bit of carbonation. It had a mildly bitter aftertaste at first, but it built with time. Overall this was a very tasty beer, reminiscent to me of the Dogfish 90 Min (one of my all-time favorites)."
"Overall very drinkable and another great beer from Lagunitas."
"D- Goes down very easy and with much pleasure. The mid range ABV makes this an excellent session beer while the wonderfully different flavors make each sip better than the last."
"Overall a nice beer, and recommended."
"D: Aside from the heavy bitterness (which I kind of enjoy), this is a well made DIPA, but should be sipped and allowed to warm. Recommended."
"D: Good all around.. just not quite as much of a hop barrage one would expect... might be a great introduction to the dIPA for someone who is a bit hesitant with the hoppy hops :)"
"But there's lot to enjoy about Maximus--the citrus is really good, the texture is smooth with a bit of hopped-up crunchiness, and it's tasty. Not a big, brash DIPA, but one can do far worse than Maximus. Grab end enjoy, just don't expect your big ol' hopped-up DIPA."
"drinkability and mouthfeel were average. nice beer overall - but nothing to write home about."
"Hops may have been lost as this one aged in the bottle. I see from the description that this is a summer brew that I'm sampling in March. I will definitely search this one out fresh to resample."
"Recommended..."
"Got a bomber of this for $5.99 on a recommendation. Poured a solid copper-amber color with a nice off-white head that left tons of lacing with both pours. Nose is fairly mild, some caramel malt and dry hops. Taste is similar, a lot milder than any other DIPA I've tried. Caramel malt comes through first, oddly enough, and then the piney hops show up. Feel is fairly average, medium body with good carbonation. Overall, this one's alright, although for the style it's a bit of a weakling. I'm not sure why they don't just call this one a regular old IPA. At 7.5% ABV, it's right in the higher IPA range."
"Pours a crisp orange with a nice frothy lasting head that leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet malts and subtle caramel over citrus hops. The hops come through strong in the taste, earthy citrus with a wonderful lingering finish. The beer is medium bodied with some warming alcohol present. This one is a very enjoyable sipper to say the least."
"D: The major lack of bitterness makes it more drinkable but I'd rather have the hops."
"22 oz. bomber - This is becoming one of my favorite IPA's. Good balance, certainly a bit towards the hoppy side. Fruity and smooth. I've enjoyed all of the Lagunitas beers I've tried so far (other than the cappucino stout). This pours a large foamy head, lots of grapefruit aromas jump out. Goes down easy, with a middleweight ABV (7.5), which is unusual in the IPA, double IPA, imperial IPA world."
"D - Truely a craptacular beer perfect for the hophead. Not a session style beer, but one can wish."
"Overall a real nice DIPA. Not an award winner but a very balanced andl hoppy brew. I have renewed respect for this one as it was very enjoyable. Drinkable any day of the week. Maybe my favorite Lagunitas regular rotation beer."
"Picked one up from Bev Mo. Poured a gorgeous crystal clear apricot, with excellent head and lacing. Smelled citrusy and piney with some tropical notes. This is not an in your face IPA. Other reviewers were wanting more out of this, but the gentle bitterness is a standout for me. Probably Simcoe and other gentle giants making this a VERY drinkable beer that still hits you with lots of hoppy goodness. Not the harsh grapefruit pith one comes to expect form the heavy duty IPA's. Very refreshing. I am very fond of this style, and consider it a trend in the making."
"D: Stood up very well to the Italian pasta dish I was having; definitely improved as the beer warmed up. Serve at about 50 deg F for best results. Flavor/aroma were very enjoyable; bitterness was right but the slight amount of astringency in the bitterness limited the score for this otherwise outstanding beer. Note that this won't keep me from drinking again when I get the opportunity."
"This could be a nice go to ipa, really don't view this one as an iipa though."
"D - I'd like to try another to see if my opinion changes...I'll re-review if I notice a difference."
"Cheers ot Lagunitas for making another welll balanced beer, that certainly was over the top, but not overwhelming."
"Drinkability: Great with food, especially cheddar cheese. Reminds me of a lot of other IIPA's, but doesn't quite live up to great ones."
"I was digging the fresh character and balance of this Double IPA right up until the end. Unfortunately I just couldn't shake the medicinal feel and it hurt the taste, mouthfeel, and drinkibility. Tone down the heat a little and this would have been a really solid choice given the price."
"D- Very drinkable. Wish I hadn't shared the rest. Wish I had another in the fridge."
"D:A pretty good IPA, certainly not the best or worst in my book"
"Drinkability- Although this brew is a little sweet (Im blaming it on the age because I dont remember it ever being this sweet) its still good. Its really fruity and approachable. Good beer that should be enjoyed fresh."
"Not too hard to put down. The sappy-ness encourages the process. All 22oz of this beer packs a wallop of an alcohol kick. Wow. Yeah. This beer will put you in a good place in a hurry. Definitely tasty."
"A classic West Coast IPA that is well-balanced and suitable for a wide variety of purposes, from sipping solo or drinking with food. The 7.50% ABV is amazingly well masked and, were it not for this, it would make for a great session beer. While I do love some of the more exXxtreme examples of this style, such as Ruination IPA, they're too in-your-face to serve as your """everyday beer""". But Maximus certainly could, especially if you have a healthy alcohol tolerance trained on strong Belgians."
"Maximus pours a clear copper liquid capped by a two finger head made of large bubbles. Sparse carbonation, and decent lacing. Smell is a relaxed piney hops over a definite sugary sweetness. Taste is similar in nature but way bigger in intensity. The pine aspects seem stronger and way more intense and bitter. Balancing sweetness is subdued with a sweet bread like flavor. Mouthfeel is dominated by the clean bitter pine. Dry. I found this to be an extremely enjoyable DIPA. No it wasn't a giant, but its well crafted and tasty."
"I plan on picking up a couple of these whenever I find them."
"The beer poured a beautiful golden hue with a white, half-inch head into a 12-oz pilsner glass. A very noticable hop aroma, with pine scent dominating. As expected, a big hop flavor with a fairly dry, slightly sweet finish. Nice lacing down the glass and a long-lasting hop bitterness coating the tongue and mouth - heavenly. A great beer - right up there with Kill Ugly Radio."
"Pours a basically clear orange/brown/amber. Nose is strong piney hops. Flavor is very hopped but let's say it's one step below a hop bomb. Long lasting aftertaste. Strong pine character. Feel is a bit syrupy on the liquid and good on the bubble. Drinkable, yes. But this one is kind of thick and might turn people off a bit with it's unique characteristics."
"Drinkability: Easy to enjoy. Perfectly aggressive."
"A safe, but quite tasty, Double IPA. Gives Stone's Ruination a run for it's money. Worth a shot, and was delicious with my goat cheese and spinach salad."
"This is my kind of IIPA, bigger malt profile to really bring out the hop nuances... I like alot and a great value in my opinion... This another brew that I always look over even though, I've had it dozens of times... I will try and enjoy it more often."
"Definitely one of the top IPAs out there."
"D - Second tasting is a winner."
"D: Pretty good. I enjoyed drinking this bottle."
"Yeah!!! I am in love with this beer. It pours a rich copper color with an off white head that is chunky and lasts down to the bottom of the mug. Its aroma is dank and grassy with sharp citrus notes that create a crisp overall perception. Caramel also creeps though in the nose. This beer is clear as hell, beautiful! For certian this beer is balanced to the side of bitter but a round bitterness it is indeed. What a great beer, crisp and easy drinking. Where is the alcohol? Dangerous in its drinkablity. My new favorite IIPA."
"Ol' reliable and a good friend when in need. When in doubt, you can find these Bombers right next to Arrogant Bastard now in most corner stores in NE PDX. For me a """Tried & True""" more bang for the buck bargain DIPA that always satisfies at the end of the week when funds are low. Somewhat slippery mouthfeel with that lil extra hop bite that every hop head's gotta have. This is my """hop fix""" bomber. Always willin' to come back for more. Thank you, Lagunitas Brewing."
"The drinkability is good, this is sessionable but not something to got seek out. MK"
"D- Great beer to have a couple of but like all double IPAs, it should be consumed with caution due to the higher alcohol content. I love this beer to finish my night, but even better to start it off when drinking IPAs all night. Support this brewery, Lagunitas is the next Stone!"
"d: well i'm drinking it just after i went running..though mainly because of that recent thread about drinking a beer after exercise. it's quite drinkable, though wouldn't say it would be a good session beer. definitely a pleasure to drink though."
"over all this is an awesome aipa."
"This is easy to drink and easy to buy as well at $3.99 a bomber."
"D- I can't really say anything bad about this, but it is not really a stand-out beer. For the price, I can definitely see myself getting this again. Check this out."
"22 ounce bottle. Served in a snifter, the beer pours an orange/copper color with a half inch off-white head. Very nice citrusy, grapefruity hoppy aroma stands out, with some malt noticable too. Taste is mostly citrus and piney hops, and some bready malt. There's a also good lingering hoppy bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit oily and dry. Drinkability is good, it goes down easy and the alcohol isn't very noticable. Overall I think it's a good, solid DIPA. It's not the best in the style, but for the price it's a pretty good deal. I'd definitely pick this up again."
"This beer looks better then it tastes. It is a nice apricot color with a small head that fades quick. It is lightly carbonated which is kind of nice. It smells of citrus and is kind of earthy. It tastes like it smells, and is kind of unimpressive. I can barely make out the hops in this IPA. It is good for those who like ales and want to start down the path to real IPA's."
"Finish is slightly dry and bittersweet. Alcohol is faintly perceived in the background. Overall a solid and sessionable DIPA."
"Drinkability is good at 7.5%, though it at times tastes like a stronger beer than it is. To me, this is the epitome of a straight 4 beer. A good drinker. It doesn't wow me, but I find little fault with it either. Plus, it's a little cheaper than comparable quantities of DFH 90 Minute or Great Divide Hercules. That said, it lacks the complexity and depth of 90 Minute, and the tongue-scraping hop character of Hercules or Ruination. Still, a good simple IIPA that I'll reach for again."
"Light bodied and smooth. The refreshing hops constantly battle with th apparent alcohol. Otherwise a pretty nice beer."
"Overall, not a bad beer but at $8.50 a bomber, I won't be bothering with it again."
"A decent DIPA. I am glad i tried it, but it is not my favorite. I'm not struggling to get this bomber down, but I dont want another Maximus. I hope Lagunitas' other IPAs are better as I have 2 more in my fridge."
"A good ipa worth a try!"
"D  Would enjoy this at a sitting for a few bottles at a sitting but would soon want an alternative after tiring of the grapefruit aftertaste"
"Mouthfeel doesn't stand out much one way or another for me. Med body seems to fit right in line. Quite drinkable relative to abv. I expected more from the brew the first time I had it and decided to give it another shot and was reminded of the fact that it's a really good beer that has some great counterparts."
"Another excellent offering from Lagunitas. Definitely looking forward to more from this brewery."
"Drinkability is definitely average at best. While I compare the Maximus favorably with the Stone Ruination in all other characteristics, I think it is lacking the smoothness and drinkability of the Ruination. While this is the last beer of the night, I think even if it were the first I wouldn't be going back for more."
"This brew pored nice and smooth with cool hop aromas- slightly citric, with a little less malt than usual. Taste was big and fruity in hop flavors- grapefruit, some sour piney characteristics as well. The flavors are a little flat, but the hops are assertive in their bitterness. Mouthfeel was somewhat thin and the alcohol was hidden but came out as it warmed. There is little intesity within the flavors, the lack of malts to balance and create an interesting interaction is noticeable. This was a run of the mill DIPA, but certainly a good brew"
"Recommended"
"Overall, a solid beer. Taste is what I expect from a DIPA minus the hop intensity. Mouthfeel needs to be fuller."
"The taste does not let me down. Has a hoppy grapefruit like bite and a sweet malty flavour with a clean but bitter lingering finish. A great beer I cant wait to go and by more."
"This is what I think of when I think American IPA. A simple, yet solid malt profile, combined with tons of grapefruit hoppiness ( (assuming cascades), makes it a powerful, yet dangerously drinkable beer. Done to perfection."
"Although I found this beer disappointing, I must note that I finished every last swallow even though a mosquito kamikazied into my glass as I neared the end. I did get a new glass for #2, however."
"D: At 7.5, it's not sessionable, but it's a bit easier than some other DIPAs to put back with some other beers. Not my favorite, but a decent example of the style. Definitely worth a try."
"pours a hazy golden brown, with a initial thick head that leaves some good lacing. The smell is mostly citrus bittering hops, with some doughy yeast. The taste mimics the smell with a good dose of citrus hops, with some piney and yeastiness worked into it. Drinable for the style at 7.5%. Overall, a pretty good Dipa, defiantly good for the $4.50 a bomber price however, not my favorite of the highly populated style"
"A nice IPA with classic Lagunitas quality."
"Maximus pours a light copper color with a white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is all hops, grapefruit and citrus come to mind. A similar flavor profile emerges, hops, particularly citrus and grapefruit like flavors dominate. Not bad for an IPA, a little wimpy for a double IPA."
"Rather sweet finish and well-balanced. Solid."
"Nicely balanced, but I expected more, doesn't quite stand up to other DIPAs."
"Pours a golden orange color with a white head. The aroma is sweet malt with a good dose of American hops. The taste is malt up front with a nice punch from the hops that deliver a nice long bitter finish. Overall, this is a really nice DIPA that is recommended for any hop heads."
"That said, I enjoyed all three ales, and will doubtlessly return to the brewery. Next up: The Kronic. I mean, ... Censored."
"22oz bottle. Pours a clear copper with noticeable carbonation. Bountiful aroma of hops. Really nice smell. First taste is a feel of that carbonation, which quickly gives way to some nice hoppiness, though it doesn't stack up to some of the best IIPAs (e.g. Ruination). It was a nice beer all the way through, but I was left hoping for a wee bit more."
"Got a bomber from Binny's. Ended up trying this at a little warmer that what I would like, but I don't think it will affect my rating. Quite a bit of head, hazy copper color. Full bodied, leaving a slick palate. High malt profile, nice bittering on the back end; no bee-sting nectar but still good. Tons of lacing which caked in rings down the glass. Faint aroma on this. This is good for sipping or slamming, so the drinkability is high on this. High alcohol content is not noticable. I actually thought this was their IPA (first offering I've tried from these guys.) But it is thier IIPA, they state it's their IPA upgraded about 30%. Good but not overwhelming. Then I thought why does it have to be big; it's very smooth, so my criticalness ended up melting away."
"D: A great drinkable Double IPA, Lagunitas makes great stuff, a company I will continue to buy from in the future, I have not been disappointed by them thus far."
"Pours an orangeish copper color with an off-white head. In the aroma was grapefruity hops, but very suttle. In the taste, again grapefruity hops, yet small, and a sweet malt. It has a hoppy dry end, and a smooth feel to it. Very easy to drink, hoppy, yet nicely balanced."
"Poured into my new SA glass. Amber orange color with two fingers of fluffy head. Lots of chunks floating around. Smell of floral and citrus hops with some sweetness underneath. Slight apricot in the background. Citrus hop flavors, grapefuit juice. Pale malt flavors, slightly bready. Fairly good balance. Medium body, finishes with a tangy dryness. Good brew, but mild in comparison to many of its peers."
"There's your standard grapefruit, but also I found some cantelope and mango, which I found a tad interesting. It was firm and warm feeling. Pretty standard DIPA, and that's not a bad thing."
"The color was great. Too many light colored IPAs that day and this was quite striking. The fragrance was quite nice and floral/citrus. This is always my favorite part of a DIPA. Strong bitter flavor, with a lighter floral that I demand from a DIPA. Also no sweet finish as I have come to expect form the style."
"Pleasantly surprised with Lagunitas. Not the best big IPA, but definitely worth the price."
"For the style this is a very, very good beer but a little too much pine & alcohol warmth for my preference, as it interferes some with the drinkability for me."
"For a 7.5% DIPA, this is a pretty good one. The hops are big on grapefruit, with a deep perfume tang and hints of less acidic fruit like apricot. The aroma is a bit weak, and the flavor isn't the most complex, but those are only minor defects if you will. This is still a nice, big American DIPA."
"Bottle. Poured a clear amber color with a medium white head. Good lacing. Aroma of citrus and pine, with a little caramel to it. Flavor is citrus with a strong bitter finish. A pretty good double IPA, but nothing I need to go out of my way to get. Wish they sold it in Kansas, but I won't call my distributor to have them bring it here."
"This is a simple, lovely IPA with no harshness, stickyness, or hefty malt. It has a nice light, grippy, mouthfeel with a fizzy lift from the carbonation and this is about as drinkable as they come. I am very impressed with balance and drinkability achieved here but for a beer claiming double IPA, it just doesn't wiegh in. Theres no oomph. There's not really double anything as far as my mouth is concerned."
"D- enjoyable, not a session brew, solid 2IPA, seriously a hop bitchslap, recommended for hopheads, probably scare anyone else"
"There are better tasting IPA's so this one is better left for just the one try and not sessioning."
"a very nice dipa. had this on-tap at chef paul's in lisle. served in a chalice. this was a nice slightly hazy amber in color with a creamy off-white head and lacing. notable aromas of citrus and resiny pine. taste was a moderate sweetness with a long, bitter finish. medium to full-bodied. drinkability is good as this is on the lower end of abv for a dipa but it delivers as much in flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel as some of the dipa abv monsters."
"It feels thick and even a bit bubbly. Leaves a bitter film at the very end. Boy does that bitterness keep a'comin'. A strong Imperial IPA, yet quite drinkable; a feat in itself."
"Overall, recommended. However, this beer would have rated higher had they classified this as a single IPA. For the style, it falls a bit short. For an IPA, this is solid."
"The bottle revealed a bit more about the beer than the tap. The beer falls short of D!PA but stands firm as a standard IPA. The aromas leap from the bottle with juicy gapefruit, orange, lemon, pine, and light malts. The pour delivers a strong straw / golden color with airy head retention. The flavors reinforce the citrus aromas and add a lot of peppery spices to the taste. Firm bitterness rises toward the finish. A light metalic note lingers throughout the flavors. Body is light against the flavors; but makes for easy drinking. The beer has an evaporative, chalky effect going into the finish, compounding the alcohols and hop character. Again, good, but no double."
"Pours an orangey golden with a big billowing head. Smell is sweet malts and citrus/pine hops. Taste is sweet malts followed by mild bitter hops that lend some citric and earthy tones. Aftertaste is on the bitter side. Taste is fine, but this one doesn't drink easily, it takes some effort. Good DIPA, not great. I would drink it again."
"Low alcohol (for the style) makes this guy a little more drinkable, but I'm not too impressed by the hop bill. It's big enough, but not very nuanced... overly bitter and nothing too exciting. Just about average for an I2PA."
"Very tasty, would happily drink again."
"The folks at Lagunitas have made one very drinkable DIPA. Will definitely have again."
"D- high, the bitterness rolls over the tongue but fades a little quickly making you want to drink it immediately again"
"Medium-bodied and shows decent complexity. Never quite gets to overwhelming to drink--but almost. A solid brew for hop-heads."
"22oz bottle poured into a pint glass. This beer pours a clear amber/orange with a thick foamy beige head that lasts. Some nice heavy lacing is left behind. The aroma is very citrusy along with a good dose of toffee and caramel. The flavor is mainly grapefruit and caramel. The are also notes of pine and bread. Flavor is well balanced. Finish is lightly bitter and quick. The mouthfeel is just slightly oily/resiny with a bit of carbonation. Medium-bodied. Very well done. My only complaint might be that it is not quite strong enough to hold up against other doubles."
"Very cool--burnt orange color w/ gold highlights--pretty in the glass. Good lace but head fell flat after a very high pile of off white foam was served. Strong nose--grapefruit in your face--clena and strong. Clearly bitter on the taset but a hint of the oily flavore, light fruit w/ spice, almost like the interplay of sweet and sour sauce, but fruit and spice. Good, fun pint."
"One of the most drinkable double IPAs around here... but I just call it an IPA."
"D: Very good beer, nicely balanced. I think a person who loves hops would love this beer as would a person who leans more toward malty beers."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied and lightly carbonated. It's smooth and sessionable in my book. I could drink this all night. Overall, very impressive."
"Pours a hazy dark orange with a large off-white head forming quickly and lasting very well, with some good lacing left behind. Herbal hops dominate, with plenty of pine and citrus showing as well. Light yeasty note. Taste is hoppy, to be sure, but doesn't quite kick me the way a DIPA ought to. Opens with the floral/herbal bouquet, which gives way slowly to a citrus finish, with a long grapefruit kiss lingering on the palate. Malts are pretty nondescript, and don't quite provide the needed depth with a milder DIPA like this one. Mouthfeel is good, nice body and plenty of carbonation, and drinkability is excellent. Good beer, though not quite the over-the-top-hops that the """double""" label promises."
"Pours a very nice clear orange with a frothy, off-white head. The smell is quite unique and intriguiing to me - a very piney nose with hints of citrus (lemon?). The taste is almost medicinally sweet up front with a pronounced pine hop finish that is more aromatic than bitter. A nice crispness on the end keeps the beer from being either cloying or harshly bitter. Very well balanced and interesting, but perhaps not my favorite in flavor profile"
"I think this bottle has some age, but the effects are positive. There's the same pine tar sort of hop nose that I recall, but it is muted somewhat -- just a touch. What I really dig about this particular bottle is the tobacco leaf sort of hoppy dryness. This flavor comes on top of the toasted malt that puts the blast of spicy and piney hops in balance. The mouthfeel is smooth and adds to the appeal. There's a good smack of bitterness in the finish. The body isn't as dense as some other strong IPAs. This Lagunitas beer aren't that complicated, but they are tasty."
"A: Amber orange, head that falls pretty quickly, lots of lacing. S: Piney hops up front, sweet citrus, pineapple, some floral notes. T: Lots of hops, a lot of fruit taste in here...pineapple, grapefruit, strawberry...especially in the finish. The hops are pretty well balanced with the sweeter notes. M: Pretty moderate all around, not too thick, not too thin. Moderate to high carbonation. D: It's a pretty nice beer, though I think the citrus is a litte overpowering. I might buy it again."
"22 oz. Bottle. Red and gold color. Not quite amber, not quite orange. Unique color and nice to just look at. White head looked like a small cauliflower. Lots of faint aromas, but hops dominated. Despite the high alcoholic content it drank very well. The last drop was as good as the first drop. This one is a real winner. Since I first rated this I have had a chance to rate many more beers and ales, and so I decided to go back and have another 22 oz bottle. I simply have to raise my rating a little. What makes this so very good in my opinion is great balance."
"Overall, this beer is a fantastic value. A 22 oz. bottle for $3.50 (at least at my distributor) will keep me coming back when I'm looking to not spend too much. Sure, there are plenty of better IPAs out there, but as far as value, this is a great choice."
"an outstanding brew and a good session beer for a hop-head but pay attention to the alcohol content.."
"Clearly one for the hop connoiseur...not the most extreme of the hoppy beers, but a relatively unique one and one that does something interesting with the mighty flowering vine."
"Pours a blazing orange with a thick, creamy white head. Huge citrus hops on the nose with grapefruit and pine. Great bitterness with the usual West Coast IPA charactoristics. Finishes with a mild alcohol burn. For such a big beer, it's very light and crisp. So heavy on the hops, maybe a one or two maximum for Maximus."
"D - Pretty great. Worth a try. A delicious hoppy beer and it smells amazing. I am going to have to have this again when I live closer to Lagunitas next year."
"A must-try for hop heads."
"A nice West Coast IPA, it's got a great copper color with a ton of lace after the head settles. The smell is fantastic, and the taste has a really pleasant bitterness. A good beer within a great style. One of my favorites to drink, I'm glad it's now sold in 6 packs here in Connecticut and not just Bombers."
"D: Great taste, but difficult to do a whole 20 oz. This is sharp and bitter, but still amazing flavor."
"This beer poured a cloudy dark amber color and formed an off white foamy white head that slowly subsided, leaving laticed lace on the glass. The aroma was of hops, citrus, pine and a touch of caramel. The flavor was of citrus, pine and caramel. It had a medium light body with a slight creamy aspect to the the bittersweet finish. A touch sweeter than I like my ipas, but a very good beer."
"Nice crisp carbonation and medium body. Decent beer, and of a style I love, so I'm sure I'll have it again. Went down very easily - this is one where though the flavor isn't addictive, I could still drink a lot of it. Probably deserves a slightly higher score, but I can't quite bring myself to give it straight 4's."
"Overall a nice Double IPA, not amazing though. I have had """single""" IPAs that were packed with more hop flavor. Good for a grocery store buy."
"A decent enough brew to drink a bunch of, but nothing to spectacular when it comes to the Dbl IPA's I tend to favor. Perhaps a little short lived and underwhelming for my tastes. But pretty solid. It won't be a problem drinking more."
"Lagunitas Maximus pours a slightly hazy light copper with a thick sticky head that leaves a thick ring of lacings marking every sip on the glass. Aroma is light, sweet malt and heavy citrusy hops. Taste is very bitter, but nicely rounded with malty sweetness, more so than I expected at 7.5%. The hops are citrusy, orange and grapefruit with some herbal flavor. I love the simple label and quote on the side of the bottle!"
"Poured a very hazy bright orange with a big billowing white pillow like head and a slow fade leaving a nice lace down the sides. Smel was sweet, with a big citrus hop presence. Lots of orange, pineapple and tangerine flavors, balanced nicely with hints of carameled sugar and a touch of alcohol. The taste was very nice, warm, with lots of hoppy bite. Very smooth, and no real hint of alcohol whatsoever. This was very nice and a definate keeper, good solid IIPA and something I would definatly wanna have again!"
"This Lagunitas brew poured a dark rusted copper color with a glimmer of sunshine yellow at the bottom of the beer. It had a small quarter of an inch head of white foam that quickly dissipated away into a few white and foamy rings and a spatter of fizzy white bubbles that acted as its lace. The aroma was a bit on the light side featuring some citrus hops, a pine tree, a pinch of caramel malts, and some grapefruit that had some orange zest behind it. When it warms up a bit, a slight aroma of sweet juicy fruits emerges from the background. For something they say is brewed with hops, malt, hops, hops, yeast, hops water, and hops, it's actually quite tame in the bitter department. It was hoppy, but not that hoppy. Behind the tame citrus hops is some pine, grapefruit, and some toasted malt. It only had a small aftertaste of citrus hops and pine. This has to be one of lightest DIPA I've had so far. In the massive world of IPAs, this one needs to stick out a little more because it's easily forgettable in that world. In you want to get into the world of DIPAs or any kind of IPAs, then you should start off with this one, due to it being a very mild IPA or DIPA. For me, this one is enough. I doubt I'd buy this Lagunitas brew again."
"Easy drinking for a double or a big IPA....maybe it's more of a Double IPA, Jr. Forget styles...it's a fine ale worth your time and money to experience."
"It's a good example of the style, but there's nothing that makes it stand out."
"This is just as mediocre of an Double IPA as the single ipa is. There are much better DIPA's out there, try it out of curiosity but i believe the 3.95 overall is over rated"
"Still a solid brew"
"Notes: I'd say this is on the lighter side of DIPAs, but not by much. Enjoyable, but I prefer a tad bit more malt backbone with this style. Would probably be a good summer-drinking DIPA as it is lighter than others and with an almost lemonade-like bitter/tart finish to it."
"On tap at Lucky Balwins in Pasadena, CA. Poured a nice clear orange with a pretty dense head that had some staying power. Smell was very strickly pine. Taste was lots of citrus with a strong pine finish, and a lingering bitter pine aftertaste. This wasn't a syrupy DIPA. Had a good mouthfeel, still around medium but on the lighter side. Drinkability is good except that alcohol gets to ya."
"M/D- Medium bodied and slightly on the thick side for the style.... I really think that it is easy to drink and does not come off too spicy...I look forward to the six pack release of this one and once again I am very pleased with what Lagunitas has to offer."
"Mouthfeel is decidely medium for the style, IMO. Good carbonation, nice tongue-coating quality. A bit thin, but it works, I suppose. Overall, though, the beer is a bit too much pine and not enough fruit or floral. Don't get me wrong, the hop slam finish is great, but its a bit one note. The beer's got a lot going for it, but it needs some tweaking to bring the whole thing together."
"For the price and availability here in Southern California- its hard to beat."
"I like hops, but this one borders metallic and lopsided. Between that and the sharp alcohol, it is somewhat of a chore to drink. Not bad, but not nearly one of my favorite DIPA's."
"It has a slight copper color, with a small head. A nice aroma with a hint of citrus. A crisp hops flavor. The after taste is a grapefruit with a slight metallic-ness to it."
"I don't know what to think about this. You can tell by my above review that I found this hard to finish and wonderfully bitter slugger all in one. An experience to say the least, like High Gravity Malt Liquors only at the other end. If I could rate with question marks, I would."
"Pours a golden copper hue with slight haze. Dense three finger head shows outstanding retention and leaves beautiful spiderweb lacing. The hop aroma is a blend of fruity Cascade and Chinook; with matching Simcoe pine needle. Some crystal and pilsener malt aromas loom in the background. Toasty pale malt and light caramel make up the sweet side of a very hoppy beer and for a brief moment the malt commands the flavor, then a barrage of american hops storm the taste buds - abrasively balancing the overall charater. Lemon, orange, and grapefruit-rind tones meet pine sap and grass clippings. But it never overwhelms; the aftertaste is drying- but more of a showcase of hop character than senseless IBU's. Medium-body and mild carbonation accentuate the oily mouthfeel and allow a residual sweetness to accompany the delicious hop resins that coat the tounge. The drinkability of this beer really shines; a Barleywine-caliber complexity that you can knock back like a session IPA."
"I've always thought of Lagunitas as a """sleeper""" brewery - decent craft beers at macro prices, or less!"
"I saw some 12oz bottles of Maximus for the first time and thought what the hell. The color was a clear orange with a decent white head. The smell had a caramel aspect to it but no hops that I could detect. The taste was very balanced, almost too balanced for an IPA. I don;t think this beer was hoppy at all. The alcohol was very well hidden. At $9 a sixer I would never purchase this again. I keep buying Lagunitas beers and being disappointed. I think the only one I like is Gnarleywine. Thumbs down on Maximus."
"It is only now that I see that this is a summer release and could therefore be up to nine months removed from its freshest state. That would account for the surprisingly mellow hop profile. I considered not reviewing it for this reason, but declined because A) I feel I was deceived (there's no date and the bottle says """unlimited release""") and B) It's pretty good. It's no hop monster at this stage in its life, but instead is a well-balanced and drinkable IPA. Big time hopheads should wait until summer for the fresh stuff (as I indeed plan on doing), but otherwise, I'd definitely recommend it now."
"22oz bomber poured aggressively into a tulip glass, one finger of fluffy off white head developed with good retention and leaving cumpy lacing. The body is a glowing red amber with shades of peach, gold, rust and a hint of blood. Smells is at first hops right in the kettle, grape fruit, grass, pine, sour orange juice, the underlying hints of malt are there as it warms, but they are completely overshadowed by hop aroma. Taste is slightly astringent with light citrus notes not unsimilar to bitter orange juice from concentrate. Malt is present but only in that it provides for the grounds for hop to work, although Id personally like a bit more fruit complexity from the hops. The flavor coats the tongue and lingering on the side of the cheeks. I enjoy this, but I find it just another in the long line of enjoyable IPA/ double IPA. Personally I need a little more to woo me. Good beer, very solid, just not quite what I hoped for, but worth a try."
"Notes - The temperature was the cause for the haze first noticed in this beer. Sitting with it for about an hour in front of the TV cleared it up very nicely - enough so that I could read through it. If a good, strong, highly-hopped beer is what you are looking for, Maximus will do the trick. A bomber of this is much more easily put down than some of the higher octane DIPA's out there. There was something about the hop flavor that threw me off a little bit tonight though, maybe a little bit of a lemony sourness? It could have just been that my taste was off tonight though - this was a good, highly-hopped, bitter Northwest IPA."
"[insert sigh of relief and contentment here]"
"12 oz. bottle- color of Honey, with a lingering off white head - nose of hopps , grapefruit , some lemon / lime , and floral  taste of bitter hops , citrus , sweet , and malts  not that hoppy for a double but a good taste for a ipa - body is silky , low acidity , and medium to low carbonation  aftertaste of citrus , grapefruit , and semi sweet"
"Advertised as an imperial IPA, I can see where it has a few shortcomings. But given the relative cost for its flavor, i'd rate it very highly. The hop is not as aggressive as i'd like for an 'imperial,' but it is quite flavorful; good citrus hop with a strong malt balance. It might be more appropriate in the IPA category, but I challenge anyone (at least based on Chicagoland beer prices) to find a comparable flavor for its price. Highly recommended as a good value."
"This AIPA is relatively complex for the style. The hops are sharp while the malt still shows its characteristics. In other worlds, the hops don't dominate like they normally do. Highly recommended."
"I highly recommend this for hops lovers."
"D- Strong but short hoppy finish makes this quite a drinkable ale; I join with other reviewers' doubts of this being a true DIPA, it just is a little too simple with rather underwhelming hops compared to other DIPAs"
"Beautiful looking brew, with a pillowy head, and lacing all the way through. Doesn't smell like much, is a golden color. The first sip produces some nice, almost caramely malts up front, very pleasant, then it gets harsh. Seems a tad bit unbalanced. The hops linger in the aftertaste, making it hard for me to drink. But it tastes good and is worth a try, for sure."
"Purchased this in a 22oz bottle, poured into imperial pint glass. Pours a very clear copper color with a fluffy white head. Leaves lots of lacing on the glass as it slowly recedes. Aroma is initially very hoppy, with a vague citrusy flavor and malty sweetness follows. Not a lot of hop flavor, but this one is very bitter. This beer is medium bodied. Overall, I think the perceived bitterness really takes away from the drinkibility. The doesn't seem to be enought malt to balance it out, or flavor to keep it interesting."
"I'm a big fan here. I'm drawn to the balance. I enjoy a fresh hopped IPA too, but i could imagine spending a Saturday afternoon with a couple of these guys. The other draw to me is the price. The fact that Lagunitas can pull this off the what i paid is attractive to me. I'm comforted by the fact that i might be able to afford to enjoy their products for a while. That looks like it's taking this one to the top of my list too."
"Had a taster at the Strong Beer festival. Poured a deep gold color. Plenty of cascade hops, grapefruit aroma. Little head but could have been because of dirty glass. Probably not the most refreshing beer to drink on an 80 degree warm winter day but I am sure that a fresh pint or two would go down nicely in the evening. Body was pretty good. It was one of the few beers at the fest that made a lasting impression on me."
"D - Good drinkability. Tasty IPA -- I am not to sure about it being a Double IPA though."
"Taste is a sharp bitter bite with crisp green apples and and a slight citrus malt. Some pine and butter. It might be a too bitter for some. Mouthfeel is bubbly and lush. Drinkability is very good- while I can't taste the booze, it's definitely moderating the uber-bitterness, as I could easily down this bomber without much thought."
"Overall a good beer - not as hoppy as I'd like my IPAs."
"Had this many times before & got to sample against some other similar DIPA's. It was my 2nd of 6 offerrings. A very drinkable DIPA."
"This is ver hoppy to begin with, as you'd expect from a DIPA. Slight alcohol finish. Bit of a sweet, candied taste, orange taste. The orange taste reminded me of the peel from orange chicken you might get at a Chinese restuarant. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth, after the initial onslaught of hops in the beginning. Although there is a bit of maltiness towards the end, the citrusy hops win out. Maybe a bit heavy on the hops overall, but a decent DIPA in the end."
"Ordered some of this over the internet. It's a decent DIPA but there are plenty of other ones out there better than this one."
"While not an """oh my God""" in today's beer world, a solidly well done big IPA."
"Bomber bottle. When I first had this, maybe a year or so ago, it was one of my early entree's into DIPA. I have been through many of the best of the best and utterly love DIPA. Coming back to this for a sampling, it's good but not up there with the best of them. Mild aroma and much more mild hop. I have been turning alot of my friends on to DIPA and I find this a good entry step."
"Pity...Lagunitas is a wonderful big brewer and this one is close, but it misses the mark, IMHO"
"Pours a slightly hazed amber color with a cream colored head that leaves some nice sheets of lacing on my glass. Aroma is of citrusy hops, fruit, and a little malt. Taste is sharp citrus and a little fruity and caramelly. Mouthfeel is medium to full, pretty smooth, but finishes extremely dry making me want a glass of water to go alongside. Ok Double IPA."
"Poured into a snifter--crystal clear copper that maintains a 1/2 inch white head, cap-sized bubbles with sticky lacing. The nose is subtle--your a-typical juicy hops, grapefruit and some biscuity malts. An oily sliding affect of bitter hops, very laid back for the style. Tender malt-based backbone with some carbonation. Come and go orange peel and lemon zestiness; creamy hopped-up palated. I am a hops-head, my name is Geoff. And this failed to live up to the reputation of a DIPA. Call it an IPA and you're fine."
"Pours a nice dark amber with a light tan head that starts out thick and leaves decent lacing. The smell is of spicy and fruity hops with stone fruit predominating. The taste is grainy with a good malt background and with a pronounced grapefruit pith bitterness thats balanced by all the malt. Definitely a maltier version than most dipas. The mouthfeel is a little thick and grainy, it feels substantial in your mouth. This hurts the drinkability a bit, as it definitely fills you up. Still a solid beer, and for the price a great value."
"D-pretty good but a little hoppy to drink more than 2. 7.5%, low for a double could help this along to a 3rd if the taste buds get deadened after the fisrt 2"
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a beige/yellow color ale with a medium bubbly head with average retention. Aroma of C-hops is quite powerful with lots of citrus and floral notes. Taste is quite bitter with huge citrus and floral hops with a big grassy feel. Malt is more subdued then I would have liked it with limited caramel. Body is about average with medium carbonation. Good take on the style but it is missing something (malt?) to make it truly great."
"Poured a slightly hazed orangish gold color with very little head and lacing. Smells of brown sugar with some light hop aroma. Taste of thick syrup malts with some citrus hop bitterness. Not as bitter as thought it would be and a bit too sweet and syrupy for me to drink more than one. The second Lagunitas brew I've found to be a unique and some what of an acquired taste."
"The appearance was aweful because all I could see was brown glass as I walked this one home in the upright position. Smells like a fresh bag of kind hops. Tastes green, summerlike, an afternoon in the woods behind my parents house as a teenager. This is the beer that got me into hoppy beers about five years ago. I was more of a Belgian/ German beer guy then. This beer can cure a bad day at work if you pair it up with a Ford F150 and REO Speedwagon."
"Definitely drinkable!"
"Overall this is a very drinkable DIPA"
"This is a very nice IPA. Complex hop profile is well matched with a solid malty base that is just as interesting. I will have this one again."
"Pretty good DIPA. Poured a wonderful chestnut colour with a lovely looking snow white head. Thick sticky lacing stuck like glue to the edges of the glass. Moderate level of CO2 bubbles streaming skyward. Looks nice. Smell was very citrusy with powerful hops dominating. Taste, too, was all hops with colossal bitterness!! Almost no malt detectable at all. Mouthfeel was a little better than average. All in all, a very nice DIPA, though still not my favourite."
"D - Nice flavor without a highly alcoholic taste or effect. Could probably enjoy another bomber without growing tired of this brew."
"Maybe it's not as maximal as the appelation Maximus might mandate, but it makes a more than marginal foray into the land of hop happiness. It's a well-blended, if quite basic, mix of good, sound elements. The ABV is just big enough to provoke a care, though it's in no way a show-stopper. So it's not as bold as the name might indicate, but it's enjoyable no matter its relative size."
"A Very drinkable and good Double, just a little less intense than most."
"Slightly sticky mouthfeel. Carbonation is well moderated. Not remarkably drinkable, but a good and interesting beer."
"Finishes normally, very drinkable stuff."
"An above average example of an above average style. Kudos to Lagunitas."
"Overall- for a double IPA this was soo smooth. No strong alcohol to ruin it. The flavor stayed solid throughout. Delicious!!"
"A nice beer overall. Very nice with a chedder cheese plate. Flavor of pine is not for everyone but if you are a fan then pick one up and enjoy a very decent offering."
"D-Easy and deceptively smooth. Easy session pint for a rocker night."
"The mid palate had hints of grapefruit and just enough malt to have a backbone. If your a hophead this beer is a must try."
"Drinkability: This one wasn't for me. Thin to a fault, and the malt flavor could be more distinct."
"Overall, it seems like this beer may have slipped, or maybe I got an old poorly stored version."
"D- a very drinkable DIPA, goes down easily, a good introductory DIPA (at least for me it was) have bought/drank a few times, an enjoyable brew"
"A very tastey beer,a must try double IPA."
"Drinkability is okay. Beer started out okay but the weak flavor and thinner mouthfeel don't make this stand out much. Starts to sit kinda heavy on the stomach after a while. Nothing overtly bad about this one, but a bit understated in the flavor department. Worth a shot though at 3.99/bomber."
"Pours a cloudy orange under a one finger pale tan head that fades slowly but manages only a few spots of lace. Fairly mild coniferous hops nose at first, but growing as it warms. Floral notes emerge later, making it more enticing. The mouth is well-carbonated and quite heavy, although not sticky. Solid espresso and pine bitter opening, moderated by a bit of sweet malt, which grew as the session continued. The pine and espresso dominate throughout, however, lasting well into the aftertaste, which is dry as the desert. Very pleasant and inviting."
"Overall: A decent Double IPA. It's definitely very hoppy, which I sometimes find to be overpowered by malts in DIPAs. Not the best, but good nonetheless."
"Not bad, but not the best I've had."
"Body just touches medium and seems to thin as it warms, it has all the flavor, just not enough body to support it. Mouthfeel clean, creamy, and gently carbonated. Absolutely drinkable for an IIPA."
"Taste is full of hops as described above, but the maltiness is creamier than it smelled. A bit candy-like and perhaps a little too much, but still good. Alcohol takes on a spicy, boozy character that I think is slightly out of place, especially with a brew that is 7.5%. Granted, that's fairly high, but it can be easily disguised or blended with the other flavors instead of standing out so much. Still, it's good to drink and it leaves the mouth feeling happy."
"This is a very good IPA. It has some interesting flavors that come together very well. The hops character in this IPA is very refreshing and clean. The malt is mellow but ties it all together nicely. Recommended."
"Had never heard of Lagunitas, and just picked this up at Greens. Damn glad I did. Poured to the expected golden orange with thick off-white head that stuck around for the whole glass, and left excellent lacing. Aroma was very hoppy citrus, mostly grapefruit and lemons, and taste was more of the same. Palate was very bitter and dry, but with a hint of sweet malt. I had the bomber, and drank it slowly, so that at the end, I was beginning to feel the effects of the 7.5% alcohol. This was a most excellent beer, and I hope to try more."
"D- As one of my first forrays into DIPA's, I didn't think I would ever like them after this one. I have heard some say this is more IPA but I think you guys are nuts and need to give your palate a break. 72 IBU's is damn high. I will have to share my last bottle as I know I couldn't finish it."
"Was pysched that Lagunitas beers finally showed up in Georgia. Kind of a let-down, though. Heavy hop aroma with orange, resin. Creamy head that mostly lasted. Expected much more hoppiness as this is 72 IBU's. This was more like a West Coast IPA, rather than a DIPA. The palate was surprisingly soft."
"A tasty IPA, all the way around."
"Pours deep clear copper with slow carbonation. A half inch of creamy thin off-white head that lowers to a small blanket and thin lace. Aromatic with simple but pleasant resins and pine-like hops. Creamy rounded body with light carbonation. Straightforward flavors; toasty biscuit malts, a bit of caramel, piney and leafy hops. Not overwhelming, but well balanced and easy-drinking."
"D - Definitely an earthy hoppy resiny DIPA. Very good but I would like to see how this one tastes with some age on it."
"Not bad but not as wild as Lagunitas will have you believe."
"D-This, like I stated earlier, is an amazing brew. Just perfect blend of flavors. Great bitterness with a good flavor to it. Just great all around. Love it."
"This maybe one of the most drinkable double IPAs on the market-it isn't over- powering-allows for drinking more of the Maximus than other Douple IPAs."
"D - Drinkable. A tasty DIPA from Lagunitas."
" I found this to be quite enjoyable. There is nothing to be feared here. Hops are definitely in there, but nothing too overwhelming. Drinkable, hell yes."
"12 oz. stubby with no freshness date but the label tells me it has 72.41 IBUs. The beer has a clear, dark copper body and a finger of tan head that leaves some lacing. It smells of white grapefruit with a malty background and hints of tropical fruits and apricot. There is a big bitterness with a good malt backing and flavors of leafy/green hops, apricot, biscuity malts, faint tropical fruit, lingering hop oils, and a sweetness that creeps in near the end. It has a sturdy mouthfeel that is lightly numbing and drying, with prickly carbonation that seems almost artificial on top of a medium body that has a fairly long finish. Overall it's tasty enough, but the mouthfeel is a bit awkward, as it took an hour for the carbonation to smooth out enough to be tolerable."
"Pours a hazy, dark amber garnet with a moderately sized frothy head that dissipated rather quickly. A mix of piney and herbal hops hit up front first with citrus bringing up the rear in the mix. I get a good balance of malt with caramel aromas doing a good job of keeping the hops in check. Subtle alcohol in the nose. I get similar flavors in the taste with caramel and malt leading off. The citrus from the hops hit first in my mouth and each sip finishes with a lingering of hop bitterness and piney hops. Body is moderate but could be more substantial, I think. I would like this to linger on my tongue a bit longer. A really tasty DIPA that drinks way too quick for the abv."
"meh...it's definitely tasty, but i'd be hard pressed to justify drinking it over a bottle of hercules or hop wallop"
"Mouthfeel is chewy, full, and smooth. Drinkability is pretty good."
"Pours an amber to orange color with an off-white head that leaves average lacing. Aroma is piney hops with a strong, biscuity malt presence. Malts are quite as prominant in the taste. Sharp, bitter hop bite in the beginning with a hint of sweetness in the middle before the bitterness from the piney hops takes over again. Long lasting bitter aftertaste that has a flavor not unlike chewing on a piece of hay. Mouthfeel is dry with some slickness...a little different. Almost full bodied with decent carbonation and the ABV is noticed more than in some stronger brews. I could see two bombers of this in a night...as long as you don't want to taste much else afterwards."
"d - fairly drinkable with the exceptions of the dryness and the strong hop character destroying the palate, I could definitely do more than just a bomber though"
"Note: Now that i've finished my two 12oz'ers I'm wishing a had another..."
"Orangish amber in color, thin off white head. The aroma is very pine-like, but also very floral, with a decent sweet pale malt backbone. Musty, resinous, earthy hops dominated the flavor, but there was significant orange and citrus rind flavor as well. The malt plays its role well providing a good, solid sweet backdrop. The mouthfeel is a little dry but silky. Easily drinkable. This beer is right on par, a good example of the style, but not a big time standout."
"Fundamentally it is still the same, and the above review almost entirely applies. Though it's somewhat more resinous in the hop department and the body is a small bit more honey-thick. My ratings drop a bit, but that might be a repercussion of a long Winter and Spring spent drinking Hopslam (regardless, my initial 4.5 score seemed a tad high). But I really do like this a lot. And for a big ass IPA/Nearly DIPA this is bargain at $8 something a sixer."
"Drinkability - this is good, and goes down fairly well. Drying bitterness keeps it from being entirely sessionable, though I can see that that would not neccessarily stop me from having more than one bomber of these on occassion."
"I have become a hophead of late, but something about the hops used in this one don't agree with me. The flavor characteristics they impart are too harsh and mask the malt flavors that only creep in towards the end. Worth a try, but slightly muddled."
"Fairly low on the abv range for a double IPA, but the usage of hops in this one certainly help it qualify. An IPA definitely worth trying in my book."
"Pours a toasted mango hue with a one finger head but great retention of a thick foam and lacing. Light bubbling is visible through the rusty haze. The aroma is of seared hops and bread crust. The taste has hops at the fron meeting with the malt in the middle. Nice nectarine skin mixed with dark citrus and toasty amber malts. Very smooth yet bitter palate. Great beer."
"CRUX: GREAT IPA NECTAR HERE! Would be a regular in the DBF if I could get it around here, but alas...."
"This is aa nice all around brew but doesn't compare to some american double ipa's i've had previously."
"This is a good beer but it just doesnt really do it for me."
"I will be looking forward to next year's release if there is one."
"Maximus DIPA pours a beautiful deep copper with a sturdy natural vanilla colored head. Aromatics of sweet malt, marshmallow and well-integrated hops, not particularly over hopped, but tuned like a brew made with a single variety of hops. WOW that's bitter!! And quite dry; don't be fooled by the sweet caramelized nose, this brew is bitter. (man, that was deceiving!). No complaints however, as this is what a new world DIPA should taste like. Perhaps this brew is missing a bit of warmth and fullness, akin to lets say, Arrogant Bastard, but this is in no way a criticism. Well hopped and nicely put together, this is an enjoyable DIPA, albeit running marginally lean in mouthfeel. I would give it a try for its great and unique personality!"
"D: Very enjoyable. Pleasing aroma and flavors. Nice aftertaste, too - a well-crafted, easy to drink IPA. One of my favorites."
"Overall. I dont know... its a good beer, but something about it doesnt totally blow up my skirt. I still would recommend it though."
"This beer is better categorized as a strong single IPA. It just lacks the punch that a good double packs."
"Great beer, and it comes in a 12 oz. bottle."
"Nose is like a hops shotgun to the face, mostly grapefruit and pine. Very nicely done. Taste starts with orange, followed by pine and grapefruit, finished with bitterness. The malt is present enough to allow the taste to feel """full""" but still lets the hops have top billing. I think this is a really great IPA. This is surely one of the better IPA's to be found here on the west coast. I'd pick up a sixer of this any time I craved some hops, which is quite often."
"Beer is good. Hapy hoppy bering."
"Mouthfeel is quite good. Medium/Light body and appropriate carbonation. Not super easy drinking. Super bitter and kind of tough to get down tbh."
"12 oz. bottle, label indicates 7.5% ABV. Pours a hazy orange color. A thin off-white foamy head rises, but disappears rather quick. Floral and citrusy aroma, smells like hops covered in sugar. Floral hop flavor, good amount of bitterness. Malt seems to be soft spoken, however the juicy hop flavor and bitterness does not completely take the wheel. Finishes a bit dry with a hint of aspirin. Good mouthfeel, not too much carbonation. A few patches of laces are left clinging to the sides of the glass. Overall, a pretty good DIPA."
"D- This beer has a good complex malty flavor with a nice hop flavor and bitterness. More layers of the malt came through as it warmed."
"For a higher alcohol brew this is very enjoyable. Usually the higher % tend toward a sweeter side - but his brew exhibits a hoppiness of a good bitter IPA w/o the sweetness to go with it. Kinda of similar to the DFH 90-minute IPA except not quite as strong. I would say between the 60-minute and 90 minute. Like a 75-minute? I drank a couple of this these and both left me wanting more..."
"Super delicious IIPA, quite well rounded and easy to manage the entire 22oz serving. Definately high on the maltiness, but has the hops to back it up."
"Drinkability: Maximus is a highly drinkable DIPA. A really nice hop bitterness that is balanced out by a fruity maltiness. The 7.5% abv doesn't even show its head. A truly balanced DIPA that I would drink again and again. Seek out and enjoy. One of the better DIPA's I've had."
"Pours a nice burnt orange color with a creamy head that does disappear sort of quickly but leaves a lot of nice lacing. Really nice smell of sweet malts, piney hops and a light scent of citrus. Lots of hop filled goodness in the taste factor. A bit of the earthen flavored hops upon first taste, it gives way to a piney followed by a nice citrus/grapefruit taste and ending with that bitter kick I2PAs are special for. Mouth-feel is about the same as most I2PAs, very drinkable beer, I still hold Maharaja and Ruination over this one but its still pretty good bang for the buck."
"I have sampled this beer a few times but never had a bottle to myself until now,poured lighter pale golden with a nice tight white one finger fluffy head that stuck nicley leaving a sheet of lace behind as it settled slowly.Mmmm big pine aromas with underlying citrus with just light and I mean light caramel note underneath,piney with a apricot-like edge hop profile pretty big but not overly brash the malt is amped up a little as well in a sweeter caramel note the alcohol shows up a little more as it warms.Not bitter more of a smoother,rounder DIPA nice balance really."
"D: This beer goes down quite easily, there’s no hint of the alcohol (mostly because of the strength of the hops), very tasty and it’s not very filling. This is a beer I could stick with for the whole night. This is an excellent beer and an excellent representation of the style. I liked this beer a lot."
"Poured from a Double Deuce into a weizen glass, hey it's all I had around. A clean amber beer settles into the glass, a thick off white head head fades into a sticky lacing. Pine resin and earthy aromas, the taste is at first subtle caramel and tree fruits which is then taken over by the aggressive hoppiness, Pine, orange rind, and finally aspirin. The mouthfeel is very slick and oily, but not unpleasantly so. An in your face beer for sure, but good drinkin' nonetheless."
"As the beer warmed up, the 7.5% ABV became more apparent in the taste and the hops became a little harder to take. A well-done beer, I don't think I would enjoy more than one or two in a row."
"All in all, I would say that if you like IPAs, you should try it. Otherwise, don't even bother."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a very astringent smell and the taste of asprins. Needless to say, this beer was hard to drink between smell and taste. The beer is medium bodied. The hops are unpleasantly oily and long lasting. This was a very hard beer to finish. This beer needs to go back to the drawing board."
"Tastes like eating a christmas tree. Bold pine flavors, thick malt, and chewy palate coating hop oil. 30 to 40 second finish. Seems to be lacking in way of carbonation. Hurting both the mouthfeel and drinkability."
"D- Smooth and quite drinkable."
"One sniff and you know you are dealing with a west coast IPA. Light yellowish orange, standard IPA color. Decent brussels lace with a remaining light head down to the bottom of the beer. Alcoholic, you can taste it on the sides of your tongue. Obvious cascade hops linger and linger. Tastay beer but not breathtaking."
"Drinkability: It does a good job giving you hops, but doesn't have the hops concentration that the style and my preference dictates."
"Pours vibrant amber/orange with a few fingers of off-white foam. Nose and taste are a fine balance of sweet and bitter with notes of candied mango and passion fruit, caramel malt, countered by 72.14 IBUs of tangy/piney hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth yet substantial, well carbonated. A well put-together DIPA here. Hoppy enough for the hopheads without the cloying malt bomb that often rears its head as the ABV rises. Glad to see Lagunitas make its way out to WI."
"Drinkability: The drinkability is hurt a bit as the hops numb the mouth. Overall though, this is a top notch DIPA."
"This brew wields a medium body and carbonation. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, juicy, slick... whatever it is not bad. Taste is not intruded by extreme hop bitterness. There is a solid backbone of yeasty malt to add balance to the obviously predominate hop notes. Some grapefruit notes and pine, although again not overly bitter. Alcohol content is only barely perceived once the beverage warms. Not the most in-your-face IPA but that is fine by me. I think I'd gladly make a return trip to this drinkable beer"
"This big beer pours a dark, clear amber with a substantial head and constant stream of bubbles streaming up in the center of the glass. The aroma is quite piney with hops, but there are some other notes in there as well, maybe some metals and certainly some doughy smells. The taste of this beer is mostly what you'd expect -- loads of sweet malts, some bitter hops, and then a few miscellaneous sensations, like nickel and peppery alcohol. Mouthfeel is quite full, almost chewy. That fact detracts from the beer's drinkability, along with the hops content. Lagunitas Maxiumus is a big beer, for which a 22 oz. serving is plenty."
"A very drinkable DIPA. Very smooth considering the ABV."
"Medium body...low carbonation. Pretty crisp, very drinkable beer even though it rings in at 7.5% ABV...and that's probably the only thing holding it back from being a session beer."
"12 oz bottle, pours a nice copper with a finger of off-white head which reduces to a spotty cap that leaves a little lace behind. Smell is full of piney and grapefruit hops, little else going on, but it's nice. Taste has a rather sweet malt upfront giving way to a big grapefruit and citrus hoppiness, and finishing with a grassy, slightly bitter, aftertaste. This is a pretty tame DIPA, I'd say it taste like an IPA if I didn't know better, but that being said it's a good, easy drinking, medium hoppy IPA."
"I liked this beer, even though it wasn't really what I was expecting. The smell is pretty one dimensional: all hop oil. The taste is a very consistent hoppiness, that doesn't dissipate, not even for the sweetness that characterizes many of Lagunitas' beers. I get some apple on the back of the tongue which smoothes the beer into a nice clean finish. Overall a pretty drinkable beer. While the hops are sizeable, they are not as aggresive as many West Coast DIPAs."
"I am noticing a trend with every Lagunitas brew I try- too sweet! I'm not sure if it's the type of malt they use, but every one of their beers tastes a bit sugary to me. This is definitely not what I look for in a DIPA. The hops are there, but they are muted by the malt. I can't recommend this when there are so many better DIPAs out there. Lagunitas, I'm not sure I can try another beer from you..."
"D: a good beer to sit around and drink when you want a solid, hoppy beer but don't want to be distracted by overwhelming flavor or character. could drink one after the other and I imagine it would feel nice."
"D - I finished the beer and could probably have another. Not something I'd probably get again as there are better DIPA's out there."
"I think this beer would make a decent session beer. It is a tad high in alcohol, but not overly. Also, the flavor is not too overbearing."
"Drinkability: good for being 7.5% alcohol, could drink two of these in a night"
"Poured a lovely orange-rust color with a high level of carbonation with a thick, white head that left behind full rings of lacing in my pint glass. The surface of the beer seemed to be coated with small, soapy bubbles once the head began to dissipate. Aromas of pine, hops, grassy earth, grapefruit, and papaya. The taste followed the scents with a very bitter overall taste that had a nice bite to it. Grapefruit-like hops seem to dominate with a floral accent. Slightly chewy texture in my mouth with a lingering bitter finish. Biggest flaw with this beer is the lack of complexity. I think more malt (pale perhaps) would add depth and layers to the flavor and bring more the surface than just hops. When in the mood for a DIPA, this is a good one to go to, but I wouldn't want more than a pint or two of it."
"Pours a glowing translucent amber/orange color with some forceful carbonation with little to no head retention. Evidently not bottle conditioned and possibly filtered. Floral, coniferous, oily, candied hop bouquet and some dulled, white bread maltiness. Herbal and mellow in taste, with a bready, light malt sweetness upfront leading to a more pronounced drier, bitter finish. Nicely balanced and """soft""". I thought, tastewise, I was going to be let down simply by the lackluster appearance of the beer. Certainly drinkable; but I could see getting too bored with this beer to consider it being a great sessioner."
"Lots of hops; slightly unbalanced. The alcohol presence is slick and right up front. A big IPA; flavorwise, seems a little sloppy."
"Pours IPA-color: amber/dark gold body, slight haze. Head is slightly orangy, retains well. Cold, clean, grassy hop smell with hints of lemon and pine; I'm thinking Centennial here. Flavor is a stinging hoppiness, supported by a nice round robust malt profile with a substantial sweetness. Finish is quite bitter, but also a bit tangy/sour in a metallic way. I'm finding this to be quite like """hop rod", which I dearly love, but the alcohol is just slightly more stick-outish here and that kills the drinkability a bit."
"just finished a 12 oz.... YUM!"
"As far as Double IPAs go, this is a solid entry, quite enjoyable to drink, and pretty easy at 7.5%."
"Amended: I let this big bitch warm up...HOLY DAMN this is a different beer! drink at 55-60 degrees and this beer is awesome!"
"Overall, an underwhelmer of a DIPA. Feels insubstantial in the mouth, and doesn't do much in the way of hop flavor and aroma. Drinkable, but a waste of time when there are so many better beers out there..."
"Drinkability: This is a nice, simple beer with a delectable hop profile and light body. Very drinkable. I dig it."
"Very good IPA, interesting example of a DIPA."
"This pours a clear reddish orange with a large tan foamy head. The smell is a very strong citrus aroma,grapefruit?, that is very nice. The taste is very hoppy with a citrus flavor,but it's not harsh, the alcohol is mellowed by abit of malt sweetness. The m/f is light and well balanced. This is a very good brew and I would love to have this again."
"I wish there was more to this beer, but it seems pretty in tune to DIPA style. I've had a few recently and am coming to terms that it's really not my style."
"This is a pretty good example of a hopped up beer that is ok to drink but I dont really consider it to be the best crafted or the best use of hops in a beer, still if you like hops you will drink it and wont dislike it."
"Reminds me of a pretty sunset- lots of orange, red, and golden hues, and very clear- quite pretty. Nose is surprisingly mild- hoppy, yes, but mild. Hops are sweet and floral, light. Taste is a bit odd... hoppy, sorta; malty, sorta; grapefruit? Rotten grapefruit. Mouthfeel is okay, sudsy and medium bodied. Drinkability is... meh... that something odd in the taste just throws me off. Otherwise, a very nice beverage."
"Alcohol is balanced well, full soft mouth fell and quite drinkable."
"I've found that Lagunitas offers great bang for your buck brews and this one lives up to that tradition with dignity. $3-$5 for a bomber? sign me up."
"Crystalline golden orange with a yellowish-white head, thick and fluffy. Citrusy pine hop aroma is much more subdued than I expected. Taste begins citrusy sweet -- candied orange rinds and red grapefruit juice, but enough pine bitterness to keep it astringent. The pleasant surprise is the nutty malt flavor that rides out through the aftertaste. Juicy and smooth mouthfeel. A solid, sessionable DIPA -- in fact, it seems to be just barely on the """double""" side of the IPA camp. In any case, a recommended selection."
"M & D: Mouthfeel on this offering from Lagunitas is very good. Nice and smooth beer that has a refreshing aftertaste. Makes you feel like you just had a very fresh grapefruit or orange. Not very carbonated. Drinkability of this DIPA is very high. The mid level abv allows you to savor a couple of these 22oz. bombers if you please. Overall a very well balanced and full bodied beer. I will have another soon!"
"The mouthfeel is a tad thin for my liking. Overall, a bomber of this is difficult to finish."
"Poured a honey color with a fuzzy head which lasted well. Nose was straightforward with some mild citrus notes but very little in terms of malt suggestions. Taste was obviously very hoppy with just a slight bit of oily texture, pretty good although just a little harsh with less hop taste and more hop bite than the truly top notch DIPA's. This is a good offering but is outshined by some others in the genre."
"72.41 IBUs. Crystal clear faded apricot colored with a thick and frothy head of off-white meringue. Crisp and inviting aroma of citrus hops flecked with pine tar. Flavor is sweet tangerine hops upfront, morphing nearly immediately to bitter citrus peel, and slowly evolving to crunchy pine tips. A light malt sweetness rides beneath, but is nearly eclipsed by the bite of the hops. Throat and stomach are warmed as I sip. Mouthfeel is thin and tingly, finishes crisp. Not overly complex, but pretty drinkable."
"This beer poured a cider/honey honey color with a nice off white head that fell to a incredibly uneven film that left some very nice lace. Smells of dry, sour cherries and plumb skin along with a musky, earthy hop. Upon my first sip a powerful rush of pine zipped in around the base of my tongue. That was unique. In the remainder of the flavor, the pine flavors really dominate right into the smooth finish. Hop-burps reiterate the same fantastic pungent pine. The hops also lend a nice sweeter orange to the overall flavor. The malt supporting this pine maelstrom is very subtle with just the slightest hint of caramel and smoky marshmallow that leaves my mouth just a bit sticky in the finish. The mouth feel is medium bodied with a smooth, almost creamy carbonation that leaves the tip of my tongue tingling. If you are enthralled by the piney elements of hops, this beer is a must. Im not a card carrying hop-head, but I thought this beer was original and very well crafted. Also, I must say Im getting some of the best hop-burps Ive ever had. Ill definitely have this one again."
"Pours a coppery golden color topped by a good two-finger creamy white head. Head doesn't last for too long, but settles into a nice wispy coating on top. Aroma of spicy, fruity hops, with notes of pine and grass and a whiff of alcohol. Palate is well-balanced between assertive fruity hops and a light honey-sweet malt character. Some sweet fruit come through mid-palate, yielding to a powerful bitterness on the finish. Body is full, creamy, and slightly sticky, holding the flavor very well. Very tasty, and not overwhelmingly strong like some double IPAs."
"Bump up the gravity of this beer a bit, and it would make one hell of a barleywine. But not quite what I expected for a DIPA. I like this beer, but it is not really a DIPA."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and slightly oily."
"I tried this from a 22oz bomber. I am gonna give this one 4's across the board, I really like this one and would like to find it in 12oz bottles if they were to package them. I went shopping the other day and picked up about a a half dozen ipa/iipas and this one if definetly on the gonna pick up again list. Appearance is a golden brown with a giant head due to a bit of a rough pour. Smells of fruits and hops are abundant in this one and I love every bit of it as it gives a hint of what the taste will be. This is my first lagunitas purchase and i will buy more in the future"
"If you are totally into hops this is your beer, but not the worst DIPA you could pick at random"
"I'm having this beer with Montreal seasoned beef. This beer is the perfect foil for this hearty meal. I'm noticing the alcohol content more as well as the malt flavors in this combination."
"Maximus comes in the 650ml brown bottle, with another one of their relatively nondescript labels, with large black and green lettering. The give-you're-head-a-shake stories on the sides of the bottle are always diverting though(and they make more sense after a couple bottles). If it were not for them, the Lagunitas labels would be extremely boring. Maximus pours very agreeably, forming a rich bed of beige-yellowish foam. The underlying bubbles are a little larger, but the consistency of the foam viewed from the top is compact and ice-cream like. Thin lacing, but it clung well and formed paint-like splotches. The beer is dark rust in colouration; equal parts orange and red. Lighter than an amber, but darker than most pale ales. At first the liquid appears quite limpid, but there is a very fine haziness upon closer examination, and as you pour the last bit you can see the sediment clearly floating in the beer. Delightful looking brew. The first sniff after pouring the beer is quite malty, but as the head lessens and the beer breathes a little, the expected dark-wood spicy hops assert themselves. The beer is quite balanced to me though: instead of the hops being dominant in the aroma, the malting holds its own against them, as evidenced by the inescapable sugary sweetness throughout. I will say that the hops DO increase in magnitude the more the beer sits and aerates. The aroma is a little similar to Brown Shugga'. Other aromas include some milkiness, maple syrup, pepper, tree bark, and a great woodiness from the hopping. Raisins, definite dried prunes, figs, and a faint hit of vodka-like alcohol lurking underneath. Plenty of complexity to be had. The west-coast hops add all sorts of earthy vinous notes: spice-filled and warming. Sometimes cinnamon-like, sometimes seasoning salt in nature. As expected, the hops really do define the taste of Maximus. The aroma does not suggest the astringent dryness of the taste. The malt is just as present as the hops in the SMELL, but the taste changes all that: on the tip of the tongue, save a small bit of white-sugar sweetness, the woody hops start to add their bitterness. By the middle the cinnamon and grapefruit and lemon are all there, and the finish is dizzyingly dry, at first. The finish is all about mouth-puckering. After sipping, though, the dryness lessens. The taste is not as filled with nuances as the aroma, but still very tasty and full of flavours like burnt toast, mollasses, pomegranate seeds, honeycomb, toffee, ground coffee, and a strong metallic presence, like copper. The malting, when it can be appreciated, is very syrupy. Everything hides behind the massively bitter finish, though. This is extremely low in carbonation, feeling slick and oily on the tongue. Full bodied and quickly warming. Whilst I love to try these, the inherent problem is the lack of solid drinkability--for me, these Double IPAs will never be good session beers, and will never surpass a good amber or even a balanced IPA for quaffability. These will be the exceptions, not the rules. I love them, but would no more drink them daily than I would eat blue cheese, caviar and roast beef every day. A lovely beer to try though, even if not as jaw-droppingly hoppy as might be expected from the DIPA categorisation. And yes, the dryness stays in the mouth almost endlessly unless you pair Maximus with something like aged cheddar. The sharpness softened the hop-bite, and the cheddar added some new tastes."
"The finish is quite bitter with a metallic and medicinal quality to it. A bit syrupy in the mouthfeel. Still very quenching and drinkable for a DIPA with a somewhat high ABV."
"I'm not a huge fan of the style, but I found this more pleasant than most, and would gladly try another."
"Cheers!"
"Opinion: This is a really tasty beer. I am not much of a hop head, and I prefer a beer that has softer water and less bittering hops. This beer doesnt have a metallic twang, and the sharp bitterness that many micros have as their signature finish. This one is much more drinkable in that respect for me."
"Smells of bitter hops with some citrus, some floral; also yeast. Mostly clean and floral/herbal. There is a nice hop bite on the tongue but I wish the body were fuller. Slick mouthfeel with hop oil. Kind of dry, not juicy. No alcohol tastes to get in my way; as it warms there's some alcoholic warmth to it, all good, no complaints."
"The mouthfeel was good... it had good body. And it was highly drinkable, also. But a double IPA? Doesn't quite fit my expectations for the style."
"Easy to drink but I expected more hops from a beer called """Maximus.""" This beer barely qualifies as an IPA much less than a Double IPA. This is easy to drink though."
"This is a tough category of beer to impress with because there are so many huge creative and awesome Double IPA's.... this was good just doesn't stack up."
"The big bubbles which stick around in the head cause an oddly flaky, mottled feel."
"Drinkability is good. I actually remembered this one being a little bit better out of the bottle but I still wasn't really let down."
"What an odd but interesting beer. More of an English style hop monster. Huge hop attack but not that piney cascade or Chinook style hops. The biscuit malt really gives me the impression its an English style Craft ale. Very cool"
"Overall impression: Nice IPA - very drinkable for the ABV. Well balanced with plenty of variety in the hops flavor."
"The finish ia an alpha acid fade, leaving the throat dry and the tongue coated with thick hop juice. Maximus is well named, as it is difficult to polish off a 22oz bottle of this stuff."
"Pours a hazy coppery-orange with a minimal off-white head. Thick pungent hops are detectable immediately upon opening the bottle. Grapefruity, piney with some hints of tangerine and citrus. Not actually that aggressive at the first taste, but the big hop character builds to the finish. Not much malt detectable, there's a little bit there, but the hops seem to reign unopposed. The malt is clearly there in the body, which is nice a heavy, almost syrupy, but I just can't seem to taste too much of it. A nice enough I2PA, but considering my supply of these in limited to what I can carry on the plane back from seeing my Virginian girlfriend, I might reserve that for some tastier examples. Nevertheless, a decent beer."
"Overall: A bit too hoppy for me. I do love my hop bombs, but this one just tasted a bit like licking a hop bag. It could stand to have the hops either toned down a bit or the malt beefed up some. The malt is there, but it gets lost pretty easily."
"It's a decenltly drinkable beer. The 7.5% ABV will guarantee that you enjoy the end of it more than the beginning. But, make sure to drink it cold. If you're working on the 22oz bottle alone, make sure to keep the remainder of it in the freezer while you're working on the top half. Probably best to start with frozen glassware."
"Mouthfeel is a tad bit thin and quite frankly dissapointing..seemed to not pack enough punch. Mellowed out carbonation left me looking for a bit more. Overall, a fairly easy drinking DIPA that doesn't push things too far. I'm glad I was able to sample it."
"Drinkability - As a single IPA it would be ok, although too high in alc%age. Still, not real drinkable for me, as it wasn't my type of DIPA."
"something special for my 400th. A bomber of this sought after impy IPA. Poured a murkey orange-gold with a creamy off white cap. Moderately carbonated. Aromas of sweet bread and grapefruit. Lots of chewy malts in this like sticky sweet cookie dough meets pine-citrus hopping in near balance...like the ad sez: """ a raging mouthful of malt and hops""". The finish is slow and erodes into not quite the promised enamel melting bittering but was a pleasant bittering with an astringent- metalic aftertaste. This what Liberaty ale on steroids would taste like....I lile the well balanced hop and malt wallop of this big APA and Ill buy it often."
"The beer pours a dark amber/orange color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a nice malty scent that is sweet and warm. It boasts of pale and light crystal malts. It also has an intense hop aroma that is quite pleasant and bitter. The taste is great also. It has a well rounded flavor that boasts of pale and light crystal malts as well as loads of hops. It goes down smooth with a slightly warm finish. It has an intense hop character; very nice. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good double IPA. It's not as high in alcohol content as some, but it has excellent flavor and aroma; a good drinker."
"This is a great beer, If a little light to be a DIPA (both in ABV and hops). Its still way hoppier than most beers available in Toronto. Ill get it again."
"Pours an amber orange with a little bit of haze to it, with big head and nice lacing. Smell is all hops, floral, piney, strong and malty. Taste has a nice big malt background, with good floral hop flavour and a clean bitter finish. Mouth is full and chewy, with good carbonation. Not the biggest double IPA but well balanced and pretty tasty. Thanks northyorksammy."
"Very clear orange colour with a generous, rocky, off-white head. Very floral aroma with just a bit of citrus and pine mixed in. As it warms, the malty sweet aroma combines with the hops to produce a smell very similar to ripe oranges. The flavour is very balanced, not overly bitter, with plenty of citrusy/orange hops. Also a bit doughy, it finishes medium length, off-dry from the hopping, with a light spiciness and a bit of alcohol warming. Full bodied, slightly viscous, and a bit sticky from residual sugar. Not an aggressive beer at all, it strikes a good balance that makes it quite drinkable."
"A solid American IPA. Doesn't quite live up to the promise of its looks, but it's still quite good."
"Overall: a fine, caramelly IPA that is on the weaker side of dIPAs."
"This sample had to have been old. No hop aroma, minimal hop flavor, floaties on the bottom. Put the freakin' date on the labels, guys!!!"
"Paired this with some very spicy quesadillas- smple faire, but the spicy black beans and salsa stood up well to the hops in this very big flavored beer."
"Dark copper in colour with aromas of Cascade and grassy hops. The flavors are mellow for an IIPA, medium bitterness with a whole lot of syrupy malt. The finish is powder dry and has a biscuit quality (which Ive experienced with some Irish ales). I liked that quality, but I could see others not appreciating it. This is kind of a baby-step IIPA, but still a quality beer."
"Maximus is a shiny copper color with an above average-sized head. Carbonation is good, as is the retention. The aroma is a very fresh-smelling citric hop with a sizable underlying malt sweetness. The taste also seems very fresh. Very tasty citrisy hops are joined by a delicious malt body. Hops also leave some pine flavor. The bitterness factor seems low, although the label states that this brew is 76 IBU. Mouthfeel is mildly creamy. This is insanely easy to drink, as every sip seems very fresh from start to finish. Recommended."
"Better than average beer, perhaps the near-room temperature on a very humid day did not do it justice. Had at Volo Cafe. Bomber needed to and was shared. Good retained head. Floral hoppy, initially grapefruity aroma. Smooth and Refreshing, but there are tastier double IPAs around, or even IPAs instead."
"Poured a vibrant amber/orange colour, with a large, fluffy off white head. Good lacing and retention. Strong and enticing aroma of sweet citrus fruit, pine and malt. Medium bodied, smooth and so drinkable. Sweet, fruity, juicy, thirst quenching, bursting with flavour. Very well balanced. Not as over the top as other double IPA's and that's one of the best parts of this beer."
"Well I can't say that I like this one. It's my first Double IPA, but I feel fairly confident in saying that there must be better ones out there."
"Overall, I'm sad to report that this is another profoundly mediocre offering from Lagunitas, which has great marketing and distribution (here in Northern California, at least), but way less than average beers. Better than macroswill, sure, but not by much, and doesn't hold a candle to many other widely available beers."
"Maximus pours a cloudy amber to orange hue with lots of bubbles spouting up from the bottom of my big red wine glass. That being said, the beer is undercarbonated. When I see """Maximus""" IPA as the label states in big capital letters, I think hoppy, aggressive and awsome. Sadly this brew is not up to par with its competition. It's far from a hop monster and there is an astringent character to the bitterness that it has. If Lagunitas took the ABV down to 6.5%, this might become a decent single IPA."
"I was expecting great things from Maximus after being impressed by its little brother Minimus (actual name: Lagunitas IPA). Oddly enough, the DIPA tastes less hoppy than the IPA. Since it favors the tamer end of the style spectrum, Maximus is probably a good entry-level Double IPA for those with an interest in the style."
"Overall if you want a big IPA, the title is misleading. THis aint it. If you want something different in an IPA (more citrus than pine, but still a decent mix), then this is it."
"Drinkability- Polished off a bomber over half a movie last night. Extremely tasty beer and a great one if you like your bitterness from a fruity side rather than a pine needle forest. Definitely the best value for a bomber I have had to date ($2.99). Go out and grab some today."
"A little tough to drink because of the high alcohol content but all and all a strong IPA. Definitely a bit of a different approach to IPA- stronger and very bitter IBU 72.41. If you like IPA,s you should try this one out. Doggone Good."
"Drinkability is very solid. Excellent flavors and transitions but really somewhat mellower than I expected."
"Medium mouthfeel was closer to a single IPA than a DIPA I think. The body lacked the heft that other beers from the style typically possess. Nonetheless, the beer was mouth coating and satisfying. Aftertaste was bitter and dry, but a little short lived. Definitely a notch above the run of the mill IPA, and very drinkable, but not quite a DIPA"
"Slightly oily mouthfeel and an aftertaste that smacks of leftover hops and alcohol. Not bad but my money's on Stone's representation of this style."
"hazy coppery amber with a thick, sticky light tan head that laces well. very flowery sweet hop aroma. a little bit of pine lies under a malty slightly caramel aroma. the overall smell is a little weak, despite what i pick up being rather good. lots of herbal hop flavor, with a building grapefruit and pine character as the beer warms. sweet caramel malts show up most strongly in the aftertaste. there is a very faint taste of something almsot like cotton candy as well. lots of carbonation and a medium mouthfeel. good drinkability, it's pretty easy to pour the last drops out of the bomber and say """already?""" given the current state of american IPAs and double IPAs, this beer would make a very good IPA, but only makes for a pretty good double."
"no aftertaste, seems to be a lagunitas special trait. wont buy again."
"An all-around enjoyable beer. Typical IPA appearance, medium copper color with a cream colored head. Decent head formation and retention. Fresh hop notes in the aroma backed by a bit of malt sweetness. Peppery and citrus notes accompany the bitterness on the palate, all balanced by a decent caramel-twinged malt backbone. Paired with a solid mouthfeel and a healthy dose of carbonation, it conjures up hop burps in a hurry. A pleasure to drink, I'll buy more someday."
"Victory - Hop Wallop (Way more hoppy than malty)"
"Bottle. Really dissapointing. Just really tinny, rusty American hops, no length too the flavour. Typical pine/grapefruit. I guess i didn't like the metallic edge that most of the Lagunitas beers i've had seem to have, just really a really dissapointing brewery for me, i expected a bit more with this beer."
"Comely, virile inch of fluff with big and small that settles to a laconic peak and valley scene. Deep golden hue with a touch of orange coming to play; a bit of haze and almost no discernible action. Frank hop burnish on nose with side notes of peach, cotton candy, and a whiff of licorice. Fine bite of concentrated hop on mouth, but a very liquid feel, not overly caustic or head-crushing; floral notes of rose hip and sumac pull through. Evenly drinkable; more so than other extreme IPAs."
"22oz bottle. Pours an orange color with a moderate head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is not as hoppy as expected - more malts than expected. The flavor has a caramel malt presence but it also has a dirty hop flavor that I don't care much for. The mouthfeel and drinkability are ok, but not wonderful."
"Still, I'm not craving another one. I enjoyed what I sampled, but it's not enough to drag me back immediately for another one. I enjoy my hops these days, but I'm no junkie. It's no Stone Ruination, or even Tree's Hophead to get more local. All the same, I am still very happy to see more American micros available in this local market."
"Thanks to clvand0 for sharing this with me. It pours a hazy orange color with a finger and a half of head that falls to coat the beer. The nose is not what I expected. Its almost like there is a grainey quality in there. The hops are secondary to the caramel and grainey malts. The flavor is just okay as well. The dirty, slightly spicey hop and heavy caramel and slightly grainey malts are well balanced. I just don't like it all that much. The feel is very full and slightly creamy. Overall, I would pass this one up in favor of many other outstanding Double IPAs out there. Its not bad, but could definately be improved in my book."
"Very drinkable beer in the session mold."
"Definitely try it, but only pick up one bottle, that will be all you need."
"A great first experience for Lagunitas. Thanks!"
"The mouthfeel crisp at the start and finish. The syrupy texture of the malt last on the tongue after swallowing. Medium bodied. Not a bad brew, but the citric sourness knocked this down a bit."
"Clear copper color with a 1 inch cream colored head that clings as a lace to side of the glass as its tipped. Great piney, grassy smell from the hops along with a caramel overtone. The taste has an awakening bitterness from the hops. More pronounced flower character in the taste and more malt than I originally expected. It has a bright, slick mouth feel and a great drinkability. I was under whelmed with Lagunitas standard IPA offering. It was good, but not great. This is definitely a cut above that offering."
"Pours a beautiful golden copper color with a frothy white head that just looks delicious and leaves a nice lace. Aromas are a mix of spicy and earthy hops along with some citrus like aromas and a mix of bread. Flavors start off with malty with a nice sweet caramel tone followed by bread like flavors and some earthy and citrusy hops. The body throughout this brew is fairly creamy and full, and the finish to this brew is simply excellent with a really nice citrusy, spicy, bitter finish. Overall I would tend to see this more like an IPA than an Imperial but the flavors are worth it either way.. A nice offering by Lagunitas and the first one I've ever tried."
"Overall drinkability is good, but for those who drink more than lightweight me, be careful: This beer's strength is well-hidden."
"Ooh, hoppy. I have not had a good hop-head beer in a while. Nice to be back. It poured out of the bottle rust in color with no head. The aroma is if hops, rye and what I can only describe as a bowl of grapes. The taste is all hops, powerful and bitter. There are also notes of overripe oranges. The mouthfeel is biting; happily, hoppily biting. While hop lovers would enjoy this, others who do not like strong, bitter hops would most likely be asking someone else to finish it for them."
"Perhaps my favorite Lagunitas tried to date."
"Pours a translucent reddish-copper with minimal head. Aroma is spicy hops, very enticing. I was quite impressed with this Lagunitas offering. Taste is primarily bitter, spicy hops with a solid malt overlay - hints of citrus and tangy tangerine. Smooth, spicy mouthfeel. An excellent double IPA for the price - 4.39 for a bomber. Very drinkable, even at 7.5%."
"Thanks to Nickbagofdonuts for letting me try this."
"Very bitter, but balanced. This is an easy drinking beer"
"Taste starts with a sweet biscuit malt. Notes of fruit develop fleetingly. Hops come on strong and early. Nice flavor here: lemons, grapefruit, balsam fir sap. Bitterness is substantial and last long into the finish. Slightly warming. Medium-big bodied, mouth-coating, good feeling ale. Mama likes."
"Overall Impression 4: Nice work! Great hop flavors but I would like just a bit more base to give some balance. Still, for all the hops I expected a harsher edge and its just not there. A very enjoyable beer, almost a good IPA starter for those venturing into this end of the pool. Theyre right, this is Doggone Good!"
"As the beer dropped down closer to cellar temperature, I became impressed with the sweetness for such a strong IPA. Everything worked out by the end of the bomber. I would put this toe-to-toe with Stone's Ruination."
"Large bomber bottle, mising any sort of freshness indicator. Pours a rich orangey amber, fairly cloudy, white tiny bubble head,dissolving to a slick sheen and leaving oodles of sheets of light lacing. Moderate amount of floating mini chunks also noted. Nose is of oily pine needles. Great gobs of grainy, piney hops up front flow over a solid and substantial malt base. Tasty, strong, bold and satisfying. Went great with some spicy sausages and onions. Fine brew, my favorite so far from Lagunits. seek out and enjoy."
"This stuff pours a thick and murky orange/amber color with only a finger of slowly receding head. The aroma is quintessential West Coast: citrusy hops, and syrupy pine. The taste is a touch sweeter than others of this variety (I2PA, Ruination, Dreadnaught); it's quite good, with skeletal malts, but it lacks that grapefruity bite that a double often produces (a plus or minus depending upon your preference, I suppose). However, it is smooth and silky to the palate, and the light carbonation is just right. A very worthy choice."
"I love IPA's because they're so good with food. They compliment dishes like chicken piccata, tomato sauces, anything with herbs-right. But an IPA like this can stand up to substantial dishes like this rabbit, andouille-n-roasted green chile gumbo I made tonight. It'd be great with green chile, Mexican.... Alone, as a quaffing brew, this is a bit sharp on the bitterings, but pair it with food and>brewhaha>this is a king of refreshment."
"Alcohol is hidden well. Good drinkability. Have'nt had this one in a while...won't let that happen again."
"Murky amber, tons of floaties, nice 1cm head. Big aroma of herbal oranges. Light earth components and something lactic, not unlike meringous. Straightforward malt introduction, sweet, a bit maple-like, but then strikes the unforgiveable, harsh floral/grapefruity citric bitterness. Low to medium carbonation, medium bodied. Extreme stuff and Im not huge on the style, but still one of lagunitas best by my standards."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1""" beige head over the orangey amber brew. Head is long-lasting, with heavy foam lacing. Aroma is oddly enough, reminding me of lemonade. Have to give it props for just being interesting. Taste gives you a shot of some nice malt, but quicky gets to the point of the DIPA, piney hops, with a slight citrus character. Mouthfeel is and drinkability are both good for the style. I find this more drinkable than their regular IPA which I had awhile back. Nice DIPA."
"Interesting taste. sweet in the front. I have aged this beer 1 year and much bitterness has been subdued in the initial taste. Pleanty of hop taste, though. And a long lingering bitterness that begs for another drink. I easely submit. This is a very rich drink and the mouthfeel reflects it. Drinkabiblity is hi, but stifled a bit by the pure richness of the brew."
"This is a somewhat unique, but really delicious DIPA. I think it's a bit malt heavy/hop light for an IPA, but it's a beer I enjoyed."
"light carbonation, amber/orange color, not much of a head. hoppy aroma, kind of pick some cinnamon? 'flavor, hpos of copurse, bitter but not overly, some malt sweetness. I was looking forward to trying the Lagunitas brand of beers but am pretty dissapointed in this."
"A bit too heavy and thick to drink a lot of. A good DIPA, but not amazing."
"drinkability: as the """bum""" told me, """It's not for """Jessies!""" it packs a good punch, not that you taste it, but you FEEL it! but, YEAH! I would want to have it again, and it IS totally drinkable, I really enjoyed it!(by myself) lol, thanks again longbeach!"
"Drinkability: Although I prefer a more aggressive and assertive bitterness to my IPAs, this is a great beer. Alcohol isn't perceivable, and bitterness is so clean, I could quaff quite a few of these."
"This hops medley is one of the best assembled I have tasted. With a thick and hearty mouthfeel, and a light citrus aftertaste, this beer qualifies as one of the top contenders in my book."
"Mmmm, hops..."
"Maximus was served from a 22 oz bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was a vibrant metallic golden-bronze-copper hue, and was topped by an ample, resiliant, and creamy off-white head. The nose was big, fresh, and juicy with a well-developed grapefruit-lime citric and resinaceous (pine) hop bouquet. A perfumy maltiness backed things up nicely. The taste presented a rich and peppery melon-citrus-brown sugur tinged malt profile that carried aloft a spicy-pine-citric zest hoppiness which increased in intensity into the wonderful and perfectly bittered finish. Some spicy brown sugar flavors was carried through into the lingering notes. Pricks of tartness here and there add extra interest and balance. The body was creamy and very smooth, feeling like a soft down pillow in the mouth...really quite nice for the flavors/character of the beer. Overall this is a great brew, and a fantastic deal at $3 a pop, or $2.50 on sale in my case. This would also make an excellent introduction to the double IPA world, considering its restraint in the bitterness department compared to many others of the style...a tasty stepping stone. Good stuff."
"($5.39 / 22 oz. bottle)"
"Overall, this is a nice solid DIPA."
"Orange gold and very inviting with a piney, resinous nose. Big mouthfeel with hops aplenty . The balance is just right making this an imperial IPA that is very drinkable. Compare this with I2PA from Rogue and you will find a certain refinement in the Lagunitas offering."
"22oz bomber. This pours a hazy amber orange color with a good sized off-white head that dropped down to a coat of bubbles after a few sips. It left good lacing around the glass as it was consumed. Hops fill the nose of this one as citrus and floral hops pretty much take over the smell. Notes of malt sweetness can also be detected through the hoppiness. The taste is lead with a bit of a sharp bitterness that is balanced of by the malty sweetness soon after. Notes of citrus fruits can be detected and there are also slight traces of alcohol. Mouthfeel is very full and creamy and it is very drinkable. Not as bitter and hoppy as most DIPAs but a good and balanced beer none the less. Definitely give this one a shot."
"What can I say? It's an excellent, excellent example of my favorite style of beer. I'll be buying more of this."
"Drinkability...this is such a silly portion of our judging. I would drink his all night but I'd soon fall asleep. It's seriously drinkable but it's7.5%. You tell me how long you can do this one."
"I'm enjoying this much more than the normal Lagunitas IPA."
"Pretty tasty little beer. Surprisingly pale for a beer ringing in at almost 8%. Its a light amber, very clear on the first pour, with an excellent eggshell head thats the perfect consistency. It lingers nicely as well. The aroma is intensely hoppy, as is the flavor, but the beer isnt overly bitter. In fact, if its overly anything, its overly sweet. The sweetness definitely turns it into a slow sipper."
"Poured a nice orange amber color with a great head-of which about 1/8""" remained the whole way down.Nice full aroma of hops but not overpowering compared to some other double IPAs Ive had.Great big hop flavor up front.Malty flavor lingers in the backround.Nice smooth mouthfeel-not too harsh from the hopiness.A good double IPA-really came thru as it warmed in the glass.Not as """in your face""" as some others out there-perhaps a good starting point?"
"I want another."
"Awesomely balanced yet wicked enough to satisfy my big masochistic hop head."
"A cloudy yellow golden hue with a fluffy white head of foam, that lasts and lasts. The aromas are very floral, with citrusy hops, and light bready malts in there as well. The taste is quite hoppy up front but very malty in the middle and finish. For a DIPA this really isnt a very hoppy version, but that's why I like it. This brew pulls you in with its fresh, hoppy aroma, and than it backs it up with a lovely use of malts. The mouthfeel is somewhat thick for a DIPA, but it works, and the drinkability is awesome. Yet another solid brew from a somewhat overlooked brewery who do not dissapoint!"
"Quite a drinkable ale..IMO..not bad."
"Appearance was good for the category. Lovely light golden amber hue. Smell was somewhat subduded. Hops were definately there, but you had to let them waft up to the nose. Taste was good for an IPA, I found it a little bit lacking for an Imperial IPA though. Not sure exactly how IBUs get measured, but this one seemed to come up short for a 72IBU brew. Easy to drink (for a hop-head!), and good mouthfeel. Overall this beer was well balanced, but just not agressive enough for my tastes."
"Jason Brentwood roolz!!!"
"This offering from Lagunitas definitely falls into my personal category of """über-IPA"""; big, aggressively hopped and packing a punch. It's got a nice balance and isn't quite as tongue-scorching as, say, Ruination. However, it does get pretty close. A tasty brew worth trying out."
"22 ounce bottle. IBU 72.41, OG 1.080."
"This IPA always delivers a good, consistent hoppy wallop. It's a bold, in your face hop taste, but very pleasing to the palate, and not over the top like a Stone Ruination. Great color, great pour and aroma. Nice lacing in the glass, and true to the taste of the line-up of outstanding California IPA's. Although it's not my favorite, it certainly is in my top ten of IPA's nationwide."
"662"
"Drinkability: A bit milder than I remember, but a good solid IPA. Try it at least once if you can."
"Drinkability  After the tasting notes, I chugged half the bottle in about five minutes until the wife grabbed it out of my arms (she loves bitter beer). This one was awesome!"
"A hazy copper color, pours a bit on the thick side with an off cream to tan colored head that is fairly thick and lasting. A hoppy aroma with notes of fruit and citrus, perhaps some aromas of a blooming field of some type of flower. A full mouth-feel, quite thick for an IPA, even for a strong one. This was yester-years American Barley-Wine. The hops are there, but not as up front as I was expecting. A sort of orange-nectar hop flavor. This beer is quite malty as well. Lightly sweet, which gives this beer a hop nectar type taste. This beer was not as bitter or hoppy as I was expecting. It is pretty good though. I is a bit too thick for my taste though."
"What a beautiful beer! This one poured a gorgeous amber color with a perfectly foamy white head. I must also note, the bottle was very cool indicating not only the ABV but the IBU's and the OG. The beer had a wonderful hoppy citrus scent with a healthy dose of pine and a great malt sweetness. The taste was incredably smoothe and more balanced than I thought it would be. There were a lot of hops for sure, but they were not overberaring and were balanced out wonderfuly by the malt, slight peppery spice and the silky smoothe mouthfeel. At 7.5%, this beer could do some serious dammage, but it is so easy to drink that I just might have to take that risk!"
"Appearance: Now this is truly foam and this is one of the most difficult pours had my pint at a complete 30 degree angle at the beginning of the pour I have four fingers of head on it, well it appears a wonderful copper orange hue with massive copious amounts of off white frothy head, did I mention the loads and loads of hop particles floating in my pint I love it. These west coasters sure do know how to hop a beer! Aroma: Huge citrus and pine tones flood the senses but the just as massive amount of malt in this beer is prevalent in the scent very rich and fulfilling on all levels what a beer. This beer is as heavenly as the ocean breeze it's just way to nice, a smell that is all by itself a must try. Taste: Honey syrup tones lie beneath a wave of juicy hop citrus and pine and earthy goodness what a friggin beer we have here. So many layers of hops within the beer yet so complex with malt sweetness and don't get me started on the texture. Mouthfeel: Full bodied as they come with chewy texture gelatinou head adds to this experience there are proteins and texture in the foam by itself whenn blended with the beer, all I can say is wow. Drinkability: Despite all of these huge massive tones of flavor, aroma, appearance, this beers drinkability is increased by the complexity alone and once you taste and fully enjoy this cherished beer than you'll be able to relate to this review seek this one out yet this is an original experience from beginning to end of the beer."
"This is just a big, hoppy, sugary IPA. Like candied grapefruit peel. Sometimes Lagunitas is hit-or-miss for me. This one's definitely a hit."
"Medium brown color. Medium Head. Extremely hoppy IPA, some maltyness. Very full flavor, nearly chewy. Smooth maltyness. Finish is smooth and crisp. Aftertaste is bitter. High alcohol 7.5%.. A very strong IPA. Not for everyone, but a very interesting beer."
"Notes: Even though this shouldn't be considered a session beer, this one is quite drinkable. The alcohol content is a little high, but I could see myself drinking quite a few of these."
"A brilliant, crystal-clear amber body reveals deep gold highlights when held to the light. Its short head of creamy off-white foam holds well before dropping to a thin surface covering; and leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. Perfumey, floral, citrusy (mild grapefruit) and piney hops greet you in the nose over a delicate, caramel-laced malt. It's quite engaging and very welcoming; although not as brash as some of the bolder IPA's tend to be! Nice! The body is medium and it's lightly crisp in the mouth. All of the variety of hops found in the aroma dominate the flavor profile; and it's caramel-laced and biscuity malt acts as support. It's exceptionally well-balanced for such a boldly hopped beer. It boasts a 7.5% alcohol content and it displays a bold, drying bitterness that carries over into the aftertaste with some lingering hop flavor. Overall, it's a very clean and straightforward American IPA that maintains a great deal of balance and offers a clean, fresh, hoppy, and malty character! Impressive! One to try."
"22 oz bomber bottle. Hazy dark copper color. Fluffy tan head. Sticky hop bubbles on the side of the glass. Rich fresh hop aromas, full rich Cascade snap. Fresh squeezed grapefruit. Taste and smell are spot on for a west coast IPA. Sticky, resiny, and earthy bitter hop flavor and slightly toasted malt undertones. A touch less hoppy, but more full malt backbone than the Bear Republic version I had last night. Not sure if that's either good or bad. Hop freshness cleanses the palate and leaves a bitter, crisp finish on the tongue. Puckering hole on the tongue. Crisp and clean, medium bodied, and very tasty. I had this with grilled chicken spinich salad with grated horseradish cheese. Very good taste and well worth the effort to track down."
"I enjoyed this IPA. It gave me a real kick. I could not drink it on a regular basis though."
"Maximus is back! This brew pours a bright and deep golden with impressive head retention and lace. The malt is not very upfront, but definitely a polite and sweet presence beneath an abundance of glorious hops. A little grassiness and a big, big finish. The aftertaste lingers like an old friend that you don't mind if he sleeps on your couch and raids the refrigerator."
"Very fruity aroma with appropriate grass notes. """Clean""" in aroma and taste, while still remaining complex in the numerous hop charachteristics. Pronounced bite masks the alcohol warmth. Delicious and even refreshing for something so strong."
"If they spent as much time on their brewing as they did on their prose, they might be able to eek a winner out of this train-wreck of a beer."
"Originally sampled on 23 June 2002. The head is white & frothy & the beer is cloudy, w/ a dark golden color. A nice hoppy flavor, but it's not as well balanced as some others I've had. You can definitely taste the alcohol; I prefer a beer where the alcohol flavor is hidden. What I didn't like was that it did not have a very clean finish."
"Nice California IPA but these are beginning to be predictable. Nice fluffy head atop a deep copper ale. First whiff reminded me of grape jelly and I have no idea why. After poured aroma became more hoppy and piney. Smooth and balanced with an adequate hop and malt presence. A litle bitter on the finish but still a decent brew."
"Overall: Another great IPA, I suppose you could even call this a Double-IPA. Whatever you want to call it, or label, or pigeon hole it as, I like this offering from Lagunitas, and given its bargain for quality/strength price  it is well worth it!!!"
"This goes into the book as a moderate IPA. Pours a clear light amber color with an impressive creamy head. The aroma is mild and floral with a small rounded malt to it. Initially light body with a quick smooth malt flavor followed by a decent floral hop spice. The body barely helps emphasize the malt by the light texture creates an easy drinking ale. Not a bad amount of bitterness, but not a beast by any means."
"Pours """real-beer," regal amber with a """real-beer," rock-of-ages head. Super nose reveals strong, full, dextrine body, with hops solely playing the role of understudy for balance--which is quite signifigant, to hold up a body like this one. Floral/oaky notes give a full-frontal flash for shock value, and then quickly tuck away, leaving the receiver in wait for the next peek."
"After spending Saturday night drinking Stone IPA on tap in San Diego, I popped a bomber of Maximus in the comfort of my own home on a late Sunday afternoon and was quite pleasantly surprised. It pours more or less standard issue IPA color: golden with a hint of orange. The head is white and foamy and leaves a little layer on top of the beer to the bottom of the glass. The smell is aggressively hoppy but not overwhelmingly so. Aromas of grapefruit and pine float over the glass. In the first few drinks, the hops really seemed to dominate, but things come together nicely after that. Underlying the hop bitterness is a nice sweetness that becomes a bit more pronounced as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is good, and it goes down well for a beer if its ABV and IBU. This is my favorite Lagunitas so far."
"The aroma was a bit green. The smell is that of barn, or like the tractor pulling the hop bails. Maybe its they use Nuggets. The maltines compliments the hops well. The sweetness matches well with the bitterness. The body (it is 7+%) is significant, and makes for its own beer session."
"Big white head, dark orange color. Aroma: fresh, floral, fruity, hoppy. This is self-hyped as highly hopped, hence the boastful name, but on first sip, I'm not overwhelmed. First impression: a more alcoholic extra pale ale, but not the hoppiest of IPAs by a long shot. Smooth palate, medium body, easy-drinking.But overall, a disappointment."
"Another Big Bad Boy from Lagunitas, and a challenger to Stones great line of IPAs. The color of the beer as it breathes away in the glass is a murky golden amber and the head preposterous in size, frothy in its texture as it degrades; it leaves a thick sheet of lace to cover the glass. Hops dominate the nose, with the underlying malt and citrus crispness I so admire in quality IPAs, what a pleasure for the senses. It starts sweet and the top middling in mouth feel and the finish all Hops, with a moderate carbonation and a droughty aftertaste, another winner in my humble opinion from a great brewery."
"Hazy bright oxidized copper color with a gusher of a head. Tames in about a minute to 1/4 of an inch and foam laces respectably. Hoppy aroma, oily and gravelly citrus rinds that set the nose hairs off. Hopped-up flavor, but not four alarm burning -- more of a sense of candied orange rinds that sit at one high level of bitterness. There is an underpinning of brown sugar malts in this beer that is more noticeable on warming. Finishes slightly thin, but refreshing...a nice bomber, here."
"Pours a cloudy orange copper color with a thick and creamy white head that does a great job of clinging to the sides of the glass while drinking. Strong floral hops in the aroma with notes of lemon and orange peel. The I.B.U. is a 72.41, so as you might expect, its quite bitter. Hop resins dominate the flavor with notes of tart, fresh grapefruit. A definite treat for hopheads out there. I dont necessarily consider myself to be a hophead, but I really enjoyed this beer."
"The alcohol level is true to the style but doesn't add a lot of mouthfeel. A tasty, tasty, brew, but only for true """hopheads"""."
"This beer is a slightly cloudy amber.  The head is white, thick, and long lasting.  Lace is plentiful.  Smells great, very piney.  At 72 units of bitterness I knew it would be over the top.  Finish is very hoppy but a bit soapy.  A real good beer that just misses greatness, at least in my mind.  Moylan's Double IPA is better."
"Beer has a tingling, floral taste, with just a hint of malt which strengthens as the beer warms, becoming quite well-balanced.  Medium-full body with, as you would expect, a very dry finish.  Quite nice."
"Hazy orange-copper color with a nice big head that sticks around.  Leafy, lemony hop aroma and a bit of caramel in the nose, otherwise mostly hop-driven.  Mouthfeel is thin but delicate.  Backbone of mildly citrusy hops are seperate from a slight sweetness that shows up towards the finish.  I thought this beer was a little disorganized and not the most complex IPA I've tasted, but it looks great and is pretty drinkable."
"Beautiful thick head on the pour never to spill over onto the sides of my glass, even when cresting above the rim. Deep cloudy copper color and hints of citus in the aroma. Great hop taste also. Be warned of the near artistic type lace that will appear on the inside of your drinking vessel. If you don't rinse it out when finished with your drinking session, some elbow grease will probably be needed to remove its beauty. Just one more great IPA for all hopheads to enjoy."
"Hazy dark orange hue, topped by a fluffy and sticky head.  Decent lace is left.  Grapefruit and slightly perfumy hop nose upfront, but a wave of slightly tart fruity esters follows.  Light caramel malt sweetness is perceptible in the aroma as the brew warms and the hop oils dissapate, but is still overshadowed by the classic citrusy hop nose. Very aromatic.  Although assertively bitter, it isn't cloyingly so, and yeast fruitiness, light caramel and biscuit / victory malt is discernible and well - integrated.  Tastewise, it is reminecent of a grapefruit w/ brown sugar sprinkles.  A touch of butterscotch adds complexity.  A tad thin in body, but otherwise a fine IPA.  Finishes surprisingly sweet and crisp, almost light on the tongue.  Although not quite as good as some other """double""" IPAs, Maximus is still a well - crafted and appetizing brew-- it's a bit too drinkable and could catch up to you if you love hops."
"Nice fresh husky hop nose....2 inches of frothy head...a little too charged up..medium gold in color...some good hop bittering, but pretty balanced...maybe a bit thin....some very slight b.o. taste(body odor)..or maybe that's just me...solid and better than average...certainly not elite although the nose is pretty good."
"Appearance is golden orange with particles in suspension.  Nice puffy white head with bad retention.  Nice pungency on the nose.  ALso citrus and rind.  Nice tasting IPA.  Love the rind qualities on the buds.  Nice citrus tones.  Overall, a very quaffable IPA.  Did I say very good IPA?"
"Careful when you pour, Maximus is very easily aggitated.  Respect this beer and in return it will respect you.  Prost."
"I love IPA's, and is this ever an IPA to be reckoned with!  Very attractive golden color with a nice rocky white head and good lace down the side of the glass as I slurped it up.  Hops are front and center in the nose and palate, but I was surprised that the 72.41 IBU's didn't overwhelm me.  Contrary to what someone wrote on this page, I did not find the mouthfeel syrupy -- just crisp and refreshing.  The 7.5% abv was well-disguised.  I hope this brew is still available in Houston this summer when I'm in need of a serious respite from the heat and humidity."
"Ah, Lagunitas.  This IPA kicks ass, what is it about west coast IPAs?  Some eastern brewers try, but they are not willing or chicken to allow drinkers to taste hops.  There is no mistaking, this beer has hops, hops, HOPS!  I love this brewery, it's in my top twenty berweries to retire to.  Not to live near - But in the brewery.  Can't wait to be back in California (existing in Maine) for Christmas.  How much can I take on the plane?"
"To me this IPA is one of the best!! It may have a large bitterness at 72.4 IBU but the best hting is it has enough malt to back it up. ALthough bitter it has balance. With a respectable 7.5% one 22oz is just enough. A must try for the Hop-head and non  Hop-head alike."
