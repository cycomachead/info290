"OVERALL/DRINKABILITY - Simple, OK, drinkable."
""
""
"it was just ok in my opinion"
""
"What she said (smell): """Papaya, definitely papaya.""" (taste): """Bitter.""""
"I may have gotten an old bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Gorgeous bouquet, average head. My feeling is this the right coloring for this beer.  First sip does not disappoint. Liquid simcoe.  The piney bitterness envelopes the senses all the way down.  This should make a hop-head connoisseur's Top 5 list."
""
""
""
""
"On draft 12oz L: dark orange and cloudy nice head and some lacing. S: fruity citrus, pine, earthy and some herbal notes T: dark fruits,Orange resonous, pine, earthy. Good balance of malts I can really taste every bit of the Simcoe M: good carbonation, thick feeling but not syurp, dry very sweet O: An interesting DIPA I really enjoyed it."
""
""
""
"A solid IPA!  The simcoe hops may be the most flavorful in my opinion. This is a really nice West Coast style beer.  The hops are up front and the beer packs a nice punch at 9% ABV.  The hoppiness is present and spicy.  The overall appeal to me is the bite of the hops.  This is a must try!"
""
"Heavy and decently hoppy, but a little hard to swallow."

"Appearance 3.5, Aroma 4.25, Flavor 4.25, Palate 4.5, Overall 4.25"
""
"I'm not sure what to make of this beer, it's full bodied, not too piney, not citrusy at all...I'd say it's worth another visit"
"O - Really solid DIPA - I really like this brew and would try it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought this was a good beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, even though the bitterness was on the lower side for the style, the hop flavors showed up nicely with some good fruity hop flavors and aromas.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, a little crisp, the alcohol was a little well hidden, slightly creamy, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I think a couple of these would be a good amount for me, any more than that and the alcohol might start to wear on me.  What I like the most about this beer was the hop profile, it was nice and fruity while imparting some good flavors and aromas.  What I liked the least about this beer was that it didn't just a little more bitterness to help balance out the sweetness.  I would buy this beer again, especially if I could find it really fresh.  I would recommend this beer, especially if you like fruity DIPA's.  All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it had just about everything that I expect from the style with a nice hop profile to go with it.  This beer made for a good first impression of Weyerbacher and I'm really interested in trying more of their beers.  Good job guys, this was a tasty DIPA, keep it up."
""
""
""
"Overall: It's a good beer but it just didn't stand out in any way, and really it didn't showcase Simcoe or bring it out into the foreground, despite the giant bold """DOUBLE SIMCOE""" on the label. I don't want to make this sound like it's a bad DIPA or anything, it just isn't at the top of my recommendation list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A little too malty for my liking."
""
"Overall - Damn solid DIPA. My Yoda-sense tells me 'An occasional buy it would be if in my neck of the woods it were available.' It's certainly got that West Coast vibe, but drinks more like an Oregon product than a SoCal offering. If you can get it, try it!"
""
"I will purchase a 4 pack of this next time I see in the supermarket and revise this review."
"O - Simcoe. Love the aroma, good hop/malt balance, and the heat is well hidden."
""
""
""
"Like drinking toffee/bread/ass with little so so hops.  Way too malty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good taste and hoppy flavor"
""
"A bit unbalanced, and nothing special about the hop profile."
""
""
""
""
""
"The alcohol is also very well-hidden, lending itself to the dry grapefruit as well as the toasty malt flavours.  Thanks Chris!"
""
""
"A little more bitter than I prefer, and simcoe isn't my favorite hop, but it's a well crafted brew."
""
""
""
""
"O-This is a pretty good beer. The balance between the hops and malts will appeal to those who like their IIPAs with more than just hop juiciness. The feel is also on the heavy side, so the beer drinks a little more full than many IIPAs. I don't think this ranks above numerous other IIPAs, but it I would drink it again."
"This IPA does not have that normal bite, but an almost softer taste the whole way through"
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow...if this is the regular, I can't wait to try the Unfiltered. Delicious...."

"The nice cloudy orangey body with the thick white head has huge amounts of suspended particulate. It doesn't settle, but churn with the carbonation. Nothing on the bottle says """bottle conditioned""". The aroma has nice tropical fruit tones but it pretty muted. The taste, though, brings it all together, though, with nice simcoe profile. The silt doesn't meddle with the body, either. Wish the production had been better because this should be an awesome beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  Nicely hoppy, but not overpowering and tiring of the palate.  Went very well with food (Gryo pizza in this case) and I would not have minded having another if I had not had another beer previously.  Dangerously drinkable as well....the alcohol is well hidden.  A very well crafted single hop beer!"
""
""
"The nose evokes sniffing citrus in a moist pine forest. On tap pours hazy copper amber with a ½” white foam cap. Herbal astringency seasons and balances a very creamy palate of citrusy fruit and light caramel notes leading to a drying finish. Together, especially in the middle the flavors suggest a hopped pear. Very fine soft carbonation and a medium body."

"took me to a cough syrupy place."
""
""
"As an IPA fan I was pretty disappointed with the Double Simcoe, but other hop-heads may enjoy.  With the high ABV it might be interesting to cellar this beer for a bit to see if it mellows out..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured on draft into a chalice, aroma is malty with herbal notes. Taste is very malt forward but the hops are present, there is a light sweetness as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with an almost silky feeling. Overall a great DIPA"

"I recently had the unfiltered Double Simcoe and I have to say I was very surprised. It had a lot going on with a rich nose of grapefruit, banana, and pine to add a crispness. On the palate it definitely lived up to its aromas. At first it has a rich flavor of banana, orange peel and tropical fruit which leads to slight notes of pine and bread to finish out with. I love all the elements of this one and would definitely recommend it! Its different and interesting with rich flavor."

"On edit (12/30/14) - I had the opportunity to taste the draft and bottle (unfiltered) versions side by side.  The bottle version is several shades darker.  The aroma is all malt - no hop profile at all.  The flavor reminds me more of a barley wine than a DIPA - balanced, but skewing towards the malt side.  The bottle version is, for all intents and purposes, a different beer."

"Overall, one of the more underwhelming DIPAs I've had. Not bad, at all, but definitely wouldn't be my first recommendation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o; Perhaps it's the Simcoe hops that color it darker and flavor it differently than a wheat usually is. But this is a good brew, though at first at least a bit too vaguely fruity and bitter to be called delicious. Probably significantly better when fresh. Still, satisfying."

"Not a huge fan of the vinous fruit and fruity esters in this DIPA. It really is a huge and impressive beer. The Simcoe really swings into the dank and piney darkness with this malt profile making it one dimensional. I can see where this could have a big following it's just not in my wheel house."

"Overall a good balance between the caramel/fruit sweetness and the citrus/pine bitterness, very enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber with a slightly tinted head. Mild hop nose. Aroma of pine and grass from pour. Taste is medium to strong bitter. Mouth feel and finish were pleasant. Like many other reviews it comes down to the individual tasters opinion. I enjoy the use of simcoe when used in combination with other hops. All simcoe is not to my liking."
""
""
""
"O- nice showcase of the simcoe hop that lets the hops shine"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This was bottled 5 months ago and still tasted great. It coats the mouth with hops and sweet malts which linger on the palate. I can only imagine how it tastes fresh with more bright fruit present. And I'm going to find out soon because it's abundant in my area. I overlooked Weyerbacher for a while but that is no more. Solid DIPA"
""
""
""
"One of my all time favorites. Great taste at any drinking tempature. The nice thing of it is that if u don't want to commit to a whole case u can get in the heavy beers sampler pack. It is very potent but most doubles are excellent beer can't go wrong with this beer. Definitely on my top 5 IPA list"

"O: Weyerbacher is another respectable PA brewery that I always keep and eye out for. This is the 2nd brew I've had the chance to review (albeit the 5th or 6th I've tried) and is definitely their shining star. A total hop-bomb without wrecking the palate. Truly a treat to drink and it'll be finding its way into my fridge a lot more often."

"Bought an assortment case in Northeastern PA. Have had the Old Heathen and a couple other brews from Weyerbacher before, but their example of an Imperial IPA is incredible. The malt balances with the Hops to create one of the more drinkable IPA's I've had (particularly considering it's a daunting 9% ABV). Not overwhelmingly carbonated, a great choice for a summer beer!"

"Picked up as part of a mixed 6 as a what the hell, lets give it a try. Appearance is murkier than most IPAs but a good looking beer with decent head. Did not have that great IPA smell, rather bland. Taste left a lot to be desired, a lot of bitter without the taste and balance. 9% gives a couple bonus points and did improve as it warmed with bitterness fading but overall was disappointing."
""
""
""
"The bottle poured out with a nice foam head and an deep orange-gold color. Taste, smell, flavor, finish, everything was a plus with this beer. Definitely will get again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall one of my favorite beers anytime I can get it. Pricey but well worth it."
""
""
""
""
"Very good DIPA, not overly sweet and with a well-defined character. Go straight to the point."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – It's not that great. Bottled on 11/08/13 this beer shouldn't be out of date already. Tastes like an average IPA, with a little too much funky-ness. 3.75"

"O - Another wonderful beer from Weyerbacher, these breweries here in PA really know their stuff! The flavor was wonderful, the double IPA really lives up to its name with this one, and I can't wait for another!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-great DIPA very complex and hides the ABV"
""
""
"Edit: Had another that was bottled 5/16/13 (Don't know if I missed the bottle date on the other or what) which makes it almost 8 months old. Phenomenal. The hops all remained and were even brighter than the other and everything was smooth and balanced. Either the other one was even older than this one or the fact that this one was kept refrigerated almost the entire time (a forgotten bottle in the back of my mom's fridge) made all the difference in the world."
""
"A solid offering from Weyerbacher. This blends malt sweetness and hop bitterness perfectly. I think I could actually session this beer. One of those I do not buy often because it comes in a 4 pack, and then whenever I do, I wonder why I often pass it up. Should have at least one in the back of my fridge at all times. Give this to a friend who swears he or she does not like overly hoppy beers. Perfect gateway beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Very average. There is nothing that stands out in this beer. I'd drink it again but I wouldn't seek it out."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O - A very well balanced DIPA. Simcoe hops and sweet malts balance out well. Definetly worth trying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- This is a really good beer. It is very well balanced between the Simcoe hops and powerful malt presence. Again, ABV is almost completely unnoticeable. I would definitely have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If you want Simcoe, this brings it at the highest level. Very good showcase for Simcoe hops. I would seek this for a single hop experience that isn't a grapefruit bomb."

"Overall- Not exactly balanced, but few Double IPAs are in my opinion. Definitely a hop lovers beer, and a good one at that. I highly recommend and look forward to the next three in my fridge."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this one. I tend to like my big IPAs on the citrus side of things, but this one certainly did what it wanted to do and did it well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a creative offering, with a unique hop character. Its flavor doesn't thrill me, but the craft deserves recognition."
""

""

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: flavors I've tasted in many 2x IPAs.... if by """outstanding""" we mean """does it stand out?""" then, yes, I suppose it does stand out from the average 2x IPA - all thanks to the Simcoe.... it's a good beer, but probably not something I'd want to drink more than 2 of in one sitting"

"O: I swore I'd give this a second chance when I reviewed a single that seemed like it was from the Reagan administration. I'm glad I did: while it's not in the upper tier of DIPAs, it's an enjoyable example of a 'malty' DIPA. And I dislike malty DIPAs."

"Overall this is a fantastic DIPA, and one of my favorite Weyerbacher beers. It's a great focus on a great hop that ends up being very flavorful. I would have rated this even better if it weren't for a slight bit of the abv showing through."
""
""

"Not as good as i remember, not sure how fresh this was either. But not bad either, nice showcase of Simcoe, i just wish the beer and the maltiness wasn't so distracting."
""
""
""
"Overall- a unique IPA that really hits a single note with the hops. If you like piney flavors in the hops, this is one to try. If you're going for more of a citrus/floral note, don't go with this one."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Coats the palate with a blast of hops and a moderately boozy note that doesn't really linger very long. Overall a pricey 4 pack worthy of a purchase because it is a good quality IIPA that really doesn't look or taste like any other."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good beer, but for the price I will grab something that in my opinion smashes it. I do not dislike it believe me, after a long day of work and paired with a turkey burger I took my time to finally give this brew a review. Salud!"
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a life changer, But a solid DIPA nonetheless."
"AFTERTASTE = Hop hit is only in the lingering aftertaste where the herbal/floral"
""
""
""

"Overall this beer is GREAT! If you like IPA's buy it, if you like strong beers buy it, if you like well made beers that have balance and real flavour then buy it twice!"
""
"overall - would buy again"
""
""
"O-a decent DIPA, a little more malty than I prefer, but solid nonetheless"
""
""
"Overall- I wonder if this IPA was not too fresh? I hope to try it again and edit this review in the future."
"P.S. After reading some of the other reviews, this has to be an older bottle. All of the aggressive flavors that others have described just aren't present in the bottle I'm drinking. This may be worth trying fresh then aging for comparison."
""
""
""
" one of the best single hopped dipas out there and quite a surprise they get all their flavors from one hop. great dipa"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: Bottle"
"Mouth feel is medium bodied. Good solid body for a DIPA. Moderate carbonation. Some alcohol warmth."
"O - This is a good double IPA, simcoe hops are definitely some of my favorite hops, and I've had other single hopped simcoe IPA's and they really do well for themselves. Definitely would like to have on draft."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty tasty brew that hides the abv pretty well. More malt centric than I was expecting but I enjoy it. Well balanced and clean with good hop presence."
""
"into a walkie talkie"
"This reminds me of why I HATE numerically scoring a brew. Notes are good....Cause my """rating""" in unfairly going to be low."
""
"As far as DIPAs go, this one is middle of the road in my opinion. The hops just didn't have strong enough presence, and the presence that they did have was not that tasty. I'd pass on another one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Enjoyable double ipa. The alcohol is well hidden and does not drink like a 9.0 abv. Lacks in the tasting department for me. Love the aroma but the taste is not well balanced. To bitter throughout the whole palate."
""
""
"Dark, pumpkin amber with blonde highlights when backlit and impossible to see through. Pretty looking creamy head of sand colored foam that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. Nice Simcoe hop aroma with fresh dough and caramel. This beer is delicious, grapefruit and pine sappy hops with a hefty caramel malt backbone. Full bodied and creamy with fine smooth carbonation. This is a very good ale and very drinkable for the higher ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Hazy dark brown/copper with white frothy head. Smell is of pine and hops. Not overtly hoppy especially for a iipa, but has a lingering hoppy and piney aftertaste that continues for quite a while. Mouthfeel is good and beer is well balanced, not too light or heavy. Drinks quite easily for a 9% iipa and I am drinking this after a big dinner out. All around a good local iipa that I won't actively seek out but will probably pick up occasionally."
""
""
"O- This is my first (to my knowledge) experience with Simcoe hops, and I think they are truly intriguing. All that flavor without an overwhelming amount of bitterness. The dirty rugged look, and the pine aroma and taste really inspire me to hike into the middle of an evergreen forest, start a fire, and pop open this beer. Quite an experience."
""
""
"Overall not a bad IPA. Some days the hops are too much for me other days I love them so I think on another day I might rate it higher."
""
""
""
""
""
"One of my favorite DIPAs."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Good DIPA. Very drinkable. Hop flavors were all enjoyable and there was a good balance between the malty backbone and the upfront hops. Ditch the single and pick up a pack of this."
""
""
"Overall this was good. Good example of a DIPA. Lots of hop flavor, moderate bitterness and a good sweetness to help with the balance."
"Pours hazy copper with a small head. Very strong aroma. Mostly pine and hops, a bit of floral aroma on this one, really beautiful. Taste is in your face hops with a solid malt backbone, plenty of bitter pine. Tiny bit of grapefruit. Lingering hop bitterness after some caramel malt on the palate. Definitely focused on the bitterness here. HIgh carbonation and slick in between the bubbles. Nice beer and often overlooked in the top DIPA discussion."

"O - I was very surprised to see I hadn't reviewed this beer yet. It is in my regular rotation and I grab a 4-pack when I want to get my piney hop fix. The aroma is divine and the flavors are complex without anything out of place. This is one of the benchmark DIPAs from one of the benchmark breweries, in my opinion. I highly recommend this beer, but make sure you get it fresh if you like the pine. It mellows into a good balanced DIPA after 4-6 weeks, but I much prefer it AFAP."

"Thick rich khaki head with an orange amber with a tinge of gold. Slow fade leaves copious lacing and a lovely glass with a light covering on top. Smell is deep with pine and citrus. A thick bed of caramel malt and toffee. A touch of yeast esters, tropical fruitiness. Flavor starts with malt and tropical fruit, then BAM! Hops hit with a pine forest front and a grapefruit finish. Lots of hop oiliness clinging to my mouth and a hint of mint. Alcohol is well integrated and not bringing much attention to itself. Feel is kind of thick with a bit of syrup and an mild but effective carbonation. Very drinkable and a great DIPA that acts like a regular IPA. Hoppy and easy drinkin'/"
""
""
"Overall- Better than I was expecting it to be. For a DIPA, it's actually well-balanced and I liked the maltiness- I might actually compare that maltiness of DFH's 60 minute with the bitterness of their 90 minute. This is the closest comparison I can think of and I'm not surprised as DFH uses Simcoe as one of their hops. Personally, I'm not a huge fan since my palate has adjusted too much to hoppy DIPAs, but I did taste this about 4 hours after drinking a Hopslam. I have another bottle in the fridge so if anything changes, I'll edit the review. But otherwise it is what it is for now- a good DIPA with a good, earthy malt presence. (4)"
"M- Sticky and citrusy! It really envelopes your tongue with honey, tangerine and pine sap. Nice carbonation upfront, but it dies down rather quickly and coats the tongue nicely."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, this is a good beer. No where near my favorites in the style, but certainly well above average. Id drink this again for sure."
""

"surprisingly sweet with great balance/interplay between the hops and the malt. the simcoe is not my favorite but it shines here: buttery, chewy, tastes like simcoe gummy worms."

"Gummy top, three finger head with a deep amber colored body. Scents of high end, resiny hops with some more hoppy scents of hot oil. Wow, full-bodied malty goodness with a screaming flow of hop towards the top of palate and back of the tongue. Rich malts with kick ass hops flow through the sip. Citrus acid and grapefruit resonate. No wonder they claim this single hop variety was grown in a laboratory. Very full creamy mouth feel but very high alcohol presence, in which, it actually resembles more from a standard IPA tradition than a double IPA. Nonetheless, an outstanding huge beer for hop fanatics!"
""
""
""
"An intense grapefruit profile comes across on the flavor. I get grapefruit oils and resins, finishing with some chew and a balanced heft. It’s not as intensely bitter as I had expected and there’s a pleasing malt body which gives it a nice thickness. Really, really enjoyable."
"Unfortunately there was not a bottling date on this, so I had no way of knowing its age. The only reason I say that is because the hops weren't quite as bitter as I expected them to be, even though their presence was clearly felt (and contributed to much of the flavor). Still a damn good beer, I can clearly see why people love this one. Very heavy, so take this one slow. I need to get my hands on a confirmed fresh one."
""
""
""
"O: Delicious and what I had hoped it would be since I first tried it. A great """East Coast""" Double IPA. Make sure you only try it fresh or within a few months of the bottling date!"
""
""
"Medium-full bodied, medium carbonation, sort of average in the smooth and creamy department; but has a bit of sticky chewiness to it as well. Good and reliable and big and bold; it doesn’t punch you in the face with over-the-top hops and booze, but it slaps you around a bit."
""
""
""
"O: I like the particles. This beer looks really nice and the mouthfeel is smooth. Tastes good too."
"O- malty double ipa with strong bitterness. I like it"
""
""
""
""

"fantastic double ipa for the bitter hop people. this is one bitter bastard. it pours a hazy bronze color with a prominent white head more than two inches tall. there are huge chunks of yeast floating around, bigger globs than i think ive ever seen, but the beer still looks very inviting. the nose is real bitter hops, oily and up front, with subtle fruity notes from the yeast in there as well. flavor is true to the smell, with the pungent hop character taking full control. there is also a bit of an alcohol burn on the back end, which combined with the hop bitterness makes this beer a real firebreather. green veggies and intense hops throughout. great mouthfeel too, with bright carbonation and a hefty medium body. its very soothing going down, and this is a 4 pack i could happily consume in an evening. overall a distinctively hopped double ipa, worthy of its excellent ratings."

"Pours a very murky orange-golden color with a quickly attenuating antique white head. Not a remarkably gorgeous beer. Not a big nose, but I pick up some cider right away. Mouthfeeel is pretty wet and slick with a dryer finish. The hop presence helps dry it out even more. First sip wasn't impressive. However, as I drink it, it gets better. I'm a Simcoe hop fan, so I might've anticipated trying this one a little too much. I do like it. It's well above average as a DIPA, just not in the same ballpark as the Double Jacks, Abrasives, and Pure Hoppinesses. The alcohol underlies the flavors. The bitterness of the alcohol sort of carries the flavors along without affecting them to drastically. A lot of bread and sweet cherry cordials. I like it a lot better as it warms up. It's much tangier and more citrusy cold. It gets sweet as it warms. There's some pine flavor in there. I think it is pretty complex. I'm a bigger fan now than I was in the beginning."

"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in weight, with medium intensity carbonation, that lends to a slightly fizzy, but overall acceptable feel for a double IPA. The ethanol is what hurts here, easily felt alcohol burn across the tongue and throat, and felt in the nostrils. Finishes fairly dry, as one would expect from the hop and ethanol content."
""
""
""

""
""
""
"M: Medium bodied."
"The review of this alky IIPA imitation is short as was the drinking experience interrupted only by drain pour. I understand the beer might be old with diminished hop-qualities but the obnoxious alcohol revealing poor brewing skills cannot be ignored (330 ml into tulip, no Bottling date (what else))."
"O: rich, strong and hoppy as expected, without being too challenging to drink."
""
""
""
"Overall this is great. Will be on the lookout for more."
"Small to medium vast creamy head on top of a hazy warm orange colored beer. Smell is a very nice mix of hops, citrus, fruit, mango, peach, and barleys. The taste is very well balanced too, first a nice full fruity flavour hits the palate which gentle turns into a more and more bitter aftertaste with a nice touch of pine and cactus. The taste is fruity with mango, peach, pine, honey, sweet barleys and malts and some sweets,but doesn’t seem to loose it in it’s sweetness, good bitter, hops, citrus, grass, yeast, hop flowers. This beer actually tastes very crisp. The aftertaste is a good bitter with a nice mix of hops, citrus, herbs, grass, nettle, light hints of fruit. Low carbonation, soft creamy mouthfeel, full body and a creamy/oily, sticky and well balanced texture."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good ale but not in my top picks for the style."
""
"O: Overall this hop variety has always been tough for me to describe; this beer was no different. There is a lot of Simcoe here, and this is definitely a bigger hop-forward DIPA. Pretty good stuff IMO."
""
"O: really solid dipa but i feel as if it doesn't represent the floral tropical taste of simcoe hops as well as it could have I enjoyed the HFS single simcoe much more in terms of the hop profile but a pretty good beer that I would drink again"
""
""
""
""

"Copper colored liquid, somewhat hazy, with a nice puff of white head that retained well and left sploches of lacing on the glass. Aroma is expectedly hoppy, citrus, pine, tropical fruit, hint of mint and earth. Nice taste, hoppy, as promised by the aroma, pine, citrus, pithy bitterness, crisp, subtle fruit sweetness melded with a distant pale malt base. Medium body, some alcohol heat, average carbonation. Nice option for an easily-accessible / local DIPA."
""
"O: Solid double ipa – A nice sipping beer @ 9% abv. Love the simcoe hops!"
""
""
"A well balanced hoppy potent ale. Holds its strength pretty well, you feel it more as it goes. Good strong hoppiness but manages not to be too bitter. Good beer to enjoy slowly, another winner from Weyerbacher."
""
""
""
"O: Didn’t blow my face off, but did stand out with the amount of complexity it showed. From a technical point of view, there were a some indications that this was an exceptionally crafted beer. I'll have another."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very one-dimensional IIPA and way too sweet. I know these beers are supposed to be over the top but I still expect some sort of balance between malt and hops. This is just a sugar bomb with some hops thrown in. Not something I will pick up again."
""
"If I'm in the mood for a sweet fruity DIPA in the future, this is the beer. If I'm more interested in a drier beer without the sticky sweetness, this beer would not be a first choice."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Nice hop bomb. I liked it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O--Should be a testament to the complexities of Simcoe. Instead it's a fruit bomb. Down the drain it went, little lamented."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good tasting brew, but lacks the viscous mouthfeel and added carbonation that is more typical of this style. I would also prefer a bit more to the aroma to add to the overall experience. Not something I would turn down if offered, but probably not something I would seek out again at a fairly pricey $12/4pack."
""
""
"O: This was a really cool IPA. It was very sweet. The first part of the taste was a very sweet buttery caramel, and then, very quickly, a floral and bitter hops rush joined in to balance all that sweetness. It was not very complex, but it was the simplicity that made it so appealing. It was bold, simple, and enjoyable. And, it was certainly a top notch double IPA."
"Verdict: Pretty decent IPA. Nothing special, perhaps I have an older bottle, but with no bottling info, I have to assume this is moderately fresh. The overwhelming maltiness really doesn't do anything for me, but for anyone who likes a big bitter beer, this is for you."
""
""
""
"O- This is a solid DIPA, would love to try this puppy fresh because I bet mines quite old."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an excellent double IPA. The drinkablity and complexity was just off the charts."
"This is a sipper and one to relax and enjoy. A great display of all aspects of the Simcoe hop balanced evenly with a serious malt backbone."

"O - I was looking forward to this one to get to know Simcoe hops better, but it is not for me. There is a gross and distracting taste component in there that I can't shake. I can tell that the beer underneath that is a good one, but that flavor note throws it off for me, which makes it hard to score on taste. I've never had cats so I don't know if this is the cat pee note that everyone talks about with simcoe hops, but I don't like it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - clearly this is one of my absolute favorite beers. It's such an aggressive assault on the senses that traditional terms like """balanced""" and """complex""" apply, but only if one is referring to a gladiator. Whoever is in charge of constructing this monster on a regular basis is a genius; even though the beer may vary ever-so-slightly from batch to batch, it maintains a distinctly dominating tropical citrus flavor profile and especially a chewy mouthfeel that has made me pull this off the shelf several times a month for over 3 years now. If you're trying this for the first time and the hop bitterness is overwhelming, please just give it time to warm up and balance out"
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a tasty DIPA. It has some of the best head formation and retention around as far as American DIPAs go. It is on the darker side as far as color, which matches up with the increased caramel malt presence in the aroma and taste. Even with all the malty sweetness, Simcoe hops are the name of the game here. Because only Simcoe hops were used, this beer doesn’t have the big bouquet that a lot of DIPAs have but it still has a lot to offer. Very tasty offering from Weyerbacher."
""
"355ml bottle. ½ Pint glass. Revisited on agt´12. Orangish amber. Chill haze. White, creamy, thick layer crown lasts until last drop. Foam looks rocky as meringue & leaves copious rings too. Citric –orange & strong grapefruit- resiny & piney aromas. Hoppy attack at first sip is rounded by citric & tropical fruit notes, herbal & grassy hues as well. Standing up on line malts provide a firm toasted, kind of caramel flavor & feeling. Medium to full body. Soft carbonation. Oily, dense, texture. Increasing citric & pine counterattack in the middle toward the long sharp bitter finish. Ripe fruit on the aftertaste. Great & flavorful II IPA. Refreshing & delightful with exceptionally well hidden ABV. Good job!!."

"O: Potent and earthy with good balance."

"O- A great DIPA and I with definitely pick this up again. Alcohol is well hidden and this is very easy to drink."
"O: This one will creep up on you. Whoa. Almost dangerously drinkable. I think as an example of a single hop DIPA, it's great. As a DIPA it's well above average. Excellent work here - might be my go to DIPA due to its drinkability."

"This is a nicely hopped, fruity, citrusy DIPA. The presence of peaches along with the mango and pineapple was unique to me and rather enjoyable. A bit more body I think would help tremendously, but otherwise this was a decent DIPA."

"O: Drinks kinda like a barleywine, not sure how fresh. Hops may have had time to fad but this is one of the darkest colors I've seen from a IPA or DIPA. Simcoe taste profile is beautiful on its own, but as its not overly complex, nice malt profile comes through."
"Overall have had some fresher batches that may have rated a little higher. Still a serious IPA that can run with the big dogs. Love the fact its focused on a single hop."
"An impressive DIPA I'd highly recommend."
""
"Pours brownsih amber with remaining layer of white foam. Some lacing. Strong earthy pine smell. Forresty. Almost minty. Taste is a supremely bitter blend, with some very buried bready notes. Powerful hop takes hold and rolls through to the finish. Pronounced in the aftertaste. Good flavor - the bitterness is a touch too much."
"Overall: I've had it fresher and its far better, but even with a few extra months on it it's still a top notch DIPA."
""
""
"O - Overall, this is a solid, easy to find, imperial IPA. I think this would be a great entry DIPA for someone learning to enjoy the style. It's also a great example of a nicely balanced DIPA."
""
"Full bodied, lightly effervescent for the style and a lot smoother than I anticipated. I'm not a bit IPA guy but this is pretty good. Almost feels like an imperial after the swallow."
""
""
""
"The hop profile is very interesting, but the malts are just too sweet for me. I might have to try this again, with a 12oz bottle. There is an abundance of yeast in here... Kind of good, but odd."
""
"Overall: Starts off strong, but fades with time. Good depth of flavor, but there's a bit of depth missing."
"Poured from tap into pint at yardhouse hallandale beach florida. Pours a slightly orangey brown color with thick off white head. Sticky lacing. Smells of sweet malty pine hops. Taste is very heavy malted sweet hop. But it has a very bitter mouthfeel. Its well balanced and surprisingly easy to drink for the abv. Nice brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Often, an IPA gives you a quick flash of sweetness and then intense bitterness. Here, I get an intense hop bitterness as soon as it touches my tongue, yet there always seems to be a faint caramel-like sweetness in the backdrop which balances it out nicely all the way through the finish. If I was handed this in a blind tasting and asked to guess the style, I might even guess ``American Barleywine''."
""
""
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours hazy reddish orange color with a nice 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big mango, pineapple, orange, apricot, grapefruit, herbal, caramel, light pine, and earthy spices. Nice and well balanced aromas with good strength. Taste of big orange zest, pineapple, grapefruit, mango, pine, floral, caramel, tangerine, grass, and herbal spiciness. Good amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, tropical fruit, caramel, pine, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice hop flavor complexity(Simcoe rules); with a fantastic balance of malt sweetness. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a small warming after the finish noticed. Very smooth and easy to sip on for 9%. Overall this is a highly excellent DIPA! Great flavor balance and complexity; and extremely smooth. Really great stuff."

"My first beer from Weyerbacher, and I look forward to trying others. Very pleasantly surprised--to be honest, I had never heard of this brewery until I saw it on the shelf at the beer store.

"Had two pints on tap at Sidney restaurant in East Berlin, PA. What a powerful Brew! So much flavor to this beer and the alcohol content really sneaks up on you. When the waiter told me it was 9 percent abv I didn't believe him but it was the truth...weyerbacher misses in a few beer styles but this one is a winner."

"Overall – A solid DIPA. I taste/feel no alcohol. However, a bit sweeter than I would have liked. The fruits shine through well but I wish the sweet malty backbone was a bit more subdued. However, not to stereotype but seeing as it is an East Coast DIPA, it is not “unexpected”. However, still a very drinkable beer and I would not turn this away if offered it."

"It's quite nice and interesting. I would buy this on tap any time except when I can't handle the big beer that this is. I just hope it does not end my evening too early. we have this and another huge growler to finish between us."

"Very good brew. Amazing hop profile with a good balancing malt backbone that is actually very well represented and not shy. Awesome hop bitterness in the middle and toward the back end."
"Ruddy auburn color with a modest off-white head. Nose is on the sweet side, full of juicy citrus/tropical fruit hops with a touch of pine. The taste packs a big bittering punch to go along with the big fruity hop flavors evident in the nose. Bready caramel malt sweetness melds with the big lasting bitterness in the finish. Slightly oily feeling with moderate carbonation. I have an appreciation for beers that unequivocally put certain ingredients on display. This beer is a great representation of the virtues of the Simcoe hop."
"Man...this is some dank stuff. It’s been two years nearly to the day since I tried and reviewed the Unfiltered version and this is pretty much equally as impressive. I’d really have to do them side-by-side to pick out any differences. Easily one of the most resinous, dank and ridiculous DIPAs I’ve had...gotta love the fact that this makes cat piss an enjoyable experience!"

"1.5 Finger head with lots of lacing on a reddish amber cloudy body. The aroma is excellent with lots of hops and citrus with a nice pine note. Very flavorful with a strong bubble gum note with lots of hops, citrus and pine. Very complex overall for what seems like a single hop IPA. I wonder if others are added as well. Medium body and moderate carbonation with a sharp finish."

"Served in a tulip glass at The Cask Republic in New Haven, CT, this shows a hazy musty-brown color with a big creamy light oatmeal colored head and a wall of lacing. The aroma is a pleasant citrus hop and mild toffee. Quite reserved. The flavor brings....ahhh...thick and sweet pine hops with slight citrus edges and plenty of moxie-like malt. There’s a touch of clove-like mintiness and lots of earthy, near peaty ideas. Really nice. This stuff is near full bodied with a slick, thick feel accompanied by fine and very adequate carbonation. Love it but probably not for sessionists."
""
""
"Deep, very hazy orange in color with a thin, bubbly tan head. Great lacing with the settling. Fresh hops, caramel, honey, sugared citrus, syrup and grapefruit on the aroma. Lots of molasses-like sweetness, thick and rich with smokey notes lingering. Big hop blast with some seriously sweet and sour fruity tones. Rich, full body full of citrus bitterness, syrupy brown sugar-like sweetness, alcohol and yeast. Heavy on the syrup and booze in the mouthfeel. Syrupy, bitter, full flavored double IPA."

"O: Very good beer. A nice hop bomb. The bitterness was all herbal and peppery to me. Well put together and very drinkable. i will be putting this in my fridge."
""
""
"Drinkability is decent for a 9% ABV beverage, but I like to enjoy my IPAs and will take my time with this."
""
""
""
"Not sure what the price is, but based on what I've seen the bottles go for...this is a tasty dipa for the money. The aftertaste is fruity citrus, but not grapefruit rindy and the sugary sweetness is money. I've wanted to try this for awhile and glad I finally got to."
"A surprisingly dark and expectionally smooth tasting double IPA. Despite the darker amber/caramel color Double Simcoe is not very roasty tasting, has more of sweet caramel taste with the hops adding more of a balance to it then a bitterness. Very drinkable, not a very hop forward double. If you are looking for a smooth, malty sweet IPA with good balance this is a good beer. Not mouth numbing in bitterness at all."
""
"Overall because of the alcohol and caramel this feels like a Barleywine-like IIPA that needs some time to smooth out. I don't think the fact that it is a month old really plays into this either, the hops are still pretty damn strong. It certainly has a few dimensions playing into the flavor but I find the alcohol and bitterness combining to feel somewhat harsh."
"Overall, a very enjoyable beer, quite a treat for a birthday beer for myself. I would happily order this up again, and just may do so in the very near future. Thanks Weyerbacher!"
"The balance of this beer is incredible. It shows off all of its best qualities in every aspect of the tasting. Each sip makes you want to take another. I can imagine this beer being in my fridge lots because it is one of the better DIPAs I've ever had. I highly recommend this one if you see it around."

"Overall: Very impressive. The alcohol blends in very well for such a strong beer. I've never heard of an IPA, or any beer, utilizing only 1 variety of hop, and I would have never expected one to be so great."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not really what I expected. I like going into these beers blind, so I was expecting a mouthful of hops. I can't, however, say I'm displeased with the malty character of this beer. Very solid."

"O - Very solid DIPA and nice in that it isn't just a big citrus hop bomb. That being said, I wouldn't mind a little Cascade or Centennial in there to add some complexity. Very good though and will enjoy again."
"Note: That bottle needs a serious makeover - it looks like this beer was brewed by Costco."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall a really really beautiful hoppy brew. Really refreshing and delicious, very bitter and dry. Going to be a glorious night with MNF and a whole growler of this to myself"
"O-A solid DIPA, however it was missing some bitterness to round it out."
"Overall it's pretty good. I'm not blown away by it, but it is a very good beer. Cheers"

"O- I got the chance to try this fresh from the brewery last summer and grabbed a growler. That was tasty! Although Weyerbacher does not distribute to Illinois, Wisconsin isn't far enough away to deter me from grabbing a four pack every now and then, and it is pretty darn good from the bottle too!"

"It was dark, but I've also had this from the bottle so I recall the appearance. On the darker side of pale, possibly indicative of the use of more malts. Smells of grapefruit and a little pine. Creamier for a DIPA, but this adds to the experience for me. It is a DIPA I go to when I want an IPA that's more malt balanced. Overall, not my favorite DIPA, but I'm never sad to see it and I do buy it pretty often. For me, a go to beer when I want something with a lot of hops but don't want a ton of bitterness and want a creamier mouthfeel."

"Overall: This is a very good beer. Most East Coast DIPAs fall of the edge when they reach for 'balance' and end up with an overly-sweet, underhopped mess. This is tasty and intricate and really one-of-a-kind. Its not a beer for hopheads, but its an IPA for fans of subtler style."
""
""
""
" This is one to savor, in a brandy or tulip glass, drink slowly, and make sure the temperature of it is not too cold- This is a 50-60 degree type beer. Really, the only thing I can equate the drinking experience to, is like savoring a well-aged, single-malt, scotch."
""
""
"O: Not good at all. Don't think I'm going to be able to finish this one. No bottling date so I can't tell if it's fresh or not. I would guess so since the hop bitterness is still present. (This fresh one is great. A bit to floral for me but much better than the first one I had.)"

"O - Very good double IPA which draws well-rounded hop flavor from only one variation of hops while balancing nicely with a malty sweetness. Alcohol is a bit stronger than I would prefer, but that is common of the style."

"The beer overall was a little hot. I'm dying to find the triple IPA again. It's been a long time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Different on the hop side, though."
"I really enjoyed this offering. This was great."
"Overall: Not what I'm looking for in a IPA"
"This was a very delicious beer, lots of great flavor and very easy to drink."
"I love Simcoe so this is a great example of an IPA in my opinion. Dank hops and a nice lingering bitterness."
"Drink- So after a trade, my wife bringing me a bottle and a 2nd trade I finally got the bottle I need. A bit less of a head that the unfiltered but a little more smooth. I liked it. Thanks Matt!"
"One of the best DIPA's I have had and is definitely worth trying. Highly recommended."
"O. Good DIPA, would be nice to see it with a few more hop additions to add some more complex hop profile to the beer."
"Overall, the pleasure of the beer gets less with every subsequent sip."
"O: Very easy to drink for being so bold. Great balance between sweet and hoppy. Not my favorite DIPA, but I would never turn down drinking this one again. Very impressive lacing."
"Overall if you like the sweet kind of IIPA's then this is very good I would buy this again"
"Overall nice dipa for only using one hop. Not my favorite but its drinkable, different and has a well hidden abv of 9%, not bad."
"O - Great expression of just one hop. I like the flavors here and its really well balanced. Good 2xIPA showcasing Simcoe as a fantastic hop."
"As much as I liked the mouthfeel and aftertaste, this was just a notch too strong for me. Hopheads will like this beer but as an introduction to Imperial IPA's, this isn't the best first choice. Come winter, I would love to have one of these to warm up with but in a sea of hoppy beers, not enough stands out about this. I will give Weyerbacher credit for pushing the envelope, as I've never had anything quite like this before."
"VERY NICE, CHECK IT OUT!"
"O/D - A solid DIPA. Took time to open up but was nice. Very drinkable and flavourful."
"Well balanced IPA. Very Hoppy but due to the Simcoe Hops its hoppy but not harsh. Relatively high ABV but no """hotness""" from the ABV. An all time favorite. Has nice body and flavor. Leaves a bitter but pleasant aftertaste but (enjoyably) lacks the acidy bite of just heavy hopped DIPA's"
"Pours a very burnt orange with a two finger head that sticks around. Can't see through it. Aroma is fruit punch, passionfruit, guava. Taste starts slightly sweet passionfruit juice, but quickly turns into a bold bitterness that stays until the beer is long gone. Mouthfeel is good with decent carbonation. Overall, very impressive. This is likely the most bitter beer I have ever tried. The only flaw is drinkability. I would like to have tasted more sweetness to balance out the hops. I know this is blasphemy, but I'm interested in seeing how this DIPA does with age."
"O- very enjoyable double ipa. Reminds me of great divide's hercules, probably due to the prominent pine and woody flavors. A great representation of the style in my opinion. Pungent hoppyness, big sweet malt, a touch of alcohol burn, its all there. However, perhaps this beer's exemplary traits are its downfall. Might have liked to see a touch of something different and surprising in there for it to get an A, but I'm sure this beer is exactly what the brewers shot for."
"Overall this is a great DIPA and a near bargain at the price. This could easily become my go-to for a hop fix."
"O: While I was hit a little more (somewhat surprisingly) by the more sessionable Sam Adams Latitude 48 Simcoe, this does nicely for a single serving. Among the better east coast IPA's for sure, but likely doesn't hold up next to the heavyweights out west."
"The drink on this brew is just right. The alcohol is present, but is hidden under the citrus flavors. Watch out though...found out it can sneak up on you. Still a great brew, another fantastic brew by Weyerbacher."
"O - A East Coast, sweet IPA. I don't usually care for sweeter IPAs, but I liked the flavors on this one."
"Not a very nice double IPA for me. Not a very appealing look, and the malts overpower the hops."
"While I personally prefer more floral/citrus aromas with DIPA, this one is really unique and would seek out again."
"Overall: This is a great slow sipping sweeter DIPA that I would go out of my way to buy again. A """must try""" for DIPA fans who want to satisfy those hop cravings."
"Oh well."
"Overall, I could find a few dozen I would pick before this that are just as easy to find year round, but there isn't much to complain about either. I'd like to try it as fresh as possible. I think I will visit the brewery very soon and grab some to ensure a fresh release."
"O- Excellent DIPA. Had this over a year ago and it's just as good as I remember it. Will be bringing a lot back to IL when I travel to Asheville over Memorial Day."
"Would be willing to try again, but many beers of this style I would rather spend my money on."
"Overall the hops are in the forefront here and I'm digging it. Nothing here is a surprise, pretty much text book for the name and a solid beer overall."
"Very nice and calm for 9%"
"O--This was a really good DIPA, but it was almost a little bit too intense for me. My taste buds adjusted near the end of the drink, but by then it was almost too little too late. Would love to try this one in a food pairing with a sharp cheddar. Perhaps the creaminess of the cheese would cut down the acidity in the beer and mellow it out a bit."
"O - A really good DIPA, quite fruity and satisfying but still with a citric hop character. Potentially dangerous at 9%!"
"Dark ruby toned body with decent head retention and lacing. Smells pretty intense with alot of piney hops and caramel malts. Palate is tasty and very balanced but a bit rough around the edges. Piney and earthy with some boozy undertones. Viscous mouthfeel with moderate body. This is a good DIPA but, assuming this bottle is fresh, I feel it's a bit overhyped. That said, this is one that I hope to revisit."
"O - yeah, this is really good. not quite what I want from a DIPA, not enough hops on the tongue, but it's still good."
"All in all, very tasty stuff and well made. Of course, the ABV is somewhat preventative towards having very many, but at least they did a great job masking it. Some may say it borders on barleywine, but I think it definitely has sufficient hop character not to be."
"O: a good representation of the style, a bit too deep and malty for my tastes but still, I feel it is a good brew"
"O: It's okay - I paid $4 for a 12 oz pour at Tipples in Gainesville. I would never buy it again, but it's drinkable. It's not very complex (one hop, of course) and I'm totally unimpressed."
"O- A very good IIPA. Just a touch drier would put this in the top couple for me."
"O: This has been quite a great brew. Huge classic Simcoe elements and bitterness that is unsurpassed. Very well enjoyed and another huge thanks for this one. I know now which hop will be used in my home-brewed One Hop Wonder series."
"This is incredibly flavorful beer. It is overpowering and perhaps everything an American IPA should be. In your face hop forward and rude as hell about it! I'm a fan and wish this were available in my area."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty, cloudy orange/caramel color with a 1/2 inch head, good lacing throughout. Smell is of hops, a slight hint of citrus. Taste is very hoppy, considerable bitterness, not much else going on. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
"O: This is a damn fine IPA. This is 3/3 for weyerbacher, I'm excited to pick up some of the others I left behind at the store before."
"Apparently, I wrote this when it was too cold. As the beer warmed it improved."
"Cheers"
"Syrupy or resin finish on it really makes the bite turn into a throat scratching experience."
"Overall, tasty beer rating that I would buy again if DS was local. But with so many great DIPAs in southern cal, wouldn't take the trouble to trade for it."
"Overall: I'd say I enjoyed this one overall. The metallic issue that I mentioned was not strong enough to ruin the beer completely, but kept it from being a 4+ in my mind. I'd give this one a second chance, though, and hope to try it fresh on draught sometime."
"Thanks BigBlueBeerGuy!"
"The full-bodied mouthfeel is incredible. Absolutely leans toward the creamy end of the style (and of beer in general). Overall, this is certainly a worthy beer, but I'm not a huge fan. Due to the sweetness, it almost drinks like a low-alcohol American B-Wine, which in itself is not a problem. I was really let down by the taste. Granted this is a single-hop DIPA, but the hop character just seems a little lacking. It's a fine beer, but the only things that really stand out to me here are the creamy mouthfeel and caramelly sweetness that are both interesting features for the style."
"Overall, this is an amazing IPA, and for all of the bitterness that is surely present in here (in terms of IBUs, that is), the beer itself is quite drinkable, and immensely flavorful. Yes, the hops still bite at the tongue and leave the soft palate buzzing, but they don't rip and tear, as can happen with other beers of this style. Very much recommended."
"o-great beer. this is the strongest abv ipa i have had and the alcohol was not overpowering at all. very bold flavors along with such a complex flavor profile make this a great beer for multiple occasions."
"I did think this was quite a good DIPA, but it's very different in it's huge malt character that perhaps doesn't blend as well as it could with the hops. I'm not sure how fresh this bottle was so that could definitely contribute to the unbalanced nature but all in all, still a very nice sipper."
"A godly ale. Simcoe has just become my favourite hop. I was just getting bored of American hops (c hops). What a perfect remedy!!!"
"O- A great IPA, especially if you love simcoes. Great representation of the style, and overall a balanced beer. Another great brew from Weyerbacher."
"O: Man, this is a good beer and damn near a 4.5...not sure what it is that's holding me back. Incredibly drinkable given the 9.0%abv..it doesn't show itself in smell or taste. Sean, thanks for the gift. Good stuff."
"a surprise of a broad little beer with a nose of something a bit more woody than expected. nice palate of a bark bitter earth quality... brisk with a sustaining pine note. a bit of sweetness but the alcohol seem to have a ester quality that doesn't bond with the bittering and malt backing. for me a bit inconsistent on this level alone... but for a single hop... not bad. with a try."
"O- Is this the best dIPA that I've ever had? No. Is it an awesome dIPA that I wish we could see in the local Nashville market? Hell yeah. This is a highly enjoyable beer."
"Overall – The alcohol is very well hidden on this one, and the taste is well balanced. I was a little disappointed with lack of hops, (I expected more) but I'm not exactly sure how fresh my bottle was. Regardless, it's still one of the better DIPA's Ive had."
"O: Eh, just can't get into this beer having tried it twice. I like Ruination, but for some reason Double Simcoe is just too bitter/resiny for me."
"Future outlook: I'm a huge fan of the unfiltered, and also a fan of this now...though I do feel it falls slightly short of it's less refined twin...but that still leaves it as one hell of a good DIPA, and one I'll be happy to have again...and again..."
"Outstanding. Very well-balanced, plenty of distinctive flavors to eschew here. Happy Fourth of July, fellow Americans!!!"
"O: the simcoe IPA should become its own style, I have had 4 in as many weeks. Its hard to rank them because they are all so good. I would readily drink this again but not before a flying dog came available again."
"This is an exceptional beer. I liked weyerbacher's beers before this, but this has to be by far the best they have made. From the pour on it looks awesome. It is a solid amber with a large fluffy whit head which displays incredible lacing. The smell is foward of fruity, floral hops which i think the simcoe hop gives a little extra diversity. It is balanced perfectly by the malts. You can just tell this is going to be a good one. The taste is wonderful. There is an explosion of flavor on the tip of the tongue. Hops, citrus fruits, maybe even alittle bit of young apple and pear. Then comes the hops. While they are strong they are not over the top like some other ipa's ive had. They give a quick hit, then let the rest of the flavors come, then linger. It just has something extra in it i loved. This beer coats your mouth to great extent, there is not a taste bud in your mouth that isn't going crazy. Drinkablity is very high on this beer. There is no alcohol taste so beware and it is very smooth for something as hoppy as it is. Loved it."
"This beer pours a hazy copper color with a fluffy off white head. the simcoe hops are evident in both the smell and the taste. this beer is bitter with a slightly sweet malt backbone, Like a lot of DIPAs above 9%. the mouthfeel is light to medium body, with lower than expected carbonation. overall a really good beer."
"Overall, what we found to be the best thing about this brew was the blend within the aroma, and the soft, yet crisp, mouthfeel. The nose remained wonderfully true to the name with bright simcoe hops screaming at the top of their lungs, giving a nice hop to balance with some malt and musk. Upon sipping, what was more striking than the taste was, in fact, the mouthfeel. The head has huge retention, and contributes nicely to the froth and slurp of each sip, adding yet another thing to put this one over the top."
"Excellent pine aroma. Thicker body than I'm used to and I'm starting to understand the bit of oily taste that I've read about in other reviews. Everything about this beer made me enjoy it. I highly recommend. When finished the four of us were mad I didn't have the opportunity to pick up a second bottle. If you like a strong hop flavor grab this if you see it."
"O - Really a lot I like about it. Its one of those thats just off being super. Very nice DIPA for sure. I had this about 4 years ago once and its a nice revisit for me. Love it"
"Overall, I am impressed by this beer. From what I know, single-hop beers aren't all that common, so I appreciate Weyerbacher making one this tasty!"
"This beer is an obvious IPA, from the nose to the flavors on your tongue. But with an extremely high ABV (high, relatively speaking) someone that likes an IPA, like myself, could get into a LOT of trouble with a beer like this. It’s incredible in every sense of the word. From the smell to the taste, I LOVE this beer."
"1pt 9.4oz bottle. poured cloudy orange with huge white head. in fact I overflowed the glass, which surprised me since I have poured many many beer. Smells crazy strong with hops. some citrus notes in there too. The head holds on for a very long time, quite impressive. Very sweet and hoppy. Definite unfiltered taste. I pick up some orange peel in the background. this is a very good IPA, of which I am a huge fan."
"Overall an ok brew but not an IPA IMO. Like a cross between a hoppy barleywine and a dubble."
"It fills my perfect pout glass with a brew that's a slightly cloudy dark tan with orange on the edges. The foam starts about two fingers thick and leaves some incredibly thick lacing that almost coats the glass. The aroma has a distinctive hop presence indicative of Simcoe with some added citrus. The taste is similar with more hop presence and lemon and a touch of honey making for a sweet DIPA. It is less tart than I expected leaving a tingling on the center of the tongue. I really like this one, but for the price I'd take Hopslam over it."
"Overall I like this beer as a change of pace from the normal Cascade profile I I usually enjoy."
"Well, this sucker pours a deep reddish chestnut brown with orange and red highlights, with plenty of carbonation to give it a fist full of head that settles down to about a 1 finger thick gooey/slimy mess...mmm. Deep rich malts with sweet spicy hop flavor, and a bunch of alcohol swirling around. Rich biscuity caramel malts, big sticky hop bitterness. Awesome for a DIPA on the feel, smooth, high carb, medium body, aspriny finish for an extra bitter. Is this my bitter beer face?? you betcha. Overall this was very good, the simcoe didnt come out as much as i hoped it would. But then again my bottle had no date on it... wtf! But nevertheless still a great offering and enjoyable."
"O: This is a great beer, but not for summer because of the mouthfeel. I would consider this a shoulder season IIPA. So far, one of my favority from Weyebacher."
"D - I would choose something else first."
"O: Pretty good, not super hoppy, but has a nice combination of citrus/fruit and pine as well as a heavy malt backbone. Solid for sure."
"Fantastic stuff...but I think I had an even better experience with the corked bottle. Granted I got it brand spankin' new off the shelf, but that corked bottle was magic."
"O: It's a good DIPA. Good flavor and aroma."
"This was a decent beer. it did not seem as heavy as most imperials and not as bitter as most IPA's seem. It had a nice thick head that lingered, It was also a nice amber color. I have yet to find a beer that weyerbacher makes that I am crazy about; luckly they have a large selection of beer."
"Overall, a very nice DIPA. No overwhelming flavors, the flavor profile comes together pretty well."
"O yes, yes, yes, a very good beer 4.5. "
"The mouthfeel is full with adequate carbonation and a freshness that made it borderline sticky. It is nice to see a well balanced DIPA as opposed to the shredding west coast DIPAs that totally destroy your tastebuds. A new go to for me. Weyerbacher remains the top East Coast brewery for my money."
"Yup on tap she's a winner and could have any day."
"Received this one the other day in a box from ericwo. Thanks very much. Poured a slightly hazy dark orange color, with a decent sized, slightly off-white head. Aromas of lightly fruity hops and bubble gum. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of caramel malt and piney/citrusy hops."
"Very enjoyable brew. Glad I got to give this a shot and it's a very good example of an East Coast DIPA done West Coast style."
"O - I didn't want to like beer cause of the lame label and the fact that i cant normally obtain it, but i must say this is an excellent DIPA and more so an amazing beer on its own merit. I would stock my fridge with this all year round if possible."
" ~ This is a fine beer. I'm glad I kept is cellared and saved it for a time when it can really be enjoyed. If you have access to this beer I recommend you give it a sampling."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with almost no carbonation, a medium body and an overall sweet fruity taste. This was much sweeter than I expected and not as intense as I thought it would be, and overall it was decent but not great to me; it was off the mark somewhere."
"O - this is one solid DIPA. nothing here stands out as amazing but its all done very well."
"Thick, creamy beer with a big, fluffy head that retains nicely. Aromas of sweet citrus and pine. Tastes primarily piney as well, with caramel and fruit flavors. Very enjoyable to drink, great flavor and balance. They really seem to know what they're doing with hops over at Weyerbacher."
"--update-- I must have had an older batch that caused the review above. This current offering is amazing. All the piney, citrus and floral notes are up- front, but the beer retains it's malt stickiness... Excellent! Move over 90min!"
"O - Really enjoyed this beer. Well crafted with a good balance for such a powerful hop variety. Interesting hop flavor and a nice deviation from the citrusy west coast IPAs. Would definitely have again, although not more than a few at one sitting due to the alcohol."
"O: A very """informative""" beer (don't know if I'll ever describe another beer that way). This one is a touch sweet for its style even for an East Coast IIPA but very enjoyable nonetheless. Worth trying both because its a solid beer and because it showcases the contribution of Simcoe hops in both the nose and flavor."
"Definitely a beer that should be tried at least once. A tasty Imperial IPA but I've had better. Creamy - medium body with a decent ABV. at 9% makes this somewhat a sipper, not a session beer at all; one or two and you're done."
"O: Overall I am super impressed with this east coast DIPA. It is better than expected and I look forward to many more of these in the upcoming months. Well done extreme beer here!"
"On the whole, this is a pretty interesting beer. Looks funky, smells great, tastes... interesting to say the least. I'd definitely like to try a fresher bottle to compare. A very serviceable IPA from Weyerbacher."
"Overall a beer with potential. Might be better when extremely fresh"
"Poured this into a brand new tulip glass that I just bought. The beer pours a hazy amber color, with a slight head. The smell is very pleasant, with some fruit coming through with the hops. The taste follows pretty closely. It's sweet and hoppy at the same time. I do enjoy the mouthfeel - it's not too heavy, and has a nice, clean aftertaste. Not my favorite DIPA flavor, but very, very solid just the same. Even though nothing in particular wows me, this is a really enjoyable beer overall. I will buy another 4 pack of this the next time a fresh one is released."
"The mouthfeel is good, it's moderately carbonated and not too thick. The drinkability is superb, this glass didn't last too long in front of me. Surely, I can see this bottle's past it's prime. I don't quite understand why Weyerbacher's date code gives this another two months of shelf life, since I bought this from a store that's rather good about following date codes. I'm surely going to seek out a fresher bottle and update this review, because this is still quite delicious six months out, even if it's not as hoppy as I'd like."
"Pours a reddish amber, mild offwhite head with some decent lacing. Nose is huge, tons of hops, loads of orange, tangerine and peach with some mild malt balance. General sweetness overall. Taste is just as hop forward, more orange, tangerine and pine cones come through after the fact. Good malt balance here too, keeps the hops at bay to a degree, but tastes great. Some lingering bitterness but doesn't slaughter the palate. Medium low carbonation aids the drinkability. Great mouthfeel and a very attractive beer overall."
"D - Overall a very good beer. A little too sweet and heavy in body for me to consider it balanced, but the hops are amazingly smooth and soft-tasting, given the high hop bitterness."
"Overall: Not sure if the almost five month old bottling date (if I read the neck correctly) is part of the letdown, but I am not a huge fan of this DIPA. Also, this is my first experience with an DIPA brewed with a single hop strain - bottom line, I'll have to try more!"
"D- Overall i didn't really like this one too much. It was drinkable but just alittle off for me. I think after a few reviews im begining to see a trend. if the grapefruit profile is strong i tend to not like the beer as well. So give this beer a try . but for me i wont be picking this up again on purpose."
"O - Low drinkability from a persistent but mild alcohol warmth and taxing sweet malty profile. Overall, it's a pretty darn good beer, but it's certainly a beer better shared than experienced alone. Simcoe hops are nice - I love experiencing single-hop brews."
"Overall very good. Kind of underwhelmed til 5th sip, then it was extremely delicious. But then the hops began to fade slightly."
"O: While it does tend a bit toward the sweeter side, it still has a solid hop profile and nice bitterness."
"Drinks very well. A damn fine offering. The more weyerbacher beers I try, the more I like this brewery. So far the insanity is my fav, but I like them all!"
"The aroma is earthy and very hoppy in the sense of what this beer is.Tthe color is muddy golden looking. Not the most appealing color but once you taste it you'll see it's good. This beer goes through different stages it seems like at first it's hoppy and juicy, then it because more dry as you drink it. The flavor is unique amongst other IPA's. The head on the glass is great too, the lacing is very sticky. This is one of Weyerbacher's pride and joys. This one should be around for quite some time."
"OVERALL: I enjoyed this one much more than I’d expected to. A nice, creamy palate provided the base for a taste profile with two distinct acts. The nose could be a little bigger, which would add to the anticipation, but the taste profile made this an enjoyable, interesting DIPA. Definitely worth checking out if you get the chance. Thanks again guys!"
"O - A solid DIPA that stands on its own and flies under the radar."
"Overall Not mind blowing but on the same token not bad either.If you are into hop forward DIPA's I think you would enjoy this."
"D: If you are into hops (big time), then this is your brew. Nicely refreshing...even for a big beer. I will say that this beer is nicely balanced...not nearly as harsh as one might expect given the massive hops."
"D: Quite drinkable. The alcohol is well hidden. Sweet for the style, so perhaps not everybody's cup of tea, but I rather enjoyed it."
"Thanks to finewinemike for the chance to taste this one. I had actually had this one on tap while I was in DC last year, and remembered liking it. Poured into my DFH snifter, pours a very very dark amber color. Maybe the darkest (non black) IPA I have ever seen. Foam fills the glass, and recedes quickly, leaving a little lacing. Smell- butterscotch, some alcohol notes. Taste- bitter bitter butterscotch, followed by a bitter buttery finish. This is a bitter abusive IPA! The butterscotch flavor is overdone, and this lacks some complexity, but overall is an interesting spin on the style. I'm not sure that using Simcoe hops only was a good thing, but its interesting anyway. Mouthfeel- a teeny bit flat, a little bit syrupy. Drinkability- I overall like this beer, but dont know that I would really be able to have another one today!"
"This beer poured a apple cider like dirty amber with a light white foam that laced the glass. It smelled of simcoe hops (what else?) and a citrusy malty mix to give it a nice sweetness. The flavors are very well integrated. The simcoe hops and citrusy malt are near perfect together. This is also one of the smoothest DIPAs I've ever had. I definitely recommend it."
"-Cheers"
"O - Great beer, very enjoyable, especially fresh. Outrageously drinkable at 9% too. Not quite as hop forward as most DIPAs I have tried, definitely not as aggressive. Very pleasant and interesting take on a DIPA, will try again. Hopefully will get a chance to try the unfiltered version (I sent my only 750 of that out in a trade, but it's readily available here)."
"I think my rating gives this beer it's due. Sweet fruity flavors with a bitter finish, but not a whole lot beyond that. I'd go for it again if it was around, but nothing here get's me off. I would go for more pronounced hop character, not just hop bite, and the high abv. just seems to make that more difficult to achieve here."
"Overall, very good dipa, maybe on the sweet side for my taste but i like the big bready malt balance"
"Prost!!!"
"O-Not too bad. Definitely didn't blow me away. Not overly drinkable. Just an OK beer."
"Overall: I was a bit let down by this. I am a fan of most Wayerbachers and by no means was this not good, I was just expecting a bit more from it being a double. It is a good IPA and if youre just getting into doubles/imperials, this may be a good starting point."
"Overall I really enjoyed this. I have to thank sliverX for this. I just recently started posting reviews (don't know why I waited so long), but if I would have reviewed this a month or two ago it probably would have scored a bit higher. A must try!!"
"What a pleasure to try. Feels incredibly drinkable at a hefty 9.0 abv. Glad I have a bomber of this and I don't have to share. Search it out."
"The feel is a fair enough, good carbonation. Nice light body. This is a little sticky though. Overall I remember liking this one a lot more when I first got into beer drinking. I was hoping it would stand the test of time for me but not quite. In the end, not a terrible beer but I'll take other DIPAs over this."
"O - Overall this has made a very poor impression. This bottle must be extremely old. I'll be sure to try this fresh some time, but for now it's a massive let down. Nothing like what a DIPA should be. I've had a Simcoe single hop pale ale before and none of that flavor was present here."
"O- Nicely done, well balanced DIPA that tastes, feels and smells great."
"Had this at their Easton warehouse in 06 but didn't remeber it as good as the one tonight. Trust this one to deliver the goods hopheads."
"O: Adds the fruit of a Barleywine to a double IPA"
"I would have liked a bit more carbonation but this is nitpicking at this point. A very good Double IPA."
"I recommend a vigorous pour to acquire a lasting head. This brew has great sour bitterness and the right amount of malty sweet but could use a stronger finishing hop. The finish is leathery with a lingering sulfitic coat on the tounge. I prefer this beer in the bottle conditioned 22oz. I like their Blithering Idoiot the most, but this one was great as well."
"D: good, big IPA. hop centric, but plenty of sweetness there for a balance. however cant find anything that really sets this one apart."
"Overall a very good beer, whose sum is greater than its part. Surprisingly complex for a single hop beer."
"Pours dark for the style. Deep reddish/orange with a two-finger off-white head. Nice lacing throughout. Aroma of pine, grapefruit wood, a bit of English malt. Simcoe hops obviously stand out. Semi-bittering pine flavor to begin. A bit oily. Followed by nice, tart grapefruit flavors. Sweet, sticky English malts on the back half. Nice woodsy flavor to finish along with more of the semi-bittering pine. A bit of alcohol, but pleasant. I get the slightest hint of cherry brandy."
"Cheers!"
"D: There are really a lot of good DIPA's out there, but this one falls a bit short. I'm a big fan of Weyerbacher, usuaully...but this is missing some character. The bitters are complimented by the malts, but it has really only 1 major flavor, Simcoe."
"Great beer from Weyerbacher and I will certainly keep this in the rotation. Very different from your standard double ipa but very enjoyable."
"the CPJ"
"Great beer not the best DIPA perhaps not as complex being a single hop"
"OVERALL: Outstandingly easy to drink, however, this is said as a hop head. While something like a Hopslam might be a good introduction to the style, the Double Simcoe is for the seasoned vets."
"Pours an attractive burnt orange color with fantastic soapy off-white head that lingers a while and leaves good lacing. First whiff is a big bold punch of citrus backed by a resinus pine and grassy quality, backbone contains a hint of sweet malt. Taste is much more piney and bitter than expected, the citrus notes are few and far between and lean more towards grapefruit, the malt is present but is pale and biscuity as opposed to carmely. Medum bodied, good levels of carbonation and feels dry on the tongue yet lingers. An attractive pour and bold scent carried this beer, just a touch too piney and bitter for my tastes to be world class."
"D: The weak aroma and taste on this one hurt its appeal quite a bit; a bit of alcohol being detectable as it warmed didn't really help things either. Don't think I'll be picking this one up again, especially at its $3.50/12oz or $12/4pack price point, when there are much better DIPAs out there."
"D- Good single hop beer. No focus on malt whatsoever. Easily drinkable and incredibly smooth. I wasn't blown away by it, but it wasn't bad, and the focus on one hop can certainly explain the lack of complexity."
"Really good for a double IPA. Very easy to drink for it's abv and very low on the bitterness for how hoppy it apears."
"Drinkability: Good. Almost as good as fresh/bottle (but not quite!). This reminds me of other citrusy IPA/DIPA's I've had in cask like Hop Stoopid, but where those failed, Double Simcoe on cask works. Satisfying, not too sweet, not too juicy, not too boozy. Yes!"
"I will try this again to see if I have any changed feelings."
"Poured from bomber into dimpled mug. Pours a fairly hazy, deep amber body. Average sized, dense, creamy, ultra fine tan head. Aroma is like a handful of hops. Big Simcoe flavor - pine, citrus and some tropical fruit/mango. Zero malt aroma, but the hops are supposed the be the showcase here. Huge hop flavor. More pine and the aforementioned fruit - both come through in spades. Chewy caramel malt provides the requisite sweetness so that the hops can really shine through. Though the flavors are big, they don't shred aggressively like some DIPAs. Full bodied, average carbonation, lightly sticky palate. Fairly sweet up front, but it dries out considerably. Big bitter (though not harsh) hop finish."
"overall, this is a really nice beer"
"D - This one was one and done. I usually enjoy double simcoe but this one was just off. I am not sure if it was old or just off but it was not normal that is for sure."
"Pours a dark golden caramel color into a tulip glass. Off white/caramel head that sticks around for a bit w/ great lacing. The smell is great, very complex w/ malt and many citrus smells involved- pineapple, orange, etc... Very sweet smell, but the malt tempers that a bit. Very smooth smelling as well. The taste is out of this world. Big malt, big flavors, and a great aftertaste that lingers what seems like forever. This is impressive. Mouthfeel is chewy, smooth and delicious. I can't imagine this particular beer getting any better than it is. World Class all the way- Cheers!"
"D: A solid Imperial IPA that is strong but not obvisouly strong. Too bad they do not distribute to IL!"
"I thoroughly enjoy this beer. I recommend it to any and all HopHeads."
"D - I would consider getting it again if supplied at my local shop. Not sure of the age but I did get it in my mixed sixer for 10.99 and that's pretty good for such a hoppy brew. Still expected more hops truthfully. Nice!"
"D- Solid IPA and I will certainly return to this one if offered"
"One fantastic beer."
"For a pretty big ABV, this beer drinks pretty well, but the amount of spice that is present would not make me want to drink more than 1 in a night, or possibly ever again. "
"D: For 9% alcohol, this is very drinkable. Sometimes IIPA's can go a bit crazy on the bitterness (in my opinion at least) but this one is very nice and goes down very easy."
"I did enjoy this, but I think I was expecting something a bit more vibrant than what i got. Maybe an alcohol fueled hop bomb, but it wasn't quite there. Maybe lower expectations would have made me feel overwhelmed."
"D - much more balanced than other DIPAs I've had -- not what I'd go for when in a super-hoppy mood, but when I don't want the buds destroyed this is an excellent choice"
" The Imperial IPA on cask is substandard -moderate hoppiness up front which succumbs to a toasted malt and alcohol flavor w/ bitter boozy finish. A middle of the road Imperial IPA on cask it might be better in the bottle or on tap, but I haven't tried those formats in a while. I wasn't sure what to expect but I would say avoid this on cask based on this experience. The cask sacrifices hop juiciness for alcohol and astringency-difficult to enjoy more than half a glass of let alone 14 ounces."
"The fresh version is a go-to standard for an IPA/Double IPA from the east; I think it could stand up very well in that crowd. The aged version was a revelation, and makes me want to get serious about some cellar experiments--thanks again, Tom!"
"Simcoe is well balanced and refreshing."
"D: Definitly can drink a few and loved it with a baked salmon with sweet Thai chilli ansd lime, I truely believe it brin gs out the beast in this one,mmm."
"All around solid DIPA, but not my favorite. If you love simcoe hops, this is definitely a must try though."
"D: Goes down nice and easy, until you try to get up."
"D: This is a medium body brew that is worth giving a shot, for me personally, I really don't like it. Something with the malt character puts it out of that high class DIPA standing."
"not bad...."
"When i poured this beer, it has a dark murky orange color body with a nice 2""" white foamy head, which hangs around for a while. The aroma is of citrus and hops. The taste is of hops and has a nice bitter taste to it. It has a nice mouth feel and i think is very drinkable."
"Poured a murky burnt orange/light brown with a nice finger of head that was light goldenrod in hue, lacing and retaining well. Citrusy, with hints of orange peel and earthiness atop a very sweet malt backbone. Appropriate bitterness, not very complex due to the single hop variety, with bready malts and a hint of booze. Medium-heavy feel to it, decent carbonation, and a bittersweet warming finish. A very inviting beer, even if not the most complex of DIPA's, it is very satisfying and goes down smoothly."
"D-not a bad IPA for the long run but when there's such a vast selection of IPAs everywhere, this one just doesn't cut it"
"smooth, medium-bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation. goes down very easily. will have to revisit this one at some point and compare notes."
"D: Goes down alright, but not anything to write home about. Pretty strong."
"Very nice DIPA would love to try on draught someday."
"A big tasty double IPA - quite filling and not as complex or as hop-forward as some."
"D: A solid offering from Weyerbacher. Even though I drank before the freshness date, maybe a little fresher would be better. Would try it again."
"D-This is actually insanely drinkable, mostly due to dryhopping I think. This beer has a ton of hop flavor and aromatics without much bitterness."
"Weyerbacher Double Simcoe IPA can a deep, slightly cloudy orange amber colour and an impressive head (it was at least 3 cm when poured and never got smaller than 5mm). This beer smells of hops. The smell is a little sweeter than most most doubles I've had. It's very nice: sweet, orangey and maybe a little sour. This beer is hoppy and fruity. It has a lovely and intense tangy-orange flavour with some sourness. The aftertaste is slightly bitter. This beer is thick and foamy in the mouth. I really enjoyed it a lot. Delicious."
"Liked it, liked the unfiltered a bit more."
"This is a special beer, one that stands out amongst an array of brewers who simply want to barrage you with hops and call it a good beer. One thing I've noticed about hops is, well... they taste hoppy, as in the flavor tends to hop around different spots on the tongue. This was the first IPA I've enjoyed where my entire palate was full of taste and hop goodness. It was a little overwhelming upon the first sip, but midway through I had a great appreciation for it. The hop taste is mostly sweet potpourri on a just-beginning-to-stale white bread. Flows smooth at the roof of the mouth and leaves and little residual taste or feel on the back of the tongue - just a pinch of hop here and a pinch of bread there. I could enjoy two or three of these in one nite and enjoy myself. Definitely one of my favorite and for sure most memorable IPA."
"This is a rare Weyerbacher winner."
"Overall impression: Malty as hell, but that hop profile is pretty crazy."
"Overall I was slightly disappointed with this beer. First, I put the beer in the fridge to cool down for only about 20 minutes. I like my beer cool not cold so I dont let it get to a fridge temp. However when I opened this beer the bottle's cork top blew off and foam poared out of the beer for a minute or so. I've had that happen with homebrews and this is a bottle conditioned beer, but I wasnt expecting that. I also wasnt impressed with the aroma of the hops! I might not be a fan of simcoe hops, i dont know this is my first beer with them in it but I didnt like the overall aroma though the taste of the beer was still good for an ipa."
"D: Good drinkability and especially for a 9% but you'd be hard pressed to drink more than a 750ml in one sitting."
"This is my first Weyerbacher, certainly will be trying more from them."
"Wow, this is a malty DIPA. Too malty for it's own good if I do say so myself. There's some skunky, orange citrus floating in the thick, sweet, malty swamp which breaks it up a bit but I need more hops! That said, the malt character is wonderfully chewy and complex in it's own right, I'd just like some more hops with my hoppy beer please. Slightly remeniscient of peach schnapps."
"D - Overall this is a pretty good beer very easy drinking for the abv if you like hop bombs this is one that you'll want to get your hands on to try"
"M/D - kind of thick. i didn't love it. reminded me of a DFH 120 min lite. glad i picked up a single instead of a 6'er. i was surprised that this is so highly rated after tasting, but i guess for the hop-heads, here's a double."
"Great drinkability for a 9% ABV beer, perfect fix for any hop head."
"Notes. Had another bottle on 2011-04-01 that was fresher than the one above. This had more carbonation and the hop smells and taste were fresher but the rest of the malt- heavy tastes are the same. I'm leaving my review ratings as is."
"Drinkability: I liked the purity of the one hop taste originally, but it quickly became cloying. Simcoe is a hop better used as a complement to other varieties, in my opinion."
"D: A very solid brew. Not hoppy and bitter enough to blow you away, but well balanced and delicious. Maybe a nice halfway point between an IPA and a DIPA."
"Sampled a 12 oz bottle. Poured a hazy orange, with a dense tannish head that had a ton of stick. Smell was the embodiment of IPA, hoppy and more hoppy! Taste was superb - the equivalent of citrus I cannot compare to the Simcoe hops.. mostly like an orange, but smoother and mellower. The malt base is boldenough to balance out those hops. Finish was dramatic and dry, but not overwhelming. Drinkability was very high for such an alcoholic brew. Very good."
"Highly drinkable, as hop bitterness does not invite the palate fatique of most DIPAs. Very nice balance, which isn't too common in most such beers."
"Very drinkable and refreshing beer. Complex and playful. I would absolutely drink more."
"Drinkability is good on this one. Mine came in a four pack, which would be quite an adventure in one night considering the ABV. Still, I could come back to this often, in many different situations. Good all-around brew."
"d- its definitely a good beer but i could see where this wouldnt be a good beer for people new to ipas, very enjoyable but im not so sure its worth its pricetag"
"D - My first beer from this company and for a DIPA it's a little on the soft side. Not a bad brew, but I really like big and bold, while I appreciate the balance of this one it was not that exciting."
"Bouttle poured into leffe glass. Hazy orange amber color with a small creamy cap that fades quickly. Smell is heavy on the sweet malts, followed by tropical fruit hops. Lots of mango. Taste is bright and fruity hops, slightly savory and bitter. Malt sweetness is more balanced in the taste then it was in the smell. Heavy body and medium carbonation. Drinkability is average despite the strong flavors and high abv. A very good example of a midwest/east coast DIPA."
"Drinkabilty - Its ok. Not what i was hoping for. I can say this beer would be interesting to drink fresh from the barrel. Maybe this was a little aged cause it was rather mild in flavor. Of course i think that about most weyerbacher beers. I want to try the unfiltered to see if its better, theres alot better ipa's, single or double out there. Ill review this one again if i ever get a real fresh one."
"Pours a nice amber-copper color with a pretty solid off white head. The nose brings forward a large amount of citrus rind as well as some resinous pine. There is a slight amount of caramel malt in the background. The taste is quite bitter with some nice citrus and pine notes. Grapefruit and orange seem to be the most dominant. Mouthfeel is dry with a bit of booze. Overall, this drinks fairly well, but there's something that doesn't come all the way together for me in the end."
"Had this beer at Lord Hobo in Cambridge, MA. Beautiful orange color with a creamy head and fantastic lasting up and down the glass. The aroma of this beer is amazing. Beautiful, complex hop aroma. Nice grapefruity hops flavor are present in the taste of the beer and alcohol is masked well. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy and this beer is a very drinkable DIPA. So hard to believe they can get such a complex hop flavor with just simcoe. Loved this beer. I wonder if it is as good in the bottle?"
"D: The strong malt character makes this taste more like a hoppy barleywine. It's a fine brew nonetheless."
"If you dig IPAs--buy this one!"
"D- I could sit and sniff this beer all day long thats for sure. But it is very good, probably the fruitiest tasting DIPA I've had. I think my hops mellowed out in this bottle however,*sigh* but I'll deffinitely drink this in the future. Just wont let it sit as long next time. A great offering from Weyerbacher though, glad to live within an hour of this brewery."
"Fairly drinkable. It's a one of those DIPAs that is on the maltier side which is fine if you are in the mood for one."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky. Medium bodied, mild carbonation."
"12oz bottle. Pours a murky brown with a large head.Tons of lacing. Smell is very sweet and floral. Very floral. Maybe some hints of citrus in there somewhere. Taste is sweet with some bitterness. Floral but not really any citrus flavor to it. Not the normal Imperial IPA that I like to drink but still pretty good. Pretty easy to drink but I'm not too sure what to think about this beer. I like it but it wasn't what I was expecting. Good change of pace IPA for when you are tired of citrus. Fortunately, I am not sick of those IPAs."
"The beer is not overly bitter, it is complex but well balanced and subtle, not overly aggressive hops."
"D: A sipping beer. Always try to have double IPAs whenever I see them. This one was definitely better than average, but wouldn't be one of my favorites (those would probably have to come from Russian River)."
"drinks rather well. not a complete """hop bomb""" but the hops are there. I think they have faded just a bit over a little time. From my recollection, I enjoyed the unfiltered a bit more, but this is a very good beer."
"Flavor is lightly bitter and somewhat chalky and dry of bitterness. Nicely balanced in flavor overall with a hint of so many things. Subtle and discreet, yet enjoyable nonetheless. Becomes a bit orange rancid in malt flavor by the finish as the bitterness dissipates. Somewhat lacking in bitterness overall, and with a notable syrup viscosity in flavor."
"Not the most drinkable double IPA, but quite tasty. I tried this back when I was just getting into craft beer hardcore and I remember thinking it was a bit too much at the time. I am definitely glad I came back to revisit this one. Recommended."
"D: If you're in the mood for hops, this one is a great single hop IPA"
"D: I only bought one, wish I bought more. So good. Definately will be drinking this again in the future."
"Drinkability: this is a very drinkable DIPA. I feel like its good balance makes this something I could have a few of, despite the high ABV. I'd definitely look for this again."
"Not at all a good example of a DIPA in my opinion. I didn't think there could be such a muddled hop flavor in a single-hop beer. Alcohol was way too forward. I'd take a sip of this again if someone else was drinking it to see if I got a stale bottle, but wouldn't spend my money on it or recommend anyone to buy it."
"Notes: Still quite remarkable on tap. Worth the selection although I guess that I may lean towards the unfiltered bottled version..."
"beer is medium bodied and quite bitter. it leads off with a lot of malt though. its kind of a tie in here between the malt and the hops. drinkability good, mouthfeel fine. its ok."
"Picked up the corked, bottle fermented version at CBX about a week and a half back... popped it open tonight. Pours a murky, deep copper amber, with an off white head that is huge and shows some considerable, chunky lace that sticks and globs all over my trusty Piraat tulip glass. Aroma... first thing I notice, surprisingly, is cararmel malt?!? Piney and citrus notes dominate the hop profile. There's also some sweet yeast in there, along with what I'd characterize as a homebrewed hop sediment aroma. Like the smell, there's quite a bit of caramel malt in the taste... followed by dank hops: herby and heavy grapefruit rind. A touch of booze peeks through, along with some molasses and maybe a touch of all-spice in the finish... interesting. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and somewhat creamy, yet a touch prickly and with sticky, sweet malts. Its pretty heavy duty stuff, but very enjoyable. One of the more complex double IPA's I've had -"
"There was minimal carbonation on this beer and the overall mouthfeel was somewhere between silky and oily. It did emphasize the power of the hops, but I actually would have preferred a delicate rumble of carbonation to scrub my palate. The finish was lightly dry but sweet, with a medium short end. We both enjoyed this beer a lot, but it does not go in the top Double IPAs for me. Although many would scoff at the idea of an IPA with desert, but this baby was built for rich chocolate, I guarantee it!"
"I actually agree with most of my initial review. The textbook Simcoe aroma and flavor is excellently highlighted. Deep, oily pine and aromatic candied citrus. The flavor is slightly more vegetal. The nearly tart grapefruit and biting pine is quite delicious."
"D-Drinkability is a difficult attribute for this brew. It's a pretty aggressive DIPA, with the bitterness to go with it. However, I still feel that a great DIPA should be a bit easier-going. For that, I'm going to knock this one a bit."
"D- its a sipper, because the simcoe can be a little much. Still very, very good though."
"M/D: Medium body, carbonation is a little on the high and active side considering the higher abv. Nice smoothness and creaminess. Drinks lower than its abv. This stuff is pretty intense, a palate destroyer, but its got a good drinkability considering."
"Would drink more of this, but not necessarily seeking it out."
"Carbonation is still up halfway down, a decent price on these $10 a 4 pack. Not going to knock the socks off anyone looking for a dipa simcoe west coast style beer. Enjoyable nonetheless, just was different than advertised."
"O: Would like to try this either fresher or on tap but still very glad to get to try this and it has me even more excited to use simcoe for the first time in a homebrew. Weyerbacher is good stuff and I cAn't wait to try more."
"Hazy copper-orange pour with huge creamy head and great lacing. Lots of earthy, pine in the nose with a nice malty backbone. The taste is much the same but with a kind of mediciney after taste. The Simcoe hops are the stars here with a nice bitter bite and a decent balance with some caramel malt to offset. I think this one was a bit too cold when I poured it as it got a lot more complex and balanced as it warmed up. Nice dry crisp finish made it pretty drinkable. The alcohol was nicely hidden and barely noticeable for a 9% beer. Not a great beer, but pretty decent."
"Deep copper color with an amber hue. Very hazy. Light yellowish head that disappears quickly, but leaves a steady cap. Wet lacings that don't stick around. Soft hoppy floral aroma. Refreshing, lively carbonation. Quick malt character in the beginning followed by intense, long lasting hop flavor. Finishes with a bit of pine character. Alcohol is sensed at the finish leaving a medicinal edge to the aftertaste."
"Overall: An excellent IPA. I'm very happy that I picked this one up when buying a twelve pack of singles. I will be buying this one again."
"D: I enjoy this but I have had better. At 9% it can drag on you but this isn't meant to be a short term drink. Make it last and enjoy it. I've had better but this is still good."
"D-Watch out with an abv of 9%. Has high drinkability though and it would be really easy to spend an afternoon throwing back a few of these."
"Unfortunately, I don't have any leftover steak, or I'd be in my beer 'sweet spot' right about now."
"Drinkability:This beer is a great DIPA, with unique complex flavors that I have not experienced in other DIPAs. It is a fantastic example of this style."
"Tasty. Simcoe is an easy-drinking hop as it doesn't bring too much herbal-peppery-bitterness. Citrus zest and tropical fruits bring the major flavor notes. The pale malt is sweet and matches the hops note for note. The booze is noticeable here on the draft version. Big mouthfeel is quite sticky and chewy. Everything about this beer is big and bad, and I love it."
"Fairly full mouthfeel. More full than is my preference. I thought this DIPA was fine, but definitely not my favorite DIPA."
"D-well balanced and huge, tons of malts but the showcase is the simcoe hop. Quite drinkable as the bitterness is moderate and pleasant."
"D - Very tasty, but a lot of these flavors are so bold as to make this a slow sipper, and one at that. Average drinkability for the style, I would say."
"I found some notes of this fine beer I had on-tap at UPick6 in Erie PA. I thought I gave my Ratings of a few Weyerbacher's, but I guess I got too drunk to Rate, I can read my notes still. Poured a Beautiful hazy Orange, with a light bubbly head. First sniff was awakening. Ahhh, this is Simcoe Hops. Combo punch of Pine and Grapefruit. First taste, just as it smelled, with a faint sweetness for balance. As it warmed, so did the Alcohol. Not overbearing, just letting you know it was part of this fine brew. I remember saying """Oh my God""" several times as I sipped, while eating smoked turkey Sandwich with Russ's Famous Potato Salad. I need to get a couple of bombers, and let them rest for a while."
"Bottle pours a dark brown amber colour using the Sam Adams perfect pint glass. The taste is quite malty with a very very bitter grapefruit hoppy finish. Honestly, its ok, not bad, but not great. Its incredible drinkable though for the 9%. No hint of the alcohol at all. Just wish the flavour packed a bit better of a punch."
"Medium bodied, decent carbonation. Somewhat oily. Might be the best part of the beer so far. the overall drinkability of this beer is decent, but I may need to try this again and edit the review. I think this may be an old bottle. I have heard and read for a long time that the aroma and flavor are bold, and this isn't."
"This beer pours clear deep copper/light amber color with an off-white head. The aroma is highly hoppy-citrus lemon and grapefruit with some pine and a bit of fresh floral grass. There is a hint of sweet malt in the background. The flavor is upfront an explosion of hop flavor--grapefruity and piney with a solid hop bitterness. Beneath all the hops is a sweet, bready malt flavor. The beer finishes slightly dry with an ever-lasting hop flavor. The body is medium-full and carbonation moderate. The ABV is apparent only in a slightly oily mouthfeel and a glowing warm belly. Overall a deliciously hoppy beer -- hops all over the place with just a hint of sweet, bready malt."
"An excellent DIPA. One of the best I've had. Will definately purchase again."
"Taste is sweet, bitter, harsh and full of citrus notes. It's got a fairly harsh finish but it's nice and bitter. It's fairly drinkable but the alcohol level is certainly noticeable."
"Overall, a decent brew, but nothing extraordinary. I had higher expectations for this one. Another Weyerbacher sipper for me."
"D - not a bad DIPA...some will love it, others not. much bigger fan of the unfiltered version as that adds another dimension to an otherwise one-sided beer."
"D: Once again, Weyerbacher proves that you can not judge a book by it's cover or, a beer by it's label. It's a good thing too because they consistently have terrible label designs, but they consistently brew FANTASTIC beer as well. And the Double Simcoe is one of their best. Excellent drinkability."
"I think this is the best DIPA I've had. The bitterness is never excessive yet evident in full degree and the complexity of the hop and the malt makes it stand above the rest. There is balance in the flavors and the appearance is second to none. The alcohol is mild in evidence considering the strength. Nicely done. My compliments to the brewers."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side for a DIPA, and the carbonation is moderate. It had a bit of a creamy mouthfeel to it as well. Drinkability is pretty good, it showcased the Simcoe hops pretty well and at the same time had some very nice caramel and malt flavors."
"Drinkability: Overall, a solid DIPA that is a nice sipper. Nothing out of the ordinary here and the overly mild aroma is a deterrent."
"D - No sign of the alcohol content, but otherwise I'm not especially impressed. Not nearly as hoppy and bitter as promised."
"D - A very good DIPA. Not one that I would actively seek out, but one that I would buy again, especially if I came across it on tap."
"D - Not too bad, got easier as I went. The alcohol kept this one down just a touch though."
"F: Finishes pretty bitter, but not overwhelming. It actually gets more and more bitter as it goes, both from the hops adding and from the long bitter finish. It gets pretty dry on the finish which accentuates the bitterness as well. Some spicy and piny hops, a little fruity hop flavor, and more of that fluffy nougat like hop flavor too. Pretty spicy on the long finish as well, partly from the hops and bitterness, partly from the dryness, and somewhat from the booze."
"D- I really enjoyed this DIPA. I couldve polished this bottle off with great ease."
"At 9% ABV, this is one dangerous beer. It drinks as a single IPA and one could easily lose track of their empties. Unless you really don't like hops, this one goes down real nice and could leave you in bad shape the next day. High alcohol, but drinkable + a ton of hops = one nasty hangover!"
"I have had several Weyerbacher offerings in the past. They were of high quality. But this is the best of all their offerings. Great job."
"Once I saw the color, I though """Here we go again, another sickeningly sweet DIPA.""" Fortunately, the color is a little deceiving, as this is a very nicely balanced beer, and surprisingly complex for only having one type of hop. I've used Simcoe in homebrewing, but only as a bittering addition. Maybe I need to spread it out some..."
"Dark brown body, medium sized cream colored head. Sweet malt and piney tar make up the nose. Taste is dominated by the icky stickies. Sweet malt from gets knocked to the ground by a lot of stick-to-the-roof piney hops. A fair amount of spice from the alcohol. Medium bodied. This is one of those no-shit IPAs"
"Drinkability is decent, not a great double IPA, pretty mediocre, unless of course you love eating pine cones."
"Overall very good, and one which iI will definitiely enjoy again another evening. However, this is one that you;ll only have onvce in an evening, given its strength and strong hop boter aftertaste."
"Cloudy golden-orange in color. Fresh, hoppy aroma - citrus and grapefruit. Upon first sip...wow getting a totally different hop flavor than I expected. Weird & funky. Like the smell of a rainy street, and dare I say, a bit of Mary J earthiness. This must be the Simcoe hop profile. Interesting and unexpected, with medium drinkability."
"Drinkability is very good. Alcohol is well-concealed. Tasty double IPA."
"D: Quite palatable, very drinkable and packed with flavor. Very well made beer focusing on the Simcoe hop."
"Hail to the Simcoe Hop and to Weyerbacher for this delicious cloudy dark amber/orange beauty. It leaves a nice film head throughout and an impressive lacing. What a wonderful bitter citrus taste and clean finish that doesn't paralyze the palate before the next sip. Available year round? Wow! Hop heads rejoice!"
"This is an awesome beer! I will definetly hope to have this one again some time."
"Served from tap into a standard pint. Poured a nice copper with a one finger white head. The aroma was comprised of malt with a small amount of mild hops. The flavor was quite interesting with slight caramel and sweet hop flavor. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. It held very nice lacing throughout. Overall, this was very smooth for a double IPA. This brew was very drinkable for a higher ABV IPA. This one had quite a different flavor to it as compared to other double IPAs I have tried."
"D: There's no way you could drink more than one of these in a single sitting but it is a good sipper."
"Overall a nice beer with a good balance!"
"D) Delicious. I have had quite a few of these and finally posting a review."
"pours a cloudy copper color with spare off whit head and fair lacing and average carbonation. a light malty taste which was also very heavy in hops. a bit perfume and piney like hop flavor. alcohol taste was of average. medium body that finished slightly bitter. very good beer but i must say i was WAY MORE impressed with the unfiltered version of this beer."
"D - I will drink this on-tap anytime I see it. Great stuff. Highly recommended."
"The Double Simcoe pours a golden orange color with a huge off white head that very slowly dwindles. The entire snifter is lined with lacing. Aroma is of yeast and hops. Some malt characteristics are notices. No fruit which is atypical for this style. Much more of the hop characteristics come through with the taste. A very well balanced brew with some caramel sweetness contrasting the bitter hops. This is a very smooth drinking DIPA. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and medium bodied. Drinkability is above average. The alcohol is well hidden with the great taste. Well done Weyerbacher. Looking forward to trying other brews and thanks again for allowing me to try this Arenbeer/MuttyD!"
"Served in a pint glass, it appears a hazy amber color with a yellow stained head that is very creamy and retains quite well. Lacing is a solid curtain all around the glass. Aroma is a piney, citrus monster that is showcasing the simcoe hops. Taste is of course a monsterous amount of bitterness upfront that eases into some of the hop flavors such as citrus, pine and a bit of a fruity/floral aspect as well. There is a minimal amount of malt sweetness that provides some support throughout this medium to heavy bodied beer. The alcohol is evident in flavor and is accented by a mild amount of carbonation. Finish is somewhat oil-like with the hop bitterness lingering in the mouth long after a sip is taken. A little more malt character would have gone a long way here but it is just a shadow in this beer."
"Nice IPA. Bold and fun to drink."
"with it. No alcohol presance at all. A nicely done DIPA."
"Pours copper/orange with a small off white head. Smells like (simcoe) hops and actually with a lot of a burnt brown sugar malty backbone. I would describe the taste the exact same way. The hops are in the forefront but there is a surprisingly strong caramel malt backbone. Blindfolded I would probably call this a fresh barleywine instead of a DIPA. Maybe I'm splitting hairs a little bit. Anyways the taste doesn't quite work for me, if it were a fresh barleywine I would say it needs to be aged for a while to cool off a bit. Borders on boozy at times. Mouthfeel is sticky and medium bodied, warming. Drinkability is ok, but I would move on to something else after one of these."
"Had this at Eulogy bar in Philly. Poured a dark reddish brown into a tulip with a serious cream colored foam head. Smell was sweet and bready malts, then oily hops. Taste was similar, sweet up front then very bitter in the finish. Very complex, very good IPA, definitely worth trying."
"Cheers!"
"A: The color of burnt caramel, thick creamy head, lots of active carbonation visible in the beer, tons of sticky lacing rings down the side of the glass - 4.25, S: Strong earthy aromas, slightly floral, hint of wood on the nose, subtle honeysuckle-like sweetness - 4.25, T: Nice medium hop bite, grapefruit and pine both come through on the palate, very delicate honey and caramel sugariness, ever so faint oak to the flavor, noticeable alcohol, ground dates, I'll grant Double Simcoe the IPA status but struggle to see it climbing into the ranks as a double IPA - 4.00, M: Slightly syrupy and sticky - 4.00, A solid beer all around, always fun to have a beer that showcases a single hop, one I have that repeatedly enjoyed and that I will continue to enjoy - 4.50"
"D: I'd happily drink this again, though I prefer a hoppier DIPA, with more hop diversity and a smaller malt bill."
"This is fun to drink, but a palate crusher. Only a couple could be consumed in one sitting without causing considerable palate damage."
" After two fresh drafts I could not help myself from filling growler conveniently empty and clean in my car. Thick off white head dissipates quickly and coats the glass I wouldnt even call this lacing more like a coat of mortar. A hazy red ale with highlights of orange is putting out some sweet aromas of grapefruit cat piss booze and pine. I know how wonderful it smells and the taste matches to boot. 9% ABV hides behind the bitterness of the Simcoe hops. The hops are held up from stealing the entire show with the alcohol and sweet grain taste. This is a hop bomb and a DIPA but, not one aspect makes this ale it is the balance of the whole enchilada."
"Mouthfeel: The carbonation level is just right. Crisp and clean. Very drinkable."
"d- i've been really looking forward to trying this beer for a long while, i was sad to find that it really didn't stand up to my expectations, it was tasty - just didn't stand out as spectactular or anything like that."
"Not a favorite of mine in this category. Too many dark fruity flavors in this. It's like a Belgian dubel."
"D: Highly drinkinkable, I really enjoy beers that are hoppy and strong so I could drink of few of these. The $$$ would be whats limiting."
"I thought you were thin and wafery like Donna Hayward. A little floral, the type of girl who doesn't like to get thrown around or throw me around. But no, you pack a punch. You at first disappoint me, but when I get to the bottom of the bottle I am...aroused. Perhaps I will see you at One Eyed Jack's. Until then..."
"D= Not that great. Taste and smell aren't very good. Not a great beer and I'm not sure why it recieves so much praise."
"Very drinkable for the ABV, but it is a bit sweeter than I thought it would be."
"D: A real hop treasure. Could probably sip through a few of these on a weekend. Second time I've bought some of these and will be looking for more anytime I can get my hands on it."
"D - Another great year-round beer from Weyerbacher. While not a daily drinker based on the 9% abv this beer stands out as a solid weekend session beer. Complex, yet simple at the same time Double SImcoe will be sure to leave an impression on your DIPA taste buds. I will certainly be seeking this beer out again."
"12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours a beautiful dark caramel color, almost like a black and tan. It has a nice even head and thick lacing. It has a nice pine scent to it, just a hint of bitterness in the smell. This is a great IPA. The bitter hop up front is balanced with just a hint of sweet malt on the back end. You can feel the alcohol kick on this which lowers the drinkability a little bit. Recommended!"
"D- I really enjoyed this beer. Its something different, and something I'm sure I'll come back to in the future. Highly drinkable besides the high ABV"
"M: Mouthfeel is medium, balanced between the creamy malt and sharper hops."
"Personally I like the taste of the simcoe hops so I enjoy this beer, but it is a bit rough around the edges. I think this beer is nice one to drink once in a while, but I think the key is drinking it fresh and enjoying the contrast of the simcoe with a regular type hopped IPA."
"The beer pours orange copper with an off-white head. The aroma is resiny hops with some pine and grapefruit. The flavor is very hoppy, with resin, orange and grapefruit notes as well as a nice light malt backbone. Medium carbonation and mouthfeel."
"D-definatelty a sipper due to the hop bitterness and the high abv"
"Good pour from this attractive bottle yields a nice amber-copper colored ale with a decent head. Nose has a big leafy, herbal, and maybe outright vegetable like aroma from the hops. Similar garden flavors are noted on the palate from the hop influence, with not quite enough malt to round it out. Even though out of balance it's still fine with me, as a yummy double india pale ale."
"This is a really bitter IPA that showcases the single hop variety it's brewed with: Simcoe. A dark hop flavor prevails, with predominately raw, piney notes. A woody spiciness comes through, finishing very bitter, borderline harsh. Great mouthfeel and decent fullness from the malt, which provides some sweetness to balance the hops. After the first bottle, the second seems sweeter, with a more pronounced dark toffee flavor. Interesting balance. Very smooth and drinkable for a 9-percenter. Great stuff."
"D - decent beer, but not a strong contender in the DIPA field either. I would like to taste fresh on tap, but likely won't chase down another bottle."
"D- Not the easiest to get down, though it has a decent flavor. The hoppiness is a bit extravagant, though the added malts help tame the potential bitterness of this beer. Very potent, and at that this beer can be drank at very small quantities."
"i could smell the hops right as i opened the bottle. pours a somewhat murky dark amber, with some orange in the light. a nice off white head with very nice retention. and quite a bit of sticky lacing on the glass. the aroma is a pungent, resiny, piney, tropically fruity,and floral hop smell. amazing to have such a complex aroma of hops from only one kind of hop! caramel, bready malts struggle to balance. intense bitterness off the first sip. all the piney, grassy, resiny flavors are there. again in the taste the malt struggles to balance the beer. way more on the hoppy side. finishs with a little buttery caramel malts that immediatly give way to bright bitter grassy hop flavor. heavy body. sticky, oily, resiny mouthfeel from the high amount of hops used in this beer. quite a bit of bitterness. drinkability suffers a tad because of the high alcohol, but that doesnt mean you couldnt easily drink 3 or 4 of these in a night. definately a beer worth checking out. gotta love that simcoe hop!"
"D: This beer is heavy, bitter, and unbalanced...additionally, at 9% its even less drinkable. Its not that bad of a DIPA but 6 - 12 oz of this is enough for me."
"I wouldn't call this outstanding, but it is very good and worth a try."
"Really nice appearance with a dark honey body and nice sheets of lace are left at one inch intervals down the glass as the beer is consumed. The smell isn't as bold as many other have claimed, still very good with honey crusted oranges, spruce and floral notes. The simcoe hop is really that good by itself. Mouthfeel is where this beer shines, heavy, syrupy and smooth with understated carbonation. An outstanding DIPA and a now a personal favorite."
"D: Do yourself a favor and go get a bomber (or 4 pack) - you won't be disappointed! A great beer for hopheads! Slainte!"
"d - Overall I thought it was decent, but not that great. Very bitter and you can taste the alcohol and tell that it is 9%. There are definitely better IPAs out there that I would buy before buying this again, but I'm not opposed to giving it another chance further on down the road."
"Overall I liked this beer more than most double IPAs."
"Come on Weyerbacher, get some new labels."
"The taste starts mellow before spiking into a hoppy explosion. The flavor is all herbal and floral with the fruit flavors showing up as the bitterness mellows. The malt is present but a little thin and tastes of a lightly toasted biscuit. As I continue to taste this, the hop mix becomes a little easier to discern, much tarter than expected with lime and grape fruit following a floral wallop. Over this is good but rests too much on the simcoe, although it's really still good, especially for used only one hop type."
"Very tasty."
"Tasty, tasty. Very smooth, chewy and almost syrupy. Heavy pine and citrus flavors bite into my taste buds. Hops dominated, but the malt makes a valiant effort to punch through as the sweetness and breadiness still make an impact. Semi-dry finish with notes of woody pine and tobacco."
"Big disappointment. Either this is way passed its prime (I don't think so, I got it from a place I used to work at) or I totally misremembered it. Considering I was hammered last time I had it, I'm wagering that's what happened. Oh well, now I wont bother regretting being unable to get it in SoCal."
"Drinkability: The appearance is great, nose is great, but the tasting just didn't go as well as I had hoped. Perhaps I'll have to try another bottle sometime."
"I have no trouble having more than one of these!"
"D: I dont think i could have too many of these because I was feeling it after only a few sips"
"A very hoppy beer it pours a dark gold/orange in colr witha noticeable lack of a head. With every siip you can taste the high hoppiness of the style. The bitterness of the hops taste lingered in the mouth making it difficult to enjoy any other style of beer. Really had to fight to drink it because the floral nature of the hops really fights hard."
"Drinkability: Despite the diacetyl problems, I can take down a bottle in ten minutes in no time."
"D: It's as drinkable as a 9% can be, which is to say you better watch your a$$. The mouthfeel is a bit of a turn off in that department I'm afraid."
"DIPAs like this are one of my last frontiers of beer. It took me some time to adjust to the really hoppy stuff. Now that Im beginning to appreciate the hoppy stuff I find this to be one of the best DIPAs Ive ever had."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable and almost quaffable, in my opinion. However, to really appreciate the profile of Simcoe hops, I recommend sipping with like minded friends."
"General: Definitely a tasty brew. Would get it again. Don't know how well it'd do with age in a bottle, but fresh, this is a great beer."
"D: I really enjoy simcoe alot. An essential part to any DIPA/IPA nowadays IMO. I could make this a session beer if I could get it regularly."
"From notes. Frothy white head on top of deep copper, very active beer. Mostly clear with a bit of yeast haze, good retention, thick lacing. SMELL citrus fruity hop aroma blends beautifully with a bold malty base. Delicious and inviting. Caramel malty comes on late. Has legs. TASTE Rich caramel malty base comes thru as clearly as the hops, and with exceptional balance. A subdued yet sharp bitterness up front fades gradually while fruity and floral hops notes blend with malty sweet flavors. Barely noticeable booze. Not exceptionally complex but wicked smooth and balanced. Some mild bitterness lingers. FEEL thick, rich texture. Full bodied and luxurious. Some warming, dryness in the fairly clean finish. Easy drinking for a big sipper. A great double IPA. And for someone loyal to west coast IPA, I am happy to report that the east is making some pretty kick ass ones as well."
"Overall I find this beer to be one of the best uses of simcoe hops out there. Highly Recommended."
"D: Pleasing to the eyes and tongue it is. I think the mouthfeel is spot on. I would choose some local options over this, but an enjoyable beer that will catch up to you, stealth ABV."
"D- High for such a high ABV beer. Just a fantastic Imperial IPA."
"D: Decent offering. I could see myself having 1 or 2 in a siting, but not a brew I could drink time after time or as a session. Appears to me as a palate changer or something to change things up by."
"Comparing this to anything, would be biting into an under ripe grapefruit to include the rind. This will thrash your palate."
"D: I've had far more drinkable DIPA's in my lifetime than this."
"D - A very good IPA IMO. Even though it is thick and has a high A.B.V. I instantly want another after finishing. Very drinkable. I will absolutely return to this."
"D: As I move through this beer, I had a feeling it could have been a bit fresher, either way, it was still enjoyable."
"D: Good drinkability but a little on the boozy side. However, it's balanced well with the other flavors. This is on the sweeter side of the DIPA's I've had. That being said, will be trying this one again."
"Overall, I would say that this beer is almost too bitter for me. Sound crazy? Yeah, it's crazy to type. Not a bad beer but not my favorite either."
"D- Good beer, I always love an Imp. IPA, it's becoming hard to pick a favorite. This beer is good but I've had better. Worth a try though."
"Overall, a very drinkable IPA, and one that showcases Simcoe very nicely. It's not one that runs the gamut of the Double IPA range, but it does what it does well. There's a reason they put """Simcoe""" (® and all) in the name of the beer."
"This is probably the best readily accessible DIPA around. Serious good looks, great lacing like that's all Weyerbacher cared about. Heavy hop aroma, and grapefruity taste which is unlike most other IPAs. This is the one to go to if that's what you're looking for. This hot damned hoppy malt bomb is one of the best things going. If you find it - try it. You will not be disappointed. I like strong beers and this made me a happy camper. I've never tried anything with Simcoe before, but I willl admit that this might be Weyerbacher's best offering aside from Blasphemy."
"D: Pretty drinkable considering the amount of alcohol in the beer and the amount of hops in it as well."
"Dark and heavy IPA, not for the beginner."
"D: The alcohol presence makes this beer almost too much; I like it and it's one of the better offerings from Weyerbacher but it becomes a bit much toward the end"
"This beer pours a cloudy bright red color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is a sharp pine and grapefruit. It is a very non complex aroma. It is very aggressive though, and seems to work somewhat. The taste is just as aggressive as the aroma, but still lacks true complexity. It does have some nice, intense bitterness which I do enjoy. There is absolutely no malt character which, even in a DIPA, I still miss. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a smooth texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, as I have already mentioned this beer lacks the complexity the a great DIPA must have, but it is still good nonetheless. I would certainly drink it again."
"D - Very delicious, but not something I would want to drink more of in one sitting - perfect sipper at 9%. I'm glad I have 3 more to look forward to this week."
"Poured a cloudy dark orange color with good carbonation and a small white head. Nose is sweet, dry, citrus. Taste is hops up front and all the way through, citrus, earty, dry and some good malt body. Alcohol warming on mouthfeel and dry. Very good IPA"
"D - Fairly drinkable but high in abv."
"Drinkability: Its a delicious beer, with drinkability limited by the total assault on the palate and 9% abv. Delicious stuff, but its one and done. This is not supposed to be a session beer."
"I was expecting something different from a """hybrid""" hop but maybe I was just building up my expectations too much. Overall it is a solid DIPA with both earthy and citrus notes."
"Very drinkable. A notch below the Mikkeller Simcoe, but head and shoulders about the average American IPA."
"I still think Mikkeller is the Simcoe champ and would advise you to the Unfiltered version before this one."
"Edit: Not sure if they changed the receipe or the hop type or if my tastebuds just changed, but I want from loving this beer to liking it just ok. I'd still recommend it, but not as a secondary to Bell's Hopslam."
"Poured a deep, cloudy amber with a moderate head that dissipated to a patchy skin. The aroma was hop citrus. The taste was strong and crisp hop, mild citrus and a backdrop of malty sweetness. The feel was full bodied and oily with little carbonation. Drinkability was good. Good stuff, not """in your face hops", but still powerful, nice balance and well done."
"-Bye"
"Overall, a nice Imperial IPA, reminiscent of a West Coast IPA"
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark orange color, nice carbonation, huge foamy off white head, tons of huge islands and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is of sweet malts, hops a plenty, slight citrus and slight caramel. The taste follows the nose pretty much, very hoppy and sweet malty. A very nice bitter/dry finish. Medium body, well rounded brew."
"This is one huge hop bomb, very smooth, unbelievably bitter, and a hop head's dream. I could sip a few of these in one sitting, I absolutely love this one and is my favorite beer from Weyerbacher, hands down."
"The taste is full of simcoe hops, somewhat earthy and vinous, a touch harsh on the palate. Moderate caramel sweetness is a bit too much. A bit astringent of a flavor, though it does cover up the 9% alcohol content. Medium bodied with a medium-high carbonation, maybe a little much but again probably necessary for the overall feel of the brew. Interesting big simcoe brew here, though definitely not perfect. Worth trying."
"Poured from corked 750ml which had some serious champagne cork action and probably the most yeast/sediment I've ever seen. Translucent reddish orange with amber edges, billowing cream colored head which fades after many minutes to a one finger meringue-like cap and leaves thick clumps of lace. Smell: pine, pineapple, pink grapefruit, earthiness, fairly raw but not that explosive, big caramel in the back. Taste: pink grapefruit, tangerine, candied citrus rind, earthy pine, medicinal biterness and alcohol at the end of the sip, prevalent caramel sweetness. Mouthfeel: creamy, thick and syrupy, almost chewy. Drinkability, he says with most of a 750 left to go, is good even though it is slightly sweet and slightly rough at the end of the sip. Fantastic looking, at least in the corked bottles, and tasty DIPA. Not my favorite of the style, but it's quite good, impressive use of the simcoe (R)."
"A dream sickly pour of orange body and cream colored head that flatens quickly leaving a nice lace til the end. The smell is powerful hop explosion both floral and piney. This brew is so sublimely out of balance I can hardly stand it. The hop profiles are top notch. I could drink this stuff all day long. The brew is sticky and rich simulataneously a great texture on the pallet. I have had few better AIPAs this year."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable I2PA very drinkable hoppy but well balanced at the same time. Grabbed one from the store to try will be picking up more."
"The taste is very hop/malt balanced. A caramel sweetness and tropical fruitiness hit the tongue first and then eases into a slight and bitter bite from the Simcoe hops. There's a very nice floral component alongside some good piney qualities. Very textbook IIPA. In the end, the aftertaste carries a subtle lingering bitterness, but not as potent as I thought it would be. I couldn't believe that this was 9% ABV. There is no striking boozy flavor at all. Mouthfeel is very smooth and coats the mouth very well. Drinks like a light syrup and delightfully so. Drinkability is high, but in moderation. That hidden 9% is so ninja, I didn't even notice but it's still incredibly tasty. Well-rounded DIPA for sure and a great product to help one ease into the IPA style."
"Poured amber/copper with a finger of white head, that laced fairly well. The smell was exceedingly hoppy bitter with pine, lemon, and floral hints. What amazed me about the flavor was how smooth the hop bitterness was, which dissolved mid-palate to wood & earthiness, and then to a dry bitterness at the finish. Especially surprising for a DOUBLE ipa; most of the double ipa's nowadays are exceedingly citrusy sweet, but not this one. Medium-bodied, fairly carbonated, and a nice dryness at the finish. This strong beer is scary-smooth."
"D- This is one damn good Double IPA. Little room for improvement. Perfect abv to match taste and style, and such a rich flavor to keep it coming."
"drinkability: overall a decent DIPA, and I would recommend."
"D: I was shocked by how mediocre this beer was. It has been hyped to be something excellent, but I really thought it was average at best. I am now wondering if I didn't get an older bottle based on the non-existence of the hop profile. I will seek out a fresher bottle and alter this review if it is better. Until then, I guess this is how it will remain."
"There are more incredible examples of the DIPA out there, but the Weyerbacher take can certainly hang with its brethren. Chock full of simcoe hops with enough malt to balance things out. Tasty."
"drinkability - surprisingly drinkable considering the 9%. Wonderful find."
"D 4.0 - This is an awesome rep of a Simcoe IPA, but at 9/10% ABV you have to take it slow!!"
"Being so rich it is easy to say that I'd only have one then change up for my second. But cheesecake is rich too. Just wanting one at a time doesn't mean lack of drinkability. If you are looking for a strong hop flavor that is not as bitter and undistinguished as a run-of-the-mill IPA, look for the Double Simcoe from Weyerbacher. It definitely gave a fix to this hop head tonight."
"D - Good for a mega hop bomb."
"Dark copper color, with a perfect head and lots of clinging to the glass. There was a decent layer on top of the beer until it was all gone. Smells wonderful, lots of citrus especially grapefruit and orange. Tastes as it smells with an incredibly bracing and pleasant bitterness. There's a hint of sweetness to the citrus flavor that helps make it slightly more drinkable than most. Nice carbonation which, combined with the hop bitterness makes this beer truly refreshing. It just screamed out for some spicy food to balance it out. Highly recommended."
"I think that this one has a lot going for it. The aspirin taste knocked it down some. Would love to try fresh from the tap. Looking forward to my 750ml bottle of the Unfiltered version."
"Thick two finger head atop a hazy amber. Definate hops presence in the smell, which is dominated by grapefruit and pine. I really got the grapefruit in the taste. This is especially true at the finish. Sweet bready malts present themselves toward the beginning. Thick hoppy resiny sticky feel. Can tell there is a hefty amount of alcohol in here too. This is pretty good, but I have had better in the style."
"drinkability is good; the sheer amount of hops here hurts the drinkability, but the brew is done well enough to remain at least a bit drinkable. a solid offering by Weyerbacher. cheers!"
"T- At first it tasted great. But the aftertaste just kind of turned me off. It's a decent beer, and is easy to get used to, but there are certainly better Imp. IPAs out there."
"Poured a beautiful copper, slightly cloudy, with a tan/cream head having good retention, and leaving ample lacing clinging to the glass. Aroma of sweet and citrusy pink grapefruit was tremendous, balanced with hints of pine and orange. Couldn't wait to taste this thing and it did not disappoint. Taste was bold, huge grapefruit upfront, less sweet than it smelled, with bitter pine on the finish. Bitterness did not linger and isn't overly harsh in my opinion. Although hops take center stage, the malt backbone can be detected giving just a bit of contrast. Mouthfeel was smooth with a medium body. This one left me dying for another, although at 9% ABV this is no session beer."
"Drinkability: This DiPA is definatly one of the best that iv'e had. I feel that it has all the hop punch and complexity that one expects, but also a solid and tasty malt middle. I love simcoe hops. Very complex for only one hop variety and a big ole' brew, well done Weyerbacher brewers!"
"EDIT- as I finish the pint, I think I've figured out what this beer reminds me of. It's like a half-mast DFH 120, complete with the sweetness, heavy malt bill, and pungent hops. Bravo!"
"D- A very intense beer, this is one to be enjoyed, savored, at 9% ABV be careful."
"Crisp and complex hop profile. Tangy but yet a little sweet. Alcohol in the belly but not on the tongue or in the nose. Bitter velvet on the tongue. Easily went through two pints before the alcohol made me stop."
"D. First experience with Simcoe hops, and it was a very pleasant one. This is easy drinking and smooth. The higher ABV was fairly well hidden. I think I am a fan of Simcoe."
"D: I am really angry that I don't have a case of this sitting around. I often don't enjoy IPA's that are too piney but this is done so well. It's really well balanced and when I say balanced I don't mean that it is equal parts malt and hops because it is not. This is a hop machine but there is just the right amount of malt to keep the hops in check and allow a really big beer to have some restraint. It's no session beer but I want more. I also really want to try other brews by this brewery."
"MF/D: Highly drinkable, a little intense after a few, but very nicely done. Beware; this beer will crush your palate, so drink this one last."
"Smooth drinking, could use a little more carbonation."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again but just another or else I'd be stuck in the evergreen forest. lol"
"A really fantastic beer, all in all. Be ready to be humbled."
"Mmmm this one is a good one the likes of which I havent had since the last bottle of ruination I had. Pours an orangeish red with a peachy head has a sort of apricot finish. Smells sort of orangeish. Very thick, one of the thickest mouthfeels I had in awhile. Good carbonation. It's a big beer so while I could drink alot of it it could floor you with its big abv"
"Pours cloudy amber. Full on citrusy hops in the nose and on the tongue. The hops is not harsh or overly piney. Some earthyness in the nose. A very balanced dose of malty sweetness underneath. Crisp biting mouth feel. Scrubs the palette. Paired this with a great spanish chorizo."
"12oz. bottle served in a tulip. Poured a murky burnt orange with a half-inch frothy, off-white head embedded with tiny ringlets. Head eventually recedes into a broken cap - thicker around the edges than in the middle, with a swath and some spots of lacing exposed as the brew is consumed. Great nose - sweet grapefruit up-front, followed by some piny/resinous hops towards the back. Flavors are more evened out than suggested by the nose - sweetness and piny quality muddle together nicely on a malty backbone and play some tricks on the palate (is it sweet, is it bitter?) - my personal preference with DIPAs is more to the sweet side of the spectrum, but this is a pretty nice compromise in my opinion. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, a little oily on the tongue with a fairly even amount of background carbonation that peaks a little towards the back of the tongue - not too much lingering bitterness. Solid DIPA with a fairly well-hidden abv. - qualities change slightly as the brew warms, so a pleasant sipper."
"Pours a dark amber color with two fingers of off-white head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Big hop aroma of grapefruit, tangerine, and pine. No doubt what you are gettin into with this aroma. The first thing that hits my tongue is a blast of citrus followed by high bitterness. It is hard to pick out any malt but there is a sense of some caramel sweetness there. Alcohol taste and warmth in the finish that has the affect of cleansing the bitterness from the palate. Has a nice soft texture and carbonation. Medium bodied. A good showcase of a single hop variety. I would of preferred some semblence of balance. High bitterness and ABV limits drinkability as well."
"Enjoy this and it's an enjoyable DPA. The sense of the ABV slows it for me a bit, but that's expected at a 9% level. Very solid readily available DPA.."
"Personally couldn't drink too many of these in a sitting but it is an amazingly good brew."
"Carbonation is light, but appropriate. It is medium in body, but quite creamy and silky. It has a great hop sweetness balance that make it very drinkable, maybe too drinkable for it's 9% abv."
"D - Pretty drinkable considering the level of hopping and the alcohol. There is a lot of hop intensity here, but not a lot of complexity. The aroma is quite a bit better than the flavor. I am impressed that this is able to come off as balanced as it is while leaving a lingering spicy bitterness and the distinct impression that the hops are in charge. A pretty nice DIPA overall, though the hop flavor could use a little more variety and a somewhat more rounded, less astringent, bitterness."
"D- This is a dangerous drinker. The ABV is high on this one but so well hidden. Very tasty and leaves me wanting another one which I have in my fridge but I don't know if I want to crack it open yet or wait. Very good beer!"
"The drinkability is quite easy, but careful of the sneaky heat as that 9% does sink in soon after the glass has been drained."
"D - A very intense beer, it is almost daunting at times. For me, this is one to enjoy occasionally. I would like to give this a try on draft."
"This beer is burnt orange and oh so cloudy. The thick head that's staring me in the face is like hop flavored ice cream. I want to grab a spoon and take a bite. The amount of lace that remains after settling is could be scraped off with a knife. The smell is sweet yet pungent bitter hop cones. I get a sort of musky woods aroma as well. It actually relaxes me as I take deep whiffs. The flavor is similar to the nose. Hoppy and rediculously bitter but sweet and musk like. Like pine chips might taste. Not a bad thing by any means. The mouth feel is super sticky. It sort of latches onto my teeth and makes my mouth gritty. I get no hint of the high abv at all. This is a very good DIPA."
"D: Kind of hard to have a second one right after the first. This is an explosion of flavor, and it's so much that my palate needs some rest about 3/4 of the way through, and I definitely couldn't enjoy another one right away. But later? Yes."
"Alcohol is too high to make this extremely drinkable, but that just goes with the style. Still, a damn tasty and impressive beer from Weyerbacher."
"Overall - It's not the obnoxious bitter bomb that Ruination is, but it's close. I think I'll stick to 90min. while I'm biding my time before Hopslam comes around again."
"Overall, one of my favorite DIPA's. Very tasty and very drinkable. Beautiful lacing and very balanced. A staple of the style and a great showcase of my favorite hop, Simcoe."
"The beer goes down fast and I'm almost thankful another isn't in my home or I'd be on my second as I write this. Mouthfeel is just right. Well done Weyerbacher. I'm going to keep my eyes peeled for more beer from you."
"D - Big bite and loud flavors make this a pallet killer ready to close out your night."
"The bitterness gets strong with every sip. I'm a hophead and I'm actually getting sick of this one half way through. Nice attempt at a DIPA, but there are quite a few better examples out there."
"Pours a clear amber with a billowing white head that produces sheets of lace. The aroma has a boatload of piny hops, like a titanic boatload (and like the titanic this one goes down easy). A slight spiciness and a sweet caramel compliment the hopping. Oh hoppy goodness - this is f'ing amazing. Huge caramel malts lead off, but get an absolute beating midway from a pine tree, segueing into a fragrant finish that lasts forever. The amazing thing is that its actually well balanced in the sense that they used a ton of malts and a ton of hops. The body is full and smooth, with low carbonation. Damn, its so drinkable. Awesome stuff from Weyerbacher!"
"D-Good. COuld drink a few of these"
"Pours a copper amber color with a thick head. The aroma is on pine and earthy hops, the smell is very strong, it is balanced out by some malt. The taste is of pine hops and some other earthy hops, there is a slight amount of malt present. Mouthfeel, I let this sit for a while and got a slight carbonation, but nothing overpowering. The drinkability is above average, it is a strong full hop taste that could be over powering, however, the malt smooths it out."
"Overall, this is a decent DIPA. The flavor lags behind, however, when compared with the look, smells, and mouthfeel. This could also use a little more refinement, as the hops are present but not pervasive, which is the point of any (D)IPA."
"CHEERS!"
"Pours an appetizing dark coppery amber with a thick, off-white, fine-bubbled head that sticks around for a bit. Aroma is rich and hoppy to the point of being piny with a strong citrus overtone. Flavor is strongly hoppy, a little bitter with just a touch of citrus, more orange than lemon. Texture is smooth as milk but pleasingly fizzy and tingly. One of the best IPAs I have ever had! I strongly recommend this to all IPA fans."
"Salud!"
"taste is exceptional! probably my favorite Double IPA as of now (and Hop Stoopid was hard to beat)"
"I only wish the alcohol was a little less... just so I could drink more of these in one sitting!"
"Nose is strong hops and sweet malt, with a spicy undercurrent. well balanced. Taste is immediate big citrus hops, and a lasting malt background. Hops swing around again to linger at the end, mixing with slight ethanol. Full mouthfeel. Very solid DIPA."
"Overall, you can sip this one. Got a 12 oz. bottle, and I think that though the bomber would be easily finished, it would be a bit much at the end. A tasty hop heavy beverage."
"Very solid East coast Dipa especially for a single hop bill"
"A great strong bitter piney manly brew. I feel like this would be a great camping brew. Love the Simcoe hops and its flavors/aromas. Malts are overshadowed by the hops, but in a good way. They lend just enough balance to it. Good alcohol presence for the brew. I like this one a lot. Good alternative to a lot of the big citrusy doubles out there. It's semi-tough to find around new england, but I have found a place that now seems to constantly carry it. woo hoo"
"'It's like a mighty tree of malt-wood and hop-leaves growing in my mouth.'"
"Drinkability- Big ABV and heavy body make this a one bomber mission."
"Gives me something to look forward to when my simcoe beer comes out of the fermenter in a few weeks."
"D - Really easy to drink even with the high ABV. Wish it was available in CO. Very enjoyable. To the letter all the way IIPA"
"I poured this one and I knew I was in for a good time. Hazy orange-red with a bubbly, cream colored head. The smell was amazing: hop dominated with equal parts grapefruit and pine. Beautiful mouthfeel. The only negative was that the finish was a bit too bitter."
"Finally saw this in stock over in Wiscoland so picked up a 4 pack. Tasty, solid DIPA, plenty of hop goodness and not super bitter. Good stuff!"
"Moderate drinkability that could change with each sip."
"At 9% alcohol, this could be a dangerous beer, because it's hard to put down. This is a definite must-try. Cheers."
"Can't wait to try the unfiltered. Very nice offering from Weyerbacher."
"D: Another winner from Weyerbacher. I hadn't given them a fair shake in the past because of their godawful label art. But their beers have been consistently impressive. I'll bet mixing this with Heresy would make a killer black and tan."
"d: this started off reasonably well in hop/malt balance but the hop level eventually made it a little less inviting for me"
"Update – Haven’t had this one in a couple of years so thought I’d compare a 2011 to the one I had in 2009. Really this beer hasn’t changed a bit. It’s still pure, Simcoe goodness with a perfect sweetish malt balance. One of my favorite East Coast DIPAs."
"Cheers!!!"
"Drinkability - This is a very enjoyable beer. Lots of intense flavor and well-masked alcohol, but I find the hops too strong to want to session this."
"D: 9% is hidden quite well, but the large malt presence on this one makes it not *as* quaffable as some DIPAs I've had. Still, an excellent brew that really showcases how delicious Simcoe hops are. I'm glad I've got 3 more bottles of this to enjoy."
"Nice DIPA and worth grabbing. Glad I have more in the fridge."
"Drinkability: I love the flavor, I love the body and the feel is great -- the ABV is a bit high and that lowers it a bit, but overall it's a great beer and I would love a second."
"Overall, this is a darn good beer. I can't say I'm always happy with Weyerbacher's selection, but this one is quite tasty, strong, and overall very drinkable."
"It reminds me a lot of Dogfish Head's excellent 90 Minute DIPA. Very malty and out of the box. Not the most drinkable DIPA in the world, but very enjoyable, nonetheless."
"Drink is good a little bit too much hoppiness otherwise this might have been a great session beer but definetly a must try for the taste."
"D: A very good beer and probably awesome when fresh, but without a date, I don't know how old this is. The hops have a lot of the bittering parts left, but it seems like some of the aroma has dissipated. I am glad I had a couple of these, but I won't buy it again unless there is a date on the bottle."
"D- A nice DIPA that fits in well with others but doesn't stand out."
"The beer is quite bitter with a great maltiness. The hop flavour is quite good. It's a nice balance between a huge bitterness and extreme fruitiness. Fucking tasty. It lacks a slight bit of flavour hops, but that's probably because it's old. The mouthfeel is almost perfect on the beer, which makes it even more drinkable."
"Poured recklessly into a pint glass by my friend! after the head settled down, the color is very nice amber and the smell is pure hoppiness. First taste is great. Very hoppy, fruity, citrus. This was my first Simcoe IPA and it was just so tasty. Very drinkable and I'm sorry I had to share it! I'm looking forward to opening the Special Unfiltered version I just got too. This is an awesome beer and I highly recommend it."
"I really wish there was some kind of date on the bottle. I have a feeling that it might be a little old based on the strength of the hops in my bottle versus other reviews, so I would be open to trying it again despite not being crazy about this bottle."
"I have had this beer before, but neglected to review it. The bottle I am drinking now tastes as though this beer as some age on it. While still a good drink, the simcoe hops seem to have faded, as they give off more of a grapefruit citrus taste. There is nice lacing along the glass, indicating an incredibly sticky beer. The body is a rusted copper brown, with a slight haze to it. The smell is predominately grapefruit and caramel sweetness. Again, going off of memory, I distinctly recall a fatal punch of Simcoe hops the first time I had this beer which resulted in a very piney winterfresh scent. The taste is mostly grapefruit citrus, with a fair pine hop kick towards the end. In the background, caramel malts provide both balance and substance. The mouthfeel is a bit wet, again not something true to this beer when served fresh. Could easily drink this beer again, but I would have preferred it to be fresh as I remember it best."
"Drinkability is actually pretty good for 9%, not wickedly anything. Just good."
"jwc215 sent this one! The color is a cloudy dark orange with a half inch head, leaving a decent amount of lacing. Smells strongly of citrus. The taste is a dark citrus flavor, sweet and bitter at the same time. So that's what simcoe hops taste like. Grapefruit with a healthly dose of sweet orange thrown in. A bit more sweet than I prefer, actually. The stickyness and sweetness tended to wear on my palette as I worked my way through this one, and they were a little over the top. Still a solid IPA."
"12oz bottle. Pours a slightly hazy dark copper with a small eggshell head. Strong aromas of grapefruity, floral hops with a bit of cannabis. Biscuity malt in the back. Surprisingly sweet, malty flavor. Light grapefruit character. Some weak bitterness leads to a dry finish. Full bodied. Pleasant, but not mind-blowing."
"Drinkability: For an Imperial IPA I was expecting more of a punch, but overall this beer is very drinkable and I look forward to having another."
"D - One of the best looking brews around... Excellent beer that a little more balance would make world class, however, if you're looking for a hop assault this is your brew..."
"Medium body, thick, smooth, bitter taste all the way through, but pretty drinkable for a double IPA, good carbonation. Overall, I am not a big double IPA fan, but this one is a pretty good one."
"Some carbonation, but not a ton - not sure on keg age but a good carbonated presence."
"Thank you Phil, our first trade was badass!"
"A strong grapefruit flavor with a maltness that balance the overall flavor of the beer."
"Pours a golden amber with a thick, lacy tan head. A bouquet of fresh hops and thick bready malts, caramel candies, ripe fruits and peppery alcohol. Taste has a delicate blend of floral hops and creamy malts up front followed by more bitter hops, citrus, and fruity alcohol. Smooth body is well carbonated, tasty stuff."
"Overall an excellent Double IPA, very flavorful and aromatic. Highly recommendable!"
"Overall I enjoy the taste of this beer in small doses. Drinkability is not very high because its strong for me, 9%. its a sipper..and, beware, you are left with very boozy breath. If you are driving after drinking this at a bar beware!"
"With Double Simcoe IPA, one of the best beers I've ever had, came from a completely unexpected place. A thrilling surprise that made my weekend worthwhile."
"This is a great IIPA. Should rank up there with the best."
"pours a dark amber color with a nice creamy head and good lacing til the end the smell is a hop forward beer with grass,pine and citrus smells,with a malt backbone..the taste is all hops up frontvery citrus tates the the malt kicks in to balance out this dipa..overall a tasty dipa not my favorite but well worth a try"
"I said """dead garden.""" I think that's accurate; it's a very soily, earthy DIPA, with hops standing out above everything else. Even with the overdone aftertaste, I don't mind drinking it, even though I doubt I'd take more than one."
"Notes: I continue to sample beers of all styles, trying to embrace the whole """hops""" thing but it is just not working. This might be one of the hoppiest beers that I have ever had."
"D: Wow, there's no hiding the hops here. An absolute hop explosion, amazingly the courtesy of a one single hop variety. I'm admittedly a hop head and when I need a fix, this beer offers just what I'm looking for. However, two is the limit on this. With the 9% ABV and the not so subtle hop assault, anymore and you'd just be wasting a fine beer."
"Thanks to PEBKAC for the brew."
"D - I'm so happy I finally got to try this...boy does it give someone their hop fix...can't have too many or you won't be able to taste anything!"
"Very drinkable. Lots of flavors and complexity. Good balance as well. Not my favorite DIPA, but definitely a great one. I do prefer Hop Wallop and 90 Minute over this. My second great offering from Weyerbacher."
"Pours a delicious looking dark copper with a brainy head that takes its time to dissipate. The nose to me is soft but smells of typical pine. The initial flavor is sweet but that quickly gives way to intense hoppiness and backend bitters on the tongue. The aftertaste isn't unpleasant and for me, that's saying something with a double IPA. Truth is though, I'd rather look at this beer than drink it...I'm just not a hop lover. Therefore, drinkability and taste take a hit. I can see why this is a popular beer though."
"drinkablility this is an easy drinking IIPA and I'm a fan"
"I'm BuffaloTapHugger....and I just discovered Simcoe (R) Hops."
"The drinkability is very nice for the abv, I could and will have more than one of these."
"Drinkability: This is highly drinkable except for the ABV. I could easily sip away and finish off several of these in a sitting, but would probably have trouble standing later. ☺"
"D- Very delicious and well balanced."
"Love everything about this beer, save the price."
"Looking good, smelling alright, tasting a bit off. An aroma of orange peel sweet bread. Scents of candied hops and sweet malt. A syrupy, toffee beginning turns burnt sugar hops to peel zest. Metallic notes reminiscent of iron in blood, possibly just the bottle at hand. A light spiced carmel provides a backbone for high pitch citrus twang. Booze is well hidden, sweetness is not. An interesting stop on the DIPA highway."
"D: Weyerbacher doesn't seem to try and hide the fact that this is a 9% ABV brew and it shows."
"Gorgeous-looking beer with large white foamy head that leaves lacing on top of dark honey brown colored brew. A floral aroma of fresh hops, pine, citrus notes and other light fruits. Aggressive on the hops with pine and bitter notes throughout interrupted by light, flittering fruit notes, alcoholic booze and grassy, soapy flavors in the aftertaste. Bubbly carbonation tickles the tongue and for this 9% is highly drinkable for various seasons."
"Pours a murky blood-orange color with a thick khaki colored head that left some sticky lacing on the glass. A very nice citrus and floral hop aroma. More on the orange side of citrus. Very nice and fresh aroma. Light floral & citrus (more grapefruit) hop flavor to start followed by a bittering resin crush. A nice bready malt supports the hop flavors but takes a back seat like any good DIPA should. A healthy malt body with pricky carbonation, a bit of an ABV burn. A very good DIPA, the hops are forefront with a supporting malt body. The ABV and bitterness keep the drinkability down for me but this is a good brew."
"I absolutely love the Simcoe hop, and Weyerbacher has done an excellent job at . I'm terribly lucky to have Pliny the Elder easily available year round, not to mention the many other great California DIPAs and IPAs. Even with all those great choices, I wouldn't hesitate to put this beer in my normal hops lineup if it were distributed out here. The Simcoe hop has a wonderfully complex flavor. It's citric, piny and floral all at once. The feel is a tad dry, but it hardly detracts. The malt backbone is able to stand up to the assault of hops and lend enough sweetness to bring out the full flavor of the hops. I'm enjoying this beer very, very much."
"This is an excellent IPA, tons of hops flavor, well balanced maintains its drinkability. Love it."
"Drinkable. But it pales in comparison to Hopslam, and I prefer Gordon to it as well. I'll probably try it again one day. Maybe this bottle was old, because it was not as good as I expected."
"Poured for a huge pillow layer of head, medium pour. Smell of slight pine and citrice. Taste has a slight sweetness but overall the bitterness dominates. A sipper for sure, and although others said it could be session beer, this is a huge IPA and probably just not my style, a good beer overall."
"Very easy to drink. The alcohol flavor and smell disappear after a few minutes and this one goes down smooth."
"Drinkability: If you're a fan of well-balanced DIPAs, this is the one for you. If you're more of a fan of the stronger hop/citrus presence, this isn't what you're looking for. A good beer, but one that's not really my cup of tea."
"Pours a cloudy orange color with a white creamy head. Aroma is filled with citric and floral hops, with a hint of earthyness. Inviting. This beer tastes good. But the palate dissappoints compared to the aroma, which I have experienced not infrequently in some newcomers to the IIPA arena. The bitterness is there, but the hops are somewhat one-note. The feel is a touch sticky, and certainly dry, but could have a bit more body, a bit more umph. The alcohol is well balanced. A solid brew, but tough to get top grades in this style."
"Pours out a golden orange with a nice big white head that retains very well. Piney hop aroma with a tinge of citrus. Pretty pleasant ipa aroma. Whew, this is one big hoppy brew. Starts with a nice citrus tang followed by an extreme bittering and some pine coating of the tounge. Very chewy thick brew that bombards the palate with bitterness and hop oil. Very big ipa, but extremely one sided (obviously). It's interesting to try and get that nice simcoe taste, but in an dipa i need it coming from all angles, i need some floral, more citrus, and some balance. A true hopbomb and a good one at that, but I prefer mine a little different. Good brew, but not my style."
"The reason I really like this beer is that it gives me a good idea of what to expect from a certain hop, in this case, simcoe. As a homebrewer, it can be very useful to have a single hop beer so that it's characteristics are on display without interference from other types."
"D: Not sessionable but on this cold winter evening snuggling with my baby its a great relaxing treat."
"The flavor is somewhat one dimensional from a hop perspective. I didn't notice any malt sweetness or depth of flavor beyond hops and citrus notes, but I did pick up a honey sweetness more than likely from the alcohol. What this beer laked in a multi dimensional flavor is more than made up in its """lip smacking""" good hop impact. Your tongue will salivate while drinking this beer as it certainly doesn't lack hop bitterness. If you are partial to hoppy beers, you'll certainly enjoy this one. I'd consider this a must try beer."
"Drinkability: A very nice DIPA. The hop bitterness rules the slight asprin after taste probably goes better with food. Its a great brew for sipping not gulping."
"poured from a bottle. pours deep cloudy amber with a good inch high thick white head. scents of sweet citrus just pour out of the glass. flavor is sweet that becomes very thick and bitter towards the finish. the finish is red grapefruit. not as much malt presence here. carbonation is medium. this is dangerous at 9% ABV! Overall this is one solid beer. weyerbacher has yet to let me down."
"Big time hops in this beer. Hazy amber with a dense head that is super sticky. Lace klings to places I didnt know it could kling to. Aroma is massive, with pineapple and resinous pine sap all over the place. The smell hits you the second you pop the cap off the bottle...awesome! Flavour is much the same as the aroma, big fruity pinapple and thick pine sap with a subtle bready malt character. The bitterness is uncompromising in its assault on your tongue, I love it. Smooth bitterness is for wimps. Has a sweet edge to it, but not cloying like other DIPAs Ive had lately. This is a big beer, and one that took awhile for me to finish. A definate sipper. World class example of the style."
"I'd like the malts to hit back a bit more, but a good DIPA."
"Notes: Weyerbacher really impressed me with this one. I came in thinking 90 minute was going to blow the others out of the water but this brew was amazing. +1 for the small guys in Easton."
"D- If I'm in the mood to drink a really hoppy beer this tastes great, but i wouldn't want to drink the whole four pack"
"Alright--this beer is great, I love it. It shows its best colours as it warms. Fantastic."
"From a 12 oz. bottle send from a friend in MD. Aroma is full of pineapple like I just opened a can of Dole. Slightly sweet aroma. Color is an orange amber with a haze and a half inch beige head. Flavors are toasty, bread crust with hop bitterness and more pineapple flavor from the simcoe. A little sweet, but fairly expected from the 9% abv. Full mouthfeel that is not over carbonated and big and silky over the tongue. Not over the top. Pretty good."
"The hop bitterness, while strong, is not overpowering. The Double Simcoe IPA is a very nice showcase for a delicious American hop variety, and goes just far enough with the malt to make it drinkable. If there was a small increase in the malt base, this beer would be a great example of what a double IPA should be. As it stands, though, this beer is really good and very enjoyable for someone who likes American hops."
"Nice chewy mouthfeel."
"Another winner from Weyerbacher, and at an easy-to-drink 9%, a dangerous one."
"Out of a 22oz bomber this American Double was a cloudy amber/copper color with a finger of beige head atop it. The retention was good, the lacing excellent. The aroma was herbal and lightly spicy, punctuated by citrus rind and toffee-like sweetness from the malt. The flavors were also big and well wounded, at first I got the bitter and nearly astringent hops bite followed by lots of orange peel, some puckering grapefruit and elements of pine before the sweet malt finally offered some balance towards the end. Big, bad, bold. The mouthfeel was slick and oily, the carbonation lively but not unpleasant, the body medium to full. A good example of the style and the large flavor profile quashed the strong alcohol levels."
"Quite good, did not get the 'cat pee' flavor mentioned by some."
"Deliciously hoppy and unbalanced. The malt was difficult to find, which can be a good thing sometimes. An impressive brew with a catastrophe of a label. And the empty glass really does have that uric acid/cat pee aroma. Not sure what it is. But it can be remedied by not inhaling aromatics after consuming. Weird. but all in all, an impressive DIPA, and I'd drink one anyday."
"I'm impressed with this Weyerbacher offering. If so inclined, you could put away a few without bothering to care that it's 9%. Though I certainly like the IPAs that use hop blends, too, it's cool to have one with a single hop variety, so you can really taste that one hop."
"Surprisingly good, despite the label. Strong, hoppy, and super unbalanced. I'd try it on tap, but unfortunately for Weyerbacher, Chan's Wine World in Sandestin doesn't monitor the shelf life of their beer. I think mine was too old to give an honest review."
"Not much drinkability for me here, way too much hops, and I'd like to consider myself a hophead. As such if I see this on tap again, I'll give it another try, but this time through, just wasn't that great. High ABV makes you limit yourself anyway."
"Strong head of creamy white, plenty of diversely sized bubbles, the lacing is thick and sticky. Really cloudy amber orange to brown in color, does capture the light and glow nicely, complete opacity. Enveloping nose, tentacles of sweet grain and oat hops combine with a dollop of honey and croissant flakes to grease it into the nostrils, pleasing orange pulp and pine oil bits, energetic without having to be bitter to achieve this. Full-bodied, does a great job of sinking into the palate without engendering heaviness. Sweet tangerine to pink grapefruit citrus create a bridge between the honey, glazed dough, oat elements and the grassy bitterness and black tea notes. For its density, very smooth and drinkable, in fact, dangerously so. Remains completely rich and full through the finish."
"Nice deep amber color. Boy, the pine aroma hits the nose before you can even satrt to drink. After the initial """pininess""" the citrus aroma and flavors come out. Nice full mouth feel and hoppy finish. I didn't realize it was 9%abv until I reached the beeradvocate page for this beer. I will buy again when I see it."
"My first Weyerbacher and I was very impressed. Pours a deep amber with a nice head that left nice lacing in a goblet. The floral hop smell hits you immediately and made me dive right in. Bitterness with a long finish follows my first sip. Nice carbonation and medium bodied nice beer"
"Drinkability: Not being an IPA person, I do like this beer and would feel comfortable drinking three in a sitting. It is bitter, but not too bitter..a good beer"
"Great Job!"
"Huge floral hops upon first sip. Pine, vanilla and ruby red grapefruit. Interesting to say the least. It goes down very smooth for a DIPA... very creamy mouthfeel. No problem polishing a few of these off in a sitting."
"D- Between the incredible mouthfeel and perfect balance in the flavor, this is one beer I could drink quite a few of. Look out though, at 9% you can't get carried away!"
"Pours a bit of hazy orange. Head is a creamy tan that sticks copiously. Nose is a bit musty, with a grainy, slightly piney backdrop. Not sure exactly what simcoe hops are supposed to be like, but there's nothing here I identify as a big, fresh hoppiness. First taste is definitely a mouthful of hops - sharp, intense bitterness is almost spicy with vanilla and woodiness. Again not a fresh c-hop, but more of a deeper, more complex hoppiness. Balancing malt is also quite heavy giving an overall sense of a rich, decadent brew. Light carbonation and creamy body."
"I really dig this. Along with the Moonglow Weizenbock, the best Weyerbacher I've had."
"Would have this one again since I can't get that many decent DIPAs here."
"So this is a super hoppy beer. Its like walking thru a forest.. and eating all the trees. Pours a dark amber and produces a foamy head that is very, very nice. All aroma is a hop bomb- super citrusy and floral, very lemony- just crazy hop presence. Fklavor is also extremely hoppy. Tons of tons of hop with just a bit of malt presence just beneath the hop to provide a bit of balance. Mouth is moderate, hoppiness leaves a lasting floral impression. Very crisp and clean feeling. Overall its very intense with the hop character. I'm not typically a hop fan and I enjoyed it quite a bit."
"Mouthfeel, man, this thing dials up the bitter region taste buds in the back of your mouth like a boxer doing a speed bag. Highly drinkable, I wish I had more than a single bottle of this. Hesitant to trade for it because of the sitting on store shelves/freshness factor, but this is an outstanding beer and a real treat for Pennsylvanians. Thanks to DRINKNDRIVE for the extra."
"I'm not a big fan of Weyerbacher in general but this is far and away my favorite beer of theirs. Really outstanding. Can't say much more than that."
"4.0 D: Simply delicious. A good beer to drink anytime."
"Overall, no balance in this beer whatsoever and that doesn't bother me. The part that bothers me is that if the beer is going to be one-sided relying on the hops profile, it should be done in way that allows for some taste. There is no taste to this beer whatsoever. All you get is a strong, bitter burn that kills every taste bud you have."
"D: A great drinking 2x ipa but better left for the serious. The casual pale and ipa drinker will be in for a hop shock in this one. The more you drink the more you tongue becomes numb to the initial shock and goes down much easier. Would recommend finishing the night with this one not to destroy you palate for other beers that may follow."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a hazy orange with a very nice white head. The head had excellent staying power and left a copious amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is intense pine potpouri, it hits you as soon as the cap is popped. The flavor is very heavy pine with mild citrus in it. The finish is long lingering and slightly bitter. The mouthfeel is very full and is sticky. The beer is a bit of a sipper, even by DIPA standards. One of the best DIPA's I have ever had."
"Very drinkable beer I wish this was available closer to home"
"Initial pour presents an amber hued outstanding looking double IPA. It also produces an off-white, impressive head that quickly dissipates to a thin lace that sticks to the glass brilliantly as I drink. Both the aroma and taste are very citrusy and piney. The taste is very strong hops with a malty backround. I've never had sicmoe hops before this one but it will certainly keep my interest. My 1st weyerbacher and it was a pleasent experience. I'll try some more by them."
" Palate is a sharp dose of spicy, piney Simcoe hops up front. The malt body emerges mid-palate to temper the hop onslaught just a bit, but recedes just as quickly, yielding a lasting spicy bitterness on the finish. Body is full and a touch foamy, but not too sticky. Strong and assertive, this is definitely a beer to take your time with, but I feel like I could drink a couple of these in a (very enjoyable) evening."
"This one pours out a redish orange color with a nice sized, thick off white head that fades at a slower pace and almost coated the glass with lacing. the smell is not as hoppy as i was expecting. it's hoppy alright, but there's also some pine and citrus with a touch of malts. The taste is delicious with loads of hops and a bit of citrus with malts. not too bitter, but not too sweet it's like little red with her porridge. The Mouthfeel is great with decent carbonation and a medium / thicker beer. It's amazing how well the 9% is hidden behind this one. Thanks to Zapata for this amazing beer!"
"Pours a nice cloudy copper orange color with an incredible off white frothy head that leaves some amazing sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma comes out of the gates with a strong hit of hops, a little citrus and a little pine. Nothing to crazy. The taste is delicious. Has the perfect bitterness that a beer should have. Strong hop taste to it with a little malt, citrus and pine afternotes. The mouthfeel is great. Medium to strong bodied ale and at 9% you wouldnt know it. Excllent drinkability, though it wouldnt take many of these bad boys. Must try for any hop enthusiast."
"I don't have a lot of experience iwth Simcoe hps so I wanted to pick this up to see what it's like. Pours a hazy darke orange.. like Orange Pekoe tea. Nice thin but sturdy head that just leaves an impenetrable blanket of lacing on the sides of the glass. Looks like an APA to me. Aroma is sweet yet grassy, like smelling Swedish fish. Taste is a little too bitter for my tastes, but it certainly is an IPA. Very long lingering bitterness on the tongue with some slight breadyness to both the hops and the malt. Pretty well balanced in terms of hop/malt flavor but the bitterness is quite prevalent. Mouthfeel is medium which doesn't complement the hops IMO. I'm usually against very thin IPAs but in this case I don't think it serves such a strong bittering character. This is a bitterness bomb and I'll be sipping this one for a while."
"Overall - Awesome. One of the best IPA's I've ever had."
"Overall-an interesting brew but not only that I really enjoyed, I found it rash and unbalanced, and I consider myself a hophead."
"We are from San Diego (Ipa capital of the world) and just tried this beer and we loved it. It has a great hop aroma of citrus. The mouthfeel is just right. The hops do not overpower the beer. Nice malty character without being to sweet. The finish is clean and drinkable. Glad to find a good Double IPA on the east coast"
"As most DIPA's are, this looks deep, rich and viscous. mmmm. The smell is much less hoppy than expected and what I think that means is that this beer will be more balanced than alot of hophead doubles tend to be. Tastes is very malty and just hoppy enough. Normally this would be disappointing. I wanted to be overloaded with Simcoe hoppiness but the balnce, the full creamy mouthfeel and the utter Drinkability of this DIPA overwhelm me. This may be my favorite of the style so far. I've already tried 90 min,moylans hosickle,ruination and devil dancer and this is by far the most drinkable without sacrificing any flavor."
"D: I think I might have gotten a slightly older bottle. This thing is a monster fresh. While this is good I know it can be better. Will have to revisit some time in the future. If you can get it on tap do your self a favor and grab a pint."
"(rated Sep 5, 2007)"
"Similar to Dogfish Head 90 minute, but a bit better."
"D: Overall, this is a drinkable beer with a lot of character and a huge taste."
"D- I could kick back with a few of these especially during the warm summer months."
"Overall: solid, proud offering"
"M&D - Oh, so drinkable....I love this bottle. While it might seem middle of the road, I find this one to have special attributes, with both nice mouthfeel and flavors."
"The beer is medium bodied and the mouth feel is sticky with excellent carbonation. Double Simcoe is a palate wrecker on tap but I love every sip. I count myself lucky to have had this on tap."
"I had this for the first time a couple weekends ago and was thrilled with what I found. Yeah, it's got hops qualities in spades because it's an IPA, but wow was it wonderful. Beautiful amber/orange color, medium body, crazy citrus aroma. I don't know if I'm imagining things or not, but I even thought it had a little spiciness to it - maybe from that intense citrus nose/ hop flavor."
"Somewhat of a sipper, but relatively easy to drink nonetheless. A great DIPA to try to become better acquainted with simcoe hops. Recommended."
"This would be on my rotating """drink this""" list if I could find it around me."
"Wow. Hops like I have not experienced before. A great fragrance. Makes me want to brew just to smell the fresh hops. You get the feeling that the hops were added 5 minutes ago. A deep sip reveals fruity and piny overtones with a dark undercurrent of palatable bitterness. This beer exceeded my expectations and is my choice over their Hops Infusion. A tounge splitter indeed, but 2 or 3 are not out of the question for a mini-session. Lingering hop finish which tingles the 'buds."
"I love this beer. Aroma was very good. Strong resiny and piney hops with nothing else getting in the way. Pour was a nice deep cloudy orange with a one finger off white head. Taste was all pine, resin and a hint of grapefruit with no malt and a bitter thick citrus finish. The nice carbonation keeps this a very drinkable and delicious IIPA."
"Nice lingering hoppy bitterness."
"Reviewed on 4/5/08. Bottle. Pours a cloudy dark orange with a large white, creamy head. Aroma and taste of primarily piney hops, some citrus and grapefruit notes. A very drinkable beer. I liked that it was bitter but didn't leave the bitter after-taste that other beers to do. Double IPA is not my favorite style, but I really liked this beer! 8/4/8/4/15 (3.9/5)"
"Mf- very enjoyable, a lil bit of acidity but enjoyable beer. it was like chewing a Simcoe Hop."
"Drinkability- For as alcoholic as the beer is, it goes down very smooth making it very drinkable and a wise decision from Weyerbacher to change it from these big bottles into four packs."
"Simply a great showcase for the Simcoe hop. It's just a step below some of the greats, due in part to its rawness, but that's also a good deal of the charm of the hop."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat heavy and smooth."
"D- A sipper it's ok just not loving it."
"One day old growler filled directly from the brewery. Amber color with clinging full head. lacing up and down the glass. smell is all citrus - mostly grapefruit with slight notes of pine. Taste is a bit sweet up front with a punch of grapefruit right at the end to balance out. Just enough carbonation to pull the residual sweetness of the tongue to leave a pleasant bitterness. An exceptionally dangerous brew considering it's alcohol content. Damn, I love that punch of hops. Growler was $16 + the glass for a total of $19."
"Drinkability is okay. It is and extremely bitter beer, not quite balanced but still interesting. This would be a great beer to have as an aperitif."
"Over the time I have been appreciating better beers, I ran into this little guy. I have been searching for a beer that will knock me off my feet with a sip. The aroma straight from the bottle (thats how I like it) is very strong of hops and piney and a little spicy. I took a sip and the beginning of the taste was decent, it was piney, hoppy and when the beer hit the back of my tongue it hit something that other beers haven't. I decided I couldn't just drink this one down and go for the next, I decided to drink it by little sips to keep getting that strange feeling. It was one of the harshest (in a good way) beers I have ever had. I gave it a 3.5 on the drinkability because its more the taste that drives this one, not the fact that it is beer to drink down, its meant to be savored. Overall... I love it."
"M/D - Nice carbonation and very drinkable. The higher abv. prevents me from having alot, but not from lack of want. This is a definite keeper in my fridge."
"Drinkability: If you are a hop head, this is a pretty good beer. The simcoe hops definitely dominate this beer. Not my favorite double IPA of all time, but still pretty tasty. Good job Weyerbacher."
"12oz bottle thanks to abcfan. Pours cloudy amber with small white head. Aroma is hops, earthy notes, citrus and pine. Flavor is hoppy but earthy. Good hop bitterness with citrus and pine. Finishes bitter with a little soapyness. Mouthfeel is medium but could use some more carbonation. A different take on a IIPA with all the earthy flavors. Not my favorite but enjoyable none the less."
"Overall: This one is a hop bomb, make no mistake. The nose and to a lesser extent the taste is reminiscent of the excellent DFH 90. However, unlike the 90, there's no real malt balance. It's all about the hops, and for that reason, I can't score it as high as some have. Still, a solid brew and a must-have for any hop head."
"Thanks aubuc1! I'm glad I made the trade."
"Simcoe double ipa rocks! It has a rich amber color, it's foggy, has a light carbonation, has a light head with a faint greenish hue. The taste it nice and hoppy. The citrus and piny notes really come through. Mouthfeel is good, not too heavy and too thick. Drinkability is very easy and pleasing. This beer makes me happy."
"This is the most delicious double IPA I have ever had. Lots of that great bitter grapefruit flavor that I love from this style, along with a bit of pepperiness and strong alcohol warmth. Very upfront with its hop flavor, holds nothing back. All of from one kind of hop too. Went great with some extra sharp cheddar cheese. Weyerbacher makes a lot great BIG beers like this. Check them out."
"Bottle thanks to hopscotch. Pours a deep amber color with a large white head and lots of lacing. The aroma is great; loads of sweet pine and citrus hops.The flavor was also great; initially this is quite a hop bomb. The simcoe hope are very full and ripe, like biting a handful or fresh hops. There is also a strong caramel malt that adds balance. Perhaps my favorite aspect is the full and very creamy mouthfeel. Just delicious. If we could get this in Utah I'd be a happy man. I'm proud of my home state for producing such great beer."
"Pretty tasty stuff but I think I prefer Simcoe mixed with other hops than by itself. Definitely a solid DIPA though and worth a try."
"bitter aftertaste but overall drinkability is stellar!"
"Drinkability: Delicious."
"all in all its solid ipa. drinkable and refreshing on this hot ass october day...never thought i would be saying that. yeesh. well onto the next brew"
"This is a beer made for hop heads. If you're looking for a nicely balanced IPA...this aint it. Thank god for that. Sure to satisfy all hop heads. Seek it out."
"Im pleasantly impressed with this beer, there may be IIPAs that are more drinkable than this one, but only because of a more timid approach was taken. The 9% abv is very well hidden, and only reveals itself with a touch of alcohol warmth. Despite the solid malt backbone, this is one best reserved for the hop heads as its resinous stripping quality only continues to reveal itself over time. Highly recommended, especially for fans of Simcoe hops."
"Cheers."
"Overall a great beer that is even better on tap than bottle.  The heavy malt sweetness coupled with the huge hops make it very balanced and enjoyable but in limited doses."
"The beer poured a slightly cloudy, brownish-amber with a thin, white head into a chalice. The aroma was a very noticable, fresh, piney hop bouquet. The taste was a veritable hops explosion, starting with big hop flavor and malt sweetness and finishing with an intensely bitter hop bite. A fantastically hoppy DIPA (gotta love the Simcoe hops), with good carbonation and lacing to match."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a cloudy light amber color with moderate bubbly head. Leaves lots of lacing. Real hoppy aroma with some pine and citrus scents. The alcohol is noticable in the smell. Medium to full body mouthfeel. Leaves some stickiness and the carbonation is noticable. Tastes very hoppy...there is no mistaking this is a DIPA. Hops dominate the taste, but citrus and pine come through once the hops settle down. A nice bitter aftertaste follows. An enjoyable beer and very drinkable, but I have yet to find a DIPA I didn't like."
"I would rate this as a pretty drinkable beer. An all around solid IPA with all the characteristics I would expect from this variety."
"This is a very drinkable DIPA and an excellent beer. It's easy to overlook the alcohol, though, so drink Double Simcoe in moderation."
"Drinkability: moderate to high for the style and ABV thanks to the carbonation."
"D: I think that this is a very good beer, very bold, very straight forward and in your face. But because of this the beer remains a bit one dimensional, I feel as though I have already had this beer, enjoyed it and forgot about it. Not to take anything away from a good beer, but after a number of different beers of this style it becomes a bit harder for beers like this to stand out for me."
"Pours a copper amber body with a frothy off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is moderately sweet with pineapple, grapefruit, peach and a hint of caramel. Flavor is sweet pineapple, grapefruit, herbal, peach, caramel, some chocolate and a bit of alcohol. Chewy texture, medium-full body. This is beer heaven to me."
"Wow! What a beer. Pours a dark amber in color with a nice frothy head. There is a fan-freaking-tastic hop aroma. The higher alcohol content balances well with the crazy IBU level. A great representation of the Double IPA style. Overall, great beer!"
"I first tried this beer in a variety case of BIG BEERS from Weyerbacher Brewing Co. and instantly feel in love with it. I poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. There was a nice half inch thick head that slowly dissolved over time. The color was an orange-amber and crystal clear. The aroma was full of sweet and bitter hops, along with citrus notes. The taste was succulent, full of hops, both bitter and semi-sweet. There was a pleasant aftertaste that lingered over the course of the beer. I would recommend this beer to any self described hop head out there who wants to try a kick ass IPA."
"D - wow! This is so bitter and so good. Would gladly drink more, and plan to in the future. A solid IIPA, i had this from the bottle a few times before this, but so much better on tap, i think i can still taste the hops from yesterday"
"Decent for a DIPA, try it if you like hops and bitterness."
"D ~ For me ~ this is NOT a session beer. This is a BIG, STRONG Double with an assertive alcohol presence that limits the drinkability & pretty much peels your tastes buds back for a look. One was nice....& gladly at the END of my night. Two is not an option (for me). This was a regional extra sent by BeerTruth & I'm glad I had a chance to fire one up."
"This is a pretty solid IPA. Thanks to the generous trader La Roja for the sample."
"D: Really tasty, but two of these would be too many in a single session for me. I'll keep this one as a treat and not try to session it."
"It poors a nice dark apricot/orange color. Thick cream colored head that left some noce lace. The nose is tropical citrus followed by trropical citrus and topped with tropical citrus. Taste has a very sweet pale malt profile with lots of tropical citrus as in the nose, mainly red grapefruit and pineapple. I also taste some pine and orange. The mouth feel is very thick almost chunky and sticky rather than thick. I personly don't mind it but it does detract from the overall drinkability."
"Hops, Hops, Hops. Pleasant, lingering bitterness. It's what we search for. Though the 9% ABV prohibits excess."
"D- a must try for any hop lover. something i could have a couple of before wanting to switch."
"v: oz1 al3 3.3"
"Pours a deep amber with a decent white head. Leaves a nice lacing on the glass. The smell is hoppy and full of citrus. The taste is very hoppy along with citrus and alcohol. A bit harsh. There is some bite in the lasting aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and slick. Drinkability is OK but limited due to the high ABV and bite in the taste. Overall, this is a nice DIPA but not the best I've had."
"Impressive. Pours an amber/brown color with a thick off-white head and by the time I was finished there was lacing all over the glass. Big grapefruit and piney hoppy flavors and a bit of green leaf. Nice crisp hop bitterness. Finishes tart and a little dry. Real solid malt base that thickens this thing up but doesn't over-do it. Very nice and I can definitely see myself drinking this one often."
"D: This beer is good. Really good. Has some serious complexity for something that sounds very simple. It is a bit heavy on ABV so too many can cause some problems. This stuff is crazy good. Want more please."
"Drink - Definitely a great IIPA, but intense indeed."
"M + D: Thick, oily, and a little bit sticky. Makes for a great coating over the tongue and a long lasting flavour finish. Decently drinkable, though best suited for sipping. A nice beer, and I'd look forward to having it again."
"The taste is fabulous. Not bitter at all, just smooth Simcoe hoppiness. There's a lot of grapefruit in it, especially the aftertaste. I'll have the taste of grapefruit in my mouth for an hour. Very enjoyable. I could drink a lot of this... and I do."
"carbonated mouthfeel, kinda thick, little zing from the 9% abv, goes down easy, great beer."
"Not exactly a breakfast beer, unless you like a punch in the mouth."
"Pretty damn good beer."
"A hops-thick brew, no doubt, but balanced enough to be an enjoyable hob bomb."
"HV"
"This is a great beer, definitely one any hophead should check out. Cheers for the Simcoe!"
"Overall it's definitely worth a shot. It's a bit expensive, but split it with someone if you have to."
"Sticky mouthfeel leaves that gorgeous hop flavor in your mouth for quite some time. I think one of these will do for now, though..."
"D. As drinkable as a 9% double can be. A nice DIPA. A lingering hop bitterness prolongs the magic."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied and a little chewy in the mouth. Very drinkable by DIPA standards but the somewhat funky taste after the hops lingers too long and knocks a little off the drinkability."
"Holy grapefruit! Poured hazy copper with a thick three finger beige frothy head, which left a great amount of lace behind. Upfront, the aroma is obvious (grapeffruit). I also get some pine, sweet toffee and biscuit. The body feels medium to full, oily, and subtly carbonated. Once again, the same applies with the taste, grapefruit. Slightly sweet but hippen quickly with a blast a citrus bitter. Overall, I felt this brew was not well balanced. I love the mega hops, however I was looking for more malt sweetness to balance. I enjoyed this brew with scamble eggs, ham and brie cheese on a Belgian waffle with maple syrup. Enjoy"
"If you haven't tried it, you're missing out."
"22oz. bomber: This one pours a hazy orangish-amber color. There was a bit of a frothy tan head on it that dropped off somewhat quickly. It left some lacing. Both the citrus and pine hops are quite obvious to the nose, yet they seem to be balanced nicely. The pine and citrus notes of the hops are evident in the taste, and are well balanced also. Potent but not over the top. Actually a hint of malt sweetness in the finish. This one is pretty well done!"
"T/M/D - very sharp hoppy taste, with a woody flavor (is wood a flavor!?) and a bit of a zesty, citrusy aftertaste. The alcohol flavor blends nicely but is apparent. This one is too big to session, but is quite a treat."
"Pours a cloudy, hazed golden orange with a white, creamy, tightly packed head. As the head falls, wall paper sheets of lace across the glass. Smell is hops. Hop resin, peppery mint, lemon zest, meaty citrus notes with hints of fresh baked bread. This is one hop forward smelling beer! Taste is surprisingly more balanced than the nose, however, that is not saying much. The flavor begins with fresh bran muffin and as the beer moves across the tongue, the hops begin to shine. White pepper lemon zest, pine resin, grapefruit juice, pure bitterness. The finish is incredibly dry and the following breath is full of bitterness again. The alcohol isn't showcased much, perhaps hidden behind the bitterness. Highly enjoyable DIPA! Wait, this is an East Coast DIPA? This could surely rival those San Diego boys."
"D: Highly drinkable except for the lingering bitterness somewhat, not to mention the high abv. Its great tasting but one is probably enough per sitting."
"Overall, a hophead's dream. I think for me the simcoe hop is not my favorite, but this is still a very nice brew."
"D-I could barely get through a bottle and I'll give away my other one. I'm becoming a hophead but this is over the top."
"The drink had a huge, huge frothy head with the standard dark, murky golden-amber of a double IPA. Aromas were surprisingly gentle for what I was expecting. Hops, herbs, spices, malts; perhaps its the Simcoe hops that are used because this is pretty light for an imperial IPA. Not so overpowering bitterness, which is good. Malty, hoppy bitter flavoring wrapped around slightly grassy, floral textures. Good mouthfeel makes this beer have good crispness but also a slight creaminess from its heavy hops. Overall, not a bad imperial IPA."
"Double Simcoe IPA pours a hazy orange with a thick off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is quite hoppy. Piney and citrus hop flavors dominate, there is a slight metallic taste when the beer is a bit on the too cold side. The taste is pretty good for a double ipa, bordering on excellent, but it just isn't the best I've had. The mouthfeel is a bit thick, but not inappropriate. Worth a try for sure."
"Poured this amazing beer into a pint glass. This beer was very impressive looking from the pour to the actual lace it left on the glass, this was some serious lace and the chopper color was also amazing. The smell has a very sweet nose of butterscotch, pine and earth and a bit sweet honey. The taste was very hoppy and to the point I can taste the sweet backbone with a nice very bitter hop finish that stayed on my palate for quite some time, this was one of the best DIPA I have had in quite some time. Overall this was an amazing offering very fresh and very hoppy just how they are supposed to taste, it went down very smooth and quickly."
"I will certainly seek this out in the future when I'm craving this style of brew. Brilliant!"
"Mouthfeel is thick and carbonation is mellow. An enjoyable double IPA, but just one will do me. My taste buds need to recover."
"Most of these ﬂavors courtesy of a single hop? Outstanding. We sampled from the second brewing of this beer, and Weyerbacher just announced that this will be a year-round offering. Awesome."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a deep amber color with a strong head. Smell is earthy, piney, with a strong grapefruit presence. Taste is very pronounced... punches you right in the face on the first sip. Very well balanced... alot of hops up front followed by the malt. Good amount of carbonation. Great brew from Weyerbacher."
"Serving type: bottle 12oz."
"Clear, orange-amber body and a head crowning above the rime greeted me after poring out the newly arrived Double Simcoe into a pint glass. The smell was clean and piney and had spicy undertones and a peach backing. The taste was bitingly bitter with an immediate puckering reaction, which to me is just what a double IPA should induce. There was a lot of pine in every sip. The malts were toasty and nutty, but stood no chance against the hop onslaught. The hop burn in this beer lasted from start to finish and beyond. Just what a double IPA should be. I'll need to horde more of this."
"D - I probably won't be coming back to this one when I want a decent DIPA. A bland and mediocre example of the style."
"D: Definitely 22 oz. is enough. Really feel the 9%. Absolutely delicious beer, but the alcohol content feels higher than 9%."
"This is one to imbibe in. Take in all there is to enjoy in a couple of Simcoes and relax."
"D - wow! This is so bitter and so good. Would gladly drink more, and plan to in the future. A solid IIPA and certainly a Simcoe showcase. Check it out!"
"D: Very drinkable. I am glad Weyerbacher has arrived in Florida. This will be one of my staples from now on, but at $6.25 a pint I can't have too many."
"Finishes sweet, smooth, and bitter."
"This is a really good DIPA. I like the use of only Simcoe hops. I also love that they are right up front in telling you what kind of hops are used. I got a 4-pack of this on vacation and gave two of them away. Now I want them back."
"D: A very drinkable beer. Excellent combination of mouthfeel and taste. Cannot taste the alcohol, but can feel it as you drink the beer. Definitely an excellent beer and highly recommended if you can get it."
"I could drink the hell out of this thing, which probably isn't a good idea given he alcohol content. Just make sure to pour it slowly, or you'll have more yeast than with a 'hefe... and the next morning won't be so fun."
"M&D: Creamy, full body beer, light on the carbonation but not too light. Very drinkable @ 9%. I would say this falls a little more into the German DIPA category,(similer to Bell's Hopsolution). This is my first experience with Weyerbacher, and I will have to say that if their other selections are as tasty as this one, I will become a fan. Skal."
"D: Loads of hops smoothed exceptionally with what must have been a ton of pale malt. I enjoyed this beer and it lives up the hype. Drinks awfully easily for 9% ABV -- no wonder they only sell it in 4-packs -- probably a directive of their legal team."
"12oz bottle poured into a large Duvel tulip glass. Pours a dark amber color with a solid off-white head that leaves and impressive amount of lacing around the glass. The aroma is sweet malt and a very nice dose of piny hops with some citrus as well. The taste starts off with smooth and sweet malt for a split second before the hops come in and blast the taste buds with a puckering bitterness. Overall, this is a very nice Double IPA that is a hop bomb that will surely crave any hop fix and completely ruin your palate. Definitely recommended to any and all hop heads out there."
"I can see how hop-heads (like myself) would approve of this brew. Casual beer drinkers might find the hops too intense."
"Great full mouthfeel, chewy, rich, robust and delicious. There is a nice kick from the bitterness and alcohol yet there is still an excellent smoothness while drinking this one. Drinkability is about as high as you could expect a DIPA this full of flavor and body to be. Certainly couldn't sit and drink bottle after bottle after bottle of this stuff. But within the style, this is a really highly consumable beer. I love it."
"Drinkability - Delicious yet certainly not a guzzler in my estimation. 9% makes this perfect for an extended sip and I'd gladly take this on a damp fall day or blustery winter."
"Drinkability: So far, this is my favorite Weyerbacher beer! The taste of this beer was very hoppy, interesting, and of course excellent! I would drink this beer again at a drop of a hat. If you try only one beer from Weyerbacher, make it """Double Simcoe IPA.""""
"Overall a nice sipper , although I'm chugging this one down after mowing the lawn."
"Pours a deep amber color with generous foamy head which recedes slowly to a full surface film and clingy lace. The aroma and taste are a hop head's dream. This is def one of the most aromatic brews I have ever sampled, a very complex mix of pine, citrus and a unique hint of fresh flowers (maybe that's just me, haha). The taste is bold hops, and since it is straight simcoe rather than a blend of hop varieties, the flavor is very clean. You revisit the pine and citrus here, with a touch of sugary sweetness. This brew coats your mouth with the flavors and tings the back of the throat with the hoppy bitterness. The only reason I didn't give this a higher drinkability rating is because the aroma and taste is so bold, none but the hoppiest hop heads would session this, but it is a DIPA that has to be tried. I will certainly have it again and again whenever I can, another home run from Weyerbacher."
"Drinkability - A very solid double IPA. Has everything that you want and need if your ever in the mood for a serious hoppy beer. Another great IPA to add to the list!"
"Drinkability - Nice beer to grab when you need your hop fix. Hoppy and syrupy make it a sipper and keeps the drinkability a little lower. Good Double IPA to punish your palate from time to time."
"This was damn good! I was disappointed in their Barley Wine (way too sweet and thin, IMO) so my hopes weren't that high for this one. Nice, typical IPA appearance, but the aroma and flavor leap out! Lots of citrus hops, good body. Very creamy and smooth. I'll have to try it again to rate it in the upper echelon, but I'm currently drinking a Hopslam, and the Simcoe holds it's own. Don't miss it if you get a chance. Thanks Deepak!"
" The only problem is the price. Now it's about $3 per bottle, same as the Bell's Hopslam, but probably a little better if that is possible. The Brothers really need to try this one, don't you think?"
"D: I love hops, usually more than the next guy, but this one was too much for me. I couldn't get past the biterness. It is an Imperial so it is not out of character."
"pours a copper/golden amber... looks like oolong tea. smells of pine and pineapple-citrus. perfectly bubbly with constant bubbles at the surface. tastes strongly of white grapefruit with certain piney notes. thick and syrupy and extremely bitter. the bitterness hits you about halfway through and stays in your mouth for quite a while. perfect for true hop-heads! while the bottles are pricey, they are certainly worth it. take your time and really enjoy this one. but, you won't taste much of anything else after you finish it, your tastebuds will be down for the count, if not the rest of you!"
"YUM!"
"thick and rich, it is full of flavor, but it is well balanced, not too strong on the hops. seems almost sweet at first. the 9% warms the throat. finishes with a nice hoppy bite."
"Overall, in one word, BIG! I think i could taste simcoe hops in any beer no matter how many different varieties are used. I haven't had many Weyerbacher beers but I'm on board. However, I dont think its worth the $12+ it cost for a 4 pack. But still a very nice big IPA."
"Poured a orangish gold with an outstanding two-finger head that stuck around for a while. Great hop presence in the nose, and the scent is also marked with sticky malts and fruit (I picked up cherries for some reason). The hops are there, immensly, with a good, dry bitterness to them that sticks to the palate and leaves a semi-sweet fruit taste combo'ed with a good dry backbite. Smooth, medium to full bodied w/ the alcohol covered up nicely - only the ABV keeps this from being a session beer but I recommend any DIPA fan to try this one at least once."
"This one is easy to like for hop fans. Worth your ducats."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a nonic. Nice deep golden amber color that forms a one inch light brown head that leaves a lacing on top of the beer. The aroma is quite strong with pine notes and citrus with some spice and malt kicking down the door at the end. The taste is an explosion of hops. If you like hops this is for you it, as the beer starts with a lot of citrus and grapefruit taste. As the hops are done wacking the palate the malt sweetness comes through and balances the beer. The aftertaste leaves a nice toned down bitterness. The mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and creamy that leaves an light oily coating on the tongue. Easy to drink as the beer does not have a real strong bitter aftertaste to it. Great beer."
"Wow, I've got to give Weyerbacher credit on this one, as this is one beer that lets it all hang out. Huge bitterness and a beefy feel that sometimes seems bigger than its 9% ABV, yet still stays fairly smooth and approachable. This is a nice one for when you feel like throwing down something that just might throw you back!"
"Very big, bold flavor. Surprisingly springy and brightly flavored, considering the oily, viscous mouthfeel. Plenty of toasted, caramel malt sweetness, tempering the hop bitterness thoroughly. Could be a little more on the bitter side, actually. Nice fruity esters, citrus in a Lemonheads candy kind of way. A bit of mango and sweet tangerine. Lots of oily hop flavor in the finish, providing a balanced bitterness to the heavy, underlying malt sweetness. Just enough carbonation to keep the huge body moving across the palate. Just a hint of an alcohol bite in the finish, lingering with a piney hop aftertaste. Mmmmm....simcoe."
"D: I really like this IPA and the sweetness that you don't necessarily see in some DIPAs. It's pretty big but definitely drinkable."
"A great IPA and I'm looking forward to trying more of Weyerbacher's brews."
"Overall a superb example of this style. This is a must have!"
"A creamy inch and a half tan head pours right out of the bottle settling on top of a brownish orange colored murky body. Nose is full of sweet grassy hops with a hint of pine and sappy malt. Enters the mouth with big musky pine based hop feel. Citrus rind flavor reminds me of chewing on orange peel. A bit of dark mineral based malt is there twords the end of the palate, it includes a dry nuttiness that develops on the end also. Leaves the mouth with a very dry bitterness that lasts long on the mouthfeel, which is very thick. Big bitterness that is moderatly drinkable."
"So have this around as a showpiece for friends, or to satisfy the occasional urge for hop overkill, but I think it's overall drinkability suffers from its massive character. Its a heavily-armored battle tank of beer - devastating and much to be respected, but sometimes you just need a jeep to get around."
"Slick, oily feel in the mouth. This is exactly what I would expect from a double IPA, and it kicks your ass to boot, so be careful. Helluva brew!"
"This is a very good double ipa, love it, and is one to come back to often if possible"
"Drinkability is pretty good, a tasty DIPA, although the malt and booze are starting to come to the fore, and are a bit heavy handed. Washed down some pasty nicely, this is a good, solid DIPA, I'm glad I got the chance to finally review it, thanks again Ben!"
"Fairly drinkable, but the taste buds could potentially get overwhelmed."
"This is great freaking beer. I only have one more. Time to hit the trading boards."
"This is something to finish the evening off with slowly - very enjoyable but the obliteration of the taste buds from overabundance makes this a once-in-a-while indulgence - a victim of its own success/excess! Enjoy."
"Good for the style. This isn't a style your going to be clinging to for hours on end, and this one treats you right from beginning to end."
"D - Despite it's odd texture this is a tasty hop bomb, and certainy one worth trying. Not my favorite double, but an impressive brew nonetheless."
"This is a very good beer; I would highly recommend it. SurlySober, Flyer and I split this, New Holland Night Tripper, Ten Fidy, and some Central Waters Coffee Stout, all of which were quite good."
"Body is medium and very carbonated. Amazingly drinkable. This one is up there with the Maharaja from Avery and the 10th Anniversary from Stone."
"Mouthfeel is right at medium with the carbonation lending a helping hand towards creating a smooth feel. Drinkability is somewhat hampered by the alcohol finish noted above. This said its still one hell of a brew, but I wouldn't see myself reaching for a second."
"D - The beer guy at a local bar once remarked that he could drink the **** out of this beer. He's absolutely right. Nine percent? I can't tell. I guess I'm happy that recent price increases will keep me from drinking one of these at one sitting."
"If you like IPA's give this one a try."
"Not bad, but not great, and this is my favorite style. I like bitterness, but even I found some of the astringencies in this beer a little much, and the prickly alcohol wasn't hidden well at all - HopSlam this is not. That being said, there is a lot of good stuff going on in this beer, and with some slight schedule-altering it could be outstanding."
"Smooth almost creamy feeling, medium body. Pretty drinkable for a 9% DIPA, but still big bitterness from the high alphas."
"This DIPA definitely packs a punch. I would have liked a bit more balance in this brew, but it was impressive nevertheless."
"D - This is a huge beer, but very well-balanced and definitely hoppy! Extremely flavorful brew. Can't drink too many of these in one sitting, though. One was enough for me on this particular night."
"Pours cloudy caramel to maroon colored. Medium lasting beige head. Looks nice. Smell is mildly hoppy but mild for what I expected. Tea and caramel aside from the simcoe hops. Taste is simcoe hops obviously which are musty, dirty, earthy and I can see why they describe simcoe as smelling like cat piss. Alcohol is evident as in every Weyerbacher beer. Apparently they have a hard time hiding the alcohol in their beers... There is nothing citrusy or grapefruity about this beer. It's the polar opposite of a citrusy, clean beer, as the commercial description states. Decent, but not my favorite."
"taste: a really good overall taste. quite thick and covers the mouth well. super hop all around, hits hard right in the middle of the tongue."
"Medium body, a bit thicker than I remembered...also little to no carbonation, less than I remembered. The sweet thickness makes me slow down on drinking this one, but it does hide the 9% abv well."
"The drink is smooth and medium-bodied with quite a bit of alcohol drying that leaves the finish very clean. The carbonation is good and the beer quite drinkable despite the pungency and potent ABV."
"After tasting Bison Brewing's all simcoe IPA, I swore off simcoe. This beer makes me realize it wasn't the hop varietal's fault. I'm sorry I ever doubted thee simcoe!"
"I finally got to try this one. It poured a clear copper color with off-white head. It smelled very strongly of pine and copper hops, but not much else. Its flavor was a tantalizing blend of orange citrus, pine, and copper hops, all mixed together with a some malt for a bit of balance. It was thick with some carbonation, and it had a very strong, very bitter, lasting aftertaste. Overall this was one of the best double IPAs ever...super hoppy and delicious."
"You have to be willing to breathe hops if you want to enjoy a few, but worth it for those that are into that- including myself."
"pours a hazy amber with no sediment. almost tan head is persistent and creamy with really good lacing. nose is caramel and toffee with resiney, earthy hops. nice but lacks the bright citric fruity freshness i personally look in an american ipa/dipa. simcoe aromas are tough to put my finger on. taste has a medium, sticky toffee malt sweetness balanced by a medium, smooth bitterness. rich, viscous mouthfeel with creamy carbonation."
"Drinkability is okay. Great hop dose of flavor, making it a go-to hop fix, but less outstanding in other characteristics. I really like it overall."
"This beer poured a medium reddish amber color and formed a small foamy white head that left trace lace as it subsided. An aroma of hops, malt and citrus with a hint of pine. The flavor was heavy of hops with grapefruit and citrus. Malt and some caramel. The body was medium light and somewhat astrigent yet bitter finish. A nice beer."
"Decent drinkability for a double 9% ABV."
"Cheers!"
"Bottle at Winking Lizard. The beer is a slightly cloudy copper color with a medium off-white head that has decent retention. Thin rings of lacing. Nice citrusy hops aroma with notes of toasted grain and pine. Medium-bodied with a pleasant floral hops character. Flavors of malt, tart berries and spices are present as well. The finish is dry and hoppy and leaves a balanced sweetness and bitterness behind. Overall this is a very enjoyable IIPA."
"What a great Double IPA. Goes down easy. I would love to drink these all night but probably shouldn't try with the 9% alcohol."
"Very drinkable! I could easily see this becoming a regular in the beer fridge."
"d: Wish I had more. Just can't get enough of that hoppy goodness. A delightful DIPA."
"D- good D but its so damn bitter! this is a hop lovers paradise."
"Its profound amount of alcohol accompanies the beer relatively well, but it may be a bit too wild for its own good, making an otherwise good beer a bit too aggressive."
"Pours a nice looking two fingers of off white head that quickly dissolves down to a fine film over the sort of opaque amber beer. Nose is great - starts off with piney hops then rolls into an almsot bisquity caramel. Later on its cookies, straight up, with a sort of odd hoppy backdrop and maybe a touch of astringency. Flavor is off-the-charts piney, almost evergreen hops (I guess those are the simcore hops?). Sort of a mild drying undercurrent then a more biting conclusion. Not much malt character at all. Mellow grassiness at the beginning of a sip, then a huge smack of pine again. Is it too much? Not sure. But it's unique, so points for that. No real alcohol flavor either in the face of the huge hops. Body is solid, although maybe could have done with a little thicker. Overall, a very tasty DIPA, and very original, although I don't think I could have too many cause of the insane hoppiness."
"D- I enjoyed the beer. You'd have to be careful drinking a few of thee, the alcohol could catch up with you."
"Just got home from class today and found a wonderfully chilled box sitting on my front door step. Low and behold there is a Double Simcoe sitting in there. So whatelse is a person to do. Perfectly chilled beer from Pennslyvania sitting on my stoop, I must drink it. So I rushed it inside and poped the top and poured it into my favorite Smokestack goblet. Pours a hazy orangy amber with a huge, sticky, off white head that left lacing all the way down. Aroma is hops, pine tree needles and citrus. Grapefruit is pretty big. Taste is big on hops also (pine, grapefruit, bit of grass) but is balanced pretty well with the malt backbone of the beer. This really surprised me. While is overwhelmingly hoppy, it never felt overly unbalanced. Mouthfeel is full. Much heavier than most DIPA's. Love it. Highly, highly drinkable. If I get involved in another trade with someone from PA then this will definitly be involved."
"D: Still probably my favorite Weyerbacher beer, and a must try for any of the hop fans but only thing holding this back for me from rating higher in the next tier of dipas is the alcohol burn."
"Very creamy mouthfeel. Nice fizziness cuts the creaminess a bit balancing it out. Fairly drinkable."
"D- Very drinkable my anyone's standards, give it a try"
"Maybe a tad boozy which pulls the drinkability down a tad but still overall this is a great brew.... you know exactly what you're getting going in and it doesn't disappoint...."
"Drinkability is moderate-high for a DIPA, i really like the creamy texture matched up with the tasty sweet hop profile, a great and well-balanced east coast DIPA I would love to sample again"
"Can't see myself drinking a bunch of this, both due to the price tag and the astringency I keep tasting. Glad to have tried it, but won't make a special trip to the East Coast to pick it up."
"A very solid DIPA -- if you like 'em bitter but balanced, this is a good choice."
"D - Good beer. Has a little alcohol finish but it's very faint and adds another level to this beer."
"Respect the Simcoe."
"Notes - Enjoyable stuff, but not my favorite kind of DIPA. The intense bitterness takes its toll on the palate after a while, leading to a quick fatigue. That being said, it was an enjoyable 12 oz and I'd definitely try it again."
"Unfortunately I don't have great notes on this, as we had other things on our mind, but it was a very hoppy but well-balanced IPA with some uniqueness added by the Simcoe hops and no flaws to speak of."
"Overall, as I said, one of my favorites. One worth seeking out, especially if you like I.P.As. Highly recommended."
"Taste has a good piney hop kick to it with the bitterness to back it up, the malt lends some nice balance in the aftertaste and a bit of sweetness, the citrus does shine through though, a very fine DIPA."
"the flavor is not what i thought it would be, but it is good, the malt is strong, the hops are a little more mellow then what i feel a double ipa should be. but it is a good beer and defenatly worth trying if yoiu like ipa's. i think i was dissapointed because i make a simcoe ipa and had an image in my mind as to how it should taste."
"M: Very smooth and creamy, wasn't expecting this. Tannic of course, but not like you would expect from this much hops."
"Viscous, syrupy, incredible hoppy goodness in a bottle. I will have to try to brew one like this."
"Pours a deep amber hue with slight rustic orange highlights. A decent sized creamy head showed itself very briefly and settled into a thin blanket of head that stayed for the whole beer. This beer leaves big sheets of lacing on the walls of my pint glass. The floral notes in the nose are intense for this offering. Heavy scents of wooded pine, grapefruit rind, and cannabis. The first flavors bring on a dry pine bitterness offset with a sweet caramel malt base and secondary flavors of citrus and orange rind. This is unlike, in a good way, any other DIPA I've tasted as of yet. This beer is medium bodied with medium carbonation on the mouthfeel, and does leave a very dry sensation on the finish. The alcohol is only slightly noticeable. The drinkability is very nice on this beer, and I would gladly purchase again if this were available to me in my state."
"A great pick up, its $$ for a four pack but a must have if you are like me and a big fan of the hopsters. I didn't like it enough to go past the 4.0/4.5, but its good nonetheless."
"This is my favorite beer. Untill maybe 9months ago this beer was only available in 22oz bottles. Since then Weyberbacher has released it in 4 packs of 12oz bottles. This is a beer made for Hopheads. It has astrong hop and strong malt flavor to it. This beer single handedly made double IPAs the top of my list.If you ever get a chance I would greatly suggest a 4 pack of these beers."
"pretty good. i certainly get an idea of the profile simcoe brings to a beer."
"Drinkability - The drinkability is awesome, I could drink this all night. You can't even tell that it has a 9% ABV until you have had several and then stand up. The mouthfeel and flavor and scent keep me coming back to take another sip. This is an awesome reference beer - although it only has one hop variety, it is far from a one trick pony - it shows that the Simcoe hop is versatile all on its own."
"D-Good beer, stands up well to others of the style. A little sweet for me to drink more than one."
"Pours an orange/copper color with a small hed that dissipates quickly. Smell is very floral with some fruitiness. Bitter taste is noticeable at first, but not over the top like some IIPA's. Some carmel flavors and sweetness. Thought it was fairly well balanced and didn't just taste like a mouthful of hops. Medium to full-bodied but easy to drink. Worth seeking out and underrated in my opinion."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and rich. Drinkability is affected a little bit by the strong floral / sweetness. Might wind up annoying over a long haul. But for one bomber, split between me and my son-in-law, this is a fine treat!!!!"
"Not bad, but not great either. I think this one had some potential and fell short for me. Seems to be a popular beer though. I'd say try this one for yourself."
"Highly recommended as a mid-point sample of an Imperial IPA...and I love my IIPA's!"
"I was not a big fan of this one. I had this at the foodery in Philly and I found the orange/hazy appearance nice with a great looking head. But the aroma was kind of 'off' and 'alcoholic' for my liking. The taste was very cloyingly sweet and boozy for me as well. Mouthfeel was actually very creamy and nice, but the drinkability was somewhat killed by the off putting aroma and taste! not horrible, but certainly not one of my personal favorites either!"
"I'm sure I'd had this before but I can't recall when or where so I picked up a bottle to try. It's got a nice golden color and a great hop aroma. And the flavor doesn't disappoint. Despite it's strength, I found this very smooth and balanced from start to finish. I really enjoyed it. It's as good a bottled double IPA as I've had (most just don't seem to translate)."
"Taste is clean and strong, pure DIPA...assuming you find overwhelming amounts of hops clean :-) Highly bitter, but with a nice compliment of fruitiness and a bit of malty balance."
"I've been disappointed with other weyerbacher offerings in the past, and I'm glad to report that this beer did not fall into the same category. Overall, this is a solid imperial IPA that has a hefty grain bill as well. It does however tend to be a bit 1-dimensional with such a strong focus on the simcoe, which really hurts the drinkability IMO. It's a great hop variety, but one bottle in a sitting is plenty for me."
"Poured a hazy amber color with cascading bubbles which formed a one inch, tan head. Left lacing as it subsided. Could only pick up the strong smell of piney, citrusy hops. Tastes strongly of hops and finishes with sweet malt taste, followed by more hops adn alcohol. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with good carbonation. I think this beer is pretty smooth for such a hoppy beer. However it is heavy and high in alcohol, making it difficut to drink more than a couple at a time."
"This beer is great for a good hop fix, but I think it might be that hint of metallic undertone at the end that turns me off just a little bit. Id go for a Nugget Nectar or a DFH 90 min first. But all in all, a pretty good double IPA."
"Maybe they should call it Sincoe instead. Cant say that I have converted but at least this is drinkable for a DIPA. Couldnt really tell the 9%."
"I love this beer, but lets call this what it is. Are you a hop-head? Looking for a hop bomb? Want a great DIPA? Like getting punched in the face? Yes, yes, yes and yes. Give this one a go. At 9% are you going to want to have more then a couple; probably not."
"D = I find this a very drinkable beer. If you want a hop bomb it is a good one. If you like strong, hoppy beers but want more balance this probably isn't for you though."
"Bought this in a 4-pak 12 oz. bottle. Pour into a tulip glass. Nice dark cooper with thin head. When swirled in glass nice carbonation. Very nice strong nose of hops. First sip was rounded in mouth and swallowed. Highly hopped beer...get a pine backbone. Very enjoyable. I would buy this beer again. Plan on aging at least one of these beers."
"Taste is all simcoe too. It starts with the citrus and pine of the hop, then leads you into malty areas. The malt is sweet and strong enough to be tasted of the simcoe but balanced enough not to take over. As it flows further in your mouth and down your throat the hops take full charge again and eclipse the malts. You can feel the bitterness bite the sides of your tongue. There is even a slight metallic bitterness that starts off the aftertaste. You are left with the residual sweetness of the malts playing nicely with the hops in the warm glow of the higher ABV. A very tasty beverage that warms you on those cold winter days."
"I really liked this one."
"The taste is just like the aroma. I love it when that happens. The taste is very IPA with a funny fruity twist. If you love IPAs and you havent tried this, then do yourself a favor and try it. This is right up there with my favorites. Mouthfeel great, carbonation great, drinkability great, glad a bought a four pack and not just a single!"
"Slick in texture with moderate carbonation. Somewhat bright but with a nice full body. Juicy slick finish with a nice lingering bitterness. A complete, balanced, and hugely flavorful brew. You basically can't go wrong with Weyerbacher."
"The beer karma rubberband has snapped back my direction in a big way... Adam thanks a bunch."
"I'm not a hop head, but even I can appreciate something like this. Can't appreciate the bigger then average price hike though. Not an everyday beer, & probably not even once a week, but I got a family pack of wings in the fridge waiting on its return. :)"
"My pint(s) were an orangish amber hue with a nice whitish head. The aroma was heavily floral and deep in pine. The flavour was a huge hop bomb, with strong piney overtones. This beer left a strange combination of stickiness and astringency in my mouth."
"Pours a hazy dark orange amber. Great white fluffy head with mad lace. smell is of piney hops and some slight english type of hop smell. Very piney hops on the first taste. Wildly smooth with a great long lasting subtle finish. Hop flavors abound and a nice pineyness. The mouthfeel is perfect and smooth as hell. Drinkability is dangerously high. Great brew, thanks JCB."
"From a company known for its eccentric and strong brews this definitely fits the brewery profile for extreme beers...Appearance was great, copper amber golden with impressive head leads to an intensley hoppy and bredy aroma that stings the nose...Flavor is extremely hoppy with strong bready flavors and caramel honey sweetness...Hefty alcohol percentage of 9% is certantly noticeable behind a bittersweet finish dominated by hops...Powerful beer with thick rich flavor...Average mouthfeel but poor drinkability due to the extreme flavor and high alcohol content...Would prefer standard IPA's over this one."
"Pours a clear but dark amber that carries a slight ruby tone. Nose is extremely sweet and piney hops. There's almost a perfume edge to it. Flavor is hob bomb. Extremely sticky sweet with strong piney hops to it. Robust. Thick. Firm. Feel is thick on the liquid and sticky. Standard carbonation. Extremely drinkable. I have had this on the bottle before and find it to be fairly different on tap, but still well worth visiting for different reasons. It seemed to be a bit more hard hitting off the tap and warrants an approach with caution mindset."
"22 oz bomber purchased at Federal Wine and Liquor in Boston. A: Hazy amber/orange, decent amount of head with good retention. Nice lacing. S: Thick malt, lots and lots of floral and citrus hops. T: Caramel sweetness followed by some very floral hops. Citrus flavors continue, some alcohol present on the finish. M: Thick, chewy, moderate to light carbonation. D: A really nice DIPA. It's really nice to see a beer devoted so simply to Simcoe. One of the better DIPA's I've had recently. Excellent choice."
"D: very drinkable. The abv is well hidden"
"It pours a dark amber reddish color with a nice thick white head. There are visible flecks floating in the beer and it has a generally cloudy character. The aroma is sweet, piney, and decently malty. I like citrusy hops more, but it isn't bad. This is a pretty bitter beer overall but with a quick blast of intense sweetness. The pine flavor is there, but not as strong as in the aroma. Overall, there isn't much of a flavor profile. It has good body although I won't seek this one out again. Simcoe is not among my favorite hops."
" If you like the simcoe, drink this right away it showcases the hop superbly. I think the simcoe does well on it's own but begs for a complimenting hop. That said, This is great sh#t."
"Overall: A very strong American double IPA, not for the faint of heart. If you're a hop-head you'll want to give this one a try."
"D- The abv and hop bitterness both make this a sipping beer by necessity, otherwise much of the brews quality and character would go to waste. As a general rule, I seldom enjoy more than one or two brews in a sitting, but on the rare occasion that I had no where to be and no pending responsibilities the following morning, this is a beer that I could easily enjoy all night long."
"This beer is addicting. Great hop complexity, not just an all out assault of bitterness. This is my favorite Double IPA. Incredible beer."
"Highly recommended. One of the best West Coast style DIPAs I have had from an east coast brewer. Definitely give this one a try."
"D:"
"4-pack bought at Capone's in Norristown, PA. Pours orange/red with a creamy head. Odor is citrusy (oranges, some lemons) and slightly catty, with hints of sweet caramel. Flavor is bitter, bitter, bitter. Bitter lemon, bitter malt. bitter. Some sweetness to it too, but man, those simcoe hops are bitter as hell...and they linger on and on. Medium bodied and not as sticky or syrupy as i expected. I've had this beer before and remember it being so much more mellow and flavorful and not just a one-dimensional hop-attack. It still tastes good, but i'd prefer to get some of the hop flavor and less of the hop bitterness. I'll let a couple of bottle sit, i guess."
"Amber color, average head - not much to look at. Nose of fresh flowers that bloom on wild bushes in the Mid-Atlantic in May/ June, with a little citrus oil in the back. The flavor was straight up fresh squeezed grapefruit juice with a little tangerine to boot. Unbelievable! Alcohol and sweet malts are present in the finish and mouthfeel. This was one of the best hop experiences I've had."
"Drinkability- The Simcoe is a hop that Ive tasted before but didnt realize thats what it was. Id have to put it second behind Cascades as my favorite hop variety. I like these American hops much better than their brethren such as the Noble. This brew is nicely balanced and not semi-undrinkable like the Sam Adams Imperial. Nice job by Weyerbacher and big thanks to phnphilly!"
" This is easily one of my favorite DIPA's, the simicoe hops are really very complex, non-bitter and VERY fruity. Highly recommended for the big-time hop-head."
"No I would feel no shame!"
"D. Hard to get here and the abv is a bit high."
"Thanks go to goodbyeohio for hooking me up with a couple bottles of this great brew."
"O: i can’t really describe it... i enjoyed this beer a lot... but struggled to get through it.."
"D: I'll definitely have this again. Very drinkable. I actually think I just saw this freshly stocked at Dilly Deli."
"All in all a great one and one of my favorites from Weyerbacher. Everything blends well and I just need to try it again to see if my pour affected the head and retention."
"Since my initial review i've had this brew on tap at the publick house and out of the bottle a few times. I can honestly say that this is probably one of my favorite brews out there. Hops are in your face but not too over the top. Carbonation is aggressive enough to please me but not too bubbly. Absolutely perfect in my humble opinion. Best straight out of the tap (but what isn't?)."
"Overall impression: Definitely one for the hop heads, this is a great showcase for hop flavor."
"Highly recommended to any hop lover."
"Final Statment: Oak and butterscotch seemed unwelcomed for this brew. Would like to spend a bit more time with this one."
"Overall, a very nice brew. Refreshing. Very drinkable, which could be dangerous at 9%."
"...Willy (of wanaque)"
"This brew has some heat to it and the 9.0% ABV is well hidden. An original monster double ipa. Gotta be in the right mood for this one."
"Has a nice dark amber color with nice head and a bit of lacing. Excellent scent! Very hoppy with nice spicy scents, and with this Weyerbacher, the alcohol does not override the aroma. Unfortunately, the alcohol does hurt the taste a bit. It has a nice bitter taste, and if it wasnt for the high alcohol taste, the extra flavors would really come through. Not the best IPA, but could be great with a bit less ABV, unless thats what youre really looking for."
"Pours a five+ finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving an excellent lace. Cloudy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Grapefruit nose. Flavor is piney grapefruit with hints of sweetness, finish is sweetish but a dry hoppy aftertaste. Better than the usual IPA. $2.60 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME."
"Biting piney hops in the front, giving way to a spicy alcoholic rush met with sweetness and more citrus fruits in the backend. Hops are very aggressive and juicy, very bold. A great High Gravity IPA, to be sure. This one warrants the purchase of an entire sixpack."
"22 ounce bottle, served in a Sam Adams BL Glass the beer pours an orange/copper color with an inch and a half frothy off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both excellent. The aroma is mostly hops, more citrusy than pine/herbal. There's also some sweet malt noticable too. Taste is the same as the aroma, mostly hoppy with a bit of malt. Good bitter lingering hoppy aftertaste, and it's not harsh at all. Mouthfeel/body is medium with low carbonation, and it's creamy and oily. Drinkability is pretty good, it's really smooth and the alcohol isn't very noticable. I like this beer a lot, I'd recommend it to others and I will definitely buy this again."
"Pours a hazy orange with an attractive and sticky 1.5 finger head. The aroma is very pungent citrus, but is a tad oversweet. I love what this beer does to my palate -- opens with sweet citrus which is followed quickly by a sharp bitter hop bite that quickly subsides into a mellow, sweet finish with a hint of alcohol burn. A very interesting and tasty DIPA, but it's not the most drinkable for me."
"Overall a fantastic beer and only made slightly less drinkable by the hop and alcohol assault. Excellent beer."
"D: Very good for a beer of this strength. Like I said, it really encourages you to take that next sip, and before you know it. . . the bomber is empty, your belly is full and your head is in a better place. . . ."
"One look at this beer and I had to try it. Poured into the glass apperance is nice with about half inch of head. The smell is one of hops, slight piney. Best tasting dipa I have ever tasted. Very drinkable but after two you really feel the abv %. I really like this beer and can not get a enough of it."
"One of the better DIPA's on the market. On par with ruination. Thanks Easter Bunny. Bawk Bawk."
"M/D: Carbonation is minimal. Meduim-full bodied. Above average drinkability. Good mouthfeel and sticky on the lips. Overall, an excellent representation of the style."
" An excellent and tasty Ipa . More ..."
"I like this beer, but it is a bit too strong for all but the biggest hopheads."
"Pleasant & robust nose of floral citrus. Bitter from the get-go, this ends pretty harsh, and slightly hot. Syrupy, and not particularly easy drinking; this is a sipping man's DIPA. I don't feel as I can define this as well balanced, as I wish this had something more than bitter & cloying going on."
"If you can get a keg, do it!"
"I bought a single bottle to try out, but I'm going back to get a four pack. The high ABV would cellar well, but I think the Simcoe magic would fade. I can see stretching two of these out over an evening of reading or sitting around the fireplace."
"Enjoy this American DIPA..."
"Taste starts off with toasted toffee malt that quickly gets pushed aside by an explosion of Simcoe hop goodness. Fresh evergreen boughs, sap, and zesty citrus mix with a spicy floral hop flavor. Rummy fruits fill in the background mid-palate before the hops take over the long, dryish, deliciously bitter finish. Slightly warming and completely tongue-numbing! Medium-full body with a slightly syrupy feel. Very well done!"
"Drinks super for the ABV, a hophead's delight. One of the best DIPAs I've had!"
"A deep Amber color, with a two inch thick head, that is off white to cream colored. The head has strong rention as well. The scent of citrus, mostly grapefruit, plus, grass and pine fragrances dominate the nose, finishing off with the sweet scent of malt. The taste starts with the malt at the front, followed by grapefruit and a grassy bitterness. The two flavors blend very well together. A medium bodied feel all the way through, does slightly thin out at the end. a unique flavored DIPA, strong aroma and flavor, but like most DIPA's drink slowly."
"Overall a delicious beer, and one that will sneak up on you. If you like the IPA family, this should be a regular."
"This hop bomb puts the extreme in extreme beer. Great job by Weyerbacher, an excellent addition to the Double IPA style, and to well-crafted beer in general. Highly recommended."
"D: Not bad. I could have 2, but definitely no more. Plus, I'd rather try a different hop flavor."
"The taste was absolutely delicious: foresty, resinous, sweet hops dominated the palate, but there was also a nice balance of malts. Citrus fruit, alcohol, and more hops finished this beer off strong. Mouthfeel detected a crisp, medium body that packed one hell of a mouth-puckering, bitter finish. It went over well at first, but eventually wore out the tastebuds a bit. All in all, Weyerbacher's Double Simcoe is amazingly complex, flavorful, and (despite the 9% ABV) quite easy to drink...if it weren't so expensive, I'd have one every week."
"Pours a rich copper,with a one finger plus off white head. Excellent retention,and lacing. Aroma is of grapefruit,and floral hops. Body is thick,and carbonated. Taste is hopped,but there is an underlying sweetness there. Nice grapefruit finish.Excellent!"
"This badboy poured a nice rich copper with a tan 2 finger head with nice lacing. Smell is predominantly floral hops with lingering grapefruit. Taste is very citrus, with nice combination of floral and piney mixture. Very impressive hops. I'm a real hophead, and this was a nice hoppy slap on the palate. Alcohol presence is a little disheartening, but nothing to cry about. Mouthfeel was surprisingly thick and malty. A very drinkable brew, but I personally wouldn't pass 2 at a session. Impressive to say the least!"
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is big and oily. I really don't like the harshness and flavors of this DIPA (mainly the butterscotch) and I will not purchase it again."
"Pours a burnt amber color with a small but creamy head. Aroma is nothing but hops, mainly the citrus variety. Taste follows aromas, a true hop-bomb, with a very small caramel malt sweetness in there as well. This beer finishes a little sticky, with a hop aftertaste that begs you to take another sip. Very well executed double IPA in my opinion! One of the best I have tasted."
""
"The aroma is filled with pine, orange blossom, and perfume. The taste is a little smoother than the aroma, almost spicy like a rye beer, with a citrus rind bitterness and a bit of orange and lemon. Overall, not amazing, but different and totally worth trying. One of my favorite Weyerbacher's."
"Scott"
"Of course, very hoppy taste. Very medicine-y or syrupy might be a better word. As if they squeezed tons of fresh Simcoe straight into a glass. Very good, not much malt balance. This one is 100% hops! I maybe could have had another, but I'll save my other 3 for a rainy day."
"D: I love it. I would gladly drink this again. Even with the higher ABV, you don't notice it, and if you love hops, this is a great beer."
"Only had a couple double ipa's on tap at the house. Most people only drink one or two. This beer got pounded,dangerous drinkabilly just ask the WVbeergeek if you don't belive me. Drink this beer with caution and enjoy"
"D-great for 10%"
"Alpha Acids? Yes. I surely cant taste malt, my goal when going for a good DIPA. Aggressive, but with whose in its league, its gotta be."
"A good beer, worth giving a test drive."
"Pours pure bronze with a thick head that sticks around permanent lacing. Looks awesome. The smell smacks me like a kinky hot broad and I love it. Spice, pine and POWERFUL fresh hops. More is there but I cant get over how great the hops smell leaving me to focus on it. Tastes mildly sweet, the perfect amount. Hops are all over the place that are pleasantly bitter and dry. Im beginning to realize what a great and true IPA tastes like. Not an abundance of flavors, some citrus but delicious as it is. I love this beer and will definitely put it in the starting lineup."
"D- A very solid DIPA. For some reason I don't see myself seeking this out again. But, I am glad that I tried it and am impressed with it."
"Not as drinkable as could be hoped from the outstanding aroma and appearance of this beer. The flavor needs a little tuning to be among the best of this style. This is so very close to the best of its class that it only needs a slight toning down of the bitterness levels to allow more hop subtle flavors to emerge rather than stun. After on glass of this my sense of taste is quite thoroughly stunned for the night and I can't really taste anything else less powerful than this beer of a painfully spicy hot pepper. Remarkable and VERY close too truly great."
"Drink this beer. Then drink it again."
"also found 4 packs of 12oz. bottles."
"Overall, a great beer. Big hop flavors and huge bitterness backed up by lots of malt. Recommended."
"D- Any double IPA fan can appreciate this beer. It is a different breed than other IPA's that are more floral or piney. This one comes from a different angle and you have to appreciate that. It's a good beer, to some it would be an amazing beer, but to my tastes it's just a good beer."
"N: A delicious IPA that I can't stop thinking about the Maharaja...which isn't such a bad thing, is it. I would recommend it to any hop baller, but knock its drinkability purely on the bitter bite the hops leave on the back of the tongue. Nonetheless, one hell of a brew from Weyerbach."
"22 oz bottle, 8 oz sample. This brew pours a hazy straw-orange color with a light coat of head over top. There is a very light carbonation in the brew and the hazyness is very apparent. The aroma is deep resinous, lightly peppery hop, with a thick caramel sweetness laying under it. The sweetness is prevalent and the hop really stabilizes it. Taking a sip, I find a strong and chunky caramel malt, with a peppery, earthy, and lightly juicy sweet. The flavors balance well together. Mouthfeel is thick with a lighter carbonation. There is a touch of slickness in there too. The alcohol somewhat comes through in the flavor as a spicyness, but it is not too strong. Overall, this one really drinks nicely. There is a touch of warming in it that I think is good for the brew. I would have this one again."
"Poured a deep amber color, thick light tan head, very good head retention. Aroma? oh man what an aroma. Heavy on the pine, just the whay i like it. Reminded me of a fresh-cut xmas tree. Taste is equally impressive. Started with a lot of piney hop bitterness fading to just a hint of grapefruit. Wow. Mouthfeel is great as well. Nice and sticky, moist, very smooth. A VERY delicious, easy to drink DIPA. Flavor is so amazing, but i'm not sure that after a whole bomber of this i'd be able to taste much of anything else."
"Pours a translucent amber color with some orange highlights. One-fingered light tan head that lasts for about 20 seconds, leaving a good sheen of foam and stickage. Aroma is rich with pine-like resins and leafy hoppiness; malt seems hidden other than a flickering of sweetness, but it has to be there. Upon sipping, the sweetness certainly comes out, like a bursting ruby red grapefruit. Definitely hoppy all the way to the dry finish, but juicy at the same time. The mouthfeel is pretty tame for a 9%er, plenty of carbonation to keep it spritzy on the tongue, but you can tell it's a bit thicker than your average IPA due to sticky lips. A hefty and tasty IPA, consume in mass with caution. Very nice."
"D - An exceptionally drinkable DIPA. Hugely hoppy but balanced. Despite the big flavor, it is fairly quaffable. I will defintely be returning to this beer (and other Weyerbacher brews) if I can get my mitts on them."
"Overall, this beer lived up and even surpassed my expectations. I am finding myself drawn more and more towards the double IPA style of beer. This beer is scarily drinkable, but be careful with the high ABV."
"D: The 9% abv peeps through at times but generally stays in the background. The biting hops could quickly numb the tongue and impair the taste, but what a way to go out!"
"Pours a clean copper color with a off white head that stuck around, even in the lacing. Earthy and a small citrus aroma in the nose. This beer is all about the hops, has a dryer end. As it warms up, it gets to be sweet and sticky. Not much left behind but a small amout of bitterness in the mouth. It also hides the ABV quite well."
"A true winner."
"D - To start, let me say that I love the idea of a single-hop IPA. It's an opportunity to showcase the nuances of a single variety and helps the beer enthusiast better understand how to tell the difference between hop types. It's like a varietal IPA. BUT... making a varietal hop monster almost defeats that purpose. Sure, Simcoe hops are delicious in their own right, and Weyerbacher has created a very good beer, but I still feel that it falls short of what it really could be if an ounce of restraint were exercised. Double Simcoe is a hop bomb in every sense of the definition. Lots of ba-boom, but not much precision."
"Weyerbacher double simcoe pours a nice red brown with a thick off-white head that doesn't fade away. Aroma is bitter and piney some caramel and citrus notes as well. Flavor is rich and hoppy with a much stronger malt profile than I'm used to with a DIPA. More pine and citrus flavors as well as some alcohol, but it's hidden well for a 9% beer. I think this one could almost pass for an American Barleywine if they wanted it to."
"Hop Heads dream. Tastes like drinking Simcoe hops, which to me there is nothing better. Great crisp beer, doesn't leave an oily feel in your mouth. Very drinkable, wish i had more after finishing my first one. Can't wait to get my hands on it again"
"I think it's an object lesson in how more is not necessarily better, but I'm happy to get such a clean picture of what the Simcoe hop does."
"The feel is bubbly and a bit coarse, but also buttery too. Leaves a bitter film. Overall I would use these adjectives: Woody, coarse, hoppy, bitter, very Imperial. Nice but way way bitter."
"D: Easy to drink, and it will kick your tail too. Wonderful beer, one of my favorites. If you're an IPA fan like I am, you'll love this anytime."
"Bravo! Weyerbacher"
"Poured from a 22oz bottle, beer is a deep copper color with red hue and a thick foamy head, some lacing with tiny bubbles. Smell of grapefruit, blossoms and hops. First taste is powerful with high ABV and high hops content. Taste of grapefruit is most distinctive with lots of hoppyness and a bitter finish. No malt is readily detected. Mouthfeel is medium and foamy on the tongue. Drinkability is not exceptional unless you crave the level of hops and bitterness in this beer, but this beer lives up to is Double IPA classification."
"I got this beer by recommendation of the beer guru in the store. I wanted something good for a holiday with friends. I was impressed by the incredible drinkability of this big beer. Kinda scary. Nice color and nose. It lingers a bit on the palate but I like that. Grapefruit character is pronounced and welcomed. I gave some to a friend who is a light beer drinker (boring) and he was pleasantly surprised and had another. Would recommend this beer to hopheads and anyone liking massive flavor in their brew."
"Overall: A simply fantastic IPA, completely blows their mediocre hops infusion single ipa out of the water. Right up there with 90 minute ipa and ruination in my opinion, one of my fav DIPA's. If you like the style, this one is a must try."
"This beer poured a cloudy dark orange or amber with a large four finger head that eventually died down to a steady two finger head that lasted through my entire sitting. The nose was a strong citrus, definatley a beer for the hophead. The citrus on the nose turned into what came across to me as grapefruit flavors on the tongue. I was pleasantly suprised with this one. For a double IPA at 9% it went down really quickly. I also enjoyed getting a full view of Simcoe. Highly recommended for any one who loves the hops."
"dark orange brown with an off white creamy two finger head. smells divine. grapefruit, pine, citrus, and maybe bubblegum. tastes the same with a little bitterness and a lot of smoothness. i can feel this one. no, not like buzz feel, but like the kind of brew that just warms up as it goes down. like this one is actually alive. i love dipa's. i'd drink this every day if i had to."
"D - Very balanced DIPA. Enjoyable"
"D - Overall, Simcoe hops have a very good taste, and distinct from other hop varieties. This beer is smooth and creamy, which is different; part of the reason I like DIPA's, they always surprise me. Thanks again Matt."
"D- It's a double IPA. For the hop lover, it's a dream come true. If you're not that into hops, don't buy this beer."
"D-Alcohol is so well hidden, I ended up having three of these last night at the Blind Tiger. any time i have more than one of a beer there, I know I like it. If i see this in the bottle I will defnitely get this and will seek it out on tap. A great East Coast 2xIPA using west coast hops."
"D: Incredible for its strength."
"Off white head--solid lace down the galss. Clean, singular nose of Simcoe--strong, a little grassy, but grapefruity as hell-sinus clearing but nice. Grassy more in the taste than the nose, and bitter and dry going down. Almost enough malt to balance in the amber orange beer. Very fun if you like a fresh hop taste."
"The mouthfeel is medium with a medium finish. Overall it is very drinkable. I would prefer this to be more on the hoppy side - not on the malty side as it is."
"Split this 22oz bottle with a friend. Weyerbacher has some really strange label art. Anyway, this one was a nice dark orange in color. The smell was tropical fruit, mostly pineapples. The taste was citrus, pineapple, pinecone, and other fruits. This was a really good beer that I wish I could buy locally. It might also be nice if the ABV was a little lower."
"Into a pint glass, pours a lovely amber copper, a good sized off-white head that keeps and settles to a thin foam, lots of lacing all down the glass. The aroma is a smattering of fruity hops, a bit grassy and earthy perhaps, very nice. The taste is even better, by quite a bit. In fact, you could probably write a poem about it. As it is, its way too nice outside, so I'll just say its every bit the DIPA its purported to be, oodles of fruity goodness, resinous saps, caramel sugars, lots of stuff going on here. And the mouth is equally fine, full, chewy, sticky, slick, warming.... ya, its good. In all, ya, its a great beer."
"D- this is very drinkable. Reccommended for the IPA and all around beer lover."
"Served slightly chilled in a pint glass, from a twenty two ounce bottle. Poured a beautiful , clear, copper red color with orange highlights. About an inch of thick, frothy off-white head formed. Head slowly settled into some decent lace. Strong hop aroma wafted up from the glass, followed by some sour citrus fruits, and traces of fresh cut pine. Also nice malt tones, and ofcourse more hops. Hops definitely own the nose. Flavor was much of the same. Nice bitter, but smooth Simcoe hop bite. Tons of citrus with lots of underlying pine with a nice sweet maltiness balance this bad boy out nicely. Big hops in this one but not insanely overpowering. The flavors seem to compliment eachother well. Little in the way of carbonation. Mouthfeel was full, thick, and damn sticky. Aftertaste lingers with you for a while. This beer is very easy to drink. Overall, pretty complex and flavorful."
"Overall a very nice beer. A great beer to have with a cheese steak sandwich. Worth the try. I would ignore it over a handful of other selections, but still above the average."
"This is amazing, easily one of Weyerbacher's very best. Getting up there in gravity, but still so lip-smackingly delicious and easy to enjoy. You don't have to fight the alcohol here, as the rush of flavor completely takes center stage. Bravo."
"This beer pours a beautiful golden copper with a nice head that sits well. Sticky, thick lacing as well. Very great looker. I smelled this beer right when I began to remove the cap, it literally came straight to my nose with no effort. Piney citrus hops and a malty sweetness as well, hops dominating. The taste brings in more of the sweetness. Clean and thirst quenching citric hops including grapefruit, orange/tangerine. Again, the hops are in control but the malts do contend a little to me. Pretty well balanced. Mouthfeel is nice and sticky, fairly low carbonation again but still delivering a tingle to the tongue. Drinkability is good. Not too much or too little of anything going on here. A very good all around beer that actually surprised me compared to other beers I've had from Weyerbacher."
"Drinkability: Nice DIPA here and it seems like it could be one that even non-hopheads could enjoy. If you see this around buy it."
"The beer pours a dark gold/amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a HUGE citrus hop blast that really hits you in the nose. It's also got a nice malt aroma that adds a bit of balance to the equation. The taste is good. It has a wondeful malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes a bit sweet. The hop presence is tremendous. It's got a powerful citrus hop flavor all the way through to the finish. It adds a refreshing feel even at 9 %. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good double IPA. It's got it all; a good drinker."
"Final Note: This beer is a great value and great tasting."
"Double Simcoe pours a clear burnt amber with a fluffy off-white head that dies down quickly after pour. Lacing is medium throughout tasting with a decent amount of stickiness. Delicious simcoe hop aroma of powerful citrus, mostly grapefruit with a bit of pine. Hints of caramel malt appear to tickle the nose as well. Taste is a very earthy, but quite sweet for a DIPA. Obvious citrus flavoring with a good floral punch. A nice bready malt aftertaste balances this out quite well for such a hop bomb. Mouthfeel is a medium body that is quite smooth but has a good dryness. Drinkability is pretty good, but the only thing I feel that gets in the way is the carbonation. Any hophead will surely appreciate this brew."
"Another solid offering from this brewery, which I wish we could get out here in Oregon..."
"Straight off, it produces a beautiful light-tan head that remained intact for a long while before evolving into some nice sticky lacing. The nose was floral and mildly sweetish. I read where this strain is a recent development and it put me in mind of a recent Lew Bryson blog in which he was expressing incredulousness over a marijuana-related site's review of various strains in the same terms as we use for hops. They are of the same family, actually, and the sticky lacing put me in mind of some Hawaiian that I had as a kid. The mouthfeel was almost hot with its combination of alcohol and hops, but I really dug it. I am not a session beer guy. The finish was gaspingly hoppy, really asserting itself and making me wish for a glass of water to wash it down. Oh my. I may need another bottle to make absolutely sure of my unbiased opinion."
"D: So much depth to this beer makes it one to savor as it warms up. Definitely not for the faint of heart, but for those adventureous souls, this is a hop monster to tackle. The sweetness and bitterness will put your palate to the test, and the ABV will make sure you feel its effects. Regardless, it's still quite tasty, and maintains good flavor character, even despite being hopped like hell."
"...you get the point."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Very smooth and easy to drink, especially with the 9% abv. Leaves a wonderful, dry bitter aftertaste. Overall, this is a flat out excellent beer. If you're into hops, you must give it a try."
"Edit: had a chance to have this again 12-6-09 ... simply marvelous. This is what a DIPA should be."
"Poured a slightly hazy orange with a decent head that left left great lacing. The aroma was dominated by pine hops with some caramel malts. The taste was a great blend of pine and citrus hop flavor against a well balanced malt backbone. The beer was medium bodied with relatively hidden alcohol. This is a very enjoyable DIPA."
"not a session beer by any means, average as far as double ipa's, a bit too tart...."
"Pours a dark amber with a nice head that sticks around as a thin cap. Pretty decent lacing as well. The smellis great-love those Simcoe hops! Nice piney and citrusy smell with baked apple, wax, and a decent but not overwhelming malt backbone. Very nice flavors as well. Same flavors as aromas, but with a long creamy, waxy, bitter finish that is especially nice. Quite fruity with citrus, cherries, and a slight meatiness.Not sweet at all, which is a nice change of pace from many dipas. Relatively thin mouthfeel, but not so much so that the hops aren't supported. This probably slightly decreases the mouthfeel score but slightly increases the drinkability. I like this beer- I'm a fan of the Simcoe hop and hope to see more offerings utilizing it. This beer is particular refreshing for a dipa, and while not my favorite in the category, its a worthy effort."
"Tully's here in Maine just started carrying some Weyerbacher products. This was the first one I tried. I only hope their other offerings are this good. Poured into a tulip glass, this beer was a nice copper color with a fairly thick head. A little lacing was apparent. Aroma was citrusy, mostly grapefruit. The taste was intensely hoppy (grapefruit). This was an in your face blast; loved it. It had a resinous, oily mouthfeel. Great beer. Have one or two of these, don't drink anything else when you have this particular IPA."
"i really enjoyed this double IPA with a westcoast sort of feel. definitely worth a try, the fresher the better."
"22oz bomber from Florian's. Translucent copper body with about an inch of off-white head. Citrus and pine dominate the aroma. Strong citrus/pith pine dominate the flavor, with undertones of caramel malt, just enough to support the strong hop character. No alcohol flavor present, though a bit of alcohol warming is there. A pretty well-balanced beer, though it's fefinitely hop-forward. On the lighter side of medium bodied. All this makes for a surprisingly drinkable beer for the ABV etc. A solid double IPA, and I can see getting this from time to time."
"I'm sorry but this is too much of a good thing. I cannot detect malt at all. At 9%, I'm surprised at how little warmth I get from the alcohol. If you use this in a flight, I'd suggest making this one the last one."
"D- At 9% ABV, I would stick with one or two of these an evening, but otherwise very drinkable."
"D: Very good DIPA, My first venture out with Weyerbacher, a good drink but tough to have more than a couple of these without some serious palate cleansing"
"Very dark amber cloudy body with a 1/2 in. off white head that fell after a couple minutes.Nice lacing on the glass as the beer goes down.The smell is citrus,pineapple,grapefruit and malt.The taste is awesome! POW! Bittering hop(simcoe) No floral hops in this brew it seems.Just all bittering baby!Mouthful is in between thick and thin.Very awesome,I want more.It doesnt seem as simcoeie as other simcoe beer but never falls short.Very satisfying and as it warms the hops are still bitter as a mofo! There is no stoping this hop monster! Great beer and highly recommended."
"This beer was a pleasent suprise and I'm glad it's so readily available to me. Recommended to all of the hopheads out there."
"This is a good beer, but it's not a style I'm particularly fond of. Each to their own I suppose..."
"I have seen the future of the American Double IPA, and this is it. Simcoe hops are simply awesome, and a this beer is a fantastic showcase of what Simcoe can do."
"Mouthfeel is somewhat sweet and sticky, this gets worse when nearing the bottom. Aftertaste is bitter, dry and citric."
"May 2007. Sampled again off tap, at Mr.Goodbar in Buffalo, and it was FRESH, and I said WOW! This beer impresses me so very much. All aspects the same, it was just so much more vibrant, so much more lively and so very delicious. I make these notes only as testament to why I had to raise my scores. This is certainly a top favourite of mine for DIPA's."
"drinkability is great. very well balanced, hiding its alcohol well. really enjoying this one. thanks again craig!"
"D: Deceptively drinkable. Very sweet for the style. A tad one sided due to the overload of simcoe hops, but damn tasty. A simcoe hophead's dream come true!"
"22oz bottle purchased from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours a light gold with little head and just a bit of bubbles floating to the top. Decent lacing on the way down. It has the expected solid hoppy aroma. Hey, maybe this beer can be used as a teaching tool so that I will be able to identify Simcoe hops in the future... Flavour is piney - I guess there is not much of a flora quality to Simcoe hops. A good beer - but doesn't significantly stand out from even some regular IPAs. And doesn't come close to what has become my standard for this category - Stone's Ruination."
"Drinkability: A pretty drinkable DIPA. Doesn't feel as stomach-filling as the last incarnation, which helps in this category. Still, it's no session beer ;)"
"Okay, Weyerbacher. Nice work. This Double IPA is far from overbearing, unlike many others of the style. This would make a nice warm day beer. It feels very much like the 9% that it is, but that doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. Very nice!"
"Bomber courtesy of HogTown Harry- hes the man! Pours out a dark cloudy tangerine. Excellent head and lacing. Aroma is hop and sweet. This was my first time trying Simcoe hops- quite different. Not overly bitter at the start- moreso grassy and piney. The bitterness kicks in at the end- the finish is super dry. Sucks the life out of you thats for sure! Despite the hops, the malts are holding their own. Creamy toffee mouthfeel and fairly sweet. Some buttery notes. Overall a very good beer. The finish is a tad dry but otherwise very good. Carbonation levels are good. This is a bomber to share, but I plowed through it on my own. I noticed the booziness pick half way through the bottle."
"I don't find it to be all that drinkable; takes a good 30 to 45 minutes at least, unlike some other better balanced DIPAs out there. Overall, though, a good beer, and I do like the slightly different taste of the Simcoe hop, although I don't know that its special enough to be the name of the brew."
"D: Yet another Weyerbacher brew that failed to wow me. I really want to like their beers, but they keep coming up short. This one needs some kind of flavor to make it drinkable."
"d: the score I struggle with the most. I never want two in the same day, but I can't imagine a week without one"
"A nice experiment, but overall, underwhelming."
"Definitely not an 90 minute IPA but is quite a nice choice."
"This is a great DIPA, looking forward to trying it again. But not two at one time. Wish for a second one so I can do a head-to-head with with other top DIPAs like Ruination and Gordon. Definitely recommended."
"This is a very interesting IPA, and one I like a lot"
"Would I drink this again - Hell yes! This was hyped to me for several weeks before I obtained it, so I did not know what was coming for real. The Simcoe hops were a nice change for me. I look forward to getting some more."
"Thanks to markgugs for the trade!"
"The malty feel of this brew is what sets it apart from other Double Ipa's."
"Thanks to markgugs for this gem."
"I would not plan on drinking anything after this one. This would make a regular IPA taste like Bud Light and anything else taste like water. I'd call this an extreme beer and then some. Recommended for the hopheads out there."
"Wow. There needs to be more beers brewed with this wonder-hop. It basically has all the qualities that I like in American hops without being too abrasive. I love it."
"lined up in rows on the pint glass. Pitney, citrus flavor that bursts with each sip. Is slightly bitter and complex. The Simcoe hops come through providing a most unique taste. Smooth with a slight alcohol aftertaste. Careful... this will sneak up on you! This ale rates a weekly purchase and stays in the rotation.."
"Drinkablilty - One of my new favorite hop varieties makes me want to drink this beer more and more. The alcohol is well played and I could easily drink the full 22 oz'er and probably one of his siblings as well. The whole experience was fantastic. I just wish I had some tasty food to go with, ah maybe next time."
"However, I really enjoyed this beer and would recommend it over other local double IPA's."
"968"
"D---I really enjoyed having a chance to try a single hop variety DIPA."
"Garnet/ruby color with a whitish head and big bubbles on top. Small bubbles rise slow but there is some carbonation there. Floral and grapefruity hop smell. Possibly a sweeter smell like pineapple as well. The smell is my favorite part of this one. Floral hop taste with a huge bitter bite. Massive hop taste. Laces the glass well. Sticky and resiny when left on lips. Full-bodied and oily. Drinkability is good IMO. I remember buying a case from Weyerbacher called their """big beers""" variety case and being disappointed that Raspberry Imperial Stout was replaced with this. Not knocking the Raspberry, but now I'd rather have this."
"Very drinkable considering the higher abv. An excellent good DIPA. I really dig the single hop profile. I have yet to see this in 6 packs, but I'm waiting patiently."
"But many thanks to bennetj17, SkinnyElvis, zrbrrt, and mcallister for this beauty ! Glad I have more than one!!"
"bomber. poured a cloudy orange amber with a off white head. aroma, grapefruit with honey on top of it, pine, alcohol, medicine, fruity. flavor big hops, the grapefruit now has sugar on it, some floral, honey, as it warms the alcohol starts to come out strong. dryness and bitter in the finish. for me this is a beer you want to take your time drinking."
"Drinkability: Very tasty!!!! Great Beer"
"D: Powerful taste, powerful effects. Not a beer to be f'ed with. One bomber is more than enough at a time."
"D- The big hop punch of bitterness is very nice but unique in its complexity. The sweetness of the malt really helps the hops pop and the complexity of a single type of hops is surprisingly good."
"Clear, medium reddish-amber with a large, thick, off-white, foamy head. Good retention and lacing. It has a wonderful piney hops aroma, backed by citrus, some lightly sweet, well-rounded malts, and a hint of meaty yeast. Also some caramel and a hint of banana, butter and vanilla. The taste is thats a spicy meat-eh-ball-eh! Lots of citrus and VERY bitter, with a citrus rind bitter finish. You know, I never thought Id be saying this but I think its actually TOO bitter. The bitterness is a little overwhelming and in my opinion masks the other admirable qualities of the beer a bit. It has a medium body, oily texture and moderate carbonation. This one definitely grew on me as the bottle went down. Fabulous aroma, but while I know the Double IPA is a beer for the hophead, balance shouldnt suffer as a result. Still, a very good beer overall."
"Drinkability - a good DIPA, I really enjoyed it. Hop heads unite! Or at least getcha a bomber of this, I think you'll like it."
"A decent brew for most, a Great beer for hop heads. Another Weyerbacher product that I enjoy. They just keep crankin em out!"
"Seems to me that Hop Devil just found itself a nemesis"
"Poured into a red wine glass. Orange colored with a generous thick cream colored head. Small hop particles were present (not a problem with me). The aromatics of this beer were amazing. It had that signature Pacific coast aroma of citrus and pine while at the same time displaying a very distinct pungent earthy tone. At first, this seems to be just another 'west-coast' style DIPA, but then the Simcoe comes through. A very pungent, almost blue cheese flavor that was balanced out by some residual sweetness. Mouthfeel was great. Very sticky and viscous from the hops. Surprisingly drinkable - you would never guess the 9% if it weren't on the label. Overall, this was an enjoyable beer that I would try again. It was my first experience with the Simcoe hop, and I would have to try it a few more times to acquire a taste for it enough to be crazy about it."
"D - Unique beer but I just can't seem to get past the funkiness of the Simcoe hops. I can see how people could love this beer but I don't think I am a big fan of Simcoe after trying this one. I hope to see more single hop beers like this in the future."
"Very reasonable priced too. I recommend it."
"this is a damn good hopped intense beer."
"Thick, hoppy taste, but again the citrus makes this brew more drinkabke than your average double IPA. Very complex flavors. This is a tasty version of an overly trendt style. I'll drink one again!"
"This is a terrific beer for hop heads. It's not overly bitter, quite drinkable and has a lovely aroma. I've just become a big fan of simcoe hops."
"As good as it is - and it is - the hops slap you around with an added alcohol pinch - it does get to be a bit much - slow-sipping here."
"I was really looking foward to tasting these since I love Simcoe hops in my beer. Big frothy head that mostly lasted. Heavy hops aroma, with pine, citrus, and of course, grapefruit. Very distincly Simcoe. Nice mouthfeel that coats the tongue. Long after taste."
"I would highly reccommend this beer to anyone and hope to have more myself sometime soon."
"Pours a slightly cloudy dark orange color, nice carbonation, huge foamy off white head, tons of huge islands and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is of sweet malts, hops a plenty, slight citrus and slight caramel. The taste follows the nose pretty much, very hoppy and sweet malty. A very nice bitter/dry finish. Medium body, well rounded brew. Very drinkable, my first Weyerbacher, hopefully not my last."
"A bomber that is greatly drinkable. Just hops, and nicely malted but still on the bitter side. Must be enjoyed on its own, with another IPA would not be as much of a standout. A good IPA and not overdone double. Lace in glass, and good colour and head. Hoppy aroma, and nothing but.Had on tap a few months later and it was about the same."
"In addition, I thought that alot of Weyerbacher's beers are too sweet but this one is perfect in the sugar area. Very balanced and manageable. I could drink this all day if I could still think after doing so."
"I love the brewery, but this one....too sticky, unpleasant tastes, and enough hops but not in the right way. Sorry, Weyerbacher. I still believe!"
"I'm very glad to hear this is going to become a year round beer for Weyerbacher. Only sucks I have to trade for it every time I need my fix. I was starting to think the east coast couldn't make a DIPA I could enjoy. Not only did Weyerbacher do that, they put one in my top 3. I'm actually brewing an all simcoe IPA this week. Hopefully I can do it justice."
"I feel stupid in worrying that I needed to drink this bottle of Weyerbacher Double Simcoe IPA before the hops faded. This sucker will be kicking for the foreseeable future. I'm thrilled to death that the brewery has decided to release it year-round and will be sure to load up whenever I travel to Ohio. Thanks to BitterBrian for this hop monster of a beer that is easily the finest offering that Weyerbacher has yet produced."
"Drinkability is quite for the strong hop presence and high ABV. Overall, this is more of a special occasion beer than an everyday drinker."
"Drinkability - Once you start on this beer, you're gonna down it faster than any IPA you've ever had."
"Thank you very much for the bottle Mikesgroove."
"This has a creamy mouthfeel that leaves a very hoppy aftertaste. At 9%, it's not a highly sessionable beer, but it tastes so good that you can't put it down. Very happy that Weyerbacher recently announced that this will be a year round offering. This will be a regular staple in my fridge. Highly recommend."
"Cheers!"
"This beer is way too drinkable for a 9 percent beer. It's one of the hoppiest DIPAs Ive tried, yet is also so smooth. Im extremely impressed with my first Weyerbacher beer."
"-Oelergud"
"Cheers2Beers"
"Exceptional head and lacing after a medium to dark copper pour. Smell is intense...very piney hops with a very pleasant yeasty undertone. Taste is very intense also...high octane hops..good for the style. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice smoothness...alcohol presence is somewaht understated. Easy enough on the drinkability scale for th ehop intensity."
"Drinkability/Notes: Wow ! What a fantastic DIPA. Big time pine and citrus notes with just the slightest bit of malt to give it some semblance of balance. However, this is all about those delicious simcoe hops. Dry and crisp in the mouth with a bitterness that makes the mouth beg for more. Great looking in the glass with fantastic aroma qualities. Definitely one of the best DIPAs' I've sampled and glad that Weyerbacher is going to make this a year round offering since this is my last bottle. Easy to drink without any trace of alcohol in the flavor profile despite the 9% abv. Run, don't walk to your nearest store if this is around. Highly recommended. A hop heads dream."
"22 oz. bomber with no freshness date. It pours an unfiltered copper with medium carbonation and two fingers of beige head that has good retention and recedes slowly, leaving nice lacing. At first the aroma is oily and soapy/perfumy with sweet malts, but I soon find passionfruit, strawberry/raspberry, grapefruit, and a cedary/woody character. A very unique smelling hop I must say. There are lots of sweet malts on the palate, making the mouthfeel almost syrupy, but the hops do their damnedest to balance, contributing all the same flavors with the addition of earthy and piney qualities. It is smooth and quite full from the start, like a barleywine, with medium carbonation and a long finish. Overall an above average DIPA, but I was expecting more of a hop bomb, as the malts are a bit too prevalent and sweet for it to be one of the very best."
"Pours an amber color with a very tall head that has nice retention and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. The aroma is, well, all hops. Lots of pine and citrus hops. Everything else seems to be masked by the hop aromas. The flavor has a lot of caramel malt sweetness, but it is followed immediately by a big hop punch. Lots of bitterness in this one as well as lots of citrus and pine hop flavors. The bitterness lingers on the palate. Not as extreme as some I've had, but it's pretty hoppy. The intense bitterness dries out the tongue. Has a medium body and good drinkability."
"Stop. If you are in the mood for the best DIPA in the Northeast, this is it. Absolutely phenomenal. IMO, DIPA are kind of messy, this one is all types of balanced, not overly hoppy, nice warming alcohol, fruity, but not sour on the nose. Would have rated this a """5"" in the mouthfeel category, but it is a little sugary. @ 9%, you've got to be kidding me. ABV to taste ratio is the best in ANY beer I've tried. OUTSTANDING beer!!!"
"M&D - an amazing beer, a great DIPA, definitely not for the casual beer drinker, but anyone who appreciates craft or considers themselves a DIPA fan should try this beer, worth the hype"
"Flavor is almost over-the-top but pulls back from ebing too much and is a nice compromise. Lots of springy, sprucey and citrusy hops. But all nicely balanced by a malty, woody base that supports the whole concontion. Medium mouthfeel but the hop oils really do kind of linger around the mouth and expand the palate a bit. Very drinkable but not for folks who frown on hoppy beers."
"This brew pours a clear amber-orange color with a brilliant and stable white head. The aroma is a balanced mix of caramel malt and grapfruity hops, backed by a persistant alcohol smell. Theres more malt in the aroma than I expected, and it has a rustic, slightly earthy quality. The flavor is somewhat sweet, with a lot of citrus. Pretty good warming sensation from the alcohol. The hops really kick in at the hind-taste, with a prominent bitterness. All of the balance goes out the window in the finish, which slides into a long-lasting resiny, bitter hop flavor. The beer is a little grainy, with some tannin qualities and astringency, but its not unfitting. Moderate carbonation and fairly pretty full body. This is a rich brew with a lot of great qualitiesintensity and aroma are chief among them. Certainly worth having."
"Slainte!"
"**Edit. The second glass from the bomber was loaded with floaters. The first glass which I reveiwed had none."
"A most excellence brew. My first taste of Simcoe hops. I hope I can grow some."
"Drinkablity is moderate, even though this is an excellent DIPA. The piny flavors do get to me after a while."
"Pours a gorgeous dark amber, with light glinting through the beer and off the yeast floating in the beer. White, soft, sticky, tenacious head. Aromas of passionfruit initially, with more piney and minty notes coming out at higher temperatures. Very bitter up front, but with quite a bit of balancing malt sweetness, followed by an alcoholic burn and astringent hop note toward the end that somehow mesh together really well. The finish is long and active on the tip and sides of the tongue. Fairly big carbonation fills the mouth at the mid-palate, along with a thick slickness. Overall, this is excellent stuff: thick, slightly sweet, quite bitter, with both elements balancing each other for the most part. Thick, satisfying malts and an interesting hop join to create a very interesting, satisfying beer. Very well done."
"Wow, this is one hell of a double. Smells of citrus are flowing out of this like a river. Tastes are almost like sucking on a pine tree witch makes this really tasty. Tastes of alcohol are really not that present however you can feel the warm soothing taste hit your stomach. IF you are a fan of double dont think twice and pick this gem of a beer up."
"Too bad ...I like just about everything these guys brew."
"D- Good sipping beer, could not do alot of these, but a good beer, would buy again. 4"
"This just may become my highest rated beer to date. I was expecting something a bit heavier and more difficult to drink, but this was a pleasant surprise."
"I guess I can't say it's a terrible beer, it just didn't live up to the hype."
"A clean copper/orange beer. Has a big foamy beige head with plenty of lace. The aroma is all hops. Mostly a strong piney character up front. With a light sweet citrus background. The mostly pine character continues in the taste with just a hint of malt sweetness wandering in and out. Very interesting but that very strong piney character gets almost medicinal befroe the very dry hop finish."
"I knew that Simcoe hops were quite smooth, but I am definitely impressed by how smoothly fruit focused this hop is. Sure it is in fact a hop so it does have some of that raw hop character, but comparatively to many other varieties it is down right mellow (especially in the amounts that must have been used for this beer). Really a lingering, lightly green, tannic note that just mouth coatingly sticks around is what tells me that a lot of hops were used in this brew. This is definitely enjoyable, and regardless of the outcome, I will always be a fan of a beer that so boldly show-cases the effects of a single hop variety. Simcoe is a perfect candidate for something as big as a one hop Double IPA, it is so smooth, yet at times I wonder if that raw, aggressive hoppiness that other varieties contribute is not missing from this brew. Regardless, this has shown me that my choice of Simcoe in the hop mix of my own brews is a good choice and will require further experimentation."
"The smell is very strong. There's a ton of somewhat herbal hop flavor in there. The taste has plenty of malt with hops running strong all the way through. Bitterness drops quickly in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is very good for the alcohol content."
"Mmmm... Simcoe Jolly Ranchers....mmm...."
"was it worth losing a chance to bang the beer prom queen? no. was it f'n good as sh*t? yeah. weyerbacher would be stupid not to make this a year-rounder."
"D- A very good beer. Easy to drink but it is a sipper. Very nice big hop flavors. It is up there with one of my favorite DIPA's."
"It's also another great beer in a long line of great beers from Weyerbacher."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- As if one could actually contemplate mouthfeel during the viscious hop attack going on here, it's pretty subtle and even thin for the beer's weight. The texture doesn't foam out after a gentle swish... it virtually liquifies and goes down without much form. This is one rough beer to get through... it's a hell of an example of single-hop varietal brewing, but drinkable it is not. Time to prep the coffeemaker for some action in the morning."
"A hop lover's dream. For 9.0% ABV they hide it very well but it's sure a drinkable DIPA."
"The pour yielded a rich golden-copper view. The initial aroma was wonderful - yielding a citrus-grapefruit nose. The taste was quite good to me. I favor other styles over the IPA style, but this Simcoe IPA from Weyerbacjer is worth trying and getting again. The taste has a complexity that favors """tasty"""."
"Overall impression: Wow! A hop jack-in-the-jaw with enough malt to make this a balanced treat. What a way to showcase a particular hop variety. I must admit, Weyerbacher is very hit and miss with me (see their 11th anniversary ale for a """miss""" example). However, this beer is a solid hit for me. Strongly recommended."
"Excellent outing from Weyerbacher. If you're a hop fan it's great. If you like balance, go elsewhere. I like hops a lot so I loved it. Hope it's still available next week when I return."
"I've been wanting to try this brew for sometime and it didn't disappoint. I love the Simcoe hops both for their aroma and taste."
"D - If it wasnt for the high ABV this would be a great all the time beer."
"Overall a very flavorable and quaffable DIPA. ABV is not readily detectable."
"Poured a copper almost orange color. A very dense one finger head stays steady after the pour. Piney sweet aroma, no citrus there yet.... First sip=citrus hop flavor right off the bat and that Simcoe Grapefruit flavor kicks in also. A thick resinous mouthfeel-almost sticky as the malt is felt not really tasted yet. A good froth sweetens the brew and releases a different bitterness as some of the citrus fades and a more astringent hop flavor emerges and stays to the finish, very nice. As this IPA warms up, the malt flavors are more evident. A sweet malt flavor is tasted and caramel flavors are ther albeit subtle. I have hop-heads who are not big on Simcoe hops, this IPA was unique and tasted great all around."
"Drinkability: If you like hops, there is no reason you will dislike this beer. Very hoppy, and if that is your thing you will like it."
"Seek this beer out. It's a fine one."
"A very drinkable DIPA though long sessions would probably be discouraged because of the high abv and the total palate blast residue that lingers. A bomber would probably be just right for that nightly hop jones, or a late night snack after a long work day."
"D - Well, it could be worse here. It is a bit thick and the hops make for a very potent flavor. It isn't meant for food, and one bomber is plenty, but it is good. It is a bit too sweet to score well here. The flavor will make you take the next sip, but the refrshing nature (or lack thereof) certainly won't. Double IPA isn't my favorite style, but this is an excellent example of one."
"D: This one has the tastiness for a hophead, but I didn’t find myself drinking it quite as fast as most other 2IPA’s that I've had."
"Poured a clear medium apricot color with slightly off-white puffy head. Modest lacing. Smell is would be expected, loaded with piney grassy hops. I felt like I was in an evergreen forest. Taste is enjoyable, with strong domination by the hops. A bit lacking in the malt department, and is a bit unbalanced. Nice full mouthfeel. The beer got better with each taste, as it slowly warmed. And was at its best at rrom temperature. A nice well done beer"
"Pours a clear deep amber with a substantial head that lingers. Smells of wonderful flowery hops. Taste is reminiscent of Ballantine IPA. Never thought I'd say that. Well balanced with virtually no notice of the alcohol content. The finish is quite complex and displays some sweetness that gives way to the intense hops."
"D - DIPA's like this (and Stone's 10th) are great, but for the simple fact of the sweetness from the malt required to balance the intense hoppiness, drinkability suffers a little bit. Another cold weather drinker or nightcap. This is really nice - Great to see Weyerbacher getting the recognition they deserve - this should be readily available for me locally too which is awesome."
"I just got a case today and had my first one. To my understanding, Simcoe has now become a year round brew (correct me if I'm wrong). I poured into a tall glass, and witnessed an incredible head form. Like was said a couple of posts ago, there was a fruity smell. I smelt pineapple like the post claimed, but my girlfriend got a wiff of apple. The only complaint I have is that the texture left much to be offered. Overall I great beer. Don't drink and review."
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. Hazy, very """thick""" looking body with the appearance of apple cider. Head rose above the rim and stayed there forever. Scents of fruit hit my nose and grapefruit and pineapple came to mind. Very bitter taste from the hops with a hint of grapefruit lingering on the tongue. A medium-bodied brew that goes down rather well. Excellent."
"Pours a cloudy reddish-copper with a nice foamy head (1.5-2 inches). A huge hop kick dominates the smell, but it's blended with a citrusy-fruity mix that works wonders for the nose. And as expected, the hop kick comes through in the first sip...despite the 9.0 ABV, the brew is very well-balanced; it's very warming going down, but bounces back with a citrus aftertaste, masking the alcohol very nicely. For you hop-heads out there, this is definitely the way to go!"
"An enjoyable beer, yet I don't think I could drink more than a bomber of this in a night. If you get the chance, give it a try. Solid DIPA."
"Well, the big grapefruit notes are still there with a touch of grass but I'm noticing more of the malt this time, a touch of caramel and a bit of bread. More balance than I reported in my first review. Nice medium mouthfeel and it finishes with a nice bitter hop kick. I'm so glad I got a chance to try it again so I could put a few more details in this addendum to my review. Thanks Kevin!"
"Bottle courtesy of Hogtownharry: Poured a deep reddish color ale with a big foamy head with good retention. Aroma of citrus hops is pretty intense and covers the malt. Taste is also dominated by huge fresh citrus hops. Malt is certainly present but hard to taste with all the hops in there. Body is above average and beer is not over filtrated. Alcohol is well hidden. Overall, while this IIPA is very enjoyable, a better balance between malt and hops would have provided more enjoyment on my part."
"All in all I enjoyed this beer, but it would be tough to put away more than two."
"I was looking for a hophead explosion with this one and was pleasantly surprised to find a complex flavor in addition to a hoppy brew."
"Great tasting, good drinking beer. Not devastating to your senses, but a little too much in the mouth to make me want more than one (ok, maybe two) a night."
"Bomber. An amber/orange color, hazy, with a large ivory colored head. Aroma was all grapefruit, maybe a hint of honey. Taste follows aroma, with the grapefruit being huge. This did tone down a little as the beer warmed. A big, sweet malt backbone in the middle carried all those hops. Body was medium, with low to medium carbonation. Seems like the carbonation could be punched up just a bit. A bit drying. This is one heck of a DIPA, and I will drink plenty more of it."
"Good stuff."
"On the thick side, and generously carbonated. Despite its dryness, this is a sappy, sticky mouthfeel. Very drinkable for its size, it went away rather quickly. I'm fairly new to DIPAs, but I liked this one, I found its sweetness held in check much better than in 90 Minute IPA."
"Very drinkable. Very smooth. I have always been a fan of Weyerbacher and now I'm a big fan of simcoe hops."
"Super easy drinking, bitterness wasn't as bad as I thought it would be."
"Mouth is thick and creamy. I can just imagine how jealous other brewers will be of a mouthfeel like this. This is a fantastic IPA and easily one of the absolute best I have encountered. Weyerbacher be proud ... you done good."
"Except you're ready to do it again thirty seconds later."
"Poured a dark amber color with a small, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma was piney, tangerine, some citrus, very juicy, resin and light toffee malt. Taste of grassy hops, lots of hops, resiny pine, some caramel malts, citrus fruits, light toffee, dry grapefruit bitterness, and light alcohol in the finish. A very good IIPA, falling just short of the world class, 4.5 score, but the best Weyerbachers done yet. Different batches produce varying results. A recent draft sample showed tons of diactyl, while the bottles are still drinking nice."
"Pours a nice cloudy amber orange with a medium sized tan head. The smell is very strong with citrus aromas dominating this beer. The taste is all hops with a citrus flavor of grapefruit, tangrine, and orange and a real bitter hop aftertaste. The m/f is medium and very well balanced making this beer outstanding."
"I'm not going to lie. I love Weyerbacher, I love Simcoe hops, and I love DIPAs, but this beer was way out of whack. Aroma was a strong hoppiness, but did not forewarn of what was ahead. The flavor/mouthfeel combination (I do not lie) reminds me of earwax. Something is wrong here. It's not the IBUs, it's not the abv, but something is awry, and I don't like it. Again, I love Simcoe hops, (check out the Dreadnaught for a wonderful example), and I've made some wonderful homebrew with them. There is just something terribly unbalanced about this beer that I can't quite put my finger on. Check out the far superior Weyerbacher 11 if you like a strong but delicious malt/hop balance."
"Liquid hop resin is probably the best way to describe the flavors of Double Simcoe. A very pleasant offering, despite the aggressive alcohol presence."
"Pours a deep caramel brown leaving a thick creamy tan head that sticks to the side of the glass. The aroma is spicy, sharp, simcoe hops, caramel, cooked butter, toffee, pine are in the front of the aroma. The taste is wonderful starts with a piney sharp bitter bite in the beginning but moves to slight fruity malty caramel balance but this brew is dominated by a huge wonderful hop feel on the palate that is bitter but makes this a refreshing ale. This is a great IIPA and for 4.99 a 22oz bottle I'll be stocking up on this one!"
"An absolutely SUPERB DIPA! Pours a slightly hazy amber-orange color producing a huge, frothy, durable off-white head which persists throughout the glass. Lots of heavy lacing as glass empties. Excellent balance between the malts and hops in the aroma profile, noting caramel, toasted malt, freshly cut grapefruit, pine needle, and good ol Juicy Fruit gum. Aroma is simply mouth-watering. Mouthfeel is slick and smooth; somewhat oily, but full. Flavors are a luscious myriad of bittersweet grapefruit, pine, orange, honey, spices and crystal malts. Finish is long and well balanced between the hops, malt and alcohol. Really enjoyed this one. One of the best DIPAs Ive had the pleasure to sample. And what a deal at $4.99/22 ozer!"
"Fine lacing on the inside of the glass like tiny sheets of dewey spiderwebs. Super-thick dextrinous mouthfeel helped the malt hang around, which was a good thing. Modest carbonation may have contributed to the dry finish. Gentle aromatic alcohol in the back of the mouth during the aftertaste. I rested one corner of my glass on the bottlecap in order to pool every last drop in the other corner of the glass. Too bad about the cloudy appearance, this beer could have fared much better in my overall rating."
"12 oz. bottle shared at our last brewday. Pours a clear orange, big white head forms, good retention and super amazing lace. Smell is sweet, some caramel, and an assload of pine/floral hops, really fragrant and what I like to smell in a DIPA. Taste is very sweet and toffeeish up front, followed by a super pine kick through the middle, finishing with some floral, two extremes but ends up very balanced and tasty. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low to medium carbonation, real clean bitterness. Excellent DIPA, everybody should use Simcoes. Thanks DrJay!"
"Deep copper body topped by a 1.5""" cream colored head that is composed of tightly-formed foam. It hangs around for the entire glass. Absolutely beautiful. The head is so creamy it almost feels like sucking whipped cream off the top of the beer. The aroma has a good bit of hop florals with maybe a touch of pine and a touch of malt sweetness. The first sip presents alcoholic sweetness immediately challenged by a smooth bitterness. A ton of hop flavor, almost sweet in nature (ever had EK Golding tea? Reminds me of that natural hop sweetness) but then there's the resinous bitterness that lingers behind. Alcoholic warmth is also noted, but not in a burning or overpowering way. Mouthfeel is solid, and supports the bold flavors of this beer very well. Drinkability only suffers because it is a 9% ABV beer, and it doesn't try to hide it at all. An outstanding offering from Weyerbacher."
"This is one of the best double IPAs I've ever had. Presviously I was very impressed with Weyerbacher's oaked beers but not their others. I am very impressed that they were able to come up with such a great double IPA and I hope they continue to come up with great new stuff."
"A little drier and less malt character would make this one a world-class DIPA."
"One of my favorites from Weyerbacher. Good stuff."
"Pours a bubbly, lightish amber with a great, thick head. The smell is a very sweet, fruity, citrus hop aroma with some orange and grapefruit noticeable. The flavor starts out hoppy with sweet grapefruit taste, then gets a little malty, then finishes with a tangy, bitter hop finish. Nice. The mouthfeel is a really good medium-thick body with nice carbonation and a smooth, dry, mouth-watering feeling at the end. Overall, one of the best DIPA's I've had."
"A rich, slightly orange maple syrup color, with a ton of golden white head souffle-ing over the glass, and lots of intricate lacing. Smell is full of rich molasses malts and a wonderfully complex hop presence, with sublte fruitiness and a bit of chocolate. Just the faintest touch of alcohol. I left the room for a moment, and when I got back I could smell it from across the room! The taste is very diverse and comes in stages, but is nicely balanced throughout. The first thing you get is a sweet, appley, piney front, a nice warm and rich hop kick on the middle, and a great mellow malt finish. It has a great body in the mouth, which seems more balanced by the hops than it is by the carbonation. This beer has a huge kick to it, but it really does go down well. If I had one word to describe this, it would be """serious""". Seriously"
"Thanks to Ev from PA for giving me the opportunity to try this wonderful brew."
"D- I like this one way too much! Great brew and a perfect example of a double IPA."
"Good to have a DIPA that stands out from the others - love that resinous pine quality. Obviously a great utilization of Simcoes and well worth picking up if you can get your hands on it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2""" tan head over the very cloudy orangey amber brew. Head fades on the edges, leaving a moat around the resilient center plateau of brew, with heavy coating lacing. Aroma is sweet grains and fruity hops. Taste is initially balanced, with ample pale malt sweetness and fresh green hops, but the hops kick it into gear and keep coming, yet still don't overdo with bitterness. Mouthfeel is suh-mooooth, and oh-so drinkable. A dangerous brew that I look forward to revisiting, almost makes me think of (dare I say it?) Dreadnaught. Yum."
"Yup that's worth getting. Very uplifting hops and nice malts."
"Initially rewarding work to drink. Warmth eventually created a less than pleasant beverage."
"D: This beer is dope. Enough said."
"Mouthfeel is really smooth and creamy and it just rushes across the tongue with mellow carbonation. This brew is simply a joy to drink with a blast of hoppy goodness in each sip. A hophead's delight for sure and a testament to the Simcoe hop. I wish this brew was available to me as I'd likely drink it on a regular basis. An awesome Double IPA from Weyerbacher...bring on more single hop brews!! Thanks to blitheringidiot for being nice and sharing."
"Obscured copper. Towering, dense beach sand colored head that settles from the bottom up like a nitro tap pour. Mixed size bubbles pop and leave sheets of thick lacing. The head maintains a rocky mountain cap all the way down. Huge floral and pine aromas waft around the glass and are noticeable from a distance. Fresh and citrus rind crisp as well. Inviting. Bold and brash initially, the pine and rind hits big and powerfully. The ample malt body provides a complimentary sweetness and girth into the finish which is filled with fresh oily rind notes. The hops are resinous and juicy and there is a slightly numbing effect, but this does not impact negatively. There is no hint of the alcohol and the finish is perpetual, leaving me to think I'll be tasting this one tomorrow as well. Full bodied and with minimal carbonation, the luscious silky smooth mouthfeel is almost cask-like. Not sessionable, but why would you? This is a beer to be savored and enjoyed as it is delicious, delectable and absolutely a must find."
"D: Very smooth, highly drinkable. Alcohol is there and could make its presence known quickly, but very very enjoyable!"
"Great texture, great flavor, vibrant and memorable, ...simcoe is a hop-lover's wet dream, and this delivers their deepest fantasies all the way to the money shot. Ahhhh!!!"
"Sits really heavy on the stomach. This is a huge beer, pretty good flavor but I think this one is a bit too sweet and syrupy. Its got lots going for it but the sweetness kills it for me."
"Beer is good. No, beer is a miracle! Happy beering."
"btw...maybe i don't mind simcoe"
"This one is definitely a sipper in a big way."
"Drikability: This is one big beer with a lot of flavor; it is not the easiest beer to drink however, as the piney resins and alcohol are a bit overwhelming"
"Hazy amber with a creamy off-white head. Thick sheet-like lacing. Grapefruit and cannabis aromas with an underlying sweetness of caramelly malts. Wow, this sucker is sweet and boozy. Heavy syrupy mouthfeel (even when pretty cold), crystal sweetness galore. The malts actually override the hops here -- which is saying a lot since the hop content is pretty steep. Regarding those hops, the Simcoes deliver on what they promise: juicy, resinous (piney) flavor with minimal harsh bitterness. Maybe my palate has been trained to actually like the brashness of high-cohumulone hops, or maybe I just think that the rather cloying candy-sweetness of this beer could benefit from some bitterness, but I'm not really feeling this one more than simply as an experimental single-hop beer. Interesting, but one is enough for me, thank you."
"D - Pretty good when you need a hop fix. Toning down the alcohol flavor might help this one become even more drinkable."
"A real nice offering in the style from Weyerbacher...hope their success in how this one is received allows them to produce it again."
"Mouthfeel has a puckering bitterness that is associated mostly with the hops but there is some huskiness bitterness as well. A """sweet and sour""" beer. Medium to full bodied. Alcohol content makes this a one bomber and done beer."
"Drinkability: After drinking this, though I enjoyed it immensely, my mouth's saying """give me a rest already...""" Great stuff, fairly cheap at around $4-$5 a bottle, a fairly high level alcohol that's not really discernible when you drink, and an experience like this with a Double IPA hat I've yet to have. All those are great things in my book. I'll be buying more. Thanks again Weyerbacher."
"Weyerbacher is a fantastic brewery, and their new beers seem to get better and better (forgetting the Prophecy of course). Can't wait to see what their Triple IPA comes out like. Cheers to Weyerbacher!!"
"The Weirback's... good job folks...I'm from Weirton so now we can go back to the Weyerbacher Simcoe DIPA...I am a fan in general of all of this Eastern PA breweries beers yet some have wowed me over time others have been less than satisfactory. By no means a hit or miss brewery I just go with what I like and try everything new from 'em that I can. The only beers bottled beers I'm missing are the Imperial Pumpkin and the Decadence, anywho back to this fine brew it appears a copper amber hue that forms a massive cream colored head and melds into an impressive biscuit looking texture floating atop my brew leaves behind thick even streaks of lacing with each sip. Aroma contains deep earthy, piney, and grapefruit citrus layers with a spiced bready notes and just a dousing of alcohol, some newbie would probably consider this beer to be soapy but anyway you slice it I like the varietal IPA trend. Flavor consists of a sugary sweet doughy malt layer paired with ample resinous hop flavor fresh from the vine, herbal, citrus, pine, and a bit of funky earthiness all come across the palate. Evident but not overwhelming with the 9% alcohol toasty caramel nut with fruity highlights in the malt department such a good mix great DIPA. Mouthfeel is medium to full body range with enough sticky-ickiness to put a smile on my face even a gentle natural carbonation here as well. Drinkability...extremely flavorful yet refreshing and oh so tasty will bring on a parade of hop burps and it forces me to crave another, good thing I snagged four bottles of this lovely brew."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly viscous, giving this a syrupy feel to it almost. Perhaps Weyerbacher's best offering. This shows the East coast can brew DIPA's as well as the West. Ranks up there with Stone Ruination as one of the best DIPA's I've sampled."
"I emplore my fellow malt fans to give the hops a chance and try this beer, it just may change your mind."
"Thanks to my buddy Dale aka hoppedup for sending this and many other gems from NC,poured deep orange infused copper with a big blooming slight off white head that settled ever so slowly leaving globs of lace behind.Oh man the aromas pine,pine and more pine with underlying grassiness and grapefruit rind its almost all hops with a small dose of caramel malt base but like I said its small.The big piney notes samck your palate and lets them know who in charge,a hop lovers dream here very piney and resiny I notice a tangerine-like flavor in a long lingering finish,there is a touch of sweetness and breadiness to let you know there is a pretty hefty malt base but the hops steal the show and what a show it is.The alcohol creeps but is pretty much in check,a damn fine DIPA and to me is true to form,unbelievably I cant get in the Buffalo area I wish I had more."
"Amber color with orange and red highlights. Off white head that maintains fairly well and leaves behind vertical streaks of lacing. Big hop smell with tons of citrus and pine. Taste is also all about the hops. A very grapefruit like bitterness and plenty of pine mixed in for good measure. This one packs a punch. Very full and chewy mouthfeel. The 9% is well hidden by the bitterness and is really not noticable at all. Overall was very pleased with this one and look forward to more IPA experiments from Weyerbacher."
"Poured a medium-orange color with subtle rust highlights and a creamy, white colored head that dissipated slowly. Heavy carbonation with giant bubbles seemingly leaping out of my pint glass. Aromas of hops, citrus, grapefruit, and alcohol. The taste is dominated by fresh, juicy hop flavors, though there is a mild malt character for balance. Somewhat creamy and smooth in my mouth with a lingering bitterness that turns slightly sour. Crips and bursting with flavors of hops and tropical fruits. A very good example of this style with enough hops to please hop lovers. After 1 bomber, I was done, but I could see that under the right conditions, I could have more."
"Wow. This is a great extremely bitter brew. This one isn't for the drinkers who aren't only vaguely fond of very bitter hops. Mmmm mmm. Go find this one."
"My 2nd sampling of a bottle of this, and it's as good as I remember. Brilliant copper, sticky ivory head. Bubblegum and pine in the aroma, which also define the initial flavors of this one, and something about this is clearing my sinuses. Yow. Unbelievably herbal and eccentric in its tree-like pine and spruce flavors, and the bitterness throughout is cutting and abrasive. Not a flavor profile for the weak or uninitiated! Luckily, I am neither and certainly enjoy its soapy bitterness. Subtle juicy citrus notes in the middle, while the finish continues to be leafy, resiny and herbal with notes of black pepper. Mellow carbonation. This is not your typical American Double IPA brimming with juicy grapefruits and Cascades. This is tongue puckering bitter with a seriously interesting, unique and overpowering hop profile. This is not for those who smother themselves in weaksauce. I can dig it."
"Glowing copper orange with partial haze, only a slim head but a nice crusty ring accompanies the beer throughout the session. Strong hops dominate the nose with a real piney/herbal bite. Smells very dry-hopped although I don't know for sure if it is. The taste carries a sweet grapefruit hop tang with an earthy and bready finish with nice lingering bitteness. A bit strong in alcohol, but it doesn't detract any. Thickness is between light and medium, and it has a slight syrupy feel. Carbonation is adequately light. I very much enjoyed this brew, the taste never gets too sweet, nor overly sour leaving a nice balance of flavors worth experiencing again."
"D: Definately a drinkable beer. Very tasty offering from Weyerbacher. Glad I got to try this one, and if I see it, I'll definately buy it."
"Drinkability- Fairly harsh DIPA, but tasty. One was enough in a sitting for me, but I would try again for sure. Much thanks to Jetsbeer for this great brew!"
"Large burnt orange amber color with a head that stayed with me the whole way though and laced the entire glass. Smelled of sticky hops, piney and citrus pith with the sweet background of malt. The taste is driven by the flavor of the hops, not overly bitter in the killer way. The balance is stuck well for this beer and the alcohol is a real no-show which makes it all the smoother. I could drink this regularly, or wait make that I will."
"Nice! This really wrecked my palate for the evening (but in a very good way). Averys Maharaja was a joke when it followed the Simcoe."
"Nice beer. Thanks to KilgoreTrout27."
"Very nice-orange to amber color with a decent carbonation level and a very nice, tight white head. Good aroma-I dont think I have had too many beers that smell as """fresh""" as this one. It has a good, resiny hop aroma-you can almost see the hops the aroma is so """bright""". Very hoppy flavor-has more bitterness then some recent double IPAs I have had. Grapefruity and grassy but an underlying bitterness. Touch of lingering sweetness in the finish.Good body-dry finish leaves the tongue a bit parched! Overall a very enjoyable beer. The whole package is very well done. I was getting tired of some of the Weyerbacher brews-I just found there were better ones out there of various styles. This one is a winner for sure."
"Body is just above medium, and needs just a little more substance to support all the massive flavors. Mouthfeel is creamy and quite slick, with a slippery, almost sticky texture. Considering the high abv% and the freshness of this beer, it's dangerously smooth and drinkable. No trace of it's strength. Next to the Idiot and Insanity, this is my new Weyerbacher favorite."
"Hazed amber/orange with a short, dense, eggshell coloured head. Decent retention and moderate lacing. The aroma started out with lemon and cat urine, but his faded quickly and became intense pine with plenty of grapefruit rind. Some earthiness to the hops as it warmed. Solid bitterness with a strong unsweetened grapefruit juice character. Caramel malt was apparent at first, but faded as hops grew into the finish and lingered for some time. Fairly balanced though for an over the top beer, with a bit of warmth in the finish. Creamy texture with moderate carbonation and some hop dryness. A good beer, but the Simcoe hops were a little more one-dimensional in the flavour than I expected from my previous homebrewing experiments."
"We both loved it."
"22 oz. bottle, label states 9% ABV. Pours a clear copper color, thick fluffy off-white head. Great head retention. Aroma is piney, orange, and some lemons. Good caramel malt flavor, which hold its own, despite the great amount of hop bitterness. Flavors are very much like the aroma, pine, lemon, orange. Good body, and a nice soft carbonation. Great patches of sticky lace on the sides of the glass. Finishes dry. Alcohol seems pretty well hidden until it warms. Very solid."
"Thanks Brian! ...now, where to get a few cases????"
"Just what the hop doctor ordered. More malt presence would have added some needed balance, but if you're in the mood for Simcoe hops this is the poultice."
"Pours deep amber, with a sticky, fluffy head. Aroma is good, piney, soft. Taste is outstanding. Not over-the-top hop. Nice, slight pine notes. Resiny. Mouthfeel is good, alcohol is well hidden. Very drinkable, thank goodness for Imstillthegman and BIF 33 for the chance to try this!"
"Pours an amber to red in color with a large tan head that dissipates slowly to a thin layer which leaves plenty of lacing on the glass. Grassy and sweet citrusy hop aromas, nothing overpowing in the nose. Some bitter grapefruit and sweet maltiness in the taste with a slightly spicy bitterness in the finish and a major alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is creamy but lighter in body than I expected. The hop aroma and taste are nice but not huge, a little understated compared to others in the DIPA category. The alcohol on the other hand is quite large, at times it was not as noticeable, at other times I found myself wishing for more maltiness to balance/hide it a bit more."
"Drinkability is very solid. Again, a tad thin for a DIPA but except for a little bit more malt this brew is all about the hop notes. Very pleasant brew and solid offerring."
"I've been looking to fill the Smutty Big A void until the next batch is done, and I happened upon this big green monster by accident. I didn't even know it existed and I found 1 bottle in the cooler at State Line. And what a Monster it is!!! Simcoe bitch slaps you as soon as the top is popped. Golden amber pour with very nice, lingering lace. But man, those Simcoes. Piney, citrusy, extremely aromatic. This is one extreme beer and if you're the least bit hop-shy, stay away because not only will Simcoe bitch-slap you, but he'll bend you over and pound you like he hasn't seen a woman in years. The alcohol is covered nicely and malt is fleeting, however it does sweeten this beer a little too much. I'm a Weyerbacher fan, and this does not disappoint. But it makes me miss Stash."
"Overall, this wasn't a bad beer, but it didn't live up to what I was expecting. I had tried one beer before that featured Simcoe hops (local brewery Legend's Hopfest), which I thought was fantastic. However, I'm not sure that Simcoes can carry a beer by themselves. They are fantastic aroma hops, but don't do much for me in the flavor department. Like I said, this was a good beer, but not in the league of, say, 90 Minute in terms of taste, balance, and drinkability."
"Received from xcjetta in HBIF3, reviewed about a week ago, entered from notes."
"Wow! What a beer. Pours a dark amber in color with a nice frothy head. From the minute you open this offering, you know that you are in a world of hurt. Wonderful hop aroma from the Simcoe hops (whatever these are). The higher alcohol content balances well with the crazy IBU level. A great representation of the Double IPA style. Overall, great beer!"
"Drinkability: At 9% abv, not a brew to be taken lightly, or in heavy doses."
"Nearly a perfect score from me but the drinkability takes a slight hit just because the hops last so long and are so drying you need a beer to calm your taste buds back down after drinking more than a few of these. Thank God this isn't a one time brew as originally thought. Great job Weyerbacher!!!"
"Poured a tall dense tan-colored head that lasted forever, and left strings of lace as I drank. Dark amber looking beer with a few bubbles rising slowly through the middle. Impressively clear for such a big hoppy beer. Aroma of pungent grapefruit hops with a bit of sweet herbal-ness to it. Fairly thick and sweet beer. A bit of caramel and some tea flavors in there. The finish has a chewy bite thats enjoyable."
"Yet another excellent brew from Weyerbacher. Dan & co. are hitting their stride, big time."
"Good but not the dreadnaught."
"Bomber bottle, cost me $5 at New Beer on Christie in NYC, No freshness indication to be gleaned, pours slightly golden tinged medium amber. Supports a tan long lasting head and leaves well developed and extensive lacing. Nose here is brightly of pine and citrus peels. Densely hopped tasty brew. Loads of resiny pine, plus smooth rounded grapefruit notes. Full throtle, hoppy brew, get some fresh and enjoy this ballsy offering from W'Bacher"
"overall- ive been dreaming in my sleep about this stuff ever since i read about it. Finally tracked it down and picked one up the first day it hit the shelves at my local shop. I had high expectations but wasnt let down at all. This is definitely a sipping beer, and can only be appreaciated by true hop lovers. The intese hops and present but overshadowed malt character make this similar to some american barleywines ive had. Im sure this would age well, but i for one would not want to calm this one down at all."
"Simcoely, er, I mean simply, this is an outstanding example of an Imperial IPA, and I'm extremely proud of my local brewery. Come Saturday, I'm off to stock up at the source."
"Musings: A nice DIPA that needs to find its true identity in the spectrum. If we stay in the local strain - it is not 90 Minute. Further, Unearthly, Smutty and even Stoudt's seem to me better examples of the style."
"This beer poured a beautiful orange/amber color with a 3/4 inch creamy head that lingered in the glass. The head only dissipated slightly in size and left a layer of sticky lace on the glass. Aroma was an enticing mix of hoppy herbals, apricots, citrus and piney smells. Very nice. Taste was just as good or better. Incredible flavors of apricots, peaches, mango, hop bitterness and grapefruit. Also present is a good malty, caramelly flavor that complements the hoppiness perfectly. Alcohol is there, but barely evident. Mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy on the palate. This beer was dangerously easy to drink. I could have finished 2 bombers by myself, but thought better of it. I stopped at 1 and a half. Excellent beer and by far the tastiest offering I've had from Weyerbacher."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has an excellent hop attack. The hop attack is blunted by the caramel maltyness of the beer. The beer is well balanced and never goes over the top. The beer has a creamy full bodied mouthfeel. The beer is hoppy as all hell but never becomes abrassive. The alcohol in the beer is well covered up in the smell, taste and mouthfeel of the beer. This is just a very tasty beer treat all the way around. I am going to have to purchase more of this one. I am glad this will be a seasonal offering. Thank you Weyerbacher for this beer treat. If you like hoppy beers you will not be disappointed."
"p.s.: Further bottles have revealed pretty noticeable alcohol..."
"Pours a cloudy golden amber, with a massive beige head that retains impressively...looks imposing. The aroma is also impressive, huge piney and resinous hops out front, with some citrusy and floral notes in the background, along with caramel, toasted bread, fruity esters and some alcohol. The flavor is just as good, starting off with massive piney and resinous hops, along with some caramel, citrus, toasted bread, fruity esters, and an ever so slight hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is bordering on thick with light carbonation. Drinkability is good. A kick ass DIPA, definately worth seeking out."
"The flavor delivers the same whopping hop-smack that the nose does, softened a bit by the gently caramelish and doughy malt beneath. It's rich and full and bitter, but not overdone. It finishes extremely dry with a lingering bitterness although the hops and malt fade shortly. The alcohol remains well-cloak for the most part, but does start to become apparent towards the end of the glass, adding a peppery side that helps to dry it."
"Drinkability: nice and easy drinking. The alcohol levels keep this down a notch. Pick one of these up."
"Overall a very drinkable beer. At $4.89 a bottle, I will go back for a couple more."
"22 ounce bottle."
"An interesting DIPA and quite enjoyable. I will drink this again."
"Mouthfeel is full and chewy, and drinkability is decent."
"Pours a hazy ruby copper color with a nice two finger head that rises just above the rim of my glass. Nice lacing is left behind. Smells as the name suggests it would...of hops! Light citrus with a stronger grassy / pine scent. Also a bit of sweet bread in the background. Once I got my nose out of the glass and took a sip my mouth was greeted by a truckload of hops. Strong pine and grapefruit tingles the tongue. Then when I was least expecting it...a sweet malt taste comes to play, although it didn't stay long before the bitter finish arrived. Mouth feel is very nice. Almost creamy medium body with the expected hop oil slickness and dry finish. Excellent DIPA. Now I need to get some more of these...off to the store."
"This is a very impressive beer. It poured into the glass with big creamy off white head on top of red/copper body. The smell has citrus (apricot), some piney notes, and a bready malt. The taste starts with the citrus hops and then a hint of piney bitterness all balanced by a bready malt. I tried this twice once at cellar temp and once a little cooler. At cellar temp the taste seems much more balanced. The body is smooth and creamy; I love the way this feels in my mouth. Very drinkable; you only get a hint of the alcohol when the beer gets warmer."
"Overall, the best DIPA i've ever had. Simply amazing and something Weyerbacher should be extremely proud of."
"Cheers!"
"This is a good one overall. I'd go back to it again for sure."
"Being a hophead, I must say, the simcoe hop is one of the yummiest out there, and the apricot hints it lends make a delectable addition to the double IPA style. This beer shows off the profile very nicely."
"Overall I like this brew. It is no Runination, but it is very good nonetheless."
"Mouthfeel is of a medium bodied brew, plenty of citrus jumping out, and very clean."
"Overall- A nice big flavorful D-IPA that doesn't finish off as dry as I was hoping. It almost completely disguised the alcohol, but otherwise a good offering from Weyerbacher and an IPA I would like to try on tap!"
"While I will probably never be a fan of this style (super hopped IPA's)which seems to be running rampant across the country, I really think Double Simcoe is an excellent, well crafted ale. It may be due to it being a single hop variety ale, letting its individual characteristics stand out and be appreciated. I generally did not like the Hops Infusion, with its advertised 7 varieties, for example."
"This beer is about as basic as a hefty IPA can get, and its biggest strength lies in its simplicity. The concise list of ingredients combine to lend good depth, and it is a pleasure to drink. The ABV is a real warmer, but I never truly noted it until I felt it in my head after drinking a fair quantity, so beware. Still, it drinks smooth and easy, straightforward and full-flavored. It goes to show that there's plenty of fun in fundamental beer crafting."
"This is an exceptional beer. I liked weyerbacher's beers before this, but this has to be by far the best they have made. From the pour on it looks awesome. It is a solid amber with a large fluffy whit head which displays incredible lacing. The smell is foward of fruity, floral hops which i think the simcoe hop gives a little extra diversity. It is balanced perfectly by the malts. You can just tell this is going to be a good one. The taste is wonderful. There is an explosion of flavor on the tip of the tongue. Hops, citrus fruits, maybe even alittle bit of young apple and pear. Then comes the hops. While they are strong they are not over the top like some other ipa's ive had. They give a quick hit, then let the rest of the flavors come, then linger. It just has something extra in it i loved. This beer coats your mouth to great extent, there is not a taste bud in your mouth that isn't going crazy. Drinkablity is very high on this beer. There is no alcohol taste so beware and it is very smooth for something as hoppy as it is. Loved it."
"Highly Recommended!!"
"Anyone who has written off Weyerbacher for any reason needs to go out and buy this, a new Hops Infusion, some Blithering Idiot, and some aged QUAD (and Raspberry Imperial Stout) if they can find it. Good things are happening. All they need to do is an Oak aged Belgian-style pale ale (and make this a year-round 4-pk)!"
